The morning after Jan's return, Mr. Melville came again to the bungalow  and he and the captain called Jan to get in the automobile with them.  Hippity-Hop's forlorn little face peered between the curtains of the  front window, but none of them heard her plaintive cry as they all  vanished from her sight. When the automobile stopped, Jan saw a grey  building of stones with windows crossed by iron bars. He followed his  friends into a large room where several men were seated. They spoke to  the captain and Mr. Melville, and all looked at Jan, patting his head  for some reason, as they talked of him.    Then Jan, the captain, and Mr. Melville followed another man through  long dim hallways that had doors on either side, very close together.  One of these doors was unlocked, and as Jan and his friends passed  through, the door was shut and locked again.    They were in a dingy room with grey walls, the only window being high up  and criss-crossed by bars. It was a very small window. On a cot in a  corner of the room sat a man. He turned his head toward them and when he  saw the dog, he jumped to his feet, calling, \"Jan!\"    \"Woof!\" answered the dog in surprise as he leaped toward the man.    Shorty dropped on his knees and took Jan's head between his hands,  talking to the big dog as though talking to a little child whom he loved  very dearly. Jan did not know, nor would he have cared had he known,  that Shorty was in jail. He only knew that this was his friend who had  tried to protect him from William's abuse. And all the while, Captain  Smith and the artist were watching them with kindly eyes.    At last, Shorty rose and sat on his narrow cot, with his two visitors on  either side, and Jan, planted right in front of Shorty, turned his head  from one to the other as though he were trying to understand what they  were talking about so earnestly. Shorty's hand stroked Jan's head, and  every once in awhile the man would say, \"I'm so glad you found him.\"    \"You love dogs, don't you?\" asked the old poundmaster, as they rose to  go.    Shorty looked down at Jan for a second, then answered, \"I never had any  friends in my life excepting dogs.\"    They left Shorty alone in the little grey room and went back to the men  in the big room, where the sun streamed across the floor like a tiny  river of gold, but back in the other room the window was so high and so  small that the sun could not shine through it at all. Shorty did not  think about that now.    The captain talked to the men, who listened attentively, and finally he  said, \"Judge, I don't believe that any one who loves dogs and is kind to  them is bad all the way through. Shorty says he never had a friend in  his life except dogs.\"    \"I do not think he is naturally bad,\" answered the judge, who sat in a  big chair back of a high desk. \"From what I can learn, he has been under  William Leavitt's control since they were children. Shorty tried to get  away from his brother twice, but each time William found and punished  him so brutally that the boy was afraid to venture again. There are  scars on Shorty's feet made by a hot iron the last time he tried to  escape from his brother. Shorty is not quite nineteen yet. That is how  he comes under the Juvenile Court.\"    \"Judge,\" exclaimed the captain, his face alight with eager pleading,  \"you know there's lots of people that folks call bad, who would be  decent if they had a chance. Can't you give Shorty a chance to show that  he wants to make good? Send him some place where his brother can't find  him?\"    \"Your Honor,\" the artist spoke now, \"if there is any way to arrange it,  I would like to take the lad up to Roseneath and we will try to help him  make good in our Land of Make-Believe, as we call our home.\"    Jan did not understand what they were saying, but he knew it had  something to do with Shorty and that the captain was talking very  earnestly, so the dog edged between his two friends and stood watching  the man at the high desk, for all in the room were looking at him. This  man was very quiet, and seemed to be thinking, then he looked up and  said, \"Bring Shorty in here.\"    A few minutes passed in silence, then the door swung open and Shorty  shuffled through it. He blinked in the bright sunlight and ducked his  head as though he were afraid to look up at them all. Jan moved quickly  and pushed his nose into Shorty's hand. The face above him lighted with  a sudden, winning smile. The judge watched them both but did not speak.  Then Shorty remembered where he was and raised his head to face the man  on the high platform. That man was looking with very kindly eyes at the  lad and the dog.    \"Shorty,\" the judge spoke very plainly, \"if I give you two years'  suspended sentence and let you go with Mr. Melville to live on his  ranch, will you try to make good?\"    Shorty only stared stupidly. The judge repeated his words more slowly  and added, \"We will not let it be known where you are, so you need have  no fear of William. I want to know if you will give me your solemn  promise--your word of honor--to do your very best?\"    Shorty's face twitched, his eyes blinked fast, his hands reached out as  if he were feeling for some other hand to grasp. The hands hesitated,  groped, then one hand moved upward across his face as though to brush  something away that kept him from seeing plainly. Those in the room  watched but made no sound.    \"Do you mean it, Judge?\" the lad's voice was low and husky, but there  was a tone of pleading in it. \"You ain't just fooling, are you, Judge?\"    \"No,\" the judge spoke very firmly, \"I'm not fooling, Shorty. You are  going to get your chance.\"    They saw Shorty fling himself down on his knees beside Prince Jan and  pull the dog close to him, while racking sobs shook the boy's shoulders.  Jan twisted around to lick Shorty's face and comfort him, for the dog  did not know his friend was crying from happiness. At last Shorty rose  to his feet, brushing away the tears with his ragged coat sleeve.    \"Judge, I promise you I'll make good or I'll die in the trying,\" he  said, and all those who heard him knew he would do his best.    The judge stepped down from the big chair and put his hand on the boy's  shoulder, saying in a kindly voice, \"You're bound to make good, Shorty,  and we are all your friends!\"    The other men shook Shorty's hand, and the judge said, with a smile, \"I  have a nice collie pup up at my home that I will give you, if Mr.  Melville doesn't object.\"    \"We have no dog, now that Prince Jan is gone,\" the artist answered  quickly, \"and I promised my wife that I would bring back some kind of a  dog for the children. They would be lonesome now, without one. So the  pup will be just as welcome as Shorty will be.\"    Shorty forgot this man was a judge, and smiled at him, asking, \"What's  the pup's name, please?\"    \"He is a registered pup with a long fancy name, but we just call him  'Pup,' so you can pick out a name to suit yourself.\"    \"I'm going to call him 'Prince Jan'!\" announced the boy, and all agreed  that it was a fine name for any pup.    They shook hands once more with Shorty and wished him good luck, and  when the boy walked from the room, he held his head high. A smile was on  his lips and hope in his eyes. Mr. Melville walked beside him.    That evening when Jan, Hippity-Hop, Cheepsie, and the captain were  sitting together, the old man looked at the dog and said, \"Jan, your  ancestors rescued travellers from the snow, but to-day you helped  Shorty get a new start in life, and that is a bigger thing than if you  had saved him from death in the Alps.\"    The dog did not understand the words, but he knew that the smile was the  same happy smile that came when the old poundmaster had found a good  home for one of the friendless dogs. So Jan was happy, too.          Chapter XII    THE POUNDMASTER'S PROBLEM      FOR several days after Shorty had gone on his way to the Land of  Make-Believe with Mr. Melville, life ran very quietly and happily for  Prince Jan and his friends in the little bungalow on the cliffs. Then he  began to notice that Captain Smith was worried, and when Jan poked his  nose into the hand of his friend, though the hand stroked the dog's  head, the poundmaster did not smile and his eyes looked as if he saw  something Jan could not see. It worried Jan, though he could do nothing  but lie quietly with his anxious eyes fixed on the old man's face.    One evening after supper a loud knock at the door caused the dog to look  up quickly, while Hippity-Hop jumped with fuzzed tail and excited eyes.  The captain opened the door and two men came in. They shook hands with  him and sat down in the chairs he pushed forward. The two men looked  around the room, stared at the dog, then turned to Jan's master. The  look on the poundmaster's face made the dog feel certain that these men  had something to do with the old man's worry, so Jan went over and sat  close to him, resting his big head on the captain's knee.    \"Is that the dog that was stolen?\" one of the visitors asked at last.    \"Yes,\" replied the captain. \"This is Prince Jan. He was sent to the  pound almost dead with mange and orders through the stableman that the  dog was to be killed because he was vicious. But,\" the poundmaster  smiled down at the dog that was gazing with loving eyes into his face,  \"you see, all he needed was kind treatment and proper care.\"    \"I understand, Smith,\" the other man now spoke in a voice that sounded  cross to Jan, \"that you are violating the City ordinances, and are  keeping the dogs that are brought to the pound. They are sent here to be  killed, not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14900"],[0,"The Black Man's Place in South Africa (#13)"],[1,"  brother is in itself sufficient to account for the not unduly large  number of theftuous crimes with which he is credited as a class; but on  the other hand, the propensity in the primitive male that leads to  sexual assaults upon women is undoubtedly checked and lessened by  education and school-discipline. Education will bring out and give scope  to all that is good and all that is bad in the Native as it has done  with the white man. If the Natives have not sunk to those depths of  infamy which are disclosed daily in the criminal courts of Europe and  America it is not because of want of the usual percentage of criminally  disposed people among them but because of want of education and  opportunity. Commercial immorality and developed swindling are  impossible without a commerce, but the cupidity that begets these forms  of vice is not lacking amongst the Natives and waits only for the  opportunities which developed commerce affords. The potential capacity  for criminality and immorality is indeed no less among the Natives than  among Europeans. Theft, arson, murder and rape are the most common forms  of crime committed by the Natives to-day because the opportunities for  perpetrating systematic fraud are as yet few among them. Unnatural  immorality is common enough in the kraals and in the \"compounds,\" for  the Natives have their \"perverts\" as well as the whites. At the Native  \"beer-drinks\" crapulous lewdness is as common as it is in the bucolic  orgies of European peasantry. There is no \"Native\" innocence nor is  there any \"Native\" vice, the virtue and the vice, the capacity and the  character of the Native are the human qualities and failings that are  common to mankind.    The Native is no more able to withstand the enervating effects of  isolation than the European, he is no more anxious to work hard for  small wages, no more and no less capable of honesty and thrift, no more  and no less endowed with human virtue, no more and no less cursed with  the vices of the world, no more human and no less divine than is his  master, the white man.    When Machiavelli asserts in general of men that \"they are ungrateful,  fickle, false, cowards, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are  yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life and  children--when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn  against you.\" He thought, no doubt, of white men only, but to me his  appreciation of the baser side of human nature seems no less applicable  to the black people of South Africa, and when, on the other hand,  Shakespeare declaims:         \"What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! How infinite in       faculty!\"    he also, we may be sure, thought of his own kind, but to me, again, the  beautiful words, which usage cannot cheapen, express the wonder I have  often felt at the wealth of imagery, the mental grasp, the wisdom and  the natural dignity in very many untutored natives I have met with, and  it is this experience which makes me believe that the present difference  between the Europeans and the Native race is one of degree and not of  kind, and that, in the fullness of time, achievement will follow the  latent genius with which, as I hold, nature has endowed, in equal degree  with ourselves, the great Bantu branch of the human family.    Yet I am no encomiast of the Natives, for I know them to be no better  than other people, but search as I may, I cannot find that Native  character which is alleged to be inherently different from the white  man's character. Did not Mark Twain find, as the most conspicuous result  of his travels, that \"there is a good deal of human nature everywhere,\"  and is it not true that human nature is everywhere the same?    We are far too apt to exaggerate both in our disparagement and in our  praise of backward people. Many people still think, if they think at  all, of the South African Native as a being of the kind imagined by  Hobbes when he wrote: \"Man in his natural state is towards man as a  wolf,\" and, on the other hand, there are still many who regard him,  after the fancy of Rousseau, as a sort of primitive man-child existing  in a state of natural innocence from which he is being driven by the  corrupting influence of the civilised invaders. But all this is wrong.  The Native is not a savage. Even before the whites came to South Africa  the Bantu lived in social order under a political system in which the  principles of constitutionalism were clearly recognised. To-day the  Bantu are simply a race of barbarians in various stages of transition  from a crude civilisation to a highly developed civilisation, and we  shall do well to remember that the process of transition which we are  now witnessing is one in which individual mistakes and failures will be  more conspicuous, though no more significant, than the general advance.      MISCEGENATION.    If it is true that the human nature of the Bantu is no whit different  from the human nature of the Europeans then it is a fair question to  ask why the two races should not be able to live together in liberty,  equality and fraternity as people of one nation or body politic. It is  because human nature is governed by laws which, unlike the laws of  mathematics, cannot be laid down with certainty that we find ourselves  unable to give a positive answer to this question. The human nature of  the whites, like the human nature of all races that have been  predominant before, is swayed by the feelings of pride and prejudice  that arise through differences of complexion, physical appearance and  bodily odour, as well as the difference in racial achievement, and these  essentially human feelings, if they remain as strong as they now are in  South Africa, will render impossible the fraternity that implies the  liberty to intermarry, so that there arises for our consideration a  second question, namely, whether without full fraternity and social  equality the two races may yet live together in the land in political  liberty and equality.    We observe from the earliest times a rhythmic play, as it were, of  opposite forces that tends, alternately, to build up and to break down  and mingle human races, but of the laws that underlie and govern these  forces we know little or nothing. On the one hand we see how man has  always and everywhere shown what the advocates of so-called racial  purity have called \"a perverse predisposition to mismate\" which has made  it exceedingly difficult to classify existing human varieties. On the  other hand we see throughout nature how a pronounced disparity between  varieties of the same species engenders an aversion from one another of  the different varieties which seems to arise, in men and animals alike,  through the instinct of sexual jealousy which is probably bound up with  the primary instinct of self-preservation. Those people who profess  belief in the inherent superiority of a particular race naturally look  upon the tendency towards race-blending as a perverse proclivity, while  those who think that all men are potentially equal regard it as a  wholesome instinct provided by nature to counteract the feebleness and  infertility which cause the dying-out of the race that becomes too  pure.    Racial antipathy seems to depend in the degree of its strength upon the  degree of physical disparity between given races. In the so-called Latin  races of to-day, prejudice against black people is certainly weaker than  in the blond races of Northern Europe. Is this aversion a matter of  absolute instinct or is it an acquired social characteristic and as such  liable to change? I think the answer must be that this racial repugnance  is not naturally inherent in children, nor in women towards the men of a  different kind, nor in men towards the women of another race, but that  it arises naturally and spontaneously and, in this sense, instinctively,  through the feeling of jealousy which is caused, in both men and women,  by fear of losing their natural mates to rivals of both sexes from  another and disparate race.    White children who grow up together with Native children certainly have  no instinctive feeling against their black playfellows; they have to be  taught to look down upon and keep away from the companions of their  childhood, a fact which no candid observer will deny. It is also a  truism of history that the fair-skinned women of a conquered country,  as a rule, will yield themselves easily to the swarthy barbarians who  have killed or overcome their husbands and brothers. The many women who  in British seaports, and in the German towns that were recently occupied  by French coloured troops, have lived and cohabited with African men  have proved by so doing that they have had no instinctive racial sense  of hostility against black men. It has been stated by independent and  competent witnesses, who are corroborated by German newspapers of good  standing, that the black troops have a very marked attraction for a  large number of German women, and that the German men hate the black men  because the German women do not.[22] The fact that white women in South  Africa and in the Southern States of America never associate with black  men does not, I think, prove that they are controlled by instinctive  racial or sexual aversion but rather that women, as a whole, are, by  reason of their physical inability to dispute with men the ultimate  ratio of all order that lies in brute force, thoroughly amenable to the  rule of social conventions imposed upon them by their jealous masters. I  say this because we see that the aversion that has been inculcated from  without tends to disappear wherever the man-established conventions  lapse or cease to govern either through the comparatively small numbers  of black men being insufficient in certain localities to cause fear in  the white men living there, as in some seaport towns, or through the  temporary break-down of the"]]]
