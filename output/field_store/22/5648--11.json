He did not entirely abandon his other  capitals, Nineveh and Assur, visiting them occasionally, but Calah was  his favourite seat, and on its adornment he spent the greater part of  his wealth and most of his leisure hours. Only once again did he abandon  his peaceful pursuits and take the field, about the year 897 B.C.,  during the eponymy of Shamashnuri. The tribes on the northern boundary  of the empire had apparently forgotten the lessons they had learnt at  the cost of so much bloodshed at the beginning of his reign: many had  omitted to pay the tribute due, one chief had seized the royal cities of  Amidi and Damdamusa, and the rebellion threatened to spread to Assyria  itself. Assur-nazir-pal girded on his armour and led his troops to  battle as vigorously as in the days of his youth. He hastily collected,  as he passed through their lands, the tribute due from Kipani, Izalla,  and Kummukh, gained the banks of the Euphrates, traversed Grubbu burning  everything on his way, made a detour through Dirria and Kirkhi, and  finally halted before the walls of Damdamusa. Six hundred soldiers  of the garrison perished in the assault and four hundred were taken  prisoners: these he carried to Amidi and impaled as an object-lesson  round its walls; but, the defenders of the town remaining undaunted,  he raised the siege and plunged into the gorges of the Kashiari. Having  there reduced to submission Uda, the capital of Lapturi, son of Tubisi,  he returned to Calah, taking with him six thousand prisoners whom he  settled as colonists around his favourite residence. This was his last  exploit: he never subsequently quitted his hereditary domain, but  there passed the remaining seven years of his life in peace, if not in  idleness. He died in 860 B.C., after a reign of twenty-five years. His  portraits represent him as a vigorous man, with a brawny neck and broad  shoulders, capable of bearing the weight of his armour for many hours at  a time. He is short in the head, with a somewhat flattened skull and low  forehead; his eyes are large and deep-set beneath bushy eyebrows, his  cheek-bones high, and his nose aquiline, with a fleshy tip and wide  nostrils, while his mouth and chin are hidden by moustache and beard.  The whole figure is instinct with real dignity, yet such dignity as  is due rather to rank and the habitual exercise of power, than to the  innate qualities of the man.*         * Perrot and Chipiez do not admit that the Assyrian       sculptors intended to represent the features of their kings;       for this they rely chiefly on the remarkable likeness       between all the figures in the same series of bas-reliefs.       My own belief is that in Assyria, as in Egypt, the sculptors       took the portrait of the reigning sovereign as the model for       all their figures.    The character of Assur-nazir-pal, as gathered from the dry details  of his Annals, seems to have been very complex. He was as ambitious,  resolute, and active as any prince in the world; yet he refrained from  offensive warfare as soon as his victories had brought under his rule  the majority of the countries formerly subject to Tiglath-pileser I. He  knew the crucial moment for ending a campaign, arresting his progress  where one more success might have brought him into collision with some  formidable neighbour; and this wise prudence in his undertakings  enabled him to retain the principal acquisitions won by his arms. As a  worshipper of the gods he showed devotion and gratitude; he was just to  his subjects, but his conduct towards his enemies was so savage as to  appear to us cruel even for that terribly pitiless age: no king ever  employed such horrible punishments, or at least none has described with  such satisfaction the tortures inflicted on his vanquished foes.    Perhaps such measures were necessary, and the harshness with which he  repressed insurrection prevented more frequent outbreaks and so averted  greater sacrifice of life. But the horror of these scenes so appals the  modern reader, that at first he can only regard Assur-nazir-pal as a  royal butcher of the worst type.

Assur-nazir-pal left to his successor an overflowing treasury, a valiant  army, a people proud of their progress and fully confident in their own  resources, and a kingdom which had recovered, during several years of  peace, from the strain of its previous conquests. Shalmaneser III.* drew  largely on the reserves of men and money which his father's foresight  had prepared, and his busy reign of thirty-five years saw thirty-two  campaigns, conducted almost without a break, on every side of the empire  in succession. A double task awaited him, which he conscientiously and  successfully fulfilled.         * [The Shalmaneser III. of the text is the Shalmaneser II.       of the notes.--TR.]    Assur-nazir-pal had thoroughly reorganised the empire and raised it to  the rank of a great power: he had confirmed his provinces and vassal  states in their allegiance, and had subsequently reduced to subjection,  or, at any rate, penetrated at various points, the little buffer  principalities between Assyria and the powerful kingdoms of Babylon,  Damascus, and Urartu; but he had avoided engaging any one of these  three great states in a struggle of which the issue seemed doubtful.  Shalmaneser could not maintain this policy of forbearance without loss  of prestige in the eyes of the world: conduct which might seem prudent  and cautious in a victorious monarch like Assur-nazir-pal would in  him have argued timidity or weakness, and his rivals would soon have  provoked a quarrel if they thought him lacking in the courage or the  means to attack them. Immediately after his accession, therefore, he  assumed the offensive, and decided to measure his strength first  against Urartu, which for some years past had been showing signs of  restlessness. Few countries are more rugged or better adapted for  defence than that in which his armies were about to take the field. The  volcanoes to which it owed its configuration in geological times, had  become extinct long before the appearance of man, but the surface of the  ground still bears evidence of their former activity; layers of basaltic  rock, beds of scorias and cinders, streams of half-disintegrated mud  and lava, and more or less perfect cones, meet the eye at every turn.  Subterranean disturbances have not entirely ceased even now, for certain  craters--that of Tandurek, for example--sometimes exhale acid fumes;  while hot springs exist in the neighbourhood, from which steaming  waters escape in cascades to the valley, and earthquakes and strange  subterranean noises are not unknown. The backbone of these Armenian  mountains joins towards the south the line of the Grordyasan range; it  runs in a succession of zigzags from south-east to northwest, meeting at  length the mountains of Pontus and the last spurs of the Caucasus.    [Illustration: 079.jpg THE TWO PEAKS OF MOUNT ARARAT]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by A. Tissandier.    Lofty snow-clad peaks, chiefly of volcanic origin, rise here and there  among them, the most important being Akhta-dagh, Tandurek, Ararat,  Bingoel, and Palandoeken. The two unequal pyramids which form the summit  of Ararat are covered with perpetual snow, the higher of them being  16,916 feet above the sea-level. The spurs which issue from the  principal chain cross each other in all directions, and make a network  of rocky basins where in former times water collected and formed lakes,  nearly all of which are now dry in consequence of the breaking down of  one or other of their enclosing sides. Two only of these mountain lakes  still remain, entirely devoid of outlet, Lake Van in the south, and Lake  Urumiah further to the south-east. The Assyrians called the former the  Upper Sea of Nairi, and the latter the Lower Sea, and both constituted  a defence for Urartu against their attacks. To reach the centre of the  kingdom of Urartu, the Assyrians had either to cross the mountainous  strip of land between the two lakes, or by making a detour to the  north-west, and descending the difficult slopes of the valley of the  Arzania, to approach the mountains of Armenia lying to the north of Lake  Van. The march was necessarily a slow and painful one for both horses  and men, along narrow winding valleys down which rushed rapid streams,  over raging torrents, through tangled forests where the path had to be  cut as they advanced, and over barren wind-swept plateaux where rain and  mist chilled and demoralized soldiers accustomed to the warm and sunny  plains of the Euphrates. The majority of the armies which invaded this  region never reached the goal of the expedition: they retired after  a few engagements, and withdrew as quickly as possible to more genial  climes. The main part of the Urartu remained almost always unsubdued  behind its barrier of woods, rocks, and lakes, which protected it from  the attacks levelled against it, and no one can say how far the kingdom  extended in the direction of the Caucasus. It certainly included the  valley of the Araxes and possibly part of the valley of the Kur, and  the steppes sloping towards the Caspian Sea. It was a region full of  contrasts, at once favoured and ill-treated by nature in its elevation  and aspect: rugged peaks, deep gorges, dense thickets, districts sterile  from the heat of subterranean fires, and sandy wastes barren for lack of  moisture, were interspersed with shady valleys, sunny vine-clad slopes,  and wide stretches of fertile land covered with rich layers of deep  alluvial soil, where thick-standing corn and meadow-lands, alternating  with orchards, repaid the cultivator for the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17328"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 8 (of 12) (#13)"],[1,"B.C.)._    _Tanuatamanu reasserts the authority of Ethiopia in Egypt (664 B.C.),  and Tammaritu of Elam invades Karduniash; reconquest of the Said  and sack of Thebes--Psammetichus I. and the rise of the XXVIth  dynasty--Disturbances among the Medes and Mannai--War against Teumman  and the victory of Tulliz (660 B.C.): Elam yields to the Assyrians for  the first time--Shamash-shumukin at Babylon; is at first on good terms  with his brother, then becomes dissatisfied, and forms a coalition  against the Ninevite supremacy._    _The Uruk incident and outbreak of the war between Karduniash, Elam,  and Assyria; Elam disabled by domestic discords--Siege and capture of  Babylon; Assur-bani-pal ascends the throne under the name of Kandalanu  (648-646 B.C.)--Revolt of Egypt: defeat and death of Gyges (642 B.C.  ): Ardys drives out the Cimmerians and Dugdamis is killed in  Cilicia--Submission of Arabia._    _Revolution in Elam--Attack on Indabigash--Tammaritu restored to  power--Pillage and destruction of Susa--Campaign against the Arabs of  Kedar and the Nabataeans: suppression of the Tyrian rebellion  --Dying struggles of Elam--Capture of Madaktu and surrender of  Khumban-khaldash--The power of Assyria reaches its zenith._    [Illustration: 083.jpg PAGE IMAGE]          CHAPTER II--THE POWER OF ASSYRIA AT ITS ZENITH; ESARHADDON AND  ASSUR-BANI-PAL    _The Medes and Cimmerians: Lydia--The conquest of Egypt, of Arabia, and  of Elam._      As we have already seen, Sennacherib reigned for eight years after his  triumph; eight years of tranquillity at home, and of peace with all  his neighbours abroad. If we examine the contemporary monuments or the  documents of a later period, and attempt to glean from them some details  concerning the close of his career, we find that there is a complete  absence of any record of national movement on the part of either Elam,  Urartu, or Egypt.

The vignette, also by       Faucher-Gudin, represents Taharqa in a kneeling attitude,       and is taken from a bronze statuette in the Macgregor       collection.    The only event of which any definite mention is made is a raid across  the north of Arabia, in the course of which Hazael, King of Adumu, and  chief among the princes of Kedar, was despoiled of the images of his  gods. The older states of the Oriental world had, as we have pointed  out, grown weary of warfare which brought them nothing but loss of men  and treasure; but behind these states, on the distant horizon to the  east and north-west, were rising up new nations whose growth and  erratic movements assumed an importance that became daily more and more  alarming. On the east, the Medes, till lately undistinguishable from the  other tribes occupying the western corner of the Iranian table-land, had  recently broken away from the main body, and, rallying round a single  leader, already gave promise of establishing an empire formidable alike  by the energy of its people and the extent of its domain. A tradition  afterwards accepted by them attributed their earlier successes to a  certain Deiokes, son of Phraortes, a man wiser than his fellows, who  first set himself to deal out justice in his own household. The men of  his village, observing his merits, chose him to be the arbiter of all  their disputes, and, being secretly ambitious of sovereign power, he did  his best to settle their differences on lines of the strictest  equity and justice. By these means he gained such credit with his  fellow-citizens as to attract the attention of those who lived in the  neighbouring villages, who had suffered from unjust judgments, so that  when they heard of the singular uprightness of Deiokes and of the equity  of his decisions they joyfully had recourse to him until at last they  came to put confidence in no one else. The number of complaints brought  before him continually increasing as people learnt more and more the  justice of his judgments, Deiokes, finding himself now all-important,  announced that he did not intend any longer to hear causes, and  appeared no more in the seat in which he had been accustomed to sit and  administer justice. \"'It was not to his advantage,' he said, 'to spend  the whole day in regulating other men's affairs to the neglect of his  own.' Hereupon robbery and lawlessness broke out afresh and prevailed  throughout the country even more than heretofore; wherefore the Medes  assembled from all quarters and held a consultation on the state of  affairs. The speakers, as I think, were chiefly friends of Deiokes. 'We  cannot possibly,' they said, 'go on living in this country if things  continue as they now are; let us, therefore, set a king over us, so that  the land may be well governed, and we ourselves may be able to attend  to our own affairs, and not be forced to quit our country on account  of anarchy.' After speaking thus, they persuaded themselves that they  desired a king, and forthwith debated whom they should choose. Deiokes  was proposed and warmly praised by all, so they agreed to elect him.\"  Whereupon Deiokes had a great palace built, and enrolled a bodyguard  to attend upon him. He next called upon his subjects to leave their  villages, and \"the Medes, obedient to his orders, built the city now  called Ecbatana, the walls of which are of great size and strength,  rising in circles one within the other. The walls are concentric, and  so arranged that they rise one above the other by the height of their  battlements. The nature of the ground, which is a gentle hill, favoured  this arrangement. The number of the circles is seven, the royal palace  and the treasuries standing within the last. The circuit of the outer  wall is very nearly the same as that of Athens. Of this wall the  battlements are white, of the next black, of the third scarlet, of the  fourth blue, of the fifth orange. The two last have their battlements  coated respectively with silver and gold. All these fortifications  Deiokes caused to be raised for himself and his own palace; the people  he required to dwell outside the citadel. When the town was finished,  he established a rule that no one should have direct access to the king,  but that all communications should pass through the hands of messengers.  It was declared to be unseemly for any one to see the king face to face,  or to laugh or spit in his presence. This ceremonial Deiokes established  for his own security, fearing lest his compeers who had been brought up  with him, and were of as good family and parts as he, should be vexed at  the sight of him and conspire against him: he thought that by rendering  himself invisible to his vassals they would in time come to regard him  as quite a different sort of being from themselves.\"    Two or three facts stand out from this legendary background. It is  probable that Deiokes was an actual person; that the empire of the Medes  first took shape under his auspices; that he formed an important kingdom  at the foot of Mount Elvend, and founded Ecbatana the Great, or, at at  any rate, helped to raise it to the rank of a capital.*         * The existence of Deiokes has been called in question by       Grote and by the Rawlinsons. Most recent historians,       however, accept the story of this personage as true in its       main facts; some believe him to have been merely the       ancestor of the royal house which later on founded the       united kingdom of the Medes.    Its site was happily chosen, in a rich and fertile valley, close to  where the roads emerge which cross the Zagros chain of mountains and  connect Iran with the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, almost on the  border of the salt desert which forms and renders sterile the central  regions of the plateau. Mount Elvend shelters it, and feeds with its  snows the streams that irrigate it, whose waters transform the whole  country round into one vast orchard. The modern town has, as it were,  swallowed up all traces of its predecessor; a stone lion, overthrown and  mutilated, marks the site of the royal palace.

The chronological reckoning of the native annalists, as handed down  to us by Herodotus, credits Deiokes with a reign of fifty-three years,  which occupied almost the whole of the first half of the seventh  century, i.e. from 709 to 656, or from 700 to 647 B.C.*         * Herodotus expressly attributes a reign of fifty-three       years to his Deiokes, and the total of a hundred and fifty       years which we obtain by adding together the number of years       assigned by him to the four Median kings (53 + 22 + 40 +       35) brings us back to 709-708, if we admit, as he does, that       the year of the proclamation by Cyrus as King of Persia       (559-558) was that in which Astyages was overthrown; we get       700-699 as the date of Deiokes' accession, if we separate       the two facts, as the monuments compel us to do, and reckon       the hundred and fifty years of the Median empire from the       fall of Astyages in 550-549.    The records of Nineveh mention a certain Dayaukku who was governor of  the Mannai, and an ally of the Assyrians in the days of Sargon, and was  afterwards deported with his family to Hamath in 715; two years later  reference is made to an expedition across the territory of Bit-Dayaukku,  which is described as lying between Ellipi and Karalla, thus  corresponding to the modern province of Hamadan. It is quite within  the bounds of possibility that the Dayaukku who gave his name to this  district was identical with the Deiokes of later writers.*         * The form Deiokes, in place of Daiokes, is due to the Ionic       dialect employed by Herodotus. Justi regards the name as an       abbreviated form of the ancient Persian _Dahyaupati_--\"the       master of a province,\" with the suffix _-ha_.    [Illustration: 088.jpg VIEW OF"]]]
