In the dispensations gone before, the  feeble body of the world could not withstand a rigorous or powerful cure.  For this reason did Christ say: 'I have yet many things to say unto you,  matters needing to be told, but ye cannot bear to hear them now. Howbeit  when that Comforting Spirit, Whom the Father will send, shall come, He  will make plain unto you the truth.'(25)    Therefore, in this age of splendours, teachings once limited to the few  are made available to all, that the mercy of the Lord may embrace both  east and west, that the oneness of the world of humanity may appear in its  full beauty, and that the dazzling rays of reality may flood the realm of  the mind with light.    The descent of the New Jerusalem denoteth a heavenly Law, that Law which  is the guarantor of human happiness and the effulgence of the world of  God.    Emmanuel(26) was indeed the Herald of the Second Coming of Christ, and a  Summoner to the pathway of the Kingdom. It is evident that the Letter is a  member of the Word, and this membership in the Word signifieth that the  Letter is dependent for its value on the Word, that is, it deriveth its  grace from the Word; it has a spiritual kinship with the Word, and is  accounted an integral part of the Word. The Apostles were even as Letters,  and Christ was the essence of the Word Itself; and the meaning of the  Word, which is grace everlasting, cast a splendour on those Letters.  Again, since the Letter is a member of the Word, it therefore, in its  inner meaning, is consonant with the Word.    It is our hope that thou wilt in this day arise to promote that which  Emmanuel foretold. Know thou for a certainty that thou wilt succeed in  this, for the confirmations of the Holy Spirit are continually descending,  and the power of the Word will exert such an influence that the Letter  shall become the mirror in which the splendid Sun--the Word Itself--will be  reflected, and the grace and glory of the Word will illumine the whole  earth.    As for the heavenly Jerusalem that hath come to rest on the summits of the  world, and God's Holy of Holies, Whose banner is now lifted high, this  comprehendeth within itself all the perfections, all the knowledge of the  dispensations gone before. Beyond this, it heraldeth the oneness of the  children of men. It is the flag of universal peace, the spirit of eternal  life; it is the glory of the perfections of God, the circumambient grace  of all existence, the ornament bedecking all created things, the source of  inner quietude for all humankind.    Direct thine attention to the holy Tablets; read thou the I_sh_raqat,  Tajalliyyat, the Words of Paradise, the Glad Tidings, the Tarazat, the  Most Holy Book. Then wilt thou see that today these heavenly Teachings are  the remedy for a sick and suffering world, and a healing balm for the  sores on the body of mankind. They are the spirit of life, the ark of  salvation, the magnet to draw down eternal glory, the dynamic power to  motivate the inner self of man.            30: EXISTENCE IS OF TWO KINDS: ONE IS THE EXISTENCE OF ...      Existence is of two kinds: one is the existence of God which is beyond the  comprehension of man. He, the invisible, the lofty and the  incomprehensible, is preceded by no cause but rather is the Originator of  the cause of causes. He, the Ancient, hath had no beginning and is the  all-independent. The second kind of existence is the human existence. It  is a common existence, comprehensible to the human mind, is not ancient,  is dependent and hath a cause to it. The mortal substance does not become  eternal and vice versa; the human kind does not become a Creator and vice  versa. The transformation of the innate substance is impossible.    In the world of existence--that which is comprehensible--there are stages of  mortality: the first stage is the mineral world, next is the vegetable  world. In the latter world the mineral doth exist but with a distinctive  feature which is the vegetable characteristic. Likewise in the animal  world, the mineral and vegetable characteristics are present and in  addition the characteristics of the animal world are to be found, which  are the faculties of hearing and of sight. In the human world the  characteristics of the mineral, vegetable and animal worlds are found and  in addition that of the human kind, namely the intellectual  characteristic, which discovereth the realities of things and  comprehendeth universal principles.    Man, therefore, on the plane of the contingent world is the most perfect  being. By man is meant the perfect individual, who is like unto a mirror  in which the divine perfections are manifested and reflected. But the sun  doth not descend from the height of its sanctity to enter into the mirror,  but when the latter is purified and turned towards the Sun of Truth, the  perfections of this Sun, consisting of light and heat, are reflected and  manifested in that mirror. These souls are the Divine Manifestations of  God.            31: O THOU WHO ART DEAR, AND WISE! THY LETTER DATED ...      O thou who art dear, and wise! Thy letter dated 27 May 1906 hath been  received and its contents are most pleasing and have brought great joy.    Thou didst ask whether this Cause, this new and living Cause, could take  the place of the dead religious rites and ceremonials of England; whether  it would be possible, now that various groups have appeared, whose members  are highly placed divines and theologians, far superior in their  attainments to those of the past, for this new Cause so to impress the  members of such groups as to gather them and the rest into its  all-protecting shade.    O thou dear friend! Know thou that the distinguished Individual of every  age is endowed according to the perfections of His age. That Individual  who in past ages was set above His fellows was gifted according to the  virtues of His time. But in this age of splendours, this era of God, the  pre-eminent Personage, the luminous Orb, the chosen Individual will shine  out with such perfections and such power as ultimately to dazzle the minds  of every community and group. And since such a Personage is superior to  all others in spiritual perfections and heavenly attainments, and is  indeed the focal centre of divine blessings and the pivot of the circle of  light, He will encompass all others, and there is no doubt whatsoever that  He will shine out with such power as to gather every soul into His  sheltering shade.    When ye consider this matter with care, it will become apparent that this  is according to a universal law, which one can find at work in all things:  the whole attracteth the part, and in the circle, the centre is the pivot  of the compasses. Ponder thou upon the Spirit(27) : because He was the  focal centre of spiritual power, the wellspring of divine bounties,  although at the beginning He gathered unto Himself only a very few souls,  later on He was able, because of that all-subduing power that He had, to  unite within the sheltering Tabernacle of Christendom all the differing  sects. Compare the present with the past, and see how great is the  difference; thus canst thou arrive at truth and certitude.    The differences among the religions of the world are due to the varying  types of minds. So long as the powers of the mind are various, it is  certain that men's judgements and opinions will differ one from another.  If, however, one single, universal perceptive power be introduced--a power  encompassing all the rest--those differing opinions will merge, and a  spiritual harmony and oneness will become apparent. For example, when the  Christ was made manifest, the minds of the various contemporary peoples,  their views, their emotional attitudes, whether they were Romans, Greeks,  Syrians, Israelites, or others, were at variance with one another. But  once His universal power was brought to bear, it gradually succeeded,  after the lapse of three hundred years, in gathering together all those  divergent minds under the protection, and within the governance, of one  central Point, all sharing the same spiritual emotions in their hearts.    To use a metaphor, when an army is placed under various commanders, each  with his own strategy, they will obviously differ as to battle lines and  movements of the troops; but once the Supreme Commander, who is thoroughly  versed in the arts of war, taketh over, those other plans will disappear,  for the supremely gifted general will bring the whole army under his  control. This is intended only as a metaphor, not an exact comparison. Now  if you should say that each and every one of those other generals is  highly skilled in the military art, is thoroughly proficient and  experienced, and therefore will not subject himself to the rule of one  individual, no matter how indescribably great, your statement is  untenable, for the above situation is demonstrably what cometh to pass,  and there is no doubt thereof whatever.    Such is the case with the holy Manifestations of God. Such in particular  is the case with the divine reality of the Most Great Name, the Abha  Beauty. When once He standeth revealed unto the assembled peoples of the  world and appeareth with such comeliness, such enchantments--alluring as a  Joseph in the Egypt of the spirit--He enslaveth all the lovers on earth.    As to those souls who are born into this life as ethereal and radiant  entities and yet, on account of their handicaps and trials, are deprived  of great and real advantages, and leave the world without having lived to  the full--certainly this is a cause for grieving. This is the reason why  the universal Manifestations of God unveil Their countenances to man, and  endure"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19289"],[0,"Some Answered Questions (#13)"],[1,"ciples. They obscured Christ's Cause before the ignorant people,  saying, \"These prophecies are not of Jesus, but of the Promised One Who  shall come later, according to the conditions mentioned in the Bible.\"  Some of these conditions were that He must have a kingdom, be seated on  the throne of David, enforce the Law of the Bible, and manifest such  justice that the wolf and the lamb shall gather at the same spring.    And thus they prevented the people from knowing Christ.    Note.--In these last conversations 'Abdu'l-Baha wishes to reconcile in a  new interpretation the apocalyptic prophecies of the Jews, the Christians  and the Muslims, rather than to show their supernatural character. On the  powers of the Prophets, cf. \"The Knowledge of the Divine Manifestations,\"  p. 157; and \"Visions and Communication with Spirits,\" p. 251.          14: SPIRITUAL PROOFS      In this material world time has cycles; places change through alternating  seasons, and for souls there are progress, retrogression and education.    At one time it is the season of spring; at another it is the season of  autumn; and again it is the season of summer or the season of winter.    In the spring there are the clouds which send down the precious rain, the  musk-scented breezes and life-giving zephyrs; the air is perfectly  temperate, the rain falls, the sun shines, the fecundating wind wafts the  clouds, the world is renewed, and the breath of life appears in plants, in  animals and in men. Earthly beings pass from one condition to another. All  things are clothed in new garments, and the black earth is covered with  herbage; mountains and plains are adorned with verdure; trees bear leaves  and blossoms; gardens bring forth flowers and fragrant herbs. The world  becomes another world, and it attains to a life-giving spirit. The earth  was a lifeless body; it finds a new spirit, and produces endless beauty,  grace and freshness. Thus the spring is the cause of new life and infuses  a new spirit.    Afterward comes the summer, when the heat increases, and growth and  development attain their greatest power. The energy of life in the  vegetable kingdom reaches to the degree of perfection, the fruit appears,  and the time of harvest ripens; a seed has become a sheaf, and the food is  stored for winter. Afterward comes tumultuous autumn when unwholesome and  sterile winds blow; it is the season of sickness, when all things are  withered, and the balmy air is vitiated. The breezes of spring are changed  to autumn winds; the fertile green trees have become withered and bare;  flowers and fragrant herbs fade away; the beautiful garden becomes a  dustheap. Following this comes the season of winter, with cold and  tempests. It snows, rains, hails, storms, thunders and lightens, freezes  and congeals; all plants die, and animals languish and are wretched.    When this state is reached, again a new life-giving spring returns, and  the cycle is renewed. The season of spring with its hosts of freshness and  beauty spreads its tent on the plains and mountains with great pomp and  magnificence. A second time the form of the creatures is renewed, and the  creation of beings begins afresh; bodies grow and develop, the plains and  wildernesses become green and fertile, trees bring forth blossoms, and the  spring of last year returns in the utmost fullness and glory. Such is, and  such ought to be, the cycle and succession of existence. Such is the cycle  and revolution of the material world.    It is the same with the spiritual cycles of the Prophets--that is to say,  the day of the appearance of the Holy Manifestations is the spiritual  springtime; it is the divine splendor; it is the heavenly bounty, the  breeze of life, the rising of the Sun of Reality. Spirits are quickened;  hearts are refreshed and invigorated; souls become good; existence is set  in motion; human realities are gladdened, and grow and develop in good  qualities and perfections. General progress is achieved and revival takes  place, for it is the day of resurrection, the time of excitement and  ferment, and the season of bliss, of joy and of intense rapture.    Afterward the life-giving spring ends in fruitful summer. The word of God  is exalted, the Law of God is promulgated; all things reach perfection.  The heavenly table is spread, the holy breezes perfume the East and the  West, the teachings of God conquer the world, men become educated,  praiseworthy results are produced, universal progress appears in the world  of humanity, and the divine bounties surround all things. The Sun of  Reality rises from the horizon of the Kingdom with the greatest power and  heat. When it reaches the meridian, it will begin to decline and descend,  and the spiritual summer will be followed by autumn, when growth and  development are arrested. Breezes change into blighting winds, and the  unwholesome season dissipates the beauty and freshness of the gardens,  plains and bowers--that is to say, attraction and goodwill do not remain,  divine qualities are changed, the radiance of hearts is dimmed, the  spirituality of souls is altered, virtues are replaced by vices, and  holiness and purity disappear. Only the name of the Religion of God  remains, and the exoteric forms of the divine teachings. The foundations  of the Religion of God are destroyed and annihilated, and nothing but  forms and customs exist. Divisions appear, firmness is changed into  instability, and spirits become dead; hearts languish, souls become inert,  and winter arrives--that is to say, the coldness of ignorance envelops the  world, and the darkness of human error prevails. After this come  indifference, disobedience, inconsiderateness, indolence, baseness, animal  instincts and the coldness and insensibility of stones. It is like the  season of winter when the terrestrial globe, deprived of the effect of the  heat of the sun, becomes desolate and dreary. When the world of  intelligence and thought has reached to this state, there remain only  continual death and perpetual nonexistence.    When the season of winter has had its effect, again the spiritual  springtime returns, and a new cycle appears. Spiritual breezes blow, the  luminous dawn gleams, the divine clouds give rain, the rays of the Sun of  Reality shine forth, the contingent world attains unto a new life and is  clad in a wonderful garment. All the signs and the gifts of the past  springtime reappear, with perhaps even greater splendor in this new  season.    The spiritual cycles of the Sun of Reality are like the cycles of the  material sun: they are always revolving and being renewed. The Sun of  Reality, like the material sun, has numerous rising and dawning places:  one day it rises from the zodiacal sign of Cancer, another day from the  sign of Libra or Aquarius; another time it is from the sign of Aries that  it diffuses its rays. But the sun is one sun and one reality; the people  of knowledge are lovers of the sun, and are not fascinated by the places  of its rising and dawning. The people of perception are the seekers of the  truth, and not of the places of its appearance, nor of its dawning points;  therefore, they will adore the Sun from whatever point in the zodiac it  may appear, and they will seek the Reality in every Sanctified Soul Who  manifests it. Such people always attain to the truth and are not veiled  from the Sun of the Divine World. So the lover of the sun and the seeker  of the light will always turn toward the sun, whether it shines from the  sign of Aries or gives its bounty from the sign of Cancer, or radiates  from Gemini; but the ignorant and uninstructed are lovers of the signs of  the zodiac, and enamored and fascinated by the rising-places, and not by  the sun. When it was in the sign of Cancer, they turned toward it, though  afterward the sun changed to the sign of Libra; as they were lovers of the  sign, they turned toward it and attached themselves to it, and were  deprived of the influences of the sun merely because it had changed its  place. For example, once the Sun of Reality poured forth its rays from the  sign of Abraham, and then it dawned from the sign of Moses and illuminated  the horizon. Afterward it rose with the greatest power and brilliancy from  the sign of Christ. Those who were the seekers of Reality worshiped that  Reality wherever they saw it, but those who were attached to Abraham were  deprived of its influences when it shone upon Sinai and illuminated the  reality of Moses. Those who held fast to Moses, when the Sun of Reality  shone from Christ with the utmost radiance and lordly splendor, were also  veiled; and so forth.    Therefore, man must be the seeker after the Reality, and he will find that  Reality in each of the Sanctified Souls. He must be fascinated and  enraptured, and attracted to the divine bounty; he must be like the  butterfly who is the lover of the light from whatever lamp it may shine,  and like the nightingale who is the lover of the rose in whatever garden  it may grow.    If the sun were to rise in the West, it would still be the sun; one must  not withdraw from it on account of its rising-place, nor consider the West  to be always the place of sunset. In the same way, one must look for the  heavenly bounties and seek for the Divine Aurora. In every place where it  appears, one must become its distracted lover. Consider that if the Jews  had not kept turning to the horizon of Moses, and had only regarded the  Sun of Reality, without any doubt they would have recognized the Sun in  the dawning-place of the reality of Christ, in the greatest divine  splendor. But, alas! a thousand times alas! attaching themselves to the  outward words of Moses, they were deprived of the divine bounties and the  lordly splendors!          15: TRUE WEALTH      The honor and exaltation of every existing being depends upon causes and  circumstances.
