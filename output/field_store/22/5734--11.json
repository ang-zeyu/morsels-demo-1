(#13)"],[1,"  rendered that flourishing kingdom, during the course of near forty  years, a scene of horror and devastation, the great rival powers in  Europe were Spain and England; and it was not long before an animosity,  first political, then personal, broke out between the sovereigns of  these countries.    Philip II. of Spain, though he reached not any enlarged views of policy,  was endowed with great industry and sagacity, a remarkable caution in  his enterprises, an unusual foresight in all his measures; and as he  was ever cool, and seemingly unmoved by passion, and possessed neither  talents nor inclination for war, both his subjects and his neighbors  had reason to expect justice, happiness, and tranquillity from his  administration. But prejudices had on him as pernicious effects as ever  passion had on any other monarch; and the spirit of bigotry and tyranny  by which he was actuated, with the fraudulent maxims which governed  his counsels, excited the most violent agitation among his own people,  engaged him in acts of the most enormous cruelty, and threw all Europe  into combustion.    After Philip had concluded peace at Chateau-Cambresis and had remained  some time in the Netherlands, in order to settle the affairs of that  country, he embarked for Spain; and as the gravity of that nation, with  their respectful obedience to their prince, had appeared more agreeable  to his humor than the homely, familiar manners and the pertinacious  liberty of the Flemings, it was expected that he would for the future  reside altogether at Madrid, and would govern all his extensive  dominions by Spanish ministers and Spanish counsels. Having met with a  violent tempest on his voyage, he no sooner arrived in harbor than he  fell on his knees; and after giving thanks for his deliverance, he vowed  that his life, which was thus providentially saved, should thenceforth  be entirely devoted to the extirpation of heresy.[*] His subsequent  conduct corresponded to these professions. Finding that the new  doctrines had penetrated into Spain, he let loose the rage of  persecution against all who professed them, or were suspected of  adhering to them; and by his violence he gave new edge even to the usual  cruelty of priests and inquisitors. He threw into prison Constantine  Ponce, who had been confessor to his father, the emperor Charles;  who had attended him during his retreat; and in whose arms that great  monarch had terminated his life: and after this ecclesiastic died in  confinement, he still ordered him to be tried and condemned for heresy,  and his statue to be committed to the flames. He even deliberated  whether he should not exercise like severity against the memory of his  father, who was suspected, during his later years, to have indulged a  propensity towards the Lutheran principles: in his unrelenting zeal for  orthodoxy, he spared neither age, sex, nor condition: he was present,  with an inflexible countenance, at the most barbarous executions: he  issued rigorous orders for the prosecution of heretics in Spain, Italy,  the Indies, and the Low Countries: and having founded his determined  tyranny on maxims of civil policy, as well as on principles of religion,  he made it apparent to all his subjects, that there was no method,  except the most entire compliance or most obstinate resistance, to  escape or elude the severity of his vengeance.         * Thuanns, lib. xxiii. cap. 14.    During that extreme animosity which prevailed between the adherents of  the opposite religions, the civil magistrate, who found it difficult,  if not impossible, for the same laws to govern such enraged adversaries,  was naturally led, by specious rules of prudence, in embracing one  party, to declare war against the other, and to exterminate by fire and  sword those bigots who, from abhorrence of his religion, had proceeded  to an opposition of his power and to a hatred of his person. If any  prince possessed such enlarged views as to foresee, that a mutual  toleration would in time abate the fury of religious prejudices, he yet  met with difficulties in reducing this principle to practice; and might  deem the malady too violent to await a remedy, which, though certain,  must necessarily be slow in its operation. But Philip, though a profound  hypocrite, and extremely governed by self-interest seems also to have  been himself actuated by an imperious bigotry; and as he employed  great reflection in all his conduct, he could easily palliate the  gratification of his natural temper under the color of wisdom, and  find in this system no less advantage to his foreign than his domestic  politics. By placing himself at the head of the Catholic party, he  converted the zealots of the ancient faith into partisans of Spanish  greatness; and by employing the powerful allurement of religion, he  seduced every where the subjects from that allegiance which they owed to  their native sovereign.    The course of events, guiding and concurring with choice, had placed  Elizabeth in a situation diametrically opposite; and had raised her to  be the glory, the bulwark, and the support of the numerous, though still  persecuted Protestants, throughout Europe. More moderate in her temper  than Philip, she found, with pleasure, that the principles of her sect  required not such extreme severity in her domestic government as was  exercised by that monarch; and having no object but self-preservation,  she united her interests in all foreign negotiations with those who were  every where struggling under oppression, and guarding themselves against  ruin and extermination. The more virtuous sovereign was thus happily  thrown into the more favorable cause; and fortune, in this instance,  concurred with policy and nature.    During the lifetime of Henry II. of France, and of his successor, the  force of these principles was somewhat restrained, though not altogether  overcome, by motives of a superior interest; and the dread of uniting  England with the French monarchy engaged Philip to maintain a good  correspondence with Elizabeth. Yet even during this period he rejected  the garter which she sent him; he refused to ratify the ancient league  between the house of Burgundy and England;[*] he furnished ships to  transport French forces into Scotland; he endeavored to intercept  the earl of Arran, who was hastening to join the malecontents in that  country; and the queen's wisest ministers still regarded his friendship  as hollow and precarious.[**]         * Digges's Complete Ambassador, p. 369. Haynes, p. 585.       Strype vol. iv. No. 246.         ** Haynes, vol. i. p. 280, 281, 283, 284.    But no sooner did the death of Francis II. put an end to Philip's  apprehensions with regard to Mary's succession, than his animosity  against Elizabeth began more openly to appear; and the interests of  Spain and those of England were found opposite in every negotiation and  transaction.    The two great monarchies of the continent, France and Spain, being  possessed of nearly equal force, were naturally antagonists; and  England, from its power and situation, was entitled to support its own  dignity, as well as tranquillity, by holding the balance between them.  Whatever incident, therefore, tended too much to depress one of these  rival powers, as it left the other without control, might be deemed  contrary to the interests of England; yet so much were these great  maxims of policy overruled, during that age, by the disputes of  theology, that Philip found an advantage in supporting the established  government and religion of France, and Elizabeth in protecting faction  and innovation.    The queen regent of France, when reinstated in authority by the death  of her son Francis, had formed a plan of administration more subtle than  judicious; and balancing the Catholics with the Hugonots, the duke  of Guise with the prince of Conde, she endeavored to render herself  necessary to both, and to establish her own dominion on their  constrained obedience.[*] But the equal counterpoise of power, which,  among foreign nations, is the source of tranquillity, proves always the  ground of quarrel between domestic factions; and if the animosity of  religion concur with the frequent occasions which present themselves  of mutual injury, it is impossible during any time, to preserve a firm  concord in so delicate a situation. The constable Montmorency, moved  by zeal for the ancient faith, joined himself to the duke of Guise: the  king of Navarre, from his inconstant temper, and his jealousy of the  superior genius of his brother, embraced the same party: and Catharine,  finding herself depressed by this combination, had recourse to Conde  and the Hugonots, who gladly embraced the opportunity of fortifying  themselves by her countenance and protection.[**]         * Davila, lib. ii.         ** Davila, lib. iii    An edict had been published, granting a toleration to the Protestants;  but the interested violence of the duke of Guise, covered with the  pretence of religious zeal, broke through this agreement; and the two  parties, after the fallacious tranquillity of a moment, renewed their  mutual insults and injuries. Conde, Coligny, Andelot assembled their  friends and flew to arms: Guise and Montmorency got possession of the  king's person, and constrained the queen regent to embrace their party:  fourteen armies were levied and put in motion in different parts of  France;[*] each province, each city, each family, was agitated with  intestine rage and animosity. The father was divided against the  son; brother against brother; and women themselves, sacrificing their  humanity as well as their timidity to the religious fury, distinguished  themselves by acts of ferocity and valor.[**] Wherever the Hugonots  prevailed, the images were broken, the altars pillaged, the churches  demolished, the monasteries consumed with fire: where success attended  the Catholics, they burned the Bibles, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19215"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part E. (#13)"],[1,"not even intrusted his purpose to any one;  that the resolution proceeded only from himself, and the impulse of  his own conscience; and that his motives would appear, if his hat were  found; for that, believing he should perish in the attempt, he had there  taken care to explain them.[*]    When the king was informed of this assassination, he received the  news in public with an unmoved and undisturbed countenance; and the  courtiers, who studied his looks, concluded, that secretly he was  not displeased to be rid of a minister so generally odious to the  nation.[**]         * Clarendon, vol. i. p. 27, 20.         ** Warwick, p. 34.    But Charles's command of himself proceeded entirely from the gravity and  composure of his temper. He was still as much as ever attached to  his favorite; and during his whole life he retained an affection for  Buckingham's friends, and a prejudice against his enemies. He urged too,  that Felton should be put to the question, in order to extort from him a  discovery of his accomplices; but the judges declared, that though that  practice had formerly been very usual, it was altogether illegal: so  much reasoners, with regard to law, had they become from the jealous  scruples of the house of commons.    Meanwhile the distress of Rochelle had risen to the utmost extremity.  That vast genius of Richelieu, which made him form the greatest  enterprises, led him to attempt their execution by means equally great  and extraordinary. In order to deprive Rochelle of all succor, he had  dared to project the throwing across the harbor a mole of a mile's  extent in that boisterous ocean; and having executed his project, he now  held the town closely blockaded on all sides. The inhabitants, though  pressed with the greatest rigors of famine, still refused to submit;  being supported, partly by the lectures of their zealous preachers,  partly by the daily hopes of relief from England. After Buckingham's  death, the command of the fleet and army was conferred on the earl of  Lindesey; who, arriving before Rochelle, made some attempts to break  through the mole, and force his way into the harbor: but by the delays  of the English, that work was now fully finished and fortified; and  the Rochellers, finding their last hopes to fail them, were reduced  to surrender at discretion, even in sight of the English admiral.  Of fifteen thousand persons shut up in the city, four thousand alone  survived the fatigues and famine which they had undergone.[*]         * Rushworth, vol. 1. p. 636.    This was the first necessary step towards the prosperity of France.  Foreign enemies, as well as domestic factions, being deprived of this  resource, that kingdom began now to shine forth in its full splendor. By  a steady prosecution of wise plans, both of war and policy, it gradually  gained an ascendant over the rival power of Spain; and every order of  the state, and every sect, were reduced to pay submission to the lawful  authority of the sovereign. The victory, however, over the Hugonots, was  at first pushed by the French king with great moderation. A toleration  was still continued to them; the only avowed and open toleration which  at that time was granted in any European kingdom.    {1629.} The failure of an enterprise in which the English nation,  from religious sympathy, so much interested themselves, could not but  diminish the king's authority in the parliament during the approaching  session: but the commons, when assembled, found many other causes of  complaint. Buckingham's conduct and character with some had afforded a  reason, with others a pretence, for discontent against public measures  but after his death there wanted not new reasons and new pretences for  general dissatisfaction. Manwaring's pardon and promotion were taken  notice of: Sibthorpe and Cosins, two clergymen, who, for like reasons,  were no less obnoxious to the commons, had met with like favor from  the king: Montague, who had been censured for moderation towards  the Catholics, the greatest of crimes, had been created bishop of  Chichester. They found likewise, upon inquiry, that all the copies of  the petition of right which were dispersed, had, by the king's orders,  annexed to them the first answer, which had given so little satisfaction  to the commons;[*] an expedient by which Charles endeavored to persuade  the people that he had nowise receded from his former claims and  pretensions, particularly with regard to the levying of tonnage and  poundage. Selden also complained in the house, that one Savage, contrary  to the petition of right, had been punished with the loss of his ears,  by a discretionary or arbitrary sentence of the star chamber:[**] so apt  were they, on their part, to stretch the petition into such consequences  as might deprive the crown of powers which, from immemorial custom, were  supposed inherent in it.    But the great article on which the house of commons broke with the king,  and which finally created in Charles a disgust to all parliaments,  was their claim with regard to tonnage and poundage. On this occasion,  therefore, it is necessary to give an account of the controversy.    The duty of tonnage and poundage, in more ancient times, had been  commonly a temporary grant of parliament; but it had been conferred  on Henry V., and all the succeeding princes, during life, in order to  enable them to maintain a naval force for the defence of the kingdom.  The necessity of levying this duty had been so apparent, that each king  had ever claimed it from the moment of his accession; and the first  parliament of each reign had usually by vote conferred on the prince  what they found him already in possession of. Agreeably to the  inaccurate genius of the old constitution, this abuse, however  considerable, had never been perceived nor remedied; though nothing  could have been easier than for the parliament to have prevented  it.[***]         * State Trials, vol. vii. p. 216. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 643.         ** State Trials, vol. vii. p. 216. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p.       246.         *** Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 339, 343.    By granting this duty to each prince during his own life, and for a  year after his demise to the successor, all inconveniencies had been  obviated; and yet the duty had never for a moment been levied without  proper authority. But contrivances of that nature were not thought of  during those rude ages; and as so complicated and jealous a government  as the English cannot subsist without many such refinements, it is easy  to see how favorable every inaccuracy must formerly have proved to  royal authority, which, on all emergencies, was obliged to supply, by  discretionary power, the great deficiency of the laws.    The parliament did not grant the duty of tonnage and poundage to Henry  VIII. till the sixth of his reign: yet this prince, who had not then  raised his power to its greatest height, continued during that whole  time to levy the imposition; the parliament, in their very grant, blame  the merchants who had neglected to make payment to the crown; and though  one expression of that bill may seem ambiguous, they employ the plainest  terms in calling tonnage and poundage the king's due, even before that  duty was conferred on him by parliamentary authority.[*] Four reigns,  and above a whole century, had since elapsed; and this revenue had  still been levied before it was voted by parliament: so long had the  inaccuracy continued, without being remarked or corrected.    During that short interval which passed between Charles's accession and  his first parliament, he had followed the example of his predecessors;  and no fault was found with his conduct in this particular. But what was  most remarkable in the proceedings of that house of commons, and what  proved beyond controversy that they had seriously formed a plan for  reducing their prince to subjection, was, that instead of granting this  supply during the king's lifetime, as it had been enjoyed by all his  immediate predecessors, they voted it only for a year; and, after that  should be elapsed, reserved to themselves the power of renewing or  refusing the same concession.[**] But the house of peers, who saw that  this duty was now become more necessary than ever to supply the growing  necessities of the crown, and who did not approve of this encroaching  spirit in the commons, rejected the bill; and the dissolution of that  parliament followed so soon after, that no attempt seems to have been  made for obtaining tonnage and poundage in any other form.[***] [3]         * 6 Henry VIII. cap. 14.         ** Journ. 5th July, 1625.         *** See note C, at the end of the volume.    Charles, meanwhile, continued still to levy this duty by his own  authority, and the nation was so accustomed to that exertion of royal  power, that no scruple was at first entertained of submitting to it. But  the succeeding parliament excited doubts in every one. The commons  took there some steps towards declaring it illegal to levy tonnage and  poundage without consent of parliament; and they openly showed their  intention of employing this engine, in order to extort from the crown  concessions of the most important nature. But Charles was not yet  sufficiently tamed to compliance; and the abrupt dissolution of that  parliament, as above related, put an end, for the time, to their further  pretensions.    The following interval between the second and third parliament, was  distinguished by so many exertions of prerogative, that men had little  leisure to attend to the affair of tonnage and poundage, where the abuse  of power in the crown might seem to be of a more disputable nature. But  after the commons, during the precedent session, had remedied all these  grievances by means of their petition of right, which they deemed  so necessary, they afterwards proceeded to take the matter into  consideration, and they showed the same"]]]
