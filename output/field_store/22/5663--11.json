What is meant by the term \"equal temperament\"?        2. What is meant by the term \"unequal temperament\"?        3. Webster defines the term \"temperament\" thus: \"A system of      compromises in the tuning of pianofortes, organs, etc.\" Explain      fully what these compromises are.        4. In testing chords to ascertain if temperament is correct, what      is the main thing to listen for as a guide?        5. In what three chords would you try the tone A, in testing your      temperament?        6. With what results have you demonstrated the experiments in this      and the previous lesson?          LESSON XI.    ~THE TECHNIQUE OR MODUS OPERANDI OF PIANO TUNING.~      At this juncture, it is thought prudent to defer the discussion of  scale building and detail some of the requirements connected with the  technical operations of tuning. We do this here because some students  are, at this stage, beginning to tune and unless instructed in these  things will take hold of the work in an unfavorable way and, perhaps,  form habits that will be hard to break. Especially is this so in the  matter of setting the mutes or wedges. As to our discussion of scale  building, we shall take that up again, that you may be more thoroughly  informed on that subject.    Some mechanics do more work in a given time than others, do it as well  or better, and with less exertion. This is because they have method or  system in their work so that there are no movements lost. Every  motion is made to count for the advancement of the cause. Others go  about things in a reckless way, taking no thought as to time and  labor-saving methods.    In spite of any instruction that can be given, the beginner in piano  tuning will not be able to take hold of his work with the ease and the  grace of the veteran, nor will he ever be able to work with great  accuracy and expedition unless he has a systematic method of doing the  various things incident to his profession.    In this lesson, as its subject implies, we endeavor to tell you just  how to begin and the way to proceed, step by step, through the work,  to obtain the best results in the shortest time, with the greatest  ease and the least confusion.      MANIPULATION OF THE TUNING HAMMER.    It may seem that the tightening of a string by turning a pin, around  which it is wound, by the aid of an instrument fitting its square end,  is such a simple operation that it should require no skill. Simply  tightening a string in this manner is, to be sure, a simple matter;  but there is a definite degree of tension at which the _vibrating  section_ of the string must be left, and it should be left in such a  condition that the tension will remain invariable, or as near so as is  possible. The only means given the tuner by which he is to bring about  this condition are his tuning hammer and the key of the piano, with  its mechanism, whereby he may strike the string he is tuning.    The purpose of the tuning hammer is that of altering the tension. The  purpose of striking the string by means of the key is twofold: first,  to ascertain the pitch of the string, and second, to equalize the  tension of the string over its entire length. Consider the string in  its three sections, viz.: lower dead end (from hitch pin to lower  bridge), vibrating section (section between the bridges), and upper  dead end (from upper bridge to tuning pin).    When placing the hammer on the tuning pin and turning to the right, it  is evident that the increased tension will be manifest first in the  upper dead end. In pianos having agraffes or upper bridges with a  tightly screwed bearing bar which makes the strings draw very hard  through the bridge, some considerable tension may be produced in the  upper dead end before the string will draw through the bridge and  increase the tension in the vibrating middle. In other pianos the  strings \"render\" very easily over the upper bridge, and the slightest  turn of the hammer manifests an alteration of pitch in the vibrating  section. As a rule, strings \"render\" much more easily through the  upper, than the lower bridge. There are two reasons for this: One is,  that the construction of the lower bridge is such as to cause a  tendency in this direction, having two bridge-pins which stand out of  line with the string and bear against it in opposite directions; the  other is that the lower bridge is so much farther from the point where  the hammer strikes the string that its vibration does not help it  through as it does at the upper bridge.    Now, the thing desired is to have the tension equally distributed over  the entire length of the string. Tension should be the same in the  three different sections. This is of paramount importance. If this  condition does not obtain, the piano will not stand in tune. Yet, this  is not the only item of importance. The tuning pin must be properly  \"set,\" as tuners term it.    By \"setting the pins,\" we mean, leaving it so balanced with respect to  the pull of the string that it will neither yield to the pull of the  string nor tend to draw it tighter. Coming now to the exact  manipulation of the tuning hammer, there are some important items to  consider.[F] Now, if the tuning hammer is placed upon the tuning pin  with the handle straight upward, and it is pulled backward (from the  tuner) just a little, before it is turned to the right, the tension  will be increased somewhat before the pin is turned, as this motion,  slight as it may seem, pulls the pin upward enough to draw the string  through the upper bridge an infinitesimally small distance, but enough  to be perceptible to the ear. Now if the hammer were removed, the  tendency of the pin would be to yield to the pull of the string; but  if the pin is turned enough to take up such amount of string as was  pulled through the bridge, and, as it is turned, is allowed to yield  downward toward the pull of the string, it will resume its balance and  the string will stand at that pitch, provided it has been \"rendered\"  properly over the bridges.        [F] Bear in mind, the foregoing and following instructions are      written with reference to the upright piano. The square does not      permit the observance of these suggestions so favorably as the      upright.    We set forth these details that you may have a thorough understanding  of what is meant by setting the pins, and while it is not always  advisable to follow this method in tuning, there are some pianos that  will stand more satisfactorily when treated in this way. This method  is recommended where the string has become rusty at the upper bridge,  as it is loosened at the bridge before it is started to wind around  the pin which prevents it breaking at that point. We believe that  ninety per cent. of strings break right where they start around tuning  pin. A very good way to draw a string up is to give the hammer an  alternate up and down motion, pulling the handle lightly to you, then  from you, as you draw it up; not enough to bend or break the pin or to  crush the wood around the pin, but just enough to make the string take  on its increased tension equally.    In regard to the lower bridge, the strings will rarely \"render\"  through them properly unless brought to a tension a little higher than  it is desired they shall be left. If this is done, a few sharp blows  of key will generally make them equalize all right; then press the  hammer gently to the left, not enough to turn the pin in the socket,  but to settle it back to a well-balanced position. After a little  practice the tuner can generally guess precisely how much  over-tension to allow. If the pin is left slightly sprung downward,  its tendency will be to spring upward, thereby sharpening the string;  so be careful to leave the pins in perfect balance, or as tuners say,  \"properly set.\"    The foregoing, while applicable to the whole scale, is not so urgent  in the over-strung bass. The strings are so heavy and the tension is  so great that they will generally \"render\" quite freely over the  bridges, and it is only necessary to bring them up to pitch, handling  the hammer in such a manner as to leave the pins well balanced; but it  is not necessary to give them over-tension and beat them down again;  in fact it is not advisable, as a rule. At all times, place the hammer  on the pin as far as it will go, and strike the key while drawing a  string up.    In tuning the square piano, it is not possible to set the hammer upon  the pin with the handle in line with, and beyond the string, as is the  rule in the upright. Where the square has the square pin, the hammer  (with star head) can always be set with the handle to the right of the  string somewhat, but usually almost in line with the string and almost  directly over it, and the manipulation of the hammer is much the  same, though the tuner is at a greater disadvantage, the pins being  farther from him and he has not such a good rest for his hand. Many  old squares have the oblong pin. In this case, use the double hammer  head. On the one side the hole in the head is made with the longer  diameter in line with the handle, and on the other side the hole is  made with the longer diameter at right angles with the handle; so that  if you cannot get a favorable position with one end you can with the  other.    We have said nothing about which hand to use in striking the keys and  in wielding the hammer, but it is customary to handle the hammer with  the right hand and it is always advisable for two very good reasons:  It gives the tuner a much more favorable position at the instrument;  and, as the right hand is more used in ordinary every-day operations  and is more trained in applying degrees of force and guiding tools, it  is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17575"],[0,"How to Camp Out (#13)"],[1,"   In general, however, it will be noticed that those who camp out for the  season, or go on walking-tours, do so at a moderate expense because  they start with the determination to make it cheap. For this purpose  they content themselves with old clothes, which they fit over or repair,  take cooking-utensils from their own kitchen, and, excepting in the  matter of canned foods, do not live very differently from what they do  at home.    Nearly all the parties of boys that I have questioned spend all the  money they have, be it little or much. Generally those I have met  walking or camping seem to be impressed with the magnitude of their  operations, and to be carrying constantly with them the determination to  spend their funds sparingly enough to reach home without begging. It is  not bad practice for a young man.    Here I wish to say a word to parents--having been a boy myself, and  being now a father. Let your boys go when summer comes; put them to  their wits; do not let them be extravagant, nor have money to pay other  men for working for them. It is far better for them to move about than  to remain in one place all the time. The last, especially if the camp is  near some place of public resort, tends to encourage idleness and  dissipation.    When you return home again from a tour of camping, and go back to a  sedentary life, remember that you do not need to eat all that your  appetite calls for. You may make yourself sick if you go on eating such  meals as you have been digesting in camp. You are apt also upon your  return to feel as you did on the first and second days of your tour;  this is especially liable to be the case if you have overworked  yourself, or have not had enough sleep.    FOOTNOTES:    [23] A flannel dress, the skirt coming to the top of the boots, and  having a blouse waist, will be found most comfortable.    [24] It is no novelty for women and children to camp out: we see them  every summer at the seaside and on the blueberry-plains. A great many  families besides live in rude cabins, which are preferable on many  accounts, but are expensive. Sickness sometimes results, but usually all  are much benefited. I know a family that numbered with its guests nine  ladies, five children (\"one at the breast\"), and the _paterfamilias_,  which camped several weeks through some of the best and some of the  worst of weather. The whooping-cough broke out the second or third day;  shortly after, the tent of the mother and children blew down in the  night, and turned them all out into the pelting rain in their  night-clothes. Excepting the misery of that night and day, nothing  serious came of it; and in the fall all returned home better every way  for having spent their summer in camp.

CHAPTER XI.    DIARY.      By all means keep a diary: the act of writing will help you to remember  these good times, and the diary will prove the pleasantest of reading in  after-years. It is not an easy thing to write in camp or on the march,  but if it costs you an effort you will prize it all the more. I beg you  to persevere, and, if you fail, to \"try, try again.\" I cannot overcome  the desire to tell you the results of my experience in diary-writing;  for I have tried it long, and under many different circumstances. They  are as follows:--    First, Any thing written at the time is far better than no record at  all; so, if you can only write a pocket diary with lead pencil, do that.    Second, All such small diaries, scraps, letters, and every thing written  illegibly or with lead pencil, are difficult to preserve or to read, and  are very unhandy for reference.    Third, It is great folly to persuade yourself that after taking notes  for a week or two, or writing a hurried sketch, you can extend or copy  and illuminate at your leisure.    Consequently, write what you can, and let it stand with all its blots,  errors, and nonsense. And be careful, when you are five years older, not  to go through the diary with eraser and scissors; for, if you live still  another five years, nothing will interest you more than this diary with  all its defects.    I find after having written many diaries of many forms, that I have now  to regret I did not at first choose some particular size, say  \"letter-size,\" and so have had all my diaries uniform. I will never  again use \"onion-skin,\" which is too thin, nor any odd-shaped, figured,  cheap, or colored paper. I do not like those large printed diaries which  give you just a page or half-page a day, nor a paper whose ruling shows  conspicuously.    I like best when at home to write in a blank book; and when I go off on  a summer vacation I leave that diary safely at home, and take a  portfolio with some sheets of blank paper upon which to write the diary,  and mail them as fast as written. These answer for letters to the  friends at home, and save writing any more to them. They also, when  bound, form a diary exclusively of travels. When I return I write an  epitome in the home-diary, and thus prevent a break of dates in that  book. The paper for the diary of travels is strong, but rather thin and  white. I buy enough of it at once to make a volume, and thus have the  diary sheets uniform.    I am quite sure that you will do well to write a diary of your summer  vacation, upon the plan just named, whether you keep one at home or not.  Try to do it well, but do not undertake too much. Write facts such as  what you saw, heard, did, and failed to do; but do not try to write  poetry or fine writing of any kind. Mention what kind of weather; but do  not attempt a meteorological record unless you have a special liking for  that science. If you camp in Jacob Sawyer's pasture, and he gives you a  quart of milk, say so, instead of \"a good old man showed us a favor;\"  for in after-years the memory of it will be sweeter than the milk was,  and it will puzzle you to recall the \"good old man's\" name and what the  favor was. If you have time, try to draw: never mind if it is a poor  picture. I have some of the strangest-looking portraits and most  surprising perspectives in my diaries written when fifteen to twenty  years old; but I would not exchange them now for one of the \"old  masters.\" Do not neglect the narrative, however, for sake of drawing.    I have noticed that when my paper is down in the bottom of a valise, and  the pen in a wallet, and the penholder in a coat-pocket, and portfolio  somewhere else, it is not so easy to \"find time to write\" as when I have  penholder, pen, and paper in the portfolio, and the portfolio and ink in  my haversack. Under these favorable conditions it is easy to snatch a  few moments from any halt; and a diary written on the spur of the moment  is a diary that will be worth reading in after-life. If it is  impossible, however, as it so often is, to write oftener than once a  day, you will do well to make a note of events as fast as they happen,  so that you shall not forget them, nor have to stop to recall them when  your time is precious.    I have heard of diaries with side-notes on each page, and even an index  at the end of the book; but not many men, and but few boys, can do all  this; and my advice to the average boy is, not to undertake it, nor any  thing else that will use the time, patience, and perseverance, needed to  write the narrative.    You will find it convenient for reference if you make a paragraph of  every subject. Date every day distinctly, with a much bolder handwriting  than the body of the diary; and write the date on the right margin of  the right page, and left margin of the left page, with the year at the  top of the page only. Skip a line or two instead of ruling between the  days.
