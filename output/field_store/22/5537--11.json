Your silence seems to say that you  are. Your silence encourages a continuance of this sort of horror. Only by  earnest, active, united endeavor to arouse public sentiment can we hope to  put a stop to these demonstrations of American barbarism.      +LYNCHING RECORD+    The following table of lynchings has been kept year by year by the Chicago  Tribune, beginning with 1882, and shows the list of Negroes that have been  lynched during that time:    1882, Negroes murdered by mobs       52  1883, Negroes murdered by mobs       39  1884, Negroes murdered by mobs       53  1885, Negroes murdered by mobs      164  1886, Negroes murdered by mobs      136  1887, Negroes murdered by mobs      128  1888, Negroes murdered by mobs      143  1889, Negroes murdered by mobs      127  1890, Negroes murdered by mobs      171  1891, Negroes murdered by mobs      192  1892, Negroes murdered by mobs      241  1893, Negroes murdered by mobs      200  1894, Negroes murdered by mobs      190  1895, Negroes murdered by mobs      171  1896, Negroes murdered by mobs      131  1897, Negroes murdered by mobs      156  1898, Negroes murdered by mobs      127  1899, Negroes murdered by mobs      107    Of these thousands of men and women who have been put to death without  judge or jury, less than one-third of them have been even accused of  criminal assault. The world at large has accepted unquestionably the  statement that Negroes are lynched only for assaults upon white women. Of  those who were lynched from 1882 to 1891, the first ten years of the  tabulated lynching record, the charges are as follows:    Two hundred and sixty-nine were charged with rape; 253 with murder; 44  with robbery; 37 with incendiarism; 4 with burglary; 27 with race  prejudice; 13 quarreled with white men; 10 with making threats; 7 with  rioting; 5 with miscegenation; in 32 cases no reasons were given, the  victims were lynched on general principles.    During the past five years the record is as follows:    Of the 171 persons lynched in 1895 only 34 were charged with this crime.  In 1896, out of 131 persons who were lynched, only 34 were said to have  assaulted women. Of the 156 in 1897, only 32. In 1898, out of 127 persons  lynched, 24 were charged with the alleged \"usual crime.\" In 1899, of the  107 lynchings, 16 were said to be for crimes against women. These figures,  of course, speak for themselves, and to the unprejudiced, fair-minded  person it is only necessary to read and study them in order to show that  the charge that the Negro is a moral outlaw is a false one, made for the  purpose of injuring the Negro's good name and to create public sentiment  against him.    If public sentiment were alive, as it should be upon the subject, it would  refuse to be longer hoodwinked, and the voice of conscience would refuse  to be stilled by these false statements. If the laws of the country were  obeyed and respected by the white men of the country who charge that the  Negro has no respect for law, these things could not be, for every  individual, no matter what the charge, would have a fair trial and an  opportunity to prove his guilt or innocence before a tribunal of law.    That is all the Negro asks--that is all the friends of law and order need  to ask, for once the law of the land is supreme, no individual who commits  crime will escape punishment.    Individual Negroes commit crimes the same as do white men, but that the  Negro race is peculiarly given to assault upon women, is a falsehood of  the deepest dye. The tables given above show that the Negro who is saucy  to white men is lynched as well as the Negro who is charged with assault  upon women. Less than one-sixth of the lynchings last year, 1899, were  charged with rape.    The Negro points to his record during the war in rebuttal of this false  slander. When the white women and children of the South had no protector  save only these Negroes, not one instance is known where the trust was  betrayed. It is remarkably strange that the Negro had more respect for  womanhood with the white men of the South hundreds of miles away, than  they have today, when surrounded by those who take their lives with  impunity and burn and torture, even worse than the \"unspeakable Turk.\"    Again, the white women of the North came South years ago, threaded the  forests, visited the cabins, taught the schools and associated only with  the Negroes whom they came to teach, and had no protectors near at hand.  They had no charge or complaint to make of the danger to themselves after  association with this class of human beings. Not once has the country been  shocked by such recitals from them as come from the women who are  surrounded by their husbands, brothers, lovers and friends. If the Negro's  nature is bestial, it certainly should have proved itself in one of these  two instances. The Negro asks only justice and an impartial consideration  of these facts."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14977"],[0,"The Red Record (#13)"],[1,"body to Germantown for $3.      When within half-a-mile of Germantown the Sheriff and posse were    overtaken by Squire McDonald of Collierville, who had come down to hold    the inquest. The Squire had his jury with him, and it was agreed for the    convenience of all parties that he should proceed with the corpse to    Germantown and conduct the inquiry as to the cause of death. He did so,    and a verdict of death from hanging by parties unknown was returned in    due form.      The execution of Neal was done deliberately and by the best people of    the Collierville, Germantown and Forest Hill neighborhoods, without    passion or exhibition of anger.      He was arrested on Friday about ten o'clock, by Constable Bob Cash, who    carried him before Mrs. White. She said: \"I think he is the man. I am    almost certain of it. If he isn't the man he is exactly like him.\"      The Negro's coat was torn also, and there were other circumstances    against him. The committee returned and made its report, and the    chairman put the question of guilt or innocence to a vote.      All who thought the proof strong enough to warrant execution were    invited to cross over to the other side of the road. Everybody but four    or five negroes crossed over.      The committee then placed Neal on a mule with his arms tied behind him,    and proceeded to the scene of the crime, followed by the mob. The rope,    with a noose already prepared, was tied to the limb nearest the spot    where the unpardonable sin was committed, and the doomed man's mule was    brought to a standstill beneath it.      Then Neal confessed. He said he was the right man, but denied that he    used force or threats to accomplish his purpose. It was a matter of    purchase, he claimed, and said the price paid was twenty-five cents. He    warned the colored men present to beware of white women and resist    temptation, for to yield to their blandishments or to the passions of    men, meant death.      While he was speaking, Mrs. White came from her home and calling    Constable Cash to one side, asked if he could not save the Negro's life.    The reply was, \"No,\" and Mrs. White returned to the house.      When all was in readiness, the husband of Neal's victim leaped upon the    mule's back and adjusted the rope around the Negro's neck. No cap was    used, and Neal showed no fear, nor did he beg for mercy. The mule was    struck with a whip and bounded out from under Neal, leaving him    suspended in the air with his feet about three feet from the ground.      DELIVERED TO THE MOB BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE    John Peterson, near Denmark, S.C., was suspected of rape, but escaped,  went to Columbia, and placed himself under Gov. Tillman's protection,  declaring he too could prove an alibi by white witnesses. A white reporter  hearing his declaration volunteered to find these witnesses, and  telegraphed the governor that he would be in Columbia with them on Monday.  In the meantime the mob at Denmark, learning Peterson's whereabouts, went  to the governor and demanded the prisoner. Gov. Tillman, who had during  his canvass for reelection the year before, declared that he would lead a  mob to lynch a Negro that assaulted a white woman, gave Peterson up to the  mob. He was taken back to Denmark, and the white girl in the case as  positively declared that he was not the man. But the verdict of the mob  was that \"the crime had been committed and somebody had to hang for it,  and if he, Peterson, was not guilty of that he was of some other crime,\"  and he was hung, and his body riddled with 1,000 bullets.      LYNCHED AS A WARNING    Alabama furnishes a case in point. A colored man named Daniel Edwards,  lived near Selma, Alabama, and worked for a family of a farmer near that  place. This resulted in an intimacy between the young man and a daughter  of the householder, which finally developed in the disgrace of the girl.  After the birth of the child, the mother disclosed the fact that Edwards  was its father. The relationship had been sustained for more than a year,  and yet this colored man was apprehended, thrown into jail from whence he  was taken by a mob of one hundred neighbors and hung to a tree and his  body riddled with bullets. A dispatch which describes the lynching, ends  as follows. \"Upon his back was found pinned this morning the following:  'Warning to all Negroes that are too intimate with white girls. This the  work of one hundred best citizens of the South Side.'\"    There can be no doubt from the announcement made by this \"one hundred best  citizens\" that they understood full well the character of the relationship  which existed between Edwards and the girl, but when the dispatches were  sent out, describing the affair, it was claimed that Edwards was lynched  for rape.      SUPPRESSING THE TRUTH    In a county in Mississippi during the month of July the Associated Press  dispatches sent out a report that the sheriff's eight-year-old daughter  had been assaulted by a big, black, burly brute who had been promptly  lynched. The facts which have since been investigated show that the girl  was more than eighteen years old and that she was discovered by her father  in this young man's room who was a servant on the place. But these facts  the Associated Press has not given to the world, nor did the same agency  acquaint the world with the fact that a Negro youth who was lynched in  Tuscumbia, Ala., the same year on the same charge told the white girl who  accused him before the mob, that he had met her in the woods often by  appointment. There is a young mulatto in one of the State prisons of the  South today who is there by charge of a young white woman to screen  herself. He is a college graduate and had been corresponding with, and  clandestinely visiting her until he was surprised and run out of her room  en deshabille by her father. He was put in prison in another town to save  his life from the mob and his lawyer advised that it were better to save  his life by pleading guilty to charges made and being sentenced for years,  than to attempt a defense by exhibiting the letters written him by this  girl. In the latter event, the mob would surely murder him, while there  was a chance for his life by adopting the former course. Names, places and  dates are not given for the same reason.    The excuse has come to be so safe, it is not surprising that a  Philadelphia girl, beautiful and well educated, and of good family, should  make a confession published in all the daily papers of that city October,  1894, that she had been stealing for some time, and that to cover one of  her thefts, she had said she had been bound and gagged in her father's  house by a colored man, and money stolen therefrom by him. Had this been  done in many localities, it would only have been necessary for her to  \"identify\" the first Negro in that vicinity, to have brought about another  lynching bee.      A VILE SLANDER WITH SCANT RETRACTION    The following published in the _Cleveland (Ohio) Leader_ of Oct. 23, 1894,  only emphasizes our demand that a fair trial shall be given those accused  of crime, and the protection of the law be extended until time for a  defense be granted.      The sensational story sent out last night from Hicksville that a Negro    had outraged a little four-year-old girl proves to be a base canard. The    correspondents who went into the details should have taken the pains to    investigate, and the officials should have known more of the matter    before they gave out such grossly exaggerated information.      The Negro, Charles O'Neil, had been working for a couple of women and,    it seems, had worked all winter without being remunerated. There is a    little girl, and the girl's mother and grandmother evidently started the    story with idea of frightening the Negro out of the country and thus    balancing accounts. The town was considerably wrought up and for a time    things looked serious. The accused had a preliminary hearing today and    not an iota of evidence was produced to indicate that such a crime had    been committed, or that he had even attempted such an outrage. The    village marshal was frightened nearly out of his wits and did little to    quiet the excitement last night.      The affair was an outrage on the Negro, at the expense of innocent    childhood, a brainless fabrication from start to finish.    The original story was sent throughout this country and England, but the  _Cleveland Leader_, so far as known, is the only journal which has  published these facts in refutation of the slander so often published  against the race. Not only is it true that many of the alleged cases of  rape against the Negro, are like the foregoing, but the same crime  committed by white men against Negro women and girls, is never punished by  mob or the law. A leading journal in South Carolina openly said some  months ago that \"it is not the same thing for a white man to assault a  colored woman as for a colored man to assault a white woman, because the  colored woman had no finer feelings nor virtue to be outraged!\" Yet  colored women have always had far more reason to complain of white men in  this respect than ever white women have had of Negroes.      ILLINOIS HAS A LYNCHING    In the month of June, 1893, the proud commonwealth of Illinois joined the  ranks of Lynching States. Illinois, which gave to the world the immortal  heroes, Lincoln, Grant and Logan, trailed its banner of justice in the  dust--dyed its hands red in the blood of a man not proven guilty of crime.    June 3,1893, the country about Decatur, one of the largest cities of the  state was startled with the cry that a white woman had been assaulted by a  colored tramp. Three days later a colored man named Samuel Bush was  arrested and put in jail. A white man testified that Bush, on the day of  the assault, asked him where he could get a drink and he pointed to the "]]]
