(#13)"],[1," States, as well as influential  Germans in the neutral European countries, sent out peace \"feelers.\"  Von Jagow realised that the sooner peace was made, the better it would  be for Germany and the easier it would be for the Foreign Office to  defeat the military party at home.  He saw that the more victories the  army had and the more victories it could announce to the people the  more lustful the General Staff would be for a war of exhaustion.  Army  leaders have always had more confidence in their ability to defeat the  world than the Foreign Office.  The army looked at the map of Europe  and saw so many hundred thousand square miles of territory under  occupation.  The Foreign Office saw Germany in its relation to the  world.  Von Jagow knew that every new square mile of territory gained  was being paid for, not only by the cost of German blood, but by the  more terrible cost of public opinion and German influence abroad.  But  Germany was under martial law and the Foreign Office had nothing to say  about military plans.  The Foreign Office also had little to say about  naval warfare.  The Navy was building submarines as fast as it could  and the number of ships lost encouraged the people to believe that the  more intensified the submarine war became, the quicker the war would  end in Germany's favour.  So the Navy kept sinking ships and relying  upon the Foreign Office to make excuses and keep America out of the war.    The repeated violations of the pledges made by the Foreign Office to  the United States aroused American public opinion to white heat, and  justly so, because the people here did not understand that the real  submarine crisis was not between President Wilson and Berlin but  between Admiral von Tirpitz and Secretary von Jagow and their  followers.  President Wilson was at the limit of his patience with  Germany and the German people, who were becoming impatient over the  long drawn out proceedings, began to accept the inspired thinking of  the Navy and to believe that Wilson was working for the defeat of  Germany by interfering with submarine activities.    On February 22nd, 1916, in one of my despatches I said: \"The patient  attitude toward America displayed during the _Lusitania_ negotiations,  it is plain to-day, no longer exists because of the popular feeling  that America has already hindered so many of Germany's plans.\"  At that  time it appeared to observers in Berlin that unless President Wilson  could show more patience than the German Government the next submarine  accident would bring about a break in relations.  Commenting on this  despatch the _Indianapolis News_ the next day said:      \"In this country the people feel that all the patience has been shown  by their government.  We believe that history will sustain that view.  Almost ten months ago more than 100 American citizens were deliberately  done to death by the German Government, for it is understood that the  submarine commander acted under instructions, and that Germany refuses  to disavow on the ground that the murderous act was the act of the  German Government.  Yet, after all this time, the _Lusitania_ case is  still unsettled.  The administration has, with marvellous  self-restraint, recognised that public opinion in Germany was not  normal, and for that reason it has done everything in its power to  smooth the way to a settlement by making it as easy as possible for the  Imperial Government to meet our just demands.  Indeed, the President  has gone so far as to expose himself to severe criticism at home.  We  believe that he would have been sustained if he had, immediately after  the sinking of the _Lusitania_, broken off diplomatic relations.    \"But he has stood out against public opinion in his own country, waited  ten months for an answer, and done everything that he could in honour  due to soften the feeling here.  Yet just on the eve of a settlement  that would have been unsatisfactory to many of our people, Germany  announced the policy that we had condemned as illegal, and that plainly  is illegal.  The trouble in Berlin is an utter inability to see  anything wrong in the attack on the _Lusitania_, or to appreciate the  sense of horror that was stirred in this country by it.  The idea seems  to be that the policy of frightfulness could be extended to the high  seas without in any way shocking the American people.  Nothing has come  from Berlin that indicates any feeling of guilt on the part of the  German people or their Government.    \"In the United States, on the contrary, the act is regarded as one of  the blackest crimes of history.  And yet, in spite of that feeling, we  have waited patiently for ten months in the hope that the German  Government would do justice, and clear its name of reproach.  Yet now  we are told that it is Germany that has shown a 'patient attitude,' the  implication or insinuation being that our long suffering administration  has been unreasonable and impatient.  That will not be the verdict of  history, as it is not the verdict of our own people.  We have made  every allowance for the conditions existing in Germany, and have  resolutely refused to take advantage of her distress.  We doubt whether  there is any other government in the world that would have shown the  patience and moderation, under like provocation, that have been shown  by the American Government in these _Lusitania_ negotiations.\"      I sent the editorial to von Jagow, who returned it the next day with  the brief comment on one of his calling cards: \"With many thanks.\"    About this time Count Reventlow and the other naval writers began to  refer to everything President Wilson did as a \"bluff.\"  When Col. E. M.  House came to Berlin early in 1916, he tried to impress the officials  with the fact that Mr. Wilson was not only not bluffing, but that the  American people would support him in whatever he did in dealing with  the German Government.  Mr. Gerard tried too to impress the Foreign  Office but because he could only deal with that branch of the  Government, he could not change the Navy's impression, which was that  Wilson would never take a definite stand against Germany.  On the 8th  of February, the _London Times_ printed the following despatch which I  had sent to the United States:      \"Mr. Gerard has been accused of not being forceful enough in dealing  with the Berlin Foreign Office.  In Berlin he has been criticised for  just the opposite.  It has been stated frequently that he was too  aggressive.  The Ambassador's position was that he must carry out Mr.  Wilson's ideas.  So he tried for days and weeks to impress officials  with the seriousness of the situation.  At the critical point in the  negotiations various unofficial diplomats began to arrive and they  seriously interfered with negotiations.  One of these was a politician  who through his credentials from Mr. Bryan met many high officials, and  informed them that President Wilson was writing his notes for 'home  consumption.'  Mr. Gerard, however, appealed to Washington to know what  was meant by the moves of this American with authority from Mr. Bryan.  This was the beginning of the reason for Secretary Bryan's resigning.    \"Secretary Bryan had informed also former Ambassador Dumba that the  United States would never take any position against Germany even though  it was hinted so in the _Lusitania_ note.  Dumba telegraphed this to  Vienna and Berlin was informed immediately.  Because of Mr. Gerard's  personal friendship and personal association with Secretary of State  von Jagow and Under Secretary of State Zimmermann, he was acquainted  with Secretary Bryan's move.   He telegraphed to President Wilson and  the result was the resignation of Mr. Bryan.\"    In December, the _Ancona_ was torpedoed and it was officially explained  that the act was that of an Austrian submarine commander.  Wilson's  note to Vienna brought about a near rupture between Austria-Hungary and  Germany because Austria and Hungary at that time were much opposed to  Germany's submarine methods.  Although the submarines operating in the  Mediterranean were flying the Austrian flag, they were German  submarines, and members of the crews were German.  Throughout the life  of the Emperor Franz Josef the Dual Monarchy was ruled, not from  Vienna, but from Budapest by Count Stefan Tisza, the Hungarian Premier.  I was in Budapest at the time and one evening saw Count Tisza at his  palace, which stands on the rocky cliff opposite the main part of  Budapest, and which overlooks the valley of the Danube for many miles.  Tisza, as well as all Hungarians, is pro-American before he is  pro-German.    \"To think of trouble between Austria-Hungary and the United States is  sheer nonsense,\" he said in his quiet but forceful manner.  \"I must  confess, however, that we were greatly surprised to get the American  note.  It is far from our intention to get into any quarrel with  America.  Perhaps I should not say quarrel, because I know it would not  be that, but of course matters do not depend upon us entirely.  There  is no reason for any trouble over the _Ancona_ question.  It must be  settled satisfactorily,\" he said emphatically, \"not only from the  standpoint of the United States, but from our standpoint.\"    The _Ancona_ crisis brought the Foreign Office new and unexpected  support.  Hungary was opposed to a dispute with America.  In the first  place, Hungarians are more of a liberty loving people than the Germans,  and public opinion in Hungary rules the country.  While there is a  strong Government press, which is loyal to the Tisza party, there is an  equally powerful opposition press which follows the leadership of Count  Albert Apponyi and Count Julius Andrassy, the two most popular men in  Hungarian public life.  Apponyi told me on one occasion that while the  Government was controlled by Tisza a great majority of the people sided  with the opposition.  He added that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15777"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, Volume 1 (#13)"],[1,"not think it was at all prudent to  persevere in getting farther to the south; especially as the summer was  already half spent, and it would have taken up some time to have got round  the ice, even supposing it to have been practicable; which, however, is  doubtful. I therefore came to a resolution to proceed directly in search of  the land lately discovered by the French. And, as the winds still continued  at E. by S., I was obliged to return to the north, over some part of the  sea I had already made myself acquainted with, and, for that reason, wished  to have avoided. But this was not to be done, as our course made good, was  little better than north. In the night the wind increased to a strong gale,  attended with sleet and snow, and obliged us to double-reef our top-sails.  About noon the next day the gale abated, so that we could bear all our  reefs out; but the wind still remained in its old quarter.    In the evening, being in the latitude of 64 deg. 12' S., longitude 40 deg. 15' E.,  a bird, called by us in my former voyage Port Egmont Hen, (on account of  the great plenty of them at Port Egmont in Falkland Isles,) came hovering  several times over the ship, and then left us in the direction of N.E. They  are a short thick bird, about the size of a large crow, of a dark-brown or  chocolate colour, with a whitish streak under each wing, in the shape of a  half-moon. I have been told that these birds are found in great plenty at  the Fero Isles, North of Scotland; and that they never go far from land.  Certain it is, I never before saw them above forty leagues off; but I do  not remember ever seeing fewer than two together; whereas here was but one,  which, with the islands of ice, may have come a good way from land.    At nine o'clock, the wind veering to E.N.E., we tacked and stood to the  S.S.E, but at four in the morning of the 20th, it returned back to its old  point, and we resumed our northerly course. One of the above birds was seen  this morning, probably the same we saw the night before, as our situation  was not much altered. As the day advanced, the gale increased, attended  with thick hazy weather, sleet, and snow, and at last obliged us to close-  reef our top-sails, and strike top-gallant-yards. But in the evening the  wind abated so as to admit us to carry whole top-sails, and top-gallant-  yards aloft. Hazy weather, with snow and sleet continued.    In the afternoon of the 21st, being in the latitude of 62 deg. 24' S.,  longitude 42 deg. 19' E., we saw a white albatross with black tipped wings, and  a pintado bird. The wind was now at S. and S.W., a fresh gale. With this we  steered N.E., against a very high sea, which did not indicate the vicinity  of land in that quarter; and yet it was there we were to expect it. The  next day we had intervals of fair weather, the wind was moderate, and we  carried our studding-sails. In the morning of the 23d, we were in  latitude of 60 deg. 27' S., longitude 45 deg. 33' E. Snow showers continued, and  the weather was so cold, that the water in our water-vessels on deck had  been frozen for several preceding nights.    Having clear weather at intervals, I spread the ships a-breast four miles  from each other, in order the better to discover any thing that might lie  in our way. We continued to sail in this manner till six o'clock in the  evening, when hazy weather and snow showers made it necessary for us to  join.    We kept our course to N.E. till eight o'clock in the morning of the 25th,  when the wind having veered round to N.E. by E., by the W. and N. we  tacked, and stood to N.W. The wind was fresh, and yet we made but little  way against a high northerly sea. We now began to see some of that sort of  peterels so well known to sailors by the name of sheerwaters, latitude 58 deg.  10', longitude 50 deg. 54' E. In the afternoon the wind veered to the southward  of east; and at eight o'clock in the evening, it increased to a storm,  attended with thick hazy weather, sleet and snow.    During night we went under our fore-sail and main-top-sail close-reefed: At  day-light the next morning, added to them the fore and mizen top-sails. At  four o'clock it fell calm; but a prodigious high sea from the N.E., and a  complication of the worst of weather, viz. snow, sleet, and rain,  continued, together with the calm, till nine o'clock in the evening. Then  the weather cleared up, and we got a breeze at S.E. by S. With this we  steered N. by E. till eight o'clock the next morning, being the 27th, when  I spread the ships, and steered N.N.E., all sails set, having a fresh  breeze at S. by W., and clear weather.    At noon we were by observation, in the latitude of 56 deg. 28' S., and, about  three o'clock in the afternoon, the sun and moon appearing at intervals,  their distances were observed by the following persons; and the longitude  resulting therefrom was,    By Mr Wales, (the mean of two sets)     50 deg. 59' East.  Lieutenant Clerke                       51  11  Mr Gilbert                              50  14  Mr Smith                                50  50  Mr Kendal's watch                       50  50    At six o'clock in the evening, being in latitude 56 deg. 9' S., I now made  signal to the Adventure to come under my stern; and at eight o'clock the  next morning sent her to look out on my starboard beam, having at this time  a fresh gale at west and pretty clear weather. But this was not of long  duration; for, at two in the afternoon, the sky became cloudy and hazy, the  wind increased to a fresh gale, blew in squalls attended with snow, sleet,  and drizzling rain. I now made signal to the Adventure to come under my  stern, and took another reef in each top-sail. At eight o'clock I hauled up  the main-sail, and run all night under the foresail, and two top-sails; our  course being N.N.E. and N.E. by N., with a strong gale at N.W.    The 29th, at noon, we observed in latitude 52 deg. 29' S., the weather being  fair and tolerably clear. But in the afternoon, it again became very thick  and hazy with rain; and the gale increased in such a manner as to oblige us  to strike top-gallant yards, close-reef and hand the top-sails. We spent  part of the night, which was very dark and stormy, in making a tack to the  S.W., and in the morning of the 30th, stood again to the N.E., wind at N.W.  and N., a very fresh gale; which split several of our small sails. This day  no ice was seen, probably owing to the thick hazy weather. At eight o'clock  in the evening we tacked and stood to the westward, under our courses; but  as the sea run high, we made our course no better than S.S.W.    At four o'clock the next morning, the gale had a little abated; and the  wind had backed to W. by S. We again stood to the northward, under courses  and double-reefed top-sails, having a very high sea from the N.N.W., which  gave us but little hopes of finding the land we were in search of. At noon  we were in the latitude of 50 deg. 56' S., longitude 56 deg. 48' E., and presently  after we saw two islands of ice. One of these we passed very near, and  found that it was breaking or falling to pieces, by the cracking noise it  made; which was equal to the report of a four-pounder. There was a good  deal of loose ice about it; and had the weather been favourable, I should  have brought-to, and taken some up. After passing this, we saw no more,  till we returned again to the south.    1773 February    Hazy gloomy weather continued, and the wind remained invariably fixed at  N.W., so that we could make our course no better than N.E. by N., and this  course we held till four o'clock in the afternoon of the first of February.  Being then in the latitude of 48 deg. 30', and longitude 58 deg. 7' E., nearly in  the meridian of the island of Mauritius, and where we were to expect to  find the land said to be discovered by the French, of which at this time we  saw not the least signs, we bore away east.    I now made the signal to the Adventure to keep at the distance of four  miles on my starboard beam. At half an hour past six, Captain Furneaux made  the signal to speak with me; and upon his coming under my stern, he  informed me that he had just seen a large float of sea or rock weed, and  about it several birds (divers.) These were certainly signs of the vicinity  of land; but whether it lay to the east or west, was not possible for us to  know. My intention was to have got into this latitude four or five degrees  of longitude to the west of the meridian we were in, and then to have  carried on my researches to the east. But the west and north-west winds we  had had the five preceding days, prevented me from putting this in  execution.    The continual high sea we had lately had from the N.E., N., N.W. and W.,  left me no reason to believe that land of any extent lay to the West. We  therefore continued to steer to the east, only lying-to a few hours in the  night, and in the morning resumed our course again, four miles north and  south from each other; the hazy weather not permitting us to spread  farther. We passed two or three small pieces of rock weed, and saw two or  three birds known by the name of egg-birds; but saw no other signs of land.  At noon we observed in latitude 48 deg. 36' S., longitude 59 deg. 35' E. As we  could only see a few miles farther to the south, and as it was not  impossible that there might be land not far off in that direction, I gave  orders to steer S. 1/2 E., and made the signal for the Adventure to follow,  she being by this movement thrown a-stern: The weather continuing hazy till  half an hour past six o'clock in the evening, when it cleared up so as to  enable us to see about five leagues round us.    Being now in the latitude of 49 deg. 13' S., without having the least signs of  land, I wore and stood again to the eastward, and soon after spoke with  Captain Furneaux. He told me that he thought the land was to the N.W. of  us,; as he had, at "]]]
