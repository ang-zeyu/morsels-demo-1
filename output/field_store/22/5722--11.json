Pl. 23, fig. 15, from Dresden 38c has been placed with  these drawings, although the identification is not certain. It may  refer, however, to the large Moan head below, on which god B is sitting  (Pl. 23, fig. 11). The second type of glyph does not resemble in any way  the Moan, but they are clearly signs for it, as they are often found in  connection with the picture of the Moan, Dresden 7c (Pl. 23, figs. 6, 7,  21) and 10a. In both places fig. 7 is associated with the number  thirteen. Schellhas also places Pl. 23, fig. 17, among the Moan signs.    [Illustration: FIGS. 3, 4, 5, 6.  GLYPHS OF MONTH MUAN SHOWING MOAN-BIRD CHARACTERISTICS.]    One of the eighteen Maya months is named Muan, and some of the glyphs  appearing for this month in the codices certainly represent the Moan or  screech owl. This is especially so with text figs. 3-6. Foerstemann  (1904a) considers that the month Muan and, consequently, the sign as  well, refer to the Pleiades.    In connection with the screech owl referring to death, it is interesting  to note that among the Nahuas the owl is considered of unlucky augury  and is usually found in the \"House of Death\" and \"of Drought\", as  contrasted with the turkey, considered as a bird of good fortune, and  found in the \"House of Rain.\"    COPPERY-TAILED TROGAN or QUETZAL (_Pharomacrus mocinno_). The quetzal is  common locally in certain parts of southern Mexico. Its brilliant  metallic green plumage and the greatly elongated tail feathers make it a  very notable bird. The feathers of the head are erect and stand out as a  light crest, those of the anterior portion being slightly recurved. The  delicate erect feathers of the head are well indicated in Vaticanus  3773, 17 (Pl. 24, fig. 9) and the tail, also, in this figure, is only  slightly conventionalized with an upward instead of the natural downward  sweep. In most of the representations, the crest feathers are  indicatd[TN-7] by large plumes, the most anterior of which project  forward. They may be even further modified into three knobs shown in  Dresden 7c (Pl. 24, fig. 1). The two characteristics of the quetzal,  namely its erect head feathers and its extraordinarily long tail  feathers, are often used separately. Thus the tail, which is commonly  drawn with the outer feather of each side strongly curled forward,  appears by itself in Pl. 24, fig. 8, or it may be seen as a plume in the  head-dress of a priest or warrior and in other connections as an  ornament. A greatly conventionalized drawing of the bird is also shown  in Pl. 24, fig. 11, in which the head bears a curious knob and the  dorsal feather of the tail is upcurled in the manner of the other  drawings. It is not at once apparent why the long drooping tail feathers  should be shown thus recurved. Possibly these feathers, when used by the  Mayas for plumes, curled over by their own weight, if held erect, so  that the representations are a compromise between the natural appearance  and that when used as ornament in the head decoration.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.  QUETZAL, TEMPLE OF THE CROSS, PALENQUE.]    The color of the bird and the very long tail feathers have already been  mentioned, and these explain the reason of the importance of this bird  among the Mayas. It is claimed by several old authorities that the  quetzal was reserved for the rulers, and that it was death for any  common person to kill this bird for his own use. It seems from a  statement in Landa (1864, p. 190)[341-*] that birds were domesticated  for the feathers. This bird occurs again and again in various  modifications throughout the Maya art. The feathers of the quetzal are  the ones usually associated with the serpent, making the rebus,  _Quetzalcoatl_, the feathered serpent, the culture hero of the Nahuas,  or _Kukulcan_, which has the same signification among the Mayas. It is  impossible to mention here all the various connections in which the  quetzal appears. The feathers play an important part in the composition  of the head-dresses of the priests and warriors, especially those in the  stone carvings. A quotation has already been given from Landa, showing  the use made of feathers in the dress of the people. Text fig. 7 shows  perhaps the most elaborate representation of this bird. It is found on  the sculptured tablet of the Temple of the Cross at Palenque. The  quetzal is shown seated on top of a branching tree which was long taken  to represent a cross. A similar representation is seen on the tablet of  the Temple of the Foliated Cross from the same ruined city. In the Codex  Fejervary-Mayer, there are four trees in each of which there is a bird.  A quetzal is perched in the one corresponding to the east, which is  regarded as the region of opulence and moisture. Seler (1901, p. 17)  suggests that the quetzal in the tree on the two bas-reliefs at Palenque  may represent a similar idea and that temples which would show the other  three trees and their respective birds had not been built in that  center.    The representation of the quetzal as an entire bird is, after all,  comparatively rare. The most realistic drawing is seen on a jar from  Copan in the collections of the Peabody Museum. The whole body of the  bird is shown as a head-dress in a few places in the codices where birth  and the naming of children are pictured. In Dresden 16c (Pl. 24, fig. 3)  and Tro-Cortesianus 94c (Pl. 24, fig. 6), the quetzal is the head-dress  of women. In Dresden 13b (Pl. 24, fig. 2), a partial drawing of the bird  is shown as a part of the head-dress of god E, in Dresden 7c (Pl. 24,  fig. 1) of god H, and in Tro-Cortesianus 110c of god F. The feathers  alone appear as a female head decoration in Dresden 20c (Pl. 24, fig.  8). It occurs as a sacrifice among the rites of the four years in  Tro-Cortesianus 36b (Pl. 24, fig. 12). In Tro-Cortesianus 70a (Pl. 24,  fig. 5), it is found in the act of eating fruit growing over the \"young  god.\" In Tro-Cortesianus 100b (Pl. 24, fig. 4), the bird is perched over  the encased head of god C.    There seems to be a glyph used for the quetzal. In those drawn in Pl.  24, figs. 10, 17, it is noticeable that the anterior part only of the  head is shown. The first is a glyph from the tablet of the Temple of the  Sun at Palenque, and at least suggests the quetzal by the feathers on  the top of the head, as also Pl. 24, fig. 13, a glyph from Copan, Stela  10, where the entire head appears in a much conventionalized form. Other  glyphs are shown in Pl. 24, figs. 14-16, in which there is a single  prominent recurved feather shown over the eye, succeeded by a few  conventionalized feathers, then one or more directed posteriorly. It is  to be noted that whereas in many previous examples of glyphs the full  drawing of the animal or bird has been found in connection with them,  here with the quetzal glyphs there is no instance where a drawing of the  bird occurs with them. A curious human figure (Pl. 24, fig. 19), with a  head decoration similar to the frontal curve and markings on the quetzal  glyphs (fig. 14-16), may possibly represent this bird in some relation.    BLUE MACAW (_Ara militaris_). A large macaw (Maya, _mox_ or _[t.]u[t.]_)  is undoubtedly pictured in the figures in Pl. 25. The least  conventionalized drawing found is that shown in Dresden 16c (Pl. 25,  fig. 2), a bird characterized by long narrow tail feathers, a heavy  bill, and a series of scale-like markings on the face and about the eye.  Further conventionalized drawings are found in Pl. 25, figs. 3, 10, 13,  and Pl. 26, fig. 1. In all these the tail is less characteristic, though  composed of long, narrow feathers, and the facial markings are reduced  to a ring of circular marks about the eye. These last undoubtedly  represent, as supposed by Stempell, the bare space about the eye found  in certain of these large parrots. In addition, the space between the  eye and the base of the bill is partially bare with small patches of  feathers scattered at somewhat regular intervals in rows. It is probable  that this appearance is represented by the additional round marks about  the base of the bill in Pl. 25, figs. 1, 2, 5, 8, the last two of which  show the head only. There has hitherto been some question as to the  identity of certain stone carvings, similar to that on Stela B from  Copan, of which a portion is shown in Pl. 25, fig. 8. This has even been  interpreted as the trunk of an elephant or a mastodon, but is  unquestionably a macaw's beak. In addition to the ornamental  crosshatching on the beak, which is also seen on the glyph from the same  stela (Pl. 25, fig. 5), there is an ornamental scroll beneath the eye  which likewise is crosshatched and surrounded by a ring of subcircular  marks that continue to the base of the beak. The nostril is the large  oval marking directly in front of the eye.    The animal in Dresden 40b (Pl. 25, fig. 1) has always been considered  to be a tortoise (Schellhas, 1904, p. 44, and Foerstemann, 1904). This  animal, together with the dog, is found beneath the constellation signs  carrying firebrands; both are regarded as lightning beasts. By comparing  the head of the figure shown in Pl. 25, fig. 1, with figs. 2, 4, 5, of  the same plate, the reasonableness of the identification of this head as  that of a macaw and not that of a tortoise appears clear. The same  figure occurs in Tro-Cortesianus 12a (Pl. 25, fig. 3) carrying a torch.    In order to make this point clearer, we will take up the consideration  of the glyphs at this place, rather than at the end of the section as  usual. As the macaw in Pl. 25, fig. 1, has been hitherto identified as a  turtle, so the glyph found in connection with it (Pl. 25, fig. 6) has  been considered to stand for the turtle. Pl. 25, fig. 7, is another  drawing of the same glyph. By comparing the markings on the face of fig.  1, it is seen that a similar ring"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1906"],[0,"Erewhon; Or, Over the Range (#13)"],[1,"with me; but that when  I arrived there I should be set at liberty, and a suitable allowance  would be made me.  My teacher also told me that one of the leading  merchants had sent me an invitation to repair to his house and to  consider myself his guest for as long a time as I chose.  \"He is a  delightful man,\" continued the interpreter, \"but has suffered terribly  from\" (here there came a long word which I could not quite catch, only it  was much longer than kleptomania), \"and has but lately recovered from  embezzling a large sum of money under singularly distressing  circumstances; but he has quite got over it, and the straighteners say  that he has made a really wonderful recovery; you are sure to like him.\"          CHAPTER IX: TO THE METROPOLIS      With the above words the good man left the room before I had time to  express my astonishment at hearing such extraordinary language from the  lips of one who seemed to be a reputable member of society.  \"Embezzle a  large sum of money under singularly distressing circumstances!\" I  exclaimed to myself, \"and ask _me_ to go and stay with him!  I shall do  nothing of the sort--compromise myself at the very outset in the eyes of  all decent people, and give the death-blow to my chances of either  converting them if they are the lost tribes of Israel, or making money  out of them if they are not!  No.  I will do anything rather than that.\"  And when I next saw my teacher I told him that I did not at all like the  sound of what had been proposed for me, and that I would have nothing to  do with it.  For by my education and the example of my own parents, and I  trust also in some degree from inborn instinct, I have a very genuine  dislike for all unhandsome dealings in money matters, though none can  have a greater regard for money than I have, if it be got fairly.    The interpreter was much surprised by my answer, and said that I should  be very foolish if I persisted in my refusal.    Mr. Nosnibor, he continued, \"is a man of at least 500,000 horse-power\"  (for their way of reckoning and classifying men is by the number of foot  pounds which they have money enough to raise, or more roughly by their  horse-power), \"and keeps a capital table; besides, his two daughters are  among the most beautiful women in Erewhon.\"    When I heard all this, I confess that I was much shaken, and inquired  whether he was favourably considered in the best society.    \"Certainly,\" was the answer; \"no man in the country stands higher.\"    He then went on to say that one would have thought from my manner that my  proposed host had had jaundice or pleurisy or been generally unfortunate,  and that I was in fear of infection.    \"I am not much afraid of infection,\" said I, impatiently, \"but I have  some regard for my character; and if I know a man to be an embezzler of  other people's money, be sure of it, I will give him as wide a berth as I  can.  If he were ill or poor--\"    \"Ill or poor!\" interrupted the interpreter, with a face of great alarm.  \"So that's your notion of propriety!  You would consort with the basest  criminals, and yet deem simple embezzlement a bar to friendly  intercourse.  I cannot understand you.\"    \"But I am poor myself,\" cried I.    \"You were,\" said he; \"and you were liable to be severely punished for  it,--indeed, at the council which was held concerning you, this fact was  very nearly consigning you to what I should myself consider a  well-deserved chastisement\" (for he was getting angry, and so was I);  \"but the Queen was so inquisitive, and wanted so much to see you, that  she petitioned the King and made him give you his pardon, and assign you  a pension in consideration of your meritorious complexion.  It is lucky  for you that he has not heard what you have been saying now, or he would  be sure to cancel it.\"    As I heard these words my heart sank within me.  I felt the extreme  difficulty of my position, and how wicked I should be in running counter  to established usage.  I remained silent for several minutes, and then  said that I should be happy to accept the embezzler's invitation,--on  which my instructor brightened and said I was a sensible fellow.  But I  felt very uncomfortable.  When he had left the room, I mused over the  conversation which had just taken place between us, but I could make  nothing out of it, except that it argued an even greater perversity of  mental vision than I had been yet prepared for.  And this made me  wretched; for I cannot bear having much to do with people who think  differently from myself.  All sorts of wandering thoughts kept coming  into my head.  I thought of my master's hut, and my seat upon the  mountain side, where I had first conceived the insane idea of exploring.  What years and years seemed to have passed since I had begun my journey!    I thought of my adventures in the gorge, and on the journey hither, and  of Chowbok.  I wondered what Chowbok told them about me when he got  back,--he had done well in going back, Chowbok had.  He was not  handsome--nay, he was hideous; and it would have gone hardly with him.  Twilight drew on, and rain pattered against the windows.  Never yet had I  felt so unhappy, except during three days of sea-sickness at the  beginning of my voyage from England.  I sat musing and in great  melancholy, until Yram made her appearance with light and supper.  She  too, poor girl, was miserable; for she had heard that I was to leave  them.  She had made up her mind that I was to remain always in the town,  even after my imprisonment was over; and I fancy had resolved to marry me  though I had never so much as hinted at her doing so.  So what with the  distressingly strange conversation with my teacher, my own friendless  condition, and Yram's melancholy, I felt more unhappy than I can  describe, and remained so till I got to bed, and sleep sealed my eyelids.    On awaking next morning I was much better.  It was settled that I was to  make my start in a conveyance which was to be in waiting for me at about  eleven o'clock; and the anticipation of change put me in good spirits,  which even the tearful face of Yram could hardly altogether derange.  I  kissed her again and again, assured her that we should meet hereafter,  and that in the meanwhile I should be ever mindful of her kindness.  I  gave her two of the buttons off my coat and a lock of my hair as a  keepsake, taking a goodly curl from her own beautiful head in return: and  so, having said good-bye a hundred times, till I was fairly overcome with  her great sweetness and her sorrow, I tore myself away from her and got  down-stairs to the caleche which was in waiting.  How thankful I was when  it was all over, and I was driven away and out of sight.  Would that I  could have felt that it was out of mind also!  Pray heaven that it is so  now, and that she is married happily among her own people, and has  forgotten me!    And now began a long and tedious journey with which I should hardly  trouble the reader if I could.  He is safe, however, for the simple  reason that I was blindfolded during the greater part of the time.  A  bandage was put upon my eyes every morning, and was only removed at night  when I reached the inn at which we were to pass the night.  We travelled  slowly, although the roads were good.  We drove but one horse, which took  us our day's journey from morning till evening, about six hours,  exclusive of two hours' rest in the middle of the day.  I do not suppose  we made above thirty or thirty-five miles on an average.  Each day we had  a fresh horse.  As I have said already, I could see nothing of the  country.  I only know that it was level, and that several times we had to  cross large rivers in ferry-boats.  The inns were clean and comfortable.  In one or two of the larger towns they were quite sumptuous, and the food  was good and well cooked.  The same wonderful health and grace and beauty  prevailed everywhere.    I found myself an object of great interest; so much so, that the driver  told me he had to keep our route secret, and at times to go to places  that were not directly on our road, in order to avoid the press that  would otherwise have awaited us.  Every evening I had a reception, and  grew heartily tired of having to say the same things over and over again  in answer to the same questions, but it was impossible to be angry with  people whose manners were so delightful.  They never once asked after my  health, or even whether I was fatigued with my journey; but their first  question was almost invariably an inquiry after my temper, the _naivete_  of which astonished me till I became used to it.  One day, being tired  and cold, and weary of saying the same thing over and over again, I  turned a little brusquely on my questioner and said that I was  exceedingly cross, and that I could hardly feel in a worse humour with  myself and every one else than at that moment.  To my surprise, I was met  with the kindest expressions of condolence, and heard it buzzed about the  room that I was in an ill temper; whereon people began to give me nice  things to smell and to eat, which really did seem to have some temper-  mending quality about them, for I soon felt pleased and was at once  congratulated upon being better.  The next morning two or three people  sent their servants to the hotel with sweetmeats, and inquiries whether I  had quite recovered from my ill humour.  On receiving the good things I  felt in half a mind to be ill-tempered every evening; but I disliked the  condolences and the inquiries, and found it most comfortable to keep my  natural temper, which is smooth enough generally.    Among those who came to visit me were some who had received a liberal  education at the Colleges of Unreason, and taken the highest degrees in  hypothetics, which are their principal study.  These gentlemen had now  settled down to various employments in the country, as straighteners,  managers and"]]]
