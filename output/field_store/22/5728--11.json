[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19164"],[0,"Lectures on Art, Delivered Before the University of Oxford in Hilary Term, 1870 (#13)"],[1,"art are precisely  indicative of their distorted moral nature.      81. But the truly great nations nearly always begin from a race  possessing this imaginative power; and for some time their progress is  very slow, and their state not one of innocence, but of feverish and  faultful animal energy. This is gradually subdued and exalted into  bright human life; the art instinct purifying itself with the rest of  the nature, until social perfectness is nearly reached; and then comes  the period when conscience and intellect are so highly developed, that  new forms of error begin in the inability to fulfil the demands of the  one, or to answer the doubts of the other. Then the wholeness of the  people is lost; all kinds of hypocrisies and oppositions of science  develop themselves; their faith is questioned on one side, and  compromised with on the other; wealth commonly increases at the same  period to a destructive extent; luxury follows; and the ruin of the  nation is then certain: while the arts, all this time, are simply, as I  said at first, the exponents of each phase of its moral state, and no  more control it in its political career than the gleam of the firefly  guides its oscillation. It is true that their most splendid results are  usually obtained in the swiftness of the power which is hurrying to the  precipice; but to lay the charge of the catastrophe to the art by which  it is illumined, is to find a cause for the cataract in the hues of its  iris. It is true that the colossal vices belonging to periods of great  national wealth (for wealth, you will find, is the real root of all  evil) can turn every good gift and skill of nature or of man to evil  purpose. If, in such times, fair pictures have been misused, how much  more fair realities? And if Miranda is immoral to Caliban, is that  Miranda's fault?      82. And I could easily go on to trace for you what at the moment I  speak, is signified, in our own national character, by the forms of art,  and unhappily also by the forms of what is not art, but [Greek:  atechnia], that exist among us. But the more important question is, What  _will_ be signified by them; what is there in us now of worth and  strength, which under our new and partly accidental impulse towards  formative labour, may be by that expressed, and by that fortified?    Would it not be well to know this? Nay, irrespective of all future work,  is it not the first thing we should want to know, what stuff we are made  of--how far we are +agathoi+ or +kakoi+--good, or good for  nothing? We may all know that, each of ourselves, easily enough, if we  like to put one grave question well home.      83. Supposing it were told any of you by a physician whose word you  could not but trust, that you had not more than seven days to live. And  suppose also that, by the manner of your education it had happened to  you, as it has happened to many, never to have heard of any future  state, or not to have credited what you heard; and therefore that you  had to face this fact of the approach of death in its simplicity:  fearing no punishment for any sin that you might have before committed,  or in the coming days might determine to commit; and having similarly no  hope of reward for past, or yet possible, virtue; nor even of any  consciousness whatever to be left to you, after the seventh day had  ended, either of the results of your acts to those whom you loved, or of  the feelings of any survivors towards you. Then the manner in which you  would spend the seven days is an exact measure of the morality of your  nature.      84. I know that some of you, and I believe the greater number of you,  would, in such a case, spend the granted days entirely as you ought.  Neither in numbering the errors, or deploring the pleasures of the  past; nor in grasping at vile good in the present, nor vainly lamenting  the darkness of the future; but in an instant and earnest execution of  whatever it might be possible for you to accomplish in the time, in  setting your affairs in order, and in providing for the future comfort,  and--so far as you might by any message or record of yourself,--for the  consolation, of those whom you loved, and by whom you desired to be  remembered, not for your good, but for theirs. How far you might fail  through human weakness, in shame for the past, despair at the little  that could in the remnant of life be accomplished, or the intolerable  pain of broken affection, would depend wholly on the degree in which  your nature had been depressed or fortified by the manner of your past  life. But I think there are few of you who would not spend those last  days better than all that had preceded them.      85. If you look accurately through the records of the lives that have  been most useful to humanity, you will find that all that has been done  best, has been done so;--that to the clearest intellects and highest  souls,--to the true children of the Father, with whom a thousand years  are as one day, their poor seventy years are but as seven days. The  removal of the shadow of death from them to an uncertain, but always  narrow, distance, never takes away from them their intuition of its  approach; the extending to them of a few hours more or less of light  abates not their acknowledgment of the infinitude that must remain to be  known beyond their knowledge,--done beyond their deeds: the  unprofitableness of their momentary service is wrought in a magnificent  despair, and their very honour is bequeathed by them for the joy of  others, as they lie down to their rest, regarding for themselves the  voice of men no more.      86. The best things, I repeat to you, have been done thus, and  therefore, sorrowfully. But the greatest part of the good work of the  world is done either in pure and unvexed instinct of duty, \"I have  stubbed Thornaby waste,\" or else, and better, it is cheerful and helpful  doing of what the hand finds to do, in surety that at evening time,  whatsoever is right the Master will give. And that it be worthily done,  depends wholly on that ultimate quantity of worth which you can measure,  each in himself, by the test I have just given you. For that test,  observe, will mark to you the precise force, first of your absolute  courage, and then of the energy in you for the right ordering of things,  and the kindly dealing with persons. You have cut away from these two  instincts every selfish or common motive, and left nothing but the  energies of Order and of Love.      87. Now, where those two roots are set, all the other powers and desires  find right nourishment, and become to their own utmost, helpful to  others and pleasurable to ourselves. And so far as those two springs of  action are not in us, all other powers become corrupt or dead; even the  love of truth, apart from these, hardens into an insolent and cold  avarice of knowledge, which unused, is more vain than unused gold.      88. These, then, are the two essential instincts of humanity: the love  of Order and the love of Kindness. By the love of order the moral energy  is to deal with the earth, and to dress it, and keep it; and with all  rebellious and dissolute forces in lower creatures, or in ourselves. By  the love of doing kindness it is to deal rightly with all surrounding  life. And then, grafted on these, we are to make every other passion  perfect; so that they may every one have full strength and yet be  absolutely under control.      89. Every one must be strong, every one perfect, every one obedient as a  war horse. And it is among the most beautiful pieces of mysticism to  which eternal truth is attached, that the chariot race, which Plato uses  as an image of moral government, and which is indeed the most perfect  type of it in any visible skill of men, should have been made by the  Greeks the continual subject of their best poetry and best art.  Nevertheless Plato's use of it is not altogether true. There is no black  horse in the chariot of the soul. One of the driver's worst faults is in  starving his horses; another, in not breaking them early enough; but  they are all good. Take, for example, one usually thought of as wholly  evil--that of Anger, leading to vengeance. I believe it to be quite one  of the crowning wickednesses of this age that we have starved and  chilled our faculty of indignation, and neither desire nor dare to  punish crimes justly. We have taken up the benevolent idea, forsooth,  that justice is to be preventive instead of vindictive; and we imagine  that we are to punish, not in anger, but in expediency; not that we may  give deserved pain to the person in fault, but that we may frighten  other people from committing the same fault. The beautiful theory of  this non-vindictive justice is, that having convicted a man of a crime  worthy of death, we entirely pardon the criminal, restore him to his  place in our affection and esteem, and then hang him, not as a  malefactor, but as a scarecrow. That is the theory. And the practice is,  that we send a child to prison for a month for stealing a handful of  walnuts, for fear that other children should come to steal more of our  walnuts. And we do not punish a swindler for ruining a thousand  families, because we think swindling is a wholesome excitement to trade.      90. But all true justice is vindictive to vice, as it is rewarding to  virtue. Only--and herein it is distinguished from personal revenge--it  is vindictive of the wrong done;--not of the wrong done _to us_. It is  the national expression of deliberate anger, as of deliberate gratitude;  it is not exemplary, or even corrective, but essentially retributive; it  is the absolute art of measured recompense, giving honour where honour  is due, and shame where shame is due, and joy where joy is due, and pain  where pain is due. It is neither educational, for men are to be educated  by wholesome habit, not by rewards and punishments; nor is it  preventive, for it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],[0,"The Quirt (#13)"],[1," just  the same. If you use your brains you can outwit them, and if you have  any nerve----\"    Brit made a sound somewhat like a snort. \"These days, when politics is  played by the big fellows, and the law is used to make money for 'em, it  takes nerve just to hang on,\" he said. \"Nobody but a dang fool would  fight.\" Slow anger grew within him. He turned upon Lorraine almost  fiercely. \"D'yuh think me and Frank could fight the Sawtooth and get  anything out of it but a coffin apiece, maybe?\" he demanded harshly.  \"Don't the Sawtooth _own_ this country? Warfield's got the sheriff in  his pocket, and the cor'ner, and the judge, and the stock  inspector--he's _Senator_ Warfield, and what he wants he gets. He gets  it through the law that you was talking about a little while ago. What  you goin' to do about it? If I had the money and the land and the  political pull he's got, mebby I'd have me a sheriff and a judge, too.    \"Fred Thurman tried to fight the Sawtooth over a water right he owned  and they wanted. They had the case runnin' in court till they like to of  took the last dollar he had. He got bull-headed. That water right meant  the hull ranch--everything he owned. You can't run a ranch without  water. And when he'd took the case up and up till it got to the Supreme  Court, and he stood some show of winnin' out--he had an accident. He was  drug to death by his horse.\"    Brit stooped and opened the stove door, seeking a live coal; found none  and turned again to Lorraine, shaking his pipe at her for emphasis.    \"We try to prove Fred was murdered, and what's the result? Something  happens: to me, mebby, or Frank, or both of us. And you can't say,  'Here, I know the Sawtooth had a hand in that.' You got to _prove_ it!  And when you've proved it,\" he added bitterly, \"you got to have officers  that'll carry out the law instead of using it to hog-tie yuh.\"    His futile, dull anger surged up again. \"You call us cowards because we  don't git up on our hind legs and fight the Sawtooth. A lot _you_ know  about courage! You've read stories, and you've saw moving pictures, and  you think that's the West--that's the way they do it. One man hold off a  hunderd with his gun--and on the other hand, a hunderd men, mebby,  ridin' hell-whoopin' after one. You think that's it--that's the way they  do it. Hunh!\" He lifted the lid of the stove, spat into it as if he were  spitting in the face of an enemy, and turned again to Lorraine.    \"What you seen--what you say you seen--that was done at night when there  wasn't no audience. All the fighting the Sawtooth does is done under  cover. _You_ won't see none of it--they ain't such fools. And what us  small fellers do, we do it quiet, too. We ain't ridin' up and down the  trail, flourishin' our six-shooters and yellin' to the Sawtooth to come  on and we'll clean 'em up!\"    \"But you're fighting just the same, aren't you, dad? You're not letting  them----\"    \"We're makin' out to live here--and we've been doin' it for twenty-five  year,\" Brit told her, with a certain grim dignity. \"We've still got a  few head uh stock left--enough to live on. Playin' poker with a nickel,  mebby--but we manage to ante, every hand so fur.\" His mind returned to  the grisly thing Lorraine had seen.    \"We can't run down the man that got Fred Thurman, supposin' he was  killed, as you say. That's what the law is paid to do. If Lone Morgan  told you not to talk about it, he told you right. He was talking for  your own good. What about Al--the man from Whisper? You didn't tell  _him_, did you?\"    His tone, the suppressed violence of his manner, frightened Lorraine.  She moved farther away from him.    \"I didn't tell him anything. He was curious but--I only said I knew him  because he was wearing a brown hat, and the man that shot Mr. Thurman  had a brown hat. I didn't say all that. I just mentioned the hat. And he  said there were lots of brown hats in the country. He said he had traded  for that one, just yesterday. He said his own hat was gray.\"    Brit stared at her, his jaw sagging a little, his eyes growing vacant  with the thoughts he hid deep in his mind. He slumped down into his  chair and leaned forward, his arms resting on his knees, his fingers  clasped loosely. After a little he tilted his head and looked up at  her.    \"You better go to bed,\" he told her stolidly. \"And if you're going to  live at the Quirt, Raine, you'll have to learn to keep your mouth shut.  I ain't blaming you--but you told too much to Al Woodruff. Don't talk to  him no more, if he comes here when I'm gone.\" He put out a hand,  beckoning her to him, sorry for his harshness. Lorraine went to him and  knelt beside him, slipping an arm around his neck while she hid her face  on his shoulder.    \"I won't be a nuisance, dad--really, I won't,\" she said. \"I--I can shoot  a gun. I never shot one with bullets in, but I could. And I learned to  do lots of things when I was working in that play West I thought was  real. It isn't like I thought. There's no picture stuff in the real  West, I guess; they don't do things that way. But--what I want you to  know is that if they're fighting you they'll have to fight me, too.    \"I don't mean movie stuff, honestly I don't. I'm in this thing now, and  you'll have to count me, same as you count Jim and Sorry. Won't you  please feel that I'm one more in the game, dad, and not just another  responsibility? I'll herd cattle, or do whatever there is to do. And  I'll keep my mouth shut, too. I can't stay here, day after day, doing  nothing but sweep and dust two rooms and fry potatoes and bacon for you  at night. Dad, I'll go _crazy_ if you don't let me into your life!    \"Dad, if you knew the stunts I've done in the last three years! It was  make-believe West, but I learned things just the same.\" She kissed him  on the unshaven cheek nearest her,--and thought of the kisses she had  breathed upon the cheeks of story fathers with due care for the make-up  on her lips. Just because this was real, she kissed him again with the  frank vigor of a child.    \"Dad,\" she said wheedlingly, \"I think you might scare up something that  I can really ride. Yellowjacket is safe, but--but you have real _live_  horses on the ranch, haven't you? You must _not_ go judging me by the  palms and the bay windows of the Casa Grande. That's where I've slept,  the last few years when I wasn't off on location--but it's just as  sensible to think I don't know anything else, as it would be for me to  think you can't do anything but skim milk and fry bacon and make  sour-dough bread, just because I've seen you do it!\"    Brit laughed and patted her awkwardly on the back. \"If you was a boy,  I'd set you up as a lawyer,\" he said with an attempt at playfulness. \"I  kinda thought you could ride. I seen how you piled onto old Yellowjacket  and the way you held your reins. It runs in the blood, I guess. I'll see  what I can do in the way of a horse. Ole Yellowjacket used to be a real  rim-rider, but he's gitting old; gitting old--same as me.\"    \"You're not! You're just letting yourself _feel_ old. And am I one of  the outfit, dad?\"    \"I guess so--only there ain't going to be any of this hell-whoopin'  stuff, Raine. You can't travel these trails at a long lope with yore  hair flyin' out behind and--and all that damn foolishness. I've saw 'em  in the movin' pitchers----\"    Lorraine blushed, and was thankful that her dad had not watched her work  in that serial. For that matter, she hoped that Lone Morgan would never  stray into a movie where any of her pictures were being shown.    \"I'm serious, dad. I don't want to make a show of myself. But if you'll  feel that I can be a help instead of a handicap, that's what I want. And  if it comes to fighting----\"    Brit pushed her from him impatiently. \"There yuh go--fight--fight--and I  told yuh there ain't any fighting going on. Nothing more'n a fight to  hang on and make a living. That means straight, hard work and mindin'  your own business. If you want to help at that----\"    \"I do,\" said Raine quietly, getting to her feet. Her legacy of  stubbornness set her lips firmly together. \"That's exactly what I mean.  Good night, dad.\"    Brit answered her noncommittally, apparently sunk already in his own  musings. But his lips drew in to suppress a smile when he saw, from the  corner of his eyes, that Lorraine was winding the alarm on the cheap  kitchen clock, and that she set the hand carefully and took the clock  with her to bed.          CHAPTER NINE    THE EVIL EYE OF THE SAWTOOTH      Oppression is a growth that flourishes best in the soil of opportunity.  It seldom springs into full power at once. The Sawtooth Cattle Company  had begun much as its neighbors had begun: with a tract of land, cattle,  and the ambition for prospering. Senator Warfield had then been plain  Bill Warfield, manager of the outfit, who rode with his men and saw how  his herds increased,--saw too how they might increase faster under  certain conditions. At the outset he was not, perhaps, more unscrupulous  than some of his neighbors. True, if a homesteader left his claim for a  longer time than the law allowed him, Bill Warfield would choose one of  his own men to file a contest on that claim. The man's wages would be  paid. Witnesses were never lacking to swear to the improvements he had  made, and after the patent had been granted the homesteader (for the  contestant always won, in that country) the Sawtooth, would pay him for  the land. Frequently a Sawtooth man would file upon land before any  other man had claimed it. Sometimes a Sawtooth man would purchase a  relinquishment from some poor devil of a claim-holder who seemed always  to have bad luck, and so became discouraged and ready to sell. An  intelligent man like Bill Warfield could acquire much land in this  manner, give him time enough.    In much the same manner his herds increased. He bought out small  ranchers who were crowded to the selling"]]]
