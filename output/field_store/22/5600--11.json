But though Government was not  wholly blind to the warning, it could not decide what ought to be done,  and beyond tinkering at one or two sections of the Criminal Code bearing  on Press offences, it did nothing until history had repeated itself on a  much larger scale. Tilak was generously released from prison before the  expiration of his sentence, and his release was construed in the Deccan  as a fresh triumph. He was acclaimed by his followers as a \"national\"  martyr and hero. After a short \"rest-cure\" in a sanatorium Tilak  returned to the _Kesari_, which, in the hands of his co-adjutors, two  other Chitpavan Brahmans, Mr. Kelkar and Mr. Khadilkar, had lost nothing  of its vitriolic pungency in his absence. The celebration with renewed  pomp in 1900 of Shivaji's \"birthday\" at Raighar marked the resumption of  Tilak's operations. I need not stop to recount all the incidents of this  second campaign in the Deccan, in which Ganpati celebrations, Shivaji  festivals, gymnastic societies, &c., played exactly the same part as in  the first campaign. For three or four years the Tai Maharaj case, in  which, as executor of one of his friends, Shri Baba Maharaj, a Sirdar of  Poona, Tilak was attacked by the widow and indicted on charges of  forgery, perjury, and corruption, absorbed a great deal of his time,  but, after long and wearisome proceedings, the earlier stages of the  case ended in a judgment in his favour which was greeted as another  triumph for him, and not unnaturally though, as recent developments have  shown, quite prematurely,[5] won him much sympathy, even amongst those  who were politically opposed to him. But throughout this ordeal Tilak  never relaxed his political activity either in the Press or in the  manifold organizations which he controlled.    His influence, moreover, was rapidly extending far beyond, Poona and the  Deccan. He had at an early date associated himself with, the Indian  National Congress, and he was secretary of the Standing Committee for  the Deccan. His Congress work had brought him into contact with the  politicians of other provinces, and upon none did his teachings and his  example produce so deep an impression as upon the emotional Bengalees.  He had not the gift of sonorous eloquence which they possess, and he  never figured conspicuously as an orator at the annual sessions of  Congress. But his calculating resourcefulness and his indomitable  energy, even his masterfulness, impressed them all the more, and in the  two memorable sessions held at Benares in 1905 and at Calcutta in 1906,  when the agitation over the Partition of Bengal was at its height, his  was the dominant personality, not at the tribune, but in the lobbies. He  had been one of the first champions of _Swadeshi_ as an economic weapon  in the struggle against British rule, and he saw in the adoption of the  boycott, with all the lawlessness which it involved, an unprecedented  opportunity of stimulating the active forces of disaffection. As far as  Bengal was concerned, an \"advanced\" Press which always took its cue from  Tilak's _Kesari_ had already done its work, and Tilak could rely upon  the enthusiastic support of men like Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal and Mr.  Arabindo Ghose, who were politically his disciples, though their  religious and social standpoints were in many respects different, Mr.  Surendranath Banerjee, who subsequently fell out with Tilak, had at  first modelled his propaganda very largely upon that of the Deccan  leader. Not only had he tried to introduce into Bengal the singularly  inappropriate cult of Shivaji, but he had been clearly inspired by  Tilak's methods in placing the _Swadeshi_ boycott in Bengal under the  special patronage of so popular a deity as the \"terrible goddess\" Kali.  Again, he had followed Tilak's example in brigading schoolboys and  students into youthful gymnastic societies for purposes of political  agitation, Tilak's main object at the moment was to pledge the rest of  India, as represented in the Congress, to the violent course upon which  Bengal was embarking. Amongst the \"moderate\" section outside Bengal  there was a disposition to confine its action to platonic expressions of  sympathy with the Bengalees and with the principle of _Swadeshi_--in  itself perfectly legitimate--as a movement for the encouragement of  native industries. At Benares in 1905 the Congress had adopted a  resolution which only conditionally endorsed the boycott, and the  increasing disorders which had subsequently accompanied its enforcement  had tended to enhance rather than to diminish the reluctance of the  Moderate party to see the Congress definitely pledged to it when it met  at the end of 1906 in Calcutta. The \"advanced\" party led by Mr. Bepin  Chandra Pal had put forward Tilak's candidature to the presidency, and a  split which seemed imminent was only avoided by a compromise which saved  appearances. Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, a leading Parsee of Bombay, who had  been drawn into co-operation with the Congress under the influence of  the political Liberalism which he had heard expounded in England by  Gladstone and Bright, played at this critical period an important part  which deserves recognition. He was as eloquent as any Bengalee, and he  possessed in a high degree the art of managing men. In politics he was  as stout an opponent of Tilak's violent methods as was Mr. Gokhale on  social and religious questions, and he did perhaps more than any one  else to prevent the complete triumph of Tilakism in the Congress right  down to the Surat upheaval. Thanks largely to his efforts, the veteran  Mr. Naoroji was elected to the chair at Calcutta. None could venture  openly to oppose him, for he was almost the father of the Congress,  which in its early days had owed so much to the small group of liberal  Parsees whom he had gathered about him, and his high personal character  and rectitude of purpose had earned for him universal respect.  Nevertheless, a resolution as amended by Tilak was adopted which,  without mentioning the word \"boycott,\" pledged the Congress to encourage  its practice. But there was considerable heartburning, and the Moderates  were suspected of contemplating some retrograde move at the following  annual session. Tilak was determined to frustrate any such scheme, and  before the Congress assembled at Surat he elaborated at a Nationalist  conference with Mr. Arabindo Ghose in the chair, a plan of campaign  which was to defeat the \"moderates\" by demanding, before the election of  the president, an undertaking that the resolutions of the Calcutta  conference should be upheld. The plan, however, was only half  successful. The first day's proceedings produced a violent scene in  which the howling down of Mr. Surendranath Banerjee by the \"advanced\"  wing revealed the personal jealousies that had grown up between the old  Bengalee leader on the one hand and Tilak and his younger followers in  Bengal on the other. The second day's proceedings ended in still wilder  confusion, and after something like a free fight the Congress broke up  after an irreparable rupture, from which its prestige has never  recovered.    Tilak's own prestige, however, with the \"advanced\" party never stood  higher, either in then Deccan or outside of it. In the Deccan he not  only maintained all his old activities, but had extended their field.  Besides the _Kal_, edited by another Chitpawan Brahman, and the  _Rashtramadt_ at Poona, which went to even greater lengths than Tilak's  own _Kesari_, lesser papers obeying his inspiration had been established  in many of the smaller centres. A movement had been set on foot for the  creation of \"national\" schools, entirely independent of State support,  and therefore of State supervision, in which disaffection could, without  let or hindrance, be made part and parcel of the curriculum. Such were  the schools closed down last year in the Central Provinces and this year  at Telegaon. The great development of the cotton industry during the  last ten years, especially in Bombay itself--which has led to vast  agglomerations of labour under conditions unfamiliar in India--had given  Tilak an opportunity of establishing contact with a class of the  population hitherto outside the purview of Indian politics. There are  nearly 100 cotton spinning and weaving mills, employing over 100,000  operatives, congregated mostly in the northern suburbs of the city.  Huddled together in huge tenements this compact population affords by  its density, as well as by its ignorance, a peculiarly accessible field  to the trained agitator. Tilak's emissaries, mostly Brahmans of the  Deccan, brought, moreover, to their nefarious work the added prestige of  a caste which seldom condescends to rub shoulders with those whose mere  contact may involve \"pollution.\" In this, as in many other cases,  politics were closely mixed up with philanthropy, for the conditions of  labour in India are by no means wholly satisfactory, and it would be  unfair to deny to many of Tilak's followers a genuine desire to mitigate  the evils and hardships to which their humbler fellow-creatures were  exposed. Prominent amongst such evils was the growth of drunkenness, and  it would have been all to his honour that Tilak hastened to take up the  cause of temperance, had he not perverted it, as he perverted everything  else, to the promotion of race-hatred. His primary motives may have been  excellent, but he subordinated all things to his ruling anti-British  passion, whilst the fervour of his philanthropic professions won for him  the sympathy and co-operation of many law-abiding citizens who would  otherwise have turned a deaf ear to his political doctrines. He must  have had a considerable command of funds for the purposes of his  propaganda, and though he doubtless had not a few willing and generous  supporters, many subscribed from fear of the lash which he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16459"],[0,"Musical Memories (#13)"],[1,"by his success he wrote the  _Seasons_, a colossal work, the most varied and the most picturesque in  the history of ancient or modern music. In this instance the oratorio is  no longer entirely religious. It gives an audacious picture of nature  with realistic touches which are astonishing even now. There is an  artistic imitation of the different sounds in nature, as the rustling of  the leaves, the songs of the birds in the woods and on the farm, and the  shrill notes of the insects. Above all that is the translation into  music of the profound emotions to which the different aspects of nature  give birth, as the freshness of the forests, the stifling heat before a  storm, the storm itself, and the wonderful sunset that follows. Then  there is a huntsman's chorus which strikes an entirely different note.  There are grape harvests, with the mad dances that follow them. There is  the winter, with a poignant introduction which reminds us of pages in  Schumann. But be reassured, the author does not leave us to the rigors  of the cold. He takes us into a farmhouse where the women are spinning  and where the peasants are drawn about the fire, listening to a funny  tale and laughing immoderately with a gaiety which has never been  surpassed.    But this gigantic work does not end without giving us a glimpse of  Heaven, for with one grand upward burst of flight, Haydn reaches the  realms where Handel and Beethoven preceded him. He equals them and ends  his picture in a dazzling blaze of light.    This is the sort of work of which the public remains in ignorance and  which it ought to know.    But all this is not what I started out to say. I wanted to write about a  delicate, touching, reserved and precious work by the same author--_The  Seven Words of Christ on the Cross_. This work has appeared in three  forms--for an orchestra and chorus, for an orchestra alone, and for a  quartet. When I was a young man, they used to say in Paris that this  work was originally written for a quartet, then developed for an  orchestra, and, finally, the voices were added.    Chance took me to Cadiz, once upon a time, and there I was given the  true story of this beautiful piece of work. To my astonishment I learned  that it had been first performed in the city of Cadiz. They even spoke  of a competition in which Haydn won the prize, but there was never any  such contest. The work was ordered from the author, but the question is  who ordered it. Two religious circles, the Cathedral and the Cueva del  Rosario, both lay claim to the initiative. I have gone over all the  evidence in this dispute which is of little interest to us, for the only  interest is the origin of the composition. There is not the slightest  doubt that the _Seven Words_ was written in the first place for an  orchestra in 1785, and its destination, as we shall see, was settled by  the author himself.    In his _Memoires pour la Biographie et la Bibliographie de l'ile de  Cadix_, Don Francisco de Miton, Marquis de Meritos, relates that he  corresponded with Haydn and ordered this composition which was to be  performed at the Cathedral in Cadiz. According to his account Haydn said  that \"the composition was due more to what Senor Milton wrote than to  his own invention, for it showed every motif so marvellously that on  reading the instructions he seemed to read the music itself.\"    If the Marquis was not boasting, we must confess that the ingenuous  Haydn was not so ingenuous as has been thought, and that he knew how to  flatter his patrons.    In 1801 Breitkopf and Haertel published the work with the addition of  the vocal parts at Leipzig. This edition had a preface by the author in  which he said:         About fifteen years ago, a cure at Cadiz engaged me to write some       passages of instrumental music on the Seven Words of Christ on the       Cross. It was the custom at that time to play an oratorio at the       Cathedral during Holy Week, and they took great pains to give as       much solemnity as possible. The walls, the windows and the pillars       of the church were hung in black, and only a single light in the       centre shone in the sanctuary. The doors were closed at mid-day and       the orchestra began to play. After the opening ceremonies the       bishop entered the pulpit, pronounced one of the \"Seven Words\" and       delivered a few words inspired by it. Then he descended, knelt       before the altar, and remained there for some time. This pause was       relieved by the music. The bishop ascended and descended six times       more and each time, after his homily, music was played. My music       was to be adapted to these ceremonies.         The problem of writing seven _adagios_ to be performed       consecutively, each one to last ten minutes, without wearying the       audience, was not an easy one to solve, and I soon recognized the       impossibility of making my music conform to the prescribed limits.         The work was written and printed without words. Later the       opportunity of adding them was offered, so the oratorio which       Breitkopf and Haertel publish to-day is a complete work and, so far       as the vocal part is concerned, entirely new.         The kind reception which it has received among amateurs makes me       hope that the entire public will welcome it with the same kindness.    Haydn feared to weary his hearers. Our modern bards have no such vain  scruple.    Michel Haydn, Joseph's brother and the author of some highly esteemed  religious compositions, has been generally credited with the addition of  the vocal parts to the _Seven Words_. Joseph Haydn did not say that this  was the case, but it would seem that if he did the work himself he would  have said so in his preface.    This vocal part, however, adds nothing to the value of the work. And it  is of no great consequence who the author of the arrangement for the  quartet was. At the time there were many amateurs who played on  stringed instruments. They used to meet frequently and everything in  music was arranged for quartets just as now everything is arranged for  piano duets. Some of Beethoven's sonatas were arranged in this form. The  piano killed the quartet, and it is a great pity, for the quartet is the  purest form of instrumental music. It is the first form--the fountain of  Hippocrene. Now instrumental music drinks from every cup and the result  is that many times it seems drunk.    To return to the _Seven Words_. Their symphonic form is the only one  worth considering. They are eloquent enough without the aid of voices,  for their charm penetrates. Unlike the _Creation_ and the _Seasons_ they  do not demand extraordinary means of execution, and nothing is easier  than to give them.    The opera houses are closed on Good Friday, and it used to be the custom  to give evening concerts, vaguely termed \"Sacred Concerts,\" because  their programmes were made up wholly or in part of religious music. This  good custom has disappeared and with it the opportunity to give the  public such delightful works as the _Seven Words_, and so many other  things which harmonize with the character of the day.    At one of these Sacred Concerts, Pasdeloup presented on the same evening  the _Credo_ from Liszt's _Missa Solemnis_ and the one from Cherubini's  _Messe du Sacre_. Liszt's _Credo_ was received with a storm of hisses,  while Cherubini's was praised to the skies. I could not help thinking--I  was somewhat unjust, for Cherubini's work has merit--of the people of  Jerusalem who acclaimed Barrabas and demanded the crucifixion of Jesus.    To-day Liszt's _Credo_ is received with wild applause--Victor Hugo did  his part-while Cherubini's is never revived.          CHAPTER XII    THE LISZT CENTENARY AT HEIDELBERG (1912)      The Liszt centenary was celebrated everywhere with elaborate  festivities, perhaps most notably at Budapest where the _Missa Solemnis_  was sung in the great cathedral--that alone would have been sufficient  glory for the composer. At Weimar, which, during his lifetime, Liszt  made a sort of musical Mecca, they gave a performance of his deeply  charming oratorio _Die Legende von der Heiligen Elisabeth_. The festival  at Heidelberg was of special interest as it was organized by the General  Association of German Musicians which Liszt had founded fifty years  before. Each year this society gives in a different city a festival  which lasts several days. It admits foreign members and I was once a  member as Berlioz's successor on Liszt's own invitation. Disagreements  separated us, and I had had no relation with the society for a number  of years when they asked me to take part in this festival. A refusal  would have been misunderstood and I had to accept, although the idea of  performing at my age alongside such _virtuosi_ as Risler, Busoni, and  Friedheim, in the height of their talent, was not encouraging.    The festival lasted four days and there were six concerts--four with the  orchestra and a chorus. They gave the oratorio _Christus_, an enormous  work which takes up all the time allowed for one concert; the Dante and  Faust symphonies, and the symphonic poems _Ce qu'on entend sur la  montagne_ and _Tasso_, to mention only the most important works.    The oratorio _Christus_ lacks the fine unity of the _Saint Elisabeth_.  But the two works are alike in being divided into a series of separate  episodes. While the different episodes in _Saint Elisabeth_ solve the  difficult problem of creating variety and retaining unity, the parts of  _Christus_ are somewhat unrelated. There is something for every taste.  Certain parts are unqualifiedly admirable; others border on the  theatrical; still others are nearly or entirely liturgical, while,  finally, some are picturesque, although there are some almost confusing.  Like Gounod, Liszt was sometimes deceived and attributed to ordinary and  simple sequences of chords a profound significance"]]]
