You did  not see much of him, squire, and natural thought well of him, for he  was a good-looking boy, and could speak fair enough when he liked. I  thought well of him, myself, when he first came, but I larned better,  afterwards.\"    \"There are many excuses to be made for him, John,\" the squire said,  \"and I have had good reports of him, since. Of course, I shall see  that, although he can no longer be regarded as my heir here, he shall  be well provided for. But there will be plenty of time to think of  this.\"    \"Mr. Wilks asked me to say, sir,\" the butler said as he prepared to  leave them, \"that he shall be staying in Sidmouth tomorrow, and that,  if you wish to see him, he will come up here.\"    \"Certainly I wish to see him,\" the squire replied. \"I have many things  to ask him. Let the boy go down, the first thing in the morning,  or--no, if you don't mind, John, would you go down yourself tonight? He  will naturally be anxious to know how his grandchild is getting on.  Tell him with what joy I have received her, and take any message she  may give you.    \"Is there anything you would like to say to your grandfather, child?\"    \"Oh, yes. Please tell him that I think I shall like it, and that he is  to come and see me when he likes, and that, of course, he is to see me  when he comes in the morning, and then I can tell him all about it.\"    \"And say, I shall be glad to see him the first thing after breakfast,\"  the squire added.    The housekeeper soon entered, and Aggie, very sleepy after the  excitements of the day, was taken off to bed. Her sleepiness, however,  disappeared in her wonder at the size of the house, and at the vastness  of her bedroom.    \"Why, you have got a fire!\" she exclaimed in astonishment. \"I never saw  a fire in a bedroom, before.\"    \"I didn't light it for the cold, miss,\" the housekeeper said; \"but  because it is a long time since the room was slept in before, and  because I thought it would be cheerful for you. I shall sleep in the  next room, till things are settled, so that, if you want anything, you  will only have to run in.\"    \"Thank you,\" Aggie said gratefully. \"It does all seem so big; but I am  sure not to want anything. Thank you.\"    \"Here is your box, miss. Would you like me to help undress you?\"    \"Oh, no!\" Aggie laughed. \"Why, of course I can undress myself;\" and she  laughed at the idea of assistance being required in such a matter.    \"Then, good night!\" the housekeeper said. \"I shall leave the door ajar,  between the two rooms, when I come to bed.\"    The next morning, soon after breakfast, Sergeant Wilks was ushered into  the study, where the squire was expecting him. The two men had had hard  thoughts of each other, for many years. The squire regarded the  sergeant as a man who had inveigled his son into marrying his daughter,  while the sergeant regarded the squire as a heartless and unnatural  father, who had left his son to die alone among strangers. The  conversation with John Petersham had taught the sergeant that he had  wronged the squire, by his estimate of him, and that he was to be  pitied rather than blamed in the matter. The squire, on his part, was  grateful to the sergeant for the care he had bestowed upon the child,  and for restoring her to him, and was inclined, indeed, at the moment,  to a universal goodwill to all men.    The sergeant was pale, but self possessed and quiet; while the squire,  moved, by the events of the night before, out of the silent reserve in  which he had, for years, enveloped himself, was agitated and nervous.  He was the first to speak.    \"Mr. Wilks,\" he said. \"I have to give you my heartfelt thanks, for  having restored my granddaughter to me--the more so as I know, from  what she has said, how great a sacrifice you must be making. John has  been telling me of his conversation with you, and you have learned,  from him, that I was not so wholly heartless and unnatural a father as  you must have thought me; deeply as I blame myself, and shall always  blame myself, in the matter.\"    \"Yes,\" the sergeant said. \"I have learned that I have misread you. Had  it not been so, I should have brought the child to you long ago--should  never have taken her away, indeed. Perhaps we have both misjudged each  other.\"    \"I fear that we have,\" the squire said, remembering the letters he  wrote to his son, in his anger, denouncing the sergeant in violent  language.    \"It does not matter, now,\" the sergeant went on quietly; \"but, as I do  not wish Aggie ever to come to think ill of me, in the future, it is  better to set it right.    \"When I left the army, I had saved enough money to furnish a house, and  I took one at Southampton, and set up taking lodgers there. I had my  pension, and lived well until my wife died--a year before your son came  down, from London, with another gentleman, and took my rooms. My  daughter was seventeen when her mother died, and she took to managing  the house. I was careful of her, and gave her orders that, on no  account, was she ever to go into the lodgers' rooms. I waited on them,  myself.    \"How your son first saw her, and got to speak to her, I don't know; but  I am not surprised that, when he did, he loved her, for there was no  prettier or sweeter girl in Hampshire. They took the rooms, first, only  for a fortnight, then the other gentleman went away, and your son  stayed on.    \"One day--it came upon me like a thunderbolt--your son told me he  wanted to marry my Agnes. I was angry, at first. Angry, because it had  been done behind my back, and because I had been deceived. I said as  much; but your son assured me that he had never spoken to her in the  house, but had met her when she went out for her walks. Still, it was  wrong, and I told him so, and I told her so, though, in my heart, I did  not altogether blame them; for young people will be young people, and,  as he had acted honourably in coming to me at once, I let that pass.    \"But, squire, though but a sergeant in His Majesty's service, I had my  pride as you had yours, and I told him, at once, that I would not give  my consent to my daughter's marrying him, until you had given yours;  and that he must leave the house at once, and not see Agnes again,  until he came with your written consent to show me.    \"He went away at once. After a time, he began to write to me, urging me  to change my decision; and from this, although he never said so, I was  sure that you had refused to sanction his marriage. However, I stuck to  what I had said, though it was hard for me to do so, with my child  growing thin and pale before my eyes, with all her bright happiness  gone.    \"So it went on, for three months, and then one morning she was gone,  and I found a letter on her table for me, saying that she had been  married to him a week before, when she went out, as I thought, to spend  the day with a friend. She begged and prayed me to forgive her, and  said how miserable she had been, and that she could not say no to her  lover's pleadings.    \"I wrote to the address she had given me, saying that she had well nigh  broken my heart. She knew that I had only refused my consent because it  would have seemed a dishonourable action, to allow your son to marry  her without your consent. She knew how hard it had been for me to do my  duty, when I saw her pining before my eyes, but I forgave her wholly,  and did not altogether blame her, seeing that it was the way of Nature  that young women, when they once took to loving, should put their  father altogether in the second place;    \"It was hard to me to write that letter, for I longed to see her bonny  face again. But I thought it was my duty. I thought so then; but I  think, now, it was pride.    \"From time to time she wrote to me. I learned that you still refused to  see your son, and I gathered, though she did not say much of this, that  things were going badly with them. At last, she wrote that her husband  was ill--very ill, she feared. He had, in vain, tried to get  employment. I don't think he was naturally strong, and the anxiety had  broken him down. Then I went up to London at once, and found them, in a  little room, without the necessaries of life. I brought them down home,  and nursed him for three months, till he died.    \"A week later, Aggie was born. Ten days afterwards, I laid her mother  by the side of her father. No answer had come to the letters he had  written to you, while he had been ill, though in the later ones he had  told you that he was dying. So, I looked upon the child as mine.    \"Things had gone badly with me. I had been able to take no lodgers,  while they were with me. I had got into debt, and even could I have  cleared myself, I could not well have kept the house on, without a  woman to look after it. I was restless, too, and longed to be moving  about. So I sold off the furniture, paid my debts, and laid by the  money that remained, for the child's use in the future.    \"I had, some time before, met an old comrade travelling the country  with a show. I happened to meet him again, just as I was leaving, and  he told me the name of a man, in London, who sold such things. I left  the child, for a year, with some people I knew, a few miles out of  Southampton; came up to London, bought a show, and started. It was  lonely work, at first; but, after a year, I fetched the child away, and  took her round the country with me, and for four years had a happy time  of it.    \"I had chosen this part of the country, and, after a time, I became  uneasy in my mind, as to whether I was doing right; and whether, for  the child's sake, I ought not to tell you that she was alive, and offer  to give her up, if you were willing to take her. I heard how your son's  death had changed you, and thought that, maybe, you would like to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17770"],[0,"Christmas Stories And Legends (#13)"],[1,"peak.

LITTLE GRETCHEN AND THE WOODEN SHOE[*]    By Elizabeth Harrison      Once upon a time, a long time ago, far away across the great ocean, in  a country called Germany, there could be seen a small log hut on the  edge of a great forest, whose fir trees extended for miles and miles  to the north. This little house, made of heavy hewn logs, had but one  room in it. A rough pine door gave entrance to this room, and a small  square window admitted the light. At the back of the house was built  an old-fashioned stone chimney, out of which in winter curled a thin,  blue smoke, showing that there was not very much fire within.    Small as the house was, it was large enough for two people who lived  in it. I want to tell you a story today about these two people. One  was an old gray-haired woman, so old that the little children of the  village, nearly half a mile away, often wondered whether she had come  into the world with the huge mountains and the giant fir trees, which  stood like giants back of her small hut. Her face was wrinkled all  over with deep lines, which, if the children could only have read  aright, would have told them of many years of cheerful, happy,  self-sacrifice; of loving, anxious, watching beside sick-beds; of  quiet endurance of pain, of many a day of hunger and cold, and of a  thousand deeds of unselfish love for other people; but, of course,  they could not read this strange handwriting. They only knew that she  was old and wrinkled, and that she stooped as she walked. None of  them seemed to fear her, for her smile was always cheerful, and she  had a kindly word for each of them if they chanced to meet her on her  way to and from the village. With this old, old woman lived a very  little girl. So bright and happy was she that the travellers who  passed by the lonesome little house on the edge of the forest often  thought of a sunbeam as they saw her. These two people were known in  the village as Granny Goodyear and Little Gretchen.    The winter had come and the frost had snapped off many of the smaller  branches of the pine trees in the forest. Gretchen and her granny were  up by daybreak each morning. After their simple breakfast of oatmeal,  Gretchen would run to the little closet and fetch Granny's old woolen  shawl, which seemed almost as old as Granny herself. Gretchen always  claimed the right to put the shawl over Granny's head, even though she  had to climb onto the wooden bench to do it. After carefully pinning  it under Granny's chin, she gave her a good-bye kiss, and Granny  started out for her morning's work in the forest. This work was  nothing more nor less than the gathering up of the twigs and branches  which the autumn winds and winter frosts had thrown upon the ground.  These were carefully gathered into a large bundle which Granny tied  together with a strong linen band. She then managed to lift the bundle  to her shoulder and trudged off to the village with it. Here she sold  the fagots for kindling wood to the people of the village. Sometimes  she would get only a few pence each day, and sometimes a dozen or  more, but on this money little Gretchen and she managed to live; they  had their home, and the forest kindly furnished the wood for the fire  which kept them warm in winter.    In the summer time Granny had a little garden at the back of the  house, where she raised, with little Gretchen's help, a few potatoes  and turnips and onions. These she carefully stored away for winter  use. To this meagre supply, the pennies, gained by selling the twigs  from the forest, added the oatmeal for Gretchen and a little black  coffee for Granny. Meat was a thing they never thought of having. It  cost too much money. Still, Granny and Gretchen were very happy,  because they loved each other dearly. Sometimes Gretchen would be left  alone all day long in the hut, because Granny would have some work to  do in the village after selling her bundle of sticks and twigs. It was  during these long days that little Gretchen had taught herself to sing  the song which the wind sang to the pine branches. In the summer time  she learned the chirp and twitter of the birds, until her voice might  almost be mistaken for a bird's voice, she learned to dance as the  swaying shadows did, and even to talk to the stars which shone through  the little square window when Granny came home late or too tired to  talk.    Sometimes, when the weather was fine, or her Granny had an extra  bundle of knitted stockings to take to the village, she would let  little Gretchen go along with her. It chanced that one of these trips  to the town came just the week before Christmas, and Gretchen's eyes  were delighted by the sight of the lovely Christmas trees which stood  in the window of the village store. It seemed to her that she would  never tire of looking at the knit dolls, the woolly lambs, the little  wooden shops with their queer, painted men and women in them, and all  the other fine things. She had never owned a plaything in her whole  life; therefore, toys which you and I would not think much of seemed  to her very beautiful.    That night, after their supper of baked potatoes was over, and little  Gretchen had cleared away the dishes and swept up the hearth, because  Granny dear was so tired, she brought her own little wooden stool and  placed it very near Granny's feet and sat down upon it, folding her  hands on her lap. Granny knew that this meant that she wanted to be  told about something, so she smilingly laid away the large Bible which  she had been reading, and took up her knitting, which was as much as  to say: \"Well, Gretchen, dear, Granny is ready to listen.\"    \"Granny,\" said Gretchen slowly, \"It's almost Christmas time, isn't  it?\"    \"Yes, dearie,\" said Granny, \"only five days more now,\" and then she  sighed, but little Gretchen was so happy that she did not notice  Granny's sigh.    \"What do you think, Granny, I'll get this Christmas?\" said she,  looking up eagerly into Granny's face.    \"Ah, child, child,\" said Granny, shaking her head, \"you'll have no  Christmas this year. We are too poor for that.\"    \"Oh, but Granny,\" interrupted little Gretchen, \"think of all the  beautiful toys we saw in the village today. Surely Santa Claus has  sent enough for every little child.\"    \"Ah, dearie, those toys are for people who can pay for them, and we  have no money to spend for Christmas toys.\"    \"Well, Granny,\" said Gretchen, \"perhaps some of the little children  who live in the great house on the hill at the other end of the  village, will be willing to share some of their toys with me. They  will be glad to give some to a little girl who has none.\"    \"Dear child, dear child,\" said Granny, leaning forward and stroking  the soft, shiny hair of the little girl, \"your heart is full of love.  You would be glad to bring a Christmas to every child; but their heads  are so full of what they are going to get that they forget all about  anybody else but themselves.\" Then she sighed and shook her head.    \"Well, Granny,\" said Gretchen, her bright, happy tone of voice growing  a little less joyous, \"perhaps the dear Santa Claus will show some of  the village children how to make presents that do not cost money, and  some of them may surprise me Christmas morning with a present. And,  Granny, dear,\" added she, springing up from her low stool, \"can't I  gather some of the pine branches and take them to the old sick man who  lives in the house by the mill, so that he can have the sweet smell of  our forest in his room all Christmas day?\"    \"Yes, dearie,\" said Granny, \"you may do what you can to make the  Christmas bright and happy, but you must not expect any present  yourself.\"    \"Oh, but, Granny,\" said little Gretchen, her face brightening, \"you  forgot all about the shining Christmas angels, who came down to earth  and sang their wonderful song the night the beautiful Christ-Child was  born! They are so loving and good that _they_ will not forget any  little child. I shall ask my dear stars tonight to tell them of us.  You know,\" she added, with a look of relief, \"the stars are so very  high that they must know the angels quite well as they come and go  with their messages from the loving God.\"    Granny sighed as she half whispered. \"Poor child, poor child!\" but  Gretchen threw her arm around Granny's neck and gave her a hearty  kiss, saying as she did so: \"Oh, Granny, Granny, you don't talk to the  stars often enough, else you would not be sad at Christmas time.\" Then  she danced all around the room, whirling her little skirts about her  to show Granny how the wind had made the snow dance that day. She  looked so droll "]]]
