CHAPTER IV    THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLONIAL NATIONALISM      It is one of the well-known facts of history that a people loosely  united by domestic ties of a political and economic nature, even a  people torn by domestic strife, may be welded into a solid and compact  body by an attack from a foreign power. The imperative call to common  defense, the habit of sharing common burdens, the fusing force of common  service--these things, induced by the necessity of resisting outside  interference, act as an amalgam drawing together all elements, except,  perhaps, the most discordant. The presence of the enemy allays the most  virulent of quarrels, temporarily at least. \"Politics,\" runs an old  saying, \"stops at the water's edge.\"    This ancient political principle, so well understood in diplomatic  circles, applied nearly as well to the original thirteen American  colonies as to the countries of Europe. The necessity for common  defense, if not equally great, was certainly always pressing. Though it  has long been the practice to speak of the early settlements as founded  in \"a wilderness,\" this was not actually the case. From the earliest  days of Jamestown on through the years, the American people were  confronted by dangers from without. All about their tiny settlements  were Indians, growing more and more hostile as the frontier advanced and  as sharp conflicts over land aroused angry passions. To the south and  west was the power of Spain, humiliated, it is true, by the disaster to  the Armada, but still presenting an imposing front to the British  empire. To the north and west were the French, ambitious, energetic,  imperial in temper, and prepared to contest on land and water the  advance of British dominion in America.      RELATIONS WITH THE INDIANS AND THE FRENCH    =Indian Affairs.=--It is difficult to make general statements about the  relations of the colonists to the Indians. The problem was presented in  different shape in different sections of America. It was not handled  according to any coherent or uniform plan by the British government,  which alone could speak for all the provinces at the same time. Neither  did the proprietors and the governors who succeeded one another, in an  irregular train, have the consistent policy or the matured experience  necessary for dealing wisely with Indian matters. As the difficulties  arose mainly on the frontiers, where the restless and pushing pioneers  were making their way with gun and ax, nearly everything that happened  was the result of chance rather than of calculation. A personal quarrel  between traders and an Indian, a jug of whisky, a keg of gunpowder, the  exchange of guns for furs, personal treachery, or a flash of bad temper  often set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible character.    On one side of the ledger may be set innumerable generous records--of  Squanto and Samoset teaching the Pilgrims the ways of the wilds; of  Roger Williams buying his lands from the friendly natives; or of William  Penn treating with them on his arrival in America. On the other side of  the ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the  frontier rolled westward with deadly precision. The Pequots on the  Connecticut border, sensing their doom, fell upon the tiny settlements  with awful fury in 1637 only to meet with equally terrible punishment. A  generation later, King Philip, son of Massasoit, the friend of the  Pilgrims, called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought  the strength of all New England to the field and ended in his own  destruction. In New York, the relations with the Indians, especially  with the Algonquins and the Mohawks, were marked by periodic and  desperate wars. Virginia and her Southern neighbors suffered as did New  England. In 1622 Opecacano, a brother of Powhatan, the friend of the  Jamestown settlers, launched a general massacre; and in 1644 he  attempted a war of extermination. In 1675 the whole frontier was ablaze.  Nathaniel Bacon vainly attempted to stir the colonial governor to put up  an adequate defense and, failing in that plea, himself headed a revolt  and a successful expedition against the Indians. As the Virginia  outposts advanced into the Kentucky country, the strife with the natives  was transferred to that \"dark and bloody ground\"; while to the  southeast, a desperate struggle with the Tuscaroras called forth the  combined forces of the two Carolinas and Virginia.    [Illustration: _From an old print._    VIRGINIANS DEFENDING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE INDIANS]    From such horrors New Jersey and Delaware were saved on account of their  geographical location. Pennsylvania, consistently following a policy of  conciliation, was likewise spared until her western vanguard came into  full conflict with the allied French and Indians. Georgia, by clever  negotiations and treaties of alliance, managed to keep on fair terms  with her belligerent Cherokees and Creeks. But neither diplomacy nor  generosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced,  especially after the French soldiers enlisted the Indians in their  imperial enterprises. It was then that desultory fighting became general  warfare.    [Illustration: ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND SPANISH POSSESSIONS IN AMERICA,  1750]    =Early Relations with the French.=--During the first decades of French  exploration and settlement in the St. Lawrence country, the English  colonies, engrossed with their own problems, gave little or no thought  to their distant neighbors. Quebec, founded in 1608, and Montreal, in  1642, were too far away, too small in population, and too slight in  strength to be much of a menace to Boston, Hartford, or New York. It was  the statesmen in France and England, rather than the colonists in  America, who first grasped the significance of the slowly converging  empires in North America. It was the ambition of Louis XIV of France,  rather than the labors of Jesuit missionaries and French rangers, that  sounded the first note of colonial alarm.    Evidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the  English and the French occurred before their advancing frontiers met on  the Pennsylvania border. King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's  War (1701-1713), and King George's War (1744-1748) owed their origins  and their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of European  powers, although they all involved the American colonies in struggles  with the French and their savage allies.    =The Clash in the Ohio Valley.=--The second of these wars had hardly  closed, however, before the English colonists themselves began to be  seriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding French dominion in the  West. Marquette and Joliet, who opened the Lake region, and La Salle,  who in 1682 had gone down the Mississippi to the Gulf, had been followed  by the builders of forts. In 1718, the French founded New Orleans, thus  taking possession of the gateway to the Mississippi as well as the St.  Lawrence. A few years later they built Fort Niagara; in 1731 they  occupied Crown Point; in 1749 they formally announced their dominion  over all the territory drained by the Ohio River. Having asserted this  lofty claim, they set out to make it good by constructing in the years  1752-1754 Fort Le Boeuf near Lake Erie, Fort Venango on the upper  waters of the Allegheny, and Fort Duquesne at the junction of the  streams forming the Ohio. Though they were warned by George Washington,  in the name of the governor of Virginia, to keep out of territory \"so  notoriously known to be property of the crown of Great Britain,\" the  French showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions.    [Illustration: _From an old print_    BRADDOCK'S RETREAT]    =The Final Phase--the French and Indian War.=--Thus it happened that the  shot which opened the Seven Years' War, known in America as the French  and Indian War, was fired in the wilds of Pennsylvania. There began the  conflict that spread to Europe and even Asia and finally involved  England and Prussia, on the one side, and France, Austria, Spain, and  minor powers on the other. On American soil, the defeat of Braddock in  1755 and Wolfe's exploit in capturing Quebec four years later were the  dramatic features. On the continent of Europe, England subsidized  Prussian arms to hold France at bay. In India, on the banks of the  Ganges, as on the banks of the St. Lawrence, British arms were  triumphant. Well could the historian write: \"Conquests equaling in  rapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of Cortes and Pizarro had  been achieved in the East.\" Well could the merchants of London declare  that under the administration of William Pitt, the imperial genius of  this world-wide conflict, commerce had been \"united with and made to  flourish by war.\"    From the point of view of the British empire, the results of the war  were momentous. By the peace of 1763, Canada and the territory east of  the Mississippi, except New Orleans, passed under the British flag. The  remainder of the Louisiana territory was transferred to Spain and French  imperial ambitions on the American continent were laid to rest. In  exchange for Havana, which the British had seized during the war, Spain  ceded to King George the colony of Florida.

Inform their minds, refine their habits, and you form  and refine their designs; but keep them illiterate, uncomfortable,  and in the midst of unbeautiful things, and whatever they do will  still be spurious, vulgar, and valueless.\"    At the time, however, the Exhibition proved a great success, and the  Duke of Coburg carried most favourable impressions away with him.  He says: \"The Queen and her husband were at the zenith of their  fame. . . . Prince Albert was not satisfied to guide the whole affair  only from above; he was, in the fullest sense of the word, the soul  of everything. Even his bitterest enemies, with unusual unreserve,  acknowledged the completeness of the execution of the scheme.\"    So far from there being a loss upon the undertaking there was actually  half a million of profit. The proceeds were devoted to securing  ground at South Kensington upon which a great National Institute  might be built. This undertaking (the purchase of the ground) was  not carried through without great difficulty and anxiety. The  Queen's sympathy and encouragement were, as always, of the greatest  help to her husband, and he quoted a verse from a German song, to  illustrate how much he felt and appreciated it:        When man has well nigh lost his hope in life,      Upwards in trust and love still looks the wife,      Towards the starry world all bright with cheer,      Faint not nor fear, thus speaks her shining tear.    The Great Exhibition was sufficient proof--if any had been  needed--of how the Prince with his wife laboured incessantly for the  good of others. Without his courage, perseverance, and ability there  is no doubt that this great undertaking would never have been carried  through successfully. He recognized the fact that princes live for  the benefit of their people; his desire for the improvement in all  classes was never-ending, and from him his wife learnt many lessons  which proved of the greatest value to her in later life when she stood  alone and her husband was no longer there to aid her with his  unfailing wise advice.    A second Exhibition was held in 1862, and so far as decorative art  was concerned there were distinct signs of improvement. 'Art  manufacture' had now become a trade phrase, but manufacturers were  still far from understanding what 'Art' really meant. As an instance  of this, one carpet firm sent a carpet to be used as a hanging on  which Napoleon III is depicted presenting a treaty of Commerce  to the Queen. Particular attention had apparently been paid to the  'shine' on Napoleon's top boots and to the Queen's smile!    The Prince's great wish was to restore to the workman his pride in  the work of his hands, to relieve the daily toil of some of its  irksomeness by the interest thus created in it, and, where the work  was of a purely mechanical nature, and individual skill and judgment  were not called for, he wished the worker to understand the  principles upon which the machine was built and the ingenuity with  which it worked.    His schemes for the building and equipment of Museums of Science and  Art were arranged with the purpose in view that both rich and  poor should have equal opportunities of seeing what improvements had  been made throughout the ages, and how vast and far-reaching the  effects of such improvements were on the lives of the whole nation.    It was under his direction that the pictures in the National Gallery  were first arranged in such a manner as to show the history and  progress of art. In his own words: \"Our business is not so much to  create, as to learn to appreciate and understand the works of others,  and we can never do this till we have realized the difficulties to  be overcome. Acting on this principle myself, I have always tried  to learn the rudiments of art as much as possible. For instance, I  learnt oil-painting, water-colours, etching, lithography, etc., and  in music I learnt thorough bass, the pianoforte, organ, and  singing--not, of course, with a view of doing anything worth looking  at or hearing, but simply to enable me to judge and appreciate the  works of others.\"    It is interesting to note how closely the views of the Prince agreed  with those of John Ruskin in matters of art and literature. Ruskin  declared that it was the greatest misfortune of the age that, owing  to the wholesale introduction of machinery, the designer and maker  were nearly always different people instead of being one and the same  person. He declared that no work of art could really be 'living' or  capable of moving us to admiration as did the masterpieces of the  Middle Ages unless the maker had thought out and designed it himself.    It was largely owing to his teachings that the 'Arts and Crafts'  movement under William Morris and Walter Crane arose--a movement  which has since that time spread over the whole civilized world.    In 1862, together with some of his friends, Morris formed a company  to encourage the use of beautiful furniture and to introduce 'Art  in the House.' Morris himself had learnt to be a practical  carpet-weaver and dyer, and had founded the Society for the  Protection of Ancient Buildings.    All the work of this firm was done by hand as far as possible; only  the best materials were to be used and designs were to be original.  They manufactured stained glass, wall paper, tapestry, tiles,  embroidery, carpets, etc., and many of the designs were undertaken  by Edward Burne-Jones.    Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the poet-painter, Holman Hunt (best  remembered by his famous picture \"The Light of the World \") and others,  formed what was known as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, to instruct  public taste in creative work in art and literature. At the Kelmscott  Press some of the most beautiful printed books of their kind were  produced under the direction of Morris.    Ruskin, like so many others of his time, was greatly influenced by  Carlyle, and his views on the 'condition of England' question were  practically the same. He bewailed the waste of work and of life, the  poverty and the 'sweating.' He urged employers to win the goodwill  of those who worked for them as the best means of producing the best  work. He preached the 'rights' of Labour--that high wages for good  work was the truest economy in the end, and that beating down the  wages of workers does not pay in the long run. He declared that the  only education worth having was a 'humane' education--that is, first  of all, the building of character and the cultivation of wholesome  feelings. \"You do not educate a man by telling him what he knew not,  but by making him what he was not,\" was the theory which he  endeavoured to put into practice by experiments such as an attempt  to teach every one to \"learn to do something well and accurately with  his hands.\"    In common with Wordsworth Ruskin held that the love of Nature was  the greatest of educators. He believed that        The world is too much with us; late and soon,      Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers.    The beauty and the everlasting marvel of Nature's works were, to him  as to the poet of the Lakes, the real road to knowledge:        Come forth into the light of things,      Let Nature be your teacher.    An education of not the brain alone, but of heart and hand as well,  all three working in co-operation, was necessary to raise man to the  level of an intelligent being.    Ruskin's teachings fared no better than those of Carlyle at first,  and though he is spoken of sometimes as being 'old-fashioned,' yet  his lesson is of the old-fashioned kind which does live and will live,  for, like Dickens, he knew how to appeal to the hearts of his readers.  He is one of the most picturesque writers in the language, a man of  great nobility of character and generous feelings, who had a  tremendous belief in himself and knew how to express his thoughts  in the most beautiful language. Some of his books, for example  _Sesame and Lilies_ and _Unto this Last_, are probably destined for  immortality.          CHAPTER XI: _Albert the Good_      The year 1861 was a black year for the Queen. On March 15th her mother,  the Duchess of Kent, died. She had been living for some time at  Frogmore, a pleasant house in the Windsor Home Park, and here in the  mausoleum erected by her daughter her statue is to be seen.    She was sincerely loved by every member of her household, and her  loss was felt as one affecting the whole nation. In the words of  Disraeli: \"She who reigns over us has elected, amid all the splendour  of empire, to establish her life on the principle of domestic love.  It is this, it is the remembrance and consciousness of this, which  now sincerely saddens the public spirit, and permits a nation to bear  its heartfelt sympathy to the foot of a bereaved throne, and to  whisper solace to a royal heart.\"    The death of the Queen's' mother came as a great shock to the Prince  Consort. The Queen was, for a time, utterly unable to transact any  business, and this added to his already heavy burden of cares and  responsibilities.    In the following November the King of Portugal died. The Prince had  loved him like a son, and this fresh disaster told so severely upon  his health that he began to suffer much from sleeplessness. The  strain of almost ceaseless work for many years was gradually wearing  him out.    He had never been afraid of death, and not long before his last  illness he had said to his wife: \"I do not cling to life. You do;  but I set no store by it. If I knew that those I love were well cared  for, I should be quite ready to die to-morrow. . . . I am sure, if  I had a severe illness, I should give up at once, I should not struggle  for life.\"    On the 1st of December the Queen felt anxious and depressed. Her  husband grew worse and could not take food without considerable  difficulty, and this"]]]
