But I still don't enjoy getting Sallie's letters about  the good times they are having in camp!    However--we will draw a veil over that and begin again.    I've been writing and writing this summer; four short stories finished  and sent to four different magazines.  So you see I'm trying to be an  author.  I have a workroom fixed in a corner of the attic where Master  Jervie used to have his rainy-day playroom.  It's in a cool, breezy  corner with two dormer windows, and shaded by a maple tree with a  family of red squirrels living in a hole.    I'll write a nicer letter in a few days and tell you all the farm news.    We need rain.                                   Yours as ever,                                                     Judy                                                         10th August    Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs,    SIR:  I address you from the second crotch in the willow tree by the  pool in the pasture.  There's a frog croaking underneath, a locust  singing overhead and two little 'devil downheads' darting up and down  the trunk.  I've been here for an hour; it's a very comfortable crotch,  especially after being upholstered with two sofa cushions.  I came up  with a pen and tablet hoping to write an immortal short story, but I've  been having a dreadful time with my heroine--I CAN'T make her behave as  I want her to behave; so I've abandoned her for the moment, and am  writing to you.  (Not much relief though, for I can't make you behave  as I want you to, either.)    If you are in that dreadful New York, I wish I could send you some of  this lovely, breezy, sunshiny outlook.  The country is Heaven after a  week of rain.    Speaking of Heaven--do you remember Mr. Kellogg that I told you about  last summer?--the minister of the little white church at the Corners.  Well, the poor old soul is dead--last winter of pneumonia.  I went half  a dozen times to hear him preach and got very well acquainted with his  theology.  He believed to the end exactly the same things he started  with.  It seems to me that a man who can think straight along for  forty-seven years without changing a single idea ought to be kept in a  cabinet as a curiosity.  I hope he is enjoying his harp and golden  crown; he was so perfectly sure of finding them!  There's a new young  man, very consequential, in his place.  The congregation is pretty  dubious, especially the faction led by Deacon Cummings.  It looks as  though there was going to be an awful split in the church.  We don't  care for innovations in religion in this neighbourhood.    During our week of rain I sat up in the attic and had an orgy of  reading--Stevenson, mostly.  He himself is more entertaining than any  of the characters in his books; I dare say he made himself into the  kind of hero that would look well in print.  Don't you think it was  perfect of him to spend all the ten thousand dollars his father left,  for a yacht, and go sailing off to the South Seas?  He lived up to his  adventurous creed.  If my father had left me ten thousand dollars, I'd  do it, too.  The thought of Vailima makes me wild.  I want to see the  tropics.  I want to see the whole world.  I am going to be a great  author, or artist, or actress, or playwright--or whatever sort of a  great person I turn out to be.  I have a terrible wanderthirst; the  very sight of a map makes me want to put on my hat and take an umbrella  and start.  'I shall see before I die the palms and temples of the  South.'                                       Thursday evening at twilight,                                 sitting on the doorstep.    Very hard to get any news into this letter!  Judy is becoming so  philosophical of late, that she wishes to discourse largely of the  world in general, instead of descending to the trivial details of daily  life.  But if you MUST have news, here it is:    Our nine young pigs waded across the brook and ran away last Tuesday,  and only eight came back.  We don't want to accuse anyone unjustly, but  we suspect that Widow Dowd has one more than she ought to have.    Mr. Weaver has painted his barn and his two silos a bright pumpkin  yellow--a very ugly colour, but he says it will wear.    The Brewers have company this week; Mrs. Brewer's sister and two nieces  from Ohio.    One of our Rhode Island Reds only brought off three chicks out of  fifteen eggs.  We can't imagine what was the trouble.  Rhode island  Reds, in my opinion, are a very inferior breed.  I prefer Buff  Orpingtons.    The new clerk in the post office at Bonnyrigg Four Corners drank every  drop of Jamaica ginger they had in stock--seven dollars' worth--before  he was discovered.    Old Ira Hatch has rheumatism and can't work any more; he never saved  his money when he was earning good wages, so now he has to live on the  town.    There's to be an ice-cream social at the schoolhouse next Saturday  evening.  Come and bring your families.    I have a new hat that I bought for twenty-five cents at the post  office.  This is my latest portrait, on my way to rake the hay.    It's getting too dark to see; anyway, the news is all used up.                                   Good night,                                                 Judy                                                             Friday    Good morning!  Here is some news!  What do you think?  You'd never,  never, never guess who's coming to Lock Willow.  A letter to Mrs.  Semple from Mr. Pendleton.  He's motoring through the Berkshires, and  is tired and wants to rest on a nice quiet farm--if he climbs out at  her doorstep some night will she have a room ready for him?  Maybe  he'll stay one week, or maybe two, or maybe three; he'll see how  restful it is when he gets here.    Such a flutter as we are in!  The whole house is being cleaned and all  the curtains washed.  I am driving to the Corners this morning to get  some new oilcloth for the entry, and two cans of brown floor paint for  the hall and back stairs.  Mrs. Dowd is engaged to come tomorrow to  wash the windows (in the exigency of the moment, we waive our  suspicions in regard to the piglet). You might think, from this account  of our activities, that the house was not already immaculate; but I  assure you it was!  Whatever Mrs. Semple's limitations, she is a  HOUSEKEEPER.    But isn't it just like a man, Daddy?  He doesn't give the remotest hint  as to whether he will land on the doorstep today, or two weeks from  today.  We shall live in a perpetual breathlessness until he comes--and  if he doesn't hurry, the cleaning may all have to be done over again.    There's Amasai waiting below with the buckboard and Grover.  I drive  alone--but if you could see old Grove, you wouldn't be worried as to my  safety.    With my hand on my heart--farewell.                                                       Judy      PS.  Isn't that a nice ending?  I got it out of Stevenson's letters.                                                            Saturday    Good morning again!  I didn't get this ENVELOPED yesterday before the  postman came, so I'll add some more.  We have one mail a day at twelve  o'clock. Rural delivery is a blessing to the farmers!  Our postman not  only delivers letters, but he runs errands for us in town, at five  cents an errand.  Yesterday he brought me some shoe-strings and a jar  of cold cream (I sunburned all the skin off my nose before I got my new  hat) and a blue Windsor tie and a bottle of blacking all for ten cents.  That was an unusual bargain, owing to the largeness of my order.    Also he tells us what is happening in the Great World.  Several people  on the route take daily papers, and he reads them as he jogs along, and  repeats the news to the ones who don't subscribe.  So in case a war  breaks out between the United States and Japan, or the president is  assassinated, or Mr. Rockefeller leaves a million dollars to the John  Grier Home, you needn't bother to write; I'll hear it anyway.    No sign yet of Master Jervie.  But you should see how clean our house  is--and with what anxiety we wipe our feet before we step in!    I hope he'll come soon; I am longing for someone to talk to.  Mrs.  Semple, to tell you the truth, gets rather monotonous.  She never lets  ideas interrupt the easy flow of her conversation.  It's a funny thing  about the people here.  Their world is just this single hilltop.  They  are not a bit universal, if you know what I mean.  It's exactly the  same as at the John Grier Home.  Our ideas there were bounded by the  four sides of the iron fence, only I didn't mind it so much because I  was younger, and was so awfully busy.  By the time I'd got all my beds  made and my babies' faces washed and had gone to school and come home  and had washed their faces again and darned their stockings and mended  Freddie Perkins's trousers (he tore them every day of his life) and  learned my lessons in between--I was ready to go to bed, and I didn't  notice any lack of social intercourse.  But after two years in a  conversational college, I do miss it; and I shall be glad to see  somebody who speaks my language.    I really believe I've finished, Daddy.  Nothing else occurs to me at  the moment--I'll try to write a longer letter next time.                               Yours always,                                             Judy      PS.  The lettuce hasn't done at all well this year.  It was so dry  early in the season.                                                             25th August    Well, Daddy, Master Jervie's here.  And such a nice time as we're  having!  At least I am, and I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15707"],[0,"Zoonomia; Or, the Laws of Organic Life, Vol. I (#13)"],[1,"observed, there appears no difference in the velocity or force of it  at its commencement or at its termination; from whence we must conclude  that animal contraction is governed by laws of its own, and not by those of  mechanics, chemistry, magnetism, or electricity.    On these accounts I do not think the experiments conclusive, which were  lately published by Galvani, Volta, and others, to shew a similitude  between the spirit of animation, which contracts the muscular fibres, and  the electric fluid. Since the electric fluid may act only as a more potent  stimulus exciting the muscular fibres into action, and not by supplying  them with a new quantity of the spirit of life. Thus in a recent hemiplegia  I have frequently observed, when the patient yawned and stretched himself,  that the paralytic limbs moved also, though they were totally disobedient  to the will. And when he was electrified by passing shocks from the  affected hand to the affected foot, a motion of the paralytic limbs was  also produced. Now as in the act of yawning the muscles of the paralytic  limbs were excited into action by the stimulus of the irksomeness of a  continued posture, and not by any additional quantity of the spirit of  life; so we may conclude, that the passage of the electric fluid, which  produced a similar effect, acted only as a stimulus, and not by supplying  any addition of sensorial power.    If nevertheless this theory should ever become established, a stimulus must  be called an eductor of vital ether; which stimulus may consist of  sensation or volition, as in the electric eel, as well as in the appulses  of external bodies; and by drawing off the charges of vital fluid may  occasion the contraction or motions of the muscular fibres, and organs of  sense.    2. The immediate effect of the action of the spirit of animation or  sensorial power on the fibrous parts of the body, whether it acts in the  mode of irritation, sensation, volition, or association, is a contraction  of the animal fibre, according to the second law of animal causation. Sect.  IV. Thus the stimulus of the blood induces the contraction of the heart;  the agreeable taste of a strawberry produces the contraction of the muscles  of deglutition; the effort of the will contracts the muscles, which move  the limbs in walking; and by association other muscles of the trunk are  brought into contraction to preserve the balance of the body. The fibrous  extremities of the organs of sense have been shewn, by the ocular spectra  in Sect. III. to suffer similar contraction by each of the above modes of  excitation; and by their configurations to constitute our ideas.    3. After animal fibres have for some time been excited into contraction, a  relaxation succeeds, even though the exciting cause continues to act. In  respect to the irritative motions this is exemplified in the peristaltic  contractions of the bowels; which cease and are renewed alternately, though  the stimulus of the aliment continues to be uniformly applied; in the  sensitive motions, as in strangury, tenesmus, and parturition, the  alternate contractions and relaxations of the muscles exist, though the  stimulus is perpetual. In our voluntary exertions it is experienced, as no  one can hang long by the hands, however vehemently he wills so to do; and  in the associate motions the constant change of our attitudes evinces the  necessity of relaxation to those muscles, which have been long in action.    This relaxation of a muscle after its contraction, even though the stimulus  continues to be applied, appears to arise from the expenditure or  diminution of the spirit of animation previously resident in the muscle,  according to the second law of animal causation in Sect. IV. In those  constitutions, which are termed weak, the spirit of animation becomes  sooner exhausted, and tremulous motions are produced, as in the hands of  infirm people, when they lift a cup to their mouths. This quicker  exhaustion of the spirit of animation is probably owing to a less quantity  of it residing in the acting fibres, which therefore more frequently  require a supply from the nerves, which belong to them.    4. If the sensorial power continues to act, whether it acts in the mode of  irritation, sensation, volition, or association, a new contraction of the  animal fibre succeeds after a certain interval; which interval is of  shorter continuance in weak people than in strong ones. This is exemplified  in the shaking of the hands of weak people, when they attempt to write. In  a manuscript epistle of one of my correspondents, which is written in a  small hand, I observed from four to six zigzags in the perpendicular stroke  of every letter, which shews that both the contractions of the fingers, and  intervals between them, must have been performed in very short periods of  time.    The times of contraction of the muscles of enfeebled people being less, and  the intervals between those contractions being less also, accounts for the  quick pulse in fevers with debility, and in dying animals. The shortness of  the intervals between one contraction and another in weak constitutions, is  probably owing to the general deficiency of the quantity of the spirit of  animation, and that therefore there is a less quantity of it to be received  at each interval of the activity of the fibres. Hence in repeated motions,  as of the fingers in performing on the harpsichord, it would at first sight  appear, that swiftness and strength were incompatible; nevertheless the  single contraction of a muscle is performed with greater velocity as well  as with greater force by vigorous constitutions, as in throwing a javelin.    There is however another circumstance, which may often contribute to cause  the quickness of the pulse in nervous fevers, as in animals bleeding to  death in the slaughter-house; which is the deficient quantity of blood;  whence the heart is but half distended, and in consequence sooner  contracts. See Sect. XXXII. 2. 1.    For we must not confound frequency of repetition with quickness of motion,  or the number of pulsations with the velocity, with which the fibres, which  constitute the coats of the arteries, contract themselves. For where the  frequency of the pulsations is but seventy-five in a minute, as in health;  the contracting fibres, which constitute the sides of the arteries, may  move through a greater space in a given time, than where the frequency of  pulsation is one hundred and fifty in a minute, as in some fevers with  great debility. For if in those fevers the arteries do not expand  themselves in their diastole to more than half the usual diameter of their  diastole in health, the fibres which constitute their coats, will move  through a less space in a minute than in health, though they make two  pulsations for one.    Suppose the diameter of the artery during its systole to be one line, and  that the diameter of the same artery during its diastole is in health is  four lines, and in a fever with, great debility only two lines. It follows,  that the arterial fibres contract in health from a circle of twelve lines  in circumference to a circle of three lines in circumference, that is they  move through a space of nine lines in length. While the arterial fibres in  the fever with debility would twice contract from a circle of six lines to  a circle of three lines; that is while they move through a space equal to  six lines. Hence though the frequency of pulsation in fever be greater as  two to one, yet the velocity of contraction in health is greater as nine to  six, or as three to two.    On the contrary in inflammatory diseases with strength, as in the pleurisy,  the velocity of the contracting sides of the arteries is much greater than  in health, for if we suppose the number of pulsations in a pleurisy to be  half as much more than in health, that is as one hundred and twenty to  eighty, (which is about what generally happens in inflammatory diseases)  and if the diameter of the artery in diastole be one third greater than in  health, which I believe is near the truth, the result will be, that the  velocity of the contractile sides of the arteries will be in a pleurisy as  two and a half to one, compared to the velocity of their contraction in a  state of health, for if the circumference of the systole of the artery be  three lines, and the diastole in health be twelve lines in circumference,  and in a pleurisy eighteen lines; and secondly, if the artery pulsates  thrice in the diseased state for twice in the healthy one, it follows, that  the velocity of contraction in the diseased state to that in the healthy  state will be forty-five to eighteen, or as two and a half to one.    From hence it would appear, that if we had a criterion to determine the  velocity of the arterial contractions, it would at the same time give us  their strength, and thus be of more service in distinguishing diseases,  than the knowledge of their frequency. As such a criterion cannot be had,  the frequency of pulsation, the age of the patient being allowed for, will  in some measure assist us to distinguish arterial strength from arterial  debility, since in inflammatory diseases with strength the frequency seldom  exceeds one hundred and eighteen or one hundred and twenty pulsations in a  minute; unless under peculiar circumstance, as the great additional stimuli  of wine or of external heat.    5. After a muscle or organ of sense has been excited into contraction, and  the sensorial power ceases to act, the last situation or configuration of  it continues; unless it be disturbed by the action of some antagonist  fibres, or other extraneous power. Thus in weak or languid people, wherever  they throw their limbs on their bed or sofa, there they lie, till another  exertion changes their attitude; hence one kind of ocular spectra seems to  be produced after looking at bright objects; thus when a fire-"]]]
