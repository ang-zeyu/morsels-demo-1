His highness also related several  interesting things of Aghadez. The Sultan of that place, he says, is a  descendant of one of three brothers, Shereefs, who ruled in Africa over  the negro and other races. The eldest brother was Sultan of the West  (Morocco); the next was Sultan of Bornou; and the third and youngest was  Sultan of Aghadez in remote times. But how remote, it is impossible for  En-Noor to tell, and, of course, for me to relate. I was much amazed by  the predilection of En-Noor (who is not absolutely a white man) for  black people. He praised Overweg, because he was getting brown and  black. As for me, his highness was almost inclined to express his  disgust for the whiteness of my skin. Unfortunately, I happen to be what  the people call in England \"very fair,\" except in those parts of my skin  which come in direct contact with the sun. I spent the day in compiling  a Haussa vocabulary, and hope to make considerable progress by the time  we arrive in Damerghou.    _3d._--This was my birthday, but of course it was unkept, and, indeed,  almost unthought of until it was past.    En-Noor again visited us, and drank with us coffee. His highness is  getting quite attached to my tent, and swears that when I return to my  country I must become a great man, and be made, like himself, a governor  or sultan of some country. Shall I say, Inshallah? I asked Yusuf to  explain why the Sultan thought so, and I could only learn that it was  the opinion which his highness had formed from my general conduct.    Being in a very happy humour to-day, the Sultan related many things of  his youth; his exploits, of course, which all men relate, and which I  shall likewise do, I imagine, if I live to be old. Showing us his  withered fleshless arms, and taking hold of his armlets, he observed:  \"The time was when these armlets could not slip off. Now, see how easily  they come away.\" He then abused me for my leanness, and admired the  Taleb (Overweg), because he had more flesh on his bones. His highness  also stated that he and a single man went to Damerghou and back in  thirteen days, bringing a caravan of ghaseb. They never stopped on the  road, but travelled day and night. This garrulous gentleman also  declared he was the maker of his own fortunes--that he would not receive  anything from his father. When he was young, he would take no person's  advice; he did everything himself and from himself: but on the death of  his father he always kept to his post as Sheikh of Tintalous, and Sultan  of two towns in Soudan. He never moved this way or that way. Thus he has  remained to a good old age, respected and venerated by all, whilst all  his compeers have disappeared--not one remaining. He looks around for  the friends and companions of his youth, and finds not one--they are all  gone! Even now he allows no one in Asben to be greater than himself.  Even if a Sultan presumes to lord it over him, he (En-Noor) at once  knocks him down, and he is no longer Sultan in Asben. He remains,  however, friends with all if he can. He never takes notice of anything  which is not done under his own eyes; but when he sees a bad thing  committed, he then acts--killing the wicked people, if necessary.    The opinion of his highness of women does not flatter the ladies. He  recommended us never to listen to the advice of our wives; if we did, we  should be lost. The women were very well to fetch water, pound ghaseb,  and cook the supper, but for nothing else. He never, himself, paid any  attention to what they said; they were awful talkers. His highness here  touched on a tender point; for, as the reader remembers, he has been  beating one of his wives shamefully lately, because he pretended he was  alarmed at her continual talking--bewildered by the length of her  tongue! Proceeding in his confessions, the Sultan next related wonderful  stories of a wonderful maharee which he had in his youth. With this  maharee he rode to Aghadez in one day. With this maharee he chased, and  run down, and won gazelles, and then cooked and ate them, &c. Glorious  old fellow! Our Tanelkum Mousa, however, afterwards observed, that this  was _kitheb_, \"a lie;\" but that he knew a woman who could catch  gazelles. Many other things of equal interest his highness related, and  then left us in a good humour.    Two of our camels strayed this evening. En-Noor's people soon brought  them back. Our servants are very careless, and all our mishaps are a  profit to the Kailouees. We have still, however, two camels lost, and, I  imagine, shall not now recover them. But I was glad to hear the news  that the Sultan of Asoudee was successfully chastising all the people  who on the road attacked us. He had punished the people of Azaghar and  of Seloufeeat, even the son of Haj Bashaw; and the Haj himself, who was  said to be our friend, because he did not look after his son. The Sultan  acts quite according to my opinion, making all the principal people of  Seloufeeat and other places responsible for the conduct of the poorer  and lower classes. It is said that the Fadeea have fled; but others say  that they have been captured, and all our property which could be found  seized in the name of the Sultan of Asoudee. All the steps taken by this  Sultan have been directed, more or less, by En-Noor. He can muster, it  is said, two thousand warriors--for every able-bodied man fights in this  country. This expedition may be useful for future travellers from  Europe, but I fear we shall get back none of our property.    As a specimen of the political news strained through the brains of the  people of Tuat, I may mention that the Tuatee, recently arrived here,  reports that \"the King of the Frenchmen has run away to England, and  carried with him all the money of the French,\" and, moreover, that \"as  the French conquered Algiers by distributing large dollars to every one,  and hold it by the same means, the French now having no money, must soon  relinquish Algiers again to the hands of the Muslims.\"    _4th._--The weather is getting colder and colder. The last few days have  been quite chilly, with a strong wind blowing from the east. This  morning it was quite uncomfortable, the thermometer having fallen for  the first time to 60 deg. at sunset. We started early, and made seven hours  in a south-eastern direction. It was a nice ride; but as the day  advanced we got much sunburnt. After three hours we passed on the left  the little village Zouazgher. The caravan showed again very  picturesquely, the burdens tumbling off from the donkeys in the most  delightful confusion, and the girls squalling for help. I ate on the  road some Soudan dates, as they are called by the Arabs, and found them  pleasant--a sort of bitter sweet. The name of the tree and of the fruit  is, in Bornou, _bitu_. In Haussa the tree has two names, _aduwa_ and  _tinku_. Our course to day was up a fine valley, down which the water in  the rainy season runs from east to west. There was abundance of trees  and herbage. At this place, however, lions abound, and last night a  camel was eaten by them. We encamped opposite a mountain, rising pretty  high in sugar-loaf shape, called Adudai. Over the carcase of the camel  hovered a small flock of eagles.    A Bornouee fighi, called Mustapha, from the country Malamdi, west of  Kuka, tells us he has been six months at Aghadez. According to him, the  route from Aghadez to Timbuctoo is one month. It is open, and not  dangerous. En-Noor, indeed, promised to send any of us by that route if  we wished. There are few people on the route, and if you pay them a  little money you pass unmolested. This Bornouese fighi is not equal to  his brethren whom I saw in Tintalous. But I learnt from this itinerant  pedagogue the interesting fact, that there are a great number of persons  of his profession, all from Bornou, travelling about in Aheer. Light,  therefore, is springing up from the interior, and spreading to the coast  in an opposite direction to what it did in former times.    _5th._--Warmer weather greeted us this morning. We stay here to-day. The  place is called Tin-Tagannu, and is a large wady, full of herbage and  trees. It is inhabited by a few shepherds. This place is said to have  been the first of the inhabited localities in Aheer, although now  shepherds only drive their flocks there; so that spots of earth have  their seasons and fortunes in the Sahara as elsewhere. By the way, I  must continue to call this Sahara. Although there are periodic rains, we  are still without the influences of the Soudan climate, which begins at  Damerghou and Zinder. At the present season no country can be more  healthy than these Asbenouee valleys. I hear that nearly all the women,  as well as the men, have left Tintalous, so that the town is a perfect  desert. En-Noor has brought his wives and daughters, and our caravan is  like the migration of the whole of the town going in quest of a new  country.    A trap was set last night for the lion, but the king of beasts was too  wise to be caught. En-Noor borrowed a gun of us to make this trap, which  was of the following description. It was expected that the lion would  come again to the carcase of the camel; so a hedge of thorns was made  round the carcase with one opening, where was placed the muzzle of the  gun, with a large piece of meat tied to the trigger, so that when he  seized the meat he might fire off the deadly weapon against himself.    This is a fine place for doves, and Overweg shot half a dozen to-day.  Our Tanelkum, Mousa, informs us of the right way of tending camels. They  ought never to be tied, but allowed to roam at large. They require also  to be led through the best valleys, being so far helpless in finding a  good grazing-place for themselves. He showed us his camels, comparing  them with ours. And certainly ours, which had their legs tied and were  not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18556"],[0,"Catalogue of Violent and Destructive Earthquakes in the Philippines (#13)"],[1,"the two following days      |                    |     |were feeble.      |                    |     |    9 |1902   IX 22 11 15  |  IX |Destructive earthquake which wrecked or      |                    |     |damaged very seriously all the buildings      |                    |     |at Agana, Guam.
