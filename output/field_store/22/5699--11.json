He then  returned and passed the third winter in Ericsey at the mouth of  Ericsfirth. The next summer he sailed to Iceland, landing in Breidafirth.  He called the country, which he had discovered, Greenland, because, he  said, people would be attracted thither, if the country had a good name.  Eric spent the winter in Iceland, and the following summer set out to  colonize the country. He settled at Brattahlid in Ericsfirth, and learned  men say, that in this same summer, in which Eric set out to settle  Greenland, thirty-five ships sailed out of Breidafirth and Borgarfirth;  fourteen of these arrived there safely, some were driven back and some  were lost. This was fifteen years before Christianity was legally adopted  in Iceland.[46-1] During the same summer Bishop Frederick[46-2] and  Thorvald Kodransson went abroad [from Iceland]. Of those men, who  accompanied Eric to Greenland, the following took possession of land  there: Heriulf, Heriulfsfirth, he dwelt at Heriulfsness; Ketil,  Ketilsfirth; Hrafn, Hrafnsfirth; Solvi, Solvadal; Helgi Thorbrandsson,  Alptafirth; Thorbiorn Gleamer, Siglufirth; Einar, Einarsfirth; Hafgrim,  Hafgrimsfirth and Vatnahverfi; Arnlaug, Arnlaugsfirth; while some went to  the Western Settlement.    _Leif the Lucky Baptized._--After that sixteen winters had lapsed, from  the time when Eric the Red went to colonize Greenland, Leif, Eric's son,  sailed out from Greenland to Norway. He arrived in Drontheim in the  autumn, when King Olaf Tryggvason was come down from the north, out of  Halagoland. Leif put in to Nidaros with his ship, and set out at once to  visit the king. King Olaf expounded the faith to him, as he did to other  heathen men who came to visit him. It proved easy for the king to  persuade Leif, and he was accordingly baptized, together with all of his  shipmates. Leif remained throughout the winter with the king, by whom he  was well entertained.    _Biarni goes in Quest of Greenland._--Heriulf was a son of Bard  Heriulfsson. He was a kinsman of Ingolf, the first colonist. Ingolf  allotted land to Heriulf between Vag and Reykianess, and he dwelt at  first at Drepstokk. Heriulf's wife's name was Thorgerd, and their son,  whose name was Biarni, was a most promising man. He formed an inclination  for voyaging while he was still young, and he prospered both in property  and public esteem. It was his custom to pass his winters alternately  abroad and with his father. Biarni soon became the owner of a  trading-ship, and during the last winter that he spent in Norway, [his  father] Heriulf determined to accompany Eric on his voyage to Greenland,  and made his preparations to give up his farm. Upon the ship with Heriulf  was a Christian man from the Hebrides, he it was who composed the  Sea-Rollers' Song, which contains this stave:[47-1]        Mine adventure to the Meek One,        Monk-heart-searcher, I commit now;      He, who heaven's halls doth govern,        Hold the hawk's-seat ever o'er me!    Heriulf settled at Heriulfsness, and was a most distinguished man. Eric  the Red dwelt at Brattahlid, where he was held in the highest esteem, and  all men paid him homage. These were Eric's children: Leif, Thorvald, and  Thorstein, and a daughter whose name was Freydis; she was wedded to a man  named Thorvard, and they dwelt at Gardar, where the episcopal seat now  is. She was a very haughty woman, while Thorvard was a man of little  force of character, and Freydis had been wedded to him chiefly because of  his wealth. At that time the people of Greenland were heathen.    Biarni arrived with his ship at Eyrar [in Iceland] in the summer of the  same year, in the spring of which his father had sailed away. Biarni was  much surprised when he heard this news, and would not discharge his  cargo. His shipmates inquired of him what he intended to do, and he  replied that it was his purpose to keep to his custom, and make his home  for the winter with his father; \"and I will take the ship to Greenland,  if you will bear me company.\" They all replied that they would abide by  his decision. Then said Biarni, \"Our voyage must be regarded as  foolhardy, seeing that no one of us has ever been in the Greenland Sea.\"  Nevertheless they put out to sea when they were equipped for the voyage,  and sailed for three days, until the land was hidden by the water, and  then the fair wind died out, and north winds arose, and fogs, and they  knew not whither they were drifting, and thus it lasted for many  \"doegr.\" Then they saw the sun again, and were able to determine the  quarters of the heavens; they hoisted sail, and sailed that \"doegr\"  through before they saw land. They discussed among themselves what land  it could be, and Biarni said that he did not believe that it could be  Greenland. They asked whether he wished to sail to this land or not. \"It  is my counsel\" [said he], \"to sail close to the land.\" They did so, and  soon saw that the land was level, and covered with woods, and that there  were small hillocks upon it. They left the land on their larboard, and  let the sheet turn toward the land. They sailed for two \"doegr\" before  they saw another land. They asked whether Biarni thought this was  Greenland yet. He replied that he did not think this any more like  Greenland than the former, \"because in Greenland there are said to be  many great ice-mountains.\" They soon approached this land, and saw that  it was a flat and wooded country. The fair wind failed them then, and  the crew took counsel together, and concluded that it would be wise to  land there, but Biarni would not consent to this. They alleged that they  were in need of both wood and water. \"Ye have no lack of either of  these,\" says Biarni--a course, forsooth, which won him blame among his  shipmates. He bade them hoist sail, which they did, and turning the prow  from the land they sailed out upon the high seas, with southwesterly  gales, for three \"doegr,\" when they saw the third land; this land was  high and mountainous, with ice-mountains upon it. They asked Biarni then  whether he would land there, and he replied that he was not disposed to  do so, \"because this land does not appear to me to offer any  attractions.\" Nor did they lower their sail, but held their course off  the land, and saw that it was an island. They left this land astern, and  held out to sea with the same fair wind. The wind waxed amain, and  Biarni directed them to reef, and not to sail at a speed unbefitting  their ship and rigging. They sailed now for four \"doegr,\" when they saw  the fourth land. Again they asked Biarni whether he thought this could  be Greenland or not. Biarni answers, \"This is likest Greenland,  according to that which has been reported to me concerning it, and here  we will steer to the land.\" They directed their course thither, and  landed in the evening, below a cape upon which there was a boat, and  there, upon this cape, dwelt Heriulf,[49-1] Biarni's father, whence the  cape took its name, and was afterwards called Heriulfsness. Biarni now  went to his father, gave up his voyaging, and remained with his father  while Heriulf lived, and continued to live there after his father.    _Here begins the Brief History of the Greenlanders._--Next to this is now  to be told how Biarni Heriulfsson came out from Greenland on a visit to  Earl Eric,[50-1] by whom he was well received. Biarni gave an account of  his travels [upon the occasion] when he saw the lands, and the people  thought that he had been lacking in enterprise, since he had no report to  give concerning these countries, and the fact brought him reproach.  Biarni was appointed one of the Earl's men, and went out to Greenland the  following summer. There was now much talk about voyages of discovery.  Leif, the son of Eric the Red, of Brattahlid, visited Biarni Heriulfsson  and bought a ship of him, and collected a crew, until they formed  altogether a company of thirty-five men. Leif invited his father, Eric,  to become the leader of the expedition, but Eric declined, saying that he  was then stricken in years, and adding that he was less able to endure  the exposure of sea-life than he had been. Leif replied that he would  nevertheless be the one who would be most apt to bring good luck, and  Eric yielded to Leif's solicitation, and rode from home when they were  ready to sail. When he was but a short distance from the ship, the horse  which Eric was riding stumbled, and he was thrown from his back and  wounded his foot, whereupon he exclaimed, \"It is not designed for me to  discover more lands than the one in which we are now living, nor can we  now continue longer together.\" Eric returned home to Brattahlid, and Leif  pursued his way to the ship with his companions, thirty-five men; one of  the company was a German named Tyrker. They put the ship in order, and  when they were ready, they sailed out to sea, and found first that land  which Biarni and his ship-mates found last. They sailed up to the land  and cast anchor, and launched a boat and went ashore, and saw no grass  there; great ice mountains lay inland back from the sea, and it was as a  [tableland of] flat rock all the way from the sea to the ice mountains,  and the country seemed to them to be entirely devoid of good qualities.  Then said Leif, \"It has not come to pass with us in regard to this land  as with Biarni, that we have not gone upon it. To this country I will now  give a name, and call it Helluland.\" They returned to the ship, put out  to sea, and found a second land. They sailed again to the land, and came  to anchor, and launched the boat, and went ashore. This was a level  wooded land, and there were broad stretches of white sand, where they  went, and the land was level by the sea. Then said Leif, \"This land shall  have a name after its nature,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18581"],[0,"Adrift in New York: Tom and Florence Braving the World (#13)"],[1,"white hats and shabby  suits, who were apparently holding each other up, having both been  imbibing.    He at once recognized Hooker and Briggs, for he had waited upon them  too many times in Tim's saloon not to recognize them.    \"Well,\" he said, cautiously, \"what do you want?\"    \"Tim has sent us for you!\" answered the two, in unison.    \"What does he want of me?\"    \"He wants you to come home. He says he can't get along without you.\"    \"He will have to get along without me,\" said the boy, independently.  \"Tell him I'm not goin' back!\"    \"You're wrong, Dodger,\" said Hooker, shaking his head, solemnly.  \"Ain't he your father?\"    \"No, he ain't.\"    \"He says he is,\" continued Hooker, looking puzzled.    \"That don't make it so.\"    \"He ought to know,\" put in Briggs.    \"Yes; he ought to know!\" chimed in Hooker.    \"No doubt he does, but he can't make me believe he's any relation of  mine.\"    \"Just go and argy the point with him,\" said Hooker, coaxingly.    \"It wouldn't do no good.\"    \"Maybe it would. Just go back with us, that's a good boy.\"    \"What makes you so anxious about it?\" asked Dodger, suspiciously.    \"Well,\" said Hooker, coughing, \"we're Tim's friends, don't you know.\"    \"What's he goin' to give you if I go back with you?\" asked the boy,  shrewdly.    \"A glass of whiskey!\" replied Hooker and Briggs in unison.    \"Is that all?\"    \"Maybe he'd make it two.\"    \"I won't go back with you,\" said Dodger, after a moment's thought;  \"but I don't want you to lose anything by me. Here's a dime apiece,  and you can go and get a drink somewhere else.\"    \"You're a trump, Dodger,\" said Hooker, eagerly holding out his hand.    \"I always liked you, Dodger,\" said Briggs, with a similar motion.    \"Now, don't let Tim know you've seen me,\" said the newsboy, warningly.    \"We won't.\"    And the interesting pair ambled off in the direction of the Bowery.    \"So Tim sent them fellers after me?\" soliloqized Dodger. \"I guess I'll  have to change my office, or maybe Tim himself will be droppin' down  on me some mornin'. It'll be harder to get rid of him than of them  chumps.\"    So it happened that he used to take down his morning papers to the  piers on the North River, and take his chance of selling them to  passengers from Boston and others ports arriving by the Fall River  boats, and others from different points.    The advantage of this was that he often got a chance to serve as guide  to strangers visiting the city for the first time, or as porter, to  carry their valise or other luggage.    Being a bright, wideawake boy, with a pleasant face and manner, he  found his services considerably in demand; and on counting up his  money at the end of the week, he found, much to his encouragement,  that he had received on an average about a dollar and twenty-five  cents per day.    \"That's better than sellin' papers alone,\" thought he. \"Besides, Tim  isn't likely to come across me here. I wonder I didn't think of  settin' up for myself before!\"    In the evening he spent an hour, and sometimes more, pursuing his  studies, under the direction of Florence. At first his attention was  given chiefly to improving his reading and spelling, for Dodger was  far from fluent in the first, while his style of spelling many words  was strikingly original.    \"Ain't I stupid, Florence?\" he asked one day, after spelling a word of  three syllables with such ingenious incorrectness as to convulse his  young teacher with merriment.    \"Not at all, Dodger. You are making excellent progress; but sometimes  you are so droll that I can't help laughing.\"    \"I don't mind that if you think I am really gettin' on.\"    \"Undoubtedly you are!\"    \"I make a great many mistakes,\" said Dodger, dubiously.    \"Yes, you do; but you must remember that you have taken lessons only a  short time. Don't you think you can read a good deal more easily than  you did?\"    \"Yes; I don't trip up half so often as I did. I'm afraid you'll get  tired of teachin' me.\"    \"No fear of that, Dodger. As long as I see that you are improving, I  shall feel encouraged to go on.\"    \"I wish I knew as much as your other scholar.\"    \"You will in time if you go on. You mustn't get discouraged.\"    \"I won't!\" said Dodger, stoutly. \"If a little gal like her can learn,  I'd ought to be ashamed if I don't--a big boy of eighteen.\"    \"It isn't the size of the boy that counts, Dodger.\"    \"I know that, but I ain't goin' to give in, and let a little gal get  ahead of me!\"    \"Keep to that determination, Dodger, and you will succeed in time,  never fear.\"    On the whole, Florence enjoyed both her pupils. She had the faculty of  teaching, and she became very much interested in both.    As for Dodger, she thought, rough diamond as he was, that she saw in  him the making of a manly man, and she felt that it was a privilege to  assist in the development of his intellectual nature.    Again, he had picked up a good deal of slang from the nature of his  associates, and she set to work to improve his language, and teach him  refinement.    It was necessarily a slow process, but she began to find after a time  that a gradual change was coming over him.    \"I want you to grow up a gentleman, Dodger,\" she said to him one day.    \"I'm too rough for that, Florence. I'm only an ignorant street boy.\"    \"You are not going to be an ignorant street boy all your life. I don't  see why you should not grow up a polished gentleman.\"    \"I shall never be like that de Brabazon young man,\" said he.    \"No, Dodger; I don't think you will,\" said Florence, laughing. \"I  don't want you to become effeminate nor a dude. I think I would like  you less than I do now.\"    \"Do you like me, Florence?\" asked Dodger, brightening up.    \"To be sure I do. I hope you don't doubt it.\"    \"Why, it don't seem natural-like. You're a fashionable young lady----\"    \"Not very fashionable, Dodger, just at present.\"    \"Well, a high-toned young lady--one of the tip-tops, and I am a rough  Bowery boy.\"    \"You were once, but you are getting over that rapidly. Did you ever  hear of Andy Johnson?\"    \"Who was he?\"    \"He became President of the United States. Well, at the age of  twenty-one he could neither read nor write.\"    \"At twenty-one?\" repeated Dodger. \"Why, I'm only eighteen, and I do  know something of readin' and writin'.\"    \"To be sure! Well, Andy Johnson was taught to read and write by his  wife. He kept on improving himself till, in course of time, he became  a United States Senator, Vice-President, and afterward, President.  Now, I don't expect you to equal him, but I see no reason why you  should not become a well-educated man if you are content to work, and  keep on working.\"    \"I will keep on, Florence,\" said Dodger, earnestly.    \"If I ever find my relations I don't want them to be ashamed of me.\"    It was not the first time he had referred to his uncertain origin.    \"Won't Tim Bolton tell you anything about your family?\"    \"No; I've asked him more'n once. He always says he's my father, and  that makes me mad.\"    \"It is strange,\" said Florence, thoughtfully. \"I had a young cousin  stolen many years ago.\"    \"Was it the son of the old gentleman you lived with on Madison  Avenue?\"    \"Yes; it was the son of Uncle John. It quite broke him down. After my  cousin's loss he felt that he had nothing to live for.\"    \"I wish I was your cousin, Florence,\" said Dodger, thoughtfully.    \"Well, then, I will adopt you as my cousin, or brother, whichever you  prefer!\"    \"I would rather be your cousin.\"    \"Then cousin let it be! Now we are bound to each other by strong and  near ties.\"    \"But when your uncle takes you back you'll forget all about poor  Dodger.\"    \"No, I won't, Dodger. There's my hand on it. Whatever comes, we are  friends forever.\"    \"Then I'll try not to disgrace you, Florence. I'll learn as fast as I  can, and see if I don't grow up to be a gentleman.\"          Chapter XVII.  A Mysterious Adventure.      Several weeks passed without changing in any way the position or  employment of Dodger or Florence.    They had settled down to their respective forms of labor, and were  able not only to pay their modest expenses, but to save up something  for a rainy day.    Florence had but one source of regret.    She enjoyed her work, and did not now lament the luxurious home which  she had lost.    But she did feel sore at heart that her uncle made no sign of regret  for their separation.    From him she received no message of forgiveness or reconciliation.    \"He has forgotten me!\" she said to herself, bitterly. \"He has cast me  utterly out of his heart. I do not care for his money, but I do not  like to think that my kind uncle--for he was always kind till the last  trouble--has steeled his heart against me forever.\"    But she learned through a chance meeting with Jane, that this was not  so.    \"Mr. Linden is getting very nervous and low-spirited,\" said the girl,  \"and sits hour after hour in the library looking into the fire,  a-fotchin' deep sighs every few minutes. Once I saw him with your  photograph--the one you had taken last spring--in his hands, and he  looked sad-like when he laid it down.\"    \"My dear uncle! Then he does think of me sometimes?\"    \"It's my belief he'd send for you if Curtis would let him.\"    \"Surely Curtis cannot exercise any restraint upon him?\"    \"He has frequent talks with the old gentleman. I don't know what he  says, but it's sure to be something wicked. I expect he does all he  can to set him against you. Oh, he's a cunning villain, he is, even if  he is your cousin, Miss Florence.\"    \"And do you think my uncle is unhappy, Jane?\" said Florence,  thoughtfully.    \"That I do, miss.\"    \"He never was very bright or cheerful, you know.\"    \"But he never was like this. And I do think he's gettin' more and more  feeble.\"    \"Do you think I ought to call upon him, and risk his sending me away?\"    \"It might be worth tryin', Miss Florence.\"    The result of this"]]]
