Three weeks of anxious waiting will ensue before a huge crowd will  assemble to see the list published. Then the successful candidates are  the pride of their country side, and well do the survivors of such an  ordeal deserve their credit. The case of those who are in the last  selection and are left degreeless, for the stern reason that some must  be crowded out, is the hardest of all.           *       *       *       *       *          HIGH SPEED ENGINE AND DYNAMO.      We illustrate a high speed engine and dynamo constructed by Easton &  Anderson, London. This plant was used at the Royal Agricultural  Society's show at Doncaster in testing the machinery in the dairy, and  constituted a distinct innovation, as well as an improvement, on the  appliances previously employed for the purpose. The separator, or  whatever might be the machine under trial, was driven by an electric  motor fed by a current from the dynamo we illustrate. A record was  made of the volts and amperes used, and from this the power expended  was deduced, the motor having been previously carefully calibrated by  means of a brake. So delicate was the test that the observers could  detect the presence of a warm bearing in the separator from the change  in the readings of the ammeter.    [Illustration: IMPROVED HIGH SPEED ENGINE AND DYNAMO.]    The engine is carefully balanced to enable it to run at the very high  speed of 500 revolutions per minute. The cranks are opposite each  other, and the moving parts connected with the two pistons are of the  same weight. The result is complete absence of vibration, and  exceedingly quiet running. Very liberal lubricating arrangements are  fitted to provide for long runs, while uniformity of speed is provided  for by a Pickering governor. The high pressure cylinder is 4 in. in  diameter, and the low pressure cylinder is 7 in. in diameter. The  stroke in each case is 4 in.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    The dynamo is designed to feed sixty lamps of 16 candle power each,  the current being 60 amperes at 50 volts. The armature is of the drum  type. The peculiar feature of it is that grooves are planed in the  laminated core from end to end, and in these grooves the conductors,  which are of ribbon section, are laid. Slips of insulating material  are laid between the coils and the dovetailed mouths of the grooves  are closed with bone or vulcanized fiber, or other dielectric. At each  end of the core there are fitted non-magnetic covers. At the  commutator end the cover is like a truncated cone, and incloses the  connections completely. One end of the cone is supported on the end  plate of the armature and the other end on a ring on the commutator. A  bell-shaped cover incloses the conductors at the other end of the  armature. The result is that the conductors are completely incased,  protected from all mechanical injury, and positively driven. They can  neither be displaced nor abraded. The conductors on the magnet coils  are likewise carefully protected from harm by metal coverings. These  dynamos are made in sixteen sizes, of which seven sizes are designed  to feed more than 100 lamps, the largest serving for 600 lamps.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]    Messrs. Easton & Anderson are showing machinery of this type at the  Crystal Palace Electrical Exhibition now open in  London.--_Engineering_.           *       *       *       *       *          CHLORINE GAS AND SODA BY THE ELECTROLYTIC PROCESS.      The decomposition of a solution of common salt, and its conversion  into chlorine gas and caustic soda solution by means of an electric  current, has long been a study with electro-chemists. Experimentally  it has often been effected, but so far as we are aware, the success of  this method of production has never until now been demonstrated on a  sound commercial basis. The solution of this important industrial  problem is due to Mr. James Greenwood, who has been engaged in the  development of electro-chemical processes for many years. The outcome  of this is that Mr. Greenwood has now perfected an electrolytic  process for the direct production of caustic soda and chlorine, as  well as other chemical products, the operation of which we recently  inspected at Phoenix Wharf, Battersea, London. One of the special  features in connection with Mr. Greenwood's new departure is the novel  and ingenious method by which the electrolyzed products are separated,  and their recombination rendered impossible. This object is attained  by the use of a specially constructed diaphragm which is composed of a  series of V-shaped glass troughs, fitted in a frame within each other  with a small space between them, which is lightly packed with asbestos  fiber. Another important feature of the apparatus is a compound anode  which consists of carbon plates, with a metal core to increase the  conductivity. The anode is treated in a special manner so as to render  it non-porous and impervious to attack by the nascent chlorine evolved  on its surface. No anode appears ever to have been invented that is at  all suitable for working on a large scale, and the successful  introduction of this compound anode, therefore, constitutes a marked  advance in the apparatus used in electrolytic methods of production.    The apparatus by which the new process is being successfully  demonstrated on a working scale has been put up by the Caustic Soda  and Chlorine Syndicate, London, and has been in operation for several  months past. The installation consists of five large electrolytic  vessels, each of which is fitted up with five anodes and six cathodes  arranged alternately. The anodes and cathodes are separated by the  special diaphragms, and each vessel is thus divided into ten anode or  chlorine sections and ten cathode or caustic soda sections. The anodes  and cathodes in each vessel are connected up in parallel similar to an  ordinary storage battery, but the five electrolytic vessels are  connected up in series. The current is produced by an Elwell-Parker  dynamo, and the electromotive force required to overcome the  resistance of each vessel is about 4.4 volts, with a current density  of 10 amperes per square foot of electrode surface. The anode  sections, numbering fifty altogether, are connected by means of tubes,  the inlet being at the bottom and the outlet at the top of each  section. The whole of the cathode sections are connected in the same  manner. In commencing operations, the electrolytic vessels are charged  with a solution of common salt, through which a current of electricity  is then passed, thus decomposing or splitting up the salt into its  elements, chlorine and sodium. In the separation of the sodium,  however, a secondary action takes place, which converts it into  caustic soda. An automatic circulation of the solutions is maintained  by placing the charging tanks at a slight elevation, and the vessels  themselves on platforms arranged in steps. The solutions are pumped  back from the lowest vessel to their respective charging tanks, the  salt solution to be further decomposed and the caustic soda solution  to be further concentrated. The chlorine gas evolved in the fifty  anode sections is conveyed by means of main and branch tubes into  several absorbers, in which milk of lime, kept in a state of  agitation, takes up the chlorine, thus making it into bleaching or  chlorate liquor as may be required. If the chlorine is required to be  made into bleaching powder, then it is conveyed into leaden chambers  and treated with lime in the usual manner. The caustic soda formed in  the fifty cathode sections is more or less concentrated according to  the particular purpose for which it may be required. If, however, the  caustic soda is required in solid form, and practically free from  salt, then the caustic alkaline liquor is transferred from the  electrolytic vessels to evaporating pans, where it is concentrated to  the required strength by evaporation and at the same time the salt  remaining in the solution is eliminated by precipitation.    Such is the method of manufacturing caustic soda and chlorine by this  process, which will doubtless have a most important bearing upon many  trades and manufactures, more particularly upon the paper, soap, and  bleaching industries. But the invention does not stop where we have  left it, for it is stated that the process can be applied to the  production of sodium amalgam and chlorine for extracting gold and  other metals from their ores. It can also be utilized in the  production of caustic and chlorate of potash and other chemicals,  which can be manufactured in a state of the greatest purity. A very  important consideration is that of cost, for upon this depends  commercial success. It is therefore satisfactory to learn that the  cost of production has been determined by the most careful electrical  and analytical tests, which demonstrate an economy of over 50 per  cent. as compared with present methods. Highly favorable reports on  the process have been made by Dr. G. Gore, F.R.S., the eminent  authority on electro-chemical processes, by Mr. W.H. Preece, F.R.S.,  and by Messrs. Cross & Bevan, consulting chemists. Dr. Gore states  that the chemical and electrical principles upon which this process is  based are thoroughly sound, and that the process is of a  scientifically practical character. Should, however, the economy of  production even fall somewhat below the anticipations of those who  have examined into the process very carefully, it can hardly fail to  prove as successful commercially as it has scientifically.           *       *       *       *       *          COMPLETION OF THE MERSEY TUNNEL RAILWAY.

As he no doubt himself  perceived, his idea was quite independent of this hypothesis, since,  as we have seen, he was led to surmise that heat could disappear; but  his demonstrations needed to be recast and, in some points, modified.    It is to Clausius that was reserved the credit of rediscovering the  principle, and of enunciating it in language conformable to the new  doctrines, while giving it a much greater generality. The postulate  arrived at by experimental induction, and which must be admitted  without demonstration, is, according to Clausius, that in a series of  transformations in which the final is identical with the initial  stage, it is impossible for heat to pass from a colder to a warmer  body unless some other accessory phenomenon occurs at the same time.    Still more correctly, perhaps, an enunciation can be given of the  postulate which, in the main, is analogous, by saying: A heat motor,  which after a series of transformations returns to its initial state,  can only furnish work if there exist at least two sources of heat, and  if a certain quantity of heat is given to one of the sources, which  can never be the hotter of the two. By the expression \"source of  heat,\" we mean a body exterior to the system and capable of furnishing  or withdrawing heat from it.    Starting with this principle, we arrive, as does Clausius, at the  demonstration that the output of a reversible machine working between  two given temperatures is greater than that of any non-reversible  engine, and that it is the same for all reversible machines working  between these two temperatures.    This is the very proposition of Carnot; but the proposition thus  stated, while very useful for the theory of engines, does not yet  present any very general interest. Clausius, however, drew from it  much more important consequences. First, he showed that the principle  conduces to the definition of an absolute scale of temperature; and  then he was brought face to face with a new notion which allows a  strong light to be thrown on the questions of physical equilibrium. I  refer to entropy.    It is still rather difficult to strip entirely this very important  notion of all analytical adornment. Many physicists hesitate to  utilize it, and even look upon it with some distrust, because they see  in it a purely mathematical function without any definite physical  meaning. Perhaps they are here unduly severe, since they often admit  too easily the objective existence of quantities which they cannot  define. Thus, for instance, it is usual almost every day to speak of  the heat possessed by a body. Yet no body in reality possesses a  definite quantity of heat even relatively to any initial state; since  starting from this point of departure, the quantities of heat it may  have gained or lost vary with the road taken and even with the means  employed to follow it. These expressions of heat gained or lost are,  moreover, themselves evidently incorrect, for heat can no longer be  considered as a sort of fluid passing from one body to another.    The real reason which makes entropy somewhat mysterious is that this  magnitude does not fall directly under the ken of any of our senses;  but it possesses the true characteristic of a concrete physical  magnitude, since it is, in principle at least, measurable. Various  authors of thermodynamical researches, amongst whom M. Mouret should  be particularly mentioned, have endeavoured to place this  characteristic in evidence.    Consider an isothermal transformation. Instead of leaving the heat  abandoned by the body subjected to the transformation--water  condensing in a state of saturated vapour, for instance--to pass  directly into an ice calorimeter, we can transmit this heat to the  calorimeter by the intermediary of a reversible Carnot engine. The  engine having absorbed this quantity of heat, will only give back to  the ice a lesser quantity of heat; and the weight of the melted ice,  inferior to that which might have been directly given back, will serve  as a measure of the isothermal transformation thus effected. It can be  easily shown that this measure is independent of the apparatus used.  It consequently becomes a numerical element characteristic of the body  considered, and is called its entropy. Entropy, thus defined, is a  variable which, like pressure or volume, might serve concurrently with  another variable, such as pressure or volume, to define the state of a  body.    It must be perfectly understood that this variable can change in an  independent manner, and that it is, for instance, distinct from the  change of temperature. It is also distinct from the change which  consists in losses or gains of heat. In chemical reactions, for  example, the entropy increases without the substances borrowing any  heat. When a perfect gas dilates in a vacuum its entropy increases,  and yet the temperature does not change, and the gas has neither been  able to give nor receive heat. We thus come to conceive that a  physical phenomenon cannot be considered known to us if the variation  of entropy is not given, as are the variations of temperature and of  pressure or the exchanges of heat. The change of entropy is, properly  speaking, the most characteristic fact of a thermal change.    It is important, however, to remark that if we can thus easily define  and measure the difference of entropy between two states of the same  body, the value found depends on the state arbitrarily chosen as the  zero point of entropy; but this is not a very serious difficulty, and  is analogous to that which occurs in the evaluation of other physical  magnitudes--temperature, potential, etc.    A graver difficulty proceeds from its not being possible to define a  difference, or an equality, of entropy between two bodies chemically  different. We are unable, in fact, to pass by any means, reversible or  not, from one to the other, so long as the transmutation of matter is  regarded as impossible; but it is well understood that it is  nevertheless possible to compare the variations of entropy to which  these two bodies are both of them individually subject.    Neither must we conceal from ourselves that the definition supposes,  for a given body, the possibility of passing from one state to another  by a reversible transformation. Reversibility is an ideal and extreme  case which cannot be realized, but which can be approximately attained  in many circumstances. So with gases and with perfectly elastic  bodies, we effect sensibly reversible transformations, and changes  of physical state are practically reversible. The discoveries of  Sainte-Claire Deville have brought many chemical phenomena into a  similar category, and reactions such as solution, which used to be  formerly the type of an irreversible phenomenon, may now often be  effected by sensibly reversible means. Be that as it may, when once the  definition is admitted, we arrive, by taking as a basis the principles  set forth at the inception, at the demonstration of the celebrated  theorem of Clausius: _The entropy of a thermally isolated system  continues to increase incessantly._    It is very evident that the theorem can only be worth applying in  cases where the entropy can be exactly defined; but, even when thus  limited, the field still remains vast, and the harvest which we can  there reap is very abundant.    Entropy appears, then, as a magnitude measuring in a certain way the  evolution of a system, or, at least, as giving the direction of this  evolution. This very important consequence certainly did not escape  Clausius, since the very name of entropy, which he chose to designate  this magnitude, itself signifies evolution. We have succeeded in  defining this entropy by demonstrating, as has been said, a certain  number of propositions which spring from the postulate of Clausius; it  is, therefore, natural to suppose that this postulate itself contains  _in potentia_ the very idea of a necessary evolution of physical  systems. But as it was first enunciated, it contains it in a deeply  hidden way.    No doubt we should make the principle of Carnot appear in an  interesting light by endeavouring to disengage this fundamental idea,  and by placing it, as it were, in large letters. Just as, in  elementary geometry, we can replace the postulate of Euclid by other  equivalent propositions, so the postulate of thermodynamics is not  necessarily fixed, and it is instructive to try to give it the most  general and suggestive character.    MM. Perrin and Langevin have made a successful attempt in this  direction. M. Perrin enunciates the following principle: _An isolated  system never passes twice through the same state_. In this form, the  principle affirms that there exists a necessary order in the  succession of two phenomena; that evolution takes place in a  determined direction. If you prefer it, it may be thus stated: _Of two  converse transformations unaccompanied by any external effect, one  only is possible_. For instance, two gases may diffuse themselves one  in the other in constant volume, but they could not conversely  separate themselves spontaneously.    Starting from the principle thus put forward, we make the logical  deduction that one cannot hope to construct an engine which should  work for an indefinite time by heating a hot source and by cooling a  cold one. We thus come again into the route traced by Clausius, and  from this point we may follow it strictly.    Whatever the point of view adopted, whether we regard the proposition  of M. Perrin as the corollary of another experimental postulate, or  whether we consider it as a truth which we admit _a priori_ and verify  through its consequences, we are led to consider that in its entirety  the principle of Carnot resolves itself into the idea that we cannot  go back along the course of life, and that the evolution of a system  must follow its necessary"]]]
