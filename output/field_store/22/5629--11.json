If he left his wife in Egypt she would now be some fifty or  sixty years old, and all the more likely to be despised by the proud  prophetess Miriam as a daughter of Ham.    I dream of discovering some monumental relics of Meroe, and if anything  confirmatory of sacred history does remain, I pray to be guided  thereunto. If the sacred chronology would thereby be confirmed, I would  not grudge the toil and hardships, hunger and pain, I have endured--the  irritable ulcers would only be discipline.    Above the fine yellow clay schist of Manyuema the banks of Tanganyika  reveal 50 feet of shingle mixed with red earth; above this at some parts  great boulders lie; after this 60 feet of fine clay schist, then 5  strata of gravel underneath, with a foot stratum of schist between them.  The first seam of gravel is about 2 feet, the second 4 feet, and the  lowest of all about 30 feet thick. The fine schist was formed in still  water, but the shingle must have been produced in stormy troubled seas  if not carried hither and thither by ice and at different epochs.    This Manyuema country is unhealthy, not so much from fever as from  debility of the whole system, induced by damp, cold, and indigestion:  this general weakness is ascribed by some to maize being the common  food, it shows itself in weakness of bowels and choleraic purging. This  may be owing to bad water, of which there is no scarcity, but it is so  impregnated with dead vegetable matter as to have the colour of tea.  Irritable ulcers fasten on any part abraded by accident, and it seems to  be a spreading fungus, for the matter settling on any part near becomes  a fresh centre of propagation. The vicinity of the ulcer is very tender,  and it eats in frightfully if not allowed rest. Many slaves die of it,  and its periodical discharges of bloody ichor makes me suspect it to be  a development of fever. I have found lunar caustic useful: a plaister of  wax, and a little finely-ground sulphate of copper is used by the Arabs,  and so is cocoa-nut oil and butter. These ulcers are excessively  intractable, there is no healing them before they eat into the bone,  especially on the shins.    Rheumatism is also common, and it cuts the natives off. The traders fear  these diseases, and come to a stand if attacked, in order to use rest in  the cure. \"Taema,\" or Tape-worm, is frequently met with, and no remedy  is known among the Arabs and natives for it.    [Searching in his closely-written pocket-books we find many little  mementoes of his travels; such, for instance, as two or three tsetse  flies pressed between the leaves of one book; some bees, some leaves and  moths in another, but, hidden away in the pocket of the note-book which  Livingstone used during the longest and most painful illness he ever  underwent lies a small scrap of printed paper which tells a tale in its  own simple way. On one side there is written in his well-known hand:--]        \"Turn over and see a drop of comfort found when suffering      from irritable eating ulcers on the feet in Manyuema,      August, 1870.\"    [On the reverse we see that the scrap was evidently snipped off a list  of books advertised at the end of some volume which, with the tea and  other things sent to Ujiji, had reached him before setting out on this  perilous journey. The \"drop of comfort\" is as follows:--]        \"A NARRATIVE OF AN EXPEDITION TO THE ZAMBESI AND ITS      TRIBUTARIES,        \"And the discovery of Lakes Shirwa and Nyassa.        \"_Fifth Thousand. With Map and Illustrations_. 8vo. 21s.        \"'Few achievements in our day have made a greater impression      than that of the adventurous missionary who unaided crossed the      Continent of Equatorial Africa. His unassuming simplicity, his      varied intelligence, his indomitable pluck, his steady religious      purpose, form a combination of qualities rarely found in one      man. By common consent, Dr. Livingstone has come to be regarded      as one of the most remarkable travellers of his own or of any      other age.'--_British Quarterly Review_.\"    [The kindly pen of the reviewer served a good turn when there was \"no  medicine\" but the following:--]    I was at last advised to try malachite, rubbed down with water on a  stone, and applied with a feather: this is the only thing that has any  beneficial effect.    _9th September, 1870._--A Londa slave stole ten goats from the Manyuema;  he was bound, but broke loose, and killed two goats yesterday. He was  given to the Manyuema. The Balonda evidently sold their criminals only.  He was shorn of his ears and would have been killed, but Monangoi said:  \"Don't let the blood of a freeman touch our soil.\"    _26th September, 1870._--I am able now to report the ulcers healing. For  eighty days I have been completely laid up by them, and it will be long  ere the lost substance will be replaced. They kill many slaves; and an  epidemic came to us which carried off thirty in our small camp.[8]    [We come to a very important note under the next date. It may be  necessary to remind the reader that when Livingstone left the  neighbourhood of Lake Nyassa and bent his steps northwards, he believed  that the \"Chambeze\" River, which the natives reported to be ahead of  him, was in reality the Zambezi, for he held in his hand a map  manufactured at home, and so conveniently manipulated as to clear up a  great difficulty by simply inserting \"New Zambezi\" in the place of the  Chambeze. As we now see, Livingstone handed back this addled  geographical egg to its progenitor, who, we regret to say, has not only  smashed it in wrath, but has treated us to so much of its savour in a  pamphlet written against the deceased explorer, that few will care to  turn over its leaves.    However, the African traveller has a warning held up before him which  may be briefly summed up in a caution to be on the look out for constant  repetitions in one form or another of the same name. Endless confusion  has arisen from Nyassas and Nyanzas, from Chiroas and Kiroas and  Shirwas, to say nothing of Zambesis and Ohambezes. The natives are just  as prone to perpetuate Zambezi or Lufira in Africa as we are to multiply  our Avons and Ouses in England.]    _4th October, 1870._--A trading party from Ujiji reports an epidemic  raging between the coast and Ujiji, and very fatal. Syde bin Habib and  Dugumbe are coming, and they have letters and perhaps people for me, so  I remain, though the irritable ulcers are well-nigh healed. I fear that  my packet for the coast may have fared badly, for the Lewale has kept  Musa Kamaal by him, so that no evidence against himself or the dishonest  man Musa bin Saloom should be given: my box and guns, with despatches, I  fear will never be sent. Zahor, to whom I gave calico to pay carriers,  has been sent off to Lobemba.    Mohamad sowed rice yesterday, and has to send his people (who were  unsuccessful among the Balegga) away to the Metambe, where they got  ivory before.    I cannot understand very well what a \"Theoretical Discoverer\" is. If  anyone got up and declared in a public meeting that he was the  theoretical discoverer of the philosopher's stone, or of perpetual  motion for watches, should we not mark him as a little wrong in the  head? So of the Nile sources. The Portuguese crossed the Chambeze some  seventy years before I did, but to them it was a branch of the Zambezi  and nothing more. Cooley put it down as the New Zambesi, and made it run  backwards, up-hill, between 3000 and 4000 feet! I was misled by the  similarity of names and a map, to think it the eastern branch of the  Zambezi. I was told that it formed a large water in the south-west, this  I readily believed to be the Liambai, in the Barotse Valley, and it took  me eighteen months of toil to come back again to the Chambeze in Lake  Bangweolo, and work out the error into which I was led--twenty-two  months elapsed ere I got back to the point whence I set out to explore  Chambeze, Bangweolo, Luapula, Moero, and Lualaba. I spent two full years  at this work, and the Chief Casembe was the first to throw light on the  subject by saying, \"It is the same water here as in the Chambeze, the  same in Moero and Lualaba, and one piece of water is just like another.  Will you draw out calico from it that you wish to see it? As your chief  desired you to see Bangweolo, go to it, and if in going north you see a  travelling party, join it; if not, come back to me, and I will send you  safely by my path along Moero.\"    The central Lualaba I would fain call the Lake River Webb; the western,  the Lake River Young. The Lufira and Lualaba West form a Lake, the  native name of which, \"Chibungo,\" must give way to Lake Lincoln. I wish  to name the fountain of the Liambai or Upper Zambesi, Palmerston  Fountain, and adding that of Sir Bartle Frere to the fountain of Lufira,  three names of men who have done more to abolish slavery and the  slave-trade than any of their contemporaries.    [Through the courtesy of the Earl of Derby we are able to insert a  paragraph here which occurs in a despatch written to Her Majesty's  Foreign Office by Dr. Livingstone a few weeks before his death. He  treats more fully in it upon the different names that he gave to the  most important rivers and lakes which he discovered, and we see how he  cherished to the last the fond memory of old well-tried friendships, and  the great examples of men like President Lincoln and Lord Palmerston.]    \"I have tried to honour the name of the good Lord Palmerston, in fond  remembrance of his long and unwearied labour for the abolition of the  Slave Trade; and I venture to place"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1703"],[0,"Dead Men Tell No Tales (#13)"],[1,"a court-room. The old judgment seat stood back against the  wall, and our table was the one at which the justices had been wont to  sit. Then the chamber had been low-ceiled; now it ran to the roof, and  we ate our dinner beneath a square of fading autumn sky, with I wondered  how many ghosts looking down on us from the oaken gallery! I was  interested, impressed, awed not a little, and yet all in a way which  afforded my mind the most welcome distraction from itself and from the  past. To Rattray, on the other hand, it was rather sadly plain that the  place was both a burden and a bore; in fact he vowed it was the dampest  and the dullest old ruin under the sun, and that he would sell it  to-morrow if he could find a lunatic to buy. His want of sentiment  struck me as his one deplorable trait. Yet even this displayed his  characteristic merit of frankness. Nor was it at all unpleasant to hear  his merry, boyish laughter ringing round hall and gallery, ere it died  away against a dozen closed doors.    And there were other elements of good cheer: a log fire blazing heartily  in the old dog-grate, casting a glow over the stone flags, a reassuring  flicker into the darkest corner: cold viands of the very best: and the  finest old Madeira that has ever passed my lips.    Now, all my life I have been a \"moderate drinker\" in the most literal  sense of that slightly elastic term. But at the sad time of which I  am trying to write, I was almost an abstainer, from the fear, the  temptation--of seeking oblivion in strong waters. To give way then was  to go on giving way. I realized the danger, and I took stern measures.  Not stern enough, however; for what I did not realize was my weak and  nervous state, in which a glass would have the same effect on me as  three or four upon a healthy man.    Heaven knows how much or how little I took that evening! I can swear  it was the smaller half of either bottle--and the second we never  finished--but the amount matters nothing. Even me it did not make  grossly tipsy. But it warmed my blood, it cheered my heart, it excited  my brain, and--it loosened my tongue. It set me talking with a freedom  of which I should have been incapable in my normal moments, on a subject  whereof I had never before spoken of my own free will. And yet the will  to--speak--to my present companion--was no novelty. I had felt it at our  first meeting in the private hotel. His tact, his sympathy, his handsome  face, his personal charm, his frank friendliness, had one and all  tempted me to bore this complete stranger with unsolicited confidences  for which an inquisitive relative might have angled in vain. And the  temptation was the stronger because I knew in my heart that I should  not bore the young squire at all; that he was anxious enough to hear my  story from my own lips, but too good a gentleman intentionally to  betray such anxiety. Vanity was also in the impulse. A vulgar newspaper  prominence had been my final (and very genuine) tribulation; but to  please and to interest one so pleasing and so interesting to me, was  another and a subtler thing. And then there was his sympathy--shall I  add his admiration?--for my reward.    I do not pretend that I argued thus deliberately in my heated and  excited brain. I merely hold that all these small reasons and motives  were there, fused and exaggerated by the liquor which was there as well.  Nor can I say positively that Rattray put no leading questions; only  that I remember none which had that sound; and that, once started, I am  afraid I needed only too little encouragement to run on and on.    Well, I was set going before we got up from the table. I continued in  an armchair that my host dragged from a little book-lined room adjoining  the hall. I finished on my legs, my back to the fire, my hands beating  wildly together. I had told my dear Rattray of my own accord more than  living man had extracted from me yet. He interrupted me very little;  never once until I came to the murderous attack by Santos on the drunken  steward.    \"The brute!\" cried Rattray. \"The cowardly, cruel, foreign devil! And you  never let out one word of that!\"    \"What was the good?\" said I. \"They are all gone now--all gone to their  account. Every man of us was a brute at the last. There was nothing to  be gained by telling the public that.\"    He let me go on until I came to another point which I had hitherto kept  to myself: the condition of the dead mate's fingers: the cries that the  sight of them had recalled.    \"That Portuguese villain again!\" cried my companion, fairly leaping from  the chair which I had left and he had taken. \"It was the work of the  same cane that killed the steward. Don't tell me an Englishman would  have done it; and yet you said nothing about that either!\"    It was my first glimpse of this side of my young host's character. Nor  did I admire him the less, in his spirited indignation, because much of  this was clearly against myself. His eyes flashed. His face was white. I  suddenly found myself the cooler man of the two.    \"My dear fellow, do consider!\" said I. \"What possible end could have  been served by my stating what I couldn't prove against a man who  could never be brought to book in this world? Santos was punished as he  deserved; his punishment was death, and there's an end on't.\"    \"You might be right,\" said Rattray, \"but it makes my blood boil to hear  such a story. Forgive me if I have spoken strongly;\" and he paced his  hall for a little in an agitation which made me like him better and  better. \"The cold-blooded villain!\" he kept muttering; \"the infernal,  foreign, blood-thirsty rascal! Perhaps you were right; it couldn't have  done any good, I know; but--I only wish he'd lived for us to hang him,  Cole! Why, a beast like that is capable of anything: I wonder if  you've told me the worst even now?\" And he stood before me, with candid  suspicion in his fine, frank eyes.    \"What makes you say that?\" said I, rather nettled.    \"I shan't tell you if it's going to rile you, old fellow,\" was his reply.  And with it reappeared the charming youth whom I found it impossible  to resist. \"Heaven knows you have had enough to worry you!\" he added, in  his kindly, sympathetic voice.    \"So much,\" said I, \"that you cannot add to it, my dear Rattray. Now,  then! Why do you think there was something worse?\"    \"You hinted as much in town: rightly or wrongly I gathered there was  something you would never speak about to living man.\"    I turned from him with a groan.    \"Ah! but that had nothing to do with Santos.\"    \"Are you sure?\" he cried.    \"No,\" I murmured; \"it had something to do with him, in a sense; but  don't ask me any more.\" And I leaned my forehead on the high oak  mantel-piece, and groaned again.    His hand was upon my shoulder.    \"Do tell me,\" he urged. I was silent. He pressed me further. In my  fancy, both hand and voice shook with his sympathy.    \"He had a step-daughter,\" said I at last.    \"Yes? Yes?\"    \"I loved her. That was all.\"    His hand dropped from my shoulder. I remained standing, stooping,  thinking only of her whom I had lost for ever. The silence was intense.  I could hear the wind sighing in the oaks without, the logs burning  softly away at my feet And so we stood until the voice of Rattray  recalled me from the deck of the Lady Jermyn and my lost love's side.    \"So that was all!\"    I turned and met a face I could not read.    \"Was it not enough?\" cried I. \"What more would you have?\"    \"I expected some more-foul play!\"    \"Ah!\" I exclaimed bitterly. \"So that was all that interested you! No,  there was no more foul play that I know of; and if there was, I don't  care. Nothing matters to me but one thing. Now that you know what that  is, I hope you're satisfied.\"    It was no way to speak to one's host. Yet I felt that he had pressed me  unduly. I hated myself for my final confidence, and his want of sympathy  made me hate him too. In my weakness, however, I was the natural prey  of violent extremes. His hand flew out to me. He was about to speak.  A moment more and I had doubtless forgiven him. But another sound  came instead and made the pair of us start and stare. It was the soft  shutting of some upstairs door.    \"I thought we had the house to ourselves?\" cried I, my miserable nerves  on edge in an instant.    \"So did I,\" he answered, very pale. \"My servants must have come back. By  the Lord Harry, they shall hear of this!\"    He sprang to a door, I heard his feet clattering up some stone stairs,  and in a trice he was running along the gallery overhead; in another  I heard him railing behind some upper door that he had flung open and  banged behind him; then his voice dropped, and finally died away. I was  left some minutes in the oppressively silent hall, shaken, startled,  ashamed of my garrulity, aching to get away. When he returned it was by  another of the many closed doors, and he found me awaiting him, hat in  hand. He was wearing his happiest look until he saw my hat.    \"Not going?\" he cried. \"My dear Cole, I can't apologize sufficiently for  my abrupt desertion of you, much less for the cause. It was my man,  just come in from the show, and gone up the back way. I accused him of  listening to our conversation. Of course he denies it; but it really  doesn't matter, as I'm sorry to say he's much too 'fresh' (as they call  it down here) to remember anything to-morrow morning. I let him have it,  I can tell you. Varlet! Caitiff! But if you bolt off on the head of it,  I shall go back and sack him into the bargain!\"    I assured him I had my own reasons for wishing to retire early. He could  have no conception of my weakness, my low and nervous condition of  body and mind; much as I had enjoyed myself, he must really let me go.  Another glass of wine, then? Just one more? No, I had drunk too much  already. I was in no state to stand it. And I held out my hand with  decision.    Instead of"]]]
