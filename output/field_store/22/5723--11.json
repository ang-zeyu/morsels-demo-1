The great masters are disappointing here. Raphael,  as the co-laborer of Pinturicchio, is dainty, rather than great, and  Michelangelo passes unnoticed in the huge and coldly elaborate  altar-front of the Piccolomini. But Marrina, with his doors of the  library; Barili, with his marvelous casing of the choir-stalls;  Beccafumi, with his bronze and neillo--these are the artists whom one  wonders at; these wood-carvers and bronze-founders, creators of the  microcosmic detail of the Renaissance which had at last burst  triumphantly into Siena.    This treasure is cumulative, as we walk eastward from the main door,  where the pillars are a maze of scroll-work in deepest cutting, and by  the time we reach the choir the head fairly swims with the play of light  and color. We wander from point to point, we finger and caress the  lustrous stalls of Barili, and turn with a kind of confusion of vision  from panel to panel; above our heads the tabernacle of Vecchietta, the  lamp bearing angels of Beccafumi make spots of bituminous color, with  glittering high-lights, strangely emphasizing their modeling; from these  youths, who might be pages to some Roman prefect, the eye travels upward  still further, along the golden convolutions of the heavily stuccoed  pilasters to the huge, gilded cherubs' heads that frame the eastern  rose....    It is incredible that these frescoes are four hundred years old. Surely  Pinturicchio came down from his scaffolding but yesterday. This is how  the hardly dried plaster must have looked to pope and cardinal and  princes when the boards were removed, and when the very figures on these  walls--smart youths in tights and slashes, bright-robed scholars,  ecclesiastics caped in ermine, ladies with long braids bound in nets of  silk--crowded to see themselves embalmed in tempera for curious  after-centuries to gaze upon.          THE ASSISSI OF ST. FRANCIS[29]    BY HIPPOLYTE ADOLPHE TAINE      On the summit of an abrupt height, over a double row of arcades, appears  the monastery; at its base a torrent plows the soil, winding off in the  distance between banks of boulders; beyond is the old town prolonging  itself on the ridge of the mountain. We ascend slowly under the burning  sun, and suddenly, at the end of a court surrounded by slender columns,  enter within the obscurity of the cathedral. It is unequalled; before  having seen it one has no idea of the art and the genius of the Middle  Ages. Append to it Dante and the \"Fioretti\" of St. Francis, and it  becomes the masterpiece of mystic Christianity.    There are three churches, one above the other, all of them arranged  around the tomb of St. Francis. Over this venerated body, which the  people regard as ever living and absorbed in prayer at the bottom of an  inaccessible cave, the edifice has arisen and gloriously flowered like  an architectural shrine. The lowest is a crypt, dark as a sepulcher,  into which the visitors descend with torches; pilgrims keep close to the  dripping walls and grope along in order to reach the grating.    Here is the tomb, in a pale, dim light, similar to that of limbo. A few  brass lamps, almost without lights, burn here eternally like stars lost  in mournful obscurity. The ascending smoke clings to the arches, and the  heavy odor of the tapers mingles with that of the cave. The guide trims  his torch; and the sudden flash in this horrible darkness, above the  bones of a corpse, is like one of Dante's visions. Here is the mystic  grave of a saint who, in the midst of corruption and worms, beholds his  slimy dungeon of earth filled with the supernatural radiance of the  Savior.    But that which can not be represented by words is the middle church, a  long, low spiracle supported by small, round arches curving in the  half-shadow, and whose voluntary depression makes one instinctively  bend his knees. A coating of somber blue and of reddish bands starred  with gold, a marvelous embroidery of ornaments, wreaths, delicate  scroll-work, leaves, and painted figures, covers the arches and ceilings  with its harmonious multitude; the eye is overwhelmed by it; a  population of forms and tints lives on its vaults; I would not exchange  this cavern for all the churches of Rome!    On the summit, the upper church shoots up as brilliant, as aerial, as  triumphant, as this is low and grave. Really, if one were to give way to  conjecture, he might suppose that in these three sanctuaries the  architect meant to represent the three worlds; below, the gloom of death  and the horrors of the infernal tomb; in the middle, the impassioned  anxiety of the beseeching Christian who strives and hopes in this world  of trial; aloft, the bliss and dazzling glory of Paradise.          RAVENNA[30]    BY EDWARD A. FREEMAN      With exceptions, all the monuments of Ravenna belong to the days of  transition from Roman to Medieval times, and the greater part of them  come within the fifth and sixth centuries. It was then that Ravenna  became, for a season, the head of Italy and of the Western world. The  sea had made Ravenna a great haven: the falling back of the sea made her  the ruling city of the earth. Augustus had called into being the port of  Caesarea as the Peiraieus of the Old Thessalian or Umbrian Ravenna.  Haven and city grew and became one; but the faithless element again fell  back; the haven of Augustus became dry land covered by orchards, and  Classis arose as the third station, leaving Ravenna itself an inland  city.    Again has the sea fallen back; Caesarea has utterly perished; Classis  survives only in one venerable church; the famous pine forest has grown  up between the third haven and the now distant Hadriatic. Out of all  this grew the momentary greatness of Ravenna. The city, girded with the  three fold zone of marshes, causeways, and strong walls, became the  impregnable shelter of the later Emperors; and the earliest Teutonic  Kings naturally fixt their royal seat in the city of their Imperial  predecessors. When this immediate need had passed away, the city  naturally fell into insignificance, and it plays hardly any part in the  history of Medieval Italy. Hence it is that the city is crowded with the  monuments of an age which has left hardly any monuments elsewhere.    In Britain, indeed, if Dr. Merivale be right in the date which he gives  to the great Northern wall, we have a wonderful relic of those times;  but it is the work, not of the architect, but of the military engineers.  In other parts of Europe also works of this date are found here and  there; but nowhere save at Ravenna is there a whole city, so to speak,  made up of them. Nowhere but at Ravenna can we find, thickly scattered  around us, the churches, the tombs, perhaps the palaces, of the last  Roman and the first Teutonic rulers of Italy. In the Old and in the New  Rome, and in Milan also, works of the same date exist; but either they  do not form the chief objects of the city, or they have lost their  character and position through later changes. If Ravenna boasts of the  tombs of Honorius and Theodoric, Milan boasts also, truly or falsely, of  the tombs of Stilicho and Athaulf. But at Milan we have to seek for the  so-called tomb of Athaulf in a side-chapel of a church which has lost  all ancient character, and the so-called tomb of Stilicho, tho placed in  the most venerable church of the city, stands in a strange position as  the support of a pulpit.    At Ravenna, on the other hand, the mighty mausoleum of Theodoric, and  the chapel which contains the tombs of Galla Placidia, her brother, and  her second husband, are among the best known and best preserved  monuments of the city. Ravenna, in the days of its Exarchs, could never  have dared to set up its own St. Vital as a rival to Imperial St.  Sophia. But at St. Sophia, changed into the temple of another faith, the  most characteristic ornaments have been hidden or torn away, while at  St. Vital Hebrew patriarchs and Christian saints, and the Imperial forms  of Justinian and his strangely-chosen Empress, still look down, as they  did thirteen hundred years back, upon the altars of Christian worship.  Ravenna, in short, seems, as it were, to have been preserved all but  untouched to keep up the memory of the days which were alike Roman,  Christian, and Imperial.          BENEDICTINE SUBIACO[31]    BY AUGUSTUS J. C. HARE      One of the excellent mountain roads constructed by Pius IX. leads  through a wild district from Olevano to Subiaco. A few miles before  reaching Subiaco we skirt a lake, probably one of the Simbrivii Lacus  which Nero is believed to have made by damming up the Anio. Here he  fished for trout with a golden net, and here he built the mountain villa  which he called Sublaqueum--a name which still exists in Subiaco.    Four centuries after the valley had witnessed the orgies of Nero, a  young patrician of the family of the Anicii-Benedictus, or \"the blessed  one,\" being only fourteen at the time, fled from the seductions of the  capital to the rocks of Mentorella, but, being followed thither, sought  a more complete solitude in a cave above the falls of the Anio. Here he  lived unknown to any except the hermit Romanus, who daily let down food  to him, half of his own loaf, by a cord from the top of the cliff. At  length the hiding-place was revealed to the village priest in a vision,  and pilgrims flocked from all quarters to the valley. Through the  disciples who gathered around Benedict, this desolate ravine became the  cradle of monastic life in the West, and twelve monasteries rose amid  its peaks under the Benedictine rule....    Nothing can exceed the solemn grandeur of the situation of the convent  dedicated to St. Scholastica, the sainted sister of St. Benedict, which  was founded in the fifth century, and which, till quite lately, included  as many as sixteen towns and villages among its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],[0,"Household Stories (#13)"],[1,"into the forest. And  when they had gone a long long way, they came at last to a little  house, and the maiden looked inside, and as it was empty she thought,    \"We might as well live here.\"    And she fetched leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the fawn, and  every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for  herself, and fresh grass for the fawn, who ate out of her hand with joy,  frolicking round her. At night, when the sister was tired, and had said  her prayers, she laid her head on the fawn's back, which served her for  a pillow, and softly fell asleep. And if only the brother could have got  back his own shape again, it would have been a charming life. So they  lived a long while in the wilderness alone.    Now it happened that the King of that country held a great hunt in the  forest. The blowing of the horns, the barking of the dogs, and the lusty  shouts of the huntsmen sounded through the wood, and the fawn heard them  and was eager to be among them.    \"Oh,\" said he to his sister, \"do let me go to the hunt; I cannot stay  behind any longer,\" and begged so long that at last she consented.    \"But mind,\" said she to him, \"come back to me at night. I must lock my  door against the wild hunters, so, in order that I may know you, you  must knock and say, 'Little sister, let me in,' and unless I hear that I  shall not unlock the door.\"    Then the fawn sprang out, and felt glad and merry in the open air. The  King and his huntsmen saw the beautiful animal, and began at once to  pursue him, but they could not come within reach of him, for when they  thought they were certain of him he sprang away over the bushes and  disappeared. As soon as it was dark he went back to the little house,  knocked at the door, and said,    \"Little sister, let me in.\"    Then the door was opened to him, and he went in, and rested the whole  night long on his soft bed. The next morning the hunt began anew, and  when the fawn heard the hunting-horns and the tally-ho of the huntsmen  he could rest no longer, and said,    \"Little sister, let me out, I must go.\" The sister opened the door and  said,    \"Now, mind you must come back at night and say the same words.\"    When the King and his hunters saw the fawn with the golden collar again,  they chased him closely, but he was too nimble and swift for them. This  lasted the whole day, and at last the hunters surrounded him, and one of  them wounded his foot a little, so that he was obliged to limp and to go  slowly. Then a hunter slipped after him to the little house, and heard  how he called out, \"Little sister, let me in,\" and saw the door open and  shut again after him directly. The hunter noticed all this carefully,  went to the King, and told him all he had seen and heard. Then said the  King,    \"To-morrow we will hunt again.\"    But the sister was very terrified when she saw that her fawn was  wounded. She washed his foot, laid cooling leaves round it, and said,  \"Lie down on your bed, dear fawn, and rest, that you may be soon well.\"  The wound was very slight, so that the fawn felt nothing of it the next  morning. And when he heard the noise of the hunting outside, he said,    \"I cannot stay in, I must go after them; I shall not be taken easily  again!\" The sister began to weep, and said,    \"I know you will be killed, and I left alone here in the forest, and  forsaken of everybody. I cannot let you go!\"    \"Then I shall die here with longing,\" answered the fawn; \"when I hear  the sound of the horn I feel as if I should leap out of my skin.\"    Then the sister, seeing there was no help for it, unlocked the door with  a heavy heart, and the fawn bounded away into the forest, well and  merry. When the King saw him, he said to his hunters,    \"Now, follow him up all day long till the night comes, and see that you  do him no hurt.\"    So as soon as the sun had gone down, the King said to the huntsmen:  \"Now, come and show me the little house in the wood.\"    And when he got to the door he knocked at it, and cried,    \"Little sister, let me in!\"    Then the door opened, and the King went in, and there stood a maiden  more beautiful than any he had seen before. The maiden shrieked out  when she saw, instead of the fawn, a man standing there with a gold  crown on his head. But the King looked kindly on her, took her by the  hand, and said,    \"Will you go with me to my castle, and be my dear wife?\"    \"Oh yes,\" answered the maiden, \"but the fawn must come too. I could not  leave him.\" And the King said,    \"He shall remain with you as long as you live, and shall lack nothing.\"  Then the fawn came bounding in, and the sister tied the cord of rushes  to him, and led him by her own hand out of the little house.    The King put the beautiful maiden on his horse, and carried her to his  castle, where the wedding was held with great pomp; so she became lady  Queen, and they lived together happily for a long while; the fawn was  well tended and cherished, and he gambolled about the castle garden.    Now the wicked stepmother, whose fault it was that the children were  driven out into the world, never dreamed but that the sister had been  eaten up by wild beasts in the forest, and that the brother, in the  likeness of a fawn, had been slain by the hunters. But when she heard  that they were so happy, and that things had gone so well with them,  jealousy and envy arose in her heart, and left her no peace, and her  chief thought was how to bring misfortune upon them.    Her own daughter, who was as ugly as sin, and had only one eye,  complained to her, and said,    \"I never had the chance of being a Queen.\"    \"Never mind,\" said the old woman, to satisfy her; \"when the time comes,  I shall be at hand.\"    After a while the Queen brought a beautiful baby-boy into the world, and  that day the King was out hunting. The old witch took the shape of the  bedchamber woman, and went into the room where the Queen lay, and said  to her,    \"Come, the bath is ready; it will give you refreshment and new strength.  Quick, or it will be cold.\"    Her daughter was within call, so they carried the sick Queen into the  bath-room, and left her there. And in the bath-room they had made a  great fire, so as to suffocate the beautiful young Queen.    When that was managed, the old woman took her daughter, put a cap on  her, and laid her in the bed in the Queen's place, gave her also the  Queen's form and countenance, only she could not restore the lost eye.  So, in order that the King might not remark it, she had to lie on the  side where there was no eye. In the evening, when the King came home and  heard that a little son was born to him, he rejoiced with all his heart,  and was going at once to his dear wife's bedside to see how she did.  Then the old woman cried hastily,    \"For your life, do not draw back the curtains, to let in the light upon  her; she must be kept quiet.\" So the King went away, and never knew that  a false Queen was lying in the bed.    Now, when it was midnight, and every one was asleep, the nurse, who was  sitting by the cradle in the nursery and watching there alone, saw the  door open, and the true Queen come in. She took the child out of the  cradle, laid it in her bosom, and fed it. Then she shook out its little  pillow, put the child back again, and covered it with the coverlet. She  did not forget the fawn either: she went to him where he lay in the  corner, and stroked his back tenderly. Then she went in perfect silence  out at the door, and the nurse next morning asked the watchmen if any  one had entered the castle during the night, but they said they had seen  no one. And the Queen came many nights, and never said a word; the nurse  saw her always, but she did not dare speak of it to any one.    After some time had gone by in this manner, the Queen seemed to find  voice, and said one night,        \"My child my fawn twice more I come to see,      Twice more I come, and then the end must be.\"    The nurse said nothing, but as soon as the Queen had disappeared she  went to the King and told him all. The King said,    \"Ah, heaven! what do I hear! I will myself watch by the child to-morrow  night.\"    So at evening he went into the nursery, and at midnight the Queen  appeared, and said,        \"My child my fawn once more I come to see,      Once more I come, and then the end must be.\"    And she tended the child, as she was accustomed to do, before she  vanished. The King dared not speak to her, but he watched again the  following night, and heard her say,        \"My child my fawn this once I come to see,      This once I come, and now the end must be.\"    Then the King could contain himself no longer, but rushed towards her,  saying,    \"You are no other than my dear wife!\" Then she answered,    \"Yes, I am your dear wife,\" and in that moment, by the grace of heaven,  her life returned to her, and she was once more well and strong. Then  she told the King the snare that the wicked witch and her daughter had  laid for her. The King had them both brought to judgment, and sentence  was passed upon them. The daughter was sent away into the wood, where  she was devoured by the wild beasts, and the witch was burned, and ended  miserably. And as soon as her body was in ashes the spell was removed  from the fawn, and he took human shape again; and then the sister and  brother lived happily together until the end.          RAPUNZEL      THERE once lived a man and his wife, who had long wished for a child,  but in vain. Now there was at the back of their house a little window  which overlooked a beautiful garden full of the finest vegetables and  flowers; but there was a high wall all round it, and no one ventured  into it, for it belonged to a witch of great might, and of whom all the  world was afraid. One day that the wife was standing at the window, and  looking into the garden, she saw a bed filled with the finest rampion;  and it looked so fresh and"]]]
