So they took some stones and some pine-cones  in their pockets, and climbed up into a tree; and when the beasts lay  down, they dropped a stone down upon that one which was the unicorn. He  said to the next: \"Be quiet; don't butt me.\" It said: \"I'm not doing  anything to you.\" Again they let a stone fall from above upon the  unicorn. \"Be quiet! you've already done it to me twice.\" \"Indeed, I'm  doing nothing to you.\" So they attacked each other and fought together.  The unicorn wanted to pierce the second beast through; but it jumped out  of the way, and he rushed so violently after it, that he struck his horn  into a tree, and couldn't pull it out quickly. So they sprang speedily  down from the fir, and the other two beasts ran away and escaped, but  they cut off the head of the third, the unicorn, took it up, and carried  it to the castle.    Now those in the castle saw that George had again accomplished that  task. \"What, prithee, shall we do? Perhaps we must after all give him  the damsel!\" \"No, sire,\" said one of the attendants, \"that cannot be; he  is too lowborn to obtain a king's daughter! On the contrary, we must  clear him out of the world.\" So the king ordered them to note his words,  what he should say. There was a hired female servant there, and she said  to him: \"George, it will be evil for you to-day; they're going to clear  you out of the world.\" He answered: \"Oh, I'm not afraid. When I was only  just twelve years old, I killed twelve of them at one blow!\" But this  was the fact: when his mother was baking a flat-cake, a dozen flies  settled upon her, and he killed them all at a single blow.    When they heard this, they said: \"Nothing else will do but we must shoot  him.\" So they drew up the soldiers, and said they would hold a review in  his honour, for they would celebrate the wedding in the square before  the castle. Then they conducted him thither, and the soldiers were  already going to let fly at him. But George said to the man who held his  thumb in the bottle in the place of a stopper: \"You said, if you pulled  your thumb out, you could besprinkle everything. Pull it out--quick!\"  \"Oh, sir, I'll easily perform that.\" So he pulled out his thumb and gave  them all such a sprinkling that they were all blind, and not one could  see.    So, when they perceived that nothing else was to be done, they told him  to go, for they would give him the damsel. Then they gave him a handsome  royal robe, and the wedding took place. I, too, was at the wedding; they  had music there, sang, ate, and drank; there was meat, there were  cheesecakes, and baskets full of everything, and buckets full of strong  waters. To-day I went, yesterday I came; I found an egg among the  tree-stumps; I knocked it against somebody's head, and gave him a bald  place, and he's got it still.          XIII    THE WONDERFUL HAIR      There was a man who was very poor, but so well supplied with children  that he was utterly unable to maintain them, and one morning more than  once prepared to kill them, in order not to see their misery in dying of  hunger, but his wife prevented him. One night a child came to him in his  sleep, and said to him: \"Man! I see that you are making up your mind to  destroy and to kill your poor little children, and I know that you are  distressed there at; but in the morning you will find under your pillow  a mirror, a red kerchief, and an embroidered pocket-handkerchief; take  all three secretly and tell nobody; then go to such a hill; by it you  will find a stream; go along it till you come to its fountain-head;  there you will find a damsel as bright as the sun, with her hair hanging  down over her back. Be on your guard, that the ferocious she-dragon do  not coil round you; do not converse with her if she speaks; for if you  converse with her, she will poison you, and turn you into a fish or  something else, and will then devour you but if she bids you examine her  head, examine it, and as you turn over her hair, look, and you will find  one hair as red as blood; pull it out and run back again; then, if she  suspects and begins to run after you, throw her first the embroidered  pocket-handkerchief, then the kerchief, and, lastly, the mirror; then  she will find occupation for herself. And sell that hair to some rich  man; but don't let them cheat you, for that hair is worth countless  wealth; and you will thus enrich yourself and maintain your children.\"    When the poor man awoke, he found everything under his pillow, just as  the child had told him in his sleep; and then he went to the hill. When  there, he found the stream, went on and on alongside of it, till he came  to the fountain-head. Having looked about him to see where the damsel  was, he espied her above a piece of water, like sunbeams threaded on a  needle, and she was embroidering at a frame on stuff, the threads of  which were young men's hair. As soon as he saw her, he made a reverence  to her, and she stood on her feet and questioned him: \"Whence are you,  unknown young man?\" But he held his tongue. She questioned him again:  \"Who are you? Why have you come?\" and much else of all sorts; but he was  as mute as a stone, making signs with his hands, as if he were deaf and  wanted help. Then she told him to sit down on her skirt. He did not wait  for any more orders, but sat down, and she bent down her head to him,  that he might examine it. Turning over the hair of her head, as if to  examine it, he was not long in finding that red hair, and separated it  from the other hair, pulled it out, jumped off her skirt and ran away  back as he best could. She noticed it, and ran at his heels full speed  after him. He looked round, and seeing that she was about to overtake  him, threw, as he was told, the embroidered pocket-handkerchief on the  way, and when she saw the pocket-handkerchief she stooped and began to  overhaul it in every direction, admiring the embroidery, till he had got  a good way off. Then the damsel placed the pocket-handkerchief in her  bosom, and ran after him again. When he saw that she was about to  overtake him, he threw the red kerchief, and she again occupied  herself, admiring and gazing, till the poor man had again got a good way  off. Then the damsel became exasperated, and threw both the  pocket-handkerchief and the kerchief on the way, and ran after him in  pursuit. Again, when he saw that she was about to overtake him, he threw  the mirror. When the damsel came to the mirror, the like of which she  had never seen before, she lifted it up, and when she saw herself in it,  not knowing that it was herself, but thinking that it was somebody else,  she, as it were, fell in love with herself in the mirror, and the man  got so far off that she was no longer able to overtake him. When she saw  that she could not catch him, she turned back, and the man reached his  home safe and sound. After arriving at his home, he showed his wife the  hair, and told her all that had happened to him, but she began to jeer  and laugh at him. But he paid no attention to her, and went to a town to  sell the hair. A crowd of all sorts of people and merchants collected  round him; one offered a sequin, another two, and so on, higher and  higher, till they came to a hundred gold sequins. Just then the emperor  heard of the hair, summoned the man into his presence, and said to him  that he would give him a thousand sequins for it, and he sold it to him.  What was the hair? The emperor split it in two from top to bottom, and  found registered in it in writing many remarkable things, which happened  in the olden time since the beginning of the world. Thus the man became  rich and lived on with his wife and children. And that child, that came  to him in his sleep, was an angel sent by the Lord God, whose will it  was to aid the poor man, and to reveal secrets which had not been  revealed till then.          XIV    THE DRAGON AND THE PRINCE      There was an emperor who had three sons. One day the eldest son went out  hunting, and, when he got outside the town, up sprang a hare out of a  bush, and he after it, and hither and thither, till the hare fled into a  water-mill, and the prince after it. But it was not a hare, but a  dragon, and it waited for the prince and devoured him. When several days  had elapsed and the prince did not return home, people began to wonder  why it was that he was not to be found. Then the middle son went  hunting, and as he issued from the town, a hare sprang out of a bush,  and the prince after it, and hither and thither, till the hare fled into  the water-mill and the prince after it; but it was not a hare, but a  dragon, which waited for and devoured him. When some days had elapsed  and the princes did not return, either of them, the whole court was in  sorrow. Then the third son went hunting, to see whether he could not  find his brothers. When he issued from the town, again up sprang a hare  out of a bush, and the prince after it, and hither and thither, till the  hare fled into the water-mill. But the prince did not choose to follow  it, but went to find other game, saying to himself: \"When I return I  shall find you.\" After thus he went for a long time up and down the  hill, but found nothing, and then returned to the water-mill; but when  he got there, there was only an old woman in the mill. The prince  invoked God in addressing her: \"God help you, old woman!\" The old woman  replied: \"God help you, my son!\" Then the prince asked her: \"Where, old  woman, is my hare?\" She replied: \"My son, that was not a hare, but a  dragon. It kills and throttles many people.\" Hearing this, the prince  was somewhat disturbed, and said to the old woman: \"What shall we do  now? Doubtless my two brothers also have perished here.\" The old woman  answered: \"They have indeed; but there's no help for it. Go home, my  son, lest you follow them.\" Then he said to her: \"Dear old woman, do you  know "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15170"],[0,"The Child's World: Third Reader (#13)"],[1,"where everything looked as  if it had been turned to stone. There was not a single human being to be  seen. They walked along the great wide hall, but still they saw no one.    \"The castle must be enchanted,\" the brothers said to one another.    After passing through many rooms, they came to a door in which there  were three locks. In the middle of the door was a little grating through  which they could look into the room beyond.    They saw a little man, dressed in gray, seated at a table. Twice they  called to him, but he did not answer. They called a third time. Then he  rose, opened the three locks, and came out.    He said not a word, but led them to a table on which a feast was spread.  When they had eaten and drunk as much as they wished, the old man showed  each of them to a bedroom. There they rested well all night.    The next morning the little gray man came to the eldest brother and  beckoned him to follow. He led him to a room in which there was a stone  table, and on the table there lay three stone tablets.    [Illustration: The little gray man and the tablets]    On the table near the tablets was written:    \"This castle is enchanted. Before the enchantment can be broken, there  are three tasks to be performed. The one who performs these three tasks  shall marry the youngest and dearest of the three princesses who now lie  asleep in the castle.\"    When the eldest brother had read this, the old man gave him the first  tablet. On it was written:    \"In the forest, hidden beneath the thick moss, are the pearls which  belonged to the princesses. They are a thousand in number. These must be  collected by sunset. If one single pearl is missing, then he who has  sought them shall be turned to stone.\"    The eldest brother searched the whole day long, but by sunset he had  found only a hundred pearls. So he was turned to stone.    The following day the second brother tried his luck, but by sunset he  had found but two hundred pearls. So he, too, was turned to stone.    Then it came the simpleton's turn. He searched all day amidst the moss,  but he fared little better than his brothers. At last he sat down upon a  stone and burst into tears.    As he sat there, the king of the ants, whose life he had once saved,  came with five thousand ants. Before long the little creatures had found  every one of the pearls and piled them up in a heap.    The little gray man then gave the simpleton the second tablet. Upon it  was written the second task:    \"The key that opens the chamber in which the princesses are sleeping  lies in the bottom of the lake. He who has performed the first task must  find the key.\"    When the simpleton came to the lake, the ducks which he had saved were  swimming upon it. At once they dived down into the depths below and  brought up the key.    The simpleton showed the key to the little gray man, who then gave him  the third tablet. On it was written the third task:    \"The one who has gathered the pearls and found the key to the chamber  may now marry the youngest and dearest princess. He must, however, first  tell which is she. The princesses are exactly alike, but there is one  difference. Before they went to sleep, the eldest ate sugar, the second  ate syrup, and the youngest ate honey.\"    The simpleton laid down the tablet with a sigh. \"How can I find out  which princess ate the honey?\" he asked himself.    However, he put the key he had found in the lock and opened the door. In  the chamber the three princesses were lying. Ah, which was the youngest?    Just then the queen of the bees flew in through the window and tasted  the lips of all three. When she came to the lips that had sipped the  honey, she remained there. Then the young man knew that this was the  youngest and dearest princess.    So the enchantment came to an end. The sleepers awoke, and those who had  been turned to stone became alive again. The simpleton married the  youngest and dearest princess, and was made king after her father's  death. His two brothers, who were now sorry for what they had done,  married the other two princesses, and lived happily ever after.    --GRIMM.          [Illustration: A child dancing]    THE WORLD'S MUSIC        The world's a very happy place,      Where every child should dance and sing,    And always have a smiling face,      And never sulk for anything.      I waken when the morning's come,      And feel the air and light alive    With strange sweet music like the hum      Of bees about their busy hive.      The linnets play among the leaves      At hide-and-seek, and chirp and sing;    While, flashing to and from the eaves,      The swallows twitter on the wing.      From dawn to dark the old mill-wheel      Makes music, going round and round;    And dusty-white with flour and meal,      The miller whistles to its sound.      The brook that flows beside the mill,      As happy as a brook can be,    Goes singing its old song until      It learns the singing of the sea.      For every wave upon the sands      Sings songs you never tire to hear,    Of laden ships from sunny lands      Where it is summer all the year.      The world is such a happy place      That children, whether big or small,    Should always have a smiling face      And never, never sulk at all.    --GABRIEL SETOUN.          THE SLEEPING BEAUTY    I      Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who were very unhappy  because they had no children. But at last a little daughter was born,  and their sorrow was turned to joy. All the bells in the land were rung  to tell the glad tidings.    The king gave a christening feast so grand that the like of it had never  been known. He invited all the fairies he could find in the  kingdom--there were seven of them--to come to the christening as  godmothers. He hoped that each would give the princess a good gift.    When the christening was over, the feast came. Before each of the  fairies was placed a plate with a spoon, a knife, and a fork--all pure  gold. But alas! as the fairies were about to seat themselves at the  table, there came into the hall a very old fairy who had not been  invited. She had left the kingdom fifty years before and had not been  seen or heard of until this day.    The king at once ordered that a plate should be brought for her, but he  could not furnish a gold one such as the others had. This made the old  fairy angry, and she sat there muttering to herself.    Her angry threats were overheard by a young fairy who sat near. This  good godmother, fearing the old fairy might give the child an unlucky  gift, hid herself behind a curtain. She did this because she wished to  speak last and perhaps be able to change the old fairy's gift.    At the end of the feast, the youngest fairy stepped forward and said,  \"The princess shall be the most beautiful woman in the world.\"    The second said,    \"She shall have a temper as sweet as an angel.\"    The third said,    \"She shall have a wonderful grace in all she does or says.\"    [Illustration: The old fairy looks at the princess in her cradle]    The fourth said,    \"She shall sing like a nightingale.\"    The fifth said,    \"She shall dance like a flower in the wind.\"    The sixth said,    \"She shall play such music as was never heard on earth.\"    Then the old fairy's turn came. Shaking her head spitefully, she said,    \"When the princess is seventeen years old, she shall prick her finger  with a spindle, and--she--shall--die!\"    At this all the guests trembled, and many of them began to weep. The  king and queen wept loudest of all.    Just then the wise young fairy came from behind the curtain and said:  \"Do not grieve, O King and Queen. Your daughter shall not die. I cannot  undo what my elder sister has done; the princess shall indeed prick her  finger with the spindle, but she shall not die. She shall fall into  sleep that will last a hundred years. At the end of that time, a king's  son will find her and awaken her.\"    Immediately all the fairies vanished.      II      The king, hoping to save his child even from this misfortune, commanded  that all spindles should be burned. This was done, but it was all in  vain.    One day when the princess was seventeen years of age, the king and queen  left her alone in the castle. She wandered about the palace and at last  came to a little room in the top of a tower. There an old woman--so old  and deaf that she had never heard of the king's command--sat spinning.    \"What are you doing, good old woman?\" asked the princess.    \"I am spinning, my pretty child.\"    \"Ah,\" said the princess. \"How do you do it? Let me see if I can spin  also.\"    She had just taken the spindle in her hand when, in some way, it pricked  her finger. The princess dropped down on the floor. The old woman called  for help, and people came from all sides, but nothing could be done.    When the good young fairy heard the news, she came quickly to the  castle. She knew that the princess must sleep a hundred years and would  be frightened if she found herself alone when she awoke. So the fairy  touched with her magic wand all in the palace except the king and the  queen. Ladies, gentlemen, pages, waiting maids, footmen, grooms in the  stable, and even the horses--she touched them all. They all went to  sleep just where they were when the wand touched them. Some of the  gentlemen were bowing to the ladies, the ladies were embroidering, the  grooms stood currying their horses, and the cook was slapping the  kitchen boy.    The king and queen departed from the castle, giving orders that no one  was to go near it. This command, however, was not needed. In a little  while there sprang around the castle a wood so thick that neither man  nor beast could pass through.      III      A great many changes take place in a hundred years. The king had no  other child, and when he died, his throne passed to another royal  family. Even the story of the sleeping princess was almost forgotten."]]]
