[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19192"],[0,"What is Darwinism? (#13)"],[1,"e, it is a reality only for those whose  views of animal and vegetable life are to the last degree superficial.  Any one who has gone deeper into the organization and vital activity of  animals and plants, who has made himself familiar with the action and  reaction of vital phenomena, and the so-called economy of nature, comes  of necessity to the conclusion, that design does not exist, any more  than the vaunted goodness of the Creator\" (die vielgeruehmte Allguete des  Schoepfers). (p. 17)    Professor Huxley, in his review of this work of Haeckel, already quoted,  says: \"I do not like to conclude without reminding the reader of my  entire concurrence with the general tenor and spirit of the work, and of  my high estimate of its value.\" If you take out of Haeckel's book its  doctrine of Monism, which he himself says means Materialism, it has no  \"tenor or spirit\" in it. It is not, however, for us to say how far  Professor Huxley intended his indorsement to go.    Haeckel says that Darwin's theory of evolution leads inevitably to  Atheism and Materialism. In this we think he is correct. But we have  nothing to do with Haeckel's logic or with our own. We make no charge  against Mr. Darwin. We cite Haeckel merely as a witness to the fact that  Darwinism involves the denial of final causes; that it excludes all  intelligent design in the production of the organs of plants and  animals, and even in the production of the soul and body of man. This  first of German naturalists would occupy a strange position in the sight  of all Europe, if, after lauding a book to the skies because it teaches  a certain doctrine, it should turn out that the book taught no such  doctrine at all.

Von Dr. Ernst Haeckel,  Professor in der Universitaet Jena. Zweite Auflage, Berlin, 1873, pp. 8,  and 9.      _The Opponents of Darwinism._      _The Duke of Argyll._    When cultivated men undertake to refute a certain system, it is to be  presumed that they give themselves the trouble to ascertain what that  system is. As the advocates of Mr. Darwin's theory defend and applaud it  because it excludes design, and as its opponents make that the main  ground of their objection to it, there can be no reasonable doubt as to  its real character. The question is, How are the contrivances in nature  to be accounted for? One answer is, They are due to the purpose of God.  Mr. Darwin says, They are due to the gradual and undesigned accumulation  of slight variations. The Duke's first objection to that doctrine is,  that the evidence of design in the organs of plants and animals is so  clear that Mr. Darwin himself cannot avoid using teleological language.  \"He exhausts,\" he says, \"every form of words and of illustration by  which intention or mental purpose can be described. 'Contrivance,'  'beautiful contrivance,' 'curious contrivance,' are expressions which  occur over and over again. Here is one sentence describing a particular  species (of orchids): 'The labellum is developed _in order_ to attract  the Lepidoptera; and we shall soon see reason for supposing that the  nectar is purposely so lodged, that it can be sucked only slowly _in  order_ to give time for the curious chemical quality of the matter  setting hard and dry.'\"[31] We have already seen that Mr. Darwin's  answer to this objection is, that it is hard to keep from personifying  nature, and that these expressions as used by him mean no more than  chemists mean when they speak of affinities, and one element preferring  another.    A second objection is, that a variation would not be useful to the  individual in which it happens to occur, unless other variations should  occur at the right time and in the right order; and that the concurrence  of so many accidents as are required to account for the infinite  diversity of forms in plants and animals, is altogether inconceivable.    A third objection is, that the variations often have no reference to the  organism of the animal itself but to other organisms. \"Take one  instance,\" he says, \"out of millions. The poison of a deadly snake,--let  us for a moment consider what that is. It is a secretion of definite  chemical properties with reference not only--not even mainly--to the  organism of the animal in which it is developed, but specially to  another animal which it is intended to destroy.\" \"How,\" he asks, \"will  the law of growth adjust a poison in one animal with such subtle  knowledge of the organization of the other, that the deadly virus shall  in a few minutes curdle the blood, benumb the nerves, and rush in upon  the citadel of life? There is but one explanation: a Mind having minute  and perfect knowledge of the structure of both has designed the one to  be capable of inflicting death upon the other. This mental purpose and  resolve is the one thing which our intelligence perceives with direct  and intuitive recognition. The method of creation by which this purpose  has been carried into effect is utterly unknown.\"[32]    A fourth objection has reference to beauty. According to Mr. Darwin,  flowers are not intentionally made beautiful, but those which happen to  be beautiful attract insects, and by their agency are fertilized and  survive. Male birds are not intentionally arrayed in bright colors, but  those which happen to be so arrayed are attractive, and thus become the  progenitors of their race. Against this explanation the Duke earnestly  protests. He refers to the gorgeous adorned class of Hummingbirds, of  which naturalists enumerate no less than four hundred and thirty  different species, distinguished one from the other, in general, only by  their plumage. \"Now,\" he asks, \"what explanation does the law of natural  selection give,--I will not say of the origin, but even of the  continuance of such specific varieties as these? None whatever. A crest  of topaz is no better in the struggle of existence than a crest of  sapphire. A frill ending in spangles of the emerald is no better in the  battle of life than a frill ending in spangles of the ruby. A tail is  not affected for the purposes of flight, whether its marginal, or its  central feathers are decorated with white. It is impossible to bring  such varieties into any physical law known to us. It has relation  however to a Purpose, which stands in close analogy with our knowledge  of purpose in the works of men. Mere beauty and mere variety, for their  own sake, are objects which we ourselves seek, when we can make the  forces of nature subordinate to the attainment of them. There seems to  be no conceivable reason why we should doubt or question that these are  ends and aims also in the forms given to living organisms, when the  facts correspond with this view and with no other.\"[33]    It will be observed that all these objections have reference to the  denial of teleology on the part of Mr. Darwin. If his theory admitted  that the organisms in nature were due to a divine purpose, the  objections would be void of all meaning.    There is a fifth objection. According to Darwin's theory organs are  formed by the slow accumulation of unintended variations, which happen  to be favorable to the subject of them in the struggle for life. But in  many cases these organs, instead of being favorable, are injurious or  cumbersome until fully developed. Take the wing of a bird, for example.  In its rudimental state, it is useful neither for swimming, walking, nor  flying. Now, as Darwin says it took millions of years to bring the eye  to perfection, how long did it take to render a rudimental wing useful?  It is no sufficient answer to say that these rudimental organs might  have been suited to the condition in which the animal existed, during  the formative process. This is perfectly arbitrary. It has no basis of  fact. There are but three kinds of locomotion that we know of: in the  water, on the ground, and through the air; for all these purposes a  half-formed wing would be an impediment.    The Duke devotes almost a whole chapter of his interesting book to the  consideration of \"contrivance in the machinery for flight.\" The  conditions to secure regulated movement through the atmosphere are so  numerous, so complicated, and so conflicting, that the problem never has  been solved by human ingenuity. In the structure of the bird it is  solved to perfection. As we are not writing a teleological argument, but  only producing evidence that Darwinism excludes teleology, we cannot  follow the details which prove that the wing of the gannet or swift is  almost as wonderful and beautiful a specimen of contrivance as the eye  of the eagle.

He wrote as a naturalist, and  therefore his objections are principally directed against the theory of  evolution, which he regarded as not only destitute of any scientific  basis, but as subversive of the best established facts in zooelogy.  Nevertheless it is evident that his zeal was greatly intensified by his  apprehension that a theory which obliterates all evidence of the being  of God from the works of nature, endangered faith in that great doctrine  itself. The Rev. Dr. Peabody, in the discourse delivered on the occasion  of Professor Agassiz's funeral, said: \"I cannot close this hasty and  inadequate, yet fervent and hearty tribute, without recalling to your  memory the reverent spirit in which he pursued his scientific labors.

The Russian  mystic Serge Nilus, in his later editions, connected the documents with  the Zionist Congress in Basle and with the head of the Zionist movement,  Dr. Theodore Herzl.    The translator, as do Nilus and Lutostansky, also gives a version of  \"the political plan devised by the Wise Men of Zion.\" This translator,  however, states that the \"political plan was conceived 929 years before  the birth of Christ.

They were taken out of a whole book of protocols, the       entire contents of which it was impossible to copy because of the       short time allowed the translator for reading these protocols. A       small appendix was attached to them and a plan of conquering the       world by the Jews by peaceful means. Those protocols and the Sketch       were taken from the secret depositories of the Main Office of Zion,       now located on French territory.         \"The above-mentioned sketch contained the entire political plan of       Zion with regard to the stages to be passed through by this       movement and to the means of passing from one to another. The       aforesaid political plan was conceived 929 years before the birth       of Christ. It was invented by Solomon and the Judean Sages in       theory; according to historical events, it was elaborated and       enlarged by their followers initiated in this plan.         \"These sages decided to conquer the world peacefully for Zion, with       the cunning of the Symbolic Snake, whose head should be composed of       the Jewish Government initiated in the plans of the Wise Men       (always masked even to their people), and the body--the Jewish       nation.         \"Crawling into the bosom of governments, this snake has undermined       or eaten away all non-Jewish governmental powers, according to       their growth, in various continents, but particularly in Europe,       which he should do also in the future, following exactly the       outlines of the plan until the cycle of the road travelled by it       will close by the return of the head of the Snake to Zion,--that is,       until this snake will include in the sphere of its circle all       Europe, and through Europe the whole world, utilizing all forces       conquered by economic means in order to draw the other continents       into the sphere of its cycle....         \"For instance, the economic theory of the ballot system has made it       possible to carry out everything that was desirable in the       interests of the elevation of Zion. The Jewish authorities       commenced to act by means of bribing or by instigating the majority       of votes as soon as they succeeded to manage so that the decisions       of that majority became the determining factor in questions of       national life. The crowd always in need, or the greedy intelligent       class, short-sighted liberals and other blind people have also       rendered good service to Zion. Therefore the republican is the most       desirable and convenient form of government for Zion because it       gives full sway for the activities of the armies of Zion--for       anarchists of thought and action, called socialists.         \"All that which is outlined above is the work of the hands of the       nation without a territory, constituting but a drop in the ocean of       humanity, but possessing the most ideal Government, every member of       which is familiarized with the plan of action worked out in the       course of centuries, from which he cannot deviate. The politics of       the goyim is the politics of accidental circumstances, engineered       by the Jews, and tends not towards perfecting the affairs of the       state, but towards struggle for the sake of greed, or more often       for the personal aggrandizement of the administrators.         \"From this it is clear, on whose side there must be victory and the       guidance of the world.         \"Translation from the French, December 9, 1901.\"          CHAPTER SIX    THE BLACK HUNDREDS, THEIR DUPES AND CRIMES    Russia in 1905--The Unsuccessful Revolution--The Reaction and the  Reactionaries--Lutostansky and His Work--The \"Symbolic Snake\" According to  Lutostansky--Who Plagiarized?--Lutostansky on the English People--Are the  English the \"Lost Tribes\"?--How the Protocols Were \"Doctored\" by  Butmi--Conclusion.      As the writings of Sergius Nilus are typical of the \"literature\"  produced under the auspices of the Russian Black Hundred organizations  which sought to save the Czar's throne by pogroms, I examined a large  number of publications brought out in Russia during the period when \"the  Russian Mystic,\" Sergius Nilus, published his pretended discovery, the  \"Protocols.\" His book, \"The Great in the Small and anti-Christ,\"  appeared in 1905 after the Russo-Japanese War, when the Russian  revolutionists made an attempt to overthrow the Czar's government. A new  organization was formed for the support of the Russian throne. It was  known as \"the Union of the Russian People,\"--\"the Black Hundred,\"--whose  program was Jew-baiting. It was then that Russia adopted a definite,  anti-Jewish policy of vengeance--a pogrom policy. The \"Black Hundred\"  held the Jews responsible for Russia's defeat in the war and for the  attempted revolution,--and neither the Czar nor his loyal organization of  the \"Black Hundred\" ever forgave Count Sergius Witte, who won for Russia  at the Portsmouth Peace Conference what she had lost on the  battlefields, for inducing Nicholas II to grant a constitution to  Russia. \"The Black Hundreds\" nicknamed Witte \"the Jewish Count of  Portsmouth.\" They attacked him and attempted to assassinate him. They  assassinated at that time two Jewish members of the Duma, Yollos and  Hertzenstein. It was during that period of Judophobomania that Sergius  Nilus published his book introducing the \"Protocols\" in Russia.
