It serves as a landmark of that age, which, by the way, needed  landmarks, for it was an age of something between scientific twilight  and absolute darkness. _Morder_ in French, derived from the Latin  _mordere_, means \"to bite,\" and formerly the users of mordants in dyeing  and printing believed their action to be merely a mechanical action,  that is, that they exerted a biting or corroding influence, serving to  open the pores of the fabrics, and thus to give more ready ingress to  the colour or dye.    Most mordants are salts, or bodies resembling salts, and hence we must  commence our study of mordants by a consideration of the nature of  salts. I have already told you that acids are characterised by what we  term an acid reaction upon certain vegetable and artificial colours,  whilst bases or basic substances in solution, especially alkalis,  restore those colours, or turn them to quite another shade; the acids do  the one thing, and the alkalis and soluble bases do the opposite. The  strongest and most soluble bases are the alkalis--soda, potash, and  ammonia. You all know, probably, that a drop of vitriol allowed to fall  on a black felt hat will stain that hat red if the hat has been dyed  with logwood black; and if you want to restore the black, you can do  this by touching the stain with a drop of strong ammonia. But the use  of a black felt hat as a means of detecting acidity or alkalinity would  not commend itself to an economic mind, and we find a very excellent  reagent for the purpose in extract of litmus or litmus tincture, as well  as in blotting paper stained therewith. The litmus is turned bright red  by acids and blue by alkalis. If the acid is exactly neutralised by,  that is combined with, the alkaline base to form fully neutralised  salts, the litmus paper takes a purple tint. Coloured reagents such as  litmus are termed indicators. A substance called phenolphthalein, a  coal-tar product, is a very delicate indicator; it is more sensitive to  acids than litmus is. Now there are some salts which contain a  preponderance of acid in their composition, _i.e._ in which the acid has  not been fully neutralised by the base; such salts are termed acid  salts. Bicarbonate of soda is one of these acid salts, but so feeble is  carbonic acid in its acid properties and practical evidences, that we  shall see both monocarbonate or \"neutral\" carbonate of soda and  bicarbonate or \"acid\" carbonate of soda show evidences of, or, as  chemists say, react with alkalinity towards litmus. However,  phenolphthalein, though reacting alkaline with monocarbonate of soda,  indicates the acidity of the bicarbonate of soda, a thing which, as I  have just said, litmus will not do. We will take two jars containing  solution of monocarbonate of soda, and in the first we will put some  phenolphthalein solution, and in the second, some litmus tincture. The  solution in the first jar turns rose coloured, and in the second, blue,  indicating in each case that the solution is alkaline. If now, however,  carbonic acid be blown into the two solutions, that in the first jar,  containing the phenolphthalein, becomes colourless as soon as the  monocarbonate of soda is converted into bicarbonate, and this  disappearance of the rose colour indicates acidity; the blue solution in  the jar containing litmus, on the other hand, is not altered by blowing  in carbonic acid. Furthermore, if to the colourless solution containing  phenolphthalein, and which is acid towards that reagent, a little  reddened litmus is added, this is still turned blue, and so still  indicates the presence of alkali. We have, therefore, in bicarbonate of  soda a salt which behaves as an acid to phenolphthalein and as an alkali  to litmus. Another extremely sensitive indicator is the coal-tar  dyestuff known as \"Congo red\"; the colour changes produced by it are  exactly the inverse of those produced in the case of litmus, that is, it  gives a blue colour with acids and a red colour with alkalis.    We have now learned that acids are as the antipodes to alkalis or bases,  and that the two may combine to form products which may be neutral or  may have a preponderance either of acidity or of basicity--in short,  they may yield neutral, acid, or basic salts. I must try to give you a  yet clearer idea of these three classes of salts. Now acids in general  have, as we have seen, what we may call a \"chemical appetite,\" and each  acid in particular has a \"specific chemical appetite\" for bases, that  is, each acid is capable of combining with a definite quantity of an  individual base. The terms \"chemical appetite\" and \"specific chemical  appetite\" are names I have coined for your present benefit, but for  which chemists would use the words \"affinity\" and \"valency\"  respectively. Now some acids have a moderate specific appetite, whilst  others possess a large one, and the same may be said of bases, and thus  as an example we may have mono-, di-, and tri-acid salts, or mono-, di-,  and tri-basic salts. In a tri-acid salt a certain voracity of the base  is indicated, and in a tri-basic salt, of the acid. Again, with a base  capable of absorbing and combining with its compound atom or molecule  several compound atoms or molecules of an acid, we have the possibility  of partial saturation, and, perhaps, of several degrees of it, and also  of full saturation, which means combination to the full extent of the  powers of the base in question. Also, with an acid capable of, or  possessing a similar large absorptive faculty for bases, we have  possibilities of the formation of salts of various degrees of basicity,  according to the smaller or larger degree of satisfaction given to the  molecule of such acid by the addition of a base. We will now take as a  simple case that of hydrochloric acid (spirits of salt), which is a  monobasic acid, that is, its molecule is capable of combining with only  one molecule of a monoacid base. Hydrochloric acid may be written, as  its name would indicate, HCl, and an addition even of excess of such a  base as caustic soda (written NaOH) would only yield what is known as  common salt or chloride of sodium (NaCl), in which the metal sodium (Na)  has replaced the hydrogen (H) of the hydrochloric acid. Now chloride of  sodium when dissolved in water will turn litmus neither blue nor red; it  is therefore neutral. Such simple, neutral, monobasic salts are mostly  very stable. By \"stable\" we mean they possess considerable resistance to  agencies, that, in the case of other salts, effect decompositions of  those salts. Such other salts which are decomposed more or less readily  are termed \"unstable,\" but the terms are of course only comparative.    Now let us consider a di- or bi-basic acid. Such an one is vitriol or  sulphuric acid (H_{2}SO_{4}). The hydrogen atoms are in this case an  index of the basicity of the acid, and accordingly the fully saturated  sodium salt is Na_{2}SO_{4} or neutral, or better normal, sulphate of  soda. In like manner the fully saturated salt of the dibasic acid,  carbonic acid (H_{2}CO_{3}), is Na_{2}CO_{3}, ordinary or normal  carbonate of soda. But we must observe that with these dibasic acids it  is possible, by adding insufficient alkali to completely saturate them,  to obtain salts in which only one hydrogen atom of the acid is replaced  by the metal of the base. Thus sulphuric and carbonic acids yield  NaHSO_{4}, acid sulphate or bisulphate of soda, and NaHCO_{3},  bicarbonate of soda, respectively. An example of a tribasic acid is  phosphoric acid, H_{3}PO_{4}, and here we may have three different  classes of salts of three various degrees of basicity or  base-saturation. We may have the first step of basicity due to  combination with soda, NaH_{2}PO_{4}, or monosodium phosphate, the  second step, Na_{3}HPO_{4}, or disodium phosphate, and the third, and  final step, Na_{3}PO_{4}, or trisodium phosphate. Now let us turn to the  varying degrees of acidity, or rather the proportions of acid radicals  in salts, due to the varying appetites or combining powers of bases.  Sodium only forms simple monoacid salts, as sodium chloride (NaCl),  sodium sulphate (Na_{2}SO_{4}); calcium forms diacid salts, _e.g._  calcium chloride (CaCl_{2}); and aluminium and iron, triacid salts, for  example, aluminium sulphate [Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}] and iron (ferric)  sulphate [Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}]. Now in these triacid salts we can remove  some of the acid groups and substitute the elements of water, OH, or  hydroxyl, as it is called, for them. Such salts, then, only partly  saturated with acid, are termed basic salts. Thus we have  Al_{2}(OH)_{2}(SO_{4})_{2}, Al_{2}(OH)_{4}SO_{4}, as well as  Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}, and we can get these basic salts by treating the  normal sulphate [Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}] with sufficient caustic soda to  remove the necessary quantities of sulphuric acid. Now it is a curious  thing that of these aluminium sulphates the fully saturated one,  Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}, is the most stable, for even on long boiling of its  solution in water it suffers no change, but the more basic is the  sulphate the less stable it becomes, and so the more easily it  decomposes on heating or boiling its solution, giving a deposit or  precipitate of a still more basic sulphate, or of hydrated alumina  itself, Al_{2}(OH)_{6}, until we arrive at the salt  Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{2}(OH)_{2}, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17748"],[0,"The Extermination of the American Bison (#13)"],[1,"'  This animal bears about the same relation to a plains buffalo as a  sturdy mountain pony does to an American horse. His body is lighter,  whilst his legs are shorter, but much thicker and stronger, than the  plains animal, thus enabling him to perform feats of climbing and  tumbling almost incredible in such a huge and apparently unwieldy beast.    \"These animals are by no means plentiful, and are moreover excessively  shy, inhabiting the deepest, darkest defiles, or the craggy, almost  precipitous, sides of mountains inaccessible to any but the most  practiced mountaineers.    \"From the tops of the mountains which rim the parks the rains of ages  have cut deep gorges, which plunge with brusque abruptness, but  nevertheless with great regularity, hundreds or even thousands of feet  to the valley below. Down the bottom of each such gorge a clear, cold  stream of purest water, fertilizing a narrow belt of a few feet of  alluvial, and giving birth and growth, to a dense jungle of spruce,  quaking asp, and other mountain trees. One side of the gorge is  generally a thick forest of pine, while the other side is a meadow-like  park, covered with splendid grass. Such gorges are the favorite haunt of  the mountain buffalo. Early in the morning he enjoys a bountiful  breakfast of the rich nutritious grasses, quenches his thirst with the  finest water, and, retiring just within the line of jungle, where,  himself unseen, he can scan the open, he crouches himself in the long  grass and reposes in comfort and security until appetite calls him to  his dinner late in the evening. Unlike their plains relative, there is  no stupid staring at an intruder. At the first symptom of danger they  disappear like magic in the thicket, and never stop until far removed  from even the apprehension of pursuit. I have many times come upon their  fresh tracks, upon the beds from which they had first sprung in alarm,  but I have never even seen one.    \"I have wasted much time and a great deal of wind in vain endeavors to  add one of these animals to my bag. My figure is no longer adapted to  mountain climbing, and the possession of a bison's head of my own  killing is one of my blighted hopes.    \"Several of my friends have been more fortunate, but I know of no  sportsman who has bagged more than one.[35]    [Note 35: Foot-note by William Blackmore: \"The author is in error here,  as in a point of the Tarryall range of mountains, between Pike's Peak  and the South Park, in the autumn of 1871, two mountain buffaloes were  killed in one afternoon. The skin of the finer was presented to Dr.  Frank Buckland.\"]    \"Old mountaineers and trappers have given me wonderful accounts of the  number of these animals in all the mountain region 'many years ago;' and  I have been informed by them, that their present rarity is due to the  great snow-storm of 1844-'45, of which I have already spoken as  destroying the plains buffalo in the Laramie country.    \"One of my friends, a most ardent and pertinacious sportsman, determined  on the possession of a bison's head, and, hiring a guide, plunged into  the mountain wilds which separate the Middle from South Park. After  several days fresh tracks were discovered. Turning their horses loose on  a little gorge park, such as described, they started on foot on the  trail; for all that day they toiled and scrambled with the utmost  caution--now up, now down, through deep and narrow gorges and pine  thickets, over bare and rocky crags, sleeping where night overtook them.  Betimes next morning they pushed on the trail, and about 11 o'clock,  when both were exhausted and well-nigh disheartened, their route was  intercepted by a precipice. Looking over, they descried, on a projecting  ledge several hundred feet below, a herd of about 20 bisons lying down.  The ledge was about 300 feet at widest, by probably 1,000 feet long. Its  inner boundary was the wall of rock on the top of which they stood; its  outer appeared to be a sheer precipice of at least 200 feet. This ledge  was connected with the slope of the mountain by a narrow neck. The wind  being right, the hunters succeeded in reaching this neck unobserved. My  friend selected a magnificent head, that of a fine bull, young but full  grown, and both fired. At the report the bisons all ran to the far end  of the ledge and plunged over.    \"Terribly disappointed, the hunters ran to the spot, and found that they  had gone down a declivity, not actually a precipice, but so steep that  the hunters could not follow them.    \"At the foot lay a bison. A long, a fatiguing detour brought them to the  spot, and in the animal lying dead before him my friend recognized his  bull--his first and last mountain buffalo. Hone but a true sportsman can  appreciate his feelings.    \"The remainder of the herd was never seen after the great plunge, down  which it is doubtful if even a dog could have followed unharmed.\"    In the issue of Forest and Stream of June 14, 1888, Dr. R. W. Shufeldt,  in an article entitled \"The American Buffalo,\" relates a very  interesting experience with buffaloes which were pronounced to be of the  \"mountain\" variety, and his observations on the animals are well worth  reproducing here. The animals (eight in number) were encountered on the  northern slope of the Big Horn Mountains, in the autumn of 1877. \"We  came upon them during a fearful blizzard of heavy hail, during which our  animals could scarcely retain their feet. In fact, the packer's mule  absolutely lay down on the ground rather than risk being blown down the  mountain side, and my own horse, totally unable to face such a violent  blow and the pelting hail (the stones being as large as big marbles),  positively stood stock-still, facing an old buffalo bull that was not  more than 25 feet in front of me. * * * Strange to say, this fearful  gust did not last more than ten minutes, when it stopped as suddenly as  it had commenced, and I deliberately killed my old buffalo at one shot,  just where he stood, and, separating two other bulls from the rest,  charged them down a rugged ravine. They passed over this and into  another one, but with less precipitous sides and no trees in the way,  and when I was on top of the intervening ridge I noticed that the  largest bull had halted in the bottom. Checking my horse, an excellent  buffalo hunter, I fired down at him without dismounting. The ball merely  barked his shoulder, and to my infinite surprise he turned and charged  me up the hill. * * * Stepping to one side of my horse, with the  charging and infuriated bull not 10 feet to my front, I fired upon him,  and the heavy ball took him square in the chest, bringing him to his  knees, with a gush of scarlet blood from his mouth and nostrils. * * *    \"Upon examining the specimen, I found it to be an old bull, apparently  smaller and very much blacker than the ones I had seen killed on the  plains only a day or so before. Then I examined the first one I had  shot, as well as others which were killed by the packer from the same  bunch, and I came to the conclusion that they were typical  representatives of the variety known as the 'mountain buffalo,' a form  much more active in movement, of slighter limbs, blacker, and far more  dangerous to attack. My opinion in the premises remains unaltered  to-day. In all this I may be mistaken, but it was also the opinion held  by the old buffalo hunter who accompanied me, and who at once remarked  when he saw them that they were 'mountain buffalo,' and not the plains  variety. * * *    \"These specimens were not actually measured by me in either case, and  their being considered smaller only rested upon my judging them by my  eye. But they were of a softer pelage, black, lighter in limb, and when  discovered were in the timber, on the side of the Big Horn Mountains.\"    The band of bison in the Yellowstone Park must, of necessity, be of the  so-called \"wood\" or \"mountain\" variety, and if by any chance one of its  members ever dies of old age, it is to be hoped its skin may be  carefully preserved and sent to the National Museum to throw some  further light on this question.    11. _The shedding of the winter pelage._--In personal appearance the  buffalo is subject to striking, and even painful, variations, and the  estimate an observer forms of him is very apt to depend upon the time of  the year at which the observation is made. Toward the end of the winter  the whole coat has become faded and bleached by the action of the sun,  wind, snow, and rain, until the freshness of its late autumn colors has  totally disappeared. The bison takes on a seedy, weathered, and rusty  look. But this is not a circumstance to what happens to him a little  later. Promptly with the coming of the spring, if not even in the last  week of February, the buffalo begins the shedding of his winter coat. It  is a long and difficult task, and with commendable energy he sets about  it at the earliest possible moment. It lasts him more than half the  year, and is attended with many positive discomforts.    The process of shedding is accomplished in two ways: by the new hair  growing into and forcing off the old, and by the old hair falling off in  great patches, leaving the skin bare. On the heavily-haired  portions--the head, neck, fore quarters, and hump--the old hair stops  growing, dies, and the new hair immediately starts through the skin and  forces it off. The new hair grows so rapidly, and at the same time so  densely, that it forces itself into the old, becomes hopelessly  entangled with it, and in time actually lifts the old hair clear of the  skin. On the head the new hair is dark brown or black, but on the neck,  fore quarters, and hump it has at first, and indeed until it is 2 inches  in length, a peculiar gray or drab color, mixed with brown, totally  different from its final and natural color. The new hair starts first on  the head, but the actual shedding of the old hair is to "]]]
