[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18281"],[0,"An Account of the Proceedings on the Trial of Susan B. Anthony, on the Charge of (#13)"],[1,"above put forth, viz: First, that the rights referred to in  the 14th Amendment are those belonging to a person as a citizen of the  United States and not as a citizen of a State, and second, that a right  of the character here involved is not one connected with citizenship of  the United States. Mrs. Bradwell made application to be admitted to  practice as an attorney and counsellor at law, in the Courts of  Illinois. Her application was denied, and upon appeal to the Supreme  Court of the United States, it was there held that to give jurisdiction  under the 14th Amendment, the claim must be of a right pertaining to  citizenship of the United States, and that the claim made by her did  not come within that class of cases. Mr. Justice Bradley and Mr.  Justice Field held that a woman was not entitled to a license to  practice law. It does not appear that the other Judges passed upon that  question.    The 14th Amendment gives no right to a woman to vote, and the voting by  Miss Anthony was in violation of the law.    If she believed she had a right to vote, and voted in reliance upon that  belief, does that relieve her from the penalty? It is argued that the  knowledge referred to in the act relates to her knowledge of the  illegality of the act, and not to the act of voting; for it is said that  she must know that she voted. Two principles apply here: First,  ignorance of the law excuses no one; second, every person is presumed to  understand and to intend the necessary effects of his own acts. Miss  Anthony knew that she was a woman, and that the constitution of this  State prohibits her from voting. She intended to violate that  provision--intended to test it, perhaps, but certainly intended to  violate it. The necessary effect of her act was to violate it, and this  she is presumed to have intended. There was no ignorance of any fact,  but all the facts being known, she undertook to settle a principle in  her own person. She takes the risk, and she cannot escape the  consequences. It is said, and authorities are cited to sustain the  position, that there can be no crime unless there is a culpable intent;  to render one criminally responsible a vicious will must be present. A  commits a trespass on the land of B, and B, thinking and believing that  he has a right to shoot an intruder on his premises, kills A on the  spot. Does B's misapprehension of his rights justify his act? Would a  Judge be justified in charging the jury that if satisfied that B  supposed he had a right to shoot A he was justified, and they should  find a verdict of not guilty? No Judge would make such a charge. To  constitute a crime, it is true, that there must be a criminal intent,  but it is equally true that knowledge of the facts of the case is always  held to supply this intent. An intentional killing bears with it  evidence of malice in law. Whoever, without justifiable cause,  intentionally kills his neighbor, is guilty of a crime. The principle is  the same in the case before us, and in all criminal cases. The precise  question now before me has been several times decided, viz.: that one  illegally voting was bound and was assumed to know the law, and that a  belief that he had a right to vote gave no defense, if there was no  mistake of fact. (Hamilton against The People, 57th of Barbour, p. 625;  State against Boyet, 10th of Iredell, p. 336; State against Hart, 6th  Jones, 389; McGuire against State, 7 Humphrey, 54; 15th of Iowa reports,  404.) No system of criminal jurisprudence can be sustained upon any  other principle. Assuming that Miss Anthony believed she had a right to  vote, that fact constitutes no defense if in truth she had not the  right. She voluntarily gave a vote which was illegal, and thus is  subject to the penalty of the law.    Upon this evidence I suppose there is no question for the jury and that  the jury should be directed to find a verdict of guilty.    JUDGE SELDEN: I submit that on the view which your Honor has taken, that  the right to vote and the regulation of it is solely a State matter.  That this whole law is out of the jurisdiction of the United States  Courts and of Congress. The whole law upon that basis, as I understand  it, is not within the constitutional power of the general Government,  but is one which applies to the States. I suppose that it is for the  jury to determine whether the defendant is guilty of a crime or not. And  I therefore ask your Honor to submit to the jury these propositions:    First--If the defendant, at the time of voting, believed that she had a  right to vote and voted in good faith in that belief, she is not guilty  of the offense charged.    Second--In determining the question whether she did or did not believe  that she had a right to vote, the jury may take into consideration, as  bearing upon that question, the advice which she received from the  counsel to whom she applied.    Third--That they may also take into consideration, as bearing upon the  same question, the fact that the inspectors considered the question and  came to the conclusion that she had a right to vote.    Fourth--That the jury have a right to find a general verdict of guilty  or not guilty as they shall believe that she has or has not committed  the offense described in the Statute.    A professional friend sitting by has made this suggestion which I take  leave to avail myself of as bearing upon this question: \"The Court has  listened for many hours to an argument in order to decide whether the  defendant has a right to vote. The arguments show the same question has  engaged the best minds of the country as an open question. Can it be  possible that the defendant is to be convicted for acting upon such  advice as she could obtain while the question is an open and undecided  one?\"    THE COURT: You have made a much better argument than that, sir.    JUDGE SELDEN: As long as it is an open question I submit that she has  not been guilty of an offense. At all events it is for the jury.    THE COURT: I cannot charge these propositions of course. The question,  gentlemen of the jury, in the form it finally takes, is wholly a  question or questions of law, and I have decided as a question of law,  in the first place, that under the 14th Amendment, which Miss Anthony  claims protects her, she was not protected in a right to vote. And I  have decided also that her belief and the advice which she took does  not protect her in the act which she committed. If I am right in this,  the result must be a verdict on your part of guilty, and I therefore  direct that you find a verdict of guilty.    JUDGE SELDEN: That is a direction no Court has power to make in a  criminal case.    THE COURT: Take the verdict, Mr. Clerk.    THE CLERK: Gentlemen of the jury, hearken to your verdict as the Court  has recorded it. You say you find the defendant guilty of the offense  whereof she stands indicted, and so say you all?    JUDGE SELDEN: I don't know whether an exception is available, but I  certainly must except to the refusal of the Court to submit those  propositions, and especially to the direction of the Court that the jury  should find a verdict of guilty. I claim that it is a power that is not  given to any Court in a criminal case.    Will the Clerk poll the jury?    THE COURT: No. Gentlemen of the jury, you are discharged.    On the next day a motion for a new trial was made by Judge Selden, as  follows:    _May it please the Court_:    The trial of this case commenced with a question of very great  magnitude--whether by the constitution of the United States the right of  suffrage was secured to female equally with male citizens. It is likely  to close with a question of much greater magnitude--whether the right of  trial by jury is absolutely secured by the federal constitution to  persons charged with crime before the federal courts.    I assume, without attempting to produce any authority on the subject,  that this Court has power to grant to the defendant a new trial in case  it should appear that in the haste and in the lack of opportunity for  examination which necessarily attend a jury trial, any material error  should have been committed prejudicial to the defendant, as otherwise no  means whatever are provided by the law for the correction of such  errors.    The defendant was indicted, under the nineteenth section of the act of  Congress of May 31st, 1870, entitled, \"An act to enforce the right of  citizens of the United States to vote in the several states of this  Union, and for other purposes,\" and was charged with having knowingly  voted, without having a lawful right to vote, at the congressional  election in the eighth ward of the City of Rochester, in November last;  the only ground of illegality being that the defendant was a woman.    The provisions of the act of Congress, so far as they bear upon the  present case, are as follows:    \"Section 19. If at any election for representative or delegate in the  Congress of the United States, any person shall knowingly personate and  vote, or attempt to vote, in the name of any other person, whether  living, dead or fictitious, or vote more than once at the same election  for any candidate for the same office, or vote at a place where he may  not be lawfully entitled to vote, or vote without having a lawful right  to vote, ... every such person shall be deemed guilty of a crime, and  shall for such crime be liable to prosecution in any court of the United  States, of competent jurisdiction, and, on conviction thereof, shall be  punished by a fine not exceeding $500 or by imprisonment for a term not  exceeding three years, or both, in the discretion of the Court, and  shall pay the costs of prosecution.\"    It appeared on the trial that before voting the defendant called upon a  respectable lawyer, and asked his opinion whether she had a right to  vote, and he advised her that she had such right, and the lawyer was  examined as a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18284"],[0,"For Every Music Lover (#13)"],[1," his original studies still remain valuable to the pianist.    When Liszt and Thalberg were in possession of the concert platform, they  occupied the attention of cartoonists as fully as Paderewski at a later  date. Liszt, his hair floating wildly, was represented as darting  through the air on wide-stretched pinions with keyboards attached--a  play on Fluegel, the German for grand piano. Thalberg, owing to his  dignified repose, was caricatured as posing in a stiff, rigid manner  before a box of keys.    Rubinstein and Von Buelow offer two more contrasting personalities. Anton  Rubinstein (1830-1894) was the impressionist, the subjective artist, who  re-created every composition he played. The Russian tone-colorist he has  been called, and the warmth and glow with which he invested every nuance  can never be forgotten by those who were privileged to hear his Titanic  interpretations, over whose very blemishes was cast the glamor of the  impassioned temperament that caused them. \"May Heaven forgive me for  every wrong note I have struck!\" he exclaimed to a youthful admirer  after one of his concerts in this country during the season of 1872-3.  Certainly the listener under the spell of his magnetism could forgive,  almost forget. Hans von Buelow (1830-1894) was the objective artist,  whose scholarly attainments and musicianly discernment unraveled the  most tangled web of phrasing and interpretation. His Beethoven recitals,  when he was in America in 1875-6, were of especial value to piano  students. As a piano virtuoso, a teacher, a conductor and an editor of  musical works, he was a marked educational factor in music.    In his youth Johannes Brahms (1833-1897), the great apostle of modern  intellectual music, made his debut before the musical world as a  brilliant and versatile pianist. Once, when about to play in public  Beethoven's magnificent Kreutzer Sonata, with Remenyi, who was the first  to recognize his genius, he discovered that the piano was half a tone  below concert pitch, and rather than spoil the effect by having the  violin tuned down, the boy of nineteen unhesitatingly transposed the  piano part which he was playing from memory into a higher key. The fire,  energy and breadth of his rendering, together with the splendid  musicianship displayed by this feat, deeply impressed the great  violinist Joachim, who was present, and who became enthusiastic in his  praise. Schumann, on making his acquaintance, proclaimed the advent of a  genius who wrote music in which the spirit of the age found its  consummation, and who, at the piano, unveiled wonders. By others he has  been called the greatest contrapuntist after Bach, the greatest  architectonist after Beethoven, the man of creative power who  assimilated the older forms and invested them with a new life entirely  his own. His piano works are a rich addition to the pianist's store, but  whoever would unveil their beautiful proportions, all aglow as they are  with sacred fire, must have taken a master's degree.    Two pupils of Liszt stand out prominently--Carl Tausig (1841-1871) and  Eugene D'Albert (1864- ----). The first was distinguished by his  extraordinary sense for style, and was thought to surpass his master in  absolute flawlessness of technique. To the second Oscar Bie attributes  the crown of piano playing in our time. Peter Iljitch Tschaikowsky  (1840-1893), the distinguished representative of the modern Russian  school, was an original, dramatic and fertile composer and wrote for the  piano some of his highly colored and very characteristic music. Edward  Grieg (1843- ----), the national tone-poet of Norway, has given the  piano some of his most delightful efforts, fresh with the breezes of the  North.    The veteran French composer, Charles Camille Saint-Saens (1835- ----),  has won great renown as a pianist, and was one of the most precocious  children on record, having begun the study of the piano when under three  years of age. He was the teacher that knew how to develop the  individuality of the young Russian, Leopold Godowsky, who has done such  remarkable work on two continents, as a teacher and piano virtuoso.    Perhaps the most famous piano teacher of recent times is Theodore  Leschetitzky, of Vienna. His method is that of common sense, based on  keen analytical faculties, and he never trains the hand apart from the  musical sense. His most renowned pupil is Ignace Jan Paderewski, the  magnetic Pole, whose exquisite touch and tone long made him the idol of  the concert room, and who, with time, has gained in robustness, but also  in recklessness of style. Another gifted pupil of the Viennese master is  Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler, of Chicago, an artiste of rare temperament,  musical feeling and nervous power, of whom Dr. Hanslick said that her  virtuosity was stupendous, her delicacy in the finest florid work as  marvelous as her fascinating energy in the forte passages.    The great tidal wave set in motion by the piano has swept over the  civilized world, carrying with it hosts of accomplished pianists. Of  some of those who are familiar figures in our musical centres it has  been said that Teresa Carreno learned from Rubinstein the art of piano  necromancy; that Rosenthal is an amazing technician whose  interpretations lack tenderness; that De Pachmann is on terms of  intimacy with Chopin, and that Rafael Joseffy, the disciple of Tausig,  combines all that is best in the others with striking methods of his  own.    Great is the piano, splendid its literature, many its earnest students,  numerous its worthy exponents. That it is so often made a means of empty  show is not the fault of the piano, it is due to a tendency of the day  that calls for superficial glamor. Herbert Spencer was not so wrong as  some of the critics seem to think when, in his last volume, he said that  teachers of music and music performers were often corrupters of music.  Those certainly are corrupters of music who use the piano solely for  meaningless technical feats.          VII    The Poetry and Leadership of Chopin      \"The piano bard, the piano rhapsodist, the piano mind, the piano soul is  Chopin,\" said Rubinstein. \"Tragic, romantic, lyric, heroic, dramatic,  fantastic, soulful, sweet, dreamy, brilliant, grand, simple, all  possible expressions are found in his compositions and all are sung by  him on his instrument.\"    In these few, bold strokes one who knew him by virtue of close art and  race kinship, presents an incomparable outline sketch of the Polish  tone-poet who explored the harmonic vastness of the pianoforte and made  his own all its mystic secrets.    Born and bred on Poland's soil, son of a French father and a Polish  mother, Frederic Chopin (1809-1849) combined within himself two natures,  each complementing the other, both uniting to form a personality not  understood by every casual observer. He is described as kind, courteous,  possessed of the most captivating grace and ease of manner, now inclined  to languorous melancholy, now scintillating with a joyous vivacity that  was contagious. His sensitive nature, like the most exquisitely  constructed sounding-board, vibrated with the despairing sadness, the  suppressed wrath, and the sublime fortitude of the brave, haughty,  unhappy people he loved, and with his own homesickness when afar from  his cherished native land.    Patriot and tone-poet in every fibre of his being, his genius inevitably  claimed as its own the soul's divinest language, pure music, unfettered  by words. The profound reserve of his nature made it peculiarly  agreeable to him to gratify the haunting demands of his lyric muse  through the medium of the one musical instrument that lends itself in  privacy to the exploitation of all the mysteries of harmony. Strong  conviction in regard to his own calling and clear perception of the  hidden powers and future mission of the piano early compelled him to  consecrate to it his unfaltering devotion. He evolved from its more  intimate domain effects in sympathy with those of the orchestra, yet  purely individual. He enriched it with new melodic, harmonic and  rhythmic devices adapted to itself alone, and endowed it with a warmth  of tone-coloring that spiritualized it for all time.    To the piano he confided all the conflicts that raged within him, all  the courage and living hope that sustained him. In giving tonal form to  the deep things of the soul, which are universal in their essence and  application, he embodied universal rather than merely individual  emotional experiences, and thus unbared what was most sacred to himself  without jarring on the innate reticence which made purely personal  confidences impossible. Although his mode of expression was peculiarly  his own, he had received a strong impulse from the popular music of  Poland. As a child he had become familiar with the folk-songs and dances  heard in the harvest-fields and at market and village festivals. They  were his earliest models; on them were builded his first themes. As Bach  glorified the melodies of the German people, so Chopin glorified those  of the Poles. The national tonality became to him a vehicle to be  freighted with his own individual conceptions.    \"I should like to be to my people what Uhland was to the Germans,\" he  once said to a friend. He addressed himself to the heart of this people  and immortalized its joys, sorrows and caprices by the force of his  splendid art. Those who have attempted to interpret him as the  sentimental hero of minor moods, the tone-poet in whom the weakness of  despair predominates, have missed the leaping flames, the vivid  intensity and the heroic manliness permeated with genuine love of beauty  that animated him. True art softens the harshest accents of suffering by  placing superior to it some elevating idea. So in the most melancholy  strains of his music one who heeds well may detect the presence of a  lofty ideal that uplifts and"]]]
