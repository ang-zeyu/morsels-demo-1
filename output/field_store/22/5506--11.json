Follow the footsteps of your late respected uncle;  he did not neglect his worldly affairs, though he cared for the  interests of his soul;  you must go, but I will meet you again when you  get your fortnightly holiday.\"  On this he embraced me, and I again  became unconscious. When I returned to myself, I found myself at the  bottom of Col. Jones' Coffee Plantation above Coonor on a path.  Here  the Sannyasi wished me farewell, and pointing to the high road below, he  said, \"Now you will know your way home;\"  but I would not part from him.  I said, \"All this will appear a dream to me unless you will fix a day  and promise to meet me here again.\"  \"I promise,\" he said.  \"No, promise  me by an oath on the head of my idol.\"  Again he promised, and touched  the head of my idol.  \"Be here,\" he said, \"this day fortnight.\"  When  the day came I anxiously kept my engagement and went and sat on the  stone on the path.  I waited a long time in vain.  At last I said to  myself, \"I am deceived, he is not coming, he has broken his oath\"--and  with grief I made a poojah.  Hardly had these thoughts passed my mind,  than lo! he stood beside me.  \"Ah, you doubt me,\" he said;  \"why this  grief.\"  I fell at his feet and confessed I had doubted him and begged  his forgiveness.  He forgave and comforted me, and told me to keep in my  good ways and he would always help me;  and he told me and advised me  about all my private affairs without my telling him one word, and he  also gave me some medicines for a sick friend which I had promised to  ask for but had forgotten.  This medicine was given to my friend and he  is perfectly well now.    A verbatim translation of a Settlement Officer's statement to    --E.H. Morgan          Witchcraft on the Nilgiris      Having lived many years (30) on the Nilgiris, employing the various  tribes of the Hills on my estates, and speaking their languages, I have  had many opportunities of observing their manners and customs and the  frequent practice of Demonology and Witchcraft among them.  On the  slopes of the Nilgiris live several semi-wild people:  1st, the  \"Curumbers,\" who frequently hire themselves out to neighbouring estates,  and are first-rate fellers of forest;  2nd, the \"Tain\" (\"Honey  Curumbers\"), who collect and live largely on honey and roots, and who do  not come into civilized parts;  3rd, the \"Mulu\" Curumbers, who are rare  on the slopes of the hills, but common in Wynaad lower down the plateau.  These use bows and arrows, are fond of hunting, and have frequently been  known to kill tigers, rushing in a body on their game and discharging  their arrows at a short distance.  In their eagerness they frequently  fall victims to this animal;  but they are supposed to possess a  controlling power over all wild animals, especially elephants and  tigers;  and the natives declare they have the power of assuming the  forms of various beasts.  Their aid is constantly invoked both by the  Curumbers first named, and by the natives generally, when wishing to be  revenged on an enemy.    Besides these varieties of Curumbers there are various other wild tribes  I do not now mention, as they are not concerned in what I have to  relate.    I had on my estate near Ootacamund a gang of young Badagas, some 30  young men, whom I had had in my service since they were children, and  who had become most useful handy fellows.  From week to week I missed  one or another of them, and on inquiry was told they had been sick and  were dead!    One market-day I met the Moneghar of the village to which my gang  belonged and some of his men, returning home laden with their purchases.  The moment he saw me he stopped, and coming up to me, said, \"Mother, I  am in great sorrow and trouble, tell me what I can do!\"  \"Why, what is  wrong?\" I asked.  \"All my young men are dying, and I cannot help them,  nor prevent it;  they are under a spell of the wicked Curumbers who are  killing them, and I am powerless.\"  \"Pray explain,\" I said;  \"why do the  Curumbers behave in this way, and what do they do to your people?\"  \"Oh,  Madam, they are vile extortioners, always asking for money;  we have  given and given till we have no more to give.  I told them we had no  more money and then they said,--All right--as you please;  we shall see.  Surely as they say this, we know what will follow--at night when we are  all asleep, we wake up suddenly and see a Curumber standing in our  midst, in the middle of the room occupied by the young men.\"  \"Why do  you not close and bolt your doors securely?\" I interrupted.  \"What is  the use of bolts and bars to them? they come through stone walls.... Our  doors were secure, but nothing can keep out a Curumber.  He points his  finger at Mada, at Kurira, at Jogie--he utters no word, and as we look  at him he vanishes!  In a few days these three young men sicken, a low  fever consumes them, their stomachs swell, they die.  Eighteen young  men, the flower of my village, have died thus this year.  These effects  always follow the visit of a Curumber at night.\"  \"Why not complain to  the Government?\" I said.  \"Ah, no use, who will catch them?\"  \"Then give  them the 200 rupees they ask this once on a solemn promise that they  exact no more\"  \"I suppose we must find the money somewhere,\" he said,  turning sorrowfully away.    A Mr. K---is the owner of a coffee estate near this, and like many  other planters employs Burghers.  On one occasion he went down the  slopes of the hills after bison and other large game, taking some seven  or eight Burghers with him as gun carriers (besides other things  necessary in jungle-walking--axes to clear the way, knives and ropes,  &c.).  He found and severely wounded a fine elephant with tusks.  Wishing to secure these, he proposed following up his quarry, but could  not induce his Burghers to go deeper and further into the forests;  they  feared to meet the \"Mula Curumbers\" who lived thereabouts.  For long he  argued in vain, at last by dint of threats and promises he induced them  to proceed, and as they met no one, their fears were allayed and they  grew bolder, when suddenly coming on the elephant lying dead (oh, horror  to them!), the beast was surrounded by a party of Mulu Curumbers busily  engaged in cutting out the tusks, one of which they had already  disengaged!  The affrighted Burghers fell back, and nothing Mr. K---  could do or say would induce them to approach the elephant, which the  Curumbers stoutly declared was theirs.  They had killed him they said.  They had very likely met him staggering under his wound and had finished  him off.  Mr. K---was not likely to give up his game in this fashion.  So walking threateningly to the Curumbers he compelled them to retire,  and called to his Burghers at the same time.  The Curumbers only said,  \"Just you DARE to touch that elephant,\" and retired.  Mr. K---thereupon  cut out the remaining tusk himself, and slinging both on a pole with no  little trouble, made his men carry them. He took all the blame on  himself, showed them that they did not touch them, and finally declared  he would stay there all night rather than lose the tusks.  The idea of a  night near the Mulu Curumbers was too much for the fears of the  Burghers, and they finally took up the pole and tusks and walked home.  From that day those men, all but one who probably carried the gun,  sickened, walked about like spectres, doomed, pale and ghastly, and  before the month was out all were dead men, with the one exception!    A few months ago, at the village of Ebanaud, a few miles from this, a  fearful tragedy was enacted.  The Moneghar or headman's child was sick  unto death.  This, following on several recent deaths, was attributed to  the evil influences of a village of Curumbers hard by.  The Burghers  determined on the destruction of every soul of them.  They procured the  assistance of a Toda, as they invariably do on such occasions, as  without one the Curumbers are supposed to be invulnerable.  They  proceeded to the Curumber village at night and set their huts on fire,  and as the miserable inmates attempted to escape, flung them back into  the flames or knocked them down with clubs.  In the confusion one old  woman escaped unobserved into the adjacent bushes.  Next morning she  gave notice to the authorities, and identified seven Burghers, among  whom was the Moneghar or headman, and one Toda. As the murderers of her  people they were all brought to trial in the Courts here,--except the  headman, who died before he could be brought in--and were all sentenced  and duly executed, that is, three Burghers and the Toda, who were proved  principals in the murders.    Two years ago an almost identical occurrence took place at Kotaghery,  with exactly similar results, but without the punishment entailed having  any deterrent effect.  They pleaded \"justification,\" as witchcraft had  been practiced on them.  But our Government ignores all occult dealings  and will not believe in the dread power in the land.  They deal very  differently with these matters in Russia, where, in a recent trial of a  similar nature, the witchcraft was admitted as an extenuating  circumstance and the culprits who had burnt a witch were all acquitted.  All natives of whatever caste are well aware of these terrible powers  and too often do they avail themselves of them--much oftener than any  one has an idea of.  One day as I was riding along I came upon a strange  and ghastly object--a basket containing the bloody head of a black  sheep, a cocoanut, 10 rupees in money, some rice and flowers.  These  smaller items I did not see, not caring to examine any closer;  but I  was told by some natives that those articles were to be found in the  basket. The basket was placed at the apex of a triangle formed by three  fine threads tied to three small sticks, so placed that any one  approaching from the roads on either"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14392"],[0,"George Du Maurier, the Satirist of the Victorians (#13)"],[1,"which is theatrical, as the word implies, must be  spectacular. Theatricality before everything else in this world, in any  art, achieves wide and popular success, the kind of success that Turner  achieves in the pictures for which the English public admire him.    Mr. W.D. Howells, in an article written just after the novelist's death,  said:[3]--\"It was my good fortune to have the courage to write to du  Maurier when _Trilby_ was only half printed, and to tell him how much I  liked the gay sad story. In every way it was well that I did not wait  for the end, for the last third of it seemed to me so altogether forced  in its conclusions that I could not have offered my praises with a whole  heart, nor he accept them with any pleasure, if the disgust with its  preposterous popularity, which he so frankly, so humorously expressed,  had then begun in him.\"    The American critic describes the fact of du Maurier commencing novelist  at sixty and succeeding, as one of the most extraordinary things in the  history of literature, and without parallel. Perhaps the parallel has  been shown in the case of Mr. de Morgan. Mr. Howells also speaks of du  Maurier perfecting an attitude recognisable in Fielding, Sterne, Heine,  and Thackeray--the confidential one. Du Maurier's _Trilby_ was a  confidence. But he adds, \"It wants the last respect for the reader's  intelligence--it wants whatever is the very greatest thing in the very  greatest novelists--the thing that convinces in Hawthorne, George Eliot,  Tourgenief, Tolstoy. But short of this supreme truth, it has every  grace, every beauty, every charm.\" The word \"Every\" here seems to us an  American exaggeration. We should ask ourselves whether in spite of all  its confidentialness _Trilby_ makes an intimate revelation. The rare  quality of intimacy, that is the greatest thing in the very greatest  novels.    The \"boom\" of _Trilby_, we are told, surprised du Maurier immensely, for  he had not taken himself _au serieux_ as a novelist. Indeed it rather  distressed him when he reflected that Thackeray never had a \"boom.\"    [Illustration: Unpublished drawing from sketch-book]      Section 5    Although du Maurier had said that his head was full of plots the supply  seemed to have run thin by the time he set to work on _The Martian_. The  value of this book rests with its autobiographical character. The knot  is not tied in the first half and unravelled in the second, after the  approved manner in which plots should be woven. The story is chiefly a  record of people and places, vivid, and written in a breathless, chatty  style. It somewhat resembles the conversation of a boy on returning from  his holidays. It reveals a perfectly amazing resource in imparting life  to mere description. As a writer, du Maurier seemed immediately to  acquire a style unlike that of anyone else. Everything is described with  a zest that carries the reader along, and this manner is even extended  to things that are not worth describing. But he was always slightly  apologetic with pen in hand, never permitting himself the professional  air, or giving a full challenge to criticism by disclaiming the  privileges of a distinguished amateur.    In _Peter Ibbetson_ the artist told the story of his childhood; in  _Trilby_ he recounted the brightest period of his Bohemian youth; in  _The Martian_ he records the nature of the shock he received from  threatened blindness, and the depression of days before his genius had  discovered itself and revealed the prospect of a great career to him.  The effect of Pentonville, the grey suburb, and of the absence of worthy  companions upon a romantic, highly-strung young man in _Peter Ibbetson_  is quite autobiographical, as is the description of student life in  Paris by which afterwards the uninspiring environment is replaced. The  continuation of the studentship at Antwerp, the consultation with the  specialist at Dusseldorf, completes the story of du Maurier's life until  he came to London. There is literally nothing that a biographer could  add to it. And du Maurier wrote his autobiography thus, in tales, which  are histories too, in their graphic description of the aspect of places  and people at a given time. Up to the day when the artist came to London  to seek employment from the publishers he seems to have had  disheartening times. In the last years of his life, when he went over  the ground of these early experiences in his books, it was, as is  evident from the style, in the mood of one who had survived danger by  flood and field to recount his tales in an atmosphere of peace he had  hardly hoped to realise.    [Illustration: Illustration for \"The Adventures of Harry Richmond\"    _The Cornhill_, 1870.]    It is evident from his books that he had many inward experiences of a  dramatic kind; that his life was only uneventful upon the surface, and  in appearance. In each of his novels, as we have seen, the rather crude  machinery of his plot secures the revelation of a curious, but a not at  all uncommon state of mind. He experimented empirically in psychology,  interesting himself in the processes of his own mind. No one can doubt  that in more than in outward incident his novels were autobiographical;  that also he drew upon the resources of his personal history for some of  the less usual and partly religious frames of mind in which his  \"Heroes,\" each in his own way, outwit the apparently ugly intentions of  destiny towards themselves.      Section 6    Du Maurier's literary contributions to _Punch_ were bound up in the  volume _A Legend of Camelot, &c._, issued from the _Punch_ office in  1898. Besides the title-piece, a satire of some length upon the  mediaevalism of the pre-Raphaelites, the book contains shorter  pieces--\"Flirts in Hades,\" \"Poor Pussy's Nightmare,\" \"The Fool's  Paradise, or Love and Life,\" \"A Lost Illusion,\" \"Vers Nonsensiques,\"  \"L'Onglay a Parry,\" \"Two Thrones,\" \"A Love-Agony,\" \"A Simple Story,\" \"A  Ballad of Blunders\" (after Swinburne's \"Ballad of Burdens\"), and then a  story in prose, \"The Rise and Fall of the Jack Spratts: A tale of Modern  Art and Fashion.\" All the poetry is in the ballad strain, and by its  monotony the reader is put into the right condition to receive a shock  from some felicitous twist at the end of a line. Thus it is almost  impossible to quote from them. The humour rests in each case with the  whole of the skit; and in the case of one of the best of the whole  series, \"A Love-Agony,\" a poem for a picture by Maudle, given, there  must be understanding on the reader's part, of the art \"cult\" against  which it is directed.    \"The Rise and Fall of the Jack Spratts\" is du Maurier's first attempt at  a work of fiction. It is significant that in style it has the lightness  of touch that would be expected from the disciple of Thackeray, and that  afterwards won by its \"taking\" character the hearts of the readers of  _Trilby_. It is the story of a painter, his wife and their twin  children. It opens with a picture of them at home, Jack Spratt  dreaming, even in those days, of Post-Impressionism, showing that du  Maurier was a prophet, \"dreaming of the ante-pre-Raphaelite school. In  the depths of his bliss a feeling of discouragement would steal over him  as he thought of those immortal works, showing thereby that he was a  true artist, ever striving after the light. He little dreamt in his  modesty that, young and inexperienced though he might be, his pictures  were even quainter than theirs; for not only could he already draw,  colour, compose, and put into perspective quite as badly as they did,  but he had over them the advantage of a real lay figure to copy, whereas  they had to content themselves with the living model.\"    \"The amusements of this happy pair were the simplest, healthiest, and  most delightful kind; they never went to the play, nor to balls or  dances, which they thought immodest--(indeed they were not even  asked)--nor read such things as novels, magazines, or the newspaper; nor  visited exhibitions of modern art, which they held in contempt, as they  did all things modern; ... and they were devoted to music, not that of  the present day, which they despised, nor that of the future, of which  they had never heard; nor English music, which was not old enough.\" Of  their friends, \"They were few, but true and trusty, with remarkably fine  heads for a painter ... their deportment grave, sad and very strange;  for the death of the early Italian masters still weighed on their soul  with all the force of some recent domestic bereavement. They looked on  themselves and each other and the Jack Spratts, and were looked upon by  the Jack Spratts in return as the sole incarnation on this degenerate  earth of all such as had still managed to survive there; and so they  were always telling each other and everyone else they met. And no  wonder, for they were marvellously accomplished; being each of them  painter, sculptor, architect, poet, critic and engraver, all in one; and  all this without ever having learnt....\"    \"In their hours of sickness alone the Spratts were as other people, and  sent immediately for the nearest medical practitioner (or leech, as they  preferred to call him); their only sickness to speak of had arisen from  once feasting mediaevally on an old roast peacock, in company with the  trusty friends, who had also been taken very bad on that occasion; and  they ever afterwards avoided that dish, but at their banquets would  have the peacock's head and what was left of its tail tacked on to some  more digestible bird....\"    \"As staunch Radicals, they hated the aristocracy, whose very existence  they ignored; shunned the professional class, which they scorned, on  account of its scientific and utilitarian tendency; and loathed the  middle class, from which they had sprung, because it was Philistine; and  although they professed to deeply honour the working man, they very  wisely"]]]
