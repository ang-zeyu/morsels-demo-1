He  frequently[102] declares that he is speaking to a specially initiated  sect, and warns his hearers not to divulge his teaching. The  notion of an esoteric doctrine for the aristocracy of intellect had  become a fixed idea in the Greek schools for three centuries, ever  since the days of Aristotle; and whether through Greek influence or  otherwise it had been generally adopted by the Jewish teachers. The  rabbis of the Talmud derived from the first chapters of Genesis the  inner mystery of the law, which was cognizable only by the sage; and  the same idea is found in later Jewish tradition, which, expounding  Paradise ([Hebrew: prds]) as four stages of interpretation, each  marked by a letter of the word, Peshat, Remez, Derash, and Sod  ([Hebrew: sod]),[103] regarded the last as the final reward of the  devoted seeker after God, as it is said in the Psalms, \"The secret of  the Lord is for those who fear Him.\" Jewish religious philosophers  have in all ages designed their work for a select few. The Halakah, or  way of life, is the fit study of the many. So Maimonides wrote his  Moreh only for those who already were masters of the law. And Philo  likewise at Alexandria taught an esoteric doctrine to an esoteric  circle, which alone was fitted to receive the profoundest  theology.[104] The allegories of the law do not take the place of the  law itself, nor of its ethical ordinances. They are additional to the  other exegesis and distinct, destined only for the man of learning.  And as we shall see, he asserts emphatically in the midst of his  allegories[105] that the perception of the philosophical value does  not release man from the practice itself. The wise man even as the  fool must obey the law.    Why, it may be asked, does Philo artificially attach his philosophy to  the Scriptures? He does so for two reasons: first, because he holds  and wishes to prove that between faith and philosophy there is no  conflict, and his generation worked out the agreement by this method;  he does so also because he wishes to establish the Torah and Judaism  upon a sure foundation for the man of outside culture. The pursuit of  philosophy must have menaced the attachment to Judaism and challenged  the authority of the Bible at Alexandria. A superficial knowledge of  the materialistic or rationalistic theories, which were propagated  respectively by the Epicurean and Stoic schools, was made the excuse  for indifference to the law. Then as now the advanced Jew would mask  his self-indulgence under the guise of a banal philosophy, and jeer  easily at archaic myths and tribal laws. The dominating motive of  Philo's work is to show that the Bible contains for those who will  seek it the richest treasures of wisdom, that its ethical teaching is  more ideal and yet more real than that which hundreds of sophists  poured forth daily in the lecture-theatres[106] to the gaping  dilettanti of learning, and lastly that the cultured Jew may search  out knowledge and truth to their depths, and find them expressed in  his holy books and in his religious beliefs and practices. Philo  frequently introduces into his philosophical interpretation a polemic  against the disintegrating and demoralizing forces which were at work  in the Alexandria of his day. His commentary therefore is a strange  medley, compounded of idealistic speculation, theology, homiletics,  moral denunciation, and polemical rhetoric. The idea, which is not  uncommon, that Philo represents the extreme Hellenic development of  Judaism, and that he gathered into his writings the opinions of all  Greek schools to the ruin of his Jewish individuality, is utterly  erroneous. In fact, he chooses out only the valuable parts of Greek  thought, which could enter into a true harmony with the Hebraic  spirit; and he not only rejects, but he attacks unsparingly those  elements which were antagonistic to holiness and righteousness. With  the enthusiasm of a Maccabee, if with other weapons, he fought against  the bastard culture, which meant self-indulgence and the excessive  attention to the body, the idol-worship, the degraded ideas of the  Divine power, and the disregard of truth and justice, that were  current in the pagan society about him. The seeking after sensual  pleasure and luxury was the most glaring evil of his city--as the  Talmud says,[107] of ten parts of lust nine were given to  Alexandria--and with every variety of denunciation he returns again  and again to the charge. Epicureanism is detestable not only for its  low idea of human life, but for its godless conception of the  universe. Its theory that the world was a fortuitous concourse of  atoms, which was governed by blind chance, and that the gods lived  apart in complete indifference to men--this was to Philo utter  atheism, and as such the greatest of sins. He attacked paganism not  only in its crude form of idolatry,[108] but in its more seductive  disguise of a pretentious philosophy. Always and entirely he was the  champion of monotheism.    Nearly as godless, and therefore as vile in his eyes as the follower  of Epicurus, is the follower of the Stoic doctrines. It has been shown  that the Jews and the Stoics were continually in conflict at  Alexandria; and the \"Allegories of the Laws\" are filled with attacks,  overt and hidden, upon the Stoic doctrines. The Stoics, indeed,  believed in one supreme Divine Power, not however in a transcendental  and personal God, but a cosmic, impersonal, fatalistic world-force.[109]  To Philo this conception, with its denial of the Divine will and the  Divine care for the individual, was as atheistic as the Epicurean  \"chance.\" Equally repulsive to his religious standpoint was the Stoic  dogma, that man is, or should be, independent of all help, and that  the human reason is all-powerful and can comprehend the universe by  its own unaided power.[110] Repulsive also were their pride, their  rejection of the emotions, their hard rationalism. The battle of Philo  against the Stoics is the battle of personal monotheism against  impersonal pantheism, of religious faith and revelation against  arrogant rationalism, and of idealism against materialism. Hostile as  he is to the Stoic intellectual dogmatism, Philo is none the less  opposed to its converse, intellectual skepticism and agnosticism. Man,  he is convinced, has a Divine revelation[111] which he may not deny  without ruin. He holds with Pope that we have      \"Too much of knowledge for the Skeptic side,    Too much of weakness for the Stoic's pride,\"    and he attacks the Skeptics of the day who devoted their minds to  destructive dialectical quibbling and sophistry[112] instead of  seeking for God and the human good. They are the Ishmaels of  philosophy.    Philo's polemic is directed less against the Greek schools in  themselves than against the Jewish followers of the Greek schools. He  saw the danger to Judaism in the teachings of these anti-religious  philosophers, and deeply as he loved Greek culture, he loved more  deeply his religion. He wanted to reveal a philosophy in the Bible  which should win back to Judaism the men who had been captivated by  foreign thought. In one aspect, therefore, his master-work is a plea  for unity. The community at Alexandria was a very heterogeneous body;  not only were the sects which had appeared in Palestine, the Sadducees,  Samaritans, Pharisees, and Essenes, represented there too, but in  addition there were parties who attached themselves to one or other of  the Greek schools, the Pythagoreans, Skeptics, and the like, and  lastly Gnostic groups, who cultivated an esoteric doctrine of the  Godhead, and were lax in their observance of the law, which they held  to be purely symbolical and of no account in its literal meaning. The  mental activity which this growth of sects exemplified was in some  respects a healthy sign, but it contained seeds of religious chaos,  which bore their fruit in the next century. Men started by thinking  out a philosophical Judaism for themselves; they ended by ceasing to  be Jews and philosophers. Philo foresaw this danger, and he tried to  combat it by presenting his people with a commentary of the Bible  which should satisfy their intellectual and speculative bent, but at  the same time preserve their loyalty to the Bible and the law. To the  Greek world he offered a philosophical religion, to his own people a  religious philosophy. Thus the allegorical commentary is the crowning  point of his work, the offering of his deepest thought to the most  cultured of the community; and though much of its detail had only  relevancy for its own time, and its method may repel our modern taste,  yet the spirit which animates it is of value to all ages, and should  be an inspiration to every generation of emancipated Jews. That spirit  is one of fearless acceptance of the finest culture of the age  combined with unswerving love of the law and loyalty to catholic  Judaism.    We have already treated of the general characteristics of Philo's  method of allegorical interpretation, but we must now consider rather  more closely the way in which he employs it. The general principle  upon which he depends is, that besides and in addition to the literal  meaning which the Bible bears for the common man, it has a hidden and  deeper meaning for the philosopher. It is, as it were, a sort of  palimpsest; the writing on the top all may read, the writing below the  student alone can decipher. With the rabbis Philo holds that the Torah  was written \"in the language of the sons of man,\"[113] but he believes  with them again that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14667"],[0,"A Christmas Garland (#13)"],[1,"out with the greatest heartiness,  \"Capital! Bring him round with you at one o'clock to-morrow for turkey  and plum-pudding!\"    I betook myself straight to the Hotel Danieli, hoping against hope  that Ibsen's sole answer would not be a comminatory grunt and an  instant rupture of all future relations with myself. At first he was  indeed resolute not to go. He had never heard of this Herr Browning.  (It was one of the strengths of his strange, crustacean genius that  he never had heard of anybody.) I took it on myself to say that  Herr Browning would send his private gondola, propelled by his two  gondoliers, to conduct Herr Ibsen to the scene of the festivity. I  think it was this prospect that made him gradually unbend, for he had  already acquired that taste for pomp and circumstance which was so  notable a characteristic of his later years. I hastened back to the  Palazzo Rezzonico before he could change his mind. I need hardly say  that Browning instantly consented to send the gondola. So large  and lovable was his nature that, had he owned a thousand of those  conveyances, he would not have hesitated to send out the whole fleet  in honour of any friend of any friend of his.    Next day, as I followed Ibsen down the Danielian water-steps into the  expectant gondola, my emotion was such that I was tempted to snatch  from him his neatly-furled umbrella and spread it out over his head,  like the umbrella beneath which the Doges of days gone by had made  their appearances in public. It was perhaps a pity that I repressed  this impulse. Ibsen seemed to be already regretting that he had  unbent. I could not help thinking, as we floated along the Riva  Schiavoni, that he looked like some particularly ruthless member of  the Council of Ten. I did, however, try faintly to attune him in  some sort to the spirit of our host and of the day of the year. I  adumbrated Browning's outlook on life, translating into Norwegian, I  well remember, the words \"God's in His heaven, all's right with the  world.\" In fact I cannot charge myself with not having done what I  could. I can only lament that it was not enough.    When we marched into the _salone_, Browning was seated at the piano,  playing (I think) a Toccata of Galuppi's. On seeing us, he brought  his hands down with a great crash on the keyboard, seemed to reach  us in one astonishing bound across the marble floor, and clapped  Ibsen loudly on either shoulder, wishing him \"the Merriest of Merry  Christmases.\"    Ibsen, under this sudden impact, stood firm as a rock, and it flitted  through my brain that here at last was solved the old problem of what  would happen if an irresistible force met an immoveable mass. But it  was obvious that the rock was not rejoicing in the moment of victory.  I was tartly asked whether I had not explained to Herr Browning that  his guest did not understand English. I hastily rectified my omission,  and thenceforth our host spoke in Italian. Ibsen, though he understood  that language fairly well, was averse to speaking it. Such remarks as  he made in the course of the meal to which we presently sat down were  made in Norwegian and translated by myself.    Browning, while he was carving the turkey, asked Ibsen whether he had  visited any of the Venetian theatres. Ibsen's reply was that he never  visited theatres. Browning laughed his great laugh, and cried \"That's  right! We poets who write plays must give the theatres as wide a berth  as possible. We aren't wanted there!\" \"How so?\" asked Ibsen. Browning  looked a little puzzled, and I had to explain that in northern Europe  Herr Ibsen's plays were frequently performed. At this I seemed to see  on Browning's face a slight shadow--so swift and transient a shadow as  might be cast by a swallow flying across a sunlit garden. An instant,  and it was gone. I was glad, however, to be able to soften my  statement by adding that Herr Ibsen had in his recent plays abandoned  the use of verse.    The trouble was that in Browning's company he seemed practically to  have abandoned the use of prose too. When, moreover, he did speak, it  was always in a sense contrary to that of our host. The Risorgimento  was a theme always very near to the great heart of Browning, and on  this occasion he hymned it with more than his usual animation and  resource (if indeed that were possible). He descanted especially on  the vast increase that had accrued to the sum of human happiness  in Italy since the success of that remarkable movement. When Ibsen  rapped out the conviction that what Italy needed was to be invaded  and conquered once and for all by Austria, I feared that an explosion  was inevitable. But hardly had my translation of the inauspicious  sentiment been uttered when the plum-pudding was borne into the room,  flaming on its dish. I clapped my hands wildly at sight of it, in the  English fashion, and was intensely relieved when the yet more resonant  applause of Robert Browning followed mine. Disaster had been averted  by a crowning mercy. But I am afraid that Ibsen thought us both quite  mad.    The next topic that was started, harmless though it seemed at first,  was fraught with yet graver peril. The world of scholarship was at  that time agitated by the recent discovery of what might or might not  prove to be a fragment of Sappho. Browning proclaimed his unshakeable  belief in the authenticity of these verses. To my surprise, Ibsen,  whom I had been unprepared to regard as a classical scholar, said  positively that they had not been written by Sappho. Browning  challenged him to give a reason. A literal translation of the reply  would have been \"Because no woman ever was capable of writing a  fragment of good poetry.\" Imagination reels at the effect this would  have had on the recipient of \"Sonnets from the Portuguese.\" The  agonised interpreter, throwing honour to the winds, babbled some  wholly fallacious version of the words. Again the situation had  been saved; but it was of the kind that does not even in furthest  retrospect lose its power to freeze the heart and constrict the  diaphragm.    I was fain to thank heaven when, immediately after the termination  of the meal, Ibsen rose, bowed to his host, and bade me express  his thanks for the entertainment. Out on the Grand Canal, in the  gondola which had again been placed at our disposal, his passion  for \"documents\" that might bear on his work was quickly manifested.  He asked me whether Herr Browning had ever married. Receiving an  emphatically affirmative reply, he inquired whether Fru Browning had  been happy. Loth though I was to cast a blight on his interest in the  matter, I conveyed to him with all possible directness the impression  that Elizabeth Barrett had assuredly been one of those wives who do  not dance tarantellas nor slam front-doors. He did not, to the best  of my recollection, make further mention of Browning, either then or  afterwards. Browning himself, however, thanked me warmly, next  day, for having introduced my friend to him. \"A capital fellow!\" he  exclaimed, and then, for a moment, seemed as though he were about  to qualify this estimate, but ended by merely repeating \"A capital  fellow!\"    Ibsen remained in Venice some weeks after my return to London. He was,  it may be conjectured, bent on a specially close study of the Bride of  the Adriatic because her marriage had been not altogether a happy one.  But there appears to be no evidence whatsoever that he went again,  either of his own accord or by invitation, to the Palazzo Rezzonico.          OF CHRISTMAS    _By_    H*L**RE B*LL*C      There was a man came to an Inn by night, and after he had called three  times they should open him the door--though why three times, and not  three times three, nor thirty times thirty, which is the number of  the little stone devils that make mows at St. Aloesius of Ledera over  against the marshes Gue-la-Nuce to this day, nor three hundred times  three hundred (which is a bestial number), nor three thousand times  three-and-thirty, upon my soul I know not, and nor do you--when,  then, this jolly fellow had three times cried out, shouted, yelled,  holloa'd, loudly besought, caterwauled, brayed, sung out, and roared,  he did by the same token set himself to beat, hammer, bang, pummel,  and knock at the door. Now the door was Oak. It had been grown in the  forest of Boulevoise, hewn in Barre-le-Neuf, seasoned in South Hoxton,  hinged nowhere in particular, and panelled--and that most abominably  well--in Arque, where the peasants sell their souls for skill in such  handicraft. But our man knew nothing of all this, which, had he known  it, would have mattered little enough to him, for a reason which I  propose to tell in the next sentence. The door was opened. As to the  reasons why it was not opened sooner, these are most tediously set  forth in Professor Sir T.K. Slibby's \"Half-Hours With Historic Doors,\"  as also in a fragment at one time attributed to Oleaginus Silo but now  proven a forgery by Miss Evans. Enough for our purpose, merry reader  of mine, that the door was opened.    The man, as men will, went in. And there, for God's sake and by  the grace of Mary Mother, let us leave him; for the truth of it is  that his strength was all in his lungs, and himself a poor, weak,  clout-faced, wizen-bellied, pin-shanked bloke anyway, who at Trinity  Hall had spent the most of his time in reading Hume (that was  Satan's lackey) and after taking his degree did a little in the way  of Imperial Finance. Of him it was that Lord Abraham Hart, that  far-seeing statesman, said, \"This young man has the root of the matter  in him.\" I quote the epigram rather for its perfect form than for its  truth. For once, Lord Abraham was deceived. But it must be remembered  that he was at this time being plagued almost out of his wits by  the vile (though cleverly engineered) agitation for the compulsory  winding-up of the Rondoosdop Development"]]]
