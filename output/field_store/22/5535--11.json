No sooner did he begin to wonder about Flitter  the Bat than he could think of nothing else. So he watched until the  way was clear, and then he started for the Smiling Pool as fast as he  could go, lipperty-lipperty-lip. He hoped he would find Grandfather  Frog sitting as usual on his big green lily-pad, and that he would be  good-natured. If he wasn't feeling good-natured, it would be of no use  to ask him for a story.    When Peter reached the Smiling Pool he was disappointed, terribly  disappointed. The big green lily-pad was there, but there was no one  sitting on it. Somehow the Smiling Pool didn't seem quite like itself  without Grandfather Frog sitting there watching for foolish green  flies. Peter's face showed just how disappointed he felt. He was just  going to turn away when a great, deep voice said:    \"Chug-a-rum! Where are your manners, Peter Rabbit, that you forget to  speak to your elders?\"    Peter stared eagerly into the Smiling Pool, and presently he saw two  great, goggly eyes and the top of a green head, way out almost in the  middle of the Smiling Pool. It was Grandfather Frog himself, having  his morning swim.    \"Oh, Grandfather Frog, I didn't see you at all!\" cried Peter, \"If I  had, of course I would have spoken. The fact is, I--I--\"    \"You want a story,\" finished Grandfather Frog for him. \"You can't fool  me, Peter Rabbit. You came over here just to ask me for a story. I  know you, Peter! I know you! Well, what is it this time?\"    \"If you please,\" replied Peter politely and happily, for he saw that  Grandfather Frog was feeling good-natured, \"why is it that Flitter  the Bat flies only at night?\"    Grandfather Frog climbed out on his big green lily-pad and made  himself comfortable. Peter sat still and tried not to show how  impatient he felt. Grandfather Frog took his time. It tickled him to  see how hard impatient Peter was trying to be patient, and his big,  goggly eyes twinkled.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said he at last, with a suddenness that made Peter jump.  \"That's very good, Peter, very good indeed! Now I'll tell you the  story.\"    Of course he meant that Peter's effort to keep still was very good,  but Peter didn't know this, and he couldn't imagine what Grandfather  Frog meant. However, what he cared most about was the story, so he  settled himself to listen, his long ears standing straight up, and his  eyes stretched wide open as he watched Grandfather Frog. The latter  cleared his throat two or three times, each time as if he intended to  begin right then. It was one of Grandfather Frog's little jokes. He  did it just to tease Peter. At last he really did begin, and the very  first thing he did was to ask Peter a question.    \"What is the reason that you stay in the dear Old Briar-patch when  Reddy Fox is around?\"    \"So that he won't catch me, of course,\" replied Peter.    \"Very good,\" said Grandfather Frog. \"Now, why do you go over to the  sweet-clover patch every day?\"    \"Why, because there is plenty to eat there,\" replied Peter, looking  very, very much puzzled.    \"Well, now you've answered your own question,\" grunted Grandfather  Frog. \"Flitter flies at night because he is safest then, and because  he can find plenty to eat.\"    \"Oh,\" said Peter, and his voice sounded dreadfully disappointed. He  had found out what he had wanted to know, but he hadn't had a story.  He fidgeted about and looked very hard at Grandfather Frog, but the  latter seemed to think that he had told Peter what he wanted to know,  and that was all there was to it. Finally Peter sighed, and it was  such a heavy sigh! Then very slowly he turned his back on the Smiling  Pool and started to hop away.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog in his deepest, story-telling  voice. \"A long time ago when the world was young, the  great-great-ever-so-great grandfather of Flitter the Bat first learned  to fly.\"    \"I know!\" cried Peter eagerly. \"You told me about that, and it was a  splendid story.\"    \"But when he learned to fly, he found that Old Mother Nature never  gives all her blessings to any single one of her little people,\"  continued Grandfather Frog, without paying the least attention to  Peter's interruption. \"Old Mr. Bat had wings; something no other  animal had, but he found that he could no longer run and jump. He  could just flop about on the ground, and was almost helpless. Of  course that meant that he could very easily be caught, and so the  ground was no longer a safe place for him. But he soon found that he  was not safe in the air in daytime. Old Mr. Hawk could fly even faster  than he, and Mr. Hawk was always watching for him. At first, Mr. Bat  didn't know what to do. He didn't like to go to Old Mother Nature and  complain that his new wings were not all that he had thought they  would be. That would look as if he were ungrateful for her kindness  in giving him the wings.    \"'I've got to think of some way out of my troubles myself,' thought  old Mr. Bat. 'When I'm sure that I can't, it will be time enough to go  to Old Mother Nature.'    \"Now of course it is very hard to think when you are twisting and  dodging and turning in the air.\"    \"Of course!\" said Peter Rabbit, just as if he knew all about it.    \"So Mr. Bat went looking for a place where he could be quiet all by  himself and think without danger of being gobbled up for some one's  dinner,\" continued Grandfather Frog. \"He flew and he flew and had  almost given up hope of finding any such place when he saw a cave. It  looked very black inside, but it was big enough for Mr. Bat to fly  into, and in he went. He knew that Mr. Hawk would never come in  there, and when he found a little shelf up near the roof, he knew that  he was safe from any four-footed enemies who might follow him there.  It was just the place to rest and think. So he rested, and while he  rested, he thought and thought.    \"By and by he noticed that it was growing dark outside. 'My goodness!  If I am going to get anything to eat to-day, I shall have to hurry,'  thought he. When he got outside, he found that Mr. Sun had gone to  bed. So had all the birds, except Mr. Owl and Mr. Nighthawk. Now Mr.  Nighthawk doesn't belong to the Hawk family at all, so there was  nothing to fear from him. Then Mr. Bat had a very pleasant surprise.  He found the air full of insects, ever so many more than in the  daytime. By being very smart and quick he caught a few before it was  too dark for him to see. They didn't fill his stomach, but they kept  him from starving. As he flew back to the cave, a great idea came to  him, the idea for which he had been thinking so hard. He would sleep  days in the cave, where he was perfectly safe, and come out to hunt  bugs and insects just as soon as Mr. Hawk had gone to bed! Then he  would be safe and would not have to complain to Old Mother Nature.    \"At first old Mr. Bat, who wasn't old then, you know, had hard work to  catch enough insects before it grew too dark, but he found that every  night he could see a little longer and a little better than the night  before, until by and by he could see as well in the dusk as he used to  see in the daytime. Then he realized that Old Mother Nature had once  more been very good to him, and that she had helped him just as she  always helps those who help themselves. She had given him  night-seeing eyes, and he no more had to go hungry.    \"Mr. Bat was very grateful, and from that day to this, Bats have been  content to live in caves and fly in the evening. You ask Flitter if it  isn't so.\"    Peter grinned. \"He never stays in one place long enough for me to ask  him anything,\" said he. \"I'm ever so much obliged for the story,  Grandfather Frog. It pays to make the best of what we have, doesn't  it?\"    \"It certainly does. Chug-a-rum! It certainly does!\" replied  Grandfather Frog.          XV    WHY SPOTTY THE TURTLE CARRIES HIS HOUSE WITH HIM      Spotty the Turtle sat on an old log on the bank of the Smiling Pool,  taking a sun-bath. He had sat that way for the longest time without  once moving. Peter Rabbit had seen him when he went by on his way to  the Laughing Brook and the Green Forest to look for some one to pass  the time of day with. Spotty was still there when Peter returned a  long time after, and he didn't look as if he had moved. A sudden  thought struck Peter. He couldn't remember that he ever had seen  Spotty's house. He had seen the houses of most of his other friends,  but think as hard as ever he could, he didn't remember having seen  Spotty's.    \"Hi, Spotty!\" he shouted. \"Where do you live?\"    Spotty slowly turned his head and looked up at Peter. There was a  twinkle in his eyes, though Peter didn't see it.    \"Right here in the Smiling Pool. Where else should I live?\" he  replied.    \"I mean, where is your house?\" returned Peter. \"Of course I know you  live in the Smiling Pool, but where is your house? Is it in the bank  or down under water?\"    \"It is just wherever I happen to be. Just now it is right here,\" said  Spotty. \"I always take it with me wherever I go; I find it much the  handiest way.\"    [Illustration: \"Hi, Spotty!\" he shouted. \"Where do you live?\"]    With that Spotty disappeared. That is to say, his head and legs and  tail disappeared. Peter stared very hard. Then he began to laugh, for  it came to him that what Spotty had said was true. His house was  with him, and now he had simply retired inside. He didn't need any  other house than just that hard, spotted shell, inside of which he was  now so cosily tucked away.    \"That's a great idea! Ho, ho, ho! That's a great idea!\" shouted Peter.    \"Of course it is,\" replied Spotty, putting nothing but his head out,  \"You will always find me at home whenever you call, Peter, and that is  more than you can say of most other people.\"    All the way to his own home in the dear Old Briar-patch, Peter "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],[0,"The Hymns of Prudentius (#13)"],[1,"sensim recisa extinxerat!

HYMN FOR CHRISTMAS-DAY        Why doth the sun re-orient take    A wider range, his limits break?    Lo! Christ is born, and o'er earth's night    Shineth from more to more the light!      Too swiftly did the radiant day    Her brief course run and pass away:    She scarce her kindly torch had fired    Ere slowly fading it expired.      Now let the sky more brightly beam,    The earth take up the joyous theme:    The orb a broadening pathway gains    And with its erstwhile splendour reigns.      Sweet babe, of chastity the flower,    A virgin's blest mysterious dower!    Rise in Thy twofold nature's might:    Rise, God and man to reunite!      Though by the Father's will above    Thou wert begot, the Son of Love,    Yet in His bosom Thou didst dwell,    Of Wisdom the eternal Well;      Wisdom, whereby the heavens were made    And light's foundations first were laid:    Creative Word! all flows from Thee!    The Word is God eternally.      For though with process of the suns    The ordered whole harmonious runs,    Still the Artificer Divine    Leaves not the Father's inmost shrine.      The rolling wheels of Time had passed    O'er their millennial journey vast,    Before in judgment clad He came    Unto the world long steeped in shame.      The purblind souls of mortals crass    Had trusted gods of stone and brass,    To things of nought their worship paid    And senseless blocks of wood obeyed.      And thus employed, they fell below    The sway of man's perfidious foe:    Plunged in the smoky sheer abyss    They sank bereft of their true bliss.      But that sore plight of ruined man    Christ's pity could not lightly scan:    Nor let God's building nobly wrought    Ingloriously be brought to nought.      He wrapped Him in our fleshly guise,    That from the tomb He might arise,    And man released from death's grim snare    Home to His Father's bosom bear.      This is the day of Thy dear birth,    The bridal of the heaven and earth,    When the Creator breathed on Thee    The breath of pure humanity.      Ah! glorious Maid, dost thou not guess    What guerdon thy chaste soul shall bless,    How by thy ripening pangs is bought    An honour greater than all thought?      O what a load of joy untold    Thy womb inviolate doth hold!    Of thee a golden age is born,    The brightness of the earth's new morn!      Hearken! doth not the infant's wail    The universal springtide hail?    For now the world re-born lays by    Its gloomy, frost-bound apathy.      Methinks in all her rustic bowers    The earth is spread with clustering flowers:    Odours of nard and nectar sweet    E'en o'er the sands of Syrtes fleet.      All places rough and deserts wild    Have felt from far Thy coming, Child:    Rocks to Thy gentle empire bow    And verdure clothes the mountain brow.      Sweet honey from the boulder leaps:    The sere and leafless oak-bough weeps    A strange rich attar: tamarisks too    Of balsam pure distil the dew.      Blessed for ever, cradle dear,    The lowly stall, the cavern drear!    Men to this shrine, Eternal King,    With dumb brutes adoration bring.      The ox and ass in homage low    Obedient to their Maker bow:    Bows too the unlearn'd heartless crowd    Whose minds the sensual feast doth cloud.      Though, by the faithful Spirit impelled,    Shepherds and brutes, unreasoning held,    Yea, folk that did in darkness dwell    Discern their God in His poor cell:      Yet children of the sacred race    Blindly abhor the Incarnate grace:    By philtres you might deem them lulled    Or by some bacchic phrenzy dulled.      Why headlong thus to ruin stride?    If aught of soundness in you bide,    Behold in Him the Lord divine    Of all your patriarchal line.      Mark you the dim-lit cave, the Maid,    The humble nurse, the cradle laid,    The helpless infancy forlorn:    Yet thus the Gentiles' King was born!      Ah sinner, thou shalt one day see    This Child in dreadful majesty,    See Him in glorious clouds descend,    While thou thy guilty heart shalt rend.      Vain all thy tears, when loud shall sound    The trump, when flames shall scorch the ground,    When from its hinge the cloven world    Is loosed, in horrid tumult hurled.      Then throned on high, the Judge of all    Shall mortals to their reckoning call:    To these shall grant the prize of light,    To those Gehenna's gloomy night.      Then, Israel, shalt thou learn at length    The Cross hath, as the lightning, strength:    Doomed by thy wrath, He now is Lord,    Whom Death once grasped but soon restored.
