The Pinczovs,  descendants of Rabbi Polack, connected with the most eminent rabbinical  families, and themselves famous for piety and erudition, produced many  works on mathematics and philosophy. Mendelssohn's translation of the  Pentateuch was at first hailed with joy, and was recommended by the most  zealous rabbis. Doctor Hurwitz of Vilna did not hesitate to dedicate his  _'Ammude Bet Yehudah_ to Wessely, who was more popular in Russo-Poland  than in Germany. The whole edition of his _Yen Lebanon_, which fell flat  in the latter country, though offered gratis, was sold when introduced  into the former.[41] Joseph Pesseles' correspondence concerning Dubno,  with David Friedlaender, the disciple of Mendelssohn (1773), proves the  high esteem in which the liberal-minded savants of Berlin were held in  Russia. The rabbis of Brest, Slutsk, and Lublin gave laudatory  recommendations to Judah Loeb Margolioth's popular works of natural  science, which form a little encyclopedia by themselves. Margolioth was  the grandson of Mordecai Jaffe, himself rabbi successively at Busnov,  Szebrszyn, Polotsk, Lesla, and Frankfort-on-the-Oder (d. 1811). The  writings of Baruch Schick of Shklov, referred to above, were accorded  the same welcome. His translation of Euclid and his treatises on  trigonometry, astronomy (_'Ammude ha-Shamayim_), and anatomy (_Tiferet  Adam_) won the admiration of rabbis as well as laymen. Epitaphs of the  day contain the statement that the deceased was not only \"at home in all  the chambers of the Torah,\" but also in \"philosophy and the seven  sciences.\" And this, exaggerated though it may be, must be seen to  contain a kernel of the truth, when we recall that among Maimon's  intimate friends was the rabbi of Kletzk, Lithuania; that in the humble  dwelling of his father there were works on historical, astronomical, and  philosophical subjects; that the chief rabbi of a neighboring town,  Rabbi Samson of Slonim, who, according to Fuenn, \"had in his youth lived  for a while in Germany, learned the German language there, and made  himself acquainted in some measure with the sciences,\" continued his  study of the sciences, and soon collected a fair library of German  books.[42] Saadia, Bahya, Halevi, Ibn Ezra, Crescas, Bedersi, Levi ben  Gerson (whom Goldenthal calls the Hebrew Kant), Albo, Abarbanel, and  others whose works deserve a high place in the history of Jewish  philosophy, were on the whole fairly represented in the libraries, and  diligently studied in the numerous yeshibot and batte midrashim.    Thus the enlightenment which dawned upon France, Germany, and England  cast a glow even on the Slavonic Jews, despite the Chinese wall of  disabilities that hemmed them in. Unfortunately, this only helped to  render them dissatisfied with their wretched lot, without affording them  the means of ameliorating it. While the Jews in Western Europe profited  and were encouraged by the example of their Christian neighbors; while,  in addition to their innate thirst for learning, they had everywhere  else political and civil preferments to look forward to, in Russo-Poland  not only were such outside stimuli absent, but the Slavonic Jews had to  struggle against obstacles and hindrances at every step. No such heaven  on earth could be dreamed of there. The country was still in a most  barbarous state. Those who wished to perfect themselves in any of the  sciences had to leave home and all and go to a foreign land, and had to  study, as they were bidden to study the Talmud, \"lishmah,\" that is, for  its own sake. This is the distinguishing feature between the German and  Slavonic Maskilim during the eighteenth century. The cry of the former  was, \"Become learned, lest the nations say we are not civilized and deny  us the wealth, respect, and especially the equality we covet!\" The  latter were humbly seeking after the truth, either because they could  better elucidate the Talmud, or because, as they held, it was _their_  truth, of which the nations had deprived them during their long  exile.[43] They were unlike their German brethren in another respect.  Almost all of them were \"self-made men,\" autodidacts in the truest  sense. Lacking the advantages of secular schools, they culled their  first information from scanty, antiquated Hebrew translations. Maimon  learned the Roman alphabet from the transliteration of the titles on the  fly-leaves of some Talmudic tracts; Doctor Behr, from Wolff's  _Mathematics_. But no sooner was the impetus given than it was followed  by an insatiable craving for more and more of the intellectual manna,  for a wider and wider horizon. \"Look,\" says Wessely, \"look at our  Russian and Polish brethren who immigrate hither, men great in Torah,  yet admirers of the sciences, which, without the guiding help of  teachers, they all master to such perfection as to surpass even a  Gentile sage!\"[44] Such self-education was, of course, not without  unfavorable results. Never having enjoyed the advantage of a systematic  elementary training, the enthusiasts sometimes lacked the very rudiments  of knowledge, though engaged in the profoundest speculations of  philosophy. \"As our mothers in Egypt gave birth to their children before  the mid-wife came,\" writes Pinsker somewhat later,[45] \"even so it is  with the intellectual products of our brethren: before one becomes  acquainted with the grammar of a language, he masters its classic and  scientific literature!\"    Steadily though slowly, brighter, if not better, days were coming.  \"Thought once awakened shall not again slumber.\" As Carlyle says of the  French of that period, it became clear for the first time to the  upturned eyes of the Jews, \"that Thought has actually a kind of  existence in other kingdoms [than the Talmud]; that some glimmerings of  civilization had dawned here and there on the human species.\" They begin  to try all things; they visit Germany, France, Denmark, Holland, even  England; learn their literatures, study in their universities, and  contribute their quota to the apologetic, controversial, scientific, and  philosophic investigations \"with a candor and real love of improvement  which give the best omens of a still higher success.\" Fortune, indeed,  has cast them also into a cavern, and they are groping around darkly.  But this prisoner, too, is a giant, and he will, at length, burst forth  as a giant into the light of day.    (Notes, pp. 310-314.)          CHAPTER III    THE DAWN OF HASKALAH    1794-1840      A glimmer of light pierced the Russian sky at the accession of Catherine  II (1762-1796). This \"Semiramis of the North,\" the admirer of Buffon,  Montesquieu, Diderot, and, more especially, Voltaire, whose motto, _N'en  croyez rien_, she adopted, endeavored, and for a while not without  success, to introduce into her own country the spirit of tolerance which  pervaded France. Her ukases were intended for all alike, \"without  distinction of religion and nationality.\" Her regard for her Jewish  citizens she showed by allowing them to settle in the interior,  establish printing-presses (January 27, 1783), and become civil and  Government officers (April 2, 1785). In the edict promulgated by  Governor-General Chernyshev it is stated that \"religious liberty and  inviolability of property are hereby granted to all subjects of Russia  and certainly to the Jews; for the humanitarian principles of her  Majesty do not permit the exclusion of the Jews alone from the favors  shown to all, so long as they, as faithful subjects, continue to employ  themselves, as hitherto, with commerce and trade, each according to his  vocation.\" That she remained true to her promise, we see from the  numerous privileges enjoyed by many Jews, who began to frequent Moscow  and St. Petersburg and reside there for business purposes.    Paul (1796-1801), too, was kindly disposed toward the Jews, and  permitted them to live in Courland; and when Alexander I (1801-1825)  became czar, their hopes turned into certainty. Alexander I did, indeed,  appear a most promising ruler at his accession. The theories he had  acquired from Laharpe he fully intended to apply to practical life. Like  Catherine, he wished to rule in equity and promote the welfare of his  subjects irrespective of race or creed. He ordered a commission to  investigate the status of the Russian Jews (December 9, 1802). The  result was the polozheniye (enactment) of December 9, 1804, according to  which Jews were to be eligible to one-third of all municipal offices;  they were to be permitted to establish factories, become agriculturists,  and either attend the schools and colleges of the empire on the same  footing as subjects of the Christian faith, or, if they desired, found  and maintain schools of their own. The approach of the great Usurper and  the crushing defeat the Russians sustained at the battle of Friedland  (June 4, 1808) also favored the advance of the Jews. As the short, but  troublous, reign of Paul and his wars with Turkey, Persia, Prussia,  Poland, and Sweden had impoverished the country and depleted the  treasury, the shrewd Alexander was not averse from appealing to Jews for  help. Of course, as in many more enlightened countries and in more  modern times, most of the privileges were merely paper privileges. Few  of them ever went into effect. The noble intentions of the enlightened  rulers were steadily thwarted by bigoted councillors and jealous  merchants. Every favor shown the Jews aroused a storm of protests, which  resulted in numerous infringements. The Jews were compelled to pay for  the good intentions of Catherine with a double tax (June 25, 1794), and,  during Paul's reign, without the emperor's knowledge, a law was enacted  requiring of Jews double payment of the guild license. In spite of all  efforts, the Jews, instead of being emancipated"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15932"],[0,"The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians (#13)"],[1,"      9. \"Hail, Crusher of bones, who comest forth from Hensu, I have not       lied.\"    Nothing is known of the greater number of these Forty-two gods, but it  is probable that they were local gods or spirits, each one representing  a nome, whose names were added to the declarations with the view of  making the Forty-two Judges represent all Egypt.    In the third part of the Chapter we find that the religious ideas  expressed by the deceased have a far more personal character than those  of the first and second parts. Thus, having declared his innocence of  the forty-two sins or offences, \"the heart which is righteous and  sinless\" says:    \"Homage to you, O ye gods who dwell in your Hall of Maati! I know you  and I know your names. Let me not fall under your knives, and bring ye  not before the god whom ye follow my wickedness, and let not evil come  upon me through you. Declare ye me innocent in the presence of  Nebertcher,[1] because I have done that which is right in Tamera  (Egypt), neither blaspheming God, nor imputing evil (?) to the king in  his day. Homage to you, O ye gods, who live in your Hall of Maati, who  have no taint of sin in you, who live upon truth, who feed upon truth  before Horus, the dweller in his disk. Deliver me from Baba, who liveth  upon the entrails of the mighty ones, on the day of the Great Judgment.  Let me come to you, for I have not committed offences [against you]; I  have not done evil, I have not borne false witness; therefore let  nothing [evil] be done unto me. I live upon truth. I feed upon truth. I  have performed the commandments of men, and the things which make the  gods contented. I have made the god to be at peace [with me by doing]  that which is his will. I have given bread to the hungry man, and water  to the thirsty man, and apparel to the naked man, and a ferry boat to  him that had none. I have made offerings to the gods, and given funerary  meals to the spirits. Therefore be ye my deliverers, be ye my  protectors; make ye no accusations against me in the presence [of the  Great God]. I am clean of mouth and clean of hands; therefore let be  said unto me by those who shall see me: 'Come in peace, come in peace'  (_i.e._ Welcome! Welcome!).... I have testified before Herfhaf,[2] and  he hath approved me. I have seen the things over which the Persea tree  spreadeth [its branches] in Rastau. I offer up my prayers to the gods,  and I know their persons. I have come and have advanced to declare the  truth and to set up the Balance[3] on its stand in Aukert.\"[4]    [Footnote 1: The Lord to the uttermost limit, _i.e._ Almighty God.]    [Footnote 2: The celestial ferryman who ferried the souls of the  righteous to the Island of Osiris. None but the righteous could enter  his boat, and none but the righteous was allowed to land on the Island  of Osiris.]    [Footnote 3: The balance in which the heart was weighed.]    [Footnote 4: A name of a part of the Other World near Heliopolis.]    Then addressing the god Osiris the deceased says: \"Hail, thou who art  exalted upon thy standard, thou lord of the Atef crown, whose name is  'Lord of the Winds,' deliver me from thine envoys who inflict evils, who  do harm, whose faces are uncovered, for I have done the right for the  Lord of Truth. I have purified myself and my fore parts with holy water,  and my hinder parts with the things that make clean, and my inward parts  have been [immersed] in the Lake of Truth. There is not one member of  mine wherein truth is lacking. I purified myself in the Pool of the  South. I rested in the northern town in the Field of the Grasshoppers,  wherein the sailors of Ra bathe at the second hour of the night and at  the third hour of the day.\" One would think that the moral worth of the  deceased was such that he might then pass without delay into the most  holy part of the Hall of Truth where Osiris was enthroned. But this is  not the case, for before he went further he was obliged to repeat the  magical names of various parts of the Hall of Truth; thus we find that  the priest thrust his magic into the most sacred of texts. At length  Thoth, the great Recorder of Egypt, being satisfied as to the good faith  and veracity of the deceased, came to him and asked why he had come to  the Hall of Truth, and the deceased replied that he had come in order to  be \"mentioned\" to the god. Thoth then asked him, \"Who is he whose heaven  is fire, whose walls are serpents, and the floor of whose house is a  stream of water?\" The deceased replied, \"Osiris\"; and he was then bidden  to advance so that he might be introduced to Osiris. As a reward for his  righteous life sacred food, which proceeded from the Eye of Ra, was  allotted to him, and, living on the food of the god, he became a  counterpart of the god.    From first to last the Book of the Dead is filled with spells and  prayers for the preservation of the mummy and for everlasting life. As  instances of these the following passages are quoted from Chapters 154  and 175. \"Homage to thee, O my divine father Osiris, thou livest with  thy members. Thou didst not decay. Thou didst not turn into worms. Thou  didst not waste away. Thou didst not suffer corruption. Thou didst not  putrefy. I am the god Khepera, and my members shall have an everlasting  existence. I shall not decay. I shall not rot. I shall not putrefy. I  shall not turn into worms. I shall not see corruption before the eye of  the god Shu. I shall have my being, I shall have my being. I shall live,  I shall live. I shall flourish, I shall flourish. I shall wake up in  peace. I shall not putrefy. My inward parts shall not perish. I shall  not suffer injury. Mine eye shall not decay. The form of my visage shall  not disappear. Mine ear shall not become deaf. My head shall not be  separated from my neck. My tongue shall not be carried away. My hair  shall not be cut off. Mine eyebrows shall not be shaved off. No baleful  injury shall come upon me. My body shall be established, and it shall  neither crumble away nor be destroyed on this earth.\" The passage that  refers to everlasting life occurs in Chapter 175, wherein the scribe  Ani is made to converse with Thoth and Temu in the Tuat, or Other World.  Ani, who is supposed to have recently arrived there, says: \"What manner  of country is this to which I have come? There is no water in it. There  is no air. It is depth unfathomable, it is black as the blackest night,  and men wander helplessly therein. In it a man may not live in quietness  of heart; nor may the affections be gratified therein.\" After a short  address to Osiris, the deceased asks the god, \"How long shall I live?\"  And the god says, \"It is decreed that thou shalt live for millions of  millions of years, a life of millions of years.\"    As a specimen of a spell that was used in connection with an amulet may  be quoted Chapter 156. The amulet was the _tet_, which represented a  portion of the body of Isis. The spell reads: \"The blood of Isis, the  power of Isis, the words of power of Isis shall be strong to protect  this mighty one (_i.e._ the mummy), and to guard him from him that would  do unto him anything which he abominateth (or, is taboo to him).\" The  object of the spell is explained in the Rubric, which reads: \"[This  spell] shall be said over a _tet_ made of carnelian, which hath been  steeped in water of _ankham_ flowers, and set in a frame of sycamore  wood, and placed on the neck of the deceased on the day of the funeral.  If these things be done for him the powers of Isis shall protect his  body, and Horus, the son of Isis, shall rejoice in him when he seeth  him. And there shall be no places hidden from him as he journeyeth. And  one hand of his shall be towards heaven and the other towards earth,  regularly and continually. Thou shalt not let any person who is with  thee see it [a few words broken away].\" Of the spells written in the  Book of the Dead to make crocodiles, serpents, and other reptiles  powerless, the following are specimens: \"Away with thee! Retreat! Get  back, O thou accursed Crocodile Sui. Thou shalt not come nigh me, for I  have life through the words of power that are in me. If I utter thy name  to the Great God he will make thee to come before the two divine  messengers Betti and Herkemmaat. Heaven ruleth its seasons, and the  spell hath power over what it mastereth, and my mouth ruleth the spell  that is inside it. My teeth which bite are like flint knives, and my  teeth which grind are like unto those of the Wolf-god. O thou who  sittest spellbound with thine eyes fixed through my spell, thou shalt  not carry off my spell, thou Crocodile that livest on spells\" (Chap.  XXXI).         \"Get thee back, thou Crocodile of the West, that livest on the       never-resting stars. That which is thy taboo is in me. I have eaten       the brow (or, skull) of Osiris. I am set.         \"Get thee back, thou Crocodile of the West. The serpent Nau is       inside me. I will set it on thee, thy flame shall not approach me.         \"Get thee back, thou Crocodile of the East, that feedest upon the       eaters of filth. That which is thy taboo is in me. I advance. I am       Osiris.         \"Get thee back, thou Crocodile of the East. The serpent Nau is       inside me. I will set it on thee; thy flame shall not approach me.         \"Get thee back, thou Crocodile of the South, that feedest upon       waste, garbage, and filth. That which is thy taboo is in me....
