I am about  to reveal to thee, Gilgames, a secret, and the judgment of the gods I am  about to tell it thee. There is a plant similar to the hawthorn in its  flower, and whose thorns prick like the viper. If thy hand can lay hold  of that plant without being torn, break from it a branch, and bear it  with thee; it will secure for thee an eternal youth.'Gilgames gathers  the branch, and in his joy plans with Arad-Ea future enterprises:  'Arad-Ea, this plant is the plant of renovation, by which a man  obtains life; I will bear it with me to Uruk the well-protected, I will  cultivate a bush from it, I will cut some of it, and its name shall  be, \"the old man becomes young by it;\" I will eat of it, and I shall  repossess the vigour of my youth.'\" He reckoned without the gods, whose  jealous minds will not allow men to participate in their privileges.  The first place on which they set foot on shore, \"he perceived a well of  fresh water, went down to it, and whilst he was drawing water, a serpent  came out of it, and snatched from him the plant, yea--the serpent rushed  out and bore away the plant, and while escaping uttered a malediction.  That day Gilgames sat down, he wept, and his tears streamed down his  cheeks he said to the mariner Arad-Ba: 'What is the use, Arad-Ea, of my  renewed strength; what is the use of my heart's rejoicing in my return  to life? It is not myself I have served; it is this earthly lion I have  served. Hardly twenty leagues on the road, and he for himself alone has  already taken possession of the plant. As I opened the well, the plant  was lost to me, and the genius of the fountain took possession of it:  who am I that I should tear it from him?'\" He re-embarks in sadness,  he re-enters Uruk the well-protected, and at length begins to think of  celebrating the funeral solemnities of Eabani, to whom he was not able  to show respect at the time of his death. He supervises them, fulfils  the rites, intones the final chant: \"The temples, thou shalt enter them  no more; the white vestments, thou shalt no longer put them on; the  sweet-smelling ointments, thou shalt no longer anoint thyself with them  to envelop thee with their perfume. Thou shalt no longer press thy  bow to the ground to bend it, but those that the bow has wounded shall  surround thee; thou no longer holdest thy sceptre in thy hand, but  spectres fascinate thee; thou no longer adornest thy feet with wings,  thou no longer givest forth a sound upon the earth. Thy wife whom thou  lovedst thou embracest her no more; thy wife whom thou hatedst thou  beatest her no more. Thy daughter whom thou lovedst thou embracest her  no more; thy daughter whom thou hatedst, thou beatest her no more. The  resounding earth lies heavy upon thee, she who is dark, she who is  dark, Tjinazu the mother, she who is dark, whose side is-not veiled with  splendid vestments, whose bosom, like a new-born animal, is not covered.  Eabani has descended from the earth to Hades; it is not the messenger  of Nergal the implacable who has snatched him away, it is not the plague  which has carried him off, it is not consumption that has carried him  off, it is the earth which has carried him off; it is not the field of  battle which has carried him off, it is the earth which has carried him  off!\" Gilgames dragged himself along from temple to temple, repeating  his complaint before Bel and before Sin, and at length threw himself  at the feet of the god of the Dead, Nergal: \"'Burst open the sepulchral  cavern, open the ground, that the spirit of Eabani may issue from the  soil like a blast of wind.' As soon as Nergal the valiant heard him,  he burst open the sepulchral vault, he opened the earth, he caused the  spirit of Eabani to issue from the earth like a blast of wind.\" Gilgames  interrogates him, and asks him with anxiety what the state of the dead  may be: \"'Tell, my friend, tell, my friend, open the earth and what thou  seest tell it.'--'I cannot tell it thee, my friend, I cannot tell it  thee; if I should open the earth before thee, if I were to tell to thee  that which I have seen, terror would overthrow thee, thou wouldest faint  away, thou wouldest weep.'--'Terror will overthrow me, I shall faint  away, I shall weep, but tell it to me.'\" And the ghost depicts for him  the sorrows of the abode and the miseries of the shades. Those only  enjoy some happiness who have fallen with arms in their hands, and who  have been solemnly buried after the fight; the manes neglected by their  relatives succumb to hunger and thirst.* \"On a sleeping couch he lies,  drinking pure water, he who has been killed in battle. 'Thou hast seen  him?'--'I have seen him; his father and his mother support his head, and  his wife bends over him wailing.' 'But he whose body remains forgotten  in the fields,--thou hast seen him?'--'I have seen him; his soul has no  rest at all in the earth.' 'He whose soul no one cares for,--thou hast  seen him?'--'I have seen him; the dregs of the cup, the remains of a  repast, that which is thrown among the refuse of the street, that is  what he has to nourish him.'\" This poem did not proceed in its entirety,  or at one time, from the imagination of a single individual. Each  episode of it answers to some separate legend concerning Gilgames, or  the origin of Uruk the well-protected: the greater part preserves under  a later form an air of extreme antiquity, and, if the events dealt with  have not a precise bearing on the life of a king, they paint in a lively  way the vicissitudes of the life of the people.** These lions, leopards,  or gigantic uruses with which Grilgames and his faithful Eabani carry  on so fierce a warfare, are not, as is sometimes said, mythological  animals.         * Cf. vol. i. pp. 160, 161 of this History for analogous       ideas among the Egyptians as to the condition of the dead       who were neglected by their relatives: the Egyptian double       had to live on the same refuse as the Chaldaean soul.         ** G. Smith, identifying Gilgames with Nimrod, believes, on       the other hand, that Nimrod was a real king, who reigned in       Mesopotamia about 2250 B.C.; the poem contains, according to       him, episodes, more or less embellished, in the life of the       sovereign.    Similar monsters, it was believed, appeared from time to time in the  marshes of Chaldaea, and gave proof of their existence to the inhabitants  of neighbouring villages by such ravages as real lions and tigers commit  in India or the Sahara. It was the duty of chiefs on the border lands of  the Euphrates, as on the banks of the Nile, as among all peoples still  sunk in semi-barbarism, to go forth to the attack of these beasts  single-handed, and to sacrifice themselves one after the other, until  one of them more fortunate or stronger than the rest should triumph  over these mischievous brutes. The kings of Babylon and Nineveh in later  times converted into a pleasure that which had been an official duty of  their early predecessors: Gilgames had not yet arrived at that stage,  and the seriousness, not to speak of the fear, with which he entered  on the fight with such beasts, is an evidence of the early date of the  portions of his history which are concerned with his hunting exploits.  The scenes are represented on the seals of princes who reigned prior to  the year 3000 B.C., and the work of the ancient engraver harmonizes so  perfectly with the description of the comparatively modern scribe that  it seems like an anticipated illustration of the latter; the engravings  represent so persistently and with so little variation the images of  the monsters, and those of Gilgames and his faithful Eabani, that the  corresponding episodes in the poem must have already existed as we know  them, if not in form, at least in their main drift. Other portions of  the poem are more recent, and it would seem that the expedition against  Khumbaba contains allusions to the Elamite* invasions from which Chaldaea  had suffered so much towards the XXth century before our era. The  traditions which we possess of the times following the Deluge, embody,  like the adventures of Gilganes, very ancient elements, which the  scribes or narrators wove together in a more or less skilful manner  around the name of some king or divinity.         * Smith thought he could restore from the poem a part of       Chaldaean history: he supposed Izdubar-Nimrod to have been,       about 2250, the liberator of Babylon, oppressed by Elam, and       the date of the foundation of a great Babylonian empire to       have coincided with his victory over the Elamites. The       annals of Assurbanipal show us, in fact, that an Elamite       king, Kudurnankhundi, had pillaged Uruk about 2280 B.C., and       had transported to Susa a statue of the goddess Ishtar.

The original measures about 1 2/5 inch in       height.    The fabulous chronicle of the cities of the Euphrates existed,  therefore, in a piecemeal condition--in the memory of the people or in  the books of the priests--before even their primitive history began;  the learned who collected it later on had only to select some of the  materials with which it furnished them, in order to form out of them a  connected narrative, in which the earliest ages were distinguished from  the most recent only in the assumption of more frequent and more direct  interpositions of the powers of heaven in the affairs of men. Every city  had naturally its own version, in which its own protecting deities, its  heroes and princes, played the most important parts. That of Babylon  threw all the rest into the shade; not that it was superior to them,  but because this city had speedily become strong"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17324"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12) (#13)"],[1,"kings _hyku_-Shausu; other       passages, or, the same passages wrongly interpreted, were       applied to the race, and were rendered _hyku_-Shausu = \"the       _prisoners_ taken from the Shausu,\" a substantive derived       from the root _haka_ = \"to take\" being substituted for the       noun _hyqu_ = \"prince.\" Josephus declares, on the authority       of Manetho, that some manuscripts actually suggested this       derivation--a fact which is easily explained by the custom       of the Egyptian record offices. I may mention, in passing,       that Mariette recognised in the element \"_Sos_\" an Egyptian       word _shos_ = \"soldiers,\" and in the name of King Mirmashau,       which he read Mirshosu, an equivalent of the title Hyq-       Shosu.    But we are without any clue as to their real name, language, or origin.  The writers of classical times were unable to come to an agreement on  these questions: some confounded the Hyksos with the Phoenicians, others  regarded them as Arabs.* Modern scholars have put forward at least  a dozen contradictory hypotheses on the matter. The Hyksos have been  asserted to have been Canaanites, Elamites, Hittites, Accadians,  Scythians. The last opinion found great favour with the learned, as  long as they could believe that the sphinxes discovered by Mariette  represented Apophis or one of his predecessors. As a matter of fact,  these monuments present all the characteristics of the Mongoloid type  of countenance--the small and slightly oblique eyes, the arched but  somewhat flattened nose, the pronounced cheekbones and well-covered  jaw, the salient chin and full lips slightly depressed at the corners.**  These peculiarities are also observed in the three heads found at  Damanhur, in the colossal torso dug up at Mit-Fares in the Fayum, in  the twin figures of the Nile removed to the Bulaq Museum from Tanis, and  upon the remains of a statue in the collection at the Villa Ludovisi in  Rome. The same foreign type of face is also found to exist among the  present inhabitants of the villages scattered over the eastern part  of the Delta, particularly on the shores of Lake Menzaleh, and the  conclusion was drawn that these people were the direct descendants of  the Hyksos.         * Manetho takes them to be Phoenicians, but he adds that       certain writers thought them to be Arabs: Brugsch favours       this latter view, but the Arab legend of a conquest of Egypt       by Sheddad and the Adites is of recent origin, and was       inspired by traditions in regard to the Hyksos current       during the Byzantine epoch; we cannot, therefore, allow it       to influence us. We must wait before expressing a definite       opinion in regard to the facts which Glaser believes he has       obtained from the Minoan inscriptions which date from the       time of the Hyksos.         ** Mariette, who was the first to describe these curious       monuments, recognised in them all the incontestable       characteristics of a Semitic type, and the correctness of       his view was, at first, universally admitted. Later on Hamy       imagined that he could distinguish traces of Mongolian       influences, and Er. Lenormant, and then Mariette himself       came round to this view; it has recently been supported in       England by Flower, and in Germany by Virchow.    This theory was abandoned, however, when it was ascertained that the  sphinxes of San had been carved, many centuries before the invasion, for  Amenemhait III., a king of the XIIth dynasty. In spite of the facts we  possess, the problem therefore still remains unsolved, and the origin of  the Hyksos is as mysterious as ever. We gather, however, that the third  millennium before our era was repeatedly disturbed by considerable  migratory movements. The expeditions far afield of Elamite and Chaldaean  princes could not have taken place without seriously perturbing the  regions over which they passed. They must have encountered by the  way many nomadic or unsettled tribes whom a slight shock would easily  displace. An impulse once given, it needed but little to accelerate  or increase the movement: a collision with one horde reacted on its  neighbours, who either displaced or carried others with them, and the  whole multitude, gathering momentum as they went, were precipitated in  the direction first given.*         * The Hyksos invasion has been regarded as a natural result       of the Elamite conquest.    A tradition, picked up by Herodotus on his travels, relates that the  Phoenicians had originally peopled the eastern and southern shores of  the Persian Gulf;* it was also said that Indathyrses, a Scythian king,  had victoriously scoured the whole of Asia, and had penetrated as far as  Egypt.** Either of these invasions may have been the cause of the Syrian  migration. In. comparison with the meagre information which has come  down to us under the form of legends, it is provoking to think how much  actual fact has been lost, a tithe of which would explain the cause  of the movement and the mode of its execution. The least improbable  hypothesis is that which attributes the appearance of the Shepherds  about the XXIIIrd century B.C., to the arrival in Naharaim of those  Khati who subsequently fought so obstinately against the armies both of  the Pharaohs and the Ninevite kings. They descended from the mountain  region in which the Halys and the Euphrates take their rise, and if the  bulk of them proceeded no further than the valleys of the Taurus and the  Amanos, some at least must have pushed forward as far as the provinces  on the western shores of the Dead Sea. The most adventurous among them,  reinforced by the Canaanites and other tribes who had joined them on  their southward course, crossed the isthmus of Suez, and finding a  people weakened by discord, experienced no difficulty in replacing the  native dynasties by their own barbarian chiefs.***         * It was to the exodus of this race, in the last analysis,       that the invasion of the shepherds may be attributed         ** A certain number of commentators are of opinion that the       wars attributed to Indathyrses have been confounded with       what Herodotus tells of the exploits of Madyes, and are       nothing more than a distorted remembrance of the great       Scythian invasion which took place in the latter half of the       VIIth century B.C.         *** At the present time, those scholars who admit the       Turanian origin of the Hyksos are of opinion that only the       nucleus of the race, the royal tribe, was composed of       Mongols, while the main body consisted of elements of all       kinds--Canaanitish, or, more generally, Semitic.

It is the palette of a scribe, now in the Berlin Museum, and       given by King Apopi II Ausirri to a scribe named Atu.    Both their name and origin were doubtless well known to the Egyptians,  but the latter nevertheless disdained to apply to them any term but that  of \"she-mau,\"* strangers, and in referring to them used the same  vague appellations which they applied to the Bedouin of the Sinaitic  peninsula,--Monatiu, the shepherds, or Satiu, the archers. They  succeeded in hiding the original name of their conquerors so thoroughly,  that in the end they themselves forgot it, and kept the secret of it  from posterity.    The remembrance of the cruelties with which the invaders sullied their  conquest lived long after them; it still stirred the anger of Manetho  after a lapse of twenty centuries.** The victors were known as the  \"Plagues\" or \"Pests,\" and every possible crime and impiety was attributed  to them.         * The term _shamamil,_ variant of _sliemau,_ is applied to       them by Queen Hatshopsitu: the same term is employed shortly       afterward by Thutmosis III., to indicate the enemies whom he       had defeated at Megiddo.         ** He speaks of them in contemptuous terms as _men of       ignoble race_. The epithet _Aiti, Iaiti, Iaditi_, was applied       to the Nubians by the writer of the inscription of Ahmosi-       si-Abina, and to the Shepherds of the Delta by the author of       the _Sallier Papyrus_. Brugsch explained it as \"the rebels,\"       or \"disturbers,\" and Goodwin translated it \"invaders\";       Chabas rendered it by \"plague-stricken,\" an interpretation       which was in closer conformity with its etymological       meaning, and Groff pointed out that the malady called Ait,       or Adit in Egyptian, is the malignant fever still frequently       to be met with at the present day in the marshy cantons of       the Delta, and furnished the proper rendering, which is \"The       Fever-stricken.\"    [Illustration: 080.jpg A HYKSOS PRISONER GUIDING THE PLOUGH, AT EL-KAB]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger.    But the brutalities attending the invasion once past, the invaders  soon lost their barbarity and became rapidly civilized. Those of them  stationed in the encampment at Avaris retained the military qualities  and characteristic energy of their race; the remainder became  assimilated to their new compatriots, and were soon recognisable merely  by their long hair, thick beard, and marked features. Their sovereigns  seemed to have realised from the first that it was more to their  interest to exploit the country than to pillage it; as, however, none of  them was competent to understand the intricacies of the treasury, they  were forced to retain the services of the majority of the scribes, who  had managed the public accounts under the native kings.* Once schooled  to the new state of affairs, they readily adopted the refinements of  civilized life.         * The same thing took place on every occasion when Egypt was       conquered by an alien race: the Persian Achaemenians and       Greeks made use of the native employes, as did "]]]
