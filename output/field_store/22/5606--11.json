The old  practice of reciting the scriptures was not discontinued but no  objection was made to preserving and reading them in written copies.  According to tradition, the Pali scriptures were committed to writing  in Ceylon during the reign of Vattagamani, that is according to the  most recent chronology about 20 B.C., and Kanishka caused to be  engraved on copper plates the commentaries composed by the council  which he summoned. In Asvaghosha[123] we find the story of a Brahman  who casually taking up a book to pass the time lights on a copy of the  Sutra of the Twelve Causes and is converted. But though the Buddhists  remained on the whole true to the old view that the important thing  was to understand and disseminate the substance of the Master's  teaching and not merely to preserve the text as if it were a sacred  formula, still we see growing up in Mahayanist works ideas about the  sanctity and efficacy of scripture which are foreign to the Pali  Canon. Many sutras (for instance the Diamond Cutter) extol themselves  as all-sufficient for salvation: the Prajna-paramita commences with a  salutation addressed not as usual to the Buddha but to the work  itself, as if it were a deity, and Hodgson states that the Buddhists  of Nepal worship their nine sacred books. Nor was the idea excluded  that certain words, especially formulae or spells called Dharani, have  in themselves a mysterious efficacy and potency.[124] Some of these  are cited and recommended in the Lotus.[125] In so far as the  repetition of sacred words or spells is regarded as an integral part  of the religious life, the doctrine has no warrant in the earlier  teaching. It obviously becomes more and more prominent in later works.  But the idea itself is old, for it is clearly the same that produced a  belief in the Brahmanic mantras, particularly the mantras of the  Atharva Veda, and early Buddhism did not reject mantras in their  proper place. Thus[126] the deities present themselves to the Buddha  and offer to teach him a formula which will protect his disciples from  the attacks of evil spirits. Hsuean Chuang even states that the council  which sat at Rajagriha after the Buddha's death compiled five  Pitakas, one of which consisted of Dharanis,[127] and it may be that  the collection of such texts was begun as early as the collection of  discourses and rules. But for many centuries there is no evidence that  they were in any way confounded with the Dharma.    The Mahayanist scriptures are so voluminous that not even the clergy  were expected to master any considerable part of them.[128] Indeed  they make no claim to be a connected whole. The theory was rather that  there were many vehicles plying on the road to salvation and many  guide books. No traveller thought of taking the whole library but only  a few volumes which suited him. Most of the Chinese and Japanese sects  avowedly base themselves upon three sutras, selected according to the  taste of each school from the hundreds quoted in catalogues. Thus the  T'ien-t'ai sect has for its scriptures the Lotus, the Nirvana-sutra  and the Prajna-paramita, while the Shin-shu sect admits only the three  Amidist sutras.    The following are the names of some of the principal Mahayanist  scriptures. Comparatively few of them have been published in Europe  and some exist only in Chinese or Japanese translations.    1. Prajna-paramita or transcendental knowledge[129] is a generic name  given to a whole literature consisting of treatises on the doctrine of  sunyata, which vary greatly in length. They are classed as sutras,  being described as discourses delivered by the Buddha on the Vulture  Peak. At least ten are known, besides excerpts which are sometimes  described as substantive works. The great collection translated into  Chinese by Hsuean Chuang is said to consist of 200,000 verses and to  comprise sixteen different sutras.[130] The earliest translation of  one of these treatises into Chinese (Nanjio, 5) was made about 170  A.D. and everything indicates that portions of the Prajna-paramita are  among the earliest Mahayanist works and date from about the first  century of our era. Prajna not only means knowledge of the absolute  truth, that is to say of sunyata or the void, but is regarded as an  ontological principle synonymous with Bodhi and Dharma-kaya. Thus  Buddhas not only possess this knowledge in the ordinary sense but they  _are_ the knowledge manifest in human form, and Prajna is often  personified as a goddess. All these works lay great stress on the  doctrine of sunyata, and the non-existence of the world of experience.  The longest recension is said to contain a polemic against the  Hinayana.    The Diamond Cutter is one of the best known of these transcendental  treatises and the two short works called Heart of the Prajna-paramita,  which are widely read in Japan, appear to be brief abstracts of the  essence of this teaching.    2. The Saddharma-Pundarika, or Lotus of the Good Law,[131] is one of  the best known Mahayanist sutras and is highly esteemed in China and  Japan. It purports to be a discourse delivered by Sakyamuni on the  Vulture Peak to an assemblage of Bodhisattvas. The Lotus clearly  affirms the multiplicity of vehicles, or various ways of teaching the  law, and also the eternity of the Buddha, but it does not emphasize,  although it mentions, the doctrine of sunyata. The work consists of  two parts of which the second (chaps. XXI-XXVI) is a later addition.  This second part contains spells and many mythological narratives,  including one of an ancient Bodhisattva who burnt himself alive in  honour of a former Buddha. Portions of the Lotus were translated into  Chinese under the Western Tsin Dynasty 265-316 A.D. and it is quoted  in the Maha-prajna-paramita-sastra ascribed to Nagarjuna.[132] The  first part is probably not later than the first century A.D. The Lotus  is unfortunately accessible to English readers only in a most unpoetic  translation by the late Professor Kern, but it is a great religious  poem which starting from humanity regards religion as cosmic and  universal, rather than something mainly concerned with our earth. The  discourses of Sakyamuni are accompanied in it by stupendous miracles  culminating in a grand cosmic phantasmagoria in which is evoked the  stupa containing the body of a departed Buddha, that is a shrine  containing the eternal truth.    3. The Lalita-vistara[133] is a life of Sakyamuni up to the  commencement of his mission. Though the setting of the story is  miraculous and Buddhas and Bodhisattvas innumerable are freely spoken  of, yet the work does not enunciate the characteristic Mahayanist  doctrines so definitely as the other treatises here enumerated. It is  said to have originally belonged to the school of the Sarvastivadins  and to have been subsequently accepted by the Mahayanists, and though  it is not an epic but a collection of ballads and legends, yet it  often reads as if it were a preliminary study for Asvaghosha's  Buddhacarita. It contains Sanskrit versions of old legends, which are  almost verbal renderings of the Pali text, but also new material and  seems to be conscious of relating novelties which may arouse  scepticism for it interrupts the narrative to anathematize those who  do not believe in the miracles of the Nativity and to extol the merits  of faith (_sraddha_ not _bhakti_). It is probably coeval with the  earlier Gandharan art but there are no facts to fix its date.[134]    4. The Lankavatara[135] gives an account of the revelation of the good  Law by Sakyamuni when visiting Lanka. It is presumably subsequent to  the period when Ceylon had become a centre of Buddhism, but the story  is pure fancy and unconnected with history or with older legends. It  relates how the Buddha alighted on Mt. Malaya in Lanka. Ravana came to  pay his respects and asked for definitions of virtue and vice which  were given. The Bodhisattva Mahamati (apparently Manjusri) proceeded  to propound a series of more abstruse questions which are answered at  considerable length. The Lankavatara represents a mature phase of  speculation and not only criticizes the Sankhya, Pasupata and other  Hindu schools, but is conscious of the growing resemblance of  Mahayanism to Brahmanic philosophy and tries to explain it. It  contains a prophecy about Nagarjuna and another which mentions the  Guptas, and it appears to allude to the domination of the Huns. This  allusion would make its date as late as the sixth century but a  translation into Chinese which is said to correspond with the Sanskrit  text was made in 513. If so the barbarians referred to cannot be the  Huns. An earlier translation made in 443 does not agree with our  Sanskrit text and perhaps the work existed in several recensions.    5. The Suvarna-prabhasa or Glitter of Gold[136] is a Vaipulya sutra  in many ways resembling the Lotus. It insists on the supernatural  character of the Buddha. He was never really born nor entered into  Nirvana but is the Dharma-kaya. The scene is laid at Rajagriha and  many Brahmanic deities are among the interlocutors. It was translated  into Chinese about 420 A.D. and fragments of a translation into Uigur  have been discovered in Turkestan.[137] The contents comprise  philosophy, legends and spells.    6. Ganda-vyuha[138] or the Structure of the World, which is compared  to a bubble. The name is not found in the catalogue of the Chinese  Tripitaka but the work is said to be the same as the Avatamsaka sutra  which is popular in the Far East under the name of Hua-yen in China or  Ke-gon in Japan. The identity of the two books could not have been  guessed from the extracts and analyses which have been published but  is guaranteed by high authorities.[139] It is possible however that  the Ganda-vyuha is only a portion of the larger work"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1658"],[0,"Phaedo (#13)"],[1," more  unjust.    Of course.    And is this true of all opposites? and are we convinced that all of them  are generated out of opposites?    Yes.    And in this universal opposition of all things, are there not also two  intermediate processes which are ever going on, from one to the other  opposite, and back again; where there is a greater and a less there is  also an intermediate process of increase and diminution, and that which  grows is said to wax, and that which decays to wane?    Yes, he said.    And there are many other processes, such as division and composition,  cooling and heating, which equally involve a passage into and out of one  another. And this necessarily holds of all opposites, even though not  always expressed in words--they are really generated out of one another,  and there is a passing or process from one to the other of them?    Very true, he replied.    Well, and is there not an opposite of life, as sleep is the opposite of  waking?    True, he said.    And what is it?    Death, he answered.    And these, if they are opposites, are generated the one from the other,  and have there their two intermediate processes also?    Of course.    Now, said Socrates, I will analyze one of the two pairs of opposites  which I have mentioned to you, and also its intermediate processes, and  you shall analyze the other to me. One of them I term sleep, the other  waking. The state of sleep is opposed to the state of waking, and out  of sleeping waking is generated, and out of waking, sleeping; and the  process of generation is in the one case falling asleep, and in the  other waking up. Do you agree?    I entirely agree.    Then, suppose that you analyze life and death to me in the same manner.  Is not death opposed to life?    Yes.    And they are generated one from the other?    Yes.    What is generated from the living?    The dead.    And what from the dead?    I can only say in answer--the living.    Then the living, whether things or persons, Cebes, are generated from  the dead?    That is clear, he replied.    Then the inference is that our souls exist in the world below?    That is true.    And one of the two processes or generations is visible--for surely the  act of dying is visible?    Surely, he said.    What then is to be the result? Shall we exclude the opposite process?  And shall we suppose nature to walk on one leg only? Must we not rather  assign to death some corresponding process of generation?    Certainly, he replied.    And what is that process?    Return to life.    And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead  into the world of the living?    Quite true.    Then here is a new way by which we arrive at the conclusion that the  living come from the dead, just as the dead come from the living; and  this, if true, affords a most certain proof that the souls of the dead  exist in some place out of which they come again.    Yes, Socrates, he said; the conclusion seems to flow necessarily out of  our previous admissions.    And that these admissions were not unfair, Cebes, he said, may be shown,  I think, as follows: If generation were in a straight line only, and  there were no compensation or circle in nature, no turn or return of  elements into their opposites, then you know that all things would at  last have the same form and pass into the same state, and there would be  no more generation of them.    What do you mean? he said.    A simple thing enough, which I will illustrate by the case of sleep,  he replied. You know that if there were no alternation of sleeping  and waking, the tale of the sleeping Endymion would in the end have no  meaning, because all other things would be asleep, too, and he would not  be distinguishable from the rest. Or if there were composition only,  and no division of substances, then the chaos of Anaxagoras would come  again. And in like manner, my dear Cebes, if all things which partook  of life were to die, and after they were dead remained in the form  of death, and did not come to life again, all would at last die, and  nothing would be alive--what other result could there be? For if the  living spring from any other things, and they too die, must not all  things at last be swallowed up in death? (But compare Republic.)    There is no escape, Socrates, said Cebes; and to me your argument seems  to be absolutely true.    Yes, he said, Cebes, it is and must be so, in my opinion; and we have  not been deluded in making these admissions; but I am confident that  there truly is such a thing as living again, and that the living spring  from the dead, and that the souls of the dead are in existence, and that  the good souls have a better portion than the evil.    Cebes added: Your favorite doctrine, Socrates, that knowledge is simply  recollection, if true, also necessarily implies a previous time in  which we have learned that which we now recollect. But this would be  impossible unless our soul had been in some place before existing in the  form of man; here then is another proof of the soul's immortality.    But tell me, Cebes, said Simmias, interposing, what arguments are urged  in favour of this doctrine of recollection. I am not very sure at the  moment that I remember them.    One excellent proof, said Cebes, is afforded by questions. If you put  a question to a person in a right way, he will give a true answer of  himself, but how could he do this unless there were knowledge and right  reason already in him? And this is most clearly shown when he is taken  to a diagram or to anything of that sort. (Compare Meno.)    But if, said Socrates, you are still incredulous, Simmias, I would ask  you whether you may not agree with me when you look at the matter  in another way;--I mean, if you are still incredulous as to whether  knowledge is recollection.    Incredulous, I am not, said Simmias; but I want to have this doctrine  of recollection brought to my own recollection, and, from what Cebes has  said, I am beginning to recollect and be convinced; but I should still  like to hear what you were going to say.    This is what I would say, he replied:--We should agree, if I am not  mistaken, that what a man recollects he must have known at some previous  time.    Very true.    And what is the nature of this knowledge or recollection? I mean to  ask, Whether a person who, having seen or heard or in any way perceived  anything, knows not only that, but has a conception of something  else which is the subject, not of the same but of some other kind of  knowledge, may not be fairly said to recollect that of which he has the  conception?    What do you mean?    I mean what I may illustrate by the following instance:--The knowledge  of a lyre is not the same as the knowledge of a man?    True.    And yet what is the feeling of lovers when they recognize a lyre, or  a garment, or anything else which the beloved has been in the habit of  using? Do not they, from knowing the lyre, form in the mind's eye an  image of the youth to whom the lyre belongs? And this is recollection.  In like manner any one who sees Simmias may remember Cebes; and there  are endless examples of the same thing.    Endless, indeed, replied Simmias.    And recollection is most commonly a process of recovering that which has  been already forgotten through time and inattention.    Very true, he said.    Well; and may you not also from seeing the picture of a horse or a  lyre remember a man? and from the picture of Simmias, you may be led to  remember Cebes?    True.    Or you may also be led to the recollection of Simmias himself?    Quite so.    And in all these cases, the recollection may be derived from things  either like or unlike?    It may be.    And when the recollection is derived from like things, then another  consideration is sure to arise, which is--whether the likeness in any  degree falls short or not of that which is recollected?    Very true, he said.    And shall we proceed a step further, and affirm that there is such a  thing as equality, not of one piece of wood or stone with another, but  that, over and above this, there is absolute equality? Shall we say so?    Say so, yes, replied Simmias, and swear to it, with all the confidence  in life.    And do we know the nature of this absolute essence?    To be sure, he said.    And whence did we obtain our knowledge? Did we not see equalities of  material things, such as pieces of wood and stones, and gather from  them the idea of an equality which is different from them? For you will  acknowledge that there is a difference. Or look at the matter in another  way:--Do not the same pieces of wood or stone appear at one time equal,  and at another time unequal?    That is certain.    But are real equals ever unequal? or is the idea of equality the same as  of inequality?    Impossible, Socrates.    Then these (so-called) equals are not the same with the idea of  equality?    I should say, clearly not, Socrates.    And yet from these equals, although differing from the idea of equality,  you conceived and attained that idea?    Very true, he said.    Which might be like, or might be unlike them?    Yes.    But that makes no difference; whenever from seeing one thing you  conceived another, whether like or unlike, there must surely have been  an act of recollection?    Very true.    But what would you say of equal portions of wood and stone, or other  material equals? and what is the impression produced by them? Are they  equals in the same sense in which absolute equality is equal? or do they  fall short of this perfect equality in a measure?    Yes, he said, in a very great measure too.    And must we not allow, that when I or any one, looking at any object,  observes that the thing which he sees aims at being some other thing,  but falls short of, and cannot be, that other thing, but is inferior, he  who makes this observation must have had a previous knowledge of that to  which the other,"]]]
