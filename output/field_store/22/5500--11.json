Almost at the beginning he was rewarded by the discovery, or  re-discovery, of Madeira in 1420, by Joao Gonsalvez Zarco, one of  the squires of his household. For some time he was content with  occupying this and the neighbouring island of Porto Santo, which,  however, was ruined by the rabbits let loose upon it. On Madeira  vines from Burgundy were planted, and to this day form the chief  industry of the island. In 1435 Cape Bojador was passed, and in  1441 Cape Branco discovered. Two years later Cape Verde was reached  and passed by Nuno Tristao, and for the first time there were signs  that the African coast trended eastward. By this time Prince Henry's  men had become familiar with the natives along the shore and no less  than one thousand of them had been brought back and distributed  among the Portuguese nobles as pages and attendants. In 1455 a  Venetian, named Alvez Cadamosto, undertook a voyage still farther  south for purposes of trade, the Prince supplying the capital, and  covenanting for half profits on results. They reached the mouth  of the Gambia, but found the natives hostile. Here for the first  time European navigators lost sight of the pole-star and saw the  brilliant constellation of the Southern Cross. The last discovery  made during Prince Henry's life was that of the Cape Verde Islands,  by one of his captains, Diogo Gomez, in 1460--the very year of his  death. As the successive discoveries were made, they were jotted  down by the Prince's cartographers on portulanos, and just before  his death the King of Portugal sent to a Venetian monk, Fra Mauro,  details of all discoveries up to that time, to be recorded on a  _mappa mundi_, a copy of which still exists (p. 77).    The impulse thus given by Prince Henry's patient investigation of  the African coast continued long after his death. In 1471 Fernando  de Poo discovered the island which now bears his name, while in  the same year Pedro d'Escobar crossed the equator. Wherever the  Portuguese investigators landed they left marks of their presence,  at first by erecting crosses, then by carving on trees Prince Henry's  motto, \"Talent de bien faire,\" and finally they adopted the method  of erecting stone pillars, surmounted by a cross, and inscribed  with the king's arms and name. These pillars were called _padraos_.  In 1484, Diego Cam, a knight of the king's household, set up one  of these pillars at the mouth of a large river, which he therefore  called the Rio do Padrao; it was called by the natives the Zaire, and  is now known as the River Congo. Diego Cam was, on this expedition,  accompanied by Martin Behaim of Nuernberg, whose globe is celebrated  in geographical history as the last record of the older views (p.  115).    Meanwhile, from one of the envoys of the native kings who visited  the Portuguese Court, information was received that far to the east  of the countries hitherto discovered there was a great Christian  king. This brought to mind the mediaeval tradition of Prester John,  and accordingly the Portuguese determined to make a double attempt,  both by sea and by land, to reach this monarch. By sea the king  sent two vessels under the command of Bartholomew Diaz, while by  land he despatched, in the following year, two men acquainted with  Arabic, Pedro di Covilham and Affonso de Payba. Covilham reached  Aden, and there took ship for Calicut, being the first Portuguese  to sail the Indian Ocean. He then returned to Sofala, and obtained  news of the Island of the Moon, now known as Madagascar. With this  information he returned to Cairo, where he found ambassadors from  Joao, two Jews, Abraham of Beja and Joseph of Lamejo. These he  sent back with the information that ships that sailed down the  coast of Guinea would surely reach the end of Africa, and when  they arrived in the Eastern Ocean they should ask for Sofala and  the Island of the Moon. Meanwhile Covilham returned to the Red  Sea, and made his way into Abyssinia, where he married and settled  down, transmitting from time to time information to Portugal which  gave Europeans their first notions of Abyssinia.    The voyage by land in search of Prester John had thus been completely  successful, while, at the same time, information had been obtained  giving certain hopes of the voyage by sea. This had, in its way,  been almost as successful, for Diaz had rounded the cape now known  as the Cape of Good Hope, but to which he proposed giving the title  of Cabo Tormentoso, or \"Stormy Cape.\" King Joao, however, recognising  that Diaz's voyage had put the seal upon the expectations with  which Prince Henry had, seventy years before, started his series  of explorations, gave it the more auspicious name by which it is  now known.    For some reason which has not been adequately explained, no further  attempt was made for nearly ten years to carry out the final  consummation of Prince Henry's plan by sending out another expedition.  In the meantime, as we shall see, Columbus had left Portugal, after  a mean attempt had been made by the king to carry out his novel  plan of reaching India without his aid; and, as a just result,  the discovery of a western voyage to the Indies (as it was then  thought) had been successfully accomplished by Columbus, in the  service of the Catholic monarchs of Spain, in 1492. This would  naturally give pause to any attempt at reaching India by the more  cumbersome route of coasting along Africa, which had turned out  to be a longer process than Prince Henry had thought. Three years  after Columbus's discovery King Joao died, and his son and successor  Emmanuel did not take up the traditional Portuguese method of reaching  India till the third year of his reign.    By this time it had become clear, from Columbus's second voyage,  that there were more difficulties in the way of reaching the Indies  by his method than had been thought; and the year after his return  from his second voyage in 1496, King Emmanuel determined on once  more taking up the older method. He commissioned Vasco da Gama,  a gentleman of his court, to attempt the eastward route to India  with three vessels, carrying in all about sixty men. Already by this  time Columbus's bold venture into the unknown seas had encouraged  similar boldness in others, and instead of coasting down the whole  extent of the western coast of Africa, Da Gama steered direct for  Cape Verde Islands, and thence out into the ocean, till he reached  the Bay of St. Helena, a little to the north of the Cape of Good  Hope.    For a time he was baffled in his attempt to round the Cape by the  strong south-easterly winds, which blow there continually during  the summer season; but at last he commenced coasting along the  eastern shores of Africa, and at every suitable spot he landed  some of his sailors to make inquiries about Covilham and the court  of Prester John. But in every case he found the ports inhabited  by fanatical Moors, who, as soon as they discovered that their  visitors were Christians, attempted to destroy them, and refused  to supply them with pilots for the further voyage to India. This  happened at Mozambique, at Quiloa, and at Mombasa, and it was not  till he arrived at Melinda that he was enabled to obtain provisions  and a pilot, Malemo Cana, an Indian of Guzerat, who was quite familiar  with the voyage to Calicut. Under his guidance Gama's fleet went  from Melinda to Calicut in twenty-three days. Here the Zamorin, or  sea-king, displayed the same antipathy to his Christian visitors.  The Mohammedan traders of the place recognised at once the dangerous  rivalry which the visit of the Portuguese implied, with their monopoly  of the Eastern trade, and represented Gama and his followers as  merely pirates. Vasco, however, by his firm behaviour, managed  to evade the machinations of his trade rivals, and induced the  Zamorin to regard favourably an alliance with the Portuguese king.  Contenting himself with this result, he embarked again, and after  visiting Melinda, the only friendly spot he had found on the east  coast of Africa, he returned to Lisbon in September 1499, having  spent no less than two years on the voyage. King Emmanuel received  him with great favour, and appointed him Admiral of the Indies.    The significance of Vasco da Gama's voyage was at once seen by  the persons whose trade monopoly it threatened--the Venetians,  and the Sultan of Egypt. Priuli, the Venetian chronicler, reports:  \"When this news reached Venice the whole city felt it greatly,  and remained stupefied, and the wisest held it as the worst news  that had ever arrived\"--as indeed they might, for it prophesied the  downfall of the Venetian Empire. The Sultan of Egypt was equally  moved, for the greatest source of his riches was derived from the  duty of five per cent. which he levied on all merchandise entering  his dominions, and ten per cent. upon all goods exported from them.  Hitherto there had been all manner of bickerings between Venice and  Egypt, but this common danger brought them together. The Sultan  represented to Venice the need of common action in order to drive  away the new commerce; but Egypt was without a navy, and had indeed  no wood suitable for shipbuilding. The Venetians took the trouble  to transmit wood to Cairo, which was then carried by camels to  Suez, where a small fleet was prepared to attack the Portuguese  on their next visit to the Indian Ocean.    The Portuguese had in the meantime followed up Vasco da Gama's voyage  with another attempt, which was, in its way, even more important. In  1500 the king sent no less than thirteen ships under the command  of Pedro Alvarez Cabral, with Franciscans to convert, and twelve  hundred fighting men to overawe, the Moslems of the Indian Ocean.  He determined on steering even a more westerly course than Vasco da  Gama, and when he arrived in 17 deg. south of the line, he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],[0,"The Complete Book of Cheese (#13)"],[1,"frying pan, stir in a few spoonfuls of beer and a       bit of prepared mustard. When smoothly melted, pour over the       piping-hot, beer-soaked toast.          [Illustration]    _Chapter Six_    The Fondue      There is a conspiracy among the dictionary makers to take the heart  out of the Fondue. Webster makes it seem no better than a collapsed  souffle, with his definition:         Fondue. Also, erroneously, _fondu_. A dish made of melted       cheese, butter, eggs, and, often, milk and bread crumbs.    Thorndike-Barnhart further demotes this dish, that for centuries has  been one of the world's greatest, to \"a combination of melted cheese,  eggs and butter\" and explains that the name comes from the French  _fondre_, meaning melt. The latest snub is delivered by the up-to-date  _Cook's Quiz_ compiled by TV culinary experts:         A baked dish with eggs, cheese, butter, milk and bread crumbs.    A baked dish, indeed! Yet the Fondue has added to the gaiety and  inebriety of nations, if not of dictionaries. It has commanded the  respect of the culinary great. Savarin, Boulestin, Andre Simon, all  have hailed its heavenly consistency, all have been regaled with its  creamy, nay velvety, smoothness.    A touch of garlic, a dash of kirsch, fresh ground black pepper,  nutmeg, black pearl truffles of Bugey, red cayenne pepper, the  luscious gravy of roast turkey--such little matters help to make an  authentic dunking Fondue, not a baked Fondue, mind you. Jean-Anthelme  Brillat-Savarin a century and a half ago brought the original  \"receipt\" with him and spread it around with characteristic generosity  during the two years of his exile in New York after the French  Revolution. In his monumental _Physiologie du Gout_ he records an  incident that occurred in 1795:         Whilst passing through Boston ... I taught the restaurant-keeper       Julien to make a _Fondue_, or eggs cooked with cheese. This dish,       a novelty to the Americans, became so much the rage, that he       (Julien) felt himself obliged, by way of thanks, to send me to       New York the rump of one of those pretty little roebucks that are       brought from Canada in winter, and which was declared exquisite       by the chosen committee whom I convoked for the occasion.    As the great French gourmet, Savarin was born on the Swiss border (at  Belley, in the fertile Province of Bugey, where Gertrude Stein later  had a summer home), he no doubt ate Gruyere three times a day, as is  the custom in Switzerland and adjacent parts. He sets down the recipe  just as he got it from its Swiss source, the papers of Monsieur  Trolliet, in the neighboring Canton of Berne:         Take as many eggs as you wish to use, according to the number of       your guests. Then take a lump of good Gruyere cheese, weighing       about a third of the eggs, and a nut of butter about half the       weight of the cheese. (Since today's eggs in America weigh about       1-1/2 ounces apiece, if you start the Fondue with 8. your lump       of good Gruyere would come to 1/4 pound and your butter to 1/8       pound.)         Break and beat the eggs well in a flat pan, then add the butter       and the cheese, grated or cut in small pieces.         Place the pan on a good fire and stir with a wooden spoon until       the mixture is fairly thick and soft; put in a little or no salt,       according to the age of the cheese, and a good deal of pepper,       for this is one of the special attributes of this ancient dish.         Let it be placed on the table in a hot dish, and if some of the       best wines be produced, and the bottle passed quite freely, a       marvelous effect will be beheld.    This has long been quoted as the proper way to make the national dish  of Switzerland. Savarin tells of hearing oldsters in his district  laugh over the Bishop of Belley eating his Fondue with a spoon instead  of the traditional fork, in the first decade of the 1700's. He tells,  too, of a Fondue party he threw for a couple of his septuagenarian  cousins in Paris \"about the year 1801.\"    The party was the result of much friendly taunting of the master: \"By  Jove, Jean, you have been bragging for such a long time about your  Fondues, you have continually made our mouths water. It is high time  to put a stop to all this. We will come and breakfast with you some  day and see what sort of thing this dish is.\"    Savarin invited them for ten o'clock next day, started them off with  the table laid on a \"snow white cloth, and in each one's place two  dozen oysters with a bright golden lemon. At each end of the table  stood a bottle of sauterne, carefully wiped, excepting the cork, which  showed distinctly that it had been in the cellar for a long while....  After the oysters, which were quite fresh, came some broiled kidneys,  a _terrine_ of _foie gras_, a pie with truffles, and finally the  Fondue. The different ingredients had all been assembled in a stewpan,  which was placed on the table over a chafing dish, heated with spirits  of wine.    \"Then,\" Savarin is quoted, \"I commenced operations on the field of  battle, and my cousins did not lose a single one of my movements.  They were loud in the praise of this preparation, and asked me to let  them have the receipt, which I promised them....\"    This Fondue breakfast party that gave the nineteenth century such a  good start was polished off with \"fruits in season and sweets, a cup  of genuine mocha, ... and finally two sorts of liqueurs, one a spirit  for cleansing, and the other an oil for softening.\"    This primitive Swiss Cheese Fondue is now prepared more elaborately in  what is called:       Neufchatel Style    2-1/2 cups grated imported Swiss  1-1/2 tablespoons flour  1 clove of garlic  1 cup dry white wine  Crusty French \"flute\" or hard rolls cut into big mouthfuls, handy      for dunking  1 jigger kirsch  Salt  Pepper  Nutmeg         The cheese should be shredded or grated coarsely and mixed well       with the flour. Use a chafing dish for cooking and a small heated       casserole for serving. Hub the bottom and sides of the blazer       well with garlic, pour in the wine and heat to bubbling, just       under boiling. Add cheese slowly, half a cup at a time, and stir       steadily in one direction only, as in making Welsh Rabbit. Use a       silver fork. Season with very little salt, always depending on       how salty the cheese is, but use plenty of black pepper, freshly       ground, and a touch of nutmeg. Then pour in the kirsch, stir       steadily and invite guests to dunk their forked bread in the dish       or in a smaller preheated casserole over a low electric or       alcohol burner on the dining table. The trick is to keep the       bubbling melted cheese in rhythmic motion with the fork, both up       and down and around and around.    The dunkers stab the hunks of crusty French bread through the soft  part to secure a firm hold in the crust, for if your bread comes off  in dunking you pay a forfeit, often a bottle of wine.    The dunking is done as rhythmically as the stirring, guests taking  regular turns at twirling the fork to keep the cheese swirling. When  this \"chafing dish cheese custard,\" as it has been called in England,  is ready for eating, each in turn thrusts in his fork, sops up a  mouthful with the bread for a sponge and gives the Fondue a final  stir, to keep it always moving in the same direction. All the while  the heat beneath the dish keeps it gently bubbling.    Such a Neufchatel party was a favorite of King Edward VII, especially  when he was stepping out as the Prince of Wales. He was as fond of  Fondue as most of the great gourmets of his day and preferred it to  Welsh Rabbit, perhaps because of the wine and kirsch that went into  it.    At such a party a little heated wine is added if the Fondue gets too  thick. When finally it has cooked down to a crust in the bottom of the  dish, this is forked out by the host and divided among the guests as a  very special dividend.    Any dry white wine will serve in a pinch, and the Switzerland Cheese  Association, in broadcasting this classical recipe, points out that  any dry rum, slivovitz, or brandy, including applejack, will be a  valid substitute for the kirsch. To us, applejack seems specially  suited, when we stop to consider our native taste that has married  apple pie to cheese since pioneer times.    In culinary usage fondue means \"melting to an edible consistency\" and  this, of course, doesn't refer to cheese alone, although we use it  chiefly for that.    In France Fondue is also the common name for a simple dish of eggs  scrambled with grated cheese and butter and served very hot on toasted  bread, or filled into fancy paper cases, quickly browned on top and  served at once. The reason for this is that all baked Fondues fall as  easily and as far as Souffles, although the latter are more noted for  this failing. There is a similarity in the soft fluffiness of both,  although the Fondues are always more moist. For there is a stiff,  stuffed-shirt buildup around any Souffle, suggesting a dressy dinner,  while Fondue started as a self-service dunking bowl.    Our modern tendency is to try to make over the original French Fondue  on the Welsh Rabbit model--to turn it into a sort of French Rabbit.  Although we know that both Gruyere and Emmentaler are what we call  Swiss and that it is impossible in America to duplicate the rich  Alpine flavor given by the mountain herbs, we are inclined to try all  sorts of domestic cheeses and mixtures thereof. But it's best to stick  to Savarin's \"lump of Gruyere\" just as the neighboring French and  Italians do. It is interesting to note that this Swiss Alpine cooking  has become so international that it is credited to Italy in the  following description we reprint from _When Madame Cooks_, by an  Englishman, Eric Weir:       Fondue a l'Italienne         This is one of those egg dishes that makes"]]]
