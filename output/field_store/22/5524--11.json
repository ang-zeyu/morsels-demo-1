[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14760"],[0,"Report of the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents (#13)"],[1,"next development of consequence in the law on this matter was in the  Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 (England). This statute, which was  subsequently followed in New Zealand, made it a criminal offence to have  carnal knowledge of girls. The penalties were graded according to the  ages of the girls involved.    As an indication of the seriousness with which the law, by successive  stages, has regarded sexual offences it is convenient here to summarize  the penalties set out in sections 212 _et seq._ of the Crimes Act  (N.Z.).    Rape                                      Imprisonment for life.  Attempted rape                            Imprisonment for 10 years.  Carnal knowledge of girl under 10         Imprisonment for life.  Carnal knowledge of girl 10 to 11 years   Imprisonment for 10 years.  Attempted carnal knowledge of girl    under 12 years                          Imprisonment for 7 years.  Carnal knowledge of girl 12 to 16 years   Imprisonment for 5 years.  Indecent assault on female                Imprisonment for 7 years.    The above are the maximum penalties. The modern tendency is to inflict  much lesser punishment upon an offender, to grade the punishment having  regard to such matters as the damage done, the past history of the  offender, and the prospect of reform.      =(3) Consent as a Defence=    The consent of a girl under 12 years of age cannot be raised as a  defence to any defilement charge.    But where the girl is over 12 and under 16 her consent may be raised as  a defence if:      (_a_) The girl is older than or of the same age as the person    charged; or      (_b_) It is made to appear to the jury that the accused is under    the age of 21 and had reasonable cause to believe that the girl    was of or over the age of 16 years.    The law on this point is not uniform throughout the Commonwealth. In  Victoria the defence of consent is available only when the girl is older  than, or of the same age as, the accused (_vide_ Crimes Act 1928, Vict.  3664, sec. 45). The Committee has been officially informed that this law  (most rigid when compared with the defence of consent available in this  Dominion) has been working well since it was first enacted about fifty  years ago.    In England the defence of consent is available to any accused under the  age of 23 years, but only on the first occasion on which he is charged  with the offence.    In an English case, _R._ v. _Banks_, (1916) 2 K.B. 621, this defence of  consent was raised by a man who said that he had no idea that the girl  was under the age of 16 and that he did not think about her age at all,  but that she had the appearance of a girl of 16. The Court of Criminal  Appeal held that he was properly convicted. On the other hand, the Court  of Appeal in New Zealand in _R._ v. _Perry and Pledger_, (1920) N.Z.L.R.  21 (despite the argument of the Solicitor-General to the contrary),  decided that, if in the eyes of the jury the girl might well be taken by  an ordinary person to be of the age of 16, that would be evidence (not  necessarily proof) of a reasonable cause for the belief that she was of  that age. Hence it comes about that under our law it is not necessary  for an accused person to go into the witness box or to call any evidence  to show that the girl appeared to him to be over the age of consent. The  nature of her clothing, red on her lips, the fact that she is said to  smoke and drink, and evidence on other similar matters, enable a verdict  of acquittal to be given.      =(4) Weaknesses in the Law=    _(a) Operation of the Rule Regarding Age of Consent_    The readiness of juries to acquit in cases of carnal knowledge of, or  indecent assault upon, girls may be due to several facts, of which the  following may be mentioned:      (i) The failure of the law to make it an offence for a    sophisticated girl to entice a male into carnal knowledge of her.      (ii) The modern practice of not publishing the names of the girls    involved.      (iii) The fact that the defence of consent is available to persons    under 21 years of age is a factor making it more difficult to    obtain a conviction when the person charged is over 21 years.      _(b) Girls Not Liable for Permitting Indecency or Carnal Knowledge_    The law has always been chivalrous to females. It is not an offence for  them to allow to be done to themselves things which, when they are done,  render the other party liable to heavy terms of imprisonment.    There is also a practical reason why the State has not legislated  against females on this point, viz., the anticipated difficulty of  obtaining convictions if the female, when called as a witness, is able  to plead that she should not be required to testify lest by doing so she  might incriminate herself. This practical objection, however, would lose  all force, both as regards cases where the accused are under 21 years  and those in which they are over 21 years, if the proposed offence by  females were restricted to girls under 16 and thus triable in the  Children's Court, and not by indictment. The judicial process in the  Children's Court is, or can be, such a speedy process that the Crown  would not be hampered in making its charge against the male in the  ordinary Criminal Court by the possibility that the case would fail if  the girl pleaded that she should not be required to answer questions.      _(c) Girls Not Liable for \"Indecent Assault\" on Boys_    It should also be made an offence punishable in the Children's Court for  any girl to indecently assault a male.    Under section 208 of the Crimes Act every person, male or female  (including a boy under 14 years of age), may be convicted and sentenced  to seven years imprisonment for an indecent assault on a female. Under  section 154 a male may be sentenced to ten years imprisonment for an  indecent assault on a male (consent is not a a defence); but a female  cannot be convicted of \"indecent assault\" on a male if he permitted the  act.    This anomaly may have arisen because, in ancient times and, later, when  the criminal law was set out in statutory form, it was not considered  likely that females would descend to conduct which would entice males  into the commission of one of these offences.    Having regard to the evidence before the Committee that many boys have  been tempted and encouraged into sexual crime by the indecent conduct of  girls themselves, in picture theatres and elsewhere, the time has  arrived when boys should be protected by letting the girls know that  they too commit an offence when they act towards boys in an indecent  manner.      =(5) Proposed Reforms=      (_a_) It should be made an offence punishable in the Children's Court  for a girl whose age is under 16 years to permit a person to have carnal  knowledge of her or to handle her indecently.    (_b_) It should also be made an offence punishable in the Children's  Court for any girl to indecently assault a male.    (_c_) Consideration should also be given to the desirability of amending  sections 208 and 216 of the Crimes Act and section 203 of the Justices  of the Peace Act. There are three courses which might be followed:      First, to allow the law to remain as it is.      Secondly, to strike out the proviso which permits this defence of    consent to be raised in cases where the accused is under 21 years    and older than the girl.      Thirdly, to alter the wording of the provision regarding age of    consent  from--        \" ... it is made to appear ... that the accused was under 21 and      had reasonable cause to believe that the girl was of or over the      age of 16.\"      to--        \" ... if the accused (being a person under the age of 21 years)      took all reasonable steps to ascertain that the girl was of or      over the age of 16 years and did as a result thereof believe      that she was of or over the age of 16 years.\"    Any legislation such as is suggested in this subheading would involve an  amendment of the Crimes Act and not merely an amendment of the Child  Welfare Act. The Committee therefore suggests to the Government that  further information be obtained as to how the law regarding \"age of  consent\" is operating in other jurisdictions and that the information so  obtained be submitted to the Law Revision Committee for its  consideration.          _XVI. Child Welfare in New Zealand_      =(1) History of Legislation=    In order the better to understand the limits and extent of the powers  under the Child Welfare Act, and how these powers are capable of  improvement and extension, it is desirable to set out briefly the  history of the law pertaining to institutions and homes established in  New Zealand for children in need of care or correction.    The first provisions were contained in the _Neglected and Criminal  Children Act 1867_. This statute provided that boys and girls under  fifteen years of age could be committed to industrial schools or  reformatories for periods up to seven years. In 1873 the Master of any  Industrial School established under the Act became _in loco parentis_ to  children of parents who, because of their criminal and dissolute habits,  were unfit to have the guardianship of their children.    In 1874 a _Naval Training Schools Act_ was passed under which boys of 10  to 14 years of age, convicted by magistrates for reasons varying from  vagrancy to bad associations, could be detained in naval training  schools or on training ships and apprenticed to the sea.    In 1882 the _Industrial Schools Act_ was passed making better provision  for the control, maintenance, education, and training of children under  the apparent age of fifteen years who were found to be destitute,  neglected, uncontrollable, living in a detrimental environment, or  associating with persons of ill repute, and also for children who had  committed offences against the law.

A look full of innocence fell  From her modest and pretty blue eye,  As she said, \"I have matches to sell,  And hope you are willing to buy.        3. \"A penny a bunch is the price,  I think you'll not find it too much;  They are tied up so even and nice,  And ready to light with a touch.\"    4.

LESSON LXVI.  THE LITTLE LOAF.  1. Once when there was a famine, a rich baker sent for  twenty of the poorest children in the town, and said to them,  \"In this basket there is a loaf for each of you. Take it, and  come back to me every day at this hour till God sends us  better times.\"  2. The hungry children gathered eagerly about the basket,  and quarreled for the bread, because each wished to have the  largest loaf. At last they went away without even thanking  the good gentleman.  3. But Gretchen, a poorly-dressed little girl, did not  quarrel or struggle with the rest,     THIRD READER.  173        but remained standing modestly in the distance. When the  ill-behaved girls had left, she took the smallest loaf, which  alone was left in the basket, kissed the gentleman's hand, and  went home.  4. The next day the children were as ill behaved as before,  and poor, timid Gretchen received a loaf scarcely half the  size of the one she got the first day. When she came home,  and her mother cut the loaf open, many new, shining pieces  of silver fell out of it.     174  ECLECTIC SERIES.  5. Her mother was very much alarmed, and said, \"Take  the money back to the good gentleman at once, for it must  have got into the dough by accident. Be quick, Gretchen! be  quick!\"  6. But when the little girl gave the rich man her mother's  message, he said, \"No, no, my child, it was no mistake. I had  the silver pieces put into the smallest loaf to reward you.  Always be as contented, peaceable, and grateful as you now  are. Go home now, and tell your mother that the money is  your own.\"      LESSON LXVII.    SUSIE AND ROVER.  1. \"Mamma,\" said Susie Dean, one summer's morning,  \"may I go to the woods, and pick berries?\"     THIRD READER.  175  2. \"Yes,\" replied Mrs. Dean, \"but you must take Rover  with you.\"  3. Susie brought her little basket, and her mother put up a  nice lunch for her. She tied down the cover, and fastened a  tin cup to it.  4. The little girl called Rover--a great Newfoundland  dog--and gave him a tin pail to carry. \"If I bring it home  full, mamma,\" she said, \"won't you make some berry  cakes for tea?\"  5. Away she tripped, singing as she went down the lane  and across the pasture. When she got to the woods, she put  her dinner basket down beside a tree, and began to pick  berries.  6. Rover ran about, chasing a squirrel or a rabbit now and  then, but never straying far from Susie.  7. The tin pail was not a very small one. By the time it  was two thirds full, Susie began to feel hungry, and thought  she would eat her lunch.  8. Rover came and took his place at her side as soon as  she began to eat. Did she not give him some of the lunch?  No, she was in a selfish mood, and did no such thing.     176  ECLECTIC SERIES.  9. \"There, Rover, run away! there's a good dog,\" she said;  but Rover staid near her, watching her steadily with his clear  brown eves.    10. The meat he wanted so much, was soon eaten up; and  all he got of the nice dinner, was a small crust of gingerbread  that Susie threw away.  11. After dinner, Susie played a while by     THIRD READER.  177  the brook. She threw sticks into the water, and Rover swam  in and brought them back. Then she began to pick berries  again.  12. She did not enjoy the afternoon as she did the  morning. The sunshine was as bright, the berries were as  sweet and plentiful, and she was neither tired nor hungry.  13. But good, faithful Rover was hungry, and she had not  given him even one piece of meat. She tried to forget how  selfish she had been; but she could not do so, and quite early  she started for home.  14. When she was nearly out of the woods, a rustling in  the underbrush attracted her attention. \"I wonder if that is a  bird or a squirrel,\" said she to herself. \"If I can catch it, how  glad I shall be!\"  15. She tried to make her way quietly through the  underbrush; but what was her terror when she saw it large  snake coiled up before her, prepared for a spring!  16. She was so much frightened that she could not move;  but brave Rover saw the snake, and, springing forward,  seized it by the neck and killed it.  17. When the faithful dog came and rubbed his head  against her hand, Susie put her  3, 12.    178  ECLECTIC SERIES.  arms 'round his neck, and burst into tears. \"O Rover,\" she  cried, \"you dear, good dog! How sorry I am that I was so  selfish!\"  18. Rover understood the tone of her voice, if he did not  understand her words, and capered about in great glee,  barking all the time. You may be sure that he had a plentiful  supper that evening.  19. Susie never forgot the lesson of that day. She soon  learned to be on her guard against a selfish spirit, and  became a happier and more lovable little girl.  Mrs. M. O. Johnson--Adapted.      LESSON LXVIII.  THE VIOLET.    1.

And yet it was a lovely flower,  Its colors bright and fair;  It might have graced a rosy bower  Instead of hiding there.    3. Yet there it was content to bloom,  In modest tints arrayed,  And there it spread its sweet perfume,  Within the silent shade.    4. Then let me to the valley go,  This pretty flower to see;  That I may also learn to grow  In sweet humility.  Jane Taylor.     180  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON LXIX.  NO CROWN FOR ME.  1. \"Will you come with us, Susan?\" cried several little  girls to a schoolmate. \"We are going to the woods; do come,  too.\"  2. \"I should like to go with you very much,\" replied  Susan, with a sigh; \"but I can not finish the task grandmother  set me to do.\"  3. \"How tiresome it must be to stay at home to work on a  holiday!\" said one of the girls, with a toss of her head.  \"Susan's grandmother is too strict.\"  4. Susan heard this remark, and, as she bent her head over  her task, she wiped away a tear, and thought of the pleasant  afternoon the girls would spend gathering wild flowers in the  woods.  5. Soon she said to herself, \"What harm can there be in  moving the mark grandmother put in the stocking? The  woods must be very beautiful to-day, and how I should like  to be in them!\"  6. \"Grandmother,\" said she, a few minutes afterwards, \"I  am ready, now.\" \"What, so     THIRD READER.  181  soon, Susan?\" Her grandmother took the work, and looked at  it very closely.  7. \"True, Susan,\" said she, laying great stress on each  word; \"true, I count twenty turns from the mark; and, as you  have never deceived me, you may go and amuse yourself as  you like the rest of the day.\"  8. Susan's cheeks were scarlet, and she did not say,  \"Thank you.\" As she left the cottage, she walked slowly  away, not singing as usual.  9. \"Why, here is Susan!\" the girls cried, when she joined  their company; \"but what is the matter? Why have you left  your dear, old grandmother?\" they tauntingly added.  10. \"There is nothing the matter.\" As Susan repeated these  words, she felt that she was trying to deceive herself. She  had acted a lie. At the same time she remembered her  grandmother's words, \"You have never deceived me.\"  11. \"Yes, I have deceived her,\" said she to herself. \"If she  knew all, she would never trust me again.\"  12. When the little party had reached an open space in the  woods, her companions ran about enjoying themselves; but  Susan sat on     182  ECLECTIC SERIES.      the grass, wishing she were at home confessing her fault.  13. After a while Rose cried out, \"Let us make a crown of  violets, and put it on the head of the best girl here.\"  14. \"It will be easy enough to make the crown, but not so  easy to decide who is to wear it,\" said Julia.  15. \"Why, Susan is to wear it, of course,\" said Rose: \"is  she not said to be the best girl in school and the most  obedient at home?\"  16. \"Yes, yes; the crown shall be for Susan,\"     THIRD READER.  183  cried the other girls, and they began to make the crown. It  was soon finished.  17. \"Now, Susan,\" said Rose, \"put it on in a very dignified  way, for you are to be our queen.\"  18. As these words were spoken, the crown was placed on  her head. In a moment she snatched it off, and threw it on the  ground, saying, \"No crown for me; I do not deserve it.\"  19. The girls looked at her with surprise. \"I have deceived  my grandmother,\" said she, while tears flowed down her  cheeks. \"I altered the mark she put in the stocking, that I  might join you in the woods.\"  20. \"Do you call that wicked?\" asked one of the girls.  \"I am quite sure it is; and I have been"]]]
