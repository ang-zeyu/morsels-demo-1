In the  first place, it should be remembered that the theory, as Mr. Lowell  presents it, does not assert that the visible lines are the actual  canals, but only that they are strips of territory intersected, like  Holland or the center of the plain of Lombardy, by innumerable  irrigation canals and ditches. To construct such works is clearly not an  impossible undertaking, although it does imply great industry and  concentration of effort.    In the second place, since the force of gravity on Mars is in the ratio  of only 38 to 100 compared with the earth's, it is evident that the  diminished weight of all bodies to be handled would give the inhabitants  of Mars an advantage over those of the earth in the performance of  manual labor, provided that they possess physical strength and activity  as great as ours. But, in consequence of this very fact of the slighter  force of gravity, a man upon Mars could attain a much greater size, and  consequently much greater muscular strength, than his fellows upon the  earth possess without being oppressed by his own weight. In other words,  as far as the force of gravity may be considered as the decisive factor,  Mars could be inhabited by giants fifteen feet tall, who would be  relatively just as active, and just as little impeded in their movements  by the weight of their bodies, as a six-footer is upon the earth. But  they would possess far more physical strength than we do, while, in  doing work, they would have much lighter materials to deal with.    Whether the theory that the canals of Mars really are canals is true or  not, at any rate there can now be no doubt as to the existence of the  strange lines which bear that designation. The suggestion has been  offered that their builders may no longer be in existence, Mars having  already passed the point in its history where life must cease upon its  surface. This brings us to consider again the statement, made near the  beginning of this chapter, that Mars is, perhaps, at a more advanced  stage of development than the earth. If we accept this view, then,  provided there was originally some resemblance between Mars's life forms  and those of the earth, the inhabitants of that planet would, at every  step, probably be in front of their terrestrial rivals, so that at the  present time they should stand well in advance. Mr. Lowell has, perhaps,  put this view of the relative advancement in evolution of Mars and its  inhabitants as picturesquely as anybody.    \"In Mars,\" he says, \"we have before us the spectacle of a world  relatively well on in years, a world much older than the earth. To so  much about his age Mars bears witness on his face. He shows unmistakable  signs of being old. Advancing planetary years have left their mark  legible there. His continents are all smoothed down; his oceans have all  dried up.... Mars being thus old himself, we know that evolution on his  surface must be similarly advanced. This only informs us of its  condition relative to the planet's capabilities. Of its actual state our  data are not definite enough to furnish much deduction. But from the  fact that our own development has been comparatively a recent thing, and  that a long time would be needed to bring even Mars to his present  geological condition, we may judge any life he may support to be not  only relatively, but really older than our own. From the little we can  see such appears to be the case. The evidence of handicraft, if such it  be, points to a highly intelligent mind behind it. Irrigation,  unscientifically conducted, would not give us such truly wonderful  mathematical fitness in the several parts to the whole as we there  behold.... Quite possibly such Martian folk are possessed of inventions  of which we have not dreamed, and with them electrophones and  kinetoscopes are things of a bygone past, preserved with veneration in  museums as relics of the clumsy contrivances of the simple childhood of  the race. Certainly what we see hints at the existence of beings who are  in advance of, not behind us, in the journey of life.\"[3]    [Footnote 3: Mars, by Percival Lowell, p. 207 _et seq._]    Granted the existence of such a race as is thus described, and to them  it might not seem a too appalling enterprise, when their planet had  become decrepit, with its atmosphere thinned out and its supply of water  depleted, to grapple with the destroying hand of nature and to prolong  the career of their world by feats of chemistry and engineering as yet  beyond the compass of human knowledge.    It is confidence, bred from considerations like these, in the superhuman  powers of the supposed inhabitants of Mars that has led to the popular  idea that they are trying to communicate by signals with the earth.  Certain enigmatical spots of light, seen at the edge of the illuminated  disk of Mars, and projecting into the unilluminated part--for Mars,  although an outer planet, shows at particular times a gibbous phase  resembling that of the moon just before or just after the period of full  moon--have been interpreted by some, but without any scientific  evidence, as of artificial origin.    Upon the assumption that these bright points, and others occasionally  seen elsewhere on the planet's disk, are intended by the Martians for  signals to the earth, entertaining calculations have been made as to the  quantity of light that would be required in the form of a \"flash signal\"  to be visible across the distance separating the two planets. The  results of the calculations have hardly been encouraging to possible  investors in interplanetary telegraphy, since it appears that  heliographic mirrors with reflecting surfaces measured by square miles,  instead of square inches, would be required to send a visible beam from  the earth to Mars or _vice versa_.    The projections of light on Mars can be explained much more simply and  reasonably. Various suggestions have been made about them; among others,  that they are masses of cloud reflecting the sunshine; that they are  areas of snow; and that they are the summits of mountains crowned with  ice and encircled with clouds. In fact, a huge mountain mass lying on  the terminator, or the line between day and night, would produce the  effect of a tongue of light projecting into the darkness without  assuming that it was snow-covered or capped with clouds, as any one may  convince himself by studying the moon with a telescope when the  terminator lies across some of its most mountainous regions. To be sure,  there is reason to think that the surface of Mars is remarkably flat;  yet even so the planet may have some mountains, and on a globe the  greater part of whose shell is smooth any projections would be  conspicuous, particularly where the sunlight fell at a low angle across  them.    Another form in which the suggestion of interplanetary communication has  been urged is plainly an outgrowth of the invention and surprising  developments of wireless telegraphy. The human mind is so constituted  that whenever it obtains any new glimpse into the arcana of nature it  immediately imagines an indefinite and all but unlimited extension of  its view in that direction. So to many it has not appeared unreasonable  to assume that, since it is possible to transmit electric impulses for  considerable distances over the earth's surface by the simple  propagation of a series of waves, or undulations, without connecting  wires, it may also be possible to send such impulses through the ether  from planet to planet.    The fact that the electric undulations employed in wireless telegraphy  pass between stations connected by the crust of the earth itself, and  immersed in a common atmospheric envelope, is not deemed by the  supporters of the theory in question as a very serious objection, for,  they contend, electric waves are a phenomenon of the ether, which  extends throughout space, and, given sufficient energy, such waves could  cross the gap between world and world.    But nobody has shown how much energy would be needed for such a purpose,  and much less has anybody indicated a way in which the required energy  could be artificially developed, or cunningly filched from the stores of  nature. It is, then, purely an assumption, an interesting figment of  the mind, that certain curious disturbances in the electrical state of  the air and the earth, affecting delicate electric instruments,  possessing a marked periodicity in brief intervals of time, and not yet  otherwise accounted for, are due to the throbbing, in the all-enveloping  ether, of impulses transmitted from instruments controlled by the  _savants_ of Mars, whose insatiable thirst for knowledge, and presumably  burning desire to learn whether there is not within reach some more  fortunate world than their half-dried-up globe, has led them into a  desperate attempt to \"call up\" the earth on their interplanetary  telephone, with the hope that we are wise and skilful enough to  understand and answer them.    In what language they intend to converse no one has yet undertaken to  tell, but the suggestion has sapiently been made that, mathematical  facts being invariable, the eternal equality of two plus two with four  might serve as a basis of understanding, and that a statement of that  truth sent by electric taps across the ocean of ether would be a  convincing assurance that the inhabitants of the planet from which the  message came at least enjoyed the advantages of a common-school  education.    But, while speculation upon this subject rests on unverified, and at  present unverifiable, assumptions, of course everybody would rejoice if  such a thing were possible, for consider what zest and charm would be  added to human life if messages, even of the simplest description, could  be sent to and received from intelligent beings inhabiting other  planets!

Cracker meal enough to thicken.      ~NOODLE DOUGH FOR ITALIAN RAVIOLI~--Make noodle crust as you would for  noodles. Roll very fine and cover half the crust with ravioli dressing  half-inch thick. Turn over the other half to cover. Mark in squares as  shown in figure.    Cut with a pie cutter after marking. Drop one by one in salted boiling  water, cook about twenty minutes, drain and arrange on platter and  sprinkle each layer with grated cheese and mushroom sauce.      ~BOLOGNA SAUSAGE~--Chop fine one pound each of beef, pork, veal and fat  bacon. Mix with three-fourths of a pound of fine chopped beef suet and  season with sage, sweet herbs, salt and pepper. Press into large skins  thoroughly cleaned and soaked in cold salt water for several hours  before being used, fasten tightly on both ends and prick in several  places. Place in a deep saucepan, cover with boiling water, simmer  gently for an hour, lay on straw to dry and hang.      ~LEMON JELLY~--Grate two lemons and the juice of one. The yolks of three  eggs, two cups of sugar. Butter, the size of an egg. Boil until thick.      ~MARGARETTES~--One half-pound of peanuts, one pound of dates chopped  fine. One cup of milk in the dates and boil, add peanuts. Make a boiled  icing. Take the long branch crackers, spread the filling between the  crackers, put on the icing and put in the oven to brown.          VEGETABLES      ~BRUSSELS SPROUTS~--Wash well in salted water about two pounds of  Brussels sprouts and pick them over well. Place them on a fire in a  saucepan filled with water, a little salt and bicarbonate of soda. With  the lid off boil fast till tender; about twenty to twenty-five minutes.  When done drain them and dry on a cloth. Put in a large saucepan a  good-sized lump of butter and a little salt and pepper. Toss the sprouts  in this until they become quite hot again, but do not fry them. Serve on  a quartered round of buttered toast.      ~BRUSSELS SPROUTS MAITRE D'HOTEL~--Boil the sprouts and then place them  in a saucepan with a lump of butter and beat them well. Put half a pound  of fresh butter in a pan with two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, the  juice of a couple of lemons, a little salt and white pepper and mix  together well with a spatula, and when it boils stir quickly. Place the  sprouts on a dish and turn the sauce over them.      ~BRUSSELS SPROUTS SAUTED~--One pound of Brussels sprouts should be  thoroughly washed and boiled and then put into a pan over the fire  together with a good-sized lump of butter, a little salt, and toss for  eight minutes. Sprinkle over them a little chopped parsley, and serve  when done.      ~BAKED MUSHROOMS IN CUPS~--Peel and cut off the stalks of a dozen or  more large fat mushrooms, and chop up fine. Put the trimmings in a  stewpan with some water or clear gravy, and boil well. When nicely  flavored strain the liquor, return it to the stewpan with the mushrooms  and a moderate quantity of finely chopped parsley, season to taste with  salt and pepper, and boil gently on the side of the stove for nearly  three-quarters of an hour. Beat four eggs well in one-half teacupful of  cream, and strain. When the mushrooms are ready move the stewpan away  from the fire and stir in the beaten eggs. Butter some small cups or  molds, fill each with the mixture, and bake in a brisk oven. Prepare  some white sauce; when baked turn the mushrooms out of the molds on a  hot dish, pour the sauce around them, and serve.      ~BOILED CHESTNUTS SERVED AS VEGETABLES~--Peel off the outside skin of  the chestnuts and steep them in boiling water until the skin can be  easily removed, and throw them into a bowl of cold water. Put two ounces  of butter into a saucepan with two tablespoons of flour and stir the  whole over a fire until well mixed. Then pour in one-half pint or more  of clear broth and continue stirring over the fire until it boils.  Season with salt, throw in the chestnuts and keep them simmering at the  side of the fire until tender. When served in this way they make a good  vegetable for roasted meat or poultry, particularly turkey.      ~BOILED CORN~--Choose short, thick ears of fresh corn, remove all the  husks except the inner layer: strip that down far enough to remove the  silk and any defective grains and then replace it, and tie at the upper  end of each ear of corn. Have ready a large pot half full of boiling  water, put in the corn and boil steadily for about twenty minutes, if  the ears are large, and fifteen minutes if they are small. Remove from  the boiling water, take off the strings, and serve hot at once. If  desirable, the inner husk may be removed before serving, but this must  be done very quickly, and the ears covered with a napkin or a clean  towel to prevent the heat from escaping. Serve plenty of salt, butter  and pepper with the corn. These may be mixed by heating them together,  and serve in a gravy bowl.      ~BOILED ONIONS WITH CREAM~--Peel twelve medium-sized onions, pare the  roots without cutting them, place in a saucepan, cover with salted  water, add a bunch of parsley, and boil for forty-five minutes; take  them from the saucepan, place them on a dish, covering with two gills of  cream sauce, mixed with two tablespoonfuls of broth, garnish, and serve.      ~CORN FRITTERS~--Prepare four ears of fresh corn by removing the outer  husks and silks; boil and then drain well. Cut the grains from the cobs  and place in a bowl, season with salt and pepper, add one-fourth pound  of sifted flour, two eggs and a half pint of cold milk. Stir vigorously,  but do not beat, with a wooden spoon for five minutes, when it will be  sufficiently firm; butter a frying-pan, place it on a fire, and with a  ladle holding one gill put the mixture on the pan in twelve parts, being  careful that they do not touch one another, and fry till of a good  golden color, cooking for four or five minutes on each side. Dress them  on a folded napkin, and serve.      ~BROILED EGGPLANT~--Peel an eggplant and cut it into six slices each  half an inch thick. Put them into a dish and season with salt and pepper  and pour over them one tablespoon of sweet oil. Mix well and arrange the  slices of the eggplant on a broiler and broil on each side for five  minutes, then place on a dish which has been heated and pour over a gill  of maitre d'hotel sauce, and serve.      ~FRIED EGGPLANT~--Select a nice large eggplant, peel, remove the seeds,  and cut into pieces about one and one-half inches long and  three-quarters of an inch wide. Put them on a plate, sprinkle well with  salt and leave standing for an hour or so. Then wrap the pieces in a  cloth and twist it around so as to squeeze as much juice as possible  from them without breaking. Sprinkle over with flour, covering each side  well, and place them in a frying basket. Put a large lump of fat in a  stewpan and when it boils put in the basket. As each plant is nicely  browned take out of the basket, sprinkle with salt and lay on a sheet of  paper in front of a fire so as to drain as free as possible from fat.  Serve on a napkin spread over a hot dish.      ~EGGPLANT FRITTERS~--Boil the eggplant in salted water mixed with a  little lemon juice. When tender, skin, drain and mash them. For every  pint of pulp, add one-half breakfast cup full of flour, two well beaten  eggs, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Shape into fritters and  fry in boiling fat until brown.      ~BROILED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST~--Trim off the stalks of the required  quantity of large mushrooms, peel, score them once across the top, place  them on a gridiron and grill over a slow fire, turning when done on one  side. Trim the crusts off some slices of bread and toast on both sides.  Cut rounds out of the toast the same size as the mushrooms, butter them  and place a mushroom on each. Put a lump of butter in each mushroom and  sprinkle over with salt and pepper. Place a fancy dish-paper on a hot  dish, and serve the mushrooms-on-toast, with a garnish of fried parsley.      ~DEVILED MUSHROOMS~--Cut off the stalks even with the head and peel and  trim the mushrooms neatly. Brush them over inside with a paste brush  dipped in warm butter, and season with salt and pepper, and a small  quantity of cayenne pepper. Put them on a gridiron and broil over a  clear fire. When cooked put the mushrooms on a hot dish, and serve.      ~MUSHROOMS IN CREAM~--Peel and trim the required quantity of mushrooms.  Put some cream in a pan over the fire and season with pepper and salt to  taste. Rub the mushrooms in salt and pepper, and as quickly as the cream  comes to a boil put them in and let boil for four minutes. Serve hot.      ~BOILED SPANISH ONIONS~--Boil Spanish onions in salted water thirty  minutes. Drain and add butter or drippings, salt and pepper, covering  the pan to prevent steam from escaping. Cook slowly for about three  hours, basting frequently with drippings. Care should be taken that they  do not burn.      ~BAKED ONIONS~--Put six large onions into a saucepan of water, or water  and milk in equal proportions, add salt and pepper and boil until  tender. When done so they can be easily mashed work them up with butter  to the consistency of paste, cover with breadcrumbs, and bake in a  moderate oven. If preferred they may be boiled whole, put in a baking  dish covered with butter and breadcrumbs, then baked.      ~FRIED ONIONS~--Peel and slice into even rounds four medium-sized  onions. Place them first in milk then in flour, fry in very hot fat for  eight minutes. Remove them carefully and lay on a cloth to dry. Place a  folded napkin on a dish, lay the onions on, and serve very hot. Garnish  with fried parsley.      ~GLAZED ONIONS~--Peel the onions and place in a saucepan with a little  warmed butter, add sugar and salt to taste, pour over a little stock.  Place over a moderate fire and cook slowly till"]]]
