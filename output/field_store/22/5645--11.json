At any rate, in the lines of annals which still exist  above that which contains the chronicle of the reign of Neneter no  entry can be definitely identified as belonging to the reigns of Aha  or Narmer. In a line below there is a mention of the \"birth of  Khasekhemui,\" apparently a festival in honour of the birth of that king  celebrated in the same way as the reputed birthday of a god. This shows  the great honour in which Khasekhemui was held, and perhaps it was he  who really finally settled the question of the unification of North and  South and consolidated the work of the earlier kings.    As far as we can tell, then, Aha and Narmer were the first conquerors  of the North, the unifiers of the kingdom, and the originals of the  legendary Mena. In their time the kingdom's centre of gravity was still  in the South, and Narmer (who is probably identical with \"the Scorpion\")  dedicated the memorials of his deeds in the temple of Hierakonpolis. It  may be that the legend of the founding of Memphis in the time of \"Menes\"  is nearly correct (as we shall see, historically, the foundation may  have been due to Merpeba), but we have the authority of Manetho for  the fact that the first two dynasties were \"Thinite\" (that is, Upper  Egyptian), and that Memphis did not become the capital till the time of  the Hid Dynasty. With this statement the evidence of the monuments fully  agrees. The earliest royal tombs in the pyramid-field of Memphis date  from the time of the Hid Dynasty, so that it is evident that the kings  had then taken up their abode in the Northern capital. We find that soon  after the time of Khasekhemui the king Perabsen was especially connected  with Lower Egypt. His personal name is unknown to us (though he may  be the \"Uatjnes\" of the lists), but we do know that he had two  banner-names, Sekhem-ab and Perabsen. The first is his hawk or  Horus-name, the second his Set-name; that is to say, while he bore the  first name as King of Upper Egypt under the special patronage of Horus,  the hawk-god of the Upper Country, he bore the second as King of Lower  Egypt, under the patronage of Set, the deity of the Delta, whose fetish  animal appears above this name instead of the hawk. This shows how  definitely Perabsen wished to appear as legitimate King of Lower as well  as Upper Egypt. In later times the Theban kings of the XIIth Dynasty,  when they devoted themselves to winning the allegiance of the  Northerners by living near Memphis rather than at Thebes, seem to have  been imitating the successors of Khasekhemui.    Moreover, we now find various evidences of increasing connection with  the North. A princess named Ne-maat-hap, who seems to have been the  mother of Sa-nekht, the first king of the Hid Dynasty, bears the name of  the sacred Apis of Memphis, her name signifying \"Possessing the right of  Apis.\" According to Manetho, the kings of the Hid Dynasty are the first  Memphites, and this seems to be quite correct. With Ne-maat-hap the  royal right seems to have been transferred to a Memphite house. But the  Memphites still had associations with Upper Egypt: two of them, Tjeser  Khet-neter and Sa-nekht, were buried near Abydos, in the desert at Bet  Khallaf, where their tombs were discovered and excavated by Mr. Garstang  in 1900. The tomb of Tjeser is a great brick-built mastaba, forty feet  high and measuring 300 feet by 150 feet. The actual tomb-chambers are  excavated in the rock, twenty feet below the ground-level and sixty feet  below the top of the mastaba. They had been violated in ancient times,  but a number of clay jar-sealings, alabaster vases, and bowls belonging  to the tomb furniture were found by the discoverer. Sa-nekht's tomb is  similar. In it was found the preserved skeleton of its owner, who was a  giant seven feet high.    [Illustration: 082.jpg THE TOMB OF KING TJESER AT BET KHALLAF. About  3700 B.C.]    It is remarkable that Manetho chronicles among the kings of the early  period a king named Sesokhris, who was five cubits high. This may have  been Sa-nekht.    Tjeser had two tombs, one, the above-mentioned, near Abydos, the  other at Sakkara, in the Memphite pyramid-field. This is the famous  Step-Pyramid. Since Sa-nekht seems really to have been buried at Bet  Khal-laf, probably Tjeser was, too, and the Step-Pyramid may have been  his secondary or sham tomb, erected in the necropolis of Memphis as a  compliment to Seker, the Northern god of the dead, just as Aha had his  secondary tomb at Abydos in compliment to Khentamenti. Sne-feru, also,  the last king of the Hid Dynasty, seems to have had two tombs. One of  these was the great Pyramid of Medum, which was explored by Prof. Petrie  in 1891, the other was at Dashur. Near by was the interesting necropolis  already mentioned, in which was discovered evidence of the continuance  of the cramped position of burial and of the absence of mummification  among a certain section of the population even as late as the time of  the IVth Dynasty. This has been taken to imply that the fusion of the  primitive Neolithic and invading sub-Semitic races had not been effected  at that time.    With the IVth Dynasty the connection of the royal house with the South  seems to have finally ceased. The governmental centre of gravity was  finally transferred to Memphis, and the kings were thenceforth for  several centuries buried in the great pyramids which still stand in  serried order along the western desert border of Egypt, from the Delta  to the province of the Fayyum. With the latest discoveries in this  Memphite pyramid-field we shall deal in the next chapter.    The transference of the royal power to Memphis under the Hid Dynasty  naturally led to a great increase of Egyptian activity in the Northern  lands. We read in Manetho of a great Libyan war in the reign of  Neche-rophes, and both Sa-nekht and Tjeser seem to have finally  established Egyptian authority in the Sinaitic peninsula, where their  rock-inscriptions have been found.    In 1904 Prof. Petrie was despatched to Sinai by the Egypt Exploration  Fund, in order finally to record the inscriptions of the early kings  in the Wadi Maghara, which had been lately very much damaged by the  operations of the turquoise-miners. It seems almost incredible that  ignorance and vandalism should still be so rampant in the twentieth  century that the most important historical monuments are not safe from  desecration in order to obtain a few turquoises, but it is so. Prof.  Petrie's expedition did not start a day too soon, and at the suggestion  of Sir William Garstin, the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, the  majority of the inscriptions have been removed to the Cairo Museum for  safety and preservation. Among the new inscriptions discovered is one of  Sa-nekht, which is now in the British Museum. Tjeser and Sa-nekht were  not the first Egyptian kings to visit Sinai. Already, in the days of the  1st Dynasty, Semerkha had entered that land and inscribed his name upon  the rocks. But the regular annexation, so to speak, of Sinai to Egypt  took place under the Memphites of the Hid Dynasty.    With the Hid Dynasty we have reached the age of the pyramid-builders.  The most typical pyramids are those of the three great kings of the IVth  Dynasty, Khufu, Khafra, and Menkaura, at Giza near Cairo. But, as  we have seen, the last king of the Hid Dynasty, Snefru, also had one  pyramid, if not two; and the most ancient of these buildings known to  us, the Step-Pyramid of Sakkara, was erected by Tjeser at the beginning  of that dynasty. The evolution of the royal tombs from the time of the  1st Dynasty to that of the IVth is very interesting to trace. At the  period of transition from the predynastic to the dynastic age we have  the great mastaba of Aha at Nakada, and the simplest chamber-tombs  at Abydos. All these were of brick; no stone was used in their  construction. Then we find the chamber-tomb of Den Semti at Abydos  with a granite floor, the walls being still of brick. Above each of the  Abydos tombs was probably a low mound, and in front a small chapel, from  which a flight of steps descended into the simple chamber. On one of the  little plaques already mentioned, which were found in these tombs, we  have an archaic inscription, entirely written in ideographs, which  seems to read, \"The Big-Heads (i. e. the chiefs) come to the tomb.\" The  ideograph for \"tomb\" seems to be a rude picture of the funerary chapel,  but from it we can derive little information as to its construction.  Towards the end of the Ist Dynasty, and during the lid, the royal tombs  became much more complicated, being surrounded with numerous chambers  for the dead slaves, etc. Khasekhemui's tomb has thirty-three such  chambers, and there is one large chamber of stone. We know of no other  instance of the use of stone work for building at this period except in  the royal tombs. No doubt the mason's art was still so difficult that it  was reserved for royal use only.    Under the Hid Dynasty we find the last brick mastabas built for royalty,  at Bet Khallaf, and the first pyramids, in the Memphite necropolis.  In the mastaba of Tjeser at Bet Khallaf stone was used for the great  portcullises which were intended to bar the way to possible plunderers  through the passages of the tomb. The Step-Pyramid at Sakkara is, so to  speak, a series of mastabas of stone, imposed one above the other; it  never had the continuous casing of stone which is the mark of a true  pyramid. The pyramid of Snefru at Medum is more developed. It also  originated in a mastaba, enlarged, and with another mastaba-like  erection on the top of it; but it was given a continuous sloping casing  of fine limestone from bottom to top, and so is a true pyramid.

Pharaoh took good care not to reject a petition presented so humbly:  he proceeded to lavish appointments, titles, and estates on the son in  question; if necessity required it, he would even seek out a wife for  him, who might give him, together with her hand, a property equal to  that of his father. The majority of these great vassals secretly aspired  to the crown: they frequently had reason to believe that they had some  right to it, either through their mother or one of their ancestors. Had  they combined against the reigning house, they could easily have gained  the upper hand, but their mutual jealousies prevented this, and the  overthrow of a dynasty to which they owed so much would, for the most  part, have profited them but little: as soon as one of them revolted,  the remainder took arms in Pharaoh's defence, led his armies and  fought his battles. If at times their ambition and greed harassed  their suzerain, at least their power was at his service, and their  self-interested allegiance was often the means of delaying the downfall  of his house.    Two things were specially needful both for them and for Pharaoh in order  to maintain or increase their authority--the protection of the gods,  and a military organization which enabled them to mobilize the whole of  their forces at the first signal. The celestial world was the faithful  image of our own; it had its empires and its feudal organization, the  arrangement of which corresponded to that of the terrestrial world. The  gods who inhabited it were dependent upon the gifts of mortals, and the  resources of each individual deity, and consequently his power, depended  on the wealth and number of his worshippers; anything influencing one  had an immediate effect on the other. The gods dispensed happiness,  health, and vigour;* to those who made them large offerings and  instituted pious foundations, they lent their own weapons, and inspired  them with needful strength to overcome their enemies. They even came  down to assist in battle, and every great encounter of armies involved  an invisible struggle among the immortals. The gods of the side which  was victorious shared with it in the triumph, and received a tithe of  the spoil as the price of their help; the gods of the vanquished were  so much the poorer, their priests and their statues were reduced  to slavery, and the destruction of their people entailed their own  downfall.         * I may here remind my readers of the numberless bas-reliefs       and stelae on which the king is represented as making an       offering to a god, who replies in some such formula as the       following: \"I give thee health and strength;\" or, \"I give       thee joy and life for millions of years.\"    It was, therefore, to the special interest of every one in Egypt, from  the Pharaoh to the humblest of his vassals, to maintain the good will  and power of the gods, so that their protection might be effectively  ensured in the hour of danger. Pains were taken to embellish their  temples with obelisks, colossi, altars, and bas-reliefs; new buildings  were added to the old; the parts threatened with ruin were restored or  entirely rebuilt; daily gifts were brought of every kind--animals which  were sacrificed on the spot, bread, flowers, fruit, drinks, as well  as perfumes, stuffs, vases, jewels, bricks or bars of gold, silver,  lapis-lazuli, which were all heaped up in the treasury within the  recesses of the crypts.* If a dignitary of high rank wished to  perpetuate the remembrance of his honours or his services, and at the  same time to procure for his double the benefit of endless prayers and  sacrifices, he placed \"by special permission\"** a statue of himself on a  votive stele in the part of the temple reserved for this purpose,--in  a courtyard, chamber, encircling passage, as at Karnak,*** or on  the staircase of Osiris as in that leading up to the terrace in the  sanctuary of Abydos; he then sealed a formal agreement with the priests,  by which the latter engaged to perform a service in his name, in front  of this commemorative monument, a stated number of times in the year, on  the days fixed by universal observance or by local custom.         * See the \"Poem of Pentauirit\" for the grounds on which       Ramses II. bases his imperative appeal to Araon for help:       \"Have I not made thee numerous offerings? I have filled thy       temple with my prisoners. I have built thee an everlasting       temple, and have not spared my wealth in endowing it for       thee; I lay the whole world under contribution in order to       stock thy domain.... I have built thee whole pylons in       stone, and have myself reared the flagstaffs which adorn       them; I have brought thee obelisks from Elephantine.\"         ** The majority of the votive statues were lodged in a       temple \"by special favour of a king \"--em HOSItu nti KUIr       suton--as a recompense for services rendered. Some only of       the stelae bear an inscription to the above effect, no       authorization from the king was required for the       consecration of a stele in a temple.         *** It was in the encircling passage of the limestone temple       built by the kings of the XIIth dynasty, and now completely       destroyed, that all the Karnak votive statues were       discovered. Some of them still rest on the stone ledge on       which they were placed by the priests of the god at the       moment of consecration.    For this purpose he assigned to them annuities in kind, charges on his  patrimonial estates, or in some cases, if he were a great lord, on the  revenues of his fief,--such as a fixed quantity of loaves and drinks  for each of the celebrants, a fourth part of the sacrificial victim,  a garment, frequently also lands with their cattle, serfs, existing  buildings, farming implements and produce, along with the conditions  of service with which the lands were burdened. These gifts to the  god--\"notir hotpuu\"--were, it appears, effected by agreements analogous  to those dealing with property in mortmain in modern Egypt; in each  nome they constituted, in addition to the original temporalities of the  temple, a considerable domain, constantly enlarged by fresh endowments.  The gods had no daughters for whom to provide, nor sons among whom to  divide their inheritance; all that fell to them remained theirs for  ever, and in the contracts were inserted imprecations threatening with  terrible ills, in this world and the next, those who should abstract the  smallest portion from them. Such menaces did not always prevent the king  or the lords from laying hands on the temple revenues: had this not been  the case, Egypt would soon have become a sacerdotal country from one end  to the other. Even when reduced by periodic usurpations, the domain of  the gods formed, at all periods, about one-third of the whole country.*         * The tradition handed down by Diodorus tells us that the       goddess Isis assigned a third of the country to the priests;       the whole of Egypt is said to have been divided into three       equal parts, the first of which belonged to the priests, the       second to the kings, and the third to the warrior class.       When we read, in the great Harris Papyrus, the list of the       property possessed by the temple of the Theban Amon alone,       all over Egypt, under Ramses III., we can readily believe       that the tradition of the Greek epoch in no way exaggerated       matters.    Its administration was not vested in a single body of Priests,  representing the whole of Egypt and recruited or ruled everywhere in  the same fashion. There were as many bodies of priests as there were  temples, and every temple preserved its independent constitution with  which the clergy of the neighbouring temples had nothing to do: the  only master they acknowledged was the lord of the territory on which  the temple was built, either Pharaoh or one of his nobles. The tradition  which made Pharaoh the head of the different worships in Egypt*  prevailed everywhere, but Pharaoh soared too far above this world  to confine himself to the functions of any one particular order of  priests: he officiated before all the gods without being specially  the minister of any, and only exerted his supremacy in order to make  appointments to important sacerdotal posts in his domain.**         * The only exception to this rule was in the case of the       Theban kings of the XXIst dynasty, and even here the       exception is more apparent than real. As a matter of fact,       these kings, Hrihor and Pinozmu, began by being high priests       of Amon before ascending the throne; they were pontiffs who       became Pharaohs, not Pharaohs who created themselves       pontiffs. Possibly we ought to place Smonkhari of the XIVth       dynasty in the same category, if, as Brugsch assures us, his       name, Mir-mashau, is identical with the title of the high       priest of Osiris at Mendes, thus proving that he was pontiff       of Osiris in that town before he became king.         ** Among other instances, we have that of the king of the       XXIst Tanite dynasty, who appointed Mankhopirri, high priest       of the Theban Amon, and that of the last king of the same       dynasty, Psusennes IL, who conferred the same office on       prince Auputi, son of Sheshonqu. The king's right of       nomination harmonized very well with the hereditary       transmission of the priestly office through members of the       same family, as we shall have occasion to show later on.    He reserved the high priesthood of the Memphite Phtah and that of Ra of  Heliopolis either for the princes of his own family or more often for  his most faithful servants; they were the docile instruments of his  will, through whom he exerted the influence of the gods, and disposed  of their property without having the trouble of administrating it.
