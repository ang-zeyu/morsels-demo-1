And if you do consider how any  rugged body would appeare, being enlightned, you would easily conceive  that it must necessarily seeme under some such gibbous unequall forme,  as the Moone is here represented. Now for the infallibility of these  appearances, I shall referre the reader to that which hath beene said in  the 6th Proposition.    But _Caesar la Galla_ affirmes, that all these appearances may consist  with a plaine superficies, if wee suppose the parts of the body to be  some of them, _Diaphanous_, and some opacous; and if you object that the  light which is conveyed to any diaphanous part in a plaine superficies  must be by a continued line, whereas here there appeare many brighter  parts among the obscure at some distance from the rest. To this he  answers, it may arise from some secret conveyances and channels within  her body, that doe consist of a more diaphanous matter which being  covered over with an opacious superficies, the light passing through  them may breake out a great way off, whereas the other parts betwixt may  still remaine darke. Just as the River _Arethusa_ in _Sicile_ which  runnes under ground for a great way, and afterwards breakes out againe.  But because this is one of the chiefest fancies whereby hee thinkes hee  hath fully answered the arguments of this opinion, I will therefore set  downe his answere in his owne words, lest the Reader might suspect more  in them then I have expressed.[1]      _Non est impossibile coecos ductus diaphani & perspicui corporis,    sed opaca superficie protendi, usque in diaphanam aliquam ex profundo    in superficiem, emergentem partem, per quos ductus lumen longo    postmodum interstitio erumpat, &c._    But I reply, if the superficies betwixt these two enlightened parts  remaine darke because of its opacity, then would it alwaies be darke,  and the Sunne could not make it partake of light more then it could of  perspicuity: But this contradicts all experience as you may see in  _Galilaeus_, who affirmes that when the Sunne comes nearer to his  opposition, then that which is betwixt them, both is enlightned as well  as either. Nay this opposes his owne eye-witnesse, for he confesses  himselfe that he saw this by the glasse. He had said before that he came  to see those strange sights discovered by _Galilaeus_ his glasse with an  intent of contradiction, and you may reade that confirmed in the  weakenesse of this answere, which rather bewrayes an obstinate then a  perswaded will, for otherwise sure hee would never have undertooke to  have destroyed such certaine proofes with so groundlesse a fancy.      [Sidenote 1: _Cap. 11._]    But it may bee objected, that 'tis almost impossible, and altogether  unlikely that in the Moone thete should be any mountaines so high as  those observations make them, for doe but suppose according to the  common principles, that the Moones diameter unto the Earths is very  neere to the proportion of 2. to 7, suppose withall that the Earths  diameter containes about 7000 Italian miles, and the Moones 2000 (as is  commonly granted) now _Galiaeus_ hath observed that some parts have been  enlightened when they were the twentieth part of the diameter distant  from the common terme of illumination, so that hence it must necessarily  follow that there may bee some Mountaines in the Moone so high, that  they are able to cast a shadow a 100 miles off. An opinion that sounds  like a prodigie or a fiction; wherefore 'tis likely that either those  appearances are caused by somewhat else besides mountaines, or else  those are fallible observations, from whence may follow such improbable  inconceiveable consequences.    But to this I answere:    1. You must consider the height of the Mountaines is but very little, if  you compare them to the length of their shadowes. Sr. _Walter  Rawleigh_[1] observes that the Mount _Athos_ now called _Lacas_ casts  its shadow 300 furlongs, which is above 37 miles, and yet that Mount is  none of the highest, nay _Solinus_[2] (whom I should rather believe in  this kinde) affirmes that this Mountaine gives his shadow quite over the  Sea, from _Macedon_ to the Ile of _Lemnos_ which is 700 furlongs or 84  miles, and yet according to the common reckoning it doth scarce reach 4  miles upwards, in its perpendicular height.      [Sidenote 1: _Hist. l. 1. c. 7. Sec. 11._]      [Sidenote 2: _Poly. histor. c. 21._]    2. I affirme that there are very high Mountaines in the Moone. _Keplar_  and _Galilaeus_ thinke that they are higher than any which are upon our  earth. But I am not of their opinion in this, because I suppose they goe  upon a false ground whilst they conceive that the highest mountaine upon  the earth is not above a mile perpendicular.    Whereas 'tis the common opinion and found true enough by observation,  that _Olympus_, _Atlas_, _Taurus_ and _Enius_, with many others are much  above this height. _Tenariffa_ in the Canary Ilands is proved by  computation to bee above 8 miles perpendicular, and about this height is  the mount _Perjacaca_ in _America_. Sr. _Walter Rawleigh_ seemes to  thinke, that the highest of these is neere 30 miles upright: nay  _Aristotle_[1] speaking of _Caucasus_ in _Asia_, affirmes it to bee  visible for 560 miles, as some interpreters finde by computation, from  which it will follow, that it was 78 miles perpendicularly high, as you  may see confirmed by _Jacobus Mazonius_,[2] and out of him in  _Blancanus_ the Jesuite.[3] But this deviates from the truth more in  excesse then the other doth in defect. However though these in the moone  are not so high as some amongst us, yet certaine it is they are of a  great height, and some of them at the least foure miles perpendicular.  This I shall prove from the observation of _Galilaeus_, whose glasse can  shew this truth to the senses, a proofe beyond exception and certaine  that man must needs be of a most timerous faith who dares not believe  his owne eye.      [Sidenote 1: _Meteor. l. 1. c. 11._]      [Sidenote 2: _Comparatio Arist. cum Platone, Sect. 3. c. 5._]      [Sidenote 3: _Exposi. in loc. Math. Artis. loc. 148._]    By that perspective you may plainely discerne some enlightned parts  (which are the mountaines) to be distant from the other about the  twentieth part of the diameter. From whence it will follow, that those  mountaines must necessarily be at the least foure Italian miles in  height.      [Illustration]    For let BDEF be the body of the moone, ABC will be a ray or beame of the  Sunne, which enlightens a mountaine at A and _B_ is the point of  contingency, the distance betwixt A and B must bee supposed to be the  twentieth part of the diameter which is an 100 miles, for so far are  some enlightened parts severed from the common terme of illumination.  Now the aggregate of the quadrate from A _B_ a hundred, and _B_ _G_ a  1000 will bee 1010000, unto which the quadrate arising from A G must be  equall according to the 47th proposition in the first booke of elements.  Therefore the whole line _A_ _G_ is somewhat more than 104, and the  distance betwixt H A must be above 4 miles, which was the thing to be  proved.    But it may be againe objected, if there be such rugged parts, and so  high mountaines, why then cannot wee discerne them at this distance, why  doth the moone appeare unto us so exactly round, and not rather as a  wheele with teeth?    I answere, by reason of too great a distance, for if the whole body  appeare to our eye so little, then those parts which beare so small a  proportion to the whole will not at all be sensible.    But it may be replied, if there were any such remarkeable hils, why does  not the limbe of the moone appeare like a wheele with teeth to those who  looke upon it through the great perspective on whose witnesse you so  much depend? or what reason is there that she appeares as exactly round  through it as shee doth to the bare eye? certainely then either there is  no such thing as you imagine, or else the glasse failes much in this  discovery.    To this I shall answere out of _Galilaeus_.    1. You must know that there is not meerely one ranke of mountaines about  the edge of the moone, but divers orders, one mountaine behind another,  and so there is somewhat to hinder those void spaces which otherwise,  perhaps, might appeare.    Now where there be many hils, the ground seemes even to a man that can  see the tops of all. Thus when the sea rages, and many vast waves are  lifted up, yet all may appeare plaine enough to one that stands at the  shore. So where there are so many hils, the inequality will be lesse  remarkable, if it be discerned at a distance.    2. Though there be mountains in that part which appeares unto us, to be  the limbe of the Moone, as well as in any other place, yet the bright  vapours hide their appearance: for there is an orbe of thicke vaporous  aire that doth immediatly compasse the body of the Moone, which though  it have not so great opacity, as to terminate the sight, yet being once  enlightened by the Sunne, it doth represent the body of the Moone under  a greater forme, and hinders our sight from a distinct view of her true  circumference. But of this in the next"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19115"],[0,"Roman Britain in 1914 (#13)"],[1,"his inquiries into a supposed Roman road running past  Harden, a little north-west of Bradford. Dr. Villy actually excavates  for his roads, in very praiseworthy fashion. But I do not feel sure  that he has actually proved a Roman road on the line which he has here  examined; he has found interesting and indubitable traces of an old  road, but not decisive evidence of its date. The same volume includes a  note of eight Roman coins of the 'Thirty Tyrants', from Yew Bank, Utley.      _Wales_    (47) _Archaeologia Cambrensis_ for 1914 (series vi, vol. xiv) contains  useful papers on Roman remains. Mr. H. G. Evelyn White describes in  detail his excavations carried out at Castell Collen in 1913--see my  Report for that year, pp. 1-58. One must regret that they have not been  continued in 1914. Mr. F. N. Pryce describes his work at Cae Gaer, near  Llangurig (pp. 205-20), also noted in that Report. The Rev. J. Fisher  quotes place-names possibly indicative of a Roman road near St. Asaph,  and quotes a suggestion by Mr. Egerton Phillimore that the township name  Wigfair, once Wicware, stands for Gwig-wair, and that the second half of  this represents the name Varis which the Antonine Itinerary places on  the Roman road from Chester to Carnarvon at a point which cannot be far  from St. Asaph and the Clwydd river (see my _Military Aspects of Roman  Wales_, pp. 26-8, and Owen's forthcoming _Pembrokeshire_, ii. 524).  Lastly, Mr. J. Ward reports on further finds of the fort wall at Cardiff  Castle (pp. 407-10): see above, p. 21.    (48) The excavation of the Roman fort at Gellygaer, thirteen miles north  of Cardiff, was brought in 1913 to a point at which (as I learn) it is  considered to be for the present finished. I referred to it in my Report  for 1913; Mr. John Ward's full description of the results obtained in  1913 is now issued in the _Transactions of the Cardiff Naturalists'  Society_ (vol. xlvi). The principal finds were a supposed 'drill-ground'  on the north-east of the fort, a bit of another inscription of Trajan,  a kiln in the churchyard, and a largish earthwork on the north-west of  the fort. This last is a regular oblong of not quite five acres internal  area, fortified by an earthen mound and a ditch; trenching across the  interior showed no trace of buildings or indeed of any occupation, but  the search was not carried very far. Several explanations have been  offered of it--that it was a temporary affair, thrown up while the  actual fort was abuilding; that it was intended for troops marching past  and needing to camp for a night at the spot; that it was an earlier  fort, begun when the first invasion of the Silures was made, about A.D.  50-2, but never finished. This third view is Mr. Ward's own. Without  more excavation, it is rash to pronounce positively, and perhaps even  a minute search might be fruitless. Analogies somewhat favour the first  theory, but there will always be room for difference of opinion in  explaining these excrescences (so to speak) of permanent forts, which  are slight in themselves and slightly explored.    As the exploration of this site appears to be closed for the present,  and indeed is nearly complete, it may be convenient to give a conspectus  of the whole in a small plan (fig. 29).    [Illustration: FIG. 29. GENERAL PLAN OF ROMAN WORKS AT GELLYGAER  (GLAMORGAN)    (A. Granaries; B. Commandant's House; C. Head-quarters; D. doubtful; E.  Barracks; F. Stabling(?))]    (49) The fourth volume issued by the Welsh Monuments Commission  (_Inventory of Ancient Monuments in the County of Denbigh_, H.M.  Stationery Office, 1914) enumerates the few Roman remains of  Denbighshire. The one important item is the group of tile and pottery  kilns lately excavated by Mr. A. Acton at Holt, eight miles south of  Chester, which I have described above (p. 15); the Commissioners' plan  of the site seems to have an incorrect scale. Chance finds, important  if not yet fully understood, have been found in British camps at  Pen-y-corddin, Moel Fenlli, Moel y Gaer, and especially at Parc-y-Meirch  or Dinorben (above, p. 28). Isolated coins have been found scantily--a  hoard of perhaps 6,000 Constantinian copper at Moel Fenlli, a gold coin  of Nero from the same hill, another coin of Nero at Llanarmon, 200-300  Constantinian at Llanelidan. A parcel of bronze 'cooking vessels' was  found near Abergele (Eph. Epigr. iii. 130) but has unfortunately  disappeared. The index also mentions coins under 'No. 458', which does  not appear in the volume itself. A Roman road probably ran across the  county from St. Asaph to Caerhyn (Canovium); its east end is pretty  certain, as far as Glascoed, though the 'Inventory' hardly makes this  clear.    (50) A partial plan and some views of the west gate of the Roman fort at  the Gaer, near Brecon, are given in the _Transactions of the Woolhope  Naturalists' Field Club_ for 1908-11.      _Scotland_    (51) The fifth Report of the Royal Commission on Ancient and  Historical Monuments in Scotland, _Inventory of Monuments in Galloway.  II. Stewartry of Kirkcudbright_ (Edinburgh, 1914) shows that the eastern  half of Galloway, like the western half described in the fourth Report  in 1912, contains nothing that can be called a 'Roman site' and very few  Roman remains of any sort. Indeed this eastern half, the land between  Dumfries and Newton Stewart, seems even poorer in such remains than the  district between Newton Stewart and the Irish Sea. Its only items are  some trifles of Samian, &c., found in the Borness Cave, and some iron  implements found in a bronze caldron in Carlingwark Loch. This result  is, of course, contrary to the views of older Scottish writers like  Skene, who talked of 'numerous Roman camps and stations' in Galloway,  but it will surprise no recent student. Probably the Romans never got  far west of a line roughly coinciding with that of the Caledonian  Railway from Carlisle by Carstairs to Glasgow. Their failure or omission  to hold the south-west weakened the left flank and rear of their  position on the Wall of Pius and helped materially to shorten their  dominion in Scotland in the second century.    (52) In the _Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland_  for 1913-4 (vol. xlviii) Mr. J. M. Corrie describes some polishers and  other small objects found casually at Newstead (p. 338), and Dr.  Macdonald expands (p. 395) the account of the Balcreggan hoard which he  had contributed to the _Scotsman_ (my Report for 1913, p. 11). Mr. A. O.  Curle (p. 161) records the discovery and exploration of a vitrified fort  at the Mote of Mark near Dalbeattie (Kirkcudbright), and the discovery  in it of two clearly Roman potsherds. The main body of the finds made  here seem to belong to the ninth century; whether any of them can be  earlier than has been thought, I am not competent to decide.    (53) The well-known and remarkable earthworks at Birrenswark, near  Lockerbie in Dumfriesshire, have long been explained as a Roman  circumvallation[13] or at least as siege-works round a native hill-fort.  In 1913 they were visited by Prof. Schulten, of Erlangen, the excavator  of a Roman circumvallation round the Spanish fortress of Numantia; they  naturally interested him, and he has now described them for German  readers (_Neue Jahrbuecher fuer das klassische Altertum_, xxxiii, 1914,  pp. 607-17) and added some remarks on their date. His description is  clear and readable; his chronological arguments are less satisfactory.  He adopts[14] the view generally adopted by English archaeologists  (except Roy) for the last two centuries, that these camps date from  Agricola; he supports this old conclusion by reasons which are in part  novel. I may summarize his position thus: Two Roman roads led from the  Tyne and the Solway to Caledonia, an eastern road by Corbridge and  Newstead, and a western one by Annandale and Upper Clydesdale. On the  eastern road, a little north of Newstead, is the camp of Channelkirk;  on the western are the three camps of Torwood Moor (near Lockerbie),  Tassie's Holm (north of Moffat), and Cleghorn in Clydesdale, near  Carstairs. These four camps are--so far as preserved--of the same size,  1,250 x 1,800 feet; they all have six gates (two in each of the longer  sides); they all have traverses in front of the gates; lastly, Torwood  Moor is fourteen Roman miles, a day's march, from Tassie's Holm, and  that is twenty-eight miles from Cleghorn. Plainly they belong to the  same date. Further, Agricola is the only Roman general who used both  eastern and western routes together; accordingly, these camps date from  him. Finally, as Birrenswark is near Torwood Moor, it too must be  Agricolan.    [Footnote 13: It is proper to add a warning that the traces of the  'circumvallation' are dim, and high authorities like Dr. Macdonald are  sceptical about them. The two camps are, however, certain, and there  must have been communication between them of some sort, if they were  occupied at the same time.]    [Footnote 14: No doubt it is by oversight that Dr. Schulten omits to  state that the view which he is supporting is the ordinary view and not  his own.]    Dr. Schulten has not advanced matters by this speculation. His first  point, that the four camps are coeval, and his reasons for that idea,  are mainly taken from Roy--he does not make this clear in his paper.  But he has not heeded Roy's warnings that the reasons are not cogent.  Actually, they are very weak. At Channelkirk, only two sides of a camp  remained in Roy's time; they measured not 1,250 x 1,800 feet but  1,330 x 1,660 feet, and the longer side had one gate in the middle,  not two; to-day, next to nothing is visible. At Tassie's Holm there  was only a corner of a perhaps quite small earthwork--not necessarily  Roman--and the distance to Torwood Moor is nearer twenty than fourteen  Roman miles. At Torwood Moor only one side, 1,780 feet long with two  gates, was clear in "]]]
