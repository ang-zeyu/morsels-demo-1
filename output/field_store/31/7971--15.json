Many Tantras and  Vishnuite works profess to be better suited to the present age than the  Vedas, and innumerable treatises in the vernacular are commonly accepted  as scripture.    Scriptures in India[62] are thought of as words not writings. It is the  sacred sound not a sacred book which is venerated. They are learnt by  oral transmission and it is rare to see a book used in religious  services. Diagrams accompanied by letters and a few words are credited  with magical powers, but still tantric spells are things to be recited  rather than written. This view of scripture makes the hearer uncritical.  The ordinary layman hears parts of a sacred book recited and probably  admires what he understands, but he has no means of judging of a book as  a whole, especially of its coherency and consistency.    The moral extravagance of Hinduism is more serious. It is kept in check  by the general conviction that asceticism, or at least temperance,  charity and self-effacement are the indispensable outward signs of  religion, but still among the great religions of the world there is none  which countenances so many hysterical, immoral and cruel rites. A  literary example will illustrate the position. It is taken from the  drama Madhava and Malati written about 730 A.D., but the incidents of  the plot might happen in any native state to-day, if European  supervision were removed. In it Madhava, a young Brahman, surprises a  priest of the goddess Chamunda who is about to immolate Malati. He kills  the priest and apparently the other characters consider his conduct  natural and not sacrilegious. But it is not suggested that either the  police or any ecclesiastical authority ought to prevent human  sacrifices, and the reason why Madhava was able to save his beloved from  death was that he had gone to the uncanny spot where such rites were  performed to make an offering of human flesh to demons.    In Buddhism religion and the moral law are identified, but not in  Hinduism. Brahmanical literature contains beautiful moral sayings,  especially about unselfishness and self-restraint, but the greatest  popular gods such as Vishnu and Siva are not identified with the moral  law. They are super-moral and the God of philosophy, who _is_ all  things, is also above good and evil. The aim of the philosophic saint is  not so much to choose the good and eschew evil as to draw nearer to God  by rising above both.    Indian literature as a whole has a strong ethical and didactic flavour,  yet the great philosophic and religious systems concern themselves  little with ethics. They discuss the nature of the external world and  other metaphysical questions which seem to us hardly religious: they  clearly feel a peculiar interest in defining the relation of the soul to  God, but they rarely ask why should I be good or what is the sanction of  morality. They are concerned less with sin than with ignorance: virtue  is indispensable, but without knowledge it is useless.      17. _The Hindu and Buddhist Scriptures_    The history and criticism of Hindu and Buddhist scriptures naturally  occupy some space in this work, but two general remarks may be made  here. First, the oldest scriptures are almost without exception  compilations, that is collections of utterances handed down by tradition  and arranged by later generations in some form which gives them apparent  unity. Thus the Rig Veda is obviously an anthology of hymns and some  three thousand years later the Granth or sacred book of the Sikhs was  compiled on the same principle. It consists of poems by Nanak, Kabir and  many other writers but is treated with extraordinary respect as a  continuous and consistent revelation. The Brahmanas and Upanishads are  not such obvious compilations yet on careful inspection the older[63]  ones will be found to be nothing else. Thus the Brihad Aranyaka  Upanishad, though possessing considerable coherency, is not only a  collection of such philosophic views as commended themselves to the  doctors of the Taittiriya school, but is formed by the union of three  such collections. Each of the first two collections ends with a list of  the teachers who handed it down and the third is openly called a  supplement. One long passage, the dialogue between Yajnavalkya and his  wife, is incorporated in both the first and the second collection. Thus  our text represents the period when the Taittiriyas brought their  philosophic thoughts together in a complete form, but that period was  preceded by another in which slightly different schools each had their  own collection and for some time before this the various maxims and  dialogues must have been current separately. Since the conversation  between Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi occurs in almost the same form in two  collections, it probably once existed as an independent piece.    In Buddhist literature the composite and tertiary character of the Sutta  Pitaka is equally plain. The various Nikayas are confessedly collections  of discourses. The two older ones seem dominated by the desire to bring  before the reader the image of the Buddha preaching: the Samyutta and  Anguttara emphasize the doctrine rather than the teacher and arrange  much the same matter under new headings. But it is clear that in  whatever form the various sermons, dialogues and dissertations appear,  that form is not primary but presupposes compilers dealing with an oral  tradition already stereotyped in language. For long passages such as the  tract on morality and the description of progress in the religious life  occur in several discourses and the amount of matter common to different  Suttas and Nikayas is surprising. Thus nearly the whole of the long  Sutta describing the Buddha's last days and death[64], which at first  sight seems to be a connected narrative somewhat different from other  Suttas, is found scattered in other parts of the Canon.    Thus our oldest texts whether Brahmanic or Buddhist are editions and  codifications, perhaps amplifications, of a considerably older oral  teaching. They cannot be treated as personal documents similar to the  Koran or the Epistles of Paul.    The works of middle antiquity such as the Epics, Puranas, and Mahayanist  sutras were also not produced by one author. Many of them exist in more  than one recension and they usually consist of a nucleus enveloped and  sometimes itself affected by additions which may exceed the original  matter in bulk. The Mahabharata and Prajnaparamita are not books in the  European sense: we cannot give a date or a table of contents for the  first edition[65]: they each represent a body of literature whose  composition extended over a long period. As time goes on, history  naturally grows clearer and literary personalities become more distinct,  yet the later Puranas are not attributed to human authors and were  susceptible of interpolation even in recent times. Thus the story of  Genesis has been incorporated in the Bhavishya Purana, apparently after  Protestant missionaries had begun to preach in India.    The other point to which I would draw attention is the importance of  relatively modern works, which supersede the older scriptures,  especially in Hinduism. This phenomenon is common in many countries, for  only a few books such as the Bhagavad-gita, the Gospels and the sayings  of Confucius have a portion of the eternal and universal sufficient to  outlast the wear and tear of a thousand years. Vedic literature is far  from being discredited in India, though some Tantras say openly that it  is useless. It still has a place in ritual and is appealed to by  reforming sects. But to see Hinduism in proper perspective we must  remember that from the time of the Buddha till now, the composition of  religious literature in India has been almost uninterrupted and that  almost every century has produced works accepted by some sect as  infallible scripture. For most Vishnuites the Bhagavad-gita is the  beginning of sacred literature and the Narayaniya[66] is also held in  high esteem: the philosophy of each sect is usually determined by a  commentary on the Brahma Sutras: the Bhagavata Purana (perhaps in a  vernacular paraphrase) and the Ramayana of Tulsi Das are probably the  favourite reading of the laity and for devotional purposes may be  supplemented by a collection of hymns such as the Namghosha, copies of  which actually receive homage in Assam. The average man--even the average  priest--regards all these as sacred works without troubling himself with  distinctions as to _sruti_ and _smriti_, and the Vedas and Upanishads  are hardly within his horizon.    In respect of sacred literature Buddhism is more conservative than  Hinduism, or to put it another way, has been less productive in the last  fifteen hundred years. The Hinayanists are like those Protestant sects  which still profess not to go beyond the Bible. The monks read the  Abhidhamma and the laity the Suttas, though perhaps both are disposed to  use extracts and compendiums rather than the full ancient texts. Among  the Mahayanists the ancient Vinaya and Nikayas exist only as literary  curiosities. The former is superseded by modern manuals, the latter by  Mahayanist Sutras such as the Lotus and the Happy Land, which are  however of respectable antiquity. As in India, each sect selects rather  arbitrarily a few books for its own use, without condemning others but  also without according to them the formal recognition received by the  Old and New Testaments among Christians.    No Asiatic country possesses so large a portion of the critical spirit  as China. The educated Chinese, however much they may venerate their  classics, think of them as we think of the masterpieces of Greek  literature, aS texts which may contain wrong readings, interpolations  and lacunae, which owe whatever authority they possess to the labours of  the scholars who collected, arranged and corrected them. This attitude  is to some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15262"],[0,"Christianity and Islam in Spain, A.D. 756-1031 (#15)"],[1,"was not objections brought by fellow-Christians only that  Eulogius took upon himself to answer, but also the taunts and scoffs of  the Moslems. \"Why,\" said they, \"if your God is the true God, does He not  strike terror into the executioners of his saints by some great  prodigy? and why do not the martyrs themselves flash forth into miracles  while the crowd is round them? You rush upon your own destruction, and  yet you work no wonders that might induce us to change our opinion of  your creed, thereby doing your own side no good, and ours no harm.\"[1]    Yet the constancy of the martyrs affected the Moslems more than they  cared to confess, as we may infer from the taunts levelled at the  Christians, when, in Mohammed's reign, some Christians, from fear of  death, even apostatized. \"Whither,\" they triumphantly asked,[2] \"has  that bravery of your martyrs vanished? What has become of the rash  frenzy with which they courted death?\" Yet though they affected to  consider the martyrs as fools or madmen, they could not be blind to the  effect that their constancy was likely to produce on those who beheld  their death, and to the reverence with which their relics were regarded  by the Christians. They therefore expressly forbade the bodies of  martyrs to be preserved[3] and worshipped, and did their best to make  this in certain cases impossible by burning the corpses and scattering  the ashes on the river, though sometimes they contented themselves with  throwing the bodies, unburnt, into the stream.

[3] See \"De Translatione corporum Sanctorum Martyrum,\" etc.,      sec. 11. \"Non enim, quos martyres faciunt, venerari Saraceni      permittunt.\" See above, p. 38. The bodies of earlier martyrs      were more freely given up at the request of the Christians. See      \"Chron. Silen.,\" secs. 95-100; Dozy, iv. 119, for the surrender      of the body of Justus; and Eul., \"Ad Wiliesindum,\" sec. 9,      where Eulogius mentions that he had taken the bodies of Saints      Zoilus and Austus to Pampluna. Later, Hakem II. (961-976) gave      up the body of the boy Pelagius at Ramiro III.'s request.      Mariana, viii. 5.    However, in spite of these regulations, many bodies were secretly  carried off and entombed in churches, where they were looked upon as  the most precious of possessions; and martyrs, who, by the admission of  their admirers themselves, had never worked any miracles when living,  were enabled, when dead, to perform a series of extraordinary ones,  which did not finally cease till modern enlightenment had dissipated the  darkness of the Middle Ages.    We happen to possess a very interesting account of the circumstances  under which the relics of three of these Cordovan martyrs were  transferred from the troubled scene of their passion to the more  peaceful and more superstitious cloisters of France.[1]    It was in 858 that Hilduin, the abbot of the monastery of St Vincent and  the Holy Cross, near Paris, learning that the body of their patron  saint, St Vincent, was at Valencia, sent two monks, Usuard and Odilard,  with the king's[2] permission, to procure the precious relics for their  own monastery. On their way to perform this commission, the monks learnt  that the body was no longer at Valencia. It had been, in fact,  carried[3] by a monk named Andaldus to Saragoza. Senior, the bishop of  that city, had seized it, and it was still held in veneration there, but  under the name of St Marinus, whose body the monk had stoutly asserted  it to be. Senior apparently doubted the statement, and tortured Andaldus  to get the truth out of him, but in vain; for the monk, knowing that St  Vincent had been deacon of Saragoza, feared that the bishop would never  surrender the body if aware of its identity. However, Usuard and Odilard  knew not but that the body was that of Marinus, as stated.

[3] \"Under a divine impulse,\" as usual.    Disappointed, therefore, in their errand, they lingered about at  Barcelona, thinking to pick up some other relics, when a friend, holding  a high position in that town, Sunifridus by name, mentioned the  persecution at Cordova, news of which does not seem to have travelled  beyond Spain. They determine at once to go to Cordova, relying on a  friend there, named Leovigild, to help them to obtain what they wished.  Travelling in Spain, however, seems to have been by no means safe[1] at  this period, and their bold resolution is regarded with fear and  admiration by their friends. The lord of the Gothic marches, Hunifrid,  being on friendly terms with the Wali of Saragoza, writes to him on  their behalf, and he entrusts them to the care of a caravan which  chanced to be just starting for Cordova.        [1] See sec. 2, and Eul., \"Ad Wiliesindum,\" where he speaks of      the road to Gaul as \"stipata praedonibus,\" and of all Gothia as      \"perturbata funeroso Wilihelmi incursu.\"    On reaching Cordova, after many days, they go to St Cyprian's Church,  where lay the bodies of John and Adulphus. The rumour of their arrival  brings Leovigild (called Abad Salomes), who proves a very useful friend,  and Samson, who just at this juncture is made abbot of the monastery at  Pegnamellar, where the bodies of George, Aurelius, and Sabigotha were  buried--the very relics which they had decided to try and obtain.    The monks of the monastery naturally object to parting with such  precious possessions, but Samson contrives to get the bishop's  permission to give up the bodies.    This was all the more opportune, as a chance was now given them of  returning to Barcelona, by joining the expedition which Mohammed I. was  on the point of making against Toledo. Orders had been given that all  the inhabitants, strangers as well as citizens, except the city guard,  should go out with the King. However, the Frankish monks were met by an  unexpected difficulty. In the temporary absence of the abbot, the monks  of Pegnamellar refused to give up the relics, and it was only with much  difficulty that the bishop Saul was induced to confirm his former  permission to remove them.    The bodies were now exhumed without the knowledge of the Moslems, and  sealed with Charles' own seal, brought for that purpose. George's body  was found whole, but of the other two, only the head of Nathalia, and  the trunk of Aurelius' body. The two latter are united to form one  corpse, as it is written, \"they two shall be one flesh.\" After a stay in  Cordova of eight weeks, they set out under the protection of some  Christians serving in the army. Leovigild, who had been away on the  King's business, now returns, and escorts them to Toledo. The approach  of the army having cleared away the brigands who infested those parts,  the monks with their precious freight got safely away to Saragoza, and  returned with their booty to France, where the relics worked numbers of  astonishing miracles.    Let us return from this digression to the steps taken by the moderate  party among the Christians, and by the Moslem authorities, to put an end  to what seemed so dangerous an agitation. That Reccafredus was not the  only ecclesiastic of high position who took exception to the new  movement we learn clearly enough from Alvar,[1] who tells us that  \"bishops, priests, deacons, and 'wise men' of Cordova joined in  inveighing against the new martyrdoms, under the impulse of fear  wellnigh denying the faith of Christ, if not in words, yet by their  acts.\" We may, therefore, conclude that the greater part of the  ecclesiastical authorities were heart and soul with the Bishop of  Seville, while the party led by Eulogius and Saul was a comparatively  small one. However, strong measures were necessary, and Reccafredus did  not hesitate to imprison several priests and clergy.[2] Eulogius  complains that the churches were deprived of their ministers, and the  customary church rites were in abeyance, \"while the spider wove her web  in the deserted aisles, tenanted only by a dreadful silence.\" In this  passage the writer doubtless gives reins to his imagination, yet there  must have been a certain amount of truth in the main assertion, for he  repeats it again and again.[3]    The evidence of Alvar is to the same effect: \"Have not those who seemed  to be columns of the church, the very rocks on which it is founded, who  were deemed the elect of God, have they not, I say, in the presence of  these Cynics, or rather of these Epicureans, under no compulsion, but of  their own free will, spoken evil of the martyrs of God? Have not the  shepherds of Christ, the teachers of the Church, bishops, abbots,  priests, the chiefs of our hierarchy, and its mighty men, publicly  denounced the martyrs of our Church as heretics?\"[4]        [1] \"Life of Eulog.,\" ch. i. sec. 4.        [2] Alvar, \"Life of Eulog.,\" ii. sec. 4--\"Omnes sacerdotes quos      potuit carcerali vinculo alligavit.\" Eul., \"Doc. Martyr,\" sec.      11--\"Repleta sunt penetralia carceris clericorum catervis,      viduata est ecclesia sacro praesulum et sacerdotum officio ...      privata prorsus ecclesia omni sacro ministerio.\" Alvar, \"Ind.

Not content with imprisoning the fanatics, the party of order forced  them to swear that they would not snatch at the martyr's palm by  speaking evil of the Prophet.[1] Those who disobeyed were threatened  with unheard-of penalties, "]]]
