Wafler irons are required and can be obtained at any good ironmongers  of the Hebrew persuasion.           *       *       *       *       *    LAMPLICH.    Take half a pound of currants, the same quantity of raisins and sugar,  a little citron, ground cloves and cinnamon, with eight apples finely  chopped; mix all together, then have ready a rich puff paste cut into  small triangles, fill them with the fruit like puffs, and lay them in  a deep dish, let the pieces be placed closely, and when the dish is  full, pour over one ounce of fresh butter melted in a tea-cup full of  clarified sugar, flavoured with essence of lemon, and bake in an oven  not too brisk.           *       *       *       *       *    STAFFIN.    This is composed of the fruit, &c., prepared as above, but the dish  is lined with the paste, and the fruit laid in alternate layers with  paste till the dish is filled; the paste must form the top layer,  clarified sugar is poured over before it is put into the oven.           *       *       *       *       *    RICE FRITTERS.    Boil half a pound of rice, in a small quantity of water, to a jelly;  let it cool, and beat it up with six eggs, three spoonsful of flour, a  little grated lemon peel, fry like fritters, either in butter or oil,  and serve with white sugar sifted over them.           *       *       *       *       *    LEMON TART.    Grate the peel of six lemons, add the juice of one, with a quarter of  a pound of pounded almonds, a quarter of a pound of preserved lemon  and orange peel, half a pound of powdered white sugar, and six eggs  well beaten, mix all together, and bake in a dish lined with a fine  pastry.           *       *       *       *       *    ANOTHER WAY.    Slice six lemons and lay them in sugar all night, then mix with them  two savoy biscuits, three ounces of orange and lemon peel, three  ounces of ground almonds, one ounce of whole almonds blanched, and  bake in a dish lined with pastry. Orange tarts are prepared in the  same way, substituting oranges for the lemons.           *       *       *       *       *    ALMOND RICE.    Boil half a pound of whole rice in milk until soft, beat it through  a sieve, set it on the fire, with sugar according to taste, a few  pounded sweet almonds and a few slices of citron; when it has simmered  a short time, let it cool; place it in a mould, and when sufficiently  firm turn it out, stick it with blanched almonds, and pour over a fine  custard. This may be made without milk, and by increasing the quantity  of almonds will be found exceedingly good.           *       *       *       *       *    ALMOND PASTE.    Blanch half a pound of fine almonds, pound them to a paste, a few  drops of water are necessary to be added, from time to time, or they  become oily; then mix thoroughly with it half a pound of white sifted  sugar, put it into a preserving pan, and let them simmer very gently  until they become dry enough not to stick to a clean spoon when  touched; it must be constantly stirred.           *       *       *       *       *    RICE FRUIT TARTS.    For persons who dislike pastry, the following is an excellent way of  preparing fruit. Boil in milk some whole rice till perfectly soft,  sweeten with white sugar, and when nearly cold, line a dish with it,  have ready some currants, raspberries, cherries, or any other fruit,  which must have been previously stewed and sweetened, fill the dish  with it; beat up the whites of three eggs to a froth, mixed with a  little white sugar, and lay over the top, and place it in the oven for  half an hour.           *       *       *       *       *    BREAD FRUIT TARTS.    Line a dish with thin slices of bread, then lay the fruit with brown  sugar in alternate layers, with slices of bread; when the dish is  filled, pour over half a tea-cup full of water, and let the top be  formed of thin pieces of bread thickly strewed over with brown sugar,  bake until thoroughly done.           *       *       *       *       *    RICE CUSTARD.    This is a very innocent and nutritive custard. Take two ounces of  whole rice and boil it in three pints of milk until it thickens, then  add half a pound of pounded sweet almonds, and sweeten to taste; a  stick of cinnamon and a piece of lemon peel should be boiled in it,  and then taken out.           *       *       *       *       *    CREME BRUN.    Boil a large cup of cream, flavor with essence of almonds and  cinnamon, and then mix with it the yolk of three eggs, carefully  beaten and strained, stirring one way to keep it smooth; place it on a  dish in small heaps, strew over powdered sugar and beaten almonds, and  brown with a salamander.           *       *       *       *       *    PANCAKES.    Mix a light batter of eggs with flour and milk or water, fry in  boiling butter or clarified suet; they may be fried without butter or  fat, by putting more eggs and a little cream, the pan must be very  dry and clean; those fried without butter are very delicate and  fashionable, they should be fried of the very lightest colour; they  are good also made of rice, which must be boiled in milk till quite  tender; then beat up with eggs, and flavoured according to taste, and  fried like other pancakes.           *       *       *       *       *    PANCAKES FOR CHILDREN.    Take a pint of finely grated bread crumbs, simmer in a little milk  and water, flavour with cinnamon or lemon peel grated, add a couple of  beaten eggs, and sweeten to taste, drop a small quantity into the pan  and fry like pancakes.           *       *       *       *       *    A NICE RICE PUDDING FOR CHILDREN.    Boil till tender half a pound of well picked rice in one quart of  fresh milk, sweeten with white sugar, and flavour with whole cinnamon,  lemon peel, and a bay leaf; when the rice is tender, place it in a  deep dish, pour over a very little butter warmed in a little milk,  and bake until brown; a slow oven is requisite unless the rice is  extremely soft before it is put in the oven.           *       *       *       *       *    A RICH BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING.    Lay in a deep dish alternate layers of bread and butter cut from a  French roll, and the following mixture: the yolks of four eggs beaten,  four ounces of moist sugar, a few soaked ratafias, a table-spoonful  of brandy and a few currants; fill up the dish with these layers, and  pour over a little milk, the last layer should be of bread and butter,  the whites of the eggs beaten to a froth may, if an elegant appearance  is wished for, be laid over the top when the pudding is nearly baked.           *       *       *       *       *    A CHERRY BATTER PUDDING.    Stone and pick some fine cherries, put them into a buttered mould,  and pour over them a fine batter well sweetened, tie over the mould  closely, and boil one hour and a half; serve with sweet sauce. This  is a delicious pudding; plums or damsons are sometimes used instead of  cherries.           *       *       *       *       *    CUMBERLAND PUDDING.    Take equal quantities of bread crumbs, apples finely chopped, currants  and shred suet, sweeten with brown sugar, and mix all together with  three eggs, a little brandy, grated nutmeg, and lemon peel; boil in  a round mould from one to two hours, according to the size of the  pudding.           *       *       *       *       *    COLLEGE PUDDING.    These are made in a similar way to Cumberland pudding, with the  omission of the apples, they are made in balls, and fried or baked in  cups. A sweet sauce is served with them.           *       *       *       *       *    PLUM PUDDING.    To one pound of currants add one pound of raisins, one pound of shred  suet, one pound flour (or half a pound bread crumbs and half a pound  of flour), a quarter of a pound of candied orange and lemon peel,  a little citron cut thin, half a pound of moist sugar; mix all well  together as each article is added, then stir in six beaten eggs and a  glass of brandy, beat the pudding well for half an hour, let it stand  some time, then put it into a basin and boil six or seven hours in  plenty of water; it should be seasoned according to taste with ginger,  nutmeg, cloves, &c. Serve with sifted sugar or whites of eggs beaten  to a froth.           *       *       *       *       *    RATAFIA PUDDING.    Soak the crumb of a French roll and half a pound of ratafia cakes in  milk or cream, then mix with them three ounces of warmed fresh butter,  the yolks of five and the whites of two eggs, sweeten to taste; add  one ounce of pounded almonds, and a few bitter almonds, boil in a  shape lined with dried cherries, or bake in a cake-tin first well  buttered, and sprinkled with bread crumbs.           *       *       *       *       *    PASSOVER PUDDING.    Mix equal quantities of biscuit powder and shred suet, half the  quantity of currants and raisins, a little spice and sugar, with an  ounce of candied peels, and fine well beaten eggs; make these into  a stiff batter, and boil well, and serve with a sweet sauce. This  pudding is excellent baked in a pudding tin, it must be turned out  when served.           *       *       *       *       *    ANOTHER SORT.    Mix the various ingredients above-named, substituting for the raisins,  apples minced finely, add a larger proportion of sugar, and either  boil or bake.           *       *       *       *       *    ANOTHER SORT.    Mix into a batter a cup full of biscuit powder, with a little milk and  a couple of eggs, to which add three ounces of sugar, two of warmed  butter, a little shred of lemon peel, and a table-spoonful of rum;  pour the mixture into a mould, and boil or bake.           *       *       * "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1233"],[0,"The Origin and Nature of the Emotions; Miscellaneous Papers (#15)"],[1," in the physical care of her child.  With this clue we can find the explanation of many phenomena.  We can  understand why laughter and crying are so frequently interchangeable;  why they often blend and why either gives a sense of relief;  we can understand why either laughter or crying can come only  when the issue that causes the integration is determined; we can  understand the extraordinary tendency to laughter that discloses  the unspoken sentiments of love; we can understand the tears  of the woman when she receives a proposal of marriage from the man  she loves; we can understand why any averted circumstance,  such as a threatened breach of the conventions, which would have led  to embarrassment or humiliation, leads to a tendency to laughter;  and why the recital of heroic deeds by association leads to tears,  On the other hand, under the domination of acute diseases,  of acute fear, or of great exhaustion, there is usually neither  laughter nor crying because the nervous system is under the control  of a dominating influence as a result of which the body is so  exhausted that the excess of energy which alone can produce laughing  or crying is lacking.    A remarkable study of the modification of laughter and crying by disease  is found in that most interesting of diseases--exophthalmic goiter.  In this disease there is a low threshold to all stimuli.  That the very motor mechanism of which we have been speaking  is involved, is shown by an enormous increase in its activity.  There is also an increase in the size of certain at least of the  activating glands--the thyroid and the adrenals are enlarged and overactive  and the glycogen-producing function of the liver is stimulated.  The most striking phenomenon of this disease, however, is the remarkable  lowering of the brain thresholds to stimuli.  In other words,  in Graves' disease the nervous system and the activating glands--  the entire motor mechanism--are in an exalted state of activity.    If this be true, then these patients should exhibit behavior  precisely contrary to that of those suffering from acute infection,  that is, they should be constantly clearing their systems of  these superabundant energizing materials by crying or laughing,  and this is precisely what happens--the flood-gates of tears are open  much of the time in Graves' disease--a disease of the emotions.    We have already interpreted pain as a phenomenon of motor activity.  When pain does not lead to muscular activity it therefore frequently  leads to crying or to moaning, just as tickling, which is equally  an incentive to motor activity, results in laughter if it does  not find full expression in action.    From the foregoing we infer that pain, the intense motor response  to tickling, and emotional excitation are all primitive biologic  reactions for the good of the individual, and that all have  their origin in the operation of the great laws of evolution.  If to this inference we add the physiologic dictum that the nervous  system always acts as a whole, and that it can respond to but one  stimulus at a time, we can easily understand that while diverse  causes may integrate the nervous system for a specific action,  if the cause be suddenly removed, then the result of the  integration of the nervous system may be, not a specific action,  but an undesigned muscular action, such as crying or laughter.  Hence it is that laughter and crying may be evoked by diverse  exciting causes.  The intensity of the laughter or of the crying  depends upon the intensity of the stimulus and the dynamic state  of the individual.    The linking together of these apparently widely separated phenomena  by the simple law of the discharge of energy by association perhaps  explains the association of an abnormal tendency to tears with an  abnormally low threshold for pain (Fig. 36). In the neurasthenic,  tears and pain are produced with abnormal facility.  Hence it is that,  if a patient about to undergo a surgical operation is in a state of fear  and dread before the operation, the threshold to all stimuli is lowered,  and this lowered threshold will continue throughout the operation,  even under inhalation anesthesia, because the stimulus produced by  cutting sensitive tissue is transmitted to the brain just as readily  as if the patient were not anesthetized.  In like manner, the brain  may be sensitized by the administration of large doses of thyroid  extract prior to operation, the threshold to injury in such a case  continuing to be low to traumatic stimuli even under anesthesia.  Under the sensitizing influences of thyroid extract or of Graves'  disease the effect of an injury, of an operation, or of emotional  excitation is heightened.  The extent to which the threshold to pain  or to any other excitant is affected by Graves' disease is illustrated  by the almost fatal reaction which I once saw result from the mere  pricking with a hypodermic needle of a patient with this disease.  As the result of a visit from a friend, the pulse-rate of a victim of this  disease may increase twenty beats and his temperature rise markedly.  I have seen the mere suggestion of an operation produce collapse.  As the brain is thus remarkably sensitized in Graves' disease, we find  that in these patients laughter, crying, emotional disturbances,  and surgical shock are produced with remarkable facility.    I hope that even this admittedly crude and imperfect consideration  of this subject will suggest the possibility of establishing  a practical viewpoint as to the origin and purpose of pain,  of tickling, and of such expressions of emotion as laughter and crying,  and that it may help us to understand their significance in health  and in disease.        THE RELATION BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL STATE OF THE BRAIN-CELLS AND  BRAIN FUNCTIONS--EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL[*]    [*] Address before The American Philosophical Society, April 18, 1913.      The brain in all animals (including man) is but the clearing-house  for reactions to environment, for animals are essentially motor  or neuromotor mechanisms, composed of many parts, it is true,  but integrated by the nervous system.  Throughout the phylogenetic history  of the race the stimuli of environment have driven this mechanism,  whose seat of power--the battery--is the brain.    Since all normal life depends upon the response of the brain  to the daily stimuli, we should expect in health, as well  as in disease, to find modifications of the functions and the  physical state of the component parts of this central battery--  the brain-cells. Although we must believe, then, that every  reaction to stimuli, however slight, produces a corresponding  change in the brain-cells, yet there are certain normal, that is,  non-diseased, conditions which produce especially striking changes.  The cell changes due to the emotions, for example, are so similar,  and in extreme conditions approach so closely to the changes produced  by disease, that it is impossible to say where the normal ceases  and the abnormal begins.    In view of the similarity of brain-cell changes it is not strange  that in the clinic as well as in daily life, we are confronted  constantly by outward manifestations which are so nearly  identical that the true underlying cause of the condition in  any individual case is too often overlooked or misunderstood.  In our laboratory experiments and in our clinical observations  we have found that exhaustion produced by intense emotion,  prolonged physical exertion, insomnia, intense fear, certain toxemias,  hemorrhage, and the condition commonly denominated surgical shock,  produce similar outward manifestations and identical brain-cell changes.    It is, therefore, the purpose of this paper to present the definite  results of laboratory researches which show certain relations  between alterations in brain functions and physical changes  in the brain-cells.    Fear.--Our experiments have shown that the brain-cell changes due  to fear may be divided into two stages:  First, that of hyperchromatism--  stimulation; second, that of hypochromatism--exhaustion (Figs. 5 and  13). Hyperchromatism was shown only in the presence of the activating  stimuli or within a very short time after they had been received.  This state gradually changed until the period of maximum exhaustion  was reached--about six hours later.  Then a process of reconstruction  began and continued until the normal state was again reached.    Fatigue.--Fatigue from overexertion produced in the brain-cells  like changes to those produced by fear, these changes being  proportional to the amount of exertion (Fig. 4). In the extreme  stage of exhaustion from this cause we found that the total  quantity of Nissl substance was enormously reduced.  When the exertion was too greatly prolonged, it took weeks or  months for the cells to be restored to their normal condition.  We have proved, therefore, that in exhaustion resulting from emotion  or from physical work a certain number of the brain-cells are  permanently lost.  This is the probable explanation of the fact  that an athlete or a race-horse trained to the point of highest  efficiency can reach his maximum record but once in his life.  Under certain conditions, however, it is possible that, though some  chromatin is forever lost, the remainder may be so remarkably developed  that for a time at least it will compensate for that which is gone.    Hemorrhage.--The loss of blood from any cause, if sufficient to reduce  the blood-pressure, will occasion a change in the brain-cells, provided  that the period of hypotension lasts for more than five minutes.  This time limit is a safeguard against permanent injury  from the temporary hypotension which causes one to faint.  If the hemorrhage be long continued and the blood-pressure be low,  there will be a permanent loss of some of the brain-cells. This  explains why an individual who has suffered from a"]]]
