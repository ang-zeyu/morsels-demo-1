CHAPTER VIII.    THE DEGENERACY OF ALCHEMY.      I have tried to show that alchemy aimed at giving experimental proof  of a certain theory of the whole system of nature, including humanity.  The practical culmination of the alchemical quest presented a  threefold aspect; the alchemists sought the stone of wisdom, for by  gaining that they gained the control of wealth; they sought the  universal panacea, for that would give them the power of enjoying  wealth and life; they sought the soul of the world, for thereby they  could hold communion with spiritual existences, and enjoy the fruition  of spiritual life.    The object of their search was to satisfy their material needs, their  intellectual capacities, and their spiritual yearnings. The alchemists  of the nobler sort always made the first of these objects subsidiary  to the other two; they gave as their reason for desiring to make gold,  the hope that gold might become so common that it would cease to be  sought after by mankind. The author of _An Open Substance_ says:  \"Would to God ... all men might become adepts in our art, for then  gold, the common idol of mankind, would lose its value, and we should  prize it only for its scientific teaching.\"    But the desire to make gold must always have been a very powerful  incentive in determining men to attempt the laborious discipline of  alchemy; and with them, as with all men, the love of money was the  root of much evil. When a man became a student of alchemy merely for  the purpose of making gold, and failed to make it--as he always  did--it was very easy for him to pretend he had succeeded in order  that he might really make gold by cheating other people. Such a man  rapidly degenerated into a charlatan; he used the language of alchemy  to cover his frauds, and with the hope of deluding his dupes by  high-sounding phrases. And, it must be admitted, alchemy lent itself  admirably to imposture. It promised unlimited wealth; it encouraged  the wildest dreams of the seeker after pleasure; and over these dreams  it cast the glamour of great ideas, the idea of the unity of nature,  and the idea of communion with other spheres of life, of calling in  the help of 'inheritors of unfulfilled renown,' and so it seemed to  touch to fine issues the sordidness of unblushing avarice.    Moreover, the working with strange ingredients and odd-fashioned  instruments, and the employment of mouth-filling phrases, and scraps  of occult learning which seemed to imply unutterable things, gave just  that pleasing dash of would-be wickedness to the process of consulting  the alchemist which acts as a fascination to many people. The earnest  person felt that by using the skill and knowledge of the alchemists,  for what he deemed a good purpose, he was compelling the powers of  evil to work for him and his objects.    It was impossible that such a system as alchemy should appear to the  plain man of the middle ages, when the whole scheme of life and the  universe rested on a magical basis, to be more than a kind of magic  which hovered between the black magic of the Sorcerer and the white  magic of the Church. Nor is it to be wondered at that a system which  lends itself to imposture so easily as alchemy did, should be thought  of by the plain man of modern times as having been nothing but a  machinery of fraud.    It is evident from the _Canon's Yeoman's Tale_ in Chaucer, that many  of those who professed to turn the base metals into gold were held in  bad repute as early as the 14th century. The \"false chanoun\" persuaded  the priest, who was his dupe, to send his servant for quicksilver,  which he promised to make into \"as good silver and as fyn, As ther is  any in youre purse or myn\"; he then gave the priest a \"crosselet,\" and  bid him put it on the fire, and blow the coals. While the priest was  busy with the fire,          This false chanoun--the foule feend hym fecche!--        Out of his bosom took a bechen cole,        In which ful subtilly was maad an hole,        And therinne put was of silver lemaille        An ounce, and stopped was withouten faille        The hole with wex, to kepe the lemaille in.    The \"false chanoun\" pretended to be sorry for the priest, who was so  busily blowing the fire:--          Ye been right hoot, I se wel how ye swete;        Have heer a clooth, and wipe awey the we't.        And whyles that the preest wiped his face,        This chanoun took his cole with harde grace,        And leyde it above, upon the middeward        Of the crosselet, and blew wel afterward.        Til that the coles gonne faste brenne.    As the coal burned the silver fell into the \"crosselet.\" Then the  canon said they would both go together and fetch chalk, and a pail of  water, for he would pour out the silver he had made in the form of an  ingot. They locked the door, and took the key with them. On returning,  the canon formed the chalk into a mould, and poured the contents of  the crucible into it. Then he bade the priest,          Look what ther is, put in thin hand and grope,        Thow fynde shalt ther silver, as I hope.        What, devel of helle! Sholde it ellis be?        Shavyng of silver silver is, _parde!_        He putte his hand in, and took up a teyne        Of silver fyn, and glad in every veyne        Was this preest, when he saugh that it was so.    The conclusion of the _Canon's Yeoman's Tale_ shows that, in the 14th  century, there was a general belief in the possibility of finding the  philosopher's stone, and effecting the transmutation, although the  common practitioners of the art were regarded as deceivers. A disciple  of Plato is supposed to ask his master to tell him the \"name of the  privee stoon.\" Plato gives him certain directions, and tells him he  must use _magnasia_; the disciple asks--          'What is Magnasia, good sire, I yow preye?'        'It is a water that is maad, I seye,        Of elementes foure,' quod Plato.        'Telle me the roote, good sire,' quod he tho,        Of that water, if it be youre wille.'        'Nay, nay,' quod Plato, 'certein that I nylle;        The philosophres sworn were everychoon        That they sholden discovers it unto noon,        Ne in no book it write in no manere,        For unto Crist it is so lief and deere,        That he wol nat that it discovered bee,        But where it liketh to his deitee        Man for tenspire, and eek for to deffende        Whom that hym liketh; lo, this is the ende.'    The belief in the possibility of alchemy seems to have been general  sometime before Chaucer wrote; but that belief was accompanied by the  conviction that alchemy was an impious pursuit, because the  transmutation of baser metals into gold was regarded as trenching on  the prerogative of the Creator, to whom alone this power rightfully  belonged. In his _Inferno_ (which was probably written about the year  1300), Dante places the alchemists in the eighth circle of hell, not  apparently because they were fraudulent impostors, but because, as one  of them says, \"I aped creative nature by my subtle art.\"    In later times, some of those who pretended to have the secret and to  perform great wonders by the use of it, became rich and celebrated,  and were much sought after. The most distinguished of these  pseudo-alchemists was he who passed under the name of Cagliostro. His  life bears witness to the eagerness of human beings to be deceived.    Joseph Balsamo was born in 1743 at Palermo, where his parents were  tradespeople in a good way of business.[5] In the memoir of himself,  which he wrote in prison, Balsamo seeks to surround his birth and  parentage with mystery; he says, \"I am ignorant, not only of my  birthplace, but even of the parents who bore me.... My earliest  infancy was passed in the town of Medina, in Arabia, where I was  brought up under the name of Acharat.\"       [5] The account of the life of Cagliostro is much condensed     from Mr A.E. Waite's _Lives of the Alchemystical Philosophers_.    When he was thirteen years of age, Balsamo's parents determined he  should be trained for the priesthood, but he ran away from his school.  He was then confined in a Benedictine monastery. He showed a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14226"],[0,"Lobo, Rag and Vixen (#15)"],[1,"the foxes wanted. Vixen had kept out of sight, but now ran  swiftly to the stump and hid behind it. Scarface had kept straight on,  going very slowly. The woodchuck had not been frightened, so before long  his head popped up between the roots and he looked around. There was  that fox still going on, farther and farther away. The woodchuck grew  bold as the fox went, and came out farther, and then seeing the coast  clear, he scrambled onto the stump, and with one spring Vixen had him  and shook him till he lay senseless. Scarface had watched out of the  corner of his eye and now came running back. But Vixen took the chuck in  her jaws and made for the den, so he saw he wasn't needed.    Back to the den came Vix, and carried the chuck so carefully that he was  able to struggle a little when she got there. A low '_woof_' at the den  brought the little fellows out like school-boys to play. She threw the  wounded animal to them and they set on him like four little furies,  uttering little growls and biting little bites with all the strength of  their baby jaws, but the woodchuck fought for his life and beating them  off slowly hobbled to the shelter of a thicket. The little ones pursued  like a pack of hounds and dragged at his tail and flanks, but could not  hold him back. So Vix overtook him with a couple of bounds and dragged  him again into the open for the children to worry. Again and again this  rough sport went on till one of the little ones was badly bitten, and  his squeal of pain roused Vix to end the woodchuck's misery and serve  him up at once.    Not far from the den was a hollow overgrown with coarse grass, the  playground of a colony of field-mice. The earliest lesson in woodcraft  that the little ones took, away from the den, was in this hollow. Here  they had their first course of mice, the easiest of all game. In  teaching, the main thing was example, aided by a deep-set instinct. The  old fox, also, had one or two signs meaning \"lie still and watch,\"  \"come, do as I do,\" and so on, that were much used.    So the merry lot went to this hollow one calm evening and Mother Fox  made them lie still in the grass. Presently a faint squeak showed that  the game was astir. Vix rose up and went on tip-toe into the grass--not  crouching, but as high as she could stand, sometimes on her hind legs so  as to get a better view. The runs that the mice follow are hidden under  the grass tangle, and the only way to know the whereabouts of a mouse is  by seeing the slight shaking of the grass, which is the reason why mice  are hunted only on calm days.    And the trick is to locate the mouse and seize him first and see him  afterward. Vix soon made a spring, and in the middle of the bunch of  dead grass that she grabbed was a field-mouse squeaking his last squeak.    He was soon gobbled, and the four awkward little foxes tried to do the  same as their mother, and when at length the eldest for the first time  in his life caught game, he quivered with excitement and ground his  pearly little milk-teeth into the mouse with a rush of inborn  savageness that must have surprised even himself.    Another home lesson was on the red-squirrel. One of these noisy, vulgar  creatures, lived close by and used to waste part of each day scolding  the foxes, from some safe perch. The cubs made many vain attempts to  catch him as he ran across their glade from one tree to another, or  spluttered and scolded at them a foot or so out of reach. But old Vixen  was up in natural history--she knew squirrel nature and took the case in  hand when the proper time came. She hid the children and lay down flat  in the middle of the open glade. The saucy low-minded squirrel came and  scolded as usual. But she moved no hair. He came nearer and at last  right overhead to chatter:    \"You brute you, you brute you.\"    But Vix lay as dead. This was very perplexing, so the squirrel came down  the trunk and peeping about made a nervous dash across the grass, to  another tree, again to scold from a safe perch.    \"You brute you, you useless brute, scarrr-scarrrrr.\"    But flat and lifeless on the grass lay Vix. This was most tantalizing to  the squirrel. He was naturally curious and disposed to be venturesome,  so again he came to the ground and skurried across the glade nearer than  before.    Still as death lay Vix, \"surely she was dead.\" And the little foxes  began to wonder if their mother wasn't asleep.    But the squirrel was working himself into a little craze of foolhardy  curiosity. He had dropped a piece of bark on Vix's head; he had used up  his list of bad words, and he had done it all over again, without  getting a sign of life. So after a couple more dashes across the glade  he ventured within a few feet of the really watchful Vix, who sprang to  her feet and pinned him in a twinkling.    \"And the little ones picked the bones e-oh.\" Thus the rudiments of their  education were laid, and afterward, as they grew stronger, they were  taken farther afield to begin the higher branches of trailing and  scenting.    For each kind of prey they were taught a way to hunt, for every animal  has some great strength or it could not live, and some great weakness or  the others could not live. The squirrel's weakness was foolish  curiosity; the fox's that he can't climb a tree. And the training of the  little foxes was all shaped to take advantage of the weakness of the  other creatures and to make up for their own by defter play where they  are strong.    From their parents they learned the chief axioms of the fox world. How,  is not easy to say. But that they learned this in company with their  parents was clear. Here are some that foxes taught me, without saying a  word:--    Never sleep on your straight track.    Your nose is before your eyes, then trust it first.    A fool runs down the wind.    Running rills cure many ills.    Never take the open if you can keep the cover.    Never leave a straight trail if a crooked one will do.    If it's strange, it's hostile.    Dust and water burn the scent.    Never hunt mice in a rabbit-woods, or rabbits in a henyard.    Keep off the grass.    Inklings of the meanings of these were already entering the little ones'  minds--thus, 'Never follow what you can't smell,' was wise, they could  see, because if you can't smell it, then the wind is so that it must  smell you.    One by one they learned the birds and beasts of their home woods, and  then as they were able to go abroad with their parents they learned new  animals. They were beginning to think they knew the scent of everything  that moved. But one night the mother took them to a field where was a  strange black flat thing on the ground. She brought them on purpose to  smell it, but at the first whiff their every hair stood on end, they  trembled, they knew not why-it seemed to tingle through their blood and  fill them with instinctive hate and fear. And when she saw its full  effect she told them--    \"_That is man-scent_.\"    [Illustration]          III      Meanwhile the hens continued to disappear. I had not betrayed the den of  cubs. Indeed, I thought a good deal more of the little rascals than I  did of the hens; but uncle was dreadfully wrought up and made most  disparaging remarks about my woodcraft. To please him I one day took  the hound across to the woods and seating myself on a stump on the open  hillside, I bade the dog go on. Within three minutes he sang out in the  tongue all hunters know so well, \"Fox! fox! fox! straight away down the  valley.\"    After awhile I heard them coming back. There I saw the  fox--Scarface--loping lightly across the river-bottom to the stream. In  he went and trotted along in the shallow water near the margin for two  hundred yards, then came out straight toward me. Though in full view, he  saw me not, but came up the hill watching over his shoulder for the  hound. Within ten feet of me he turned and sat with his back to me while  he craned his neck and showed an eager interest in the doings of the  hound. Ranger came bawling along the trail till he came to the running  water, the killer of scent, and here he was puzzled; but there was only  one thing to do; that was by going up and down both banks find where the  fox had left the river.    The fox before me shifted his position a little to get a better view and  watched with a most human interest all the circling of the hound. He was  so close that I saw the hair of his shoulder bristle a little when the  dog came in sight. I could see the jumping of his heart on his ribs,  and the gleam of his yellow eye. When the dog was wholly baulked by the  water trick it was comical to see:--he could not sit still, but rocked  up and down in glee, and reared on his hind feet to get a better view of  the slow-plodding hound. With mouth opened nearly to his ears, though  not at all winded, he panted noisily for a moment, or rather he laughed  gleefully just as a dog laughs by grinning and panting.    Old Scarface wriggled in huge enjoyment as the hound puzzled over the  trail so long that when he did find it, it was so stale he could barely  follow it, and did not feel justified in tonguing on it at all.    As soon as the hound was working up the hill, the fox quietly went into  the woods. I had been sitting in plain view only ten feet away, but I  had the wind and kept still and the fox never knew that his life had for  twenty minutes been in the power of the foe he most feared. Ranger would  also have passed me as near as the fox, but I spoke to him, and with a  little nervous start he quit the trail and looking sheepish lay down by  my feet.    This little comedy was played with variations for several days, but it  was all in plain view from the house across the river. My uncle,  impatient at the daily loss of hens, went out himself, sat on the open  knoll, and when old Scarface trotted to his lookout to watch the dull  hound on the river flat below, my uncle"]]]
