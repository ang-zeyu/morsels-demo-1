Clarke alludes to the sculptured Apollo Belvedere as giving a still more  elevated idea of the sun-god than the poets themselves,--a figure  expressive of the highest thoughts of the Hellenic mind,--and quotes  Milman in support of his admiration:--         \"All, all divine! no struggling muscle glows,       Through heaving vein no mantling life-blood flows;       But, animate with deity alone,       In deathless glory lives the breathing stone.\"    If a Christian poet can see divinity in the chiselled stone, why should  we wonder at the worship of art by the pagan Greeks? The same could be  said of the statues of Artemis, of Pallas-Athene, of Aphrodite, and  other \"divine\" productions of Grecian artists, since they represented  the highest ideal the world has seen of beauty, grace, loveliness, and  majesty, which the Greeks adored. Hence, though the statues of the gods  are in human shape, it was not men that the Greeks worshipped, but those  qualities of mind and those forms of beauty to which the cultivated  intellect instinctively gave the highest praise. No one can object to  this boundless admiration which the Greeks had for art in its highest  forms, in so far as that admiration became worship. It was the divorce  of art from morals which called out the indignation and censure of the  Christian fathers, and even undermined the religion of philosophers so  far as it had been directed to the worship of the popular deities, which  were simply creations of poets and artists.    It is difficult to conceive how the worship of the gods could have been  kept up for so long a time, had it not been for the festivals. This wise  provision for providing interest and recreation for the people was also  availed of by the Mosaic ritual among the Hebrews, and has been a part  of most well-organized religious systems. The festivals were celebrated  in honor not merely of deities, but of useful inventions, of the seasons  of the year, of great national victories,--all which were religious in  the pagan sense, and constituted the highest pleasures of Grecian life.  They were observed with great pomp and splendor in the open air in front  of temples, in sacred groves, wherever the people could conveniently  assemble to join in jocund dances, in athletic sports, and whatever  could animate the soul with festivity and joy. Hence the religious  worship of the Greeks was cheerful, and adapted itself to the tastes and  pleasures of the people; it was, however, essentially worldly, and  sometimes degrading. It was similar in its effects to the rural sports  of the yeomanry of the Middle Ages, and to the theatrical  representations sometimes held in mediaeval churches,--certainly to the  processions and pomps which the Catholic clergy instituted for the  amusement of the people. Hence the sneering but acute remark of Gibbon,  that all religions were equally true to the people, equally false to  philosophers, and equally useful to rulers. The State encouraged and  paid for sacrifices, rites, processions, and scenic dances on the same  principle that they gave corn to the people to make them contented in  their miseries, and severely punished those who ridiculed the popular  religion when it was performed in temples, even though it winked at the  ridicule of the same performances in the theatres.    Among the Greeks there were no sacred books like the Hindu Vedas or  Hebrew Scriptures, in which the people could learn duties and religious  truths. The priests taught nothing; they merely officiated at rites and  ceremonies. It is difficult to find out what were the means and forms of  religious instruction, so far as pertained to the heart and conscience.  Duties were certainly not learned from the ministers of religion. From  what source did the people learn the necessity of obedience to parents,  of conjugal fidelity, of truthfulness, of chastity, of honesty? It is  difficult to tell. The poets and artists taught ideas of beauty, of  grace, of strength; and Nature in her grandeur and loveliness taught the  same things. Hence a severe taste was cultivated, which excluded  vulgarity and grossness in the intercourse of life. It was the rule to  be courteous, affable, gentlemanly, for all this was in harmony with the  severity of art. The comic poets ridiculed pretension, arrogance,  quackery, and lies. Patriotism, which was learned from the dangers of  the State, amid warlike and unscrupulous neighbors, called out many  manly virtues, like courage, fortitude, heroism, and self-sacrifice. A  hard and rocky soil necessitated industry, thrift, and severe punishment  on those who stole the fruits of labor, even as miners in the Rocky  Mountains sacredly abstain from appropriating the gold of their  fellow-laborers. Self-interest and self-preservation dictated many laws  which secured the welfare of society. The natural sacredness of home  guarded the virtue of wives and children; the natural sense of justice  raised indignation against cheating and tricks in trade. Men and women  cannot live together in peace and safety without observing certain  conditions, which may be ranked with virtues even among savages and  barbarians,--much more so in cultivated and refined communities.    The graces and amenities of life can exist without reference to future  rewards and punishments. The ultimate law of self-preservation will  protect men in ordinary times against murder and violence, and will lead  to public and social enactments which bad men fear to violate. A  traveller ordinarily feels as safe in a highly-civilized pagan community  as in a Christian city. The \"heathen Chinee\" fears the officers of the  law as much as does a citizen of London.    The great difference between a Pagan and a Christian people is in the  power of conscience, in the sense of a moral accountability to a  spiritual Deity, in the hopes or fears of a future state,--motives which  have a powerful influence on the elevation of individual character and  the development of higher types of social organization. But whatever  laws are necessary for the maintenance of order, the repression of  violence, of crimes against person and the State and the general  material welfare of society, are found in Pagan as well as in Christian  States; and the natural affections,--of paternal and filial love,  friendship, patriotism, generosity, etc.,--while strengthened by  Christianity, are also an inalienable part of the God-given heritage of  all mankind. We see many heroic traits, many manly virtues, many  domestic amenities, and many exalted sentiments in pagan Greece, even if  these were not taught by priests or sages. Every man instinctively  clings to life, to property, to home, to parents, to wife and children;  and hence these are guarded in every community, and the violation of  these rights is ever punished with greater or less severity for the sake  of general security and public welfare, even if there be no belief in  God. Religion, loftily considered, has but little to do with the  temporal interests of men. Governments and laws take these under their  protection, and it is men who make governments and laws. They are made  from the instinct of self-preservation, from patriotic aspirations, from  the necessities of civilization. Religion, from the Christian  standpoint, is unworldly, having reference to the life which is to come,  to the enlightenment of the conscience, to restraint from sins not  punishable by the laws, and to the inspiration of virtues which have no  worldly reward.    This kind of religion was not taught by Grecian priests or poets or  artists, and did not exist in Greece, with all its refinements and  glories, until partially communicated by those philosophers who  meditated on the secrets of Nature, the mighty mysteries of life, and  the duties which reason and reflection reveal. And it may be noticed  that the philosophers themselves, who began with speculations on the  origin of the universe, the nature of the gods, the operations of the  mind, and the laws of matter, ended at last with ethical inquiries and  injunctions. We see this illustrated in Socrates and Zeno. They seemed  to despair of finding out God, of explaining the wonders of his  universe, and came down to practical life in its sad realities,--like  Solomon himself when he said, \"Fear God and keep his commandments, for  this is the whole duty of man.\" In ethical teachings and inquiries some  of these philosophers reached a height almost equal to that which  Christian sages aspired to climb; and had the world practised the  virtues which they taught, there would scarcely have been need of a new  revelation, so far as the observance of rules to promote happiness on  earth is concerned. But these Pagan sages did not hold out hopes beyond  the grave. They even doubted whether the soul was mortal or immortal.  They did teach many ennobling and lofty truths for the enlightenment of  thinkers; but they held out no divine help, nor any hope of completing  in a future life the failures of this one; and hence they failed in  saving society from a persistent degradation, and in elevating ordinary  men to those glorious heights reached by the Christian converts.    That was the point to which Augustine directed his vast genius and his  unrivalled logic. He admitted that arts might civilize, and that the  elaborate mythology which he ridiculed was interesting to the people,  and was, as a creation of the poets, ingenious and beautiful; but he  showed that it did not reveal a future state, that it did not promise  eternal happiness, that it did not restrain men from those sins which  human laws could not punish, and that it did not exalt the soul to lofty  communion with the Deity, or kindle a truly spiritual life, and  therefore was worthless as a religion, imbecile to save, and only to be  classed with those myths which delight an ignorant or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10478"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 02: Jewish Heroes and Prophets (#15)"],[1," distinctly and most  emphatically affirms his own divine legation; for is not almost every  chapter prefaced with these remarkable words, \"And the Lord spake unto  Moses\"? Jehovah himself, in some incomprehensible way, amid the  lightnings and the wonders of the sacred Mount, communicated His wisdom.  Now, if we disbelieve this direct and impressive affirmation made by  Moses,--that Jehovah directed him what to say to the people he was  called to govern,--why should we believe his other statements, which  involve supernatural agency or influence pertaining to the early history  of the race? Where, then, is his authority? What is it worth? He has  indeed no authority at all, except so far as his statements harmonize  with our own definite knowledge, and perhaps with scientific  speculations. We then make our own reason and knowledge, not the  declarations of Moses, the ultimate authority. As a divine oracle to us,  his voice is silent; ay, his august voice is drowned by the discordant  and contradictory opinions that are ever blended with the speculations  of the schools. He tells us, in language of the most impressive  simplicity and grandeur, that he _was_ directly instructed and  commissioned by Jehovah to communicate moral truths,--truths, we should  remember, which no one before him is known to have uttered, and truths  so important that the prosperity of nations is identified with them, and  will be so identified as long as men shall speculate and dream. If we  deny this testimony, then his narration of other facts, which we accept,  is not to be fully credited; like other ancient histories, it may be and  it may not be true,--but there is no certainty. However we may interpret  his detailed narration of the genesis of our world and our  race,--whether as chronicle or as symbolic poem,--its central theme and  thought, the direct creative agency of Jehovah, which it was his  privilege to announce, stands forth clear and unmistakable. Yet if we  deny the supernaturalism of the code, we may also deny the  supernaturalism of the creation, in so far as both rest on the  authority of Moses.    And, further, if Moses was not inspired directly from God to write his  code, then it follows that he--a man pre-eminent for wisdom, piety, and  knowledge--was an impostor, or at least, like Mohammed and George Fox, a  self-deceived and visionary man, since he himself affirms his divine  legation, and traces to the direct agency of Jehovah not merely his  code, but even the various deliverances of the Israelites. And not only  was Moses mistaken, but the Jewish nation, and Christ and the apostles,  and the greatest lights of the Church from Augustine to Bossuet.    Hence it follows necessarily that all the miracles by which the divine  legation of Moses is supported and credited, have no firm foundation,  and a belief in them is superstitious,--as indeed it is in all other  miracles recorded in the Scriptures, since they rest on testimony no  more firmly believed than that believed by Christ and the apostles  respecting Moses. Sweep away his authority as an inspiration, and you  undermine the whole authority of the Bible; you bring it down to the  level of all other books; you make it valuable only as a thesaurus of  interesting stories and impressive moral truths, which we accept as we  do all other kinds of knowledge, leaving us free to reject what we  cannot understand or appreciate, or even what we dislike.    Then what follows? Is it not the rejection of many of the most precious  revelations of the Bible, to which we _wish_ to cling, and without a  belief in which there would be the old despair of Paganism, the dreary  unsettlement of all religious opinions, even a disbelief in an  intelligent First Cause of the universe, certainly of a personal  God,--and thus a gradual drifting away to the dismal shores of that  godless Epicureanism which Socrates derided, and Paul and Augustine  combated? Do you ask for a confirmation of the truths thus deduced from  the denial of the supernaturalism of the Mosaic Code? I ask you to look  around. I call no names; I invoke no theological hatreds; I seek to  inflame no prejudices. I appeal to facts as incontrovertible as the  phenomena of the heavens. I stand on the platform of truth itself,  which we all seek to know and are proud to confess. Look to the  developments of modern thought, to some of the speculations of modern  science, to the spirit which animates much of our popular literature,  not in our country but in all countries, even in the schools of the  prophets and among men who are \"more advanced,\" as they think, in  learning, and if you do not see a tendency to the revival of an  attractive but exploded philosophy,--the philosophy of Democritus; the  philosophy of Epicurus,--then I am in an error as to the signs of the  times. But if I am correct in this position,--if scepticism, or  rationalism, or pantheism, or even science, in the audacity of its  denials, or all these combined, are in conflict with the supernaturalism  which shines and glows in every book of the Bible, and are bringing back  for our acceptance what our fathers scorned,--then we must be allowed to  show the practical results, the results on life, which of necessity  followed the triumph of the speculative opinions of the popular idols of  the ancient world in the realm of thought. Oh, what a life was that!  what a poor exchange for the certitudes of faith and the simplicities of  patriarchal times! I do not know whether an Epicurean philosophy grows  out of an Epicurean life, or the life from the philosophy; but both are  indissolubly and logically connected. The triumph of one is the triumph  of the other, and the triumph of both is equally pointed out in the  writings of Paul as a degeneracy, a misfortune,--yea, a sin to be wiped  out only by the destruction of nations, or some terrible and unexpected  catastrophe, and the obscuration of all that is glorious and proud among  the works of men.    I make these, as I conceive, necessary digressions, because a discourse  on Moses would be pointless without them; at best only a survey of that  marvellous and favored legislator from the standpoint of secular  history. I would not pull him down from the lofty pedestal whence he has  given laws to all successive generations; a man, indeed, but shrouded in  those awful mysteries which the great soul of Michael Angelo loved to  ponder, and which gave to his creations the power of supernal majesty.    Thus did Moses, instructed by God,--for this is the great fact revealed  in his testimony,--lead the inconstant Israelites through a forty years'  pilgrimage, securing their veneration to the last. Thus did he keep them  from the idolatries for which they hankered, and preserved among them  allegiance to an invisible King. Thus did he impress his own mind and  character upon them, and shape their institutions with matchless wisdom.  Thus did he give them a system of laws--moral, ceremonial, and  civil--which kept them a powerful and peculiar people for more than a  thousand years, and secured a prosperity which culminated in the  glorious reigns of David and Solomon and a political power unsurpassed  in Western Asia, to see which the Queen of Sheba came from the uttermost  part of the earth,--nay, more, which first formulated for that little  corner of the world principles and precepts concerning the relations of  men to God and to one another which have been an inspiration to all  mankind for thousands of years.    Thus did this good and great man fulfil his task and deliver his  message, with no other drawbacks on his part than occasional bursts of  anger at the unparalleled folly and wickedness of his people. What  disinterestedness marks his whole career, from the time when he flies  from Pharaoh to the appointment of his successor, relinquishing without  regret the virtual government of Egypt, accepting cheerfully the  austerities and privations of the land of Midian, never elevating his  own family to power, never complaining in his herculean tasks! With what  eloquence does he plead for his people when the anger of the Lord is  kindled against them, ever regarding them as mere children who know no  self-control! How patient he is in the performance of his duties,  accepting counsel from Jethro and listening to the voice of Aaron! With  what stern and awful majesty does he lay down the law! What inspiration  gilds his features as he descends the Mount with the Tables in his  hands! How terrible he is amid the thunders and lightnings of Sinai, at  the rock of Horeb, at the dances around the golden calf, at the  rebellion of Korah and Dathan, at the waters of Meribah, at the burning  of Nadab and Abihu! How efficient he is in the administration of  justice, in the assemblies of the people, in the great councils of  rulers and princes, and in all the crises of the State; and yet how  gentle, forgiving, tender, and accessible! How sad he is when the people  weary of manna and seek flesh to eat! How nobly does he plead with the  king of Edom for a passage through his territories! How humbly does he  call on God for help amid perplexing cares! Never was a man armed with  such authority so patient and so self-distrustful. Never was so  experienced and learned a man so little conscious of his greatness.         \"This was the truest warrior          That ever buckled sword;        This the most gifted poet          That ever breathed a word:        And never earth's philosopher          Traced with his golden pen,        On the deathless page, truths half so sage,          As he wrote down for men.\"    At length--at one hundred and twenty years of age, with undimmed eye and  unabated strength, after having done more for his nation and for  posterity than any ruler or king in the world's history, and won a fame  which shall last through all the generations of men, growing brighter  and brighter as his vast"]]]
