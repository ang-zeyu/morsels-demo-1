[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12625"],[0,"Architecture and Democracy (#15)"],[1,"that the  then newly-realized possibilities of steel construction were sending  skyward along lower Broadway, in New York, Mr. Sullivan reads in them  a denial of democracy. To him they signify much more than they seem  to, or mean to; they are more than the betrayal of architectural  ignorance and mendacity, they are symptomatic of forces undermining  American life.        These buildings, as they increase in number, make this city      poorer, morally and spiritually; they drag it down and down      into the mire. This is not American civilization; it is the      rottenness of Gomorrah. This is not Democracy--it is savagery.      It shows the glutton hunt for the Dollar with no thought for      aught else under the sun or over the earth. It is decadence of      the spirit in its most revolting form; it is rottenness of      the heart and corruption of the mind. So truly does this      architecture reflect the causes which have brought it into      being. Such structures are _profoundly anti-social_, and as      such, they must be reckoned with. These buildings are not      architecture, but outlawry, and their authors criminals in the      true sense of the word. And such is the architecture of lower      New York--hopeless, degraded, and putrid in its pessimistic      denial of our art, and of our growing civilization--its      cynical contempt for all those qualities that real humans      value.    We have always been very glib about democracy; we have assumed that  this country was a democracy because we named it so. But now that  we are called upon to die for the idea, we find that we have never  realized it anywhere except perhaps in our secret hearts. In the life  of Abraham Lincoln, in the poetry of Walt Whitman, in the architecture  of Louis Sullivan, the spirit of democracy found utterance, and to  the extent that we ourselves partake of that spirit, it will find  utterance also in us. Mr. Sullivan is a \"prophet of democracy\" not  alone in his buildings but in his writings, and the prophetic note is  sounded even more clearly in his _What is Architecture? A Study in the  American People of Today_, than in _Kindergarten Chats_.    This essay was first printed in _The American Contractor_ of January  6, 1906, and afterwards issued in brochure form. The author starts  by tracing architecture to its root in the human mind: this physical  thing is the manifestation of a psychological state. As a man thinks,  so he is; he acts according to his thought, and if that act takes the  form of a building it is an emanation of his inmost life, and reveals  it.        Everything is there for us to read, to interpret; and this      we may do at our leisure. The building has not means of      locomotion, it cannot hide itself, it cannot get away. There      it is, and there it will stay--telling more truths about him      who made it, than he in his fatuity imagines; revealing his      mind and his heart exactly for what they are worth, not a whit      more, not a whit less; telling plainly the lies he thinks;      telling with almost cruel truthfulness his bad faith, his      feeble, wabbly mind, his impudence, his selfish egoism, his      mental irresponsibility, his apathy, his disdain for real      things--until at last the building says to us: \"I am no more a      real building than the thing that made me is a real man!\"    Language like this stings and burns, but it is just such as is  needful to shame us out of our comfortable apathy, to arouse us to  new responsibilities, new opportunities. Mr. Sullivan, awake among  the sleepers, drenches us with bucketfuls of cold, tonic, energizing  truth. The poppy and mandragora of the past, of Europe, poisons us,  but in this, our hour of battle, we must not be permitted to dream on.  He saw, from far back, that \"we, as a people, not only have betrayed  each other, but have failed in that trust which the world spirit of  democracy placed in our hands, as we, a new people, emerged to fill  a new and spacious land.\" It has taken a world war to make us see the  situation as he saw it, and it is to us, a militant nation, and not  to the slothful civilians a decade ago, that Mr. Sullivan's stirring  message seems to be addressed.    The following quotation is his first crack of the whip at the  architectural schools. The problem of education is to him of all  things the most vital; in this essay he returns to it again and again,  while of _Kindergarten Chats_ it is the very _raison d'etre_.        I trust that a long disquisition is not necessary in order to      show that the attempt at imitation, by us, of this day, of the      by-gone forms of building, is a procedure unworthy of a free      people; and that the dictum of the schools, that Architecture      is finished and done, is a suggestion humiliating to every      active brain, and therefore, in fact, a puerility and a      falsehood when weighed in the scales of truly democratic      thought. Such dictum gives the lie in arrogant fashion, to      healthful human experience. It says, in a word: the American      people are not fit for democracy.    He finds the schools saturated with superstitions which are the  survivals of the scholasticism of past centuries--feudal institutions,  in effect, inimical to his idea of the true spirit of democratic  education. This he conceives of as a searching-out, liberating, and  developing the splendid but obscured powers of the average man, and  particularly those of children. \"It is disquieting to note,\" he says,  \"that the system of education on which we lavish funds with such  generous, even prodigal, hand, falls short of fulfilling its true  democratic function; and that particularly in the so-called higher  branches its tendency appears daily more reactionary, more feudal.  It is not an agreeable reflection that so many of our university  graduates lack the trained ability to see clearly, and to think  clearly, concisely, constructively; that there is perhaps more showing  of cynicism than good faith, seemingly more distrust of men than  confidence in them, and, withal, no consummate ability to interpret  things.\"    In contrast to the schoolman he sketches the psychology of the  active-minded but \"uneducated\" man, with sympathy and understanding,  the man who is courageously seeking a way with little to guide and  help him.        Is it not the part of wisdom to cheer, to encourage such a      mind, rather than dishearten it with ridicule? To say to it:      Learn that the mind works best when allowed to work naturally;      learn to do what your problem suggests when you have reduced      it to its simplest terms; you will thus find that all      problems, however complex, take on a simplicity you had      not dreamed of; accept this simplicity boldly, and with      confidence, do not lose your nerve and run away from it, or      you are lost, for you are here at the point men so heedlessly      call genius--as though it were necessarily rare; for you are      here at the point no living brain can surpass in essence,      the point all truly great minds seek--the point of vital      simplicity--the point of view which so illuminates the mind      that the art of expression becomes spontaneous, powerful, and      unerring, and achievement a certainty. So, if you seek and      express the best that is in yourself, you must search out the      best that is in your people; for they are your problem, and      you are indissolubly a part of them. It is for you to affirm      that which they really wish to affirm, namely, the best that      is in them, and they as truly wish you to express the best      that is in yourself. If the people seem to have but little      faith it is because they have been tricked so long; they are      weary of dishonesty, more weary than they know, much more      weary than you know, and in their hearts they seek honest and      fearless men, men simple and clear in mind, loyal to their own      manhood and to the people. The American people are now in a      stupor; be on hand at the awakening.    Next he pays his respects to current architectural criticism--a  straining at gnats and a swallowing of camels, by minds \"benumbed  by culture,\" and hearts made faint by the tyranny of precedent. He  complains that they make no distinction between _was_ and _is_,  too readily assuming that all that is left us moderns is the humble  privilege to select, copy and adapt.        The current mannerisms of Architectural criticism must often      seem trivial. For of what avail is it to say that this is too      small, that too large, this too thick, and that too thin, or      to quote this, that, or the other precedent, when the real      question may be: Is not the entire design a mean evasion? Why      magnify this, that, or the other little thing, if the entire      scheme of thinking that the building stands for is false, and      puts a mask upon the people, who want true buildings, but do      not know how to get them so long as Architects betray them      with Architectural phrases?    And so he goes on with his Jeremiad: a prophet of despair, do you  say? No, he seeks to destroy only that falsity which would confine  the living spirit. Earlier and more clearly than we, he discerned the  menace to our civilization of the unrestricted play of the masculine  forces--powerful, ruthless, disintegrating--the head dominating the  heart. It has taken the surgery of war to open our eyes, and behold  the spectacle of the entire German nation which by an intellectual  process appears to have killed out compassion, enthroning  _Schrecklichkeit_. In the heart alone dwells hope of salvation. \"For  he who knows even a genuinely little of Mankind knows this truth: the  heart is greater than the head. For in the heart is Desire; and from  it come forth Courage and Magnanimity.\"        You have not thought deeply enough to know that the heart in      you is the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],[0,"Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#15)"],[1," or  coming to an end. The third prefix, _-e-_, is a pronominal element, \"I,\"  which can be used only in \"definite\" tenses. It is highly important to  understand that the use of _-e-_ is conditional on that of _-s-_ or of  certain alternative prefixes and that _te-_ also is in practice linked  with _-s-_. The group _te-s-e-ya_ is a firmly knit grammatical unit. The  suffix _-te_, which indicates the future, is no more necessary to its  formal balance than is the prefixed _re-_ of the Latin word; it is not  an element that is capable of standing alone but its function is  materially delimiting rather than strictly formal.[31]    [Footnote 30: Including such languages as Navaho, Apache, Hupa, Carrier,  Chipewyan, Loucheux.]    [Footnote 31: This may seem surprising to an English reader. We  generally think of time as a function that is appropriately expressed in  a purely formal manner. This notion is due to the bias that Latin  grammar has given us. As a matter of fact the English future (_I shall  go_) is not expressed by affixing at all; moreover, it may be expressed  by the present, as in _to-morrow I leave this place_, where the temporal  function is inherent in the independent adverb. Though in lesser degree,  the Hupa _-te_ is as irrelevant to the vital word as is _to-morrow_ to  the grammatical \"feel\" of _I leave_.]    It is not always, however, that we can clearly set off the suffixes of a  language as a group against its prefixes. In probably the majority of  languages that use both types of affixes each group has both delimiting  and formal or relational functions. The most that we can say is that a  language tends to express similar functions in either the one or the  other manner. If a certain verb expresses a certain tense by suffixing,  the probability is strong that it expresses its other tenses in an  analogous fashion and that, indeed, all verbs have suffixed tense  elements. Similarly, we normally expect to find the pronominal elements,  so far as they are included in the verb at all, either consistently  prefixed or suffixed. But these rules are far from absolute. We have  already seen that Hebrew prefixes its pronominal elements in certain  cases, suffixes them in others. In Chimariko, an Indian language of  California, the position of the pronominal affixes depends on the verb;  they are prefixed for certain verbs, suffixed for others.    It will not be necessary to give many further examples of prefixing and  suffixing. One of each category will suffice to illustrate their  formative possibilities. The idea expressed in English by the sentence  _I came to give it to her_ is rendered in Chinook[32] by  _i-n-i-a-l-u-d-am_. This word--and it is a thoroughly unified word with  a clear-cut accent on the first _a_--consists of a radical element,  _-d-_ \"to give,\" six functionally distinct, if phonetically frail,  prefixed elements, and a suffix. Of the prefixes, _i-_ indicates  recently past time; _n-_, the pronominal subject \"I\"; _-i-_, the  pronominal object \"it\";[33] _-a-_, the second pronominal object \"her\";  _-l-_, a prepositional element indicating that the preceding pronominal  prefix is to be understood as an indirect object (_-her-to-_, i.e., \"to  her\"); and _-u-_, an element that it is not easy to define  satisfactorily but which, on the whole, indicates movement away from the  speaker. The suffixed _-am_ modifies the verbal content in a local  sense; it adds to the notion conveyed by the radical element that of  \"arriving\" or \"going (or coming) for that particular purpose.\" It is  obvious that in Chinook, as in Hupa, the greater part of the grammatical  machinery resides in the prefixes rather than in the suffixes.    [Footnote 32: Wishram dialect.]    [Footnote 33: Really \"him,\" but Chinook, like Latin or French, possesses  grammatical gender. An object may be referred to as \"he,\" \"she,\" or  \"it,\" according to the characteristic form of its noun.]    A reverse case, one in which the grammatically significant elements  cluster, as in Latin, at the end of the word is yielded by Fox, one of  the better known Algonkin languages of the Mississippi Valley. We may  take the form _eh-kiwi-n-a-m-oht-ati-wa-ch(i)_ \"then they together kept  (him) in flight from them.\" The radical element here is _kiwi-_, a verb  stem indicating the general notion of \"indefinite movement round about,  here and there.\" The prefixed element _eh-_ is hardly more than an  adverbial particle indicating temporal subordination; it may be  conveniently rendered as \"then.\" Of the seven suffixes included in this  highly-wrought word, _-n-_ seems to be merely a phonetic element serving  to connect the verb stem with the following _-a-_;[34] _-a-_ is a  \"secondary stem\"[35] denoting the idea of \"flight, to flee\"; _-m-_  denotes causality with reference to an animate object;[36] _-o(ht)-_  indicates activity done for the subject (the so-called \"middle\" or  \"medio-passive\" voice of Greek); _-(a)ti-_ is a reciprocal element, \"one  another\"; _-wa-ch(i)_ is the third person animate plural (_-wa-_,  plural; _-chi_, more properly personal) of so-called \"conjunctive\"  forms. The word may be translated more literally (and yet only  approximately as to grammatical feeling) as \"then they (animate) caused  some animate being to wander about in flight from one another of  themselves.\" Eskimo, Nootka, Yana, and other languages have similarly  complex arrays of suffixed elements, though the functions performed by  them and their principles of combination differ widely.    [Footnote 34: This analysis is doubtful. It is likely that _-n-_  possesses a function that still remains to be ascertained. The Algonkin  languages are unusually complex and present many unsolved problems of  detail.]    [Footnote 35: \"Secondary stems\" are elements which are suffixes from a  formal point of view, never appearing without the support of a true  radical element, but whose function is as concrete, to all intents and  purposes, as that of the radical element itself. Secondary verb stems of  this type are characteristic of the Algonkin languages and of Yana.]    [Footnote 36: In the Algonkin languages all persons and things are  conceived of as either animate or inanimate, just as in Latin or German  they are conceived of as masculine, feminine, or neuter.]    We have reserved the very curious type of affixation known as \"infixing\"  for separate illustration. It is utterly unknown in English, unless we  consider the _-n-_ of _stand_ (contrast _stood_) as an infixed element.  The earlier Indo-European languages, such as Latin, Greek and Sanskrit,  made a fairly considerable use of infixed nasals to differentiate the  present tense of a certain class of verbs from other forms (contrast  Latin _vinc-o_ \"I conquer\" with _vic-i_ \"I conquered\"; Greek _lamb-an-o_  \"I take\" with _e-lab-on_ \"I took\"). There are, however, more striking  examples of the process, examples in which it has assumed a more clearly  defined function than in these Latin and Greek cases. It is particularly  prevalent in many languages of southeastern Asia and of the Malay  archipelago. Good examples from Khmer (Cambodgian) are _tmeu_ \"one who  walks\" and _daneu_ \"walking\" (verbal noun), both derived from _deu_ \"to  walk.\" Further examples may be quoted from Bontoc Igorot, a Filipino  language. Thus, an infixed _-in-_ conveys the idea of the product of an  accomplished action, e.g., _kayu_ \"wood,\" _kinayu_ \"gathered wood.\"  Infixes are also freely used in the Bontoc Igorot verb. Thus, an infixed  _-um-_ is characteristic of many intransitive verbs with personal  pronominal suffixes, e.g., _sad-_ \"to wait,\" _sumid-ak_ \"I wait\";  _kineg_ \"silent,\" _kuminek-ak_ \"I am silent.\" In other verbs it  indicates futurity, e.g., _tengao-_ \"to celebrate a holiday,\"  _tumengao-ak_ \"I shall have a holiday.\" The past tense is frequently  indicated by an infixed _-in-_; if there is already an infixed _-um-_,  the two elements combine to _-in-m-_, e.g., _kinminek-ak_ \"I am silent.\"  Obviously the infixing process has in this (and related) languages the  same vitality that is possessed by the commoner prefixes and suffixes  of other languages. The process is also found in a number of aboriginal  American languages. The Yana plural is sometimes formed by an infixed  element, e.g., _k'uruwi_ \"medicine-men,\" _k'uwi_ \"medicine-man\"; in  Chinook an infixed _-l-_ is used in certain verbs to indicate repeated  activity, e.g., _ksik'ludelk_ \"she keeps looking at him,\" _iksik'lutk_  \"she looked at him\" (radical element _-tk_). A peculiarly interesting  type of infixation is found in the Siouan languages, in which certain  verbs insert the pronominal elements into the very body of the radical  element, e.g., Sioux _cheti_ \"to build a fire,\" _chewati_ \"I build a  fire\"; _shuta_ \"to miss,\" _shuunta-pi_ \"we miss.\"    A subsidiary but by no means unimportant grammatical process is that of  internal vocalic or consonantal change. In some languages, as in English  (_sing_, _sang_, _sung_, _song_; _goose_, _geese_), the former of these  has become one of the major methods of indicating fundamental changes of  grammatical function. At any rate, the process is alive enough to lead  our children into untrodden ways. We all know of the growing youngster  who speaks of having _brung_ something, on the analogy of such forms as  _sung_ and _flung_. In Hebrew, as we have seen, vocalic change is of  even greater significance than in English. What is true of Hebrew is of  course true of all other Semitic languages. A few examples of so-called  \"broken\" plurals from Arabic[37] will supplement the Hebrew verb forms  that I have given in another connection. The noun _balad_ \"place\" has  the plural form _bilad_;[38] _gild_ \"hide\" forms the plural _gulud_;  _ragil_ \"man,\" the plural _rigal_; _shibbak_ \"window,\" the plural  _shababik_. Very similar phenomena are illustrated by the Hamitic  languages of Northern Africa, e.g., Shilh[39] _izbil_ \"h"]]]
