The Major took him by the Hand--    Into the friendly clasp it bled  (A ball through heart and hand he rued):  \"Good-by\" and gazed with humid glance;    Then in a hollow revery said      \"The weakness thing is lustihood;      But Mosby--\" and he checked his mood.    \"Where's the advance?--cut off, by heaven!    Come, Surgeon, how with your wounded there\"  \"The ambulance will carry all\"  \"Well, get them in; we go to camp.    Seven prisoners gone? for the rest have care\"      Then to himself, \"This grief is gall;      That Mosby!--I'll cast a silver ball!\"    \"Ho!\" turning--\"Captain Cloud, you mind    The place where the escort went--so shady?  Go search every closet low and high,  And barn, and bin, and hidden bower--    Every covert--find that lady!      And yet I may misjudge her--ay,      Women (like Mosby) mystify.    \"We'll see. Ay, Captain, go--with speed!    Surround and search; each living thing  Secure; that done, await us where  We last turned off. Stay! fire the cage    If the birds be flown.\" By the cross-road spring      The bands rejoined; no words; the glare      Told all. Had Mosby plotted there?    The weary troop that wended now--    Hardly it seemed the same that pricked  Forth to the forest from the camp:  Foot-sore horses, jaded men;    Every backbone felt as nicked,      Each eye dim as a sick-room lamp,      All faces stamped with Mosby's stamp.    In order due the Major rode--    Chaplain and Surgeon on either hand;  A riderless horse a negro led;  In a wagon the blanketed sleeper went;    Then the ambulance with the bleeding band;      And, an emptied oat-bag on each head,      Went Mosby's men, and marked the dead.    What gloomed them? what so cast them down,    And changed the cheer that late they took,  As double-guarded now they rode  Between the files of moody men?    Some sudden consciousness they brook,      Or dread the sequel. That night's blood      Disturbed even Mosby's brotherhood.    The flagging horses stumbled at roots,    Floundered in mires, or clinked the stones;  No rider spake except aside;  But the wounded cramped in the ambulance,    It was horror to hear their groans--      Jerked along in the woodland ride,      While Mosby's clan their revery hide.    The Hospital Steward--even he--    Who on the sleeper kept his glance,  Was changed; late bright-black beard and eye  Looked now hearse-black; his heavy heart,    Like his fagged mare, no more could dance;      His grape was now a raisin dry:      'Tis Mosby's homily--_Man must die_.    The amber sunset flushed the camp    As on the hill their eyes they fed;  The pickets dumb looks at the wagon dart;  A handkerchief waves from the bannered tent--    As white, alas! the face of the dead:      Who shall the withering news impart?      The bullet of Mosby goes through heart to heart!    They buried him where the lone ones lie    (Lone sentries shot on midnight post)--  A green-wood grave-yard hid from ken,  Where sweet-fern flings an odor nigh--    Yet held in fear for the gleaming ghost!      Though the bride should see threescore and ten,      She will dream of Mosby and his men.    Now halt the verse, and turn aside--    The cypress falls athwart the way;  No joy remains for bard to sing;  And heaviest dole of all is this,    That other hearts shall be as gay      As hers that now no more shall spring:      To Mosby-land the dirges cling.          Lee in the Capitol.        Lee in the Capitol.[24]  (April, 1866.)      Hard pressed by numbers in his strait,    Rebellion's soldier-chief no more contends--  Feels that the hour is come of Fate,    Lays down one sword, and widened warfare ends.  The captain who fierce armies led  Becomes a quiet seminary's head--  Poor as his privates, earns his bread.  In studious cares and aims engrossed,    Strives to forget Stuart and Stonewall dead--  Comrades and cause, station and riches lost,    And all the ills that flock when fortune's fled.  No word he breathes of vain lament,    Mute to reproach, nor hears applause--  His doom accepts, perforce content,    And acquiesces in asserted laws;  Secluded now would pass his life,  And leave to time the sequel of the strife.    But missives from the Senators ran;  Not that they now would gaze upon a swordless foe,  And power made powerless and brought low:    Reasons of state, 'tis claimed, require the man.  Demurring not, promptly he comes  By ways which show the blackened homes,    And--last--the seat no more his own,  But Honor's; patriot grave-yards fill  The forfeit slopes of that patrician hill,    And fling a shroud on Arlington.  The oaks ancestral all are low;  No more from the porch his glance shall go  Ranging the varied landscape o'er,  Far as the looming Dome--no more.  One look he gives, then turns aside,  Solace he summons from his pride:  \"So be it! They await me now  Who wrought this stinging overthrow;  They wait me; not as on the day  Of Pope's impelled retreat in disarray--  By me impelled--when toward yon Dome  The clouds of war came rolling home\"  The burst, the bitterness was spent,  The heart-burst bitterly turbulent,  And on he fared.                     In nearness now    He marks the Capitol--a show  Lifted in amplitude, and set  With standards flushed with a glow of Richmond yet;    Trees and green terraces sleep below.  Through the clear air, in sunny light,  The marble dazes--a temple white.    Intrepid soldier! had his blade been drawn  For yon stirred flag, never as now  Bid to the Senate-house had he gone,  But freely, and in pageant borne,  As when brave numbers without number, massed,  Plumed the broad way, and pouring passed--  Bannered, beflowered--between the shores  Of faces, and the dinn'd huzzas,  And balconies kindling at the sabre-flash,  'Mid roar of drums and guns, and cymbal-crash,  While Grant and Sherman shone in blue--  Close of the war and victory's long review.    Yet pride at hand still aidful swelled,  And up the hard ascent he held.  The meeting follows. In his mien  The victor and the vanquished both are seen--  All that he is, and what he late had been.  Awhile, with curious eyes they scan  The Chief who led invasion's van--  Allied by family to one,  Founder of the Arch the Invader warred upon:  Who looks at Lee must think of Washington;  In pain must think, and hide the thought,  So deep with grievous meaning it is fraught.    Secession in her soldier shows  Silent and patient; and they feel    (Developed even in just success)  Dim inklings of a hazy future steal;    Their thoughts their questions well express:  \"Does the sad South still cherish hate?  Freely will Southen men with Northern mate?  The blacks--should we our arm withdraw,  Would that betray them? some distrust your law.  And how if foreign fleets should come--  Would the South then drive her wedges home\"  And more hereof. The Virginian sees--  Replies to such anxieties.  Discreet his answers run--appear  Briefly straightforward, coldly clear.    \"If now,\" the Senators, closing, say,  \"Aught else remain, speak out, we pray\"  Hereat he paused; his better heart  Strove strongly then; prompted a worthier part  Than coldly to endure his doom.  Speak out? Ay, speak, and for the brave,  Who else no voice or proxy have;  Frankly their spokesman here become,  And the flushed North from her own victory save.  That inspiration overrode--  Hardly it quelled the galling load  Of personal ill. The inner feud  He, self-contained, a while withstood;  They waiting. In his troubled eye  Shadows from clouds unseen they spy;  They could not mark within his breast  The pang which pleading thought oppressed:  He spoke, nor felt the bitterness die.    \"My word is given--it ties my sword;  Even were banners still abroad,  Never could I strive in arms again  While you, as fit, that pledge retain.  Our cause I followed, stood in field and gate--  All's over now, and now I follow Fate.  But this is naught. A People call--  A desolted land, and all  The brood of ills that press so sore,  The natural offspring of this civil war,  Which ending not in fame, such as might rear  Fitly its sculptured trophy here,  Yields harvest large of doubt and dread  To all who have the heart and head  To feel and know. How shall I speak?  Thoughts knot with thoughts, and utterance check.  Before my eyes there swims a haze,  Through mists departed comrades gaze--  First to encourage, last that shall upbraid!  How shall I speak? The South would fain  Feel peace, have quiet law again--  Replant the trees for homestead-shade.    You ask if she recants: she yields.  Nay, and would more; would blend anew,  As the bones of the slain in her forests do,  Bewailed alike by us and you.    A voice comes out from these charnel-fields,  A plaintive yet unheeded one:  _'Died all in vain? both sides undone'_  Push not your triumph; do not urge  Submissiveness beyond the verge.  Intestine rancor would you bide,  Nursing eleven sliding daggers in your side?    \"Far from my thought to school or threat;  I speak the things which hard beset.  Where various hazards meet the eyes,  To elect in magnanimity is wise.  Reap victory's fruit while sound the core;  What sounder fruit than re-established law?  I know your partial thoughts do press  Solely on us for war's unhappy stress;  But weigh--consider--look at all,  And broad anathema you'll recall.  The censor's charge I'll not repeat,  The meddlers kindled the war's white heat--  Vain intermeddlers and malign,  Both of the palm and of the pine;  I waive the thought--which never can be rife--  Common's the crime in every civil strife:  But this I feel, that North and South were driven  By Fate to arms. For our unshriven,  What thousands, truest souls, were tried--    As never may any be again--  All those who stemmed Secession's pride,  But at last were swept by the urgent tide    Into the chasm. I know their pain.  A story here may be applied:  'In Moorish lands there lived a maid    Brought to confess by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],[0,"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#15)"],[1,"a log outside a cabin and leisurely  surveyed the young men. They all looked about the same: strong  without being heavy, light-haired and bronze-faced. In their turn  they carefully judged Joe. A newcomer from the East was always  regarded with some doubt. If they expected to hear Joe talk much  they were mistaken. He appeared good-natured, but not too friendly.    \"Fine weather we're havin',\" said Dick Metzar.    \"Fine,\" agreed Joe, laconically.    \"Like frontier life?\"    \"Sure.\"    A silence ensued after this breaking of the ice. The boys were  awaiting their turn at a little wooden bench upon which stood a  bucket of water and a basin.    \"Hear ye got ketched by some Shawnees?\" remarked another youth, as  he rolled up his shirt-sleeves. They all looked at Joe now. It was  not improbably their estimate of him would be greatly influenced by  the way he answered this question.    \"Yes; was captive for three days.\"    \"Did ye knock any redskins over?\" This question was artfully put to  draw Joe out. Above all things, the bordermen detested boastfulness;  tried on Joe the ruse failed signally.    \"I was scared speechless most of the time,\" answered Joe, with his  pleasant smile.    \"By gosh, I don't blame ye!\" burst out Will Metzar. \"I hed that  experience onct, an' onct's enough.\"    The boys laughed and looked in a more friendly manner at Joe. Though  he said he had been frightened, his cool and careless manner belied  his words. In Joe's low voice and clear, gray eye there was  something potent and magnetic, which subtly influenced those with  whom he came in contact.    While his new friends were at dinner Joe strolled over to where  Colonel Zane sat on the doorstep of his home.    \"How did you get on with the boys?\" inquired the colonel.    \"All right, I hope. Say, Colonel Zane, I'd like to talk to your  Indian guide.\"    Colonel Zane spoke a few words in the Indian language to the guide,  who left his post and came over to them. The colonel then had a  short conversation with him, at the conclusion of which he pointed  toward Joe.    \"How do--shake,\" said Tome, extending his hand.    Joe smiled, and returned the friendly hand-pressure.    \"Shawnee--ketch'um?\" asked the Indian, in his fairly intelligible  English.    Joe nodded his head, while Colonel Zane spoke once more in Shawnee,  explaining the cause of Silvertip's emnity.    \"Shawnee--chief--one--bad--Injun,\" replied Tome, seriously.  \"Silvertip--mad--thunder-mad. Ketch'um paleface--scalp'um sure.\"    After giving this warning the chief returned to his former position  near the corner of the cabin.    \"He can talk in English fairly well, much better than the Shawnee  brave who talked with me the other day,\" observed Joe.    \"Some of the Indians speak the language almost fluently,\" said  Colonel Zane. \"You could hardly have distinguished Logan's speech  from a white man's. Corn-planter uses good English, as also does my  brother's wife, a Wyandot girl.\"    \"Did your brother marry an Indian?\" and Joe plainly showed his  surprise.    \"Indeed he did, and a most beautiful girl she is. I'll tell you  Isaac's story some time. He was a captive among the Wyandots for ten  years. The chief's daughter, Myeerah, loved him, kept him from being  tortured, and finally saved him from the stake.\"    \"Well, that floors me,\" said Joe; \"yet I don't see why it should.  I'm just surprised. Where is your brother now?\"    \"He lives with the tribe. He and Myeerah are working hard for peace.  We are now on more friendly terms with the great Wyandots, or  Hurons, as we call them, than ever before.\"    \"Who is this big man coming from the the fort?\" asked Joe, suddenly  observing a stalwart frontiersman approaching.    \"Major Sam McColloch. You have met him. He's the man who jumped his  horse from yonder bluff.\"    \"Jonathan and he have the same look, the same swing,\" observed Joe,  as he ran his eye over the major. His faded buckskin costume,  beaded, fringed, and laced, was similar to that of the colonel's  brother. Powder-flask and bullet-pouch were made from cow-horns and  slung around his neck on deerhide strings. The hunting coat was  unlaced, exposing, under the long, fringed borders, a tunic of the  same well-tanned, but finer and softer, material. As he walked, the  flaps of his coat fell back, showing a belt containing two knives,  sheathed in heavy buckskin, and a bright tomahawk. He carried a long  rifle in the hollow of his arm.    \"These hunters have the same kind of buckskin suits,\" continued Joe;  \"still, it doesn't seem to me the clothes make the resemblance to  each other. The way these men stand, walk and act is what strikes me  particularly, as in the case of Wetzel.\"    \"I know what you mean. The flashing eye, the erect poise of  expectation, and the springy step--those, my lad, come from a life  spent in the woods. Well, it's a grand way to live.\"    \"Colonel, my horse is laid up,\" said Major McColloch, coming to the  steps. He bowed pleasantly to Joe.    \"So you are going to Short Creek? You can have one of my horses; but  first come inside and we'll talk over you expedition.\"    The afternoon passed uneventfully for Joe. His brother and Mr. Wells  were absorbed in plans for their future work, and Nell and Kate were  resting; therefore he was forced to find such amusement or  occupation as was possible in or near the stockade.        Chapter IX.    Joe went to bed that night with a promise to himself to rise early  next morning, for he had been invited to take part in a \"raising,\"  which term meant that a new cabin was to be erected, and such task  was ever an event in the lives of the settlers.    The following morning Joe rose early, dressing himself in a complete  buckskin suit, for which he had exchanged his good garments of  cloth. Never before had he felt so comfortable. He wanted to hop,  skip and jump. The soft, undressed buckskin was as warm and smooth  as silk-plush; the weight so light, the moccasins so well-fitting  and springy, that he had to put himself under considerable restraint  to keep from capering about like a frolicsome colt.    The possession of this buckskin outfit, and the rifle and  accouterments which went with the bargain, marked the last stage in  Joe's surrender to the border fever. The silent, shaded glens, the  mystery of the woods, the breath of this wild, free life claimed him  from this moment entirely and forever.    He met the others, however, with a serene face, showing no trace of  the emotion which welled up strongly from his heart. Nell glanced  shyly at him; Kate playfully voiced her admiration; Jim met him with  a brotherly ridicule which bespoke his affection as well as his  amusement; but Colonel Zane, having once yielded to the same  burning, riotous craving for freedom which now stirred in the boy's  heart, understood, and felt warmly drawn toward the lad. He said  nothing, though as he watched Joe his eyes were grave and kind. In  his long frontier life, where many a day measured the life and fire  of ordinary years, he had seen lad after lad go down before this  forest fever. It was well, he thought, because the freedom of the  soil depended on these wild, light-footed boys; yet it always made  him sad. How many youths, his brother among them, lay under the  fragrant pine-needle carpet of the forest, in their last earthly  sleep!    The \"raising\" brought out all the settlement--the women to look on  and gossip, while the children played; the men to bend their backs  in the moving of the heavy timbers. They celebrated the erection of  a new cabin as a noteworthy event. As a social function it had a  prominent place in the settlers' short list of pleasures.    Joe watched the proceeding with the same pleasure and surprise he  had felt in everything pertaining to border life.    To him this log-raising appeared the hardest kind of labor. Yet it  was plain these hardy men, these low-voiced women, and merry  children regarded the work as something far more significant than  the mere building of a cabin. After a while he understood the  meaning of the scene. A kindred spirit, the spirit of the pioneer,  drew them all into one large family. This was another cabin; another  home; another advance toward the conquering of the wilderness, for  which these brave men and women were giving their lives. In the  bright-eyed children's glee, when they clapped their little hands at  the mounting logs, Joe saw the progress, the march of civilization.    \"Well, I'm sorry you're to leave us to-night,\" remarked Colonel Zane  to Joe, as the young man came over to where he, his wife, and sister  watched the work. \"Jonathan said all was ready for your departure at  sundown.\"    \"Do we travel by night?\"    \"Indeed, yes, my lad. There are Indians everywhere on the river. I  think, however, with Jack and Lew handling the paddles, you will  slip by safely. The plan is to keep along the south shore all night;  then cross over at a place called Girty's Point, where you are to  remain in hiding during daylight. From there you paddle up Yellow  Creek; then portage across country to the head of the Tuscarwawas.  Another night's journey will then bring you to the Village of  Peace.\"    Jim and Mr. Wells, with his nieces, joined the party now, and all  stood watching as the last logs were put in place.    \"Colonel Zane, my first log-raising is an education to me,\" said the  young minister, in his earnest manner. \"This scene is so full of  life. I never saw such goodwill among laboring men. Look at that  brawny-armed giant standing on the topmost log. How he whistles as  he swings his ax! Mr. Wells, does it not impress you?\"    \"The pioneers must be brothers because of their isolation and peril;  to be brothers means to love one another; to love one another is to  love God. What you see in this fraternity is God. And I want to see  this same beautiful feeling among the Indians.\"    \"I have seen it,\" said Colonel Zane, to the old"]]]
