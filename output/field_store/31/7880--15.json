Then Sigurd looketh on Regin, and he deemeth it overlong    That he dighteth the dear-bought morsel, and the might for the Master of         wrong,    So he reacheth his hand to the roast to see if the cooking be o'er;    But the blood and the fat seethed from it and scalded his finger sore,    And he set his hand to his mouth to quench the fleshly smart,    And he tasted the flesh of the Serpent and the blood of Fafnir's Heart:    Then there came a change upon him, for the speech of fowl he knew,    And wise in the ways of the beast-kind as the Dwarfs of old he grew;    And he knitted his brows and hearkened, and wrath in his heart arose    For he felt beset of evil in a world of many foes.    But the hilts of the Wrath he handled, and Regin's heart he saw,    And how that the Foe of the Gods the net of death would draw;    And his bright eyes flashed and sparkled, and his mouth grew set and stern    As he hearkened the voice of the eagles, and their song began to learn.    And six of the eagles cried to Sigurd not to tarry before the feast, and  they urged him to kill Regin, who had planned Fafnir's death that he  alone might live and fashion the world after his evil will.      And the seventh: \"Arise, O Sigurd, lest the hour be overlate!    For the sun in the mid-noon shineth, and swift is the hand of Fate:    Arise! lest the world run backward and the blind heart have its will,    And once again be tangled the sundered good and ill;    Lest love and hatred perish, lest the world forget its tale,    And the Gods sit deedless, dreaming, in the high-walled heavenly vale.\"      Then swift ariseth Sigurd, and the Wrath in his hand is bare,    And he looketh, and Regin sleepeth, and his eyes wide-open glare;    But his lips smile false in his dreaming, and his hand is on the sword;    For he dreams himself the Master and the new world's fashioning-lord,    And his dream hath forgotten Sigurd, and the King's life lies in the pit;    He is nought; Death gnaweth upon him, while the Dwarfs in mastery sit.      But lo, how the eyes of Sigurd the heart of the guileful behold,    And great is Allfather Odin, and upriseth the Curse of the Gold,    And the Branstock bloometh to heaven from the ancient wondrous root;    The summer hath shone on its blossoms, and Sigurd's Wrath is the fruit.           *       *       *       *       *      Then his second stroke struck Sigurd, for the Wrath flashed thin and white,    And 'twixt head and trunk of Regin fierce ran the fateful light;    And there lay brother by brother a faded thing and wan.    But Sigurd cried in the desert: \"So far have I wended on!    Dead are the foes of God-home that would blend the good and the ill;    And the World shall yet be famous, and the Gods shall have their will.    Nor shall I be dead and forgotten, while the earth grows worse and worse,    With the blind heart king o'er the people, and binding curse with curse.\"      _How Sigurd took to him the Treasure of the Elf Andvari._    So Sigurd ate of the heart of Fafnir, and as he ate the longing to be  gone to mighty deeds grew great, and he leapt on Greyfell and sought the  home of the Dweller amid the Gold on the edge of the heath. He strode  through the doorway, and before him lay golden armour, golden coins,  and golden sands from rivers that none but the Dwarfs could mine. But  more wonderful than all other treasures were the Helm of Aweing, and the  Hauberk all of gold, while on top of the midmost heap, gleaming like  the brightest star in the sky, lay the ring of Andvari.    Sigurd put on the helm and the hauberk, and dragged out gold wherewith he  loaded Greyfell till the cloud-grey horse shone, while the eagles ever  bade him bring forth the treasure, and let the gold shine in the open.  And as the stars paled and the dawn grew clearer, Sigurd and Greyfell  passed swiftly and lightly towards the west.      _How Sigurd awoke Brynhild upon Hindfell._      By long roads rideth Sigurd amidst that world of stone,    And somewhat south he turneth; for he would not be alone,    But longs for the dwellings of man-folk, and the kingly people's speech,    And the days of the glee and the joyance, where men laugh each to each.    But still the desert endureth, and afar must Greyfell fare    From the wrack of the Glittering Heath, and Fafnir's golden lair.    Long Sigurd rideth the waste, when, lo, on a morning of day    From out of the tangled crag-walls, amidst the cloud-land grey    Comes up a mighty mountain, and it is as though there burns    A torch amidst of its cloud-wreath; so thither Sigurd turns,    For he deems indeed from its topmost to look on the best of the earth;    And Greyfell neigheth beneath him, and his heart is full of mirth.           *       *       *       *       *      Night falls, but yet rides Sigurd, and hath no thought of rest,    For he longs to climb that rock-world and behold the earth at its best;    But now mid the maze of the foot-hills he seeth the light no more,    And the stars are lovely and gleaming on the lightless heavenly floor.    So up and up he wendeth till the night is wearing thin;    And he rideth a rift of the mountain, and all is dark therein,    Till the stars are dimmed by dawning and the wakening world is cold;    Then afar in the upper rock-wall a breach doth he behold,    And a flood of light poured inward the doubtful dawning blinds:    So swift he rideth thither and the mouth of the breach he finds,    And sitteth awhile on Greyfell on the marvellous thing to gaze:    For lo, the side of Hindfell enwrapped by the fervent blaze,    And nought 'twixt earth and heaven save a world of flickering flame,    And a hurrying shifting tangle, where the dark rents went and came.      Great groweth the heart of Sigurd with uttermost desire,    And he crieth kind to Greyfell, and they hasten up, and nigher,    Till he draweth rein in the dawning on the face of Hindfell's steep:    But who shall heed the dawning where the tongues of that wildfire leap?    For they weave a wavering wall, that driveth over the heaven    The wind that is born within it; nor ever aside is it driven    By the mightiest wind of the waste, and the rain-flood amidst it is nought;    And no wayfarer's door and no window the hand of its builder hath wrought.    But thereon is the Volsung smiling as its breath uplifteth his hair,    And his eyes shine bright with its image, and his mail gleams white and         fair,    And his war-helm pictures the heavens and the waning stars behind:    But his neck is Greyfell stretching to snuff at the flame-wall blind,    And his cloudy flank upheaveth, and tinkleth the knitted mail,    And the gold of the uttermost waters is waxen wan and pale.      Now Sigurd turns in his saddle, and the hilt of the Wrath he shifts,    And draws a girth the tighter; then the gathered reins he lifts,    And crieth aloud to Greyfell, and rides at the wildfire's heart;    But the white wall wavers before him and the flame-flood rusheth apart,    And high o'er his head it riseth, and wide and wild is its roar    As it beareth the mighty tidings to the very heavenly floor:    But he rideth through its roaring as the warrior rides the rye,    When it bows with the wind of the summer and the hid spears draw anigh.    The white flame licks his raiment and sweeps through Greyfell's mane,    And bathes both hands of Sigurd and the hilts of Fafnir's bane,    And winds about his war-helm and mingles with his hair,    But nought his raiment dusketh or dims his glittering gear;    Then it fails and fades and darkens till all seems left behind,    And dawn and the blaze is swallowed in mid-mirk stark and blind.      But forth a little further and a little further on    And all is calm about him, and he sees the scorched earth wan    Beneath a glimmering twilight, and he turns his conquering eyes,    And a ring of pale slaked ashes on the side of Hindfell lies;    And the world of the waste is beyond it; and all is hushed and grey,    And the new-risen moon is a-paleing, and the stars grow faint with day.      Then Sigurd looked before him and a Shield-burg there he saw,    A wall of the tiles of Odin wrought clear without a flaw,    The gold by the silver gleaming, and the ruddy by the white;    And the blazonings of their glory were done upon them bright.    As of dear things wrought for the war-lords new come to Odin's hall.    Piled high aloft to the heavens uprose that battle-wall,    And far o'er the topmost shield-rim for a banner of fame there hung    A glorious golden buckler; and against the staff it rung    As the earliest wind of dawning uprose on Hindfell's face    And the light from the yellow east beamed soft on the shielded place.      But the Wrath cried out in answer as Sigurd leapt adown    To the wasted soil of the desert by that rampart of renown;    He looked but little beneath it, and the dwelling of God it seemed,    As against its gleaming silence the eager Sigurd gleamed:    He draweth not sword from scabbard, as the wall he wendeth around,    And it is but the wind and Sigurd that wakeneth any sound:    But, lo, to the gate he cometh, and the doors are open wide,    And no warder the way withstandeth, and no earls by the threshold abide.    So he stands awhile and marvels; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13493"],[0,"The American Frugal Housewife (#15)"],[1," strike through it, for fifteen or twenty minutes. Unless very bad,  this will restore the sweetness.      CARAWAY CAKES.    Take one pound of flour, three quarters of a pound of sugar, half a  pound of butter, a glass of rose-water, four eggs, and half a tea-cup  of caraway seed,--the materials well rubbed together and beat up. Drop  them from a spoon on tin sheets, and bake them brown in rather a slow  oven. Twenty minutes, or half an hour, is enough to bake them.      DOUGH-NUTS.    For dough-nuts, take one pint of flour, half a pint of sugar, three  eggs, a piece of butter as big as an egg, and a tea-spoonful of  dissolved pearlash. When you have no eggs, a gill of lively emptings  will do; but in that case, they must be made over night. Cinnamon,  rose-water, or lemon-brandy, if you have it. If you use part lard  instead of butter, add a little salt. Not put in till the fat is very  hot. The more fat they are fried in, the less they will soak fat.      PANCAKES.    Pancakes should be made of half a pint of milk, three great spoonfuls  of sugar, one or two eggs, a tea-spoonful of dissolved pearlash,  spiced with cinnamon, or cloves, a little salt, rose-water, or  lemon-brandy, just as you happen to have it. Flour should be stirred  in till the spoon moves round with difficulty. If they are thin, they  are apt to soak fat. Have the fat in your skillet boiling hot, and  drop them in with a spoon. Let them cook till thoroughly brown. The  fat which is left is good to shorten other cakes. The more fat they  are cooked in, the less they soak.    If you have no eggs, or wish to save them, use the above ingredients,  and supply the place of eggs by two or three spoonfuls of lively  emptings; but in this case they must be made five or six hours  before they are cooked,--and in winter they should stand all night.  A spoonful or more of N.E. rum makes pancakes light. Flip makes very  nice pancakes. In this case, nothing is done but to sweeten your mug  of beer with molasses; put in one glass of N.E. rum; heat it till it  foams, by putting in a hot poker; and stir it up with flour as thick  as other pancakes.      FRITTERS.    Flat-jacks, or fritters, do not differ from pancakes, only in  being mixed softer. The same ingredients are used in about the same  quantities; only most people prefer to have no sweetening put in them,  because they generally have butter, sugar, and nutmeg, put on them,  after they are done. Excepting for company, the nutmeg can be well  dispensed with. They are not to be boiled in fat, like pancakes; the  spider or griddle should be well greased, and the cakes poured on as  large as you want them, when it is quite hot; when it gets brown on  one side, to be turned over upon the other. Fritters are better to be  baked quite thin. Either flour, Indian, or rye, is good.    Sour beer, with a spoonful of pearlash, is good both for pancakes and  fritters.    If you have any cold rice left, it is nice to break it up fine in warm  milk; put in a little salt; after you have put milk enough for the  cakes you wish to make, (a half pint, Or more,) stir in flour till  it is thick enough to pour for fritters. It does very well without an  egg; but better with one. To be fried like other flat-jacks. Sugar and  nutmeg are to be put on when they are buttered, if you like.      SHORT CAKE.    If you have sour milk, or butter-milk, it is well to make it into  short cakes for tea. Rub in a very small bit of shortening, or three  table-spoonfuls of cream, with the flour; put in a tea-spoonful of  strong dissolved pearlash, into your sour milk, and mix your cake  pretty stiff, to bake in the spider, on a few embers.    When people have to buy butter and lard, short cakes are not  economical food. A half pint of flour will make a cake large enough to  cover a common plate. Rub in thoroughly a bit of shortening as big as  a hen's egg; put in a tea-spoonful of dissolved pearlash; wet it with  cold water; knead it stiff enough to roll well, to bake on a plate,  or in a spider. It should bake as quick as it can, and not burn. The  first side should stand longer to the fire than the last.      INDIAN CAKE.    Indian cake, or bannock, is sweet and cheap food. One quart of sifted  meal, two great spoonfuls of molasses, two tea-spoonfuls of salt, a  bit of shortening half as big as a hen's egg, stirred together; make  it pretty moist with scalding water, put it into a well greased pan,  smooth over the surface with a spoon, and bake it brown on both sides,  before a quick fire. A little stewed pumpkin, scalded with the meal,  improves the cake. Bannock split and dipped in butter makes very nice  toast. A richer Indian cake may be made by stirring one egg to a half  pint of milk, sweetened with two great spoonfuls of molasses; a little  ginger, or cinnamon; Indian stirred in till it is just about thick  enough to pour. Spider or bake-kettle well greased; cake poured in,  covered up, baked half an hour, or three quarters, according to  the thickness of the cake. If you have sour milk, or butter-milk,  it is very nice for this kind of cake; the acidity corrected by a  tea-spoonful of dissolved pearlash. It is a rule never to use pearlash  for Indian, unless to correct the sourness of milk; it injures the  flavor of the meal.    Nice suet improves all kinds of Indian cakes very much.           *       *       *       *       *    Two cups of Indian meal, one table-spoonful molasses, two cups milk,  a little salt, a handful flour, a little saleratus, mixed up thin,  and poured into a buttered bake-kettle, hung over the fire uncovered,  until you can bear your finger upon it, and then set down before the  fire. Bake half an hour.           *       *       *       *       *          BREAD, YEAST, &C.      It is more difficult to give rules for making bread than for anything  else; it depends so much on judgment and experience. In summer, bread  should be mixed with cold water; during a chilly, damp spell, the  water should be slightly warm; in severe cold weather, it should be  mixed quite warm, and set in a warm place during the night. If your  yeast is new and lively, a small quantity will make the bread rise;  if it be old and heavy, it will take more. In these things I believe  wisdom must be gained by a few mistakes.    Six quarts of meal will make two good sized loaves of _Brown Bread_.  Some like to have it half Indian meal and half rye meal; others prefer  it one third Indian, and two thirds rye. Many mix their brown bread  over night; but there is no need of it; and it is more likely to sour,  particularly in summer. If you do mix it the night before you bake it,  you must not put in more than half the yeast I am about to mention,  unless the weather is intensely cold. The meal should be sifted  separately. Put the Indian in your bread-pan, sprinkle a little salt  among it, and wet it thoroughly with scalding water. Stir it up while  you are scalding it. Be sure and have hot water enough; for Indian  absorbs a great deal of water. When it is cool, pour in your rye; add  two gills of lively yeast, and mix it with water as stiff as you can  knead it. Let it stand an hour and a half, in a cool place in summer,  on the hearth in winter. It should be put into a very hot oven, and  baked three or four hours. It is all the better for remaining in the  oven over night.    _Flour Bread_ should have a sponge set the night before. The sponge  should be soft enough to pour; mixed with water, warm or cold,  according to the temperature of the weather. One gill of lively yeast  is enough to put into sponge for two loaves. I should judge about  three pints of sponge would be right for two loaves. The warmth of the  place in which the sponge is set, should be determined by the coldness  of the weather. If your sponge looks frothy in the morning, it is a  sign your bread will be good; if it does not rise, stir in a little  more emptings; if it rises too much, taste of it, to see if it has any  acid taste; if so, put in a tea-spoonful of pearlash when you mould in  your flour; be sure the pearlash is well dissolved in water; if there  are little lumps, your bread will be full of bitter spots. About an  hour before your oven is ready, stir in flour into your sponge till it  is stiff enough to lay on a well floured board or table. Knead it up  pretty stiff, and put it into well greased pans, and let it stand in  a cool or warm place, according to the weather. If the oven is ready,  put them in fifteen or twenty minutes after the dough begins to rise  up and crack; if the oven is not ready, move the pans to a cooler  spot, to prevent the dough from becoming sour by too much rising.  Common sized loaves will bake in three quarters of an hour. If they  slip easily in the pans, it is a sign they are done. Some people do  not set a soft sponge for flour bread; they knead it up all ready to  put in the pans the night before, and leave it to rise. White bread  and pies should not be set in the oven until the brown bread and beans  have been in half an hour. If the oven be too hot, it will bind the  crust so suddenly that the bread cannot rise; if it be too cold, the  bread will fall. Flour bread should not be too stiff.    Some people like one third Indian in their flour. Others like one  third rye; and some think the nicest of all bread is one third Indian,  one third rye, and one third flour, made according to the directions  for flour bread. When Indian is used, it should be salted, and  scalded, before the other meal is put in. A mixture of other grains is  economical when flour is high.    _Dyspepsia Bread_.--The American Farmer publishes the following  receipt for making bread, which has proved highly salutary to persons  afflicted with that complaint, viz:--Three quarts unbolted wheat meal;  one quart soft water, warm, but not hot; one gill of fresh yeast; one  gill of molasses, or not, as may suit the taste; one tea-spoonful of"]]]
