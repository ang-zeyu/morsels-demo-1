So admirable was the machinery contrived by the  American despots for maintaining tranquillity throughout their  dominions!  It may remind us of the similar institutions of  ancient Rome, when, under the Caesars, she was mistress of half  the world.    A principal design of the great roads was to serve the purposes  of military communication.  It formed an important item of their  military policy, which is quite as well worth studying as their  municipal.    Notwithstanding the pacific professions of the Incas, and the  pacific tendency, indeed, of their domestic institutions, they  were constantly at war. It was by war that their paltry territory  had been gradually enlarged to a powerful empire.  When this was  achieved, the capital, safe in its central position, was no  longer shaken by these military movements, and the country  enjoyed, in a great degree, the blessings of tranquillity and  order. But, however tranquil at heart, there is not a reign upon  record in which the nation was not engaged in war against the  barbarous nations on the frontier. Religion furnished a plausible  pretext for incessant aggression, and disguised the lust of  conquest in the Incas, probably, from their own eyes, as well as  from those of their subjects.  Like the followers of Mahomet,  bearing the sword in one hand and the Koran in the other, the  Incas of Peru offered no alternative but the worship of the Sun  or war.    It is true, their fanaticism - or their policy - showed itself in  a milder form than was found in the descendants of the Prophet.  Like the great luminary which they adored, they operated by  gentleness more potent than violence. *52 They sought to soften  the hearts of the rude tribes around them, and melt them by acts  of condescension and kindness.  Far from provoking hostilities,  they allowed time for the salutary example of their own  institutions to work its effect, trusting that their less  civilized neighbours would submit to their sceptre, from a  conviction of the blessings it would secure to them.  When this  course failed, they employed other measures, but still of a  pacific character; and endeavoured by negotiation, by  conciliatory treatment, and by presents to the leading men, to  win them over to their dominion.  In short, they practised all  the arts familiar to the most subtle politician of a civilized  land to secure the acquisition of empire.  When all these  expedients failed, they prepared for war.    [Footnote 52: \"Mas se hicieron Senores al za.\" Ondegardo, Rel.  Prim., principio por mana, que por fuer- Ms.]    Their levies were drawn from all the different provinces; though  from some, where the character of the people was particularly  hardy, more than from others. *53 It seems probable that every  Peruvian, who had reached a certain age, might be called to bear  arms.  But the rotation of military service, and the regular  drills, which took place twice or thrice in a month, of the  inhabitants of every village, raised the soldiers generally above  the rank of a raw militia.  The Peruvian army, at first  inconsiderable, came, with the increase of population, in the  latter days of the empire, to be very large, so that their  monarchs could bring into the field, as contemporaries assure us,  a force amounting to two hundred thousand men.  They showed the  same skill and respect for order in their military organization,  as in other things.  The troops were divided into bodies  corresponding with out battalions and companies, led by officers,  that rose, in regular gradation, from the lowest subaltern to the  Inca noble, who was intrusted with the general command. *54    [Footnote 53: Idem, Rel. Prim., Ms. - Dec. de la Aud. Real., Ms.]    [Footnote 54: Gomara, Cronica, cap. 195 - Conq. i Pob. del Piru,  Ms.]    Their arms consisted of the usual weapons employed by nations,  whether civilized or uncivilized, before the invention of powder,  - bows and arrows, lances, darts, a short kind of sword, a  battle-axe or partisan, and slings, with which they were very  expert.  Their spears and arrows were tipped with copper, or,  more commonly, with bone, and the weapons of the Inca lords were  frequently mounted with gold or silver.  Their heads were  protected by casques made either of wood or of the skins of wild  animals, and sometimes richly decorated with metal and with  precious stones, surmounted by the brilliant plumage of the  tropical birds.  These, of course, were the ornaments only of the  higher orders.  The great mass of the soldiery were dressed in  the peculiar costume of their provinces, and their heads were  wreathed with a sort of turban or roll of different-colored  cloths, that produced a gay and animating effect.  Their  defensive armor consisted of a shield or buckler, and a close  tunic of quilted cotton, in the same manner as with the Mexicans.  Each company had its particular banner, and the imperial  standard, high above all, displayed the glittering device of the  rainbow, - the armorial ensign of the Incas, intimating their  claims as children of the skies. *55    [Footnote 55: Gomara, Cronica, ubi supra. - Sarmiento, Relacion,  Ms., cap. 20. - Velasco, Hist. de Quito, tom. I. pp. 176-179.    This last writer gives a minute catalogue of the ancient Peruvian  arms, comprehending nearly every thing familiar to the European  soldier, except fire-arms.  - It was judicious in him to omit  these.]    By means of the thorough system of communication established in  the country, a short time sufficed to draw the levies together  from the most distant quarters.  The army was put under the  direction of some experienced chief, of the blood royal, or, more  frequently, headed by the Inca in person. The march was rapidly  performed, and with little fatigue to the soldier; for, all along  the great routes, quarters were provided for him, at regular  distances, where he could find ample accommodations.  The country  is still covered with the remains of military works, constructed  of porphyry or granite, which tradition assures us were designed  to lodge the Inca and his army. *56    [Footnote 56: Zarate, Conq. del Peru, lib. 1, cap. 11. -  Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 60.    Condamine speaks of the great number of these fortified places,  scattered over the country between Quito and Lima, which he saw  in his visit to South America in 1737; some of which he has  described with great minuteness. Memoire sur Quelques Anciens  Monumens du Perou, du Tems des Incas, ap. Histoire de l'Academie  Royale des Sciences et de Belles Lettres, (Berlin, 1748,) tom.  II. p. 438.]    At regular intervals, also, magazines were established, filled  with grain, weapons, and the different munitions of war, with  which the army was supplied on its march.  It was the especial  care of the government to see that these magazines, which were  furnished from the stores of the Incas, were always well filled.  When the Spaniards invaded the country, they supported their own  armies for a long time on the provisions found in them. *57 The  Peruvian soldier was forbidden to commit any trespass on the  property of the inhabitants whose territory lay in the line of  march.  Any violation of this order was punished with death. *58  The soldier was clothed and fed by the industry of the people,  and the Incas rightly resolved that he should not repay this by  violence.  Far from being a tax on the labors of the husbandman,  or even a burden on his hospitality, the imperial armies  traversed the country, from one extremity to the other, with as  little inconvenience to the inhabitants, as would be created by a  procession of peaceful burghers, or a muster of holiday soldiers  for a review.    [Footnote 57: \"E ansi cuando,\" says Ondegardo, speaking from his  own personal knowledge, \"el Senor Presidente Gasca passo con la  gente de castigo de Gonzalo Pizarro por el valle de Jauja, estuvo  alli siete semanas a lo que me acuerdo, se hallaron en deposito  maiz de cuatro y de tres y de dos anos mas de 15 hanegas junto al  camino, e alli comio la gente, y se entendio que si fuera  menester muchas mas no faltaran en el valle en aquellos  depositos, conforme a la orden antigua, porque a mi cargo estubo  el repartirlas y hacer la cuenta para pagarlas.\" Rel. Seg., Ms.]    [Footnote 58: Pedro Pizarro, Descub.  y Conq., Ms. - Cieza de  Leon, Cronica, cap. 44. - Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 14.]    From the moment war was proclaimed, the Peruvian monarch used all  possible expedition in assembling his forces, that he might  anticipate the movements of his enemies, and prevent a  combination with their allies.  It was, however, from the neglect  of such a principle of combination, that the several nations of  the country, who might have prevailed by confederated strength,  fell one after another under the imperial yoke.  Yet, once in the  field, the Inca did not usually show any disposition to push his  advantages to the utmost, and urge his foe to extremity.  In  every stage of the war, he was open to propositions for peace;  and although he sought to reduce his enemies by carrying off  their harvests and distressing them by famine, he allowed his  troops to commit no unnecessary outrage on person or property.  \"We must spare our enemies,\" one of the Peruvian princes is  quoted as saying, \"or it will be our loss, since they and all  that belongs to them must soon be ours.\" *59 It was a wise maxim,  and, like most other wise maxims, founded equally on benevolence  and prudence.  The Incas adopted the policy claimed for the  Romans by their countryman, who tells us that they gained more by  clemency to the vanquished than by their victories. *60    [Footnote 59: \"Mandabase que en los mantenimientos y casas de los  enemigos se hiciese poco dano, diciendoles el Senor, presto seran  estos"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13240"],[0,"A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature (#15)"],[1,"of Modern Divinity_, which he  defended against the attacks of the \"Moderate\" party in the Church. B.,  if unduly introspective, was a man of singular piety and amiability. His  autobiography is an interesting record of Scottish life, full of  sincerity and tenderness, and not devoid of humorous touches, intentional  and otherwise.      BOSWELL, SIR ALEXANDER (1775-1822).--Antiquary and song writer, _s._ of  James B., of Auchinleck, Johnson's biographer, was interested in old  Scottish authors, some of whose works he reprinted at his private press.  He wrote some popular Scotch songs, of which _Jenny's Bawbee_ and _Jenny  dang the Weaver_ are the best known. B. _d._ in a duel with Mr. Stuart of  Dunearn.      BOSWELL, JAMES (1740-1795).--Biographer, _s._ of Alexander B. of  Auchinleck, Ayrshire, one of the judges of the Supreme Courts of  Scotland, was _ed._ at the High School and Univ. of Edin., and practised  as an advocate. He travelled much on the Continent and visited Corsica,  where he became acquainted with the patriot General Paoli. Fortunately  for posterity he was in 1763 introduced to Dr. Johnson, and formed an  acquaintance with him which soon ripened into friendship, and had as its  ultimate fruit the immortal _Life_. He was also the author of several  works of more or less interest, including an _Account of Corsica_ (1768),  and _Journal of Tour to the Hebrides_ (in the company of Johnson) (1786).  Vain and foolish in an exceptional degree, and by no means free from more  serious faults, B. has yet produced the greatest biography in the  language. _The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D._ appeared in 1791, and at  once commanded an admiration which has suffered no diminution since. But  by this time a cloud had fallen upon the author. He had lost his  excellent wife, his health had given way, the intemperance to which he  had always been subject had mastered him, and he _d._ four years after  the appearance of his great work. B. was called to the English as well as  to the Scottish Bar, but his various foibles prevented his reaching any  great success, and he had also vainly endeavoured to enter on a political  career. The question has often been raised how a man with the  characteristics of B. could have produced so unique a work, and has been  discussed at length by Macaulay and by Carlyle, the former paradoxically  arguing that his supreme folly and meanness themselves formed his  greatest qualifications; the latter, with far deeper insight, that  beneath these there lay the possession of an eye to discern excellence  and a heart to appreciate it, intense powers of accurate observation and  a considerable dramatic faculty. His letters to William Temple were  discovered at Boulogne, and _pub._ 1857.      BOUCICAULT, DION (1820-90).--Actor and dramatist, _b._ in Dublin and  _ed._ in London, joined Macready while still young, and made his first  appearance upon the stage with Benj. Webster at Bristol. Soon afterwards  he began to write plays, occasionally in conjunction, of which the first,  _London Assurance_ (1841) had an immediate success. He was an excellent  actor, especially in pathetic parts. His plays are for the most part  adaptations, but are often very ingenious in construction, and have had  great popularity. Among the best known are _The Colleen Bawn_,  _Arrah-na-Pogue_, _Faust and Marguerite_, and _The Shaughraun_. B. _d._  in America.      BOWDLER, THOMAS (1754-1825).--Editor of _The Family Shakespeare_, _b._  near Bath, _s._ of a gentleman of independent fortune, studied medicine  at St. Andrews and at Edin., where he took his degree in 1776, but did  not practise, devoting himself instead to the cause of prison reform. In  1818 he _pub._ his _Family Shakespeare_ in 10 vols., \"in which nothing is  added to the original text, but those words and expressions are omitted  which cannot with propriety be read aloud in a family.\" The work had  considerable success, 4 editions having been _pub._ before 1824, and  others in 1831, 1853, and 1861. It was, however, subjected to some  criticism and ridicule, and gave rise to the expression \"bowdlerise,\"  always used in an opprobrious sense. On the other hand, Mr. Swinburne has  said, \"More nauseous and foolish cant was never chattered than that which  would deride the memory or depreciate the merits of B. No man ever did  better service to Shakespeare than the man who made it possible to put  him into the hands of intelligent and imaginative children.\" B.  subsequently essayed a similar enterprise in regard to Gibbon, which,  however, was not so successful.      BOWER, ARCHIBALD (1686-1766).--Historian, _b._ at Dundee, and _ed._ at  the Scots Coll., Douay, became a Jesuit, but afterwards joined the Church  of England, and again became a Jesuit. He wrote a _History of Rome_  (1735-44), a _History of the Popes_ (1748-66). These works are  ill-proportioned and inaccurate. His whole life appears to have been a  very discreditable one.      BOWER, or BOWMAKER, WALTER (_d._ 1449).--Was Abbot of Inchcolm, and  continued and enlarged Fordun's _Scotichronicon_.      BOWLES, WILLIAM LISLE (1762-1850).--Poet and antiquary, _b._ at King's  Sutton, Northamptonshire, of which his _f._ was vicar, and _ed._ at  Winchester and Oxf., was for the most of his life Vicar of Bremhill,  Wilts, and became Prebendary and Canon Residentiary of Salisbury. His  first work, _pub._ in 1789, was a little vol. containing 14 sonnets,  which was received with extraordinary favour, not only by the general  public, but by such men as Coleridge and Wordsworth. It may be regarded  as the harbinger of the reaction against the school of Pope, in which  these poets were soon to bear so great a part. B. _pub._ several other  poems of much greater length, of which the best are _The Spirit of  Discovery_ (1805), and _The Missionary of the Andes_ (1815), and he also  enjoyed considerable reputation as an antiquary, his principal work in  that department being _Hermes Britannicus_ (1828). In 1807 he _pub._ a  _Life of Pope_, in the preface to which he expressed some views on poetry  which resulted in a rather fierce controversy with Byron, Campbell, and  others. He also wrote a _Life of Bishop Ken_. B. was an amiable,  absent-minded, and rather eccentric man. His poems are characterised by  refinement of feeling, tenderness, and pensive thought, but are deficient  in power and passion.    Other works are _Coombe Ellen and St. Michael's Mount_ (1798), _The  Battle of the Nile_ (1799), _The Sorrows of Switzerland_ (1801), _St.  John in Patmos_ (1833), etc.      BOWRING, SIR JOHN (1792-1872).--Linguist, writer, and traveller, was _b._  at Exeter. His talent for acquiring languages enabled him at last to say  that he knew 200, and could speak 100. He was appointed editor of the  _Westminster Review_ in 1824; travelled in various countries with the  view of reporting on their commercial position; was an M.P. 1835-37 and  1841-49, and held various appointments in China. His chief literary work  was the translation of the folk-songs of most European nations, and he  also wrote original poems and hymns, and works on political and economic  subjects. B. was knighted in 1854. He was the literary executor of Jeremy  Bentham (_q.v._).      BOYD, ANDREW KENNEDY HUTCHISON (1825-1899).--Miscellaneous writer, _s._  of Rev. Dr. B. of Glasgow, was originally intended for the English Bar,  but entered the Church of Scotland, and was minister latterly at St.  Andrews, wrote in _Fraser's Magazine_ a series of light, chirping  articles subsequently collected as the _Recreations of a Country Parson_,  also several books of reminiscences, etc., written in a pleasant chatty  style, and some sermons. He was D.D. and LL.D.      BOYD, ZACHARY (1585-1653).--Divine, belonged to the family of B. of  Pinkhill, Ayrshire, was _ed._ at Glasgow and at Saumur. He translated  many parts of Scripture into uncouth verse. Among his works are _The  Garden of Zion_ and _Zion's Flowers_.      BOYLE, THE HON. ROBERT (1627-1691).--Natural Philosopher and chemist, 7th  _s._ of the 1st Earl of Cork, was _b._ at Lismore, Co. Waterford, and  _ed._ at Eton and by private tutors, after which he pursued his studies  on the Continent. On his return to England he devoted himself to the  study of science, especially natural philosophy and chemistry. He was one  of the founders of the Royal Society, and, by his experiments and  observations added to existing knowledge, especially in regard to  pneumatics. He at the same time devoted much study to theology; so much  indeed that he was strongly urged by Lord Clarendon to enter the Church.  Thinking, however, that he could serve the cause of religion better as a  layman, he declined this advice. As a director of the East India Co. he  did much for the propagation of Christianity in the East, and for the  dissemination of the Bible. He also founded the \"Boyle Lectures\" in  defence of Christianity. He declined the offer of a peerage. B. was a man  of great intellectual acuteness, and remarkable for his conversational  powers. Among his writings are _Origin of Forms and Qualities_,  _Experiments touching Colour_, _Hydrostatical Paradoxes_, and  _Observations on Cold_; in theology, _Seraphic Love_. His complete works  were _pub._ in 5 vols. in 1744.      BRADLEY, EDWARD (1827-1889).--Novelist, was a clergyman. He wrote under  the name of \"Cuthbert Bede\" a few novels and tales, _Fairy Fables_  (1858), _Glencraggan_ (1861), _Fotheringhay_ (1885), etc.; but his most  popular book was _Verdant Green, an Oxford Freshman_, which had great  vogue.      BRADWARDINE, THOMAS (1290?-1349).--Theologian, was at Oxf., where he  became Prof. of Divinity and Chancellor, and afterwards Chaplain to  Edward III., whom he attended in his French wars. He was twice elected  Archbishop of Canterbury by the monks, and on the second occasion  accepted, but _d._ of the plague within 40 days. He wrote on geometry,  but his"]]]
