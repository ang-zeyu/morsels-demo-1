THE Columbia, or Oregon, for the distance of thirty or forty miles  from its entrance into the sea, is, properly speaking, a mere estuary,  indented by deep bays so as to vary from three to seven miles in width;  and is rendered extremely intricate and dangerous by shoals reaching  nearly from shore to shore, on which, at times, the winds and currents  produce foaming and tumultuous breakers. The mouth of the river proper  is but about half a mile wide, formed by the contracting shores of the  estuary. The entrance from the sea, as we have already observed, is  bounded on the south side by a flat sandy spit of land, stretching in  to the ocean. This is commonly called Point Adams. The opposite, or  northern side, is Cape Disappointment; a kind of peninsula, terminating  in a steep knoll or promontory crowned with a forest of pine-trees, and  connected with the mainland by a low and narrow neck. Immediately within  this cape is a wide, open bay, terminating at Chinook Point, so called  from a neighboring tribe of Indians. This was called Baker's Bay, and  here the Tonquin was anchored.    The natives inhabiting the lower part of the river, and with whom the  company was likely to have the most frequent intercourse, were divided  at this time into four tribes, the Chinooks, Clatsops, Wahkiacums, and  Cathlamahs. They resembled each other in person, dress, language, and  manner; and were probably from the same stock, but broken into tribes,  or rather hordes, by those feuds and schisms frequent among Indians.    These people generally live by fishing. It is true they occasionally  hunt the elk and deer, and ensnare the water-fowl of their ponds and  rivers, but these are casual luxuries. Their chief subsistence is  derived from the salmon and other fish which abound in the Columbia  and its tributary streams, aided by roots and herbs, especially the  wappatoo, which is found on the islands of the river.    As the Indians of the plains who depend upon the chase are bold  and expert riders, and pride themselves upon their horses, so these  piscatory tribes of the coast excel in the management of canoes, and are  never more at home than when riding upon the waves. Their canoes vary in  form and size. Some are upwards of fifty feet long, cut out of a single  tree, either fir or white cedar, and capable of carrying thirty persons.  They have thwart pieces from side to side about three inches thick,  and their gunwales flare outwards, so as to cast off the surges of the  waves. The bow and stern are decorated with grotesque figures of men and  animals, sometimes five feet in height.    In managing their canoes they kneel two and two along the bottom,  sitting on their heels, and wielding paddles from four to five feet  long, while one sits on the stern and steers with a paddle of the same  kind. The women are equally expert with the men in managing the canoe,  and generally take the helm.    It is surprising to see with what fearless unconcern these savages  venture in their light barks upon the roughest and most tempestuous  seas. They seem to ride upon the waves like sea-fowl. Should a surge  throw the canoe upon its side and endanger its overturn, those to  windward lean over the upper gunwale, thrust their paddles deep into the  wave, apparently catch the water and force it under the canoe, and by  this action not merely regain III an equilibrium, but give their bark a  vigorous impulse forward.    The effect of different modes of life upon the human frame and human  character is strikingly instanced in the contrast between the hunting  Indians of the prairies, and the piscatory Indians of the sea-coast. The  former, continually on horseback scouring the plains, gaining their food  by hardy exercise, and subsisting chiefly on flesh, are generally tall,  sinewy, meagre, but well formed, and of bold and fierce deportment: the  latter, lounging about the river banks, or squatting and curved up in  their canoes, are generally low in stature, ill-shaped, with crooked  legs, thick ankles, and broad flat feet. They are inferior also in  muscular power and activity, and in game qualities and appearance, to  their hard-riding brethren of the prairies.    Having premised these few particulars concerning the neighboring  Indians, we will return to the immediate concerns of the Tonquin and her  crew.    Further search was made for Mr. Fox and his party, but with no better  success, and they were at length given up as lost. In the meantime, the  captain and some of the partners explored the river for some distance in  a large boat, to select a suitable place for the trading post. Their old  jealousies and differences continued; they never could coincide in their  choice, and the captain objected altogether to any site so high up the  river. They all returned, therefore, to Baker's Bay in no very good  humor. The partners proposed to examine the opposite shore, but the  captain was impatient of any further delay. His eagerness to \"get on\"  had increased upon him. He thought all these excursions a sheer loss  of time, and was resolved to land at once, build a shelter for the  reception of that part of his cargo destined for the use of the  settlement, and, having cleared his ship of it and of his irksome  shipmates, to depart upon the prosecution of his coasting voyage,  according to orders.    On the following day, therefore, without troubling himself to consult  the partners, he landed in Baker's Bay, and proceeded to erect a shed  for the reception of the rigging, equipments, and stores of the schooner  that was to be built for the use of the settlement.    This dogged determination on the part of the sturdy captain gave high  offense to Mr. M'Dougal, who now considered himself at the head of the  concern, as Mr. Astor's representative and proxy. He set off the same  day, (April 5th) accompanied by David Stuart, for the southern shore,  intending to be back by the seventh. Not having the captain to contend  with, they soon pitched upon a spot which appeared to them favorable  for the intended establishment. It was on a point of land called Point  George, having a very good harbor, where vessels, not exceeding two  hundred tons burden, might anchor within fifty yards of the shore.    After a day thus profitably spent, they recrossed the river, but landed  on the northern shore several miles above the anchoring ground of the  Tonquin, in the neighborhood of Chinooks, and visited the village of  that tribe. Here they were received with great hospitality by the chief,  who was named Comcomly, a shrewd old savage, with but one eye, who  will occasionally figure in this narrative. Each village forms a petty  sovereignty, governed by its own chief, who, however, possesses but  little authority, unless he be a man of wealth and substance; that is  to say, possessed of canoe, slaves, and wives. The greater the number of  these, the greater is the chief. How many wives this one-eyed potentate  maintained we are not told, but he certainly possessed great sway, not  merely over his own tribe, but over the neighborhood.    Having mentioned slaves, we would observe that slavery exists among  several of the tribes beyond the Rocky Mountains. The slaves are well  treated while in good health, but occupied in all kinds of drudgery.  Should they become useless, however, by sickness or old age, they are  totally neglected, and left to perish; nor is any respect paid to their  bodies after death.    A singular custom prevails, not merely among the Chinooks, but among  most of the tribes about this part of the coast, which is the flattening  of the forehead. The process by which this deformity is effected  commences immediately after birth. The infant is laid in a wooden  trough, by way of cradle. The end on which the head reposes is higher  than the rest. A padding is placed on the forehead of the infant, with a  piece of bark above it, and is pressed down by cords, which pass through  holes on each side of the trough. As the tightening of the padding and  the pressing of the head to the board is gradual, the process is  said not to be attended with much pain. The appearance of the infant,  however, while in this state of compression, is whimsically hideous, and  \"its little black eyes,\" we are told, \"being forced out by the tightness  of the bandages, resemble those of a mouse choked in a trap.\"    About a year's pressure is sufficient to produce the desired effect,  at the end of which time the child emerges from its bandages a complete  flathead, and continues so through life. It must be noted that  this flattening of the head has something in it of aristocratical  significancy, like the crippling of the feet among the Chinese ladies of  quality. At any rate, it is a sign of freedom. No slave is permitted  to bestow this enviable deformity upon his child; all the slaves,  therefore, are roundheads.    With this worthy tribe of Chinooks the two partners passed a part of  the day very agreeably. M'Dougal, who was somewhat vain of his official  rank, had given it to be understood that they were two chiefs of a great  trading company, about to be established here, and the quick-sighted,  though one-eyed chief, who was somewhat practiced in traffic with white  men, immediately perceived the policy of cultivating the friendship of  two such important visitors. He regaled them, therefore, to the best of  his ability, with abundance of salmon and wappatoo. The next morning,  April 7th, they prepared to return to the vessel, according to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13711"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#15)"],[1,"geologist.  The remains of this gigantic quadruped are found all over the northern  hemisphere, from the 40th to the 75th degree of latitude: but most  abundantly in the region which lies between the mountains of Central  Asia and the shores and islands of the Frozen Sea. So profusely do  they exist in this region, that the tusks have for more than a century  constituted an important article of traffic--furnishing a large  proportion of the ivory required by the carver and turner. The remains  lie imbedded in the upper tertiary clays and gravels; and these, by  exposure to the river-currents, to the waves of the sea, and other  erosive agencies, are frequently swept away during the thaws of  summer, leaving tusks and bones in masses, and occasionally even  entire skeletons, in a wonderful state of preservation. The most  perfect specimen yet obtained, and from the study of which the  zoologist has been enabled to arrive at an accurate knowledge of the  structure and habits of the mammoth, is that discovered by a Tungusian  fisherman, near the mouth of the river Lena, in the summer of 1799.    Being in the habit of collecting tusks among the debris of the  gravel-cliffs, (for it is generally at a considerable elevation in the  cliffs and river banks that the remains occur,) he observed a strange  shapeless mass projecting from an ice-bank some fifty or sixty feet  above the river; during next summer's thaw he saw the same object,  rather more disengaged from amongst the ice; in 1801 he could  distinctly perceive the tusk and flank of an immense animal; and in  1803, in consequence of an earlier and more powerful thaw, the huge  carcase became entirely disengaged, and fell on the sandbank beneath.  In the spring of the following year the fisherman cut off the tusks,  which he sold for fifty rubles (L7, 10s.;) and two years afterward,  our countryman, Mr. Adams, visited the spot, and gives the following  account of the extraordinary phenomenon:    \"At this time I found the mammoth still in the same place, but  altogether mutilated. The discoverer was contented with his profit  for the tusks, and the Yakoutski of the neighborhood had cut off  the flesh, with which they fed their dogs. During the scarcity, wild  beasts, such as white bears, wolves, wolverines, and foxes, also  fed upon it, and the traces of their footsteps were seen around. The  skeleton, almost entirely cleared of its flesh, remained whole, with  the exception of a foreleg. The head was covered with a dry skin;  one of the ears, well preserved, was furnished with a tuft of hair.  All these parts have necessarily been injured in transporting them a  distance of 7,330 miles, (to the Imperial museum of St. Petersburgh,)  but the eyes have been preserved, and the pupil of one can still be  distinguished. The mammoth was a male, with a long mane on the neck.  The tail and proboscis were not preserved. The skin, of which I  possess three-fourths, is of a dark-gray color, covered with a reddish  wool and black hairs: but the dampness of the spot where it had lain  so long had in some degree destroyed the hair. The entire carcase,  of which I collected the bones on the spot, was nine feet four inches  high, and sixteen feet four inches long, without including the tusks,  which measured nine feet six inches along the curve. The distance from  the base or root of the tusk to the point is three feet seven inches.  The two tusks together weighed three hundred and sixty pounds, English  weight, and the head alone four hundred and fourteen pounds. The skin  was of such weight that it required ten persons to transport it to  the shore; and after having cleared the ground, upward of thirty-six  pounds of hair were collected, which the white bears had trodden while  devouring the flesh.\"    Since then, other carcases of elephants have been discovered, in  a greater or less degree of preservation; as also the remains of  rhinoceroses, mastodons, and allied pachyderms--the mammoth more  abundantly in the old world, the mastodon in the new. In every case  these animals differ from existing species: are of more gigantic  dimensions; and, judging from their natural coverings of thick-set  curly-crisped wool and strong hair, upward of a foot in length, were  fitted to live, if not in a boreal, at least in a coldly-temperate  region. Indeed, there is proof positive of the then more milder  climate of these regions in the discovery of pine and birch-trunks  where no vegetation now flourishes; and further, in the fact that  fragments of pine-leaves, birch-twigs, and other northern plants, have  been detected between the grinders and within the stomachs of these  animals. We have thus evidence, that at the close of the tertiary,  and shortly after the commencement of the current epoch, the northern  hemisphere enjoyed a much milder climate; that it was the abode of  huge pachyderms now extinct; that a different distribution of sea  and land prevailed; and that on a new distribution or sea and land,  accompanied also by a different relative level, these animals died  away, leaving their remains imbedded in the clays, gravels, and other  alluvial deposits, where, under the antiseptic influence of an almost  eternal frost, many of them have been preserved as entire as at the  fatal moment they sank under the rigors of external conditions no  longer fitted for their existence. It has been attempted by some to  prove the adaptability of these animals to the present conditions  of the northern hemisphere; but so untenable in every phase is this  opinion, that it would be sheer waste of time and space to attempt its  refutation. That they may have migrated northward and southward with  the seasons is more than probable, though it has been stated that the  remains diminish in size the farther north they are found; but that  numerous herds of such huge animals should have existed in these  regions at all, and that for thousands of years, presupposes an  exuberant arboreal vegetation, and the necessary degree of climate for  its growth and development. It has been mentioned that the mastodon  and mammoth seem to have attained their meridian toward the close of  the tertiary epoch, and that a few may have lived even in the current  era; but it is more probable that the commencement of existing  conditions was the proximate cause of their extinction, and that not  a solitary specimen ever lived to be the contemporary of man.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM FRASER'S MAGAZINE.]    ENGLISH HEXAMETERS.    BY WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.      Askest thou if in my youth I have mounted, as others have mounted,    Galloping Hexameter, Pentameter cantering after,    English by dam and by sire; bit, bridle, and saddlery, English;    English the girths and the shoes; all English from snaffle to crupper;    Everything English around, excepting the tune of the jockey?    Latin and Greek, it is true, I have often attach'd to my phaeton    Early in life, and sometimes have I ordered them out in its evening,    Dusting the linings, and pleas'd to have found them unworn and untarnisht.    Idle! but Idleness looks never better than close upon sunset.    Seldom my goosequill, of goose from Germany, fatted in England,    (Frolicksome though I have been) have I tried on Hexameter, knowing    Latin and Greek are alone its languages. We have a measure    Fashion'd by Milton's own hand, a fuller, a deeper, a louder.    Germans may flounder at will over consonant, vowel, and liquid,    Liquid and vowel but one to a dozen of consonants, ending    Each with a verb at the tail, tail heavy as African ram's tail,    Spenser and Shakspeare had each his own harmony; each an enchanter    Wanting no aid from without. _Chevy Chase_ had delighted their fathers,    Though of a different strain from the song on the _Wrath of Achilles_.    Southey was fain to pour forth his exuberant stream over regions    Near and remote: his command was absolute; every subject,    Little or great, he controll'd; in language, variety, fancy,    Richer than all his compeers and wanton but once in dominion;    'Twas when he left the full well that for ages had run by his homestead,    Pushing the brambles aside which encumber'd another up higher,    Letting his bucket go down, and hearing it bump in descending,    Grating against the loose stones 'til it came but half-full from the bottom.    Others abstain'd from the task. Scott wander'd at large over Scotland;    Reckless of Roman and Greek, he chanted the _Lay of the Minstrel_    Better than ever before any minstrel in chamber had chanted.    Never on mountain or wild hath echo so cheerfully sounded,    Never did monarch bestow such glorious meeds upon knighthood,    Never had monarch the power, liberality, justice, discretion.    Byron liked new-papered rooms, and pull'd down old wainscot of cedar;    Bright-color'd prints he preferr'd to the graver cartoons of a Raphael,    Sailor and Turk (with a sack,) to Eginate and Parthenon marbles,    Splendid the palace he rais'd--the gin-palace in Poesy's purlieus;    Soft the divan on the sides, with spittoons for the qualmish and queesy.    Wordsworth, well pleas'd with himself, cared little for modern or ancient.    His was the moor and the tarn, the recess in the mountain, the woodland    Scatter'd with trees far and wide, trees never too solemn or lofty,    Never entangled with plants overrunning the villager's foot-path.    Equable was he and plain, but wandering a little in wisdom,    Sometimes flying from blood and sometimes pouring it freely.    Yet he was English at heart. If his words were too many; if Fancy's    Furniture lookt rather scant in a whitewasht homely apartment;    If in his rural designs there is sameness and tameness; if often    Feebleness is there for breadth; if his pencil wants rounding and pointing;    Few of this age or the last stand out on the like elevation.
