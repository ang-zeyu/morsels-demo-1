He argued with himself that they could not drag them all that way on  the sand, that the Desperate Lark was not worth it, that they had  given it up. Yet he knew in his heart that that was what they would  do. He knew there were fortified towns in Africa, and as for its being  worth it, he knew that there was no pleasant thing left now to those  defeated men except revenge, and if the Desperate Lark had come over  the sand why not guns? He knew that the ship could never hold out  against guns and cavalry, a week perhaps, two weeks, even three: what  difference did it make how long it was, and the men sang:        Away we go, Oho, Oho, Oho,      A drop of rum for you and me      And the world's as round as the letter O      And round it runs the sea.    A melancholy settled down on Shard.    About sunset Lieutenant Smerdrak came up for orders. Shard ordered a  trench to be dug along the port side of the ship. The men wanted to  sing and grumbled at having to dig, especially as Shard never  mentioned his fear of guns, but he fingered his pistols and in the end  Shard had his way. No one on board could shoot like Captain Shard.  That is often the way with captains of pirate ships, it is a difficult  position to hold. Discipline is essential to those that have the right  to fly the skull-and-cross-bones, and Shard was the man to enforce it.  It was starlight by the time the trench was dug to the captain's  satisfaction and the men that it was to protect when the worst came to  the worst swore all the time as they dug. And when it was finished  they clamoured to make a feast on some of the killed oxen, and this  Shard let them do. And they lit a huge fire for the first time,  burning abundant scrub, they thinking that Arabs daren't return, Shard  knowing that concealment was now useless. All that night they feasted  and sang, and Shard sat up in his chart-room making his plans.    When morning came they rigged up the cutter as they called the  captured horse and told off her crew. As there were only two men that  could ride at all these became the crew of the cutter. Spanish Dick  and Bill the Boatswain were the two.    Shard's orders were that turn and turn about they should take command  of the cutter and cruise about five miles off to the North East all  the day but at night they were to come in. And they fitted the horse  up with a flagstaff in front of the saddle so that they could signal  from her, and carried an anchor behind for fear she should run away.    And as soon as Spanish Dick had ridden off Shard sent some men to roll  all the barrels back from the depot where they were buried in the  sand, with orders to watch the cutter all the time and, if she  signalled, to return as fast as they could.    They buried the Arabs that day, removing their water-bottles and any  provisions they had, and that night they got all the water-barrels in,  and for days nothing happened. One event of extraordinary importance  did indeed occur, the wind got up one day, but it was due South, and  as the oasis lay to the North of them and beyond that they might pick  up the camel track Shard decided to stay where he was. If it had  looked to him like lasting Shard might have hoisted sail but it it  dropped at evening as he knew it would, and in any case it was not the  wind he wanted. And more days went by, two weeks without a breeze. The  dead oxen would not keep and they had had to kill three more, there  were only seven left now.    Never before had the men been so long without rum. And Captain Shard  had doubled the watch besides making two more men sleep at the guns.  They had tired of their simple games, and most of their songs, and  their tales that were never true were no longer new. And then one day  the monotony of the desert came down upon them.    There is a fascination in the Sahara, a day there is delightful, a  week is pleasant, a fortnight is a matter of opinion, but it was  running into months. The men were perfectly polite but the boatswain  wanted to know when Shard thought of moving on. It was an unreasonable  question to ask of the captain of any ship in a dead calm in a desert,  but Shard said he would set a course and let him know in a day or two.  And a day or two went by over the monotony of the Sahara, who for  monotony is unequalled by all the parts of the earth. Great marshes  cannot equal it, nor plains of grass nor the sea, the Sahara alone  lies unaltered by the seasons, she has no altering surface, no flowers  to fade or grow, year in year out she is changeless for hundreds and  hundreds of miles. And the boatswain came again and took off his cap  and asked Captain Shard to be so kind as to tell them about his new  course. Shard said he meant to stay until they had eaten three more of  the oxen as they could only take three of them in the hold, there were  only six left now. But what if there was no wind, the boatswain said.  And at that moment the faintest breeze from the North ruffled the  boatswain's forelock as he stood with his cap in his hand.    \"Don't talk about the wind to _me_,\" said Captain Shard: and Bill was  a little frightened for Shard's mother had been a gipsy.    But it was only a breeze astray, a trick of the Sahara. And another  week went by and they ate two more oxen.    They obeyed Captain Shard ostentatiously now but they wore ominous  looks. Bill came again and Shard answered him in Romany.    Things were like this one hot Sahara morning when the cutter  signalled. The lookout man told Shard and Shard read the message,  \"Cavalry astern\" it read, and then a little later she signalled, \"With  guns.\"    \"Ah,\" said Captain Shard.    One ray of hope Shard had; the flags on the cutter fluttered. For the  first time for five weeks a light breeze blew from the North, very  light, you hardly felt it. Spanish Dick rode in and anchored his horse  to starboard and the cavalry came on slowly from the port.    Not till the afternoon did they come in sight, and all the while that  little breeze was blowing.    \"One knot,\" said Shard at noon. \"Two knots,\" he said at six bells and  still it grew and the Arabs trotted nearer. By five o'clock the merry  men of the bad ship Desperate Lark could make out twelve long  old-fashioned guns on low wheeled carts dragged by horses and what  looked like lighter guns carried on camels. The wind was blowing a  little stronger now. \"Shall we hoist sail, sir?\" said Bill.    \"Not yet,\" said Shard.    By six o'clock the Arabs were just outside the range of cannon and  there they halted. Then followed an anxious hour or so, but the Arabs  came no nearer. They evidently meant to wait till dark to bring their  guns up. Probably they intended to dig a gun epaulment from which they  could safely pound away at the ship.    \"We could do three knots,\" said Shard half to himself as he was  walking up and down his quarter-deck with very fast short paces. And  then the sun set and they heard the Arabs praying and Shard's merry  men cursed at the top of their voices to show that they were as good  men as they.    The Arabs had come no nearer, waiting for night. They did not know how  Shard was longing for it too, he was gritting his teeth and sighing  for it, he even would have prayed, but that he feared that it might  remind Heaven of him and his merry men.    Night came and the stars. \"Hoist sail,\" said Shard. The men sprang to  their places, they had had enough of that silent lonely spot. They  took the oxen on board and let the great sails down, and like a lover  coming from over sea, long dreamed of, long expected, like a lost  friend seen again after many years, the North wind came into the  pirates' sails. And before Shard could stop it a ringing English cheer  went away to the wondering Arabs.    They started off at three knots and soon they might have done four but  Shard would not risk it at night. All night the wind held good, and  doing three knots from ten to four they were far out of sight of the  Arabs when daylight came. And then Shard hoisted more sail and they  did four knots and by eight bells they were doing four and a half. The  spirits of those volatile men rose high, and discipline became  perfect. So long as there was wind in the sails and water in the tanks  Captain Shard felt safe at least from mutiny. Great men can only be  overthrown while their fortunes are at their lowest. Having failed to  depose Shard when his plans were open to criticism and he himself  scarce knew what to do next it was hardly likely they could do it now;  and whatever we think of his past and his way of living we cannot deny  that Shard was among the great men of the world.    Of defeat by the Arabs he did not feel so sure. It was useless to try  to cover his tracks even if he had had time, the Arab cavalry could  have picked them up anywhere. And he was afraid of their camels with  those light guns on board, he had heard they could do seven knots and  keep it up most of the day and if as much as one shot struck the  mainmast... and Shard taking his mind off useless fears worked out on  his chart when the Arabs were likely to overtake them. He told his men  that the wind would hold good for a week, and, gipsy or no, he  certainly knew as much about the wind as is good for a sailor to know.    Alone in his chart-room he worked it out like this, mark two hours to  the good for surprise and finding the tracks and delay in starting,  say three hours if the guns were mounted in their epaulments, then the  Arabs should start at seven. Supposing the camels go twelve hours a  day at seven knots they would do eighty-four knots a day, while Shard  doing three knots from ten to four, and four knots the rest of the  time, was doing ninety and actually gaining. But when it came to it he  wouldn't risk more than two knots at night while the enemy were out of  sight, for he rightly regarded anything more than that as dangerous  when sailing on land"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13831"],[0,"Evolution Of The Japanese, Social And Psychic (#15)"],[1,"the adoption of Western methods of  government might be made without disturbing the old religious ideas  and without removing the edicts against Christianity. But experience  soon showed that the old civilization was a unit. No part could be  vitally modified without affecting the whole structure. Having knocked  over one block in the long row that made up their feudal social order,  it was found that each successive block was touched and fell, until  nothing was left standing as before. It was found also that the old  ideas of education, of travel, of jurisprudence, of torture and  punishment, of social ranks, of the relation of the individual to the  state, of the state to the family, and of religion to the family, were  more or less defective and unsuited to the new civilization. Before  this new movement all obstructive ideas, however, sanctioned by  antiquity, have had to give way. The Japanese of to-day look, as it  were, upon a new earth and a new heaven. Those of forty years ago  would be amazed, not only at the enormous changes in the externals,  life and government, but also at the transformation which has  overtaken every element of the older civilization. Putting it rather  strongly, it is now not the son who obeys the father, but the father  the son. The rulers no longer command the people, but the people  command the rulers. The people do not now toil to support the state;  but the state toils to protect the people.    Whether the incoming of these new ideas and practices be thought to  constitute progress or not will depend on one's view of the aim of  life. If this be as maintained in the previous chapter, then surely  the transformation of Japan must be counted progress. That, however,  to which I call attention is the fact that the essential requisite of  progress is the attainment of new ideas, whatever be their source.  Japan has not only taken up a great host of these, but in doing so she  has adopted a social structure to stimulate the continuous production  of new ideas, through the development of individuality. She is thus in  the true line of continuously progressive evolution. Imitating the  stronger nations, she has introduced into her system the life-giving  blood of free discussion, popular education, and universal individual  rights and liberty. In a word, she has begun to be an individualistic  nation. She has introduced a social order fitted to a wide development  of personality.    The importance of the second line of progress, the physical, would  seem to be too obvious to call for any detailed consideration. But so  much has been said by both graceful and able writers on Japan as to  the advantages she enjoys from her simple non-mechanical civilization,  and the mistake she is making in adopting the mechanical civilization  of the West, that it may not be amiss to dwell for a few moments upon  it. I wish to show that the second element of progress consists in the  _increasing use of mechanisms_.    The enthusiastic admirer of Japan hardly finds words wherewith  sufficiently to praise the simplicity of her pre-Meiji civilization.  No furniture brings confusion to the room; no machinery distresses the  ear with its groanings or the eye with its unsightliness. No factories  blacken the sky with smoke. No trains screeching through the towns and  cities disturb sleepers and frighten babies. The simple bed on the  floor, the straw sandal on the foot, wooden chopsticks in place of  knives and forks, the small variety of foods and of cooking utensils,  the simple, homespun cotton clothing, the fascinating homes, so small  and neat and clean--in truth all that pertains to Old Japan finds  favor in the eyes of the enthusiastic admirer from the Occident. One  such writer, in an elaborate paper intended to set forth the  superiority of the original Japanese to the Occidental civilization,  uses the following language: \"Ability to live without furniture,  without impedimenta, with the least possible amount of neat clothing,  shows more than the advantage held by the Japanese race in the  struggle of life; it shows also the real character of some of the  weaknesses in our own civilization. It forces reflection upon the  useless multiplicity of our daily wants. We must have meat and bread  and butter; glass windows and fire; hats, white shirts, and woolen  underwear; boots and shoes; trunks, bags, and boxes; bedsteads,  mattresses, sheets, and blankets; all of which a Japanese can do  without, and is really better off without.\"[G] Surely one finds much  of truth in this, and there is no denying the charm of the simpler  civilization, but the closing phrase of the quotation is the  assumption without discussion of the disputed point. Are the Japanese  really better off without these implements of Western civilization?  Evidently they themselves do not think so. For, in glancing through  the list as given by the writer quoted, one realizes the extent of  Japanese adoption of these Western devices. Hardly an article but is  used in Japan, and certainly with the supposition of the purchaser  that it adds either to his health or his comfort. In witness are the  hundreds of thousands of straw hats, the glass windows everywhere,  and the meat-shops in each town and city of the Empire. The charm of a  foreign fashion is not sufficient explanation for the rapidly  spreading use of foreign inventions.    That there are no useless or even evil features in our Western  civilization is not for a moment contended. The stiff starched shirt  may certainly be asked to give an account of itself and justify its  continued existence, if it can. But I think the proposition is capable  of defense that the vast majority of the implements of our Occidental  civilization have their definite place and value, either in  contributing directly to the comfort and happiness of their possessor,  or in increasing his health and strength and general mental and  physical power. What is it that makes the Occidental longer-lived than  the Japanese? Why is he healthier? Why is he more intelligent? Why is  he a more developed personality? Why are his children more energetic?  Or, reversing the questions, why has the population of Japan been  increasing with leaps and bounds since the introduction of Western  civilization and medical science? Why is the rising generation so free  from pockmarks? Why is the number of the blind steadily diminishing?  Why are mechanisms multiplying so rapidly--the jinrikisha, the  railroads, the roads, the waterworks and sewers, the chairs, the  tables, the hats and umbrellas, lamps, clocks, glass windows and  shoes? A hundred similar questions might be asked, to which no  definite answers are needful.    Further discussion of details seems unnecessary. Yet the full  significance of this point can hardly be appreciated without a  perception of the great principle that underlies it. The only way in  which man has become and continues to be increasingly superior to  animals is in his use of mechanisms. The animal does by brute force  what man accomplishes by various devices. The inventiveness of  different races differs vastly. But everywhere, the most advanced are  the most powerful. Take the individual man of the more developed race  and separate him from his tools and machines, and it is doubtless  true that he cannot in some selected points compete with an individual  of a less developed race. But let ten thousand men of the higher  development compete with ten thousand of the lower, each using the  mechanisms under his control, and can there be any doubt as to which  is the superior?    In other words, the method of human progress consists, in no small  degree, in the progressive mastery of nature, first through  understanding her and then through the use of her immense forces by  means of suitable mechanisms. All the machines and furniture, and  tools and clothing, and houses and canned foods, and shoes and boots,  and railroads and telegraph lines, and typewriters and watches, and  the ten thousand other so-called \"impedimenta\" of the Occidental  civilization are but devices whereby Western man has sought to  increase his health, his wealth, his knowledge, his comfort, his  independence, his capacity of travel--in a word, his well-being.  Through these mechanisms he masters nature. He extracts a rich living  from nature; he annihilates time and space; he defies the storms; he  tunnels the mountains; he extracts precious ores and metals from the  rock-ribbed hills; with a magic touch he loosens the grip of the  elements and makes them surrender their gold, their silver, and, more  precious still, their iron; with these he builds his spacious cities  and parks, his railroads and ocean steamers; he travels the whole  world around, fearing neither beast nor alien man; all are subject to  his command and will. He investigates and knows the constitution of  stellar worlds no less than that of the world in which he lives. By  his instruments he explores the infinite depths of heaven and the no  less infinite depths of the microscopic world. All these reviled  \"impedimenta\" thus bring to the race that has them a wealth of life  both physical and psychical, practical and ideal, that is otherwise  unattainable. By them he gains and gives external expression to the  reality of his inner nature, his freedom, his personality. True,  instead of bringing health and long life, knowledge and deep  enjoyment, they may become the means of bitterest curses. But the  lesson to learn from this fact is how to use these powers aright, not  how to forbid their use altogether. They are not to be branded as  hindrances to progress.    The defect of Occidental civilization to-day is hot its multiplicity  of machinery, but the defective view that still blinds the eyes of the  multitude as to the true nature and the legitimate goal of progress.  Individual, selfish happiness is still the ideal of too many men and"]]]
