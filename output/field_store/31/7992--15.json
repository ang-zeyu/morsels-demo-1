I'm to have a scholarship  for two years that will cover board and tuition.  It was founded for  'marked proficiency in English with general excellency in other lines.'  And I've won it!  I applied for it before I left, but I didn't have an  idea I'd get it, on account of my Freshman bad work in maths and Latin.  But it seems I've made it up.  I am awfully glad, Daddy, because now I  won't be such a burden to you.  The monthly allowance will be all I'll  need, and maybe I can earn that with writing or tutoring or something.    I'm LONGING to go back and begin work.                       Yours ever,                                             Jerusha Abbott,                                   Author of When the Sophomores Won                                 the Game.

Our study is better than  ever this year--faces the South with two huge windows and oh!  so  furnished.  Julia, with an unlimited allowance, arrived two days early  and was attacked with a fever for settling.    We have new wall paper and oriental rugs and mahogany chairs--not  painted mahogany which made us sufficiently happy last year, but real.  It's very gorgeous, but I don't feel as though I belonged in it; I'm  nervous all the time for fear I'll get an ink spot in the wrong place.    And, Daddy, I found your letter waiting for me--pardon--I mean your  secretary's.    Will you kindly convey to me a comprehensible reason why I should not  accept that scholarship?  I don't understand your objection in the  least.  But anyway, it won't do the slightest good for you to object,  for I've already accepted it and I am not going to change!  That sounds  a little impertinent, but I don't mean it so.    I suppose you feel that when you set out to educate me, you'd like to  finish the work, and put a neat period, in the shape of a diploma, at  the end.    But look at it just a second from my point of view.  I shall owe my  education to you just as much as though I let you pay for the whole of  it, but I won't be quite so much indebted.  I know that you don't want  me to return the money, but nevertheless, I am going to want to do it,  if I possibly can; and winning this scholarship makes it so much  easier.  I was expecting to spend the rest of my life in paying my  debts, but now I shall only have to spend one-half of the rest of it.    I hope you understand my position and won't be cross.  The allowance I  shall still most gratefully accept.  It requires an allowance to live  up to Julia and her furniture!  I wish that she had been reared to  simpler tastes, or else that she were not my room-mate.    This isn't much of a letter; I meant to have written a lot--but I've  been hemming four window curtains and three portieres (I'm glad you  can't see the length of the stitches), and polishing a brass desk set  with tooth powder (very uphill work), and sawing off picture wire with  manicure scissors, and unpacking four boxes of books, and putting away  two trunkfuls of clothes (it doesn't seem believable that Jerusha  Abbott owns two trunks full of clothes, but she does!) and welcoming  back fifty dear friends in between.    Opening day is a joyous occasion!    Good night, Daddy dear, and don't be annoyed because your chick is  wanting to scratch for herself.  She's growing up into an awfully  energetic little hen--with a very determined cluck and lots of  beautiful feathers (all due to you).                               Affectionately,                                                 Judy                                                         30th September    Dear Daddy,    Are you still harping on that scholarship?  I never knew a man so  obstinate, and stubborn and unreasonable, and tenacious, and  bull-doggish, and unable-to-see-other-people's-point-of-view, as you.    You prefer that I should not be accepting favours from strangers.    Strangers!--And what are you, pray?    Is there anyone in the world that I know less?  I shouldn't recognize  you if I met you in the street.  Now, you see, if you had been a sane,  sensible person and had written nice, cheering fatherly letters to your  little Judy, and had come occasionally and patted her on the head, and  had said you were glad she was such a good girl--Then, perhaps, she  wouldn't have flouted you in your old age, but would have obeyed your  slightest wish like the dutiful daughter she was meant to be.    Strangers indeed!  You live in a glass house, Mr. Smith.    And besides, this isn't a favour; it's like a prize--I earned it by  hard work.  If nobody had been good enough in English, the committee  wouldn't have awarded the scholarship; some years they don't. Also--  But what's the use of arguing with a man?  You belong, Mr. Smith, to a  sex devoid of a sense of logic.  To bring a man into line, there are  just two methods:  one must either coax or be disagreeable.  I scorn to  coax men for what I wish.  Therefore, I must be disagreeable.    I refuse, sir, to give up the scholarship; and if you make any more  fuss, I won't accept the monthly allowance either, but will wear myself  into a nervous wreck tutoring stupid Freshmen.    That is my ultimatum!    And listen--I have a further thought.  Since you are so afraid that by  taking this scholarship I am depriving someone else of an education, I  know a way out.  You can apply the money that you would have spent for  me towards educating some other little girl from the John Grier Home.  Don't you think that's a nice idea?  Only, Daddy, EDUCATE the new girl  as much as you choose, but please don't LIKE her any better than me.    I trust that your secretary won't be hurt because I pay so little  attention to the suggestions offered in his letter, but I can't help it  if he is.  He's a spoiled child, Daddy.  I've meekly given in to his  whims heretofore, but this time I intend to be FIRM.    Yours,         With a mind,             Completely and Irrevocably and                 World-without-End Made-up,                                            Jerusha Abbott                                                             9th November    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    I started down town today to buy a bottle of shoe blacking and some  collars and the material for a new blouse and a jar of violet cream and  a cake of Castile soap--all very necessary; I couldn't be happy another  day without them--and when I tried to pay the car fare, I found that I  had left my purse in the pocket of my other coat.  So I had to get out  and take the next car, and was late for gymnasium.    It's a dreadful thing to have no memory and two coats!    Julia Pendleton has invited me to visit her for the Christmas holidays.  How does that strike you, Mr. Smith?  Fancy Jerusha Abbott, of the John  Grier Home, sitting at the tables of the rich.  I don't know why Julia  wants me--she seems to be getting quite attached to me of late.  I  should, to tell the truth, very much prefer going to Sallie's, but  Julia asked me first, so if I go anywhere it must be to New York  instead of to Worcester.  I'm rather awed at the prospect of meeting  Pendletons EN MASSE, and also I'd have to get a lot of new clothes--so,  Daddy dear, if you write that you would prefer having me remain quietly  at college, I will bow to your wishes with my usual sweet docility.    I'm engaged at odd moments with the Life and Letters of Thomas  Huxley--it makes nice, light reading to pick up between times.  Do you  know what an archaeopteryx is?  It's a bird.  And a stereognathus?  I'm  not sure myself, but I think it's a missing link, like a bird with  teeth or a lizard with wings.  No, it isn't either; I've just looked in  the book.  It's a mesozoic mammal.    I've elected economics this year--very illuminating subject.  When I  finish that I'm going to take Charity and Reform; then, Mr. Trustee,  I'll know just how an orphan asylum ought to be run.  Don't you think  I'd make an admirable voter if I had my rights?  I was twenty-one last  week.  This is an awfully wasteful country to throw away such an  honest, educated, conscientious, intelligent citizen as I would be.                               Yours always,                                                 Judy                                                         7th December    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Thank you for permission to visit Julia--I take it that silence means  consent.    Such a social whirl as we've been having!  The Founder's dance came  last week--this was the first year that any of us could attend; only  upper classmen being allowed.    I invited Jimmie McBride, and Sallie invited his room-mate at  Princeton, who visited them last summer at their camp--an awfully nice  man with red hair--and Julia invited a man from New York, not very  exciting, but socially irreproachable.  He is connected with the De la  Mater Chichesters.  Perhaps that means something to you?  It doesn't  illuminate me to any extent.    However--our guests came Friday afternoon in time for tea in the senior  corridor, and then dashed down to the hotel for dinner.  The hotel was  so full that they slept in rows on the billiard tables, they say.  Jimmie McBride says that the next time he is bidden to a social event  in this college, he is going to bring one of their Adirondack tents and  pitch it on the campus.    At seven-thirty they came back for the President's reception and dance.  Our functions commence early!  We had the men's cards all made out  ahead of time, and after every dance, we'd leave them in groups, under  the letter that stood for their names, so that they could be readily  found by their next partners.  Jimmie McBride, for example, would stand  patiently under 'M' until he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15707"],[0,"Zoonomia; Or, the Laws of Organic Life, Vol. I (#15)"],[1,"of sensorial power remains the same, and the quantity of  stimulus be lessened, a weakness of the fibrous contractions ensues, which  may be denominated _debility from defect of stimulus_. If the quantity of  stimulus remains the same, and the quantity of sensorial power be lessened,  another kind of weakness ensues, which may be termed _debility from defect  of sensorial power_; the former of these is called by Dr. Brown, in his  Elements of Medicine, direct debility, and the latter indirect debility.  The coincidence of some parts of this work with correspondent deductions in  the Brunonian Elementa Medicina, a work (with some exceptions) of great  genius, must be considered as confirmations of the truth of the theory, as  they were probably arrived at by different trains of reasoning.    Thus in those who have been exposed to cold and hunger there is a  deficiency of stimulus. While in nervous fever there is a deficiency of  sensorial power. And in habitual drunkards, in a morning before their usual  potation, there is a deficiency both of stimulus and of sensorial power.  While, on the other hand, in the beginning of intoxication there is an  excess of stimulus; in the hot-ach, after the hands have been immersed in  snow, there is a redundancy of sensorial power; and in inflammatory  diseases with arterial strength, there is an excess of both.    Hence if the sensorial power be lessened, while the quantity of stimulus  remains the same as in nervous fever, the frequency of repetition of the  arterial contractions may continue, but their force in respect to removing  obstacles, as in promoting the circulation of the blood, or the velocity of  each contraction, will be diminished, that is, the animal strength will be  lessened. And secondly, if the quantity of sensorial power be lessened, and  the stimulus be increased to a certain degree, as in giving opium in  nervous fevers, the arterial contractions may be performed more frequently  than natural, yet with less strength.    And thirdly, if the sensorial power continues the same in respect to  quantity, and the stimulus be somewhat diminished, as in going into a  darkish room, or into a coldish bath, suppose of about eighty degrees of  heat, as Buxton-bath, a temporary weakness of the affected fibres is  induced, till an accumulation of sensorial power gradually succeeds, and  counterbalances the deficiency of stimulus, and then the bath ceases to  feel cold, and the room ceases to appear dark; because the fibres of the  subcutaneous vessels, or of the organs of sense, act with their usual  energy.    A set of muscular fibres may thus be stimulated into violent exertion, that  is, they may act frequently, and with their whole sensorial power, but may  nevertheless not act strongly; because the quantity of their sensorial  power was originally small, or was previously exhausted. Hence a stimulus  may be great, and the irritation in consequence act with its full force, as  in the hot paroxysms of nervous fever; but if the sensorial power, termed  irritation, be small in quantity, the force of the fibrous contractions,  and the times of their continuance in their contracted state, will be  proportionally small.    In the same manner in the hot paroxysm of putrid fevers, which are shewn in  Sect. XXXIII. to be inflammatory fevers with arterial debility, the  sensorial power termed sensation is exerted with great activity, yet the  fibrous contractions, which produce the circulation of the blood, are  performed without strength, because the quantity of sensorial power then  residing in that part of the system is small.    Thus in irritative fever with arterial strength, that is, with excess of  spirit of animation, the quantity of exertion during the hot part of the  paroxysm is to be estimated from the quantity of stimulus, and the quantity  of sensorial power. While in sensitive (or inflammatory) fever with  arterial strength, that is, with excess of spirit of animation, the violent  and forcible actions of the vascular system during the hot part of the  paroxysm are induced by the exertions of two sensorial powers, which are  excited by two kinds of stimulus. These are the sensorial power of  irritation excited by the stimulus of bodies external to the moving fibres,  and the sensorial power of sensation excited by the pain in consequence of  the increased contractions of those moving fibres.    And in insane people in some cases the force of their muscular actions will  be in proportion to the quantity of sensorial power, which they possess,  and the quantity of the stimulus of desire or aversion, which excites their  volition into action. At the same time in other cases the stimulus of pain  or pleasure, and the stimulus of external bodies, may excite into action  the sensorial powers of sensation and irritation, and thus add greater  force to their muscular actions.    2. The application of the stimulus, whether that stimulus be some quality  of external bodies, or pleasure or pain, or desire or aversion, or a link  of association, excites the correspondent sensorial power into action, and  this causes the contraction of the fibre. On the contraction of the fibre a  part of the spirit of animation becomes expended, and the fibre ceases to  contract, though the stimulus continues to be applied; till in a certain  time the fibre having received a supply of sensorial power is ready to  contract again, if the stimulus continues to be applied. If the stimulus on  the contrary be withdrawn, the same quantity of quiescent sensorial power  becomes resident in the fibre as before its contraction; as appears from  the readiness for action of the large locomotive muscles of the body in a  short time after common exertion.    But in those muscular fibres, which are subject to constant stimulus, as  the arteries, glands, and capillary vessels, another phenomenon occurs, if  their accustomed stimulus be withdrawn; which is, that the sensorial power  becomes accumulated in the contractile fibres, owing to the want of its  being perpetually expended, or carried away, by their usual unremitted  contractions. And on this account those muscular fibres become afterwards  excitable into their natural actions by a much weaker stimulus; or into  unnatural violence of action by their accustomed stimulus, as is seen in  the hot fits of intermittent fevers, which are in consequence of the  previous cold ones. Thus the minute vessels of the skin are constantly  stimulated by the fluid matter of heat; if the quantity of this stimulus of  heat be a while diminished, as in covering the hands with snow, the vessels  cease to act, as appears from the paleness of the skin; if this cold  application of snow be continued but a short time, the sensorial power,  which had habitually been supplied to the fibres, becomes now accumulated  in them, owing to the want of its being expended by their accustomed  contractions. And thence a less stimulus of heat will now excite them into  violent contractions.    If the quiescence of fibres, which had previously been subject to perpetual  stimulus, continues a longer time; or their accustomed stimulus be more  completely withdrawn; the accumulation of sensorial power becomes still  greater, as in those exposed to cold and hunger; pain is produced, and the  organ gradually dies from the chemical changes, which take place in it; or  it is at a great distance of time restored to action by stimulus applied  with great caution in small quantity, as happens to some larger animals and  to many insects, which during the winter months lie benumbed with cold, and  are said to sleep, and to persons apparently drowned, or apparently frozen  to death. Snails have been said to revive by throwing them into water after  having been many years shut up in the cabinets of the curious; and eggs and  seeds in general are restored to life after many months of torpor by the  stimulus of warmth and moisture.    The inflammation of schirrous tumours, which have long existed in a state  of inaction, is a process of this kind; as well as the sensibility acquired  by inflamed tendons and bones, which had at their formation a similar  sensibility, which had so long lain dormant in their uninflamed state.    3. If after long quiescence from defect of stimulus the fibres, which had  previously been habituated to perpetual stimulus, are again exposed to but  their usual quantity of it; as in those who have suffered the extremes of  cold or hunger; a violent exertion of the affected organ commences, owing,  as above explained, to the great accumulation of sensorial power. This  violent exertion not only diminishes the accumulated spirit of animation,  but at the same time induces pleasure or pain into the system, which,  whether it be succeeded by inflammation or not, becomes an additional  stimulus, and acting along with the former one, produces still greater  exertions; and thus reduces the sensorial power in the contracting fibres  beneath its natural quantity.    When the spirit of animation is thus exhausted by useless exertions, the  organ becomes torpid or unexcitable into action, and a second fit of  quiescence succeeds that of abundant activity. During this second fit of  quiescence the sensorial power becomes again accumulated, and another fit  of exertion follows in train. These vicissitudes of exertion and inertion  of the arterial system constitute the paroxysms of remittent fevers; or  intermittent ones, when there is an interval of the natural action of the  arteries between the exacerbations.    In these paroxysms of fevers, which consist of the libration of the  arterial system between the extremes of exertion and quiescence, either the  fits become less and less violent from the contractile fibres becoming  coming less excitable to the stimulus by habit, that is, by becoming  accustomed to it, as explained below XII. 3. 1. or the whole sensorial  power"]]]
