The step was not a long one to the thesis that \"disorder and confusion  are the pledge of true efficiency\"--such being one of the  \"seed-thoughts\" of Novalis. In mixing all species, Romanticism amounts  to unchartered freedom, \"_die gesunde, kraeftige Ungezogenheit_.\" It is  no wonder that so many of its literary works remain unfinished  fragments, and that many of its exponents led unregulated lives.    \"Get you irony, and form yourself to urbanity\" is the counsel of  Friedrich Schlegel. The unbridgeable chasm between Ideal and Life  could not be spanned, and the baffled idealist met this hopelessness  with the shrug of irony. The every-day enthusiasm of the common life  invited only a sneer, often, it is true, associated with flashing wit.    Among its more pleasing manifestations, Romanticism shows a remarkable  group of gifted, capable women, possibly because this philosophy of  intuition corresponds to the higher intimations of woman's soul. Other  obvious fruits of the movement were the revival of the poetry and  dignity of the Middle Ages, both in art and life--that colorful,  form-loving musical era which the Age of Enlightenment had so crassly  despised. That this yearning for the beautiful background led to  reaction in politics and religion is natural enough; more edifying are  the rich fruits which scholarship recovered when Romanticism had  directed it into the domains of German antiquity and philology, and  the wealth of popular song. In addition to these, we must reckon the  spoils which these adventurers brought back from their quest into the  faery lands of Poetry in southern climes.    When all is said, and in spite of Romanticism's weak and unmanly  quitting of the field of duty, in spite of certain tendencies to  ignore and supersede the adamant foundations of morality upon which  the \"humanities\" as well as society rest, one cannot quite help hoping  that somehow good may be the final hint of it all. Like Mary Stuart,  it is, at least, somewhat better than its worst repute, as formulated  by its enemies. Estimates change; even the excellent Wordsworth was  held by the English reviewers to be fantastic and vague in his _Ode to  Duty_. We should not forget that the most shocking pronouncements of  the Romanticists were uttered half-ironically, to say the least. After  its excursion into the fantastic jungle of Romanticism, the world has  found it restful and restorative, to be sure, to return to the limited  perfection of the serene and approved classics; yet perchance it _is_  the last word of all philosophy that the astounding circumambient  Universe is almost entirely unperceived by our senses and reasoning  powers.    Let us confess, and without apology, that the country which claims a  Hawthorne, a Poe, and a youthful Longfellow, can never surrender  unconditionally its hold upon the \"True Romance:\"      \"Through wantonness if men profess    They weary of Thy parts,    E'en let them die at blasphemy    And perish with their arts;    But we that love, but we that prove    Thine excellence august,    While we adore discover more    Thee perfect, wise, and just....      A veil to draw 'twixt God His Law    And Man's infirmity;    A shadow kind to dumb and blind    The shambles where we die;    A sum to trick th' arithmetic    Too base of leaguing odds;    The spur of trust, the curb of lust--    Thou handmaid of the Gods!\"          AUGUST WILHELM SCHLEGEL           *       *       *       *       *    LECTURES ON DRAMATIC ART[11] (1809)    TRANSLATED BY JOHN BLACK    LECTURE XXII    Comparison of the English and Spanish Theatres--Spirit of the Romantic  Drama--Shakespeare--His age and the circumstances of his Life.    In conformity with the plan which we laid down at the first, we shall  now proceed to treat of the English and Spanish theatres. We have  been, on various occasions, compelled in passing to allude cursorily,  sometimes to the one and sometimes to the other, partly for the sake  of placing, by means of contrast, many ideas in a clearer light, and  partly on account of the influence which these stages have had on the  theatres of other countries. Both the English and Spaniards possess a  very rich dramatic literature, both have had a number of prolific and  highly talented dramatists, among whom even the least admired and  celebrated, considered as a whole, display uncommon aptitude for  dramatic animation and insight into the essence of theatrical effect.  The history of their theatres has no connection with that of the  Italians and French, for they developed themselves wholly out of the  abundance of their own intrinsic energy, without any foreign  influence: the attempts to bring them back to an imitation of the  ancients, or even of the French, have either been attended with no  success, or not been made till a late period in the decay of the  drama. The formation of these two stages, again, is equally  independent of each other; the Spanish poets were altogether  unacquainted with the English; and in the older and most important  period of the English theatre I could discover no trace of any  knowledge of Spanish plays (though their novels and romances were  certainly known), and it was not till the time of Charles II. that  translations from Calderon first made their appearance.    So many things among men have been handed down from century to century  and from nation to nation, and the human mind is in general so slow to  invent, that originality in any department of mental exertion is  everywhere a rare phenomenon. We are desirous of seeing the result of  the efforts of inventive geniuses when, regardless of what in the same  line has elsewhere been carried to a high degree of perfection, they  set to work in good earnest to invent altogether for themselves; when  they lay the foundation of the new edifice on uncovered ground, and  draw all the preparations, all the building materials, from their own  resources. We participate, in some measure, in the joy of success,  when we see them advance rapidly from their first helplessness and  need to a finished mastery in their art. The history of the Grecian  theatre would afford us this cheering prospect could we witness its  rudest beginnings, which were not preserved, for they were not even  committed to writing; but it is easy, when we compare AEschylus and  Sophocles, to form some idea of the preceding period. The Greeks  neither inherited nor borrowed their dramatic art from any other  people; it was original and native, and for that very reason was it  able to produce a living and powerful effect. But it ended with the  period when Greeks imitated Greeks; namely, when the Alexandrian poets  began learnedly and critically to compose dramas after the model of  the great tragic writers. The reverse of this was the case with the  Romans; they received the form and substance of their dramas from the  Greeks; they never attempted to act according to their own discretion,  or to express their own way of thinking; and hence they occupy so  insignificant a place in the history of dramatic art. Among the  nations of modern Europe, the English and Spaniards alone (for the  German stage is but forming) possess as yet a theatre entirely  original and national, which, in its own peculiar shape, has  arrived at maturity.    [Illustration: #AUGUST WILHELM SCHLEGEL#]    Those critics who consider the authority of the ancients, as models,  to be such that in poetry, as in all the other arts, there can be no  safety out of the pale of imitation, affirm that, as the nations in  question have not followed this course, they have brought nothing but  irregular works on the stage, which, though they may possess  occasional passages of splendor and beauty, must yet, as a whole, be  forever reprobated as barbarous and wanting in form. We have already,  in the introductory part of these Lectures, stated our sentiments  generally on this way of thinking; but we must now examine the subject  somewhat more closely.    If the assertion be well founded, all that distinguishes the works of  the greatest English and Spanish dramatists, a Shakespeare and a  Calderon, must rank them far below the ancients; they could in no wise  be of importance for theory, and would at most appear remarkable, on  the assumption that the obstinacy of these nations in refusing to  comply with the rules may have afforded a more ample field to the  poets to display their native originality, though at the expense of  art. But even this assumption, on a closer examination, appears  extremely questionable. The poetic spirit requires to be limited, that  it may move with a becoming liberty within its proper precincts, as  has been felt by all nations on the first invention of metre; it must  act according to laws derivable from its own essence, otherwise its  strength will evaporate in boundless vacuity.    The works of genius cannot therefore be permitted to be without form;  but of this there is no danger. However, that we may answer this  objection of want of form, we must understand the exact meaning of the  term \"form,\" since most critics, and more especially those who insist  on a stiff regularity, interpret it merely in a mechanical, and not in  an organical sense. Form is mechanical when, through external force,  it is imparted to any material merely as an accidental addition  without reference to its quality; as, for example, when we give a  particular shape to a soft mass that it may retain the same after its  induration. Organical form, again, is innate; it unfolds itself from  within, and requires its determination contemporaneously with the  perfect development of the germ. We everywhere discover such forms in  nature throughout the whole range of living powers, from the  crystallization of salts and minerals to plants and flowers, and from  these again to the human body.

CHAPTER X    DORMITORY LIFE         [Greek: Aspasiae trillistos hepaeluths nux herebennae.]       HOM.    For a few days after the Sunday walk narrated in the last chapter, Upton  and Eric cut each other dead. Upton was angry at Eric's declining the  honor of his company, and Eric was piqued at Upton's unreasonableness.  In the \"taking up\" system, such quarrels were of frequent occurrence,  and as the existence of a misunderstanding was generally indicated in  this very public way, the variations of good will between such friends  generally excited no little notice and amusement among the other boys.  But both Upton and Eric were too sensible to carry their differences so  far as others similarly circumstanced; each thoroughly enjoyed the  other's company, and they generally seized an early opportunity for  effecting a reconciliation, which united them more firmly than ever.    As soon as Eric had got over his little pique, he made the first  advances, by writing a note to Upton, which he slipped under his study  door, and which ran as follows:--    \"Dear Horace--Don't let us quarrel about nothing. Silly fellow, why  should you be angry with me because for once I wanted to go a walk with  Russell, who, by the bye, is twice as good a fellow as you? I shall  expect you to make it up directly after prayers.--Yours, if you are not  silly, E.W.\"    The consequence was, that as they came out from prayers, Upton seized  Eric's hand, and slapped him on the back, after which they had a good  laugh over their own foolish fracas, and ran up stairs chattering  merrily.    \"There's to be an awful lark in the dormitories tonight,\" said Eric;  \"the doctor's gone to a dinner-party, and we're going to have no end  of fun.\"    \"Are you? Well, if it gets amusing, come to my study and tell me, I'll  come and look on.\"    \"Very well; depend upon it, I'll come.\" And they parted at the foot of  the study stairs.    It was Mr. Rose's night of duty. He walked slowly up and down the range  of Dormitories until every boy seemed ready to get into bed, and then he  put out all the candles. So long as he was present, the boys observed  the utmost quiet and decorum. All continued quite orderly until he had  passed away through the lavatory, and one of the boys following him as a  scout, had seen the last glimmer of his candle disappear round the  corner at the foot of the great staircase, and heard the library door  close behind him.    After that, particularly as Dr. Rowlands was absent, the boys knew that  they were safe from disturbance, and the occupants of No. 7 were the  first to stir.    \"Now for some fun,\" said Duncan, starting up, and by way of initiative  pitching his pillow at Eric's head.    \"I'll pay you out for that when I'm ready,\" said Eric, laughing; \"but  give us a match, first.\"    Duncan produced some vestas, and no sooner had they lighted their  candle, than several of the dormitory doors began to be thrown open, and  one after another all requested a light, which Duncan and Eric conveyed  to them in a sort of emulous lampadephoria, so that a length all the  twelve dormitories had their sconces lit, and the boys began all sorts  of amusement, some in their night-shirts and others with their trousers  slipped on. Leap-frog was the prevalent game for a time, but at last  Graham suggested theatricals, and they were agreed on.    \"But we're making a regular knock-me-down shindy,\" said Llewellyn;  \"somebody must keep cave.\"    \"O, old Rose is safe enough at his Hebrew in the library; no fear of  disturbing him if we were dancing hippopotami,\" answered Graham.    But it was generally considered safest to put some one at the top of the  stairs, in case of an unexpected diversion in that direction, and little  Wright consented to go first. He had only to leave the lavatory door  open; and stand at the top of the staircase, and he then commanded for a  great distance the only avenue in which danger was expected. If any  master's candle appeared n the hall, the boys had full three minutes'  warning, and a single loudly-whispered \"cave\" would cause some one in  each dormitory instantly to \"douse the glim,\" and shut the door; so that  by the time of the adversary's arrival, they would all be (of course)  fast asleep in bed, some of them snoring in an alarming manner. Whatever  noise the master might have heard, it would be impossible to fix it on  any of the sleepers.    So at the top of the stairs stood little Wright, shoeless, and shivering  in his night-gown, but keenly entering into the fun, and not  unconscious of the dignity of his position. Meanwhile the rest were  getting up a scenic representation of Bombastes Furioso, arranging a  stage, piling a lot of beds together for a theatre, and dressing up the  actors in the most fantastic apparel.    The impromptu Bombastes excited universal applause, and just at the end  Wright ran in through the lavatory.    \"I say,\" said the little fellow, \"it's jolly cold standing at the top of  the stairs. Won't some one relieve guard?\"    \"O, I will,\" answered Eric, good-naturedly; \"it's a shame that one  fellow should have all the bother and none of the fun;\" and he ran to  take Wright's post.    After watching a minute or two, he felt sure that there was no danger,  and therefore ran up to Upton's study for a change.    \"Well, what's up?\" said the study-boy, approvingly, as he glanced at  Eric's laughing eyes.    \"O, we've been having leap-frog, and then Bombastes Furioso. But I'm  keeping 'cave' now; only it's so cold that I thought I'd run up to  your study.\"    \"Little traitor; we'll shoot you for a deserting sentinel.\"    \"O no;\" said Eric, \"it's all serene; Rowley's out, and dear old Rose'd  never dream of supposing us elsewhere than in the arms of Morpheus.  Besides the fellows are making less row now.\"    \"Well! look here! let's go and look on, and I'll tell you a dodge; put  one of the tin washing-basins against the iron door of the lavatory, and  then if any one comes he'll make clang enough to wake dead; and while  he's amusing himself with this, there'll be lots of time to 'extinguish  the superfluous abundance of the nocturnal illuminators.' Eh?\"    \"Capital!\" said Eric, \"come along.\"    They went down and arranged the signal very artistically, leaving the  iron door ajar a little, and then neatly poising the large tin basin on  its edge, so as to lean against it. Having extremely enjoyed this part  of the proceeding, they went to look at the theatricals again, the boys  being highly delighted at Upton's appearance among them.    They at once made Eric take a part in some very distant reminiscences of  Macbeth, and corked his cheeks with whiskers and mustachios to make him  resemble Banquo, his costume being completed by a girdle round his  nightshirt, consisting of a very fine crimson silk handkerchief, richly  broidered with gold, which had been brought to him from India, and which  at first, in the innocence of his heart, he used to wear on Sundays,  until he acquired the sobriquet of \"the Dragon.\" Duncan made a  superb Macbeth.    They were doing the dagger-scene, which was put on the stage in a most  novel manner. A sheet had been pinned from the top of the room, on one  side of which stood a boy with a broken dinner knife, the handle end of  which he was pushing through a hole in the middle of the sheet at the  shadow of Duncan on the other side.    Duncan himself, in an attitude of intensely affected melodrama, was  spouting--         \"Is this a dagger which I see before me?       The handle towards me now? come, let me clutch thee;\"    And he snatched convulsively at the handle of the protruded knife; but  as soon as he nearly touched it, this end was immediately withdrawn, and  the blade end substituted, which made the comic Macbeth instantly draw  back again, and recommence his apostrophe. This scene had tickled the  audience immensely, and Duncan, amid shouts of laughter, was just  drawing the somewhat unwarrantable conclusion that it was         \"A dagger of the mind, a false creation,\"    when a sudden grating, followed by a reverbrated clang, produced a dead  silence.    \"Cave,\" shouted Eric, and took a flying leap into his bed. Instantly  there was a bolt in different directions; the sheet was torn down, the  candles dashed out, the beds shoved aside, and the dormitories at once  plunged in profound silence, only broken by the heavy breathing of  sleepers, when in strode--not Mr. Rose or any of the under  masters--but--Dr. Rowlands himself!    He stood for a moment to survey the scene. All the dormitory doors were  wide open; the sheet which had formed the stage curtain lay torn on the  floor of No. 7; the beds in all the adjoining rooms were in the  strangest positions; and half-extinguished wicks still smouldered in  several of the sconces. Every boy was in bed, but the extraordinary way  in which the bed clothes were huddled about told an unmistakeable tale.    He glanced quickly round, but the moment he had passed into No. 8, he  heard a run, and, turning, just caught sight of Upton's figure vanishing  into the darkness of the lavatory, towards the study stairs.    He said not a word, but stalked hastily through all dormitories, again  stopping at No. 7 on his return.    He heard nothing but the deep snores of Duncan, and instantly fixed on  him as a chief culprit.    \"Duncan!\"    No reply; but calm stertorous music from Duncan's bed.    \"Duncan!\" he said, still louder and more sternly, \"you sleep soundly,  sir, too soundly; get up directly,\" and he laid his hand on the  boy's arm.    \"Get away, you old donkey,\" said Duncan sleepily; \"'t, aint time to get  up yet. First bell hasn't rung.\"    \"Come, sir, this shamming will only increase your punishment;\" but the  imperturbable Duncan stretched himself"]]]
