This, with a  multitude of similar facts, will shew that there are few who do not  become more depraved, and leave such places worse than when they  entered them. A gentleman who visited Newgate informed me that he had  been very much surprised at finding so many children there; some of  whom were ironed; and on his inquiring the cause of such severity  towards children so young, he was told by one of the turnkeys, that  _he had snuck more trouble with them than he had with old offenders_.  This fact has been verified by the chief officers of the Wakefield  Model Prison,--the boys give most trouble. In the matter of treating  juveniles as delinquents, I am sure we are wrong. I have seen both the  magistrates and the judges insulted on the bench by juveniles brought  before them, and taunted with the following: \"You can do no more, you  with the big wig! I wish you may sit there until I come out!\" And in  the month of May, 1852, the magistrates of Wakefield were insulted by  a boy 15 years old, who had been taken up as an impostor, with his  arm doubled in a sling, and shamming to be deaf and dumb,--a healthy  strong youth, able and fit for work--and when asked why he did not  work, answered, because he could get more by his own method! Hear!  this ye indiscriminate alms-givers! And, further, when expostulated  with by the magistrates for the sin and wickedness of pretending to  be lame, &c., he laughed at them outright for being so silly as to  suppose that he should not _live well if he could?_ When told he  should be committed for three months, he had the impudence to tell the  court that he would do the same again, when he came out, clapped his  hat on in open defiance, and shouted, \"That's all you can do!\" The  chairman expressed sorrow that he could not order a whipping, but  the prisoner laughed at him, and said, \"I am too old for that.\" Such  things were not known in my younger days. I am afraid we have erred  in this matter. A little wholesome correction did wonders. In such  matters, it, at least, made the parties civil, and, I think, deterred  from crime. I am fearful that in this age mankind aim in some things  to be more perfect than the Great Ruler of the Universe!    To the bad habits of a prison, and the association with guilt, must be  added the deplorably unprovided state, in which, at the termination of  their period of imprisonment, they are sent forth into society. What  friends have they but their former companions? What habitations,  but their former resorts of iniquity? What means of procuring a  livelihood, but their former evil practices? We accordingly find, that  it is not unfrequently the case, with these young offenders, that  scarcely a day elapses after their liberation, before they find  themselves again in custody, and within the walls of a prison. One  cannot, indeed, view the exertions made by the \"Society for the  Improvement of Prison Discipline\" in this respect, without feelings of  gratitude to those who take an active part in it[A]; neither should we  forget to return thanks to the Author of all good, that he should  have encouraged the hearts of persons to venture even their lives, to  improve the condition of the prisoners in Newgate and elsewhere;--that  even females are found, who, conquering the timidity and diffidence  of their sex, have visited these abodes of vice and misery, for the  purpose of ameliorating the condition of their inhabitants. There have  been men, claiming to be considered wise men, who have ridiculed the  exertions of these daughters of philanthropy, and have made them  objects of ridicule, but, happily, they are impervious to the shafts  of folly; and as heedless of the unjust censures, as they are  undesirous of the applause of man. Their aim is, the good of their  fellow-creatures,--their reward, the pleasure of doing good, and the  approbation of Him who is goodness itself. That their well-meant and  praiseworthy exertions are not more successful can only be accounted  for by the awfully depraved affections which habitual vice produces;  when every principle of action, which should be subservient to virtue,  becomes actively employed in the cause of wickedness; for, whatever  may be the impulse which first induces offenders to do wrong, they  become, in course of time, so totally lost to all sense of what is  good as to \"glory in their shame.\" Whether it maybe possible to devise  any plan of prison discipline sufficient to remedy the evil, I  cannot pretend to say; and I shall only repeat the burthen of my  song--_educate and protect the infant poor_; and it will be found that  _to prevent_ is not only better, but easier, than to _cure_.    [Footnote A: I will make a short extract from one of its reports,  to shew, that the chief end they have in view, is the prevention of  crime. They state, that \"in the course of their visit, to the gaols  in the metropolis, the Committee very frequently meet with destitute  boys, who, on their discharge from confinement, literally know not  where to lay their heads. To assist such friendless outcasts has  been the practice of the society; and to render this relief more  efficacious, a temporary refuge has been established for such as  are disposed to abandon their vicious courses. This asylum has been  instrumental in affording assistance to a considerable number of  distressed youths, who, but for this seasonable aid, must have  resorted to criminal practices for support. On admission into this  establishment, the boys are instructed in moral and religious duty,  subjected to habits of order and industry, and after a time are placed  in situations which afford a reasonable prospect of their becoming  honest and useful members of society. To extend these objects, and to  render its exertions more widely beneficial, the society solicits the  aid of public benevolence. Its expenses are unavoidably serious, and  its funds are at present very low; but it is trusted that pecuniary  support will not be withheld, when it is considered, that on the  liberality with which this appeal is answered, depends, in a great  measure, the success of the society's objects--the reformation of the  vicious, and the prevention of crime.\"]    That this remedy is effectual, experience has taught me and many  others; and experience is a guide on whom we may safely rely. It has  shown me that by taking children at an early age out of the reach of  contamination in the streets, and removing them in a great measure  from the no less baneful influence of evil example at home, we may lay  such a foundation of virtue, as is not likely to be shaken. Nor do I  think it difficult to show the reason of this. It is confessed on all  hands that our first impressions are the most powerful, both as to  their immediate effects and future influence; that they not only form  the character of our childhood, but that of our maturer years. As the  mind of a child expands, it searches for new objects of employment or  gratification; and this is the time when the young fall an easy prey  to those who make a business of entrapping them into the paths of  dishonesty, and then of urging them to crimes of deeper dye. What,  then, but a most salutary result can ensue from placing a child in a  situation, where its first impressions will be those of the beauty of  goodness,--where its first feelings of happiness will consist in the  receiving and cherishing kind ness towards its little neighbours? In  after years, and in schools for older children, it is reckoned an  unavoidable evil, that they should be congregated together in numbers;  not so in the infant school; it is there made use of as a means of  developing and exercising those kindly feelings, which must conduce  to the individual and general comfort, not only there, but in society  generally. It is not merely by instructing them in _maxims_ of honesty  that we seek to provide against the evil; but by the surer way of  exciting that feeling of love towards each other--towards every  one--which, when found in activity, must not only prevent dishonesty,  but every other species of selfishness.    Consider the difference of the cases. In the one case we behold  a child associated, in happy communion, with a society--a little  world--of its own age and feelings,--continually proving the  possibility of giving and imparting happiness by receiving  and exercising kindness to its companions--secured from every  danger--supplied with a constant variety of amusement, which is at  the same time instruction; and all this under the care of a master or  mistress; acting the part, not of a petulant school-dame, or a stern  pedagogue, but of a kind and judicious parent.    In the case of the child not thus befriended, we see it, either  exposed to the dangerous associations of the street, or to the  bad examples of its parents; to their unkindness and severity, or  misguided indulgence; and presented, moreover, with every facility, as  well as every temptation, to do wrong. Now, is it to be wondered at,  that, in the former case, kind, obedient, honest characters should  be the result; and in the latter, such as we have, in our preceding  examples, exhibited? Reason tells us such a consequence is likely, and  experience has shewn us that it really happens. I could enumerate a  thousand cases of honest principle in the infants who have been  under my own care; but I can only mention one or two circumstances  illustrative of the matter.    I once had, for example, two little boys to travel with me; their  assistance was extremely valuable in organizing schools. They were  often invited to accompany me at dinner; the guests generally gave  them "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11028"],[0,"Philippine Folk-Tales (#15)"],[1,"torment him, but he defended himself succesfully  against them, and by giving them part of his tuba bribed them to tell  him where to find his friends. To his friends he gave the remainder  of his tuba and then set out to find God himself.    Being ushered into the Divine Presence, he knelt humbly and said,  \"Lord, I beg thee to tell me how long I shall live.\" The Lord looked  at him and said, \"I have not sent for you; why are you here?\" Juan  bowed more humbly than before, and replied, \"O Most High, I have come  to see some of my dead friends, and I would like also to know how  long I shall live on earth.\" So God told him that he had still a long  earthly life before him and never to come again until he was sent for.    So Juan left the heavenly city and passed back through St. Peter's  gate, and at last, after a weary journey, came to earth again. And  Juan lived a long and happy life and drank more tuba than ever.      CHAPTER 10    The Juan who Visited Heaven.    There was once an old couple who always prayed for a child, for they  had always been childless. No matter how it looked, whether deformed  or ugly, they must have a child. So after a short time they saw that  their prayers would be answered, and in the course of nature a child  was born, but the mother died at the birth.    The new-born child ran to the church, climbed into the tower, and  began to hammer on the bells. The priest, hearing the noise, sent the  sacristan to see what was the matter. The sacristan went, and seeing  there a little child, asked what he was doing and told him to stop, for  the priest would be angry; but the ringing of the bells went on. Then  the priest went up. \"Little boy,\" he said, \"what is your name?\" \"Juan,\"  said the child. \"Why are you ringing the church bells?\" \"Because my  mother is dead.\" \"When did she die?\" \"Only now.\" \"If you stop ringing  the bells she shall have a fine funeral and you shall live with me  and be as my son,\" said the priest. \"Very well, sir, if you will let  me stay in the church all I wish.\" To this the priest assented. The  dead woman was buried with all the pomp of music, candles, and bells,  and the boy went to live in the convent. Always after his school was  done he would be in the church. The father did everything that was  possible for him, for he knew that he was not a natural child.    After a time the padre sent for him to get his dinner, but he would  not leave the church, so the priest had a good dinner cooked and  sent it down to the church, but he told the sacristan to watch the  church and see what happened. The sacristan watched and soon saw the  statue of Jesus eating with the boy. This he told the padre, and the  child's dinner was always sent to the church after that. One day not  long after he went to the priest and said, \"Master, my friend down at  the church wants me to go away with him.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"My  friend wants me to go to heaven with him.\"    The priest consented and the little boy and the Lord Jesus went  away together. As they walked the little boy saw that two roads ran  along together, one thorny and the other smooth. Asked the boy of  his companion, \"Friend, why is this road where we walk so thorny,  and that other yonder so smooth?\" Said the Lord, \"Hush, child, it  is not fitting to disturb the peace of this place, but I will tell  you. This is the path of the sinless and is thorny, but that smooth  way yonder is the way of the sinners and never reaches heaven.\"    Again they came to a great house filled with young men and women who  were all working hammering iron. Said the little boy, \"Who are those  who labor with the hammer?\" \"Hush, child, they are the souls of those  who died unmarried.\"    They journeyed on, and on one side were bush pastures filled with poor  cattle while on the opposite side of the road were pastures dry and  bare where the cattle were very fat. The child inquired the meaning  of the mystery. The Lord answered him, \"Hush, child! These lean cattle  in the rich pastures are the souls of sinners, while those fat cattle  on dry and sunburnt ground are the souls of sinless ones.\"    After a while they crossed a river, one part of which was ruby red and  the other spotless white. \"Friend, what is this?\" asked the boy. \"Hush,  child, the red is the blood of your mother whose life was given for  yours, and the white is the milk which she desired to give to you,  her child,\" said the Lord.    At last they came to a great house having seven stories, and there on  a table they saw many candles, some long, some short, some burned  out. Said Juan, \"Friend, what are all these candles?\" \"Hush,  child, those are the lives of your friends.\" \"What are those  empty candlesticks?\" \"Those are your mother and your uncle, who are  dead.\" \"Who is this long one?\" \"That is your father, who has long to  live.\" \"Who is this very short one?\" \"That is your master, who will  die soon.\" \"May I put in another?\" \"Yes, child, if you wish.\" So he  changed it for a long one, and with his heavenly companion he returned  to earth.    There he told his master, the padre, all that he had seen and heard and  how he had changed the candles; and he and his master lived together  a very long time. And in the fulness of time the padre died, but Juan  went to heaven one day with his Lord and never returned.      CHAPTER 11    The Sad Story of Juan and Maria.    Juan and Maria were orphans. When Juan was about eight years old and  Maria was about four their father died. The mother went into the hemp  fields to earn a living for her family by stripping the fibre from  the hemp, which is very hard work, so hard that she died worn out in  a month or two afterward.    Juan and Maria were then taken into the family of an uncle, their  mother's brother, and little Juan began to work for his little  sister's and his own living, by transplanting the tender shoots of  the banana. Maria often accompanied him, as the children were much  attached to each other. One day when they were out in the field Maria  saw a beautiful bird which seemed very tame and tried to catch it,  but the bird ran into the woods, and although she could come very  close to it she could not catch it. On and on she went until she  was almost ready to drop, her tiny feet leaving no trace, but still  she followed the bird. Just at night she saw an old man with a very  kind face, who came toward her, and putting the bird under one arm  and taking Maria on his shoulder, he set off toward his house, which  did not seem to be very far off. Arriving there he said to his wife,  \"See, wife, what good fortune I have had today.\" Seeing the child,  his wife threw up her hands in thanksgiving and cried, \"Thanks be to  God, we have a child at last in our old age.\"    Poor Juan, torn with fear, hunted the woods for days, but could not  find his little sister. Convinced at last that his search was hopeless,  he went home and worked hard and in a few years became a rich man. Then  he began to consider where he could find a suitable wife. It was told  him that there was an old couple beyond three ranges of mountains  who had a beautiful daughter, and to her he determined to go.    Maria had likewise grown up, and now she was the most beautiful  damsel in many days' journey. When Juan set out on his search, it  was to the house of Maria's foster parents that he was bound.    Arriving there, he called to those within, \"Honorable people,\" and the  old man said, \"Come in;\" but Juan remained without until the third  invitation. Passing within, he likewise would not sit down till he  had been asked three times.    Seating himself on a bench, he told the old man that he had come to  marry his daughter, and the old man told him he might if he could show  that he had enough money. As Juan was rich, this did not take long  to do, and after a few days Juan and Maria were married, not knowing  their relationship. They lived happily together, and a daughter was  born to them. This child, like her mother, was very beautiful.    One day, as the little girl was playing by the river, a crab came to  the edge of the water and said,--      \"Beautiful art thou,  More beautiful than any other,  But thou art the child  Of sister and brother.\"      Horrified, the child ran to her mother, and then the parents began  to talk over the events of their childhood and found that they were  indeed sister and brother.    They went to Maria's foster father to ask what they must do, and he  told them they must live apart; and then they went to the archbishop,  who told them that they might live lawfully together, as the sacrament  of marriage was above all, but, after much thought, they decided that  they must live apart, and Maria went back to her foster father.    Thus by a sinless crime were their lives saddened forever.      CHAPTER 12    The Fifty-one Thieves.    There were once two brothers, Juan and Pedro. Pedro was rich and was  the elder, but Juan was very poor and gained his living by cutting  wood. Juan became so poor at last that he was forced to ask alms  from his brother, or what was only the same thing, a loan. After  much pleading, Pedro gave his brother enough rice for a single meal,  but repenting of such generosity, went and took it off the fire,  as his brother's wife was cooking it, and carried it home again.    Juan then set out for the woods, thinking he might be able to find  a few sticks that he could exchange for something to eat, and went  much farther than he was accustomed to go. He came to a road he did  not know and followed it for some distance to where it led to a great  rocky bluff and there came to an end.    Juan did not know exactly what to think of such an abrupt ending  to the roadway, and sat down behind a large rock to meditate. As he  sat there a voice within the cliff said, \"Open the door,\" and a door  in the cliff opened itself. A man richly dressed came out, followed  by several others, whom he told that"]]]
