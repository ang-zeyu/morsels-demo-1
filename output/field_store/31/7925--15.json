[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],[0,"Etiquette (#15)"],[1,"every older lady who has been courteous enough  to invite them to her house. That is not \"toadying,\" it is being merely  polite. To go up and gush is a very different matter, and to go up and  gush over a prominent hostess who has never invited them to her house, is  toadying and of a very cheap variety.    A really well-bred person is as charming as possible to all, but effusive  to none, and shows no difference in manner either, to the high or to the  lowly when they are of equally formal acquaintance.      =THE BRIDE WHO IS A STRANGER=    The bride who is a stranger, but whose husband is well known in the town  to which he brings her, is in much the same position as the bride noted  above, in that her husband's friends call on her; she returns their  visits, and many of them invite her to their house. But it then devolves  upon her to make herself liked, otherwise she will find herself in a  community of many acquaintances but no friends. The best ingredients for  likeableness are a happy expression of countenance, an unaffected manner,  and a sympathetic attitude. If she is so fortunate as to possess these  attributes her path will have roses enough. But a young woman with an  affected pose and bad or conceited manners, will find plenty of thorns.  Equally unsuccessful is she with a chip-on-her-shoulder who, coming from  New York for instance, to live in Brightmeadows, insists upon dragging New  York sky-scrapers into every comparison with Brightmeadows' new  six-storied building. She might better pack her trunks and go back where  she came from. Nor should the bride from Brightmeadows who has married a  New Yorker, flaunt Brightmeadows standards or customs, and tell Mrs.  Worldly that she does not approve of a lady's smoking! Maybe she doesn't  and she may be quite right, and she should not under the circumstances  smoke herself; but she should not make a display of intolerance, or she,  too, had better take the first train back home, since she is likely to  find New York very, very lonely.      =HOW TOTAL STRANGERS ACQUIRE SOCIAL STANDING=    When new people move into a community, bringing letters of introduction to  prominent citizens, they arrive with an already made position, which ranks  in direct proportion to the standing of those who wrote the introductions.  Since, however, no one but \"persons of position\" are eligible to letters  of importance, there would be no question of acquiring position--which  they have--but merely of adding to their acquaintance.    As said in another chapter, people of position are people of position the  world over, and all the cities strung around the whole globe are like so  many chapter-houses of a brotherhood, to which letters of introduction  open the doors.    However, this is off the subject, which is to advise those who have no  position, or letters, how to acquire the former. It is a long and slow  road to travel, particularly long and slow for a man and his wife in a big  city. In New York people could live in the same house for generations, and  do, and not have their next door neighbor know them even by sight. But no  other city, except London, is as unaware as that. When people move to a  new city, or town, it is usually because of business. The husband at least  makes business acquaintances, but the wife is left alone. The only thing  for her to do is to join the church of her denomination, and become  interested in some activity; not only as an opening wedge to  acquaintanceships and possibly intimate friendships, but as an occupation  and a respite from loneliness. Her social position is gained usually at a  snail's pace--nor should she do anything to hurry it. If she is a real  person, if she has qualities of mind and heart, if she has charming  manners, sooner or later a certain position will come, and in proportion  to her eligibility.    One of the ladies with whom she works in church, having gradually learned  to like her, asks her to her house. Nothing may ever come of this, but  another one also inviting her, may bring an introduction to a third, who  takes a fancy to her. This third lady also invites her where she meets an  acquaintance she has already made on one of the two former occasions, and  this acquaintance in turn invites her. By the time she has met the same  people several times, they gradually, one by one, offer to go and see her,  or ask her to come and see them. One inviolable rule she must not forget:  it is fatal to be pushing or presuming. She must remain dignified always,  natural and sympathetic when anyone approaches her, but she should not  herself approach any one more than half way. A smile, the more friendly  the better, is never out of place, but after smiling, she should pass on!  Never grin weakly, and--cling!    If she is asked to go to see a lady, it is quite right to go. But not  again, until the lady has returned the visit, or asked her to her house.  And if admitted when making a first visit, she should remember not to  stay more than twenty minutes at most, since it is always wiser to make  others sorry to have her leave than run the risk of having the hostess  wonder why her visitor doesn't know enough to go!      =THE ENTRANCE OF AN OUTSIDER=    The outsider enters society by the same path, but it is steeper and longer  because there is an outer gate of reputation called \"They are not people  of any position\" which is difficult to unlatch. Nor is it ever unlatched  to those who sit at the gate rattling at the bars, or plaintively peering  in. The better, and the only way if she has not the key of birth, is  through study to make herself eligible. Meanwhile, charitable, or civic  work, will give her interest and occupation as well as throw her with  ladies of good breeding, by association with whom she can not fail to  acquire some of those qualities of manner before which the gates of  society always open.      =WHEN POSITION HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED=    When her husband belongs to a club, or perhaps she does too, and the  neighbors are friendly and those of social importance have called on her  and asked her to their houses, a newcomer does not have to stand so  exactly on the chalk line of ceremony as in returning her first visits and  sending out her first invitations.    After people have dined with each other several times, it is not at all  important to consider whether an invitation is owed or paid several times  over. She who is hospitably inclined can ask people half a dozen times to  their once if she wants to, and they show their friendliness by coming.  Nor need visits be paid in alternate order. Once she is really accepted by  people she can be as friendly as she chooses.    When Mrs. Oldname calls on Mrs. Stranger the first time, the latter may do  nothing but call in return; it would be the height of presumption to  invite one of conspicuous prominence until she has first been invited by  her. Nor may the Strangers ask the Oldnames to dine after being merely  invited to a tea. But when Mrs. Oldname asks Mrs. Stranger to lunch, the  latter might then invite the former to dinner, after which, if they  accept, the Strangers can continue to invite them on occasion, whether  they are invited in turn or not; especially if the Strangers are  continually entertaining, and the Oldnames are not. But on no account must  the Strangers' parties be arranged solely for the benefit of any  particular fashionables.    The Strangers can also invite to a party any children whom their own  children know at school, and Mrs. Stranger can quite properly go to fetch  her own children from a party to which their schoolmates invited them.      =MONEY NOT ESSENTIAL TO SOCIAL POSITION=    Bachelors, unless they are very well off, are not expected to give  parties; nor for that matter are very young couples. All hostesses go on  asking single men and young people to their houses without it ever  occurring to them that any return other than politeness should be made.    There are many couples, not necessarily in the youngest set either, who  are tremendously popular in society in spite of the fact that they give no  parties at all. The Lovejoys, for instance, who are clamored for  everywhere, have every attribute--except money. With fewer clothes perhaps  than any fashionable young woman in New York, she can't compete with Mrs.  Bobo Gilding or Constance Style for \"smartness\" but, as Mrs. Worldly  remarked: \"What would be the use of Celia Lovejoy's beauty if it depended  upon continual variation in clothes?\"    The only \"entertaining\" the Lovejoys ever do is limited to afternoon tea  and occasional welsh-rarebit suppers. But they return every bit of  hospitality shown them by helping to make a party \"go\" wherever they are.  Both are amusing, both are interesting, both do everything well. They  can't afford to play cards for money, but they both play a very good game  and the table is delighted to \"carry them,\" or they play at the same table  against each other.    This, by the way, is another illustration of the conduct of a gentleman;  if young Lovejoy played for money he would win undoubtedly in the long run  because he plays unusually well, but to use card-playing as a \"means of  making money\" would be contrary to the ethics of a gentleman, just as  playing for more than can be afforded turns a game into \"gambling.\"      =AN ELUSIVE POINT ESSENTIAL TO SOCIAL SUCCESS=    The sense of whom to invite with whom is one of the most important, and  elusive, points in social knowledge. The possession or lack of it is  responsible more than anything else for the social success of one woman,  and the failure of another. And as it is almost impossible, without  advice, for any stranger anywhere to know which people like or dislike  each other, the would-be hostess must either by means of natural talent or  more likely by trained attention, read the signs of liking or prejudice  much as a woodsman reads a message in every broken twig"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14317"],[0,"The Sorcery Club (#15)"],[1,"fair play, off I set to Peters &  Pervis'.    \"'I want to see your boss,' I said to the first clerk I saw.    \"'Which of them?' the clerk grunted, his cheeks turning white at the  sight of the policeman.    \"'Either will do,' I replied, 'Peters or Pervis. Trot 'em up, time is  precious.'    \"Away he went, but in a couple of minutes was back again, looking  scared, 'They're both engaged,' he says.    \"'Then they'll have to break it off,' I responded, 'and mighty quick.  I'm here to talk with them, so get a move on you again and give that  message.'    \"If it hadn't been for the policeman I don't think he would have gone,  but the policeman backed me up, and the clerk hurried off again; and  in the end the bosses decided they had better see me. They looked  precious cross, I can assure you, but before I had done speaking they  looked crosser still.    \"'You say you've done that puzzle,'--they shouted--'the puzzle that  has stuck all the mathematical guns at Harvard and Yale--you--a  nonentity like you--begone, sir, don't waste our time with such humbug  as that.'    \"'All right,' I said, 'give me some paper and a pen, and I'll prove  it.'    \"'That's very reasonable,' the policeman chipped in, 'do the thing  fair and square--I'm here as a witness.'    \"Well, with much grunting and grumbling they handed me paper and ink,  and in a trice the puzzle was done; and it appeared so easy that the  policeman clapped his hands and broke out into a loud guffaw. My eyes!  you should have seen how the faces of Pervis and Peters fell, and have  heard what they said. But it was no use swearing and cursing, the  thing was done, and there was the policeman to prove it.    \"'We'll give you five hundred dollars,' they said, 'to clear out and  say no more about it.'    \"'Five hundred dollars when you've advertised three thousand,' I  cried. 'What do you take me for? I'll have that three thousand or I'll  show you both up.'    \"'A thousand, then?' they said.    \"'No!' I retorted; 'three! Three, and look sharp. And look here,' I  added, as my glance rested on some of the samples of their pastes they  had round them, 'I understand the secrets of all these so-called  patents of yours--there isn't one of them I couldn't imitate. Take  that \"Rabsidab,\" for instance. What is it? Why, a compound of  horseflesh, turnips and popcorn, flavoured with Lazenby's sauce--for  the infringement of which patent you are liable to prosecution--and  coloured with cochineal. Then there's the stuff you label  \"Ironcastor,\"'--but they shut me up. 'There, take your three thousand  dollars, write us out a receipt for it, and clear.'\"    \"Nine thousand dollars in one day! We've done well,\" Kelson  ejaculated. \"What's the programme for to-morrow?\"    \"Same as to-day and plenty of it,\" Curtis said, pouring himself out  another glass of champagne and making a vigorous attack on a chicken.  \"I think I'll let you two fellows do all the work to-morrow, and  content myself here. Waiter! What time's breakfast?\"          CHAPTER VII    SAN FRANCISCO LADIES AND DIVINATION      Curtis was as good as his word. The following day he remained indoors  eating, and planning what he should eat, whilst Hamar and Kelson went  out with the express purpose of adding to their banking accounts.    In a garden in Bryant Street, Hamar saw a man resting on his spade and  mopping the perspiration from his forehead. As he stopped mechanically  to see what was being done, a cold sensation ran up his right leg into  his right hand, the first and third fingers of which were drawn  violently down. With a cry of horror he shrank back. Directly beneath  where he had been standing, he saw, under a fifteen or sixteen feet  layer of gravel soil--water; a huge caldron of water, black and  silent; water, that gave him the impression of tremendous depth and  coldness.    \"Hulloa! matey, what's the matter?\" the man with the spade called out.  \"Are you looking for your skin, for I never saw any one so completely  jump out of it?\"    \"So would you,\" Hamar said with a shudder, \"if you saw what I do!\"    \"What's that, then?\" the man said leering on the ground. \"Snakes!  That's what I always see when I've got them.\"    \"So long as you don't see yourself, there's some chance for you!\"  Hamar retorted. \"What makes you so hot?\"    \"Why, digging!\" the man laughed; \"any one would get hot digging at  such hard ground as this. As for a little whippersnapper like you,  you'd melt right away and only your nose would remain. Nothing would  ever melt that--there's too much of it.\"    Hamar scowled. \"You needn't be insulting,\" he said, \"I asked you a  civil question, and I repeat it. What makes you so hot--when you  should be cold--or at least cool?\"    \"Oh, should I!\" the man mimicked, \"I thought first you was merely  drunk; I can see quite clearly now that you're mad.\"    \"And yet you have such defective sight.\"    \"What makes you say that?\" the man said testily.    \"Why,\" Hamar responded, \"because you can't see what lies beneath your  very nose. Shall I tell you what it is?\"    \"Yes, tell away,\" the man replied, \"tell me my old mother's got twins,  and that Boss Croker is coming to lodge with us. I'd know you for a  liar anywhere by those teeth of yours.\"    \"Look here,\" said Hamar drawing himself up angrily, \"I have had enough  of your abuse. If I have any more I'll tell your employers. It is  evident you take me for a bummer, but see,\"--and plunging his hand in  his pocket he pulled it out full of gold. \"Kindly understand I'm  somebody,\" he went on, \"and that I'm staying at one of the biggest  hotels in the town.\"    \"I'm damned if I know what to make of you,\" the man muttered, \"unless  you're a hoptical delusion!\"    \"Underneath where I was standing--just here,\"--and Hamar indicated the  spot--\"is water. Any amount of it, you have only to sink a shaft  fifteen feet and you would come to it.\"    \"Water!\" the man laughed, \"yes, there is any amount of it--on your  brain, that's the only water near here.\"    \"Then you don't believe me?\" Hamar demanded.    \"Not likely!\" the man responded, \"I only believe what I see! And when  I see a face like yours holding out a potful of dollars, I know as how  you've stolen them. Git!\"--and Hamar flew.    But Hamar was not so easily nonplussed; not at least when he saw a  chance of making money. Entering the garden, and keeping well out of  sight of the gardener, he arrived at the front door by a side path, and  with much formality requested to see the owner of the establishment.  The latter happening to be crossing the hall at the time, heard Hamar  and asked what he wanted.    Hamar at once informed him he was a dowser, and that, chancing to pass  by the garden on his way to his hotel, he had divined the presence of  water.    \"I only wish there were,\" the gentleman exclaimed, \"but I fear you are  mistaken. I have attempted several times to sink a well but never with  the slightest degree of success. I have had all the ground carefully  prospected by Figgins of Sacramento Street--he has a very big  reputation--and he assures me there isn't a drop of water anywhere  near here within two hundred feet of the surface.\"    \"I know better,\" Hamar said. \"Will you get your gardener--who by the  way was very rude to me just now when I spoke to him--to dig where I  tell him. I have absolute confidence in my power of divination.\"    The owner of the property, whom I will call Mr. B. assented, and  several gardeners, including the one who had so insulted Hamar, were  soon digging vigorously. At the depth of fifteen feet, water was  found, and, indeed, so fast did it begin to come in that within a few  minutes it had risen a foot. The onlookers were jubilant.    \"I shall send an account of it to the local papers,\" Mr. B. remarked.  \"Your fame will be spread everywhere. You have increased the value of  my property a thousandfold, I cannot tell you how grateful I am\"--and  he, then and there, invited Hamar to luncheon.    After luncheon Mr. B. made him a present of a cheque--rather in excess  of the sum which Hamar had all along intended to have, and could not  have refrained from demanding much longer.    In the afternoon all the San Francisco specials were full of the  incident, and Hamar, seeing his name placarded for the first time, was  so overcome that he spent the rest of the evening in the hotel  deliberating how he could best turn his sudden notoriety to account.    At ten o'clock Kelson came in, looking somewhat fatigued, but,  nevertheless, pleased. He, too, had had adventures, and he detailed  them with so much elaboration that the other two had frequently to  tell him to \"dry up.\"    \"I began the morning,\" he commenced, \"by accosting a very fashionably  dressed lady coming out of Bushwell's Store in Commercial Street.  Divination at once told me she was the popular widow of J.K. Bater,  the Biscuit King of Nob Hill, and that she was carrying in her big  seal-skin muff a gold hatpin mounted with an emerald butterfly, a  silver-backed hair brush, a blue enamelled scent bottle, and a  porcelain jar, all of which she had slyly 'nicked,' when no one was  looking.    \"I stepped up to her, and politely raising my hat said, 'Good morning,  Mrs. Bater. I've a message for you.'    \"'I don't know you,' she said eyeing me very doubtfully, 'who are  you?'    \"'Forgotten!' I said tragically, 'and I had flattered myself it would  be otherwise. Still I must try and survive. I wanted to ask you a  favour, Mrs. Bater.'    \"'A favour!' she exclaimed nervously, 'what is it? You are really a  very extraordinary individual.'    \"'I was only going to ask if I might examine the contents of your  muff? I think you have certain articles in it that have not been paid  for--and I believe I am right in saying this is by no means the first  time such a thing has happened.'    \"She turned so pale I thought she was going to faint. 'Why, whatever  do you mean,' she stammered, 'I've nothing that does not"]]]
