A Bible text,  seemingly incongruous, came into Mr. Leonard's mind--\"This is the house  of God; this is the gate of heaven.\"    Felix lowered the violin and dropped wearily on a chair by the bed. The  inspired light faded from his face; once more he was only a tired boy.  But Stephen Leonard was on his knees, sobbing like a child; and Naomi  Clark was lying still, with her hands clasped over her breast.    \"I understand now,\" she said very softly. \"I couldn't see it before--and  now it's so plain. I just FEEL it. God IS a God of love. He can forgive  anybody--even me--even me. He knows all about it. I ain't skeered any  more. He just loves me and forgives me as I'd have loved and forgiven  my baby if she'd lived, no matter how bad she was, or what she did. The  minister told me that but I couldn't believe it. I KNOW it now. And He  sent you here to-night, boy, to tell it to me in a way that I could feel  it.\"        Naomi Clark died just as the dawn came up over the sea. Mr. Leonard rose  from his watch at her bedside and went to the door. Before him spread  the harbour, gray and austere in the faint light, but afar out the sun  was rending asunder the milk-white mists in which the sea was scarfed,  and under it was a virgin glow of sparkling water.    The fir trees on the point moved softly and whispered together. The  whole world sang of spring and resurrection and life; and behind him  Naomi Clark's dead face took on the peace that passes understanding.    The old minister and his grandson walked home together in a silence that  neither wished to break. Janet Andrews gave them a good scolding and an  excellent breakfast. Then she ordered them both to bed; but Mr. Leonard,  smiling at her, said:    \"Presently, Janet, presently. But now, take this key, go up to the black  chest in the garret, and bring me what you will find there.\"    When Janet had gone, he turned to Felix.    \"Felix, would you like to study music as your life-work?\"    Felix looked up, with a transfiguring flush on his wan face.    \"Oh, grandfather! Oh, grandfather!\"    \"You may do so, my child. After this night I dare not hinder you. Go  with my blessing, and may God guide and keep you, and make you strong to  do His work and tell His message to humanity in your own appointed way.  It is not the way I desired for you--but I see that I was mistaken. Old  Abel spoke truly when he said there was a Christ in your violin as well  as a devil. I understand what he meant now.\"    He turned to meet Janet, who came into the study with a violin. Felix's  heart throbbed; he recognized it. Mr. Leonard took it from Janet and  held it out to the boy.    \"This is your father's violin, Felix. See to it that you never make  your music the servant of the power of evil--never debase it to unworthy  ends. For your responsibility is as your gift, and God will exact the  accounting of it from you. Speak to the world in your own tongue through  it, with truth and sincerity; and all I have hoped for you will be  abundantly fulfilled.\"            IV. Little Joscelyn      \"It simply isn't to be thought of, Aunty Nan,\" said Mrs. William  Morrison decisively. Mrs. William Morrison was one of those people who  always speak decisively. If they merely announce that they are going  to peel the potatoes for dinner their hearers realize that there is  no possible escape for the potatoes. Moreover, these people are always  given their full title by everybody. William Morrison was called Billy  oftener than not; but, if you had asked for Mrs. Billy Morrison, nobody  in Avonlea would have known what you meant at first guess.    \"You must see that for yourself, Aunty,\" went on Mrs. William, hulling  strawberries nimbly with her large, firm, white fingers as she talked.  Mrs. William always improved every shining moment. \"It is ten miles to  Kensington, and just think how late you would be getting back. You are  not able for such a drive. You wouldn't get over it for a month. You  know you are anything but strong this summer.\"    Aunty Nan sighed, and patted the tiny, furry, gray morsel of a kitten in  her lap with trembling fingers. She knew, better than anyone else could  know it, that she was not strong that summer. In her secret soul, Aunty  Nan, sweet and frail and timid under the burden of her seventy years,  felt with mysterious unmistakable prescience that it was to be her last  summer at the Gull Point Farm. But that was only the more reason why  she should go to hear little Joscelyn sing; she would never have another  chance. And oh, to hear little Joscelyn sing just once--Joscelyn, whose  voice was delighting thousands out in the big world, just as in the  years gone by it had delighted Aunty Nan and the dwellers at the Gull  Point Farm for a whole golden summer with carols at dawn and dusk about  the old place!    \"Oh, I know I'm not very strong, Maria.\" said Aunty Nan pleadingly, \"but  I am strong enough for that. Indeed I am. I could stay at Kensington  over night with George's folks, you know, and so it wouldn't tire  me much. I do so want to hear Joscelyn sing. Oh, how I love little  Joscelyn.\"    \"It passes my understanding, the way you hanker after that child,\" cried  Mrs. William impatiently. \"Why, she was a perfect stranger to you when  she came here, and she was here only one summer!\"    \"But oh, such a summer!\" said Aunty Nan softly. \"We all loved little  Joscelyn. She just seemed like one of our own. She was one of God's  children, carrying love with them everywhere. In some ways that little  Anne Shirley the Cuthberts have got up there at Green Gables reminds  me of her, though in other ways they're not a bit alike. Joscelyn was a  beauty.\"    \"Well, that Shirley snippet certainly isn't that,\" said Mrs. William  sarcastically. \"And if Joscelyn's tongue was one third as long as Anne  Shirley's the wonder to me is that she didn't talk you all to death out  of hand.\"    \"Little Joscelyn wasn't much of a talker,\" said Aunty Nan dreamily. \"She  was kind of a quiet child. But you remember what she did say. And I've  never forgotten little Joscelyn.\"    Mrs. William shrugged her plump, shapely shoulders.    \"Well, it was fifteen years ago, Aunty Nan, and Joscelyn can't be very  'little' now. She is a famous woman, and she has forgotten all about  you, you can be sure of that.\"    \"Joscelyn wasn't the kind that forgets,\" said Aunty Nan loyally. \"And,  anyway, the point is, _I_ haven't forgotten HER. Oh, Maria, I've longed  for years and years just to hear her sing once more. It seems as if I  MUST hear my little Joscelyn sing once again before I die. I've never  had the chance before and I never will have it again. Do please ask  William to take me to Kensington.\"    \"Dear me, Aunty Nan, this is really childish,\" said Mrs. William,  whisking her bowlful of berries into the pantry. \"You must let other  folks be the judge of what is best for you now. You aren't strong enough  to drive to Kensington, and, even if you were, you know well enough that  William couldn't go to Kensington to-morrow night. He has got to attend  that political meeting at Newbridge. They can't do without him.\"    \"Jordan could take me to Kensington,\" pleaded Aunty Nan, with very  unusual persistence.    \"Nonsense! You couldn't go to Kensington with the hired man. Now, Aunty  Nan, do be reasonable. Aren't William and I kind to you? Don't we do  everything for your comfort?\"    \"Yes, oh, yes,\" admitted Aunty Nan deprecatingly.    \"Well, then, you ought to be guided by our opinion. And you must just  give up thinking about the Kensington concert, Aunty, and not worry  yourself and me about it any more. I am going down to the shore field  now to call William to tea. Just keep an eye on the baby in chance he  wakes up, and see that the teapot doesn't boil over.\"    Mrs. William whisked out of the kitchen, pretending not to see the tears  that were falling over Aunty Nan's withered pink cheeks. Aunty Nan was  really getting very childish, Mrs. William reflected, as she marched  down to the shore field. Why, she cried now about every little  thing! And such a notion--to want to go to the Old Timers' concert at  Kensington and be so set on it! Really, it was hard to put up with her  whims. Mrs. William sighed virtuously.    As for Aunty Nan, she sat alone in the kitchen, and cried bitterly, as  only lonely old age can cry. It seemed to her that she could not bear  it, that she MUST go to Kensington. But she knew that it was not to be,  since Mrs. William had decided otherwise. Mrs. William's word was law at  Gull Point Farm.    \"What's the matter with my old Aunty Nan?\" cried a hearty young voice  from the doorway. Jordan Sloane stood there, his round, freckled face  looking as anxious and sympathetic as it was possible for such a very  round, very freckled face to look. Jordan was the Morrisons' hired boy  that summer, and he worshipped Aunty Nan.    \"Oh, Jordan,\" sobbed Aunty Nan, who was not above telling her troubles  to the hired help, although Mrs. William thought she ought to be, \"I  can't go to Kensington to-morrow night to hear little Joscelyn sing at  the Old Timers' concert. Maria says I can't.\"    \"That's too bad,\" said Jordan. \"Old cat,\" he muttered after the  retreating and serenely unconscious Mrs. William. Then he shambled in  and sat down on the sofa beside Aunty Nan.    \"There, there, don't cry,\" he said, patting her thin little shoulder  with his big, sunburned paw. \"You'll make yourself sick if you go on  crying, and we can't get along without you at Gull Point Farm.\"    Aunty Nan smiled wanly.    \"I'm afraid you'll soon have to get on without me, Jordan. I'm not going  to be here very long now. No, I'm not, Jordan, I know it. Something  tells me so very plainly. But I would be willing to go--glad to go, for  I'm very tired, Jordan--if I could only have heard little Joscelyn sing  once more.\"    \"Why are you so set on hearing her?\" asked Jordan. \"She ain't no kin to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13545"],[0,"Mary at the Farm and Book of Recipes Compiled during Her Visit (#15)"],[1,"vegetables. Those  daisies, made of cucumber seeds with grains of red corn for centres,  and those made of tiny grains of popcorn with a watermelon seed in  centre, are cute. The latter look like breastpins with a circle of  pearls around the edge. And this glass case on the table, containing a  white cross, covered with wax tube roses, ivy leaves and fuchsias  drooping from the arms of the cross, sparkling with diamond dust! The  band of green chenille around its base matches the mat underneath,  composed of green zephyr of different shades, knitted, then raveled to  imitate moss, I suppose; and, no doubt, this marble-topped table has  stood here for fifty years, in this same spot, for the express purpose  of holding this beautiful (?) work of art.\"    \"The hair flowers and the seed wreath were made by John's sister,\"  replied Aunt Sarah.    \"Aunt Sarah,\" exclaimed Mary, \"I've an original idea. This oval,  marble-topped table has such strong, solid legs of black walnut,  suppose we remove the marble slab and have a large, circular top made  of wood at the planing mill? Wait; I'll get my tape measure. About  thirty-two inches in diameter will do. The new top we shall stain to  match the walnut frame, and it could be easily fastened to the table  with a couple of screws; and, after the marble top has been well  scoured, we'll use it in the kitchen as a bake board on which to roll  out pie crust.\"    Her Aunt as usual acquiesced to all Mary's suggestions.    \"You're a dear, Aunt Sarah!\" exclaimed Mary, as she gave her a hug,  \"and I'll embroider big, yellow daisies with brown centres of French  knots on gray linen for a new table cover. Won't they look just  sweet?\"    \"Yes, Mary, and I'll buy a large, new lamp with a pretty shade, as I  feel sure your Uncle will like to sit here evenings to read his papers  and farm journals.\"    \"And don't forget the Shriners' little magazine, _The Crescent_, which  amuses him so greatly. Aunt Sarah, I do wish those stiff,  starchy-looking, blue-white Nottingham lace curtains at the windows  had grown yellow with age. They would be ever so much prettier and  softer looking, and they are such a pretty, neat design, too.\"    \"Oh!\" replied her Aunt, \"that may be easily remedied. I'll just dip  them into a little weak liquid coffee and that will give them a creamy  tint, and take out the stiffness.\"    \"Now,\" said Mary, \"what shall we do with these stiff, ugly,  haircloth-covered chairs and sofa?\"    \"Why,\" replied Aunt Sarah, \"we shall buy cretonne or art cloth, in  pretty shades of brown and tan or green, to harmonize with the wall  paper, and make slip covers for them all. We could never think of  dispensing with the sofa. It is a very important article of furniture  in German households. The hostess usually gives the person of greatest  distinction among her guests the place of honor beside her on the  sofa.\"    \"These chairs have such strong, well-made, mahogany frames it would be  a pity not to use them. Now,\" continued Mary, \"about the pictures on  the wall. Can't we consign them all to the attic? We might use some  of the frames. I'll contribute unframed copies of 'The Angelus' and  'The Gleaners,' by Millet; and I think they would fit into these plain  mahogany frames which contain the very old-fashioned set of pictures  named respectively 'The Lovers,' 'The Declaration,' 'The Lovers'  Quarrel' and 'The Marriage.' They constitute a regular art gallery.  I'll use a couple of the frames for some small Colonial and apple  blossom pictures I have, that I just love, by Wallace Nutting. Mine  are all unframed; 'Maiden Reveries,' 'A Canopied Roof' and a 'Ton of  Bloom,' I think are sweet. Those branches of apple trees, covered with  a mass of natural-looking pink blossoms, are exquisite.\"    \"Yes,\" remarked Aunt Sarah, \"they look exactly like our old Baldwin,  Winesap and Cider apple trees in the old, south meadow in the Spring.  And, Mary, we'll discard those two chromos, popular a half century  ago, of two beautiful cherubs called respectively, 'Wide Awake' and  'Fast Asleep,' given as premiums to a popular magazine. I don't  remember if the magazine was 'Godey's,' 'Peterson's' or 'Home Queen';  they have good, plain, mahogany frames which we can use.\"    \"And, Aunt Sarah,\" said Mary, \"we can cut out the partition in this  large, black-walnut frame, containing lithograph pictures of General  George Washington, 'the Father of his Country' (we are informed in  small letters at the bottom of the picture), and of General Andrew  Jackson, 'the hero of New Orleans.' Both men are pictured on  horseback, on gayly-caparisoned, prancing white steeds, with scarlet  saddle cloth, edged with gold bullion fringe. The Generals are  pictured clad in blue velvet coats with white facings of cloth or  satin vest and tight-fitting knee breeches, also white and long boots  reaching to the knee. Gold epaulettes are on their shoulders, and both  are in the act of lifting their old-fashioned Continental hats, the  advancing army showing faintly in the background. How gorgeously they  are arrayed! We will use this frame for the excellent, large copy you  have of 'The Doctor' and the pictured faces of the German  composers--Beethoven, Wagner, Mendelssohn, Haydn, Schubert and Mozart,  which I have on a card with a shaded brown background, will exactly  fit into this plain frame of narrow molding, from which I have just  removed the old cardboard motto, 'No place like home,' done with  green-shaded zephyr in cross-stitch.\"    [Illustration:    A-29 An Old Sampler  A-30 Old Woven Basket  A-31 Wax Cross  A-32 Old Spinning Wheel]    \"Now, Mary, with the couple of comfortable rockers which I intend  purchasing, I think we have about finished planning our room.\"    \"If you are willing, Aunt Sarah, I should like to make some pretty  green and brown cretonne slips to cover those square sofa pillows in  place of the ones made of small pieces of puffed silk and the one of  colored pieces of cashmere in log cabin design, I do admire big, fat,  plain, comfortable pillows, for use instead of show. And we must have  a waste paper basket near the table beside Uncle John's chair. I shall  contribute green satin ribbon for an immense bow on the side of the  basket. Oh! Aunt Sarah! You've forgotten all about this odd, woven  basket, beside the what-not, filled with sea shells. I don't care for  the shells, but the basket would make a lovely sewing basket.\"    \"You may have the basket, Mary, if you like it. It came from Panama,  or perhaps it was bought at Aspinwall by John's Uncle, many years ago,  when he came home on a visit from California, by way of the Isthmus,  to visit old friends and relatives. John's Mother always kept it  standing on the floor in one corner of the room beside the what-not.\"    \"Aunt Sarah, why was straw ever put under this carpet?\"    \"The straw was put there, my dear, to save the carpet, should the  boards on the floor be uneven. My Mother was always particular about  having _cut rye straw_, because it was softer and finer than any  other. It was always used in those days instead of the carpet linings  we now have. I remember sometimes, when the carpet had been newly  laid, in our home, immediately after house cleaning time, the surface  of the floor looked very odd; full of bumps and raised places in  spots, until frequent walking over it flattened down the straw. This  room happens to have a particularly good, even floor, as this part of  the house was built many years later than the original, old farm  house, else it would not do to have it painted.\"    \"Aunt Sarah, may I have the old spinning wheel in the attic? I'd love  to furnish an old Colonial bedroom when I have a home of my very own.  I'll use the rag carpet you made me for the floor, the old-fashioned,  high-post bed Uncle John said I might have, and the 'New Colonial'  rugs you taught me to make.    \"Yes, my dear, and there is another old grandfather's clock in the  attic which you may have; and a high-boy also, for which I have no  particular use.\"    \"Aunt Sarah, we shall not put away this really beautiful old sampler  worked in silk by Uncle John's grandmother when a girl of nine years.  It is beautifully done, and is wonderful, I think. And what is this  small frame containing a yellowed piece of paper cut in intricate  designs, presumably with scissors?\"    \"Look on the back of the picture and see what is written there, my  dear,\" said her Aunt.    Mary slowly read: \"'This is the only picture I owned before my  marriage. I earned the money to buy it by gathering wheat heads.'\"    \"It belonged to my grandmother,\" said Aunt Sarah. \"In old times, after  the reapers had left the field, the children were allowed to gather up  the wheat remaining, and, I suppose, grandmother bought this picture  with the money she earned herself, and considered it quite a work of  art in her day. It is over one hundred years old.\"          CHAPTER XVII.    AN OLD SONG EVENING.      Aunt Sarah and Mary spent few idle moments while carrying out their  plans for \"doing over\" the old parlor. Finally, 'twas finished. Mary  breathed a sigh of satisfaction as the last picture was hung on the  wall. She turned to her Aunt, saying, \"Don't you think the room looks  bright, cheery and livable?\"    \"Yes,\" replied her Aunt, \"and what is more essential, homey, I have  read somewhere, 'A woman's house should be as personal a matter as a  spider's web or a snail's shell; and all the thought, toil and love  she puts into it should be preserved a part of its comeliness and  homelikeness forever, and be her monument to the generations.'\"    \"Well, Aunt Sarah,\" replied Mary, \"I guess we've earned our monument.  The air that blows over the fields, wafted in from the open window, is  sweet with the scent of grain and clover, and certainly is refreshing.  I'm dreadfully tired, but so delighted with the result of our labors.  Now we will go and 'make ready,' as"]]]
