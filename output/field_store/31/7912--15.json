Without an axe, and without help, I was unable to measure the  girth of this column, which had not been without companions on a  smaller scale in the immediate neighbourhood. At the west end of the  cave, the wall was thickly covered for a large space with small  limestone stalactites, producing the effect of many tiers of fringe on  a shawl; while from a dark fissure in the roof a large piece of fluted  drapery of the same material hung, calling to mind some of the vastly  grander details of the grottoes of Hans-sur-Lesse in Belgium: down  this wall there was also a long row of icicles, on the edges of a  narrow fissure. The north-west corner was very dark, and an opening in  the wall of rock high above the ground suggested a tantalising cave up  there: the ground in this corner was occupied by the shattered remains  of numerous columns of ice, which had originally covered a circular  area between 60 and 70 feet in circumference.    [Illustration: VERTICAL SECTION OF THE GLACIERE OF GRACE-DIEU, NEAR  BESANCON.]    The three large masses of ice which rendered this glaciere in some  respects more remarkable than any of those I have seen, lay in a line  from east to west, across the middle of the cave, on that part of the  floor where the ice was thickest. The central mass was extremely  solid, but somewhat unmeaning in shape, being a rough irregular  pyramid; its size alone, however, was sufficient to make it very  striking, the girth being 66-1/2 feet at some distance from the  ice-floor with which it blended. The mass which lay to the east of  this was very lovely, owing to the good taste of some one who had  found that much ice was wont to accumulate on that spot, and had  accordingly fixed the trunk of a small fir-tree, with the upper  branches complete, to receive the water from the corresponding fissure  in the roof. The consequence was, that, while the actual tree had  vanished from sight under its icy covering, excepting on one side  where a slight investigation betrayed its presence, the mass of ice  showed every possible fantasy of form which a mould so graceful could  suggest. At the base, it was solid, with a circumference of 37 feet.  The huge column, which had collected round the trunk of the fir-tree,  branched out at the top into all varieties of eccentricity and beauty,  each twig of the different boughs becoming, to all appearance, a solid  bar of frosted ice, with graceful curve, affording a point of  suspension for complicated groups of icicles, which streamed down side  by side with emulous loveliness. In some of the recesses of the  column, the ice assumed a pale blue colour; but as a rule it was white  and very hard, not so regularly prismatic as the ice described in  former glacieres, but palpably crystalline, showing a structure not  unlike granite, with a bold grain, and with a large predominance of  the glittering element. But the westernmost mass was the grandest and  most beautiful of all. It consisted of two lofty heads, like weeping  willows in Carrara marble, with three or four others less lofty,  resembling a family group of lions' heads in a subdued attitude of  grief, richly decked with icy manes. Similar heads seemed to grow out  here and there from the solid sides of the huge mass. The girth was  76-1/2 feet, measured about 2 feet from the floor. When this column was  looked at from the side removed from the entrance to the cave, so  that it stood in the centre of the light which poured down the long  slope from the outer world, the transparency of the ice brought it to  pass that the whole seemed set in a narrow frame of impalpable liquid  blue, the effect of light penetrating through the mass at its extreme  edges. The only means of determining the height of this column was by  tying a stone to the end of a string, and lodging it on the highest  head; but this was not an easy process, as I was naturally anxious not  to injure the delicate beauty which made that head one of the  loveliest things conceivable; and each careful essay with the stone  seemed to involve as much responsibility as taking a shot at a hostile  wicket, in a crisis of the game, instead of returning the ball in the  conventional manner. When at last it was safely lodged, the height  proved to be 27 feet. I had hoped to find it much more than this, from  the grandeur of the effect of the whole mass, and I took the trouble  to measure the knotted string again with a tape, to make sure that  there was no mistake. The column formed upon the fir-tree was 3 or 4  feet lower.    I have since found many notices of this glaciere in the Memoirs of the  French Academy and elsewhere, extracts from which will be found in a  later chapter. These accounts are spread over a period of 200 years,  extending from 1590 to 1790, and almost all make mention of the columns  or groups of columns I have described; but, without exception, the  heights given or suggested in the various accounts are much less than  those which I obtained as the result of careful measurement. The latest  description of a visit to the glaciere states a fact which probably will  be held to explain, the present excess of height above that of earlier  times.[37] The citizen Girod-Chantrans, who wrote this description, had  procured the notes of a medical man living in the neighbourhood, from  which it seemed that Dr. Oudot made the experiment, in 1779, of fixing  stakes of wood in the heads of the columns, then from 4 to 5 feet high,  and found that these stakes were the cause of a very large increase in  the height of the columns, ice gathering round them in pillars a foot  thick. So that it is not improbable that the largest of the three masses  of the present day owes its height, and its peculiar form, to a series  of stakes fixed from time to time in the various heads formed under the  fissures in the roof, though nothing but the most solid ice can now be  seen. It would be very interesting to try this experiment in one of the  caves where, without any artificial help, such immense masses of ice are  formed; and by this means columns might, in the course of a year or two,  be raised to the very roof. Further details on this subject will be  given hereafter.    There was no perceptible draught of air in any part of the cave, and the  candles burned steadily through the whole time of my visit, which  occupied more than two hours. The centre was sufficiently lighted by the  day; but in the western corner, and behind the largest column,  artificial light was necessary. The ice itself did not generally show  signs of thawing, but the whole cave was in a state of wetness, which  made the process of measuring and investigating anything but pleasant.  I had placed two thermometers at different points on my first  entrance--one on a drawing-board on a large stone in the middle of the  pond of water which has been mentioned, and the other on a bundle of  pencils at the entrance of the end chapel, in a part of the cave where  the ice-floor ceased for a while, and left the stones and rock bare. The  former gave 33 deg., the latter, till I was on the point of leaving, 31  1/2 deg., when it fell suddenly to 31 deg.. It was impossible, however, to stay  any longer for the sake of watching the thermometer fall lower and lower  below the freezing point; indeed, the results of sundry incautious  fathomings of the various pools of water, and incessant contact of hands  and feet with the ice, had already become so unpleasant, that I was  obliged to desert my trusty hundred feet of string, and leave it lying  on the ice, from want of finger-power to roll it up. The thermometers  were both Casella's, but that which registered 31 deg. was the more lively  of the two, the other being mercurial, with a much thicker stem: the  difference in sensitiveness was so great, that when they were equally  exposed to the sun in driving home, the one ran up to 93 deg. before the  other had reached 85 deg..    In leaving the glaciere, I found a little pathway turning off along the  face of the rock on the left hand, a short way up the slope of entrance,  and looking as if it might lead to the opening in the dark wall on the  western side of the cave. After a time, however, it came to a corner  which it seemed an unnecessary risk to attempt to pass alone; and my  prudence was rewarded by the discovery that, after all, the supposed  cave could not be thus reached. It is said that this other cave was the  place to which the inhabitants fled for refuge when their district was  invaded, probably by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar with his 10,000 Swedes,  and that a ladder 40 feet long is necessary for getting at it.    The driver had long ago absconded when I returned to the upper regions;  but the wife of the farmer of the grotto was there, and communicated  all that she knew of the statistics of the ice annually removed. She  said that in 1863 two chars were loaded every day for two months, each  char taking about 600 kilos, the wholesale price in Besancon being 5  francs the hundred kilos. Since the quintal contains 50 kilos, it will  be seen that this account does not agree with the statement of Renaud as  to the amount of ice each char could take. No doubt, a char at S.  Georges may mean one thing, and a char in the village of Chaux another;  but the difference between 12 quintaux and 50 or 60 is too great to be  thus explained, and probably Madame Briot made some mistake. Her  husband, Louis Briot, works alone in the cave, and has twelve men and a  donkey to carry the ice he quarries to the village of Chaux, a mile from  the glaciere, where it is loaded for conveyance to Besancon. He uses  gunpowder for the flooring of ice, and expects the eighth part of a  pound to blow out a cubic metre; and if, by ill luck, the ice thus  procured has stones on the lower"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14020"],[0,"The Works of Horace (#15)"],[1,"en, must earn your liquor  by [bringing some] spikenard: a small box of spikenard shall draw out a  cask, which now lies in the Sulpician store-house, bounteous in the  indulgence of fresh hopes and efficacious in washing away the  bitterness of cares.

TO LYCE.      The gods have heard my prayers, O Lyce; Lyce, the gods have heard my  prayers, you are become an old woman, and yet you would fain seem a  beauty; and you wanton and drink in an audacious manner; and when drunk,  solicit tardy Cupid, with a quivering voice. He basks in the charming  cheeks of the blooming Chia, who is a proficient on the lyre. The  teasing urchin flies over blasted oaks, and starts back at the sight of  you, because foul teeth, because wrinkles and snowy hair render you  odious. Now neither Coan purples nor sparkling jewels restore those  years, which winged time has inserted in the public annals. Whither is  your beauty gone? Alas! or whither your bloom? Whither your graceful  deportment? What have you [remaining] of her, of her, who breathed  loves, and ravished me from myself? Happy next to Cynara, and  distinguished for an aspect of graceful ways: but the fates granted a  few years only to Cynara, intending to preserve for a long time Lyce, to  rival in years the aged raven: that the fervid young fellows might see,  not without excessive laughter, that torch, [which once so brightly  scorched,] reduced to ashes.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XIV.    TO AUGUSTUS.      What zeal of the senators, or what of the Roman people, by decreeing the  most ample honors, can eternize your virtues, O Augustus, by monumental  inscriptions and lasting records? O thou, wherever the sun illuminates  the habitable regions, greatest of princes, whom the Vindelici, that  never experienced the Roman sway, have lately learned how powerful thou  art in war! For Drusus, by means of your soldiery, has more than once  bravely overthrown the Genauni, an implacable race, and the rapid  Brenci, and the citadels situated on the tremendous Alps. The elder of  the Neros soon after fought a terrible battle, and, under your  propitious auspices, smote the ferocious Rhoeti: how worthy of  admiration in the field of battle, [to see] with what destruction he  oppressed the brave, hearts devoted to voluntary death: just as the  south wind harasses the untameable waves, when the dance of the Pleiades  cleaves the clouds; [so is he] strenuous to annoy the troops of the  enemy, and to drive his eager steed through the midst of flames. Thus  the bull-formed Aufidus, who washes the dominions of the Apulian Daunus,  rolls along, when he rages and meditates an horrible deluge to the  cultivated lands; when Claudius overthrew with impetuous might, the iron  ranks of the barbarians, and by mowing down both front and rear strewed  the ground, victorious without any loss; through you supplying them with  troops, you with councils, and your own guardian powers. For on that  day, when the suppliant Alexandria opened her ports, and deserted court,  fortune, propitious to you in the third lustrum, has put a happy period  to the war, and has ascribed praise and wished-for honor to the  victories already obtained. O thou dread guardian of Italy and imperial  Rome, thee the Spaniard, till now unconquered, and the Mede, and the  Indian, thee the vagrant Scythian admires; thee both the Nile, who  conceals his fountain heads, and the Danube; thee the rapid Tigris; thee  the monster-bearing ocean, that roars against the remote Britons; thee  the region of Gaul fearless of death, and that of hardy Iberia obeys;  thee the Sicambrians, who delight in slaughter, laying aside their arms,  revere.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XV.    TO AUGUSTUS, ON THE RESTORATION OF PEACE.      Phoebus chid me, when I was meditating to sing of battles And conquered  cities on the lyre: that I might not set my little sails along the  Tyrrhenian Sea. Your age, O Caesar, has both restored plenteous crops  to the fields, and has brought back to our Jupiter the standards torn  from the proud pillars of the Parthians; and has shut up [the temple] of  Janus [founded by] Romulus, now free from war; and has imposed a due  discipline upon headstrong licentiousness, and has extirpated crimes,  and recalled the ancient arts; by which the Latin name and strength of  Italy have increased, and the fame and majesty of the empire is extended  from the sun's western bed to the east. While Caesar is guardian of  affairs, neither civil rage nor violence shall disturb tranquillity; nor  hatred which forges swords, and sets at variance unhappy states. Not  those, who drink of the deep Danube, shall now break the Julian edicts:  not the Getae, not the Seres, nor the perfidious Persians, nor those  born upon the river Tanais. And let us, both on common and festal days,  amid the gifts of joyous Bacchus, together with our wives and families,  having first duly invoked the gods, celebrate, after the manner of our  ancestors, with songs accompanied with Lydian pipes, our late valiant  commanders: and Troy, and Anchises, and the offspring of benign Venus.           *       *       *       *       *          THE BOOK OF THE EPODES OF HORACE.        ODE I.    TO MAECENAS.      Thou wilt go, my friend Maecenas, with Liburian galleys among the  towering forts of ships, ready at thine own [hazard] to undergo any of  Caesar's dangers. What shall I do? To whom life may be agreeable, if you  survive; but, if otherwise, burdensome. Whether shall I, at your  command, pursue my ease, which can not be pleasing unless in your  company? Or shall I endure this toil with such a courage, as becomes  effeminate men to bear? I will bear it? and with an intrepid soul follow  you, either through the summits of the Alps, and the inhospitable  Caucus, or to the furthest western bay. You may ask how I, unwarlike and  infirm, can assist your labors by mine? While I am your companion, I  shall be in less anxiety, which takes possession of the absent in a  greater measure. As the bird, that has unfledged young, is in a greater  dread of serpents' approaches, when they are left;--not that, if she  should be present when they came, she could render more help. Not only  this, but every other war, shall be cheerfully embraced by me for the  hope of your favor; [and this,] not that my plows should labor, yoked to  a greater number of mine own oxen; or that my cattle before the  scorching dog-star should change the Calabrian for the Lucanian  pastures: neither that my white country-box should equal the Circaean  walls of lofty Tusculum. Your generosity has enriched me enough, and  more than enough: I shall never wish to amass, what either, like the  miser Chremes, I may bury in the earth, or luxuriously squander, like a  prodigal.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE II.    THE PRAISES OF A COUNTRY LIFE.      Happy the man, who, remote from business, after the manner of the  ancient race of mortals, cultivates his paternal lands with his own  oxen, disengaged from every kind of usury; he is neither alarmed by the  horrible trump, as a soldier, nor dreads he the angry sea; he shuns both  the bar and the proud portals of citizens in power. Wherefore he either  weds the lofty poplars to the mature branches of the vine; and, lopping  off the useless boughs with his pruning-knife, he ingrafts more fruitful  ones: or he takes a prospect of the herds of his lowing cattle,  wandering about in a lonely vale; or stores his honey, pressed [from the  combs], in clean vessels; or shears his tender sheep. Or, when autumn  has lifted up in the fields his head adorned with mellow fruits, how  does he rejoice, while he gathers the grafted pears, and the grape that  vies with the purple, with which he may recompense thee, O Priapus, and  thee, father Sylvanus, guardian of his boundaries! Sometimes he delights  to lie under an aged holm, sometimes on the matted grass: meanwhile the  waters glide along in their deep channels; the birds warble in the  woods; and the fountains murmur with their purling streams, which  invites gentle slumbers. But when the wintery season of the tempestuous  air prepares rains and snows, he either drives the fierce boars, with  many a dog, into the intercepting toils; or spreads his thin nets with  the smooth pole, as a snare for the voracious thrushes; or catches in  his gin the timorous hare, or that stranger the crane, pleasing rewards  [for his labor]. Among such joys as these, who does not forget those  mischievous anxieties, which are the property of love. But if a chaste  wife, assisting on her part [in the management] of the house, and  beloved children (such as is the Sabine, or the sun-burned spouse of the  industrious Apulian), piles up the sacred hearth with old wood, just at  the approach of her weary husband; and, shutting up the fruitful cattle  in the woven hurdles, milks dry their distended udders: and, drawing  this year's wine out of a well-seasoned cask, prepares the unbought  collation: not the Lucrine oysters could delight me more, nor the  turbot, nor the scar, should the tempestuous winter drive any from the  eastern floods to this sea: not the turkey, nor the Asiatic wild-fowl,  can come into my stomach more agreeably, than the olive gathered from  the richest branches from the trees, or the sorrel that loves the  meadows, or mallows salubrious for a sickly body, or a lamb slain at the  feast of Terminus, or a kid"]]]
