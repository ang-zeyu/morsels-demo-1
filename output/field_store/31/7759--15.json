From thence we passed into a smooth and calm sea, wherein was a  small island with a good landing place, and which was inhabited by  the Bucephali:  a savage race of men, with bulls' heads and horns,  as they paint the minotaur.  As soon as we got on shore we went in  search of water and provision, for we had none left; water we found  soon, but nothing else; we heard, indeed, a kind of lowing at a  distance, and expected to find a herd of oxen, but, advancing a  little farther, perceived that it came from the men.  As soon as  they saw us, they ran after and took two of our companions; the rest  of us got back to the ship as fast as we could.  We then got our  arms, and, determined to revenge our friends, attacked them as they  were dividing the flesh of our poor companions:  they were soon  thrown into confusion and totally routed; we slew about fifty of  them, and took two prisoners, whom we returned with.  All this time  we could get no provision.  Some were for putting the captives to  death, but not approving of this, I kept them bound till the enemy  should send ambassadors to redeem them, which they did; for we soon  heard them lowing in a melancholy tone, and most humbly beseeching  us to release their friends.  The ransom agreed on was a quantity of  cheeses, dried fish, and onions, together with four stags, each  having three feet, two behind and one before.  In consideration of  this, we released the prisoners, stayed one day there, and set sail.    We soon observed the fish swimming and the birds flying round about  us, with other signs of our being near the land; and in a very  little time after saw some men in the sea, who made use of a very  uncommon method of sailing, being themselves both ships and  passengers.  I will tell you how they did it; they laid themselves  all along in the water, they fastened to their middle a sail, and  holding the lower part of the rope in their hands, were carried  along by the wind.  Others we saw, sitting on large casks, driving  two dolphins who were yoked together, and drew the carriage after  them:  these did not run away from, nor attempt to do us any injury;  but rode round about us without fear, observing our vessel with  great attention, and seeming greatly astonished at it.    It was now almost dark, when we came in sight of a small island  inhabited by women, as we imagined, for such they appeared to us,  being all young and handsome, with long garments reaching to their  feet.  The island was called Cabalusa, and the city Hydamardia.  {147a}  I stopped a little, for my mind misgave me, and looking  round, saw several bones and skulls of men on the ground; to make a  noise, call my companions together, and take up arms, I thought  would be imprudent.  I pulled out my mallow, {147b} therefore, and  prayed most devoutly that I might escape the present evil; and a  little time afterwards, as one of the strangers was helping us to  something, I perceived, instead of a woman's foot, the hoof of an  ass.  Upon this I drew my sword, seized on and bound her, and  insisted on her telling me the truth with regard to everything about  them.  She informed me, much against her will, that she and the rest  of the inhabitants were women belonging to the sea, that they were  called Onoscileas, {148} and that they lived upon travellers who  came that way.  \"We make them drunk,\" said she, \"and when they are  asleep, make an end of them.\"  As soon as she had told me this, I  left her bound there, and getting upon the house, called out to my  companions, brought them together, showed them the bones, and led  them in to her; when on a sudden she dissolved away into water, and  disappeared.  I dipped my sword into it by way of experiment, and  the water turned into blood.    We proceeded immediately to our vessel and departed.  At break of  day we had a view of that continent which we suppose lies directly  opposite to our own.  Here, after performing our religious rites,  and putting up our prayers, we consulted together about what was to  be done next.  Some were of opinion that, after making a little  descent on the coast, we should turn back again; others were for  leaving the ship there, and marching up into the heart of the  country, to explore the inhabitants.  Whilst we were thus disputing  a violent storm arose, and driving our ship towards the land, split  it in pieces.  We picked up our arms, and what little things we  could lay hold on, and with difficulty swam ashore.    Such were the adventures which befell us during our voyage, at sea,  in the islands, in the air, in the whale, amongst the heroes, in the  land of dreams, and lastly, amongst the Bucephali, and the  Onoscileae.  What we met with on the other side of the world, shall  be related in the ensuing books. {149}        ICARO-MENIPPUS.  A DIALOGUE.        This Dialogue, which is also called by the commentators [Greek], or,  \"Above the Clouds,\" has a great deal of easy wit and humour in it,  without the least degree of stiffness or obscurity; it is equally  severe on the gods and philosophers; and paints, in the warmest  colours, the glaring absurdity of the whole pagan system.        MENIPPUS AND A FRIEND.    MENIPPUS.    Three thousand stadia {153} from the earth to the moon, my first  resting-place; from thence up to the sun about five hundred  parasangas; and from the sun to the highest heaven, and the palace  of Jupiter, as far as a swift eagle could fly in a day.    FRIEND.    What are you muttering to yourself, Menippus, talking about the  stars, and pretending to measure distances?  As I walk behind you, I  hear of nothing but suns and moons, parasangas, stations, and I know  not what.    MENIPPUS.    Marvel not, my friend, if I utter things aerial and sublime; for I  am recounting the wonders of my late journey.    FRIEND.    What! tracing your road by the stars, as the Phoenicians {154} do!    MENIPPUS.    Not so, by Jove!  I have been amongst the stars themselves.    FRIEND.    You must have had a long dream, indeed, to travel so many leagues in  it.    MENIPPUS.    It is no dream, I assure you; I am just arrived from Jupiter.    FRIEND.    How say you?  Menippus let down from heaven?    MENIPPUS.    Even so:  this moment come from thence, where I have seen and heard  things most strange and miraculous.  If you doubt the truth of them,  the happier shall I be to have seen what is past belief.    FRIEND.    How is it possible, most heavenly and divine Menippus, that a mere  mortal, like me, should dispute the veracity of one who has been  carried above the clouds:  one, to speak in the language of Homer,  of the inhabitants {155} of heaven?  But inform me, I beseech you,  which way you got up, and how you procured so many ladders; for, by  your appearance, I should not take you for another Phrygian boy,  {156} to be carried up by an eagle, and made a cup-bearer of.    MENIPPUS.    You are an old scoffer, I know, and therefore I am not surprised  that an account of things above the comprehensions of the vulgar  should appear like a fable to you; but, let me tell you, I wanted no  ladders, nor an eagle's beak, to transport me thither, for I had  wings of my own.    FRIEND.    This was beyond Daedalus himself, to be metamorphosed thus into a  hawk, or jay, and we know nothing of it.    MENIPPUS.    You are not far from the mark, my friend; for my wings were a kind  of Daedalian contrivance.    FRIEND.    Thou art a bold rogue indeed, and meant no doubt, if you had chanced  to fall into any part of the ocean, to have called it, as Icarus  {157a} did, by your own name, and styled it the Menippean Sea.    MENIPPUS.    Not so; his wings were glued on with wax, and when the sun melted  it, could not escape falling; but mine had no wax in them.    FRIEND.    Indeed! now shall I quickly know the truth of this affair.    MENIPPUS.    You shall:  I took, you must know, a very large eagle {157b} and a  vulture also, one of the strongest I could get, and cut off their  wings; but, if you have leisure, I will tell you the whole  expedition from beginning to end.    FRIEND.    Pray do, for I long to hear it:  by Jove the Friendly, I entreat  thee, keep me no longer in suspense, for I am hung by the ears.    MENIPPUS.    Listen, then, for I would by no means baulk an inquisitive friend,  especially one who is nailed by the ears, as you are.  Finding, on a  close examination, that everything here below, such as riches,  honours, empire, and dominion, were all ridiculous and absurd, of no  real value or estimation, considering them, withal, as so many  obstacles to the study of things more worthy of contemplation, I  looked up towards nobler objects, and meditated on the great  universe before me; doubts immediately arose concerning what  philosophers call the world; nor could I discover how it came into  existence, its creator, the beginning or the end of it.  When I  descended to its several parts, I was still more in the dark:  I  beheld the stars, scattered as it were by the hand of chance, over  the heavens; I saw the sun, and wished to know what it was; above  all, the nature of the Moon appeared to me most wonderful and  extraordinary; the diversity of its forms pointed out some hidden  cause which I could not account for; the lightning also, which  pierces through everything, the impetuous thunder, the rain, hail,  and snow, {159} all raised my admiration, and seemed inexplicable to  human reason.  In this situation of mind, the best thing I thought  which I could possibly do was to consult the philosophers; they, I  made no doubt, were acquainted with the truth, and could impart it  to me.  Selecting, therefore, the best of them, as well as I could  judge from the paleness and severity of their countenances, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10444"],[0,"The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative (#15)"],[1,"of the League should undertake to regard themselves as _ipso facto_ at  war with a member violating these covenants and \"to take, jointly and  severally, appropriate military, economic, and other measures against  the recalcitrant State,\" thus following closely the idea of the League  to Enforce Peace.    Manifestly this last provision in the Cecil plan was open to the same  constitutional objections as those which could be raised against the  President's mutual guaranty. My impression is that Mr. Wilson's  opposition to the provision was not based on the ground that it was in  contravention of the Constitution of the United States, but rather on  the ground that it did not go far enough in stabilizing the terms of  peace which were to be negotiated. The President was seeking permanency  by insuring, through the threat or pressure of international force, a  condition of changelessness in boundaries and sovereign rights, subject,  nevertheless, to territorial changes based either on the principle of  \"self-determination\" or on a three-fourths vote of the Body of  Delegates. He, nevertheless, discussed the subject with Lord Robert  Cecil prior to laying his draft of a Covenant before the American  Commissioners, as is evident by comparing it with the Cecil plan, for  certain phrases are almost identical in language in the two documents.          CHAPTER VII    SELF-DETERMINATION      The mutual guaranty which was advocated by President Wilson appears as  Article III of his original draft of a Covenant. It reads as follows:       \"ARTICLE III       \"The Contracting Powers unite in guaranteeing to each other political     independence and territorial integrity; but it is understood between     them that such territorial readjustments, if any, as may in the     future become necessary by reason of changes in present racial     conditions and aspirations or present social and political     relationships, pursuant to the principle of self-determination, and     also such territorial readjustments as may in the judgment of three     fourths of the Delegates be demanded by the welfare and manifest     interest of the peoples concerned, may be effected if agreeable to     those peoples; and that territorial changes may in equity involve     material compensation. The Contracting Powers accept without     reservation the principle that the peace of the world is superior in     importance to every question of political jurisdiction or boundary.\"    In the revised draft, which he laid before the Commission  on the League of Nations at its first session Article III  became Article 7. It is as follows:       \"ARTICLE 7       \"The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and preserve as     against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing     political independence of all States members of the League.\"    The guaranty was finally incorporated in the Treaty of Peace as Article  10. It reads:       \"ARTICLE 10       \"The members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as     against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing     political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any     such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression     the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation     shall be fulfilled.\"    In the revision of the original draft the modifying clause providing for  future territorial readjustments was omitted. It does not appear in  Article 7 of the draft which was presented to the Commission on the  League of Nations and which formed the basis of its deliberations. In  addition to this modification the words \"unite in guaranteeing\" in  Article III became \"undertake to respect and preserve\" in Article 7.  These changes are only important in that they indicate a disposition to  revise the article to meet the wishes, and to remove to an extent the  objections, of some of the foreign delegates who had prepared plans for  a League or at least had definite ideas as to the purposes and functions  of an international organization.    It was generally believed that the elimination of the modifying clause  from the President's original form of guaranty was chiefly due to the  opposition of the statesmen who represented the British Empire in  contradistinction to those who represented the self-governing British  Dominions. It was also believed that this opposition was caused by an  unwillingness on their part to recognize or to apply as a right the  principle of \"self-determination\" in arranging possible future changes  of sovereignty over territories.    I do not know the arguments which were used to induce the President to  abandon this phrase and to strike it from his article of guaranty. I  personally doubt whether the objection to the words \"self-determination\"  was urged upon him. Whatever reasons were advanced by his foreign  colleagues, they were successful in freeing the Covenant from the  phrase. It is to be regretted that the influence, which was sufficient  to induce the President to eliminate from his proposed guaranty the  clause containing a formal acceptance of the principle of  \"self-determination,\" was not exerted or else was not potent enough to  obtain from him an open disavowal of the principle as a right standard  for the determination of sovereign authority. Without such a disavowal  the phrase remained as one of the general bases upon which a just peace  should be negotiated. It remained a precept of the international creed  which Mr. Wilson proclaimed while the war was still in progress, for he  had declared, in an address delivered on February 11, 1918, before a  joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives, that  \"self-determination is not a mere phrase. It is an imperative principle  of action which statesmen will henceforth ignore at their peril.\"    \"Self-determination\" is as right in theory as the more famous phrase  \"the consent of the governed,\" which has for three centuries been  repeatedly declared to be sound by political philosophers and has been  generally accepted as just by civilized peoples, but which has been for  three centuries commonly ignored by statesmen because the right could  not be practically applied without imperiling national safety, always  the paramount consideration in international and national affairs. The  two phrases mean substantially the same thing and have to an extent been  used interchangeably by those who advocate the principle as a standard  of right. \"Self-determination\" was not a new thought. It was a  restatement of the old one.    Under the present political organization of the world, based as it is on  the idea of nationality, the new phrase is as unsusceptible of universal  application as the old one was found to be. Fixity of national  boundaries and of national allegiance, and political stability would  disappear if this principle was uniformly applied. Impelled by new  social conditions, by economic interests, by racial prejudices, and by  the various forces which affect society, change and uncertainty would  result from an attempt to follow the principle in every case to which it  is possible to apply it.    Among my notes I find one of December 20, 1918--that is, one week after  the American Commission landed in France--in which I recorded my  thoughts concerning certain phrases or epigrams of the President, which  he had declared to be bases of peace, and which I considered to contain  the seeds of future trouble. In regard to the asserted right of  \"self-determination\" I wrote:       \"When the President talks of 'self-determination' what unit has he in     mind? Does he mean a race, a territorial area, or a community?     Without a definite unit which is practical, application of this     principle is dangerous to peace and stability.\"    Ten days later (December 30) the frequent repetition of the phrase in  the press and by members of certain groups and unofficial delegations,  who were in Paris seeking to obtain hearings before the Conference,  caused me to write the following:       \"The more I think about the President's declaration as to the right     of 'self-determination,' the more convinced I am of the danger of     putting such ideas into the minds of certain races. It is bound to be     the basis of impossible demands on the Peace Congress and create     trouble in many lands.       \"What effect will it have on the Irish, the Indians, the Egyptians,     and the nationalists among the Boers? Will it not breed discontent,     disorder, and rebellion? Will not the Mohammedans of Syria and     Palestine and possibly of Morocco and Tripoli rely on it? How can it     be harmonized with Zionism, to which the President is practically     committed?       \"The phrase is simply loaded with dynamite. It will raise hopes which     can never be realized. It will, I fear, cost thousands of lives. In     the end it is bound to be discredited, to be called the dream of an     idealist who failed to realize the danger until too late to check     those who attempt to put the principle in force. What a calamity that     the phrase was ever uttered! What misery it will cause!\"    Since the foregoing notes were written the impracticability of the  universal or even of the general application of the principle has been  fully demonstrated. Mr. Wilson resurrected \"the consent of the governed\"  regardless of the fact that history denied its value as a practical  guide in modern political relations. He proclaimed it in the phrase  \"self-determination,\" declaring it to be an \"imperative principle of  action.\" He made it one of the bases of peace. And yet, in the  negotiations at Paris and in the formulation of the foreign policy of  the United States, he has by his acts denied the existence of the right  other than as the expression of a moral precept, as something to be  desired, but generally unattainable in the lives of nations.
