The effect of this plant in that kind of Dropsy, which is  termed anasarca, where the legs and thighs are much swelled, attended  with great difficulty of breathing, is truly astonishing. In the ascites  accompanied with anasarca of people past the meridian of life it will  also sometimes succeed. The method of administering it requires some  caution, as it is liable, in greater doses, to induce very violent and  debilitating sickness, which continues one or two days, during which time  the dropsical collection however disappears. One large spoonful, or half  an ounce, of the following decoction, given twice a day, will generally  succeed in a few days. But in more robust people, one large spoonful  every two hours, till four spoonfuls are taken, or till sickness occurs,  will evacuate the dropsical swellings with greater certainty, but is  liable to operate more violently. Boil four ounces of the fresh leaves of  purple Foxglove (which leaves may be had at all seasons of the year) from  two pints of water to twelve ounces; add to the strained liquor, while  yet warm, three ounces of rectified spirit of wine. A theory of the  effects of this medicine, with many successful cases, may be seen in a  pamphlet, called, \"Experiments on Mucilaginous and Purulent Matter,\"  published by Dr. Darwin in 1780.

In the year 1720 and 1722 the  Plague made dreadful havock at Marseilles; at which time the Bishop  was indefatigable in the execution of his pastoral office, visiting,  relieving, encouraging, and absolving the sick with extream tenderness;  and though perpetually exposed to the infection, like Sir John Lawrence  mentioned below, they both are said to have escaped the disease.]    [_London's generous Mayor_, l. 435. During the great Plague at London in  the year 1665, Sir John Lawrence, the then Lord Mayor, continued the  whole time in the city; heard complaints, and redressed them; enforced  the wisest regulations then known, and saw them executed. The day after  the disease was known with certainty to be the Plague, above 40,000  servants were dismissed, and turned into the streets to perish, for no  one would receive them into their houses; and the villages near London  drove them away with pitch-forks and fire-arms. Sir John Lawrence  supported them all, as well as the needy who were sick, at first by  expending his own fortune, till subscriptions could be solicited and  received from all parts of the nation. _Journal of the Plague-year,  Printed for E.

INTERLUDE II.    _Bookseller._ The monsters of your Botanic Garden are as surprising as  the bulls with brazen feet, and the fire-breathing dragons, which guarded  the Hesperian fruit; yet are they not disgusting, nor mischievous: and  in the manner you have chained them together in your exhibition, they  succeed each other amusingly enough, like prints of the London Cries,  wrapped upon rollers, with a glass before them. In this at least they  resemble the monsters in Ovid's Metamorphoses; but your similies, I  suppose, are Homeric?    _Poet._ The great Bard well understood how to make use of this kind of  ornament in Epic Poetry. He brings his valiant heroes into the field with  much parade, and sets them a fighting with great fury; and then, after a  few thrusts and parries, he introduces a long string of similies. During  this the battle is supposed to continue; and thus the time necessary for  the action is gained in our imaginations; and a degree of probability  produced, which contributes to the temporary deception or reverie of the  reader.    But the similies of Homer have another agreeable characteristic; they  do not quadrate, or go upon all fours (as it is called), like the more  formal similies of some modern writers; any one resembling feature seems  to be with him a sufficient excuse for the introduction of this kind of  digression; he then proceeds to deliver some agreeable poetry on this new  subject, and thus converts every simile into a kind of short episode.    _B._ Then a simile should not very accurately resemble the subject?    _P._ No; it would then become a philosophical analogy, it would be  ratiocination instead of poetry: it need only so far resemble the  subject, as poetry itself ought to resemble nature. It should have so  much sublimity, beauty, or novelty, as to interest the reader; and should  be expressed in picturesque language, so as to bring the scenery before  his eye; and should lastly bear so much veri-similitude as not to awaken  him by the violence of improbability or incongruity.    _B._ May not the reverie of the reader be dissipated or disturbed by  disagreeable images being presented to his imagination, as well as by  improbable or incongruous ones? _P_. Certainly; he will endeavour to  rouse himself from a disagreeable reverie, as from the night-mare. And  from this may be discovered the line of boundary between the Tragic and  the Horrid: which line, however, will veer a little this way or that,  according to the prevailing manners of the age or country, and the  peculiar associations of ideas, or idiosyncracy of mind, of individuals.  For instance, if an artist should represent the death of an officer in  battle, by shewing a little blood on the bosom of his shirt, as if a  bullet had there penetrated, the dying figure would affect the beholder  with pity; and if fortitude was at the same time expressed in his  countenance, admiration would be added to our pity. On the contrary, if  the artist should chuse to represent his thigh as shot away by a cannon  ball, and should exhibit the bleeding flesh and shattered bone of the  stump, the picture would introduce into our minds ideas from a butcher's  shop, or a surgeon's operation-room, and we should turn from it with  disgust. So if characters were brought upon the stage with their limbs  disjointed by torturing instruments, and the floor covered with clotted  blood and scattered brains, our theatric reverie would be destroyed by  disgust, and we should leave the play-house with detestation.

A teacher, who would prepare in summer  such illustrations as these, would find them of great use in his winter  lessons. The actual objects make an impression that the cuts in the book  cannot give.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Series of palmately-veined leaves.]    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Series of pinnately-veined leaves.]    Let the pupils compare the distribution of the veins in their specimens.  They have already distinguished parallel-veined from netted-veined leaves,  and learned that this difference is a secondary distinction between  monocotyledons and dicotyledons.[1] The veins in netted-veined leaves are  arranged in two ways. The veins start from either side of a single midrib  (_feather-veined_ or _pinnately-veined_), or they branch from a number of  ribs which all start from the top of the petiole, like the fingers from  the palm of the hand (_palmately-veined_). The compound leaves correspond  to these modes of venation; they are either pinnately or palmately  compound.    [Footnote 1: See page 34.]    These ribs and veins are the woody framework of the leaf, supporting the  soft green pulp. The woody bundles are continuous with those of the stem,  and carry the crude sap, brought from the roots, into the cells of every  part of the leaf, where it is brought into contact with the external  air, and the process of making food (_Assimilation_ 4) is carried on.  \"Physiologically, leaves are green expansions borne by the stern,  outspread in the air and light, in which assimilation and the processes  connected with it are carried on.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Gray's Structural Botany, p. 85.]    The whole leaf is covered with a delicate skin, or epidermis, continuous  with that of the stem.[1]    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. XI. Protection of Leaves from the Attacks  of Animals.]      2. _Descriptions_.--As yet the pupils have had no practice in writing  technical descriptions. This sort of work may be begun when they come to  the study of leaves. In winter a collection of pressed specimens will be  useful. Do not attach importance to the memorizing of terms. Let them be  looked up as they are needed, and they will become fixed by practice. The  pupils may fill out such schedules as the following with any leaves that  are at hand.

[Footnote 1: The specimen described is a leaf of Copper Beech.]    In describing shapes, etc., the pupils can find the terms in the book as  they need them. It is desirable at first to give leaves that are easily  matched with the terms, keeping those which need compound words, such as  lance-ovate, etc., to come later. The pupils are more interested if they  are allowed to press and keep the specimens they have described. It is not  well to put the pressed leaves in their note books, as it is difficult to  write in the books without spoiling the specimens. It is better to mount  the specimens on white paper, keeping these sheets in brown paper covers.  The pupils can make illustrations for themselves by sorting leaves  according to the shapes, outlines, etc., and mounting them.      3. _Transpiration_.--This term is used to denote the evaporation of water  from a plant. The evaporation takes place principally through breathing  pores, which are scattered all over the surface of leaves and young stems.  The _breathing pores_, or _stomata_, of the leaves, are small openings  in the epidermis through which the air can pass into the interior of the  plant. Each of these openings is called a _stoma_. \"They are formed by a  transformation of some of the cells of the epidermis; and consist usually  of a pair of cells (called guardian cells), with an opening between  them, which communicates with an air-chamber within, and thence with the  irregular intercellular spaces which permeate the interior of the leaf.  Through the stomata, when open, free interchange may take place between  the external air and that within the leaf, and thus transpiration be  much facilitated. When closed, this interchange will be interrupted or  impeded.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Gray's Structural Botany, page 89. For a description of the  mechanism of the stomata, see Physiological Botany, p. 269.]    In these lessons, however, it is not desirable to enter upon subjects  involving the use of the compound microscope. Dr. Goodale says: \"Whether  it is best to try to explain to the pupils the structure of these valves,  or stomata, must be left to each teacher. It would seem advisable to  pass by the subject untouched, unless the teacher has become reasonably  familiar with it by practical microscopical study of leaves. For a teacher  to endeavor to explain the complex structure of the leaf, without having  seen it for himself, is open to the same objection which could be urged  against the attempted explanation of complicated machinery by one who has  never seen it, but has heard about it. What is here said with regard to  stomata applies to all the more recondite matters connected with plant  structure.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Concerning a few Common Plants, p. 29.]    There are many simple experiments which can be used to illustrate the  subject.    (1) Pass the stem of a cutting through a cork, fitting tightly into the  neck of a bottle of water. Make the cork perfectly air-tight by coating it  with beeswax or paraffine. The level of the liquid in the bottle will be  lowered by the escape of water through the stem and leaves of the cutting  into the atmosphere.    (2) Cut two shoots of any plant, leave one on the table and place the  other in a glass of water.[1] The first will soon wilt, while the other  will remain fresh. If the latter shoot be a cutting from some plant that  will root in water, such as Ivy, it will not fade at all. Also, leave one  of the plants in the schoolroom unwatered for a day or two, till it begins  to wilt. If the plant be now thoroughly watered, it will recover and the  leaves will resume their normal appearance.    [Footnote 1: Lessons in Elementary Botany, by Daniel Oliver, London.  Macmillan & Co., 1864, pp. 14-15.]    Evaporation is thus constantly taking place from the leaves, and if there  is no moisture to supply the place of what is lost, the cells collapse and  the leaf, as we say, wilts. When water is again supplied the cells swell  and the leaf becomes fresh.    (3) Place two seedlings in water, one with its top, the other with its  roots in the jar. The latter will remain fresh while the first wilts and  dies.    Absorption takes place through the roots. The water absorbed is drawn up  through the woody tissues of the stem (4), and the veins of the leaves  (5), whence it escapes into the air (6).    (4) Plunge a cut branch immediately into a colored solution, such as  aniline red, and after a time make sections in the stem above the liquid  to see what tissues have been stained.[1]    [Footnote 1: The Essentials of Botany, by Charles E. Bessey. New York,  Henry Holt & Co., 1884. Page 74. See also Physiological Botany, pp.  259-260.]    (5) \"That water finds its way by preference through the fibro-vascular  bundles even in the more delicate parts, is shown by placing the cut  peduncle of a white tulip, or other large white flower, in a harmless dye,  and then again cutting off its end in order to bring a fresh surface in  contact with the solution,[1] when after a short time the dye will mount  through the flower-stalk and tinge the parts of the perianth according to  the course of the bundles.\"[2]    [Footnote 1: If the stems of flowers are cut under water they will last a  wonderfully long time. \"One of the most interesting characteristics of the  woody tissues in relation to the transfer of water is the immediate change  which the cut surface of a stem undergoes upon exposure to the air,  unfitting it for its full conductive work. De Vries has shown that when a  shoot of a vigorous plant, for instance a Helianthus, is bent down under  water, care being taken not to break it even in the slightest degree,  a clean, sharp cut will give a surface which will retain the power of  absorbing water for a long time; while a similar shoot cut in the open  air, even if the end is instantly plunged under water, will wither much  sooner than the first.\"--Physiological Botany, p. 263.]    [Footnote 2: Physiological Botany, p. 260.]    (6) Let the leaves of a growing plant rest against the window-pane.  Moisture will be condensed on the cold surface of the glass, wherever the  leaf is in contact with it. This is especially well seen in Nasturtium  (Tropaeolum) leaves, which grow directly against a window, and leave the  marks even of their veining on the glass, because the moisture is only  given out from the green tissue, and where the ribs are pressed against  the glass it is left dry.    Sometimes the water is drawn up into the cells of the leaves faster than  it can"]]]
