If it be painful to the writer of these sheets to find little else than  crimes and their consequences to record, how much more painful must it  have been to have lived where they were daily committed. Particularly so  must it have proved to the gentleman who was in the chief direction of  the settlement, who found himself either obliged to punish with severity,  or to be fearful even of administering justice in mercy, lest that mercy  should prove detrimental in the end, by encouraging others to offend in  the hope of impunity.    There can scarcely be recorded a stronger instance of human depravity,  than what the following circumstance, which happened in this month,  exhibits. A convict, who had formerly been a school-companion with the  Rev. Mr. Johnson, had been taken by that gentleman into his service,  where he reposed in him the utmost confidence, and treated him with the  kindest indulgence. He had not been long in his house before Mr. Johnson  was informed that his servant, having taken an impression of the key of  his storeroom in clay, had procured one that would fit the lock. He  scarcely credited the information; but, being urged to furnish him with  an opportunity, he consented that a constable should be concealed in the  house, on a Sunday, when all the family, this servant excepted, would be  attending divine service. The arrangement succeeded but too well.  Concluding that all was safe, he applied his key, and, entering the room,  was proceeding without any remorse to plunder it of such articles as he  wanted; when the constable, seeing his prey within his toils, started  from his concealment, and seized him in the act of taking the property.    Thus was this wretched being without 'one compunctious visiting of  nature,' detected in the act of injuring the man, who, in the better day  of his prosperity, had been the companion of his youth, and who had  stretched out his hand to shelter him in the present hour of his  adversity!    The _Deptford_ brig sailing this month for the coast of Coromandel,  the governor took the opportunity of transmitting to Admiral Rainier, or  the commander in chief of his Majesty's ships in the East Indies, a list  of the deserted convicts, and a description of the two boats which had  lately been taken from the colony. As it was, probably, the intention of  those people to steer along the coast of New South Wales to the  northward, until they should reach some of the Dutch settlements among  the Molucca islands, there was a possibility of their being picked up by  some of the King's cruisers; in the event of which, the governor forcibly  urged their being forwarded, by any opportunity which might offer, to his  government, there to be made an example that should, if possible, deter  others from making the like attempts.    The widow of Ensign Brock's, who died in July last, availed herself of  this opportunity to get, with her family, partly on her way to England.    Although the settlement had now been established within a month of ten  years, yet little had been added to the stock of natural history which  had been acquired in the first year or two of its infancy. The Kangaroo,  the Dog, the Opossum, the Flying Squirrel, the Kangaroo Rat, a spotted  Rat, the common Rat, and the large Fox-bat (if entitled to a place in  this society), made up the whole catalogue of animals that were known at  this time, with the exception which must now be made of an amphibious  animal, of the mole species, one of which had been lately found on the  banks of a lake near the Hawkesbury. In size it was considerably larger  than the land mole. The eyes were very small. The fore legs, which were  shorter than the hind, were observed, at the feet, to be provided with  four claws, and a membrane, or web, that spread considerably beyond them,  while the feet of the hind legs were furnished, not only with this  membrane or web, but with four long and sharp claws, that projected as  much beyond the web, as the web projected beyond the claws of the fore  feet. The tail of this animal was thick, short, and very fat; but the  most extraordinary circumstance observed in its structure was, its  having, instead of the mouth of an animal, the upper and lower mandibles  of a duck. By these it was enabled to supply itself with food, like that  bird, in muddy places, or on the banks of the lakes, in which its webbed  feet enabled it to swim; while on shore its long and sharp claws were  employed in burrowing; nature thus providing for it in its double or  amphibious character. These little animals had been frequently noticed  rising to the surface of the water, and blowing like the turtle.    The subjoined engraving is from a drawing made on the spot by Governor  Hunter.    Among the few circumstances that occurred out of the common course of  events, must be mentioned that of a man belonging to the hospital, who,  in endeavouring to get hold of a boat which was close to the shore,  over-reached himself and fell into deep water, where he was drowned. The  body being immediately found, the means recommended by the Humane Society  in such cases were made use of, but without the desired effect.    The barracks for the assistant surgeons, and the tower of the intended  church, were nearly completed during this month, and the paling round the  new store-house was begun. The _Reliance_, whose leaks had been  discovered, was strengthened with riders, several people being employed  to bring in timber for that purpose. These formed some of the public  works at Sydney. At Parramatta, Toongabbie, and the other interior  settlements, all were actively employed in securing the abundant crops  which every where promised to reward the industry of the settler and the  labourer.    The annual election of constables took place in this month. These  municipal regulations were attended at least with the advantage of  introducing something like a system of regularity into the settlement,  than which nothing was more likely to check the relaxation which had  lately prevailed in it.    The weather in November was, for the first and middle parts, very  unsettled, blowing hard at times with much rain. On one day, there fell a  shower of hail, the stones of which were each as big as a lark's egg. The  latter part of the month was fair, and favourable for reaping the grain.          CHAPTER VII        Bennillong and Cole-be  Various particulars respecting the natives  Ye-ra-nibe killed  A settler's house burnt through malice  Schools at Sydney  Two settlers drink for a wager  The body of a soldier found  Criminal court  The _Francis_ sails for the wreck  Weather  Houses burnt  Public labour  Harvest  Account of live stock and ground in cultivation      December.] A circumstance occurred about the beginning of this month,  that excited much interest in the town of Sydney, and great commotion  among the natives. Two of these people, both of them well known in the  settlement, (Cole-be, the friend of Bennillong, and one of the  Ye-ra-ni-bes) meeting in the town, while their bosoms were yet swelling on  occasion of some former difference, attacked each other. Cole-be had  always been remarked for his activity, but Ye-ra-ni-be had more youth  than his adversary, and was reckoned a perfect match for him. On closing  on each other, with their clubs, until which time Cole-be had not gained  any advantage over Ye-ra-ni-be, the handle of Ye-ra-ni-be's shield drew  out, and it consequently fell from his grasp: while stooping to take it  up, the other struck him on the head with a club, which staggered him,  and followed his blow while he was in that defenceless situation.    Cole-be knew that this would ensure him the appellation of jeerun, or  coward, and that the friends of Ye-ra-ni-be would as certainly take up  his cause. As the consequences might be very serious if he should die of  the blow, he thought it prudent to abscond for a while, and Yera-ni-be  was taken care of by some of his white friends. This happened on the  10th, and on the 16th he died. In this interval he was constantly  attended by some of his male and female associates, particularly by his  two friends, Collins (for Gnung-a Gnung-a still went by the late  judge-advocate's name) and Mo-roo-bra. On one of the nights when a most  dismal song of lamentation had been sung over him, in which the women  were the principal performers, his male friends, after listening for some  time with great apparent attention, suddenly started up, and, seizing  their weapons, went off in a most savage rage, determined on revenge.  Knowing pretty well where to meet with Cole-be, they beat him very  severely, but would not kill him, reserving that gratification of their  revenge until the fate of their companion should be decided. On the  following night, Collins and Mo-roo-bra attacked a relation of Cole-be's,  Boo-ra-wan-ye, whom they beat about the head with such cruelty that his  recovery was doubtful. As their vengeance extends to all the family and  relations of a culprit, what a misfortune it must be to be connected with  a man of a choleric disposition!    Ye-ra-ni-be was buried the day after his decease by the side of the  public road, below the military barracks. He was placed by his friends  upon a large piece of bark, and laid into a grave, which was formed by  them after our manner (only not so deep), they seeming in this instance  to be desirous of imitating our custom. Bennillong assisted at the  ceremony, placing the head of the corpse, by which he struck a beautiful  war-ra-taw, and covering the body with the blanket on which he died.  Being supplied with some spades, the earth was thrown in by the  by-standers, during which, and indeed throughout the whole of the  ceremony, the women howled and cried excessively; but this was the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1268"],[0,"The Mysterious Island (#15)"],[1," replied Pencroft.    \"But, whether it is an island or a continent,\" asked Gideon Spilett,  \"whereabouts do you think, Cyrus, this storm has thrown us?\"    \"I cannot say exactly,\" replied the engineer, \"but I presume it is  some land in the Pacific. In fact, when we left Richmond, the wind was  blowing from the northeast, and its very violence greatly proves that  it could not have varied. If the direction has been maintained from  the northeast to the southwest, we have traversed the States of North  Carolina, of South Carolina, of Georgia, the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico,  itself, in its narrow part, then a part of the Pacific Ocean. I cannot  estimate the distance traversed by the balloon at less than six to seven  thousand miles, and, even supposing that the wind had varied half a  quarter, it must have brought us either to the archipelago of Mendava,  either on the Pomotous, or even, if it had a greater strength than I  suppose, to the land of New Zealand. If the last hypothesis is correct,  it will be easy enough to get home again. English or Maoris, we shall  always find some one to whom we can speak. If, on the contrary, this is  the coast of a desert island in some tiny archipelago, perhaps we shall  be able to reconnoiter it from the summit of that peak which overlooks  the country, and then we shall see how best to establish ourselves here  as if we are never to go away.\"    \"Never?\" cried the reporter. \"You say 'Never,' my dear Cyrus?\"    \"Better to put things at the worst at first,\" replied the engineer, \"and  reserve the best for a surprise.\"    \"Well said,\" remarked Pencroft. \"It is to be hoped, too, that this  island, if it be one, is not situated just out of the course of ships;  that would be really unlucky!\"    \"We shall not know what we have to rely on until we have first made the  ascent of the mountain,\" replied the engineer.    \"But to-morrow, captain,\" asked Herbert, \"shall you be in a state to  bear the fatigue of the ascent?\"    \"I hope so,\" replied the engineer, \"provided you and Pencroft, my boy,  show yourselves quick and clever hunters.\"    \"Captain,\" said the sailor, \"since you are speaking of game, if on my  return, I was as certain of roasting it as I am of bringing it back--\"    \"Bring it back all the same, Pencroft,\" replied Harding.    It was then agreed that the engineer and the reporter were to pass the  day at the Chimneys, so as to examine the shore and the upper plateau.  Neb, Herbert, and the sailor were to return to the forest, renew their  store of wood, and lay violent hands on every creature, feathered or  hairy, which might come within their reach.    They set out accordingly about ten o'clock in the morning, Herbert  confident, Neb joyous, Pencroft murmuring aside,--    \"If, on my return, I find a fire at the house, I shall believe that  the thunder itself came to light it.\" All three climbed the bank; and  arrived at the angle made by the river, the sailor, stopping, said to  his two companions,--    \"Shall we begin by being hunters or wood-men?\"    \"Hunters,\" replied Herbert. \"There is Top already in quest.\"    \"We will hunt, then,\" said the sailor, \"and afterwards we can come back  and collect our wood.\"    This agreed to, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, after having torn three  sticks from the trunk of a young fir, followed Top, who was bounding  about among the long grass.    This time, the hunters, instead of following the course of the river,  plunged straight into the heart of the forest. There were still the  same trees, belonging, for the most part, to the pine family. In  certain places, less crowded, growing in clumps, these pines exhibited  considerable dimensions, and appeared to indicate, by their development,  that the country was situated in a higher latitude than the engineer had  supposed. Glades, bristling with stumps worn away by time, were covered  with dry wood, which formed an inexhaustible store of fuel. Then,  the glade passed, the underwood thickened again, and became almost  impenetrable.    It was difficult enough to find the way among the groups of trees,  without any beaten track. So the sailor from time to time broke off  branches which might be easily recognized. But, perhaps, he was wrong  not to follow the watercourse, as he and Herbert had done on their first  excursion, for after walking an hour not a creature had shown itself.  Top, running under the branches, only roused birds which could not be  approached. Even the couroucous were invisible, and it was probable that  the sailor would be obliged to return to the marshy part of the forest,  in which he had so happily performed his grouse fishing.    \"Well, Pencroft,\" said Neb, in a slightly sarcastic tone, \"if this is  all the game which you promised to bring back to my master, it won't  need a large fire to roast it!\"    \"Have patience,\" replied the sailor, \"it isn't the game which will be  wanting on our return.\"    \"Have you not confidence in Captain Harding?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But you don't believe that he will make fire?\"    \"I shall believe it when the wood is blazing in the fireplace.\"    \"It will blaze, since my master has said so.\"    \"We shall see!\"    Meanwhile, the sun had not reached the highest point in its course above  the horizon. The exploration, therefore, continued, and was usefully  marked by a discovery which Herbert made of a tree whose fruit was  edible. This was the stone-pine, which produces an excellent almond,  very much esteemed in the temperate regions of America and Europe. These  almonds were in a perfect state of maturity, and Herbert described them  to his companions, who feasted on them.    \"Come,\" said Pencroft, \"sea-weed by way of bread, raw mussels for meat,  and almonds for dessert, that's certainly a good dinner for those who  have not a single match in their pocket!\"    \"We mustn't complain,\" said Herbert.    \"I am not complaining, my boy,\" replied Pencroft, \"only I repeat, that  meat is a little too much economized in this sort of meal.\"    \"Top has found something!\" cried Neb, who ran towards a thicket, in the  midst of which the dog had disappeared, barking. With Top's barking were  mingled curious gruntings.    The sailor and Herbert had followed Neb. If there was game there this  was not the time to discuss how it was to be cooked, but rather, how  they were to get hold of it.    The hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw Top engaged  in a struggle with an animal which he was holding by the ear. This  quadruped was a sort of pig nearly two feet and a half long, of a  blackish brown color, lighter below, having hard scanty hair; its toes,  then strongly fixed in the ground, seemed to be united by a membrane.  Herbert recognized in this animal the capybara, that is to say, one of  the largest members of the rodent order.    Meanwhile, the capybara did not struggle against the dog. It stupidly  rolled its eyes, deeply buried in a thick bed of fat. Perhaps it saw men  for the first time.    However, Neb having tightened his grasp on his stick, was just going to  fell the pig, when the latter, tearing itself from Top's teeth, by which  it was only held by the tip of its ear, uttered a vigorous grunt, rushed  upon Herbert, almost overthrew him, and disappeared in the wood.    \"The rascal!\" cried Pencroft.    All three directly darted after Top, but at the moment when they joined  him the animal had disappeared under the waters of a large pond shaded  by venerable pines.    Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft stopped, motionless. Top plunged into the  water, but the capybara, hidden at the bottom of the pond, did not  appear.    \"Let us wait,\" said the boy, \"for he will soon come to the surface to  breathe.\"    \"Won't he drown?\" asked Neb.    \"No,\" replied Herbert, \"since he has webbed feet, and is almost an  amphibious animal. But watch him.\"    Top remained in the water. Pencroft and his two companions went to  different parts of the bank, so as to cut off the retreat of the  capybara, which the dog was looking for beneath the water.    Herbert was not mistaken. In a few minutes the animal appeared on the  surface of the water. Top was upon it in a bound, and kept it from  plunging again. An instant later the capybara, dragged to the bank, was  killed by a blow from Neb's stick.    \"Hurrah!\" cried Pencroft, who was always ready with this cry of triumph.    \"Give me but a good fire, and this pig shall be gnawed to the bones!\"    Pencroft hoisted the capybara on his shoulders, and judging by the  height of the sun that it was about two o'clock, he gave the signal to  return.    Top's instinct was useful to the hunters, who, thanks to the intelligent  animal, were enabled to discover the road by which they had come. Half  an hour later they arrived at the river.    Pencroft soon made a raft of wood, as he had done before, though if  there was no fire it would be a useless task, and the raft following the  current, they returned towards the Chimneys.    But the sailor had not gone fifty paces when he stopped, and again  uttering a tremendous hurrah, pointed towards the angle of the cliff,--    \"Herbert! Neb! Look!\" he shouted.    Smoke was escaping and curling up among the rocks.        Chapter 10    In a few minutes the three hunters were before a crackling fire. The  captain and the reporter were there. Pencroft looked from one to the  other, his capybara in his hand, without saying a word.    \"Well, yes, my brave fellow,\" cried the reporter.    \"Fire, real fire, which will roast this splendid pig perfectly, and we  will have a feast presently!\"    \"But who lighted it?\" asked Pencroft.    \"The sun!\"    Gideon Spilett was quite right in his reply. It was the sun which  had furnished the heat which so astonished Pencroft. The sailor could  scarcely believe his eyes, and he was so amazed that he did not think of  questioning the engineer.    \"Had you a burning-glass, sir?\" asked Herbert of Harding.    \"No, my boy,\" replied he, \"but I made one.\" "]]]
