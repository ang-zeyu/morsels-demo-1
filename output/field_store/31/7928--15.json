Four things cancel the decrees of Heaven:--Alms, prayer, change of name,  and reformation of conduct. Alms, as it is written (Prov. x. 2), \"But  alms (more correctly, righteousness) delivereth from death.\" Prayer as  it is written (Ps. cvii. 6). \"Then they cried unto the Lord in their  trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses.\" Change of name,  as it is said (Gen. xvii. 15, 16), \"As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt  not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.\" And after this  change of name it is written, \"And I will bless her, and give thee a son  of her.\" Reformation of conduct, as it is written (Jonah iii. 10), \"And  God saw their works,\" and \"God repented of the evil,\" etc. Some say also  change of residence has the effect of turning back the decree of Heaven  (Gen. xii. 1), \"And the Lord said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy  country;\" and then it is said, \"I will make of thee a great nation.\"    _Rosh Hashanah_, fol. 16, col. 2.    Four things cause an eclipse of the sun:--When a chief magistrate dies  and is not mourned over with the due lamentation; when a betrothed  damsel calls for help and no one comes to the rescue; when the people  commit the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah; and when brother murders brother.    _Succah_, fol. 29, col. 1.    Four things cause an eclipse among the luminaries of heaven: The writing  of false documents; the bearing false witness; the breeding of small  cattle, such as sheep and goats, in the land of Israel; and the cutting  down of fruit-trees.    Ibid., fol. 29, col. 1.    There are four things God repents of having created:--The Captivity, the  Chaldeans, the Ishmaelites, and the evil passion in man. The Captivity,  as it is written (Isa. lii. 5), \"What have I here, saith the Lord, that  my people are taken away for nought?\" etc. The Chaldeans, as it is  written (Isa. xxiii. 13), \"Behold the land of the Chaldeans: this people  was not.\" The Ishmaelites, as it is written (Job xii. 6), \"The tents of  robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure, into whose hand  God bringeth abundance.\" The evil passion, as it is written (Micah iv.  6), \"And whom I have caused to be evil.\"    _Succah_, fol. 52, col. 2.    There have been four beautiful women in the world:--Sarah, Abigail,  Rahab, and Esther.    _Meggillah_, fol. 15, col. 1.        Tosephoth asks, \"Why was not Eve numbered among these beauties,      since even Sarah, in comparison with Eve, was an ape compared to      a man?\" The reply is, \"Only those born of woman are here      enumerated.\"        In fol. 13, col. i, of the same treatise from which the above is      quoted, we are informed by Ben Azai that Esther was like the      myrtle-tree, neither tall nor short statured, but middle-sized.      Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha states that Esther's complexion was of      a yellow or gold color.    One cup of wine is good for a woman, two are disgraceful, three  demoralizing, and four brutalizing.    _Kethuboth_, fol. 65, col. 1.    He who traverses so much as four ells in the land of Israel is sure of  everlasting life.    Ibid., fol. III, col. 1.    To walk even four ells without bowing the head is an offense to Heaven;  for it is written (Isa. vi. 3), \"The whole earth is full of His glory.\"    _Kiddushin_, fol. 31, col. 1.    There are four who are accounted as dead:--The pauper, the leper, the  blind man, and he who has no male children.    _Nedarin_, fol. 64, col. 2.    Four things mark the characters of men:--He who says what is mine is  mine, and what is thine is thine, is, according to some, a moderate man,  but, according to others, a child of Sodom; he who says what is mine is  thine, and what is thine is mine, is an ignorant man; he who says what  is mine is thine and what is thy own is also thine, is a pious man; he  who says mine and thine are both my own, is a wicked man.    _Avoth_, chap. 5, sec. 16.    There are four kinds of men, according to their degrees of  passionateness:--He who is easily provoked and as readily pacified, and  who loses more than he gains; he whom it is difficult to rouse and as  difficult to appease, and who gains more than he loses; he who is not  readily provoked, but easily pacified, who is a pious man; he who is  easily provoked and with difficulty appeased, who is a wicked man.    Ibid., chap. 5, sec. 19.    There are four classes of men who give alms, and they are thus  distinguished:--He who is willing to give, but unwilling that others  should do so, he has an evil eye toward others; he who wishes others to  give, but does not do so himself, he has an evil eye toward himself; he  who gives, and induces others to give, he is pious; he who gives not,  nor wishes others to give he is wicked.    _Avoth_, chap 5, sec. 19.    There are four marks by which one disciple differs from another:--One  learns and does not teach, one teaches and does not learn, one learns  and teaches, and one neither learns nor teaches.    _Avoth d'Rab. Nathan_, chap. 29.    Four things, if kept in view and gravely pondered over, deter from  sin:--That a man consider whence he cometh, whither he goeth, who the  judge will be, and what the future will bring to pass.    _Derech Eretz_, chap. 3.    What is the meaning of that which is written (Ps. lxxxvii 2), \"The Lord  loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob?\" The  answer is, The Lord loveth the gates that are marked with the Halachah  more than the synagogues and the schools; and this agrees with what  Rabbi Cheeya bar Ami has said, in the name of Ulla, that since the  destruction of the Temple nothing else has remained to God in His world  but four ells of the Halachah.    _Berachoth_, fol. 8, col. 1.    Whoso walks even four ells with a proud unbending gait is as though he  spurned with his haughty head the feet of the Shechinah; for it is  written (Isa. vi. 3), \"The whole earth is full of His glory.\"    Ibid., fol. 43, col. 2.    Four are in duty bound to return thanks to God:--They that have returned  from a voyage at sea (Ps. cvii. 23, 24, 31); those who have traveled in  the desert (verses 4-8); they who have recovered from a serious illness  (verses 17-21); and those that are liberated from prison (verses 10-15).    _Berachoth_, fol. 54, col. 2.    If one does not walk, say four cubits, before falling asleep after a  meal, that which he has eaten, being undigestible, causes foulness of  breath.    _Shabbath_, fol. 41, col. 1.    Four have died in consequence of the seduction of the  serpent:--Benjamin, the son of Jacob; Amram, the father of Moses; Jesse,  the father of David; and Chileab, the son of David.    Ibid., fol. 55, col. 2.        These four are reckoned to have died on account of original sin,      and not solely because of actual transgression, which, says      Rashi, they never committed.    The traveler who is overtaken with the approach of Sabbath-eve before he  has completed his journey should hand over his purse to a Gentile to  carry; and if there be no Gentile at hand, let him stow it away on his  ass. As soon as the nearest halting-place is reached, those burdens  which may be lifted on the Sabbath should then be removed, and then the  cords should be slackened that the rest may slip off of its own accord.    Ibid., fol. 153, col. 1.        Here the Gemara very graciously appends a direction as to the      disposal of the purse, in case the traveler should happen to be      on foot and have no Gentile attendant. He may take care of it      himself, provided he halt at every other step and deposit it on      the ground, for at least a distance of four cubits.    A master is bound to rehearse a lesson to his pupil four times.    _Eiruvin_, fol. 54, col. 2.    Alas for the power which prepares a grave for its possessor, for there  is not a prophet who hath not in his lifetime witnessed the decadence of  four kings; as it is said (Isa. i. 1), \"The vision of Isaiah ... in the  days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah\" (see also  Hosea i. 1).    _P'sachim_, fol. 87, col. 2.    Once Rav Pappa and Rav Hunnah partook together of a common meal, and as  the latter ate only one morsel the former ate four. After this, when Rav  Hunnah and Ravina ate together, the latter devoured eight portions to  the other's one, upon which Rav Hunnah jocularly remarked, \"A hundred  (Rav) Pappas to one Ravina.\"    _P'sachim_, fol. 89, col. 2.    No food may be eaten on Passover-eve from the time of the offering of  the evening sacrifice (in order, i.e. that abstinence may whet the  appetite for the Matsoth). Even the poorest in Israel may not break his  fast till the hour of reclining; nor is he to partake of less than four  glasses of wine, even though he has been reduced so low as to subsist on  the porridge doled out by public charity.    Ibid., fol. 99, col. 2.    There are four things the doing of which by man brings judgment upon his  own head:--If he turn in between a wall and a date-palm; if he turn in  between two date-palms; if he drink borrowed water; and if he step  across spilt water, such even as his own wife may have thrown away. (All  these doings, says Rashi, are bound to annoy the evil genii.)    Ibid., fol. 111, col. 1.    Four precepts did our holy Rabbi (Yehudah Hakadosh) urge upon his  children:--Not to choose Shechentzia as a dwelling-place, for scoffers  resided there; not to use the bed of a Syrian odalisque; not to shirk  the payment of fiscal dues, lest the collector should confiscate all  their property; not to face an ox when he came up (ruffled) from the  cane-brake, for Satan sported betwixt his horns.    _P'sachim_, fol. 112, col. 2.    Whosoever prieth into the four things in the matter of the chariot in  Ezekiel's vision--what is above, what is beneath, what is before, or  what is behind--it were better for him if he had never been born.    _Chaggigah_, fol. 11, col. 2.        The work or matter of the chariot, the Rabbinic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14378"],[0,"Five Years of Theosophy (#15)"],[1,"pice;  he then proceeds to the bhagat and lays  before him the leaf and its contents, propounding at the same time his  query.  The bhagat then directs him to go out and gather two golaichi  (varieties of Posinia) flowers (such practitioners usually having a  golaichi tree close to their abodes);  after the flowers are brought the  bhagat seats himself with the rice close to the inquirer, and after some  consideration selects one of the flowers, and holding it by the stalk at  about a foot from his eyes in his left hand twirls it between his thumb  and fingers, occasionally with his right hand dropping on it a grain or  two of rice.*  In a few minutes his eyes close and he begins to talk--  usually about things having nothing to do with the question in hand, but  after a few minutes of this, he suddenly yells out an answer to the  question, and without another word retires.  The inquirer takes his  meaning as he can from the answer, which, I believe, is always  ambiguous.    ---------  * This is the process by which the bhagat mesmerizes himself.  ---------    The bharotan as I have above remarked is only resorted to when a matter  of grave import has to be inquired about;  the bhagat makes a high  charge for a seance of this description.  We will fancy that three or  four families in a village consider themselves bewitched by a najo, and  they resolve to have recourse to a bhagat to find out who the witch is;  with this view a day is fixed on, and two delegates are procured from  each of five neighbouring villages, who accompany the afflicted people  to the house of the bhagat, taking with them a dali or offering,  consisting of vegetables, which on arrival is formally presented to him.  Two delegates are posted at each of the four points of the compass, and  the other two sent themselves with the afflicted parties to the right of  the bhagat, who occupies the centre of the apartment with four or five  chelas, a clear space being reserved on the left.  One chela then brings  a small earthenware-pot full of lighted charcoal, which is set before  the bhagat with a pile of mango wood chips and a ball composed of dhunia  (resin of Shorea robusta), gur (treacle), and ghee (clarified butter),  and possibly other ingredients.  The bhagat's sole attire consists of a  scanty lenguti (waist-cloth), a necklace of the large wooden beads such  as are usually worn by fakeers, and several garlands of golaichi flowers  round his neck, his hair being unusually long and matted.  Beside him  stuck in the ground is his staff.  One chela stands over the firepot  with a bamboo-mat fan in his hand, another takes charge of the pile of  chips, and a third of the ball of composition, and one or two others  seat themselves behind the bhagat, with drums and other musical  instruments in their hands.  All being in readiness, the afflicted ones  are requested to state their grievance.  This they do, and pray the  bhagat to call before him the najo, who has stirred up the spirits to  afflict them, in order that he may be punished.  The bhagat then gives a  sign to his chelas, those behind him raise a furious din with their  instruments, the fire is fed with chips, and a bit of the composition is  put on it from time to time, producing a volume of thick greyish-blue  smoke; this is carefully fanned over, and towards the bhagat, who, when  well wrapped in smoke, closes his eyes and quietly swaying his body  begins a low chant.  The chant gradually becomes louder and the sway of  his body more pronounced, until he works himself into a state of  complete frenzy.  Then with his body actually quivering, and his head  rapidly working about from side to side, he sings in a loud voice how a  certain najo (whom he names) had asked money of those people and was  refused, and how he stirred up certain spirits (whom he also names) to  hurt them, how they killed so and so's bullocks, some one else's sheep,  and caused another's child to fall ill.  Then he begins to call on the  najo to come and answer for his doings, and in doing so rises to his  feet--still commanding the najo to appear;  meanwhile he reels about;  then falls on the ground and is quite still except for an occasional  whine, and a muttered, \"I see him!\"  \"He is coming!\" This state may last  for an hour or more till at last the bhagat sits up and announces the  najo has come;  as he says so, a man, apparently mad with drink, rushes  in and falls with his head towards the bhagat moaning and making a sort  of snorting as if half stifled.  In this person the bewitched parties  often recognize a neighbour and sometimes even a relation, but whoever  he may be they have bound themselves to punish him.  The bhagat then  speaks to him and tells him to confess, at the same time threatening  him, in case of refusal, with his staff.  He then confesses in a  half-stupefied manner, and his confession tallies with what the bhagat  has told in his frenzy.  The najo is then dismissed and runs out of the  house in the same hurry as he came in.  The delegates then hold a  council at which the najo usually is sentenced to a fine--often heavy  enough to ruin him--and expelled from his village.  Before the British  rule the convicted najo seldom escaped with his life, and during the  mutiny time, when no Englishmen were about, the Singbhoom Hos paid off a  large number of old scores of this sort.  For record of which, see  \"Statistical Account of Bengal,\" vol. xvii. p. 52.    In conclusion I have merely to add that I have derived this information  from people who have been actually concerned in these occurrences, and  among others a man belonging to a village of my own, who was convicted  and expelled from the village with the loss of all his movable property,  and one of his victims, a relation of his, sat by me when the above was  being written.    --E.D. Ewen          Mahatmas and Chelas      A Mahatma is an individual who, by special training and education, has  evolved those higher faculties, and has attained that spiritual  knowledge, which ordinary humanity will acquire after passing through  numberless series of re-incarnations during the process of cosmic  evolution, provided, of course, that they do not go, in the meanwhile,  against the purposes of Nature and thus bring on their own annihilation.  This process of the self-evolution of the MAHATMA extends over a number  of \"incarnations,\" although, comparatively speaking, they are very few.  Now, what is it that incarnates?  The occult doctrine, so far as it is  given out, shows that the first three principles die more or less with  what is called the physical death.  The fourth principle, together with  the lower portions of the fifth, in which reside the animal  propensities, has Kama Loka for its abode, where it suffers the throes  of disintegration in proportion to the intensity of those lower desires;  while it is the higher Manas, the pure man, which is associated with the  sixth and seventh principles, that goes into Devachan to enjoy there the  effects of its good Karma, and then to be reincarnated as a higher  personality.  Now an entity that is passing through the occult training  in its successive births, gradually has less and less (in each  incarnation) of that lower Manas until there arrives a time when its  whole Manas, being of an entirely elevated character, is centred in the  individuality, when such a person may be said to have become a MAHATMA.  At the time of his physical death, all the lower four principles perish  without any suffering, for these are, in fact, to him like a piece of  wearing apparel which he puts on and off at will.  The real MAHATMA is  then not his physical body but that higher Manas which is inseparably  linked to the Atma and its vehicle (the sixth principle)--a union  effected by him in a comparatively very short period by passing through  the process of self-evolution laid down by Occult Philosophy.  When  therefore, people express a desire to \"see a MAHATMA,\" they really do  not seem to understand what it is they ask for.  How can they, with  their physical eyes, hope to see that which transcends that sight?  Is  it the body--a mere shell or mask--they crave or hunt after?  And  supposing they see the body of a MAHATMA, how can they know that behind  that mask is concealed an exalted entity?  By what standard are they to  judge whether the Maya before them reflects the image of a true MAHATMA  or not?  And who will say that the physical is not a Maya? Higher things  can be perceived only by a sense pertaining to those higher things;  whoever therefore wants to see the real MAHATMA, must use his  intellectual sight.  He must so elevate his Manas that its perception  will be clear and all mists created by Maya be dispelled.  His vision  will then be bright and he will see the MAHATMA wherever he may be, for,  being merged into the sixth and the seventh principles, which know no  distance, the MAHATMA may be said to be everywhere.  But, at the same  time, just as we may be standing on a mountain top and have within our  sight the whole plain, and yet not be cognizant of any particular tree  or spot, because from that elevated position all below is nearly  identical, and as our attention may be drawn to something which may be  dissimilar to its surroundings--in the same manner, although the whole  of humanity is within the mental vision of the MAHATMA, he cannot be  expected to take special note of every human being, unless that being by  his special acts draws particular attention to himself.  The highest  interest of humanity, as a whole, is the MAHATMA's special concern, for  he has identified himself with that Universal Soul which runs through  Humanity;  and to draw his attention one must do so through that Soul.  This perception of the Manas may be called \"faith\" which should not be  confounded with blind belief.  \"Blind faith\" is an expression sometimes  used to indicate belief without"]]]
