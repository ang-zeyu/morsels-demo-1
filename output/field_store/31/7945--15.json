[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14742"],[0,"Vanishing England (#15)"],[1,"remote from Thame is the  beautiful little town of Burford, the gem of the Cotswolds. No  wonder that my friend \"Sylvanus Urban,\" otherwise Canon Beeching,  sings of its charm:--            Oh fair is Moreton in the marsh            And Stow on the wide wold,          Yet fairer far is Burford town            With its stone roofs grey and old;          And whether the sky be hot and high,            Or rain fall thin and chill,          The grey old town on the lonely down            Is where I would be still.            O broad and smooth the Avon flows            By Stratford's many piers;          And Shakespeare lies by Avon's side            These thrice a hundred years;          But I would be where Windrush sweet            Laves Burford's lovely hill--          The grey old town on the lonely down            Is where I would be still.    It is unlike any other place, this quaint old Burford, a right  pleasing place when the sun is pouring its beams upon the fantastic  creations of the builders of long ago, and when the moon is full there  is no place in England which surpasses it in picturesqueness. It is  very quiet and still now, but there was a time when Burford cloth,  Burford wool, Burford stone, Burford malt, and Burford saddles were  renowned throughout the land. Did not the townsfolk present two of its  famous saddles to \"Dutch William\" when he came to Burford with the  view of ingratiating himself into the affections of his subjects  before an important general election? It has been the scene of  battles. Not far off is Battle Edge, where the fierce kings of Wessex  and Mercia fought in 720 A.D. on Midsummer Eve, in commemoration of  which the good folks of Burford used to carry a dragon up and down the  streets, the great dragon of Wessex. Perhaps the origin of this  procession dates back to early pagan days before the battle was  fought, but tradition connects it with the fight. Memories cluster  thickly around one as you walk up the old street. It was the first  place in England to receive the privilege of a Merchant Guild. The  gaunt Earl of Warwick, the King-maker, owned the place, and  appropriated to himself the credit of erecting the almshouses, though  Henry Bird gave the money. You can still see the Earl's signature at  the foot of the document relating to this foundation--R.  Warrewych--the only signature known save one at Belvoir. You can see  the ruined Burford Priory. It is not the conventual building wherein  the monks lived in pre-Reformation days and served God in the grand  old church that is Burford's chief glory. Edmund Harman, the royal  barber-surgeon, received a grant of the Priory from Henry VIII for  curing him from a severe illness. Then Sir Laurence Tanfield, Chief  Baron of the Exchequer, owned it, who married a Burford lady,  Elizabeth Cobbe. An aged correspondent tells me that in the days of  her youth there was standing a house called Cobb Hall, evidently the  former residence of Lady Tanfield's family. He built a grand  Elizabethan mansion on the site of the old Priory, and here was born  Lucius Gary, Lord Falkland, who was slain in Newbury fight. That Civil  War brought stirring times to Burford. You have heard of the fame of  the Levellers, the discontented mutineers in Cromwell's army, the  followers of John Lilburne, who for a brief space threatened the  existence of the Parliamentary regime. Cromwell dealt with them with  an iron hand. He caught and surprised them at Burford and imprisoned  them in the church, wherein carved roughly on the font with a dagger  you can see this touching memorial of one of these poor men:--       ANTHONY SEDLEY PRISNER 1649.    [Illustration: Inscription on Font, Parish Church, Burford, Oxon]    Three of the leaders were shot in the churchyard on the following  morning in view of the other prisoners, who were placed on the leaden  roof of the church, and you can still see the bullet-holes in the old  wall against which the unhappy men were placed. The following entries  in the books of the church tell the sad story tersely:--       _Burials._--\"1649 Three soldiers shot to death in Burford     Churchyard May 17th.\"       \"Pd. to Daniel Muncke for cleansinge the Church when the     Levellers were taken 3s. 4d.\"    [Illustration: Detail of Fifteenth-century Barge-board, Burford,  Oxon.]    A walk through the streets of the old town is refreshing to an  antiquary's eyes. The old stone buildings grey with age with tile  roofs, the old Tolsey much restored, the merchants' guild mark over  many of the ancient doorways, the noble church with its eight  chapels and fine tombs, the plate of the old corporation, now in the  custody of its oldest surviving member (Burford has ceased to be an  incorporated borough), are all full of interest. Vandalism is not,  however, quite lacking, even in Burford. One of the few Gothic  chimneys remaining, a gem with a crocketed and pinnacled canopy, was  taken down some thirty years ago, while the Priory is said to be in  danger of being pulled down, though a later report speaks only of its  restoration. In the coaching age the town was alive with traffic, and  Burford races, established by the Merry Monarch, brought it much  gaiety. At the George Inn, now degraded from its old estate and cut up  into tenements, Charles I stayed. It was an inn for more than a  century before his time, and was only converted from that purpose  during the early years of the nineteenth century, when the proprietor  of the Bull Inn bought it up and closed its doors to the public with a  view to improving the prosperity of his own house. The restoration of  the picturesque almshouses founded by Henry Bird in the time of the  King-maker, a difficult piece of work, was well carried out in the  decadent days of the \"twenties,\" and happily they do not seem to have  suffered much in the process.    [Illustration: The George Inn, Burford, Oxon]    During our wanderings in the streets and lanes of rural England we  must not fail to visit the county of Essex. It is one of the least  picturesque of our counties, but it possesses much wealth of  interesting antiquities in the timber houses at Colchester, Saffron  Walden, the old town of Maldon, the inns at Chigwell and Brentwood,  and the halls of Layer Marney and Horsham at Thaxted. Saffron Walden  is one of those quaint agricultural towns whose local trade is a thing  of the past. From the records which are left of it in the shape of  prints and drawings, the town in the early part of the nineteenth  century must have been a medieval wonder. It is useless now to rail  against the crass ignorance and vandalism which has swept away so many  irreplaceable specimens of bygone architecture only to fill their  sites with brick boxes, \"likely indeed and all alike.\"    Itineraries of the Georgian period when mentioning Saffron Walden  describe the houses as being of \"mean appearance,\"[16] which remark,  taking into consideration the debased taste of the times, is  significant. A perfect holocaust followed, which extending through  that shocking time known as the Churchwarden Period has not yet spent  itself in the present day. Municipal improvements threaten to go  further still, and in these commercial days, when combined capital  under such appellations as the \"Metropolitan Co-operative\" or the  \"Universal Supply Stores\" endeavours to increase its display behind  plate-glass windows of immodest size, the life of old buildings seems  painfully insecure.      [16] _Excursions in Essex_, published in 1819, states: \"The old    market cross and gaol are taking down. The market cross has long    been considered a nuisance.\"    A good number of fine early barge-boards still remain in Saffron  Walden, and the timber houses which have been allowed to remain speak  only too eloquently of the beauties which have vanished. One of these  structures--a large timber building or collection of buildings, for  the dates of erection are various--stands in Church Street, and was  formerly the Sun Inn, a hostel of much importance in bygone times.  This house of entertainment is said to have been in 1645 the quarters  of the Parliamentary Generals Cromwell, Ireton, and Skippon. In 1870,  during the conversion of the Sun Inn into private residences, some  glazed tiles were discovered bricked up in what had once been an open  hearth. These tiles were collectively painted with a picture on each  side of the hearth, and bore the inscription \"W.E. 1730,\" while on one  of them a bust of the Lord Protector was depicted, thus showing the  tradition to have been honoured during the second George's time.[17]  Saffron Walden was the rendezvous of the Parliamentarian forces after  the sacking of Leicester, having their encampment on Triplow Heath. A  remarkable incident may be mentioned in connexion with this fact. In  1826 a rustic, while ploughing some land to the south of the town,  turned up with his share the brass seal of Leicester Hospital, which  seal had doubtless formed part of the loot acquired by the rebel army.      [17] These tiles have now found a place in the excellent local museum.    The Sun Inn, or \"House of the Giants,\" as it has sometimes been  called, from the colossal figures which appear in the pargeting over  its gateway, is a building which evidently grew with the needs of the  town, and a study of its architectural features is curiously  instructive.    The following extract from Pepys's _Diary_ is interesting as referring  to Saffron Walden:--      \"1659, Feby. 27th. Up by four o'clock. Mr. Blayton and I took    horse and straight to Saffron Walden, where at the White Hart we    set up our horses and took the master to show us Audley End House,    where the housekeeper showed us all the house, in which the    stateliness of the ceilings, chimney-pieces, and form of the whole    was exceedingly worth seeing. He took us into the cellar, where we    drank most admirable drink, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14760"],[0,"Report of the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents (#15)"],[1,"status under the control of the Ministry for Social  Welfare.      _(c) No Regulations Under the Act_    The Acts of 1925 and 1927 made provision for the gazetting of  regulations. In particular, clause 45 of the 1925 Act contemplated  regulations (_inter alia_) \"regulating the appointment and prescribing  the duties of Child Welfare Officers\". After the lapse of twenty-nine  years those duties have still not been defined and gazetted.    Furthermore, \"Child Welfare Officers\" are, under section 6, \"officers of  the Public Service\". It is astounding, therefore, to hear that, year by  year, \"Honorary Child Welfare Officers\" are appointed. The Committee has  been informed that this year 179 people were appointed or reappointed as  \"honorary\" officers, although there is no statutory authority for their  appointment and their duties are not prescribed.    The Superintendent, in his evidence regarding honorary Welfare Officers  stated: \"Some of them have nominal office only. They have the name and  that is all it amounts to\". Such a position cannot be regarded as  satisfactory. If any of them do perform useful functions (as to which no  opinion can be here expressed) at least their duties should be defined.  It is very easy (as happened a few weeks ago) for a person to pose as a  Child Welfare Officer in such circumstances as pertain at present.      _(d) No Special Selection of Magistrates_    The Act contemplates (section 27 of 1925 and section 16 of 1927) that  Magistrates shall be specially appointed to the Children's Court. In  practice, however, all Magistrates have been given jurisdiction to sit  in the Children's Court. As a result, the practice and procedure of the  Court varies throughout the Dominion.      _(e) Separate Court Buildings Not Used_    The Act also contemplated that, when a Children's Court was established,  it should not be held in an ordinary Court building. There is a  provision that if a Court has not been established in any district the  proceedings should be in a room other than the ordinary Court Room.    Serious complaints were made to the Committee that some children in the  Hutt cases had to remain in the precincts of the Magistrate's Court at  Lower Hutt awaiting an opportunity for the cases as regards them to be  called. After the children and parents had waited about for a long time  most of these cases were adjourned till another date, when again much  the same sort of thing happened. One special purpose of the Children's  Court was defeated by the fact that the Children's Court in that city  was held in the ordinary Court building.      _(f) Should Proceedings be Open to the Press_    There may be reasons why a Children's Court should be open to the public  even although the publication of names is prohibited. Under section 30  press reporters may not attend a sitting of the Children's Court unless  \"specially permitted or required by the Court to be present\". It has  often happened that a series of offences has created considerable  apprehension in the public mind. On investigation they have been found  to be due to the work of a gang or to the influence of some definite  adverse factor in the community. The public has a right to know how  child offenders have been dealt with. The Committee does not recommend  any alteration in the provision prohibiting the publication of the name  of any child or of any name or particulars likely to lead to  identification. Subject to this, it is desirable that reporters should  be allowed to attend. The Court should not be a completely secret  chamber, the decisions of which have to be gathered by rumour or by the  seeking of information through interviews away from the Court.      _(g) No Follow-up Procedure_    When children are placed \"under supervision\" there is not any procedure  whereby reports are submitted to the Court or other body concerning  their welfare or their doings. Again, when children are committed to the  care of the State or are under supervision as a result of delinquency  they may lawfully be transferred from one institution to another or may  be boarded out in foster-homes without any intimation being made to  their own parents. If a child is boarded out in another district it may  be enrolled at a school without the principal being given such  information as might enable him to be of assistance in its reclamation.    The Committee feels that there should be some person or body apart from  the departmental officers to whom a child could turn for help if it is  unhappy in its new surroundings or feels that it is not being properly  treated.      =(5) Changes Proposed=    In the foregoing subsections it was sought to show how it came about  that the statute itself is not a completely satisfactory one. Some of  its provisions were adapted from earlier statutes which dealt with  \"neglected\" and \"criminal\" children, and \"industrial schools\".    In the course of the history of the legislation the age of a \"child\" has  been progressively raised from 14 to 15, to 16, to 17, and to 18 years.  Many of those dealt with would scorn to be regarded as \"children\" in the  outside world, but they are glad to have the advantages accruing from  being dealt with in a Children's Court.    It is pleasing to know that some officers of the Division are  concentrating upon preventive work, but just where, and how such work is  being done, and the effect of it cannot be measured.    The Committee makes the following recommendations for amendments to the  existing legislation:    _(a) The Creation of a New Offence_ under which children of either sex  who are guilty of indecent behaviour may be charged as \"delinquents\" in  lieu of the present procedure under which the boy must necessarily be  charged and gazetted as a criminal while the girl is not charged at all.    A suitable amending clause would be:        Every child shall be deemed to be a delinquent child within the      meaning of the Principal Act who--        (i) Being a male, carnally knows or attempts to carnally know      any female child under the age of sixteen years;        (ii) Being a female, incites or encourages a male to carnally      know her and permits or suffers him to do so;        (iii) Indecently assaults any other child.        It shall not be a defence to an information or complaint under      this section that any child consented to the act.    _(b) The Attendance of Parents at a Children's Court Should be Made  Compulsory:_ There is not at present any provision whereby the parents  of a child who commits an offence must attend Court. The provision in  section 13 (1) that the Justice may require the person having the  custody of a \"delinquent\" child to attend, with or without the child,  does not meet present needs.    The Committee therefore recommends the acceptance by the legislature of  the following new provision:        In every case in which a complaint or information is laid      against any child, or against the parent or guardian of a child,      under section 13 of the principal Act, the Justice before whom      the said complaint or information is laid shall issue his      summons to at least one of the parents of the said child or to      the guardian or other person having the custody of such child to      appear before the Children's Court with the said child.    _(c) The Court Should Have Power to Make Orders Against the Parents of  Offending or Delinquent Children:_ Suitable clauses in this connection  submitted for the consideration of the Government are:        (1) Where a child is charged with any offence for the commission      of which a fine or costs may be imposed, if the Court is of the      opinion that the case would be best met by the imposition of a      fine or costs, whether with or without any other punishment or      remedy provided by the principal Act, the Court may order that      the whole or any part of the fine or costs awarded to the      informant or complainant be paid by any parent or guardian of      such child unless the Court is satisfied that such parent or      guardian has not conduced to the commission of the offence by      neglecting to exercise due care and control of the child.        (2) In the case of a child charged with any offence the Court      may, in addition to or without entering a conviction against the      child, order that the parent or guardian give security for the      good behaviour of such child in the future for such period as to      the Court may appear just and expedient.        (3) The Court may also in its discretion make an order directing      that the children's benefit or family benefit payable to the      parent or guardian in respect of such child by the Social      Security Commission be suspended until the parent or guardian      gives the security required by the preceding subsection hereof      for such future further or other period as the Court may think      fit or until the Court is assured that the said parent or      guardian is exercising due care and control of the child.        (4) A copy of any order made in directing the suspension of the      payment of any children's benefit or family benefit shall      immediately be forwarded by the Court to the Social Security      Commission.        (5) The Court may suspend the coming into force of any such      order or may at any time terminate the period of suspension or      revoke any order made by it, whereupon the Commission of Social      Security may pay to the parent or guardian all such benefits or      allowances as would have been payable but for the order of      suspension from the date of the said suspension or from such      other date as the Court may think fair and just.        (6) Nothing herein shall be deemed to effect or limit the powers      vested in the Social Security Commission by sections 62 and 72      of the Social Security Act 1938.        (7) An order under this section may be made against"]]]
