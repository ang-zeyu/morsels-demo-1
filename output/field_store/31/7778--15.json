For God's sake, Jim, don't shoot!\"    \"Your life ain't worth a dime!\"    \"Give me one more chance an' I'll play square!\"    A swift change came over the face of Silent, and then Hardy went hot  with terror and anger. The long rider had known nothing. The gun play  had been a mere bluff, but he had played into the hands of Silent, and  now his life was truly worth nothing.    \"You poor fool,\" went on Silent, his voice purring with controlled  rage. \"You damn blind fool! D'you think you could double cross me an'  get by with it?\"    \"Give me a chance, Jim. One more chance, one more chance!\"    Even in his terror he remembered to keep his voice low lest those in  the front room should hear.    \"Out with it, if you love livin'!\"    \"I--I can't talk while you got that gun on me!\"    Silent not only lowered his gun, but actually returned it to the  holster. Nothing could more clearly indicate his contempt, and Hardy,  in spite of his fear, crimsoned with shame.    \"It was Tex Calder,\" he said at last.    Silent started a little and his eyes narrowed again.    \"What of him?\"    \"He came here a while ago an' tried to make a deal with me.\"    \"An' made it!\" said Silent ominously.    No gun pointed at him this time, but Hardy jerked his hands once more  above his head and cowered against the wall.    \"So help me God he didn't, Jim.\"    \"Get your hands down.\"    He lowered his hands slowly.    \"I told him I didn't know nothin' about you.\"    \"What about that train? What about that shipment?\"    \"It's jest the way I told you, except that it's on the eighteenth  instead of the nineteenth.\"    \"I'm goin' to believe you. If you double cross me I'll have your hide.  Maybe they'll get me, but there'll be enough of my boys left to get  you. You can lay to that. How much did they offer you, Lee? How much  am I worth to the little old U.S.A.?\"    \"I--I--it wasn't the money. I was afraid to stick with my game any  longer.\"    The long rider had already turned towards the door, making no effort  to keep his face to the agent. The latter, flushing again, moved his  hand towards his hip, but stopped the movement. The last threat of  Silent carried a deep conviction with it. He knew that the faith of  lone riders to each other was an inviolable bond. Accordingly he  followed at the heels of the other man into the outside room.    \"So long, old timer,\" he called, slapping Silent on the shoulder,  \"I'll be seein' you agin before long.\"    Calder's men looked up with curious eyes. Hardy watched Silent swing  onto his horse and gallop down the street. Then he went hurriedly  back to his office. Once inside he dropped into the big swivel-chair,  buried his face in his arms, and wept like a child.          CHAPTER XII      PARTNERS    Dust powdered his hat and clothes as Tex Calder trotted his horse  north across the hills. His face was a sickly grey, and his black  hair might have been an eighteenth century wig, so thoroughly was it  disguised. It had been a long ride. Many a long mile wound back behind  him, and still the cattle pony, with hanging head, stuck to its task.  Now he was drawing out on a highland, and below him stretched the  light yellow-green of the willows of the bottom land. He halted his  pony and swung a leg over the horn of his saddle. Then he rolled a  cigarette, and while he inhaled it in long puffs he scanned the trees  narrowly. Miles across, and stretching east and west farther than his  eye could reach, extended the willows. Somewhere in that wilderness  was the gang of Jim Silent. An army corps might have been easily  concealed there.    If he was not utterly discouraged in the beginning of his search, it  was merely because the rangers of the hills and plains are taught  patience almost as soon as they learn to ride a horse. He surveyed the  yellow-green forest calmly. In the west the low hanging sun turned  crimson and bulged at the sides into a clumsy elipse. He started down  the slope at the same dog-trot which the pony had kept up all day.  Just before he reached the skirts of the trees he brought his horse to  a sudden halt and threw back his head. It seemed to him that he heard  a faint whistling.    He could not be sure. It was so far off and unlike any whistling he  had ever heard before, that he half guessed it to be the movement of a  breeze through the willows, but the wind was hardly strong enough to  make this sound. For a full five minutes he listened without moving  his horse. Then came the thing for which he waited, a phrase of melody  undoubtedly from human lips.    What puzzled him most was the nature of the music. As he rode closer  to the trees it grew clearer. It was unlike any song he had ever  heard. It was a strange improvisation with a touch of both melancholy  and savage exultation running through it. Calder found himself nodding  in sympathy with the irregular rhythm.    It grew so clear at last that he marked with some accuracy the  direction from which it came. If this was Silent's camp, it must be  strongly guarded, and he should approach the place more cautiously  than he could possibly do on a horse. Accordingly he dismounted, threw  the reins over the pony's head, and started on through the willows.  The whistling became louder and louder. He moved stealthily from tree  to tree, for he had not the least idea when he would run across a  guard. The whistling ceased, but the marshal was now so near that he  could follow the original direction without much trouble. In a few  moments he might distinguish the sound of voices. If there were two or  three men in the camp he might be able to surprise them and make his  arrest. If the outlaws were many, at least he could lie low near  the camp and perhaps learn the plans of the gang. He worked his way  forward more and more carefully. At one place he thought a shadowy  figure slipped through the brush a short distance away. He poised his  gun, but lowered it again after a moment's thought. It must have  been a stir of shadows. No human being could move so swiftly or so  noiselessly.    Nevertheless the sight gave him such a start that he proceeded with  even greater caution. He was crouched close to the ground. Every inch  of it he scanned carefully before he set down a foot, fearful of the  cracking of a fallen twig. Like most men when they hunt, he began to  feel that something followed him. He tried to argue the thought out of  his brain, but it persisted, and grew stronger. Half a dozen times he  whirled suddenly with his revolver poised. At last he heard a stamp  which could come from nothing but the hoof of a horse. The sound  dispelled his fears. In another moment he would be in sight of the  camp.    \"Do you figger you'll find it?\" asked a quiet voice behind him.    He turned and looked into the steady muzzle of a Colt. Behind that  revolver was a thin, handsome face with a lock of jet black hair  falling over the forehead. Calder knew men, and now he felt a strange  absence of any desire to attempt a gun-play.    \"I was just taking a stroll through the willows,\" he said, with a  mighty attempt at carelessness.    \"Oh,\" said the other. \"It appeared to me you was sort of huntin' for  something. You was headed straight for my hoss.\"    Calder strove to find some way out. He could not. There was no waver  in the hand that held that black gun. The brown eyes were decidedly  discouraging to any attempt at a surprise. He felt helpless for the  first time in his career.    \"Go over to him, Bart,\" said the gentle voice of the stranger. \"Stand  fast!\"    The last two words, directed to Calder came, with a metallic hardness,  for the marshal started as a great black dog slipped from behind a  tree and slunk towards him. This was the shadow which moved more  swiftly and noiselessly than a human being.    \"Keep back that damned wolf,\" he said desperately.    \"He ain't goin' to hurt you,\" said the calm voice. \"Jest toss your gun  to the ground.\"    There was nothing else for it. Calder dropped his weapon with the butt  towards Whistling Dan.    \"Bring it here, Bart,\" said the latter.    The big animal lowered his head, still keeping his green eyes upon  Calder, took up the revolver in his white fangs, and glided back to  his master.    \"Jest turn your back to me, an' keep your hands clear of your body,\"  said Dan.    Calder obeyed, sweating with shame. He felt a hand pat his pockets  lightly in search for a hidden weapon, and then, with his head  slightly turned, he sensed the fact that Dan was dropping his revolver  into its holster. He whirled and drove his clenched fist straight at  Dan's face.    What happened then he would never forget to the end of his life.  Calder's weapon still hung in Dan's right hand, but the latter made no  effort to use it. He dropped the gun, and as Calder's right arm shot  out, it was caught at the wrist, and jerked down with a force that  jarred his whole body.    \"Down, Bart!\" shouted Dan. The great wolf checked in the midst of his  leap and dropped, whining with eagerness, at Calder's feet. At the  same time the marshal's left hand was seized and whipped across his  body. He wrenched away with all his force. He might as well have  struggled with steel manacles. He was helpless, staring into eyes  which now glinted with a yellow light that sent a cold wave tingling  through his blood.    The yellow gleam died; his hands were loosed; but he made no move to  spring at Dan's throat. Chill horror had taken the place of his shame,  and the wolf-dog still whined at his feet with lips grinned back from  the long white teeth.    \"Who in the name of God are you?\" he gasped, and even as he spoke  the truth came to him--the whistling--the panther-like speed of  hand--\"Whistling Dan Barry.\"    The other frowned.    \"If you didn't know my name why were you trailin' me?\"    \"I wasn't after you,\" said Calder.    \"You was crawlin' along like that jest for fun? Friend, I figger to  know you. You been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10890"],[0,"Dio's Rome, Volume 5 (#15)"],[1," I should refuse on account of one single man  to embroil the Roman people and cause so great a mass of human beings to  perish. I certainly should prefer to be a Mucius, a Decius, a Curtius, a  Regulus, rather than a Marius, a Cinna, or a Sulla,--not to mention other  names. Therefore do not force me to become one of these men I hate, nor  grudge me the privilege of imitating one of those whom I commend. Do you  depart to meet the conqueror and do him reverence. As for me, I shall find  means to free myself, that all men may be taught by the event that you  have chosen such an emperor as has not given you up to save himself but  himself to save you.\"    [Sidenote:--14--] Of this nature were the words of Otho. Falling upon the  ears of the soldiers they aroused both admiration of the man and pity for  what might befall him: his troops shed tears of lamentation and mourning,  calling him father and terming him dearer than children and parents.  [\"Upon thee our lives depend,\" they said, \"and for thee we will all die.\"]  This argument continued so for most of the day, Otho begging to be allowed  to die and the soldiers refusing to permit him to carry out his wish.  Finally, he reduced them to silence and said: \"It can not be that I should  show myself inferior to this soldier, whom you have seen kill himself for  the single reason that he had borne news of defeat to his own emperor. I  shall certainly follow in his footsteps, that I may cease to see or hear  aught any longer. And you, if you love me in reality, let me die as I  desire and do not compel me to live against my will, but take your way to  the victor and gain his good graces.\"    [Sidenote:--15--] At the close of this speech he retired into his  apartments and after sending some messages to his intimate friends and  some to Vitellius in their behalf he burned all the letters which anybody  had written to him containing hostile statements about Vitellius, not  wanting them to serve as damaging evidence against anybody. Then he called  each one of the persons that were at hand, greeted them, and gave them  money. Meantime there was a disturbance made by the soldiers, so that he  was obliged to go out and quiet them, and he did not come back until he  had sent them to a place of safety, some here, some there. So then, when  quiet had been permanently restored, taking a short sword he killed  himself. The grief-stricken soldiery took up his body and buried it, and  some slew themselves upon his grave. This was the end that befell Otho,  after he had lived thirty-seven years lacking eleven days and had reigned  ninety days, and it overshadowed the impiety and wickedness of his active  career. In life the basest of men he died most nobly. He had seized the  empire by the most villainous trick, but took leave of it most creditably.    A series of brawls among the soldiers immediately ensued, and a number of  them were slain by one another; afterwards they reached an agreement and  set out to meet the victorious party.          DIO'S ROMAN HISTORY  65    Vitellius is proclaimed emperor: feasts his eyes on gladiators and  slaughters: drives astrologers from Italy (chapter 1).    Vitellius's excess in banquets, in his home, in furniture, in his almost  absurd magnificence (chapters 2-5).    Praiseworthy points in his character (chapters 6, 7).    Portents of ill omen: the soldiers declare Vespasian emperor (chapter 8).    Mucianus is sent by Vespasian against Vitellius: Primus of his own accord  takes the lead against Vitellius (chapter 9).    Alienus, put in charge of the war by Vitellius, is the author of a  desertion, but is in turn seized by his followers, who change their minds  (chapter 10).    The adherents of Vitellius are conquered in battle (chapters 11-14).    Catastrophe befalls the dwellers in Cremona (chapter 15).    Wavering on the part of Vitellius: the Capitol is burned in the course of  a siege by Sabinus (chapters 16, 17).    Disaster to the city of Rome, taken by Vespasian's captains (chapters 18,  19).    How Vitellius was taken and perished (chapters 20, 21).    How a brother and son of Vitellius met their fate (chapter 22).      DURATION OF TIME.    (Galba (II) and T. Vinius Coss.): A.D. 69 = a.u. 822, from January 15th.  The following _Consules Suffecti_ took office:    On the Calends of March--T. Virginius Rufus, Vopiscus Pompeius.    On the Calends of May--Caelius Sabinus, T. Flavins Sabinus.    On the Calends of July--T. Arrius Antoninus, P. Marius Celsus (II).    On the Calends of September--C. Fabius Valens, A. Alienus Caecinna (also  Roscius Regulus, as Caecinna was condemned on the last day of October).    On the Calends of November--Cn. Caecilius Simplex, C. Quintius Atticus.      [Sidenote: A.D. 69 (a.u. 822)] [Sidenote:--1--] The population of Rome  when it heard of the downfall of Otho naturally transferred its allegiance  immediately. Otho, whom people previously praised and for whose victory  they prayed, they now abused as an enemy, and Vitellius, upon whom they  had been invoking curses, they praised and declared emperor. So truly  there is nothing constant in human affairs. Those who flourish most and  those who are lowliest alike choose unstable standards, and construct  their praises and their censures, their honors and their degradations to  conform to the accidents of their situation.    News of the death of Otho was brought to him [Vitellius] while in Gaul.  There he was joined by his wife and child, whom he placed on a platform  and saluted as Germanicus and imperator, though the boy was only six years  old.    [Vitellius witnessed gladiatorial combats at Lugdunum and again at  Cremona, as if the crowds of men who had perished in the battles and were  even then exposed unburied to the elements did not suffice. He beheld the  slain with his own eyes, for he traversed all the ground where they lay  and gloated over the spectacle as if he were still in the moment of  victory; and not even after that did he order them to be buried.] Upon  reaching Rome and adjusting affairs to suit him, he issued a bulletin  banishing the astrologers and commanding them by this particular day  (mentioning a given date) to leave the whole country of Italy. They by  night put up in turn another document, in which they announced that he  should lose his life by the day on which he actually died. So accurate was  their previous knowledge of what should come to pass.    [Sidenote:--2--] Vitellius was fond of luxury and licentiousness and cared  for nothing else human or divine. He had always been the kind of man that  would spend his time in taverns and gaming houses, over dancers and  charioteers. Incalculable were the sums he spent on such pursuits, and the  consequence was that he had many creditors. Now, when he attained to so  great authority, his wantonness only increased, and his expenditures went  on most of the day and night alike. He was insatiate in filling himself,  yet kept constantly vomiting what he ate, apparently living on the mere  passage of food. Yet that was what enabled him to hold out; for his fellow  banqueters fared very badly. [He was always inviting numbers of the  foremost men to his table and he was frequently entertained at their  houses.]    [Sidenote:--3--] On this point one of them, Vibius Crispus, [Footnote:  _Q. Vibius Crispus._] was the author of a most witty remark. Having been  compelled for some days by sickness to absent himself from the convivial  board, he said: \"If I had not fallen ill, I should certainly have died.\"  The entire period of his reign consisted in nothing but carousals and  revels. All the most valuable food products were brought together from the  ocean itself (not to go farther) from the earth and from the  Mediterranean, and were prepared in so costly a fashion that even now some  cakes and other dishes are named Vitellian, after him. Why should one go  into the details of these affairs? It is admitted by quite everybody that  during the period of his reign he expended on dinners two hundred million  two thousand five hundred denarii. There came very near being a famine in  all costly articles of food, yet it was imperative that they should be  provided. Once he had a dish made that cost twenty-five myriads, into  which he put a mixture of tongues and brains and livers of fish and  certain kinds of birds. As it was impossible to make so large a vessel of  pottery, it was made of silver and remained extant for some time, regarded  somewhat in the light of a votive offering, until Hadrian finally set eyes  on it and had it melted down.    [Sidenote:--4--] Since I have mentioned this fact, I will also add  another, namely that not even Nero's Golden House would satisfy Vitellius.  He delighted in and commended the name and the life and all the practices  of its former owner, yet he found fault with the structure itself, saying  that it had been badly built and was scantily and meanly equipped. When he  fell ill one time he looked about for a room to afford him an abode; so  little did even Nero's surroundings satisfy him. His wife Galeria  ridiculed the small amount of decoration found in the royal apartments.  This pair, as they spent other people's money, never stopped to count the  cost of anything; but those who invited them to meals found themselves in  great trouble [save a few whom he compensated for it]. Yet the same  persons would not regularly entertain him the entire day, but one set of  men furnished breakfast, another lunch, another dinner, and still another  certain viands for dessert calculated to stimulate a jaded appetite.  [Footnote: This little phrase is taken direct from Plato's  _Critias_, 115 B.] [For all who were able were eager to entertain him.]  It is said that after the elapse of a few days he spent a hundred myriads  upon a dinner. [His birthday celebration lasted over two days and numbers  of beasts and of men were slain.]    [Sidenote:--6--] [Though his"]]]
