Vaschide and Van Melle (Paris Academy of      Sciences, December 26, 1899) have, again, argued that smell is      produced by rays of short wave-lengths, analogous to light-rays,      Roentgen rays, etc. Chemical action is however, a very important      factor in the production of odors; this has been well shown by      Ayrton (_Nature_, September 8, 1898). We seem to be forced in the      direction of a chemico-vibratory theory, as pointed out by      Southerden (_Nature_, March 26, 1903), the olfactory cells being      directly stimulated, not by the ordinary vibrations of the      molecules, but by the agitations accompanying chemical changes.        The vibratory hypothesis of the action of odors has had some      influence on the recent physiologists who have chiefly occupied      themselves with olfaction. \"It is probable,\" Zwaardemaker writes      (_L'Annee Psychologique_, 1898), \"that aroma is a      physico-chemical attribute of the molecules\"; he points out that      there is an intimate analogy between color and odor, and remarks      that this analogy leads us to suppose in an aroma ether      vibrations of which the period is determined by the structure of      the molecule.        Since the physiology of olfaction is yet so obscure it is not      surprising that we have no thoroughly scientific classification      of smells, notwithstanding various ambitious attempts to reach a      classification. The classification adopted by Zwaardemaker is      founded on the ancient scheme of Linnaeus, and may here be      reproduced:--        I. Ethereal odors (chiefly esters; Rimmel's fruity series).        II. Aromatic odors (terpenes, camphors, and the spicy,      herbaceous, rosaceous, and almond series; the chemical types are      well determined: cineol, eugenol, anethol, geraniol,      benzaldehyde).        III. The balsamic odors (chiefly aldehydes, Rimmel's jasmin,      violet, and balsamic series, with the chemical types: terpineol,      ionone, vanillin).        IV. The ambrosiacal odors (ambergris and musk).        V. The alliaceous odors, with the cacodylic group (asafoetida,      ichthyol, etc.).        VI. Empyreumatic odors.        VII. Valerianaceous odors (Linnaeus's _Odores hircini_, the capryl      group, largely composed of sexual odors).        VIII. Narcotic odors (Linnaeus's _Odores tetri_).        IX. Stenches.        A valuable and interesting memoir, \"Revue Generale sur les      Sensations Olfactives,\" by J. Passy, the chief French authority      on this subject, will be found in the second volume of _L'Annee      Psychologique_, 1895. In the fifth issue of the same year-book      (for 1898) Zwaardemaker presents a full summary of his work and      views, \"Les Sensations Olfactives, leurs Combinaisons et leurs      Compensations.\" A convenient, but less authoritative, summary of      the facts of normal and pathological olfaction will be found in a      little volume of the \"Actualites Medicales\" series by Dr. Collet,      _L'Odorat et ses Troubles_, 1904. In a little book entitled      _Wegweiser zu einer Psychologie des Geruches_ (1894) Giessler has      sought to outline a psychology of smell, but his sketch can only      be regarded as tentative and provisional.    At the outset, nevertheless, it seems desirable that we should at least  have some conception of the special characteristics which mark the great  and varied mass of sensations reaching the brain through the channel of  the olfactory organ. The main special character of olfactory images seems  to be conditioned by the fact that they are intermediate in character  between those of touch or taste and those of sight or sound, that they  have much of the vagueness of the first and something of the richness and  variety of the second. AEsthetically, also, they occupy an intermediate  position between the higher and the lower senses.[26] They are, at the  same time, less practically useful than either the lower or the higher  senses. They furnish us with a great mass of what we may call  by-sensations, which are of little practical use, but inevitably become  intimately mixed with the experiences of life by association and thus  acquire an emotional significance which is often very considerable. Their  emotional force, it may well be, is connected with the fact that their  anatomical seat is the most ancient part of the brain. They lie in a  remote almost disused storehouse of our minds and show the fascination or  the repulsiveness of all vague and remote things. It is for this reason  that they are--to an extent that is remarkable when we consider that they  are much more precise than touch sensations--subject to the influence of  emotional associations. The very same odor may be at one moment highly  pleasant, at the next moment highly unpleasant, in accordance with the  emotional attitude resulting from its associations. Visual images have no  such extreme flexibility; they are too definite to be so easily  influenced. Our feelings about the beauty of a flower cannot oscillate so  easily or so far as may our feelings about the agreeableness of its odor.  Our olfactory experiences thus institute a more or less continuous series  of by-sensations accompanying us through life, of no great practical  significance, but of considerable emotional significance from their  variety, their intimacy, their associational facility, their remote  ancestral reverberations through our brains.    It is the existence of these characteristics--at once so vague and so  specific, so useless and so intimate--which led various writers to  describe the sense of smell as, above all others, the sense of  imagination. No sense has so strong a power of suggestion, the power of  calling up ancient memories with a wider and deeper emotional  reverberation, while at the same time no sense furnishes impressions which  so easily change emotional color and tone, in harmony with the recipient's  general attitude. Odors are thus specially apt both to control the  emotional life and to become its slaves. With the use of incense religions  have utilized the imaginative and symbolical virtues of fragrance. All the  legends of the saints have insisted on the odor of sanctity that exhales  from the bodies of holy persons, especially at the moment of death. Under  the conditions of civilization these primitive emotional associations of  odor tend to be dispersed, but, on the other hand, the imaginative side of  the olfactory sense becomes accentuated, and personal idiosyncrasies of  all kinds tend to manifest themselves in the sphere of smell.        Rousseau (in _Emile_, Bk. II) regarded smell as the sense of the      imagination. So, also, at an earlier period, it was termed      (according to Cloquet) by Cardano. Cloquet frequently insisted on      the qualities of odors which cause them to appeal to the      imagination; on their irregular and inconstant character; on      their power of intoxicating the mind on some occasions; on the      curious individual and racial preferences in the matter of odors.      He remarked on the fact that the Persians employed asafoetida as      a seasoning, while valerian was accounted a perfume in antiquity.      (Cloquet, _Osphresiologie_, pp. 28, 45, 71, 112.) It may be      added, as a curious example familiar to most people of the      dependence of the emotional tone of a smell on its associations,      that, while the exhalations of other people's bodies are      ordinarily disagreeable to us, such is not the case with our own;      this is expressed in the crude and vigorous dictum of the      Elizabethan poet, Marston, \"Every man's dung smell sweet i' his      own nose.\" There are doubtless many implications, moral as well      as psychological, in that statement.        The modern authorities on olfaction, Passy and Zwaardemaker, both      alike insist on the same characteristics of the sense of smell:      its extreme acuity and yet its vagueness. \"We live in a world of      odor,\" Zwaardemaker remarks (_L'Annee Psychologique_, 1898, p.      203), \"as we live in a world of light and of sound. But smell      yields us no distinct ideas grouped in regular order, still less      that are fixed in the memory as a grammatical discipline.      Olfactory sensations awake vague and half-understood perceptions,      which are accompanied by very strong emotion. The emotion      dominates us, but the sensation which was the cause of it remains      unperceived.\" Even in the same individual there are wide      variations in the sensitiveness to odors at different times, more      especially as regards faint odors; Passy (_L'Annee      Psychologique_, 1895, p. 387) brings forward some observations on      this point.        Maudsley noted the peculiarly suggestive power of odors; \"there      are certain smells,\" he remarked, \"which never fail to bring back      to me instantly and visibly scenes of my boyhood\"; many of us      could probably say the same. Another writer (E. Dillon, \"A      Neglected Sense,\" _Nineteenth Century_, April, 1894) remarks that      \"no sense has a stronger power of suggestion.\"        Ribot has made an interesting investigation as to the prevalence      and nature of the emotional memory of odors (_Psychology of the      Emotions_, Chapter XI). By \"emotional memory\" is meant the      spontaneous or voluntary revivability of the image, olfactory or      other. (For the general question, see an article by F. Pillon,      \"La Memoire Affective, son Importance Theorique et Pratique,\"      _Revue Philosophique_, February, 1901; also Paulhan, \"Sur la      Memoire Affective,\" _Revue Philosophique_, December, 1902 and      January, 1903.) Ribot found that 40 per cent. of persons are      unable to revive any such images of taste or smell; 48 per cent,      could revive some; 12 per cent, declared themselves capable of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#15)"],[1,"M. de Breot, whom he shortly after encounters, he exclaims,      abashed at his own actions: \"Why did I not flee? But could I      imagine that the spectacle of so disgusting a function would have      any other effect than to give me a humble opinion of human      nature?\" M. de Breot, however, in proceeding to reproach his      interlocutor for his inconsiderate temerity, observes: \"What you      tell me, sir, does not entirely surprise me. Nature has placed      very various instincts within us, and the impulse that led you to      what you have just now done is not so peculiar as you think. One      may be a very estimable man and yet love women even in what is      lowliest in their bodies.\" In harmony with this passage from      Regnier's novel are the remarks of a correspondent who writes to      me of the function of urination that it \"appeals sexually to most      normal individuals. My own observations and inquiries prove this.      Women themselves instinctively feel it. The secrecy surrounding      the matter lends, too, I think, a sexual interest.\"        The fact that scatalogic processes may in some degree exert an      attraction even in normal love has been especially emphasized by      Bloch (_Beitraege zur AEtiologie der Psychopathia Sexualis_, Teil      II, pp. 222, et seq.): \"The man whose intellect and aesthetic      sense has been 'clouded by the sexual impulse' sees these things      in an entirely different light from him who has not been overcome      by the intoxication of love. For him they are idealized (sit      venia verbo) since they are a part of the beloved person, and in      consequence associated with love.\" Bloch quotes the _Memoiren      einer Saengerin_ (a book which is said to be, though this seems      doubtful, genuinely autobiographical) in the same sense: \"A man      who falls in love with a girl is not dragged out of his poetic      sphere by the thought that his beloved must relieve certain      natural necessities every day. It seems, indeed, to him to be      just the opposite. If one loves a person one finds nothing      obscene or disgusting in the object that pleases me.\" The      opposite attitude is probably in extreme cases due to the      influence of a neurotic or morbidly sensitive temperament. Swift      possessed such a temperament. The possession of a similar      temperament is doubtless responsible for the little prose poem,      \"L'Extase,\" in which Huysmans in his first book, _Le Drageloir a      Epices_, has written an attenuated version of \"Strephon and      Chloe\" to express the disillusionment of love; the lover lies in      a wood clasping the hand of the beloved with rapturous emotion;      \"suddenly she rose, disengaged her hand, disappeared in the      bushes, and I heard as it were the rustling of rain on the      leaves.\" His dream has fled.    In estimating the significance of the lover's attitude in this matter, it  is important to realize the position which scatologic conceptions took in  primitive belief. At certain stages of early culture, when all the  emanations of the body are liable to possess mysterious magic properties  and become apt for sacred uses, the excretions, and especially the urine,  are found to form part of religious ritual and ceremonial function. Even  among savages the excreta are frequently regarded as disgusting, but under  the influence of these conceptions such disgust is inhibited, and those  emanations of the body which are usually least honored become religious  symbols.        Urine has been regarded as the original holy water, and many      customs which still survive in Italy and various parts of Europe,      involving the use of a fluid which must often be yellow and      sometimes salt, possibly indicate the earlier use of urine. (The      Greek water of aspersion, according to Theocritus, was mixed      with salt, as is sometimes the modern Italian holy water. J.J.      Blunt, _Vestiges of Ancient Manners and Customs_, p. 173.) Among      the Hottentots, as Kolbein and others have recorded, the medicine      man urinated alternately on bride and bridegroom, and a      successful young warrior was sprinkled in the same way. Mungo      Park mentions that in Africa on one occasion a bride sent a bowl      of her urine which was thrown over him as a special mark of honor      to a distinguished guest. Pennant remarked that the Highlanders      sprinkled their cattle with urine, as a kind of holy water, on      the first Monday in every quarter. (Bourke, _Scatalogic Rites_,      pp. 228, 239; Brand, _Popular Antiquities_, \"Bride-Ales.\")        Even the excreta of animals have sometimes been counted sacred.      This is notably so in the case of the cow, of all animals the      most venerated by primitive peoples, and especially in India.      Jules Bois (_Visions de l'Inde_, p. 86) describes the spectacle      presented in the temple of the cows at Benares: \"I put my head      into the opening of the holy stables. It was the largest of      temples, a splendor of precious stones and marble, where the      venerated heifers passed backwards and forwards. A whole people      adored them. They take no notice, plunged in their divine and      obscure unconsciousness. And they fulfil with serenity their      animal functions; they chew the offerings, drink water from      copper vessels, and when they are filled they relieve themselves.      Then a stercoraceous and religious insanity overcomes these      starry-faced women and venerable men; they fall on their knees,      prostrate themselves, eat the droppings, greedily drink the      liquid, which for them is miraculous and sacred.\" (Cf. Bourke,      _Scatalogic Rites_, Chapter XVII.)        Among the Chevsurs of the Caucasus, perhaps an Iranian people, a      woman after her confinement, for which she lives apart, purifies      herself by washing in the urine of a cow and then returns home.      This mode of purification is recommended in the Avesta, and is      said to be used by the few remaining followers of this creed.    We have not only to take into account the frequency with which among  primitive peoples the excretions possess a religious significance. It is  further to be noted that in the folk-lore of modern Europe we everywhere  find plentiful evidence of the earlier prevalence of legends and practices  of a scatalogical character. It is significant that in the majority of  cases it is easy to see a sexual reference in these stories and customs.  The legends have lost their earlier and often mythical significance, and  frequently take on a suggestion of obscenity, while the scatalogical  practices have become the magical devices of lovelorn maidens or forsaken  wives practiced in secrecy. It has happened to scatalogical rites to be  regarded as we may gather from the _Clouds_ of Aristophanes, that the  sacred leathern phallus borne by the women in the Bacchanalia was becoming  in his time, an object to arouse the amusement of little boys.        Among many primitive peoples throughout the world, and among the      lower social classes of civilized peoples, urine possesses magic      properties, more especially, it would seem, the urine of women      and that of people who stand, or wish to stand, in sexual      relationship to each other. In a legend of the Indians of the      northwest coast of America, recorded by Boas, a woman gives her      lover some of her urine and says: \"You can wake the dead if you      drop some of my urine in their ears and nose.\" (_Zeitschrift fuer      Ethnologie_, 1894, Heft IV, p. 293.) Among the same Indians there      is a legend of a woman with a beautiful white skin who found on      bathing every morning in the river that the fish were attracted      to her skin and could not be driven off even by magical      solutions. At last she said to herself: \"I will make water on      them and then they will leave me alone.\" She did so, and      henceforth the fish left her. But shortly after fire came from      Heaven and killed her. (Ib., 1891, Heft V, p. 640.) Among both      Christians and Mohammedans a wife can attach an unfaithful      husband by privately putting some of her urine in his drink. (B.      Stern, _Medizin in der Tuerkei_, vol. ii, p. 11.) This practice is      world-wide; thus among the aborigines of Brazil, according to      Martius, the urine and other excretions and secretions are potent      for aphrodisiacal objects. (Bourke's _Scatalogic Rites of All      Nations_ contains many references to the folk-lore practices in      this matter; a study of popular beliefs in the magic power of      urine, published in Bombay by Professor Eugen Wilhelm in 1889, I      have not seen.)        The legends which narrate scatalogic exploits are numerous in the      literature of all countries. Among primitive peoples they often      have a purely theological character, for in the popular      mythologies of all countries (even, as we learn from      Aristophanes, among the Greeks) natural phenomena such as the      rain, are apt to be regarded as divine excretions, but in course      of time the legends take on a more erotic or a more obscene      character. In the Irish _Book of Leinster_ (written down      somewhere about the twelfth century, but containing material of      very much older date) we are told how a number of princesses in      Emain Macha, the seat of the Ulster Kings, resolved to find out      which of them could by urinating on it melt a snow pillar which      the men had made, the woman who succeeded to be regarded as the      best among them. None of them succeeded, and they sent for      Derbforgaill, who was in love with Cuchullain, and she was able      to melt the pillar; whereupon the other women, jealous of the      superiority she had thus shown, tore out her eyes.
