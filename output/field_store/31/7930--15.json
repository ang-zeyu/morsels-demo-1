The _text-books_  have been so arranged and simplified that _Self-instruction_ is  a positive pleasure and recreation and _has been successfully  accomplished in thousands of instances_.    TEACHERS should learn Phonography, not only that they may be possessed  of the enormous advantage of being able to write five times as fast  as by the ordinary method, but that they may be able to teach the art.  Phonography is rapidly finding its way into the Public Schools, and  the demand for teachers of the regular branches who can also teach  Phonography is now _far in advance of the supply_.    THE MANUAL OF PHONOGRAPHY. [200th Thousand.] By BENN PITMAN and  JEROME B. HOWARD. This work is designed for self-instruction in the  phonographic art and is the proper book for the beginner. It contains  a complete exposition of the system, from its simplest principles  to the Reporting Style, arranged in alternate and opposite pages of  explanation and phonographic exercises. Every principle is copiously  illustrated with engraved examples for reading, and exercises in  the ordinary type for writing practice. A large number of pages of  engraved reading matter are included in the book. Boards, 80c.; Extra  cloth, $1.00.    For sale by all booksellers, or sent post-paid by us on receipt of  price.

The boy was sitting on the damp ground with his back to the wall. He  gave her no answer.    \"Come,\" she said, bending over him, \"I have been looking for you all  day.\"    He mumbled something.    \"You have had nothing to eat. I have put some supper in your room. You  must come home with me, Waldo.\"    She took his hand, and the boy rose slowly.    She made him take her arm, and twisted her small fingers among his.    \"You must forget,\" she whispered. \"Since it happened I walk, I talk,  I never sit still. If we remember, we cannot bring back the dead.\" She  knit her little fingers closer among his. \"Forgetting is the best thing.  He did watch it coming,\" she whispered presently. \"That is the dreadful  thing, to see it coming!\" She shuddered. \"I want it to come so to me  too. Why do you think I was driving that bird?\" she added quickly. \"That  was Hans, the bird that hates Bonaparte. I let him out this afternoon; I  thought he would chase him and perhaps kill him.\"    The boy showed no sign of interest.    \"He did not catch him; but he put his head over the half-door of your  cabin and frightened him horribly. He was there, busy stealing your  things. Perhaps he will leave them alone now; but I wish the bird had  trodden on him.\"    They said no more till they reached the door of the cabin.    \"There is a candle and supper on the table. You must eat,\" she said  authoritatively. \"I cannot stay with you now, lest they find out about  the bird.\"    He grasped her arm and brought his mouth close to her ear.    \"There is no God!\" he almost hissed; \"no God; not anywhere!\"    She started.    \"Not anywhere!\"    He ground it out between his teeth, and she felt his hot breath on her  cheek.    \"Waldo, you are mad,\" she said, drawing herself from him, instinctively.    He loosened his grasp and turned away from her also.    In truth, is it not life's way? We fight our little battles alone; you  yours, I mine. We must not help or find help.    When your life is most real, to me you are mad; when your agony is  blackest, I look at you and wonder. Friendship is good, a strong stick;  but when the hour comes to lean hard, it gives. In the day of their  bitterest need all souls are alone.    Lyndall stood by him in the dark, pityingly, wonderingly. As he walked  to the door, she came after him.    \"Eat your supper; it will do you good,\" she said.    She rubbed her cheek against his shoulder and then ran away.    In the front room the little woolly Kaffer girl was washing Tant  Sannie's feet in a small tub, and Bonaparte, who sat on the wooden  sofa, was pulling off his shoes and stockings that his own feet might  be washed also. There were three candles burning in the room, and he and  Tant Sannie sat close together, with the lean Hottentot not far off; for  when ghosts are about much light is needed, there is great strength  in numbers. Bonaparte had completely recovered from the effects of his  fright in the afternoon, and the numerous doses of brandy that it had  been necessary to administer to him to effect his restoration had put  him into a singularly pleasant and amiable mood.    \"That boy Waldo,\" said Bonaparte, rubbing his toes, \"took himself off  coolly this morning as soon as the wagon came, and has not done a stiver  of work all day. I'll not have that kind of thing now I'm master of this  farm.\"    The Hottentot maid translated.    \"Ah, I expect he's sorry that his father's dead,\" said Tant Sannie.  \"It's nature, you know. I cried the whole morning when my father died.  One can always get another husband, but one can't get another father,\"  said Tant Sannie, casting a sidelong glance at Bonaparte.    Bonaparte expressed a wish to give Waldo his orders for the next day's  work, and accordingly the little woolly-headed Kaffer was sent to  call him. After a considerable time the boy appeared, and stood in the  doorway.    If they had dressed him in one of the swallow-tailed coats, and oiled  his hair till the drops fell from it, and it lay as smooth as an elder's  on sacrament Sunday, there would still have been something unanointed in  the aspect of the fellow. As it was, standing there in his strange old  costume, his head presenting much the appearance of having been deeply  rolled in sand, his eyelids swollen, the hair hanging over his  forehead, and a dogged sullenness on his features, he presented most the  appearance of an ill-conditioned young buffalo.    \"Beloved Lord,\" cried Tant Sannie, \"how he looks! Come in, boy. Couldn't  you come and say good-day to me? Don't you want some supper?\"    He said he wanted nothing, and turned his heavy eyes away from her.    \"There's a ghost been seen in your father's room,\" said Tant Sannie. \"If  you're afraid you can sleep in the kitchen.\"    \"I will sleep in our room,\" said the boy slowly.    \"Well, you can go now,\" she said; \"but be up early to take the sheep.  The herd--\"    \"Yes, be up early, my boy,\" interrupted Bonaparte, smiling. \"I am to  be master of this farm now; and we shall be good friends, I trust, very  good friends, if you try to do your duty, my dear boy.\"    Waldo turned to go, and Bonaparte, looking benignly at the candle,  stretched out one unstockinged foot, over which Waldo, looking at  nothing in particular, fell with a heavy thud upon the floor.    \"Dear me! I hope you are not hurt, my boy,\" said Bonaparte. \"You'll have  many a harder thing than that though, before you've gone through life,\"  he added consolingly, as Waldo picked himself up.    The lean Hottentot laughed till the room rang again; and Tant Sannie  tittered till her sides ached.    When he had gone the little maid began to wash Bonaparte's feet.    \"Oh, Lord, beloved Lord, how he did fall! I can't think of it,\" cried  Tant Sannie, and she laughed again. \"I always did know he was not right;  but this evening any one could see it,\" she added, wiping the tears of  mirth from her face. \"His eyes are as wild as if the devil was in them.  He never was like other children. The dear Lord knows, if he doesn't  walk alone for hours talking to himself. If you sit in the room with  him you can see his lips moving the whole time; and if you talk to him  twenty times he doesn't hear you. Daft-eyes; he's as mad as mad can be.\"    This repetition of the word mad conveyed meaning to Bonaparte's mind. He  left off paddling his toes in the water.    \"Mad, mad? I know that kind of mad,\" said Bonaparte, \"and I know the  thing to give for it. The front end of a little horsewhip, the tip! Nice  thing; takes it out,\" said Bonaparte.    The Hottentot laughed, and translated.    \"No more walking about and talking to themselves on this farm now,\" said  Bonaparte; \"no more minding of sheep and reading of books at the same  time. The point of a horsewhip is a little thing, but I think he'll  have a taste of it before long.\" Bonaparte rubbed his hands and looked  pleasantly across his nose; and then the three laughed together grimly.    And Waldo in his cabin crouched in the dark in a corner, with his knees  drawn up to his chin.        Chapter 1.X. He Shows His Teeth.    Doss sat among the karoo bushes, one yellow ear drawn over his wicked  little eye, ready to flap away any adventurous fly that might settle on  his nose. Around him in the morning sunlight fed the sheep; behind him  lay his master polishing his machine. He found much comfort in handling  it that morning. A dozen philosophical essays, or angelically atuned  songs for the consolation of the bereaved, could never have been to him  what that little sheep-shearing machine was that day.    After struggling to see the unseeable, growing drunk with the endeavour  to span the infinite, and writhing before the inscrutable mystery, it  is a renovating relief to turn to some simple, feelable, weighable  substance; to something which has a smell and a colour, which may be  handled and turned over this way and that. Whether there be or be not  a hereafter, whether there be any use in calling aloud to the Unseen  power, whether there be an Unseen power to call to, whatever be the true  nature of the \"I\" who call and of the objects around me, whatever be  our meaning, our internal essence, our cause (and in a certain order of  minds death and the agony of loss inevitably awaken the wild desire,  at other times smothered, to look into these things), whatever be the  nature of that which lies beyond the unbroken wall which the limits of  the human intellect build up on every hand, this thing is certain--a  knife will cut wood, and one cogged wheel will turn another. This is  sure.    Waldo found an immeasurable satisfaction in the handling of his machine;  but Doss winked and blinked, and thought it all frightfully monotonous  out there on the flat, and presently dropped asleep, sitting bolt  upright. Suddenly his eyes opened wide; something was coming from the  direction of the homestead. Winking his eyes and looking intently, he  perceived it was the grey mare. Now Doss had wondered much of late what  had become of her master. Seeing she carried some one on her back, he  now came to his own conclusion, and began to move his tail violently up  and down. Presently he pricked up one ear and let the other hang; his  tail became motionless, and the expression of his mouth was one of  decided disapproval bordering on scorn. He wrinkled his lips up on each  side into little lines.    The sand was soft, and the grey mare came on so noiselessly that the boy  heard nothing till Bonaparte dismounted. Then Doss got up and moved back  a step. He did not approve of Bonaparte's appearance. His costume,  in truth, was of a unique kind. It was a combination of the town and  country. The tails of his black cloth coat were pinned up behind to keep  them from rubbing; he had on a pair of moleskin"]]]
