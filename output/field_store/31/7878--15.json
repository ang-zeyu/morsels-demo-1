As valuable as are all these illustrations, examples, and figures of  speech, still all must of necessity fall short of the truth in the case  of the Soul of Man--that wondrous something which has been built up by  the Absolute after aeons and aeons of time, and which is destined to  play an important part in the great Cosmic Drama which it has pleased  the Absolute to think into existence. Drawing its Life from the  Universal Life, it has the roots of its being still further back in the  Absolute itself, as we shall see in the next lesson. Great and  wonderful is it all, and our minds are but illy fitted to receive the  truth, and must be gradually accustomed to the glare of the Sun. But it  will come to all--none can escape his glorious destiny.    The Oriental writings are full of allusions to the underlying Oneness,  in fact the entire Oriental philosophies rest upon it. You may find it  everywhere if you will but look for it. The experience of Cosmic  Consciousness, which is naught but a sudden or gradual \"awareness\" of  the underlying Unity of Life, is evidenced everywhere in the  _Upanishads_, that wonderful series of teachings in the Hindu classics.  Every writer in the collection gives his evidence regarding this  awareness of Unity and Oneness, and the experiences and mental  characteristics arising from the same. The following quotations will  give an idea of the prevalence of this thought:    \"He that beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all things, he  never turns away from it.\"    \"When to a man who understands, the Self has become all things, what  sorrow, what trouble, can there be to him who once beheld that unity.\"    The Hindu father explains to his son that the One Life is in all forms  and shapes, points out object after object, saying to the boy: \"_Tat  tuam asi_, Thou art that; That thou art.\"    And the Mystics have added their testimony to that of others who have  experienced this consciousness. Plotinus said: \"Knowledge has three  degrees: opinion, science, and illumination. The last is absolute  knowledge founded upon the identity of the knowing mind with the known  object.\"    And Eckhardt, the German mystic, has told his pupils that: \"God is the  soul of all things. He is the light that shines in us when the veil is  rent.\"    And Tennyson, in his wonderful verse describing the temporary lifting  of the veil for him, has described a phase of Cosmic Consciousness in  the following words:         \"For knowledge is the swallow on the lake       That sees and stirs the surface-shadow there,       But never yet hath dippt into the abysm,       The Abysm of all Abysms, beneath, within       The blue of sky and sea, the green of earth,       And in the million-millionth of a grain       Which cleft and cleft again for evermore       And ever vanishing, never vanishes. . .         And more, my son, for more than once when I       Sat all alone, revolving in myself       That word which is the symbol of myself,       The mortal symbol of the Self was loosed,       And past into the Nameless, as a cloud       Melts into Heaven. I touched my limbs, the limbs       Were strange, not mine--and yet no shadow of doubt,       But utter clearness, and through loss of Self       The gain of such large life as matched with ours       Were Sun to spark, unshadowable in words,       Themselves but shadows of a shadow-world.\"    And not only among the mystics and poets is this universal truth  experienced and expressed, but among the great philosophers of all ages  may we find this teaching of the Unity of Life originally voiced in the  _Upanishads_. The Grecian thinkers have expressed the thought; the  Chinese philosophers have added their testimony; the modern  philosophers, Spinoza, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Hartman,  Ferrier, Royce, although differing widely in their theories, all have  expressed as a fundamental truth the Unity of Life--a One Life  underlying. The basic teachings of the Vedas are receiving confirmation  at the hands of Modern Science, which while calling itself  Rationalistic and inclining to a Materialistic conception of the  Universe, still finds itself compelled to say, \"At the last, All is  One.\"    And in nearly every human soul there is a secret chamber in which the  text of this knowledge lies hidden, and in the rare moments in which  the chamber door is opened in response to poetry, music, art, deep  religious feeling, or those unaccountable waves of uplift that come to  all, the truth is recognized for the moment and the soul feels at peace  and is content in the feeling that it is at harmony with the All. The  sense of Beauty, however expressed, when keenly experienced, has a  tendency to lift us out of our consciousness of separateness into  another plane of mind in which the keynote is Unity. The higher the  human feeling, the nearer is the conscious realization of the  underlying Unity.    This realization of the Unity of Life--the Oneness of Life--the Great  Life--even when but faintly experienced, renders Life quite a different  thing to the person. He feels no longer that he is a mere \"part\" of  something that may be destroyed--or that he is a tiny personal  something, separate from and opposed to all the rest of the  Universe--but that he is, instead, a Unit of Expression--a Centre of  Consciousness--in the Great One Life. He realizes that he has the  Power, and Strength, and Life, and Wisdom of the Whole back of him,  upon which he may learn to draw as he unfolds. He realizes that he is  at Home, and that he cannot be thrust out, for there is no outside of  the All. He feels within himself the certainty of infinite Life and  being, for his Life is the all Life, and that cannot die. The petty  cares, and worries, and griefs, and pains of everyday personal life are  seen for what they are, and they cease to threaten and dominate him as  of old. He sees the things of personality as merely the costume and  trappings of the part in the play of life that he is acting out, and he  knows that when he discards them he will still be \"I.\"    When one really feels the consciousness of the One Life underlying, he  acquires a confident trust and faith, and a new sense of freedom and  strength comes to him, for is he not indeed delivered from the bondage  of fear that has haunted him in his world of separateness. He feels  within him the spiritual pulse of the Universal Life, and at once he  thrills with a sense of new-found power and being. He becomes  reconciled with Life in all its phases, for he knows these things as  but temporary phases in the working out of some great Universal plan,  instead of things permanent and fixed and beyond remedy. He begins to  feel the assurance of Ultimate Justice and God, and the old ideas of  Injustice and Evil begin to fade from him. He who enters into the  consciousness of the Universal Life, indeed enters into a present  realization of the Life Everlasting. All fear of being \"lost\" or  \"eternally damned\" fades away, and one instinctively realizes that he  is \"saved\" because he is of the One Life and cannot be lost. All the  fear of being lost arises from the sense of illusion of separateness or  apartness from the One Life. Once the consciousness of Unity is gained,  fear drops from the soul like a wornout garment.    When the idea and consciousness of the Unity takes possession of one,  he feels a new sense of cheerfulness and optimism entirely different  from any other feeling that he has ever experienced. He loses that  distrust and hardness which seems to cling to so many in this age who  have arrived at the Intellectual stage of development, and have been  unable to progress further. A new sense of peace and harmony comes to  one, and illuminates his entire character and life. The bitterness  engendered by the illusion of separateness is neutralized by the  sweetness of the sense of Unity. When one enters into this  consciousness he finds that he has the key to many a riddle of life  that has heretofore perplexed him. Many dark corners are  illuminated--many hard sayings are made clear. Paradoxes become  understandable truths, and the pairs of opposites that dwell in all  advanced intellectual conceptions, seem to bend around their ends and  form themselves into a circle.    To the one who understands the Unity, all Nature seems akin and  friendly. There is no sense of antagonism or opposition--everything is  seen to fit into its place, and work out its appointed task in the  Universal plan. All Nature is seen to be friendly, when properly  understood, and Man regains that sense of harmonious environment and  at-home-ness that he lost when he entered the stage of  self-consciousness. The lower animal and the children feel this Unity,  in their poor imperfect way, but Man lost this Paradise when he  discovered Good and Evil. But Paradise Lost becomes Paradise Regained  when Man enters into this new stage of consciousness. But unlike the  animal or child, which instinctively feels the Unity, the awakened soul  of man possesses the Unity consciousness, coupled with intelligent  comprehension, and unfolding spiritual power. He has found that which  he lost, together with the accumulated interest of the ages. This new  kingdom of Consciousness is before the race. All must enter into it in  time--all will enter into it--many are entering into it now, by gradual  stages. This dawning sense of Unity is that which is causing the  spiritual unrest which is now agitating the world, and Which in time  will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#15)"],[1,"of the meaning or pronunciation of which you are  uncertain.    Avoid discussing your own or other people's domestic concerns.    Never prompt a slow speaker, as if you had all the ability. In  conversing with a foreigner who may be learning our language, it is  excusable to help him in some delicate way.    Never give advice unasked.    Do not manifest impatience.    Do not interrupt another when speaking.    Do not find fault, though you may gently criticise.    Do not appear to notice inaccuracies of speech in others.    Do not always commence a conversation by allusion to the weather.    Do not, when narrating an incident, continually say, \"you see,\" \"you  know.\"    Do not allow yourself to lose temper or speak excitedly.    Do not introduce professional or other topics that the company  generally cannot take an interest in.    Do not talk very loud. A firm, clear, distinct, yet mild, gentle, and  musical voice has great power.    Do not be absent-minded, requiring the speaker to repeat what has been  said that you may understand.    Do not try to force yourself into the confidence of others.    Do not use profanity, vulgar terms, words of double meaning, or  language that will bring the blush to anyone.    Do not allow yourself to speak ill of the absent one if it can be  avoided. The day may come when some friend will be needed to defend  you in your absence.    Do not speak with contempt and ridicule of a locality which you may be  visiting. Find something to truthfully praise and commend; thus make  yourself agreeable.    Do not make a pretense of gentility, nor parade the fact that you are  a descendant of any notable family. You must pass for just what you  are, and must stand on your own merit.    Do not contradict. In making a correction say, \"I beg your pardon,  but I had the impression that it was so and so.\" Be careful in  contradicting, as you may be wrong yourself.    Do not be unduly familiar; you will merit contempt if you are. Neither  should you be dogmatic in your assertions, arrogating to yourself such  consequences in your opinions.    Do not be too lavish in your praise of various members of your own  family when speaking to strangers; the person to whom you are speaking  may know some faults that you do not.    Do not feel it incumbent upon yourself to carry your point in  conversation. Should the person with whom you are conversing feel the  same, your talk may lead into violent argument.    Do not try to pry into the private affairs of others by asking what  their profits are, what things cost, whether Melissa ever had a beau,  and why Amarette never got married? All such questions are extremely  impertinent and are likely to meet with rebuke.    Do not whisper in company; do not engage in private conversation; do  not speak a foreign language which the general company present may not  understand, unless it is understood that the foreigner is unable to  speak your own language.    [Illustration: WIDOWER JONES AND WIDOW SMITH.]             *       *       *       *       *    THE TOILET.    OR    The Care of the Person.      IMPORTANT RULES.    1. GOOD APPEARANCE.--The first care of all persons should be for  their personal appearance. Those who are slovenly or careless in their  habits are unfit for refined society, and cannot possibly make a good  appearance in it. A well-bred person will always cultivate habits  of the most scrupulous neatness. A gentleman or lady is always well  dressed. The garment may be plain or of coarse material, or even worn  \"thin and shiny,\" but if it is carefully brushed and neat, it can be  worn with dignity.    2. PERSONAL CLEANLINESS.--Personal appearance depends greatly on the  careful toilet and scrupulous attention to dress. The first point  which marks the gentleman or lady in appearance is rigid cleanliness.  This remark supplies to the body and everything which covers it. A  clean skin--only to be secured by frequent baths--is indispensable.    3. THE TEETH.--The teeth should receive the utmost attention. Many  a young man has been disgusted with a lady by seeing her unclean and  discolored teeth. It takes but a few moments, and if necessary secure  some simple tooth powder or rub the teeth thoroughly every day with a  linen handkerchief, and it will give the teeth and mouth a beautiful  and clean appearance.    4. THE HAIR AND BEARD.--The hair should be thoroughly brushed and well  kept, and the beard of men properly trimmed. Men should not let their  hair grow long and shaggy.    5. UNDERCLOTHING.--The matter of cleanliness extends to all articles  of clothing, underwear as well as the outer clothing. Cleanliness is  a mark of true utility. The clothes need not necessarily be of a rich  and expensive quality, but they can all be kept clean. Some persons  have an odor about them that is very offensive, simply on account of  their underclothing being worn too long without washing. This odor of  course cannot be detected by the person who wears the soiled garments,  but other persons easily detect it and are offended by it.    6. THE BATH.--No person should think for a moment that they can be  popular in society without regular bathing. A bath should be taken  at least once a week, and if the feet perspire they should be washed  several times a week, as the case may require. It is not unfrequent  that young men are seen with dirty ears and neck. This is unpardonable  and boorish, and shows gross neglect. Occasionally a young lady will  be called upon unexpectedly when her neck and smiling face are  not emblems of cleanliness. Every lady owes it to herself to be  fascinating; every gentleman is bound, for his own sake, to be  presentable; but beyond this there is the obligation to society, to  one's friends, and to those with whom we may be brought in contact.    7. SOILED GARMENTS.--A young man's garments may not be expensive, yet  there is no excuse for wearing a soiled collar and a soiled shirt, or  carrying a soiled handkerchief. No one should appear as though he  had slept in a stable, shaggy hair, soiled clothing or garments  indifferently put on and carelessly buttoned. A young man's vest  should always be kept buttoned in the presence of ladies. 8. THE  BREATH.--Care should be taken to remedy an offensive breath without  delay. Nothing renders one so unpleasant to one's acquaintance, or  is such a source of misery to one's self. The evil may be from some  derangement of the stomach or some defective condition of the teeth,  or catarrhal affection of the throat and nose. See remedies in other  portions of the book.             *       *       *       *       *    A YOUNG MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE.      Dress changes the manners.--VOLTAIRE.    Whose garments wither, shall receive faded smiles.--SHERIDAN KNOWLES.    Men of sense follow fashion so far that they are neither conspicuous  for their excess nor peculiar by their opposition to it.--ANONYMOUS.      1. A well-dressed man does not require so much an extensive as a  varied wardrobe. He does not need a different suit for every season  and every occasion, but if he is careful to select clothes that are  simple and not striking or conspicuous, he may use the garment over  and over again without their being noticed, provided they are suitable  to the season and the occasion.    2. A clean shirt, collar and cuffs always make a young man look neat  and tidy, even if his clothes are not of the latest pattern and are  somewhat threadbare.    3. Propriety is outraged when a man of sixty dresses like a youth  or sixteen. It is bad manners for a gentleman to use perfumes to a  noticeable extent. Avoid affecting singularity in dress. Expensive  clothes are no sign of a gentleman.    4. When dressed for company, strive to appear easy and natural.  Nothing is more distressing to a sensitive person, or more ridiculous  to one gifted with refinement, than to see a lady laboring under the  consciousness of a fine gown or a gentleman who is stiff, awkward and  ungainly in a brand-new coat.    5. Avoid what is called the \"ruffianly style of dress\" or the slouchy  appearance of a half-unbottoned vest, and suspenderless pantaloons.  That sort of affectation is, if possible, even more disgusting than  the painfully elaborate frippery of the dandy or dude. Keep your  clothes well brushed and keep them cleaned. Slight spots can be  removed with a little sponge and soap and water.    6. A gentleman should never wear a high hat unless he has on a frock  coat or a dress suit.    7. A man's jewelry should be good and simple. Brass or false  jewelry, like other forms of falsehood, is vulgar. Wearing many cheap  decorations is a serious fault.    [Illustration: THE DUDE OF THE 17TH CENTURY.]    8. If a man wears a ring it should be on the third finger of the left  hand. This is the only piece of jewelry a man is allowed to wear that  does not serve a purpose.    9. Wearing imitations of diamonds is always in very bad taste.    10. Every man looks better in a full beard if he keeps it well  trimmed. If a man shaves he should shave at least every other day,  unless he is in the country.    11. The finger-nails should be kept cut, and the teeth should be  cleaned every morning, and kept clear from tarter. A man who does  not keep his teeth clean does not look like a gentleman when he shows  them.    [Illustration]             *       *       *       *       *    DRESS.
