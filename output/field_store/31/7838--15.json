But it fortunately happened  otherwise; the high health which was apparent in every countenance was to  be attributed not only to the refreshments we met with at Rio de Janeiro  and the Cape of Good Hope, but to the excellent quality of the provisions  with which we were supplied by Mr. Richards junior, the contractor; and  the spirits visible in every eye were to be ascribed to the general joy  and satisfaction which immediately took place on finding ourselves  arrived at that port which had been so much and so long the subject of  our most serious reflections, the constant theme of our conversations.    The governor, we found, had employed the time he had been here in  examining the bay, for the purpose of determining where he should  establish the settlement; but as yet he had not seen any spot to which  some strong objection did not apply. Indeed, very few places offered  themselves to his choice, and not one sufficiently extensive for a  thousand people to sit down on. The southern shore about Point Sutherland  seemed to possess the soil best adapted for cultivation, but it was  deficient in that grand essential fresh water, and was besides too  confined for our numbers. There was indeed a small run of water there;  but it appeared to be only a drain from a marsh, and by no means promised  that ample or certain supply which was requisite for such a settlement as  ours. The governor, therefore, speedily determined on examining the  adjacent harbours of Port Jackson and Broken Bay, in one of which he  thought it possible that a better situation for his young colony might be  found. But as his search might possibly prove fruitless, and that the few  days which it should occupy might not be altogether thrown away, he left  the lieutenant-governor at Botany Bay, with instructions to clear the  ground about Point Sutherland, and make preparations for disembarking the  detachment of marines and the convicts on his return, should that place  at last be deemed the most eligible spot. At the same time Lieutenant  King, of the _Sirius_, was directed to examine such parts of the bay as,  from want of time, the governor had not himself been able to visit.    The governor set off on Monday the 21st, accompanied by Captain Hunter,  Captain Collins (the judge-advocate), a lieutenant, and the master of the  _Sirius_, with a small party of marines for their protection, the whole  being embarked in three open boats. The day was mild and serene, and  there being but a gentle swell without the mouth of the harbour, the  excursion promised to be a pleasant one. Their little fleet attracted the  attention of several parties of the natives, as they proceeded along the  coast, who all greeted them in the same words, and in the same tone of  vociferation, shouting every where 'Warra, warra, warra' words which, by  the gestures that accompanied them, could not be interpreted into  invitations to land, or expressions of welcome. It must however be  observed, that at Botany Bay the natives had hitherto conducted  themselves sociably and peaceably toward all the parties of our officers  and people with whom they had hitherto met, and by no means seemed to  regard them as enemies or invaders of their country and tranquillity*.    [* How grateful to every feeling of humanity would it be could we  conclude this narrative without being compelled to say, that these  unoffending people had found reason to change both their opinions and  their conduct!]    The coast, as the boats drew near Port Jackson, wore so unfavourable an  appearance, that Captain Phillip's utmost expectation reached no farther  than to find what Captain Cook, as he passed by, thought might be found,  shelter for a boat. In this conjecture, however, he was most agreeably  disappointed, by finding not only shelter for a boat, but a harbour  capable of affording security to a much larger fleet than would probably  ever seek for shelter or security in it. In one of the coves of this  noble and capacious harbour, equal if not superior to any yet known in  the world, it was determined to fix the settlement; and on the 23rd,  having examined it as fully as the time would allow, the governor and his  party left Port Jackson and its friendly and peaceful inhabitants (for  such he everywhere found them), and returned to Botany Bay.    In the report, of the survey made by Lieutenant King, during the  governor's absence, the latter found nothing to induce him to alter his  resolution of fixing in Port Jackson: directions were therefore given,  that the necessary supply of water and grass for the stock should be  immediately sent off to the ships, and the next morning was appointed for  their departure from Botany Bay.    Several trees had been cut down at Point Sutherland, a saw-pit had been  dug, and other preparations made for disembarking, in case the governor  had not succeeded as, to the great satisfaction of every one, it was  found he had; for had he been compelled to remain in Botany Bay, the  swampy ground every where around it threatened us with unhealthy  situations; neither could the shipping have ridden in perfect security  when the wind blew from the SE to which the bay lay much exposed, the sea  at that time rolling in with a prodigious swell. A removal therefore to  Port Jackson was highly applauded, and would have taken place the next  morning, but at daylight we were surprised by the appearance of two  strange sail in the offing. Of what nation they could be, engaged the  general wonder for some time, which at last gave way to a conjecture that  they might be the French ships under M. de la Perouse, then on a voyage  round the world. This was soon strengthened by the view of a white  pendant, similar in shape to that of a commodore in our service, and we  had no longer a doubt remaining that they were the ships above mentioned.  They were, however, prevented by a strong southerly current from getting  into the bay until the 26th, when it was known that they were the  _Boussole_ and _Astrolabe_, French ships, which sailed, under the command  of M. de la Perouse, from France in the year 1785, on a voyage of  discovery. As Captain Hunter, with whom the governor had left the charge  of bringing the _Sirius_ and transports round to Port Jackson (whither he  had preceded them in the _Supply_ the day before), was working out when  M. de la Perouse entered Botany Bay, the two commanders had barely time  to exchange civilities; and it must naturally have created some surprise  in M. de la Perouse to find our fleet abandoning the harbour at the very  time he was preparing to anchor in it: indeed he afterwards said, that  until he had looked round him in Botany Bay, he could not divine the  cause of our quitting it, which he was so far from expecting, that having  heard at Kamschatka of the intended settlement, he imagined he should  have found a town built and a market established; but from what he had  seen of the country since his arrival, he was convinced of the propriety  and absolute necessity of the measure. M. de la Perouse sailed into the  harbour by Captain Cook's chart of Botany Bay, which lay before him on  the binnacle; and we had the pleasure of hearing him more than once pay a  tribute to our great circumnavigator's memory, by acknowledging the  accuracy of his nautical observations.    The governor, with a party of marines, and some artificers selected from  among the seamen of the _Sirius_ and the convicts, arrived in Port  Jackson, and anchored off the mouth of the cove intended for the  settlement on the evening of the 25th; and in the course of the following  day sufficient ground was cleared for encamping the officer's guard and  the convicts who had been landed in the morning. The spot chosen for this  purpose was at the head of the cove, near the run of fresh water, which  stole silently along through a very thick wood, the stillness of which  had then, for the first time since the creation, been interrupted by the  rude sound of the labourer's axe, and the downfall of its ancient  inhabitants; a stillness and tranquillity which from that day were to  give place to the voice of labour, the confusion of camps and towns, and  'the busy hum of its new possessors.' That these did not bring with them,  'Minds not to be changed by time or place,' was fervently to have been  wished; and if it were possible, that on taking possession of Nature, as  we had thus done, in her simplest, purest garb, we might not sully that  purity by the introduction of vice, profaneness, and immorality. But  this, though much to be wished, was little to be expected; the habits of  youth are not easily laid aside, and the utmost we could hope in our  present situation was to oppose the soft harmonising arts of peace and  civilisation to the baneful influence of vice and immorality.    In the evening of this day the whole of the party that came round in the  _Supply_ were assembled at the point where they had first landed in the  morning, and on which a flag-staff had been purposely erected and an  union jack displayed, when the marines fired several vollies; between  which the governor and the officers who accompanied him drank the healths  of his Majesty and the Royal Family, and success to the new colony. The  day, which had been uncommonly fine, concluded with the safe arrival of  the _Sirius_ and the convoy from Botany Bay--thus terminating the voyage  with the same good fortune that had from its commencement been so  conspicuously their friend and companion.    The disembarkation of the troops and convicts took place from the  following day until the whole were landed. The confusion that ensued will  not be wondered at, when it is considered that every man stepped from the  boat literally"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12573"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 08 (#15)"],[1,"brother yeast, and meal, and tobacco. She wanted to show him how--in  addition to the general charcoal-burner's fare, which consists of bread  baked with yeast--he might make the dumplings he prepared for himself  taste better. But Damie would not listen to her; he said he preferred to  have them just as they were--he rather liked to swallow bad food when he  might have had better; and altogether, he derived a kind of satisfaction  from self-neglect, until he should some day be decked out as a soldier.    Barefoot fought against this continual looking forward to a future time,  and this loss of time in the present. She was always wanting to put some  life into Damie, who rather enjoyed being indolent and pitying himself.  Indeed, he seemed to find a sort of satisfaction in his downward course,  for it gave him an opportunity to pity himself to his heart's content,  and did not require him to make any physical exertion. With great  difficulty Barefoot managed to prevail so far that he at least bought an  ax of his own out of his earnings; and it was his father's ax, which  Coaly Mathew had bought at the auction in the old days.    Barefoot often came back out of the Wood in profound despair, but this  state of mind never lasted long. Her inward confidence in herself, and  the natural cheerfulness that was in her, involuntarily burst forth from  her lips in song; and anybody who did not know her, would never have  thought that Barefoot either had a care then, or ever had had one in all  her life.    The satisfaction arising from the feeling that she was sturdily and  untiringly doing her duty, and acting as a Samaritan to Black Marianne  and Damie, impressed an indelible cheerfulness on her countenance; in  the whole house there was no one who could laugh so heartily as  Barefoot. Old Farmer Rodel declared that her laughter sounded like the  song of a quail, and because she was always serviceable and respectful  to him, he gave her to understand that he would remember her in his  will. Barefoot did not pay much attention to this or build much upon it;  she looked only for the wages to which she had a true and honest claim;  and what she did, she did from an inward feeling of benevolence, without  expectation of reward.          CHAPTER VIII    \"SACK AND AX\"      Scheckennarre's house was duly rebuilt, and in handsomer style than  before; and the winter came, and with it the drawing for recruits. Never  had there been greater lamentation over a \"lucky number\" than arose when  Damie drew one and was declared exempt. He was in complete despair, and  Barefoot almost shared his grief; for she looked upon this soldiering as  a capital method of setting Damie up, and of breaking him of his  slovenly habits. Still she said to him:    \"Take this as a sign that you are to depend upon yourself now, and to be  a man; for you still behave like a little child that can't shift for  itself and has to be fed.\"    \"You're reproaching me now for feeding upon you.\"    \"No, I didn't mean that. Don't be so touchy all the time--always  standing there as if to say: 'Who's going to do anything for me, good or  bad?' Strike about for yourself.\"    \"That's just what I am going to do, and I shall strike with a good  swing,\" said Damie.    For a long time he would not state what his real intention was; but he  walked through the village with his head singularly erect and spoke  freely to everybody; he worked diligently in the forest with the  woodcutters, having his father's ax and with it almost the bodily  strength of him who had swung it so sturdily in the days that were gone.    One evening in the early part of the spring, when Barefoot met him on  his way back from Mossbrook Wood, he asked, taking the ax from his  shoulder and holding it up before her:    \"Where do you think this is going?\"    \"Into the forest,\" answered Barefoot. \"But it won't go alone--there must  be a chopper.\"    \"You are right; but it's going to its brother--and one will chop on  this side and another will chop on that side, and then the trees crash  and roar like cannons, and still you will hear nothing of it--and yet  _you_ may, if you wish to, but no one else in this place.\"    \"I don't understand one peck of all your bushel,\" answered Barefoot.  \"Speak out--I'm too old to guess riddles now.\"    \"Well, I'm going to uncle in America.\"    \"Indeed? Going to start to-day?\" said Barefoot, laughing. \"Do you remember  how Martin, the mason's boy, once called up to his mother through the  window: 'Mother, throw me out a clean pocket-handkerchief--I'm going to  America!' Those who were going to fly so quickly are all still here.\"    \"You'll see how much longer I shall be here,\" said Damie; and without  another word he went into Coaly Mathew's house.    Barefoot felt like laughing at Damie's ridiculous plan, but she could  not; she felt that there was some meaning in it. And that very night,  when everybody was in bed, she went to her brother and declared once for  all that she would not go with him. She thought thus to conquer him; but  Damie replied quickly:    \"I'm not tied to you!\" and became the more confirmed in his plan.    Then there suddenly welled up in the girl's mind once more all that  flood of reflections that had come upon her once in her childhood; but  this time she did not ask advice of the tree, as if it could have  answered her. All her deliberations brought her to this one conclusion:  \"He's right in going, and I'm right, too, in staying here.\" She felt  inwardly glad that Damie could make such a bold resolve--at any rate, it  showed manly determination. And although she felt a deep sorrow at the  thought of being henceforth alone in the wide world, she nevertheless  thought it right that her brother should thrust forth his hand thus  boldly and independently.    Still, she did not yet quite believe him. The next evening she waited  for him and said:    \"Don't tell anybody about your plan to emigrate, or you'll be laughed at  if you don't carry it out.\"    \"You're right,\" answered Damie; \"but it's not for that. I'm not afraid  to bind myself before other people; so surely as I have five fingers on  this hand, so surely shall I go before the cherries are ripe here, if I  have to beg, yes, even to steal, in order to get off. There's only one  thing I'm sorry about--and that is that I must go away without playing  Scheckennarre a trick that he'd remember to the end of his days.\"    \"That's the true braggart's way! That's the real way to ruin!\" cried  Barefoot; \"to go off and leave a feeling of revenge behind one! Look,  over yonder lie our parents. Come with me--come with me to their graves  and say that again there if you can. Do you know who it is that turns  out to be a no-good?--the boy who lets himself be spoiled! Give up that  ax! You are not worthy to have your hand where father had his hand,  unless you tear that thought out of your mind, root and branch! Give up  that ax! No man shall have that who talks of stealing and of murdering!  Give up that ax, or I don't know what I may do!\"    Then Damie, in a frightened tone, replied:    \"It was only a thought. Believe me I never intended to do it--I can't do  anything of that kind. But because they always call me \"skittle-boy,\" I  thought I ought for once to threaten and swear and strike as they do.  But you are right; look, if you like, I'll go this very day to  Scheckennarre and tell him that my heart doesn't cherish a single hard  thought against him.\"    \"You need not do that--that would be too much. But because you listen to  reason, I will help you all I can.\"    \"It would be best if you went with me.\"    \"No, I can't do that--I don't know why, but I can't. But I have not  sworn not to go--if you write to me that you are doing well at uncle's,  then I'll come after you. But to go out into the fog, where one knows  nothing--well, I'm not fond of making changes anyway, and after all I'm  doing fairly well here. But now let us consider how you are to get  away.\"    Damie's savings were very trifling, and Barefoot's were not enough to  make up the deficiency. Damie declared that the parish ought to give him  a handsome contribution; but his sister would not hear of it, saying  that this ought to be the last resource, when everything else had  failed. She did not explain what else she was going to try. Her first  idea, naturally, was to make application to Dame Landfried at  Zumarshofen; but she knew what a bad appearance a begging letter would  make in the eyes of the rich farmer's wife, who perhaps would not have  any ready money anyway. Then she thought of old Farmer Rodel, who had  promised to remember her in his will; could he be induced to give her  now what he intended to give her later on, even if it should be less?  Then again, it occurred to her that perhaps Scheckennarre, who was now  getting on especially well, might be induced to contribute something.    She said nothing to Damie about all this. But when she examined his  wardrobe, and with great difficulty induced Black Marianne to let her  have on credit some of the old woman's heaped-up stores of linen, and  when she began to cut out this linen and sat up at night making shirts  of it--all these steady and active preparations made Damie almost  tremble. To be sure, he had acted all along as if his plan of emigrating  were irrevocably fixed in his mind--and yet now he seemed almost bound  to go, to be under compulsion, as if his sister's strong will were  forcing him to carry out his design. And his sister seemed almost  hard-hearted to him, as if she were thrusting him away to get rid of  him. He did not, indeed, dare to say this openly, but he began to  grumble and complain a good deal about it, and Barefoot looked upon this  as suppressed grief over parting--the feeling that would gladly take  advantage of little obstacles and represent them as hindrances to the  fulfilment of a purpose one would gladly leave unfulfilled.
