Sometimes, perhaps, it  was brought into the country by a poor sailor, who had caught the  infection in foreign parts, and came hither to die, and to be the cause of  many deaths. Sometimes, no doubt, it followed in the train of the pompous  governors, when they came over from England. Sometimes, the disease lay  hidden in the cargoes of ships, among silks and brocades, and other costly  merchandise, which was imported for the rich people to wear. And,  sometimes, it started up, seemingly of its own accord; and nobody could  tell whence it came. The physician, being called to attend the sick  person, would look at him, and say,--\"It is the small pox! let the patient  be carried to the hospital.\"    And now, this dreadful sickness had shown itself again in Boston. Cotton  Mather was greatly afflicted, for the sake of the whole province. He had  children, too, who were exposed to the danger. At that very moment, he  heard the voice of his youngest son, for whom his heart was moved with  apprehension.    \"Alas! I fear for that poor child,\" said Cotton Mather to himself. \"What  shall I do for my son Samuel?\"    Again, he attempted to drive away these thoughts, by taking up the book  which he had been reading. And now, all of a sudden, his attention became  fixed. The book contained a printed letter that an Italian physician had  written upon the very subject, about which Cotton Mather was so anxiously  meditating. He ran his eye eagerly over the pages; and, behold! a method  was disclosed to him, by which the small pox might be robbed of its worst  terrors. Such a method was known in Greece. The physicians of Turkey, too,  those long-bearded Eastern sages, had been acquainted with it for many  years. The negroes of Africa, ignorant as they were, had likewise  practised it, and thus had shown themselves wiser than the white men.    \"Of a truth,\" ejaculated Cotton Mather, clasping his hands and looking up  to Heaven, \"it was a merciful Providence that brought this book under mine  eye! I will procure a consultation of physicians, and see whether this  wondrous Inoculation may not stay the progress of the Destroyer.\"    So he arose from Grandfather's chair, and went out of the library. Near  the door he met his son Samuel, who seemed downcast and out of spirits.  The boy had heard, probably, that some of his playmates were taken ill  with the small pox. But, as his father looked cheerfully at him, Samuel  took courage, trusting that either the wisdom of so learned a minister  would find some remedy for the danger, or else that his prayers would  secure protection from on high.    Meanwhile, Cotton Mather took his staff and three-cornered hat, and walked  about the streets, calling at the houses of all the physicians in Boston.  They were a very wise fraternity; and their huge wigs, and black dresses,  and solemn visages, made their wisdom appear even profounder than it was.  One after another, he acquainted them with the discovery which he had hit  upon.    But these grave and sagacious personages would scarcely listen to him. The  oldest doctor in town contented himself with remarking, that no such thing  as inoculation was mentioned by Galen or Hippocrates, and it was  impossible that modern physicians should be wiser than those old sages. A  second held up his hands in dumb astonishment and horror, at the madness  of what Cotton Mather proposed to do. A third told him, in pretty plain  terms, that he knew not what he was talking about. A fourth requested, in  the name of the whole medical fraternity, that Cotton Mather would confine  his attention to people's souls, and leave the physicians to take care of  their bodies.    In short, there was but a single doctor among them all, who would grant  the poor minister so much as a patient hearing. This was Doctor Zabdiel  Boylston. He looked into the matter like a man of sense, and finding,  beyond a doubt, that inoculation had rescued many from death, he resolved  to try the experiment in his own family.    And so he did. But, when the other physicians heard of it, they arose in  great fury, and began a war of words, written, printed, and spoken,  against Cotton Mather and Doctor Boylston. To hear them talk, you would  have supposed that these two harmless and benevolent men had plotted the  ruin of the country.    The people, also, took the alarm. Many, who thought themselves more pious  than their neighbors, contended, that, if Providence had ordained them to  die of the small pox, it was sinful to aim at preventing it. The strangest  reports were in circulation. Some said, that Doctor Boylston had contrived  a method for conveying the gout, rheumatism, sick headache, asthma, and  all other diseases, from one person to another, and diffusing them through  the whole community. Others flatly affirmed that the Evil One had got  possession of Cotton Mather, and was at the bottom of the whole business.    You must observe, children, that Cotton Mather's fellow citizens were  generally inclined to doubt the wisdom of any measure, which he might  propose to them. They recollected how he had led them astray in the old  witchcraft delusion; and now, if he thought and acted ever so wisely, it  was difficult for him to get the credit of it.    The people's wrath grew so hot at his attempt to guard them from the small  pox, that he could not walk the streets in peace. Whenever the venerable  form of the old minister, meagre and haggard with fasts and vigils, was  seen approaching, hisses were heard, and shouts of derision, and scornful  and bitter laughter. The women snatched away their children from his path,  lest he should do them a mischief. Still, however, bending his head  meekly, and perhaps stretching out his hands to bless those who reviled  him, he pursued his way. But the tears came into his eyes, to think how  blindly the people rejected the means of safety, that were offered them.    Indeed, there were melancholy sights enough in the streets of Boston, to  draw forth the tears of a compassionate man. Over the door of almost every  dwelling, a red flag was fluttering in the air. This was the signal that  the small pox had entered the house, and attacked some member of the  family; or perhaps the whole family, old and young, were struggling at  once with the pestilence. Friends and relatives, when they met one another  in the streets, would hurry onward without a grasp of the hand, or  scarcely a word of greeting, lest they should catch or communicate the  contagion. And, often a coffin was borne hastily along.    \"Alas, alas!\" said Cotton Mather to himself. \"What shall be done for this  poor, misguided people? Oh, that Providence would open their eyes, and  enable them to discern good from evil!\"    So furious, however, were the people, that they threatened vengeance  against any person who should dare to practise inoculation, though it were  only in his own family. This was a hard case for Cotton Mather, who saw no  other way to rescue his poor child Samuel from the disease. But he  resolved to save him, even if his house should be burnt over his head.    \"I will not be turned aside,\" said he. \"My townsmen shall see that I have  faith in this thing, when I make the experiment on my beloved son, whose  life is dearer to me than my own. And when I have saved Samuel,  peradventure they will be persuaded to save themselves.\"    Accordingly, Samuel was inoculated; and so was Mr. Walter, a son-in-law of  Cotton Mather. Doctor Boylston, likewise, inoculated many persons; and  while hundreds died, who had caught the contagion from the garments of the  sick, almost all were preserved, who followed the wise physician's advice.    But the people were not yet convinced of their mistake. One night, a  destructive little instrument, called a hand-grenade, was thrown into  Cotton Mather's window, and rolled under Grandfather's chair. It was  supposed to be filled with gunpowder, the explosion of which would have  blown the poor minister to atoms. But the best-informed historians are of  opinion, that the grenade contained only brimstone and assaf[oe]tida, and  was meant to plague Cotton Mather with a very evil perfume.    This is no strange thing in human experience. Men, who attempt to do the  world more good, than the world is able entirely to comprehend, are almost  invariably held in bad odor. But yet, if the wise and good man can wait  awhile, either the present generation or posterity, will do him justice.  So it proved, in the case which we have been speaking of. In after years,  when inoculation was universally practised, and thousands were saved from  death by it, the people remembered old Cotton Mather, then sleeping in his  grave. They acknowledged that the very thing, for which they had so  reviled and persecuted him, was the best and wisest thing he ever did.        \"Grandfather, this is not an agreeable story,\" observed Clara.    \"No, Clara,\" replied Grandfather. \"But it is right that you should know  what a dark shadow this disease threw over the times of our forefathers.  And now, if you wish to learn more about Cotton Mather, you must read his  biography, written by Mr. Peabody, of Springfield. You will find it very  entertaining and instructive; but perhaps the writer is somewhat too harsh  in his judgment of this singular man. He estimates him fairly, indeed, and  understands him well; but he unriddles his character rather by acuteness  than by sympathy. Now, his life should have been written by one, who,  knowing all his faults, would nevertheless love him.\"    So Grandfather made an end of Cotton Mather, telling his auditors that he  died in 1728, at the age of sixty-five, and bequeathed the chair to Elisha  Cooke. This gentleman was a famous advocate of the people's rights.    The same year, William Burnet, a son of the celebrated Bishop Burnet,  arrived in Boston, with the commission of governor. He was the first that  had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15699"],[0,"A Handbook of the Boer War (#15)"],[1,"than to leave Natal open to the enemy.\"    Nor did the Boers enter into the contest with much confidence. They had  not yet tried Buller's mettle and his name was to them a tradition of  courage handed down from the Zulu war, in which some of the older  burghers now opposing him on the Tugela had served under him. The  curious omission to inform White in Ladysmith that an attack on Colenso  was to be made on December 15 may have arisen from Buller's doubts as to  its issue, or from reluctance to heliograph a message in a cipher of  which the enemy might have the key.    The story of the Battle of Colenso is mainly the narrative of the action  of two important components of the Army of Natal. Each of these was led  by a dangerously brave man, whose impetuosity crippled the tactical  scheme and whose method of working his command was, at least, unusual.  If in Hart and Long, who commanded the Artillery, the quality of  personal courage had been less prominent it is probable that Colenso  would not have filled up the cup of Stormberg and Magersfontein in that  dark midsummer December week.    The naval guns on the west of the railway had the honour of opening the  battle, and shelled Fort Wyllie for some time without eliciting any  response. Long joined Hildyard with another naval battery and two field  batteries. He was not only an impetuous man but he also belonged to the  short range school of artillerists;[22] and he soon outpaced his  infantry escort and came into action with his field batteries in the  open a little in advance of a shallow intersecting donga, and within  1,100 yards of the Boer entrenchments across the river. The naval  battery had been compelled by the flight of the Kaffir ox drivers to  outspan astride a deeper donga about a quarter of a mile in rear, to  which Long had sent back his gun teams. A terrific rifle and shrapnel  fire, which the infantry escort which soon came up was powerless to  subdue, was now opened upon the guns, and for an hour the batteries were  beaten on until the casualties left but four men to each gun, and  ammunition was running short. Long, who was one of the first to be  wounded, withdrew the dwindled gun detachments to the shallow donga and  sent back for a fresh supply of ammunition, intending to resume fire as  soon as the general attack developed.    All the while the batteries had been unsupported except by the escorting  companies, which were not under Long's orders, and no attempt was made  by Hildyard's or Barton's brigade in rear to relieve or divert the  pressure on the guns, which had succeeded in silencing temporarily some  of the Boer artillery and in checking the rifle fire.    Earlier in the action Buller had been informed that the guns were \"all  right and comfortable,\" but later reports gave him the impression that  this cheery optimism was delusive, and that owing to loss of men and  exhaustion of ammunition the artillery told off to support Hildyard was  now permanently out of action. The rest of the artillery was engaged in  assisting Hart, who was in trouble, and Buller came to the conclusion  that the attack on the Colenso kopjes must be withdrawn.    Hart's Brigade was ordered to march \"towards the Bridle Drift at the  junction of the Doornkop Spruit and the Tugela, and to cross at that  point.\" Here was yet another ambiguity. As there were two \"Iron Bridges\"  so also were there two \"Bridle Drifts,\" one on each side of the isthmus  of the river loop, and yet another at the head of it. The West Drift was  unfordable on the morning of December 15, and a hasty sketch which had  probably been filled in from hearsay evidence and which was Hart's only  map, showed the Doornkop Spruit as entering the Tugela below that Drift  instead of just above the East Drift.[23] The sketch also duplicated the  loop.    In dense formation, although the enemy was reported to be in force on  his front, Hart crossed the Doornkop Spruit without recognizing it and  advanced to the West Drift guided by a Kaffir who lived close by. The  native seems either to have had misgivings as to the fordability of the  Drift or to have been carelessly instructed, for as the column  approached the river he pointed to a Drift which was not the East Drift,  but the Drift at the head of the loop near his own kraal; and Hart was  induced to change direction and lead the Brigade into the loop.    At 6 a.m. against the orders of Botha, who wished to lure on his foe,  the Boer guns commanding Hart's loop suddenly opened on the dense  battalions, and the trenches on the left bank took up the firing. The  Kaffir guide disappeared in terror. But Hart still believed that there  was a drift to be found somewhere or other and pushed his Brigade, like  a shoal of herrings driven into a purse net, up the loop; and some  companies even reached the kraal near the head of it. Without  artillery--for Hart had not brought up the field batteries assigned to  him--and exposed to a concentrated fire from front, left, and right, the  unhappy Irish Brigade, which suffered 400 casualties in less than three  quarters of an hour, was helpless. Hart began to deploy, but Buller who  from Naval Gun Hill was watching, possibly with astonishment, the  entanglement in the loop ordered him to withdraw, at the same time  sending two battalions to dig him out of his hole. It was not an easy  task and it was made more difficult by the gallant reluctance of the  Irishmen to retreat before the enemy. Thus Hart and Long, the former  with his Hibernian zeal to move in the line of the greatest resistance,  the latter with his rash generalization that entrenched Boers could be  coerced as if they were Omdurman dervishes in the open, brought about  the reverse at Colenso.    By this time it was evident to Buller that his scheme must fail. He had  already arranged the extrication of Hart and now the extrication of Long  called for immediate action. He therefore rode across to the deep donga  east of the railway; on his way informing Hildyard, whose brigade was  awaiting an opportunity to carry out its orders, that the attack was  abandoned and that the brigade must cover the withdrawal of the field  batteries. He ordered the naval battery to retire, and sent back the  ammunition wagons, which after long delay were on their way to the field  guns: and acknowledged that he was baffled.    Hildyard occupied Colenso but was unable to prevent the Boers re-opening  fire from Fort Wyllie on the desolate batteries lying on the veld. No  troops could move across the open; and only individual efforts could now  save the guns. Not a few officers and men offered for the forlorn hope,  and at the first attempt two guns were rescued. A later attempt was not  successful, and at 11 a.m. Buller ordered a general retirement and the  abandonment of the guns. The main naval battery remained in position  west of the railway for some hours, and in its presence the Boers were  afraid to cross the river and take possession of the derelict but not  disabled guns; which were not captured until all the British troops had  left the field except a few gunners and infantry details who had taken  refuge in the deep donga and whom the order to retreat had not reached;  and these were made prisoners of war.    The mounted Brigade under Lord Dundonald acting on the right flank with  orders to take Hlangwhane, if possible, was too weak to support the main  attack effectively. Assistance was refused at first by Barton and  afterwards by Buller, who thought that Hlangwhane would be of little use  to him without the possession of the Colenso kopjes; yet these could  have been enfiladed from it. As the Brigade retired it passed within  striking distance of the field guns and their captors; but nothing could  be done as ambulances and groups of prisoners were bemingled in the  throng. Dundonald seems to have been alone in his recognition of the  value of the Hlangwhane position.    A retirement to Chieveley and Frere completed the triad of December  disasters. Buller, of whom so much was expected, had failed in his first  attempt to measure swords with the burghers. His 19,000 men and  forty-two guns fighting for six hours inflicted on the enemy a loss of  less than two score. His casualties exceeded 1,100, he lost ten guns,  and he then returned to the place from which he came. He thought that he  had fought a battle, but in reality he had only made a reconnaissance in  force, a dangerous operation only justifiable by urgent necessity.[24]    Possibly if Buller, who was practically without a staff, had allowed a  freer hand to Clery, that authority on Minor Tactics might have done  better. It has been said that the defeat was due to insufficient  reconnaissance; and this is to a certain extent true, for a more  accurate knowledge of the terrain and the dispositions of the enemy  would have clearly demonstrated the hopelessness of a frontal attack on  the Colenso Kopjes, and the attempt would never have been made. Again,  as at Magersfontein four days before, a considerable portion of the  troops was not seriously engaged; and the total casualties in eight  battalions were but 120.    The loss of the guns is the chief fact in the story of Colenso. What  were Buller's intentions with regard to the Naval battery and the two  Field batteries which he sent to \"a point from which they could prepare  the crossing for Hildyard's Brigade,\" and how did Long understand and  carry out his orders.    The battle orders had been orally anticipated by Buller, who before they  were issued, explained his intentions personally to Long: and, as often  happens in conferences, the impression retained by one conferent  differed from that intended to be conveyed by the other. Long believed  that he was instructed to shell the Kopjes and entrenched positions  behind Fort Wyllie, which he did not at first know was held by the  enemy, and he opened at a range of a mile; and Buller's"]]]
