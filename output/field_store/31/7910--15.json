Petroleum production and processing account for about  85% of export receipts, 60% of government revenues, and 20% of GDP. In 1986  soft oil-market conditions led to a 5% drop in GDP, in sharp contrast  wit the 5% average annual growth rate during the early 1980s. The  slowdown in economic activity, however, has helped to check the  inflation of the 1970s. The government's past economic diversification  efforts have moderated the severity of the downturn but failed to  offset oil and gas revenue losses.    GDP: $3.5 billion, per capita $7,550 (1987); real growth rate 0% (1988)    Inflation rate (consumer prices): 0.3% (1988)    Unemployment: 8-10% (1989)    Budget: revenues $1,136 million; expenditures $1,210 million,  including capital expenditures of $294 million (1987)    Exports: $2.4 billion (f.o.b., 1988 est.);  commodities--petroleum 80%, aluminum 7%, other 13%; partners--US,  UAE, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia    Imports: $2.5 billion (f.o.b., 1988 est.); commodities--nonoil 59%,  crude oil 41%; partners--UK, Saudi Arabia, US, Japan    External debt: $1.1 billion (December 1989 est.)

This he  did with great ability. Forquer, though not a candidate, then asked to  be heard for the Democrats in reply to Lincoln. He was a good speaker  and well-known throughout the county. His special task that day was to  attack and ridicule the young man from Salem. Turning to Lincoln, who  stood within a few feet of him, he said: 'This young man must be taken  down, and I am truly sorry that the task devolves upon me.' He then  proceeded, in a very overbearing way, and with an assumption of great  superiority, to attack Lincoln and his speech. Lincoln stood calm, but  his flashing eye and pale cheek showed his indignation. As soon as  Forquer had closed he took the stand and first answered his opponent's  arguments fully and triumphantly. So impressive were his words and  manner that a hearer believes that he can remember to this day, and  repeat, some of the expressions. Among other things, he said: 'The  gentleman commenced his speech by saying that this _young_ man--alluding  to me--must be taken down. I am not so young in years as I am in the  tricks and trades of a politician; but,' said he, pointing to Forquer,  'live long or die young, I would rather die now, than, like the  gentleman, change my politics for a three thousand dollar office, and  then feel obliged to erect a lightning-rod over my house to protect a  guilty conscience from the vengeance of an offended God!'\"    \"It is difficult to-day,\" says Mr. Arnold, \"to appreciate the effect on  the old settlers, of this figure. This lightning-rod was the first which  most of those present had ever seen. They had slept all their lives in  their cabins in conscious security. Here was a man who seemed, to these  simple-minded people, to be afraid to sleep in his own house without  special and extraordinary protection from Almighty God. These old  settlers thought nothing but the consciousness of guilt, the stings of a  guilty conscience, could account for such timidity. Forquer and his  lightning-rod were talked over in every settlement from Sangamon to the  Illinois and the Wabash. Whenever he rose to speak thereafter, they  said, 'There is the man who dare not sleep in his own house without a  lightning-rod to keep off the vengeance of the Almighty.'\"    Another amusing incident of the same campaign, and one which illustrates  Lincoln's love of a practical joke, is given as follows: \"Among the  Democrats stumping the county at this time was one Dick Taylor, a most  pompous person, who was always arrayed in the richest attire--ruffled  shirts, seals, etc., besides a rich embroidered vest. Notwithstanding  this array, he made great pretentions of being one of the 'hard-handed  yeomanry,' and ridiculed with much sarcasm the 'rag barons' and  'manufacturing lords' of the Whig party. One day, when he was  particularly aggravating in a speech of this kind, Lincoln decided on a  little sport, and sidling up to Taylor suddenly threw open the latter's  coat, showing to the astonished spectators a glittering mass of ruffled  shirt, gold watch, and glittering jewels. The crowd shouted  uproariously. Lincoln said: 'While he [Colonel Taylor] was making these  charges against the Whigs over the country, riding in fine carriages,  wearing ruffled shirts, kid gloves, massive gold watch-chains with large  gold seals, and flourishing a heavy gold-headed cane, I was a poor boy,  hired on a flatboat at eight dollars a month, and had only one pair of  breeches to my name, and they were buckskin,--and if you know the nature  of buckskin, when wet and dried by the sun it will shrink,--and mine  kept shrinking until they left several inches of my legs bare between  the tops of my socks and the lower part of my breeches. Whilst I was  growing taller, they were becoming shorter and so much tighter that they  left a blue streak around my legs that can be seen to this day. If you  call this aristocracy, I plead guilty to the charge.'\"    \"The Saturday evening preceding the election,\" says Mr. Lamon, \"the  candidates were addressing the people in the Court House at Springfield.  Dr. Early, one of the candidates on the Democratic side, made some  charge which Mr. N.W. Edwards, one of the candidates on the Whig side,  deemed untrue. Edwards climbed on a table, so as to be seen by Early and  by everyone in the house, and at the top of his voice told Early that  the charge was false. The excitement that followed was intense--so much  so that fighting men thought a duel must settle the difficulty. Lincoln,  by the programme, followed Early. He took up the subject in dispute and  handled it fairly and with such ability that everyone was astonished  and pleased. So that difficulty ended there. Then for the first time,  aroused by the excitement of the occasion, he spoke in that tenor  intonation of voice that ultimately settled down into that clear, shrill  monotone style that afterwards characterized his public speaking, and  enabled his audience, however large, to hear distinctly the lowest sound  of his voice.\" Mr. Arnold says that Lincoln's reply to Dr. Early was  \"often spoken of as exhibiting wonderful ability, and a crushing power  of sarcasm and ridicule. When he began he was embarrassed, spoke slowly  and with some hesitation and difficulty. But becoming excited by his  subject, he forgot himself entirely, and went on with argument and wit,  anecdote and ridicule, until his opponent was completely crushed. Old  settlers of Sangamon County who heard this reply speak of his personal  transformation as wonderful. When Lincoln began, they say, he seemed  awkward, homely, unprepossessing. As he went on, and became excited, his  figure rose to its full height and became commanding and majestic. His  plain face was illuminated and glowed with expression. His dreamy eye  flashed with inspiration, and his whole person, his voice, his gestures,  were full of the magnetism of powerful feeling, of conscious strength  and true eloquence.\"    The inflexible honesty and fine sense of honor which lay at the  foundation of Lincoln's character are nobly exhibited in the following  letter to a former friend but now political opponent, Col. Robert Allen:         DEAR COLONEL:--I am told that during my absence last week, you       passed through this place, and stated publicly that you were in       possession of a fact or facts which, if known to the public, would       entirely destroy the prospects of N.W. Edwards and myself at the       ensuing election, but that through favor to us you would forbear to       divulge them. No one has needed favors more than I, and generally       few have been less unwilling to accept them; but in this case       favor to me would be injustice to the public, and therefore I must       beg your pardon for declining it. That I once had the confidence of       the people of Sangamon County is sufficiently evident; and if I       have since done anything, either by design or misadventure, which       if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that confidence, he       who knows of that thing and conceals it is a traitor to his       country's interest.         I find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or       facts, real or supposed, you spoke. But my opinion of your veracity       will not permit me for a moment to doubt that you at least believed       what you said. I am flattered with the personal regard you       manifested for me; but I do hope that on more mature reflection you       will view the public interest as a paramount consideration, and       therefore determine to let the worst come.         I assure you that the candid statement of facts on your part,       however low it may sink me, shall never break the ties of personal       friendship between us.         I wish an answer to this, and you are at liberty to publish both if       you choose.         Very respectfully,       A. LINCOLN.         COL. ROBERT ALLEN.    The campaign resulted in Lincoln's election to the Legislature of 1836.  The nine delegates from Sangamon County happened to be men of remarkable  stature, each one measuring six feet or more in height; and very  naturally they were nicknamed the \"Long Nine.\" Lincoln overtopped all  the rest, and as a consequence was called \"the Sangamon Chief.\" The  State capital was then at Vandalia; and Lincoln's journey there from  Springfield was made mainly on foot. As he was trudging along the muddy  road, he fell in with Judge John Dean Caton, one of the early lawyers of  Illinois, afterwards Chief Justice of the State, who became an intimate  friend of Lincoln. Judge Caton gives an interesting account of their  first meeting, which occurred at this time. \"I first met Mr. Lincoln,\"  says Judge Caton, \"about the last of November, 1835, when on my way to  Vandalia to join the Supreme Court, which met there the first Monday in  December, at the same time as the meeting of the Legislature. There were  a great many people and all sorts of vehicles on the road from  Springfield to Vandalia. The roads were very bad, and most of the  passengers got out and walked a considerable portion of the distance. It  seemed almost like the movement of a little army. While walking thus  along the side of the road I met Mr. Lincoln for the first time, and in  the course of a two days' journey we became quite well acquainted. If he  had been admitted to the bar at that time, he had not become known as a  lawyer out of his own immediate circuit. He was going to Vandalia as a  member of the Legislature. He was one of the 'Long Nine,' as it was  called, from Sangamon County, who by their successful manoeuvring and  united efforts succeeded in getting the seat of government moved from  Vandalia to Springfield. During my stay of a few weeks in Vandalia I  frequently met Mr. Lincoln. He was a very pleasant companion; but as we  walked along the road on the occasion"]]]
