It had immemorial custom  in Africa to contend with, inveterate barbarism, and savage ferocity. This  system had interwoven itself with our commercial existence so closely, as  to require the most sagacious policy to eradicate it; at the same time it  was the highest consideration for our magnanimity to interfere for that  being whose thraldom and calamitous state had so long contributed to our  wealth and commercial prosperity, before we abandoned him to contingencies.    Enough may have been said in the foregoing pages, to prove that something  yet remains to be done to effect the manumission of the African, and  preserve the important branches of commerce, which necessity has allied  with the slave trade; and I entreat my readers to give this subject that  dispassionate consideration which its merits require, and beg to assure  them, that I obtrude my suggestions upon their notice with great submission  and diffidence, trusting that what may appear in my system deficient,  others more competent will embrace the subject, and excite the beneficence  of my country in behalf of the African, promote civilization and Christian  society in his country, display its arcana of wealth to the world, and open  a path to its commerce, free and unobscured.    The colonization of the coast of Africa, in my estimation, is  impracticable, from its climate being uncongenial to the constitution of  Europeans, and from the system of slavery existing among its inhabitants,  without the employment of natives in their present condition. The requisite  authority to establish a system of labour, upon remunerative principles,  and with industrious vigour, cannot otherwise be supported; and a  misapprehension on this principle has been one of the great causes, as I  conceive, of the failure of the Sierra Leone Company in establishing their  agricultural objects. They attempted, in prosecution of their humane  project, an agricultural establishment on the Boolam shore, opposite to  their colony, where they had a choice of good lands: they proceeded upon  the principles of their declaration, \"that the military, personal, and  commercial rights of blacks and whites shall be the same, and secured in  the same manner,\" and in conformity with the act of parliament which  incorporated them, more immediately that clause which relates to labour,  namely, \"not to employ any person or persons in a state of slavery in the  service of the said Company;\" but they have totally failed; and in one of  their reports, among other reasons, it is acknowledged, that for want of  authority over the free natives whom they employed, their agricultural  establishment on the Boolam shore was unsuccessful. Let not those worthy  and truly respectable characters, whose humanity has induced them to risque  an extensive property _unhappily expended without effect_, here consider  that I mean to militate against their views, but rather may they acquiesce  in the truth, and devise other expedients to promote their beneficent  objects, and to _assimilate the natives_ of the country with their views.  They have not only to lament a nonproductive profusion of their property,  but an _alienation of the natives_, occasioned by a misconception of their  character, by distracted councils, and the narrowed ideas of the agents  they employed to prosecute their humane endeavours, but also by a desolate  waste in their colony, without a regular feature of cultivation in its  vicinity.    At Bance Island, where slavery and agriculture were united under one  superintendance in conformity with the established laws of the country, the  mechanic arts among the natives have arrived at a greater degree of  perfection than any situation I have visited upon the Windward Coast; and  had the intellectual powers of their minds been more amply considered and  cultivated, they would have exhibited an uncontrovertible example of the  capacity and intelligence of the African. Although, as I have previously  noticed, a superintendance directed only to the mechanical arts, applied to  the local necessities of the Island, has had the most visible effects, yet,  in proportion as their privileges have been extended, authority has become  more inefficient, and their labour less unproductive in a pecuniary point  of view, for want of a previous enlargement of their intellectual powers,  and a progressive operation of freedom commensurate thereto.    I can bestow no panegyric adequate to the sense I entertain of that active  goodness which prompted the Directors of the Sierra Leone Company to the  undertaking I have alluded to; but with all due deference I conceive that  they have mistaken the practicable grounds, upon which the seeds of  civilization, and the principles of Christianity, can be effectively  displayed to the African. The Directors had to contend with a peculiar  co-mixture of passions, licentious habits, and hereditary vice; to  eradicate these, and to rescue the natives from their natural state,  alluring and progressive measures were necessary, founded upon an accurate  investigation of their characters and policy, and not by the fulminations  of intemperate zealots, and theoretical speculators. The beneficent views  of the Sierra Leone Company have been unaccountably perverted, and have  been the distorted instruments in prolonging, rather than extirpating, the  barbarism of the African: it is therefore a subject of great regret to the  benevolent supporters of this establishment, that an unprofitable  expenditure of their property is the only existing perpetuity of their  humane interference. Will it be found that the Company's agents have  introduced the arts of civilization among any tribe or nation in Africa,  that they have made any progress in agriculture, although possessing a very  extensive tract of fertile lands, or that they have converted them into any  of the regular features of cultivation? Have they explored or brought into  action any of the attainable and lucrative branches of natural commerce,  abounding in the region they inhabit, or do they employ a single ship in a  regular trade with the mother country? Will it be found that they have  unfolded the doctrines of Christianity, in their native purity and  simplicity, to the unenlightened African, or converted, by their preaching  and example, any tribe or nation among them?--The spacious waste is  destitute of the appearance of domestic industry, or respectable character;  it exhibits only a tissue of indolence, hypocritical grimace, petulant and  assuming manners, and all the consequences of idleness and corrupted  morals. To succeed in this beneficent undertaking, and to expunge the  inveterate nature of the African, his prejudices, and inherent customs,  progressive approaches upon his present condition are indispensibly  requisite, under the attractive influence of agriculture, manufactures,  commerce, and navigation.    Accidental events, concurring with political causes, frequently render the  best concerted measures abortive, and retard their progress, but  unquestionably the above-mentioned are the means by which the African may  be manumitted, and his condition improved. The wisest laws operate but  slowly upon a rude and fierce people, therefore the measures of reformation  are not to be successfully performed by a coup-de-main, nor are the  hereditary customs of Africa to be erased by the inflammatory declamations  of enthusiasm, but by a liberal policy and the ascendency of the polished  arts of society. Commerce, the chief means of assembling, and agriculture  of assimilating, mankind, must first assume their fascinating and alluring  attitudes to the African upon his native plains. Too impetuous and indolent  to observe the forms, or enter into the requisite details of business, he  contemplates the effect, without investigating the cause; but, when he  discovers his own comparative wretchedness, he will be roused from his  innate indolence, his powers will be stimulated, and his emulation excited  to attain a more exalted state.    Imperceptible and circumspect approach at innovation upon the laws,  customs, and country of Africa are indispensibly requisite, its chiefs and  head men must be cajoled, their jealousies dextrously allayed, and their  sordid avarice flattered by the prospect of superior gain.    During the infancy of colonization, the employment of native labour must be  tolerated, as is evident by the unsuccessful attempts of the Sierra Leone  Company, and may appear from what I have already urged. Independent of  political considerations, of much weight, the uncongeniality of the climate  of Africa to the constitution of the European colonist opposes an  insurmountable barrier to the exercise of laborious avocations; therefore  it is necessary to employ natives, in conformity with the usage of the  country; and a recognition of property should exist in their persons; for  it is obvious, from experiment, that authority cannot otherwise be  established, or the necessary labour performed to produce an adequate  return. While this invidious exigency obstructs the immediate manumission  of the slave, it does not the less accelerate it, agreeable to the sound  and humane policy adapted to his condition; but, on the contrary, is  necessary to his complete emancipation; for he must first be taught the  nature of the blessings of freedom, his intellectual faculties must be  expanded, and the veil of barbarism gradually removed, to prepare him to  participate in its enjoyment.    The system of colonization which I, with all submission, submit to the  legislature, and to my country, is this:    1st. To employ natives in whom a recognition of property shall exist, as  unavoidable from the present condition of Africa.    2d. To procure them from as wide an extent of the most powerful nations and  tribes upon the sea coast, as is practicable, and from the Slatees or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12545"],[0,"Traditions of the Tinguian: a Study in Philippine Folk-Lore (#15)"],[1," take Aponibolinayen to Adasin,\" said Aponibalagen. Soon  it became morning and they all went to Adasin and Gimbagonan carried  two big baskets of cakes, and while they were walking she ate all  the time and she ate half of them. When they arrived at the spring of  Gawigawen of Adasin, they were surprised, for it was very beautiful  and its sands were of beads, and the grass they used to clean pots with  was also beads and the place where the jars sat was a big dish. [153]    \"Go and tell Gawigawen that he must come here and bring an old man,  for I am going to take his head and make a spring for Aponibolinayen,\"  said Aponibalagen. So someone went and told Gawigawen to bring the  old man Taodan with him to the spring. So Aponibalagen cut off his  head and he made a spring and the water from it bubbled up and the  body became a big tree called Alangigan [154] which used to shade  Aponibolinayen when she went to the spring to dip water, and the blood  of the old man was changed to valuable beads. Not long after they went  up to the town and the place where they walked--from the spring to  the ladder of the house--was all big plates. Gimbagonan sat below the  house ladder, because they were afraid the house could not hold her,  for she was a big woman, and she hated them and she said to Iwaginan,  \"Why do you put me here?\" \"We put you there because we are afraid that  you will break the house and give a bad sign to the boy and girl who  are to be married.\" [155]    Aponibolinayen covered her face all of the time and she sat down  in the middle of the house, for Indiapan said that she must not  uncover her face for her husband Gawigawen had three noses, and  she was afraid to look at him. [156] But Gawigawen was a handsome  man. Aponibolinayen believed what Indiapan had told her. Not long  after Dinawagan spread the string of agate beads along the floor where  Aponibolinayen sat. [157] After a month they were still there and  the people from the other towns wished to go home, and Aponibalagen  said to Aponibolinayen, \"Ala, be good to your husband and uncover  your face. We are going back home now.\" But Aponibolinayen would not  uncover her face. Not long after all the people went back to their  towns and Aponibolinayen's mother-in-law commanded her to go and  cook. She did not uncover her face, but always felt when she went  about, and when she had cooked, she refused to eat, but Gawigawen  and his father and mother ate. When Gawigawen went to Aponibolinayen  at night she changed to oil, and she did that every night, and they  put the carabao hides under her mat so the oil would not drop to the  ground. On the fifth night she used magic so that they could not see  her go out and she dropped her beads under the house and then she  became oil and dropped her body. So she went away and always walked  and Gawigawen looked for her, for a long time. He went to Natpangan  for he could not find her in any of the towns.    When Aponibolinayen was in the middle of the jungle she met a wild  rooster which was crowing. \"Where are you going Aponibolinayen?\" it  said to her. \"Why are you walking in the middle of the jungle?\" and  Aponibolinayen said, \"I came here for I am running away from my husband  for I do not want to be married to him for he has three noses.\" \"No,  Gawigawen is a handsome man. I often see him, for this is where he  comes often to snare chickens. Do not believe what Indiapan said to  you, for she is crazy,\" said the rooster. Not long after she walked  on and she reached the place of many big trees and the big monkey met  her and said, \"Where are you going, Aponibolinayen?\" And she answered,  \"Where are you going, you say. I am running away because I do not want  to marry Gawigawen.\" \"Why don't you wish to marry Gawigawen?\" \"Because  Indiapan told me he has three noses.\" The monkey laughed and said,  \"Do not believe that. Indiapan wants to marry Gawigawen herself. He  is a handsome man.\" Aponibolinayen walked on and soon she reached  a wide field and she did not know where she was. She stopped in the  middle of the field and she thought she would go on to the other side.    Not long after she reached the ocean and she sat down on a log and a  carabao came along. It passed often where she sat. Aponibolinayen  thought she would ride on the carabao, and she got on its back and  it took her to the other side of the ocean. When they reached the  other side Aponibolinayen saw a big orange tree with much fruit on  it. The carabao said, \"Wait here while I eat grass and I will return  soon.\" Aponibolinayen said, \"Yes,\" but the carabao went to the place  of the man who owned him and said, \"Come over here, for there is a good  toy for you.\" And Kadayadawan of Pintagayan said, \"What is it?\" \"Come,  hurry,\" said the carabao. So he combed his hair and oiled it and put  on his striped coat and his clout and belt, and he took his spear  and he rode on the carabao's back. Not long after Kadayadawan saw the  pretty girl in the orange tree and he said, \"How pretty she is!\" And  the carabao said, \"That is the toy I told you about.\"    When they reached the orange tree Aponibolinayen heard him when  he stuck his spear in the ground and she looked down and saw  a handsome man. \"Good morning, lady,\" he said. \"Good morning,\"  answered Aponibolinayen. Not long after they chewed betel-nut and  they told their names. \"My name is Kadayadawan of Pintagayan who is  the son of an _alan_.\" [158] \"My name is Aponibolinayen of Natpangan,  who is the daughter of Pagbokasan and Ebang, who is the sister of  Aponibalagen.\" Their betel-nut quids became agate beads and Kadayadawan  said to her, \"Ala, it is good for us to marry. I am going to take  you home.\" So he took her to his home and he was good to his carabao,  because it had found him a pretty woman. When they reached the house  he put her in a room, and the _Ati_ [159] commanded the soldiers to  call Kadayadawan. When they reached the yard of Kadayadawan's house  they called \"Good morning.\" And he looked out of the window and said,  \"What do you want?\" \"We came, because the king wants you and we came  to get you.\" So they started and went. When they arrived where the  king was, \"Why Kadayadawan have you a pretty girl in your house? Every  night I notice that your house appears as if it were burning.\" \"No,  I have not,\" answered Kadayadawan. \"I think you have, for I notice  the flames every night.\" \"No, I have not. Where would I find a pretty  woman?\" [160]    Not long after he went back home. When he reached home Aponibolinayen  said to him, \"It is best for us to make _Sayang_.\" [161] And  Kadayadawan asked, \"How do we make _Sayang_ by ourselves? Our  neighbors are all soldiers.\" \"Do not worry about that, I will see,\"  said Aponibolinayen. Not long after Kadayadawan took the betel-nuts and  they oiled them and they sent them to the towns of their relatives to  invite them to their _balaua_. The betel-nuts went. Aponibolinayen  told Kadayadawan to go and get _molave_ sticks. When he arrived  with them Aponibolinayen used magic and she said, \"I use magic so  that when I thrust the _molave_ stick in the ground it will become  a _balaua_.\" Not long after the stick became a _balaua_.    The betel-nuts arrived in Natpangan and said to Aponibalagen,  \"We came to call you, for Kadayadawan of Pintagayan is making  _balaua_.\" Aponibalagen said, \"How can we attend the _balaua_ when  we are searching for my sister?\" \"If you do not wish to come I will  grow on your knee.\" \"Go on my pig.\" So the betel-nut grew on the pig,  and it was so high the pig could not carry it and it squealed very  much. \"Ala, get off from the pig and we will come.\" So the betel-nut  got off and they started. \"All you people who live in the same town  come with me to attend the _balaua_ of Kadayadawan of Pintagayan.\" So  they went. They arrived at the same time as Gawigawen of Adasin and  they met near to the river. Not long after Kadayadawan saw them by  the river and he sent the betel-nuts to carry the people across the  river. When they were in the middle of the river Kadayadawan used  his power so that their old clothes, which they wore in mourning for  Aponibolinayen were taken off from them, and they were surprised,  for they did not know when their old clothes had been taken off.    When they reached the other side Aponibalagen said to the people who  lived with Kadayadawan. \"We are ashamed to come up into the town,  for we have no clothes.\" Then the betel-nuts told Kadayadawan and he  said, \"Ala, go and tell them that I will come and bring some clothes  for them.\" Not long after he arrived where they were and he gave  them some clothes to use. \"Ala, take these clothes and use them,  and come up to the town.\" But Aponibalagen and his companions were  ashamed. Kadayadawan urged them until they accepted the clothes.    Soon they reached the town and they danced and Iwaginan and  Nagten-ngeyan danced again and the water from the river went up into  the town and the fish bit her feet. Not long after that they stopped  dancing and Iwaginan made Gawigawen and Aponibolinayen dance. While  they were dancing Gawigawen watched Aponibolinayen, and when they  had danced around nine times Gawigawen seized her and put her in his  belt. [162] \"Why do you do that Gawigawen?\" said Kadayadawan to him,  and he threw his spear and Gawigawen fell down and Aponibolinayen  escaped and Kadayadawan put her in a room. As soon as he put her in the  room he went to bring Gawigawen back to life. Not long after he revived  him, \"Why did you do that, Gawigawen? I did not steal Aponibolinayen  from you.\" And Gawigawen said, \"Even if you did steal Aponibolinayen  from me, she was my wife and I could not find her until now. That  is why I put her in my belt, and Aponibalagen knows that she is my  wife.\" And Kadayadawan said, \"She is my wife now.\"    Not long after the _alan_ who took care of Kadayadawan told Langa-an  \"Kadayadawan is your son. I picked "]]]
