[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11212"],[0,"Modern India (#15)"],[1,"Mr. Fee, our consul at Bombay, we  received invitations to a Hindu wedding in high life. The groom  was a young widower, a merchant of wealth and important commercial  connections, a graduate of Elphinstone College, speaks English  fluently, and is a favorite with the foreign colony. The bride  was the daughter of a widow whose late husband was similarly  situated, a partner in a rich mercantile and commission house,  well known and respected. The family ate liberal in their views,  and the daughter has been educated at one of the American mission  schools, although they still adhere to Hinduism, their ancestral  religion. The groom's family are equally liberal, but, like many  prominent families of educated natives, do not have the moral  courage or the independence to renounce the faith in which they  were born. The inhabitants of India are the most conservative of  all peoples, and while an educated and progressive Hindu will  tell you freely that he does not believe in the gods and  superstitions of his fathers, and will denounce the Brahmins as  ignorant impostors, respect for public opinion will not permit  him to make an open declaration of his loss of faith. These two  families are examples, and when their sons and daughters are  married, or when they die, observe all the social and religious  customs of their race and preserve the family traditions unbroken.    The home of the bridegroom's family is an immense wooden house  in the native quarter, and when we reached it we had to pass  through a crowd of coolies that filled the street. The gate and  outside walls were gayly decorated with bunting and Japanese  lanterns, all ready to be lighted as soon as the sun went down.  A native orchestra was playing doleful music in one of the courts,  and a brass band of twenty pieces in military uniforms from the  barracks was waiting its turn. A hallway which leads to a large  drawing-room in the rear of the house was spread with scarlet  matting, the walls were hung with gay prints, and Japanese lanterns  were suspended from the ceiling at intervals of three or four  feet. The first room was filled with women and children eating  ices and sweetmeats. Men guests were not allowed to join them.  It was then half past four, and we were told that they had been  enjoying themselves in that innocent way since noon, and would  remain until late in the evening, for it was the only share they  could have in the wedding ceremonies. Hindu women and men cannot  mingle even on such occasions.    The men folks were in the large drawing-room, seated in rows  of chairs facing each other, with an aisle four or five feet  wide in the center. There were all sorts and conditions of men,  for the groom has a wide acquaintance and intimate friends among  Mohammedans, Jains, Parsees, Roman Catholics, Protestants and all  the many other religious in Bombay, and he invited them to his  marriage. Several foreign ladies were given seats in the place of  honor at the head of the room around a large gilt chair or throne  which stood in the center with a wreath of flowers carelessly  thrown over the back. There were two American missionaries and  their wives, a Jesuit priest and several English women.    [Illustration: NAUTCH DANCERS]    Soon after we were seated there was a stir on the outside and  the groom appeared arrayed in the whitest of white linen robes,  a turban of white and gold silk, an exquisite cashmere shawl over  his shoulders, and a string of diamonds around his neck that  were worth a rajah's ransom. His hands were adorned with several  handsome rings, including one great emerald set in diamonds, so  big that you could see it across the room. Around his neck was  a garland of marigolds that fell to his waist, and he carried a  big bridal bouquet in his hand. As soon as he was seated a group  of nautch dancers, accompanied by a native orchestra, appeared  and performed one of their melancholy dances. The nautches may be  very wicked, but they certainly are not attractive in appearance.  Their dances are very much like an exercise in the Delsarte method  of elocution, being done with the arms more than with the legs,  and consisting of slow, graceful gesticulations such as a dreamy  poet might use when he soliloquizes to the stars. There is nothing  sensuous or suggestive in them. The movements are no more immodest  than knitting or quilting a comfortable--and are just about as  exciting. Each dance is supposed to be a poem expressed by gesture  and posturing--the poetry of motion--a sentimental pantomime,  and imaginative Hindus claim to be able to follow the story.  The orchestra, playing several queer looking fiddles, drums,  clarinets and other instruments, is employed to assist in the  interpretation, and produces the most dreary and monotonous sounds  without the slightest trace of theme or melody or rhythm. While I  don't want to be irreverent, they reminded me of a slang phrase  you hear in the country about \"the tune the old cow died of.\"  Hindu music is worse than that you hear in China or Japan, because  it is so awfully solemn and slow. The Chinese and Japanese give  you a lot of noise if they lack harmony, but when a Hindu band  reaches a fortissimo passage it sounds exactly as if some child  were trying to play a bagpipe for the first time.    When I made an observation concerning the apparent innocence  and unattractiveness of the nautch girls to a missionary lady  who sat in the next seat, she looked horrified, and admonished  me in a whisper that, while there was nothing immodest in the  performance, they were depraved, deceitful and dissolute creatures,  arrayed in gorgeous raiment for the purpose of enticing men. And  it is certainly true that they were clad in the most dazzling  costumes of gold brocades and gauzy stuffs that floated like  clouds around their heads and shoulders, and their ears, noses,  arms, ankles, necks, fingers and toes were all loaded with jewelry.    But their costumes were not half as gay as those worn by some  of the gentlemen guests. The Parsees wore black or white with  closely buttoned frocks and caps that look like fly-traps; the  Mohammedans wore flowing robes of white, and the Hindus silks  of the liveliest patterns and the most vivid colors. No ballroom  belle ever was enveloped by brighter tinted fabrics than the silks,  satins, brocades and velvets that were worn by the dignified  Hindu gentlemen at this wedding, and their jewels were such as  our richest women wear. A Hindu gentleman in full dress must  have a necklace, an aigrette of diamonds, a sunburst in front  of his turban, and two or three brooches upon his shoulders or  breast. And all this over bare legs and bare feet. They wear  slippers or sandals out of doors, but leave them in the hallway  or in the vestibule, and cross the threshold of the house in  naked feet. The bridegroom was bare legged, but had a pair of  embroidered slippers on his feet, because he was soon to take  a long walk and could not very well stop to put them on without  sacrificing appearances.    They brought us trays of native refreshments, while the nautch girls  danced, handed each guest a nosegay and placed a pair of cocoanuts  at his feet, which had some deep significance--I could not quite  understand what. The groom did not appear to be enjoying himself.  He looked very unhappy. He evidently did not like to sit up in a  gilded chair so that everybody could stare and make remarks about  him, for that is exactly what his guests were doing, criticising  his bare legs, commenting upon his jewels and guessing how much  his diamond necklace cost. He was quite relieved when a couple  of gentlemen, who seemed to be acting as masters of ceremonies,  placed a second garland of flowers around his neck--which one  of them whispered to me had just come from the bride, the first  one having been the gift of his mother--and led him out of the  room like a lamb to the slaughter.    When we reached the street a procession of the guests of honor  was formed, while policemen drove the crowd back. First came  the military band, then the masters of ceremonies--each having  a cane in his hand, with which he motioned back the crowd that  lined the road on both sides six or eight tiers deep. Then the  groom marched all alone with a dejected look on his face, and  his hands clasped before him. After him came the foreign guests,  two and two, as long as they were able to keep the formation,  but after going a hundred feet the crowd became so great and  were so anxious to see all that was going on, that they broke  the line and mixed up with the wedding party, and even surrounded  the solitary groom like a bodyguard, so that we who were coming  directly after could scarcely see him. The noisy music of the  band had aroused the entire neighborhood, and in the march to  the residence of the bride's family we passed between thousands  of spectators. The groom was exceedingly nervous. Although night  had fallen and the temperature was quite cool, the perspiration  was rolling down his face in torrents, and he was relieved when we  entered a narrow passage which bad been cleared by the policemen.    The bride's house was decorated in the same manner as the groom's,  and upon a tray in the middle of a big room a small slow fire of  perfumed wood was burning. The groom was led to the side of it,  and stood there, while the guests were seated around him--hooded  Hindu women on one side and men and foreign ladies on the other.  Then his trainers made him sit down on the floor, cross-legged,  like a tailor. Hindus seldom use chairs, or even cushions. Very  soon four Brahmins, or priests, appeared from somewhere in the  background and seated themselves on the opposite side of the  fire. They wore no robes, and were only half dressed. Two were  naked to the waist, as well as barefooted and barelegged. One,  who had his head shaved like a prize fighter and seemed to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11224"],[0,"Utilitarianism (#15)"],[1,"his consent, for other people's benefit.  The second relies on the acknowledged justice of self-defence, and the  admitted injustice of forcing one person to conform to another's notions  of what constitutes his good. The Owenite invokes the admitted  principle, that it is unjust to punish any one for what he cannot help.  Each is triumphant so long as he is not compelled to take into  consideration any other maxims of justice than the one he has selected;  but as soon as their several maxims are brought face to face, each  disputant seems to have exactly as much to say for himself as the  others. No one of them can carry out his own notion of justice without  trampling upon another equally binding. These are difficulties; they  have always been felt to be such; and many devices have been invented to  turn rather than to overcome them. As a refuge from the last of the  three, men imagined what they called the freedom of the will; fancying  that they could not justify punishing a man whose will is in a  thoroughly hateful state, unless it be supposed to have come into that  state through no influence of anterior circumstances. To escape from the  other difficulties, a favourite contrivance has been the fiction of a  contract, whereby at some unknown period all the members of society  engaged to obey the laws, and consented to be punished for any  disobedience to them; thereby giving to their legislators the right,  which it is assumed they would not otherwise have had, of punishing  them, either for their own good or for that of society. This happy  thought was considered to get rid of the whole difficulty, and to  legitimate the infliction of punishment, in virtue of another received  maxim of justice, _volenti non fit injuria_; that is not unjust which is  done with the consent of the person who is supposed to be hurt by it. I  need hardly remark, that even if the consent were not a mere fiction,  this maxim is not superior in authority to the others which it is  brought in to supersede. It is, on the contrary, an instructive specimen  of the loose and irregular manner in which supposed principles of  justice grow up. This particular one evidently came into use as a help  to the coarse exigencies of courts of law, which are sometimes obliged  to be content with very uncertain presumptions, on account of the  greater evils which would often arise from any attempt on their part to  cut finer. But even courts of law are not able to adhere consistently to  the maxim, for they allow voluntary engagements to be set aside on the  ground of fraud, and sometimes on that of mere mistake or  misinformation.    Again, when the legitimacy of inflicting punishment is admitted, how  many conflicting conceptions of justice come to light in discussing the  proper apportionment of punishment to offences. No rule on this subject  recommends itself so strongly to the primitive and spontaneous sentiment  of justice, as the _lex talionis_, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a  tooth. Though this principle of the Jewish and of the Mahomedan law has  been generally abandoned in Europe as a practical maxim, there is, I  suspect, in most minds, a secret hankering after it; and when  retribution accidentally falls on an offender in that precise shape, the  general feeling of satisfaction evinced, bears witness how natural is  the sentiment to which this repayment in kind is acceptable. With many  the test of justice in penal infliction is that the punishment should be  proportioned to the offence; meaning that it should be exactly measured  by the moral guilt of the culprit (whatever be their standard for  measuring moral guilt): the consideration, what amount of punishment is  necessary to deter from the offence, having nothing to do with the  question of justice, in their estimation: while there are others to whom  that consideration is all in all; who maintain that it is not just, at  least for man, to inflict on a fellow creature, whatever may be his  offences, any amount of suffering beyond the least that will suffice to  prevent him from repeating, and others from imitating, his misconduct.    To take another example from a subject already once referred to. In a  co-operative industrial association, is it just or not that talent or  skill should give a title to superior remuneration? On the negative side  of the question it is argued, that whoever does the best he can,  deserves equally well, and ought not in justice to be put in a position  of inferiority for no fault of his own; that superior abilities have  already advantages more than enough, in the admiration they excite, the  personal influence they command, and the internal sources of  satisfaction attending them, without adding to these a superior share of  the world's goods; and that society is bound in justice rather to make  compensation to the less favoured, for this unmerited inequality of  advantages, than to aggravate it. On the contrary side it is contended,  that society receives more from the more efficient labourer; that his  services being more useful, society owes him a larger return for them;  that a greater share of the joint result is actually his work, and not  to allow his claim to it is a kind of robbery; that if he is only to  receive as much as others, he can only be justly required to produce as  much, and to give a smaller amount of time and exertion, proportioned to  his superior efficiency. Who shall decide between these appeals to  conflicting principles of justice? Justice has in this case two sides to  it, which it is impossible to bring into harmony, and the two disputants  have chosen opposite sides; the one looks to what it is just that the  individual should receive, the other to what it is just that the  community should give. Each, from his own point of view, is  unanswerable; and any choice between them, on grounds of justice, must  be perfectly arbitrary. Social utility alone can decide the preference.    How many, again, and how irreconcileable, are the standards of justice  to which reference is made in discussing the repartition of taxation.  One opinion is, that payment to the State should be in numerical  proportion to pecuniary means. Others think that justice dictates what  they term graduated taxation; taking a higher percentage from those who  have more to spare. In point of natural justice a strong case might be  made for disregarding means altogether, and taking the same absolute sum  (whenever it could be got) from every one: as the subscribers to a mess,  or to a club, all pay the same sum for the same privileges, whether they  can all equally afford it or not. Since the protection (it might be  said) of law and government is afforded to, and is equally required by,  all, there is no injustice in making all buy it at the same price. It is  reckoned justice, not injustice, that a dealer should charge to all  customers the same price for the same article, not a price varying  according to their means of payment. This doctrine, as applied to  taxation, finds no advocates, because it conflicts strongly with men's  feelings of humanity and perceptions of social expediency; but the  principle of justice which it invokes is as true and as binding as those  which can be appealed to against it. Accordingly, it exerts a tacit  influence on the line of defence employed for other modes of assessing  taxation. People feel obliged to argue that the State does more for the  rich than for the poor, as a justification for its taking more from  them: though this is in reality not true, for the rich would be far  better able to protect themselves, in the absence of law or government,  than the poor, and indeed would probably be successful in converting the  poor into their slaves. Others, again, so far defer to the same  conception of justice, as to maintain that all should pay an equal  capitation tax for the protection of their persons (these being of equal  value to all), and an unequal tax for the protection of their property,  which is unequal. To this others reply, that the all of one man is as  valuable to him as the all of another. From these confusions there is no  other mode of extrication than the utilitarian.           *       *       *       *       *    Is, then, the difference between the Just and the Expedient a merely  imaginary distinction? Have mankind been under a delusion in thinking  that justice is a more sacred thing than policy, and that the latter  ought only to be listened to after the former has been satisfied? By no  means. The exposition we have given of the nature and origin of the  sentiment, recognises a real distinction; and no one of those who  profess the most sublime contempt for the consequences of actions as an  element in their morality, attaches more importance to the distinction  than I do. While I dispute the pretensions of any theory which sets up  an imaginary standard of justice not grounded on utility, I account the  justice which is grounded on utility to be the chief part, and  incomparably the most sacred and binding part, of all morality. Justice  is a name for certain classes of moral rules, which concern the  essentials of human well-being more nearly, and are therefore of more  absolute obligation, than any other rules for the guidance of life; and  the notion which we have found to be of the essence of the idea of  justice, that of a right residing in an individual, implies and  testifies to this more binding obligation.    The moral rules which forbid mankind to hurt one another (in which we  must never forget to include wrongful interference with each other's  freedom) are more vital to human well-being than any maxims, however  important, which only point out the best mode of managing some  department of human affairs. They have also the peculiarity, that they  are the main element in determining the whole of the social feelings of  mankind. It is their observance which alone"]]]
