In fact, so little was written by Southern women, high or  low, of the colonial period that it is practically impossible to state  anything positive about their intellectual training. It is a safe  conjecture, however, that the schooling of the average woman in the  South was not equal to that of the average women of Massachusetts, but  was probably fully equal to that of the Dutch women of New York. And yet  we must not think that efforts in education in the southern colonies  were lacking. As Dr. Lyon G. Tyler has said; \"Under the conditions of  Virginia society, no developed educational system was possible, but it  is wrong to suppose that there was none. The parish institutions  introduced from England included educational beginnings; every minister  had a school, and it was the duty of the vestry to see that all poor  children could read and write. The county courts supervised the  vestries, and held a yearly 'orphans court,' which looked after the  material and educational welfare of all orphans.\"[54]    Indeed the interest in education during the seventeenth century, in  Virginia at least, seems to have been general. Repeatedly in examining  wills of the period we may find this interest expressed and explicit  directions given for educating not only the boys, but the girls. Bruce  in his valuable work, _Institutional History of Virginia in the  Seventeenth Century_, cites a number of such cases in which provisions  were made for the training of daughters of other female relatives.    \"In 1657, Clement Thresh, of Rappahannock, in his will declared that all  his estate should be responsible for the outlay made necessary in  providing, during three years, instruction for his step-daughter, who,  being then thirteen years of age, had, no doubt, already been going to  school for some length of time. The manner of completing her education  (which, it seems, was to be prolonged to her sixteenth year) was perhaps  the usual one for girls at this period:--she was to be taught at a Mrs.  Peacock's, very probably by Mrs. Peacock herself, who may have been the  mistress of a small school; for it was ordered in the will, that if she  died, the step-daughter was to attend the same school as Thomas  Goodrich's children.\"[55] \"Robert Gascoigne provided that his wife  should ... keep their daughter Bridget in school, until she could both  read and sew with an equal degree of skill.\"[56] \"The indentures of Ann  Andrewes, who lived in Surry ... required her master to teach her, not  only how to sew and 'such things as were fitt for women to know,' but  also how to read and apparently also how to write.\" ... \"In 1691 a girl  was bound out to Captain William Crafford ... under indentures which  required him to teach her how to spin, sew and read....\"[57]    But, as shown in previous pages, female illiteracy in the South, at  least during the seventeenth century, was surprisingly great. No doubt,  in the eighteenth century, as the country became more thickly settled,  education became more general, but for a long time the women dragged  behind the men in plain reading and writing. Bruce declares: \"There are  numerous evidences that illiteracy prevailed to a greater extent than  among persons of the opposite sex.... Among the entire female population  of the colony, without embracing the slaves, only one woman of every  three was able to sign her name in full, as compared with at least three  of every five persons of the opposite sex.\"[58]      _III. Brilliant Exceptions_    In the middle colonies, as in New England, schools for all classes were  established at an early date. Thus, the first school in Pennsylvania was  opened in 1683, only one year after the founding of Philadelphia, and  apparently very few children in that city were without schooling of some  sort. As is commonly agreed, more emphasis was placed on education in  New England than in any of the other colonies. A large number of the men  who established the Northern colonies were university graduates,  naturally interested in education, and the founding of Harvard, sixteen  years after the landing at Plymouth, proves this interest. Moreover, it  was considered essential that every man, woman, and child should be able  to read the Bible, and for this reason, if for no other, general  education would have been encouraged. As Moses Coit Tyler has declared,  \"Theirs was a social structure with its corner stone resting on a book.\"  However true this may be, we are not warranted in assuming that the  women of the better classes in Massachusetts were any more thoroughly  educated, according to the standards of the time, than the women of the  better classes in other colonies. We do indeed find more New England  women writing; for here lived the first female poet in America, and the  first woman preacher, and thinkers of the Mercy Warren type who show in  their diaries and letters a keen and intelligent interest in public  affairs.    It seems due, however, more to circumstances that such women as Mercy  Warren and Abigail Adams wrote much, while their sisters to the South  remained comparatively silent. The husband of each of these two colonial  dames was absent a great deal and these men were, therefore, the  recipients of many charming letters now made public; while the wife of  the better class planter in Virginia and the Carolinas had a husband who  seldom strayed long from the plantation. Eliza Pinckney's letters rival  in interest those of any American woman of the period, and if her  husband had been a man as prominent in war and political affairs as John  Adams, her letters would no doubt be considered today highly valuable.  True, Martha Washington was in a position to leave many interesting  written comments; for she was for many years close to the very center  and origin of the most exciting events; but she was more of a quiet  housewife than a woman who enjoyed the discussion of political events,  and, besides, with a certain inborn reserve and reticence she took pains  to destroy much of the private correspondence between her husband and  herself. Perhaps, with the small amount of evidence at hand we can never  say definitely in what particular colonies the women of the higher  classes were most highly educated; apparently very few of them were in  danger of receiving an over-dose of mental stimulation.    A few women, however, were genuinely interested in cultural study, and  that too in subjects of an unusual character. Hear what Eliza Pinckney  says in her letters:    \"I have got no further than the first volm of Virgil, but was most  agreeably disappointed to find myself instructed in agriculture as well  as entertained by his charming penn, for I am persuaded tho' he wrote  for Italy it will in many Instances suit Carolina.\"[59] \"If you will not  laugh too immoderately at mee I'll Trust you with a Secrett. I have made  two wills already! I know I have done no harm, for I con'd my lesson  very perfectly, and know how to convey by will, Estates, Real and  Personal, and never forgett in its proper place, him and his heirs  forever.... But after all what can I do if a poor Creature lies a-dying,  and their family takes it into their head that I can serve them. I can't  refuse; butt when they are well, and able to employ a Lawyer, I always  shall.\"[60]    And again she gives this glimpse of another study: \"I am a very Dunce,  for I have not acquired ye writing shorthand yet with any degree of  swiftness.\" That she had made some study of philosophy also is evident  in this comment in a letter written after a prolonged absence from her  plantation home for the purpose of attending some social function: \"I  began to consider what attraction there was in this place that used so  agreeably to soothe my pensive humour, and made me indifferent to  everything the gay world could boast; but I found the change not in the  place but in myself.... and I was forced to consult Mr. Locke over and  over, to see wherein personal Identity consisted, and if I was the very  same Selfe.\"[61]    Locke's philosophical theory is surely rather solid material, a kind  indeed which probably not many college women of the twentieth century  are familiar with. Add to these various intellectual pursuits of hers  the highly thorough study she made of agriculture, her genuinely  scientific experiments in the rotation and selection of crops, and her  practical and successful management of three large plantations, and we  may well conclude that here was a colonial woman with a mind of her own,  and a mind fit for something besides feminine trifles and graces.    Jane Turell, a resident of Boston during the first half of the  eighteenth century, was another whose interest in literature and other  branches of higher education was certainly not common to the women of  the period. Hear the narrative of the rather astonishing list of studies  she undertook, and the zeal with which she pursued her research:         \"Before she had seen eighteen, she had read, and 'in some       measure' digested all the English poetry and polite pieces in       prose, printed and manuscripts, in her father's well furnished       library.... She had indeed such a thirst after knowledge that the       leisure of the day did not suffice, but she spent whole nights in       reading....\"         \"I find she was sometimes fired with a laudable ambition of       raising the honor of her sex, who are therefore under obligations       to her; and all will be ready to own she had a fine genius, and       is to be placed among those who have excelled.\"         \"...What greatly contributed to increase her knowledge, in       divinity, history, physic, controversy, as well as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15489"],[0,"Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners (#15)"],[1,"purpose of the dream that this brother should  remain in the right; and she does not try to justify this brother merely  in the dream; it is her purpose in life and the motive for her being  ill.    The other motive for counter wish-dreams is so clear that there is  danger of overlooking it, as for some time happened in my own case. In  the sexual make-up of many people there is a masochistic component,  which has arisen through the conversion of the aggressive, sadistic  component into its opposite. Such people are called \"ideal\" masochists,  if they seek pleasure not in the bodily pain which may be inflicted upon  them, but in humiliation and in chastisement of the soul. It is obvious  that such persons can have counter wish-dreams and disagreeable dreams,  which, however, for them are nothing but wish-fulfillment, affording  satisfaction for their masochistic inclinations. Here is such a dream. A  young man, who has in earlier years tormented his elder brother, towards  whom he was homosexually inclined, but who had undergone a complete  change of character, has the following dream, which consists of three  parts: (1) _He is \"insulted\" by his brother._ (2) _Two adults are  caressing each other with homosexual intentions._ (3) _His brother has  sold the enterprise whose management the young man reserved for his own  future._ He awakens from the last-mentioned dream with the most  unpleasant feelings, and yet it is a masochistic wish-dream, which might  be translated: It would serve me quite right if my brother were to make  that sale against my interest, as a punishment for all the torments  which he has suffered at my hands.    I hope that the above discussion and examples will suffice--until  further objection can be raised--to make it seem credible that even  dreams with a painful content are to be analyzed as the fulfillments of  wishes. Nor will it seem a matter of chance that in the course of  interpretation one always happens upon subjects of which one does not  like to speak or think. The disagreeable sensation which such dreams  arouse is simply identical with the antipathy which endeavors--usually  with success--to restrain us from the treatment or discussion of such  subjects, and which must be overcome by all of us, if, in spite of its  unpleasantness, we find it necessary to take the matter in hand. But  this disagreeable sensation, which occurs also in dreams, does not  preclude the existence of a wish; every one has wishes which he would  not like to tell to others, which he does not want to admit even to  himself. We are, on other grounds, justified in connecting the  disagreeable character of all these dreams with the fact of dream  disfigurement, and in concluding that these dreams are distorted, and  that the wish-fulfillment in them is disguised until recognition is  impossible for no other reason than that a repugnance, a will to  suppress, exists in relation to the subject-matter of the dream or in  relation to the wish which the dream creates. Dream disfigurement,  then, turns out in reality to be an act of the censor. We shall take  into consideration everything which the analysis of disagreeable dreams  has brought to light if we reword our formula as follows: _The dream is  the (disguised) fulfillment of a (suppressed, repressed) wish_.    Now there still remain as a particular species of dreams with painful  content, dreams of anxiety, the inclusion of which under dreams of  wishing will find least acceptance with the uninitiated. But I can  settle the problem of anxiety dreams in very short order; for what they  may reveal is not a new aspect of the dream problem; it is a question in  their case of understanding neurotic anxiety in general. The fear which  we experience in the dream is only seemingly explained by the dream  content. If we subject the content of the dream to analysis, we become  aware that the dream fear is no more justified by the dream content than  the fear in a phobia is justified by the idea upon which the phobia  depends. For example, it is true that it is possible to fall out of a  window, and that some care must be exercised when one is near a window,  but it is inexplicable why the anxiety in the corresponding phobia is so  great, and why it follows its victims to an extent so much greater than  is warranted by its origin. The same explanation, then, which applies to  the phobia applies also to the dream of anxiety. In both cases the  anxiety is only superficially attached to the idea which accompanies it  and comes from another source.    On account of the intimate relation of dream fear to neurotic fear,  discussion of the former obliges me to refer to the latter. In a little  essay on \"The Anxiety Neurosis,\"[6] I maintained that neurotic fear has  its origin in the sexual life, and corresponds to a libido which has  been turned away from its object and has not succeeded in being applied.  From this formula, which has since proved its validity more and more  clearly, we may deduce the conclusion that the content of anxiety dreams  is of a sexual nature, the libido belonging to which content has been  transformed into fear.    [1] To sit for the painter. Goethe: \"And if he has no backside, how can  the nobleman sit?\"    [2] I myself regret the introduction of such passages from the  psychopathology of hysteria, which, because of their fragmentary  representation and of being torn from all connection with the subject,  cannot have a very enlightening influence. If these passages are capable  of throwing light upon the intimate relations between the dream and the  psychoneuroses, they have served the purpose for which I have taken them  up.    [3] Something like the smoked salmon in the dream of the deferred  supper.    [4] It often happens that a dream is told incompletely, and that a  recollection of the omitted portions appear only in the course of the  analysis. These portions subsequently fitted in, regularly furnish the  key to the interpretation. _Cf._ below, about forgetting in dreams.    [5] Similar \"counter wish-dreams\" have been repeatedly reported to me  within the last few years by my pupils who thus reacted to their first  encounter with the \"wish theory of the dream.\"    [6] See _Selected Papers on Hysteria and other Psychoneuroses_, p. 133,  translated by A.A. Brill, _Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases_,  Monograph Series.          V    SEX IN DREAMS      The more one is occupied with the solution of dreams, the more willing  one must become to acknowledge that the majority of the dreams of adults  treat of sexual material and give expression to erotic wishes. Only one  who really analyzes dreams, that is to say, who pushes forward from  their manifest content to the latent dream thoughts, can form an opinion  on this subject--never the person who is satisfied with registering the  manifest content (as, for example, Naecke in his works on sexual dreams).  Let us recognize at once that this fact is not to be wondered at, but  that it is in complete harmony with the fundamental assumptions of dream  explanation. No other impulse has had to undergo so much suppression  from the time of childhood as the sex impulse in its numerous  components, from no other impulse have survived so many and such intense  unconscious wishes, which now act in the sleeping state in such a manner  as to produce dreams. In dream interpretation, this significance of  sexual complexes must never be forgotten, nor must they, of course, be  exaggerated to the point of being considered exclusive.    Of many dreams it can be ascertained by a careful interpretation that  they are even to be taken bisexually, inasmuch as they result in an  irrefutable secondary interpretation in which they realize homosexual  feelings--that is, feelings that are common to the normal sexual  activity of the dreaming person. But that all dreams are to be  interpreted bisexually, seems to me to be a generalization as  indemonstrable as it is improbable, which I should not like to support.  Above all I should not know how to dispose of the apparent fact that  there are many dreams satisfying other than--in the widest sense--erotic  needs, as dreams of hunger, thirst, convenience, &c. Likewise the  similar assertions \"that behind every dream one finds the death  sentence\" (Stekel), and that every dream shows \"a continuation from the  feminine to the masculine line\" (Adler), seem to me to proceed far  beyond what is admissible in the interpretation of dreams.    We have already asserted elsewhere that dreams which are conspicuously  innocent invariably embody coarse erotic wishes, and we might confirm  this by means of numerous fresh examples. But many dreams which appear  indifferent, and which would never be suspected of any particular  significance, can be traced back, after analysis, to unmistakably sexual  wish-feelings, which are often of an unexpected nature. For example,  who would suspect a sexual wish in the following dream until the  interpretation had been worked out? The dreamer relates: _Between two  stately palaces stands a little house, receding somewhat, whose doors  are closed. My wife leads me a little way along the street up to the  little house, and pushes in the door, and then I slip quickly and easily  into the interior of a courtyard that slants obliquely upwards._    Any one who has had experience in the translating of dreams will, of  course, immediately perceive that penetrating into narrow spaces, and  opening locked doors, belong to the commonest sexual symbolism, and will  easily find in this dream a representation of attempted coition from  behind (between the two stately buttocks of the female body). The narrow  slanting passage is of course the vagina; the assistance attributed to  the wife of the dreamer requires the interpretation that in reality it  is only consideration for the wife which is responsible for the  detention from such an attempt.
