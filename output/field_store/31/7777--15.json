H. PROLIFICUM.--North America, 1758. This is a much branched twiggy  shrub, about 4 feet high, with small, linear-lanceolate leaves, thickly  studded with pellucid dots. Flowers not very large, five-petalled, and  of a pleasing bright yellow colour. The allied if not identical H.  Kalmiana is worthy of being included in a selection of these plants.    H. URALUM.--Nepaul, 1823. A neat but fragile species that attains to  about a yard in height. Leaves rather small, elliptic, almost stalkless,  and perforated with transparent dots. Flowers small and of a bright  golden yellow.    H. fasciculatum, H. pyrimidatum, and H. patulum are all worthy of  attention, where a good representative collection is of importance. The  Hypericums succeed best when planted in a rather sandy and not too dry  loam, and they are readily increased either from divisions or by means  of cuttings.      IDESIA.    IDESIA POLYCARPA (_syns Flacourtica japonica_ and _Polycarpa  Maximowiczii_).--A Japanese tree of small growth, and only introduced to  this country in 1866. It is a handsome, hardy species, bearing large,  bright-green leaves with conspicuous crimson footstalks, often 4 inches  across, and of a glaucous tint on the under sides. The deliciously  fragrant flowers are greenish-white or yellowish-green, and produced in  graceful drooping racemes. In southern England it does well, and, being  a tree of unusual beauty of both leaves and flowers, is well worthy of  attention. Rich loam, not too stiff, will grow the Idesia well.      ILEX.    ILEX AQUIFOLIUM.--Common Holly. Europe (Britain) and West Asia. Though  the Hollies are not usually reckoned ornamental for the sake of their  flowers, their berries are highly so. Some of them are nevertheless  deliciously fragrant when in bloom. The leaves of this, our native  species, in their typical form are oblong-ovate, wavy, and deeply  spiny-toothed. The tree flowers in May and June, while the clusters of  bright red berries ripen in autumn, persist all the winter, and  sometimes even hang on tree till a second crop is matured, provided they  are not devoured by birds during severe weather. The varieties are very  numerous, and differ chiefly in the form and toothing of the leaves,  which are variegated in many cases, their size and form, and in the  colour of the berries in a few instances.    I. Aquifolium albo-marginata has ovate, nearly flat, spiny-serrate  leaves, with a narrow silvery margin, and fruits freely. I. Aquifolium  fructu albo has white berries; in I. Aquifolium fructu luteo they are  yellow and very abundantly produced; and in I. Aquifolium fructu nigro  they are black. I. Aquifolium handsworthensis has elliptic-oblong spiny  leaves, with a creamy-white margin and marbled with gray. Grafted trees  bear berries in great profusion from the time they are only a foot high,  and are highly ornamental. I. Aquifolium Hodginsii has large, broadly  oblong-ovate, slightly spiny leaves, and large crimson-red berries that  ripen late in autumn. I. Aquifolium Hodginsii aurea is a sub-variety  with a broad golden margin to the leaves, and the disc splashed with  gray. Beautiful and distinct is I. Aquifolium Lawsoniana, with ovate,  flat, almost spineless leaves, heavily and irregularly blotched with  yellow in the centre. The berries are of a brilliant red. The variety  differs from Milkmaid in having flat, nearly entire leaves. I.  Aquifolium pendula has a wide, rounded, drooping head, but otherwise  does not differ from the type. Many others bear berries, but the above  are all very distinct forms.    I. OPACA.--American Holly. United States, 1744. The leaves of this  species are oblong or oval, small, spiny-serrate, and of a dark opaque  green. The berries, which ripen in autumn, are small, bright red, and  very liable to be eaten by birds. In America this Holly is put to  precisely the same purposes as the common Holly is in Europe. It is  perfectly hardy here.      ILLICIUM.    ILLICIUM FLORIDANUM, from Florida (1771), is a beautiful but uncommon  shrub, probably on account of its being tender and susceptible to injury  by frost, unless in the warmer and more favoured parts of the country.  The fragrant flowers are of a purplish-rose, while the foliage is neat  and of a pleasing green.    I. ANISATUM (_syn I. religiosum_), from China and Japan (1842), is too  tender for outdoor culture in this country.      INDIGOFERA.    INIDGOFERA GERARDIANA (_syns I. floribunda_ and _I. Dosua_).--India,  1842. This forms a compact dwarf bush in the open, but is still better  suited for covering a wall, the growth and floriferousness being then  much increased. The foliage is neat and Pea-green, while the bright pink  Pea-like flowers are produced in long racemes. It is a pretty bush, and  grows freely enough in any good garden soil, but very fine flowering  specimens may be seen in light, sandy soil of a peaty nature. There is a  white flowered variety named I. Gerardiana alba.      ITEA.    ITEA VIRGINICA.--North America, 1744. This is a neat, deciduous shrub of  3 feet or 4 feet in height. The ovate-lanceolate leaves are of a light  greyish-green, and the small white flowers are produced in dense racemes  or spikes. Planted in a somewhat shady place, and in rather cool, damp  soil, this little shrub does well and flowers profusely.      JAMESIA.    JAMESIA AMERICANA.--Rocky Mountains and Colorado, 1865. Amongst early  spring-flowering shrubs this pretty but neglected plant is one of the  best, of perfect hardihood, for it stands the vigour of our winters with  impunity, and of dense thick growth; it is suitable for using in a  variety of ways, as well as for purely ornamental purposes. The leaves  are oval and neatly dentated, and the flowers individually of large  size, pure white, and produced in terminal bunches. Cool soil and a  shady situation would seem to suit the plant admirably, but for screen  purposes in the rock garden or border it is invaluable on account of the  strong and dense twigs.      JASMINUM.    JASMINUM FRUTICANS.--South Europe, 1570. An evergreen species, well  adapted, from its rather stiff and upright growth, for planting alone.  It has trifoliolate leaves and showy yellow flowers.    J. HUMILE.--India, 1656. A hardy species of dwarf growth, and bearing  beautiful golden flowers produced in summer.    J. NUDIFLORUM.--Naked Jasmine. China, 1844. A showy and well-known  species, from China, with numerous, usually solitary yellow flowers,  ternate leaves, and flexible branches. The variety J. nudiflorum  aureo-variegatum has golden-variegated leaves.    J. OFFICINALE.--Northern India to Persia, 1548. The white-flowered  Jasmine of our gardens is a very beautiful and desirable clambering  shrub, either for wall covering, for planting by tree stumps, rooteries,  or rockeries, or for screening and draping the pergola or garden  latticework. From its great hardihood, vigour of growth, and beauty of  flowers, it is certainly one of the most deservedly popular of wall  shrubs. The branches are deep green, angular, and flexible, the leaves  pinnate, and the flowers pure-white and sweetly-scented. The variety J.  officinale affine has flowers that are individually larger than those of  the species; J. officinale aurea has badly variegated leaves; J.  officinale grandiflorum and J. officinale grandiflorum majus, are also  desirable kinds.    J. PUBIGERUM GLABRUM (_syn J. Wallichianum_), from North-west India, is  not well-known, being tender in most parts of the country.    J. REVOLUTUM.--India, 1812. This has persistent dark, glossy-green  leaves, and fragrant, bright yellow flowers, produced in large, terminal  clusters. From India, but perfectly hardy as a wall plant, and for which  purpose, with its bright evergreen leaves, it is well suited.    As regards soil, the Jasmines are very accommodating, and are propagated  by layers or cuttings.      KADSURA.    KADSURA JAPONICA.--Japan, 1846. This is a small-growing shrub, with  lanceolate and pointed leaves, that are remotely dentated. The flowers  are not very showy, being of a yellowish-white colour and about an inch  across. They are produced both terminal and axillary, and in fair  abundance. The scarlet fruits are arranged in clusters, and when fully  ripe are both showy and interesting. Generally speaking this shrub  suffers from severe frost, but as only the branch tips are injured, it  shoots freely from the stock. It produces its flowers in the autumn.  There is a variety with variegated leaves.      KALMIA.    KALMIA ANGUSTIFOLIA.--Sheep Laurel. Canada, 1736. This is at once  distinguished from K. latifolia by its much smaller and narrower leaves  and smaller flowers, which latter are, however, of brighter tint and  more plentifully produced. It rarely exceeds 2 feet in height. Of this  there are two very distinct forms, that named K. angustifolia pumila,  being of neat and dense small growth; and K. angustifolia rubra, in  which the flowers are of an unusually deep red.    K. GLAUCA.--Canada and Sitcha, 1767. This, which has lilac-purple  flowers, produced in early spring, is not a very desirable species,  being rather straggling of growth and with few flowers.    K. HIRSUTA.--Hairy-leaved Kalmia. South-east Virginia to Florida, 1786.  This is at once distinguished by the rather rough and hairy foliage and  few rosy-tinted flowers. It is of dwarf, neat growth.    K. LATIFOLIA.--Calico Bush, or Mountain Laurel. Alleghanies, Canada, and  Western Florida, 1734. A favourite shrub in every garden where the  conditions of soil will allow of its being successfully cultivated. In  peaty soil, or light, friable loam and leaf soil, it forms a dense,  round-headed bush, often 8 feet in height, and nearly as much through,  with pleasing green leaves, and dense clusters of beautiful pink,  wax-like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10885"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 1 (#15)"],[1,"as his acquaintance. Dante did not know him, for the  agony in his countenance. He was a man nicknamed Hog (Ciacco), and by no  other name does the poet, or any one else, mention him. His countryman  addressed him by it, though declaring at the same time that he wept to  see him. Hog prophesied evil to his discordant native city, adding  that there were but two just men in it--all the rest being given up to  avarice, envy, and pride. Dante inquired by name respecting the fate of  five other Florentines, _who had done good_, and was informed that they  were all, for various offences, _in lower gulfs of hell_. Hog then  begged that he would mention having seen him when he returned to the  sweet world; and so, looking at him a little, bent his head, and  disappeared among his blinded companions.    \"Satan! hoa, Satan!\" roared the demon Plutus, as the poets were  descending into the fourth circle.    \"Peace!\" cried Virgil, \"with thy swollen lip, thou accursed wolf. No one  can hinder his coming down. God wills it.\" [16]    Flat fell Plutus, collapsed, like the sails of a vessel when the mast is  split.    This circle was the most populous one they had yet come to. The  sufferers, gifted with supernatural might, kept eternally rolling round  it, one against another, with terrific violence, and so dashing apart,  and returning. \"Why grasp?\" cried the one--\"Why throw away?\" cried the  other; and thus exclaiming, they dashed furiously together.    They were the Avaricious and the Prodigal. Multitudes of them were  churchmen, including cardinals and popes. Not all the gold beneath the  moon could have purchased them a moment's rest. Dante asked if none of  them were to be recognised by their countenances. Virgil said, \"No;\" for  the stupid and sullied lives which they led on earth swept their faces  away from all distinction for ever.    In discoursing of fortune, they descend by the side of a torrent, black  as ink, into the fifth circle, or place of torment for the Angry, the  Sullen, and the Proud. Here they first beheld a filthy marsh, full of  dirty naked bodies, that in everlasting rage tore one another to pieces.  In a quieter division of the pool were seen nothing but bubbles, carried  by the ascent, from its slimy bottom, of the stifled words of the  sullen. They were always saying, \"We were sad and dark within us in the  midst of the sweet sunshine, and now we live sadly in the dark bogs.\"  The poets walked on till they came to the foot of a tower, which hung  out two blazing signals to another just discernible in the distance. A  boat came rapidly towards them, ferried by the wrathful Phlegyas;[17]  who cried out, \"Aha, felon! and so thou hast come at last!\"    \"Thou errest,\" said Virgil. \"We come for no longer time than it will  take thee to ferry us across thy pool.\"    Phlegyas looked like one defrauded of his right; but proceeded to convey  them. During their course a spirit rose out of the mire, looking Dante  in the face, and said, \"Who art thou, that comest before thy time?\"    \"Who art thou?\" said Dante.    \"Thou seest who I am,\" answered the other; \"one among the mourners.\"    \"Then mourn still, and howl, accursed spirit,\" returned the Florentine.  \"I know thee, all over filth as thou art.\"    The wretch in fury laid hold of the boat, but Virgil thrust him back,  exclaiming, \"Down with thee! down among the other dogs!\"    Then turning to Dante, he embraced and kissed him, saying, \"O soul, that  knows how to disdain, blessed be she that bore thee! Arrogant, truly,  upon earth was this sinner, nor is his memory graced by a single virtue.  Hence the furiousness of his spirit now. How many kings are there at  this moment lording it as gods, who shall wallow here, as he does, like  swine in the mud, and be thought no better of by the world!\" \"I should  like to see him smothering in it,\" said Dante, \"before we go.\"    \"A right wish,\" said Virgil, \"and thou shalt, to thy heart's content.\"    On a sudden the wretch's muddy companions seized and drenched him so  horribly that (exclaims Dante) \"I laud and thank God for it now at this  moment.\"    \"Have at him!\" cried they; \"have at Filippo Argenti;\" and the wild fool  of a Florentine dashed his teeth for rage into his own flesh.[18]    The poet's attention was now drawn off by a noise of lamentation, and  he perceived that he was approaching the city of Dis.[19] The turrets  glowed vermilion with the fire within it, the walls appeared to be of  iron, and moats were round about them. The boat circuited the walls till  the travellers came to a gate, which Phlegyas, with a loud voice, told  them to quit the boat and enter. But a thousand fallen angels crowded  over the top of the gate, refusing to open it, and making furious  gestures. At length they agreed to let Virgil speak with them inside;  and he left Dante for a while, standing in terror without. The parley  was in vain. They would not let them pass. Virgil, however, bade his  companion be of good cheer, and then stood listening and talking to  himself; disclosing by his words his expectation of some extraordinary  assistance, and at the same time his anxiety for its arrival. On a  sudden, three raging figures arose over the gate, coloured with gore.  Green hydras twisted about them; and their fierce temples had snakes  instead of hair.    \"Look,\" said Virgil. \"The Furies! The one on the left is Megaera; Alecto  is she that is wailing on the right; and in the middle is Tisiphone.\"  Virgil then hushed. The Furies stood clawing their breasts, smiting  their hands together, and raising such hideous cries, that Dante clung  to his friend.    \"Bring the Gorgon's head!\" cried the Furies, looking down; \"turn him to  adamant!\"    \"Turn round,\" said Virgil, \"and hide thy face; for if thou beholdest  the Gorgon, never again wilt thou see the light of day.\" And with these  words he seized Dante and turned him round himself, clapping his hands  over his companion's eyes.    And now was heard coming over the water a terrible crashing noise, that  made the banks on either side of it tremble. It was like a hurricane  which comes roaring through the vain shelter of the woods, splitting and  hurling away the boughs, sweeping along proudly in a huge cloud of dust,  and making herds and herdsmen fly before it. \"Now stretch your eyesight  across the water,\" said Virgil, letting loose his hands;--\"there, where  the smoke of the foam is thickest.\" Dante looked; and saw a thousand of  the rebel angels, like frogs before a serpent, swept away into a heap  before the coming of a single spirit, who flew over the tops of the  billows with unwet feet. The spirit frequently pushed the gross air  from before his face, as if tired of the base obstacle; and as he came  nearer, Dante, who saw it was a messenger from heaven, looked anxiously  at Virgil. Virgil motioned him to be silent and bow down.    The angel, with a face full of scorn, as soon as he arrived at the gate,  touched it with a wand that he had in his hand, and it flew open.    \"Outcasts of heaven,\" said he; \"despicable race! whence this fantastical  arrogance? Do ye forget that your torments are laid oil thicker every  time ye kick against the Fates? Do ye forget how your Cerberus was bound  and chained till he lost the hair off his neck like a common dog?\"    So saying he turned swiftly and departed the way he came, not addressing  a word to the travellers. His countenance had suddenly a look of some  other business, totally different from the one he had terminated.    The companions passed in, and beheld a place full of tombs red-hot. It  was the region of Arch heretics and their followers. Dante and his guide  passed round betwixt the walls and the sepulchres as in a churchyard,  and came to the quarter which held Epicurus and his sect, who denied the  existence of spirit apart from matter. The lids of the tombs remaining  unclosed till the day of judgment, the soul of a noble Florentine,  Farinata degli Uberti, hearing Dante speak, addressed him as a  countryman, asking him to stop.[20] Dante, alarmed, beheld him rise half  out of his sepulchre, looking as lofty as if he scorned hell itself.  Finding who Dante was, he boasted of having three times expelled the  Guelphs. \"Perhaps so,\" said the poet; \"but they came back again each  time; an art which their enemies have not yet acquired.\"    A visage then appeared from out another tomb, looking eagerly, as if it  expected to see some one else. Being disappointed, the tears came into  its eyes, and the sufferer said, \"If it is thy genius that conducts thee  hither, where is my son, and why is he not with thee?\"    \"It is not my genius that conducts me,\" said Dante, \"but that of one,  whom perhaps thy son held in contempt.\"    \"How sayest thou?\" cried the shade;--\"_held_ in contempt? He is dead  then? He beholds no longer the sweet light?\" And with these words  he dropped into his tomb, and was seen no more. It was Cavalcante  Cavalcanti, the father of the poet's friend, Guido.[21]    The shade of Farinata, who had meantime been looking on, now replied to  the taunt of Dante, prophesying that he should soon have good reason to  know that the art he spoke of _had_ been acquired; upon which Dante,  speaking with more considerateness to the lofty sufferer, requested to  know how the gift of prophecy could belong to spirits who were ignorant  of the time present. Farinata answered that so it was; just as there was  a kind of eyesight which could discern things at a distance though  not at hand. Dante then expressed his remorse at not having informed  Cavalcante that his son was alive. He said it was owing to his being  overwhelmed with thought on the subject he had just mentioned, and  entreated Farinata to tell him so.    Quitting this part of the cemetery, Virgil led him through the midst  of it towards a descent into a valley, from which there ascended a  loathsome odour. They stood behind one of the tombs for a while,"]]]
