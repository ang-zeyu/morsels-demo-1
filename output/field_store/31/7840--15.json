When the first warrior reached a big oak tree some two hundred yards  distant, the long, black barrel of the hunter's rifle began slowly,  almost imperceptibly, to rise, and as it reached a level the savage  stepped forward from the tree. With the sharp report of the weapon  he staggered and fell.    Wetzel sprang up and knowing that his only escape was in rapid  flight, with his well known yell, he bounded off at the top of his  speed. The remaining Indians discharged their guns at the fleeing,  dodging figure, but without effect. So rapidly did he dart in and  out among the trees that an effectual aim was impossible. Then, with  loud yells, the Indians, drawing their tomahawks, started in  pursuit, expecting soon to overtake their victim.    In the early years of his Indian hunting, Wetzel had perfected  himself in a practice which had saved his life many tunes, and had  added much to his fame. He could reload his rifle while running at  topmost speed. His extraordinary fleetness enabled him to keep ahead  of his pursuers until his rifle was reloaded. This trick he now  employed. Keeping up his uneven pace until his gun was ready, he  turned quickly and shot the nearest Indian dead in his tracks. The  next Indian had by this time nearly come up with him and close  enough to throw his tomahawk, which whizzed dangerously near  Wetzel's head. But he leaped forward again and soon his rifle was  reloaded. Every time he looked around the Indians treed, afraid to  face his unerring weapon. After running a mile or more in this  manner, he reached an open space in the woods where he wheeled  suddenly on his pursuers. The foremost Indian jumped behind a tree,  but, as it did not entirely screen his body, he, too, fell a victim  to the hunter's aim. The Indian must have been desperately wounded,  for his companion now abandoned the chase and went to his  assistance. Together they disappeared in the forest.    Wetzel, seeing that he was no longer pursued, slackened his pace and  proceeded thoughtfully toward the settlement.                * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *    That same day, several hours after Wetzel's departure in quest of  the turkey, Alfred Clarke strolled over from the fort and found  Colonel Zane in the yard. The Colonel was industriously stirring the  contents of a huge copper kettle which swung over a brisk wood fire.  The honeyed fragrance of apple-butter mingled with the pungent odor  of burning hickory.    \"Morning, Alfred, you see they have me at it,\" was the Colonel's  salute.    \"So I observe,\" answered Alfred, as he seated himself on the  wood-pile. \"What is it you are churning so vigorously?\"    \"Apple-butter, my boy, apple-butter. I don't allow even Bessie to  help when I am making apple-butter.\"    \"Colonel Zane, I have come over to ask a favor. Ever since you  notified us that you intended sending an expedition up the river I  have been worried about my horse Roger. He is too light for a pack  horse, and I cannot take two horses.\"    \"I'll let you have the bay. He is big and strong enough. That black  horse of yours is a beauty. You leave Roger with me and if you never  come back I'll be in a fine horse. Ha, Ha! But, seriously, Clarke,  this proposed trip is a hazardous undertaking, and if you would  rather stay--\"    \"You misunderstand me,\" quickly replied Alfred, who had flushed. \"I  do not care about myself. I'll go and take my medicine. But I do  mind about my horse.\"    \"That's right. Always think of your horses. I'll have Sam take the  best of care of Roger.\"    \"What is the nature of this excursion, and how long shall we be  gone?\"    \"Jonathan will guide the party. He says it will take six weeks if  you have pleasant weather. You are to go by way of Short Creek,  where you will help put up a blockhouse. Then you go to Fort Pitt.  There you will embark on a raft with the supplies I need and make  the return journey by water. You will probably smell gunpowder  before you get back.\"    \"What shall we do with the horses?\"    \"Bring them along with you on the raft, of course.\"    \"That is a new way to travel with horses,\" said Alfred, looking  dubiously at the swift river. \"Will there be any way to get news  from Fort Henry while we are away?\"    \"Yes, there will be several runners.\"    \"Mr. Clarke, I am going to feed my pets. Would you like to see  them?\" asked a voice which brought Alfred to his feet. He turned and  saw Betty. Her dog followed her, carrying a basket.    \"I shall be delighted,\" answered Alfred. \"Have you more pets than  Tige and Madcap?\"    \"Oh, yes, indeed. I have a bear, six squirrels, one of them white,  and some pigeons.\"    Betty led the way to an enclosure adjoining Colonel Zane's barn. It  was about twenty feet square, made of pine saplings which had been  split and driven firmly into the ground. As Betty took down a bar  and opened the small gate a number of white pigeons fluttered down  from the roof of the barn, several of them alighting on her  shoulders. A half-grown black bear came out of a kennel and shuffled  toward her. He was unmistakably glad to see her, but he avoided  going near Tige, and looked doubtfully at the young man. But after  Alfred had stroked his head and had spoken to him he seemed disposed  to be friendly, for he sniffed around Alfred's knees and then stood  up and put his paws against the young man's shoulders.    \"Here, Caesar, get down,\" said Betty. \"He always wants to wrestle,  especially with anyone of whom he is not suspicious. He is very tame  and will do almost anything. Indeed, you would marvel at his  intelligence. He never forgets an injury. If anyone plays a trick on  him you may be sure that person will not get a second opportunity.  The night we caught him Tige chased him up a tree and Jonathan  climbed the tree and lassoed him. Ever since he has evinced a hatred  of Jonathan, and if I should leave Tige alone with him there would  be a terrible fight. But for that I could allow Caesar to run free  about the yard.\"    \"He looks bright and sagacious,\" remarked Alfred.    \"He is, but sometimes he gets into mischief. I nearly died laughing  one day. Bessie, my brother's wife, you know, had the big kettle on  the fire, just as you saw it a moment ago, only this time she was  boiling down maple syrup. Tige was out with some of the men and I  let Caesar loose awhile. If there is anything he loves it is maple  sugar, so when he smelled the syrup he pulled down the kettle and  the hot syrup went all over his nose. Oh, his howls were dreadful to  hear. The funniest part about it was he seemed to think it was  intentional, for he remained sulky and cross with me for two weeks.\"    \"I can understand your love for animals,\" said Alfred. \"I think  there are many interesting things about wild creatures. There are  comparatively few animals down in Virginia where I used to live, and  my opportunities to study them have been limited.\"    \"Here are my squirrels,\" said Betty, unfastening the door of a cage.  A number of squirrels ran out. Several jumped to the ground. One  perched on top of the box. Another sprang on Betty's shoulder. \"I  fasten them up every night, for I'm afraid the weasels and foxes  will get them. The white squirrel is the only albino we have seen  around here. It took Jonathan weeks to trap him, but once captured  he soon grew tame. Is he not pretty?\"    \"He certainly is. I never saw one before; in fact, I did not know  such a beautiful little animal existed,\" answered Alfred, looking in  admiration at the graceful creature, as he leaped from the shelf to  Betty's arm and ate from her hand, his great, bushy white tail  arching over his back and his small pink eyes shining.    \"There! Listen,\" said Betty. \"Look at the fox squirrel, the big  brownish red one. I call him the Captain, because he always wants to  boss the others. I had another fox squirrel, older than this fellow,  and he ran things to suit himself, until one day the grays united  their forces and routed him. I think they would have killed him had  I not freed him. Well, this one is commencing the same way. Do you  hear that odd clicking noise? That comes from the Captain's teeth,  and he is angry and jealous because I show so much attention to this  one. He always does that, and he would fight too if I were not  careful. It is a singular fact, though, that the white squirrel has  not even a little pugnacity. He either cannot fight, or he is too  well behaved. Here, Mr. Clarke, show Snowball this nut, and then  hide it in your pocket, and see him find it.\"    Alfred did as he was told, except that while he pretended to put the  nut in his pocket he really kept it concealed in his hand.    The pet squirrel leaped lightly on Alfred's shoulder, ran over his  breast, peeped in all his pockets, and even pushed his cap to one  side of his head. Then he ran down Alfred's arm, sniffed in his coat  sleeve, and finally wedged a cold little nose between his closed  fingers.    \"There, he has found it, even though you did not play fair,\" said  Betty, laughing gaily.    Alfred never forgot the picture Betty made standing there with the  red cap on her dusky hair, and the loving smile upon her face as she  talked to her pets. A white fan-tail pigeon had alighted on her  shoulder and was picking daintily at the piece of cracker she held  between her lips. The squirrels were all sitting up, each with a nut  in his little paws, and each with an alert and cunning look in the  corner of his eye, to prevent, no doubt, being surprised out of a  portion of his nut. Caesar was lying on all fours, growling and  tearing at his breakfast, while the dog looked on with a superior  air, as if he knew they would not have had any breakfast but for  him.    \"Are you fond of canoeing and fishing?\" asked Betty, as they  returned to the house.    \"Indeed I am.

Canoeing  may be pleasant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#15)"],[1,"in puffs from the crags; it rustled in the  cedars and blew fragrant whiffs of camp-fire smoke into his face; and  presently it bore a low, prolonged whistle. He had never before heard  its like. The sound broke the silence again, clearer, a keen, sharp  whistle.    \"What is it?\" he queried, reaching for his rifle.    \"Wild mustangs,\" said Mescal.    \"No,\" corrected Piute, vehemently shaking his head. \"Clea, Clea.\"    \"Jack, he says 'horse, horse.' It's a wild horse.\"    A third time the whistle rang down from the ridge, splitting the air,  strong and trenchant, the fiery, shrill challenge of a stallion.    Black Bolly reared straight up.    Jack ran to the rise of ground above the camp, and looked over the  cedars. \"Oh!\" he cried, and beckoned for Mescal. She ran to him, and  Piute, tying Black Bolly, hurried after. \"Look! look!\" cried Jack. He  pointed to a ridge rising to the left of the yellow crags. On the bare  summit stood a splendid stallion clearly silhouetted against the ruddy  morning sky. He was an iron-gray, wild and proud, with long silver-white  mane waving in the wind.    \"Silvermane! Silvermane!\" exclaimed Mescal.    \"What a magnificent animal!\" Jack stared at the splendid picture for the  moment before the horse moved back along the ridge and disappeared.  Other horses, blacks and bays, showed above the sage for a moment, and  they, too, passed out of sight.    \"He's got some of his band with him,\" said Jack, thrilled with  excitement. \"Mescal, they're down off the upper range, and grazing along  easy. The wind favors us. That whistle was just plain fight, judging  from what Naab told me of wild stallions. He came to the hilltop, and  whistled down defiance to any horse, wild or tame, that might be below.  I'll slip round through the cedars, and block the trail leading up to  the other range, and you and Piute close the gate of our trail at this  end. Then send Piute down to tell Naab we've got Silvermane.\"    Jack chose the lowest edge of the plateau rim where the cedars were  thickest for his detour to get behind the wild band; he ran from tree to  tree, avoiding the open places, taking advantage of the thickets,  keeping away from the ridge. He had never gone so far as the gate, but,  knowing where the trail led into a split in the crags, he climbed the  slope, and threaded a way over masses of fallen cliff, until he reached  the base of the wall. The tracks of the wildhorse band were very fresh  and plain in the yellow trail. Four stout posts guarded the opening, and  a number of bars lay ready to be pushed into place. He put them up,  making a gate ten feet high, an impregnable barrier. This done, he  hurried back to camp.    \"Jack, Bolly will need more watching to-day than the sheep, unless I let  her loose. Why, she pulls and strains so she'll break that halter.\"    \"She wants to go with the band; isn't that it?\"    \"I don't like to think so. But Father Naab doesn't trust Bolly, though  she's the best mustang he ever broke.\"    \"Better keep her in,\" replied Jack, remembering Naab's warning. \"I'll  hobble her, so if she does break loose she can't go far.\"    When Mescal and Jack drove in the sheep that afternoon, rather earlier  than usual, Piute had returned with August Naab, Dave, and Billy, a  string of mustangs and a pack-train of burros.    \"Hello, Mescal,\" cheerily called August, as they came into camp. \"Well  Jack--bless me! Why, my lad, how fine and brown--and yes, how you've  filled out!\" He crushed Jack's hand in his broad palm, and his gray eyes  beamed. \"I've not the gift of revelation--but, Jack, you're going to get  well.\"    \"Yes, I--\" He had difficulty with his enunciation, but he thumped his  breast significantly and smiled.    \"Black sage and juniper!\" exclaimed August. \"In this air if a man  doesn't go off quickly with pneumonia, he'll get well. I never had a  doubt for you, Jack--and thank God!\"    He questioned Piute and Mescal about the sheep, and was greatly pleased  with their report. He shook his head when Jack spread out the grizzly-  pelt, and asked for the story of the killing. Jack made a poor showing  with the tale and slighted his share in it, but Mescal told it as it  actually happened. And Naab's great hand resounded from Jack's shoulder.  Then, catching sight of the pile of coyote skins under the stone shelf,  he gave vent to his surprise and delight. Then he came back to the  object of his trip upon the plateau.    \"So you've corralled Silvermane? Well, Jack, if he doesn't jump over the  cliff he's ours. He can't get off any other way. How many horses with  him?\"    \"We had no chance to count. I saw at least twelve.\"    \"Good! He's out with his picked band. Weren't they all blacks and bays?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Jack, the history of that stallion wouldn't make you proud of him.  We've corralled him by a lucky chance. If I don't miss my guess he's  after Bolly. He has been a lot of trouble to ranchers all the way from  the Nevada line across Utah. The stallions he's killed, the mares he's  led off! Well, Dave, shall we thirst him out, or line up a long corral?\"    \"Better have a look around to-morrow,\" replied Dave. \"It'll take a lot  of chasing to run him down, but there's not a spring on the bench where  we can throw up a trap-corral. We'll have to chase him.\"    \"Mescal, has Bolly been good since Silvermane came down?\"    \"No, she hasn't,\" declared Mescal, and told of the circumstance.    \"Bolly's all right,\" said Billy Naab. \"Any mustang will do that. Keep  her belled and hobbled.\"    \"Silvermane would care a lot about that, if he wanted Bolly, wouldn't  he?\" queried Dave in quiet scorn. \"Keep her roped and haltered, I say.\"    \"Dave's right,\" said August. \"You can't trust a wild mustang any more  than a wild horse.\"    August was right. Black Bolly broke her halter about midnight and  escaped into the forest, hobbled as she was. The Indian heard her first,  and he awoke August, who aroused the others.    \"Don't make any noise,\" he said, as Jack came up, throwing on his coat.  \"There's likely to be some fun here presently. Bolly's loose, broke her  rope, and I think Silvermane is close. Listen sharp now.\"    The slight breeze favored them, the camp-fire was dead, and the night  was clear and starlit. They had not been quiet many moments when the  shrill neigh of a mustang rang out. The Naabs raised themselves and  looked at one another in the starlight.    \"Now what do you think of that?\" whispered Billy.    \"No more than I expected. It was Bolly,\" replied Dave.    \"Bolly it was, confound her black hide!\" added August. \"Now, boys, did  she whistle for Silvermane, or to warn him, which?\"    \"No telling,\" answered Billy. \"Let's lie low, and take a chance on him  coming close. It proves one thing--you can't break a wild mare. That  spirit may sleep in her blood, maybe for years, but some time it'll  answer to--\"    \"Shut up--listen,\" interrupted Dave.    Jack strained his hearing, yet caught no sound, except the distant yelp  of a coyote. Moments went by.    \"There!\" whispered Dave.    From the direction of the ridge came the faint rattling of stones.    \"They're coming,\" put in Billy.    Presently sharp clicks preceded the rattles, and the sounds began to  merge into a regular rhythmic tramp. It softened at intervals, probably  when the horses were under the cedars, and strengthened as they came out  on the harder ground of the open.    \"I see them,\" whispered Dave.    A black, undulating line wound out of the cedars, a line of horses  approaching with drooping heads, hurrying a little as they neared the  spring.    \"Twenty-odd, all blacks and bays,\" said August, \"and some of them are  mustangs. But where's Silvermane?--hark!\"    Out among the cedars rose the peculiar halting thump of a hobbled horse  trying to cover ground, followed by snorts and crashings of brush and  the pound of plunging hoofs. The long black line stopped short and began  to stamp. Then into the starlit glade below moved two shadows, the first  a great gray horse with snowy mane; the second, a small, shiny, black  mustang.    \"Silvermane and Bolly!\" exclaimed August, \"and now she's broken her  hobbles.\"    The stallion, in the fulfilment of a conquest such as had made him king  of the wild ranges, was magnificent in action. Wheeling about her,  neighing, and plunging, he arched his splendid neck and pushed his head  against her. His action was that of a master. Suddenly Black Bolly  snorted and whirled down the glade. Silvermane whistled one blast of  anger or terror and thundered after her. They vanished in the gloom of  the cedars, and the band of frightened horses and mustangs clattered  after them.    \"It's one on me,\" remarked Billy. \"That little mare played us at the  finish. Caught when she was a yearling, broken better than any mustang  we ever had, she has helped us run down many a stallion, and now she  runs off with that big white-maned brute!\"    \"They'll make a team, and if they get out of here we'll have to chase  them to the Great Salt Basin,\" replied Dave.    \"Mescal, that's a well-behaved mustang of yours,\" said August; \"not only  did she break loose, but she whistled an alarm to Silvermane and his  band. Well, roll in now, everybody, and sleep.\"    At breakfast the following day the Naabs fell into a discussion upon the  possibility of there being other means of exit from the plateau than the  two trails already closed. They had never run any mustangs on the  plateau, and in the case of a wild horse like Silvermane, who would take  desperate chances, it was advisable to know the ground exactly. Billy  and Dave taking their mounts from the sheep-corral, where they had put  them up for the night, rode in opposite directions around the rim of the  plateau. It was triangular in shape, and some six or seven miles in  circumference; and the brothers rode around it in less than an hour.    \"Corralled,\" said Dave, laconically.    \"Good! Did you see him? What kind of a"]]]
