Then he laid the hand back on the  sheet and grinned more confidently at Bull.    \"Well, I'll be hanged, Bull, here you are as big as life, pretty near,  and you don't act like you knew me!\"    \"Sure I do. Sit down, Harry. What brung you all this ways?\"    \"Why, anxious to see how you was doing.\"    Again Bull blinked. Such anxiety from Harry was a mystery.    \"They ain't talking about much else up our way,\" said Harry, \"but how  you come across the mountains in the storm, and how big you are, and  how you got the sheriff, and how you rushed Pete Reeve bare-handed.  Sure is some story! All the way down I just had to say that I was Bull  Hunter's cousin to get free meals!\" He licked his lips and grinned  again. \"So I come down to see how you was.\"    \"I'm doing tolerable fair,\" said Bull slowly, \"and it was good of you  to come this long ways to ask that question. How's things to home?\"    \"Dad's bunged up for life; can't do nothing but cuss, but at that he  lays over anything you ever hear.\" Harry's eyes flicked nervously  about the room. \"It was him that sent me down! Where's Reeve?\"    This was in a whisper. Bull gestured toward the next room.    \"Asleep? Can he hear if I talk?\"    \"Asleep,\" said Bull. \"Been up with me two days. I took a bad turn a  while back. Pete's helping himself to a nap, and he needs one!\"    \"Now, listen!\" said Harry. \"Dad figured this out, and Dad's mostly  never wrong. He says, 'Reeve shot up Bull. Now he's hanging around  trying to make up by nursing Bull, according to reports, because he's  afraid of what Bull'll do when he gets back on his feet. But Bull  has got to know that, even when he's back on his feet, he can't beat  Reeve--not while Reeve can pull a gun. Nobody can beat that devil.  If he wants to beat Reeve, just take advantage of him while Reeve  ain't expecting anything--which means while Bull is sick.' Do you  get what Dad means?\"    \"Sort of,\" said Bull faintly. He shut out the eager, dirty, unshaven  face. \"I'll just close my eyes against the light. I can hear you  pretty well. Go on.\"    \"Here's the idea. Everybody knows you hate Reeve, and Reeve fears you.  Otherwise would he act like this, aside from being afraid of a  lynching, in case you should die? No, he wouldn't. Well, one of these  days you take this gun\"--here Harry shoved one under the pillow of  Bull--\"and call Pete Reeve over to you, and when he leans over your  bed, blow his brains out! That's easy, and it'll do what you'll want  to do someday. You hear? Then you can say that Reeve started  something--that you shot in self-defense. Everybody'll believe you,  and you'll get one big name for killing Reeve! You foller me?\"    Bull opened his eyes, but they were squinting as though he was in the  severest pain. \"Listen, Harry,\" he said at last. \"I been thinking  things out. I owe a lot to your dad for taking me in and keeping me.  But all I owe him I can pay back in cash--someday. I don't owe him  no love. Not you, neither.\"    Harry had risen to his feet with a snarl.    \"Sit down,\" said Bull, letting his great voice swell ever so little.  \"I'm pretty near dead, but I'm still man enough to wring the neck of  a skunk! Sit down!\"    Harry obeyed limply, and his giant cousin went on, his voice softening  again. \"When you come in I closed my eyes,\" said Bull, \"because it  seemed to me like you was a dream. I'd been awake. I'd been living  among men that sort of liked me and respected me and didn't laugh at  me. And then you come, and I saw your dirty face, and it made me think  of a bad nightmare I'd had when you and your brother and your dad  treated me worse'n a dog. Well, Harry, I'm through with that dream.  I'll never go back to it. I'm going to stay awake the rest of my life.  It was your dad that put the wish to kill Reeve into my head with his  talk. I met Reeve, and Reeve pumped some bullets with sense into me.  He let out some of my life, but he let in a lot of knowledge. Among  other things he showed me what a friend might be. He's stayed here and  nursed me and talked to me--like I was his equal, almost, instead of  being sort of simple, like I really am. And I've made up my mind that  I'm going to cut loose from remembering you folks in the mountains.  I ain't your kind. I don't want to be your kind. I want to fight,  like Pete Reeve. I don't want to murder like a Campbell! All the way  through, I want to be like Pete Reeve. He don't know it. Maybe when  I'm well he'll go off by himself. But whether he's near or far, I've  adopted him. I'm going to pattern after him, and the happiest day of  my life will be when I earn the right to have this man, that I tried  to kill, come and take my hand and call me 'friend'! I guess that  answers you, Harry. Now get out and take my talk back to your dad,  and don't trouble me no more--you spoil my sleep!\"    As he spoke the door of the next room opened softly. Peter Reeve stood  at the entrance. Harry, shaking with fear, backed toward the other  door, then leaped far out, and whirled out of sight with a slam and  clatter of feet on the stairs. Pete Reeve came slowly to the bedside.    \"I was awake, son,\" he said, \"and I couldn't help hearing.\"    Bull flushed heavily.    \"It's the best thing I ever heard,\" said Pete. \"The best thing that's  ever come to my ears--partner!\"    With that word their hands joined. In reality, far more than he  dreamed, Bull had been born again.          CHAPTER 11      When they were together, they made a study in contrasts. By seeing one  it was possible to imagine the other. For instance, seeing the high,  narrow forehead, peaked face, the gray-flecked hair of Pete Reeve, his  nervous step, his piercing and uneasy eyes--seeing this man with his  body from which all spare flesh was wasted so that he remained only  muscle and nerve, it was easy to conjure up the figure of Bull Hunter  by thinking of opposites.    Their very voices held a world of difference. The tone of Pete Reeve  was pitched a little high, hard, and somewhat nasal, and when he was  angry his words came shrill and ringing. The mere sound of his voice  was irritating--it put one on edge with expectancy of action. Whereas  the full, deep, slow, musical voice of Bull Hunter was a veritable  sleep producer. Men might fear Charlie Bull Hunter because of his  tremendous bulk; but children, hearing his voice, were unafraid.    The motions of Pete Reeve were as fast and as deft as the whiplash  striking of a snake. The motions of Bull Hunter were premeditated and  cautious, as befitting one whose hands might crush what they touched,  and whose footfall made a flooring groan.    He sat cross-legged on the floor, his back against the wall. They had  moved a ponderous stool into the room so that Bull might have  something on which to sit, but long habit had made him uneasy in a  chair, and he kept to the floor by preference, with the great square  chin resting on his fist and his knee supporting his elbow. That  position pressed the forearm against the biceps and the big muscles  bulged out on either side, vast as the thigh of a strong man.    With lionlike wrinkles of attention between his eyes, he listened to  the exposition of the little man, and followed his movements with  patient submission--like a pupil to whom a great master has consented  to unfold the secrets of his brushwork; in such a manner did Bull  Hunter drink in the words and the acts of Pete Reeve. And, indeed,  where guns were the subject of conversation it would have been hard to  find a man more thoroughly equipped to pose as an expert than Pete  Reeve. That fleshless hand, all speed of motion as it whipped out the  gun from the nerve and sinew, became an incredible ghost with the  holster and the long, heavy Colt danced and flashed at his fingertips  as though it were a gilded shadow.    As he worked he talked, and as he talked he strode constantly back and  forth through the room with his light-falling, mincing steps. He grew  excited. He flushed. There came a thrill and a ring and a deepening of  the voice. For the master was indeed talking of the secrets of  his craft.    A thousand men of the mountains and the cattle ranges, men who, for  personal pride or for physical need, studied accuracy and speed in  gunplay, would have paid untold prices to learn these secrets from the  lips of the little man. To Bull Hunter the mysteries were revealed for  nothing, freely, and drilled and drummed into him through the weeks of  his convalescence; and still the lessons continued now that he was  hale and hearty once more--as the clean-swept platters from which he  ate three times a day gave evidence.    \"I've practiced, you admit,\" said Bull in his slow voice, as Pete  Reeve came to a pause. \"But I haven't got your way with a gun, Pete.  You've got a genius for it. I don't blame you for laughing at me when  I try to get out my gun fast. I can shoot straight. That's because I  haven't any nerves, as you say, but I'll never be able to get out a  gun as fast as a thought--the way you do. Fact is, Pete, I don't think  fast, you know.\"    \"Shut up!\" exploded Pete Reeve, who had been inwardly chafing with  impatience during the whole length of this speech. \"Sometimes you talk  like a fool, Bull, and this is one time!\"    Bull shook his head. \"My arms are too big,\" he said sadly. \"The muscle  gets in my way. I can feel it bind when I try to jerk out the gun  fast. Better give up the job, Pete. I sure appreciate all the pains  you've taken with me--but I'll never be a gunfighter.\"    Pete Reeve shook his head with a sigh and then dropped into a chair,  growing suddenly inert.    \"No use,\" he groaned. \"All because you ain't got any confidence,  Bull.\" He leaned forward in his sudden way. \"Know something? I been  keeping it back, but now I'll tell you the straight of it. You're  faster with a gun right now than four men out of five!\"    Bull gaped in amazement.    \"Fact!\" cried Reeve. \"Y"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1036"],[0,"Joe Wilson and His Mates (#15)"],[1,"with limbs, especially  his bare sun-blotched shanks, that might have belonged to a grown  man. He had a good face and frank grey eyes. An old, nearly black  cabbage-tree hat rested on the butts of his ears, turning them out at  right angles from his head, and rather dirty sprouts they were. He wore  a dirty torn Crimean shirt; and a pair of man's moleskin trousers rolled  up above the knees, with the wide waistband gathered under a greenhide  belt. I noticed, later on, that, even when he wore trousers short enough  for him, he always rolled 'em up above the knees when on horseback, for  some reason of his own: to suggest leggings, perhaps, for he had them  rolled up in all weathers, and he wouldn't have bothered to save them  from the sweat of the horse, even if that horse ever sweated.    He was seated astride a three-bushel bag thrown across the ridge-pole of  a big grey horse, with a coffin-shaped head, and built astern something  after the style of a roughly put up hip-roofed box-bark humpy.* His  colour was like old box-bark, too, a dirty bluish-grey; and, one time,  when I saw his rump looming out of the scrub, I really thought it was  some old shepherd's hut that I hadn't noticed there before. When he  cantered it was like the humpy starting off on its corner-posts.         * 'Humpy', a rough hut.    'Are you Mrs Wilson?' asked the boy.    'Yes,' said Mary.    'Well, mother told me to ride acrost and see if you wanted anythink. We  killed lars' night, and I've fetched a piece er cow.'    'Piece of WHAT?' asked Mary.    He grinned, and handed a sugar-bag across the rail with something heavy  in the bottom of it, that nearly jerked Mary's arm out when she took  it. It was a piece of beef, that looked as if it had been cut off with a  wood-axe, but it was fresh and clean.    'Oh, I'm so glad!' cried Mary. She was always impulsive, save to me  sometimes. 'I was just wondering where we were going to get any fresh  meat. How kind of your mother! Tell her I'm very much obliged to her  indeed.' And she felt behind her for a poor little purse she had. 'And  now--how much did your mother say it would be?'    The boy blinked at her, and scratched his head.    'How much will it be,' he repeated, puzzled. 'Oh--how much does it weigh  I-s'pose-yer-mean. Well, it ain't been weighed at all--we ain't got no  scales. A butcher does all that sort of think. We just kills it, and  cooks it, and eats it--and goes by guess. What won't keep we salts down  in the cask. I reckon it weighs about a ton by the weight of it if yer  wanter know. Mother thought that if she sent any more it would go bad  before you could scoff it. I can't see----'    'Yes, yes,' said Mary, getting confused. 'But what I want to know is,  how do you manage when you sell it?'    He glared at her, and scratched his head. 'Sell it? Why, we only goes  halves in a steer with some one, or sells steers to the butcher--or  maybe some meat to a party of fencers or surveyors, or tank-sinkers, or  them sorter people----'    'Yes, yes; but what I want to know is, how much am I to send your mother  for this?'    'How much what?'    'Money, of course, you stupid boy,' said Mary. 'You seem a very stupid  boy.'    Then he saw what she was driving at. He began to fling his heels  convulsively against the sides of his horse, jerking his body backward  and forward at the same time, as if to wind up and start some clockwork  machinery inside the horse, that made it go, and seemed to need  repairing or oiling.    'We ain't that sorter people, missus,' he said. 'We don't sell meat  to new people that come to settle here.' Then, jerking his thumb  contemptuously towards the ridges, 'Go over ter Wall's if yer wanter buy  meat; they sell meat ter strangers.' (Wall was the big squatter over the  ridges.)    'Oh!' said Mary, 'I'm SO sorry. Thank your mother for me. She IS kind.'    'Oh, that's nothink. She said to tell yer she'll be up as soon as she  can. She'd have come up yisterday evening--she thought yer'd feel lonely  comin' new to a place like this--but she couldn't git up.'    The machinery inside the old horse showed signs of starting. You  almost heard the wooden joints CREAK as he lurched forward, like an old  propped-up humpy when the rotting props give way; but at the sound of  Mary's voice he settled back on his foundations again. It must have been  a very poor selection that couldn't afford a better spare horse than  that.    'Reach me that lump er wood, will yer, missus?' said the boy, and he  pointed to one of my 'spreads' (for the team-chains) that lay inside the  fence. 'I'll fling it back agin over the fence when I git this ole cow  started.'    'But wait a minute--I've forgotten your mother's name,' said Mary.    He grabbed at his thatch impatiently. 'Me mother--oh!--the old woman's  name's Mrs Spicer. (Git up, karnt yer!)' He twisted himself round, and  brought the stretcher down on one of the horse's 'points' (and he had  many) with a crack that must have jarred his wrist.    'Do you go to school?' asked Mary. There was a three-days-a-week school  over the ridges at Wall's station.    'No!' he jerked out, keeping his legs going. 'Me--why I'm going on fur  fifteen. The last teacher at Wall's finished me. I'm going to Queensland  next month drovin'.' (Queensland border was over three hundred miles  away.)    'Finished you? How?' asked Mary.    'Me edgercation, of course! How do yer expect me to start this horse  when yer keep talkin'?'    He split the 'spread' over the horse's point, threw the pieces over the  fence, and was off, his elbows and legs flinging wildly, and the old  saw-stool lumbering along the road like an old working bullock trying a  canter. That horse wasn't a trotter.    And next month he DID start for Queensland. He was a younger son and a  surplus boy on a wretched, poverty-stricken selection; and as there was  'northin' doin'' in the district, his father (in a burst of fatherly  kindness, I suppose) made him a present of the old horse and a new  pair of Blucher boots, and I gave him an old saddle and a coat, and he  started for the Never-Never Country.    And I'll bet he got there. But I'm doubtful if the old horse did.    Mary gave the boy five shillings, and I don't think he had anything more  except a clean shirt and an extra pair of white cotton socks.    'Spicer's farm' was a big bark humpy on a patchy clearing in the native  apple-tree scrub. The clearing was fenced in by a light 'dog-legged'  fence (a fence of sapling poles resting on forks and X-shaped uprights),  and the dusty ground round the house was almost entirely covered with  cattle-dung. There was no attempt at cultivation when I came to live on  the creek; but there were old furrow-marks amongst the stumps of another  shapeless patch in the scrub near the hut. There was a wretched sapling  cow-yard and calf-pen, and a cow-bail with one sheet of bark over it for  shelter. There was no dairy to be seen, and I suppose the milk was set  in one of the two skillion rooms, or lean-to's behind the hut,--the  other was 'the boys' bedroom'. The Spicers kept a few cows and steers,  and had thirty or forty sheep. Mrs Spicer used to drive down the creek  once a-week, in her rickety old spring-cart, to Cobborah, with butter  and eggs. The hut was nearly as bare inside as it was out--just a frame  of 'round-timber' (sapling poles) covered with bark. The furniture was  permanent (unless you rooted it up), like in our kitchen: a rough slab  table on stakes driven into the ground, and seats made the same  way. Mary told me afterwards that the beds in the bag-and-bark  partitioned-off room ('mother's bedroom') were simply poles laid side  by side on cross-pieces supported by stakes driven into the ground, with  straw mattresses and some worn-out bed-clothes. Mrs Spicer had an old  patchwork quilt, in rags, and the remains of a white one, and Mary said  it was pitiful to see how these things would be spread over the beds--to  hide them as much as possible--when she went down there. A packing-case,  with something like an old print skirt draped round it, and a cracked  looking-glass (without a frame) on top, was the dressing-table.  There were a couple of gin-cases for a wardrobe. The boys' beds were  three-bushel bags stretched between poles fastened to uprights. The  floor was the original surface, tramped hard, worn uneven with much  sweeping, and with puddles in rainy weather where the roof leaked. Mrs  Spicer used to stand old tins, dishes, and buckets under as many of  the leaks as she could. The saucepans, kettles, and boilers were old  kerosene-tins and billies. They used kerosene-tins, too, cut longways in  halves, for setting the milk in. The plates and cups were of tin;  there were two or three cups without saucers, and a crockery plate or  two--also two mugs, cracked and without handles, one with 'For a Good  Boy' and the other with 'For a Good Girl' on it; but all these were kept  on the mantel-shelf for ornament and for company. They were the only  ornaments in the house, save a little wooden clock that hadn't gone for  years. Mrs Spicer had a superstition that she had 'some things packed  away from the children.'    The pictures were cut from old copies of the 'Illustrated Sydney News'  and pasted on to the bark. I remember this, because I remembered, long  ago, the Spencers, who were our neighbours when I was a boy, had the  walls of their bedroom covered with illustrations of the American Civil  War, cut from illustrated London papers, and I used to 'sneak' into  'mother's bedroom' with Fred Spencer whenever we got the chance, and  gloat over the prints. I gave him a blade of a pocket-knife once, for  taking me in there.    I saw very little of Spicer. He was a big, dark, dark-haired and  whiskered man. I had an idea that he wasn't a selector at all, only a  'dummy' for the squatter of the Cobborah run. You see, selectors were  allowed to take up land on runs, or"]]]
