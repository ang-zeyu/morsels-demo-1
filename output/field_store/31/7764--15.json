The soldier who kills his fellow man of a neighboring nation by a  stroke of his sword will easily lose the respect for the life of  members of his own social group. Then the second educational energy  interferes, the energy of labor, which makes itself felt at the decisive  moment of prehistoric development, when the human race passes from a  pastoral, hunting, and nomadic life Into an agriculture and settled  life. This is the historic stage, in which the collective ownership of  land and instruments of production is displaced by communal property,  family property, and finally individual property. During these stages,  humanity passes from individual and isolated labor in collective,  associated, co-ordinated labor. The remains of the neolithic epoch show  us the progress of the first workshops, in which our ancestors gathered  and fashioned their primitive tools and arms. They give us an idea of  associated and common labor, which then becomes the great uplifting  energy, because, unlike war, it does not carry within itself a disdain  or violation of the rights of others. Labor is the sole perennial energy  of mankind which leads to social perfection. But if you have 100,000  persons in a city like Naples who do not enjoy the certainty and  discipline of employment at methodical and common labor, you need not  wonder that the uncertainty of daily life, an illfed stomach, and an  anemic brain, result in the atrophy of all moral sentiment, and that the  evil plant of the Camorra spreads out over everything. The processes in  the law courts may attract the fleeting attention of public opinion, of  legislation, of government, to the disease from which this portion of  the social organism is suffering, but mere repression will not  accomplish anything lasting.    The teaching of science tells us plainly that in such a case of endemic  criminality social remedies must be applied to social evils. Unless the  remedy of social reforms accompanies the development and protection of  labor; unless justice is assured to every member of the collectivity,  the courage of this or that citizen is spent in vain, and the evil plant  will continue to thrive in the jungle.    Taught by the masterly and inflexible logic of facts, we come to the  adoption of the scientific method in criminal research and conclude that  a simple and uniform remedy like punishment is not adequate to cure such  a natural and social phenomenon as crime, which has its own natural and  social causes. The measures for the preservation of society against  criminality must be manifold, complex and varied, and must be the  outcome of persevering and systematic work on the part of legislators  and citizens on the solid foundation of a systematic collective economy.    Let me take leave of you with this practical conclusion, and give my  heart freedom to send to my brain a wave of fervent blood, which shall  express my enduring gratitude for the reception which you have given me.  Old in years, but young in spirit and energetic aspiration to every high  ideal, I tender you my sincere thanks. As a man and a citizen, I thank  you, because these three lectures have been for me a fountain of youth,  of faith, of enthusiasm. Thanks to them I return to the other fields of  my daily occupation with a greater faith in the future of my country and  of humanity. To you, young Italy, I address these words of thanks, glad  and honored, if my words have aroused in your soul one breath which will  make you stronger and more confident in the future of civilization and  social justice."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#15)"],[1," it Jellicoe wanted?\" asked Mike; \"was it anything important?\"    \"He seemed to think so--he kept telling me to tell you to go and see  him.\"    \"I fear Comrade Jellicoe is a bit of a weak-minded blitherer--\"    \"Did you ever hear of a rag we worked off on Jellicoe once?\" asked  Dunster. \"The man has absolutely no sense of humor--can't see when he's  being rotted. Well, it was like this--hello! We're all out--I shall have  to be going out to field again, I suppose, dash it! I'll tell you when I  see you again.\"    \"I shall count the minutes,\" said Psmith.    Mike stretched himself; the sun was very soothing after his two hours in  the detention room; he felt disinclined for exertion.    \"I don't suppose it's anything special about Jellicoe, do you?\" he said.  \"I mean, it'll keep till teatime; it's no catch having to sweat across  to the house now.\"    \"Don't dream of moving,\" said Psmith. \"I have several rather profound  observations on life to make and I can't make them without an audience.  Soliloquy is a knack. Hamlet had got it, but probably only after years  of patient practice. Personally, I need someone to listen when I talk. I  like to feel that I am doing good. You stay where you are--don't  interrupt too much.\"    Mike tilted his hat over his eyes and abandoned Jellicoe.    It was not until the lock-up bell rang that he remembered him. He went  over to the house and made his way to the dormitory, where he found the  injured one in a parlous state, not so much physical as mental. The  doctor had seen his ankle and reported that it would be on the active  list in a couple of days. It was Jellicoe's mind that needed  attention now.    Mike found him in a condition bordering on collapse. \"I say, you might  have come before!\" said Jellicoe.    \"What's up? I didn't know there was such a hurry about it--what did you  want?\"    \"It's no good now,\" said Jellicoe gloomily; \"it's too late, I shall get  sacked.\"    \"What on earth are you talking about? What's the row?\"    \"It's about that money.\"    \"What about it?\"    \"I had to pay it to a man today, or he said he'd write to the Head--then  of course I should get sacked. I was going to take the money to him this  afternoon, only I got crocked, so I couldn't move. I wanted to get hold  of you to ask you to take it for me--it's too late now!\"    Mike's face fell. \"Oh, hang it!\" he said, \"I'm awfully sorry. I'd no  idea it was anything like that--what a fool I was! Dunster did say he  thought it was something important, only like an ass I thought it would  do if I came over at lockup.\"    \"It doesn't matter,\" said Jellicoe miserably; \"it can't be helped.\"    \"Yes, it can,\" said Mike. \"I know what I'll do--it's all right. I'll get  out of the house after lights-out.\"    Jellicoe sat up. \"You can't! You'd get sacked if you were caught.\"    \"Who would catch me? There was a chap at Wrykyn I knew who used to break  out every night nearly and go and pot at cats with an air pistol; it's  as easy as anything.\"    The toad-under-the-harrow expression began to fade from Jellicoe's face.  \"I say, do you think you could, really?\"    \"Of course I can! It'll be rather a rag.\"    \"I say, it's frightfully decent of you.\"    \"What absolute rot!\"    \"But look here, are you certain--\"    \"I shall be all right. Where do you want me to go?\"    \"It's a place about a mile or two from here, called Lower Borlock.\"    \"Lower Borlock?\"    \"Yes, do you know it?\"    \"Rather! I've been playing cricket for them all the term.\"    \"I say, have you? Do you know a man called Barley?\"    \"Barley? Rather--he runs the White Boar.\"    \"He's the chap I owe the money to.\"    \"Old Barley!\"    Mike knew the landlord of the White Boar well; he was the wag of the  village team. Every village team, for some mysterious reason, has its  comic man. In the Lower Borlock eleven Mr. Barley filled the post. He  was a large, stout man, with a red and cheerful face, who looked exactly  like the jovial innkeeper of melodrama. He was the last man Mike would  have expected to do the \"money by Monday-week or I write to the  headmaster\" business.    But he reflected that he had only seen him in his leisure moments, when  he might naturally be expected to unbend and be full of the milk of  human kindness. Probably in business hours he was quite different. After  all, pleasure is one thing and business another.    Besides, five pounds is a large sum of money, and if Jellicoe owed it,  there was nothing strange in Mr. Barley's doing everything he could to  recover it.    He wondered a little what Jellicoe could have been doing to run up a  bill as big as that, but it did not occur to him to ask, which was  unfortunate, as it might have saved him a good deal of inconvenience. It  seemed to him that it was none of his business to inquire into  Jellicoe's private affairs. He took the envelope containing the money  without question.    \"I shall bike there, I think,\" he said, \"if I can get into the shed.\"    The school's bicycles were stored in a shed by the pavilion.    \"You can manage that,\" said Jellicoe; \"it's locked up at night, but I  had a key made to fit it last summer, because I used to get out in the  early morning sometimes before it was opened.\"    \"Got it on you?\"    \"Smith's got it.\"    \"I'll get it from him.\"    \"I say!\"    \"Well?\"    \"Don't tell Smith why you want it, will you? I don't want anybody to  know--if a thing once starts getting about it's all over the place in  no time.\"    \"All right, I won't tell him.\"    \"I say, thanks most awfully! I don't know what I should have done, I--\"    \"Oh, chuck it!\" said Mike.        15    ... AND FULFILLS IT      Mike started on his ride to Lower Borlock with mixed feelings. It is  pleasant to be out on a fine night in summer, but the pleasure is to a  certain extent modified when one feels that to be detected will mean  expulsion.    Mike did not want to be expelled, for many reasons. Now that he had  grown used to the place he was enjoying himself at Sedleigh to a certain  extent. He still harbored a feeling of resentment against the school in  general and Adair in particular, but it was pleasant in Outwood's now  that he had got to know some of the members of the house, and he liked  playing cricket for Lower Borlock; also, he was fairly certain that his  father would not let him go to Cambridge if he were expelled from  Sedleigh. Mr. Jackson was easygoing with his family, but occasionally  his foot came down like a steam hammer, as witness the Wrykyn  school-report affair.    So Mike pedaled along rapidly, being wishful to get the job done without  delay.    Psmith had yielded up the key, but his inquiries as to why it was needed  had been embarrassing. Mike's statement that he wanted to get up early  and have a ride had been received by Psmith, with whom early rising was  not a hobby, with honest amazement and a flood of advice and warning on  the subject.    \"One of the Georges,\" said Psmith, \"I forget which, once said that a  certain number of hours' sleep a day--I cannot recall for the moment how  many--made a man something, which for the time being has slipped my  memory. However, there you are. I've given you the main idea of the  thing; and a German doctor says that early rising causes insanity.  Still, if you're bent on it....\" After which he had handed over the key.    Mike wished he could have taken Psmith into his confidence. Probably he  would have volunteered to come, too; Mike would have been glad of a  companion.    It did not take him long to reach Lower Borlock. The White Boar stood at  the far end of the village, by the cricket field. He rode past the  church--standing out black and mysterious against the light sky--and the  rows of silent cottages, until he came to the inn.    The place was shut, of course, and all the lights were out--it was  sometime past eleven.    The advantage an inn has over a private house, from the point of view of  the person who wants to get into it when it has been locked up, is that  a nocturnal visit is not so unexpected in the case of the former.  Preparations have been made to meet such an emergency. Where with a  private house you would probably have to wander around heaving rocks and  end by climbing up a waterspout, when you want to get into an inn you  simply ring the night bell, which, communicating with the boots' room,  has that hard-worked menial up and doing in no time.    After Mike had waited for a few minutes there was a rattling of chains  and a shooting of bolts and the door opened.    \"Yes, sir?\" said the boots, appearing in his shirt sleeves. \"Why, 'ello!  Mr. Jackson, sir!\"    Mike was well known to all dwellers in Lower Borlock, his scores being  the chief topic of conversation when the day's labors were over.    \"I want to see Mr. Barley, Jack.\"    \"He's bin' in bed this half hour back, Mr. Jackson.\"    \"I must see him. Can you get him down?\"    The boots looked doubtful. \"Roust the guv'nor outer bed?\" he said.    Mike quite admitted the gravity of the task. The landlord of the White  Boar was one of those men who need a beauty sleep.    \"I wish you would--it's a thing that can't wait. I've got some money to  give to him.\"    \"Oh, if it's _that_ ...\" said the boots.    Five minutes later mine host appeared in person, looking more than  usually portly in a check dressing gown and red bedroom slippers.    \"You can pop off, Jack.\"    Exit boots to his slumbers once more.    \"Well, Mr. Jackson, what's it all about?\"    \"Jellicoe asked me to come and bring you the money.\"    \"The money? What money?\"    \"What he owes you; the five pounds, of course.\"    \"The five--\" Mr. Barley stared openmouthed at Mike for a moment; then he  broke into a roar of laughter which shook the sporting prints on the  wall and drew barks from dogs in some distant part of the house. He  staggered about laughing and coughing till Mike began to expect a fit of  some kind. Then he collapsed into a chair, which creaked under him,"]]]
