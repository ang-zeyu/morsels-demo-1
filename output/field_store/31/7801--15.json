[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11615"],[0,"The Grammar of English Grammars (#15)"],[1,"better models or instructions  than \"the most enlightened scholars,\" is an opinion which ought not to be  disturbed by argument.    11. I regret to say, that even Dr. Webster, with all his obligations and  pretensions to literature, has well-nigh taken ground with Neef and  Cardell, as above cited; and has not forborne to throw contempt, even on  grammar as such, and on men of letters indiscriminately, by supposing the  true principles of every language to be best observed and kept by the  illiterate. What marvel then, that all his multifarious grammars of the  English language are despised? Having suggested that the learned must  follow the practice of the populace, because they cannot control it, he  adds: \"Men of letters may revolt at this suggestion, but if they will  attend to the history of our language, they will find the fact to be as  here stated. It is commonly supposed that the tendency of this practice of  unlettered men is _to corrupt the language_. But the fact is directly the  reverse. I am prepared to prove, were it consistent with the nature of this  work, that nineteen-twentieths of _all the corruptions_ of our language,  for five hundred years past, have been introduced by _authors_--men who  have made alterations in particular idioms _which they did not understand_.  The same remark is applicable to the _orthography_ and _pronunciation_. The  tendency of unlettered men is to _uniformity_--to _analogy_; and so strong  is this disposition, that the common people have actually converted some of  our irregular verbs into regular ones. It is to unlettered people that we  owe the disuse of _holpen, bounden, sitten_, and the use of the regular  participles, _swelled, helped, worked_, in place of the ancient ones. This  popular tendency is not to be contemned and disregarded, as some of the  learned affect to do;[3] for it is governed by _the natural, primary  principles of all languages_, to which we owe all their regularity and all  their melody; viz., a love of uniformity in words of a like character, and  a preference of an easy natural pronunciation, and a desire to express the  most ideas with the smallest number of words and syllables. It is a  fortunate thing for language, that these natural principles generally  prevail over arbitrary and artificial rules.\"--_Webster's Philosophical  Gram._, p. 119; _Improved Gram._, p. 78. So much for _unlettered  erudition!_    12. If every thing that has been taught under the name of grammar, is to be  considered as belonging to the science, it will be impossible ever to  determine in what estimation the study of it ought to be held; for all that  has ever been urged either for or against it, may, upon such a principle,  be _proved_ by reference to different authorities and irreconcilable  opinions. But all who are studious to know, and content to follow, _the  fashion_ established by the concurrent authority of _the learned_,[4] may  at least have some standard to refer to; and if a grammarian's rules be  based upon this authority, it must be considered the exclusive privilege  of the unlearned to despise them--as it is of the unbred, to contemn the  rules of civility. But who shall determine whether the doctrines contained  in any given treatise are, or are not, based upon such authority? Who shall  decide whether the contributions which any individual may make to our  grammatical code, are, or are not, consonant with the best usage? For this,  there is no tribunal but the mass of readers, of whom few perhaps are very  competent judges. And here an author's reputation for erudition and  judgement, may be available to him: it is the public voice in his favour.  Yet every man is at liberty to form his own opinion, and to alter it  whenever better knowledge leads him to think differently.    13. But the great misfortune is, that they who need instruction, are not  qualified to choose their instructor; and many who must make this choice  for their children, have no adequate means of ascertaining either the  qualifications of such as offer themselves, or the comparative merits of  the different methods by which they profess to teach. Hence this great  branch of learning, in itself too comprehensive for the genius or the life  of any one man, has ever been open to as various and worthless a set of  quacks and plagiaries as have ever figured in any other. There always have  been some who knew this, and there may be many who know it now; but the  credulity and ignorance which expose so great a majority of mankind to  deception and error, are not likely to be soon obviated. With every  individual who is so fortunate as to receive any of the benefits of  intellectual culture, the whole process of education must begin anew; and,  by all that sober minds can credit, the vision of human perfectibility is  far enough from any national consummation.    14. Whatever any may think of their own ability, or however some might  flout to find their errors censured or their pretensions disallowed;  whatever improvement may actually have been made, or however fondly we may  listen to boasts and felicitations on that topic; it is presumed, that the  general ignorance on the subject of grammar, as above stated, is too  obvious to be denied. What then is the remedy? and to whom must our appeal  be made? Knowledge cannot be imposed by power, nor is there any domination  in the republic of letters. The remedy lies solely in that zeal which can  provoke to a generous emulation in the cause of literature; and the appeal,  which has recourse to the learning of the learned, and to the common sense  of all, must be pressed home to conviction, till every false doctrine stand  refuted, and every weak pretender exposed or neglected. Then shall Science  honour them that honour her; and all her triumphs be told, all her  instructions be delivered, in \"sound speech that cannot be condemned.\"    15. A generous man is not unwilling to be corrected, and a just one cannot  but desire to be set right in all things. Even over noisy gainsayers, a  calm and dignified exhibition of true docrine [sic--KTH], has often more  influence than ever openly appears. I have even seen the author of a faulty  grammar heap upon his corrector more scorn and personal abuse than would  fill a large newspaper, and immediately afterwards, in a new edition of his  book, renounce the errors which had been pointed out to him, stealing the  very language of his amendments from the man whom he had so grossly  vilified! It is true that grammarians have ever disputed, and often with  more acrimony than discretion. Those who, in elementary treatises, have  meddled much with philological controversy, have well illustrated the  couplet of Denham: \"The tree of knowledge, blasted by disputes, Produces  sapless leaves in stead of fruits.\"    16. Thus, then, as I have before suggested, we find among writers on  grammar two numerous classes of authors, who have fallen into opposite  errors, perhaps equally reprehensible; the visionaries, and the copyists.  The former have ventured upon too much originality, the latter have  attempted too little. \"The science of philology,\" says Dr. Alexander  Murray, \"is not a frivolous study, fit to be conducted by ignorant pedants  or visionary enthusiasts. It requires more qualifications to succeed in it,  than are usually united in those who pursue it:--a sound penetrating  judgement; habits of calm philosophical induction; an erudition various,  extensive, and accurate; and a mind likewise, that can direct the knowledge  expressed in words, to illustrate the nature of the signs which convey  it.\"--_Murray's History of European Languages_, Vol. ii, p. 333.    17. They who set aside the authority of custom, and judge every thing to be  ungrammatical which appears to them to be unphilosophical, render the whole  ground forever disputable, and weary themselves in beating the air. So  various have been the notions of this sort of critics, that it would be  difficult to mention an opinion not found in some of their books. Amidst  this rage for speculation on a subject purely practical, various attempts  have been made, to overthrow that system of instruction, which long use has  rendered venerable, and long experience proved to be useful. But it is  manifestly much easier to raise even plausible objections against this  system, than to invent an other less objectionable. Such attempts have  generally met the reception they deserved. Their history will give no  encouragement to future innovators.    18. Again: While some have thus wasted their energies in eccentric flights,  vainly supposing that the learning of ages would give place to their  whimsical theories; others, with more success, not better deserved, have  multiplied grammars almost innumerably, by abridging or modifying the books  they had used in childhood. So that they who are at all acquainted with the  origin and character of the various compends thus introduced into our  schools, cannot but desire to see them all displaced by some abler and  better work, more honourable to its author and more useful to the public,  more intelligible to students and more helpful to teachers. Books  professedly published for the advancement of knowledge, are very frequently  to be reckoned, among its greatest impediments; for the interests of  learning are no less injured by whimsical doctrines, than the rights of  authorship by plagiarism. Too many of our grammars, profitable only to  their makers and venders, are like weights attached to the heels of Hermes.  It is discouraging to know the history of this science. But the  multiplicity of treatises already in use, is a reason, not for silence, but  for offering more. For, as Lord Bacon observes, the number of ill-written  books is not to be diminished by ceasing to write, but by writing others  which, like Aaron's serpent, shall swallow up the spurious.[5]    19. I have said that some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11620"],[0,"My Brilliant Career (#15)"],[1,"quite a sensation.\"    Now grannie's notions re the stage were very tightly laced. All actors  and actresses, from the lowest circus man up to the most glorious  cantatrice, were people defiled in the sight of God, and utterly outside  the pale of all respectability, when measured with her code of morals.    She turned energetically in her chair, and her keen eyes flashed with  scorn and anger as she spoke.    \"Go on the stage! A grand-daughter of mine! Lucy's eldest child! An  actress--a vile, low, brazen hussy! Use the gifts God has given her with  which to do good in showing off to a crowd of vile bad men! I would  rather see her struck dead at my feet this instant! I would rather see  her shear off her hair and enter a convent this very hour. Child,  promise you will never be a bold bad actress.\"    \"I will never be a _bold bad_ actress, grannie,\" I said, putting great  stress on the adjectives, and bringing out the actress very faintly.    \"Yes,\" she continued, calming down, \"I'm sure you have not enough bad in  you. You may he boisterous, and not behave with sufficient propriety  sometimes, but I don't think you are wicked enough to ever make an  actress.\"    Everard attempted to defend his case.    \"Look here, gran, that's a very exploded old notion about the stage  being a low profession. It might have been once, but it is quite the  reverse nowadays. There are, of course, low people on the stage, as  there are in all walks of life. I grant you that; but if people are good  they can be good on the stage as well as anywhere else. On account of a  little prejudice it would be a sin to rob Sybylla of the brilliant  career she might have.\"    \"Career!\" exclaimed his foster-mother, catching at the word. \"Career!  That is all girls think of now, instead of being good wives and mothers  and attending to their homes and doing what God intended. All they think  of is gadding about and being fast, and ruining themselves body and  soul. And the men are as bad to encourage them,\" looking severely at  Everard.    \"There is a great deal of truth in what you say, gran, I admit. You can  apply it to many of our girls, I am sorry to confess, but Sybylla could  not be brought under that classification. You must look at her in a  different way. If--\"    \"I look at her as the child of respectable people, and will not have the  stage mentioned in connection with her.\" Here Grannie thumped her fist  down on the table and there was silence, complete, profound. Few dared  argue with Mrs Bossier.    Dear old lady, she was never angry long, and in a minute or two she  proceeded with her breakfast, saying quite pleasantly:    \"Never mention such a subject to me again; but I'll tell you what you  can do. Next autumn, some time in March or April, when the  fruit-preserving and jam-making are done with, Helen can take the child  to Sydney for a month or so, and you can show them round. It will be a  great treat for Sybylla as she has never been in Sydney.\"    \"That's right, let's strike a bargain on that, gran,\" said Everard.    \"Yes; it's a bargain, if I hear no more about the stage. God intends His  creatures for a better life than that.\"    After breakfast I was left to entertain Everard for some while. We had a  fine time. He was a perfect gentleman and a clever conversationalist.    I was always desirous of enjoying the company of society people who were  well bred and lived according to etiquette, and possessed of leisure and  culture sufficient to fill their minds with something more than the  price of farm produce and a hard struggle for existence. Hitherto I had  only read of such or seen them in pictures, but here was a real live  one, and I seized my opportunity with vim. At my questioning and evident  interest in his talk he told me of all the latest plays, actors, and  actresses with whom he was acquainted, and described the fashionable  balls, dinners, and garden-parties he attended. Having exhausted this  subject, we fell to discussing books, and I recited snatches of poems  dear to me. Everard placed his hands upon my shoulders and said:    \"Sybylla, do you know you are a most wonderful girl? Your figure is  perfect, your style refreshing, and you have a most interesting face. It  is as ever-changing as a kaleidoscope--sometimes merry, then stern,  often sympathetic, and always sad when at rest. One would think you had  had some sorrow in your life.\"    Lifting my skirt at either side, I bowed several times very low in what  I called my stage bow, and called into requisition my stage smile, which  displayed two rows of teeth as white and perfect as any twenty-guinea  set turned out on a gold plate by a fashionable dentist.    \"The handsome gentleman is very kind to amuse himself at the expense of  a little country bumpkin, but he would do well to ascertain if his  flattery would go down before administering it next time,\" I said  sarcastically, and I heard him calling to me as I abruptly went off to  shut myself in my room.    \"How dare anyone ridicule me by paying idle brainless compliments! I  knew I was ugly, and did not want any one to perjure his soul pretending  they thought differently. What right had I to be small? Why wasn't I  possessed of a big aquiline nose and a tall commanding figure?\" Thus I  sat in burning discontent and ill-humour until soothed by the scent of  roses and the gleam of soft spring sunshine which streamed in through my  open window. Some of the flower-beds in the garden were completely  carpeted with pansy blossoms, all colours, and violets-blue and white,  single and double. The scent of mignonette, jonquils, and narcissi  filled the air. I revelled in rich perfumes, and these tempted me forth.  My ruffled feelings gave way before the delights of the old garden. I  collected a number of vases, and, filling them with water, set them on a  table in the veranda near one of the drawing-room windows. I gathered  lapfuls of the lovely blossoms, and commenced arranging them in the  vases.    Part of the old Caddagat house was built of slabs, and one of the wooden  walls ran along the veranda side of the drawing-room, so the songs aunt  Helen and Everard Grey were trying to the piano came as a sweet  accompaniment to my congenial task.    Presently they left off singing and commenced talking. Under the same  circumstances a heroine of a story would have slipped away; or, if that  were impossible without discovery, she would have put her fingers in her  ears, and would have been in a terrible state of agitation lest she  should hear something not intended for her. I did not come there with a  view to eavesdropping. It is a degradation to which I never stoop. I  thought they were aware of my presence on the veranda; but it appears  they were not, as they began to discuss me (wonderfully interesting  subject to myself), and I stayed there, without one word of disapproval  from my conscience, to listen to their conversation.    \"My word, didn't gran make a to-do this morning when I proposed to train  Sybylla for the stage! Do you know that girl is simply reeking with  talent; I must have her trained. I will keep bringing the idea before  gran until she gets used to it. I'll work the  we-should-use-the-gifts-God-has-given-us racket for all it is worth, and  you might use your influence too, Helen.\"    \"No, Everard; there are very few who succeed on the stage. I would not  use my influence, as it is a life of which I do not approve.\"    \"But Sybylla _would_ succeed. I am a personal friend of the leading  managers, and my influence would help her greatly.\"    \"Yes; but what would you do with her? A young gentleman couldn't take  charge of a girl and bring her out without ruining her reputation. There  would be no end of scandal, as the sister theory would only be  nonsense.\"    \"There is another way; I could easily stop scandal.\"    \"Everard, what do you mean!\"    \"I mean marriage,\" he replied deliberately.    \"Surely, boy, you must be dreaming! You have only seen her for an hour  or two. I don't believe in these sudden attachments.\"    Perhaps she here thought of one (her own) as sudden, which had not ended  happily.    \"Everard, don't do anything rashly. You know you are very fickle and  considered a lady-killer--be merciful to my poor little Sybylla, I pray.  It is just one of your passing fancies. Don't wile her passionate young  heart away and then leave her to pine and die.\"    \"I don't think she is that sort,\" he replied laughingly.    \"No, she would not die, but would grow into a cynic and sceptic, which  is the worst of fates. Let her alone. Flirt as much as you will with  society belles who understand the game, but leave my country maiden  alone. I hope to mould her into a splendid character yet.\"    \"But, Helen, supposing I am in earnest at last, you don't think I'd make  her a bad old hubby, do you?\"    \"She is not the girl for you. You are not the man who could ever control  her. What I say may not be complimentary but it is true. Besides, she is  not seventeen yet, and I do not approve of romantic young girls throwing  themselves into matrimony. Let them develop their womanhood first.\"    \"Then I expect I had better hide my attractions under a bushel during  the remainder of my stay at Caddagat?\"    \"Yes. Be as nice to the child as you like, but mind, none of those  little ladies'-man attentions with which it is so easy to steal--\"    I waited to hear no more, but, brimming over with a mixture of emotions,  tore through the garden and into the old orchard. Bees were busy, and  countless bright-coloured butterflies flitted hither and thither,  sipping from hundreds of trees, white or pink with bloom--their beauty  was lost upon me. I stood ankle-deep in violets, where they had run wild  under a gnarled old apple-tree, and gave way to my wounded vanity.    \"Little country maiden, indeed! There's no need for him to bag his  attractions up. If he exerted himself to the utmost of"]]]
