[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13656"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Raja Yoga (#15)"],[1,"Will is back of all action--all doing--mental  and physical.    We shall have much to say touching the Will, in these lessons and the  student should give the matter his careful attention. Let him look around  him, and he will see that the great difference between the men who have  stepped forward from the ranks, and those who remain huddled up in the  crowd, consists in Determination and Will. As Buxton has well said:  \"The longer I live, the more certain I am that the great difference  between men, the feeble and the powerful; the great and the  insignificant; is Energy and Invincible Determination.\" And he might have  added that the thing behind that \"energy and invincible determination\"  was Will.    The writers and thinkers of all ages have recognized the wonderful and  transcendent importance of the Will. Tennyson sings: \"O living Will thou  shalt endure when all that seems shall suffer shock.\" Oliver Wendell  Holmes says: \"The seat of the Will seems to vary with the organ through  which it is manifested; to transport itself to different parts of the  brain, as we may wish to recall a picture, a phrase, a melody; to throw  its force on the muscles or the intellectual processes. Like the  general-in-chief, its place is everywhere in the field of action. It is  the least like an instrument of any of our faculties; the farthest  removed from our conceptions of mechanism and matter, as we commonly  define them.\" Holmes was correct in his idea, but faulty in his details.  The Will does not change its seat, which is always in the center of the  Ego, but the Will forces the mind to all parts, and in all directions,  and it directs the _Prana_ or vital force likewise. The Will is indeed  the general-in-chief, but it does not rush to the various points of  action, but sends its messengers and couriers there to carry out its  orders. Buxton has said: \"The Will will do anything that can be done in  this world. And no talents, no circumstances, no opportunities will  make a two-legged creature a Man without it.\" Ik Marvel truly says:  \"Resolve is what makes a man manifest; not puny resolve, not crude  determinations, not errant purpose--but that strong and indefatigable  Will which treads down difficulties and danger, as a boy treads down the  heaving frost-lands of winter; which kindles his eye and brain with a  proud pulse-beat toward the unattainable. Will makes men giants.\"    The great obstacle to the proper use of the Will, in the case of the  majority of people, is the lack of ability to focus the attention. The  Yogis clearly understand this point, and many of the _Raja Yoga_  exercises which are given to the students by the teachers, are designed  to overcome this difficulty. Attention is the outward evidence of the  Will. As a French writer has said: \"The attention is subject to the  superior authority of the Ego. I yield it, or I withhold it, as I please.  I direct it in turn to several points. I concentrate it upon each point  as long as my Will can stand the effort.\" Prof. James has said: \"The  essential achievement of the Will, when it is most voluntary, is to  attend to a difficult object, and hold it fast before the mind. Effort of  Attention is the essential phenomenon of the Will.\" And Prof. Halleck  says: \"The first step toward the development of Will lies in the exercise  of Attention. Ideas grow in distinctness and motor-power as we attend to  them. If we take two ideas of the same intensity and center the attention  upon one, we shall notice how much it grows in power.\" Prof. Sully says:  \"Attention may be roughly defined as the active self-direction of the  mind to any object which presents itself at the moment.\" The word  \"Attention\" is derived from two Latin words, _ad tendere_, meaning \"to  stretch towards,\" and this is just what the Yogis know it to be. By means  of their psychic or clairvoyant sight, they see the thought of the  attentive person stretched out toward the object attended to, like a  sharp wedge, the point of which is focused upon the object under  consideration, the entire force of the thought being concentrated at that  point. This is true not only when the person is considering an object,  but when he is earnestly impressing his ideas upon another, or upon some  task to be accomplished. Attention means reaching the mind out to and  focusing it upon something.    The trained Will exhibits itself in a tenacious Attention, and this  Attention is one of the signs of the trained Will. The student must not  hastily conclude that this kind of Attention is a common faculty among  men. On the contrary it is quite rare, and is seen only among those of  \"strong\" mentality. Anyone may fasten his Attention upon some passing,  _pleasing_ thing, but it takes a trained will to fasten it upon some  unattractive thing, and hold it there. Of course the trained occultist is  able to throw interest into the most unattractive thing upon which it  becomes advisable to focus his Attention, but this, in itself, comes with  the trained Will, and is not the possession of the average man. Voluntary  Attention is rare, and is found only among strong characters. But it may  be cultivated and grown, until he who has scarcely a shade of it to-day,  in time may become a giant. It is all a matter of practice, exercise, and  Will.    It is difficult to say too much in favor of the development of the  faculty of tenacious Attention. One possessing this developed faculty is  able to accomplish far more than even a much \"brighter\" man who lacks  it. And the best way to train the Attention, under the direction of the  Will, is to practice upon _uninteresting_ objects, and ideas, holding  them before the mind until they begin to assume an Interest. This is  difficult at first, but the task soon begins to take on a pleasant  aspect, for one finds that his Will-power and Attention are growing, and  he feels himself acquiring a Force and Power that were lacking before--he  realizes that he is growing Stronger. Charles Dickens said that the  secret of his success consisted in his developing a faculty of throwing  his entire Attention into whatever he happened to be doing at the moment  and then being able to turn that same degree of Attention to the next  thing coming before him for consideration. He was like a man behind a  great searchlight, which was successively turned upon point after point,  illuminating each in turn. The \"I\" is the man behind the light, and the  Will is the reflector, the light being the Attention.    This discussion of Will and Attention may seem somewhat \"dry\" to the  student, but that is all the more reason that he should attend to it. It  is the secret that lies at the basis of the Science of _Raja Yoga_, and  the Yogi Masters have attained a degree of Concentrated Will and  Attention that would be inconceivable to the average \"man on the street.\"  By reason of this, they are able to direct the mind here and there,  outward or inward, with an enormous force. They are able to focus the  mind upon a small thing with remarkable intensity, just as the rays of  the sun may be focused through a \"sun-glass\" and caused to ignite linen,  or, on the other hand, they are able to send forth the mind with intense  energy, illuminating whatever it rests upon, just as happens in the case  of the strong electric searchlight, with which many of us are familiar.  By all means start in to cultivate the Attention and Will. Practice on  the unpleasant tasks--do the things that you have before you, and from  which you have been shrinking because they were unpleasant. Throw  interest into them, and the difficulty will vanish, and you will come out  of it much stronger, and filled with a new sense of Power.      MANTRAM (AFFIRMATION).    \"I\" have a Will--it is my inalienable property and right. I determine to  cultivate and develop it by practice and exercise. My mind is obedient to  my Will. I assert my Will over my Mind. I am Master of my mind and body.  I _assert_ my Mastery. My Will is Dynamic--full of Force and Energy, and  Power. I feel my strength. I am Strong. I am Forceful. I am Vital. I am  Center of Consciousness, Energy, Strength, and Power, and I claim my  birthright.          THE FIFTH LESSON.    THE CULTIVATION OF ATTENTION.      In our last lesson we called your attention to the fact that the Yogis  devote considerable time and practice to the acquirement of  Concentration. And we also had something to say regarding the relation  of Attention to the subject of Concentration. In this lesson we shall  have more to say on the subject of Attention, for it is one of the  important things relating to the practice of _Raja Yoga_, and the Yogis  insist upon their students practicing systematically to develop and  cultivate the faculty. Attention lies at the base of Will-power, and the  cultivation of one makes easy the exercise of the other.    To explain why we lay so much importance to the cultivation of Attention,  would necessitate our anticipating future lessons of this series, which  we do not deem advisable at this time. And so we must ask our students to  take our word for it, that all that we have to say regarding the  importance of the cultivation of Attention, is occasioned by the relation  of that subject to the use of the mind in certain directions as will  appear fully later on.    In order to let you know that we are not advancing some peculiar theory  of the Yogis, which may not be in harmony with modern Western Science, we  give you in this article a number of quotations, from Western writers and  thinkers, touching upon this important faculty of the mind, so that you  may see that the West and East agree upon this main point, however  different may be their explanations of the fact, or their use of the  power gained by the cultivation of Attention.    As we said in our last lesson, the word Attention is derived from two  Latin words \"_ad tendere_,\" meaning \"to stretch toward,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1366"],[0,"The Cloister and the Hearth (#15)"],[1," hands with rapture, and then her lips; and in a tumult  of joy ran for Peter and Martin. They came and witnessed the betrothal;  a solemn ceremony in those days, and indeed for more than a century  later, though now abolished.        CHAPTER X    The banns of marriage had to be read three times, as in our days; with  this difference, that they were commonly read on week-days, and the  young couple easily persuaded the cure to do the three readings in  twenty-four hours: he was new to the place, and their looks spoke  volumes in their favour. They were cried on Monday at matins and at  vespers; and, to their great delight, nobody from Tergou was in the  church. The next morning they were both there, palpitating with anxiety,  when, to their horror, a stranger stood up and forbade the banns, On  the score that the parties were not of age, and their parents not  consenting.    Outside the church door Margaret and Gerard held a trembling, and almost  despairing consultation; but, before they could settle anything, the man  who had done them so ill a turn approached, and gave them to understand  that he was very sorry to interfere: that his inclination was to further  the happiness of the young; but that in point of fact his only means of  getting a living was by forbidding banns: what then? \"The young people  give me a crown, and I undo my work handsomely; tell the cure I was  misinformed, and all goes smoothly.\"    \"A crown! I will give you a golden angel to do this,\" said Gerard  eagerly; the man consented as eagerly, and went with Gerard to the cure,  and told him he had made a ridiculous mistake, which a sight of the  parties had rectified. On this the cure agreed to marry the young couple  next day at ten: and the professional obstructor of bliss went home with  Gerard's angel. Like most of these very clever knaves, he was a fool,  and proceeded to drink his angel at a certain hostelry in Tergou where  was a green devoted to archery and the common sports of the day. There,  being drunk, he bragged of his day's exploit; and who should be  there, imbibing every word, but a great frequenter of the spot, the  ne'er-do-weel Sybrandt. Sybrandt ran home to tell his father; his father  was not at home; he was gone to Rotterdam to buy cloth of the merchants.  Catching his elder brother's eye, he made him a signal to come out, and  told him what he had heard.    There are black sheep in nearly every large family; and these two were  Gerard's black brothers. Idleness is vitiating: waiting for the death of  those we ought to love is vitiating; and these two one-idea'd curs were  ready to tear any one to death that should interfere with that miserable  inheritance which was their thought by day and their dream by night.  Their parents' parsimony was a virtue; it was accompanied by industry,  and its motive was love of their offspring; but in these perverse and  selfish hearts that homely virtue was perverted into avarice, than which  no more fruitful source of crimes is to be found in nature.    They put their heads together, and agreed not to tell their mother,  whose sentiments were so uncertain, but to go first to the burgomaster.  They were cunning enough to see that he was averse to the match, though  they could not divine why.    Ghysbrecht Van Swieten saw through them at once; but he took care not  to let them see through him. He heard their story, and putting on  magisterial dignity and coldness, he said;    \"Since the father of the family is not here, his duty falleth on me, who  am the father of the town. I know your father's mind; leave all to me;  and, above all, tell not a woman a word of this, least of all the women  that are in your own house: for chattering tongues mar wisest counsels.\"    So he dismissed them, a little superciliously: he was ashamed of his  confederates.    On their return home they found their brother Gerard seated on a low  stool at their mother's knee: she was caressing his hair with her hand,  speaking very kindly to him, and promising to take his part with his  father and thwart his love no more. The main cause of this change of  mind was characteristic of the woman. She it was who in a moment of  female irritation had cut Margaret's picture to pieces. She had watched  the effect with some misgivings, and had seen Gerard turn pale as death,  and sit motionless like a bereaved creature, with the pieces in his  hands, and his eyes fixed on them till tears came and blinded them. Then  she was terrified at what she had done; and next her heart smote her  bitterly; and she wept sore apart; but, being what she was, dared not  own it, but said to herself, \"I'll not say a word, but I'll make it up  to him.\" And her bowels yearned over her son, and her feeble violence  died a natural death, and she was transferring her fatal alliance to  Gerard when the two black sheep came in. Gerard knew nothing of the  immediate cause; on the contrary, inexperienced as he was in the ins  and outs of females, her kindness made him ashamed of a suspicion he  had entertained that she was the depredator, and he kissed her again  and again, and went to bed happy as a prince to think his mother was his  mother once more at the very crisis of his fate.    The next morning, at ten o'clock, Gerard and Margaret were in the church  at Sevenbergen, he radiant with joy, she with blushes. Peter was  also there, and Martin Wittenhaagen, but no other friend. Secrecy was  everything. Margaret had declined Italy. She could not leave her father;  he was too learned and too helpless. But it was settled they should  retire into Flanders for a few weeks until the storm should be blown  over at Tergou. The cure did not keep them waiting long, though it  seemed an age. Presently he stood at the altar, and called them to him.  They went hand in hand, the happiest in Holland. The cure opened his  book.    But ere he uttered a single word of the sacred rite, a harsh voice cried  \"Forbear!\" And the constables of Tergou came up the aisle and seized  Gerard in the name of the law. Martin's long knife flashed out directly.    \"Forbear, man!\" cried the priest. \"What! draw your weapon in a church,  and ye who interrupt this holy sacrament, what means this impiety?\"    \"There is no impiety, father,\" said the burgomaster's servant  respectfully. \"This young man would marry against his father's will, and  his father has prayed our burgomaster to deal with him according to the  law. Let him deny it if he can.\"    \"Is this so, young man?\"    Gerard hung his head.    \"We take him to Rotterdam to abide the sentence of the Duke.\"    At this Margaret uttered a cry of despair, and the young creatures, who  were so happy a moment ago, fell to sobbing in one another's arms so  piteously, that the instruments of oppression drew back a step and were  ashamed; but one of them that was good-natured stepped up under pretence  of separating them, and whispered to Margaret:    \"Rotterdam? it is a lie. We but take him to our Stadthouse.\"    They took him away on horseback, on the road to Rotterdam; and, after a  dozen halts, and by sly detours, to Tergou. Just outside the town they  were met by a rude vehicle covered with canvas. Gerard was put into  this, and about five in the evening was secretly conveyed into the  prison of the Stadthouse. He was taken up several flights of stairs  and thrust into a small room lighted only by a narrow window, with a  vertical iron bar. The whole furniture was a huge oak chest.    Imprisonment in that age was one of the highroads to death. It is  horrible in its mildest form; but in those days it implied cold,  unbroken solitude, torture, starvation, and often poison. Gerard felt he  was in the hands of an enemy.    \"Oh, the look that man gave me on the road to Rotterdam. There is more  here than my father's wrath. I doubt I shall see no more the light of  day.\" And he kneeled down and commended his soul to God.    Presently he rose and sprang at the iron bar of the window, and clutched  it. This enabled him to look out by pressing his knees against the wall.  It was but for a minute; but in that minute he saw a sight such as none  but a captive can appreciate.    Martin Wittenhaagen's back.    Martin was sitting, quietly fishing in the brook near the Stadthouse.    Gerard sprang again at the window, and whistled. Martin instantly showed  that he was watching much harder than fishing. He turned hastily round  and saw Gerard--made him a signal, and taking up his line and bow, went  quickly off.    Gerard saw by this that his friends were not idle: yet had rather Martin  had stayed. The very sight of him was a comfort. He held on, looking  at the soldier's retiring form as long as he could, then falling back  somewhat heavily wrenched the rusty iron bar, held only by rusty nails,  away from the stone-work just as Ghysbrecht Van Swieten opened the door  stealthily behind him. The burgomaster's eye fell instantly on the iron,  and then glanced at the window; but he said nothing. The window was a  hundred feet from the ground; and if Gerard had a fancy for jumping out,  why should he balk it? He brought a brown loaf and a pitcher of water,  and set them on the chest in solemn silence. Gerard's first impulse  was to brain him with the iron bar and fly down the stairs; but the  burgomaster seeing something wicked in his eye, gave a little cough, and  three stout fellows, armed, showed themselves directly at the door.    \"My orders are to keep you thus until you shall bind yourself by an oath  to leave Margaret Brandt, and return to the Church, to which you have  belonged from your cradle.\"    \"Death sooner.\"    \"With all my heart.\" And the burgomaster retired.    Martin went with all speed to Sevenbergen; there he found Margaret pale  and agitated, but full of resolution and energy. She was just finishing  a letter to the Countess Charolois, appealing to her against the  violence and treachery of Ghysbrecht.    \"Courage!\""]]]
