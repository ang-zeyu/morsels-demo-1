[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10556"],[0,"The Old Man in the Corner (#15)"],[1,"Street mystery, and  the trial of Smethurst, had I seen so much excitement. Mind you, I was  not excited--I knew by now every detail of that crime as if I had  committed it myself. In fact, I could not have done it better, although  I have been a student of crime for many years now. Many people  there--his friends, mostly--believed that Errington was doomed. I think  he thought so, too, for I could see that his face was terribly white,  and he now and then passed his tongue over his lips, as if they were  parched.    \"You see he was in the awful dilemma--a perfectly natural one, by the  way--of being absolutely incapable of _proving_ an _alibi_. The  crime--if crime there was--had been committed three weeks ago. A man  about town like Mr. Frank Errington might remember that he spent certain  hours of a special afternoon at his club, or in the Park, but it is very  doubtful in nine cases out of ten if he can find a friend who could  positively swear as to having seen him there. No! no! Mr. Errington was  in a tight corner, and he knew it. You see, there were--besides the  evidence--two or three circumstances which did not improve matters for  him. His hobby in the direction of toxicology, to begin with. The police  had found in his room every description of poisonous substances,  including prussic acid.    \"Then, again, that journey to Marseilles, the start for Colombo, was,  though perfectly innocent, a very unfortunate one. Mr. Errington had  gone on an aimless voyage, but the public thought that he had fled,  terrified at his own crime. Sir Arthur Inglewood, however, here again  displayed his marvellous skill on behalf of his client by the masterly  way in which he literally turned all the witnesses for the Crown inside  out.    \"Having first got Mr. Andrew Campbell to state positively that in the  accused he certainly did _not_ recognize the man in the tweed suit, the  eminent lawyer, after twenty minutes' cross-examination, had so  completely upset the stockbroker's equanimity that it is very likely he  would not have recognized his own office-boy.    \"But through all his flurry and all his annoyance Mr. Andrew Campbell  remained very sure of one thing; namely, that the lady was alive and  cheerful, and talking pleasantly with the man in the tweed suit up to  the moment when the latter, having shaken hands with her, left her with  a pleasant '_Au revoir_! Don't be late to-night.' He had heard neither  scream nor struggle, and in his opinion, if the individual in the tweed  suit had administered a dose of poison to his companion, it must have  been with her own knowledge and free will; and the lady in the train  most emphatically neither looked nor spoke like a woman prepared for a  sudden and violent death.    \"Mr. James Verner, against that, swore equally positively that he had  stood in full view of the carriage door from the moment that Mr.  Campbell got out until he himself stepped into the compartment, that  there was no one else in that carriage between Farringdon Street and  Aldgate, and that the lady, to the best of his belief, had made no  movement during the whole of that journey.    \"No; Frank Errington was _not_ committed for trial on the capital  charge,\" said the man in the corner with one of his sardonic smiles,  \"thanks to the cleverness of Sir Arthur Inglewood, his lawyer. He  absolutely denied his identity with the man in the tweed suit, and swore  he had not seen Mrs. Hazeldene since eleven o'clock in the morning of  that fatal day. There was no _proof_ that he had; moreover, according to  Mr. Campbell's opinion, the man in the tweed suit was in all probability  not the murderer. Common sense would not admit that a woman could have a  deadly poison injected into her without her knowledge, while chatting  pleasantly to her murderer.    \"Mr. Errington lives abroad now. He is about to marry. I don't think any  of his real friends for a moment believed that he committed the  dastardly crime. The police think they know better. They do know this  much, that it could not have been a case of suicide, that if the man who  undoubtedly travelled with Mrs. Hazeldene on that fatal afternoon had no  crime upon his conscience he would long ago have come forward and thrown  what light he could upon the mystery.    \"As to who that man was, the police in their blindness have not the  faintest doubt. Under the unshakable belief that Errington is guilty  they have spent the last few months in unceasing labour to try and find  further and stronger proofs of his guilt. But they won't find them,  because there are none. There are no positive proofs against the actual  murderer, for he was one of those clever blackguards who think of  everything, foresee every eventuality, who know human nature well, and  can foretell exactly what evidence will be brought against them, and act  accordingly.    \"This blackguard from the first kept the figure, the personality, of  Frank Errington before his mind. Frank Errington was the dust which the  scoundrel threw metaphorically in the eyes of the police, and you must  admit that he succeeded in blinding them--to the extent even of making  them entirely forget the one simple little sentence, overheard by Mr.  Andrew Campbell, and which was, of course, the clue to the whole  thing--the only slip the cunning rogue made--'_Au revoir_! Don't be late  to-night.' Mrs. Hazeldene was going that night to the opera with her  husband--    \"You are astonished?\" he added with a shrug of the shoulders, \"you do  not see the tragedy yet, as I have seen it before me all along. The  frivolous young wife, the flirtation with the friend?--all a blind, all  pretence. I took the trouble which the police should have taken  immediately, of finding out something about the finances of the  Hazeldene _menage_. Money is in nine cases out of ten the keynote to a  crime.    \"I found that the will of Mary Beatrice Hazeldene had been proved by  the husband, her sole executor, the estate being sworn at L15,000. I  found out, moreover, that Mr. Edward Sholto Hazeldene was a poor  shipper's clerk when he married the daughter of a wealthy builder in  Kensington--and then I made note of the fact that the disconsolate  widower had allowed his beard to grow since the death of his wife.    \"There's no doubt that he was a clever rogue,\" added the strange  creature, leaning excitedly over the table, and peering into Polly's  face. \"Do you know how that deadly poison was injected into the poor  woman's system? By the simplest of all means, one known to every  scoundrel in Southern Europe. A ring--yes! a ring, which has a tiny  hollow needle capable of holding a sufficient quantity of prussic acid  to have killed two persons instead of one. The man in the tweed suit  shook hands with his fair companion--probably she hardly felt the prick,  not sufficiently in any case to make her utter a scream. And, mind you,  the scoundrel had every facility, through his friendship with Mr.  Errington, of procuring what poison he required, not to mention his  friend's visiting card. We cannot gauge how many months ago he began to  try and copy Frank Errington in his style of dress, the cut of his  moustache, his general appearance, making the change probably so  gradual, that no one in his own _entourage_ would notice it. He  selected for his model a man his own height and build, with the same  coloured hair.\"    \"But there was the terrible risk of being identified by his  fellow-traveller in the Underground,\" suggested Polly.    \"Yes, there certainly was that risk; he chose to take it, and he was  wise. He reckoned that several days would in any case elapse before that  person, who, by the way, was a business man absorbed in his newspaper,  would actually see him again. The great secret of successful crime is to  study human nature,\" added the man in the corner, as he began looking  for his hat and coat. \"Edward Hazeldene knew it well.\"    \"But the ring?\"    \"He may have bought that when he was on his honeymoon,\" he suggested  with a grim chuckle; \"the tragedy was not planned in a week, it may have  taken years to mature. But you will own that there goes a frightful  scoundrel unhung. I have left you his photograph as he was a year ago,  and as he is now. You will see he has shaved his beard again, but also  his moustache. I fancy he is a friend now of Mr. Andrew Campbell.\"    He left Miss Polly Burton wondering, not knowing what to believe.    And that is why she missed her appointment with Mr. Richard Frobisher  (of the _London Mail_) to go and see Maud Allan dance at the Palace  Theatre that afternoon.          CHAPTER XII    THE LIVERPOOL MYSTERY      \"A title--a foreign title, I mean--is always very useful for purposes of  swindles and frauds,\" remarked the man in the corner to Polly one day.  \"The cleverest robberies of modern times were perpetrated lately in  Vienna by a man who dubbed himself Lord Seymour; whilst over here the  same class of thief calls himself Count Something ending in 'o,' or  Prince the other, ending in 'off.'\"    \"Fortunately for our hotel and lodging-house keepers over here,\" she  replied, \"they are beginning to be more alive to the ways of foreign  swindlers, and look upon all titled gentry who speak broken English as  possible swindlers or thieves.\"    \"The result sometimes being exceedingly unpleasant to the real _grands  seigneurs_ who honour this country at times with their visits,\" replied  the man in the corner. \"Now, take the case of Prince Semionicz, a man  whose sixteen quarterings are duly recorded in Gotha, who carried enough  luggage with him to pay for the use of every room in an hotel for at  least a week, whose gold cigarette case with diamond and turquoise  ornament was actually stolen without his taking the slightest trouble to  try and recover it; that same man was undoubtedly looked upon with  suspicion by the manager of the Liverpool North-Western Hotel from the  moment"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10574"],[0,"The History of England, Volume I (#15)"],[1," He allowed the  proprietors to retain possession of their lands, encouraged marriages  and alliances between them and his ancient subjects, and gave them the  privilege of being governed by the same laws.  These laws he augmented  and ascertained, and though he was disturbed by some insurrections at  home, his long reign of thirty-seven years may be regarded as one of  the most glorious and most prosperous of the Heptarchy.  In the  decline of his age he made a pilgrimage to Rome, and after his return,  shut himself up in a cloister, where he died.  [FN [y] Chron. Sax. p. 22.  [z] Higden, lib. 5.  Chron. Sax. p. 15.  Ann. Beverl. p. 93.  [a] Bede, lib 4 cap 12.  Chron. Sax. p. 41.]    Though the kings of Wessex had always been princes of the blood,  descended from Cerdic, the founder of the monarchy, the order of  succession had been far from exact, and a more remote prince had often  found means to mount the throne in preference to one descended from a  nearer branch of the royal family.  Ina, therefore, having no children  of his own, and lying much under the influence of Ethelburga, his  queen, left by will the succession to Adelard, her brother, who was  his remote kinsman; but this destination did not take place without  some difficulty.  Oswald, a prince more nearly allied to the crown,  took arms against Adelard; but he being suppressed, and dying soon  after, the title of Adelard was not any farther disputed, and, in the  year 741, he was succeeded by his cousin, Cudred.  The reign of this  prince was distinguished by a great victory, which he obtained by  means of Edelhun, his general, over Ethelbald, King of Mercia.  His  death made way for Sigebert, his kinsman, who governed so ill, that  his people rose in an insurrection and dethroned him, crowning Cenulph  in his stead.  The exiled prince found a refuge with Duke Cumbran,  governor of Hampshire, who, that he might add new obligations to  Sigebert, gave him many salutary counsels for his future conduct,  accompanied with some reprehensions for the past.  But these were so  much resented by the ungrateful prince, that he conspired against the  life of his protector, and treacherously murdered him.  After this  infamous action, he was forsaken by all the world, and skulking about  in the wilds and forests, was at last discovered by a servant of  Cumbran's, who instantly took revenge upon him for the murder of his  master [b].  [FN [b] Higden, lib. 5.  W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 2.]    Cenulph, who had obtained the crown on the expulsion of Sigebert, was  fortunate in many expeditions against the Britons of Cornwall, but  afterwards lost some reputation by his ill success against Offa, King  of Mercia [c].  Kynehard also, brother to the deposed Sigebert, gave  him disturbance, and though expelled the kingdom, he hovered on the  frontiers, and watched an opportunity for attacking his rival.  The  king had an intrigue with a young woman who lived at Merton in Surrey,  whither having secretly retired, he was on a sudden environed, in the  night time, by Kynehard and his followers, and, after making a  vigorous resistance, was murdered with all his attendants.  The  nobility and people of the neighbourhood, rising next day in arms,  took revenge on Kynehard for the slaughter of their king, and put  every one to the sword who had been engaged in that criminal  enterprise.  This event happened in 784.  [FN [c] W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap 3.]    Brithric next obtained possession of the government, though remotely  descended from the royal family, but he enjoyed not that dignity  without inquietude.  Eoppa, nephew to King Ina, by his brother Ingild,  who died before that prince, had begot Eta, father to Alchmond, from  whom sprung Egbert [d], a young man of the most promising hopes, who  gave great jealousy to Brithric, the reigning prince, both because he  seemed by his birth better entitled to the crown, and because he had  acquired, to an eminent degree, the affections of the people.  Egbert,  sensible of his danger from the suspicions of Brithric, secretly  withdrew into France [e], where he was well received by Charlemagne.  By living in the court, and serving in the armies of that prince, the  most able and most generous that had appeared in Europe during several  ages, he acquired those accomplishments which afterwards enabled him  to make such a shining figure on the throne; and familiarizing himself  to the manners of the French, who, as Malmesbury observes [f], were  eminent both for valour and civility above all the western nations, he  learned to polish the rudeness and barbarity of the Saxon character:  his early misfortunes thus proved of singular advantage to him.  [FN [d] Chron. Sax. p. 16.  [e] H. Hunting. lib. 4.  [f] Lib. 2 cap.  11.]    It was not long ere Egbert had opportunities of displaying his natural  and acquired talents.  Brithric, King of Wessex, had married Eadburga,  natural daughter of Offa, King of Mercia, a profligate woman, equally  infamous for cruelty and for incontinence.  Having great influence  over her husband, she often instigated him to destroy such of the  nobility as were obnoxious to her; and where this expedient failed,  she scrupled not being herself active in traitorous attempts against  them.  She had mixed a cup of poison for a young nobleman who had  acquired her husband's friendship, and had on that account become the  object of her jealousy; but, unfortunately, the king drank of the  fatal cup along with his favourite, and soon after expired [g].  This  tragical incident, joined to her other crimes, rendered Eadburga so  odious, that she was obliged to fly into France, whence Egbert was at  the same time recalled by the nobility, in order to ascent the throne  of his ancestors [h].  He attained that dignity in the last year of  the eighth century.  [FN [g] Higden, lib. 5.  M. West. p. 152.  Asser. in vita Alfredi, p.  3. ex edit. Camdeni.  [h] Chron. Sax. A. D. 800.  Brompton, p. 801.]    In the kingdoms of the Heptarchy, an exact rule of succession was  either unknown or not strictly observed, and thence the reigning  prince was continually agitated with jealousy against all the princes  of the blood, whom  he still considered as rivals, and whose death  alone could give him entire security in his possession of the throne.  From this fatal cause, together with the admiration of the monastic  life, and the opinion of merit attending the preservation of chastity  even in a married state, the royal families had been entirely  extinguished in all the kingdoms except that of Wessex, and the  emulations, suspicions, and conspiracies, which had formerly been  confined to the princes of the blood alone, were now diffused among  all the nobility in the several Saxon states.  Egbert was the sole  descendant of those first conquerors who subdued Britain, and who  enhanced their authority by claiming a pedigree from Woden, the  supreme divinity of their ancestors.  But that prince, though invited  by this favourable circumstance to make attempts on the neighbouring  Saxons, gave them for some time no disturbance, and rather chose to  turn his arms against the Britons in Cornwall, whom he defeated in  several [i] battles.  He was recalled from the conquest of that  country by an invasion made upon his dominions by Bernulf, King of  Mercia.  [FN [i] Chron. Sax. p. 69.]    The Mercians, before the accession of Egbert, had very nearly attained  the absolute sovereignty in the Heptarchy; they had reduced the East  Angles under subjection, and established tributary princes in the  kingdoms of Kent and Essex.  Northumberland was involved in anarchy;  and no state of any consequence remained but that of Wessex, which,  much inferior in extent to Mercia, was supported solely by the great  qualities of its sovereign.  Egbert led his army against the invaders,  and encountering them at Ellandun, in Wiltshire, obtained a complete  victory, and by the great slaughter which he made of them in their  flight, gave a mortal blow to the power of the Mercians.  Whilst he  himself, in prosecution of his victory, entered their country on the  side of Oxfordshire, and threatened the heart of their dominions, he  sent an army into Kent, commanded by Ethelwolf, his eldest son [k],  and expelling Baldred, the tributary king, soon made himself master of  that country.  The kingdom of Essex was conquered with equal facility,  and the East Angles, from their hatred to the Mercian government,  which had been established over them by treachery and violence, and  probably exercised with tyranny, immediately rose in arms, and craved  the protection of Egbert [l].  Bernulf, the Mercian king, who marched  against them, was defeated and slain; and two years after, Ludican,  his successor, met with the same fate.  These insurrections and  calamities facilitated the enterprises of Egbert, who advanced into  the centre of the Mercian territories, and made easy conquests over a  dispirited and divided people.  In order to engage them more easily to  submission, he allowed Wiglef, their countryman, to retain the title  of king, while he himself exercised the real powers of sovereignty  [m].  The anarchy which prevailed in Northumberland, tempted him to  carry still farther his victorious arms; and the inhabitants, unable  to resist his power, and desirous of possessing some established form  of government, were forward, on his first appearance, to send  deputies, who submitted to his authority, and swore allegiance to him  as their sovereign.  Egbert, however, still allowed to Northumberland,  as he had done to Mercia and East Anglia, the power of electing a  king, who paid him tribute, and was dependent on him.
