The author, Louis Jacques Rousseau,  a cousin of the great Jean Jacques, belonged to a family of noted  Orientalists. Born in Persia, and married to the daughter of the Dutch  consul-general to that country, he was admirably equipped for the  distinguished diplomatic career that lay before him in the East and in  northern Africa. His treatises on the archaeological remains that he met  with on his many voyages are intelligent and thorough. The river towns  have changed but little in the last hundred years, and the sketch of Hit  might have been made only yesterday.    Within three days after the rise, the waters of the Wadi Hauran subsided  sufficiently for us to cross, and I received orders to return to Baghdad.  The rain had brought about a change in the desert since we passed through  on our way up. The lines of Paterson, the Australian poet, kept running  through my head:        \"For the rain and drought and sunshine make no changes in the street,      In the sullen line of buildings and the ceaseless tramp of feet,      But the bush hath moods and changes, as the seasons rise and fall,      And the men who know the bushland they are loyal through it all.\"    The formerly arid floor of the desert was carpeted with a soft green, with  myriads of little flowers, all small, but delicately fashioned. There  were poppies, dwarf daisies, expanses of buttercups, forget-me-nots, and  diminutive red flowers whose name I did not know. It started raining  again, and we only just succeeded in winning our way through to Baghdad  before the road became impassable.          VI    BAGHDAD SKETCHES      Although never in Baghdad for long at a time, I generally had occasion to  spend four or five days there every other month. The life in any city is  complex and interesting, but here it was especially so. We were among a  totally foreign people, but the ever-felt intangible barrier of color was  not present. For many of the opportunities to mingle with the natives I  was indebted to Oscar Heizer, the American consul. Mr. Heizer has been  twenty-five years in the Levant, the greater part of which time he has  spent in the neighborhood of Constantinople. The outbreak of the war found  him stationed at one of the principal ports of the Black Sea. There he  witnessed part of the terrible Armenian massacres, when vast herds of the  wretched people were driven inland to perish of starvation by the  roadsides. Quiet and unassuming, but ever ready to act with speed and  decision, he was a universal favorite with native and foreigner alike.    With him I used to ferry across the river for tea with the Asadulla Khan,  the Persian consul. The house consisted of three wings built around a  garden. The fourth side was the river-bank. The court was a jungle of  flowering fruit-trees, alive with birds of different kinds, all singing  garrulously without pause. There we would sit sipping sherbet, and  cracking nuts, among which salted watermelon seeds figured prominently.  Coffee and sweets of many and devious kinds were served, with arrack and  Scotch whiskey for those who had no religious scruples. The Koran's  injunction against strong drink was not very conscientiously observed by  the majority, and even those who did not drink in public, rarely abstained  in private. Only the very conservative--and these were more often to be  found in the smaller towns--rigorously obeyed the prophet's commands. It  was pleasant to smoke in the shade and watch the varied river-craft  slipping by. The public bellams plied to and fro, rowed by the swart  owners, while against them jostled the gufas--built like the coracles of  ancient Britain--a round basket coated with pitch. No Anglo-Saxon can see  them without thinking of the nursery rhyme of the \"wise men of Gotham who  went to sea in a tub.\" These gufas were some of them twenty-five feet in  diameter, and carried surprising loads--sometimes sheep and cattle  alone--sometimes men and women--often both indiscriminately mingled.  Propelling a gufa was an art in itself, for in the hands of the  uninitiated it merely spun around without advancing a foot in the desired  direction. The natives used long round-bladed paddles, and made good time  across the river. Crossing over in one was a democratic affair, especially  when the women were returning from market with knots of struggling  chickens slung over their shoulders.    Asadulla Khan's profile always reminded me of an Inca idol that I once got  in Peru. Among his scribes were several men of culture who discoursed most  sagely on Persian literature; on Sadi and Hafiz, both of whom they held to  be superior to Omar Khayyam. I tried through many channels to secure a  manuscript of the \"Rubaiyat,\" but all I succeeded in obtaining was a  lithograph copy with no place or date of publication; merely the remark  that it had been printed during the cold months. I was told that the  writings of Omar Khayyam were regarded as immoral and for that reason were  not to be found in religious households. My Persian friends would quote  at length from Sadi's _Gulistan_ or _Rose Garden_, and go into raptures  over its beauty.           *       *       *       *       *    Below the consulate was a landing-place, and when we were ready to leave  we would go down to the river-bank preceded by our servants carrying  lanterns. They would call \"Abu bellam\" until a boat appeared. The term  \"abu\" always amused me. Its literal meaning is \"father.\" In the bazaars a  shop-owner was always hailed as \"father\" of whatever wares he had for  sale. I remember one fat old man who sold porous earthenware  jars--customers invariably addressed him as \"Abu hub\"--\"Father of  water-coolers.\"    My best friend among the natives was a Kurdish chief named Hamdi Bey  Baban. His father had been captured and taken to Constantinople. After  living there a number of years in semicaptivity he died--by poison it was  said. Hamdi was not allowed to return to Kurdistan until after he was a  grown man and had almost forgotten his native language. He spoke and read  both French and English. Eventually permission was granted him to live in  Baghdad as long as he kept out of the Kurdish hills, so he set off by  motor accompanied only by a French chauffeur. Gasolene was sent ahead by  camel caravan to be left for him at selected points. The journey was not  without incident, for the villagers had never before seen an automobile  and regarded it as a devil; often stones were thrown at them, and on one  occasion they were mobbed and Hamdi only escaped by driving full speed  through the crowd.    His existence in Baghdad had been subject to sudden upheavals. Once he was  arrested and convoyed back to Constantinople; and just before the advance  of the British his life was in great danger. Naturally enough he had  little love for the Turk and staked everything on the final victory of the  Allies.    He intended writing a book on the history of his family, in which he was  much interested. For material he was constantly purchasing books and  manuscripts. In the East many well-known histories still exist only in  manuscript form, and when a man wishes to build up a library he engages  scribes and sends them to the place where a famous manuscript is kept with  an order to make a copy. In the same way Hamdi Bey had men busied  transcribing rare chronicles dealing with the career of his family--extant  in but one or two examples in mosques. He once presented me with a large  manuscript in Persian in which his family is mentioned, the mention taking  the form of a statement to the effect that seventeen of them had had their  heads removed!    Next to various small tradesmen with whom I used to gossip, drink coffee,  and play dominoes, my best Arab friend was Abdul Kader Pasha, a striking  old man who had been a faithful ally to the British through thick and  thin. The dinners at his house on the river-bank were feasts such as one  reads of in ancient history. Course succeeded course without any definite  plan; any one of them would have made a large and delicious meal in  itself. True to Arab custom, the son of the house never sat down at table  with his father, although before and after dinner he talked and smoked  with us.    [Illustration: A jeweller's booth in the bazaar]    I had a number of good friends among the Armenians. There was not one of  them but had some near relation, frequently a parent or a brother or  sister, still among the Turks. Sometimes they knew them to be dead, more  frequently they could only hope that such was the case and there was no  further suffering to be endured. Many of these Armenians belonged to  prominent families, numbering among their members men who had held the  most important government posts in Constantinople. The secretary of the  treasury was almost invariably an Armenian, for the race outstrips the  Jews in its money touch.    With one family I dined quite often--the usual interminable Oriental feast  varying only from the Arab or Turkish dinners in a few special national  dishes. All, excepting the aged grandmother, spoke French, and the  daughters had a thorough grounding in the literature. Such English books  as they knew they had read in French translations. The house was  attractively furnished, with really beautiful rugs and old silverware. The  younger generation played bridge, and the girls were always well dressed  in European fashion. Whence the clothes came was a mystery, for nothing  could have been brought in since the war, and even in ante-bellum days  foreign clothes of that grade could never have been stocked but must have  been imported in individual orders. The evenings were thoroughly  enjoyable, for everything was in such marked contrast to our every-day  life. It must be remembered that these few Armenians were the only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13670"],[0,"The Happy Family (#15)"],[1,"real interest, though he was thinking fast.    Mr. Coleman looked nonplussed. \"But I thought--you said--\"    \"What I said,\" Andy retorted evenly, \"hit the blue roan two years ago;  maybe he's reformed since then; I dunno. Nobody's rode him, here.\" He  could not resist a sidelong glance at Happy Jack. \"There was some talk  of it, but it never come to a head.\"    \"Yuh offered me a hundred dollars--\" Happy Jack began accusingly.    \"And yuh never made no move to earn it, that I know of. By gracious,  yuh all seem to think I ought to _mind_-read that hoss! I ain't seen  him for two years. Maybe so, he's a real wolf yet; maybe so, he's a  sheep.\" He threw out both his hands to point the end of the  argument--so far as he was concerned--stuck them deep into his  trousers' pockets and walked away before he could be betrayed into  deeper deceit. It did seem to him rather hard that, merely because he  had wanted the roan badly enough to--er--exercise a little diplomacy  in order to get him, they should keep harping on the subject like  that. And to have Coleman making medicine to get the roan into that  contest was, to say the least, sickening. Andy's private belief was  that a twelve-year-old girl could go round up the milk-cows on that  horse. He had never known him to make a crooked move, and he had  ridden beside him all one summer and had seen him in all places and  under all possible conditions. He was a dandy cow-horse, and dead  gentle; all this talk made him tired. Andy had forgotten that he  himself had started the talk.    Coleman went often to the corral when the horses were in, and looked  at the blue roan. Later he rode on to other ranches where he had heard  were bad horses, and left the roan for further consideration. When he  was gone, Andy breathed freer and put his mind to the coming contest  and the things he meant to do with the purse and with the other  contestants.    \"That Diamond G twister is going t' ride,\" Happy Jack announced, one  day when he came from town. \"Some uh the boys was in town and they  said so. He can ride, too. I betche Andy don't have no picnic gitting  the purse away from _that_ feller. And Coleman's got that sorrel  outlaw uh the HS. I betche Andy'll have to pull leather on that one.\"  This was, of course, treason pure and simple; but Happy Jack's  prophecies were never taken seriously.    Andy simply grinned at him. \"Put your money on the Diamond G twister,\"  he advised calmly. \"I know him--he's a good rider, too. His name's  Billy Roberts. Uh course, I aim to beat him to it, but Happy never  does like to have a sure-thing. He wants something to hang his jaw  down over. Put your money on Billy and watch it fade away, Happy.\"    \"Aw, gwan. I betche that there sorrel--\"    \"I rode that there sorrel once, and combed his forelock with both  spurs alternate,\" Andy lied boldly. \"He's pickings. Take him back and  bring me a real hoss.\"    Happy Jack wavered. \"Well, I betche yuh don't pull down that money,\"  he predicted vaguely. \"I betche yuh git throwed, or something. It  don't do to be too blame sure uh nothing.\"    Whereat Andy laughed derisively and went away whistling. \"I wish I was  as sure uh living till I was a thousand years old, and able to ride  nine months out of every year of 'em,\" he called back to Happy. Then  he took up the tune where he had left off.    For the days were still crisp at both ends and languorous in the  middle, and wind and grasses hushed and listened for the coming of  winter. And because of these things, and his youth and his health, the  heart of Andy Green was light in his chest and trouble stood afar off  with its face turned from him.    It was but three days to the opening of the fair when Coleman,  returning that way from his search for bad horses, clattered, with his  gleanings and three or four men to help drive them, down the grade to  the Flying U. And in the Flying U coulee, just across the creek from  the corrals, still rested the roundup tents for a space. For the  shipping was over early and work was not urgent, and Chip and the Old  Man, in their enthusiasm for the rough-riding contest and the entry of  their own man, had decided to take the wagons and crew entire to Great  Falls and camp throughout the four days of the fair. The boys all  wanted to go, anyway, as did everybody else, so that nothing could be  done till it was over. It was a novel idea, and it tickled the humor  of the Happy Family.    The \"rough string,\" as the bad horses were called, was corralled, and  the men made merry with the roundup crew. Diamond G men they were,  loudly proclaiming their faith in Billy Roberts, and offering bets  already against Andy, who listened undisturbed and had very little to  say. The Happy Family had faith in him, and that was enough. If  everybody, he told them, believed that he would win, where would be  the fun of riding and showing them?    It was after their early supper that Coleman came down to camp at the  heels of Chip and the Old Man. Straightway he sought out Andy like a  man who has something on his mind; though Andy did not in the least  know what it was, he recognized the indefinable symptoms and braced  himself mentally, half suspecting that it was something about that  blue roan again. He was getting a little bit tired of the blue  roan--enough so that, though he had chosen him for his string, he had  not yet put saddle to his back, but waited until the roundup started  out once more, when he would ride him in his turn.    It was the blue roan, without doubt. Coleman came to a stop directly  in front of Andy, and as directly came to the point.    \"Look here, Green,\" he began. \"I'm shy on horses for that contest, and  Whitmore and Bennett say I can have that roan you've got in your  string. If he's as bad as you claim, I certainly must have him. But  you seem to have some doubts of what he'll do, and I'd like to see him  ridden once. Your shingle is out as a broncho-peeler. Will you ride  him this evening, so I can size him up for that contest?\"    Andy glanced up under his eyebrows, and then sidelong at the crowd.  Every man within hearing was paying strict attention, and was eyeing  him expectantly; for broncho-fighting is a spectacle that never palls.    \"Well, I can ride him, if yuh say so,\" Andy made cautious answer, \"but  I won't gamble he's a bad hoss _now_--that is, bad enough to take to  the Falls. Yuh don't want to expect--\"    \"Oh, I don't expect anything--only I want to see him ridden once. Come  on, no time like the present. If he's bad, you'll have to ride him at  the fair, anyhow, and a little practice won't hurt you; and if he  isn't, I want to know it for sure.\"    \"It's a go with me,\" Andy said indifferently, though he secretly felt  much relief. The roan would go off like a pet dog, and he could  pretend to be somewhat surprised, and declare that he had reformed.  Bad horses do reform, sometimes, as Andy and every other man in the  crowd knew. Then there would be no more foolish speculation about the  cayuse, and Andy could keep him in peace and have a mighty good  cow-pony, as he had schemed. He smoked a cigarette while Chip was  having the horses corralled, and then led the way willingly, with  twenty-five men following expectantly at his heels. Unlike Andy, they  fully expected an impromptu exhibition of fancy riding. Not all of  them had seen Andy atop a bad horse, and the Diamond G men, in  particular, were eager to witness a sample of his skill.    The blue roan submitted to the rope, and there was nothing spectacular  in the saddling. Andy kept his cigarette between his lips and smiled  to himself when he saw the saddle bunch hazed out through the gate and  the big corral left empty of every animal but the blue roan, as was  customary when a man tackled a horse with the record which he had  given the poor beast. Also, the sight of twenty-five men roosting  high, their boot-heels hooked under a corral rail to steady them,  their faces writ large with expectancy, amused him inwardly. He  pictured their disappointment when the roan trotted around the corral  once or twice at his bidding, and smiled again.    \"If you can't top him, Green, we'll send for Billy Roberts. _He'll_  take off the rough edge and gentle him down for yuh,\" taunted a  Diamond G man.    \"Don't get excited till the show starts,\" Andy advised, holding the  cigarette in his fingers while he emptied his lungs of smoke. Just to  make a pretence of caution, he shook the saddle tentatively by the  horn, and wished the roan would make a little show of resistance,  instead of standing there like an old cow, lacking only the cud, as he  complained to himself, to make the resemblance complete. The roan,  however, did lay back an ear when Andy, the cigarette again in his  lips, put his toe in the stirrup.    \"Go after it, you weatherbeaten old saw-buck,\" he yelled, just to make  the play strong, before he was fairly in the saddle.    Then it was that the Happy Family, heart and soul and pocket all for  Andy Green and his wonderful skill in the saddle; with many dollars  backing their belief in him and with voices ever ready to sing his  praises; with the golden light of early sunset all about them and the  tang of coming night-frost in the air, received a shock that made them  turn white under their tan.    \"Mama!\" breathed Weary, in a horrified half-whisper.    And Slim, goggle-eyed beside him, blurted, \"Well, by _golly_!\" in a  voice that carried across the corral.    For Andy Green, tamer of wild ones (forsooth!) broncho-twister with a  fame that not the boundary of Chouteau County held, nor yet the  counties beyond; Andy Green, erstwhile \"Andre de Greno, champion  bare-back rider of the Western Hemisphere,\" who had jumped through  blazing hoops and over sagging bunting while he rode, turned  handsprings and done other public-drawing feats, was prosaically,  unequivocally \"piled\" at the fifth jump!    That he landed lightly on"]]]
