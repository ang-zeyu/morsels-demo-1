So the matter stood when by chance the boy fell sick; whereby the  mother was sore distressed, for he was her only son, and she loved him as  much as might be, insomuch that all day long she was beside him, and  ceased not to comfort him, and again and again asked him if there were  aught that he wished for, imploring him to say the word, and, if it might  by any means be had, she would assuredly do her utmost to procure it for  him. Thus repeatedly exhorted, the boy said:--\"Mother mine, do but get me  Federigo's falcon, and I doubt not I shall soon be well.\" Whereupon the  lady was silent a while, bethinking her what she should do. She knew that  Federigo had long loved her, and had never had so much as a single kind  look from her: wherefore she said to herself:--How can I send or go to  beg of him this falcon, which by what I hear is the best that ever flew,  and moreover is his sole comfort? And how could I be so unfeeling as to  seek to deprive a gentleman of the one solace that is now left him? And  so, albeit she very well knew that she might have the falcon for the  asking, she was perplexed, and knew not what to say, and gave her son no  answer. At length, however, the love she bore the boy carried the day,  and she made up her mind, for his contentment, come what might, not to  send, but to go herself and fetch him the falcon. So:--\"Be of good cheer,  my son,\" she said, \"and doubt not thou wilt soon be well; for I promise  thee that the very first thing that I shall do tomorrow morning will be  to go and fetch thee the falcon.\" Whereat the child was so pleased that  he began to mend that very day.    On the morrow the lady, as if for pleasure, hied her with another lady to  Federigo's little house, and asked to see him. 'Twas still, as for some  days past, no weather for hawking, and Federigo was in his garden, busy  about some small matters which needed to be set right there. When he  heard that Monna Giovanna was at the door, asking to see him, he was not  a little surprised and pleased, and hied him to her with all speed. As  soon as she saw him, she came forward to meet him with womanly grace, and  having received his respectful salutation, said to him:--\"Good morrow,  Federigo,\" and continued:--\"I am come to requite thee for what thou hast  lost by loving me more than thou shouldst: which compensation is this,  that I and this lady that accompanies me will breakfast with thee without  ceremony this morning.\" \"Madam,\" Federigo replied with all humility, \"I  mind not ever to have lost aught by loving you, but rather to have been  so much profited that, if I ever deserved well in aught, 'twas to your  merit that I owed it, and to the love that I bore you. And of a surety  had I still as much to spend as I have spent in the past, I should not  prize it so much as this visit you so frankly pay me, come as you are to  one who can afford you but a sorry sort of hospitality.\" Which said, with  some confusion, he bade her welcome to his house, and then led her into  his garden, where, having none else to present to her by way of  companion, he said:--\"Madam, as there is none other here, this good  woman, wife of this husbandman, will bear you company, while I go to have  the table set.\" Now, albeit his poverty was extreme, yet he had not known  as yet how sore was the need to which his extravagance had reduced him;  but this morning 'twas brought home to him, for that he could find nought  wherewith to do honour to the lady, for love of whom he had done the  honours of his house to men without number: wherefore, distressed beyond  measure, and inwardly cursing his evil fortune, he sped hither and  thither like one beside himself, but never a coin found he, nor yet aught  to pledge. Meanwhile it grew late, and sorely he longed that the lady  might not leave his house altogether unhonoured, and yet to crave help of  his own husbandman was more than his pride could brook. In these  desperate straits his glance happened to fall on his brave falcon on his  perch in his little parlour. And so, as a last resource, he took him, and  finding him plump, deemed that he would make a dish meet for such a lady.  Wherefore, without thinking twice about it, he wrung the bird's neck, and  caused his maid forthwith pluck him and set him on a spit, and roast him  carefully; and having still some spotless table linen, he had the table  laid therewith, and with a cheerful countenance hied him back to his lady  in the garden, and told her that such breakfast as he could give her was  ready. So the lady and her companion rose and came to table, and there,  with Federigo, who waited on them most faithfully, ate the brave falcon,  knowing not what they ate.    When they were risen from table, and had dallied a while in gay converse  with him, the lady deemed it time to tell the reason of her visit:  wherefore, graciously addressing Federigo, thus began she:--\"Federigo, by  what thou rememberest of thy past life and my virtue, which, perchance,  thou hast deemed harshness and cruelty, I doubt not thou must marvel at  my presumption, when thou hearest the main purpose of my visit; but if  thou hadst sons, or hadst had them, so that thou mightest know the full  force of the love that is borne them, I should make no doubt that thou  wouldst hold me in part excused. Nor, having a son, may I, for that thou  hast none, claim exemption from the laws to which all other mothers are  subject, and, being thus bound to own their sway, I must, though fain  were I not, and though 'tis neither meet nor right, crave of thee that  which I know thou dost of all things and with justice prize most highly,  seeing that this extremity of thy adverse fortune has left thee nought  else wherewith to delight, divert and console thee; which gift is no  other than thy falcon, on which my boy has so set his heart that, if I  bring him it not, I fear lest he grow so much worse of the malady that he  has, that thereby it may come to pass that I lose him. And so, not for  the love which thou dost bear me, and which may nowise bind thee, but for  that nobleness of temper, whereof in courtesy more conspicuously than in  aught else thou hast given proof, I implore thee that thou be pleased to  give me the bird, that thereby I may say that I have kept my son alive,  and thus made him for aye thy debtor.\"    No sooner had Federigo apprehended what the lady wanted, than, for grief  that 'twas not in his power to serve her, because he had given her the  falcon to eat, he fell a weeping in her presence, before he could so much  as utter a word. At first the lady supposed that 'twas only because he  was loath to part with the brave falcon that he wept, and as good as made  up her mind that he would refuse her: however, she awaited with patience  Federigo's answer, which was on this wise:--\"Madam, since it pleased God  that I should set my affections upon you there have been matters not a  few, in which to my sorrow I have deemed Fortune adverse to me; but they  have all been trifles in comparison of the trick that she now plays me:  the which I shall never forgive her, seeing that you are come here to my  poor house, where, while I was rich, you deigned not to come, and ask a  trifling favour of me, which she has put it out of my power to grant: how  'tis so, I will briefly tell you. When I learned that you, of your grace,  were minded to breakfast with me, having respect to your high dignity and  desert, I deemed it due and seemly that in your honour I should regale  you, to the best of my power, with fare of a more excellent quality than  is commonly set before others; and, calling to mind the falcon which you  now ask of me, and his excellence, I judged him meet food for you, and so  you have had him roasted on the trencher this morning; and well indeed I  thought I had bestowed him; but, as now I see that you would fain have  had him in another guise, so mortified am I that I am not able to serve  you, that I doubt I shall never know peace of mind more.\" In witness  whereof he had the feathers and feet and beak of the bird brought in and  laid before her.    The first thing the lady did, when she had heard Federigo's story, and  seen the relics of the bird, was to chide him that he had killed so fine  a falcon to furnish a woman with a breakfast; after which the magnanimity  of her host, which poverty had been and was powerless to impair, elicited  no small share of inward commendation. Then, frustrate of her hope of  possessing the falcon, and doubting of her son's recovery, she took her  leave with the heaviest of hearts, and hied her back to the boy: who,  whether for fretting, that he might not have the falcon, or by the  unaided energy of his disorder, departed this life not many days after,  to the exceeding great grief of his mother. For a while she would do  nought but weep and bitterly bewail herself; but being still young, and  left very wealthy, she was often urged by her brothers to marry again,  and though she would rather have not done so, yet being importuned, and  remembering Federigo's high desert, and the magnificent generosity with  which he had finally killed his falcon to do her honour, she said to her  brothers:--\"Gladly, with your consent, would I remain a widow, but if you  will not be satisfied except I take a husband, rest assured that none  other will I ever take save Federigo degli Alberighi.\" Whereupon her  brothers derided her, saying:--\"Foolish woman, what is't thou sayst? How  shouldst thou want Federigo, who has not a thing in the world?\" To whom  she answered:--\"My brothers, well wot I that 'tis as you say; but I had  rather have a man without wealth than wealth without a man.\" The  brothers, perceiving that her mind was made up, and knowing Federigo for  a good man and true, poor though he was, gave her to him with all her  wealth. And so Federigo, being mated with such a wife, and one that he  had so much loved, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13111"],[0,"The Brain and the Voice in Speech and Song (#15)"],[1," Kingsley, Miss, 6  Klang, 13  Koenig, flame manometer, 48, fig. 14    L    Language, a human attribute, 61    Of Gesture, 6, 7, 71    Written, 8  Laryngoscope, 34, 35, 37, fig. 9  Larynx, 28 _seq_., figs. 4-8    M    Macaulay, Lord, 79  Mach, \"Analysis of Sensations,\" 79, 90  Marie, M., 73, 76  Marseillaise, 106  Memory, visual, 79, 80  Mouth, 43, 44  Mueller, Max, \"Chips from a German Workshop,\" 8    N    Nerves of Respiration, 21  Neurologists, 73    O    Overtones, 14, 47 _seq_.
