Then she faced  Daniels once more and cupped her hands about her mouth. \"Stranger,\" she  said in a stage whisper, \"Mac Strann is in town!\"    The eyes of Buck Daniels wandered.    \"Don't you know him?\" she asked.    \"Nope.\"    \"Never heard of him?\"    \"Nope.\"    \"Well,\" sighed the waitress, \"you've had some luck in your life. Take a  cross between a bulldog and a mustang and a mountain-lion--that's Mac  Strann. He's in town, and he's here for killin'.\"    \"You don't say, ma'am. And why don't they lock him up?\"    \"Because he ain't done nothin' yet to be locked up about. That's the way  with him. And when he does a thing he always makes the man he's after  pull his gun first. Smart? I'll say he's just like an Indian, that Mac  Strann!\"    \"But who's he after?\"    \"The feller that plugged his brother, Jerry.\"    \"Kind of looks like he had reason for a killing, then.\"    \"Nope. Jerry had it comin' to him. He was always raising trouble, Jerry  was. And this time, he pulled his gun first. Everybody seen him.\"    \"He run into a gunman?\"    \"Gunman?\" she laughed heartily. \"Partner, if it wasn't for something  funny about his eyes, I wouldn't be no more afraid of that gunman than I  am of a tabby-cat. And me a weak woman. The quietest lookin' sort that  ever come to Brownsville. But there's something queer about him. He  knows that Mac Strann is here in town. He knows that Mac Strann is  waiting for Jerry to die. He knows that when Jerry dies Mac will be out  for a killin'. And this here stranger is just sittin' around and waitin'  to be killed! Can you beat that?\"    But Buck Daniels had grown strangely excited.    \"What did you say there was about his eyes?\" he asked sharply.    She grew suddenly suspicious.    \"D' you know him?\"    \"No. But you was talkin' about his eyes?\"    \"I dunno what it is. I ain't the only one that's seen it. There ain't no  word you can put to it. It's just there. That's all.\"    The voice of Buck Daniels fell to a whisper.    \"It's sort of fire,\" he suggested. \"Ain't it a kind of light _behind_  his eyes?\"    But the waitress stared at him in amazement.    \"Fire?\" she gasped. \"A light _behind_ his eyes? M'frien', are you tryin'  to string me?\"    \"What's his name?\"    \"I dunno.\"    \"Ma'am,\" said Daniels, rising hastily. \"Here's a dollar if you'll take  me to him.\"    \"You don't need no guide,\" she replied. \"Listen to that, will you?\"    And as he hearkened obediently Buck Daniels heard a strain of whistling,  needle-sharp with distance.    \"That's him,\" nodded the woman. \"He's always goin' about whistling to  himself. Kind of a nut, he is.\"    \"It's him!\" cried Buck Daniels. \"It's him!\"    And with this ungrammatical burst of joy he bolted from the room.          CHAPTER XIII    THE THREE      The whistling came from behind the hotel, and although it ended as soon  as he reached the veranda of the building, Buck Daniels hurried to the  rear of the place. There were the long, low sheds of the barn, and  behind these, he knew, must be the corrals. He raced around the corner  of the shed and there came to a halt, for he saw a thing that turned his  blood to ice.    One of those rare rains of the mountain-desert had recently fallen and  the corrals behind the barn were carpeted with a short, thick grass. In  the small corral nearest him he beheld, rolling on that carpet of grass,  a great wolf--or a dog as large and as rough-coated as a wolf, and a  man; and they were engaged in a desperate and silent struggle for  mastery. Their movements were so lightning fast that Buck Daniels could  not make out distinct forms from the tangle. But he saw the great white  teeth of the wolf flash in the sun one instant, and the next the man had  whirled on top. It was Dan and Bart at play.    No outcry from Dan; no growl from the wolf. Buck felt the old chill  which never left him when he saw the fierce game of the wolf and the  wolf-man. All this passed in the twinkling of an eye, and then Dan, by a  prodigious effort, had thrown the great beast away from him, so that  Bart fell upon its back. Dan leaped with outstretched arms upon the  fallen animal, and buried his clutching hands in the throat of the  beast.    Yet still there was a thrill to add to these, for now a black horse  appeared in the picture, a miracle of slender, shimmering grace--and he  rushed with flattened ears upon the two twisting, writhing, prostrate  figures. His teeth were bared--he was more like a prodigious dog than a  horse. And those teeth closed on the back of the man's neck--or did they  merely pinch his shirt?--and then Dan was dragged bodily away from the  wolf and thrown through the air by a flirt of the stallion's head.    Horrible! Buck Daniels shuddered and then he grinned shamefacedly in  apology to himself.    \"The three of 'em!\" he grunted, and stepped closer to the fence to  watch.    The instant the man was torn away by the intercession of the horse, the  wolf regained its feet and rushed upon him; but Dan had landed from his  fall upon his feet, with catlike agility, and now he dodged the rush of  the wolf and the arrowy spring of the creature, and sprang in his turn  towards the stallion.    The black met this attack by rearing, his ears flattened, his teeth  bared, his eyes terrible to behold. As the man raced close the stallion  struck with lightning hoofs, but the blow failed of its mark--by the  breadth of a hair. And the assailant, swerving like a will-o'-the-wisp,  darted to the side of the animal and leaped upon its back. At the same  instant the wolf left the ground with terribly gaping mouth in a spring  for the rider; but Dan flattened himself along the shining back of his  mount and the wolf catapulted harmlessly past.    After this failure the wolf-dog seemed to desire no further active part  in the struggle, but took up a position to one side, and there, with  lolling tongue and red-stained eyes, watched the battle continue. The  stallion, to be sure, kept up the conflict with a whole-hearted energy.  Never had Buck Daniels in a long and varied career seen such wild  pitching. The black leaped here and there, doubling about with the  sinuous speed of a snake, springing high in the air one instant, and  landing the next on stiff legs; dropping to the ground the next second,  and rolling to crush the rider; up again like a leaf jerked up by a gale  of wind, and so the fierce struggle continued, with the wild rider  slapping the neck of the horse as if he would encourage it to more  terrible efforts, and drumming its round barrel with vindictive heels.  His hair blew black; his face flushed; and in his eyes there was the joy  of the sailor, long land-bound, who climbs at last the tallest mast and  feels it pitch beneath him and catches the sharp tang of the travelled  wind.    The struggle ceased as if in obedience to an inaudible command. From the  full frenzy of motion horse and man were suddenly moveless. Then Dan  slipped from his seat and stood before his mount. At once the ears of  the stallion, which had been flat back, pricked sharply forward; the  eyes of the animal grew luminous and soft as the eyes of a woman, and he  dropped the black velvet of his muzzle beneath the master's chin. As for  Dan Barry, he rewarded this outburst of affection with no touch of his  hand; but his lips moved, and he seemed to be whispering a secret to his  horse. The wolf in the meantime had viewed this scene with growing  unrest, and now it trotted up and placed itself at the side of the man.  Receiving no attention in this position, it caught the arm of the man  between its great fangs and drew his hands down. The stallion, angered  by this interruption, raised a delicate forefoot to strike, and was  received with a terrific snarl--the first sound of the entire scene.    \"Bart,\" said the man, and his voice was not raised or harsh, but came as  softly as running water, \"if you ain't going to be a gentleman, I got  to teach you manners. Get up on Satan's back and lie down till I tell  you to get off.\"    The wolf received this command with a snarl even more blood-curdling  than before, but he obeyed, slinking sidewise a reluctant pace or two,  and then springing to the back of the stallion with a single bound.  There he crouched, still snarling softly until his master raised a  significant forefinger. At that he lowered his head and maintained a  fiercely observant silence.    \"Dan!\" called Buck Daniels.    The other whirled.    \"Speakin' of pets,\" observed Buck Daniels, \"I heard tell once about a  gent that had a tame lion. Which you got the outbeatingest pair I ever  see, Dan. Gentle, ain't they, like a stampede of cows!\"    But Barry left this remark unanswered. He ran to the tall fence, placed  his hand on the top rail, and vaulted lightly over it. Then he clasped  the hand of the larger man, and his face lighted.    \"Buck,\" he said, \"I been sort of lonesome. It feels pretty good to see  you agin.\"    \"Oh man,\" answered Buck Daniels, \"speakin' of bein' lonesome------\" He  checked himself. \"How about steppin' inside and havin' a talk?\"    The other started forward agreeably, but stopped almost at once.    \"Heel!\" he called, without turning his head.    Black Bart left the back of the stallion in a long bound that carried  him half way to the fence. His next leap brought him over the rail and  beside his master. Buck Daniels moved back a step involuntarily.    \"Bart,\" he said, \"d'you know me?\"    He stretched out his hand; and was received with a sudden baring of the  fangs.    \"Nice dog!\" said Buck sarcastically. \"Regular house-pet, ain't he?\"    The other apparently missed the entire point of this remark. He said in  his gentle, serious way: \"He used to be real wild, Buck. But now he  don't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12443"],[0,"The Jute Industry: From Seed to Finished Cloth (#15)"],[1," wound either on to the top roller, or the second top one, Fig. 44,  and while there is subjected to the degree of pressure required; the  amount of pressure can be regulated by the number of weights and the  way in which the tension belt is attached to its pulley. The two  sets of weights are seen clearly on the left in Fig. 44, and these  act on the long horizontal levers, usually to add pressure to the  dead weight of the top roller, but occasionally, for very light  finishes, to decrease the effective weight of the top bowl. After  the cloth has been chested on one or other of the two top bowls, it  is stripped from the bowl on to a light roller shown clearly with  its belt pulley in Fig. 41.    There are two belt pulleys shown on the machine in Fig. 44; one is  driven by an open belt, and the other by a crossed belt. Provision  is thus made for driving the calender in both directions. The  pulleys are driven by two friction clutches, both of which are  inoperative when the set-on handle is vertical as in the figure.  Either pulley may be rotated, however, by moving the handle to a  oblique position.    The compound leverage imparted to the bearings of the top bowl, and  the weights of the bowls themselves, result in the necessary pressure,  and this pressure may be varied according to the number of small  weights used. The heaviest finish on the calender, i.e. the  chest-finish on the second top roller, imitates more or less the  \"mangle finish.\"    [Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co., Ltd_.  FIG. 45 HYDRAULIC MANGLE]    A heavy hydraulic mangle with its accumulator and made by Messrs.  Urquhart, Lindsay & Co., Ltd., Dundee, is illustrated in Fig. 45.  The cloth is wound or beamed by the mechanism in the front on to  what is termed a \"mangle pin\"; it is reality a thick iron bowl; when  the piece is beamed, it is automatically moved between two huge  rollers, and hydraulic pressure applied. Four narrow pieces are  shown in Fig. 45 on the pin, and between the two rollers. There are  other four narrow pieces, already beamed on another pin, in the  beaming position, and there is still another pin at the delivery  side with a similar number of cloths ready for being stripped. The  three pins are arranged thus o deg.o, and since all three are  moved simultaneously, when the mangling operation is finished, each  roller or pin is moved through 120 deg.. Thus, the stripped pin will be  placed in the beaming position, the beamed pin carried into the  mangling position, and the pin with the mangled cloth taken to the  stripping position.    While the operation of mangling is proceeding, the rollers move  first in one direction and then in the other direction, and this  change of direction is accomplished automatically by mechanism  situated between the accumulator and the helical-toothed gearing  seen at the far end of the mangle. And while this mangling is taking  place, the operatives are beaming a fresh set, while the previously  mangles pieces are being stripped by the plaiting-down apparatus  which deposits the cloth in folds. This operation is also known as  \"cuttling\" or \"faking.\" It will be, understood that a wide mangle,  such as that illustrated in Fig. 45. is constructed specially for  treating wide fabrics, and narrow fabrics are mangled on it simply  because circumstances and change of trade from time to time demand it.    [Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co.  Ltd_. Fig 46 FOLDING, LAPPING OR PLEATING MACHINE]    The high structure on the left is the accumulator, the manipulation  of this and the number of wide weights which are ingeniously brought  into action to act on the plunger determine the pressure which is  applied to the fabrics between the bowls or rollers.    Cloths both from the calender and the mangle now pass through a  measuring machine, the clock of which records the length passed  through. There are usually two hands and two circles of numbers on  the clock face; one hand registers the units up to 10 on one circle  of numbers, while the slower-moving hand registers 10, 20, 30, up to  100. The measuring roller in these machines is usually one yard in  circumference.    If the cloth in process of being finished is for use as the backing  or foundation of linoleum, it is invariably wound on to a wooden  centre as it emerges from the bowls of the calender, measured as well,  and the winding-on mechanism is of a friction drive somewhat similar  to that mentioned in connection with the dressing machine. Cloths  for this purpose are often made up to 600 yards in length; indeed,  special looms, with winding appliances, have been constructed to  weave cloths up to 2,000 yards in length. Special dressing machines  and loom beams have to be made for the latter kind. When the  linoleum backing is finished at the calender, both cloth and centre  are forwarded direct to the linoleum works. The empty centres are  returned periodically.    Narrow-width cloths are often made up into a roll by means of a  simple machine termed a calenderoy, while somewhat similar cloth,  and several types of cloths of much wider width, are lapped or  folded by special machines such as that illustrated in Fig. 46. The  cloth passes over the oblique board, being guided by the discs shown,  to the upper part of the carrier where it passes between the two bars.  As the carrier is oscillated from side to side (it is the right hand  side in the illustration) the cloth is piled neatly in folds on the  convex table. The carriers may be adjusted to move through different  distances, so that any width or length of fold, between limits, may  be made.    Comparatively wide pieces can be folded on the above machine, but  some merchants prefer to have wide pieces doubled lengthwise, and  this is done by machines of different kinds. In all cases, however,  the operation is termed \"crisping\" in regard to jute fabrics. Thus,  Fig. 47, illustrates one type of machine used for this purpose, and  made by Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Ca., Ltd., Dundee. The  full-width cloth on the right has obviously two prominent  stripes--one near each side. The full width cloth passes upwards  obliquely a triangular board, and when the cloth reaches the apex it  is doubled and passed between two bars also set obliquely on the left.  The doubled piece now passes between a pair of positively driven  drawing rollers, and is then \"faked,\" \"cuttled,\" or pleated as  indicated. The machine thus automatically, doubles the piece, and  delivers it as exemplified in folds of half width. In other  industries, this operation is termed creasing and, rigging.  Some of  the later types of crisping or creasing machines double the cloth  lengthwise as illustrated in Fig. 47, and, in addition, roll it at  the same time instead of delivering it in loose folds.    [Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Urquhart Lindsay & Co. Ltd_.  FIG. 47 CRISPING, CREASING OR RIGGING MACHINE]    If the cloth is intended to be cut up into lengths, say for the  making of bags of various kinds, and millions of such bags are made  annually, it is cut up into the desired lengths, either by hand,  semi-mechanically, or wholly mechanically, and then the lengths are  sewn at desired places by sewing machines, and in various ways  according to requirements.    [Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co. Ltd_  FIG 48 SEMI-MECHANICAL BAG OR SACK CUTTING MACHINE]    Fig. 48 illustrates one of the semi-mechanical machines for this  purpose; this particular type being made by Messrs. Urquhart,  Lindsay & Co., Ltd., Dundee. About eight or nine different cloths  are arranged in frames behind the cutting machine, and the ends of  these cloths passed between the horizontal bars at the back of the  machine. They are then led between the rollers, under the cutting  knife, and on to the table. The length of cloth is measured as it  passes between the rollers, and different change pinions are  supplied so that practically any length may be cut. Eight or nine  lengths are thus passed under the knife frame simultaneously, and  when the required length has been delivered, the operative inserts  the knife in the slot of the knife frame, and pushes it forward by  means of the long handle shown distinctly above the frame and table.  He thus cuts eight or nine at a time, after which a further length  is drawn forward, and the cycle repeated. Means are provided for  registering the number passed through; from 36,000 yards to 40,000  yards can be treated per day.    The bags may be made of different materials, e.g. the first four in  Fig. 32. When hessian cloth, II, Fig. 32, is used, the sewing is  usually done by quick-running small machines, such as the Yankee or  Union; each of these machines is capable of sewing more than 2,000  bags per day. For the heavier types of cloth, such as sacking,  _S_, Fig. 32, the sewing is almost invariably done by the Laing or  overhead sewing machine, the general type of which is illustrated in  Fig. 49, and made by Mr. D. J. Macdonald, South St. Roque's Works,  Dundee. This is an absolutely fast stitch, and approximately 1,000  bags can be sewn in one day.    [Illustration: FIG. 49 OVERHEAD (LAING) SACK SEWING MACHINE _By  permission of Mr. D. J. Macdonald_]    The distinctive marks in bags for identification often take the form  of coloured stripes woven in the cloth, and as illustrated at  _S_, Fig. 32. It is obvious that a considerable variety can be  made by altering the number of the stripes, their position, and  their width, while if different coloured threads appear in the same  cloth, the variety is still further increased.    Many firms, however, prefer to have their names, trade marks, and  other distinctive features printed on the bags; in these cases, the  necessary particulars are printed on the otherwise completed bag by  a sack-printing machine of the flat-bed or circular roller type."]]]
