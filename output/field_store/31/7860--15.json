The Assyrian commanders in  Griffith's Judith would, without great embarrassment, stand this test.    But it may not be the pursuit of an enemy we have in mind. It may be a  spring celebration, horsemen in Arcadia, going to some happy tournament.  Where will we find our precedents for such a cavalcade? Go to any museum.  Find the Parthenon room. High on the wall is the copy of the famous  marble frieze of the young citizens who are in the procession in praise  of Athena. Such a rhythm of bodies and heads and the feet of proud  steeds, and above all the profiles of thoroughbred youths, no city has  seen since that day. The delicate composition relations, ever varying,  ever refreshing, amid the seeming sameness of formula of rider behind  rider, have been the delight of art students the world over, and shall so  remain. No serious observer escapes the exhilaration of this company. Let  it be studied by the author-producer though it be but an idyl in disguise  that his scenario calls for: merry young farmers hurrying to the State  Fair parade, boys making all speed to the political rally.    Buy any three moving picture magazines you please. Mark the illustrations  that are massive, in high relief, with long lines in their edges. Cut out  and sort some of these. I have done it on the table where I write. After  throwing away all but the best specimens, I have four different kinds of  sculpture. First, behold the inevitable cowboy. He is on a ramping  horse, filling the entire outlook. The steed rears, while facing us. The  cowboy waves his hat. There is quite such an animal by Frederick  MacMonnies, wrought in bronze, set up on a gate to a park in Brooklyn. It  is not the identical color of the photoplay animal, but the bronze  elasticity is the joy in both.    Here is a scene of a masked monk, carrying off a fainting girl. The hero  intercepts him. The figures of the lady and the monk are in sufficient  sculptural harmony to make a formal sculptural group for an art  exhibition. The picture of the hero, strong, with well-massed surfaces,  is related to both. The fact that he is in evening dress does not alter  his monumental quality. All three are on a stone balcony that relates  itself to the general largeness of spirit in the group, and the  semi-classic dress of the maiden. No doubt the title is: The Morning  Following the Masquerade Ball. This group could be made in unglazed clay,  in four colors.    Here is an American lieutenant with two ladies. The three are suddenly  alert over the approach of the villain, who is not yet in the picture.  In costume it is an everyday group, but those three figures are related  to one another, and the trees behind them, in simple sculptural terms.  The lieutenant, as is to be expected, looks forth in fierce readiness.  One girl stands with clasped hands. The other points to the danger. The  relations of these people to one another may seem merely dramatic to the  superficial observer, but the power of the group is in the fact that it  is monumental. I could imagine it done in four different kinds of rare  tropical wood, carved unpolished.    Here is a scene of storm and stress in an office where the hero is caught  with seemingly incriminating papers. The table is in confusion. The room  is filling with people, led by one accusing woman. Is this also  sculpture? Yes. The figures are in high relief. Even the surfaces of the  chairs and the littered table are massive, and the eye travels without  weariness, as it should do in sculpture, from the hero to the furious  woman, then to the attorney behind her, then to the two other revilers,  then to the crowd in three loose rhythmic ranks. The eye makes this  journey, not from space to space, or fabric to fabric, but first of all  from mass to mass. It is sculpture, but it is the sort that can be done  in no medium but the moving picture itself, and therefore it is one goal  of this argument.    But there are several other goals. One of the sculpturesque resources of  the photoplay is that the human countenance can be magnified many times,  till it fills the entire screen. Some examples are in rather low relief,  portraits approximating certain painters. But if they are on sculptural  terms, and are studies of the faces of thinking men, let the producer  make a pilgrimage to Washington for his precedent. There, in the rotunda  of the capitol, is the face of Lincoln by Gutzon Borglum. It is one of  the eminently successful attempts to get at the secret of the countenance  by enlarging it much, and concentrating the whole consideration there.    The photoplay producer, seemingly without taking thought, is apt to show  a sculptural sense in giving us Newfoundland fishermen, clad in oilskins.  The background may have an unconscious Winslow Homer reminiscence. In the  foreground our hardy heroes fill the screen, and dripping with sea-water  become wave-beaten granite, yet living creatures none the less. Imagine  some one chapter from the story of Little Em'ly in David Copperfield,  retold in the films. Show us Ham Peggotty and old Mr. Peggotty in  colloquy over their nets. There are many powerful bronze groups to be had  from these two, on to the heroic and unselfish death of Ham, rescuing his  enemy in storm and lightning.    I have seen one rich picture of alleged cannibal tribes. It was a comedy  about a missionary. But the aborigines were like living ebony and silver.  That was long ago. Such things come too much by accident. The producer is  not sufficiently aware that any artistic element in his list of  productions that is allowed to go wild, that has not had full analysis,  reanalysis, and final conservation, wastes his chance to attain supreme  mastery.    Open your history of sculpture, and dwell upon those illustrations which  are not the normal, reposeful statues, but the exceptional, such as have  been listed for this chapter. Imagine that each dancing, galloping, or  fighting figure comes down into the room life-size. Watch it against a  dark curtain. Let it go through a series of gestures in harmony with the  spirit of the original conception, and as rapidly as possible, not to  lose nobility. If you have the necessary elasticity, imagine the figures  wearing the costumes of another period, yet retaining in their motions  the same essential spirit. Combine them in your mind with one or two  kindred figures, enlarged till they fill the end of the room. You have  now created the beginning of an Action Photoplay in your own fancy.    Do this with each most energetic classic till your imagination flags. I  do not want to be too dogmatic, but it seems to me this is one way to  evolve real Action Plays. It would, perhaps, be well to substitute this  for the usual method of evolving them from old stage material or  newspaper clippings.    There is in the Metropolitan Museum a noble modern group, the Mares of  Diomedes, by the aforementioned Gutzon Borglum. It is full of material  for the meditations of a man who wants to make a film of a stampede. The  idea is that Hercules, riding his steed bareback, guides it in a circle.  He is fascinating the horses he has been told to capture. They are held  by the mesmerism of the circular path and follow him round and round till  they finally fall from exhaustion. Thus the Indians of the West capture  wild ponies, and Borglum, a far western man, imputes the method to  Hercules. The bronze group shows a segment of this circle. The whirlwind  is at its height. The mares are wild to taste the flesh of Hercules.  Whoever is to photograph horses, let him study the play of light and  color and muscle-texture in this bronze. And let no group of horses ever  run faster than these of Borglum.    An occasional hint of a Michelangelo figure or gesture appears for a  flash in the films. Young artist in the audience, does it pass you by?  Open your history of sculpture again and look at the usual list of  Michelangelo groups. Suppose the seated majesty of Moses should rise,  what would be the quality of the action? Suppose the sleeping figures of  the Medician tombs should wake, or those famous slaves should break their  bands, or David again hurl the stone. Would not their action be as heroic  as their quietness? Is it not possible to have a Michelangelo of  photoplay sculpture? Should we not look for him in the fulness of time?  His figures might come to us in the skins of the desert island solitary,  or as cave men and women, or as mermaids and mermen, and yet have a force  and grandeur akin to that of the old Italian.    Rodin's famous group of the citizens of Calais is an example of the  expression of one particular idea by a special technical treatment. The  producer who tells a kindred story to that of the siege of Calais, and  the final going of these humble men to their doom, will have a hero-tale  indeed. It will be not only sculpture-in-action, but a great Crowd  Picture. It begins to be seen that the possibilities of monumental  achievement in the films transcend the narrow boundaries of the Action  Photoplay. Why not conceptions as heroic as Rodin's Hand of God, where  the first pair are clasped in the gigantic fingers of their maker in the  clay from which they came?    Finally, I desire in moving pictures, not the stillness, but the majesty  of sculpture. I do not advocate for the photoplay the mood of the Venus  of Milo. But let us turn to that sister of hers, the great Victory of  Samothrace, that spreads her wings at the head of the steps of the  Louvre, and in many an art gallery beside. When you are appraising a new  film, ask yourself: \"Is this motion as rapid, as godlike, as the sweep of  the wings of the Samothracian?\" Let her be the touchstone of the Action  Drama, for nothing can be more swift than the winged Gods, nothing can be  more powerful than the oncoming of the immortals.

No sooner had he opened his mouth  than mother fell over and was dead!    CARL.    Good! If you hear tomorrow that the fellow has been found dead, then do  not curse the murderer!    CLARA.    Surely you are not going to--    CARL.    Am I his only enemy? Has he not been often attacked already? Among so  many it might be difficult to find the right man to attribute the deed  to, unless he left his cane or hat on the spot! [_He drinks._] Whoever  it is: Good success to him!    CLARA.    Brother, you talk--    CARL.    Don't you like it? Never mind! You will not see me very much longer!    CLARA (_shudders with terror_).    No!    CARL.    No? So you know already that I am going to sea? Do my thoughts crawl  around on my forehead, that you can read them so easily? Or did the old  man fly into a passion in his old way and threaten to shut me out of the  house? Bah! That would be very much the same thing as if the jailer had  sworn to me: You shall not stay in prison any longer--I am going to  shove you out into the open again!    CLARA.    You do not understand me!    CARL (_sings_).      A ship lies in the offing,    A-sporting with the winds.    Yes indeed, there is nothing to bind me to the bench here any longer!  Mother is dead, there is no longer any one to stop eating fish after  every storm, and that has been my wish from boyhood. Away! I shall not  prosper here--at least not until I know for sure that luck no longer  favors the brave fellow who stakes his life on the game, who throws back  onto the table the copper coin that he has received from the great  treasure, in order to see whether luck will pocket it or return it to  him gilded!    CLARA.    And are you going away to leave your father all alone? He is sixty years  old!    CARL.    Alone? Aren't you going to be left?    CLARA.    I?    CARL.    You! His pet child! What sort of weeds are growing in your head  that you ask me that? By going, I leave his joy with him and free him of  his everlasting annoyance! Why shouldn't I do it? Once and for all we  cannot get along together. He can't get things contracted enough to suit  him. He would like to close his fist and creep inside it. I would like  to strip off my skin like a baby's coat--if it were only practicable!    [_Sings_]      The anchor they are heaving,    I trow they'll soon be leaving,    Now look! Away she spins.    Tell me yourself: Did he doubt my guilt for a single instant? And did he  not find the usual consolation in his over-wise: \"Just as I expected!\"  \"I have always thought so!\" \"It could not end in any other way!\" If it  had been you, he would have killed himself! I should like to see him if  you were to suffer a woman's fate! It would be to him as if he himself  had become pregnant--and by the devil besides!    CLARA.    Oh, what anguish! Yes, I must go! Away!    CARL.    What do you mean by that?    CLARA.    I must go into the kitchen! What else should I mean?    [_Clasping her forehead._]    Yes! That too! Just to hear that I came home again!    [_Exit._]    CARL.    She acts very strangely!    [_Sings_]      A bold and saucy sea-gull    Sweeps round, as if possessed--    CLARA. [_Reenters._]    The last thing is done! Father's supper is on the fire! As I closed the  kitchen door behind me, I thought to myself: You are never to enter  there again! I shuddered in my very soul! Thus I shall go out of the  room too, thus out of the house, thus out of the world!    CARL. [_Sings; he continues to walk back and forth; CLARA remains in the  background._]      Aloft the sun is burning,    The fishes, glancing, turning,    Circle about their guest.    CLARA.    Why do I not do it then? Shall I never do it? Am I going to continue  putting it off from day to day, as I am now doing from one minute to the  next, until--certainly! Then, away! Away! And yet I stand still! I have  a feeling as if imploring hands were raised in my womb, as if  eyes--[_She sits down on a chair._] What does it mean? Am I too weak to  do it? Then ask yourself if you are strong enough to see your father  with his throat cut!--[_She rises._] No! No!--Our Father, Who art in  Heaven, hallowed be Thy name--God! God! My poor head! I cannot even  pray! Brother! Brother! Help me!    CARL.    What's the matter with you    CLARA.    The Lord's Prayer!    [_She bethinks herself._]    It seemed to me as if I were already lying in the water and sinking, and  had not yet prayed! I [_suddenly_]--Forgive us our trespasses, as we  forgive those that trespass against us! That is it! Yes! Yes! Certainly  I forgive him! I shall think no more of him!--Good night, Carl!    CARL.    Are you going to bed so soon? Good night!    CLARA. [_Like a child, repeating the Lord's Prayer._]    Forgive us--    CARL.    You might bring me a glass of water first--but it must be absolutely  fresh!    CLARA (_quickly_).    I will bring it to you from the well!    CARL.    All right! If you want to. It is not far, you know.    CLARA.    Thank you! Thank you! That was the last thing that still troubled me!  The deed itself would have betrayed me! Now people will say: She had an  accident! She fell in!    CARL.    Be careful of yourself! The board has probably not been nailed down  yet!    CLARA.    It is bright moonlight!--Oh, God, I am coming only because otherwise my  father would come! Forgive me, as I--have mercy on me--mercy--[_Exit._]      SCENE IX    CARL (_sings_).      I fain would be aboard her,    My kingdom's on the sea.    Yes, but first [_He looks at the clock._]--What time is it?--Nine  o'clock.      A lad that's young and growing    Must e'en be up and going,    No matter where, says he.        SCENE X    _Enter, Master ANTONY._    ANTONY.    I should have an apology to make to you, but if I forgive you for  contracting secret debts and pay them off for you into the bargain, you  will probably allow me to omit the apology?    CARL.    The one is good, the other is not necessary. As soon as I sell my  Sunday clothes I shall myself be able to satisfy the people who have a  claim of a few thalers against me. And that I shall do tomorrow, for as  a sailor [_To himself_]--There, it is out! [_Aloud_]--I shall no longer  need them!    ANTONY.    What kind of talk is that again?    CARL.    This is not the first time you have heard it, but today you may answer  me as you will! My mind is made up!    ANTONY.    You are of age, that is true!    CARL.    And just because I am of age I am not defiant about it! For in my  opinion birds and fishes should not quarrel over the question whether it  is better in the water or in the air. Just one thing--either you will  never see me again, or else you will clap me on the shoulder and say:  Well done!    ANTONY.    We'll wait and see! I shall not have to pay off the fellow that I have  taken on in your place. That's all.    CARL.    I thank you.    ANTONY.    Tell me: Did the bailiff, instead of taking you by the shortest way to  the burgomaster, really lead you around through the whole town and--    CARL.    Up the street, down the street, across the marketplace like a carnival  ox! But do not doubt it--I shall settle up with him too before I go!  ANTONY.    I do not blame you for that, but I forbid you to do it! CARL.    Ho!    ANTONY.    I'll not let you out of my sight! I myself would run to the man's aid,  if you tried to attack him!    CARL.    I thought that you loved my mother too!    ANTONY.    I shall prove it!        SCENE XI    SECRETARY (_staggers in; he is pale, and is holding a handkerchief  against his breast_). Where is Clara? [_He falls into a chair_.]  God!--Good evening! Thank Heaven that I had time to get here!--Where is  she?    CARL.    She went to--Where is she? Her talk--I am afraid--[_Exit_.]    [Illustration: DEATH AS FRIEND _From a Drawing by Alfred Rethel_]    SECRETARY.    She is avenged! The scoundrel is done for! But I too am--Oh, why did it  have to be?--God! Now I cannot--    ANTONY.    What's the matter with you? What ails you?    SECRETARY.    It is nearly up with me! Give me your hand on it, that you will not cast  off your daughter--do you hear?--will not cast her off, if she--    ANTONY.    That is strange talk! Why should I, pray--Ha! My eyes are opening!--Was  I right after all in suspecting?--    SECRETARY.    Give me your hand!    ANTONY.    No!    [_He puts both hands into his pockets._]    But I will clear the way for her--she knows that! I have told her so.    SECRETARY (_horrified_).    You told her!--unhappy girl! Now for the first time I quite understand--    CARL (_rushes in_).    Father! Father! There is somebody lying in the well! If only it is not--    ANTONY.    The long ladder! Hooks! Ropes! Why do you delay? Quick! Even were it the  bailiff!    CARL.    Everything is already there! The neighbors arrived before me! If only it  is not Clara!--    ANTONY.    Clara?    [_He grasps the table._]    CARL.    She went to draw water, and they found her handkerchief!    SECRETARY.    Scoundrel, I know now why your bullet hit the mark! It is she!    ANTONY.    Go and find out!    [_He, sits down._]    I cannot!    [_Exit CARL._]    And yet--    [_Rises again._]    If [_to the SECRETARY_] I understood you correctly, everything is all  right!    CARL (_reenters_).    Clara! Dead! Her head terribly crushed on the edge of the well, as  she--Father, she did not fall in, she jumped in! A maid saw her!    ANTONY.    Let her think before she speaks! It is not light enough for her to have  distinguished things with certainty! SECRETARY. Do you doubt it? You  would like to, but you cannot! Think only of what you said to her! You  pointed out to her the road to death! I, I alone am to blame that she  did not turn back! When you suspected her misery, you thought only of  the tongues that would hiss at you, but not of the worthlessness of the  snakes to which they belonged! Then you uttered a word that drove her to  despair! And I, instead"]]]
