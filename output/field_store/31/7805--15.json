It happened in this way. At the Sunbeam Nursery one  morning Nyoda saw her surrounded by a group of breathlessly listening  children and joined the circle to hear the story Migwan was telling. She  had apparently just finished, and the childish voices were calling out  from all sides, \"Tell it again!\" Nyoda listened with interest as Migwan,  with a solemn expression and impressive voice, recited the tragic tale  of the \"Goop Who Wouldn't Wash\":      Gunther Augustus Agricola Gunn,    He was a Goop if there ever was one!    Slapped his small sister whene'er he could reach her,    Muddied the carpet, made mouths at the preacher,    Talked back to his mother whenever she chid,    Always did otherwise than he was bid;    Gunther Augustus Agricola Gunn,    Manners he certainly had not a one!      O bad little Goops, wheresoe'er you may be,    Take heed what befell young Agricola G!    For Gunther Augustus (unlike you, I hope),    Had an inborn aversion to water and soap;    He fought when they washed him, he squirmed and he twisted,    He shrieked, scratched and wriggled until they desisted;    He would not be combed--it was no use to try--    O he was a Goop, they could all testify!      So Gunther went dirty--unwashed and uncombed,    With hands black as pitch through the garden he roamed;    When suddenly a monstrous black shadow fell o'er him,    And the Woman Who Scrubs Dirty Goops stood before him!      Her waist was a washcloth, her skirt was a towel,    She looked down at him with a horrible scowl;    One hand was a brush and the other a comb,    Her forehead was soap and her pompadour foam!    Her foot was a shoebrush, and on it did grow    A shiny steel nail file in place of a toe!    Gunther Augustus Agricola Gunn,    He had a fright if he ever had one!      In a twinkling she seized him--Oh, how he did shriek!    And threw him headforemost right into the creek!    Rubbed soap in his eyes (Dirty Goops, O beware!),    And in combing the snarls pulled out handfuls of hair!    Scrubbed the skin off his nose, brushed his teeth till they bled,    Tweaked his ears, rapped his knuckles, and gleefully said,    \"Gunther Augustus Agricola Gunn,    There'll be a difference when I get done!\"      After that young Agricola strove hard to see    How very, how heavenly good he could be!    Wiped his feet at the door, tipped his hat to the preacher,    Caressed his small sister whene'er he could reach her!    Stood still while they washed him and combed out his hair,    His garments he folded and laid on a chair!    Gunter Augustus Agricola Gunn,    He was a saint if there ever was one!    \"Where did you get that poem?\" asked Nyoda.    \"I wrote it myself,\" answered Migwan.    \"Good work!\" said Nyoda; \"will you give me a copy?\"    Nyoda showed the poem to Professor Green and Professor Green showed it  to a friend who was column editor of one of the big dailies, and one  fine morning the poem appeared in the paper, with Migwan's full name and  address at the bottom, \"Elsie Gardiner, Adams Ave.\" The Gardiners did  not happen to take that particular paper and Migwan knew nothing of it  until she reached school and was congratulated on all sides. Professor  Green, who had taken a great interest in Migwan since she had worked up  his hunting notes in such a striking style, and regarded her as his  special protege, was anxious to have the whole school know what a gifted  girl she was. He had a conference with the principal, and as a result  Migwan was asked to read her poem at the rhetorical exercises in the  auditorium that day. When she finished the applause was deafening, and  with blushing cheeks and downcast eyes she ran from the stage. There  were distinguished visitors at school that day, representatives of a  national organization who had come to address the scholars, and they  came up to Migwan after she had read her poem to be introduced and offer  congratulations. Teachers stopped her in the hall to tell her how bright  she was, and the other pupils regarded her with great respect. Migwan  was the lion of the hour.    She hurried home on flying feet and danced into the house waving the  paper. \"Oh, mother,\" she called, as soon as she was inside the door,  \"guess what I've got to show you!\" Her mother was not in the kitchen and  she ran through the house looking for her. \"Oh, mother,\" she called,  \"oh, moth--why, what's the matter?\" she asked, stopping in surprise in  the sitting room door. Mrs. Gardiner lay on the couch, and beside her  sat the family doctor. Betty stood by looking very much frightened. Mrs.  Gardiner looked up as Migwan came in. \"It's nothing,\" she said, trying  to speak lightly; \"just a little spell.\"    \"Mother has to go to the hospital,\" said Betty in a scared voice.    \"Just a little operation,\" said Mrs. Gardiner hastily, as Migwan looked  ready to drop. \"Nothing serious--very.\"    Migwan's hour of triumph was completely forgotten in the anxiety of the  next few days. Her mother rallied slowly from the operation, and it  looked as though she would have to remain in the hospital a long time.  It was impossible to meet this added expense from their little income,  and Migwan, setting her teeth bravely, drew the remainder of her college  money from the bank to pay the hospital and surgeon's bills. Then she  set to work with redoubled zeal to write something which would sell. So  far everything she had sent out had come back promptly. For a long time  certain advertisements in the magazines had been holding her attention.  They read something like this: \"Write Moving Picture Plays. Bring $50 to  $100 each. We teach you how by an infallible method. Anybody can do it.  Full particulars sent for a postage stamp.\" Migwan had seen quite a few  picture plays, many of them miserably poor, and felt that she could  write better ones than some, or at least just as good. She wrote to the  address given in one of the advertisements, asking for \"full  particulars.\" Back came a letter couched in the most glowing terms,  which Migwan was not experienced enough to recognize as a multigraphed  copy, which stated that the writer had noticed in her letter of inquiry  a literary ability well worth cultivating, and he would feel himself  highly honored to be allowed to teach her to write moving picture plays,  a field in which she would speedily gain fame and fortune. He would  throw open the gates of success for her for the nominal fee of thirty  dollars, with five dollars extra for \"stationery, etc.\" His regular fee  was thirty-five dollars, but it was not often that he came across so  much ability as she had, and he considered the pleasure he would derive  from the correspondence course worth five dollars to him. Would she not  send the first payment of five dollars by return mail so that his  enjoyment might begin as soon as possible?    Migwan read the letter through with a beating heart until she came to  the price, when her heart sank into her shoes. To pay thirty dollars was  entirely out of the question. She wrote to several more advertisements  and received much the same answer from all of them. There was only one  which she could consider at all. This one offered no correspondence  course, but advertised a book giving all the details of scenario  writing, \"history of the picture play, form, where to sell your plays,  etc., all in one comprehensive volume.\" The price of the book was three  dollars. Migwan hesitated a long time over this last one, but the subtle  language of the advertisement drew her back again and again like a  magnet, and finally overcame her doubts. \"It will pay for itself many  times when I have learned to write plays,\" she reflected. So she took  three precious dollars from the housekeeping money and sent for the  book. She did not ask Nyoda's advice this time; somehow she shrank from  telling her about it.    In three days the book arrived. The \"comprehensive volume\" was a  paper-covered pamphlet containing exactly twenty-nine pages. It could  not have sold for more than ten or fifteen cents in a book store. The  first five pages were devoted to a description of the phenomenal sale of  the first edition of the book, two more enlarged upon the \"unfillable  demand\" of the motion picture companies for scenarios, while the  remainder of the book was given over to the \"technique\" of scenario  writing. Migwan read it through eagerly, and did gain an idea of the  form in which a play should be cast, although the information was meagre  enough. Three dollars was an outrageous price to pay for the book,  thought Migwan, but she comforted herself with the thought that by means  of it she would soon lift the family out of their difficulties. She set  to work with a cheery heart. Writing picture plays was easier than  writing stories on account of the skeleton form in which they were cast,  which made it unnecessary to strive for excellence of literary style.  She finished the first one in two nights and sent it off with high  hopes. The company she sent it to was listed in the book as \"greatly in  need of one-reel scenarios, and taking about everything sent to them.\"  She was filled with a secret elation and went about the house singing  like a lark, until Betty, who had been moping like an owl since her  mother went to the hospital, was quite cheered up. \"What are you so  happy about?\" she asked curiously. \"You act as if somebody had left you  a fortune.\"    \"Maybe they have,\" replied Migwan mysteriously; \"wait and see!\"    Her joy was short-lived, however, for the play came back even more  promptly than the stories had. Undaunted, she sent it out again and  again. The reasons given for rejection would have been amusing if Migwan  had not felt so disappointed. One said there was insufficient plot; one  said the plot was too complicated; one said it was too long for a  one-reel, and the next said it was too short even for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11734"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 460, October 25, 1884 (#15)"],[1,"o-optic rotation of the plane of polarization of light; supposing the  application of our solid to be a model of the luminiferous ether for  illustrating the undulatory theory of light. The gyrostatic model spring  balance is arranged to have zero moment of momentum as a whole, and  therefore to contribute nothing to the Faraday rotation; with this  arrangement the model illustrates the luminiferous ether in a field  unaffected by magnetic force. But now let there be a different rotational  velocity imparted to the jointed square round the axis of the two  projecting hooked rods, such as to give a resultant moment of momentum  round any given line through the center of inertia of the system; and let  pairs of the hooked rods in the model thus altered, which is no longer a  model of a mere spring balance, be applied as connections between millions  of pairs of particles as before, with the lines of resultant moment of  momentum all similarly directed. We now have a model elastic solid which  will have the property that the direction of vibration in waves of  rectilinear vibrations propagated through it shall turn round the line of  propagation of the waves, just as Faraday's observation proves to be done  by the line of vibration of light in a dense medium between the poles of a  powerful magnet. The case of wave front perpendicular to the lines of  resultant moment of momentum (that is to say, the direction of propagation  being parallel to these lines) corresponds, in our mechanical model, to the  case of light traveling in the direction of the lines of force in a  magnetic field.    In these illustrations and models we have different portions of ideal rigid  matter acting upon one another, by normal pressure at mathematical points  of contact--of course no forces of friction are supposed. It is exceedingly  interesting to see how thus, with no other postulates than inertia,  rigidity, and mutual impenetrability, we can thoroughly model not only an  elastic solid, and any combination of elastic solids, but so complex and  recondite a phenomenon as the passage of polarized light through a magnetic  field. But now, with the view of ultimately discarding the postulate of  rigidity from all our materials, let us suppose some to be absolutely  destitute of rigidity, and to possess merely inertia and incompressibility,  and mutual impenetrability with reference to the still remaining rigid  matter. With these postulates we can produce a perfect model of mutual  action at a distance between solid particles, fulfilling the condition, so  keenly desired by Newton and Faraday, of being explained by continuous  action through an intervening medium. The law of the mutual force in our  model, however, is not the simple Newtonian law, but the much more complex  law of the mutual action between electro magnets--with this difference,  that in the hydro-kinetic model in every case the force is opposite in  direction to the corresponding force in the electro-magnetic analogue.  Imagine a solid bored through with a hole, and placed in our ideal perfect  liquid. For a moment let the hole be stopped by a diaphragm, and let an  impulsure pressure be applied for an instant uniformly over the whole  membrane, and then instantly let the membrane be dissolved into liquid.  This action originates a motion of the liquid relatively to the solid, of a  kind to which I have given the name of \"irrotational circulation,\" which  remains absolutely constant however the solid be moved through the liquid.  Thus, at any time the actual motion of the liquid at any point in the  neighborhood of the solid will be the resultant of the motion it would have  in virtue of the circulation alone, were the solid at rest, and the motion  it would have in virtue of the motion of the solid itself, had there been  no circulation established through the aperture. It is interesting and  important to remark in passing that the whole kinetic energy of the liquid  is the sum of the kinetic energies which it would have in the two cases  separately. Now, imagine the whole liquid to be inclosed in an infinitely  large, rigid, containing vessel, and in the liquid, at an infinite distance  from any part of the containing vessel, let two perforated solids, with  irrotational circulation through each, be placed at rest near one another.  The resultant fluid motion due to the two circulations, will give rise to  fluid pressure on the two bodies, which, if unbalanced, will cause them to  move. The force systems--force-and-torques, or pairs of forces--required to  prevent them from moving will be mutual and opposite, and will be the same  as, but opposite in direction to, the mutual force systems required to hold  at rest two electromagnets fulfilling the following specification: The two  electro magnets are to be of the same shape and size as the two bodies, and  to be placed in the same relative positions, and to consist of infinitely  thin layers of electric currents in the surfaces of solids possessing  extreme diamagnetic quality--in other words, infinitely small permeability.  The distribution of electric current on each body may be any whatever which  fulfills the condition that the total current across any closed line drawn  on the surface once through the aperture is equal to 1/4 [pi] of the  circulation[1] through the aperture in the hydro-kinetic analogue.    [Footnote 1: The integral of tangential component velocity all round any  closed curve, passing once through the aperture, is defined as the  \"cyclic-constant\" or the \"circulation\" (\"Vortex Motion,\" Sec. 60 (a), _Trans_.  R.S.E., April 29, 1867). It has the same value for all closed curves  passing just once through the aperture, and it remains constant through all  time, whether the solid body be in motion or at rest.]    It might be imagined that the action at a distance thus provided for by  fluid motion could serve as a foundation for a theory of the equilibrium,  and the vibrations, of elastic solids, and the transmission of waves like  those of light through an extended quasi-elastic solid medium. But  unfortunately for this idea the equilibrium is essentially unstable, both  in the case of magnets and, notwithstanding the fact that the forces are  oppositely directed, in the hydro-kinetic analogue also, when the several  movable bodies (two or any greater number) are so placed relatively as to  be in equilibrium. If, however, we connect the perforated bodies with  circulation through them in the hydro-kinetic system, by jointed rigid  connecting links, we may arrange for configurations of stable equilibrium.  Thus, without fly-wheels, but with fluid circulations through apertures, we  may make a model spring balance or a model luminiferous ether, either  without or with the rotational quality corresponding to that of the true  luminiferous ether in the magnetic fluid--in short, do all by the  perforated solids with circulations through them that we saw we could do by  means of linked gyrostats. But something that we cannot do by linked  gyrostats we can do by the perforated bodies with fluid circulation: we can  make a model gas. The mutual action at a distance, repulsive or attractive  according to the mutual aspect of the two bodies when passing within  collisional distance[1] of one another, suffices to produce the change of  direction of motion in collision, which essentially constitutes the  foundation of the kinetic theory of gases, and which, as we have seen  before, may as well be due to attraction as to repulsion, so far as we know  from any investigation hitherto made in this theory.    [Footnote 1: According to this view, there is no precise distance, or  definite condition respecting the distance, between two molecules, at which  apparently they come to be in collision, or when receding from one another  they cease to be in collision. It is convenient, however, in the kinetic  theory of gases, to adopt arbitrarily a precise definition of collision,  according to which two bodies or particles mutually acting at a distance  may be said to be in collision when their mutual action exceeds some  definite arbitrarily assigned limit, as, for example, when the radius of  curvature of the path of either body is less than a stated fraction (one  one-hundredth, for instance) of the distance between them.]    There remains, however, as we have seen before, the difficulty of providing  for the case of actual impacts between the solids, which must be done by  giving them massless spring buffers or, which amounts to the same thing,  attributing to them repulsive forces sufficiently powerful at very short  distances to absolutely prevent impacts between solid and solid; unless we  adopt the equally repugnant idea of infinitely small perforated solids,  with infinitely great fluid circulations through them. Were it not for this  fundamental difficulty, the hydro-kinetic model gas would be exceedingly  interesting; and, though we could scarcely adopt it as conceivably a true  representation of what gases really are, it might still have some  importance as a model configuration of solid and liquid matter, by which  without elasticity the elasticity of true gas might be represented.    But lastly, since the hydro-kinetic model gas with perforated solids and  fluid circulations through them fails because of the impacts between the  solids, let us annul the solids and leave the liquid performing  irrotational circulation round vacancy,[1] in the place of the solid cores  which we have hitherto supposed; or let us annul the rigidity of the solid  cores of the rings, and give them molecular rotation according to  Helmholtz's theory of vortex motion. For stability the molecular rotation  must be such as to give the same velocity at the boundary of the rotational  fluid core as that of the irrotationally circulating liquid in contact with  it, because, as I have proved, frictional slip between two portions of"]]]
