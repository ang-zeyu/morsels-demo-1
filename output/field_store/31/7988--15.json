He saw him the owner of that list, using his power,  gradually emerging from the shadow, lavishly squandering the money  which he extorted from his victims, securing his election as a  district-councillor and deputy, holding sway by dint of threats  and terror, unpunished, invulnerable, unattackable, feared by the  government, which would rather submit to his orders than declare war  upon him, respected by the judicial authorities: so powerful, in a word,  that Prasville had been appointed secretary-general of police, over the  heads of all who had prior claims, for the sole reason that he hated  Daubrecq with a personal hatred.    \"And you saw him again?\" he asked.    \"I saw him again. I had to. My husband was dead, but his honour remained  untouched. Nobody suspected the truth. In order at least to defend the  name which he left me, I accepted my first interview with Daubrecq.\"    \"Your first, yes, for there have been others.\"    \"Many others,\" she said, in a strained voice, \"yes, many others... at  the theatre... or in the evening, at Enghien... or else in Paris, at  night ... for I was ashamed to meet that man and I did not want people  to know it... But it was necessary... A duty more imperative than any  other commanded it: the duty of avenging my husband...\"    She bent over Lupin and, eagerly:    \"Yes, revenge has been the motive of my conduct and the sole  preoccupation of my life. To avenge my husband, to avenge my ruined son,  to avenge myself for all the harm that he has done me: I had no other  dream, no other object in life. That is what I wanted: to see that man  crushed, reduced to poverty, to tears--as though he still knew how to  cry!--sobbing in the throes of despair...\"    \"You wanted his death,\" said Lupin, remembering the scene between them  in Daubrecq's study.    \"No, not his death. I have often thought of it, I have even raised my  arm to strike him, but what would have been the good? He must have taken  his precautions. The paper would remain. And then there is no revenge  in killing a man... My hatred went further than that... It demanded his  ruin, his downfall; and, to achieve that, there was but one way: to cut  his claws. Daubrecq, deprived of the document that gives him his immense  power, ceases to exist. It means immediate bankruptcy and disaster...  under the most wretched conditions. That is what I have sought.\"    \"But Daubrecq must have been aware of your intentions?\"    \"Certainly. And, I assure you, those were strange meetings of ours: I  watching him closely, trying to guess his secret behind his actions and  his words, and he... he...\"    \"And he,\" said Lupin, finishing Clarisse's thought, \"lying in wait for  the prey which he desires... for the woman whom he has never ceased to  love... whom he loves... and whom he covets with all his might and with  all his furious passion...\"    She lowered her head and said, simply:    \"Yes.\"    A strange duel indeed was that which brought face to face those two  beings separated by so many implacable things! How unbridled must  Daubrecq's passion be for him to risk that perpetual threat of death and  to introduce to the privacy of his house this woman whose life he had  shattered! But also how absolutely safe he must feel himself!    \"And your search ended... how?\" asked Lupin.    \"My search,\" she replied, \"long remained without fruit. You know the  methods of investigation which you have followed and which the police  have followed on their side. Well, I myself employed them, years before  either of you did, and in vain. I was beginning to despair. Then, one  day, when I had gone to see Daubrecq in his villa at Enghien, I picked  up under his writing-table a letter which he had begun to write,  crumpled up and thrown into the waste-paper-basket. It consisted of  a few lines in bad English; and I was able to read this: 'Empty  the crystal within, so as to leave a void which it is impossible to  suspect.' Perhaps I should not have attached to this sentence all the  importance which it deserved, if Daubrecq, who was out in the garden,  had not come running in and begun to turn out the waste-paper-basket,  with an eagerness which was very significant. He gave me a suspicious  look: 'There was a letter there,' he said. I pretended not to  understand. He did not insist, but his agitation did not escape me; and  I continued my quest in this direction. A month later, I discovered,  among the ashes in the drawing-room fireplace, the torn half of an  English invoice. I gathered that a Stourbridge glass-blower, of the name  of John Howard, had supplied Daubrecq with a crystal bottle made after a  model. The word 'crystal' struck me at once. I went to Stourbridge, got  round the foreman of the glass-works and learnt that the stopper of this  bottle had been hollowed out inside, in accordance with the instruction  in the order, so as to leave a cavity, the existence of which would  escape observation.\"    Lupin nodded his head:    \"The thing tallies beyond a doubt. Nevertheless, it did not seem to me,  that, even under the gilt layer... And then the hiding-place would be  very tiny!\"    \"Tiny, but large enough,\" she said. \"On my return from England, I went  to the police-office to see Prasville, whose friendship for me had  remained unchanged. I did not hesitate to tell him, first, the reasons  which had driven my husband to suicide and, secondly, the object of  revenge which I was pursuing. When I informed him of my discoveries, he  jumped for joy; and I felt that his hatred for Daubrecq was as strong  as ever. I learnt from him that the list was written on a slip of  exceedingly thin foreign-post-paper, which, when rolled up into a sort  of pellet, would easily fit into an exceedingly limited space. Neither  he nor I had the least hesitation. We knew the hiding-place. We agreed  to act independently of each other, while continuing to correspond in  secret. I put him in touch with Clemence, the portress in the Square  Lamartine, who was entirely devoted to me...\"    \"But less so to Prasville,\" said Lupin, \"for I can prove that she  betrays him.\"    \"Now perhaps, but not at the start; and the police searches were  numerous. It was at that time, ten months ago, that Gilbert came into my  life again. A mother never loses her love for her son, whatever he may  do, whatever he may have done. And then Gilbert has such a way with  him... well, you know him. He cried, kissed my little Jacques, his  brother and I forgave him.\"    She stopped and, weary-voiced, with her eyes fixed on the floor,  continued:    \"Would to Heaven that I had not forgiven him! Ah, if that hour could but  return, how readily I should find the horrible courage to turn him away!  My poor child... it was I who ruined him!...\" And, pensively, \"I should  have had that or any sort of courage, if he had been as I pictured him  to myself and as he himself told me that he had long been: bearing the  marks of vice and dissipation, coarse, deteriorated.    \"But, though he was utterly changed in appearance, so much so that I  could hardly recognize him, there was, from the point of view of--how  shall I put it?--from the moral point of view, an undoubted improvement.  You had helped him, lifted him; and, though his mode of life was hateful  to me, nevertheless he retained a certain self-respect... a sort of  underlying decency that showed itself on the surface once more... He was  gay, careless, happy... And he used to talk of you with such affection!\"    She picked her words, betraying her embarrassment, not daring, in  Lupin's presence, to condemn the line of life which Gilbert had selected  and yet unable to speak in favour of it.    \"What happened next?\" asked Lupin.    \"I saw him very often. He would come to me by stealth, or else I went  to him and we would go for walks in the country. In this way, I was  gradually induced to tell him our story, of his father's suicide and  the object which I was pursuing. He at once took fire. He too wanted  to avenge his father and, by stealing the crystal stopper, to avenge  himself on Daubrecq for the harm which he had done him. His first  idea--from which, I am bound to tell you, he never swerved--was to  arrange with you.\"    \"Well, then,\" cried Lupin, \"he ought to have...!\"    \"Yes, I know... and I was of the same opinion. Unfortunately, my poor  Gilbert--you know how weak he is!--was under the influence of one of his  comrades.\"    \"Vaucheray?\"    \"Yes, Vaucheray, a saturnine spirit, full of bitterness and envy, an  ambitious, unscrupulous, gloomy, crafty man, who had acquired a great  empire over my son. Gilbert made the mistake of confiding in him and  asking his advice. That was the origin of all the mischief. Vaucheray  convinced him and convinced me as well that it would be better if we  acted by ourselves. He studied the business, took the lead and finally  organized the Enghien expedition and, under your direction, the burglary  at the Villa Marie-Therese, which Prasville and his detectives had been  unable to search thoroughly, because of the active watch maintained by  Leonard the valet. It was a mad scheme. We ought either to have trusted  in your experience entirely, or else to have left you out altogether,  taking the risk of fatal mistakes and dangerous hesitations. But we  could not help ourselves. Vaucheray ruled us. I agreed to meet Daubrecq  at the theatre. During this time the thing took place. When I came  home, at twelve o'clock at night, I heard the terrible result: Leonard  murdered, my son arrested. I at once received an intuition of the  future. Daubrecq's appalling prophecy was being realized: it meant trial  and sentence. And this through my fault, through the fault of me, the  mother, who had driven my son toward the abyss from which nothing could  extricate him now.\"    Clarisse wrung her hands and shivered from head to foot.

From this place the party again diverged, according to their several  fancies, some to the sudatorium, which answered the purpose of our  vapor-baths, and thence to the warm-bath itself; those more accustomed  to exercise, and capable of dispensing with so cheap a purchase of  fatigue, resorted at once to the calidarium, or water-bath.    In order to complete this sketch, and give to the reader an adequate  notion of this, the main luxury of the ancients, we will accompany  Lepidus, who regularly underwent the whole process, save only the cold  bath, which had gone lately out of fashion.  Being then gradually warmed  in the tepidarium, which has just been described, the delicate steps of  the Pompeian elegant were conducted to the sudatorium.  Here let the  reader depict to himself the gradual process of the vapor-bath,  accompanied by an exhalation of spicy perfumes.  After our bather had  undergone this operation, he was seized by his slaves, who always  awaited him at the baths, and the dews of heat were removed by a kind of  scraper, which (by the way) a modern traveler has gravely declared to be  used only to remove the dirt, not one particle of which could ever  settle on the polished skin of the practised bather. Thence, somewhat  cooled, he passed into the water-bath, over which fresh perfumes were  profusely scattered, and on emerging from the opposite part of the room,  a cooling shower played over his head and form.  Then wrapping himself  in a light robe, he returned once more to the tepidarium, where he found  Glaucus, who had not encountered the sudatorium; and now, the main  delight and extravagance of the bath commenced.  Their slaves anointed  the bathers from vials of gold, of alabaster, or of crystal, studded  with profusest gems, and containing the rarest unguents gathered from  all quarters of the world.  The number of these smegmata used by the  wealthy would fill a modern volume--especially if the volume were  printed by a fashionable publisher; Amaracinum, Megalium, Nardum--omne  quod exit in um--while soft music played in an adjacent chamber, and  such as used the bath in moderation, refreshed and restored by the  grateful ceremony, conversed with all the zest and freshness of  rejuvenated life.    'Blessed be he who invented baths!' said Glaucus, stretching himself  along one of those bronze seats (then covered with soft cushions) which  the visitor to Pompeii sees at this day in that same tepidarium.  'Whether he were Hercules or Bacchus, he deserved deification.'    'But tell me,' said a corpulent citizen, who was groaning and wheezing  under the operation of being rubbed down, 'tell me, O Glaucus!--evil  chance to thy hands, O slave! why so rough?--tell me--ugh--ugh!--are the  baths at Rome really so magnificent?' Glaucus turned, and recognized  Diomed, though not without some difficulty, so red and so inflamed were  the good man's cheeks by the sudatory and the scraping he had so lately  undergone.  'I fancy they must be a great deal finer than these.  Eh?'  Suppressing a smile, Glaucus replied:    'Imagine all Pompeii converted into baths, and you will then form a  notion of the size of the imperial thermae of Rome.  But a notion of the  size only. Imagine every entertainment for mind and body--enumerate all  the gymnastic games our fathers invented--repeat all the books Italy and  Greece have produced--suppose places for all these games, admirers for  all these works--add to this, baths of the vastest size, the most  complicated construction--intersperse the whole with gardens, with  theatres, with porticoes, with schools--suppose, in one word, a city of  the gods, composed but of palaces and public edifices, and you may form  some faint idea of the glories of the great baths of Rome.'    'By Hercules!' said Diomed, opening his eyes, 'why, it would take a  man's whole life to bathe!'    'At Rome, it often does so,' replied Glaucus, gravely.  'There are many  who live only at the baths.  They repair there the first hour in which  the doors are opened, and remain till that in which the doors are  closed.  They seem as if they knew nothing of the rest of Rome, as if  they despised all other existence.'    'By Pollux! you amaze me.'    'Even those who bathe only thrice a day contrive to consume their lives  in this occupation.  They take their exercise in the tennis-court or the  porticoes, to prepare them for the first bath; they lounge into the  theatre, to refresh themselves after it.  They take their prandium under  the trees, and think over their second bath. By the time it is prepared,  the prandium is digested.  From the second bath they stroll into one of  the peristyles, to hear some new poet recite: or into the library, to  sleep over an old one. Then comes the supper, which they still consider  but a part of the bath: and then a third time they bathe again, as the  best place to converse with their friends.'    'Per Hercle! but we have their imitators at Pompeii.'    'Yes, and without their excuse.  The magnificent voluptuaries of the  Roman baths are happy: they see nothing but gorgeousness and splendor;  they visit not the squalid parts of the city; they know not that there  is poverty in the world.  All Nature smiles for them, and her only frown  is the last one which sends them to bathe in Cocytus. Believe me, they  are your only true philosophers.'    While Glaucus was thus conversing, Lepidus, with closed eyes and scarce  perceptible breath, was undergoing all the mystic operations, not one of  which he ever suffered his attendants to omit.  After the perfumes and  the unguents, they scattered over him the luxurious powder which  prevented any further accession of heat: and this being rubbed away by  the smooth surface of the pumice, he began to indue, not the garments he  had put off, but those more festive ones termed 'the synthesis', with  which the Romans marked their respect for the coming ceremony of supper,  if rather, from its hour (three o'clock in our measurement of time), it  might not be more fitly denominated dinner.  This done, he at length  opened his eyes and gave signs of returning life.    At the same time, too, Sallust betokened by a long yawn the evidence of  existence.    'It is supper time,' said the epicure; 'you, Glaucus and Lepidus, come  and sup with me.'    'Recollect you are all three engaged to my house next week,' cried  Diomed, who was mightily proud of the acquaintance of men of fashion.    'Ah, ah! we recollect,' said Sallust; 'the seat of memory, my Diomed, is  certainly in the stomach.'    Passing now once again into the cooler air, and so into the street, our  gallants of that day concluded the ceremony of a Pompeian bath.        Chapter VIII    ARBACES COGS HIS DICE WITH PLEASURE AND WINS THE GAME.    THE evening darkened over the restless city as Apaecides took his way to  the house of the Egyptian.  He avoided the more lighted and populous  streets; and as he strode onward with his head buried in his bosom, and  his arms folded within his robe, there was something startling in the  contrast, which his solemn mien and wasted form presented to the  thoughtless brows and animated air of those who occasionally crossed his  path.    At length, however, a man of a more sober and staid demeanor, and who  had twice passed him with a curious but doubting look, touched him on  the shoulder.    'Apaecides!' said he, and he made a rapid sign with his hands: it was  the sign of the cross.    'Well, Nazarene,' replied the priest, and his face grew paler; 'what  wouldst thou?'    'Nay,' returned the stranger, 'I would not interrupt thy meditations;  but the last time we met, I seemed not to be so unwelcome.'    'You are not unwelcome, Olinthus; but I am sad and weary: nor am I able  this evening to discuss with you those themes which are most acceptable  to you.'    'O backward of heart!' said Olinthus, with bitter fervor; and art thou  sad and weary, and wilt thou turn from the very springs that refresh and  heal?'    'O earth!' cried the young priest, striking his breast passionately,  'from what regions shall my eyes open to the true Olympus, where thy  gods really dwell?  Am I to believe with this man, that none whom for so  many centuries my fathers worshipped have a being or a name?  Am I to  break down, as something blasphemous and profane, the very altars which  I have deemed most sacred? or am I to think with Arbaces--what?' He  paused, and strode rapidly away in the impatience of a man who strives  to get rid of himself.  But the Nazarene was one of those hardy,  vigorous, and enthusiastic men, by whom God in all times has worked the  revolutions of earth, and those, above all, in the establishment and in  the reformation of His own religion--men who were formed to convert,  because formed to endure.  It is men of this mould whom nothing  discourages, nothing dismays; in the fervor of belief they are inspired  and they inspire.  Their reason first kindles their passion, but the  passion is the instrument they use; they force themselves into men's  hearts, while they appear only to appeal to their judgment.  Nothing is  so contagious as enthusiasm; it is the real allegory of the tale of  Orpheus--it moves stones, it charms brutes.  Enthusiasm is the genius of  sincerity, and truth accomplishes no victories without it.    Olinthus did not then suffer Apaecides thus easily to escape him.  He  overtook and addressed him thus:    'I do not wonder, Apaecides, that I distress you; that I shake all the  elements of your mind: that you are lost in doubt; that you drift here  and there in the"]]]
