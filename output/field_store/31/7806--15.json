UNE REPONSE AUDACIEUSE    Les hommes d'esprit aiment l'esprit partout ou ils le rencontrent,  et alors meme que l'on s'en sert contre eux. Voici, a l'appui de  cette opinion, une anecdote assez curieuse, qui se rattache au  souvenir de la bataille de Kollin. On sait qu'elle fut gagnee  en 1757 par le marechal autrichien Daun sur Frederic II, roi  de Prusse.    Nous sommes a Berlin, apres la conclusion de la paix definitive.  Frederic aime a se promener dans sa capitale ou il est acclame  par tous, mais ou chacun tremble devant son regard severe. Un  jour, il rencontre un de ses vieux grenadiers de la Guerre de  Sept Ans, dont le visage est tout sillonne d'enormes balafres.  \"Dans quelle auberge, lui demande le roi d'un ton moqueur, t'es-tu  fait arranger de la sorte?--Sire, repond le grognard sans se  deconcerter, dans une auberge ou vous avez paye votre ecot: a  Kollin.\" A ces mots, Frederic fronca d'abord les sourcils; puis,  s'il faut en croire la legende, il sourit et recompensa celui qui  avait su repondre spirituellement a sa blessante question.--CLAUDE  AUGE.

J.-C. Le philosophe  voulait bien le recevoir, mais comme il connaissait son faible,  il le prevint qu'il devait payer le double de ce que les autres  payaient: \"Car, lui dit-il, je dois vous apprendre deux sciences,  celle de parler, et celle de vous taire.\" On reconnait que de  ces deux sciences, la derniere est parfois la plus difficile  a apprendre.      100. LE CREANCIER DE NAPOLEON    Une grande revue des troupes de Lyon eut lieu en 1815, immediatement  apres le debarquement de Napoleon, a son retour de l'ile d'Elbe.  Un commandant, qui voulait abaisser l'empereur aux yeux de ses  anciens soldats, leur faisaient remarquer qu'ils etaient bien  vetus et bien nourris; que leur paye etait visible sur leurs  personnes: \"Oui, certainement, repliqua un grenadier auquel il  s'adressait.--Eh bien! Continuait l'officier avec un air de  confiance, ce n'etait pas ainsi sous Napoleon. Votre paye etait  en arriere; il etait souvent votre debiteur.--Qu'est-ce que cela  fait, dit vivement le grenadier, si nous voulions lui faire credit?\"      Donnez, en francais, des definitions des noms qui se trouvent  dans cette anecdote.      101. FABLE    Un certain Parmenon imitait parfaitement le grognement du porc.  Ses camarades, jaloux de la reputation qu'il s'etait acquise  par son talent, tachaient de l'imiter, mais les spectateurs,  prevenus, disaient toujours: \"Cela est bien; mais qu'est-ce en  comparaison du porc de Parmenon?\"    Un de ses rivaux prit un jour sous sa robe un jeune porc qu'il  fit grogner. Les spectateurs, apres avoir entendu ce cri naturel,  dirent encore: \"Qu'est-ce que cela aupres du porc de Parmenon?\"    Alors il lacha son porc au milieu de l'assemblee, et les convainquit  par la que c'etait la prevention, et non la verite, qui dictait  leur jugement.

Only last week  she heard the faint squeaks and squeals of Nellie Silk's malamute pups,  and I caught her tunneling under the manger to try to get to them.  Mego's kidnapping is the one scandal in the Kennel.\"    \"I suppose they were siren calls, not to be resisted. And anyway, that  is the only blot on her otherwise spotless character. She possibly does  it for the excitement; and if you will let her go in the Hot Springs  team she will have something else to think about. If you don't give her  a new interest,\" was the sinister and gloomy prophecy, \"stealing puppies  will very likely become an obsession with her.\"    But Allan was not to be persuaded. \"She gets all of the exercise and  pleasure that she needs here about the place. If she went away only  think of the things that might happen to her youngest family. You know  how careless Birdie is with them.\"    \"That's so,\" with a sigh. \"I had quite forgotten Birdie,\" and she  recalled with regret the habit of that half grown stag-hound of dropping  bits of food into the corral, between the wires, to make friends of the  little ones; and then after working at the fastening of the gate till it  could be opened, enticing them out for a frolic.    Mego knew, as well as did the Woman and \"Scotty,\" that Birdie meant no  harm. On the contrary, she had excellent qualities, and deserved much  credit for the valuable assistance she rendered as a self-constituted  Secret Service Agent, and an ardent Advocate of Universal Peace.    When there was a quarrel in the Nursery, and the puppies became violent,  she gently separated them and gave the defeated one a cherished if  somewhat ancient bone that she had buried for such occasions; occasions  when material consolation is needed to forget material ills.    In case of serious trouble she would rush for help, whining anxiously,  and frequently her prompt action in bringing Matt prevented fatal  terminations to neighborhood feuds, race riots, or affairs of honor  between dogs with irreconcilable differences of opinion on important  subjects.    But when Birdie was not doing detective work, or holding Peace  Conferences, she was lonely and craved the companionship of the frisky  pups. And while Mego was certain that her character was above reproach,  as well as her motives, she realized also that the stag-hound was  heedless. And the wise mother had always in mind the perils that lurk  in the hoofs of horses, the wheels of wagons, and the hovering  Pound-man; and never relaxed her vigilance in guarding her family  against such dangers.    \"Well then, leaving out Mego, what dogs shall you use besides Kid, Tom,  Dick, Harry, Spot, and McMillan? I told Ben that you would take Baldy.\"    \"Yes, Baldy, and probably Rex. I have been considering Fisher and Wolf,  too. Fisher has been rather indolent and indifferent, and I have never  given Wolf a good run since I bought him of that native boy, Illayuk.\"    \"Why not Jemima? You have never given her a really good run either, and  she is no more inexperienced for the trip than is Wolf. As a matter of  fact, I have been training her quite a bit myself lately, and I find  that she is enthusiastic and good-tempered.\"    \"Scotty\" repressed a smile with difficulty. \"Of course if you've been  training her that's different.\"    He had seen her several times trying to make Jemima jump over a stick,  beg for a bone, and stand on her hind legs--quite useless  accomplishments, as George and Dan had agreed, for a sled dog. And he  had also heard her words of advice to the progressive little dog, who  did indeed seem to be anxious to create a place for herself amongst the  best in the Kennel.    \"Jemima,\" the Woman would warn her solemnly, \"there are lots of things  the Females of the Species have to learn early, if they would avoid  trouble in this world. The very first of all is to let yourself be well  groomed, make the most of the gay pompoms on your harness, and cultivate  tact above all things. Never make a public nuisance of yourself. Be  steadfast, but not militant; and do not snarl and snap, tear children's  clothing, nor upset the puppies' food dish, even though you are  dissatisfied with existing conditions. But instead, never forget there  are wonderful opportunities even in a dog's life, and be ever ready and  waiting to use them when they come. Now shake hands.\"    As a concession to the Woman's fondness for Jemima, rather than to her  training, \"Scotty\" decided to let her go with them; and to her great  delight, and to Baldy's unbarkable dismay, for Baldy had but little  regard for ambitious females, she was placed in the wheel with him.    And so, with Kid in the lead, Baldy and Jemima in the wheel, Tom, Dick,  Harry and the others arranged to the best advantage; with the Woman  covered to the eyes in furs, and surrounded by bags, rugs, and carriage  heaters, and Ben comfortably tucked away in the midst; and with \"Scotty\"  Allan at the handle-bars, they were finally ready for the start to the  Springs.    Mrs. Edwards and Moose Jones had joined the Allan girls, George, Dan and  Matt at the Kennel, to wish the travelers a pleasant journey; and as he  waved a last farewell to them before the team dropped over the brow of  the hill, Ben observed gaily, \"Well, I guess Ben Hur and all o' them old  chariot racers didn't have nothing much on Alaska racin' dog teams when  it comes t' style an' speed an' excitement.\"    [Illustration]          VII    The Dawn of a To-morrow    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    CHAPTER VII    THE DAWN OF A TO-MORROW      Once out of the streets where there is danger of upsetting the unwary or  absent-minded pedestrian, the Allan and Darling Team headed down the  trail with real pleasure in the prospect of a long run.    They almost seemed to feel that this jaunt might be in the nature of a  \"try-out\" for racing material; or at the very least it might offer  something worth while in the way of adventure.    As a matter of fact it did, in the end, prove an eventful trip.  Particularly for Baldy, who gained recognition in an unexpected manner;  for the Woman, whose experiences nearly quenched her ardor for  exploration; and for Jemima, who learned that masculine human nature  respects feminine ambition up to a certain point only, and then  considers it a form of mania to be restrained.    Just behind was Pete Bernard, a sturdy French Canadian, trying to hold  his uncontrollable, half-wild huskies, who were jumping and making  sudden lunges toward any stranger--man or dog--that wandered near; and  especially toward the Yellow Peril, who was a free lance in the  expedition, and as such was particularly irritating to those in harness.  They were a perfect contrast to \"Scotty's\" dogs, who had been taught to  step into place, each as his name was called, standing quietly until all  were in position, and the traces were snapped to the tow-line; and then,  as the signal was given, to dart ahead with the ease and precision of  machinery started by electricity. Pete's sled was piled high with  freight and luggage, and astride of this was the Big Man, also in furs.    It was a cloudless day in January--a marvelous combination of white and  blue. Snowy plains rose almost imperceptibly into softly curved hills,  and ended in rugged mountains that were outlined in sharp, silvery  peaks against the dazzling sky.    The air was crisp and keen, the jingle of the sled-bells merry, and  Baldy even forgot, in the very joy of living, and in the nearness of  Ben, that Jemima was his team-mate.    [Illustration: THE AIR WAS CRISP AND  KEEN]    They could faintly hear Pete's voice giving strange directions to his  dogs; for Pete was Captain of a coasting schooner in summer, and  freighted with a dog team in winter, and used the same terms in both  occupations. He steered his ship \"Gee\" and \"Haw,\" admonished his dogs  \"not to get tangled up in their riggin',\" and cautioned them against  \"runnin' afoul of other craft.\" Of course no well raised dog could be  expected to know that his harness was \"riggin',\" nor that a sled could  possibly come under the head of \"craft \"; and he would be quite at a  loss to grasp Pete's meaning generally. But as Pete's team never obeyed  anyway, except by the exercise of sheer bodily force, it made but small  difference how he spoke to them.    On they came, \"passenger\" and \"cargo\" safely aboard, some distance  behind the Racers, who passed before long the famous Paystreak Diggings,  which had yielded their many millions, and were soon beyond the groups  of miners' cabins on the Third Beach Line.    It was a very different Baldy--this Baldy of Nome--from the one who had  so often in the days gone by traveled the Golconda Trail with his  friend, the boy. The days when he was hungry and foot-sore and  heart-sick, and now--Baldy straightened up proudly, and nearly pulled  Jemima off her feet in his desire to render good service for favors  received. While Ben's eyes sparkled as he glanced at the dog in his  responsible position of right wheeler in the Allan and Darling Team of  Racers.    There the way led up a gentle slope, then down to the bed of Nome River,  where they kept on the ice for several miles. It was here that Jemima's  unfitness for work with experts began to manifest itself; as well as the  unusual tenacity of purpose that seemed either perseverance or  perversity--depending upon whether you looked at the matter from Baldy's  standpoint or from hers.    \"Scotty\" watched with some amusement her efforts to keep up with the  others on the slippery ice, and when he thought she was becoming tired  he stopped her, and let her run free. When she realized that she was  out of the team her amazement and chagrin were plainly manifest. She sat  down in the snow while she figured out a plan of campaign for the  restoration of her rights; and then was off immediately in pursuit.  \"Scotty\" had brought Fisher back into the wheel with"]]]
