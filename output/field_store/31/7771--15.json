Scattered  groups of travellers journeying along the desert tracks had evoked no  hostilities, and no treachery broke the loyalty to Islam at Mecca. The  Kureisch were indeed outwitted, and only became conscious of the  subtleties of their antagonist when his plan was accomplished.    But in spite of the seemingly favourable situation, the leader tarried  because \"the Lord had not as yet given him command to emigrate.\" The very  natural hesitation of Mahomet is only characteristic of him. He knew very  well what issues were at stake, and was not anxious to burn his boats  rashly; indeed, he bore upon his shoulders at this time all the  responsibility of the future of his little flock, who so confidently  resigned their fortunes into his hands. If his scheme at Medina should  fail, he knew that nothing would save him from Kureischite fury, and he  also felt great reluctance in leaving Mecca himself, for at that time it  could not but mean the knell of his hopes of gaining his native city to  his creed. He must have foreseen his establishment of power in Medina,  and possibly he had visions of its extension to neighbouring tribes, but  he could not have foreseen the humiliation of his native city at his  feet, glad at last to receive the faith of one whom she now regarded as  the sovereign potentate of Arabian territory.    And with their friend and guide remained Abu Bekr and Ali--Abu Bekr  because he would not leave his companion in prayer and persecution,  and Ali because his valour and enthusiasm made him a protector against  possible attacks. Here was the opportunity for the Kureisch. They knew  the extent of the emigration, and that Abu Bekr and Ali were the only  Muslim of importance left except the Prophet. They determined to make one  last attempt to coerce into submission this fantastic but resolute  leader, who possessed in supreme measure the power of winning the faith  and devotion of men.    Tradition has it that Mahomet's assassination was definitely planned, and  Mahomet assuredly thought so too, when he discovered that a man from each  tribe had been chosen to visit his home at night. The motive can hardly  have been assassination, but doubtless the chiefs were prepared to take  rather strong measures to restrain Mahomet, and this action finally  decided the Prophet that delay was dangerous.    At this crisis in his fortunes he had two staunch helpers, who did not  hesitate to risk their lives in his service, and with them he anticipated  his foes. Ali was chosen to represent his beloved master before the  menaces of the Kureisch. Mahomet put him into his own bed and arrayed  him in his sacred green mantle; then, as legend has it, taking a handful  of dust, he recited the sura \"Ya Sin,\" which he himself reverenced as  \"the heart of the Kuran,\" and scattering the dust abroad, he called down  confusion upon the heads of the Unbelievers. With Abu Bekr he then fled  swiftly and silently from the city and made his way unseen to the cave of  Thaur, a few miles outside its boundaries.    Around the cave of Thaur cluster as many and as beautiful legends as  surround the stable at Bethlehem. The wild pigeons flew out and in  unharmed, screening the Prophet by their untroubled presence from the  searchings of the Kureisch, and a thorn tree spread her branches across  the mouth of the cave supporting a spider's frail and glistening web,  which was renewed whenever a friend visited the two prisoners to bring  food and tidings.    Here Mahomet and Abu Bekr, henceforward known as the \"Second of Two,\"  remained until the fierceness of the pursuit slackened. Asma, Abu Bekr's  daughter, brought them food at sundown, and what news she could glean  from the rumours that were abroad, and from the lips of Ali. There was  very real danger of their surprise and capture, but once more Mahomet's  magnificent faith in God and his cause never wavered. Abu Bekr was afraid  for his master:    \"We are but two, and if the Kureisch find us unarmed, what chance have  we?\"    \"We are but two,\" replied Mahomet, \"but God is in the midst a third.\"    He looked unflinchingly to Allah for succour and protection, and his  faith was justified. His thanksgiving is contained in the Kuran: \"God  assisted your Prophet formerly, when the Unbelievers drove him forth in  company with a second only; when they two were in the cave; when the  Prophet said to his companion, 'Be not distressed; verily God is with  us.' And God sent down his tranquillity upon him and strengthened him  with hosts ye saw not, and made the word of those who believed not the  abased, and the word of God was the exalted.\"    At the end of three days the Kureischite search abated, and that night  Mahomet and Abu Bekr decided to leave the cave. Two camels were brought,  and food loaded upon them by Asma and her servants. The fastenings were  not long enough to tie on the food wallet; wherefore Asma tore her girdle  in two and bound them round it, so that she is known to this day among  the Faithful as \"She of Two Shreds.\" After a prayer to Allah in thanks  for their safety, Mahomet and Abu Bekr mounted the camels and sallied  forth to meet what unknown destiny should await them on the road to  Medina. They rapidly gained the sea-coast near Asfan in comparative  safety, secure from the attacks of the Kureisch, who would not pursue  their quarry so far into a strange country.    The Kureisch had indeed considerably abated their anger against Mahomet.  He was now safely out of their midst, and possibly they thought  themselves well rid of a man whose only object, from their point of view,  was to stir up strife, and they felt that any resentment against either  himself or his kin would be unnecessary and not worth their pains. With  remarkable tolerance for so revengeful an age, they left the families of  Mahomet and Abu Bekr quite free from molestation, nor did they offer any  opposition to Ali when they found he had successfully foiled them, and he  made his way out of the city three days after his leader had quitted it.    Mahomet and Abu Bekr journeyed on, two pilgrims making their way,  solitary but unappalled, to a strange city, whose temper and disposition  they but faintly understood. But evidences as to its friendliness were  not wanting, and these were renewed when Abu Bekr's cousin, a previous  emigrant to Medina, met them half-way and declared that the city waited  in joy and expectation for the coming of its Prophet. After some days  they crossed the valley of Akik in extreme heat, and came at last to  Coba, an outlying suburb at Medina, where, weary and apprehensive,  Mahomet rested for a while, prudently desiring that his welcome at Medina  might be assured before he ventured into its confines.    His entry into Coba savoured of a triumphal procession; the people  thronged around his camel shouting, \"The Prophet; he is come!\" mingling  their cries with homage and wondering awe, that the divine servant of  whom they had heard so much should appear to them in so human a guise, a  man among them, verily one of themselves. Mahomet's camel stopped at the  house of Omm Kolthum, and there he elected to abide during his stay in  Coba, for he possessed throughout his life a reverence for the instinct  in animals that characterises the Eastern races of all time. There,  dismounting, he addressed the people, bidding them be of good cheer, and  giving them thanks for their joyous welcome:    \"Ye people, show your joy by giving your neighbours the salvation of  peace; send portions to the poor; bind close the ties of kinship, and  offer up your prayers whilst others sleep. Thus shall ye enter Paradise  in peace.\"    For four days Mahomet dwelt in Coba, where he had encountered unfailing  support and friendship, and there was joined by Ali. His memories of Coba  were always grateful, for at the outset of his doubtful and even  dangerous enterprise he had received a good augury. Before he set out to  Medina he laid the foundations of the Mosque at Coba, where the Faithful  would be enabled to pray according to their fashion, undisturbed and  beneath the favour of Allah, and decreed that Friday was to be set apart  as a special day of prayer, when addresses were to be given at the Mosque  and the doctrines of Islam expounded.    Even as early as this Mahomet felt the mantle of sovereignty descending  upon him, for we hear now of the first of those ordinances or decrees by  which in later times he rules the lives and actions of his subjects to  the last detail. Clearly he perceived himself a leader among men, who had  it within his power to build up a community following his own dictates,  which might by consolidation even rival those already existent in  Arabia. He was taking command of a weak and factious city, and he  realised that in his hands lay its prosperity or downfall; he was, in  fact, the arbiter of its fate and of the fate of his colleagues who had  dared all with him.    But he could not stay long in Coba, while the final assay upon the  Medinans remained to be undertaken, and so we find him on the fourth day  of his sojourn making preparations for the entry into the city. It was  undertaken with some confidence of success from the messages already sent  to Coba, and proved as triumphal an entry as his former one. The populace  awaited him in expectation and reverence, and hailed him as their  Prophet, the mighty leader who had come to their deliverance. They  surrounded his camel Al-Caswa, and the camels of his followers, and when  Al-Caswa stopped outside the house of Abu Ayub, Mahomet once more  received the beast's augury and sojourned there until the building of the  Mosque. As Al-Caswa entered the paved courtyard, Mahomet dismounted to  receive the allegiance of Abu Ayub and his household; then, turning to  the people, he greeted them with words of good cheer and encouragement,  and they responded with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10743"],[0,"Moonfleet (#15)"],[1,"it to Maskew; and Maskew takes and thrusts it into his bosom underneath  his waistcoat front--all cheek by jowl with that silver-hafted pistol,  whose butt I had seen before.    The postchaise stood before the door, the horses were stamping on the  cobble-stones, and the harness jingled. Mr. Clerk had carried out his  mails, but Mr. Bailiff stopped for a moment as he flung the travelling  cloak about his shoulders to say to Elzevir, 'Tut, man, take things not  too hardly. Thou shalt have the Mermaid at 20 a year, which will be  worth ten times as much to thee as this dreary place; and canst send thy  son to Bryson's school, where they will make a scholar of him, for he is  a brave lad'; and he touched my shoulder, and gave me a kindly look as  he passed.    'I thank your worship,' said Elzevir, 'for all your goodness; but when I  quit this place, I shall not set up my staff again at any inn door.'    Mr. Bailiff seemed nettled to see his offer made so little of, and left  the room with a stiff, 'Then I wish you good day.'    Maskew had slipped out before him, and the children's noses left the  window-pane as the great man walked down the steps. There was a little  group to see the start, but it quickly melted; and before the clatter of  hoofs died away, the report spread through the village that Maskew had  turned Elzevir out of the Why Not?    For a long time after all had gone, Elzevir sat at the table with his  head between his hands, and I kept quiet also, both because I was myself  sorry that we were to be sent adrift, and because I wished to show  Elzevir that I felt for him in his troubles. But the young cannot enter  fully into their elders' sorrows, however much they may wish to, and  after a time the silence palled upon me. It was getting dusk, and the  candle which bore itself so bravely through auction and lease-sealing  burnt low in the socket. A minute later the light gave some flickering  flashes, failings, and sputters, and then the wick tottered, and out  popped the flame, leaving us with the chilly grey of a March evening  creeping up in the corners of the room. I could bear the gloom no longer,  but made up the fire till the light danced ruddy across pewter and  porcelain on the dresser. 'Come, Master Block,' I said, 'there is time  enough before May Day to think what we shall do, so let us take a cup of  tea, and after that I will play you a game of backgammon.' But he still  remained cast down, and would say nothing; and as chance would have it,  though I wished to let him win at backgammon, that so, perhaps, he might  get cheered, yet do what I would that night I could not lose. So as his  luck grew worse his moodiness increased, and at last he shut the board  with a bang, saying, in reference to that motto that ran round its edge,  'Life is like a game of hazard, and surely none ever flung worse throws,  or made so little of them as I.'          CHAPTER 8    THE LANDING    Let my lamp at midnight hour  Be seen in some high lonely tower--_Milton_      Maskew got ugly looks from the men, and sour words from the wives, as he  went up through the village that afternoon, for all knew what he had  done, and for many days after the auction he durst not show his face  abroad. Yet Damen of Ringstave and some others of the landers' men, who  made it their business to keep an eye upon him, said that he had been  twice to Weymouth of evenings, and held converse there with Mr. Luckham  of the Excise, and with Captain Henning, who commanded the troopers then  in quarters on the Nothe. And by degrees it got about, but how I do not  know, that he had persuaded the Revenue to strike hard at the smugglers,  and that a strong posse was to be held in readiness to take the landers  in the act the next time they should try to run a cargo. Why Maskew  should so put himself about to help the Revenue I cannot tell, nor did  anyone ever certainly find out; but some said 'twas out of sheer  wantonness, and a desire to hurt his neighbours; and others, that he saw  what an apt place this was for landing cargoes, and wished first to make  a brave show of zeal for the Excise, and afterwards to get the whole of  the contraband trade into his own hands. However that may be, I think he  was certainly in league with the Revenue men, and more than once I saw  him on the Manor terrace with a spy glass in his hand, and guessed that  he was looking for the lugger in the offing. Now, word was mostly given  to the lander, by safe hands, of the night on which a cargo should be  run, and then in the morning or afternoon, the lugger would come just  near enough the land to be made out with glasses, and afterwards lie off  again out of sight till nightfall. The nights chosen for such work were  without moon, but as still as might be, so long as there was wind enough  to fill the sails; and often the lugger could be made out from the beach,  but sometimes 'twas necessary to signal with flares, though they were  used as little as might be. Yet after there had been a long spell of  rough weather, and a cargo had to be run at all hazards, I have known the  boats come in even on the bright moonlight and take their risk, for 'twas  said the Excise slept sounder round us than anywhere in all the Channel.    These tales of Maskew's doings failed not to reach Elzevir, and for some  days he thought best not to move, though there was a cargo on the other  side that wanted landing badly. But one evening when he had won at  backgammon, and was in an open mood, he took me into confidence, setting  down the dice box on the table, and saying--    'There is word come from the shippers that we must take a cargo, for that  they cannot keep the stuff by them longer at St. Malo. Now with this  devil at the Manor prowling round, I dare not risk the job on Moonfleet  beach, nor yet stow the liquor in the vault; so I have told the  _Bonaventure_ to put her nose into this bay tomorrow afternoon that  Maskew may see her well, and then to lie out again to sea, as she has  done a hundred times before. But instead of waiting in the offing, she  will make straight off up Channel to a little strip of shingle underneath  Hoar Head.' I nodded to show I knew the place, and he went on--'Men used  to choose that spot in good old times to beach a cargo before the  passage to the vault was dug; and there is a worked-out quarry they  called Pyegrove's Hole, not too far off up the down, and choked with  brambles, where we can find shelter for a hundred kegs. So we'll be under  Hoar Head at five tomorrow morn with the pack-horses. I wish we could be  earlier, for the sun rises thereabout, but the tide will not serve  before.'    It was at that moment that I felt a cold touch on my shoulders, as of the  fresh air from outside, and thought beside I had a whiff of salt seaweed  from the beach. So round I looked to see if door or window stood ajar.  The window was tight enough, and shuttered to boot, but the door was not  to be seen plainly for a wooden screen, which parted it from the parlour,  and was meant to keep off draughts. Yet I could just see a top corner of  the door above the screen and thought it was not fast. So up I got to  shut it, for the nights were cold; but coming round the corner of the  screen found that 'twas closed, and yet I could have sworn I saw the  latch fall to its place as I walked towards it. Then I dashed forward,  and in a trice had the door open, and was in the street. But the night  was moonless and black, and I neither saw nor heard aught stirring, save  the gentle sea-wash on Moonfleet beach beyond the salt meadows.    Elzevir looked at me uneasily as I came back.    'What ails thee, boy?' said he.    'I thought I heard someone at the door,' I answered; 'did you not feel a  cold wind as if it was open?'    'It is but the night is sharp, the spring sets in very chill; slip the  bolt, and sit down again,' and he flung a fresh log on the fire, that  sent a cloud of sparks crackling up the chimney and out into the room.    'Elzevir,' I said, 'I think there was one listening at the door, and  there may be others in the house, so before we sit again let us take  candle and go through the rooms to make sure none are prying on us.'    He laughed and said, ''Twas but the wind that blew the door open,' but  that I might do as I pleased. So I lit another candle, and was for  starting on my search; but he cried, 'Nay, thou shalt not go alone'; and  so we went all round the house together, and found not so much as a  mouse stirring.    He laughed the more when we came back to the parlour. ''Tis the cold  has chilled thy heart and made thee timid of that skulking rascal of  the Manor; fill me a glass of Ararat milk, and one for thyself, and let  us to bed.'    I had learned by this not to be afraid of the good liquor, and while we  sat sipping it, Elzevir went on--    'There is a fortnight yet to run, and then you and I shall be cut adrift  from our moorings. It is a cruel thing to see the doors of this house  closed on me, where I and mine have lived a century or more, but I must  see it. Yet let us not be too cast down, but try to make something even  of this worst of throws.'    I was glad enough to hear him speak in this firmer strain, for I had seen  what a sore thought it had been for these days past that he must leave  the Why Not?, and how it often made him moody and downcast.    'We will have no more of innkeeping,' he said; 'I have been sick and  tired of it this many a day, and care not now to see men abuse good  liquor and addle their silly pates to fill my purse. And I have  something, boy, put snug away in Dorchester town that will give us bread  to eat and beer to drink, even if the throws run still deuce-ace. But we  must seek a roof to shelter us when the Why Not? is shut, and 'tis best  we leave this Moonfleet of ours for a season, till Maskew finds a rope's  end long enough to hang himself withal. So, when our work is done  "]]]
