The rollers consisted of two spools,  which turned on tenpenny nails driven into the top of the door. At the  lower end two more spools were mounted, turning on nails driven in the  bottom edge of the door. The rims of the spools extended slightly beyond  the outer face of the door and rolled against the sill. To keep the  water from leaking in at the top a slanting board was fastened above it,  as shown in Fig. 144. The back door was similarly constructed. Our tree  house was completed by a running balustrade around the veranda.    It strangely happened that just after our tree house had been built we  received a photograph from Uncle Ed of a Filipino tree house made of  bamboo.    [Illustration: A Filipino Bamboo Tree House.]          CHAPTER XII.    TROUBLE WITH THE TRAMPS.      We were a proud lot when the house was finally completed. From the  veranda we had an excellent view up and down the river. We could see our  camp on the island and keep watch of our goods. Late one afternoon  Dutchy and I were lolling about on the Goblins' Platform, idly watching  a hawk soaring above us. The rest of the boys had returned to the island  in canoes an hour before and left the heavy scow for us to row back. It  was drawing near supper time and we had about decided to start for home,  when I chanced to see a scow up the river. It looked exactly like ours,  and in it were two men, evidently drunk, from the way they carried on. A  glance showed me that our scow was not at its moorings. How were we to  reach the camp? One of the men had evidently seen us and was pointing us  out to his companion. We rushed down the Jacob's Ladder, but by the time  we reached the river bank they were in midstream and heading rapidly  northward. Our shouts merely brought forth derisive laughter. We were  certainly in a predicament. First we ran back up the cliff, and tried  from there to gain the attention of the rest of the fellows. They  evidently saw us but couldn't make out what we wanted. Then we ran down  to a point opposite the island and called to them. But the wind was  against us and we couldn't make them hear, so we had to plunge in and  wade across.      A COUNCIL OF WAR.    Immediately we summoned a war council. Dutchy and Jack were chosen by  lot to guard the camp, while the rest of us started in pursuit in  canoes. By the time we got under way the sun had dropped back of the  Pennsylvania hills and the shadows were climbing slowly up the Jacob's  Ladder. Swiftly we paddled up-stream, keeping close to the western  shore, where the water was very quiet. We didn't expect to go far,  because there were rapids less than three miles up, and we were sure  that no tramps would ever be ambitious enough to row a heavy scow  against the swift current at that point. As we rounded a sharp bend in  the river, we noticed a camp fire a few hundred feet further up, around  which five or six men were lounging, and there, just below them, was our  scow. What were four boys to do against six grown men? We were each  armed with a club, and could have made a pretty good fight if necessary,  but after a whispered consultation we decided it would be best to wait  until dark, when we could creep up quietly and steal away unnoticed with  our boat.      VENGEANCE.    It seemed as if darkness never would come. It was scarcely dusk when our  patience gave out and we paddled up stealthily, hugging the shore. Bill  gained the scow unnoticed, but just as he was about to push off he  discerned the body of a man within. It was one of the tramps lying there  in a drunken stupor. What was to be done? Every moment was precious. A  yell from the fireside decided him. With a mighty push he launched the  boat out into the current, while we threw him a line and towed the boat  out to midstream. With a volley of curses the men sprang up and pelted  us with stones. But they were poor shots, and we escaped without serious  injury. Our prisoner, in the meantime, was snoring heavily in the scow  undisturbed. We took him down-stream and then unceremoniously picked him  up and dumped him overboard within a few feet of the shore. It was a  rude awakening, and nearly frightened the wits out of the man. But it  brought him to his senses, and in a moment we were dodging more stones,  sent with such good aim that we had to lie flat in the bottoms of the  boats until the current carried us out of reach.      A DOUBLE SURPRISE.    It was now quite dark, and we had some difficulty in groping our way  back to camp. There was no moon and the stars were obscured by clouds.  Our only course was to follow the shore line until we got around the  bend, and then we steered for the beacon fire, which, by prearrangement,  had been kindled on Point Lookout. But the spirit of mischief was in us.  We thought we would have some fun with Dutchy. We could see him  silhouetted against the blaze. Jim and I hung back in the canoes, while  Reddy and Bill went on with the scow, splashing their oars and shouting  and singing in disguised voices, like drunken men. Dutchy was evidently  very much agitated. His \"Hello, there! Boat ahoy!\" was greeted with  derisive yells.    [Illustration: Fig. 145. A Joke on Dutchy.]    \"Say, we'll lick the life out of you, the same as we did them other  kids,\" shouted Reddy.    This was too much for Dutchy. He ran for all he was worth, yelling for  Jack to come quick.    We had a merry laugh over the situation when suddenly the tables were  turned. Something whizzed past Bill's ear; I was stung on the arm with a  heavy nail; a large stone hit the scow; Reddy had his hat knocked off,  and Fred upset his canoe trying to duck out of reach of the invisible  missiles before we could make our assailants understand that we were  friends and not the tramps. The joke was on us after all. We hadn't  counted on Dutchy's accurate aim or Jack's skill with the crossbow.      TRAMP-PROOF BOAT MOORING.    [Illustration: Fig. 146. A Tramp-proof Mooring.]    Around the camp fire that night we discussed our adventures and made  plans to prevent their recurrence. It was evident, for one thing, that  we would have to moor our boats off shore in such a way that they would  be out of reach of meddlesome persons, and yet could be drawn in toward  shore by any one who knew how. This was the way we did it. A pair of  galvanized iron ring bolts were procured on Jack's next trip to  Lamington for provisions, also a light rope about forty feet long. The  ring bolts were screwed into a pair of stout anchor stakes about two  feet from their lower ends. The rope was passed through the rings and  the ends were joined by tying them to a galvanized iron link. Then it  was soaked for a while to shrink it before it was set in place. After  the rope had shrunk sufficiently, the two stakes were driven into the  bed of the river, one close to the bank and the other far enough out to  hold the rope belt clear of the bottom. Both stakes were sawed off under  water, just above the ring bolts, so that they were hidden from sight.  When we wanted to moor our boats we secured their anchor ropes or  \"painters\" to the link. A large stepping stone marked the spot were the  inner stake was driven, and standing on this stone we were able to reach  down and haul in on the lower strap of the belt to draw the boat out a  safe distance from shore, and then when we wanted to use our boat again  we would haul in the upper strap to draw the boat in toward shore.          CHAPTER XIII.    WIGWAGGING AND HELIOGRAPHING.      Our tramp adventure was really quite a blessing to us, for it taught us  the necessity of a good signaling system between the Goblins' Platform  and the island and led to our learning how to wigwag, and later to the  construction of a heliograph. Uncle Ed, when he read of our experience,  sent us the U. S. Army \"Manual of Signaling.\" Fred, the tailor of our  camp, made us two white flags with red centers. Each flag was two feet  square and was fastened to a light staff about five feet long. Then we  got out the manual and practised sending signals, at first within  shouting distance, until we got to be quite expert.      WIGWAG SIGNALS.    [Illustration: Fig. 147-150. Ready, First Movement, Second Movement,  Third Movement.]    There were only three different movements that could be made with flags,  but in the book different combinations of these movements were given to  represent each letter of the alphabet and the numbers from 1 to 0. All  these movements were begun and ended by holding the flagstaff upright,  directly in front of the body, as shown in Fig. 147. The first movement  was to swing the flag down to the right and back (Fig. 148), the second  to the left and back (Fig. 149), and the third forward and back (Fig.  150). The following table gives the different combinations used for  various letters:    The Wigwag Alphabet.    A     22        J   1122        S     212  B   2112        K   2121        T       2  C    121        L    221        U     112  D    222        M   1221        V    1222  E     12        N     11        W    1121  F   2221        O     21        X    2122  G   2211        P   1212        Y     111  H    122        Q   1211        Z    2222  I      1        R    211        tion 1112    Numerals.    1   1111        4   2221        8    2111  2   2222        5   1122        9    1221  3   1112        6   2211        0    2112                  7   1222      [Illustration: Fig. 151. The Signal for Letter \"B.\"]    The numbers 1, 2 and 3 indicate respectively the first, second and third  movements. For instance, A was represented by the combination 22, which  means that the flag must be swept to the left and back twice. B is  represented by the combination 2112, that is, a sweep to the left, two  sweeps to the right and a final sweep to the left, as shown in Fig. 151.  The end of a word was represented by a sweep forward and back; the end  of a sentence by two sweeps forward and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],[0,"The Rebel of the School (#15)"],[1,". See, this is our queen,\" and she presented Kathleen  to the assembled girls.    \"Does the queen mind our looking at her face in turns?\" said Kate  Rourke. \"I have not specially noticed you before,\" she continued, \"but  after we have each had a good stare we will know what sort of girl you  are.\"    For reply Kathleen herself lifted the lantern and flung the full light  upon her radiant and lovely face and figure. The intense light made her  golden hair shine, and brought out the delicate perfection of each  feature; the merry eyes framed in their dark lashes, the gleaming white  teeth, the rosy lips were all apparent. But beyond the mere beauty of  feature Kathleen had to a remarkable degree the far more fascinating  beauty of expression: her face was capable of almost every shade of  emotion, being sorrowful and pathetic one moment, and brimful of  irrepressible mirth and roguery the next.    There was a silence amongst the girls until Mary Rand shouted:    \"Hip! hip! hurrah!\"    The whole eight immediately broke into a ringing cheer.    \"Welcome, Queen Kathleen,\" they said--\"welcome;\" and they held out their  hands and clasped the hands of the Irish girl.    \"I am glad,\" said Kathleen.    \"What about?\" said Clara Sawyer.    \"Why, you have crowned me queen yourselves. Now I can do what I like  with you all.\"    \"You certainly can,\" said Susy Hopkins.--\"We are devoted to our queen,  aren't we, girls?\"    \"We have fallen in love with her on the spot,\" said Rosy Myers.    \"I never saw any one quite so lovely before as the queen,\" said Mary  Rand.    \"It isn't only that she's lovely, she is so genteel,\" said Susy Hopkins.    \"Aristocratic!\" cried Kate.--\"Hannah Johnson, you haven't given your  opinion yet.--And, Ruth Craven, you haven't given yours.\"    \"I reserve my opinion,\" said Ruth.    \"And I say there's a great deal of humbug and balder-dash in the world,\"  said Hannah Johnson.    Ruth's remark was unexpected, but the girls pooh-poohed Hannah's. Who  was Hannah Johnson that she dared to speak so rudely to one so charming  and beautiful as Kathleen O'Hara? There was a disconcerting pause, and  then Kathleen said:    \"Hannah, doubtless you are right. There is plenty of humbug in the  world; but I don't think I am one. Now the question is: Shall I be on  the side of the foundationers, or shall I be on the side of the paying  girls in the Great Shirley School?\"    \"Indeed, darling,\" said Rosy Myers, \"you shall be on our side. Those  horrid, stuck-up paying girls don't want you; and we do. Nothing will  induce us to give you up. It is a chance to get a girl like you, so  lovely and so sweet and so rich, to be one of us.\"    \"Well, I think I can give you a good time, and I can show those others  with their snobbish ways--\"    \"Hear, hear!\" cried the excited girls.    \"I can show the others what I think of them. They won't snub me, but  perhaps I shall snub them. Well, girls, as we have decided to band  together, we must draw up rules; and when they are drawn up we must obey  them. I, of course, will be your head; as you have made me queen, that  is the natural thing to expect.\"    \"Of course,\" said Susy.    Kathleen clapped her hands.    \"This is going to be a real good secret society,\" she said. \"What fun it  all will be!\"    The girls laughed, and clustered with more and more friendliness round  Kathleen.    \"You are our queen,\" said Kate. \"There are eight of us here, and we all  swear allegiance to you.--Don't we, girls?\"    \"Certainly,\" said Susy.    \"Unquestionably,\" remarked Mary.    \"With all my heart,\" said Rose.    \"And mine,\" echoed Clara.    \"And mine,\" said Kate.    \"I will join the others, although I don't approve,\" said Hannah Johnson,  with a somewhat unwilling nod.    \"And I am neutral. I don't think I ought to join at all,\" said Ruth.    \"Oh, yes, you will, Ruth. I want you to be my Prime Minister, I want you  to be with me in all things.\"    \"I don't know that I can.\"    \"And why should she be your Prime Minister?\" said Kate in an ugly voice.  \"She's no better than the others, and she's very new. Some of us have  been at the school for some time. Ruth Craven has only just joined.    \"The queen must have her way,\" said Kathleen, stamping her foot. \"The  queen must have her way in all particulars, and she wishes to elect Ruth  Craven as her Prime Minister--that is, if Ruth will consent.\"    They were headstrong and big girls, most of them older than Kathleen,  but they submitted, for her ways were masterful and her tone full of  delicate sympathy.    \"I will think it over and let you know,\" said Ruth. \"Of course, I shall  not betray you; but you must please understand that I have friends  amongst the paying girls of the school. Cassandra Weldon is my friend,  and there are others. I will not join nor advocate any plan that annoys  or worries them.\"    The girls looked dubious, and one or two began to speak in discontented  voices.    \"We must meet again in a couple of days,\" said Kathleen finally. \"By  then I shall have drawn up the rules. We can't always meet at night, but  we will when it is possible, for this place is so romantic, and so  correct for a secret society. Those who are present to-night will be in  my Cabinet. I should like if possible to have all the foundation girls  on my side, but that must be decided at our next meeting. I am willing  to purchase a badge for each girl who joins me; it will be made of  silver, and can be worn beneath the dress in the form of a locket.\"    \"Oh, lovely, delicious! There never was such a queen,\" cried Susy  Hopkins.    The little meeting broke up amidst universal applause.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE BOX FROM DUBLIN AND ITS TREASURES.      Kathleen returned quite safely to Myrtle Lodge. Ben was sitting up for  her; he opened the door. The hall was quite dark. He held out his hand  and drew her in.    \"Am not I splendid?\" he said. \"I have been standing here for  half-an-hour, all drenched with perspiration. If mother came down\" what  wouldn't she say? And as to Alice, she'd be even worse. But a sov.'s  worth doing something for. I say! I do feel happy! I never had all that  lot of bullion in the whole course of my life before. Are you right now,  Kathleen--can you slip upstairs without making any noise? Don't forget  that the step just before you reach the upper landing gives a great  creak like the report of a pistol; hop over it on to the landing itself,  and you are safe. Alice is in bed, snoring like anything; I listened  outside the keyhole.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Kathleen. \"I'm awfully obliged to you, Ben. See if I  don't do something for you. You are a broth of a boy. What do you say to  Carrigrohane in the summer, and a gun all to yourself? I'll teach you  how to shoot rabbits and to bring down a bird on the wing.\"    She brushed her lips against his cheek, and ran lightly upstairs. She  escaped the treacherous second step, and entered her bedroom without  waking Alice. The bolster carefully manipulated had done its work; it  had never occurred to Alice that the form in the bed was anything but  the living form of Kathleen O'Hara. She had shaded the light from what  she supposed to be the sleeping girl, and got into bed herself feeling  tired and sulky. She had dropped asleep immediately.    Kathleen's first step, therefore, towards the formation of a secret  society in the Great Shirley School was marked with success. The idea  which she had formulated in the old quarry spread like wildfire amongst  the foundationers; but Kathleen was determined not to have another  meeting for nearly a week. She wished to hear from her father; she  wanted to have money in hand.    \"They are all poor,\" she thought. \"If I appear just as poor as they are,  I shall never be able to keep my exalted position as queen. We cannot  have our next meeting until I have drawn up the rules, and I should like  Ruth Craven to help me. She has got sense. I don't want the thing to be  riotous, nor to do harm in any way. I just want us to have a bit of fun,  and to teach the horrid paying girls of the school a lesson.\"    The thought of her secret society kept Kathleen in a fairly good humor,  and she worked at her lessons so well that Alice began to have hopes of  her. About a week after her arrival at Myrtle Lodge the box which Aunt  Katie O'Flynn was sending from Dublin arrived. It came when the girls  were at school. When they returned to early dinner they saw it standing  in the front hall.    \"Whatever is this, and why is it put here?\" said Alice, springing  forward to look at the address:    \"Miss Kathleen O'Hara, care of Mrs. Tennant, Myrtle Lodge.\"    \"Golloptious!\" cried Kathleen. \"It's my own. It's my clothes--my sort  of a kind of a treasure. Oh, what delicious fun! Now you will see how  smart I can be. Maybe there will be something here to fit you, Alice.  Wouldn't you like it? We are going to tea to-night to Mrs. Weldon's, and  Ruth Craven is to be there. The darling girl--I will give her something.  I should love to make her look just as beautiful as she can look. I am  not a bit a stingy sort of girl; you know that, Alice. I want to be  quite generous with my lovely things.\"    \"Well, do stop talking,\" said Alice. \"I never came across such an  inveterate chatterbox. I suppose you'd like to have the box taken up to  our room; but I don't think you'll have any time to open it at present.  You have promised to come back with me to the school this afternoon, in  order that Miss Spicer may give you a special lesson in music.\"    \"Arrah, then, my dear!\" cried Kathleen, \"it isn't me you'll see at  school again to-day. It's gloating and fussing over my clothes I will  be--portioning out those I mean to give to others, and trying on the  ones that will suit me. You can go to your horrid, stupid lessons if you  like, but it won't be Kathleen O'Hara who will accompany you. Perhaps  the poor tired one would like to have a pleasant afternoon in my  bedroom. Oh, glory be "]]]
