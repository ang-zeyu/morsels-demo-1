The energetic races, those which have advanced  in civilization, live in lands where the  struggle for existence has been continuous.  Necessity is a hard master, but its rule is  indispensable to worthy achievement. The instinct  of self-preservation and the industrious  attitude are responses which the human race  has learned to exercise, in the main, only in  case of need. Self-preservation is the first  law; where life and personal liberty are  dependent upon industry, idleness will not be  found. Wealth removes the obligation to  toil; hence the poor boy often outdistances  his more favored brother.    Individuals work for pay as a means of  <p 138>  self-preservation, and unless that is satisfactory  other motives have but little weight  with them. The needs of the self which preservation  demands are continuously increasing.  The needs of the American-born laborer are  greater than those of the Chinaman. Regardless  of this higher standard of living and  the ever increasing number of ``necessities,''  the instinct of self-preservation acts in connection  with them all.    _Almost without exception the interest of workers  centers in the wage. If they could retain  their accustomed wage with less effort, they would  do so. If the retention and increase depend on  individual production, they will respond to the  compulsion_.    Every student of psychology recognizes the  fact that the wage is more than a means of  self-preservation. Man is a distinctly social  creature. He has a social self as well as an  individual self. His social self demands social  approval as much as his individual self demands  bread, clothing, and shelter. In our  present industrial system this social distinc-  <p 139>  tion is most often indicated by means of monetary  reward. The laborer not only demands  that his toil shall provide the means for self-  preservation, but he seeks through his wages  the social distinction which he feels to be his  due. His desire for increase of wages is often  partly, and in some instances mainly, due to  his craving for distinction or social approval.    In such instances the wage is to be thought  of as something comparable to the score of a  ball player. The desire for a high score is  sufficient motive to beget the most extreme  exertion, even though the reward anticipated  is nothing more than a sign of distinction and  without any relationship whatever to self-  preservation.    In common with some of the lower animals  man has an instinct to collect and hoard all  sorts of things. This instinct is spoken of  in psychology as the hoarding or proprietary  instinct. In performing instinctive acts we  do so with enthusiasm, but blindly. We take  great delight in the performing of the act,  even though the ultimate result of the act  <p 140>  may be entirely unknown to us. The squirrel  collects and stores nuts with great delight and  industry. He has no idea of the approaching  winter, but gathers the nuts simply because  for him it is the most interesting process in his  experience.    Most persons display a like instinctive  tendency to make collections and hoard articles.  This is particularly apparent in collections  of such things as canceled postage  stamps, discarded buttons, pebbles, sticks,  magazines, and other non-useful articles.    When this hoarding instinct is not controlled  by reason or checked by other interests, we  have the miser. In a less degree, we all share  with the miser his hoarding instinct. We all  like to collect money just as the squirrel likes  to gather nuts. The octogenarian continues  to collect money with unabated zeal, even  though he be childless. He is probably not  aware that he is collecting merely for the pleasure  of collecting.    _Since the wage is the means ordinarily employed  to awaken in workers the three instincts_  <p 141>  _of self-preservation, of social distinction, and of  hoarding, it is not strange that an industrial  age should regard it as the chief means of increasing  efficiency_.    The employer has not attempted to discover  what instincts were appealed to by the wage,  or the most economical method of stimulating  these instincts. He has not undervalued the  wage in securing efficiency, but rather has  assumed that the service secured must be in  direct proportion to the amount expended.    Such an assumption is not warranted.  Of two employers with equal forces and payrolls  one may receive much more and better  service than the other. It is not a question  merely of how much is spent but how wisely  it is spent. The wage secures service to the  degree in which it awakens these fundamental  instincts under consideration.    It is apparent, therefore, that other factors  than the amount of money expended in wages  are to be considered by every employer. Without  increasing the pay roll he may increase the  efficiency of his men. The employer who has  <p 142>  determined the number of men he needs and  the wages he must pay has only begun to solve  his labor problem.    In the preparation of the present chapter a  large number of business men were interviewed  personally or by correspondence.    One of the questions asked was: ``How do  you make the most of the wages paid your  men?''    As subsidiary to this general question three  other questions were asked: ``In paying them  do you base the amount to be received by each  man upon a fixed salary? By some of the  men upon actual output--commissions or  piecework rates? By some upon a combination  including profit-sharing or bonus?''    The answers to these latter questions were  not uniform even among employers engaged  apparently in the same business and under  very similar conditions. Some reported that  all the methods suggested were used in their  establishment. Factory hands were employed  on piecework or on a premium or bonus basis  where conditions permitted; office assistants  <p 143>  on fixed salaries; department managers upon  a combination including profit sharing. The  results reported, however, were far from uniform.  The astounding feature was the diversity  of opinion among successful managers  of employees. By various houses one or more  of the systems had been tried under apparently  favorable conditions and had been discarded.  On the other hand each of the systems was  advocated by equally successful business firms.    In judging of the relative merits of fixed  salaries as compared with other methods the  experiences of individual firms offer no certain  data. The relative merits and demerits  are best disclosed by a psychological analysis  of the manner in which the various devices  appeal to the employee's instincts and reason.    _When wages are based on commission, piece  rate, or a bonus or premium system, the stimulus  to action is constantly present. Every stroke  of the hammer, every sale made, every figure  added, increases the wage. The wage thus continuously  beckons the worker to greater accomplishment_.  <p 144>    All other considerations lose in importance,  and the mind becomes focused on output.  The worker is blinded to all other motives,  and invariably sacrifices quality unless this  be guarded by rigid inspection. The piecework  or task system thus influences the worker  directly and incessantly without regard for  the particular instinct to which it may be appealing.  Every increase in rate adds directly  to the means of self-preservation, of social  distinction, and of the accumulation of  wealth.    _The worker with a fixed salary or wage does  not feel as continuously the goad of his wage.  It is less in mind and does not control his attitude  toward his work. The man on a fixed  salary, therefore, will not produce so much_.    If he be a workman, he may take better  care of his tools, keep his output up to a higher  standard of quality, prepare himself for more  responsible positions. If he be a salesman, he  may be more considerate of his customers and  hence really more valuable to his employer;  he may be more loyal to the house and hence  <p 145>  promote the ``team work'' of the organization,  and he may because of his more receptive state  of mind be preparing himself for much greater  usefulness to his house. If he be a superintendent,  he may be more thoughtful of his  men, or more scrupulous for the future of the  business.    Production methods or labor conditions  are often such that piecework is impossible.  There are many functions and processes which  thus far have not been satisfactorily adjusted  to task systems; there are others (the inspection  service in a factory, for instance) where a  premium on increased output would defeat  the first purpose of the service. Where results  can be accurately measured, however, and the  quality of the service can be automatically  secured or is not sacrificed by concentration  upon quantity, the task system--whether  it take the form of piece rates, premiums, or  bonus--has such superior psychological advantages  that it will probably come more and  more into use.    Under the general heading quoted above--  <p 146>    ``How do you make the most of the wages  paid your employees?''--the following question  was asked: ``What special method do  you employ to make men satisfied or pleased  with their wages?'' The answers were most  interesting and instructive. One manager  having many thousand men in his organization  narrated various methods by which he  kept in personal touch with his men, and  turned this personal relationship to the advantage  of the house.    One illustration will make clear the line he  pursued. In the card catalogue of the employees,  the birthday of each is noted, the  executive recognizing that for the average  man this is an anniversary even more important  than New Year's.    _If for any reason a member of the organization  deserves or requires the executive's personal attention,  his birthday may be chosen as"]]]
