An' she's sure interested in thet pack of hounds.\"    Belllounds trudged away, his fine old head erect, his gray hair shining  in the sun.    Wade sat down upon the step of his cabin, pondering over the rancher's  remarks about his son. Recalling the young man's physiognomy, Wade began  to feel that it was familiar to him. He had seen Jack Belllounds before.  Wade never made mistakes in faces, though he often had a task to recall  names. And he began to go over the recent past, recalling all that he  could remember of Meeker, and Cripple Creek, where he had worked for  several months, and so on, until he had gone back as far as his last  trip to Denver.    \"Must have been there,\" mused Wade, thoughtfully, and he tried to recall  all the faces he had seen. This was impossible, of course, yet he  remembered many. Then he visualized the places in Denver that for one  reason or another had struck him particularly. Suddenly into one of  these flashed the pale, sullen, bold face of Jack Belllounds.    \"It was _there!_\" he exclaimed, incredulously. \"Well!... If thet's not  the strangest yet! Could I be mistaken? No. I saw him.... Belllounds  must have known it--must have let him stay there.... Maybe put him  there! He's just the kind of a man to go to extremes to reform his son.\"    Singular as was this circumstance, Wade dwelt only momentarily on it. He  dismissed it with the conviction that it was another strange happening  in the string of events that had turned his steps toward White Slides  Ranch. Wade's mind stirred to the probability of an early sight of  Columbine Belllounds. He would welcome it, both as interesting and  pleasurable, and surely as a relief. The sooner a meeting with her was  over the better. His life had been one long succession of shocks, so  that it seemed nothing the future held could thrill him, amaze him,  torment him. And yet how well he knew that his heart was only the more  responsive for all it had withstood! Perhaps here at White Slides he  might meet with an experience dwarfing all others. It was possible; it  was in the nature of events. And though he repudiated such a  possibility, he fortified himself against a subtle divination that he  might at last have reached the end of his long trail, where anything  might happen.    Three of the hounds lay down at Wade's feet. Kane, the bloodhound, stood  watching this new master, after the manner of a dog who was a judge of  men. He sniffed at Wade. He grew a little less surly.    Wade's gaze, however, was on the path that led down along the border of  the brook to disappear in the willows. Above this clump of yellowing  trees could be seen the ranch-house. A girl with fair hair stepped off  the porch. She appeared to be carrying something in her arms, and  shortly disappeared behind the willows. Wade saw her and surmised that  she was coming to his cabin. He did not expect any more or think any  more. His faculties condensed to the objective one of sight.    The girl, when she reappeared, was perhaps a hundred yards distant. Wade  bent on her one keen, clear glance. Then his brain and his blood beat  wildly. He saw a slender girl in riding-costume, lithe and strong, with  the free step of one used to the open. It was this form, this step that  struck Wade. \"My--God! how like Lucy!\" he whispered, and he tried to  pierce the distance to see her face. It gleamed in the sunshine. Her  fair hair waved in the wind. She was coming, but so slowly! All of Wade  that was physical and emotional seemed to wait--clamped. The moment was  age-long, with nothing beyond it. While she was still at a distance her  face became distinct. And Wade sustained a terrible shock.... Then, as  one in a dream, as in a blur of strained peering into a maze, he saw the  face of his sweetheart, his wife, the Lucy of his early manhood. It  moved him out of the past. Closer! Pang on pang quivered in his heart.  Was this only a nightmare? Or had he at last gone mad! This girl raised  her head. She was looking--she saw him. Terror mounted upon Wade's  consciousness.    \"That's Lucy's face!\" he gasped. \"So help--me, God!... It's for this--I  wandered here! She's my flesh an' blood--my Lucy's child--my own!\"    Fear and presentiment and blank amaze and stricken consciousness left  him in the lightning-flash of divination that was recognition as well. A  shuddering cataclysm enveloped him, a passion so stupendous that it  almost brought oblivion.    The three hounds leaped up with barks and wagging tails. They welcomed  this visitor. Kane lost still more of his canine aloofness.    Wade's breast heaved. The blue sky, the gray hills, the green willows,  all blurred in his sight, that seemed to hold clear only the face  floating closer.    \"I'm Columbine Belllounds,\" said a voice.    It stilled the storm in Wade. It was real. It was a voice of twenty  years ago. The burden on his breast lifted. Then flashed the spirit, the  old self-control of a man whose life had held many terrible moments.    \"Mornin', miss. I'm glad to meet you,\" he replied, and there was no  break, no tone unnatural in his greeting.    So they gazed at each other, she with that instinctive look peculiar to  women in its intuitive powers, but common to all persons who had lived  far from crowds and to whom a new-comer was an event. Wade's gaze,  intense and all-embracing, found that face now closer in resemblance to  the imagined Lucy's--a pretty face, rather than beautiful, but strong  and sweet--its striking qualities being a colorless fairness of skin  that yet held a rose and golden tint, and the eyes of a rare and  exquisite shade of blue.    \"Oh! Are you feeling ill?\" she asked. \"You look so--so pale.\"    \"No. I'm only tuckered out,\" replied Wade, easily, as he wiped the  clammy drops from his brow. \"It was a long ride to get here.\"    \"I'm the lady of the house,\" she said, with a smile. \"I'm glad to  welcome you to White Slides, and hope you'll like it.\"    \"Well, Miss Columbine, I reckon I will,\" he replied, returning the  smile. \"Now if I was younger I'd like it powerful much.\"    She laughed at that. \"Men are all alike, young or old.\"    \"Don't ever think so,\" said Wade, earnestly.    \"No? I guess you're right about that. I've fetched you up some things  for your cabin. May I peep in?\"    \"Come in,\" replied Wade, rising. \"You must excuse my manners. It's long  indeed since I had a lady caller.\"    She went in, and Wade, standing on the threshold, saw her survey the  room with a woman's sweeping glance.    \"I told dad to put some--\"    \"Miss, your dad told me to go get them, an' I've not done it yet. But I  will presently.\"    \"Very well. I'll leave these things and come back later,\" she replied,  depositing a bundle upon the floor. \"You won't mind if I try to--to make  you a little comfortable. It's dreadful the way outdoor men live when  they do get indoors.\"    \"I reckon I'll be slow in lettin' you see what a good housekeeper I am,\"  he replied. \"Because then, maybe, I'll see more of you.\"    \"Weren't you a sad flatterer in your day?\" she queried, archly.    Her intonation, the tilt of her head, gave Wade such a pang that he  could not answer. And to hide his momentary restraint he turned back to  the hounds. Then she came out upon the porch.    \"I love hounds,\" she said, patting Denver, which caress immediately made  Jim and Sampson jealous. \"I've gotten on pretty well with these, but  that Kane won't make up. Isn't he splendid? But he's afraid--no, not  afraid of me, but he doesn't like me.\"    \"It's mistrust. He's been hurt. I reckon he'll get over that after a  while.\"    \"You don't beat dogs?\" she asked, eagerly.    \"No, miss. That's not the way to get on with hounds or horses.\"    Her glance was a blue flash of pleasure.    \"How glad that makes me! Why, I quit coming here to see and feed the  dogs because somebody was always kicking them around.\"    Wade handed the rope to her. \"You hold them, so when I come out with  some meat they won't pile over me.\" He went inside, took all that was  left of the deer haunch out of his pack, and, picking up his knife,  returned to the porch. The hounds saw the meat and yelped. They pulled  on the rope.    \"You hounds behave,\" ordered Wade, as he sat down on the step and began  to cut the meat. \"Jim, you're the oldest an' hungriest. Here.... Now  you, Sampson. Here!\"... The big hound snapped at the meat. Whereupon  Wade slapped him. \"Are you a pup or a wolf that you grab for it? Here.\"  Sampson was slower to act, but he snapped again. Whereupon Wade hit him  again, with open hand, not with violence or rancor, but a blow that  meant Sampson must obey.    Next time the hound did not snap. Denver had to be cuffed several times  before he showed deference to this new master. But the bloodhound Kane  refused to take any meat out of Wade's hand. He growled and showed his  teeth, and sniffed hungrily.    \"Kane will have to be handled carefully,\" observed Wade. \"He'd bite  pretty quick.\"    \"But, he's so splendid,\" said the girl. \"I don't like to think he's  mean. You'll be good to him--try to win him?\"    \"I'll do my best with him.\"    \"Dad's full of glee that he has a real hunter at White Slides at last.  Now I'm glad, and sorry, too. I hate to think of little calves being  torn and killed by lions and wolves. And it's dreadful to know bears eat  grown-up cattle. But I love the mourn of a wolf and the yelp of a  coyote. I can't help hoping you don't kill them all--quite.\"    \"It's not likely, miss,\" he replied. \"I'll be pretty sure to clean out  the lions an' drive off the bears. But the wolf family can't be  exterminated. No animal so cunnin' as a wolf!... I'll tell you.... Some  years ago I went to cook on a ranch north of Denver, on the edge of the  plains. An' right off I began to hear stories about a big lobo--a wolf  that was an old residenter. He'd been known for long, an' he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13941"],[0,"The Divine Right of Church Government (#15)"],[1,"there is a ministerial, derivative, subordinate  power, which the Scripture declares to be in church guides, Matt. xvi.  19, and xviii. 18; John xx. 21, 23; Matt, xxviii. 19, 20; 2 Cor. x. 8,  and xiii. 10, and often elsewhere this is abundantly testified. But  whence is this power originally derived to them? Here we are carefully  to consider and distinguish three things, touching this power or  authority from one another, viz: 1st. The donation of the authority  itself, and of the offices whereunto this power doth properly belong.  2d. The designation of particular persons to such offices as are vested  with such power. 3d. The public protection, countenancing, authorizing,  defending, and maintaining of such officers in the public exercise of  such power within such and such realms or dominions. This being  premised, we may clearly thus resolve, according to scripture warrant,  viz. the designation or setting apart of particular individual persons  to those offices in the Church that have power and authority engraven  upon them, is from the church nominating, electing, and ordaining of  such persons thereunto, see Acts iii. 1-3; 1 Tim. iv. 14, and v. 22;  Tit. i. 5; Acts iv. 22. The public protection, defence, maintenance,  &c., of such officers in the public exercise of the power and authority  of their office in such or such dominions, is from the civil magistrate,  as the _nursing-father_ of the Church, Isa. xlix. 23; for it is by his  authority and sanction that such public places shall be set apart for  the public ministry, that such maintenance and reward shall be legally  performed for such a ministry, that all such persons of such and such  congregations shall be (in case they neglect their duty to such a  ministry) punished with such political penalties, &c. But the donation  of the office and spiritual authority annexed thereunto, is only derived  from Jesus Christ our Mediator. He alone gives all church officers, and  therefore none may devise or superadd any new officers, Eph. iv. 7, 8,  10, 11; 1 Cor. xii. 28. And he alone commits all authority and power  spiritual to those officers, for dispensing of word, sacraments,  censures, and all ordinances, Matt. xvi. 19, and xxviii. 18-20; John xx.  21-23; 2 Cor. x. 8, and xiii. 10: and therefore it is not safe for any  creature to intrude upon this prerogative royal of Christ to give any  power to any officer of the Church. None can give what he has not.          CHAPTER VII.    _Of the several Parts or Acts of this power of Church Government,  wherein it puts forth itself in the Church._      Thus far of the special kind or peculiar nature of this authority; now  to the several parts or acts of this power which the description  comprehends in these expressions, (in dispensing the word, seals,  censures, and all other ordinances of Christ.) The evangelical  ordinances which Christ has set up in his church are many; and all of  them by divine right that Christ sets up. Take both the enumeration of  ordinances and the divine right thereof severally, as followeth.    Jesus Christ our Mediator hath instituted and appointed these ensuing  administrations to be standing and perpetual ordinances in his church:  which ordinances for method sake may be reduced into two heads,  according to the distribution of the keys formerly laid down, (chap.  III.,) viz., ordinances appertaining, 1st, To the key of order or of  doctrine; 2d, To the key of jurisdiction or of discipline.    1. Ordinances appertaining to the key of order or doctrine, viz:    1. Public prayer and thanksgiving are divine ordinances: for 1st, Paul  writing his first epistle to Timothy, \"that he might know how to behave  himself in the house of God,\" 1 Tim. iii. 14, 15, among other directions  in that epistle, gives this for one, \"I exhort therefore that first of  all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made  for all men,\" 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2, \"for this is good and acceptable in the  sight of God our Saviour,\" verse 3. 2. The apostle, regulating public  prayers in the congregation, directing that they should be performed  with the understanding, takes it for granted that public prayer was an  ordinance of Christ. \"If I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth,  but my understanding is unfruitful. What is it then? I will pray with  the spirit, and will pray with the understanding also. Else when thou  shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the  unlearned, say amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not  what thou sayest? for thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is  not edified.\" 1 Cor. xiv. 14-17. 3. Further, the apostles did account  public prayer to be of more concern than serving of tables, and  providing for the necessities of the poor, yea, to be a principal part  of their ministerial office, and therefore resolve to addict and \"give  themselves to the ministry of the word and to prayer,\" Acts vi. 4; and  this was the church's practice in the purest times, Acts i. 13, 14,  whose pious action is for our imitation. 4. And Jesus Christ hath made  gracious promises to public prayer, viz., of his presence with those who  assemble in his name; and of audience of their prayers, Matt, xviii. 19,  20. Would Christ so crown public prayer were it not his own ordinance?    2. Singing of psalms is a divine ordinance, being,    1. Prescribed; \"be filled with the spirit: speaking to yourselves in  psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs,\" Eph. v. 18, 19. \"Let the word  of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing  one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs,\" Col. iii. 16.    2. Regulated; the right performance thereof being laid down, \"I will  sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also,\" 1  Cor. xiv. 15, 16. \"Singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord,\" Col.  iii. 16. \"Singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord,\" Eph. v.  19.    3. The public ministry of the word of God in the congregation is a  divine ordinance. \"We will give ourselves,\" said the apostles, \"to the  ministry of the word and prayer,\" Acts vi. 4. The ministry of the word  is a sacred ordinance, whether read, preached, or catechetically  propounded.    1. The public reading of the word is a divine ordinance, (though  exposition of what is read do not always immediately follow.) For, 1.  God commanded the reading of the word publicly, and never since repealed  that command, Deut. xxxi. 11-13; Jer. xxxvi. 6; Col. iii. 16. 2. Public  reading of the scriptures hath been the practice of God's church, both  before Christ, Exod. xxiv. 7; Neh. viii. 18, and ix. 3, and xiii. 1; and  after Christ, Acts xiii. 15, 27, and xv. 21; 2 Cor. iii. 14. 3. Public  reading of the scriptures is as necessary and profitable now as ever it  was. See Deut. xxxi. 11-13.    2. The public preaching of the word is an eminent ordinance of Christ.  This is evident many ways, viz:    1. Christ hath commanded that the word shall be preached. \"Go ye into  all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature,\" Mark xvi. 15.  \"Go ye, therefore, and disciple ye all nations; teaching them to observe  all things whatsoever I have commanded you,\" Matt, xxviii. 19, 20. \"As  ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand,\" Matt. x. 7.  See also Mark iii. 14. \"I charge thee,\" &c. \"Preach the word,\" 2 Tim.  iv. 1, 2. \"Necessity is laid upon me, yea, wo is unto me if I preach not  the gospel,\" 1 Cor. ix. 16, 17. \"Christ sent me--to preach the gospel,\"  1 Cor. i. 17; with which compare also Acts xx. 28, and 1 Pet. v. 1-4.    2. Christ hath appointed who shall preach the word. \"How shall they  preach except they be sent?\" Rom. x. 15. The qualifications of preaching  elders see in 1 Tim. iii. 2-8, and Tit. i. 5-9.    3. Christ hath appointed how the word shall be preached. \"Be instant, in  season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering  and doctrine,\" 2 Tim. iv. 2. \"That he may be able by sound doctrine  both to exhort and convince gainsayers,\" Tit. i. 9. \"He that hath my  word, let him speak my word faithfully: what is the chaff to the wheat,  saith the Lord?\" Jer. xxiii. 28.    4. Christ hath made many encouraging promises to the preaching of his  word, which he would not have done, were it not his own ordinance.  \"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you,  and lo I am with you every day to the end of the world,\" Matt, xxviii.  20. \"Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and  whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven,\" Matt.  xvi. 19, and xviii. 18. \"Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted  unto them: and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained,\" John xx.  23. Both these are partly meant of doctrinal binding and loosing,  remitting and retaining. \"Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy  peace: for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee,  for I have much people in this city,\" Acts xviii. 9, 10.    3. The catechetical propounding or expounding of the word, viz. a plain,  familiar laying down of the first principles of the oracles of God, is  an ordinance of Christ also. For, 1. This was the apostolical way of  teaching the churches at the first plantation thereof. \"When for the  time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again  which be the first principles of the oracles of God, and are become such  as have need of milk and not of strong meat,\" Heb. v. 12. \"Therefore,  leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on unto  perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead  works, and of faith towards God,\" &c., Heb. vi. 1,2. \"And I, brethren,  could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto  babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat, for  hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able,\" 1  Cor."]]]
