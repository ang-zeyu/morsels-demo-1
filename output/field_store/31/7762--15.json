And when we waked there was a great wind and rain upon the island.          X    The Light in the Weed      Now the wind was very violent from the sea, and threatened to blow down  our tent, the which, indeed, it achieved at last as we made an end of a  cheerless breakfast. Yet, the bo'sun bade us not trouble to put it up  again; but spread it out with the edges raised upon props made from the  reeds, so that we might catch some of the rainwater; for it was become  imperative that we should renew our supply before putting out again to  sea. And whilst some of us were busied about this, he took the others and  set up a small tent made of the spare canvas, and under this he sheltered  all of our matters like to be harmed by the rain.    In a little, the rain continuing very violent, we had near a breaker-full  of water collected in the canvas, and were about to run it off into one  of the breakers, when the bo'sun cried out to us to hold, and first taste  the water before we mixed it with that which we had already. At that, we  put down our hands and scooped up some of the water to taste, and thus we  discovered it to be brackish and quite undrinkable, at which I was  amazed, until the bo'sun reminded us that the canvas had been saturated  for many days with salt water, so that it would take a great quantity of  fresh before all the salt was washed out. Then he told us to lay it flat  upon the beach, and scour it well on both sides with the sand, which we  did, and afterwards let the rain rinse it well, whereupon the next water  that we caught we found to be near fresh; though not sufficiently so for  our purpose. Yet when we had rinsed it once more, it became clear of the  salt, so that we were able to keep all that we caught further.    And then, something before noon, the rain ceased to fall, though coming  again at odd times in short squalls; yet the wind died not, but blew  steadily, and continued so from that quarter during the remainder of the  time that we were upon the island.    Upon the ceasing of the rain, the bo'sun called us all together, that we  might make a decent burial of the unfortunate lad, whose remains had lain  during the night upon one of the bottom-boards of the boat. After a  little discussion, it was decided to bury him in the beach; for the only  part where there was soft earth was in the valley, and none of us had a  stomach for that place. Moreover, the sand was soft and easy to dig, and  as we had no proper tools, this was a great consideration. Presently,  using the bottom-boards and the oars and the hatchet, we had a place  large and deep enough to hold the boy, and into this we placed him. We  made no prayer over him; but stood about the grave for a little space, in  silence. Then, the bo'sun signed to us to fill in the sand; and,  therewith, we covered up the poor lad, and left him to his sleep.    And, presently, we made our dinner, after which the bo'sun served out to  each one of us a very sound tot of the rum; for he was minded to bring us  back again to a cheerful state of mind.    After we had sat awhile, smoking, the bo'sun divided us into two  parties to make a search through the island among the rocks, perchance  we should find water, collected from the rain, among the hollows and  crevasses; for though we had gotten some, through our device with the  sail, yet we had by no means caught sufficient for our needs. He was  especially anxious for haste, in that the sun had come out again; for he  was feared that such small pools as we should find would be speedily  dried up by its heat.    Now the bo'sun headed one party, and set the big seaman over the other,  bidding all to keep their weapons very handy. Then he set out to the  rocks about the base of the nearer hill, sending the others to the  farther and greater one, and in each party we carried an empty breaker  slung from a couple of the stout reeds, so that we might put all such  driblets as we should find, straight away into it, before they had time  to vanish into the hot air; and for the purpose of bailing up the water,  we had brought with us our tin pannikins, and one of the boat's bailers.    In a while, and after much scrambling amid the rocks, we came upon a  little pool of water that was remarkably sweet and fresh, and from this  we removed near three gallons before it became dry; and after that we  came across, maybe, five or six others; but not one of them near so big  as the first; yet we were not displeased; for we had near three parts  filled the breaker, and so we made back to the camp, having some wonder  as to the luck of the other party.    When we came near the camp, we found the others returned before us, and  seeming in a very high content with themselves; so that we had no need to  call to them as to whether they had filled their breaker. When they saw  us, they set out to us at a run to tell us that they had come upon a  great basin of fresh water in a deep hollow a third of the distance up  the side of the far hill, and at this the bo'sun bade us put down our  breaker and make all of us to the hill, so that he might examine for  himself whether their news was so good as it seemed.    Presently, being guided by the other party, we passed around to the back  of the far hill, and discovered it to go upward to the top at an easy  slope, with many ledges and broken places, so that it was scarce more  difficult than a stair to climb. And so, having climbed perhaps ninety or  a hundred feet, we came suddenly upon the place which held the water, and  found that they had not made too much of their discovery; for the pool  was near twenty feet long by twelve broad, and so clear as though it had  come from a fountain; yet it had considerable depth, as we discovered by  thrusting a spear shaft down into it.    Now the bo'sun, having seen for himself how good a supply of water there  was for our needs, seemed very much relieved in his mind, and declared  that within three days at the most we might leave the island, at which we  felt none of us any regret. Indeed, had the boat escaped harm, we had  been able to leave that same day; but this could not be; for there was  much to be done before we had her seaworthy again.    Having waited until the bo'sun had made complete his examination, we  turned to descend, thinking that this would be the bo'sun's intention;  but he called to us to stay, and, looking back, we saw that he made to  finish the ascent of the hill. At that, we hastened to follow him; though  we had no notion of his reason for going higher. Presently, we were come  to the top, and here we found a very spacious place, nicely level save  that in one or two parts it was crossed by deepish cracks, maybe half a  foot to a foot wide, and perhaps three to six fathoms long; but, apart  from these and some great boulders, it was, as I have mentioned, a  spacious place; moreover it was bone dry and pleasantly firm under one's  feet, after so long upon the sand.    I think, even thus early, I had some notion of the bo'sun's design; for  I went to the edge that overlooked the valley, and peered down, and,  finding it nigh a sheer precipice, found myself nodding my head, as  though it were in accordance with some part formed wish. Presently,  looking about me, I discovered the bo'sun to be surveying that part which  looked over towards the weed, and I made across to join him. Here, again,  I saw that the hill fell away very sheer, and after that we went across  to the seaward edge, and there it was near as abrupt as on the weed side.    Then, having by this time thought a little upon the matter, I put it  straight to the bo'sun that here would make indeed a very secure camping  place, with nothing to come at us upon our sides or back; and our front,  where was the slope, could be watched with ease. And this I put to him  with great warmth; for I was mortally in dread of the coming night.    Now when I had made an end of speaking, the bo'sun disclosed to me that  this was, as I had suspicion, his intent, and immediately he called to  the men that we should haste down, and ship our camp to the top of the  hill. At that, the men expressed their approbation, and we made haste  every one of us to the camp, and began straightway to move our gear to  the hilltop.    In the meanwhile, the bo'sun, taking me to assist him, set-to again upon  the boat, being intent to get his batten nicely shaped and fit to the  side of the keel, so that it would bed well to the keel, but more  particularly to the plank which had sprung outward from its place. And at  this he labored the greater part of that afternoon, using the little  hatchet to shape the wood, which he did with surprising skill; yet when  the evening was come, he had not brought it to his liking. But it must  not be thought that he did naught but work at the boat; for he had the  men to direct, and once he had to make his way to the top of the hill to  fix the place for the tent. And after the tent was up, he set them to  carry the dry weed to the new camp, and at this he kept them until near  dusk; for he had vowed never again to be without a sufficiency of fuel.  But two of the men he sent to collect shell-fish--putting two of them to  the task, because he would not have one alone upon the island, not  knowing but that there might be danger, even though it were bright day;  and a most happy ruling it proved; for, a little past the middle of the  afternoon, we heard them shouting at the other end of the valley, and,  not knowing but that they were in need of assistance, we ran with all  haste to discover the reason of their calling, passing along the  right-hand side of the blackened and sodden vale. Upon reaching the  further beach, we saw a most incredible sight; for the two men were  running towards us through the thick masses of the weed, while, no more  than four or five fathoms behind, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10554"],[0,"Right Ho, Jeeves (#15)"],[1," straight. Start off with the glimmering  landscape.\"    \"Stars God's daisy chain.\"    \"Twilight makes you feel sad.\"    \"Because mine lonely life.\"    \"Describe life.\"    \"Talk about the day I met her.\"    \"Add fairy-princess gag. Say there's something you want to say to her.  Heave a couple of sighs. Grab her hand. And give her the works. Right.\"    And confident that he had grasped the scenario and that everything might  now be expected to proceed through the proper channels, I picked up the  feet and hastened back to the house.    It was not until I had reached the drawing-room and was enabled to take a  square look at the Bassett that I found the debonair gaiety with which I  had embarked on this affair beginning to wane a trifle. Beholding her at  close range like this, I suddenly became cognisant of what I was in for.  The thought of strolling with this rummy specimen undeniably gave me a  most unpleasant sinking feeling. I could not but remember how often, when  in her company at Cannes, I had gazed dumbly at her, wishing that some  kindly motorist in a racing car would ease the situation by coming along  and ramming her amidships. As I have already made abundantly clear, this  girl was not one of my most congenial buddies.    However, a Wooster's word is his bond. Woosters may quail, but they do  not edge out. Only the keenest ear could have detected the tremor in the  voice as I asked her if she would care to come out for half an hour.    \"Lovely evening,\" I said.    \"Yes, lovely, isn't it?\"    \"Lovely. Reminds me of Cannes.\"    \"How lovely the evenings were there!\"    \"Lovely,\" I said.    \"Lovely,\" said the Bassett.    \"Lovely,\" I agreed.    That completed the weather and news bulletin for the French Riviera.  Another minute, and we were out in the great open spaces, she cooing a  bit about the scenery, and self replying, \"Oh, rather, quite,\" and  wondering how best to approach the matter in hand.        -10-      How different it all would have been, I could not but reflect, if this  girl had been the sort of girl one chirrups cheerily to over the  telephone and takes for spins in the old two-seater. In that case, I  would simply have said, \"Listen,\" and she would have said, \"What?\" and I  would have said, \"You know Gussie Fink-Nottle,\" and she would have said,  \"Yes,\" and I would have said, \"He loves you,\" and she would have said  either, \"What, that mutt? Well, thank heaven for one good laugh today,\"  or else, in more passionate vein, \"Hot dog! Tell me more.\"    I mean to say, in either event the whole thing over and done with in  under a minute.    But with the Bassett something less snappy and a good deal more glutinous  was obviously indicated. What with all this daylight-saving stuff, we had  hit the great open spaces at a moment when twilight had not yet begun to  cheese it in favour of the shades of night. There was a fag-end of sunset  still functioning. Stars were beginning to peep out, bats were fooling  round, the garden was full of the aroma of those niffy white flowers  which only start to put in their heavy work at the end of the day--in  short, the glimmering landscape was fading on the sight and all the air  held a solemn stillness, and it was plain that this was having the worst  effect on her. Her eyes were enlarged, and her whole map a good deal too  suggestive of the soul's awakening for comfort.    Her aspect was that of a girl who was expecting something fairly fruity  from Bertram.    In these circs., conversation inevitably flagged a bit. I am never at my  best when the situation seems to call for a certain soupiness, and I've  heard other members of the Drones say the same thing about themselves. I  remember Pongo Twistleton telling me that he was out in a gondola with a  girl by moonlight once, and the only time he spoke was to tell her that  old story about the chap who was so good at swimming that they made him a  traffic cop in Venice.    Fell rather flat, he assured me, and it wasn't much later when the girl  said she thought it was getting a little chilly and how about pushing  back to the hotel.    So now, as I say, the talk rather hung fire. It had been all very well  for me to promise Gussie that I would cut loose to this girl about aching  hearts, but you want a cue for that sort of thing. And when, toddling  along, we reached the edge of the lake and she finally spoke, conceive my  chagrin when I discovered that what she was talking about was stars.    Not a bit of good to me.    \"Oh, look,\" she said. She was a confirmed Oh-looker. I had noticed this  at Cannes, where she had drawn my attention in this manner on various  occasions to such diverse objects as a French actress, a Provencal  filling station, the sunset over the Estorels, Michael Arlen, a man  selling coloured spectacles, the deep velvet blue of the Mediterranean,  and the late mayor of New York in a striped one-piece bathing suit. \"Oh,  look at that sweet little star up there all by itself.\"    I saw the one she meant, a little chap operating in a detached sort of  way above a spinney.    \"Yes,\" I said.    \"I wonder if it feels lonely.\"    \"Oh, I shouldn't think so.\"    \"A fairy must have been crying.\"    \"Eh?\"    \"Don't you remember? 'Every time a fairy sheds a tear, a wee bit star is  born in the Milky Way.' Have you ever thought that, Mr. Wooster?\"    I never had. Most improbable, I considered, and it didn't seem to me to  check up with her statement that the stars were God's daisy chain. I  mean, you can't have it both ways.    However, I was in no mood to dissect and criticize. I saw that I had been  wrong in supposing that the stars were not germane to the issue. Quite a  decent cue they had provided, and I leaped on it Promptly: \"Talking of  shedding tears----\"    But she was now on the subject of rabbits, several of which were messing  about in the park to our right.    \"Oh, look. The little bunnies!\"    \"Talking of shedding tears----\"    \"Don't you love this time of the evening, Mr. Wooster, when the sun has  gone to bed and all the bunnies come out to have their little suppers?  When I was a child, I used to think that rabbits were gnomes, and that if  I held my breath and stayed quite still, I should see the fairy queen.\"    Indicating with a reserved gesture that this was just the sort of loony  thing I should have expected her to think as a child, I returned to the  point.    \"Talking of shedding tears,\" I said firmly, \"it may interest you to know  that there is an aching heart in Brinkley Court.\"    This held her. She cheesed the rabbit theme. Her face, which had been  aglow with what I supposed was a pretty animation, clouded. She unshipped  a sigh that sounded like the wind going out of a rubber duck.    \"Ah, yes. Life is very sad, isn't it?\"    \"It is for some people. This aching heart, for instance.\"    \"Those wistful eyes of hers! Drenched irises. And they used to dance like  elves of delight. And all through a foolish misunderstanding about a  shark. What a tragedy misunderstandings are. That pretty romance broken  and over just because Mr. Glossop would insist that it was a flatfish.\"    I saw that she had got the wires crossed.    \"I'm not talking about Angela.\"    \"But her heart is aching.\"    \"I know it's aching. But so is somebody else's.\"    She looked at me, perplexed.    \"Somebody else? Mr. Glossop's, you mean?\"    \"No, I don't.\"    \"Mrs. Travers's?\"    The exquisite code of politeness of the Woosters prevented me clipping  her one on the ear-hole, but I would have given a shilling to be able to  do it. There seemed to me something deliberately fat-headed in the way  she persisted in missing the gist.    \"No, not Aunt Dahlia's, either.\"    \"I'm sure she is dreadfully upset.\"    \"Quite. But this heart I'm talking about isn't aching because of Tuppy's  row with Angela. It's aching for a different reason altogether. I mean to  say--dash it, you know why hearts ache!\"    She seemed to shimmy a bit. Her voice, when she spoke, was whispery: \"You  mean--for love?\"    \"Absolutely. Right on the bull's-eye. For love.\"    \"Oh, Mr. Wooster!\"    \"I take it you believe in love at first sight?\"    \"I do, indeed.\"    \"Well, that's what happened to this aching heart. It fell in love at  first sight, and ever since it's been eating itself out, as I believe the  expression is.\"    There was a silence. She had turned away and was watching a duck out on  the lake. It was tucking into weeds, a thing I've never been able to  understand anyone wanting to do. Though I suppose, if you face it  squarely, they're no worse than spinach. She stood drinking it in for a  bit, and then it suddenly stood on its head and disappeared, and this  seemed to break the spell.    \"Oh, Mr. Wooster!\" she said again, and from the tone of her voice, I  could see that I had got her going.    \"For you, I mean to say,\" I proceeded, starting to put in the fancy  touches. I dare say you have noticed on these occasions that the  difficulty is to plant the main idea, to get the general outline of the  thing well fixed. The rest is mere detail work. I don't say I became glib  at this juncture, but I certainly became a dashed glibber than I had  been.    \"It's having the dickens of a time. Can't eat, can't sleep--all for love  of you. And what makes it all so particularly rotten is that it--this  aching heart--can't bring itself up to the scratch and tell you the  position of affairs, because your profile has gone and given it cold  feet. Just as it is about to speak, it catches sight of you sideways, and  words fail it. Silly, of course, but there it is.\"    I heard her give a gulp, and I saw that her eyes had become moistish.  Drenched irises, if you care to put it that way.    \"Lend you a handkerchief?\"    \"No, thank you. I'm quite all right.\"    It was more than I could say for myself. My efforts had left me weak. I  don't know if you suffer in the same way, but with me the act of talking  anything in the nature of real "]]]
