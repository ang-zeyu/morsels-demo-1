These subjects occupied at  this time the attention of many Quaker families, and among others, that of  a few individuals, who were in close intimacy with each other. These, when  they met together, frequently conversed upon them. They perceived, as facts  came out in conversation, that there was a growing knowledge and hatred of  the Slave-trade, and that the temper of the times was ripening towards its  abolition. Hence a disposition manifested itself among these, to unite as  labourers for the furtherance of so desirable an object. An union was at  length proposed and approved of, and the following persons (placed in  alphabetical order) came together to execute the offices growing out of it:      William Dillwyn,     Thomas Knowles, M.D.    George Harrison,     John Lloyd,    Samuel Hoare,        Joseph Woods.    [Footnote A: The Quakers, as a public body, kept the subject alive at their  yearly meeting in 1784, 1785, 1787, &c.]    The first meeting was held on the seventh of July, 1783. At this \"they  assembled to consider what steps they should take for the relief and  liberation of the Negro slaves in the West Indies, and for the  discouragement of the Slave-trade on the coast of Africa.\"    To promote this object they conceived it necessary that the public mind  should be enlightened respecting it. They had recourse therefore to the  public papers, and they appointed their members in turn to write in these,  and to see that their productions were inserted. They kept regular minutes  for this purpose. It was not however known to the world that such an  association existed.    It appears that they had several meetings in the course of this year.  Before the close of it they had secured a place in the General Evening  Post, in Lloyd's Evening Post, in the Norwich, Bath, York, Bristol,  Sherborne, Liverpool, Newcastle, and other provincial papers, for such  articles as they chose to send to them. These consisted principally of  extracts from such authors, both in prose and verse, as they thought would  most enlighten and interest the mind upon the subject of their institution.    In the year 1784 they pursued the same plan; but they began now to print  books. The first, was from a manuscript composed by Joseph Woods, one of  the commitee. It was entitled, Thoughts on the Slavery of the Negroes. This  manuscript was well put together. It was a manly and yet feeling address in  behalf of the oppressed Africans. It contained a sober and dispassionate  appeal to the reason of all without offending the prejudices of any. It was  distributed at the expense of the association, and proved to be highly  useful to the cause which it was intended to promote.    A communication having been made to the commitee, that Dr. Porteus, then  bishop of Chester, had preached a sermon before the Society for the  Propagation of the Gospel, in behalf of the injured Africans, (which sermon  was noticed in the last chapter,) Samuel Hoare was deputed to obtain  permission to publish it. This led him to a correspondence with Mr. Ramsay  before mentioned. The latter applied in consequence to the bishop, and  obtained his consent. Thus this valuable sermon was also given to the  world.    In the year 1785 the association continued their exertions as before; but I  have no room to specify them. I may observe, however, that David Barclay, a  grandson of the great apologist of that name, assisted at one of their  meetings, and (what is singular) that he was in a few years afterwards  unexpectedly called to a trial of his principles on this very subject. For  he and his brother John became, in consequence of a debt due to them,  possessed of a large grazing farm, or pen, in Jamaica, which had thirty-two  slaves upon it. Convinced, however, that the retaining of their  fellow-creatures in bondage was not only irreconcileable with the  principles of Christianity, but subversive of the rights of human nature,  they determined upon the emancipation of these. And they[A] performed this  generous office to the satisfaction of their minds, to the honour of their  characters, to the benefit of the public, and to the happiness of the  slave[B]. I mention this anecdote, not only to gratify myself, by paying a  proper respect to those generous persons who sacrificed their interest to  principle, but also to show the sincerity of David Barclay, (who is now the  only surviving brother,) as he actually put in practice what at one of  these meetings he was desirous of recommending to others.    [Footnote A: They engaged an agent to embark for Jamaica in 1795 to effect  this business, and had the slaves conveyed to Philadelphia, where they were  kindly received by the Society for improving the Condition of free Black  People. Suitable situations were found for the adults, and the young ones  were bound out apprentices to handicraft trades, and to receive school  learning.]    [Footnote B: James Pemberton, of Philadelphia, made the following  observation in a letter to a Friend in England:--\"David Barclay's humane  views towards the Blacks from Jamaica have been so far realized, that these  objects of his concern enjoy their freedom with comfort to themselves, and  are respectable in their characters, keeping up a friendly intercourse with  each other, and avoiding to intermix with the common Blacks of this city,  being sober in their conduct and industrious in their business.\"]    Having now brought up the proceedings of this little association towards  the year 1786, I shall take my leave of it, remarking, that it was the  first ever formed in England for the promotion of the abolition of the  Slave-trade. That Quakers have had this honour is unquestionable. Nor is it  extraordinary that they should have taken the lead on this occasion, when  we consider how advantageously they have been situated for so doing. For  the Slave-trade, as we have not long ago seen, came within the discipline  of the Society in the year 1727. From thence it continued to be an object  of it till 1783. In 1783 the Society petitioned Parliament, and in 1784 it  distributed books to enlighten the public concerning it. Thus we see that  every Quaker, born since the year 1727, was nourished as it were in a fixed  hatred against it. He was taught, that any concern in it was a crime of the  deepest dye. He was taught, that the bearing of his testimony against it  was a test of unity with those of the same religious profession. The  discipline of the Quakers was therefore a school for bringing them up as  advocates for the abolition of this trade. To this it may be added, that  the Quakers knew more about the trade and the slavery of the Africans, than  any other religious body of men, who had not been in the land of their  sufferings. For there had been a correspondence between the Society in  America and that in England on the subject, the contents of which must have  been known to the members of each. American ministers also were frequently  crossing the Atlantic on religious missions to England. These, when they  travelled through various parts of our island, frequently related to the  Quaker families in their way the cruelties they had seen and heard-of in  their own country. English ministers were also frequently going over to  America on the same religious errand. These, on their return, seldom failed  to communicate what they had learned or observed, but more particularly  relative to the oppressed Africans, in their travels. The journals also of  these, which gave occasional accounts of the sufferings of the slaves were  frequently published. Thus situated in point of knowledge, and brought up  moreover from their youth in a detestation of the trade, the Quakers were  ready to act whenever a favourable opportunity should present itself.          CHAPTER V.    _Third class of forerunners and coadjutors, up to 1787, consists of the  Quakers and others in America--Yearly meeting for Pennsylvania and the  Jerseys takes up the subject in 1696--and continue it till 1787--Other five  yearly meetings take similar measures--Quakers, as individuals, also become  labourers--William Burling and others--Individuals of other religious  denominations take up the cause also--Judge Sewell and others--Union of the  Quakers with others in a society for Pennsylvania, in 1774--James Pemberton  --Dr. Rush--Similar union of the Quakers with others for New York and other  provinces_.      The next class of the forerunners and coadjutors, up to the year 1787, will  consist, first, of the Quakers in America; and then of others, as they were  united to these for the same object.    It may be asked, How the Quakers living there should have become  forerunners and coadjutors in the great work now under our consideration. I  reply, first, That it was an object for many years with these to do away  the Slave-trade as it was carried on in their own ports. But this trade was  conducted in part, both before and after the independence of America, by  our own countrymen. It was, secondly, an object with these to annihilate  slavery in America; and this they have been instruments in accomplishing to  a considerable extent. But any abolition of slavery within given boundaries  must be a blow to the Slave-trade there. The American Quakers, lastly,  living in a land where both the commerce and slavery existed, were in the  way of obtaining a number of important facts relative to both, which made  for their annihilation; and communicating many of these facts to those in  England, who espoused the same cause, they became fellow-labourers with  these in producing the event in question.    The Quakers in America, it must be owned, did most of them originally as  other settlers there with respect to the purchase of slaves. They had lands  without a sufficient number of labourers, and families without a sufficient  number of servants, for their work. Africans were poured in to obviate  these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12434"],[0,"Twelve Studies on the Making of a Nation: The Beginnings of Israel's History (#15)"],[1,"es,  implies that it was a period of between one hundred and one hundred  and fifty years.  The same duration is suggested by the priestly  writer in Numbers 26:57-59.  The later traditions tend to extend  the period.  If, as seems probable, the Hebrews first found their  way to Egypt during the reign of Amenhotep IV, who reigned between  1375 and 1358 B.C., the older Hebrew chronology would make Ramses  II, who reigned between 1292 and 1225, the Pharaoh of the  oppression.  Of all the Pharaohs of this period in Egypt's history  the great builder and organizer Ramses II corresponds most closely  to the Biblical description.  He it was who filled Egypt from one  end to the other with vast temples and other buildings which could  have been reared only through the services of a huge army of serfs.  The excavations of the Egypt Exploration fund have identified the  Biblical Pithom with certain ruins in the Wady Tumilat near the  eastern terminus of the modern railroad from Cairo to the Suez  Canal.  This probably lay in the eastern boundary of the Biblical  land of Goshen, which seems to have included the Wady Tumilat and  to have extended westward to the Nile delta.  Here were found  several inscriptions bearing the Egyptian name of the city P-Atum,  house of the god Atum.  The excavations also laid bare a great  square brick wall with the ruins of store chambers inside.  These  rectangular chambers were of various sizes and were surrounded by  walls two or three yards in thickness.  Contemporary inscriptions  indicate that they were filled with grain from the top and were  probably used for the storing of supplies to be used by the armies  of Ramses II in their Asiatic campaigns.  This city was founded by  Ramses II, who during the first twenty years of his reign,  developed and colonized the territory east of the Nile delta  including the Biblical land of Goshen.  A contemporary inscription  also states that he founded near Pithum the house of Ramses, a city  with a royal residence and temples.  Thus the inferences in the  first chapter of Exodus regarding the historical background are in  perfect accord with the facts now known from other sources  regarding the reign of Ramses II.  In transforming the land of  Goshen into a cultivated, agricultural region the nomadic Hebrews  were naturally put to task work by the strong-handed ruler of  Egypt.  That the Hebrews were restive under this tyranny was  natural, inevitable.  Apparently their rebellious attitude also  increased the burden which was placed upon them.  The memory of the  crushing Hyksos invasion, which meant the rule of Egypt by nomadic  invaders from Asia, was still fresh in the minds of the Egyptians.  They both looked down upon and feared the nomad immigrants on their  eastern border.  In the light of these facts it is possible to  understand the motives which influenced Ramses II cruelly to  oppress the Hebrews.  He endeavored, by forced labor and rigorous  peonage, not only to avail himself of their needed services, but  also to crush their spirit and by force to hold in subjection the  alarmingly large serf class which was found at this time in the  land of Egypt.  Was any other procedure to be expected from a  despotic ruler of that land and day?      II.    THE MAKING OF A LOYAL PATRIOT.    The story of Moses' birth and early childhood is one of the most  interesting chapters in Biblical history.  It is full of human and  dramatic interest.  The great crisis in Moses' early manhood came  when he woke to a realization of his kinship with the despised and  oppressed serfs and an appreciation of the cruel injustice of which  they were the helpless victims.  Was Moses justified in resisting  the Egyptian taskmaster?  Are numbers essential to the rightness of  a cause?  What right had Ramses II to demand forced labor from the  immigrants within his border?  Was he justified in his method of  exacting tribute?  Is peonage always disastrous not only to its  victims but also to the government imposing it?    Did Moses show himself a coward in fleeing from the land of Egypt?  Naturally he went to the land of Midian.  The wilderness to the  east of Egypt had for centuries been the place of refuge for  Egyptian fugitives.  From about 2000 B.C. there comes the Egyptian  story of Sinuhit, an Egyptian prince, who, to save his life, fled  eastward past the \"Wall of the Princes\" which guarded the  northeastern frontier of Egypt.  On the borders of the wilderness  he found certain Bedouin herdsmen who received him hospitably.  These \"sand wanderers\" sent him on from tribe to tribe until he  reached the land of Kedem, east of the Dead Sea, where he remained  for a year and a half.  Later he found his way to the court of one  of the local kings in central Palestine where he married and became  in time a prosperous local prince.      III.    THE SCHOOL OF THE WILDERNESS.    The story of Moses is in many ways closely parallel to that of  Sinuhit.  Among the Midianite tribes living to the south and  southeast of Palestine he found refuge and generous hospitality.  The priest of the sub-tribe of the Kenites received him into his  home and gave him his daughter in marriage.  Note the  characteristic Oriental idea of marriage.  Here Moses learned the  lessons that were essential for his training as the leader and  deliverer of his people.    The Kenites figure in later Hebrew history as worshippers of  Jehovah and are frequently associated with the Israelites.  After  the capture of Jericho certain of them went up with the southern  tribes to conquer southern Palestine.  (Judg. 1:16.) It was Jael,  the wife of Heber the Kenite (Judg. 5:24), who rendered the Hebrews  a signal service by slaying Sisera, the fleeing king of the  Canaanites, after the memorable battle beside the River Kishon.  Many modern scholars draw the conclusion from the Biblical  narrative that it was from the Kenites that Moses first learned of  Yahweh (or, as the distinctive name of Israel's God was translated  by later Jewish scribes, Jehovah).  Furthermore it is suggested  that gratitude to the new God, who delivered the Israelites from  their bondage, was the reason why they proved on the whole so loyal  to Jehovah.  This conclusion is possible and in many ways  attractive, but it is beset with serious difficulties.  We know, in  ancient history, of no other example of a people suddenly changing  their religion.  When there have been such sudden and wholesale  conversions in later times they have been either under the  compulsion of the sword, as in the history of Islam, or under the  influence of a far higher religion, as when Christianity has been  carried to heathen peoples on a low stage of civilization.  Do the  earliest Hebrew traditions imply that the ancestors of the  Israelites were worshippers of Jehovah?  Is it not probable that  Moses fled to the nomadic Midianites not only because they were  kinsmen but because they were also worshippers of Jehovah?    In any case Moses' life in Midian tended to intensify his faith in  Jehovah.  The title of his father-in-law implies that this priest  ministered at some wilderness sanctuary.  In the light of the  subsequent Biblical narrative was this possibly at the sacred  spring of Kadesh or on the top of the holy mountain Horeb  (elsewhere called Sinai) where Kenites and Hebrews believed that  Jehovah dwelt, or at least manifested himself?  Moses, in the home  of the Midian priest, was brought into direct and constant contact  with the Jehovah worship.  The cruel fate of his people and the  painful experience in Egypt that had driven him into the wilderness  prepared his mind to receive this training.  His quest was for a  just and strong God, able to deliver the oppressed.  The wilderness  with its lurking foes and the ever-present dread of hunger and  thirst, deepened his sense of need and of dependence upon a power  able to guide the destinies of men.  The peasants of the vast  Antolian plain in central Asia Minor still call every life-giving  spring, \"God hath given.\"  The constant necessity of meeting the  dangers of the wilderness and of defending the flocks entrusted to  Moses' care developed his courage and power of leadership and  action.  What other great leaders of Israel were trained in this  same school?  What was the effect of their wilderness life upon the  early New England pioneers?      IV.    MOSES' CALL TO PUBLIC SERVICE.    The solitude of the wilderness gave Moses ample opportunity for  profound reflection.  His previous experiences made such reflection  natural, indeed inevitable.  Borne by the caravans over the great  highway from the land of the Nile or from desert tribe to tribe  came occasional reports of the cruel injustice to which his kinsmen  in Egypt were subjected.  In these reports he recognized the divine  call to duty.  When perhaps at last the report came that the mighty  despot Ramses II was dead, Moses like his later successor Isaiah  (Is. 6) saw that the moment had come for decision and action.    It looks to many scholars as if three originally distinct versions  of Moses' call have been welded together in the narrative of Exodus  3, 4 and 6.  Each differs in regard to detail (Hist. Bible I,  161-5).  According to the early Judean prophetic account Jehovah  spoke audibly to Moses from the flaming thorn bush.  In the  Northern Israelite version the moment of decision came to him as he  stood with his flock on the sacred mountain Horeb.  Like Isaiah in  his memorable vision of Jehovah's presence, the inner consciousness  of God and the compelling sense of duty led him to cry out: \"Here  am I.\"  Likewise in the late priestly story God's presence and  character were so deeply impressed upon him that he seemed to bear  an audible voice, according to the view of those who accept this  interpretation, even though the later priests believed and taught  that God was a spirit, not like man clothed in flesh and"]]]
