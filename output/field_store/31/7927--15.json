But while the outer world is filled with life.    That inner world from whence this life proceeds,    Concealed from sight by matter's blinding folds,    Whose coarser currents fill with wondrous power    The nervous fluid of the universe    Which darts through nature's frame, from star to star,    From cloud to cloud, filling the world with awe;    Now harnessed to our use, a patient drudge,    Heedless of time or space, bears human thought    From land to land and through the ocean's depths;    And bears the softest tones of human speech    Faster than light, farther than ocean sounds;    And whirls the clattering car through crowded streets,    And floods with light the haunts of prowling thieves--    That inner world, whose very life is love,    Pure love, and perfect, infinite, intense,    That world is now astir.  A rift appears    In those dark clouds that rise from sinful souls    And hide from us its clear celestial light,    And clouds of messengers from that bright world,    Whom they called devas and we angels call,    Rush to that rift to rescue and to save.    The wind from their bright wings fanned Buddha's soul,    The love from their sweet spirits warmed his heart.    He starts from sleep, but rising, scarcely knows    If he had seen a vision while awake,    Or, sunk in sleep, had dreamed a heavenly dream.    From that pure presence all his tempters fled.    The calm of conflict ended filled his soul,    And led by unseen hands he forward passed    To where the sacred fig-tree long had grown,    Beneath whose shade the village altar stood,    Where simple folk would place their willing gifts,    And ask the aid their simple wants required,    Believing all the life above, around,    The life within themselves, must surely come    From living powers that ever hovered near.    Here lay the food Sagata's daughters brought,    The choicest products of his herds and fields,    This grateful food met nature's every need,    Diffused a healthful glow through all his frame,    And all the body's eager yearnings stilled.    Seven days he sat, and ate no more nor drank,    Yet hungered not, nor burned with parching thirst,    For heavenly manna fed his hungry soul--    Its wants were satisfied, the body's ceased.    Seven days he sat, in sweet internal peace    Waiting for light, and sure that light would come,    When seeming scales fell from his inner sight,    His spirit's eyes were opened and he saw    Not far away, but near, within, above,    As dwells the soul within this mortal frame,    A world within this workday world of ours,    The living soul of all material things.      Eastward he saw a never-setting Sun,    Whose light is truth, the light of all the worlds,    Whose heat is tender, all-embracing love,    The inmost Life of everything that lives,    The mighty Prototype and primal Cause    Of all the suns that light this universe,    From ours, full-orbed, that tints the glowing east    And paints the west a thousand varied shades,    To that far distant little twinkling star    That seems no larger than the glow-worm's lamp,    Itself a sun to light such worlds as ours;    And round about Him clouds of living light,    Bright clouds of cherubim and seraphim,    Who sing His praise and execute His will--    Not idly singing, as the foolish feign,    But voicing forth their joy they work and sing;    Doing His will, their works sound forth His praise.      On every side were fields of living green,    With gardens, groves and gently rising hills,    Where crystal streams of living waters flow,    And dim with distance Meru's lofty heights.    No desert sands, no mountains crowned with ice,    For here the scorching simoom never blows,    Nor wintry winds, that pierce and freeze and kill,    But gentle breezes breathing sweet perfumes;    No weeds, no thorns, no bitter poisonous fruits,    No noxious reptiles and no prowling beasts;    For in this world of innocence and love    No evil thoughts give birth to evil things,    But many birds of every varied plume    Delight the ear with sweetest melody;    And many flowers of every varied tint    Fill all the air with odors rich and sweet;    And many fruits, suited to every taste,    Hang ripe and ready that who will may eat--    A world of life, with all its lights and shades,    The bright original of our sad world    Without its sin and storms, its thorns and tears.    No Lethe's sluggish waters lave its shores,    Nor solemn shades, of poet's fancy bred,    Sit idly here to boast of battles past,    Nor wailing ghosts wring here their shadowy hands    For lack of honor to their cast-off dust;    But living men, in human bodies clothed--    Not bodies made of matter, dull and coarse,    Dust from the dust and soon to dust returned,    But living bodies, clothing living souls,    Bodies responsive to the spirit's will,    Clothing in acts the spirit's inmost thoughts--    Dwell here in many mansions, large and fair,    Stretching beyond the keenest vision's hen,    With room for each and more than room for all,    Forever filling and yet never full.    Not clogged by matter, fast as fleetest birds,    Wishing to go, they go; to come, they come.    No helpless infancy or palsied age,    But all in early manhood's youthful bloom,    The old grown young, the child to man's estate.    Gentle they seemed as they passed to and fro,    Gentle and strong, with every manly grace;    Busy as bees in summer's sunny hours,    In works of usefulness and acts of love;    No pinching poverty or grasping greed,    Gladly receiving, they more gladly give,    Sharing in peace the bounties free to all.      As lost in wonder and delight he gazed,    He saw approaching from a pleasant grove    Two noble youths, yet full of gentleness,    Attending one from sole to crown a queen,    With every charm of fresh and blooming youth    And every grace of early womanhood,    Her face the mirror of her gentle soul,    Her flowing robes finer than softest silk,    That as she moved seemed woven of the light;    Not borne by clumsy wings, or labored steps,    She glided on as if her will had wings    That bore her willing body where she wished.    As she approached, close by her side he saw,    As through a veil or thin transparent mist,    The form and features of the aged king,    Older and frailer by six troubled years    Than when they parted, yet his very face,    Whom she was watching with the tenderest care.    And nearer seen each seeming youth was two,    As when at first in Eden's happy shade    Our primal parents ere the tempter came    Were twain, and yet but one, so on they come,    Hand joined in hand, heart beating close to heart,    One will their guide and sharing every thought,    Beaming with tender, all-embracing love,    Whom God had joined and death had failed to part.      What need of words to introduce his guests?    Love knows her own, the mother greets her son.    Her parents and the king's, who long had watched    Their common offspring with a constant care,    Inspiring hope and breathing inward peace    When secret foes assailed on every side,    Now saw him burst the clouds that veiled their view    And stand triumphant full before their eyes.    O happy meeting! joy profound, complete!    Soul greeting soul, heart speaking straight to heart,    While countless happy faces hovered near    And song's of joy sound through Nirvana's heights.      At length, the transports of first meeting past,    More of this new-found world he wished to see,    More of its peace and joy he wished to know.    Led by his loving guides, enwrapt he saw    Such scenes of beauty passing human speech,    Such scenes of peace and joy past human thought,    That he who sings must tune a heavenly lyre    And seraphs touch his lips with living fire.    My unanointed lips will not presume    To try such lofty themes, glad if I gain    A distant prospect of the promised land,    And catch some glimpses through the gates ajar.    Long time he wandered through these blissful scenes,    Time measured by succession of delights,    Till wearied by excess of very joy    Both soul and body sunk in tranquil sleep.    He slept while hosts of devas sweetly sung:    \"Hail, great physician! savior, lover, friend!    Joy of the worlds, guide to Nirvana, hail!\"    From whose bright presence Mara's myriads fled.    But Mara's self, subtlest of all, fled not,    But putting on a seeming yogi's form,    Wasted, as if by fasts, to skin and bone,    On one foot standing, rooted to the ground,    The other raised against his fleshless thigh,    Hands stretched aloft till joints had lost their use,    And clinched so close, as if in firm resolve,    The nails had grown quite through the festering palms,[5]    His tattered robes, as if worn out by age,    Hanging like moss from trees decayed and dead,    While birds were nesting in his tangled hair.    And thus disguised the subtle Mara stood,    And when the master roused him from his sleep    His tempter cried in seeming ecstasy:    \"O! happy wakening! joy succeeding grief!    Peace after trouble! rest that knows no end!    Life after death!  Nirvana found at last!    Here let us wait till wasted by decay    The body's worn-out fetters drop away.\"      \"Much suffering-brother,\" Buddha answered him,    \"The weary traveler, wandering through the night    In doubt and darkness, gladly sees the dawn.    The storm-tossed sailor on the troubled sea,    Wearied and drenched, with joy re-enters port.    But other nights succeed that happy dawn,    And other seas may toss that sailor's bark.    But he who sees Nirvana's sacred Sun,    And in Nirvana's haven furls his sails,    No more shall wander through the starless night,    No more shall battle with the winds and waves.    O joy of joys! our eyes have seen that Sun!    Our sails have almost "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14366"],[0,"Argentina from a British Point of View, and Notes on Argentine Life (#15)"],[1,"'em.\"    It was about the equinox, if I remember rightly--the springtime, when  everything is lovely and lovable: the camp flowers all in bloom, the  aroma of the trees burdening the air with delicious perfume, the fresh  verdure and plenty of grass, the powerful, stout-hearted bounding of the  horse (no longer \"poor\") beneath one, and, above all, the great issue  expected of the business in hand, the most important business to me in  the world at the time--all these combined spelled but one word, \"Hope!\"    Carbine in hand, Colt in holster, I arrived at his residence. There he  was, sitting at the door of his corner house, whence he could look down  three streets at once. How like a spider, I thought.    His welcome was cordial, but he seemed to smile at my eagerness, and  told me that he never dined before eight.    \"But let us sit here in the cool of the evening,\" said he, handing out a  chair for me to sit by him on the footpath, \"and let us take some  refreshment to while away the time. But, tell me, where did you say that  the fence was cut? But did you really see signs that cattle had passed?  Preposterous! The sons of guns shall suffer for this. Eh well, I'm glad  of it in a way--glad to have a little work, and perhaps a little  excitement. It doesn't do to have a too orderly district, for the  Governor and his satellites in Santa Fe imagine I'm lazy and not looking  after my business if they hear of no commotions. That black fellow you  sent me the other day, Don Ernesto--the fellow that was molesting a mad  woman in the camp--- I've got him seventeen years in the line for that.  I wish you would send me a few more, for hardly a letter comes from  Santa Fe in which I am not asked to send in recruits, so hard up are  they for Provincial soldiers.\"    Just then a poor Italian colonist came up, hat in hand. He, too, and all  his class were pioneers in those days, and God knows what they suffered.    \"Well, what d'ye want?\" asked my companion.    \"Sir,\" said the wretched man, stuttering in his nervousness, \"one of my  bullocks has been stolen, and I know the thief. I have been to the  Justice of the Peace, and he told me to bring the thief to him; but,  sir, the th-thief refuses to come.\"    \"_Bueno_! Ten dollars, and ten dollars _down_,\" roared the majesty of  law.    \"But, sir,----\"    \"No! But me no buts! Ten dollars at once, or I'll call the sergeant to  lock you up until you can get it.\"    I could see that the poor fellow's heart was breaking as he drew the  money from his pocket and handed it over. Smilingly the bully turned to  me and said, as his victim walked slowly away, \"I'll bet you that that  man doesn't come around to molest me again. I'll guarantee to you, Don  Ernesto, that there isn't a district in the whole province where so few  appeals for justice are made.\"    At last it was dinner-time, and, being ushered into a dirty room with a  brick floor, dim light and grimy tablecloth, I seated myself at the  table with my host, his secretary, the doctor, and a clerk. The dinner  was in the usual native style of those days: ribs of beef roasted on  the gridiron, beef and pumpkin boiled together, to finish up with  \"caldo,\" which is simply the water in which the beef and vegetables have  been boiled, with a good thick coating of grease.    No sooner had we begun dinner than it was noticed that we had no wine.    \"No wine! How's this? What d'ye mean?\" as he angrily turned to the  sergeant who was waiting.    \"If you please, sir, So-and-so and So-and-so,\" mentioning the name of a  local firm of storekeepers, \"say that they can supply no more wine until  they can get some of their accounts settled.\"    \"How dare you bring me such a message as that! Take the corporal with a  couple of men and bring a half-barrel at once--in less than three  minutes, or I'll know the reason why.\"    The barrel was brought, and, with a bit and brace, quickly tapped, and  the wine set flowing round the table.    The dinner dragged on and on, until I thought he meant us to sit there  all night. Ten o'clock came, half-past, and then eleven. Then I began to  smell a rat. I kept on urging the necessity for action, but it became  more and more evident that the Chief was fooling. He pressed wine upon  all and upon me in particular, while he drank little himself, although  he pretended otherwise. At last, I could stand it no longer, and got up  in no very good humour to go.    \"No, but stop, Don Ernesto! Where are you going? Sit down again. The  horses are not saddled yet: not even caught up. Sit down and have  patience and we'll all go with you in good time.\"    It was after twelve when at last we made a start. There were the Chief,  the sergeant, a corporal, four men, and myself. We rode slowly in a  northerly direction until we came to a small gate in the fence, of which  I had the key. All the way thither the Chief, while commending me for my  forethought in bringing arms, had been impressing upon me the importance  of not using them, no matter what happened, \"Because, you see, you are  not an arm of the law, and if you were to shoot anyone, I should be  obliged to arrest you and send you to Santa Fe.\"    When we got through the fence, what was my surprise when the Chief said,  \"Bueno, Don Ernesto, you and I have had a long day. What I propose is  that you and I off-saddle and doss down here, while the sergeant and men  patrol with muffled bits and spurs at a short distance from the fence.  Then the moment they hear anything they can come and let us know!\"    In vain I protested that this was not my idea at all, and that I too  wanted to do the patrolling, but when he told a man to take the saddle  off my horse and shake down a bed for me, I thought it wiser to  acquiesce, or, at least, appear to do so. I shall never forget that  night. How we talked and talked and talked as we lay beneath the  brilliant stars, I, boiling with rage and anxiety under my assumed  tranquillity, while he, doubtless, was as much annoyed at having to keep  me in conversation. It must have been nearly four o'clock when I told  him that I really must sleep. \"Bueno,\" said he, as he rolled over on his  side, \"hasta manana.\"    In five minutes he was snoring. Even so, I did not dare to move, for  fear that he might be foxing. About an hour passed, during which he  moved, coughed, expectorated, and had other signs of conscious  animation, much to my disgust, until at last I thought the snoring  sounded too genuine to be shammed, so I crept towards him and whispered  in his ear that I thought I heard sounds of movement. But his snoring  was rhythmic and swinish, so I gathered up my saddle and gear and stole  over to my horse, which was picketed some yards off, and proceeded to  saddle him up. In doing so, my stirrups somehow clashed and thought it  was all up, for what a fool I should look if he woke and discovered me.  But it was all right: the music continued.    I led the horse for some little distance, then mounting, I rode him down  alongside the fence for about a mile until I came to a fresh gap in it.    Horror! Even though it was but what my suspicions had depicted, the  realisation came as a shock to me. \"The--! The--!\" To repeat my  expressions would edify no one.    Guided by the signal-lights at the station, I moved along at a smart  trot and soon recognised the quick tramping of animals ahead. Then I  drew back, and as the day was just breaking, I drew round to the west  side of the cavalcade, so that I might see without being seen. Yes, sure  enough, there were six military chacots outlined against the great sky  and a troop of animals ahead of them.    I halted to let them get well away from me, and then, with rage and  hatred in my heart, swearing vengeance all the while, I galloped as hard  as ever I could to the estancia, to impatiently await the uprising of my  boss.    \"We must wire, or one of us must go to the Governor in Santa Fe at  once,\" I urged. But what was my disgust to be met with but a quiet smile  of amusement!    \"Not if I know it,\" said he. \"Why, good God, man, do you want to have  all our throats cut? This man is a personal friend of the Governor's,  and what satisfaction do you think we are likely to get out of that?\"    \"Then let us go to the Consul, the British Minister, or even to the  President of the Republic?\"    A quiet smile with a negatory shake of the head was the only answer.    A fortnight later I sought him in his private sitting-room and found the  Chief of Police sitting in an easy-chair.    \"Ha! ha! ha! Don Ernesto. So you caught us, did you? Well, it was worth  the fun. I never laughed so much in all my life as when I awoke that  morning and found that you had given me the slip!\"          A VISIT TO THE NORTHERN CHACO.      After three years on an estancia in the vast monotonous, treeless, but  most fertile plains of the Central Argentine, under scorching sun,  driving rains, and biting wind, one feels that one would like to see a  river sometimes, animal life and more congenial surroundings; and so I  determined to visit the Northern Chaco, that enormous tract of land  which lies North of Santa Fe and stretches right away for many hundreds  of miles to North, East, and West.    Leaving Rosario by the night express, one crosses the great, slightly  undulating plains, probably among the richest in the world for the  growth of wheat, linseed, and maize, reaching Santa Fe early the  following morning. This town, the capital and Government centre of the  province, is rather an uninteresting place; chiefly noticeable in it are  the great number of fine churches and the magnificent sawmills owned by  a large French company. Santa Fe is supposed to be one of the most  religious centres in the Republic. More than once it has almost been  washed away in an eddy of the giant Parana in flood, the water rising  four feet in the houses on the highest level in the town.    After spending a day of sight-seeing "]]]
