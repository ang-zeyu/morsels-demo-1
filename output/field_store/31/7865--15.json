Inside, the nest is lined with extremely  fine grass-stems; the nest is barely 4 inches in diameter exteriorly  and 2.5 in height; the egg-cavity is 2.4 in diameter and 1.2 in depth.    Mr. Mandelli sends me an egg which he considers to belong to this  species, found near Darjeeling on the 7th May. It is a broad oval,  very slightly compressed at one end; the shell dull and glossless; the  ground a dead white, profusely streaked and smudged pretty thickly  all over with pale yellowish brown; the whole bigger end of the egg  clouded with dull inky purple and two or three hair-lines of burnt  sienna in different parts of the egg. The egg measures 0.8 by 0.61.    Two eggs of this species, procured in Sikhim on the 17th May, are very  regular ovals, scarcely at all pointed towards the lesser end. The  ground-colour is creamy white, and the markings consist of large  indistinct blotches of pale yellow; round the large end is an almost  confluent zone or cap of purplish grey, darker in one egg; they have  no gloss, and both measure 0.82 by 0.61.

Ind._ ii, p. 38; _Hume, Rough  Draft N.& E._ no. 410.    Of the Rufous-necked Laughing-Thrush, Mr. Blyth remarks:--\"Mr. Hodgson  figures the egg of a fine green colour.\"    The egg is not figured in my collection of Mr. Hodgson's drawings.    Writing from near Darjeeling, in Sikhim, Mr. Gammie says:--\"I have  seen two nests of this bird; both were in bramble-bushes about five  feet from the ground, and exactly resembled those of _Dryonastes  caerulatus_, only they were a little smaller. One nest had three young  ones, the other three very pale blue unspotted eggs, which I left in  the nest intending to get them in another day or two, as I wanted to  see if more eggs would be laid, but when I went back to the place the  nest had been taken away by some one. Both nests were found here in  May, one at 3500 feet, the other at 4500 feet.    \"I have taken numerous nests of this species from April to June, from  the warmest elevations up to about 4000 feet. They are cup-shaped;  composed of dry leaves and small climber-stems, and lined with a few  fibrous roots. They measure externally about 5 inches in width by 3.5  in depth; internally 3.25 across by 2.25 deep. Usually they are found  in scrubby jungle, fixed in bushes, within five or six feet of the  ground. The eggs are three or four in number.\"    Many nests of this species sent me from Sikhim by my friends Messrs.  Mandelli and Gammie are all precisely of the same type--deep and  rather compact cups, varying from 5 to 6 inches in external diameter,  and 3.25 to 3.75 in height; the cavities about 3.25 in diameter  and 2.25 in depth. The nest is composed almost entirely of dry  bamboo-leaves bound together loosely with stems of creepers or roots,  and the cavity is lined with black and brown rootlets, generally not  very fine. They seem never to be placed at any very great elevation  from the ground.    The eggs of this species, of which I have received a very large number  from Mr. Gammie, are distinguishable at once from those of all the  other species of this group with which I am acquainted. Just as the  egg of _Garrulax albigularis_ is distinguished by its very deep tone  of coloration, the egg of the present species is distinguished by its  extreme paleness. In shape the eggs are moderately broad ovals, often,  however, somewhat pyriform, often a good deal pointed towards the  small end. The shell is extremely fine and smooth, and has a very  fine gloss; they may be said to be almost white with a delicate  bluish-green tinge. In length they vary from 0.95 to 1.1, in breadth  from 0.6 to 0.83; but the average of forty-one eggs is 1.02 by 0.75.      65. Dryonastes caerulatus (Hodgs.). _The Grey-sided  Laughing-Thrush_.    Garrulax caerulatus (_Hodgs._), _Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 36; _Hume,  Rough Draft N. & E._ no. 408.    A nest of the Grey-sided Laughing-Thrush found by Mr. Gammie on the  17th June near Darjeeling, below Rishap, at an elevation of about 3500  feet, was placed in a shrub, at a height of about six feet from the  ground, and contained one fresh egg. It was a large, deep, compact  cup, measuring about 5.5 inches in external diameter and about 4 in  height, the egg-cavity being 4 inches in diameter and 23/4 inches in  depth. Externally it was entirely composed of very broad flag-like  grass-leaves firmly twisted together, and internally of coarse black  grass and moss-roots very neatly and compactly put together. The nest  had no other lining.    This year (1874) Mr. Gammie writes:--\"This species breeds in Sikhim  in May and Jane. I have found the nests in our Chinchona reserves, at  various elevations from 3500 to 5000 feet, always in forests with  a more or less dense undergrowth. The nest is placed in trees, at  heights of from 6 to 12 feet from the ground, between and firmly  attached to several slender upright shoots. It is cup-shaped, usually  rather shallow, composed of dry bamboo-leaves and twigs and lined with  root-fibres. One I measured was 5 inches in diameter by 2.5 in height  exteriorly; the cavity was 4 inches across and only 1.3 deep. Of  course they vary slightly. As far as my experience goes, they do not  lay more than three eggs; indeed, at times only two.\"    Dr. Jerdon remarks that \"a nest and eggs, said to be of this bird,  were brought to me at Darjeeling; the nest loosely made with roots and  grass, and containing two pale blue eggs.\"    One nest of this species taken in Native Sikhim in July, was placed in  the fork of four leafy twigs, and was in shape a slightly truncated  inverted cone, nearly 7 inches in height and 5.5 in diameter at the  base of the cone, which was uppermost. The leaves attached to the  twigs almost completely enveloped it. The nest itself was composed  almost entirely of stems of creepers, several of which were wound  round the living leaves of the twigs so as to hold them in position on  the outside of the nest; a few bamboo-leaves were intermingled with  the creeper's stems in the body of the nest. The cavity, which is  almost perfectly hemispherical, only rather deeper, is 3.5 inches in  diameter and 2.25 in depth, and is entirely and very neatly lined with  very fine black roots. Another nest, which was taken at Rishap on the  21st May, with two fresh eggs, was placed in some small bamboos at a  height of about 10 feet from the ground, it is composed externally  entirely of dry bamboo-leaves, loosely tied together by a few creepers  and a little vegetable fibre, and it is lined pretty thickly with fine  black fibrous roots. This nest is about 6 inches in diameter and 3.5  high exteriorly, while the cavity measures 3.5 by 2.    The eggs sent me by Mr. Gammie are a beautiful clear, rather pale,  greenish blue, without any spots or markings. They have a slight  gloss. In shape they are typically much elongated and somewhat  pyriform ovals, very obtuse at both ends; but moderately broad  examples are met with. In length they vary from 1.05 to 1.33, and in  breadth from 0.76 to 0.86; but the average of thirty-five eggs is 1.18  nearly by 0.82 nearly.      69. Garrulax leucolophus (Hardw.). _The Himalayan White-crested  Laughing-Thrush_.    Garrulax leucolophus (_Hardw.), Jerd. B, Ind._ ii, p. 35; _Hume. Rough  Draft N. & E._ no. 407.    According to Mr. Hodgson's notes, the Himalayan White-crested  Laughing-Thrush breeds at various elevations in Sikhim and Nepal, from  the Terai to an elevation of 5000 or 6000 feet, from April to June. It  lays from four to six eggs, which are described and figured as pure  white, very broad ovals, measuring 1.2 by 0.9. It breeds, we are told,  in small trees, constructing a rude cup-shaped nest amongst a clamp of  shoots, or between a number of slender twigs, of dry bamboo-leaves,  creepers, scales of the turmeric plant, &c., and lined with fine  roots.    Dr. Jerdon says:--\"I have had the nest and eggs brought me more than  once when at Darjeeling, the former being a large mass of roots, moss,  and grass, with a few pure white eggs.\"    One nest taken in July at Darjeeling was placed on the outer branches  of a tree, at about the height of 8 feet from the ground. It was a  very broad shallow saucer, 8 inches in diameter, about an inch in  thickness, and with a depression of about an inch in depth. It was  composed of dead bamboo-leaves bound together with creepers, and lined  thinly with coarse roots. It contained four fresh eggs. Other similar  nests contained four or three eggs each.    From Sikhim, Mr. Gammie writes:--\"I have found this Laughing-Thrush  breeding in May and June, up to about 3500 feet; I have rarely seen  it at higher elevations, and cannot but think that Mr. Hodgson is  mistaken in stating that it breeds up to 5000 or 6000 feet. The nests  are generally placed in shrubs, within reach of the hand, among low,  dense jungle, and are rather loosely built cup-shaped structures,  composed of twigs and grass, and lined with fibrous roots. Externally  they measure about 6 inches in diameter by 3.5 in depth; internally 4  by 2.25.    \"The eggs are usually four or five in number, but on several occasions  I have found as few as two well-set eggs.\"    Numerous nests of this species have now been sent me, taken in May,  June, and July, at elevations of from 2000 to fully 4000 feet, and  in one case it is said 5000. They are all very similar, large, very  shallow cups, from 6 to nearly 8 inches in external diameter, and from  2.5 to 3.5 in height; exteriorly all are composed of coarse grass,  of bamboo-spathes, with occasionally a few dead leaves intermingled,  loosely wound round with creepers or pliant twigs,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1312"],[0,"Selected Stories of Bret Harte (#15)"],[1,"side of the table and toward the bed,  and another on his side of the table for himself. The first was a deuce,  his own card, a king. He then shuffled and cut again. This time \"dummy\"  had a queen, and himself a four-spot. Jack brightened up for the third  deal. It brought his adversary a deuce, and himself a king again. \"Two  out of three,\" said Jack, audibly.    \"What's that, Jack?\" said Brown.    \"Nothing.\"    Then Jack tried his hand with dice; but he always threw sixes, and his  imaginary opponent aces. The force of habit is sometimes confusing.    Meanwhile, some magnetic influence in Mr. Hamlin's presence, or the  anodyne of liquor, or both, brought surcease of sorrow, and Brown slept.  Mr. Hamlin moved his chair to the window, and looked out on the town  of Wingdam, now sleeping peacefully--its harsh outlines softened and  subdued, its glaring colors mellowed and sobered in the moonlight that  flowed over all. In the hush he could hear the gurgling of water in the  ditches, and the sighing of the pines beyond the hill. Then he looked  up at the firmament, and as he did so a star shot across the twinkling  field. Presently another, and then another. The phenomenon suggested to  Mr. Hamlin a fresh augury. If in another fifteen minutes another star  should fall--He sat there, watch in hand, for twice that time, but the  phenomenon was not repeated.    The clock struck two, and Brown still slept. Mr. Hamlin approached the  table and took from his pocket a letter, which he read by the flickering  candlelight. It contained only a single line, written in pencil, in a  woman's hand:    \"Be at the corral, with the buggy, at three.\"    The sleeper moved uneasily, and then awoke. \"Are you there Jack?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Don't go yet. I dreamed just now, Jack--dreamed of old times. I thought  that Sue and me was being married agin, and that the parson, Jack,  was--who do you think?--you!\"    The gambler laughed, and seated himself on the bed--the paper still in  his hand.    \"It's a good sign, ain't it?\" queried Brown.    \"I reckon. Say, old man, hadn't you better get up?\"    The \"old man,\" thus affectionately appealed to, rose, with the  assistance of Hamlin's outstretched hand.    \"Smoke?\"    Brown mechanically took the proffered cigar.    \"Light?\"    Jack had twisted the letter into a spiral, lit it, and held it for his  companion. He continued to hold it until it was consumed, and dropped  the fragment--a fiery star--from the open window. He watched it as it  fell, and then returned to his friend.    \"Old man,\" he said, placing his hands upon Brown's shoulders, \"in ten  minutes I'll be on the road, and gone like that spark. We won't see each  other agin; but, before I go, take a fool's advice: sell out all you've  got, take your wife with you, and quit the country. It ain't no place  for you, nor her. Tell her she must go; make her go, if she won't.  Don't whine because you can't be a saint, and she ain't an angel. Be a  man--and treat her like a woman. Don't be a damn fool. Good-by.\"    He tore himself from Brown's grasp, and leaped down the stairs like  a deer. At the stable door he collared the half-sleeping hostler and  backed him against the wall. \"Saddle my horse in two minutes, or I'll--\"  The ellipsis was frightfully suggestive.    \"The missis said you was to have the buggy,\" stammered the man.    \"Damn the buggy!\"    The horse was saddled as fast as the nervous hands of the astounded  hostler could manipulate buckle and strap.    \"Is anything up, Mr. Hamlin?\" said the man, who, like all his class,  admired the elan of his fiery patron, and was really concerned in his  welfare.    \"Stand aside!\"    The man fell back. With an oath, a bound, and clatter, Jack was into the  road. In another moment, to the man's half-awakened eyes, he was but a  moving cloud of dust in the distance, toward which a star just loosed  from its brethren was trailing a stream of fire.    But early that morning the dwellers by the Wingdam turnpike, miles away,  heard a voice, pure as a skylark's, singing afield. They who were asleep  turned over on their rude couches to dream of youth and love and olden  days. Hard-faced men and anxious gold-seekers, already at work, ceased  their labors and leaned upon their picks, to listen to a romantic  vagabond ambling away against the rosy sunrise.          HIGH-WATER MARK      When the tide was out on the Dedlow Marsh, its extended dreariness  was patent. Its spongy, low-lying surface, sluggish, inky pools, and  tortuous sloughs, twisting their slimy way, eel-like, toward the open  bay, were all hard facts. So were the few green tussocks, with their  scant blades, their amphibious flavor and unpleasant dampness. And if  you choose to indulge your fancy--although the flat monotony of the  Dedlow Marsh was not inspiring--the wavy line of scattered drift gave  an unpleasant consciousness of the spent waters, and made the dead  certainty of the returning tide a gloomy reflection which no present  sunshine could dissipate. The greener meadowland seemed oppressed with  this idea, and made no positive attempt at vegetation until the work of  reclamation should be complete. In the bitter fruit of the low cranberry  bushes one might fancy he detected a naturally sweet disposition curdled  and soured by an injudicious course of too much regular cold water.    The vocal expression of the Dedlow Marsh was also melancholy and  depressing. The sepulchral boom of the bittern, the shriek of the  curlew, the scream of passing brent, the wrangling of quarrelsome  teal, the sharp, querulous protest of the startled crane, and syllabled  complaint of the \"killdeer\" plover, were beyond the power of written  expression. Nor was the aspect of these mournful fowls at all cheerful  and inspiring. Certainly not the blue heron standing mid-leg deep in the  water, obviously catching cold in a reckless disregard of wet feet  and consequences; nor the mournful curlew, the dejected plover, or  the low-spirited snipe, who saw fit to join him in his suicidal  contemplation; nor the impassive kingfisher--an ornithological  Marius--reviewing the desolate expanse; nor the black raven that went to  and fro over the face of the marsh continually, but evidently couldn't  make up his mind whether the waters had subsided, and felt low-spirited  in the reflection that, after all this trouble, he wouldn't be able to  give a definite answer. On the contrary, it was evident at a glance that  the dreary expanse of Dedlow Marsh told unpleasantly on the birds, and  that the season of migration was looked forward to with a feeling  of relief and satisfaction by the full-grown, and of extravagant  anticipation by the callow, brood. But if Dedlow Marsh was cheerless  at the slack of the low tide, you should have seen it when the tide was  strong and full. When the damp air blew chilly over the cold, glittering  expanse, and came to the faces of those who looked seaward like another  tide; when a steel-like glint marked the low hollows and the sinuous  line of slough; when the great shell-incrusted trunks of fallen trees  arose again, and went forth on their dreary, purposeless wanderings,  drifting hither and thither, but getting no farther toward any goal  at the falling tide or the day's decline than the cursed Hebrew in the  legend; when the glossy ducks swung silently, making neither ripple nor  furrow on the shimmering surface; when the fog came in with the tide and  shut out the blue above, even as the green below had been obliterated;  when boatmen lost in that fog, paddling about in a hopeless way, started  at what seemed the brushing of mermen's fingers on the boat's keel, or  shrank from the tufts of grass spreading around like the floating hair  of a corpse, and knew by these signs that they were lost upon Dedlow  Marsh and must make a night of it, and a gloomy one at that--then you  might know something of Dedlow Marsh at high water.    Let me recall a story connected with this latter view which never failed  to recur to my mind in my long gunning excursions upon Dedlow Marsh.  Although the event was briefly recorded in the county paper, I had the  story, in all its eloquent detail, from the lips of the principal actor.  I cannot hope to catch the varying emphasis and peculiar coloring of  feminine delineation, for my narrator was a woman; but I'll try to give  at least its substance.    She lived midway of the great slough of Dedlow Marsh and a good-sized  river, which debouched four miles beyond into an estuary formed by  the Pacific Ocean, on the long sandy peninsula which constituted the  southwestern boundary of a noble bay. The house in which she lived was  a small frame cabin raised from the marsh a few feet by stout piles, and  was three miles distant from the settlements upon the river. Her husband  was a logger--a profitable business in a county where the principal  occupation was the manufacture of lumber.    It was the season of early spring when her husband left on the ebb of a  high tide, with a raft of logs for the usual transportation to the lower  end of the bay. As she stood by the door of the little cabin when the  voyagers departed she noticed a cold look in the southeastern sky, and  she remembered hearing her husband say to his companions that they must  endeavor to complete their voyage before the coming of the southwesterly  gale which he saw brewing. And that night it began to storm and blow  harder than she had ever before experienced, and some great trees fell  in the forest by the river, and the house rocked like her baby's cradle.    But however the storm might roar about the little cabin, she knew that  one she trusted had driven bolt and bar with his own strong hand, and  that had he feared for her he would not have left her. This, and her  domestic duties, and the care of her little sickly baby, helped to keep  her mind from dwelling on the weather, except, of course, to hope that  he was"]]]
