Add one  celery root, three small onions, a bunch of parsley, one dozen whole  peppercorns, half a dozen cloves, two bay leaves and a teaspoon of fine  salt. Boil steadily for eight hours and then pour through a fine hair  sieve. When cold remove every particle of fat and set on to boil again,  skimming until clear. Then break two eggs, shells and all, into a deep  bowl, beat them up with one cup of vinegar, pour some of the soup stock  into this and set all back on the stove to boil up once, stirring all  the while. Then remove from the fire and pour through a jelly-bag as you  would jelly. Pour into jelly-glasses or one large mould. Set on ice.      GANSLEBER IN SULZ (GOOSE-LIVER ASPIC)    Fry a large goose liver in goose-fat. Season with salt, pepper, a few  whole cloves and a very little onion. Cut it up in slices and mix with  the sulz and the whites of hard-boiled eggs.      GANSLEBER PUREE IN SULZ    After the liver is fried, rub it through a sieve or colander and mix  with sulz.      GOOSE LIVER    If very large cut in half, dry well on a clean cloth, after having lain  in salted water for an hour. Season with fine salt and pepper, fry in  very hot goose-fat and add a few cloves. While frying cut up a little  onion very fine and add. Then cover closely and smother in this way  until you wish to serve. Dredge the liver with flour before frying and  turn occasionally. Serve with a slice of lemon on each piece of liver.      GOOSE LIVER WITH GLACED CHESTNUTS    Prepare as above and garnish with chestnuts which have been prepared  thus: Scald until perfectly white, heat some goose-fat, add nuts, a  little sugar and glaze a light brown.      GOOSE LIVER WITH MUSHROOM SAUCE    Take a large white goose liver, lay in salt water for an hour (this rule  applies to all kinds of liver), wipe dry, salt, pepper and dredge with  flour. Fry in hot goose-fat. Cut up a piece of onion, add a few cloves,  a few slices of celery, cut very fine, whole peppers, one bay leaf, and  some mushrooms. Cover closely and stew a few minutes. Add lemon juice to  sauce.      SPANISH LIVER    Boil in salt water one-half pound calf's liver. Drain and cut into small  cubes. Chop one onion, one tablespoon parsley, some mint; add two  cloves, a little cinnamon, a little tabasco sauce, one tablespoon olive  oil, and one cup of soup stock. Add one cup of bread crumbs which have  been soaked in hot water and then drained. Mix all with the liver and  bring to a boil. Serve with Spanish rice.      STEWED MILT    Clean the milt thoroughly and boil with your soup meat. Set to boil with  cold water and let it boil about two hours. Then take it out and cut  into finger lengths and prepare the following sauce: Heat one tablespoon  of drippings in a spider. When hot cut up a clove of garlic very fine  and brown slightly in the fat. Add a tablespoon of flour, stirring  briskly, pepper and salt to taste and thin with soup stock, then the  pieces of milt and let it simmer slowly. If the sauce is too thick add  more water or soup stock. Some add a few caraway seeds instead of the  garlic, which is a matter of taste.      GEFILLTE MILZ (MILT)    Clean the milt by taking off the thin outer skin and every particle of  fat that adheres to it. Lay it on a clean board, make an incision with  a knife through the centre of the milt, taking care not to cut through  the lower skin, and scrape with the edge of a spoon, taking out all the  flesh you can without tearing the milt and put it into a bowl until  wanted. In the meantime dry the bread, which you have previously soaked  in water, in a spider in which you have heated some suet or goose oil,  and cut up part of an onion in it very fine. When the bread is  thoroughly dried, add it to the flesh scraped from the milt. Also two  eggs, one-half teaspoon of salt, pepper, nutmeg and a very little thyme  (leave out the latter if you object to the flavor), and add a speck of  ground ginger instead. Now work all thoroughly with your hands and fill  in the milt. The way to do this is to fill it lengthwise all through the  centre and sew it up; when done prick it with a fork in several places  to prevent its bursting while boiling. You can parboil it after it is  filled in the soup you are to have for dinner, then take it up carefully  and brown slightly in a spider of heated fat; or form the mixture into a  huge ball and bake it in the oven with flakes of fat put here and there,  basting often. Bake until a hard crust is formed over it.      CALF'S LIVER SMOTHERED IN ONIONS    Heat some goose fat in a stew-pan with a close-fitting lid. Cut up an  onion in it and when the onion is of a light yellow color, place in the  liver which you have previously sprinkled with fine salt and dredged  with flour. Add a bay leaf, five cloves and two peppercorns. Cover up  tight and stew the liver, turning it occasionally and when required  adding a little hot water.      CHICKEN LIVERS    Slice three or four livers from chicken or other fowl and dredge well  with flour. Fry one minced onion in one tablespoon of fat until light  brown. Put in the liver and shake the pan over the fire to sear all  sides. Add one-half teaspoon of salt, one-eighth teaspoon of paprika and  one-half cup of strong soup stock. Allow it to boil up once. Add one  tablespoon claret or sherry and serve immediately on toast.      KISCHKES--RUSSIAN STYLE    Buy beef casings of butcher. Make a filling of fat, flour (using  one-third cup fat to one cup flour) and chopped onions. Season well with  salt and pepper, cut them in short lengths, fasten one end, stuff and  then fasten the open end. If they are not already cleaned the surface  exposed after filling the casing is scraped until cleaned after having  been plunged into boiling water. Slice two large onions in a  roasting-pan, and roast the kischkes slowly until well done and well  browned. Baste frequently with liquid in the pan.      KISCHKES    Prepare as above. If the large casings are used they need not be cut in  shorter lengths. Boil for three hours in plenty of water and when done,  put in frying-pan with one tablespoon of fat, cover and let brown  nicely. Serve hot.      HASHED CALF'S LUNG AND HEART    Lay the lung and heart in water for half an hour and then put on to boil  in a soup kettle with your soap meat intended for dinner. When soft,  remove from the soup and chop up quite fine. Heat one tablespoon of  goose fat in a spider; chop up an onion very fine and add to the heated  fat. When yellow, add the hashed lung and heart, salt, pepper, soup  stock and thicken with flour. You may prepare this sweet and sour by  adding a little vinegar and brown sugar, one-half teaspoon of cinnamon  and one tablespoon of molasses; boil slowly; keep covered until ready to  serve.      TRIPE A LA CREOLE    Boil tripe with onion, parsley, celery, and seasoning; cut in small  pieces, then boil up in the following sauce: Take one tablespoon of fat,  brown it with two tablespoons of flour; then add one can of boiled and  strained tomatoes, one can of mushrooms, salt and pepper to taste. Serve  in ramekins.      TRIPE, FAMILY STYLE    Scald and scrape two pounds tripe and cut into inch squares. Take big  kitchen spoon of drippings and put in four large onions quartered and  three small cloves of garlic cut up very fine. Let steam, but not brown.  When onions begin to cook, put in tripe and steam half an hour. Then  cover tripe with water and let cook slowly three hours. Boil a few  potatoes and cut in dice shapes and add to it. Half an hour before  serving, add the following, after taking off as much fat from the tripe  as possible: Three tablespoons of flour thinned with little water; add  catsup, paprika, ginger, and one teaspoon of salt. It should all be  quite thick, like paste, when cooked.      BOILED TONGUE, (SWEET AND SOUR)    Lay the fresh tongue in cold water for a couple of hours and then put it  on to boil in enough water to barely cover it, adding salt. Boil until  tender. To ascertain when tender run a fork through the thickest part. A  good rule is to boil it, closely covered, from three to four hours  steadily. Pare off the thick skin which covers the tongue, cut into even  slices, sprinkle a little fine salt over each piece and then prepare the  following sauce: Put one tablespoon of drippings in a kettle or spider  (goose fat is very good). Cut up an onion in it, add a tablespoon of  flour and stir, adding gradually about a pint of the liquor in which the  tongue was boiled. Cut up a lemon in slices, remove the seeds, and add  two dozen raisins, a few pounded almonds, a stick of cinnamon and a few  cloves. Sweeten with four tablespoons of brown sugar in which you have  put one-half teaspoon of ground cinnamon, one tablespoon of molasses and  two tablespoons of vinegar. Let this boil, lay in the slices of tongue  and boil up for a few minutes.      FILLED TONGUE    Take a pickled tongue, cut it open; chop or grind some corned beef; add  one egg; brown a little onion, and add some soaked bread; fill tongue  with it, and sew it up and boil until done.      SMOKED TONGUE    Put on to boil in a large kettle, fill with cold water, enough to  completely cover the tongue; keep adding hot water as it boils down so  as to keep it covered with water until done. Keep covered with a lid  while boiling and put a heavy weight on the top of the lid so as not to  let the steam escape. (If you have an old flat iron use it as a weight.)  It should boil very slowly and steadily for four hours. When tongue is  cooked set it outdoors to cool in the liquor in which it was boiled. If  the tongue is very dry, soak overnight before boiling. In serving slice  very thin and garnish with parsley.      SMOTHERED TONGUE    Scald tongue, and then skin. Season well with salt and pepper and slice  an onion over it. Let it stand overnight. Put some drippings in a  covered iron pot, and then the tongue, with whatever juice "]]]
