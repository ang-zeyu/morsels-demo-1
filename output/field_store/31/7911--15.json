Nouns are seldom used as names of objects without additional  words joined to them to add to their meaning. For example, if we wish  to speak of a friend's house, we cannot guide one to it by merely  calling it _a house_. We need to add some words to tell its color,  size, position, etc., if we are at a distance; and if we are near, we  need some word to point out the house we speak of, so that no other  will be mistaken for it. So with any object, or with persons.    As to the kind of words used, we may begin with the common adjectives  telling the _characteristics_ of an object. If a chemist discovers a  new substance, he cannot describe it to others without telling its  qualities: he will say it is _solid_, or _liquid_, or _gaseous_;  _heavy_ or _light_; _brittle_ or _tough_; _white_ or _red_; etc.    Again, in _pointing out_ an object, adjectives are used; such as in  the expressions \"_this_ man,\" \"_that_ house,\" \"_yonder_ hill,\" etc.    Instead of using nouns indefinitely, the _number_ is limited by  adjectives; as, \"_one_ hat,\" \"_some_ cities,\" \"_a hundred_ men.\"    The office of an adjective, then, is to narrow down or limit the  application of a noun. It may have this office alone, or it may at the  same time add to the meaning of the noun.      [Sidenote: _Substantives._]    140. Nouns are not, however, the only words limited by adjectives:  pronouns and other words and expressions also have adjectives joined  to them. Any word or word group that performs the same office as a  noun may be modified by adjectives.    To make this clear, notice the following sentences:--    [Sidenote: _Pronoun._]         If _he_ be _thankful_ for small benefits, it shows that he weighs       men's minds, and their trash.--BACON.    [Sidenote: _Infinitives._]         _To err_ is _human_; _to forgive, divine_.--POPE.         With exception of the \"and then,\" the \"and there,\" and the still       less _significant_ \"_and so_,\" they constitute all his       connections.--COLERIDGE.      [Sidenote: _Definition._]    141. An adjective is a word joined to a noun or other substantive  word or expression, to describe it or to limit its application.      [Sidenote: _Classes of adjectives._]    142. Adjectives are divided into four classes:--    (1) Descriptive adjectives, which describe by expressing qualities  or attributes of a substantive.    (2) Adjectives of quantity, used to tell how many things are spoken  of, or how much of a thing.    (3) Demonstrative adjectives, pointing out particular things.    (4) Pronominal adjectives, words primarily pronouns, but used  adjectively sometimes in modifying nouns instead of standing for them.  They include relative and interrogative words.        DESCRIPTIVE ADJECTIVES.      143. This large class includes several kinds of words:--    (1) SIMPLE ADJECTIVES expressing quality; such as _safe_, _happy_,  _deep_, _fair_, _rash_, _beautiful_, _remotest_, _terrible_, etc.    (2) COMPOUND ADJECTIVES, made up of various words thrown together to  make descriptive epithets. Examples are, \"_Heaven-derived_ power,\"  \"this _life-giving_ book,\" \"his spirit wrapt and _wonder-struck_,\"  \"_ice-cold_ water,\" \"_half-dead_ traveler,\" \"_unlooked-for_ burden,\"  \"_next-door_ neighbor,\" \"_ivory-handled_ pistols,\" \"the  _cold-shudder-inspiring_ Woman in White.\"    (3) PROPER ADJECTIVES, derived from proper nouns; such as, \"an old  _English_ manuscript,\" \"the _Christian_ pearl of charity,\" \"the  well-curb had a _Chinese_ roof,\" \"the _Roman_ writer Palladius.\"    (4) PARTICIPIAL ADJECTIVES, which are either pure participles used to  describe, or participles which have lost all verbal force and have no  function except to express quality. Examples are,--    _Pure participial adjectives_: \"The _healing_ power of the Messiah,\"  \"The _shattering_ sway of one strong arm,\" \"_trailing_ clouds,\" \"The  _shattered_ squares have opened into line,\" \"It came on like the  _rolling_ simoom,\" \"God tempers the wind to the _shorn_ lamb.\"    _Faded participial adjectives_: \"Sleep is a _blessed_ thing;\" \"One is  hungry, and another is _drunken_;\" \"under the _fitting_ drapery of the  jagged and trailing clouds;\" \"The clearness and quickness are  _amazing_;\" \"an _aged_ man;\" \"a _charming_ sight.\"      [Sidenote: _Caution._]    144. Care is needed, in studying these last-named words, to  distinguish between a participle that forms part of a verb, and a  participle or participial adjective that belongs to a noun.    For instance: in the sentence, \"The work was well and rapidly  accomplished,\" _was accomplished_ is a verb; in this, \"No man of his  day was more brilliant or more accomplished,\" _was_ is the verb, and  _accomplished_ is an adjective.

Is the italicized word an adjective in this?--    The old sources of intellectual excitement seem to be well-nigh  _exhausted_.        ADJECTIVES OF QUANTITY.      145. Adjectives of quantity tell _how much_ or _how many_. They have  these three subdivisions:--    [Sidenote: _How much._]    (1) QUANTITY IN BULK: such words as _little_, _much_, _some_, _no_,  _any_, _considerable_, sometimes _small_, joined usually to singular  nouns to express an indefinite measure of the thing spoken of.    The following examples are from Kingsley:--         So he parted with _much_ weeping of the lady.       Which we began to do with _great_ labor and _little_ profit.       Because I had _some_ knowledge of surgery and blood-letting.       But ever she looked on Mr. Oxenham, and seemed to take _no_          care as long as he was by.    Examples of _small_ an adjective of quantity:--         \"The deil's in it but I bude to anger him!\" said the woman, and       walked away with a laugh of _small_ satisfaction.--MACDONALD.         'Tis midnight, but _small_ thoughts have I of sleep.--COLERIDGE.         It gives _small_ idea of Coleridge's way of talking.--CARLYLE.    When _some_, _any_, _no_, are used with plural nouns, they come under  the next division of adjectives.    [Sidenote: _How many._]    (2) QUANTITY IN NUMBER, which may be expressed exactly by numbers or  remotely designated by words expressing indefinite amounts. Hence the  natural division into--    (_a_) _Definite numerals_; as, \"_one_ blaze of musketry;\" \"He found in  the pathway _fourteen_ Spaniards;\" \"I have lost _one_ brother, but I  have gained _fourscore_;\" \"_a dozen_ volunteers.\"    (_b_) _Indefinite numerals_, as the following from Kingsley: \"We gave  _several_ thousand pounds for it;\" \"In came some five and twenty more,  and with them _a few_ negroes;\" \"Then we wandered for _many_ days;\"  \"Amyas had evidently _more_ schemes in his head;\" \"He had lived by  hunting for _some_ months;\" \"That light is far too red to be the  reflection of _any_ beams of hers.\"      [Sidenote: _Single ones of any number of changes._]    (3) DISTRIBUTIVE NUMERALS, which occupy a place midway between the  last two subdivisions of numeral adjectives; for they are indefinite  in telling how many objects are spoken of, but definite in referring  to the objects one at a time. Thus,--         _Every_ town had its fair; _every_ village, its wake.--THACKERAY.         An arrow was quivering in _each_ body.--KINGSLEY.         Few on _either_ side but had their shrewd scratch to show.--_Id._         Before I taught my tongue to wound       My"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1401"],[0,"Tarzan the Untamed (#15)"],[1," revulsion  for her contemplated act surged through her. No, she could not  do it--yet, she must be free and she must regain possession of  the locket. And then, almost blindly, she swung the weapon up and  struck Tarzan heavily upon the back of the head with its butt. Like  a felled ox he dropped in his tracks.          Chapter VI    Vengeance and Mercy      It was an hour later that Sheeta, the panther, hunting, chanced to  glance upward into the blue sky where his attention was attracted  by Ska, the vulture, circling slowly above the bush a mile away and  downwind. For a long minute the yellow eyes stared intently at the  gruesome bird. They saw Ska dive and rise again to continue his  ominous circling and in these movements their woodcraft read that  which, while obvious to Sheeta, would doubtless have meant nothing  to you or me.    The hunting cat guessed that on the ground beneath Ska was some  living thing of flesh--either a beast feeding upon its kill or a  dying animal that Ska did not yet dare attack. In either event it  might prove meat for Sheeta, and so the wary feline stalked by a  circuitous route, upon soft, padded feet that gave forth no sound,  until the circling aasvogel and his intended prey were upwind. Then,  sniffing each vagrant zephyr, Sheeta, the panther, crept cautiously  forward, nor had he advanced any considerable distance before his  keen nostrils were rewarded with the scent of man--a Tarmangani.    Sheeta paused. He was not a hunter of men. He was young and in his  prime; but always before he had avoided this hated presence. Of  late he had become more accustomed to it with the passing of many  soldiers through his ancient hunting ground, and as the soldiers  had frightened away a great part of the game Sheeta had been wont  to feed upon, the days had been lean, and Sheeta was hungry.    The circling Ska suggested that this Tarmangani might be helpless  and upon the point of dying, else Ska would not have been interested  in him, and so easy prey for Sheeta. With this thought in mind the  cat resumed his stalking. Presently he pushed through the thick  bush and his yellow-green eyes rested gloatingly upon the body of  an almost naked Tarmangani lying face down in a narrow game trail.    Numa, sated, rose from the carcass of Bertha Kircher's horse and  seized the partially devoured body by the neck and dragged it into  the bush; then he started east toward the lair where he had left  his mate. Being uncomfortably full he was inclined to be sleepy  and far from belligerent. He moved slowly and majestically with no  effort at silence or concealment. The king walked abroad, unafraid.    With an occasional regal glance to right or left he moved along a  narrow game trail until at a turn he came to a sudden stop at what  lay revealed before him--Sheeta, the panther, creeping stealthily  upon the almost naked body of a Tarmangani lying face down in the  deep dust of the pathway.  Numa glared intently at the quiet body  in the dust. Recognition came. It was his Tarmangani. A low growl  of warning rumbled from his throat and Sheeta halted with one paw  upon Tarzan's back and turned suddenly to eye the intruder.    What passed within those savage brains? Who may say?  The panther  seemed debating the wisdom of defending his find, for he growled  horribly as though warning Numa away from the prey. And Numa? Was  the idea of property rights dominating his thoughts? The Tarmangani  was his, or he was the Tarmangani's. Had not the Great White Ape  mastered and subdued him and, too, had he not fed him? Numa recalled  the fear that he had felt of this man-thing and his cruel spear;  but in savage brains fear is more likely to engender respect than  hatred and so Numa found that he respected the creature who had  subdued and mastered him.  He saw Sheeta, upon whom he looked with  contempt, daring to molest the master of the lion. Jealousy and  greed alone might have been sufficient to prompt Numa to drive Sheeta  away, even though the lion was not sufficiently hungry to devour  the flesh that he thus wrested from the lesser cat; but then, too,  there was in the little brain within the massive head a sense of  loyalty, and perhaps this it was that sent Numa quickly forward,  growling, toward the spitting Sheeta.    For a moment the latter stood his ground with arched back and  snarling face, for all the world like a great, spotted tabby.    Numa had not felt like fighting; but the sight of Sheeta daring  to dispute his rights kindled his ferocious brain to sudden fire.  His rounded eyes glared with rage, his undulating tail snapped to  stiff erectness as, with a frightful roar, he charged this presuming  vassal.    It came so suddenly and from so short a distance that Sheeta had  no chance to turn and flee the rush, and so he met it with raking  talons and snapping jaws; but the odds were all against him. To  the larger fangs and the more powerful jaws of his adversary were  added huge talons and the preponderance of the lion's great weight.  At the first clash Sheeta was crushed and, though he deliberately  fell upon his back and drew up his powerful hind legs beneath Numa  with the intention of disemboweling him, the lion forestalled him  and at the same time closed his awful jaws upon Sheeta's throat.    It was soon over. Numa rose, shaking himself, and stood above the  torn and mutilated body of his foe. His own sleek coat was cut and  the red blood trickled down his flank; though it was but a minor  injury, it angered him. He glared down at the dead panther and  then, in a fit of rage, he seized and mauled the body only to drop  it in a moment, lower his head, voice a single terrific roar, and  turn toward the ape-man.    Approaching the still form he sniffed it over from head to foot.  Then he placed a huge paw upon it and turned it over with its face  up. Again he smelled about the body and at last with his rough tongue  licked Tarzan's face. It was then that Tarzan opened his eyes.    Above him towered the huge lion, its hot breath upon his face, its  rough tongue upon his cheek. The ape-man had often been close to  death; but never before so close as this, he thought, for he was  convinced that death was but a matter of seconds. His brain was  still numb from the effects of the blow that had felled him, and  so he did not, for a moment, recognize the lion that stood over  him as the one he had so recently encountered.    Presently, however, recognition dawned upon him and with it  a realization of the astounding fact that Numa did not seem bent  on devouring him--at least not immediately. His position was a  delicate one. The lion stood astraddle Tarzan with his front paws.  The ape-man could not rise, therefore, without pushing the lion away  and whether Numa would tolerate being pushed was an open question.  Too, the beast might consider him already dead and any movement that  indicated the contrary was true would, in all likelihood, arouse  the killing instinct of the man-eater.    But Tarzan was tiring of the situation. He was in no mood to lie  there forever, especially when he contemplated the fact that the  girl spy who had tried to brain him was undoubtedly escaping as  rapidly as possible.    Numa was looking right into his eyes now evidently aware that he was  alive. Presently the lion cocked his head on one side and whined.  Tarzan knew the note, and he knew that it spelled neither rage nor  hunger, and then he risked all on a single throw, encouraged by  that low whine.    \"Move, Numa!\" he commanded and placing a palm against the tawny  shoulder he pushed the lion aside. Then he rose and with a hand  on his hunting knife awaited that which might follow. It was then  that his eyes fell for the first time on the torn body of Sheeta.  He looked from the dead cat to the live one and saw the marks of  conflict upon the latter, too, and in an instant realized something  of what had happened--Numa had saved him from the panther!    It seemed incredible and yet the evidence pointed clearly to the  fact. He turned toward the lion and without fear approached and  examined his wounds which he found superficial, and as Tarzan knelt  beside him Numa rubbed an itching ear against the naked, brown  shoulder. Then the ape-man stroked the great head, picked up his  spear, and looked about for the trail of the girl. This he soon  found leading toward the east, and as he set out upon it something  prompted him to feel for the locket he had hung about his neck. It  was gone!    No trace of anger was apparent upon the ape-man's face unless it  was a slight tightening of the jaws; but he put his hand ruefully  to the back of his head where a bump marked the place where the  girl had struck him and a moment later a half-smile played across  his lips. He could not help but admit that she had tricked him  neatly, and that it must have taken nerve to do the thing she did  and to set out armed only with a pistol through the trackless waste  that lay between them and the railway and beyond into the hills  where Wilhelmstal lies.    Tarzan admired courage. He was big enough to admit it and admire  it even in a German spy, but he saw that in this case it only added  to her resourcefulness and made her all the more dangerous and the  necessity for putting her out of the way paramount. He hoped to  overtake her before she reached Wilhelmstal and so he set out at  the swinging trot that he could hold for hours at a stretch without  apparent fatigue.    That the girl could hope to reach the town on foot in less than two  days seemed improbable, for it was a good thirty miles and part  of it hilly. Even as the thought crossed his mind he heard the  whistle of a locomotive to the east and knew that the railway was  in operation again after a shutdown of several days. If the train  was going south the girl would signal it if she had reached the  right of way. His keen ears caught the whining of brake shoes"]]]
