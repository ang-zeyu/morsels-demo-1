Life hasn't changed for  the conservative families of blood.... Try to understand, Margaret,  that you must marry and marry well. You're nobody without money. In  society there are hundreds of girls like you, though few so  attractive. That's all the more reason you should take the best chance  you have, before it's lost. If you don't marry people will say you  can't. They'll say you're fading, growing old, even if you grow  prettier every day of your life, and in the end they'll make you a  miserable old maid. Then you'll be glad to marry anybody. If you marry  now you can help your father, who needs help badly enough. You can  help poor Blair.... You can be a leader in society; you can have a  house here, a cottage at the seashore and one in the mountains;  everything a girl's heart yearns for--servants, horses, autos, gowns,  diamonds----\"    \"Everything except love,\" interrupted Margaret, bitterly.    Mrs. Maynard actually flushed, but she kept her temper.    \"It's desirable that you love your husband. Any sensible woman can  learn to care for a man. Love, as you dream about it is merely a--a  dream. If women waited for that they would never get married.\"    \"Which would be preferable to living without love.\"    \"But Margaret, what would become of the world? If there were fewer  marriages--Heaven knows they're few enough nowadays--there would be  fewer families--and in the end fewer children--less and less----\"    \"They'd be better children,\" said Margaret, calmly.    \"Eventually the race would die out.\"    \"And that'd be a good thing--if the people can't love each other.\"    \"How silly--exasperating!\" ejaculated Mrs. Maynard. \"You don't mean  such nonsense. What any girl wants is a home of her own, a man to fuss  over. I didn't marry for love, as you dream it. My husband attended to  his business and I've looked after his household. You've had every  advantage. I flatter myself our marriage has been a success.\"    Margaret's eyes gleamed like pointed flames.    \"I differ with you. Your married life hasn't been successful any more  than it's been happy. You never cared for father. You haven't been  kind to him since his failure.\"    Mrs. Maynard waved her hand imperiously in angry amaze.    \"I won't stop. I'm not a baby or a doll,\" went on Margaret,  passionately. \"If I'm old enough to marry I'm old enough to talk. I  can think, can't I? You never told me anything, but I could see. Ever  since I can remember you and father have had one continual wrangle  about money--bills--expenses. Perhaps I'd have been better off without  all the advantages and luxury. It's because of these things you want  to throw me at some man. I'd far rather go to work the same as Blaid  did, instead of college.\"    \"Whatever on earth has come over you?\" gasped Mrs. Maynard,  bewildered by the revolt of this once meek daughter.    \"Maybe I'm learning a little sense. Maybe I got some of it from Daren  Lane,\" flashed back Margaret.    \"Mother, whatever I've learned lately has been learned away from home.  You've no more idea what's going on in the world to-day than if you  were actually dead. I never was bright like Mel Iden, but I'm no fool.  I see and hear and I read. Girls aren't pieces of furniture to be  handed out to some rich men. Girls are waking up. They can do things.  They can be independent. And being independent doesn't mean a girl's  not going to marry. For she can wait--wait for the right man--for  love.... You say I dream. Well, why didn't you wake me up long  ago--with the truth? I had my dreams about love and marriage. And I've  learned that love and marriage are vastly different from what most  mothers make them out to be, or let a girl think.\"    \"Margaret, I'll not have you talk in this strange way. You owe me  respect if not obedience,\" said Mrs. Maynard, her voice trembling.    \"Oh, well, I won't say any more,\" replied Margaret, \"But can't you  spare me? Couldn't we live within our means?\"    \"After all these years--to skimp along! I couldn't endure it.\"    \"Whom have you in mind for me to--to marry?\" asked the girl, coldly  curious.    \"Mr. Swann has asked your hand in marriage for his son Richard. He  wants Richard to settle down. Richard is wild, like all these young  men. And I have--well, I encouraged the plan.\"    \"_Mother!_\" cried Margaret, springing up.    \"Margaret, you will see\"    \"I despise Dick Swann.\"    \"Why?\" asked her mother.    \"I just do. I never liked him in school. He used to do such mean  things. He's selfish. He let Holt and Daren suffer for his tricks.\"    \"Margaret, you talk like a child.\"    \"Listen, mother.\" She threw her arms round Mrs. Maynard and kissed her  and spoke pleadingly. \"Oh, don't make me hate myself. It seems I've  grown so much older in the last year or so--and lately since this  marriage talk came up. I've thought of things as never before because  I've--I've learned about them. I see so differently. I can't--can't  love Dick Swann. I can't bear to have him touch me. He's rude. He  takes liberties.... He's too free with his hands! Why, it'd be wrong  to marry him. What difference can a marriage service make in a girl's  feelings.... Mother, let me say no.\"    \"Lord spare me from bringing up another girl!\" exclaimed Mrs. Maynard.  \"Margaret, I can't make you marry Richard Swann. I'm simply trying to  tell you what any sensible girl would see she had to do. You think it  over--both sides of the question--before you absolutely decide.\"    Mrs. Maynard was glad to end the discussion and to get away. In  Margaret's appeal she heard a yielding, a final obedience to her wish.  And she thought she had better let well enough alone. The look in  Margaret's clear blue eyes made her shrink; it would haunt her. But  she felt no remorse. Any mother would have done the same. There was  always the danger of that old love affair; there was new danger in  these strange wild fancies of modern girls; there was never any  telling what Margaret might do. But once married she would be safe and  her position assured.          CHAPTER VII      Daren Lane left Riverside Park, and walked in the meadows until he  came to a boulder under a huge chestnut tree. Here he sat down. He  could not walk far these days. Many a time in the Indian summers long  past he had gathered chestnuts there with Dal, with Mel Iden, with  Helen. He would never do it again.    The April day had been warm and fresh with the opening of a late  spring. The sun was now gold--rimming the low hills in the west; the  sky was pale blue; the spring flowers whitened the meadow. Twilight  began to deepen; the evening star twinkled out of the sky; the hush of  the gloaming hour stole over the land.    \"Four weeks home--and nothing done. So little time left!\" he muttered.    Two weeks of that period he had been unable to leave his bed. The rest  of the time he had dragged himself around, trying to live up to his  resolve, to get at the meaning of the present, to turn his sister  Lorna from the path of dalliance. And he had failed in all.    His sister presented the problem that most distressed Lane. She had  her good qualities, and through them could be reached. But she was  thoughtless, vacillating, and wilful. She had made him promises only  to break them. Lane had caught her in falsehoods. And upon being  called to account she had told him that if he didn't like it he could  \"lump\" it. Of late she had grown away from what affection she had  shown at first. She could not bear interference with her pleasures,  and seemed uncontrollable. Lane felt baffled. This thing was a  Juggernaut impossible to stop.    Lane had scraped acquaintance with Harry Hale, one of Lorna's  admirers, a boy of eighteen, who lived with his widowed mother on the  edge of the town. He appeared to be an industrious, intelligent, quiet  fellow, not much given to the prevailing habits of the young people.  In his humble worship of Lorna he was like a dog. Lorna went to the  motion pictures with him occasionally, when she had no other  opportunity for excitement. Lane gathered that Lorna really liked this  boy, and when with him seemed more natural, more what a  fifteen-year-old girl used to be. And somehow it was upon this boy  that Lane placed a forlorn hope.    No more automobiles honked in front of the home to call Lorna out. She  met her friends away from the house, and returning at night she walked  the last few blocks. It was this fact that awoke Lane's serious  suspicions.    Another problem lay upon Lane's heart; if not so distressing as  Lorna's, still one that added to his sorrow and his perplexity. He had  gone once to call on Mel Iden. Mel Iden was all soul. Whatever had  been the facts of her downfall--and reflection on that hurt Lane so  strangely he could not bear it--it had not been on her part a matter  of sex. She was far above wantonness.    Through long hours in the dark of night, when Lane's pain kept him  sleepless, he had pondered over the mystery of Mel Iden until it  cleared. She typified the mother of the race. In all periods of the  progress of the race, war had brought out this instinct in women--to  give themselves for the future. It was a provision of nature,  inscrutable and terrible. How immeasurable the distance between Mel  Iden and those women who practised birth control! As the war had  brought out hideous greed and baseness, so had it propelled forward  and upward the noblest attributes of life. Mel Iden was a builder, not  a destroyer. She had been sexless and selfless.

Another thing that stumbled me here was the variation, which, at this  time, by the last amplitude I had found to be but 7 degrees 58 minutes  west, whereas the variation at the Cape (from which I found myself not 30  leagues distant) was then computed, and truly, about 11 degrees or more:  and yet a while after this, when I was got 10 leagues to the eastward of  the Cape, I found the variation but 10 degrees 40 minutes west, whereas  it should have been rather more than at the Cape. These things, I  confess, did puzzle me: neither was I fully satisfied as to the exactness  of the taking the variation at sea: for in a great sea, which we often  meet with, the compass will traverse with the motion of the ship; besides  the ship may and will deviate somewhat in steering, even by the best  helmsmen: and then when you come to take an azimuth there is often some  difference between him that looks at the compass and the man that takes  the altitude height of the sun; and a small error in each, if the error  of both should be one way, will make it wide of any great exactness. But  what was most shocking to me, I found that the variation did not always  increase or decrease in proportion to the degrees of longitude east or  west; as I had a notion they might do to a certain number of degrees of  variation east or west, at such or such particular meridians. But,  finding in this voyage that the difference of variation did not bear a  regular proportion to the difference of longitude, I was much pleased to  see it thus observed in a scheme shown me after my return home, wherein  are represented the several variations in the Atlantic Sea, on both sides  of the equator, and there the line of no variation in that sea is not a  meridian line, but goes very oblique, as do those also which show the  increase of variation on each side of it. In that chart there is so large  an advance made as well towards the accounting for those seemingly  irregular increases and decreases of variation towards the south-east  coast of America as towards the fixing a general scheme or system of the  variation everywhere, which would be of such great use in navigation,  that I cannot but hope that the ingenious author, Captain Halley, who to  his profound skill in all theories of these kinds, hath added and is  adding continually personal experiments, will e'er long oblige the world  with a fuller discovery of the course of the variation, which hath  hitherto been a secret. For my part I profess myself unqualified for  offering at anything of a general scheme; but since matter of fact, and  whatever increases the history of the variation, may be of use towards  the settling or confirming the theory of it, I shall here once for all  insert a table of all the variations I observed beyond the equator in  this voyage, both in going out and returning back; and what errors there  may be in it I shall leave to be corrected by the observations of others.    (A TABLE OF VARIATIONS.)    OCCURRENCES NEAR THE CAPE; AND THE AUTHOR'S PASSING BY IT.    But to return from this digression: having fair weather and the winds  hanging southerly I jogged on to the eastward to make the Cape. On the  third of June we saw a sail to leeward of us, showing English colours. I  bore away to speak with her, and found her to be the Antelope of London,  commanded by Captain Hammond, and bound for the Bay of Bengal in the  service of the New-East-India Company. There were many passengers aboard,  going to settle there under Sir Edward Littleton, who was going chief  thither: I went aboard and was known by Sir Edward and Mr. Hedges, and  kindly received and treated by them and the commander; who had been  afraid of us before, though I had sent one of my officers aboard. They  had been in at the Cape, and came from thence the day before, having  stocked themselves with refreshments. They told me that they were by  reckoning 60 miles to the west of the Cape. While I was aboard them a  fine small westerly wind sprang up; therefore I shortened my stay with  them because I did not design to go in to the Cape. When I took leave I  was presented with half a mutton, 12 cabbages, 12 pumpkins, 6 pound of  butter, 6 couple of stock-fish, and a quantity of parsnips; sending them  some oatmeal which they wanted.    From my first setting out from England I did not design to touch at the  Cape; and that was one reason why I touched at Brazil, that there I might  refresh my men and prepare them for a long run to New Holland. We had not  yet seen the land, but about 2 in the afternoon we saw the Cape land  bearing east at about 16 leagues distance: and, Captain Hammond being  also bound to double the Cape, we jogged on together this afternoon and  the next day, and had several fair sights of it; which may be seen.    OF THE WESTERLY WINDS BEYOND IT: A STORM, AND ITS PRESAGES.    To proceed: having still a westerly wind I jogged on in company with the  Antelope till Sunday June the 4th, at 4 in the afternoon, when we parted;  they steering away for the East Indies and I keeping an east-south-east  course, the better to make my way for New Holland: for though New Holland  lies north-easterly from the Cape yet all ships bound towards the coast,  or the Straits of Sunda, ought to keep for a while in the same parallel,  or in a latitude between 35 and 40, at least a little to the south of the  east, that they may continue in a variable winds way; and not venture too  soon to stand so far to the north as to be within the verge of the  tradewind, which will put them by their easterly course. The wind  increased upon us; but we had yet sight of the Antelope, and of the land  too, till Tuesday the 6th June: and then we saw also by us an innumerable  company of fowls of divers sorts; so that we looked about to see if there  were not another dead whale, but saw none.    The night before, the sun set in a black cloud, which appeared just like  land, and the clouds above it were gilded of a dark red colour. And on  the Tuesday, as the sun drew near the horizon, the clouds were gilded  very prettily to the eye, though at the same time my mind dreaded the  consequences of it. When the sun was now not above 2 degrees high it  entered into a dark smoky-coloured cloud that lay parallel with the  horizon, from whence presently seemed to issue many dusky blackish beams.  The sky was at this time covered with small hard clouds (as we call such  a lie scattering about, not likely to rain) very thick one by another;  and such of them as lay next to the bank of clouds at the horizon were of  a pure gold colour to 3 or 4 degrees high above the bank. From these to  about 10 degrees high they were redder and very bright; above them they  were of a darker colour still, to about 60 or 70 degrees high, where the  clouds began to be of their common colour. I took the more particular  notice of all this because I have generally observed such coloured clouds  to appear before an approaching storm: and, this being winter here and  the time for bad weather, I expected and provided for a violent blast of  wind by reefing our topsails, and giving a strict charge to my officers  to hand them or take them in if the wind should grow stronger. The wind  was now at west-north-west a very brisk gale. About 12 o'clock at night  we had a pale whitish glare in the north-west which was another sign, and  intimated the storm be near at hand; and, the wind increasing upon it, we  presently handed our topsails, furled the mainsail, and went away only  with our foresail. Before 2 in the morning it came on very fierce, and we  kept right before wind and sea, the wind still increasing: but the ship  was very governable, and steered incomparably well. At 8 in the morning  we settled our foreyard, lowering it 4 or 5 foot, and we ran very  swiftly; especially when the squalls of rain or hail from a black cloud  came overhead, for then it blew excessive hard. These, though they did  not last long, yet came very thick and fast one after another. The sea  also ran very high; but we running so violently before wind and sea we  shipped little or no water; though a little washed into our upper deck  ports; and with it a scuttle or cuttlefish was cast up on the carriage of  a gun.    The wind blew extraordinary hard all Wednesday the 7th of June but abated  of its fierceness before night: yet it continued a brisk gale till about  the 16th, and still a moderate one till the 19th day; by which time we  had run about 600 leagues: for the most part of which time the wind was  in some point of the west, namely from the west-north-west to the south  by west. It blew hardest when at west or between the west and south-west,  but after it veered more southerly the foul weather broke up: this I  observed at other times also in these seas, that when the storms at west  veered to the southward they grew less; and that when the wind came to  the east of the south we had still smaller gales, calms, and fair  weather. As for the westerly winds on that side the Cape, we like them  never the worse for being violent, for they drive us the faster to the  eastward; and are therefore the only winds coveted by those who sail  towards such parts of the East Indies as lie south of the equator; as  Timor, Java, and Sumatra; and by the ships bound for China, or any other  that are to pass through the Straits of Sunda. Those ships having once  passed the Cape keep commonly pretty far southerly, on purpose "]]]
