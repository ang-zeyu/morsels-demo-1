A thousand other saints whom Amphibal had taught ...    Were slain where Lichfield is, whose name doth rightly sound    (There of those Christians slain), \"Dead-field\" or burying-ground.    Drayton, _Polyolbion_, xxiv. (1622).    AMPHI'ON is said to have built Thebes by the music of his lute.  Tennyson has a poem called _Amphion_, a skit and rhyming _jeu  d'esprit_.      Amphion there the loud creating lyre    Strikes, and behold a sudden Thebes aspire.    Pope, _Temple of Fame_.    AMPHIS-BAENA, a reptile which could go head foremost either way,  because it had a head at each extremity. Milton uses the word in  _Paradise Lost_, x. 524. (Greek, _ampi baino_, \"I go both ways.\")      The amphis-baena doubly armed appears,    At either end a threatening head she rears.    Rowe, _Pharsalia_, ix. 696, etc. (by Lucan).    AMPHITRYON, a Theban general, husband of Alcme'ne (3 _syl._). While  Amphitryon was absent at war with Pter'elas, king of the Tel'eboans,  Jupiter assumed his form, and visited Alcmene, who in due time became  the mother of Her'cules. Next day Amphitryon returned, having slain  Pterelas, and Alcmene was surprised to see him so soon again. Here a  great entanglement arose, Alcmene telling her husband he visited her  last night, and showing him the ring he gave her, and Amphitryon  declaring he was with the army. This confusion is still further  increased by his slave Sos'ia, who went to take to Alcmene the news of  victory, but was stopped at the door of the house by Mercury, who had  assumed for the nonce Sosia's form, and the slave could not make out  whether he was himself or not. This plot has been made a comedy by  Plautus, Moliere, and Dryden.      The scenes which Plautus drew, to-night we show,    Touched by Moliere, by Dryden taught to glow.      _Prologue to Hawksworth's version_.      As an Amphitryon _chez qui l'on dine_, no one knows better than Ouida  the uses of a _recherche_ dinner.--E. Yates, _Celebrities_, xix.      \"_Amphitryon_\": _Le veritable Amphitryon est l'Amphitryon ou l'on  dine_ (\"The master of the feast is the master of the house\"). While  the confusion was at its height between the false and true Amphitryon,  _Socie_ [Sosia] the slave is requested to decide which was which, and  replied--      Je ne me trompois pas, messieurs; ce mot termine    Toute l'irresolution;    Le veritable Amphitryon    Est l'Amphitryon ou l'on dine.      Moliere, _Amphitryon_, iii. 5 (1668).      Demosthenes and Cicero    Are doubtless stately names to hear,    But that of good Amphitryon    Sounds far more pleasant to my ear.      M.A. Desaugiers (1772-1827).    AMRAH, the faithful woman-servant of the household of Ben-Hur in Lew  Wallace's novel, _Ben-Hur_. Through her heroic services, Judah,  the son, finds the mother and sister from whom he has been so long  separated (1880).    AM'RI, in _Absalom and Achitophel_, by Dryden and Tate, is Heneage  Finch, earl of Nottingham and lord chancellor. He is called \"The  Father of Equity\" (1621-1682).      To whom the double blessing did belong,    With Moses' inspiration, Aaron's tongue.    Part ii.    AMUN'DEVILLE (_Lord Henry_), one of the \"British privy council.\" After  the sessions of parliament he retired to his country seat, where he  entertained a select and numerous party, among which were the duchess  of Fitz-Fulke, Aurora Raby, and don Juan, \"the Russian envoy.\"  His wife was lady Adeline. (His character is given in xiv. 70,  71.)--Byron, _Don Juan_, xiii. to end.    AM'URATH III., sixth emperor of the Turks. He succeeded his father,  Selim II., and reigned 1574-1595. His first act was to invite all his  brothers to a banquet, and strangle them. Henry IV. alludes to this  when he says--      This is the English, not the Turkish court;    Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,    But Harry, Harry.    Shakespeare, 2 _Henry IV._ act v. sc. 2 (1598).    AMUSEMENTS OF KINGS. The great amusement of _Ardeltas_ of Arabia  Petraea, was currying horses; of _Artaba'nus_ of Persia, was  mole-catching; of _Domitian_ of Rome, was catching flies; of  _Ferdinand VII._, of Spain, was embroidering petticoats; of _Louis  XVI._, clock and lock making; of _George IV._, the game of patience.    AMY MARCH, the artist sister in Louisa M. Alcott's _Little Women_  (1868).    AMY WENTWORTH, the high-born but contented wife of the \"Brown Viking  of the Fishing-smack,\" in John Greenleaf Whittier's poem, _Amy  Wentworth_.      She sings, and smiling, hears her praise,    But dreams the while of one    Who watches from his sea-blown deck    The ice-bergs in the sun.    (1860.)    AMYN'TAS, in _Colin Clout's Come Home Again_, by Spenser, is  Ferdinando earl of Derby, who died 1594.      Amyntas, flower of shepherd's pride forlorn.    He, whilst he lived, was the noblest swain    That ever piped on an oaten quill.    Spenser, _Colin Clout's Come Home Again_ (1591).    AMYN'TOR. (See AMINTOR.)    A'MYS and AMY'LION, the Damon and Pythias of mediaeval romance.--See  Ellis's _Specimens of Early English Metrical Romances_.    AMYTIS, the Median queen of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.  Beautiful, passionate, and conscienceless, she condemns an innocent  rival to the worst of fates, without a pang of conscience, and dies a  violent death at the hands of one who was once her lover.    The gardens were well-watered and dripped luxuriantly.... At this time  of the morning, Amytis amused herself alone, or with a few favored  slaves. She dipped through artificial dew and pollen, bloom and  fountain, like one of the butterflies that circled above her small  head, or one of the bright cold lizards that crept about her feet. She  bathed, she ran, she sang, and curled to sleep, and stirred and bathed  again.--_The Master of the Magicians_, by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps and  Herbert D. Ward (1890).    ANACHARSIS [CLOOTZ]. Baron Jean Baptiste Clootz assumed the _prenome_  of Anacharsis, from the Scythian so called, who travelled about  Greece and other countries to gather knowledge and improve his own  countrymen. The baron wished by the name to intimate that his own  object in life was like that of Anacharsis (1755-1794).    ANACHRONISMS. (See ERRORS.)    CHAUCER, in his tale of _Troilus_, at the siege of Troy, makes  Pandarus refer to _Robin Hood_.      And to himselfe ful soberly he saied,    From hasellwood there jolly Robin plaied.    Book v.    GILES FLETCHER, in _Christ's Victory_, pt. ii. makes the Tempter  seem to be \"a good old _hermit_ or _palmer_, travelling to see some  _saint_, and _telling his beads!!_\"    LODGE, in _The True Tragedies of Marius and Sylla_ (1594), mentions  \"the razor of Palermo\" and \"St. Paul's steeple,\" and introduces  Frenchmen who \"for forty crowns\" undertake to poison the Roman consul.    MORGLAY makes Dido tell AEneas that she should have been contented with  a son, even \"if he had been a _cockney dandiprat_\" (1582).    SCHILLER, in his _Piccolomini_, speaks of _lightning conductors_. This  was about 150 years before they were invented.    SHAKESPEAKE, in his _Coriolanus_ (act ii. sc. 1), makes Menenius refer  to _Galen_ above 600 years before he was born.    Cominius alludes to _Roman Plays_, but no such things were known for  250 years after the death of Cominius.--_Coriolanus_, act ii. sc. 2.    Brutus refers to the \"_Marcian Waters_ brought to Rome by Censorinus.\"  This was not done till 300 years afterwards.    In _Hamlet_, the prince Hamlet was educated at _Wittemberg School_,  which was not founded till 1502; whereas Saxo-Germanicus, from whom  Shakespeare borrowed the tale, died in 1204. Hamlet was thirty years  old when his mother talks of his going back to school (act i. sc. 2).    In 1 _Henry IV._, the carrier complains that \"the _turkeys_ in his  pannier are quite starved\" (act ii. sc. 5), whereas turkeys came from  America, and the New World was not even discovered for a century  after. Again in _Henry V._, Grower is made to say to Fluellen, \"Here  comes Pistol, swelling like a turkey-cock\" (act v. sc. 1).    In _Julius Caesar_, Brutus says to Cassius, \"Peace, count the clock.\"  To which Cassius replies, \"The clock has stricken three.\"    Clocks were not known to the Romans, and striking-clocks were not  invented till some 1400 years after the death of Caesar.    VIRGIL places AEneas in the port Velinus, which was made by Curius  Dentatus.    This list, with very little trouble, might be greatly multiplied. The  hotbed of anachronisms is mediaeval romance; there nations, times and  places, are most recklessly disregarded. This may be instanced by a  few examples from Ariosto's great poem, _Orlando Furioso_.    Here we have Charlemagne and his paladins joined by Edward king of  England, Richard earl of Warwick, Henry duke of Clarence, and the  dukes of York and Gloucester (bk. vi.). We have cannons employed by  Cymosco king of Friza (bk. iv.), and also in the siege of Paris (bk.  vi.). We have the Moors established in Spain, whereas they were not  invited over by the Saracens for nearly 300 years after Charlemagne's  death. In bk. xvii. we have Prester John, who died in 1202; and in the  last three books we have Constantine the Great, who died in 337.    ANAC'REON, the prince of erotic and bacchanalian poets, insomuch that  songs on these subjects are still called Anacreon'tic (B.C. 563-478).    _Anacreon of Painters_, Francesco Albano or Alba'ni (1578-1660).    _Anacreon of the Guillotine_, Bertrand Barere de Vieuzac (1755-1841).    _Anacreon of the Temple_, Guillaume Amfrye, abbe de Chaulieu  (1639-1720).    _Anacreon of the Twelfth Century_, Walter Mapes, \"The Jovial Toper.\"  His famous drinking song, \"Meum est prepositum ...\" has been  translated by Leigh Hunt (1150-1196).    _The French Anacreon_. 1. Pontus de Thiard, one of the \"Pleiad  poets\" (1521-1605). 2. P. Laujon, perpetual president of the _Caveau"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11440"],[0,"Tales of Three Hemispheres (#15)"],[1," old was I?  It is perfectly  clear that Time moves over the Lands of Dream swifter or slower than  over the fields we know.  For the dead, and the long dead, live again  in our dreams; and a dreamer passes through the events of days in a  single moment of the Town-Hall's clock.  Yet logic did not aid me and  my mind was puzzled.  While the old man slept--and strangely like in  face he was to the old man who had shown me first the little, old  backdoor--I went to the far end of his wattled shop.  There was a door  of a sort on leather hinges.  I pushed it open and there I was again  under the notice-board at the back of the shop, at least the back of  Go-by Street had not changed. Fantastic and remote though this grass  street was with its purple flowers and the golden spires, and the  world ending at its opposite pavement, yet I breathed more happily to  see something again that I had seen before.  I thought I had lost  forever the world I knew, and now that I was at the back of Go-by  Street again I felt the loss less than when I was standing where  familiar things ought to be; and I turned my mind to what was left me  in the vast Lands of Dream and thought of Saranoora.  And when I saw  the cottages again I felt less lonely even at the thought of the cat  though he generally laughed at the things I said.  And the first thing  that I saw when I saw the witch was that I had lost the world and was  going back for the rest of my days to the palace of Singanee.  And the  first thing that she said was: \"Why!  You've been through the wrong  door,\" quite kindly for she saw how unhappy I looked.  And I said,  \"Yes, but it's all the same street. The whole street's altered and  London's gone and the people I used to know and the houses I used to  rest in, and everything; and I'm tired.\"    \"What did you want to go through the wrong door for?\" she said.    \"O, that made no difference,\" I said.    \"O, didn't it?\" she said in a contradictory way.    \"Well I wanted to get to the near end of the street so as to find my  boat quickly by the Embankment.  And now my boat, and the Embankment  and--and----.\"    \"Some people are always in such a hurry,\" said the old black cat. And  I felt too unhappy to be angry and I said nothing more.    And the old witch said, \"Now which way do you want to go?\" and she was  talking rather like a nurse to a small child.  And I said, \"I have  nowhere to go.\"    And she said, \"Would you rather go home or go to the ivory palace of  Singanee.\"  And I said, \"I've got a headache, and I don't want to go  anywhere, and I'm tired of the Lands of Dream.\"    \"Then suppose you try going in through the right door,\" she said.    \"That's no good,\" I said.  \"Everyone's dead and gone, and they're  selling buns there.\"    \"What do you know about Time?\" she said.    \"Nothing,\" answered the old, black cat, though nobody spoke to him.    \"Run along,\" said the old witch.    So I turned and trudged away to Go-by Street again.  I was very tired.  \"What does he know about anything?\" said the old black cat behind me.  I knew what he was going to say next.  He waited a moment and then  said, \"Nothing.\"  When I looked over my shoulder he was strutting back  to the cottage.  And when I got to Go-by Street I listlessly opened  the door through which I had just now come.  I saw no use in doing it,  I just did wearily as I was told.  And the moment I got inside I saw  it was just the same as of old, and the sleepy old man was there who  sold idols.  And I bought a vulgar thing that I did not want, for the  sheer joy of seeing accustomed things.  And when I turned from Go-by  Street which was just the same as ever, the first thing that I saw was  a taximeter running into a hansom cab.  And I took off my hat and  cheered.  And I went to the Embankment and there was my boat, and the  stately river full of dirty, accustomed things. And I rowed back and  bought a penny paper, (I had been away it seemed for one day) and I  read it from cover to cover--patent remedies for incurable illnesses  and all--and I determined to walk, as soon as I was rested, in all the  streets that I knew and to call on all the people that I had ever met,  and to be content for long with the fields we know."]]]
