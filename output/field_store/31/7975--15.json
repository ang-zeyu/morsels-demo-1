She turned as though about to take the envelope from  Grace, but the latter had already opened it, and unfolding the paper began  reading the contents aloud.    \"Dear Grace,\" she read, \"after a meeting to-day of the members of the  regular and substitute sophomore basketball teams, it was decided that  your resignation as captain of the same be requested.    \"We are sorry to do this, but we believe it is for the good of the team.  We feel that you cannot be loyal to its interests as long as you persist  in being a friend of one of its enemies.\"    The names of the players, with the exception of Nora's and Miriam's, were  signed to this communication.    After she had finished reading Grace stood perfectly still, looking  searchingly into the faces of her classmates. She was trying to gain her  self-control before speaking to them.    She could hardly realize that her own team had dealt this cruel blow. For  the first time in her life she had received a real shock. She took a long  deep breath and clenched her hands. She did not wish to break down before  she had spoken what was in her mind.    Nora was muttering angrily to herself. Jessica looked ready to cry, while  Anne, pale and resolute, came over and stood by Grace. She felt that she  had been the primary cause of the whole trouble. She had borne the girls'  unjust treatment of herself in silence, but, now, they had visited their  displeasure upon Grace, and that was not to be borne.    \"How dared you do such a despicable thing?\" she cried. \"You are cruel,  unfeeling, and oh, so unjust. You accused me of something I would scorn  to do, and not satisfied with that, visited your petty spite upon a girl  who is the soul of truth and honor. You may say what you choose about me,  but you shall not hurt Grace, and if you don't immediately retract what  you have written I will take measures which may prove most unpleasant to  all of you.\"    Just what Anne intended to do she did not know, but her outburst had its  effect on the conspirators, and they squirmed uneasily under the lash of  her words. Perhaps, they had misjudged this slender, dark-eyed girl after  all.    Before Anne could say more, Grace spoke quietly.    \"Sit down, all of you,\" she said at last, with a sweetness and dignity  that was remarkable in so young a girl. \"I have something to say to you.  It is curious,\" she went on, \"that I was just talking about our basketball  team when you came into the room. I had said to Nora, Jessica and Anne  that I wanted more than anything else in the world to beat the junior  team. Miss Thompson had been praising the team to me, and I said to the  girls that I thought I loved it just as a mother loves her daughters.  There is no sacrifice I wouldn't make to keep up the team's good work, and  that is the reason why I am going to make a sacrifice, now, and decline  to resign. If I had been a poor captain, you would have had a right to  ask for my resignation But I haven't. I have been a good, hard-working,  conscientious captain, and I have made a success of the team. None of you  can deny it. If you took a new captain at this stage it might ruin  everything, and I tell you I have thought too much about it; I have set my  heart on it so firmly that it would just break if we lost the deciding  game.\"    Her voice broke a little. Nora was sobbing openly. It was hard work for  Grace to control her own tears.    \"Of course,\" she went on, clearing her throat and raising her voice to  steady it, \"it will be a sacrifice for me to keep on being your captain  when you don't want me. It's no fun, I can assure you. Perhaps none of you  has ever felt the hurt that comes of being turned out by people who were  once fond of you. I hope you never will. I am still fond of all of you,  and some day, perhaps, you will see that you have made a mistake. At any  rate, I decline to resign my place. It was given to me for the year, and I  won't give it up.\"    Grace turned her back and walked to the window. She had come at last to  the end of her strength. She leaned against the window jamb and wept  bitterly.    But the address of Mark Anthony over the dead body of Caesar was not more  effective than this simple schoolgirl's speech. Every girl there melted  into tears of remorse and sympathy.    \"Oh, Grace,\" cried Marian Barber, \"won't you forgive us? We never dreamed  it would hurt you so. Now that I look back upon it, I can't see how we  could have asked you to do it. We did believe that Miss Pierson betrayed  us; but after all, that had nothing to do with your being captain of the  team. I think you have been a great deal more loyal than we have. I want  to say right here, girls, that I apologize to Grace and scratch my name  off the list.\"    She took a pencil, dashing it through her signature, which was the first  one on the letter.    One by one each of the other girls put a pencil stroke through her name.    Then they pinned on their hats, slipped into their coats and left the room  as quickly as possible. They were all desperately ashamed; each in her  secret heart wished she had never entered into the conspiracy.    They had given the captaincy to Grace, and after all, they had no right to  take away what they had freely given, and for no better reason than that  Grace was loyal to a friend whom they distrusted.    It was a cruel thing that they had done. They admitted it to each other  now, and wished they had never listened to Miriam Nesbit.    Speaking of Miriam, who was to tell her that she had not supplanted Grace  after all, as captain of the team.    \"You are all cowards,\" exclaimed Marian Barber still buoyed up by her  recent emotions, \"I am not afraid of Miriam, or anyone else, and I'll  undertake to tell her.\"    But at the last moment she determined to break the news by letter.    In the meantime, Miss Thompson had quietly entered the locker-room, where  Grace and her three chums were still standing.    \"Grace,\" said the principal, \"I was passing by and I could not help  overhearing what has been said, and while I don't care to enter into the  little private quarrels of my girls, I want to tell you that you made a  noble defense of your position. I am very proud of you, my child.\" Miss  Thompson put her arms around the weeping girl and kissed her. \"I wish  every girl in my school would make such a stand for her principles. You  were right not to have resigned. Always do what your judgment tells you is  right, no matter what the result is, and don't give up the captaincy!\"          CHAPTER XIII    A SKATING PARTY      The holidays had come and gone, and the pupils of Oakdale High School had  resigned themselves to a period of hard study. The dreaded mid-year  examinations stared them in the face, and for the time being basketball  ardor had cooled and a surprising devotion to study had ensued.    Since the day that Grace had refused to give up her captaincy there had  been considerable change in the girls' attitude toward her. She had not  regained her old-time popularity, but it was evident that her schoolmates  respected her for her brave decision and treated her with courtesy. They  still retained a feeling of suspicion toward Anne, however, although they  did not openly manifest it.    Miriam Nesbit had been inwardly furious over the outcome of her plan to  gain the captaincy, but she was wise enough to assume an air of  indifference over her defeat. Grace's speech had made considerable  impression on the minds of even Miriam's most devoted supporters and she  knew that the slightest slip on her part would turn the tide of opinion  against her.    Grace was in a more cheerful frame of mind than formerly. She felt that  all would come right some day. \"Truth crushed to earth shall rise again,\"  she told herself, and the familiar saying proved very comforting to her.    Winter had settled down on Oakdale as only a northern winter can do. There  had been snow on the ground since Thanksgiving, and sleigh rides and  skating parties were in order.    Grace awoke one Saturday morning in high good humor.    \"To-day's the day,\" she said to herself. \"Hurrah for skating!\"    She hurried through her breakfast and was donning her fur cap and sweater,  when Anne, Jessica and Nora, accompanied by David, Hippy, Reddy and, to  her surprise and delight, Tom Gray, turned in at her gate.        \"'Oh, be joyful, oh, be gay,        For there's skating on the bay,'\"    sang Hippy.    \"Meaning pond, I suppose,\" laughed Grace, as she opened her front door.    \"Meaning pond?\" answered Hippy, \"only pond doesn't rhyme with gay.\"    \"You might say,        \"'Oh, be joyful, oh, be fond,        For there's skating on the pond,'\"    suggested David.    \"Fond of what?\" demanded Hippy.    \"Of the person you've asked to skate with you,\" replied David, looking  toward Anne, who stood with a small pair of new skates tucked under her  arm.    \"I shall be initiated into all the mysteries of the world soon,\" she  observed, smiling happily. \"Last year it was coasting and football and now  it's dancing and skating. When I once get these things on, David, I'll be  like a bird trying its wings, I'll flop about just as helplessly.\"    \"I'm awfully glad to see you, Tom,\" said Grace, \"I did not expect to see  you until Easter.\"    \"Oh, I couldn't keep away,\" laughed Tom. \"This is the jolliest place I  know.\"    \"Good reason,\" said Reddy, \"we are the real people.\"    \"Stop praising yourself and listen to me,\" said Hippy. \"Our pond has  frozen over in the most obliging manner. It's as smooth as glass. Let's go  there to skate. There's a crowd of boys and girls on it already.\"    The pond on the Wingate estate was really a small lake, a mile or more in  circumference. While it froze over every winter, the ice was apt to be  rough, and there were often dangerous places in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15352"],[0,"Venereal Diseases in New Zealand (1922) (#15)"],[1,"of measles,  gonorrhoea is the most widely spread of all diseases. It is the most  potent factor in the production of involuntary race suicide, and by  sterilization and abortion does more to depopulate the country than does  any other cause.\"    In view of the facts brought out in the course of the inquiry, the  Committee are strongly of opinion that it would be criminal neglect to  allow the evil to go on without taking energetic steps to check its  ravages. They believe that the legislative and other measures which they  recommend for the medical prevention and treatment of venereal disease  will, if given effect to with the loyal co-operation of the medical  profession, have a very beneficial result in reducing the prevalence of  disease, and will save an incalculable amount of sorrow and suffering  which in too many cases falls upon the innocent. In what is proposed in  this report there is nothing approaching a revival of the old Contagious  Diseases Acts. To use the words of Dr. Emily Seideberg, the principle of  the legislation now proposed is \"To improve the health of the community,  and not, as in the old Contagious Diseases Acts, to make sexual  immorality safe for men of low morals.\"    The Committee are of opinion that, far from conditional notification and  compulsory treatment on the lines proposed being prejudicial to woman in  any way, it is they who will reap the greatest benefit from these  measures. In fact, sufferers from venereal disease, as a whole, have  everything to gain and nothing to lose so long as they will continue  under treatment, and to enable them to do this the best medical skill is  placed at their disposal free of cost. The only persons in the community  who will be penalized by the proposed legislation are those who, having  contracted venereal disease, are so reckless and unprincipled that they  will take no pains to avoid communicating it to others.    The Committee, it will be seen, regard the legislative and medical  measures which they propose as of great importance, but with all the  earnestness at their command they desire in conclusion to emphasize the  moral and social aspects of the question. With the changing social  conditions, especially in the larger towns, we are losing the home  influence and home training which are the best safeguards to preserve  the young against the temptations and dangers which beset their path in  life. The Committee would impress upon parents the paramount duty they  owe to their children in this matter. There is also a duty cast upon all  leaders of public opinion, and upon the community at large, to do what  is possible to bring about better living-conditions, especially for  girls in the towns, to encourage all forms of healthy sport and  amusement, and to cultivate a higher moral standard. Whatever sanitary  laws may be passed, and whatever success may be attained in dealing with  bodily disease, there can be no true health if the soul of the nation  remains corrupt. If this inquiry should serve to remove some of the  popular ignorance regarding venereal disease, and to quicken the public  conscience so that appropriate steps may be taken to deal with this  dreadful scourge, the Committee feel that their labours will not have  been in vain.
