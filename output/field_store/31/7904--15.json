Scott,         \"puts his goods on board a ship of force, which will be       defended by force, he betrays an intention to resist       visitation and search, and so far adheres to the       belligerent, and withdraws himself from his protection of       neutrality.\"[161]    [Sidenote: The Sale and Purchase of Vessels by Neutrals.]    The Purchase of Ships from the enemy, is a liberty that has not been  denied to neutral merchants, though by the regulation of France, it is  entirely forbidden. The rule that this country has been content to  apply is, that property so transferred, must be _bona fide_ and  absolutely transferred; there must be a sale divesting the enemy of  all further interest in it; and that any thing tending to continue his  interest, vitiates a contract of this description altogether.[162]    Russia is reported to have several vessels of war in different parts  of the world; some of these vessels have been sold, and others are  said to be in the process of sale. I shall cite what Sir Wm. Scott  says, on a case nearly similar.         \"There have been many cases of enemy _merchant vessels_       driven into ports out of which they could not escape, and       there sold, in which after much discussion, and some       hesitation of opinion, the validity of the purchase has been       sustained. But whether the purchase of a vessel, _built for       war_, and employed as such, and rendered incapable of acting       as a ship of war, by the arms of the other belligerent, and       driven into a neutral port for shelter; whether the purchase       of such a ship can be allowed, which shall enable the enemy       so far to rescue himself from the disadvantage into which he       has fallen, as to have the value restored to him by a       neutral purchaser, is a question on which I shall wait for       the authority of a superior court, before I admit the       validity of such a transfer.\"[163]    It has been said that the sale must be absolute and unconditional; so  that a sale under a condition to re-convey at the end of the war, is  invalid.[164] Similarly, where the seller is bound by his own  government under a penalty not to sell, except upon a condition of  restitution at the end of the war, and the purchaser undertook to  exonerate the seller, the sale was held invalid.[165]        SECTION II.        _Contraband of War_.      [Sidenote: Contraband of War.]    The general freedom of neutral commerce is subject to certain  restrictions with respect to neutral commerce. Among these is the  trade with the enemy in certain articles, called _Contraband of War_.  These are generally warlike stores, and articles which are directly  auxiliary to warlike purposes. Writers on this subject have made  distinctions between those things useful only for the purposes of war,  those which are not so, and those which are susceptible of  indiscriminate use in war and peace.    All seem to agree in excluding the first class from neutral trade;  and, in general, admitting the second. The chief difference is about  the third class. The last kind of articles--for example, money,  provisions, ships, and naval stores, according to Grotius, are  sometimes lawful articles of neutral trade, and sometimes not; and the  question depends upon circumstances. This is perhaps the truest ground  of decision, as we shall see in subsequent illustrations.[166]    Thus, these articles become contraband, _ipso facto_, if carried to a  besieged town, camp, or port. So in a _naval_ war, ships and materials  for ships, are contraband, although timber and cordage may be used for  other purposes, besides fitting out ships of war; and so horses and  saddles are not of necessity warlike stores, except when comparing the  quality, manufacture, or quantity attempted to be imported into the  hostile state, with the circumstances and condition of the war, it  appears (if not to be impossible) to be in the highest degree  unlikely, that they should be designed for any other purposes besides  the purposes of war.[167]    [Sidenote: Provisions, when Contraband.]    Common Provisions are not Contraband in general prize law, except in  the single case of being sent to a beseiged or blockaded place.[168]    It is a modern practice, in order to remove all possible doubt as to  what goods are contraband, for nations at war to enumerate them  particularly in treaties or compacts with neutral states; and such  treaties leave the neutral, with which they are made, at liberty to  supply the enemy with all goods that are not enumerated in them. These  treaties do not operate as a law; but like other treaties, are binding  only between the nations that are parties to them.[169]    [Sidenote: Lord Stowell's Opinion on Contraband of War.]    The Opinions of our great English authority, Lord Stowell, on this  subject, are contained in two judgments, of which the following is the  substance:--         \"In 1673, many unwarrantable rules were laid down by public       authority respecting Contraband. It was expressly asserted       by a person of great knowledge and experience in the English       Admiralty, that by its practice _corn, wine, and oil_, were       liable to be deemed contraband. In much later times, many       sorts of provisions, such as butter, salted fish, and rice,       have been condemned as Contraband. The modern established       rule was, that generally they are not contraband, but may       become so under circumstances arising out of the peculiar       situation of the war, or the condition of the parties       engaged in it; among the causes which tend to prevent       provisions from being treated as contraband, one is that       they are of the growth of the country which exports them.         \"Another circumstance, to which some indulgence, by the       practice of nations, is shown, is where the articles are in       their native and unmanufactured state. Thus, iron is treated       with indulgence, though anchors and other instruments       fabricated out of it, are directly contraband. Hemp is more       favourably considered than cordage; and wheat is not       considered so noxious a commodity as any of the final       preparations of it for human use. But the most important       destination is, whether the articles are destined for the       ordinary uses of life, or for military uses. The nature and       quality of the port to which the articles are going, is a       test of the matter of fact on which the distinction is to be       applied. If the port is a general commercial port, it shall       be understood that the articles were going for civil use,       although occasionally a frigate or other ship of war may be       constructed in that port. On the contrary, if the great       predominant character of a port is that of a port of naval       equipment, it shall be contended that the articles were       going for military use, although, merchant ships resort to       the same place, and although it is possible that the       articles might have been applied to civil consumption; for       it being impossible to ascertain the final application of an       article, _ancipitis usus_, it is not an injurious rule which       deduces both ways the final use from immediate destination;       and the presumption of a hostile use, founded on its       destination to a military port, is very much inflamed, if at       the time when the articles were going, a considerable       armament was notoriously preparing, to which a supply of       those articles would be eminently useful.\"[170]    In a later case he seems to have modified his opinion with respect to  undoubted naval stores, either so by nature, or intended as such for  the occasion. He says--         \"The character of the port is immaterial, since naval       stores, if they are to be considered as contraband, are so       without reference to the nature of the port, and equally,       whether bound to a mercantile port only, or to a port of       military equipment. The consequences of the supply may be       nearly the same in either case. If sent to a mercantile       port, they may be applied to immediate use in the equipment       of privateers, or they may be conveyed from the mercantile       to the naval port, and there become subservient to every       purpose to which they could have been applied if going       directly to a port of naval equipment.\"[171]    [Sidenote: Controversy between England and America on Contraband  Provisions.]    The doctrine of the English Admiralty Court, as to provisions becoming  contraband, was adopted by the Government in the instructions given to  their cruisers, on the 8th June, 1793, directing them to stop all  vessels laden wholly, or in part, with corn, flour, or meal, bound for  France, and to send them into a British port to be purchased by  Government; or to be released on condition that the master should.  give security to dispose of his cargo in the ports of some country in  amity with his Britannic Majesty. This was resisted by the Neutral  Powers, Sweden, Denmark, and especially the United States.    This order was justified upon the ground, that by the modern law of  nations, all provisions are to be considered as contraband, and as  such liable to confiscation, wherever depriving an enemy of these  supplies is one of the means intended to be employed for reducing him  to terms. The actual situation of France, (it was said,) was  notoriously such, as to lead to the employing this mode of distressing  her by the joint operations of the various powers engaged in the war;  and the reasonings of the text writers applying to all cases of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13882"],[0,"John Thorndyke's Cases (#15)"],[1,"bedrooms on the upper floor, of which two were  evidently disused, though the windows were wide open. The third bedroom  showed manifest traces of occupation, though it was as bare as the  others, for the water still stood in the wash-hand basin, and the bed  was unmade. To the latter Thorndyke advanced, and, having turned back  the bedclothes, examined the interior attentively, especially at the  foot and the pillow. The latter was soiled--not to say grimy--though the  rest of the bed-linen was quite clean.    \"Hair-dye,\" remarked Thorndyke, noting my glance at it; then he turned  and looked out of the open window. \"Can you see the place where Miss  Haldean was sitting to sketch?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" I replied; \"there is the place well in view, and you can see  right up the road. I had no idea this house stood so high. From the  three upper windows you can see all over the country excepting through  the wood.\"    \"Yes,\" Thorndyke rejoined, \"and he has probably been in the habit of  keeping watch up here with a telescope or a pair of field-glasses. Well,  there is not much of interest in this room. He kept his effects in a  cabin trunk which stood there under the window. He shaved this morning.  He has a white beard, to judge by the stubble on the shaving-paper, and  that is all. Wait, though. There is a key hanging on that nail. He must  have overlooked that, for it evidently does not belong to this house. It  is an ordinary town latchkey.\"    He took the key down, and having laid a sheet of notepaper, from his  pocket, on the dressing-table, produced a pin, with which he began  carefully to probe the interior of the key-barrel. Presently there came  forth, with much coaxing, a large ball of grey fluff, which Thorndyke  folded up in the paper with infinite care.    \"I suppose we mustn't take away the key,\" he said, \"but I think we will  take a wax mould of it.\"    He hurried downstairs, and, unstrapping the case from his bicycle,  brought it in and placed it on the table. As it was now getting dark, he  detached the powerful acetylene lamp from his machine, and, having  lighted it, proceeded to open the mysterious case. First he took from it  a small insufflator, or powder-blower, with which he blew a cloud of  light yellow powder over the table around the remains of the clock. The  powder settled on the table in an even coating, but when he blew at it  smartly with his breath, it cleared off, leaving, however, a number of  smeary impressions which stood out in strong yellow against the black  oilcloth. To one of these impressions he pointed significantly. It was  the print of a child's hand.    He next produced a small, portable microscope and some glass slides and  cover-slips, and having opened the paper and tipped the ball of fluff  from the key-barrel on to a slide, set to work with a pair of mounted  needles to tease it out into its component parts. Then he turned the  light of the lamp on to the microscope mirror and proceeded to examine  the specimen.    \"A curious and instructive assortment this, Jervis,\" he remarked, with  his eye at the microscope: \"woollen fibres--no cotton or linen; he is  careful of his health to have woollen pockets--and two hairs; very  curious ones, too. Just look at them, and observe the root bulbs.\"    I applied my eye to the microscope, and saw, among other things, two  hairs--originally white, but encrusted with a black, opaque, glistening  stain. The root bulbs, I noticed, were shrivelled and atrophied.    \"But how on earth,\" I exclaimed, \"did the hairs get into his pocket?\"    \"I think the hairs themselves answer that question,\" he replied, \"when  considered with the other curios. The stain is obviously lead sulphide;  but what else do you see?\"    \"I see some particles of metal--a white metal apparently--and a number  of fragments of woody fibre and starch granules, but I don't recognize  the starch. It is not wheat-starch, nor rice, nor potato. Do you make  out what it is?\"    [Illustration: FLUFF FROM KEY-BARREL, MAGNIFIED 77 DIAMETERS.]    Thorndyke chuckled. \"Experientia does it,\" said he. \"You will have,  Jervis, to study the minute properties of dust and dirt. Their  evidential value is immense. Let us have another look at that starch; it  is all alike, I suppose.\"    It was; and Thorndyke had just ascertained the fact when the door burst  open and Mrs. Haldean entered the room, followed by Mrs. Hanshaw and the  police inspector. The former lady regarded my colleague with a glance of  extreme disfavour.    \"We heard that you had come here, sir,\" said she, \"and we supposed you  were engaged in searching for my poor child. But it seems we were  mistaken, since we find you here amusing yourselves fiddling with these  nonsensical instruments.\"    \"Perhaps, Mabel,\" said Mrs. Hanshaw stiffly, \"it would be wiser, and  infinitely more polite, to ask if Dr. Thorndyke has any news for us.\"    \"That is undoubtedly so, madam,\" agreed the inspector, who had  apparently suffered also from Mrs. Haldean's impulsiveness.    \"Then perhaps,\" the latter lady suggested, \"you will inform us if you  have discovered anything.\"    \"I will tell you.\" replied Thorndyke, \"all that we know. The child was  abducted by the man who occupied this house, and who appears to have  watched him from an upper window, probably through a glass. This man  lured the child into the wood by blowing this bird-call; he met him in  the wood, and induced him--by some promises, no doubt--to come with him.  He picked the child up and carried him--on his back, I think--up to the  house, and brought him in through the front door, which he locked after  him. He gave the boy this clock and the bird-call to amuse him while he  went upstairs and packed his trunk. He took the trunk out through the  back door and down the garden to the shed there, in which he had a  motor-car. He got the car out and came back for the boy, whom he carried  down to the car, locking the back door after him. Then he drove away.\"    \"You know he has gone,\" cried Mrs. Haldean, \"and yet you stay here  playing with these ridiculous toys. Why are you not following him?\"    \"We have just finished ascertaining the facts,\" Thorndyke replied  calmly, \"and should by now be on the road if you had not come.\"    Here the inspector interposed anxiously. \"Of course, sir, you can't give  any description of the man. You have no clue to his identity, I  suppose?\"    \"We have only his footprints,\" Thorndyke answered, \"and this fluff which  I raked out of the barrel of his latchkey, and have just been examining.  From these data I conclude that he is a rather short and thin man, and  somewhat lame. He walks with the aid of a thick stick, which has a knob,  not a crook, at the top, and which he carries in his left hand. I think  that his left leg has been amputated above the knee, and that he wears  an artificial limb. He is elderly, he shaves his beard, has white hair  dyed a greyish black, is partly bald, and probably combs a wisp of hair  over the bald place; he takes snuff, and carries a leaden comb in his  pocket.\"    As Thorndyke's description proceeded, the inspector's mouth gradually  opened wider and wider, until he appeared the very type and symbol of  astonishment. But its effect on Mrs. Haldean was much more remarkable.  Rising from her chair, she leaned on the table and stared at Thorndyke  with an expression of awe--even of terror; and as he finished she sank  back into her chair, with her hands clasped, and turned to Mrs. Hanshaw.    \"Jane!\" she gasped, \"it is Percy--my brother-in-law! He has described  him exactly, even to his stick and his pocket-comb. But I thought he was  in Chicago.\"    \"If that is so,\" said Thorndyke, hastily repacking his case, \"we had  better start at once.\"    \"We have the dogcart in the road,\" said Mrs. Hanshaw.    \"Thank you,\" replied Thorndyke. \"We will ride on our bicycles, and the  inspector can borrow Willett's. We go out at the back by the cart-track,  which joins the road farther on.\"    \"Then we will follow in the dogcart,\" said Mrs. Haldean. \"Come, Jane.\"    The two ladies departed down the path, while we made ready our bicycles  and lit our lamps.    \"With your permission, inspector,\" said Thorndyke, \"we will take the key  with us.\"    \"It's hardly legal, sir,\" objected the officer. \"We have no authority.\"    \"It is quite illegal,\" answered Thorndyke; \"but it is necessary; and  necessity--like your military J.P.--knows no law.\"    The inspector grinned and went out, regarding me with a quivering eyelid  as Thorndyke locked the door with his skeleton key. As we turned into  the road, I saw the light of the dogcart behind us, and we pushed  forward at a swift pace, picking up the trail easily on the soft, moist  road.    \"What beats me,\" said the inspector confidentially, as we rode along,  \"is how he knew the man was bald. Was it the footprints or the  latchkey? And that comb, too, that was a regular knock-out.\"    These points were, by now, pretty clear to me. I had seen the hairs with  their atrophied bulbs--such as one finds at the margin of a bald patch;  and the comb was used, evidently, for the double purpose of keeping the  bald patch covered and blackening the sulphur-charged hair. But the  knobbed stick and the artificial limb puzzled me so completely that I  presently overtook Thorndyke to demand an explanation.    \"The stick,\" said he, \"is perfectly simple. The ferrule of a knobbed  stick wears evenly all round; that of a crooked stick wears on one  side--the side opposite the crook. The impressions showed that the  ferrule of this one was evenly convex; therefore it had no crook. The  other matter is more complicated. To begin with, an artificial foot  makes a very characteristic impression, owing to its purely passive  elasticity, as I will show you to-morrow. But an artificial leg fitted  below the knee is quite secure, whereas one fitted above the knee--that  is, with an artificial knee-joint "]]]
