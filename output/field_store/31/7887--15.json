[25] Among the Sarts of Turkestan a class of well-trained and educated  homosexual prostitutes, resembling those found in China and many regions  of northern Asia, bearing also the same name of _batsha_, are said to be  especially common because fostered by the scarcity of women through  polygamy and by the women's ignorance and coarseness. The institution of  the _batsha_ is supposed to have come to Turkestan from Persia. (Herman,  \"Die Paederastie bei den Sarten,\" _Sexual-Probleme_, June, 1911.) This  would seem to suggest that Persia may have been a general center of  diffusions of this kind of refined homosexuality in northern Asia.

I  am informed by a medical correspondent in the United States that inversion  is extremely prevalent among American negroes. \"I have good reason to  believe,\" he writes, \"that it is far more prevalent among them than among  the white people of any nation. If inversion is to be regarded as a  penalty of 'civilization' this is remarkable. Perhaps, however, the Negro,  _relatively to his capacity_, is more highly civilized than we are; at any  rate his civilization has been thrust upon him, and not acquired through  the long throes of evolution. Colored inverts desire white men as a rule,  but are not averse to men of their own race. I believe that 10 per cent,  of Negroes in the United States are sexually inverted.\"    [38] Among the Papuans of German New Guinea, where the women have great  power, marriage is late, and the young men are compelled to live separated  from the women in communal houses. Here, says Moskowski (_Zeitschrift fuer  Ethnologie_, 1911, Heft 2, p. 339), homosexual orgies are openly carried  on.    [39] C.G.

[50] Hirschfeld and others have pointed out, very truly, that inverts are  less prone than normal persons to regard caste and social position. This  innately democratic attitude renders it easier for them than for ordinary  people to rise to what Cyples has called the \"ecstasy of humanity,\" the  emotional attitude, that is to say, of those rare souls of whom it may be  said, in the same writer's words, that \"beggars' rags to their  unhesitating lips grew fit for kissing because humanity had touched the  garb.\" Edward Carpenter (_Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk_, p. 83)  remarks that great ethical leaders have often exhibited feminine traits,  and adds: \"It becomes easy to suppose of those early figures--who once  probably were men--those Apollos, Buddhas, Dionysus, Osiris, and so  forth--to suppose that they too were somewhat bisexual in temperament, and  that it was really largely owing to that fact that they were endowed with  far-reaching powers and became leaders of mankind.\"    [51] English translation, _Primitive Folk_, in Contemporary Science  series.

Even the dances following a funeral tend to      become sexual in character. At the end of the rites attending the      funeral of a chief's son the entire population began to dance      with ever-growing ardor; there was nothing ritualistic or sad in      these contortions, which took on the character of a lascivious      dance. Men and women, boys and girls, young and old, sought to      rival each other in suppleness, and the festival became joyous      and general, as if in celebration of a marriage or a victory.      (Eysseric, \"La Cote d'Ivoire,\" _Nouvelles Archives des Missions      Scientifiques_, tome ix, 1890, pp. 241-49.)        Mrs. French-Sheldon has described the marriage-rites she observed      at Taveta in East Africa. \"During this time the young people      dance and carouse and make themselves generally merry and      promiscuously drunk, carrying the excess of their dissipation to      such an extent that they dance until they fall down in a species      of epileptic fit.\" It is the privilege of the bridegroom's four      groomsmen to enjoy the bride first, and she is then handed over      to her legitimate husband. This people, both men and women, are      \"great dancers and merry-makers; the young fellows will collect      in groups and dance as though in competition one with the other;      one lad will dash out from the circle of his companions, rush      into the middle of a circumscribed space, and scream out 'Wow,      wow!' Another follows him and screams; then a third does the      same. These men will dance with their knees almost rigid, jumping      into the air until their excitement becomes very great and their      energy almost spasmodic, leaving the ground frequently three feet      as they spring into the air. At some of their festivals their      dancing is carried to such an extent that I have seen a young      fellow's muscles quiver from head to foot and his jaws tremble      without any apparent ability on his part to control them, until,      foaming at the mouth and with his eyes rolling, he falls in a      paroxysm upon the ground, to be carried off by his companions.\"      The writer adds significantly that this dancing \"would seem to      emanate from a species of voluptuousness.\" (Mrs. French-Sheldon,      \"Customs among the Natives of East Africa,\" _Journal of the      Anthropological Institute_, vol. xxi, May, 1892, pp. 366-67.) It      may be added that among the Suaheli dances are intimately      associated with weddings; the Suaheli dances have been minutely      described by Velten (_Sitten und Gebraueche der Suaheli_, pp.      144-175). Among the Akamba of British East Africa, also,      according to H.R. Tate (_Journal of the Anthropological      Institute_, Jan.-June, 1904, p. 137), the dances are followed by      connection between the young men and girls, approved of by the      parents.        The dances of the Faroe Islanders have been described by Raymond      Pilet (\"Rapport sur une Mission en Islande et aux lies Feroe,\"      _Nouvelles Archives des Missions Scientifiques_, tome vii, 1897,      p. 285). These dances, which are entirely decorous, include      poetry, music, and much mimicry, especially of battle. They      sometimes last for two consecutive days and nights. \"The dance is      simply a permitted and discreet method by which the young men may      court the young girls. The islander enters the circle and places      himself beside the girl to whom he desires to show his affection;      if he meets with her approval she stays and continues to dance at      his side; if not, she leaves the circle and appears later at      another spot.\"        Pitre (_Usi, etc., del Popolo Siciliano_, vol. ii, p. 24, as      quoted in Marro's _Puberta_) states that in Sicily the youth who      wishes to marry seeks to give some public proof of his valor and      to show himself off. In Chiaramonte, in evidence of his virile      force, he bears in procession the standard of some confraternity,      a high and richly adorned standard which makes its staff bend to      a semicircle, of such enormous weight that the bearer must walk      in a painfully bent position, his head thrown back and his feet      forward. On reaching the house of his betrothed he makes proof of      his boldness and skill in wielding this extremely heavy standard      which at this moment seems a plaything in his hands, but may yet      prove fatal to him through injury to the loins or other parts.        This same tendency, which we find in so highly developed a degree      among animals and primitive human peoples, is also universal      among the children of even the most civilized human races,      although in a less organized and more confused way. It manifests      itself as \"showing-off.\" Sanford Bell, in his study of the      emotion of love in children, finds that \"showing-off\" is an      essential element in the love of children in what he terms the      second stage (from the eighth to the twelfth year in girls and      the fourteenth in boys). \"It constitutes one of the chief numbers      in the boy's repertory of love charms, and is not totally absent      from the girl's. It is a most common sight to see the boys taxing      their resources in devising means of exposing their own      excellencies, and often doing the most ridiculous and extravagant      things. Running, jumping, dancing, prancing, sparring, wrestling,      turning handsprings, somersaults, climbing, walking fences,      swinging, giving yodels and yells, whistling, imitating the      movements of animals, 'taking people off,' courting danger,      affecting courage are some of its common forms.... This      'showing-off' in the boy lover is the forerunner of the skilful,      purposive, and elaborate means of self-exhibition in the adult      male and the charming coquetry in the adult female, in their      love-relations.\" (Sanford Bell, \"The Emotion of Love Between the      Sexes,\" _American Journal Psychology_, July, 1902; cf.      \"Showing-off and Bashfulness,\" _Pedagogical Seminary_, June,      1903.)    If, in the light of the previous discussion, we examine such facts as  those here collected, we may easily trace throughout the perpetual  operations of the same instinct. It is everywhere the instinctive object  of the male, who is very rarely passive in the process of courtship, to  assure by his activity in display, his energy or skill or beauty, both his  own passion and the passion of the female. Throughout nature sexual  conjugation only takes place after much expenditure of energy.[34] We are  deceived by what we see among highly fed domesticated animals, and among  the lazy classes of human society, whose sexual instincts are at once both  unnaturally stimulated and unnaturally repressed, when we imagine that the  instinct of detumescence is normally ever craving to be satisfied, and  that throughout nature it can always be set off at a touch whenever the  stimulus is applied. So far from the instinct of tumescence naturally  needing to be crushed, it needs, on the contrary, in either sex to be  submitted to the most elaborate and prolonged processes in order to bring  about those conditions which detumescence relieves. A state of tumescence  is not normally constant, and tumescence must be obtained before  detumescence is possible.[35] The whole object of courtship, of the mutual  approximation and caresses of two persons of the opposite sex, is to  create the state of sexual tumescence.    It will be seen that the most usual method of attaining tumescence--a  method found among the most various kinds of animals, from insects and  birds to man--is some form of the dance. Among the Negritos of the  Philippines dancing is described by A.B. Meyer as \"jumping in a circle  around a girl and stamping with the feet\"; as we have seen, such a dance  is, essentially, a form of courtship that is widespread among animals.  \"The true cake-walk,\" again, Stanley Hall remarks, \"as seen in the South  is perhaps the purest expression of this impulse to courtship antics seen  in man.\"[36] Muscular movement of which the dance is the highest and most  complex expression, is undoubtedly a method of auto-intoxication of the  very greatest potency. All energetic movement, indeed, tends to produce  active congestion. In its influence on the brain violent exercise may thus  result in a state of intoxication even resembling insanity. As Lagrange  remarks, the visible effects of exercise--heightened color, bright eyes,  resolute air and walk--are those of slight intoxication, and a girl who  has waltzed for a quarter of an hour is in the same condition as if she  had drunk champagne.[37] Groos regards the dance as, above all, an  intoxicating play of movement, possessing, like other methods of  intoxication,--and even apart from its relationship to combat and  love,--the charm of being able to draw us out of our everyday life and  lead us into a self-created dream-world.[38] That the dance is not only a  narcotic, but also a powerful stimulant, we may clearly realize from the  experiments which show that this effect is produced even by much less  complex kinds of muscular movement. This has been clearly determined, for  instance, by Fere, in the course of a long and elaborate series of  experiments dealing with the various influences that modify work as  measured by Mosso's ergograph. This investigator found that muscular  movement is the most efficacious of all stimulants in increasing muscular  power.[39] It is easy to trace these pleasurable effects of combined  narcotic and stimulant motion in everyday life and it is unnecessary to  enumerate its manifestations.[40]        Dancing is so powerful an agent on the organism, as Sergi truly      remarks (_Les Emotions_, p. 288), because its excitation is      general, because it touches every vital organ, the higher"]]]
