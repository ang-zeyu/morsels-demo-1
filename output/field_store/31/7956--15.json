It was in reference to this matter, and meaning their  accuser, that Jacob, when he dispatched his sons on their  second expedition to Egypt, prayed to God, \"God Almighty  give you mercy before the man.\"[206]    Joseph made himself strange unto his brethren, and he  took his cup in his hand, knocked against it, and said, \"By  this magic cup I know that ye are spies.\" They replied,  \"Thy servants came from Canaan into Egypt for to buy  corn.\"    Joseph: \"If it be true that ye came hither to buy corn,  why is it that each one of you entered the city by a separate  gate?\"[207]    The brethren: \"We are ALL the sons of one man in the  land of Canaan, and he bade us not enter a city together by  the same gate, that we attract not the attention of the people  of the place.\" Unconsciously they had spoken as seers, for  the word ALL included Joseph as one of their number.[208]    Joseph: \"Verily, ye are spies! All the people that come  to buy corn return home without delay, but ye have lingered  here three days, without making any purchases, and all the  time you have been gadding about in the disreputable parts  of the city, and only spies are wont to do thus.\"    The brethren: \"We thy servants are twelve brethren, the  sons of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of the Hebrew Abraham.  The youngest is this day with our father in Canaan,  and one hath disappeared. Him did we look for in this land,  and we looked for him even in the disreputable houses.\"    Joseph: \"Have ye made search in every other place on  earth, and was Egypt the only land left? And if it be true  that he is in Egypt, what should a brother of yours be doing  in a house of ill-fame, if, indeed, ye are the descendants of  Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?\"    The brethren: \"We did hear that some Ishmaelites stole  our brother, and sold him into slavery in Egypt, and as our  brother was exceeding fair in form and face, we thought he  might have been sold for illicit uses, and therefore we  searched even the disreputable houses to find him.\"    Joseph: \"You speak deceitful words, when you call yourselves  sons of Abraham. By the life of Pharaoh, ye are  spies, and you did go from one disreputable house to another  that none might discover you.\"[209]    The expression \"by the life of Pharaoh\" might have betrayed  Joseph's real feeling to his brethren, had they but  known his habit of taking this oath only when he meant to  avoid keeping his word later.[210]    Joseph continued to speak to his brethren: \"Let us suppose  you should discover your brother serving as a slave,  and his master should demand a high sum for his ransom,  would you pay it?\"    The brethren: \"Yes!\"    Joseph: \"But suppose his master should refuse to surrender  him for any price in the world, what would you do?\"    The brethren: \"If he yields not our brother to us, we  will kill the master, and carry off our brother.\"    Joseph: \"Now see how true my words were, that ye are  spies. By your own admission ye have come to slay the inhabitants  of the land. Report hath told us that two of you  did massacre the people of Shechem on account of the wrong  done to your sister, and now have ye come down into Egypt  to kill the Egyptians for the sake of your brother. I shall be  convinced of your innocence only if you consent to send one  of your number home and fetch your youngest brother  hither.\"    His brethren refused compliance, and Joseph caused them  to be put into prison by seventy of his valiant men, and there  they remained for three days.[211] God never allows the  pious to languish in distress longer than three days, and so  it was a Divine dispensation that the brethren of Joseph  were released on the third day,[212] and were permitted by  Joseph to return home, on condition, however, that one of  them remain behind as hostage.    The difference between Joseph and his brethren can be  seen here. Though he retained one of them to be bound in  the prison house, he still said, \"I fear God,\" and dismissed  the others, but when he was in their power, they gave no  thought to God.[213] At this time, to be sure, their conduct  was such as is becoming to the pious, who accept their fate  with calm resignation, and acknowledge the righteousness  of God, for He metes out reward and punishment measure  for measure. They recognized that their present punishment  was in return for the heartless treatment they had dealt out  to Joseph, paying no heed to his distress, though he fell at  the feet of each of them, weeping, and entreating them not  to sell him into slavery. Reuben reminded the others that  they had two wrongs to expiate, the wrong against their  brother and the wrong against their father, who was so  grieved that he exclaimed, \"I will go down to the grave to  my son mourning.\"    The brethren of Joseph knew not that the viceroy of  Egypt understood Hebrew, and could follow their words,  for Manasseh stood and was an interpreter between them  and him.[214]    Joseph decided to keep Simon as hostage in Egypt, for he  had been one of the two--Levi was the other--to advise that  Joseph be put to death, and only the intercession of Reuben  and Judah had saved him. He did not detain Levi, too, for  he feared, if both remained behind together, Egypt might  suffer the same fate at their hands as the city of Shechem.[215]  Also, he preferred Simon to Levi, because Simon was not a  favorite among the sons of Jacob, and they would not resist  his detention in Egypt too violently, while they might annihilate  Egypt, as aforetime Shechem, if they were deprived  of Levi, their wise man and high priest.[216] Besides, it was  Simon that had lowered Joseph into the pit, wherefore he  had a particular grudge against him.[217]    When the brethren yielded to Joseph's demand, and consented  to leave their brother behind as hostage, Simon said  to them, \"Ye desire to do with me as ye did with Joseph!\"  But they replied, in despair: \"What can we do? Our  households will perish of hunger.\" Simon made answer,  \"Do as ye will, but as for me, let me see the man that will  venture to cast me into prison.\" Joseph sent word to Pharaoh  to let him have seventy of his valiant men, to aid him  in arresting robbers. But when the seventy appeared upon  the scene, and were about to lay hands on Simon, he uttered  a loud cry, and his assailants fell to the floor and knocked  out their teeth.[218] Pharaoh's valiant men, as well as all the  people that stood about Joseph, fled affrighted, only Joseph  and his son Manasseh remained calm and unmoved. Manasseh rose up,  dealt Simon a blow on the back of his neck,  put manacles upon his hands and fetters upon his feet, and  cast him into prison. Joseph's brethren were greatly amazed  at the heroic strength of the youth, and Simon said, \"This  blow was not dealt by an Egyptian, but by one belonging to  our house.\"[219]    He was bound and taken to prison before the eyes of the  other brethren of Joseph, but as soon as they were out of  sight, Joseph ordered good fare to be set before him, and  he treated him with great kindness.[220]    Joseph permitted his nine other brethren to depart, carrying  corn with them in abundance, but he impressed upon  them that they must surely return and bring their youngest  brother with them. On the way, Levi, who felt lonely without  his constant companion Simon, opened his sack, and he  espied the money he had paid for the corn. They all  trembled, and their hearts failed them, and they said,  \"Where, then, is the lovingkindness of God toward our  fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, seeing that He hath delivered  us into the hands of the Egyptian king, that he may  raise false accusations against us?\" And Judah said,  \"Verily, we are guilty concerning our brother, we have  sinned against God, in that we sold our brother, our own  flesh, and why do ye ask, Where, then, is the lovingkindness  of God toward our fathers?\"    Reuben spoke in the same way: \"Spake I not unto you,  saying, Do not sin against the child, and ye would not hear?  And now the Lord doth demand him of us. How can you  say, Where, then, is the lovingkindness of God toward our  fathers, though you have sinned against Him?\"    They proceeded on their journey home, and their father  met them on the way. Jacob was astonished not to see  Simon with them, and in reply to his questions, they told  him all that had befallen them in Egypt. Then Jacob cried  out: \"What have ye done? I sent Joseph to you to see  whether it be well with you, and ye said, An evil beast hath  devoured him. Simon went forth with you for to buy corn,  and you say, The king of Egypt hath cast him into prison.  And now ye will take Benjamin away and kill him, too. Ye  will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\"[221]    The words of Jacob, which he uttered, \"Me have ye bereaved  of my children,\" were meant to intimate to his sons  that he suspected them of the death of Joseph and of  Simon's disappearance as well, and their reports concerning  both he regarded as inventions.[222] What made him inconsolable  was that now, having lost two of his sons, he could  not hope to see the Divine promise fulfilled, that he should  be the ancestor of twelve tribes.[223] He was quite resolved  in his mind, therefore, not to let Benjamin go away with his  brethren under any condition whatsoever, and he vouchsafed  Reuben no reply when he said, \"Slay my two sons, if I bring  him not to thee.\" He considered it beneath his dignity to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14958"],[0,"Mother West Wind 'Why' Stories (#15)"],[1," They certainly  would have before this, if you had had a long tail sticking out behind  for them to get hold of. I had a long tail when I was young, and I was  mighty glad to get rid of it.\"    After he heard that, Peter felt better. But he didn't lose interest in  tails, and he spent a great deal of time in wondering why some of his  neighbors had big, bushy tails and some had long, slim tails and why  he himself had almost no tail at all. So when Paddy the Beaver came  to live in the Green Forest, and made a pond there by building a  wonderful dam across the Laughing Brook, the first thing Peter looked  to see was what kind of a tail Paddy has, and the first time he got a  good look at it, his eyes popped almost out of his head. He just  stared and stared. He hardly noticed the wonderful dam or the equally  wonderful canals which Paddy had made. All he could think of was that  great, broad, flat, thick tail, which is so unlike any tail he had  ever seen or heard of.    The very next morning he hurried over to the Smiling Pool to tell  Grandfather Frog about it. Grandfather Frog's big, goggly eyes  twinkled.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said he. \"Paddy the Beaver has one of the most useful  tails I know of. Would you like to know how he comes by such a queer  tail?\"    [Illustration: The first thing Peter looked to see was what kind of a  tail Paddy has.]    \"Oh, if you please! If you please, Grandfather Frog! I didn't suppose  there was such a queer tail in all the world, and I don't see what  possible use it can be. Do tell me about it!\" cried Peter.    \"Chug-a-rum! If you had used your eyes when you visited Paddy, you  might have guessed for yourself how he came by it,\" replied  Grandfather Frog gruffly. \"Some people never do learn to use their  eyes.\"    Peter looked a bit sheepish, but he said nothing and waited patiently.  Presently Grandfather Frog cleared his throat two or three times and  began to talk.    \"Once upon a time, long, long ago, when the world was young--\"    \"It seems to me that everything wonderful happened long ago when the  world was young,\" interrupted Peter.    Grandfather Frog looked at Peter severely, and Peter hastened to beg  his pardon.    After a long time Grandfather Frog began again.    \"Once on a time, long, long ago, lived Mr. Beaver, the  great-great-ever-so-great grandfather of Paddy up there in the Green  Forest. Old Mr. Beaver was one of the hardest working of all of Old  Mother Nature's big family and one of the smartest, just as Paddy is  to-day. He always seemed happiest when he was busiest, and because he  liked to be happy all the time, he tried to keep busy all the time.    \"He was very thrifty, was Mr. Beaver; not at all like some people I  know. He believed in preparing to-day for what might happen to-morrow,  and so when he had all the food he needed for the present, he stored  away food for the time when it might not be so easy to get. And he  believed in helping himself, did Mr. Beaver, and not in leaving  everything to Old Mother Nature, as did most of his neighbors. That is  how he first came to think of making a dam and a pond. Like his small  cousin, Mr. Muskrat, he was very fond of the water, and felt most at  home and safest there. But he found that sometimes the food which he  liked best, which was the bark of certain kinds of trees, grew some  distance from the water, and it was the hardest kind of hard work to  roll and drag the logs down to the water, where he could eat the bark  from them in safety.    \"He thought about this a great deal, but instead of going to Old  Mother Nature and complaining, as most of his neighbors would have  done in his place, he studied and studied to find some way to make the  work easier. One day he noticed that a lot of sticks had caught in  the stream where he made his home, and that because the water could  not work its way between them as fast as where nothing hindered it, it  made a little pool just above the sticks. That made him think harder  than ever. He brought some of the logs and sticks from which he had  gnawed the bark and fastened them with the others, and right away the  pool grew bigger. The more sticks he added, the bigger the pool grew.  Mr. Beaver had discovered what a dam is for and how to build it.    \"'Why,' thought he, 'if I make a pond at the place nearest to my food  trees, I can carry the water to the trees instead of the trees to the  water; and that will be easier and ever so much safer as well.'    \"So Mr. Beaver built a dam at just the right place, while all the  other little people laughed at him and made fun of him for working so  hard. Just as he had thought it would do, the dam made a pond, and the  pond grew bigger and bigger, until it reached the very place where his  food trees grew. Mr. Beaver built him a big, comfortable house out in  the pond, and then he went to work as hard as ever he could to cut  down trees and then cut them up into the right sized pieces to store  away in his big food pile for the winter.    \"Now cutting down trees is hard work. Yes, Siree, cutting down trees  is the hardest kind of hard work. Mr. Beaver had to sit up on his hind  legs to do it, and his legs grew very, very tired. In those days he  had a tail very much like the tail of Jerry Muskrat. It was very  useful when he was swimming, but it was of no use at all at any other  time. Sometimes he tried to brace himself with it--when he was  sitting up to cut trees, and found it of no help. But he didn't  complain; he just kept right on working, and only stopped to rest when  his legs ached so that he had to.    \"He was working just as usual one day when Old Mother Nature came  along to see how he was getting on. She saw the new dam and the new  pond, and she asked Mr. Beaver who had made them. He told her that he  had and explained why. Old Mother Nature was greatly pleased, but she  didn't say so. She just passed the time of day with him and then sat  down to watch him cut a tree. She saw him try to brace himself with  his useless tail, and she saw him stop to rest his tired legs.    \"'That looks to me like pretty hard work,' said Old Mother Nature.    \"'So it is,' replied Mr. Beaver, stretching first one leg and then  another. 'But things worth having are worth working for,' and with  that he began cutting again.    \"'You ought to have something to sit on,' said Old Mother Nature, her  eyes twinkling.    \"Mr. Beaver grinned. 'It would be very nice,' he confessed, 'but I  never waste time wishing for things I haven't got and can't get,' and  went right on cutting.    \"The next morning when he awoke, he had the greatest surprise of his  life. He had a new tail! It was broad and thick and flat. It wasn't  like any tail he had ever seen or heard of. At first he didn't know  how to manage it, but when he tried to swim, he found that it was even  better than his old tail for swimming. He hurried over to begin his  day's work, and there he made another discovery; his new tail was just  the most splendid brace! It was almost like a stool to sit on, and he  could work all day long without tiring his legs. Then was Mr. Beaver  very happy, and to show how happy he was, he worked harder than ever.  Later, he found that his new tail was just what he needed to pat down  the mud with which he covered the roof of his house.    \"'Why,' he cried, 'I believe it is the most useful tail in all the  world!'    \"And then he wished with all his might that Old Mother Nature would  return so that he might thank her for it. And that,\" concluded  Grandfather Frog, \"is how Mr. Beaver came by his broad tail. You see,  Old Mother Nature always helps those who help themselves. And ever  since that long-ago day, all Beavers have had broad tails, and have  been the greatest workers in the world.\""]]]
