The native indeed is in the position of  a farm labourer who gathers the fruits of the soil for his master and is  paid a wage for so doing. On Sunday I attend service in the chapel. A  native from Sierra Leone reads a lesson from the Gospel of St. Matthew,  which has been translated into Bangala and gives a short address on the  subject afterwards. He is evidently much in earnest and talks with that  kind of spirit of conviction frequently to be noticed in street  preachers. Several hymns are sung and then the people pass out, dropping  their mitakos into the plate as they do so. In the afternoon, we walk  round the village. Mr. Clarke notices a boy with a malformation of one  knee and speaks to him. He then explains to me that this is another  atrocity, for the boy said he had been shot by the soldiers of the State  when an infant. An examination of the boy however, showed he was  suffering from a kind of bony tumour. There are several chiefs in Ikoko  and one of them also practises as a doctor. He has cleared a space about  ten feet in diameter and enclosed it for a consulting room, while an  inner chamber, still more closely surrounded, is the secret place where  the infusions are made and the charms and fetishes consulted. Although  many of the drugs used, are efficacious or not, according to the faith  of the patient, as in civilised countries, yet the white people  constantly tell of apparently wonderful cures by native doctors, and it  is certain that the people at present prefer to be treated by those of  their own colour. There is also an old lady in Ikoko, the widow of a  chief, who is reported to be very clever as a healer. This old person  has European features but has an unpleasant expression. The native women  wear nothing but a thin belt with a small piece of cloth attached but  they are covered with brass rings, and the principle wife of an  important chief here was wearing a necklet of solid brass which must  have weighed thirty or forty pounds. This was fixed on and had to be  worn night and day.    [Illustration: THE FARM AT EALA.]    In spite however, of clever doctors, the men do not live to be much over  forty years of age. Perhaps they have too many wives for there are far  more old women than men. On the other hand, as there must be two or  three women to each man, it is only natural to find more of the former  at any given age. The infants are not weaned for three or four years and  during that period the woman it is said refuses to lie with her husband.  Another wife therefore, cohabits with the man while the first rears her  child. Polygamy is thus a custom which the missionaries find very  difficult to change. The State however, refuses to recognise more than  one wife and many of the soldiers are legitimately married by the  officials qualified to perform that office.    Much palm wine is consumed by the natives for its manufacture is very  simple. A gourd is tied to an upper branch of a palm which is then  tapped and the sap drops into the vessel. If this is left all night,  fermentation takes place without artificial aid, and at midday a kind of  highly scented alcoholic cider is produced which however, is acid and  undrinkable by the evening. This natural wine must therefore, be drunk  on the day of fermentation and does not improve on keeping.    What a useful tree the palm is! Its trunk, branches and leaves are fine  building materials; its matting forms beds and furniture; its oil gives  light, acts as butter or lard for cooking, makes soap when mixed with  banana juice or an alkali, and indeed, can be used for all the purposes  of oil; it forms wine, and the heart of the plant is most excellent  eating as a salad. Therefore given meat, the palm tree and the banana,  and a town can be built and its inhabitants fed. Both sexes smoke a  great deal of tobacco and also Indian hemp, which latter has however,  been found so injurious that it is illegal to grow the plant but the  native tobacco is not at all unpleasant when smoked in a pipe.    On August 22nd we take a trip up a small river to the East of Ikoko  which winds through dense forest and is evidently full of fish, for at  intervals, barricades are erected which stretch right across the river,  with the exception of a small space to allow canoes to go up and down.  In the middle or one side however, an opening is left which can be  closed by lowering one of the bamboo nets heavily weighted, vertically  down. Platforms are erected ten or twelve feet high to raise or lower  these nets and the whole structure is ingeniously and strongly put  together. The fish are thus allowed to swim up and are then enclosed in  a section of the river, when they are easily caught in baskets. All the  riverside population engages in fishing. On the way I shot a toucan,  which must have weighed ten or twelve pounds, with number five shot  which happened to be in the gun at the time. The bird however, was hit  in the head and breast. The natives at once plucked it and having  scarcely warmed it at the fire greedily eat it.    At a village called Bokoto a boy was brought to me with his right hand  missing, for I was very anxious to see an original of the photos which  are so common in England. I was indeed beginning to despair of finding  one at all for most of the white men had never seen a case, none of the  natives understood what I wished and hitherto no missionary knew where  one was to be found. Here however, was a boy with his right hand missing  and it had evidently been removed by a sharp instrument, but not I think  by a surgeon, for the scars were not such as follow amputation at the  wrist joint. Mr. Clarke acted as interpreter and the following  conversation took place.    --When was this done?    --During the rubber war when the boy was an infant.    --Who did it?    --The soldiers who came from Bofiji.    --Why did they come?    --Because the natives had not collected rubber.    --Where did this take place?    --In the country behind Bikoro and the mother was killed at the same  time as she was carrying away her infant.    Neither the date nor the age of the boy is known, but he appears to be  12 or 13 years of age and his name is Imputela. Although therefore, no  proof can be adduced, for the child of course remembers nothing and only  knows what he has been told, there is a possibility that a native  soldier may have cut off his hand. On the other hand, it may have been  injured or cut by a native chief. I mention this case at length, because  it was the only one I ever found in a tour of several thousand miles in  the interior of the Congo State, although everyone knew I was very  anxious to see such cases. On our way back we call at Inkaka another  fishing village. Behind it a few of the Batoir tribe had temporarily  settled. They are very savage and uncivilised and lead a wandering life,  hunting game. Sometimes they act as professional hunters and are  employed by villagers to find them food. One young fellow was armed  with a bow and wooden arrows poisoned at the tip and carefully wrapped  in a leaf. The poison is simply the decomposing matter of dead men or  animals. As long as this is wet, it is most deadly but loses its  strength when dried. For this reason only is the tip wrapped in a leaf.  Death has followed within a few hours of being struck with a poisoned  arrow and this is only to be expected, for we know how dangerous it is  for surgeons when they wound themselves during an examination of the  dead body. On the way home we found a snake in the water and shot it  just at the very moment it had seized a fish and was holding it in its  mouth. Just as we were picking this out another similar one appeared and  this met the same fate. They were bright green in colour and had small  heads, but one measured 93 and the other 90 inches in length.    On August 23rd we visit Bikoro a large State plantation of coffee, cocoa  and rubber, situated on the bank of the Lake about eight or nine miles  from Ikoko. It is conducted by Mr. Monaie, a Swiss gentleman, who has  had much experience in horticulture. Here nature has been closely  imitated but improved upon. First the undergrowth was cleared from the  forest and then the native rubber vines were planted and have commenced  to climb the trees. These are not tapped until they are ten years old,  for although it is possible to obtain the rubber milk before, the vines  are killed or seriously injured if they are cut when too young. Some  rubber shrubs from Brazil have also been planted, but do not flourish as  well as the native kind. Altogether more than a 1000 hectares have been  planted and the various plantations are connected by well kept paths.  More than three hundred natives are employed and the work in the shade  of the forest must be very pleasant. They are housed in a series of huts  in a clearing, which are kept scrupulously clean. There are fifteen or  twenty soldiers here who act as policemen--for only the big towns have a  separate Police force--and guard the rubber and ivory stores. Gum copal  is also found in the district in large quantities and in various  qualities and colours. The brick houses for the two officials face the  lake and gardens have been laid out which are very neat and tidy, the  whole place, although much smaller, rivalling even Irebu in beauty.    Next day I return to Irebu in the _Florida_ a small stern wheel steamer,  and find a welcome mail from home and also a permit to shoot game from  Boma. This latter is an imposing document of nine articles and gives  permission to shoot adult male animals but not female if accompanied by  their young, or, if possible to distinguish them, even if alone. The  animals named are, _hippopotames, baffles, antilopes, gazelles, ibex,  chevrotains, les divers"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15250"],[0,"Myths and Legends of China (#15)"],[1,"ms, swoons, death, may  return or be brought back, and the body revive. Spirits which do not  return or are not brought back may cause mischief, either alone, or by  entry into another human or animal body or even an inanimate object,  and should therefore be propitiated. Hence worship and deification.      The Populous Otherworld    The Chinese pantheon has gradually become so multitudinous that there  is scarcely a being or thing which is not, or has not been at some time  or other, propitiated or worshipped. As there are good and evil people  in this world, so there are gods and demons in the Otherworld: we find  a polytheism limited only by a polydemonism. The dualistic hierarchy is  almost all-embracing. To get a clear idea of this populous Otherworld,  of the supernal and infernal hosts and their organizations, it needs  but to imagine the social structure in its main features as it existed  throughout the greater part of Chinese history, and to make certain  additions. The social structure consisted of the ruler, his court,  his civil, military, and ecclesiastical officials, and his subjects  (classed as Scholars--officials and gentry--Agriculturists, Artisans,  and Merchants, in that order).      Worship of Shang Ti    When these died, their other selves continued to exist and to hold  the same rank in the spirit world as they did in this one. The _ti_,  emperor, became the _Shang Ti_, Emperor on High, who dwelt in _T'ien_,  Heaven (originally the great dome). [11] And Shang Ti, the Emperor  on High, was worshipped by _ti_, the emperor here below, in order to  pacify or please him--to ensure a continuance of his benevolence on  his behalf in the world of spirits. Confusion of ideas and paucity  of primitive language lead to personification and worship of a thing  or being in which a spirit has taken up its abode in place of or in  addition to worship of the spirit itself. Thus Heaven (T'ien) itself  came to be personified and worshipped in addition to Shang Ti, the  Emperor who had gone to Heaven, and who was considered as the chief  ruler in the spiritual world. The worship of Shang Ti was in existence  before that of T'ien was introduced. Shang Ti was worshipped by the  emperor and his family as their ancestor, or the head of the hierarchy  of their ancestors. The people could not worship Shang Ti, for to do so  would imply a familiarity or a claim of relationship punishable with  death. The emperor worshipped his ancestors, the officials theirs,  the people theirs. But, in the same way and sense that the people  worshipped the emperor on earth, as the 'father' of the nation,  namely, by adoration and obeisance, so also could they in this way  and this sense worship Shang Ti. An Englishman may take off his hat  as the king passes in the street to his coronation without taking any  part in the official service in Westminster Abbey. So the 'worship'  of Shang Ti by the people was not done officially or with any special  ceremonial or on fixed State occasions, as in the case of the worship  of Shang Ti by the emperor. This, subject to a qualification to be  mentioned later, is really all that is meant (or should be meant)  when it is said that the Chinese worship Shang Ti.    As regards sacrifices to Shang Ti, these could be offered officially  only by the emperor, as High Priest on earth, who was attended or  assisted in the ceremonies by members of his own family or clan or  the proper State officials (often, even in comparatively modern times,  members of the imperial family or clan). In these official sacrifices,  which formed part of the State worship, the people could not take part;  nor did they at first offer sacrifices to Shang Ti in their own homes  or elsewhere. In what way and to what extent they did so later will  be shown presently.      Worship of T'ien    Owing to T'ien, Heaven, the abode of the spirits, becoming personified,  it came to be worshipped not only by the emperor, but by the people  also. But there was a difference between these two worships, because  the emperor performed his worship of Heaven officially at the great  altar of the Temple of Heaven at Peking (in early times at the altar  in the suburb of the capital), whereas the people (continuing always  to worship their ancestors) worshipped Heaven, when they did so  at all--the custom being observed by some and not by others, just  as in Western countries some people go to church, while others stay  away--usually at the time of the New Year, in a simple, unceremonious  way, by lighting some incense-sticks and waving them toward the sky  in the courtyards of their own houses or in the street just outside  their doors.      Confusion of Shang Ti and T'ien    The qualification necessary to the above description is that, as  time went on and especially since the Sung dynasty (A.D. 960-1280),  much confusion arose regarding Shang Ti and T'ien, and thus it came  about that the terms became mixed and their definitions obscure. This  confusion of ideas has prevailed down to the present time. One result  of this is that the people may sometimes state, when they wave their  incense-sticks or light their candles, that their humble sacrifice  is made to Shang Ti, whom in reality they have no right either to  worship or to offer sacrifice to, but whom they may unofficially pay  respect and make obeisance to, as they might and did to the emperor  behind the high boards on the roadsides which shielded him from their  view as he was borne along in his elaborate procession on the few  occasions when he came forth from the imperial city.    Thus we find that, while only the emperor could worship and sacrifice  to Shang Ti, and only he could officially worship and sacrifice to  T'ien, the people who early personified and worshipped T'ien, as  already shown, came, owing to confusion of the meanings of Shang Ti  and T'ien, unofficially to 'worship' both, but only in the sense and to  the extent indicated, and to offer 'sacrifices' to both, also only in  the sense and to the extent indicated. But for these qualifications,  the statement that the Chinese worship and sacrifice to Shang Ti and  T'ien would be apt to convey an incorrect idea.    From this it will be apparent that Shang Ti, the Supreme Ruler on High,  and T'ien, Heaven (later personified), do not mean 'God' in the sense  that the word is used in the Christian religion. To state that they  do, as so many writers on China have done, without pointing out the  essential differences, is misleading. That Chinese religion was or is  \"a monotheistic worship of God\" is further disproved by the fact that  Shang Ti and T'ien do not appear in the list of the popular pantheon at  all, though all the other gods are there represented. Neither Shang Ti  nor T'ien mean the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or the Father,  Son, and Holy Ghost of the New Testament. Did they mean this, the  efforts of the Christian missionaries to convert the Chinese would be  largely superfluous. The Christian religion, even the Holy Trinity,  is a monotheism. That the Chinese religion (even though a summary  of extracts from the majority of foreign books on China might point  to its being so) is not a monotheism, but a polytheism or even a  pantheism (as long as that term is taken in the sense of universal  deification and not in that of one spiritual being immanent in all  things), the rest of this chapter will abundantly prove.    There have been three periods in which gods have been created in  unusually large numbers: that of the mythical emperor Hsien Yuean  (2698-2598 B.C.), that of Chiang Tzu-ya (in the twelfth century B.C.),  and that of the first emperor of the Ming dynasty (in the fourteenth  century A.D.).      The Otherworld Similar to this World    The similarity of the Otherworld to this world above alluded to is  well shown by Du Bose in his _Dragon, Image, and, Demon_, from which  I quote the following passages:    \"The world of spirits is an exact counterpart of the Chinese Empire,  or, as has been remarked, it is 'China ploughed under'; this is the  world of light; put out the lights and you have Tartarus. China has  eighteen [now twenty-two] provinces, so has Hades; each province has  eight or nine prefects, or departments; so each province in Hades  has eight or nine departments; every prefect or department averages  ten counties, so every department in Hades has ten counties. In  Soochow the Governor, the provincial Treasurer, the Criminal Judge,  the Intendant of Circuit, the Prefect or Departmental Governor, and  the three District Magistrates or County Governors each have temples  with their apotheoses in the other world. Not only these, but every  _yamen_ secretary, runner, executioner, policeman, and constable  has his counterpart in the land of darkness. The market-towns have  also mandarins of lesser rank in charge, besides a host of revenue  collectors, the bureau of government works and other departments,  with several hundred thousand officials, who all rank as gods beyond  the grave. These deities are civilians; the military having a similar  gradation for the armies of Hades, whose captains are gods, and whose  battalions are devils.    \"The framers of this wonderful scheme for the spirits of the dead,  having no higher standard, transferred to the authorities of  that world the etiquette, tastes, and venality of their correlate  officials in the Chinese Government, thus making it necessary to  use similar means to appease the one which are found necessary to  move the other. All the State gods have their assistants, attendants,  door-keepers, runners, horses, horsemen, detectives, and executioners,  corresponding in every particular to those of Chinese officials of  the same rank.\" (Pp. 358-359.)    This likeness explains also why the hierarchy of beings in the  Otherworld concerns itself not only with the affairs of the Otherworld,  but with those of this world as well. So"]]]
