A land where the Se-se-pask-wut-a-tik  (sugar maple tree) grows and flourishes in all its beauty.    \"There, in those wigwams, long ago lived the people whom we call the  Hurons, the Dakotahs and the Ojibways. These Ojibways are cousins of my own  people, the Saulteaux. Well, the story I want to tell you had its beginning  long, long ago. One day there came a great embassage of Indians from the  far South with words of peace and good will. They said that in their  country they had no cold weather, and very seldom saw any snow. They said  that the trees were different, and that many things grew there that they  did not see in our Northern country. They brought with them many presents  and were kindly received by our people, and then, after some weeks of  feasting and speech-making, they returned home laden with the best gifts  our tribes could bestow.    \"Among the presents which these Southern Indians brought was a large  quantity of sugar. This was the first time it was ever seen among the  Indians of the North. It was very much prized, and was very carefully  divided among the people so that each one had a small quantity. It did not  last very long, for everybody was fond of it. When it was all gone the  people were sorry, and the question was asked, 'Why cannot we send a  company of our own people and get more of it?'    \"This suggestion met with the favor of the tribes, and a large party of the  best runners was selected, and being well supplied with rich presents and  pipes of peace they started off to find the Southland and to obtain  abundance of the sugar. Some weeks passed by before word was heard from  them, and the news was very bad. Fierce wars had broken out among the  tribes that lived between ours and those who dwelt in that far South. Our  Indians had to fight for their lives. Many of them were killed, others were  badly wounded, and of the large company that started out not more than half  ever returned to their homes. The expedition was a complete failure.    \"Still there was the memory of the sugar among them, and it happened that  one day in the council somebody said:    \"'Why not send to Nanahboozhoo?'    \"Good!\" shouted Minnehaha; \"that is just what I thought they would do.\"    \"Well, hold on,\" said her more matter-of-fact brother; \"just as like as not  Nanahboozhoo would give them salt instead of sugar, if he were in one of  his tantrums.\"    Souwanas was not displeased at this interruption on the part of the  children, and gladly availed himself of the opportunity thus offered to  once more help himself to the sweets.    Earnestly appealing to Souwanas, Minnehaha, who always looked on the bright  side of things, and who had a quick intuition quite beyond her years, said:    \"It could not be a sweet story if Nanahboozhoo gave them salt instead of  sugar; could it, Souwanas?\"    The old man, as soon as his mouth was sufficiently emptied to resume his  story, amused by the earnestness with which the child appealed to him,  replied with the words, \"Tapwa, tapwa!\" (Verily, verily!)    Sagastao, however, unwilling to give in, retorted, \"O 'tapwa, tapwa'  doesn't mean anything, anyway.\"    Souwanas only laughed at this criticism, and proceeded with his story.    [Illustration: Across a single log at a dizzy height.]    \"So it was decided to send a deputation to Nanahboozhoo to tell him of  the wish of the tribes to have Se-se-pask-wut (sugar), as had the tribes of  the Southland.    \"The deputation who started off to find Nanahboozhoo had a great deal of  difficulty in finding him. It seems that a great strife had arisen between  Nanahboozhoo and some of the underground Muche Munedoos--bad spirits,  sometimes called the Ana-mak-quin--who had determined to kill Nokomis, the  grandmother of Nanahboozhoo, because of their spiteful hatred of  Nanahboozhoo, whom they knew they could not kill because he had  supernatural powers.    \"Nanahboozhoo had, as usual, been playing some of his pranks on them, and  that was why they were determined to kill Nokomis.\"    \"What were some of the tricks that Nanahboozhoo had been up to this time?\"  asked Sagastao.    \"It would take me too long to tell you now,\" replied Souwanas.    \"Nanahboozhoo dearly loved his grandmother, although he was often giving  her great frights, just as other grandsons sometimes do. So when he heard  of what the Muche Munedoos were threatening he took up his grandmother on  his strong back and carried her far away and made for her a tent of maples  in a great forest among the mountains. The only access to it was across a  single log at a dizzy height over a wild rushing river.    \"It was now in the fall of the year, and the leaves of these trees were all  crimson and yellow, so brilliant that when seen from a long distance they  looked like a great fire. Thus it happened that when the bad spirits  following after Nanahboozhoo and Nokomis saw the brilliant colors through  the haze of that Indian Summer day they thought the whole country was on  fire, and they turned back and troubled them no more. Nanahboozhoo was  pleased that the beautiful maple trees had been of so much assistance to  him. He decided to dwell among them for some time, so he prepared a very  comfortable wigwam for himself and his grandmother.    \"It was in the wigwam among the maples that the deputation found  Nanahboozhoo. He received them kindly, and listened to their story and  their request.    \"At first Nanahboozhoo was perplexed. He was such a great traveler that he  had often been down in the great Southland, and well knew how the sugar was  there made. He had seen the fields of sugar cane, and knew the whole  process by which the juice was squeezed out and then boiled down into  sugar. He also knew that it required a lot of hard work before the sugar  was made.    \"When Nokomis heard the request of the deputation to her grandson she was  very much interested--for had not Nanahboozhoo several times, when  returning from those trips to the South, brought back to her some of the  sugar?--and she had liked it very much; and so now she added her pleadings  to theirs that he would in some way grant them their request.    \"Of course Nanahboozhoo could not refuse now, so he told them that, as the  beautiful maple trees had been so good to him and Nokomis, from this time  forward they should, like the sugar cane of the South, yield the sweet sap  that when boiled down would make the sugar they liked so much.    \"He told them, however, that it was not for the lazy ones to have, but only  for those who were industrious and would carry out his commands. Then  Nanahboozhoo described to them the whole process of sugar making. He told  them that only in the spring of the year would the sweet sap flow. Then  they were to have ready their tapping gouges, their spiles and buckets.  Great fireplaces were to be built and here, as fast as the sap was gathered  from the trees, it was to be boiled down in their little kettles into the  nice molasses; and then a little more, so that when it cooled it would  harden into sugar.    \"'Now,' added Nanahboozhoo, 'go back to your people and tell them that it  depends on their industry between now and the spring who shall have the  most of the sugar you love so well.' Then he skillfully modeled out a stone  tapping gouge of the shape required to make the incision in the tree from  which the sap would flow. With his knife he made a sample spile of cedar,  the thin end of which was to be driven into the hole made by the gouge and  along which the sap would flow. Then he told them to make plenty of buckets  of birch bark, and thus be ready when the time came to secure an abundant  supply of sap. Thus the art of making maple sugar first came to be known.  Nanahboozhoo gave it to the Indians long ago. Then when the palefaces came  they followed the same process. That is the way Nanahboozhoo showed us how  to get the maple sugar.\"    But here the sound of the barking of the dogs, and the sweet tones of the  silvery bells on the collars of the dogs that had come for the children,  told that the two hours had passed away.    \"Thank you ever so much,\" said the grateful Minnehaha, as she rose to have  loving hands carefully wrap her up for the return ride, \"for that sweet,  sweet story. It was so good of Nanahboozhoo to tell them about the sap in  the maple trees, even if it is only there in the spring time.\"    \"I think old Nokomis deserves a good deal of the credit,\" said Sagastao.  \"It seems to me that Nanahboozhoo would not have done it if she had not  made him.\"    \"Well, Nanahboozhoo did it, anyway, and so we and the Indians have our  maple sugar and molasses, and I am glad. And so, hurrah for Nanahboozhoo!\"  Thus replied Minnehaha.    Here Souwanas lifted the well-wrapped-up child, and carried her out to the  cariole, where she and her brother were speedily covered and tucked in  among the warm robes.    \"Marche! Marche!\" was shouted to the dogs by the driver, and away they sped  over the icy trail with such speed that it was not long ere they were again  safe and happy in their own cozy home.          CHAPTER XI.      Mary Relates the Legend of the Origin of Disease--The  Queer Councils Held by the Animals Against Their Common  Enemy, Man.    \"Mary, how is it that I get sick sometimes,\" said Sagastao the following  summer, \"and have to take medicine that I dislike? Why can't we always be  well?\"    For the last week or ten days Mary had been most devoted and faithful in  watchful care over her restless charge, who had been very sick but was now  rapidly recovering.    \"As soon as you are a little stronger I will tell you the legends of  sickness and medicine, as handed down by our Indian forefathers,\" said  Mary, \"but now you must only rest, and eat, and sleep.\"    \"Well, Sakehow\" (beloved), his pet name for his faithful nurse, \"I will try  and mind you; don't forget.\"    The next week was one of rapid recovery, and very proud, indeed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10956"],[0,"Indian speeches (1907-1909) (#15)"],[1,"em. They will do their best to  keep down mutinous opposition. They hope to attract that good will  which must, after all, be the real foundation of our prosperity and  strength in India. We believe that this admission of the Indians to a  larger and more direct share in the government of their country and in  all the affairs of their country, without for a moment taking from  the central power its authority, will fortify the foundations of our  position. It will require great steadiness, constant pursuit of the  same objects, and the maintenance of our authority, which will be all  the more effective if we have, along with our authority, the aid and  assistance, in responsible circumstances, of the Indians themselves.    Military strength, material strength, we have in abundance. What we  still want to acquire is moral strength--moral strength in guiding  and controlling the people of India in the course on which time is  launching them. I should like to read a few lines from a great orator  about India. It was a speech delivered by Mr. Bright in 1858, when the  Government of India Bill was in another place. Mr. Bright said--        \"We do not know how to leave India, and therefore let us see if we      know how to govern it. Let us abandon all that system of calumny      against natives of India which has lately prevailed. Had that      people not been docile, the most governable race in the world, how      could you have maintained your power there for 100 years? Are they      not industrious, are they not intelligent, are they not, upon the      evidence of the most distinguished men the Indian service ever      produced, endowed with many qualities which make them respected by      all Englishmen who mix with them?... I would not permit any man      in my presence without rebuke to indulge in the calumnies and      expressions of contempt which I have recently heard poured forth      without measure upon the whole population of India.... The people      of India do not like us, but they would scarcely know where      to turn if we left them. They are sheep, literally without a      shepherd.\"    However, that may be, we at least at Westminster here have no choice  and no option. As an illustrious Member of this House wrote--        \"We found a society in a state of decomposition, and we have      undertaken the serious and stupendous process of reconstructing      it.\"    Macaulay, for it was he, said--        \"India now is like Europe in the fifth century.\"    Yes, a stupendous process indeed. The process has gone on with  marvellous success, and if we all, according to our various lights,  are true to our colours, that process will go on. Whatever is said, I  for one--though I am not what is commonly called an Imperialist--so  far from denying, I most emphatically affirm, that for us to preside  over this transition from the fifth European century in some parts, in  slow, uneven stages, up to the twentieth--so that you have before you  all the centuries at once as it were--for us to preside over that, and  to be the guide of peoples in that condition, is, if conducted with  humanity and sympathy, with wisdom, with political courage, not only a  human duty, but what has been often and most truly called one of the  most glorious tasks ever confided to any powerful State in the history  of civilised mankind.          VI      HINDUS AND MAHOMETANS    (AT THE INDIA OFFICE. JANUARY, 1909)    [A deputation of the London Branch of the All-Indian Moslem League  waited upon the Secretary of State, in order to represent to him the  views of the Mussulmans of India on the projected Indian reforms.]    I am delighted to meet you to-day, because I have always felt in my  political experience, now pretty long, that it is when face answers  to face that you come best to points of controversial issue. I have  listened to the able speech of my friend Mr. Ameer Ali and to the  speech that followed, with close attention, not merely for the sake  of the arguments upon the special points raised, but because the  underlying feeling and the animating spirit of the two speeches are  full of encouragement. Why? Because instead of any hostile attitude  to our reforms as a whole, I find that you welcome them cordially and  with gratitude. I cannot say with what satisfaction I receive that  announcement. If you will allow me, I will, before I come to the  special points, say a few words upon the general position.    It is only five weeks, I think, since our scheme was launched, and I  am bound to say that at the end of those five weeks the position may  fairly be described as hopeful and promising. I do not think that the  millennium will come in five more weeks, nor in fifty weeks; but I do  say that for a scheme of so wide a scope to be received as this scheme  has been received, is a highly encouraging sign. It does not follow  that because we have launched our ship with a slant of fair wind, this  means the same thing as getting into harbour. There are plenty of  difficult points that we have got to settle. But when I try from my  conning-tower in this office, to read the signs in the political  skies, I am full of confidence. The great thing is that in every party  both in India and at home--in every party, and every section, and  every group--there is a recognition of the magnitude and the gravity  of the enterprise on which we have embarked. I studied very closely  the proceedings at Madras, and the proceedings at Amritsar, and in  able speeches made in both those places I find a truly political  spirit in the right sense of the word--in the sense of perspective and  proportion--which I sometimes wish could be imitated by some of my  political friends nearer home. I mean that issues, important enough  but upon which there is some difference, are put aside--for the time  only, if you like, but still put aside--in face of the magnitude of  the issues that we present to you in these reforms. On Monday, in _The  Times_ newspaper, there was a long and most interesting communication  from Bombay, written, I believe, by a gentleman of very wide Indian  knowledge and level-headed humour. What does he say? He takes account  of the general position as he found it in India shortly after my  Despatch arrived. \"I might have dwelt,\" he says, \"upon the fact that  I have not met a single official who does not admit that some changes  which should gratify Indian longings were necessary, and I might have  expatiated upon the abounding evidence that Lord Morley's despatch  and speech have unquestionably eased a tension which had become  exceedingly alarming.\" That is a most important thing, and I believe  Parliament has fully recognised it.    We cannot fold our arms and say that things are to go on as they did  before, and I rejoice to see what this gentleman says. He is talking  of officials, and I always felt from the beginning that if we did not  succeed in carrying with us the goodwill of that powerful service,  there would be reason for suspecting that we were wrong upon the  merits, and even if we were not wrong on the merits, there would  be reason for apprehending formidable difficulties. I have myself  complete confidence in them. I see in some journals of my own party  suspicions thrown upon the loyalty of that service to his Majesty's  Government of the day. It is absurd to think anything of the kind. If  our policy and our proposals receive the approval of Parliament and  the approval of officials, such as those spoken of in _The Times_ the  other day, I am perfectly sure there will be no more want of goodwill  and zeal on the part of the Indian Civil Service, than there would  be in the officers of his Majesty's Fleet, or his Majesty's Army. It  would be just the same. I should like to read another passage from  _The Times_ letter:--\"It would probably be incorrect to say that  the bulk of the Civil Service in the Bombay Presidency are gravely  apprehensive. Most of them are not unnaturally anxious\"--I agree;  it is perfectly natural that they should be anxious--\"but the main  officials in whose judgment most confidence can be placed, regard the  future with the buoyant hopefulness without which an Englishman in  India is lost indeed.\" All that is reassuring, and no sign nor whisper  reaches me that any responsible man or any responsible section or  creed, either in India or here, has any desire whatever to wreck our  scheme. And let me go further. Statesmen abroad showing themselves  capable of reflection, are watching us with interest and wishing us  well. Take the remarkable utterance of President Roosevelt the other  day at Washington. And if we turn from Washington to Eastern Europe, I  know very well that any injustice, any suspicion that we were capable  of being unjust, to Mahomedans in India, would certainly provoke a  severe and injurious reaction in Constantinople. I am alive to all  these things. Mr. Ameer Ali said he was sure the Secretary of State  would mete out just and equitable treatment to all interests, if their  views were fairly laid before him. He did me no more than justice.    The Government are entirely zealous and in earnest, acting in thorough  good faith, in the desire to press forward these proposals. I may tell  you that our Bill is now quite ready. I shall introduce it at the  first minute after the Address is over, and, when it reaches the  Commons, it will be pressed forward with all the force and resolution  that Parliamentary conditions permit. These are not mere pious  opinions or academic reforms; they are proposals that are to take  Parliamentary shape at the earliest possible moment; and after taking  Parliamentary shape, no time will, I know, be lost in India in  bringing them as rapidly as possible into practical operation.    Now the first point Mr. Ameer Ali made was upon the unfairness to the  members of the Mahomedan community, caused by reckoning in the Hindu  census a large"]]]
