(#15)"],[1,"translation  of Virgil: He contributed by his Version of the eleventh Satire  of Juvenal, to the translation of that poet, published also by Mr.  Dryden, to whom Mr. Congreve wrote a copy of Verses on his Translation  of Persius. He wrote likewise a Prologue for a Play of Mr. Charles  Dryden's, full of kindness for that young gentleman, and of respect  for his father.    But the noblest testimony he gave of his filial regard to the memory  of his poetical father, Mr. John Dryden, was the Panegyric he wrote  upon his works, contained in the dedication of Dryden's plays to the  duke of Newcastle.    Mr. Congreve translated the third Book of Ovid's Art of Love; some  favourite passages from the Iliad, and writ some Epigrams, in all  which he was not unsuccessful, though at the same time he has been  exceeded by his cotemporaries in the same attempts.    The author of the elegant Letters, not long ago published under the  name of Fitz Osborne, has taken some pains to set before his readers;  the version of those parts of Homer, translated by our author, and  the same passages by Pope and Tickell, in which comparison the palm is  very deservedly yielded to Pope.    Our author wrote a Satire called Doris, celebrated by Sir Richard  Steele, who was a warm friend to Mr. Congreve. He also wrote the  Judgment of Paris, a Masque; and the Opera of Semele; of these, the  former was acted with great applause, and the latter is finely set  to music by Mr. Eccles. The last of his Poetical Works, is his Art of  Pleasing, addressed to Sir Richard Temple, the late viscount Cobham.  He has written many Prose Epistles, dispersed in the works of other  writers, and his Essay on Humour in Comedy, published in a Collection  of Dennis's Letters, is an entertaining, and correct piece of  criticism: All his other Letters are written with a great deal of wit  and spirit, a fine flow of language; and are so happily intermixt with  a lively and inoffensive raillery, that it is impossible not to be  pleased with them at the first reading: we may be satisfied from the  perusal of them, that his conversation must have been very engaging,  and therefore we need not wonder that he was caressed by the greatest  men of his time, or that they courted his friendship by every act of  kindness in their power.    It is said of Mr. Congreve, that he was a particular favourite with  the ladies, some of whom were of the first distinction. He indulged  none of those reveries, and affected absences so peculiar to men of  wit: He was sprightly as well as elegant in his manner, and so much  the favourite of Henrietta duchess of Marlborough, that even after  his death, she caused an image of him to be every day placed at her  toilet-table, to which she would talk as to the living Mr. Congreve,  with all the freedom of the most polite and unreserved conversation.  Mrs. Bracegirdle likewise had the highest veneration for our author,  and joined with her Grace in a boundless profusion of sorrow upon his  death. Some think, he had made a better figure in his Last Will, had  he remembered his friendship he professed for Mrs. Bracegirdle, whose  admirable performance added spirit to his dramatic pieces; but he  forgot her, and gratified his vanity by chusing to make a rich duchess  his sole legatee, and executrix.    Mr. Congreve was the son of fortune, as well as of the muses. He was  early preferred to an affluent situation, and no change of ministry  ever affected him, nor was he ever removed from any post he enjoyed,  except to a better.    His place in the custom-house, and his office of secretary in Jamaica,  are said to have brought him in upwards of 1200 l. a year; and he was  so far an oeconomist, as to raise from thence a competent estate. No  man of his learning ever pass'd thro' life with more ease, or less  envy; and as in the dawn of his reputation he was very dear to the  greatest wits of his time, so during his whole life he preserved the  utmost respect of, and received continual marks of esteem from, men  of genius and letters, without ever being involved, in any of their  quarrels, or drawing upon himself the least mark of distaste, or, even  dissatisfaction. The greatest part of the last twenty years of his  life were spent in ease and retirement, and he gave himself no trouble  about reputation. When the celebrated Voltaire was in England, he  waited upon Congreve, and pass'd some compliments upon him, as to the  reputation and merit of his works; Congreve thanked him, but at  the same time told that ingenious foreigner, he did not chuse to be  considered as an author, but only as a private gentleman, and in that  light expected to be visited. Voltaire answered, 'That if he had never  been any thing but a private gentleman, in all probability, he had  never been troubled with that visit.'    Mr. Voltaire upon this occasion observes, that he was not a little  disgusted with so unseasonable a piece of vanity:--This was indeed the  highest instance of it, that perhaps can be produced. A man who owed  to his wit and writings the reputation, as well as the fortune, he  acquired, pretending to divest himself of human nature to such a  degree, as to have no consciousness of his own merit, was the most  absurd piece of vanity that ever entered into the heart of man; and  of all vanity, that is the greatest which masks itself under the  appearance of the opposite quality.    Towards the close of his life, he was much troubled with the gout;  and for this reason, in the summer of the year 1728, he made a tour to  Bath, for the benefit of the waters, where he had the misfortune to be  overturned in his chariot, from which time he complained of a pain in  his side, which was supposed to arise from some inward bruise. Upon  his return to London, he perceived his health gradually decline, which  he bore with fortitude and resignation.    On January the 19th, 1728-9, he yielded his last breath, about five  o'clock in the morning, at his house in Surrey-street in the Strand,  in the fifty-seventh year of his age. On the sunday following, January  26, his corpse lay in state in the Jerusalem-Chamber, from whence the  same evening, between the hours of nine and ten, it was carried with  great decency and solemnity to Henry the VIIth's Chapel; and after the  funeral service was performed, it was interred in the Abbey. The pall  was supported by the duke of Bridgewater, earl of Godolphin, lord  Cobham, lord Wilmington, the honourable George Berkley, Esq; and  Brigadier-general Churchill; and colonel Congreve followed his corpse  as chief mourner; some time after, a neat and elegant monument was  erected to his memory, by Henrietta duchess of Marlborough.    Mr. Congreve's reputation is so extensive, and his works so generally  read, that any specimen of his poetry may be deemed superfluous. But  finding an epistle of our author's in the Biographia Brittannica, not  inserted in his works, it may not be improper to give it a place here.  It is addressed to the lord viscount Cobham, and the ingenious authors  inform us, that they copied it from a MS. very correct.    As in this poem there is a visible allusion to the measures, which the  writer thought were too complaisant to the French, it is evident it  must have been penned but a very small time before his death.      Of improving the present time.        Sincerest critic of my prose, or rhyme.    Tell how thy pleasing Stowe employs thy time.    Say, Cobham, what amuses thy retreat?    Or stratagems of war, or schemes of state?    Dost thou recall to mind, with joy or grief,    Great Marlbro's actions? that immortal chief,    Whose highest trophy, rais'd in each campaign,    More than suffic'd to signalize a reign.    Does thy remembrance rising, warm thy heart    With glory past, where thou thyself had'st part;    Or do'st thou grieve indignant, now to see    The fruitless end of all thy victory!    To see th' audacious foe, so late subdu'd,    Dispute those terms for which so long they su'd,    As if Britannia now were sunk so low,    To beg that peace she wanted to bestow.    Be far, that guilt! be never known that shame!    That England should retract her rightful claim!    Or ceasing to be dreaded and ador'd,    Stain with her pen the lustre of her sword.    Or dost thou give the winds, a-far to blow,    Each vexing thought, and heart-devouring woe,    And fix thy mind alone on rural scenes,    To turn the levell'd lawns to liquid plains;    To raise the creeping rills from humble beds,    And force the latent springs to lift their heads;    On watry columns capitals to rear,    That mix their flowing curls with upper air?    Or dost thou, weary grown, late works neglect,    No temples, statues, obelisks erect;    But catch the morning breeze from fragrant meads.    Or shun the noon-tide ray in wholesome shades;    Or lowly walk along the mazy wood,    To meditate on all that's wise and good:    For nature, bountiful, in thee has join'd,    A person pleasing, with a worthy mind,    Not giv'n the form alone, but means and art,    To draw the eye, or to allure the heart.    Poor were the praise, in fortune to excel,    Yet want the way to use that fortune well.    While thus adorn'd, while thus with virtue crown'd,    At home in peace; abroad, in arms renown'd;    Graceful in form, and winning in address,    While well you think, what aptly you express;    With health, with honour, with a fair estate,    A table free, and elegantly neat.    What can be added more to mortal bliss?    What can he want that stands possest of this?    What can the fondest wishing mother more,    Of heav'n attentive, for her son implore?    And yet, a happiness remains unknown,    Or to philosophy reveal'd alone;    A precept which, unpractis'd, renders vain    Thy flowing hopes, and pleasure turns to pain.

But the  world was pitiless to them; it had no compassion for their youth and  their sufferings; with cruel hands it dashed away this tender blossoming  of nascent affection, which was beginning to expand in their hearts.  Josephine had wedded Hortense to her brother-in-law in order to secure  in him an ally in the family, and to keep her daughter by her side; and  now that daughter was made the target of insidious attacks and malicious  calumnies--now another plan was adopted in order to remove Hortense from  the scene. The conspirators had not succeeded in their designs by means  of a matrimonial alliance, so they would now try the effect of calumny.    They went about whispering from ear to ear that Bonaparte had married  his step-daughter to his brother, simply because he was attached to her  himself, and had been jealous of Duroc.    These slanders were carried so far as to hint that the child whose birth  Hortense expected was more nearly related to Bonaparte than merely  through the fact that his step-daughter was his brother's wife.    This was an infernal but skilfully-planned calumny; for those who  devised it well knew how Bonaparte detested the merest suspicion of such  immorality, how strict he was in his own principles, and how repulsive  it therefore would be to him to find himself made the object of such  infamous slanders.    The conspirators calculated that, in order to terminate these evil  rumors, the first consul would send his brother and Hortense away to a  distance, and that the fated Josephine, being thus isolated, could also  be the more readily removed. Thus Bonaparte, being separated from his  guardian angel, would no longer hear her whispering:    \"Bonaparte, do not ascend the throne! Be content with the glory of the  greatest of mankind! Place no diadem upon thy brows; do not make  thyself a king!\"    In Paris, as I have said, these shameful calumnies were but very lightly  whispered, but abroad they were only the more loudly heard. Bonaparte's  enemies got hold of the scandalous story, and made a weapon of it with  which to assail him as a hero.    One morning Bonaparte was reading an English newspaper which had always  been hostile to him, and which, as he well knew, was the organ of Count  d'Artois, then residing at Hartwell. As he continued to read, a dark  shadow stole over his face, and he crumpled the paper in his clinched  fist with a sudden and vehement motion. Then as suddenly again his  countenance cleared, and a proud smile flitted across it. He had his  master of ceremonies summoned to his presence, and bade him issue the  necessary invitations for a court ball to be given, on the evening of  the next day, at St. Cloud. He then went to Josephine to inform her in  person of the projected _fete_, and to say that he wished her to tell  Hortense, who had been ailing for some time, that he particularly  desired her to be present.    Hortense had been too long accustomed to obey her step-father's  requests, to venture a refusal. She rose, therefore, from her couch on  which she had been in the habit, for weeks past, of reclining, busied  with her own dreams and musings, and bade her waiting women prepare her  attire for the ball. Still she felt unwell, and seriously burdened by  this festive attire, which harmonized so little with her feelings, and  was so far from becoming to her figure, for she was only a few weeks  from her confinement; but with her gentle and yielding disposition she  did not venture, even in thought, to murmur at the compulsion imposed  upon her by her step-father's command. She therefore repaired, at the  appointed hour, to the ball at St. Cloud. Bonaparte stepped forward to  meet her with a friendly smile, and, instead of thanking her for coming  at all, earnestly urged her to dance.    Hortense gazed at him with amazement. She knew that hitherto Bonaparte  had always sought to avoid the sight of a woman in her condition; he had  frequently said that he thought there was nothing more indecent than for  a female to join in the dance under such circumstances, and now it was  he who asked her to do that very thing.    For this reason Hortense hesitated at first to comply, but Bonaparte  grew only the more pressing and vehement in his request.    \"You know how I like to see you dance, Hortense,\" he said, with his  irresistible smile; \"so do this much for me, even if you take the floor  only once, and that for but a single _contredance_.\"    And Hortense, although most reluctant, although blushing with shame at  the idea of exposing herself in such unseemly shape to the gaze of all,  obeyed and joined the dances.    This took place in the evening--how greatly surprised, then, was  Hortense when next morning she found, in the paper that she usually  read, a poem, extolling her performance in words of ravishing flattery,  and referring to the fact that, notwithstanding her advanced state of  pregnancy, she had consented to tread a measure in the _contredance_, as  a peculiar trait of amiability!    Hortense, however, far from feeling flattered by this very emphatic  piece of verse, took it as an affront, and hastened at once to the  Tuileries, to complain to her mother, and to ask her how it was possible  that, so early as the very next morning, there could be verses published  in the newspapers concerning what had taken place at the ball on the  preceding evening.    Bonaparte, who happened to be with Josephine when Hortense came in, and  was the first to be questioned by her, gave her only an evasive and  jocose reply, and withdrew. Hortense then turned to her mother, who was  leaning over on the divan, her eyes reddened with weeping and her heart  oppressed with grief. To her, Bonaparte had given no evasive answer, but  had told the whole truth, and Josephine's heart was at that moment too  full of wretchedness, too overladen with this fresh and bitter trouble,  for her possibly to retain it within her own breast.    Hortense insisted upon an explanation, and her mother gave it. She told  her that Bonaparte had got the poet Esmenard to write the verses  beforehand, and that it was for this reason that he had urged her to  dance; that he had ordered the ball for no other purpose than to have  her dance, and have the poem that complimented her and referred to her  pregnancy published in the next day's paper.    Then, when Hortense, in terror, begged to be informed of the ground for  all these proceedings, Josephine had the cruel courage to tell her of  the slanders that had been circulated in reference to herself and  Bonaparte, and to say that he had arranged the poem, the ball, and her  participation in the dance, because, on the preceding day, he had read  in an English journal the calumnious statement that Madame Louis  Bonaparte had safely given birth to a vigorous and healthy child some  weeks previously, and he wished in this manner to refute the malicious  statement.    Hortense received this fresh wound with a cold smile of scorn. She had  not a word of anger or indignation for this unheard-of injury, this  shameless slander; she neither wept nor complained, but, as she rose to  take leave of her mother, she swooned away, and it required hours of  exertion to restore her to consciousness.    A few weeks later, Hortense was delivered of a dead male infant, and so  passed away her last dream of happiness; for thus was destroyed the hope  of a better understanding between her and her husband.    Hortense rose from her sick-bed with a firm, determined heart. In those  long, lonely days that she had passed during her confinement, she had  the time and opportunity to meditate on many things, and keenly to  estimate her whole present position and probable future. She had now  become a mother, without having a child; yet the resolute energy of a  mother remained to her. The youthful, gentle, dreamy, enthusiastic girl  had now become transformed into a determined, active, energetic woman,  that would no longer bow submissively to the blows of fortune, but would  meet them with an open and defiant brow. Since her fate could not be  changed, she accepted it, all the while resolved no longer to bend to  its yoke, but to subdue it, and try to be happy by force of resolution;  and, since a charming, peaceful, and harmonious fireside at home was  denied her, to at least make her house a pleasant gathering-point for  her friends--for men of scientific and artistic attainments, for poets  and singers, for painters and sculptors, and for men of learning. Ere  long, all Paris was talking about Madame Louis Bonaparte's  drawing-rooms, the agreeable and elegant entertainments that were given  there, and the concerts there arranged, in which the first singers of  the day executed pieces that Hortense had composed, and Talma recited,  with his wonderful, sonorous voice, the poems that she had written.  Every one was anxious for admission to these entertainments, in which  the participants not merely performed their parts, but greatly enjoyed  themselves as well; where the guests indulged in no backbiting or abuse,  but found more worthy and elevated subjects of conversation; where, in  fine, they could admire the works of poets and artists, and enjoy the  newly, awakened intellectual spirit of the age.    Hortense had firmly made up her mind that, since she had resigned  herself to accept the burden of existence, she would strive to render it  as agreeable as possible, and not to see any of its hateful and  repulsive features, but to turn away from them with a noble and  disdainful pride. She had never even referred to the frightful calumnies  which her mother had"]]]
