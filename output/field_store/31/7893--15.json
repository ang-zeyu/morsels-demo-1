Let  them be instantly liberated. This is my first act of gratitude to God,  who has so infinitely blessed me!\"    Anielka longed ardently to behold her native land. They left Vienna  immediately after the wedding, although it was in the middle of  January.    It was already quite dark when the carriage, with its four horses,  stopped in front of the portico of the palace of Olgogrod. Whilst the  footman was opening the door on one side, a beggar soliciting alms  appeared at the other, where Anielka was seated. Happy to perform a  good action as she crossed the threshold of her new home, she gave him  some money; but the man, instead of thanking her, returned her bounty  with a savage laugh, at the same time scowling at her in the fiercest  manner from beneath his thick and shaggy brows. The strangeness  of this circumstance sensibly affected Anielka, and clouded her  happiness. Leon soothed and reassured her. In the arms of her beloved  husband she forgot all but the happiness of being the idol of his  affections.    Fatigue and excitement made the night most welcome. All was dark and  silent around the palace, and some hours of the night had passed,  when suddenly flames burst forth from several parts of the building at  once. The palace was enveloped in fire; it raged furiously. The flames  mounted higher and higher; the windows cracked with a fearful sound,  and the smoke penetrated into the most remote apartments.    A single figure of a man was seen stealing over the snow, which lay  like a winding-sheet on the solitary waste; his cautious steps were  heard on the frozen snow as it crisped beneath his tread. It was the  beggar who had accosted Anielka. On a rising ground he turned to gaze  on the terrible scene.    \"No more unfortunate creatures will now be doomed to pass their lives  in your dungeons,\" he exclaimed. \"What was _my_ crime? Reminding my  master of the lowness of his birth. For this they tore me from my only  child--my darling little Anielka; they had no pity even for her orphan  state; let them perish all!\"    Suddenly a young and beautiful creature rushes wildly to one of the  principal windows: she makes a violent effort to escape. For a moment  her lovely form, clothed in white, shines in terrible relief against  the background of blazing curtains and walls of fire, and as instantly  sinks back into the blazing element. Behind her is another figure,  vainly endeavoring to aid her--he perishes also: neither of them are  ever seen again!    This appalling tragedy horrified even the perpetrator of the crime. He  rushed from the place, and as he heard the crash of the falling walls,  he closed his ears with his hands, and darted on faster and faster.    The next day some peasants discovered the body of a man frozen  to death, lying on a heap of snow--it was that of the wretched  incendiary. Providence, mindful of his long, of his cruel imprisonment  and sufferings, spared him the anguish of knowing that the mistress of  the palace he had destroyed, and who perished in the flames, was his  own beloved daughter--the Serf of Pobereze!           *       *       *       *       *    A TRUE POET never takes a \"poetic license.\"           *       *       *       *       *    FROM THE DUBLIN UNIVERSITY MAGAZINE.    THE MYSTERIOUS COMPACT.    IN TWO PARTS.--PART I.      In the latter years of the last century, two youths, Ferdinand Von  Hallberg and Edward Von Wensleben were receiving their education in  the military academy of Mariensheim. Among their schoolfellows they  were called Orestes and Pylades, or Damon and Pythias, on account  of their tender friendship, which constantly recalled to their  schoolfellows' minds the history of these ancient worthies. Both were  sons of officers who had long served the state with honor, both were  destined for their father's profession, both accomplished and endowed  by nature with no mean talents. But fortune had not been so impartial  in the distribution of her favors--Hallberg's father lived on a small  pension, by means of which he defrayed the expenses of his son's  schooling at the cost of the government; while Wensleben's parents  willingly paid the handsomest salary in order to insure to their  only child the best education which the establishment afforded.  This disparity in circumstances at first produced a species of proud  reserve, amounting to coldness, in Ferdinand's deportment, which  yielded by degrees to the cordial affection that Edward manifested  toward him on every occasion. Two years older than Edward, of a  thoughtful and almost melancholy turn of mind, Ferdinand soon gained  a considerable influence over his weaker friend, who clung to him with  almost girlish dependence.    Their companionship had now lasted with satisfaction and happiness to  both, for several years, and the youths had formed for themselves the  most delightful plans--how they were never to separate, how they were  to enter the service in the same regiment, and if a war broke out,  how they were to fight side by side, and conquer or die together. But  destiny, or rather Providence--whose plans are usually opposed to the  designs of mortals--had ordained otherwise.    Earlier than was expected, Hallberg's father found an opportunity to  have his son appointed to an infantry regiment, and he was ordered  immediately to join the staff in a small provincial town, in an  out-of-the-way mountainous district. This announcement fell like a  thunderbolt on the two friends; but Ferdinand considered himself by  far the more unhappy, since it was ordained that he should be the one  to sever the happy bond that bound them, and to inflict a deep wound  on his loved companion. His schoolfellows vainly endeavored to console  him by calling his attention to his new commission, and the preference  which had been shown him above so many others. He only thought of the  approaching separation; he only saw his friend's grief, and passed the  few remaining days that were allowed him at the academy by Edward's  side, who husbanded every moment of his Ferdinand's society with  jealous care, and could not bear to lose sight of him for an instant.  In one of their most melancholy hours, excited by sorrow and youthful  enthusiasm, they bound themselves by a mysterious vow, namely, that  the one whom God should think fit to call first from this world,  should bind himself (if conformable to the Divine will) to give some  sign of his remembrance and affection to the survivor.    The place where this vow was made was a solitary spot in the garden,  by a monument of gray marble, overshadowed by dark firs, which the  former director of the institution had caused to be erected to the  memory of his son, whose premature death was recorded on the stone.    Here the friends met at night, and by the fitful light of the moon  they pledged themselves to the rash and fanciful contract, and  confirmed and consecrated it the next morning by a religious ceremony.  After this they were able to look the approaching separation in the  face more manfully, and Edward strove hard to quell the melancholy  feeling which had lately arisen in his mind on account of the constant  foreboding that Ferdinand expressed of his own early death. \"No,\"  thought Edward, \"his pensive turn of mind and his wild imagination  cause him to reproach himself without a cause for my sorrow and his  own departure. Oh, no, Ferdinand will not die early--he will not die  before me. Providence will not leave me alone in the world.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The lonely Edward strove hard to console himself, for after  Ferdinand's departure, the house, the world itself, seemed a desert;  and absorbed by his own memories, he now recalled to mind many a dark  speech which had fallen from his absent friend, particularly in the  latter days of their intercourse, and which betokened but too plainly  a presentiment of early death. But time and youth exercised, even  over these sorrows, their irresistible influence. Edward's spirits  gradually recovered their tone, and as the traveler always has the  advantage over the one who remains behind, in respect of new objects  to occupy his mind, so was Ferdinand even sooner calmed and cheered,  and by degrees he became engrossed by his new duties and new  acquaintances, not to the exclusion, indeed, of his friend's memory,  but greatly to the alienation of his own sorrow. It was natural, in  such circumstances, that the young officer should console himself  sooner than poor Edward. The country in which Hallberg found  himself was wild and mountainous, but possessed all the charms and  peculiarities of \"far off\" districts--simple, hospitable manners,  old-fashioned customs, many tales and legends which arise from  the credulity of the mountaineers, who invariably lean toward the  marvelous, and love to people the wild solitudes with invisible  beings.    Ferdinand had soon, without seeking for it, made acquaintance with  several respectable families in the town; and as it generally  happens in such cases, he had become quite domesticated in the best  country-houses in the neighborhood; and the well-mannered, handsome,  and agreeable youth was welcomed everywhere. The simple, patriarchal  life in these old mansions and castles--the cordiality of the people,  the wild, picturesque scenery, nay, the very legends themselves, were  entirely to Hallberg's taste. He adapted himself easily to his new  mode of life, but his heart remained tranquil. This could not last.  Before half a year had passed, the battalion to which he belonged was  ordered to another station, and he had to part with many friends. The  first letter which he wrote after this change bore the impression  of impatience at the breaking up of a happy time. Edward found this  natural enough; but he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13650"],[0,"Nonsense Books (#15)"],[1,"them in gray, and banged them all day,      Round the walls of the city of Pisa.
