What  then is the reason?    The chief thing (the ruling thing) is inconsistency and confusion in the  things which relate to good and evil. But different men have different  reasons; and generally what they imagine to be base, they do not confess  at all. But they suppose timidity to be a characteristic of a good  disposition, and compassion also; but silliness to be the absolute  characteristic of a slave. And they do not at all admit (confess) the  things which are offences against society. But in the case of most  errors for this reason chiefly they are induced to confess them, because  they imagine that there is something involuntary in them as in timidity  and compassion; and if a man confess that he is in any respect  intemperate, he alleges love (or passion) as an excuse for what is  involuntary. But men do not imagine injustice to be at all involuntary.  There is also in jealousy, as they suppose, something involuntary; and  for this reason they confess to jealousy also.    Living then among such men, who are so confused, so ignorant of what  they say, and of the evils which they have or have not, and why they  have them, or how they shall be relieved of them, I think it is worth  the trouble for a man to watch constantly (and to ask) whether I also am  one of them, what imagination I have about myself, how I conduct myself,  whether I conduct myself as a prudent man, whether I conduct myself as a  temperate man, whether I ever say this, that I have been taught to be  prepared for everything that may happen. Have I the consciousness, which  a man who knows nothing ought to have, that I know nothing? Do I go to  my teacher as men go to oracles, prepared to obey? or do I like a  snivelling boy go to my school to learn history and understand the books  which I did not understand before, and, if it should happen so, to  explain them also to others? Man, you have had a fight in the house with  a poor slave, you have turned the family upside down, you have  frightened the neighbors, and you come to me as if you were a wise man,  and you take your seat and judge how I have explained some word, and how  I have babbled whatever came into my head. You come full of envy, and  humbled, because you bring nothing from home; and you sit during the  discussion thinking of nothing else than how your father is disposed  towards you and your brother. What are they saying about me there? now  they think that I am improving, and are saying, He will return with all  knowledge. I wish I could learn everything before I return; but much  labor is necessary, and no one sends me anything, and the baths at  Nicopolis are dirty; everything is bad at home, and bad here.           *       *       *       *       *    ON FRIENDSHIP.--What a man applies himself to earnestly, that he  naturally loves. Do men then apply themselves earnestly to the things  which are bad? By no means. Well, do they apply themselves to things  which in no way concern themselves? Not to these either. It remains then  that they employ themselves earnestly only about things which are good;  and if they are earnestly employed about things, they love such things  also. Whoever then understands what is good can also know how to love;  but he who cannot distinguish good from bad, and things which are  neither good nor bad from both, how can he possess the power of loving?  To love, then, is only in the power of the wise.    For universally, be not deceived, every animal is attached to nothing so  much as to its own interests. Whatever then appears to it an impediment  to this interest, whether this be a brother, or a father, or a child, or  beloved, or lover, it hates, spurns, curses; for its nature is to love  nothing so much as its own interests: this is father, and brother, and  kinsman, and country, and God. When then the gods appear to us to be an  impediment to this, we abuse them and throw down their statues and burn  their temples, as Alexander ordered the temples of Aesculapius to be  burned when his dear friend died.    For this reason, if a man put in the same place his interest, sanctity,  goodness, and country, and parents, and friends, all these are secured:  but if he puts in one place his interest, in another his friends, and  his country and his kinsmen and justice itself, all these give way,  being borne down by the weight of interest. For where the I and the Mine  are placed, to that place of necessity the animal inclines; if in the  flesh, there is the ruling power; if in the will, it is there; and if it  is in externals, it is there. If then I am there where my will is, then  only shall I be a friend such as I ought to be, and son, and father; for  this will be my interest, to maintain the character of fidelity, of  modesty, of patience, of abstinence, of active co-operation, of  observing my relations (towards all). But if I put myself in one place,  and honesty in another, then the doctrine of Epicurus becomes strong,  which asserts either that there is no honesty or it is that which  opinion holds to be honest (virtuous).    It was through this ignorance that the Athenians and the Lacedaemonians  quarrelled, and the Thebans with both; and the great king quarrelled  with Hellas, and the Macedonians with both: and the Romans with the  Getae. And still earlier the Trojan war happened for these reasons.  Alexander was the guest of Menelaus, and if any man had seen their  friendly disposition, he would not have believed any one who said that  they were not friends. But there was cast between them (as between dogs)  a bit of meat, a handsome woman, and about her war arose. And now when  you see brothers to be friends appearing to have one mind, do not  conclude from this anything about their friendship, not even if they  swear it and say that it is impossible for them to be separated from one  another. For the ruling principle of a bad man cannot be trusted; it is  insecure, has no certain rule by which it is directed, and is  overpowered at different times by different appearances. But examine,  not what other men examine, if they are born of the same parents and  brought up together, and under the same pedagogue; but examine this  only, wherein they place their interest, whether in externals or in the  will. If in externals, do not name them friends, no more than name them  trustworthy or constant, or brave or free; do not name them even men, if  you have any judgment. For that is not a principle of human nature which  makes them bite one another, and abuse one another, and occupy deserted  places or public places, as if they were mountains, and in the courts of  justice display the acts of robbers; nor yet that which makes them  intemperate and adulterers and corrupters, nor that which makes them do  whatever else men do against one another through this one opinion only,  that of placing themselves and their interests in the things which are  not within the power of their will. But if you hear that in truth these  men think the good to be only there, where will is, and where there is a  right use of appearances, no longer trouble yourself whether they are  father or son, or brothers, or have associated a long time and are  companions, but when you have ascertained this only, confidently declare  that they are friends, as you declare that they are faithful, that they  are just. For where else is friendship than where there is fidelity, and  modesty, where there is a communion of honest things and of nothing  else.    But you may say, Such a one treated me with regard so long; and did he  not love me? How do you know, slave, if he did not regard you in the  same way as he wipes his shoes with a sponge, or as he takes care of his  beast? How do you know, when you have ceased to be useful as a vessel,  he will not throw you away like a broken platter? But this woman is my  wife, and we have lived together so long. And how long did Eriphyle live  with Amphiaraus, and was the mother of children and of many? But a  necklace came between them: and what is a necklace? It is the opinion  about such things. That was the bestial principle, that was the thing  which broke asunder the friendship between husband and wife, that which  did not allow the woman to be a wife nor the mother to be a mother. And  let every man among you who has seriously resolved either to be a friend  himself or to have another for his friend, cut out these opinions, hate  them, drive them from his soul. And thus first of all he will not  reproach himself, he will not be at variance with himself, he will not  change his mind, he will not torture himself. In the next place, to  another also, who is like himself, he will be altogether and completely  a friend. But he will bear with the man who is unlike himself, he will  be kind to him, gentle, ready to pardon on account of his ignorance, on  account of his being mistaken in things of the greatest importance; but  he will be harsh to no man, being well convinced of Plato's doctrine  that every mind is deprived of truth unwillingly. If you cannot do this,  yet you can do in all other respects as friends do, drink together, and  lodge together, and sail together, and you may be born of the same  parents, for snakes also are: but neither will they be friends, nor you,  so long as you retain these bestial and cursed opinions.           *       *       *       *       *    ON THE POWER OF SPEAKING.--Every man will read a book with more pleasure  or even with more ease, if it is written in fairer characters. Therefore  every man will also listen more readily to what is spoken, if it is  signified by appropriate and becoming words. We must not say then that  there is no faculty of expression: for this affirmation is the  characteristic of an impious and also of a timid man.

But none might say anything with surety; for, even with that  great spy-glass in the Tower of Observation, they were not overplain;  save when some light from the fires of the Land flared high, and lit  them. For they stood not up into the glare of the fires, as had the  Giants. And though I saw them with clearness, yet I knew them not; for  there was so mighty a multitude in that Vast Redoubt, that none might  ever know the half even of their rulers.    And about this time, there came a fresh matter of trouble to our minds;  for one of the Monstruwacans made report that the instruments were  recording an influence abroad in the night; so that we had knowledge  that one of the Evil Forces was Out. And to me there came an awaredness  that a strange unquiet stole over the Land; yet I knew it not with mine  ears; but my spirit heard, and it was as though trouble and an  expectation of horror did swarm about me.    And once, listening, I heard the Master-Word beating strangely low, and  I knew the aether to thrill about me, and a faint stirring was there in  my soul, as of a faint voice, speaking; and I knew that Naani called to  me some message across the night of the world; yet weak and coming  without clear meaning; so that I was tormented and could but send  comfort to her, with my brain-elements. And presently I knew that she  ceased to speak.    And, later, I heard that there was a new matter forward in the Redoubt;  for ten thousand men had assembled to attend the Room of Preparation  for the Short Preparation; and by this we knew that those poor Youths  who stumbled towards us through the dark, were presently to have help.    And through all that Sleep-Time, there went forward the Spiritual and  the Physical Preparation of the ten thousand; and upon the morrow they  slept, whilst an hundred thousand made ready their arms.    And in this space of time the two hundred and fifty Youths that went  towards the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, had come very nigh thereto;  having gone very warily and with some slowness, because, as may be, of  the lesson of the Giants.    And to us in the Pyramid, the instruments made known constantly that  Influence which was abroad, and which all those of the Tower of  Observation thought to proceed from the House of Silence. Yet, nothing  could we see with the Great Spy-Glass, and so could come to no sure  knowing; but only to fear and wonder.    And, presently, the Youths were upon the Great Road, and turned to the  Northward. And beyond them, a great way, stood the House of Silence,  upon a low hill at a certain distance to the right of the Road.    By now, they that were wounded had come to within, maybe, fifteen miles  of the Great Redoubt; and the news went through all the Cities, that the  ten thousand men that were Prepared, made to arm themselves. And I went  down by the Tower Lift, and saw them come down by thousands from the  Room of Preparation; and none might go nigh to them, or cause them to  speak; for they were made Ready, and were, as it might be, holy.    And all the millions of the Mighty Pyramid stood in their cities about  certain of the Main Lifts, and watched those thousands go downwards, all  in their armour of grey metal, and each one armed with the Diskos, which  was that same very terrible weapon, which all had training to.    And I doubt not but that the Young Men of the Pyramid looked, with  longing in their hearts, that they might have been among those that went  forth to succour. Yet, the older men had graver thoughts in their  hearts; for the blood ran more soberly in them, and they had knowledge  and memory of the Peril. And by this, I would make clear that I speak  less of the peril of the body, which is common to every state of life;  but of the peril of the spirit.    And it may be thought by those of this age, that it was most strange  that they of that, having all the knowledge of eternity to aid them, had  no weapon by which to shoot, and kill at a distance.    But, indeed, this had not been so in the past; as our Histories did  show; for some wondrous weapons there had been, that might slay without  sound or flash at a full score miles and more; and some we had whole  within the Great Museum; and of others but the parts in decay; for they  had been foolish things, and reckless to use; for we of that Great  Pyramid, wanted not to kill a few of the Monsters that lay at a great  distance; but only those which came nigh, to harm us.    And concerning those same weapons that killed silently at a great  distance, we had now little knowledge, save that they did waste the  Earth-Current; and no practice had we concerning their workings; for it  was, maybe, an hundred thousand years gone that they had been used, and  found to be of no great worth in a close attack, and harmful otherwise  to the peace, in that they angered, unneedful, the Forces of that land,  slaying wantonly those monsters which did no more than beset the Mighty  Redoubt at a great distance. For, as may be seen by a little thought, we  did very gladly keep a reasonable quietness, and refrained from aught  that should wake that Land; for we were born to the custom of that  strange life, and lived and died in peace, for the most part; and were  very content to have security, and to be neutral in all things that did  not overbear us; but, as it were, always armed, and ready.    But concerning the great and Evil Forces that were abroad in the Night  Land, these we had no power to harm; nor could we hope for more than  that we had security from them, which indeed we had; but the hugeness of  their power was about us, and we dared not to wake it; save through such  extremity as had come to pass by this folly of the Youths; though, even  now, we had no thought to attack aught; but only to succour those  wounded ones.    And concerning this simplicity of weapons, which excites somewhat even  my wonder in this our present age, it may be that the powers of  chemistry were someways quaintly limited by conditions in that age; and  there to be always a need to spare the Earth-Current; and hence, by this  cause and by that, we were brought, by the extreme, nigh to the  simplicity of the early world; yet with a strange and mighty difference,  as all may know who have read.    Now, presently, the Word was sent to every City throughout the Great  Redoubt--as was the Law--that the Great Gate should be opened; and each  city sent its Master, to form the Full Watch, as was the Law. And each  went clad in grey armour, and carrying the Diskos. And the Full Watch  numbered, two thousand; for there were also the Watchmen.    Then the lights in the Great Causeway were made dim; so that the opening  of the Gate should cast no great glare from within into the Night Land,  to tell the Watcher of the North-West, and all the Monsters, that  certain humans went out from the Mighty Pyramid. But whether the vast  and hidden Forces of Evil had knowledge, we knew not; and they who went  must but chance it, remembering that they were Prepared, and had the  Capsule.    And the ten thousand that were Prepared, went out through the Great  Gateway, into the night; and the Full Watch stood back from them, and  spoke no word, but saluted silently with the Diskos; and they that went,  raised each the Diskos a little, and passed out into the dark.    Then the Great Gate was shut; and we made to wait and to watch, with  trouble and expectation within our hearts. And at the embrasures many  did comfort the women of those men.    And I went back, upwards by miles, until I came to the Tower of  Observation; and I looked out from there into the Night Land, and saw  that the ten thousand halted at the Circle, and made arrangement of  themselves, and sent some before and upon either hand, and so went  forward into the Night Land.    And after that, I went to the Great Spy-Glass, and turned it towards the  two hundred and fifty Youths that were far off, upon the Road Where The  Silent Ones Walk; yet for awhile I could not perceive them, for all the  Road seemed empty. But afterward I saw them, and they were clambering  back into the Road, having gone aside, as I thought, because of the  passing of one of those Silent Ones, that I saw now at a distance to the  Southward of them.    There passed then, some three hours; and in that time I varied my  watching between those far-off Youths, and the Ten-thousand that went  forward to succour the wounded, that were now, maybe, scarce nine miles  distant from the Mighty Pyramid, and the Ten-thousand came very close to  them. And, in truth, in a little while, they spied one the other, and I  gathered, in spirit, something of the rejoicing of those youths; yet  weak and troubled were they, because of their wounds, and their  knowledge of failure, and their disobedience of the Law.    And, presently, they were surrounded by the Ten-thousand, and carried  upon slings; and all that body swung round towards the Pyramid, and came  back at a great pace.    And, in the same time, I heard the sound that made them so swift to  hasten; for there smote up through the night the Baying of the Hounds;  and we knew that they were discovered. And I swept the Great Spy-Glass  over the Land, towards the Valley Of The Hounds, that I might discover  them quickly; and I saw them come lumbering, at a strange gallop, and  great as horses, and it might be only ten miles to the East.    And I looked once upon the Watcher of the North-East, and I saw and  marvelled that the great bell-ear quivered constantly; and I knew that  it had knowledge, and gave signal to all the Land. Then did one of the  Monstruwacans report that a new and terrible Influence was abroad in the  Land; and by the instrument, we had knowledge that it approached; and  some of the Monstruwacans"]]]
