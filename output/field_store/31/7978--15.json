GROWTH OF APPRECIATION    \"In traveling over the country, I have found such wonderful musical  growth, and it seems to increase each year. Even in little places the  people show such appreciation for what is good. And I only give them  good music--the best songs, both classical and modern. Nothing but the  best would interest me. In my recent trip, down in Mexico and Oklahoma,  there are everywhere large halls, and people come from all the country  round to attend a concert. Men who look as though they had driven a  grocery wagon, or like occupation, sit and listen so attentively and  with such evident enjoyment. I am sure the circulation of the phonograph  records has much to do with America's present wonderful advancement in  musical understanding.\"    Just here a large cat slipped through the doorway; such a beautiful  creature, with long gray and white fur and big blue eyes.    \"It is a real chinchilla, of high degree,\" said Miss Case, caressing her  pet. \"I call her Fochette. I am so fond of all animals, especially dogs  and cats.\"    \"You must know the country well, having been over it so much.\"    \"Yes, but oh, the long distances! It often takes so many hours to go  from one place to another. I think there is a reason why foreign singers  are apt to be rather stout; they are not worn out by traveling great  distances, as cities are so much nearer together than over here!\" And  Miss Case smiled in amusement. \"But, in spite of all discomforts of  transportation and so on, the joy of bringing a message to a waiting  audience is worth all it costs. I often think, if one could just fly to  Chicago or Philadelphia, for instance, sing one's program and return  just as quickly, without all these hours of surface travel, how  delightful it would be! I had a wonderful experience in an airplane last  summer. Flying has the most salutary effect on the voice. After sailing  through the air for awhile, you feel as though you could sing anything  and everything, the exhilaration is so great. One takes in such a  quantity of pure air that the lungs feel perfectly clear and free. One  can learn a lesson about breathing from such an experience.\"    Before parting a final question was asked:    \"What, in your opinion, are the vital requisites necessary to become a  singer?\"    Almost instantly came the reply:    \"Brains, Personality, Voice.\"    With this cryptic answer we took leave of the fair artist.          XIII    =FLORENCE EASTON=    PROBLEMS CONFRONTING THE YOUNG SINGER      English by birth, American by marriage, beloved in every country where  her art is known, Florence Easton, after ten years of activity in the  music centers of Europe, is now making her home in America. Mme. Easton  is a singer whose attitude towards music is one of deepest sincerity. No  one could witness her beautiful, sympathetic investiture of the Saint  Elizabeth, of Liszt, or some of her other important roles, without being  impressed with this complete, earnest sincerity. It shines out of her  earnest eyes and frank smile, as she greets the visitor; it vibrates in  the tones of her voice as she speaks. What can even a whole hour's talk  reveal of the deep undercurrents of an artist's thought? Yet in sixty  minutes many helpful things may be said, and Mme. Easton, always serious  in every artistic thing she undertakes, will wish the educational side  of our talk to be uppermost.      THE YOUNG SINGER    \"I have a deep sympathy for the American girl who honestly wishes to  cultivate her voice. Of course, in the first place, she must have a  voice to start with; there is no use trying to train something which  doesn't exist. Given the voice and a love for music, it is still  difficult to tell another how to begin. Each singer who has risen, who  has found herself, knows by what path she climbed, but the path she  found might not do for another.    \"There are quantities of girls in America with good voices, good looks  and a love for music. And there are plenty of good vocal teachers, too,  not only in New York, but in other large cities of this great country.  There is always the problem, however, of securing just the right kind of  a teacher. For a teacher may be excellent for one voice but not for  another.      THE STUDIO VERSUS THE CONCERT ROOM    [Illustration: FLORENCE EASTON]    \"The American girl, trained in the studio, has little idea of what it  means to sing in a large hall or opera house. In the small room her  voice sounds very pretty, and she can make a number of nice effects; she  may also have a delicate pianissimo. These things are mostly lost when  she tries them in a large space. It is like beginning all over again.  She has never been taught any other way but the studio way. If young  singers could only have a chance to try their wings frequently in large  halls, it would be of the greatest benefit. If they could sing to a  public who only paid a nominal sum and did not expect great things; a  public who would come for the sake of the music they were to hear,  because they wanted the enjoyment and refreshment of it, not for the  sake of some singers with big names, they would judge the young aspirant  impersonally, which would be one of the best things for her.      VALUE OF HONEST CRITICISM    \"Frequently the trouble with the young singer is that her friends too  often tell her how wonderful she is. This is a hindrance instead of a  help. She should always have some one who will criticize her honestly.  The singer cannot really hear herself, that is, not until she is well  advanced in her work. Therefore she should always have the guidance of a  teacher. I never think of giving a program without going through it for  criticism. The office of critic is a very difficult one, especially if  you are to criticize some one you are fond of. Mr. Maclennan and I try  to do it for each other. I assure you it is no easy task to sing a  program knowing some one is listening who will not spare you, and will  tell you all your faults. I know this is all very salutary, but it is  human nature to wish to hear one's good points rather than the poor  ones. I sometimes say: 'Do tell me the good things I did.' But he says  he does not need to speak of those; I only need to know my faults in  order that they may be corrected.    \"It is so easy to overdo a little, one way or the other. For instance,  you make a certain effect,--it goes well. You think you will make it a  little more pronounced next time. And so it goes on, until before you  know it you have acquired a definite habit, which the critics will call  a mannerism and advise you to get rid of. So the artist has to be  constantly on the watch, to guard against these incipient faults.\"      BREATHING EXERCISES    Asked what kind of breathing exercises she used, Mme. Easton continued:  \"No doubt each one has her own exercises for the practice and teaching  of breath control. For myself, I stand at the open window, for one  should always breathe pure air, and I inhale and exhale slowly, a  number of times, till I feel my lungs are thoroughly clear and filled  with fresh air. Then I frequently sing tones directly after these long  inhalations. A one-octave scale, sung slowly in one breath, or at most  in two, is an excellent exercise. You remember Lilli Lehmann's talks  about the 'long scale'? But the way in which she uses it perhaps no one  but a Lehmann could imitate. What a wonderful woman she was--and is! She  has such a remarkable physique, and can endure any amount of effort and  fatigue. Every singer who hopes to make a success in any branch of the  musical profession, should look after the physical side, and see that it  is cared for and developed.      \"STUDY THE PIANO!\"    \"If a girl is fond of music, let her first of all study the piano, for a  knowledge of the piano and its music is really at the bottom of  everything. If I have a word of advice to mothers, it should be: 'Let  your child study the piano.' All children should have this opportunity,  whether they greatly desire it or not. The child who early begins to  study the piano, will often--almost unconsciously--follow the melody  she plays with her voice. Thus the love of song is awakened in her, and  a little later it is discovered she has a voice that is worth  cultivating. How many of our great singers began their musical studies  first at the piano.    \"On the other hand, the girl with a voice, who has never worked at the  piano, is greatly handicapped from the start, when she begins her vocal  studies. As she knows nothing of the piano, everything has to be played  for her,--she can never be independent of the accompanist; she loses  half the pleasure of knowing and doing things herself.\"      FULL OR HALF VOICE    Asked if she used full or half voice for practice, Mme. Easton replied:    \"I do not, as a rule, use full voice when at work. But this admission,  if followed, might prove injurious to the young singer. In the earlier  stages of study, one should use full voice, for half voice might result  in very faulty tone production. The advanced singer, who has passed the  experimental stage can do many things the novice may not attempt, and  this is one of them.      IN REGARD TO MEMORIZING    \"Here again my particular method of work can hardly be of value to  others, as I memorize with great rapidity. It is no effort for me; I  seem to be able to visualize the whole part. Music has always been very  easy to remember and with sufficient concentration I can soon make the  words my own. I always concentrate deeply on what I am doing. Lately I  was asked to prepare a leading role in one of the season's new operas,  to replace a singer at short notice, should this be necessary. I did so  and accomplished the task in four days. Mr. Caruso laughingly remarked I  must have a camera in my head. I know my own parts, both voice and  accompaniment. In learning a song, I commit both voice and words at the  same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15464"],[0,"Foods That Will Win the War and How to Cook Them (1918) (#15)"],[1,"     *       *       *    Use all bits of bread, that cannot be used as toast, in puddings,  croquettes, scalloped dishes or to thicken soup.           *       *       *       *       *    Don't throw away cold muffins and fancy breads. Split and toast them  for next day's breakfast.           *       *       *       *       *    Foods that survive the earlier forms of waste are often lost at table  by the serving of portions of like size to all members of the family.  The individual food requirements differ according to age, sex,  vocation and state of health. Each should be considered before the  food is served, then there will be no waste on the plates when the  meal is over. The following table, showing the daily requirement of  calories for men and women in various lines of work, illustrates this  point:      WOMEN               CALORIES    Sedentary work    ... 2,400    Active work       ... 2,700    Hard manual labor ... 3,200      MEN               CALORIES    Sedentary work    ... 2,700    Active work       ... 3,450    Hard manual labor ... 4,150    Although the serving of food should be carefully planned so as to  prevent waste, care should be taken that growing children have ample  food. It is a mistake to suppose that a growing child can be nourished  on less than a sedentary adult. A boy of fourteen who wants to eat  more than his father probably needs all that he asks for. We must not  save on the children; but it will be well to give them plain food for  the most part, which will not tempt them to overeat, and tactfully  combat pernickety, overfastidious likes and dislikes.    The United States Food Administration is preaching the gospel of the  clean plate, and this can be accomplished by serving smaller portions,  insisting that all food accepted be eaten; by keeping down bread  waste, cutting the bread at the table a slice at a time as needed; by  cooking only sufficient to supply moderately the number to be fed, and  no more. It is a false idea of good providing that platters must leave  the table with a generous left-over. Waste of cooked food is a serious  item in household economy, and no matter how skillfully leftovers are  utilized, it is always less expensive and more appetizing to provide  fresh-cooked foods at each meal.    One would think that with the various uses to which all kinds of  foodstuffs may be put that there would be little left for the yawning  garbage pail. But the Secretary of the United States Department of  Agriculture is responsible for the statement that $750,000,000 worth  of food has been wasted annually in the American kitchen. Undoubtedly  a large part of this wastefulness was due to ignorance on the part of  the housewife, and the rest of it to the lack of co-operation on  the part of the employees who have handled the food but not paid the  bills.    According to a well-known domestic scientist, the only things which  should find their way to the garbage pail are:      Egg shells--after being used to clear coffee.    Potato skins--after having been cooked on the potato.    Banana skins--if there are no tan shoes to be cleaned.    Bones--after having been boiled in soup kettle.    Coffee grounds--if there is no garden where they can be used for            fertilizer, or if they are not desired as filling for            pincushions.    Tea leaves--after every tea-serving, if they are not needed for            brightening carpets or rugs when swept.    Asparagus ends--after being cooked and drained for soup.    Spinach, etc.--decayed leaves and dirty ends of roots.    If more than this is now thrown away, you are wasting the family  income and not fulfilling your part in the great world struggle. Your  government says that it is your business to know what food your family  needs to be efficient; that you must learn how to make the most of  the foods you buy; that it is your duty to learn the nature and uses  of various foods and to get the greatest possible nourishment out of  every pound of food that comes to your home.    The art of utilizing left-overs is an important factor in this  prevention of waste. The thrifty have always known it. The careless  have always ignored it. But now as a measure of home economy as well  as a patriotic service, the left-over must be handled intelligently.    The following recipes show how to make appetizing dishes from products  that heretofore in many homes have found their way to the extravagant  pail.    In these recipes, sauces are prominent because they are of great  value in making foods of neutral flavor, especially the starchy winter  vegetables, and rice, macaroni and hominy, as attractive as they are  nutritious; salads are included, since these serve to combine odds  and ends of meats and vegetables; gelatine dishes are provided because  gelatine serves as a binder for all kinds of leftovers and is an  extremely practical way of making the most rigid saving acceptable;  desserts made of crumbs of bread and cake, or left-over cereals, are  among the major economies if they are worked out in such a way that  they do not involve the extravagant use of other foodstuffs. All the  recipes in this economy cook-book have been thoughtfully adapted to  the conditions of the time, and will show the practical housekeeper  how to supply wholesome, flavorsome food for the least cost.           *       *       *       *       *    SAUCES MAKE LEFTOVERS ATTRACTIVE      WHITE SAUCE      1/4 cup flour    1/4 cup fat    1 teaspoon salt    1/8 teaspoon cayenne    1-1/2 cups milk    Melt fat.
