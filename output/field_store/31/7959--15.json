To get into  consciousness, any idea from the subconscious must be able to pass  this censor. This force seems to be a combination of the  self-regarding and herd-instincts, which dispute with the instinct for  reproduction the right to \"the common path\" for expression.    A considerable part of any person's subconscious is made up of  memories, wishes, impulses, which are repressed in this way. Of course  any instinctive desire may be repressed, but it is easy to understand  why the most frequently denied impulse, the instinct of reproduction,  against whose urgency society has cultivated so strong a feeling,  should be repressed more frequently than any other.[23]    [Footnote 23: See foot-note, p. 145, Chap. VII.]    =Past and Present.= It matters not, then, in what state experiences  come to us, whether in sleep or delirium, intoxication or hypnosis, or  in the normal waking condition. They are conserved and may exert great  influence on our normal lives. It matters not whether the experiences  be full of meaning and emotion or whether they be so slight as to pass  unnoticed, they are conserved. It matters not whether these  experiences be mere sense-impressions, or inner thoughts, whether they  be unacknowledged hopes or fears, undesirable moods and unworthy  desires or fine aspirations and lofty ideals. They are conserved and  they may at a later day rise up to bless or to curse us long after we  had thought them buried in the past. The present is the product of the  past. It is the past plus an element of choice which keeps us from  settling down in the despair of fatalism and enables us to do  something toward making the present that is, a help and not a  stumbling-block to the present that is to be.      SOME HABITS OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS    =The Association of Ideas.= It is only by something akin to poetic  license that we can speak of lower and higher strata of mind. When we  carry over the language of material things into the less easily  pictured psychic realm, it is sometimes well to remind ourselves that  figures of speech, if taken too literally, are more misleading than  illuminating. When we speak of the deep-laid instinctive lower levels  of mind and the higher acquired levels, we must not imagine that these  strata are really laid in neat, mutually exclusive layers, one on top  of the other in the chambers of the mind. Nor must we imagine the  mental elements of instinct, idea, and memory as jumbled together in  chaotic confusion, or in scattered isolated units. As a matter of  fact, the best word to picture the inside of our minds is the word  \"group.\" We do not know just how ideas and instincts can group  themselves together, but we do know that by some arrangement of brain  paths and nerve-connections, the laws of association of ideas and of  habit take our mental experiences and organize them into more or less  permanent systems. Instinctive emotions tend to organize themselves  around ideas to form sentiments; ideas or sentiments, which through  repetition or emotion are associated together, tend to stay together  in groups or complexes which act as a whole; complexes which pertain  to the same interests tend to bind themselves into larger systems or  constellations, forming moods, or sides to one's character. It is not  highly important to differentiate in every case a sentiment from a  complex, or a complex from a constellation, especially as many writers  use \"complex\" as the generic term for all sorts of groups; but a  general understanding of the much-used word \"complex\" is necessary  for a comprehension of modern literature on psychology, psychotherapy  or general education.    \"=What Is a Complex=?\" Reduced to its lowest terms, a complex is a  group. It may be simply a group of associated movements, like lacing  one's shoes or knitting; it may be a group of movements and ideas,  like typewriting or piano-playing, which through repetition have  become automatic or subconscious; it may be merely a group of ideas,  such as the days of the week, the alphabet or the multiplication  table. In all these types it is repetition working through the law of  habit that ties the ideas and movements together into an organic  whole. Usually, however, the word complex is reserved for psychic  elements that are bound together by emotion. In this sense, a complex  is an emotional thought-habit. Frink's definition, which is one of the  simplest, recognizes only this emotional type: \"A complex is a system  of connected ideas, having a strong emotional tone, and displaying a  tendency to produce or influence conscious thought and action in a  definite and predetermined direction.\"[24]    [Footnote 24: Frink: \"What Is a Complex?\" _Journal American Medical  Assoc_., Vol. LXII, No. 12, Mar. 21, 1914.]    Emotion and repetition are the great welders of complexes. Emotion is  the strongest cement in the world. A single emotional experience  suffices to bind together ideas that were originally as far apart as  the poles.    Sometimes a complex includes not only ideas, movements, and emotions,  but physiological disturbances and sensations. Some people cannot go  aboard a stationary ship without vomiting, nor see a rose, even though  it prove to be a wax one, without the sneezing and watery eyes of  hay-fever. This is what is known as a \"conditioned reflex.\" Past  associations plus fear have so welded together idea and bodily  manifestation that one follows the other as a matter of course, long  after the real cause is removed. In such ways innumerable nervous  symptoms arise. The same laws which form healthy complexes, and,  indeed, which make all education possible, may thus be responsible for  the unhealthy mal-adaptive association-habits which lie back of a  neurosis. Fortunately, a knowledge of this fact furnishes the clue to  the re-education that brings recovery.    A complex may be either conscious or unconscious, but as it usually  happens that either all or part of its elements are below the surface,  the word is oftenest used to mean those buried systems of the  subconscious mind that influence thought or behavior without  themselves being open to scrutiny. It is these buried complexes,  memory groups, gathered through the years of experience, that  determine action in uniform and easily prophesied directions. Every  individual has a definite complex about religion, about politics,  about patriotism, about business, and it is the sum of these buried  complexes which makes up his total personality.    =Displacement.= Association or grouping is, then, an intrinsic power  of mind; but as all life seems to be built on opposites--light and  darkness, heat and cold, love and hate--so mind, which is capable of  association, is capable also of displacement or the splitting apart of  elements which belong together. There is such a thing as the simple  breaking up of complexes, when education or experience or neglect  separate ideas and emotions which had been previously welded together;  but displacement is another matter. Here there is still a path between  idea and emotion; they still belong to the same complex, but the  connection is lost sight of. The impulse or emotion attaches itself to  another substitute idea which is related to the first but which is  more acceptable to the personality. Sometimes the original idea is  forgotten; repressed, or dissociated into the subconscious, as in  anxiety neurosis; and sometimes it is merely shorn of its emotional  interest and remembered as an unrelated or insignificant idea, as in  compulsion neurosis.    =Transference.= Another kind of displacement which seems hard to  believe possible until it is repeatedly encountered in intelligent  human beings is the process called transference, by which everybody at  some time or other acts toward the people he meets, not according to  rational standards but according to old unconscious attitudes toward  other people. Each of us carries, within, subconscious pictures of the  people who surrounded us when we were children; and now when we meet a  new person we are likely unconsciously to say to ourselves--not, \"This  person has eyebrows like my mother, or a voice like my nurse,\" or,  \"This person bosses me around as my father used to do,\" but, \"This is  my mother, this is my nurse, this is my father.\" Whereupon we may  proceed to act toward that person very much as we did toward the  original person in childhood.    Transference is subconsciously identifying one person with another and  behaving toward the one as if he were that other. Analysis has  discovered that many a man's hostile attitude toward the state or  religion or authority in general, is nothing more than this kind of  displacement of his childhood's attitude toward authority in the  person of his perhaps too-domineering father. Many a woman has married  a husband, not for what he was in himself, but because she  unconsciously identified him with her childish image of her father.    Students of human nature have always recognized the kind of  displacement which transfers the sense of guilt from some major act or  attitude to a minor one which is more easily faced, just as _Lady  Macbeth_ felt that by washing her hands she might free herself from  her deeper stain. This is a frequent mechanism in the  psychoneuroses--not that neurotics are likely to have committed any  great crime, but that they feel subconsciously that some of their  wishes or thoughts are wicked.    =The Phenomena of Dissociation.= When an idea or a complex, a  perception or a memory is either temporarily or permanently shoved out  of consciousness into the subconscious, it is said to be dissociated.  When we are asleep, the part of us that is usually conscious is  dissociated and the submerged part takes the stage. When we forget our  surroundings in concentration or absent-mindedness, a part of us is  dissociated and our friends say that we are \"not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#15)"],[1,"    A wither'd carcass that implores thy aid;      Let all behold: and thou, imperious Jove,      On me direct thy lightning from above:      Now all its force the poison doth assume,      And my burnt entrails with its flame consume.      Crestfallen, unembraced, I now let fall      Listless, those hands that lately conquer'd all;      When the Nemaean lion own'd their force,      And he indignant fell a breathless corse;      The serpent slew, of the Lernean lake,      As did the Hydra of its force partake:      By this, too, fell the Erymanthian boar:      E'en Cerberus did his weak strength deplore.      This sinewy arm did overcome with ease      That dragon, guardian of the Golden Fleece.      My many conquests let some others trace;      It's mine to say, I never knew disgrace.[31]    Can we then, despise pain, when we see Hercules himself giving vent to  his expressions of agony with such impatience?    X. Let us see what AEschylus says, who was not only a poet but a  Pythagorean philosopher also, for that is the account which you have  received of him; how doth he make Prometheus bear the pain he suffered  for the Lemnian theft, when he clandestinely stole away the celestial  fire, and bestowed it on men, and was severely punished by Jupiter for  the theft. Fastened to Mount Caucasus, he speaks thus:        Thou heav'n-born race of Titans here fast bound,      Behold thy brother! As the sailors sound      With care the bottom, and their ships confine      To some safe shore, with anchor and with line;      So, by Jove's dread decree, the God of fire      Confines me here the victim of Jove's ire.      With baneful art his dire machine he shapes;      From such a God what mortal e'er escapes?      When each third day shall triumph o'er the night,      Then doth the vulture, with his talons light,      Seize on my entrails; which, in rav'nous guise,      He preys on! then with wing extended flies      Aloft, and brushes with his plumes the gore:      But when dire Jove my liver doth restore,      Back he returns impetuous to his prey,      Clapping his wings, he cuts th' ethereal way.      Thus do I nourish with my blood this pest,      Confined my arms, unable to contest;      Entreating only that in pity Jove      Would take my life, and this cursed plague remove.      But endless ages past unheard my moan,      Sooner shall drops dissolve this very stone.[32]    And therefore it scarcely seems possible to avoid calling a man who is  suffering, miserable; and if he is miserable, then pain is an evil.    XI. _A._ Hitherto you are on my side; I will see to that by-and-by;  and, in the mean while, whence are those verses? I do not remember  them.    _M._ I will inform you, for you are in the right to ask. Do you see  that I have much leisure?    _A._ What, then?    _M._ I imagine, when you were at Athens, you attended frequently at the  schools of the philosophers.    _A._ Yes, and with great pleasure.    _M._ You observed, then, that though none of them at that time were  very eloquent, yet they used to mix verses with their harangues.    _A._ Yes, and particularly Dionysius the Stoic used to employ a great  many.    _M._ You say right; but they were quoted without any appropriateness or  elegance. But our friend Philo used to give a few select lines and well  adapted; and in imitation of him, ever since I took a fancy to this  kind of elderly declamation, I have been very fond of quoting our  poets; and where I cannot be supplied from them, I translate from the  Greek, that the Latin language may not want any kind of ornament in  this kind of disputation.    But, do you not see how much harm is done by poets? They introduce the  bravest men lamenting over their misfortunes: they soften our minds;  and they are, besides, so entertaining, that we do not only read them,  but get them by heart. Thus the influence of the poets is added to our  want of discipline at home, and our tender and delicate manner of  living, so that between them they have deprived virtue of all its vigor  and energy. Plato, therefore, was right in banishing them from his  commonwealth, where he required the best morals, and the best form of  government. But we, who have all our learning from Greece, read and  learn these works of theirs from our childhood; and look on this as a  liberal and learned education.    XII. But why are we angry with the poets? We may find some  philosophers, those masters of virtue, who have taught that pain was  the greatest of evils. But you, young man, when you said but just now  that it appeared so to you, upon being asked by me what appeared  greater than infamy, gave up that opinion at a word. Suppose I ask  Epicurus the same question. He will answer that a trifling degree of  pain is a greater evil than the greatest infamy; for that there is no  evil in infamy itself, unless attended with pain. What pain, then,  attends Epicurus, when he says that very thing, that pain is the  greatest evil! And yet nothing can be a greater disgrace to a  philosopher than to talk thus. Therefore, you allowed enough when you  admitted that infamy appeared to you to be a greater evil than pain.  And if you abide by this admission, you will see how far pain should be  resisted; and that our inquiry should be not so much whether pain be an  evil, as how the mind may be fortified for resisting it. The Stoics  infer from some petty quibbling arguments that it is no evil, as if the  dispute were about a word, and not about the thing itself. Why do you  impose upon me, Zeno? For when you deny what appears very dreadful to  me to be an evil, I am deceived, and am at a loss to know why that  which appears to me to be a most miserable thing should be no evil. The  answer is, that nothing is an evil but what is base and vicious. You  return to your trifling, for you do not remove what made me uneasy. I  know that pain is not vice--you need not inform me of that: but show me  that it makes no difference to me whether I am in pain or not. It has  never anything to do, say you, with a happy life, for that depends upon  virtue alone; but yet pain is to be avoided. If I ask, why? It is  disagreeable, against nature, hard to bear, woful and afflicting.    XIII. Here are many words to express that by so many different forms  which we call by the single word evil. You are defining pain, instead  of removing it, when you say, it is disagreeable, unnatural, scarcely  possible to be endured or borne, nor are you wrong in saying so: but  the man who vaunts himself in such a manner should not give way in his  conduct, if it be true that nothing is good but what is honest, and  nothing evil but what is disgraceful. This would be wishing, not  proving. This argument is a better one, and has more truth in it--that  all things which Nature abhors are to be looked upon as evil; that  those which she approves of are to be considered as good: for when this  is admitted, and the dispute about words removed, that which they with  reason embrace, and which we call honest, right, becoming, and  sometimes include under the general name of virtue, appears so far  superior to everything else that all other things which are looked upon  as the gifts of fortune, or the good things of the body, seem trifling  and insignificant; and no evil whatever, nor all the collective body of  evils together, appears to be compared to the evil of infamy.  Wherefore, if, as you granted in the beginning, infamy is worse than  pain, pain is certainly nothing; for while it appears to you base and  unmanly to groan, cry out, lament, or faint under pain; while you  cherish notions of probity, dignity, honor, and, keeping your eye on  them, refrain yourself, pain will certainly yield to virtue, and, by  the influence of imagination, will lose its whole force.--For you must  either admit that there is no such thing as virtue, or you must despise  every kind of pain. Will you allow of such a virtue as prudence,  without which no virtue whatever can even be conceived? What, then?  Will that suffer you to labor and take pains to no purpose? Will  temperance permit you to do anything to excess? Will it be possible for  justice to be maintained by one who through the force of pain discovers  secrets, or betrays his confederates, or deserts many duties of life?  Will you act in a manner consistently with courage, and its attendants,  greatness of soul, resolution, patience, and contempt for all worldly  things? Can you hear yourself called a great man when you lie  grovelling, dejected, and deploring your condition with a lamentable  voice; no one would call you even a man while in such a condition. You  must therefore either abandon all pretensions to courage, or else pain  must be put out of the question.    XIV. You know very well that, even though part of your Corinthian  furniture were gone, the remainder might be safe without that; but if  you lose one virtue (though virtue in reality cannot be lost), still  if, I say, you should acknowledge that you were deficient in one, you  would be stripped of all. Can you, then, call yourself a brave man, of  a great soul, endued with patience and steadiness above the frowns of  fortune? or Philoctetes? for I choose to instance him, rather than  yourself, for he certainly was not a brave man, who lay in his bed,  which was watered with his tears,        Whose groans, bewailings, and whose bitter cries,      With grief incessant rent the very skies.    I do not deny pain to be pain--for were that the case, in what would  courage consist?--but I say it should be assuaged by patience, if there  be such a thing as patience: if there be no such thing, why do we speak  so in praise of philosophy? or why do we glory in its name? Does pain  annoy us? Let it sting us to the heart: if you are without defensive  armor, bare your throat to it; but if you are secured by Vulcanian  armor, that is to say by resolution, resist it. Should you fail to"]]]
