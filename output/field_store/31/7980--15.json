The world is held stable by the man who waits for the next day  to find out whether the report was true or not.    We cannot afford, therefore, to let the rumors of irresponsible persons  and origins get into the atmosphere of the United States. We are  trustees for what I venture to say is the greatest heritage that any  nation ever had, the love of justice and righteousness and human  liberty. For fundamentally those are the things to which America is  addicted and to which she is devoted.    There are groups of selfish men in the United States, there are coteries  where sinister things are purposed, but the great heart of the American  people is just as sound and true as it ever was. And it is a single  heart; it is the heart of America. It is not a heart made up of sections  selected out of other countries.    So that what I try to remind myself of every day when I am almost  overcome by perplexities, what I try to remember, is what the people at  home are thinking about. I try to put myself in the place of the man who  does not know all the things that I know and ask myself what he would  like the policy of this country to be. Not the talkative man, not the  partisan man, not the man that remembers first that he is a Republican  or Democrat, or that his parents were Germans or English, but who  remembers first that the whole destiny of modern affairs centres largely  upon his being an American first of all.    If I permitted myself to be a partisan in this present struggle I would  be unworthy to represent you. If I permitted myself to forget the  people who are not partisans I would be unworthy to represent you. I am  not saying that I am worthy to represent you, but I do claim this degree  of worthiness--that before everything else I love America.

King of Montenegro, the Smallest of the Allied Powers    _(Photo (C) American Press Assn.)_]      II.    \"HUMANITY FIRST.\"    [_President Wilson's speech in Convention Hall, Philadelphia, Penn., May  10, 1915, before 4,000 newly naturalized citizens:_]    It warms my heart that you should give me such a reception, but it is  not of myself that I wish to think tonight, but of those who have just  become citizens of the United States. This is the only country in the  world which experiences this constant and repeated rebirth. Other  countries depend upon the multiplication of their own native people.  This country is constantly drinking strength out of new sources by the  voluntary association with it of great bodies of strong men and  forward-looking women. And so by the gift of the free will of  independent people it is constantly being renewed from generation to  generation by the same process by which it was originally created. It is  as if humanity had determined to see to it that this great nation,  founded for the benefit of humanity, should not lack for the allegiance  of the people of the world.    You have just taken an oath of allegiance to the United States. Of  allegiance to whom? Of allegiance to no one, unless it be God. Certainly  not of allegiance to those who temporarily represent this great  Government. You have taken an oath of allegiance to a great ideal, to a  great body of principles, to a great hope of the human race. You have  said, \"We are going to America,\" not only to earn a living, not only to  seek the things which it was more difficult to obtain where you were  born, but to help forward the great enterprises of the human spirit--to  let men know that everywhere in the world there are men who will cross  strange oceans and go where a speech is spoken which is alien to them,  knowing that, whatever the speech, there is but one longing and  utterance of the human heart, and that is for liberty and justice.    And while you bring all countries with you, you come with a purpose of  leaving all other countries behind you--bringing what is best of their  spirit, but not looking over your shoulders and seeking to perpetuate  what you intended to leave in them. I certainly would not be one even to  suggest that a man cease to love the home of his birth and the nation of  his origin--these things are very sacred and ought not to be put out of  our hearts--but it is one thing to love the place where you were born  and it is another thing to dedicate yourself to the place to which you  go. You cannot dedicate yourself to America unless you become in every  respect and with every purpose of your will thorough Americans. You  cannot become thorough Americans if you think of yourselves in groups.  American does not consist of groups. A man who thinks himself as  belonging to a particular national group in America has not yet become  an American, and the man who goes among you to trade upon your  nationality is no worthy son to live under the Stars and Stripes.    My urgent advice to you would be not only always to think first of  America, but always, also, to think first of humanity. You do not love  humanity if you seek to divide humanity into jealous camps. Humanity can  be welded together only by love, by sympathy, by justice, not by  jealousy and hatred. I am sorry for the man who seeks to make personal  capital out of the passions of his fellow-men. He has lost the touch and  ideal of America, for America was created to unite mankind by those  passions which lift and not by the passions which separate and debase.    We came to America, either ourselves or in persons of our ancestors, to  better the ideals of men, to make them see finer things than they had  seen before, to get rid of things that divide, and to make sure of the  things that unite. It was but a historical accident no doubt that this  great country was called the \"United States,\" and yet I am very  thankful that it has the word \"united\" in its title; and the man who  seeks to divide man from man, group from group, interest from interest,  in the United States is striking at its very heart.    It is a very interesting circumstance to me, in thinking of those of you  who have just sworn allegiance to this great Government, that you were  drawn across the ocean by some beckoning finger of hope, by some belief,  by some vision of a new kind of justice, by some expectation of a better  kind of life.    No doubt you have been disappointed in some of us; some of us are very  disappointing. No doubt you have found that justice in the United States  goes only with a pure heart and a right purpose as it does everywhere  else in the world. No doubt what you found here didn't seem touched for  you, after all, with the complete beauty of the ideal which you had  conceived beforehand.    But remember this, if we had grown at all poor in the ideal, you brought  some of it with you. A man does not go out to seek the thing that is not  in him. A man does not hope for the thing that he does not believe in,  and if some of us have forgotten what America believed in, you, at any  rate, imported in your own hearts a renewal of the belief. That is the  reason that I, for one, make you welcome.    If I have in any degree forgotten what America was intended for, I will  thank God if you will remind me.    I was born in America. You dreamed dreams of what America was to be, and  I hope you brought the dreams with you. No man that does not see visions  will ever realize any high hope or undertake any high enterprise.    Just because you brought dreams with you, America is more likely to  realize the dreams such as you brought. You are enriching us if you came  expecting us to be better than we are.    See, my friends, what that means. It means that Americans must have a  consciousness different from the consciousness of every other nation in  the world. I am not saying this with even the slightest thought of  criticism of other nations. You know how it is with a family. A family  gets centred on itself if it is not careful and is less interested in  the neighbors than it is in its own members.    So a nation that is not constantly renewed out of new sources is apt to  have the narrowness and prejudice of a family. Whereas, America must  have this consciousness, that on all sides it touches elbows and touches  hearts with all the nations of mankind.    The example of America must be a special example. The example of America  must be the example not merely of peace because it will not fight, but  of peace because peace is the healing and elevating influence of the  world and strife is not.    There is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight. There is such a  thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince  others by force that it is right.    So, if you come into this great nation as you have come, voluntarily  seeking something that we have to give, all that we have to give is  this: We cannot exempt you from work. No man is exempt from work  anywhere in the world. I sometimes think he is fortunate if he has to  work only with his hands and not with his head. It is very easy to do  what other people give you to do, but it is very difficult to give other  people things to do. We cannot exempt you from work; we cannot exempt  you from the strife and the heart-breaking burden of the struggle of the  day--that is common to mankind everywhere. We cannot exempt you from the  loads that you must carry; we can only make them light by the spirit in  which they are carried. That is the spirit of hope, it is the spirit of  liberty, it is the spirit of justice.    When I was asked, therefore, by the Mayor and the committee that  accompanied him to come up from Washington to meet this great company of  newly admitted citizens I could not decline the invitation. I ought not  to be away from Washington, and yet I feel that it has renewed my spirit  as an American.    In Washington men tell you so many things every day that are not so,  and I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15483"],[0,"Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official (#15)"],[1,"in  reality stars which the guardian angels of men snatch from the  spheres, and throw at the devil as they see him passing through the  air, or hiding himself under one or other of the constellations. Is  it not so?'    'Yes, it is; but we have the authority of the holy prophet for this,  as delivered down to us by his companions in the sacred traditions,  and we are bound to believe it. When our holy prophet came upon the  earth, he found it to be infested with a host of magicians, who, by  their abominable rites and incantations, get into their interest  certain devils, or demons, whom they used to send up to heaven to  listen to the orders which the angels received from God regarding men  and the world below. On hearing these orders, they came off and  reported them to the magicians, who were thereby enabled to foretell  the events which the angels were ordered to bring about. In this  manner they often overheard the orders which the angel Gabriel  received from God, and communicated them to the magicians as soon as  he could deliver them to our holy prophet. Exulting in the knowledge  obtained in this diabolical manner, these wretches tried to turn his  prophecies into ridicule; and, seeing the evil effects of such  practices among men, he prayed God to put a stop to them. From that  time guardian angels have been stationed in different parts of the  heavens, to keep off the devils; and as soon as one of them sees a  devil sneaking too near the heaven of heavens, he snatches the  nearest star, and flings it at him.'[7] This, he added, was what all  true Muhammadans believed regarding the shooting of stars. He had  read nothing about them in the works of Plato, Aristotle,  Hippocrates, or Galen, all of which he had carefully studied, and  should be glad to learn from me what modern philosophers in Europe  thought about them.    I explained to him the supposed distance and bulk of the fixed stars  visible to the naked eye; their being radiant with unborrowed light,  and probably every one of them, like our own sun, the great centre of  a solar system of its own; embracing the vast orbits of numerous  planets, revolving around it with their attendant satellites; the  stars visible to the naked eye being but a very small portion of the  whole which the telescope had now made distinctly visible to us; and  those distinctly visible being one cluster among many thousand with  which the genius of Galileo, Newton, the Herschells, and many other  modern philosophers had discovered the heavens to be studded. I  remarked that the notion that these mighty suns, the centres of  planetary systems, should be made merely to be thrown at devils and  demons, appeared to us just as unaccountable as those of the Hindoos  regarding Indra's arrows.    'But', said he, 'these foolish Hindoos believe still greater  absurdities. They believe that the rainbow is nothing but the fume of  a large snake, concealed under the ground; that he vomits forth this  fume from a hole in the surface of the earth, without being himself  seen; and, when you ask them why, in that case, the rainbow should be  in the west while the sun is in the east, and in the east while the  sun is in the west, they know not what to say.'[8]    'The truth is, my friend Maulavi Sahib, the Hindoos, like a very  great part of every other nation, are very much disposed to attribute  to supernatural influences effects that the wiser portion of our  species know to rise from natural causes.'    The Maulavi was right. In the _Mishkat-ul-Masabih_,[9] the authentic  traditions of their prophet,[10] it is stated that Ayesha, the widow  of Muhammad, said, 'I heard His Majesty say, \"The angels come down to  the region next the world, and mention the works that have been pre-  ordained in heaven; and the devils, who descend to the lowest region,  listen to what the angels say, and hear the orders predestined in  heaven, and carry them to fortune-tellers; therefore, they tell a  hundred lies with it from themselves \"'[11]    'Ibn Abbas said, \"A man of His Majesty's friends informed me, that  whilst His Majesty's friends were sitting with him one night, a very  bright star shot; and His Highness said, \"What did you say in the  days of ignorance when a star shot like this?\" They said, \"God and  His messenger know best; we used to say, a great man was born to-  night, and a great man died.\"[12] Then His Majesty said, \"You  mistook, because the shootings of these stars are neither for the  life nor death of any person; but when our cherisher orders a work,  the bearers of the imperial throne sing hallelujahs; and the  inhabitants of the regions who are near the bearers repeat it, till  it reaches the lowest regions. After the angels which are near the  bearers of the imperial throne say, \"What did your cherisher order?\"  Then they are informed; and so it is handed from one region to  another, till the information reaches the people of the lowest  region. Then the devils steal it, and carry it to their friends,  (that is) magicians; and these stars are thrown at these devils; not  for the birth or death of any person. Then the things which the  magicians tell, having heard from the devils, are true, but these  magicians tell lies, and exaggerate in what they hear\".'    Kutadah said, 'God has created stars for three uses; one of them, as  a cause of ornament of the regions; the second, to stone the devil  with; the third, to direct people going through forests and on the  sea. Therefore, whoever shall explain them otherwise, does wrong, and  loses his time, and speaks from his own invention and  embellishes'.[13]    Ibn Abbas. ['The prophet said,] \"Whoever attains to the knowledge of  astrology for any other explanation than the three aforementioned,  then verily he has attained to a branch of magic. An astrologer is a  magician, and a magician is a necromancer, and a necromancer is an  infidel.\"'[14]    This work contains the precepts and sayings of Muhammad, as declared  by his companions, who themselves heard them, or by those who heard  them immediately from those companions; and they are considered to be  binding upon the faith and conduct of Musalmans, though not all  delivered from inspiration.    Everything that is written in the Koran itself is supposed to have  been brought direct from God by the angel Gabriel.[15]      Notes:    1. In planting mango groves, it is a rule that they shall be as far  from each other as not to admit of their branches ever meeting.  'Plant trees, but let them not touch' ('_Am lagao, nis lagen nahin_')  is the maxim. [W. H. S.]    2. _Pakka_; the word here means 'cemented with lime mortar', and not  only with mud (_kachcha_).    3. The _chambeli_ is known in science as the _Jasminum grandiflorum_,  and the mango-tree as _Mangifera Indica_.    4. A small principality west of Riwa, and 110 miles north-west of  Jubbulpore. It is also known as Nagaudh, or Nagod.    5. Compare the account of the marriage of the _tulasi_ shrub (_Ocymum  sanctum_) with the salagram stone, or fossil ammonite, in Chapter 19,  _post_.    6. There is a sublime passage in the Psalms of David, where the  lightning is said to be the arrows of God. Psalm lxxvii:   17, 'The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine  arrows also went abroad.   18. The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven; the lightnings  lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.' [W. H. S.]   The passage is quoted from the Authorized Bible version; the Prayer  Book version is finer.    7. 'We guard them from every devil driven away with stones; except  him who listeneth by stealth, at whom a visible flame is darted.'  Koran, chapter 15, Sale's translation. See _post_, end of this  chapter.    8. Nine Hindoos out of ten, or perhaps ninety-nine in a hundred,  throughout India, believe the rainbow to arise from the breath of the  snake, thrown up from the surface of the earth, as water is thrown up  by whales from the surface of the ocean. [W. H. S,]    9. '_Mishkat_ is a hole in a wall in which a lamp is placed, and  _Masabih_ the plural of \"a lamp\", because traditions are compared to  lamps, and this book is like that which containeth a lamp.

In Sparta, the Ephoroi, once every nine years, watched the sky  during a whole cloudless, moonless night, in profound silence; and,  if they saw a shooting star, it was understood to indicate that the  kings of Sparta had disobeyed the gods, and their authority was, in  consequence, suspended till they had been purified by an oracle from  Delphi or Olympia.
