I can easily imagine what you feel at  Berlin in witnessing all the noxious frivolity of the world's rabble,[1]  even had you not written it to me yourself. Such prating about art, and yet  no results!!! The best description of this is to be found in Schiller's  poem \"Die Fluesse,\" where the river Spree is supposed to speak. You are  going to be married, my dear friend, or are already so, and I have had no  chance of seeing you even once previously. May all the felicity that  marriage ever bestowed on husband and wife attend you both! What can I say  to you of myself? I can only exclaim with Johanna, \"Compassionate my fate!\"  If I am spared for some years to come, I will thank the Omniscient, the  Omnipotent, for the boon, as I do for all other weal and woe. If you  mention me when you write to Goethe, strive to find words expressive of my  deep reverence and admiration. I am about to write to him myself with  regard to \"Egmont,\" for which I have written some music solely from my love  for his poetry, which always delights me. Who can be sufficiently grateful  to a great poet,--the most precious jewel of a nation! Now no more, my dear  sweet friend! I only came home this morning at four o'clock from an orgy,  where I laughed heartily, but to-day I feel as if I could weep as sadly;  turbulent pleasures always violently recoil on my spirits. As for Clemens  [Brentano, her brother], pray thank him for his complaisance; with regard  to the Cantata, the subject is not important enough for us here--it is very  different in Berlin; and as for my affection, the sister engrosses so large  a share, that little remains for the brother. Will he be content with this?    Now farewell, my dear, dear friend; I imprint a sorrowful kiss on your  forehead, thus impressing my thoughts on it as with a seal. Write soon,  very soon, to your brother,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: An expression which, as well as many others, he no doubt  borrowed from Bettina, and introduced to please her.]      68.    TO ZMESKALL.    1811.    I am disposed to engage a man who has just offered me his services,--a  music-copyist. His parents live in Vienna, which might be convenient in  many respects, but I first wish to speak to you about the terms; and as you  are disengaged to-morrow, which I, _alas_! am every day, I beg you will  take coffee with me in the afternoon, when we can discuss the matter, and  then proceed from _words to deeds_. We have also the honor to inform you  that we intend shortly to confer on you some of the decorations of the  Order of our Household,--the first class for yourself, the others for any  one you choose, except a priest. We shall expect your answer early  to-morrow. We now present you with some blotches of ink. Your    BEETHOVEN.      69.    TO ZMESKALL.    1811.    MOST HIGH-BORN OF MEN!--    We beg you to confer some goose-quills on us; we will in return send you a  whole bunch of the same sort, that you may not be obliged to pluck out your  own. It is just possible that you may yet receive the Grand Cross of the  Order of the Violoncello. We remain your gracious and most friendly of all  friends,    BEETHOVEN.      70.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.[1]    The Spring of 1811.    YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,--    As in spite of every effort I can find no copyist to write in my house, I  send you my own manuscript; all you have to do is to desire Schlemmer to  get you an efficient copyist, who must, however, write out the Trio in your  palace, otherwise there would be no security against piracy. I am better,  and hope to have the honor of waiting on you in the course of a few days,  when we must strive to make up for lost time. I always feel anxious and  uneasy when I do not attend your Royal Highness as often or as assiduously  as I wish. It is certainly the truth when I say that the loss is mine, but  I trust I shall not soon again be so unwell. Be graciously pleased to  remember me; the time may yet come when I shall be able to show you doubly  and trebly that I deserve this more than ever.    I am your Royal Highness's devoted servant,    LUDWIG V. BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Schlemmer was for many years Beethoven's copyist.]      71.    MY DEAR FRIEND,--[1]    I have taken this trouble only that I might figure correctly, and thus be  able sometimes to lead others. As for mistakes, I scarcely ever required to  have them pointed out to me, having had from my childhood such a quick  perception, that I exercised it unconscious that it ought to be so, or in  fact could be otherwise.    [Footnote 1: Written on a sheet of music-paper (oblong folio) numbered 22,  and evidently torn out of a large book. On the other side (21) is written,  in Beethoven's hand, instructions on the use of the fourth in retardations,  with five musical examples. The leaf is no doubt torn from one of the books  that Beethoven had compiled from various text-books, for the instruction of  the Archduke Rudolph. I have therefore placed Beethoven's remark here.]      72.    TO THE DRAMATIC POET TREITSCHKE.    June 6, 1811.    DEAR TREITSCHKE,--    Have you read the book, and may I venture to hope that you will be  persuaded to undertake it? Be so good as to give me an answer, as I am  prevented going to you myself. If you have already read it, then send it  back to me, that I may also look over it again before you begin to work at  it. Above all, if it be your good pleasure that I should soar to the skies  on the wings of your poetry, I entreat you to effect this as soon as  possible.    Your obedient servant,    L. V. BEETHOVEN.      73.    TO ZMESKALL.    Sept. 10, 1811.    DEAR ZMESKALL,--    Let the rehearsal stand over for the present. I must see my doctor again  to-day, of whose bungling I begin to tire. Thanks for your metronome; let  us try whether we can measure Time into Eternity with it, for it is so  _simple_ and _easily managed_ that there seems to be no impediment to this!  In the mean time we will have a conference on the subject. The mathematical  precision of clockwork is of course greater; yet formerly, in watching the  little experiments you made in my presence, I thought there was something  worthy of notice in your metronome, and I hope we shall soon succeed in  _setting it thoroughly right_. Ere long I hope to see you.    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.      74.    TO ZMESKALL.    Oct. 26, 1811.    I shall be at the \"Swan\" to-day, and hope to meet you there _to a  certainty_, but don't come too late. My foot is better; the author of so  many poetical _feet_ promises the _head_ author a sound foot within a  week's time.      75.    TO ZMESKALL.    Nov. 20, 1811.    We are deucedly obliged to you. We beg you to be careful not to lose your  well-earned fame. You are exhorted to pursue the same course, and we remain  once more your deucedly attached    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.      76.    TO ZMESKALL.    Jan. 19, 1812.    I shall be at the \"Swan\" to-day, dear Z. I have, alas! _too much_ leisure,  and you _none_! Your    BEETHOVEN.      77.    TO ZMESKALL.[1]    1812.    CONFOUNDED LITTLE QUONDAM MUSICAL COUNT!    What the deuce has become of you? Are you to be at the \"Swan\" to-day? No?  ... Yes! See from this enclosure what I have done for Hungary. When a  German undertakes a thing, even without pledging his word, he acts very  differently from one of those Hungarian Counts, such as B. [Brunswick], who  allowed me to travel by myself--from what paltry, miserable motive who can  tell?--and kept me waiting, though he did not wait for me!    My excellent little quondam musical Count,    I am now, as ever, your attached    BEETHOeVERL.    Return the enclosure, for we wish to bring it, and something else, pretty  forcibly under the notice of the Count.    [Footnote 1: The date of this and the following note is decided by the  allusion to his compositions written for Hungary (Pesth). See the  subsequent letter to Varenna.]      78.    TO ZMESKALL.    You are summoned to appear to-day at the \"Swan;\" Brunswick also comes. If  you do not appear, you are henceforth excluded from all that concerns us.  Excuses _per excellentiam_ cannot be accepted. Obedience is enjoined,  knowing that we are acting for your benefit, and that our motive is to  guard you against temptations and faithlessness _per excellentiam--dixi_.    BEETHOVEN.      79.    TO ZMESKALL.    DEAR ZMESKALL,--    The well-known watchmaker who lives close to the Freiung is to call on you.  I want a first-rate repeater, for which he asks forty ducats. As you like  that kind of thing, I beg you will exert yourself on my behalf, and select  a really good watch for me.    With the most enthusiastic admiration for a man like yourself, who is soon  to give me an opportunity of displaying in his favor my particular  knowledge of horn-playing, I am your    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.      80.    TO KAMMERPROCURATOR VARENNA,--GRATZ.[1]    1812.    If the wish to benefit the poor were not so evident in your letter, I  should have felt not a little offended by your accompanying your request to  me by the offer of payment. From my childhood, whenever my art could be  serviceable to poor suffering humanity, I have never allowed any other  motive to influence me, and never required anything beyond the heartfelt  gratification that it always caused me. With this you will receive an  Oratorio--(A), the performance of which occupies half an evening, also an  Overture and a Fantasia with Chorus--(B). If in your benevolent institution  you possess a _depot_ for such things, I beg you will deposit these three  works there, as a mark of my sympathy for the destitute; to be considered  as their property, and to be given at any concerts intended for their sole  benefit. In addition to these, you will receive an Introduction to the  \"Ruins of Athens,\" the score of which shall be written out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13097"],[0,"Lives of the Most Remarkable Criminals Who have been Condemned and Executed for (#15)"],[1,"of that faith for which  in banishment he suffered. When his son John grew up, he put him out  apprentice to a weaver, whom he served with great fidelity, and after he  came out of his time, married; but finding himself incapable to maintain  his family by his labour, he unfortunately addicted himself to  ill-courses. In this he was yet more unlucky, for having almost at his  first setting out broke open a house, he was discovered, apprehended,  tried, convicted, and put in the cart, in order to go to execution  within the fortnight; but the hangman being arrested as he was going to  Tyburn, he and the rest who were to have suffered with him were  transported through the clemency of the Government.    On this narrow escape from death, Meff was full of many penitent  resolutions, and determined with himself to follow for the future an  honest course of life, however hard and laborious, as persons are  generally inclined to believe all works in the plantations are. Yet no  sooner was he at liberty (that is, on board the transport vessel, where  he found means to make the master his friend) than much of these honest  intentions were dissolved and laid aside, to which perhaps the behaviour  of his companions and of the seamen on board the ship, did not a little  contribute. At first their passage was easy, the wind fair and  prosperous. They began to comfort one another with the hopes of living  easily in the Plantations, greedily enquiring of the seamen how persons  in their unhappy condition were treated by their masters, and whether  all the terrible relations they had had in England were really facts, or  invented only to terrify those who were to undergo that punishment.    But while these unhappy persons were thus amusing themselves a new and  unlooked for misfortune fell upon them, for in the height of Bermuda  they were surprised by two pirate sloops, who though they found no  considerable booty on board, were very well satisfied by the great  addition they made to their force, from most of those felons joining  with them in their piratical undertakings. Meff, however, and eight  others, absolutely refused to sign the paper which contained the  pirate's engagement and articles for better pursuing their designs.  These nine were, according to the barbarous practice of those kind of  people, marooned, that is, set on shore on an uninhabited island.  According to the custom of the people in such distress, they were  obliged to rub two dry sticks together till they took fire, and with  great difficulty gathered as many other sticks as made a fire large  enough to yield them some relief from the inclemency of the weather.  They caught some fowls with springes made of an old horsehair wig,  which were very tough and of a fishy taste, but after three or four  days, they became acquainted with the springes and were never afterwards  to be taken by that means. Their next resource for food was an animal  which burrowed in the ground like our rabbits, but the flesh of these  proving unwholesome, threw them into such dangerous fluxes that five out  of the nine were scarce able to go. They were then forced to take up  with such fish as they were able to catch, and even these were not only  very rank and unpleasant, but very small also, and no great plenty of  them either.    At last, when they almost despaired of ever getting off that  inhospitable island, they espied early one morning an Indian canoe come  on shore with seven persons. They hid themselves behind the rocks as  carefully as they could, and the Indians being gone up into the heart of  the island, they went down and finding much salt provisions in the boat,  they trusted themselves to the mercy of the waves.    By the providence of God they were driven in two days into an English  settlement, where Meff, instead of betaking himself to any settled  course, resolved to turn sailor, and in that capacity made several  voyages, not only to Barbadoes, Jamaica, and the rest of the British  Islands, but also to New England, Virginia, South Carolina, and other  plantations. On the main, there is no doubt but he led a life of no  great satisfaction in this occupation, which probably was the reason he  resolved to return home to England at all hazards. He did so, and had  hardly been a month in this kingdom before he fell to his old practices,  in which he was attended with the same ill-fortune as formerly; that is  to say, he was apprehended for one of his first acts, and committed to  Newgate. Out of this prison he escaped by the assistance of a certain  bricklayer, and went down to Hatfield in Hertfordshire to remain in  hiding, but as he affirmed and was generally believed, being betrayed by  the same bricklayer he was retaken, conveyed again to Newgate and  confined the utmost severity.    At his trial there arose a doubt whether the fact he had committed was  not pardoned by the Act of Indemnity then lately granted. However, the  record of his former conviction being produced, the Court ordered he  should be indicted for returning without lawful cause, on which  indictment he was convicted upon full proof, condemned and shortly after  ordered for execution.    During the space he lay under sentence he expressed much penitence for  his former ill-spent life, and together with James Reading, who was in  the same unhappy state with himself, read and prayed with the rest of  the prisoners. This Reading had been concerned in abundance of  robberies, and, as he himself owned, in some which were attended with  murder; he acknowledged he knew of the killing of Mr. Philpot, the  surveyor of the window-lights, at the perpetration of which fact Reading  said there were three persons present, two of which he knew, but as to  the third he could say nothing. This malefactor, though but thirty-five  years of age, was a very old offender, and had in his life-time been  concerned with most of the notorious gangs that at that time were in  England, some of whom he had impeached and hanged for his own  preservation; but he was at last convicted for robbing (in company with  two others) George Brownsworth of a watch and other things of a  considerable value, between Islington and the turnpike, and for it was  executed at Tyburn, the 11th of September, 1721, together with John Meff  aforesaid, then in the fortieth year of his age.          The Life of JOHN WIGLEY, a Highwayman      It is an observation which must be obvious to all my readers, that few  who addict themselves to robbing and stealing ever continue long in the  practice of those crimes before they are overtaken by Justice, not  seldom as soon as they set out.    This man had been bred a plasterer, but seems to have fallen very early  into ill courses and felonious methods of getting money, in which horrid  practice he spent his years, till taking up with an old woman who sold  brandy upon Finchley Common, she sometimes persuaded him, of late years,  to work at his trade.    There has been great suspicions that he murdered the old husband to this  woman, who was found dead in a barn or outhouse not far from Hornsey;  but Wigley, though he confessed an unlawful correspondence with the  woman, yet constantly averred his innocency of that fact, and always  asserted that though the old man's death was sudden, yet it was natural.  He used to account for it by saying that the deceased was a great  brandy-drinker, by which he had worn out his constitution, and that  being one evening benighted in his return home from London, he crawled  into that barn where he was found dead next morning, and was currently  reported to have been murdered.    Though this malefactor had committed a multitude of robberies, yet he  generally chose to go on such expeditions alone, having always great  aversion for those confederacies in villainy which we call gangs, in  which he always affirmed there was little safety, notwithstanding any  oaths, by which they might bind themselves to secrecy. For  notwithstanding some instances of their neglecting rewards when they  were to be obtained by betraying their companions, yet when life came to  be touched, they hardly ever failed of betraying all they knew. Yet he  once receded from the resolution he had made of never robbing in  company, and went out one night with two others of the same occupation  towards Islington, there they met with one Symbol Conyers, whom they  robbed of a watch, a pair of silver spurs, and four shillings in money,  at the same time treating him very ill, and terrifying him with their  pistols.    For this fact, soon after it was done, Wigley was apprehended, and  convicted at the ensuing sessions. When all hopes of life were lost, he  seemed disposed to suffer with cheerfulness and resignation that death  to which the Law had doomed him. He said, in the midst of his  afflictions it was some comfort to him that he had no children who might  be exposed by his death to the wide world, not only in a helpless and  desolate condition, but also liable to the reflections incident from his  crimes. He also observed that the immediate hand of Providence seemed to  dissipate whatever wicked persons got by rapine and plunder, so as not  only to prevent their acquiring a subsistence which might set them above  the necessity of continuing in such courses, but that they even wanted  bread to support them, when overtaken by Justice. He was near forty  years of age at the time of his death, which happened on the same day as  the malefactors last mentioned.          The Life of WILLIAM CASEY, a Robber      William Casey, whose life is the subject of our present discourse, was a  son of one of the same name, a soldier who had served his Majesty long,  and with good reputation. As is usual amongst that sort of people, the  education he gave his son was such as might fit him for the same course  of life, though at the same time he took care to provide him with a  tolerable competency of"]]]
