Lady Arabella  was not usually a humorous person, but no man or woman of the white race  could have checked the laughter which rose spontaneously to her lips.  The  circumstances were too grotesque, the contrast too violent, for subdued  mirth.  The man a debased specimen of one of the most primitive races of  the earth, and of an ugliness which was simply devilish; the woman of  high degree, beautiful, accomplished.  She thought that her first  moment's consideration of the outrage--it was nothing less in her  eyes--had given her the full material for thought.  But every instant  after threw new and varied lights on the affront.  Her indignation was  too great for passion; only irony or satire would meet the situation.  Her  cold, cruel nature helped, and she did not shrink to subject this  ignorant savage to the merciless fire-lash of her scorn.    Oolanga was dimly conscious that he was being flouted; but his anger was  no less keen because of the measure of his ignorance.  So he gave way to  it, as does a tortured beast.  He ground his great teeth together, raved,  stamped, and swore in barbarous tongues and with barbarous imagery.  Even  Lady Arabella felt that it was well she was within reach of help, or he  might have offered her brutal violence--even have killed her.    \"Am I to understand,\" she said with cold disdain, so much more effective  to wound than hot passion, \"that you are offering me your love?  Your--love?\"    For reply he nodded his head.  The scorn of her voice, in a sort of  baleful hiss, sounded--and felt--like the lash of a whip.    \"And you dared! you--a savage--a slave--the basest thing in the world of  vermin!  Take care!  I don't value your worthless life more than I do  that of a rat or a spider.  Don't let me ever see your hideous face here  again, or I shall rid the earth of you.\"    As she was speaking, she had taken out her revolver and was pointing it  at him.  In the immediate presence of death his impudence forsook him,  and he made a weak effort to justify himself.  His speech was short,  consisting of single words.  To Lady Arabella it sounded mere gibberish,  but it was in his own dialect, and meant love, marriage, wife.  From the  intonation of the words, she guessed, with her woman's quick intuition,  at their meaning; but she quite failed to follow, when, becoming more  pressing, he continued to urge his suit in a mixture of the grossest  animal passion and ridiculous threats.  He warned her that he knew she  had tried to steal his master's treasure, and that he had caught her in  the act.  But if she would be his, he would share the treasure with her,  and they could live in luxury in the African forests.  But if she  refused, he would tell his master, who would flog and torture her and  then give her to the police, who would kill her.          CHAPTER XIV--BATTLE RENEWED      The consequences of that meeting in the dusk of Diana's Grove were acute  and far-reaching, and not only to the two engaged in it.  From Oolanga,  this might have been expected by anyone who knew the character of the  tropical African savage.  To such, there are two passions that are  inexhaustible and insatiable--vanity and that which they are pleased to  call love.  Oolanga left the Grove with an absorbing hatred in his heart.  His lust and greed were afire, while his vanity had been wounded to the  core.  Lady Arabella's icy nature was not so deeply stirred, though she  was in a seething passion.  More than ever she was set upon bringing  Edgar Caswall to her feet.  The obstacles she had encountered, the  insults she had endured, were only as fuel to the purpose of revenge  which consumed her.    As she sought her own rooms in Diana's Grove, she went over the whole  subject again and again, always finding in the face of Lilla Watford a  key to a problem which puzzled her--the problem of a way to turn  Caswall's powers--his very existence--to aid her purpose.    When in her boudoir, she wrote a note, taking so much trouble over it  that she destroyed, and rewrote, till her dainty waste-basket was half-  full of torn sheets of notepaper.  When quite satisfied, she copied out  the last sheet afresh, and then carefully burned all the spoiled  fragments.  She put the copied note in an emblazoned envelope, and  directed it to Edgar Caswall at Castra Regis.  This she sent off by one  of her grooms.  The letter ran:       \"DEAR MR. CASWALL,       \"I want to have a chat with you on a subject in which I believe you     are interested.  Will you kindly call for me one day after lunch--say     at three or four o'clock, and we can walk a little way together.  Only     as far as Mercy Farm, where I want to see Lilla and Mimi Watford.  We     can take a cup of tea at the Farm.  Do not bring your African servant     with you, as I am afraid his face frightens the girls.  After all, he     is not pretty, is he?  I have an idea you will be pleased with your     visit this time.       \"Yours sincerely,       \"ARABELLA MARCH.\"    At half-past three next day, Edgar Caswall called at Diana's Grove.  Lady  Arabella met him on the roadway outside the gate.  She wished to take the  servants into her confidence as little as possible.  She turned when she  saw him coming, and walked beside him towards Mercy Farm, keeping step  with him as they walked.  When they got near Mercy, she turned and looked  around her, expecting to see Oolanga or some sign of him.  He was,  however, not visible.  He had received from his master peremptory orders  to keep out of sight--an order for which the African scored a new offence  up against her.  They found Lilla and Mimi at home and seemingly glad to  see them, though both the girls were surprised at the visit coming so  soon after the other.    The proceedings were a repetition of the battle of souls of the former  visit.  On this occasion, however, Edgar Caswall had only the presence of  Lady Arabella to support him--Oolanga being absent; but Mimi lacked the  support of Adam Salton, which had been of such effective service before.  This time the struggle for supremacy of will was longer and more  determined.  Caswall felt that if he could not achieve supremacy he had  better give up the idea, so all his pride was enlisted against Mimi.  When  they had been waiting for the door to be opened, Lady Arabella, believing  in a sudden attack, had said to him in a low voice, which somehow carried  conviction:    \"This time you should win.  Mimi is, after all, only a woman.  Show her  no mercy.  That is weakness.  Fight her, beat her, trample on her--kill  her if need be.  She stands in your way, and I hate her.  Never take your  eyes off her.  Never mind Lilla--she is afraid of you.  You are already  her master.  Mimi will try to make you look at her cousin.  There lies  defeat.  Let nothing take your attention from Mimi, and you will win.  If  she is overcoming you, take my hand and hold it hard whilst you are  looking into her eyes.  If she is too strong for you, I shall interfere.  I'll make a diversion, and under cover of it you must retire unbeaten,  even if not victorious.  Hush! they are coming.\"    The two girls came to the door together.  Strange sounds were coming up  over the Brow from the west.  It was the rustling and crackling of the  dry reeds and rushes from the low lands.  The season had been an  unusually dry one.  Also the strong east wind was helping forward  enormous flocks of birds, most of them pigeons with white cowls.  Not  only were their wings whirring, but their cooing was plainly audible.  From such a multitude of birds the mass of sound, individually small,  assumed the volume of a storm.  Surprised at the influx of birds, to  which they had been strangers so long, they all looked towards Castra  Regis, from whose high tower the great kite had been flying as usual.  But  even as they looked, the cord broke, and the great kite fell headlong in  a series of sweeping dives.  Its own weight, and the aerial force opposed  to it, which caused it to rise, combined with the strong easterly breeze,  had been too much for the great length of cord holding it.    Somehow, the mishap to the kite gave new hope to Mimi.  It was as though  the side issues had been shorn away, so that the main struggle was  thenceforth on simpler lines.  She had a feeling in her heart, as though  some religious chord had been newly touched.  It may, of course, have  been that with the renewal of the bird voices a fresh courage, a fresh  belief in the good issue of the struggle came too.  In the misery of  silence, from which they had all suffered for so long, any new train of  thought was almost bound to be a boon.  As the inrush of birds continued,  their wings beating against the crackling rushes, Lady Arabella grew  pale, and almost fainted.    \"What is that?\" she asked suddenly.    To Mimi, born and bred in Siam, the sound was strangely like an  exaggeration of the sound produced by a snake-charmer.    Edgar Caswall was the first to recover from the interruption of the  falling kite.  After a few minutes he seemed to have quite recovered his  _sang froid_, and was able to use his brains to the end which he had in  view.  Mimi too quickly recovered herself, but from a different cause.  With her it was a deep religious conviction that the struggle round her  was of the powers of Good and Evil, and that Good was triumphing.  The  very appearance of the snowy birds, with the cowls of Saint Columba,  heightened the impression.  With this conviction strong upon her, she  continued the strange battle with fresh vigour.  She seemed to tower over  Caswall, and he to give back before her oncoming.  Once again her  vigorous passes drove him to the door.  He was just going out backward  when Lady Arabella, who had been gazing at him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],[0,"Ronicky Doone (#15)"],[1,"ngth?    \"Well,\" said Ronicky, \"we've shaken hands, and now you can do what you  please! Sit down, leave the room--anything.\" He shoved his gun away  in his clothes. That brought a start from John Mark and a flash of  eagerness, but he repressed the idea, after a single glance at the  girl.    \"We've shaken hands,\" he admitted slowly, as though just realizing the  full extent of the meaning of that act. \"Very well, Ronicky, I'll send  for Caroline Smith, and more power to your tongue, but you'll never  get her away from this house without force.\"          Chapter Thirteen      _Doone Wins_    A servant answered the bell almost at once. \"Tell Miss Smith that  she's wanted in Miss Tolliver's room,\" said Mark, and, when the  servant disappeared, he began pacing up and down the room. Now and  then he cast a sharp glance to the side and scrutinized the face  of Ronicky Doone. With Ruth's permission, the latter had lighted a  cigarette and was smoking it in bland enjoyment. Again the leader  paused directly before the girl, and, with his feet spread and his  head bowed in an absurd Napoleonic posture, he considered every  feature of her face. The uncertain smile, which came trembling on her  face, elicited no response from Mark.    She dreaded him, Ronicky saw, as a slave dreads a cruel master. Still  she had a certain affection for him, partly as the result of many  benefactions, no doubt, and partly from long acquaintance; and, above  all, she respected his powers of mind intensely. The play of emotion  in her face--fear, anger, suspicion--as John Mark paced up and down  before her, was a study.    With a secret satisfaction Ronicky Doone saw that her glances  continually sought him, timidly, curiously. All vanity aside, he had  dropped a bomb under the feet of John Mark, and some day the bomb  might explode.    There was a tap at the door, it opened and Caroline Smith entered in  a dressing gown. She smiled brightly at Ruth and wanly at John Mark,  then started at the sight of the stranger.    \"This,\" said John Mark, \"is Ronicky Doone.\"    The Westerner rose and bowed.    \"He has come,\" said John Mark, \"to try to persuade you to go out for a  stroll with him, so that he can talk to you about that curious fellow,  Bill Gregg. He is going to try to soften your heart, I believe, by  telling you all the inconveniences which Bill Gregg has endured to  find you here. But he will do his talking for himself. Just why he has  to take you out of the house, at night, before he can talk to you is,  I admit, a mystery to me. But let him do the persuading.\"    Ronicky Doone turned to his host, a cold gleam in his eyes. His case  had been presented in such a way as to make his task of persuasion  almost impossible. Then he turned back and looked at the girl. Her  face was a little pale, he thought, but perfectly composed.    \"I don't know Bill Gregg,\" she said simply. \"Of course, I'm glad to  talk to you, Mr. Doone, but why not here?\"    John Mark covered a smile of satisfaction, and the girl looked at him,  apparently to see if she had spoken correctly. It was obvious that the  leader was pleased, and she glanced back at Ronicky, with a flush of  pleasure.    \"I'll tell you why I can't talk to you in here,\" said Ronicky gently.  \"Because, while you're under the same roof with this gent with the  sneer\"--he turned and indicated Mark, sneering himself as he did  so--\"you're not yourself. You don't have a halfway chance to think for  yourself. You feel him around you and behind you and beside you  every minute, and you keep wondering not what you really feel about  anything, but what John Mark wants you to feel. Ain't that the  straight of it?\"    She glanced apprehensively at John Mark, and, seeing that he did not  move to resent this assertion, she looked again with wide-eyed wonder  at Ronicky Doone.    \"You see,\" said the man of the sneer to Caroline Smith, \"that our  friend from the West has a child-like faith in my powers of--what  shall I say--hypnotism!\"    A faint smile of agreement flickered on her lips and went out. Then  she regarded Ronicky, with an utter lack of emotion.    \"If I could talk like him,\" said Ronicky Doone gravely, \"I sure  wouldn't care where I had to do the talking; but I haven't any smooth  lingo--I ain't got a lot of words all ready and handy. I'm a pretty  simple-minded sort of a gent, Miss Smith. That's why I want to get you  out of this house, where I can talk to you alone.\"    She paused, then shook her head.    \"As far as going out with me goes,\" went on Ronicky, \"well, they's  nothing I can say except to ask you to look at me close, lady, and  then ask yourself if I'm the sort of a gent a girl has got anything to  be afraid about. I won't keep you long; five minutes is all I ask. And  we can walk up and down the street, in plain view of the house, if you  want. Is it a go?\"    At least he had broken through the surface crust of indifference. She  was looking at him now, with a shade of interest and sympathy, but she  shook her head.    \"I'm afraid--\" she began.    \"Don't refuse right off, without thinking,\" said Ronicky. \"I've worked  pretty hard to get a chance to meet you, face to face. I busted into  this house tonight like a burglar--\"    \"Oh,\" cried the girl, \"you're the man--Harry Morgan--\" She stopped,  aghast.    \"He's the man who nearly killed Morgan,\" said John Mark.    \"Is that against me?\" asked Ronicky eagerly. \"Is that all against me?  I was fighting for the chance to find you and talk to you. Give me  that chance now.\"    Obviously she could not make up her mind. It had been curious that  this handsome, boyish fellow should come as an emissary from Bill  Gregg. It was more curious still that he should have had the daring  and the strength to beat Harry Morgan.    \"What shall I do, Ruth?\" she asked suddenly.    Ruth Tolliver glanced apprehensively at John Mark and then flushed,  but she raised her head bravely. \"If I were you, Caroline,\" she said  steadily, \"I'd simply ask myself if I could trust Ronicky Doone. Can  you?\"    The girl faced Ronicky again, her hands clasped in indecision and  excitement. Certainly, if clean honesty was ever written in the face  of a man, it stood written in the clear-cut features of Ronicky Doone.    \"Yes,\" she said at last, \"I'll go. For five minutes--only in the  street--in full view of the house.\"    There was a hard, deep-throated exclamation from John Mark. He rose  and glided across the room, as if to go and vent his anger elsewhere.  But he checked and controlled himself at the door, then turned.    \"You seem to have won, Doone. I congratulate you. When he's talking to  you, Caroline, I want you constantly to remember that--\"    \"Wait!\" cut in Ronicky sharply. \"She'll do her own thinking, without  your help.\"    John Mark bowed with a sardonic smile, but his face was colorless.  Plainly he had been hard hit. \"Later on,\" he continued, \"we'll see  more of each other, I expect--a great deal more, Doone.\"    \"It's something I'll sure wait for,\" said Ronicky savagely. \"I got  more than one little thing to talk over with you, Mark. Maybe about  some of them we'll have to do more than talking. Good-by. Lady, I'll  be waiting for you down by the front door of the house.\"    Caroline Smith nodded, flung one frightened and appealing glance to  Ruth Tolliver for direction, then hurried out to her room to dress.  Ronicky Doone turned back to Ruth.    \"In my part of the country,\" he said simply, \"they's some gents we  know sort of casual, and some gents we have for friends. Once in a  while you bump into somebody that's so straight and square-shooting  that you'd like to have him for a partner. If you were out West, lady,  and if you were a man--well, I'd pick you for a partner, because  you've sure played straight and square with me tonight.\"    He turned, hesitated, and, facing her again, caught up her hand,  touched it to his lips, then hurried past John Mark and through the  doorway. They could hear his rapid footfalls descending the stairs,  and John Mark was thoughtful indeed. He was watching Ruth Tolliver,  as she stared down at her hand. When she raised her head and met the  glance of the leader she flushed slowly to the roots of her hair.    \"Yes,\" muttered John Mark, still thoughtfully and half to himself,  \"there's really true steel in him. He's done more against me in one  half hour than any other dozen men in ten years.\"          Chapter Fourteen      _Her Little Joke_    A brief ten minutes of waiting beside the front door of the house, and  then Ronicky Doone heard a swift pattering of feet on the stairs.  Presently the girl was moving very slowly toward him down the hall.  Plainly she was bitterly afraid when she came beside him, under the dim  hall light. She wore that same black hat, turned back from her white  face, and the red flower beside it was a dull, uncertain blur. Decidedly  she was pretty enough to explain Bill Gregg's sorrow.    Ronicky gave her no chance to think twice. She was in the very act of  murmuring something about a change of mind, when he opened the door and,  stepping out into the starlight, invited her with a smile and a gesture  to follow. In a moment they were in the freshness of the night air. He  took her arm, and they passed slowly down the steps. At the bottom she  turned and looked anxiously at the house.    \"Lady,\" murmured Ronicky, \"they's nothing to be afraid of. We're going  to walk right up and down this street and never get out of sight of the  friends you got in this here house.\"    At the word \"friends\" she shivered slightly, and he added: \"Unless you  want to go farther of your own free will.\"    \"No, no!\" she exclaimed, as if frightened by the very prospect.    \"Then we won't. It's all up to you. You're the boss, and I'm the  cow-puncher, lady.\"    \"But tell me quickly,\" she urged. \"I--I have to go back. I mustn't stay  out too long.\"    \"Starting right in at the first,\" Ronicky said, \"I got"]]]
