[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1549"],[0,"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (#15)"],[1,"that we  are crucified and dead unto the Law. The fact is, the Law is crucified  and dead unto us. Paul purposely speaks that way in order to increase  the portion of our comfort.        VERSE 20. Yet not I.    Paul explains what constitutes true Christian righteousness. True  Christian righteousness is the righteousness of Christ who lives in us.  We must look away from our own person. Christ and my conscience must  become one, so that I can see nothing else but Christ crucified and  raised from the dead for me. If I keep on looking at myself, I am gone.    If we lose sight of Christ and begin to consider our past, we simply  go to pieces. We must turn our eyes to the brazen serpent, Christ  crucified, and believe with all our heart that He is our righteousness  and our life. For Christ, on whom our eyes are fixed, in whom we live,  who lives in us, is Lord over Law, sin, death, and all evil.        VERSE 20. But Christ liveth in me.    \"Thus I live,\" the Apostle starts out. But presently he corrects  himself, saying, \"Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\" He is the form of  my perfection. He embellishes my faith.    Since Christ is now living in me, He abolishes the Law, condemns sin,  and destroys death in me. These foes vanish in His presence. Christ  abiding in me drives out every evil. This union with Christ delivers me  from the demands of the Law, and separates me from my sinful self. As  long as I abide in Christ, nothing can hurt me.    Christ domiciling in me, the old Adam has to stay outside and remain  subject to the Law. Think what grace, righteousness, life, peace, and  salvation there is in me, thanks to that inseparable conjunction between  Christ and me through faith!    Paul has a peculiar style, a celestial way of speaking. \"I live,\" he  says, \"I live not; I am dead, I am not dead; I am a sinner, I am not  a sinner; I have the Law, I have no Law.\" When we look at ourselves we  find plenty of sin. But when we look at Christ, we have no sin. Whenever  we separate the person of Christ from our own person, we live under the  Law and not in Christ; we are condemned by the Law, dead before God.    Faith connects you so intimately with Christ, that He and you become  as it were one person. As such you may boldly say: \"I am now one with  Christ. Therefore Christ's righteousness, victory, and life are mine.\"  On the other hand, Christ may say: \"I am that big sinner. His sins and  his death are mine, because he is joined to me, and I to him.\"    Whenever remission of sins is freely proclaimed, people misinterpret it  according to Romans 3:8, \"Let us do evil, that good may come.\" As  soon as people hear that we are not justified by the Law, they reason  maliciously: \"Why, then let us reject the Law. If grace abounds, where  sin abounds, let us abound in sin, that grace may all the more abound.\"  People who reason thus are reckless. They make sport of the Scriptures  and slander the sayings of the Holy Ghost.    However, there are others who are not malicious, only weak, who may take  offense when told that Law and good works are unnecessary for salvation.  These must be instructed as to why good works do not justify, and from  what motives good works must be done. Good works are not the cause, but  the fruit of righteousness. When we have become righteous, then first  are we able and willing to do good. The tree makes the apple; the apple  does not make the tree.        VERSE 20. And the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the    faith of the Son of God.    Paul does not deny the fact that he is living in the flesh. He performs  the natural functions of the flesh. But he says that this is not his  real life. His life in the flesh is not a life after the flesh.    \"I live by the faith of the Son of God,\" he says. \"My speech is no  longer directed by the flesh, but by the Holy Ghost. My sight is no  longer governed by the flesh, but by the Holy Ghost. My hearing is no  longer determined by the flesh, but by the Holy Ghost. I cannot teach,  write, pray, or give thanks without the instrumentality of the flesh;  yet these activities do not proceed from the flesh, but from God.\"    A Christian uses earthly means like any unbeliever. Outwardly they look  alike. Nevertheless there is a great difference between them. I may live  in the flesh, but I do not live after the flesh. I do my living now \"by  the faith of the Son of God.\" Paul had the same voice, the same tongue,  before and after his conversion. Before his conversion his tongue  uttered blasphemies. But after his conversion his tongue spoke a  spiritual, heavenly language.    We may now understand how spiritual life originates. It enters the heart  by faith. Christ reigns in the heart with His Holy Spirit, who sees,  hears, speaks, works, suffers, and does all things in and through us  over the protest and the resistance of the flesh.        VERSE 20. Who loved me, and gave himself for me.    The sophistical papists assert that a person is able by natural strength  to love God long before grace has entered his heart, and to perform  works of real merit. They believe they are able to fulfill the  commandments of God. They believe they are able to do more than  God expects of them, so that they are in a position to sell their  superfluous merits to laymen, thereby saving themselves and others.  They are saving nobody. On the contrary, they abolish the Gospel, they  deride, deny, and blaspheme Christ, and call upon themselves the wrath  of God. This is what they get for living in their own righteousness, and  not in the faith of the Son of God.    The papists will tell you to do the best you can, and God will give you  His grace. They have a rhyme for it:      \"God will no more require of man, Than of himself perform he can.\"    This may hold true in ordinary civic life. But the papists apply it to  the spiritual realm where a person can perform nothing but sin, because  he is sold under sin.    Our opponents go even further than that. They say, nature is depraved,  but the qualities of nature are untainted. Again we say: This may hold  true in everyday life, but not in the spiritual life. In spiritual  matters a person is by nature full of darkness, error, ignorance,  malice, and perverseness in will and in mind. In view of this, Paul  declares that Christ began and not we. \"He loved me, and gave Himself  for me. He found in me no right mind and no good will. But the good Lord  had mercy upon me. Out of pure kindness He loved me, loved me so that  He gave Himself for me, that I should be free from the Law, from sin,  devil, and death.\"    The words, \"The Son of God who loved me, and gave Himself for me,\" are  so many thunderclaps and lightning bolts of protest from heaven against  the righteousness of the Law. The wickedness, error, darkness, ignorance  in my mind and my will were so great, that it was quite impossible  for me to be saved by any other means than by the inestimable price of  Christ's death.    Let us count the price. When you hear that such an enormous price was  paid for you, will you still come along with your cowl, your shaven  pate, your chastity, your obedience, your poverty, your works, your  merits? What do you want with all these trappings? What good are the  works of all men, and all the pains of the martyrs, in comparison with  the pains of the Son of God dying on the Cross, so that there was not  a drop of His precious blood, but it was all shed for your sins. If you  could properly evaluate this incomparable price, you would throw all  your ceremonies, vows, works, and merits into the ash can. What awful  presumption to imagine that there is any work good enough to pacify God,  when to pacify God required the invaluable price of the death and blood  of His own and only Son?        VERSE 20. For me.    Who is this \"me\"? I, wretched and damnable sinner, dearly beloved of the  Son of God. If I could by work or merit love the Son of God and come to  Him, why should He have sacrificed Himself for me? This shows how the  papists ignore the Scriptures, particularly the doctrine of faith.  If they had paid any attention at all to these words, that it was  absolutely necessary for the Son of God to be given into death for me,  they would never have invented so many hideous heresies.    I always say, there is no remedy against the sects, no power to resist  them, except this article of Christian righteousness. If we lose this  article we shall never be able to combat errors or sects. What business  have they to make such a fuss about works or merits? If I, a condemned  sinner, could have been purchased and redeemed by any other price, why  should the Son of God have given Himself for me? Just because there  was no other price in heaven and on earth big and good enough, was it  necessary for the Son of God to be delivered for me. This He did out of  His great love for me, for the Apostle says, \"Who loved me.\"    Did the Law ever love me? Did the Law ever sacrifice itself for me? Did  the Law ever die for me? On the contrary, it accuses me, it frightens  me, it drives me crazy. Somebody else saved me from the Law, from sin  and death unto eternal life. That Somebody is the Son of God, to whom be  praise and glory forever.    Hence, Christ is no Moses, no tyrant, no lawgiver, but the Giver of  grace, the Savior, full of mercy. In short, He is no less than infinite  mercy and ineffable goodness, bountifully giving Himself for us.  Visualize Christ in these His true colors. I do not say that it is easy.  Even in the present diffusion of the Gospel light, I have much trouble  to see Christ as Paul portrays Him. So deeply has the diseased opinion  that Christ is a lawgiver sunk into my bones. You younger men are a good  deal better off than we who are old. You have never become infected  with the nefarious errors on which I suckled all my youth, until at the  mention of the name of Christ I shivered with fear. You, I say, who are "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15535"],[0,"Violin Mastery: Talks with Master Violinists and Teachers (#15)"],[1,"to the passage and said  to me with a smile: 'After all, whether you play it _this_ way, or  _that_ way, what's the difference?' Then I realized that he had stressed  his notes correctly a few times by chance, and that his own sense of  rhythm did not tell him that there were no two ways about it. The  rhythmic and tonal _nuances_ in a quartet cannot be marked too perfectly  in order to secure a beautiful and finished performance. And such a  violinist as the one mentioned, in spite of his tone and technic, was  never meant for an _ensemble_ player.    \"I have never believed in a quartet getting together and 'reading' a  new work as a preparation for study. As first violin I have always made  it my business to first study the work in score, myself, to study it  until I knew the whole composition absolutely, until I had a mental  picture of its meaning, and of the interrelation of its four voices in  detail. Thirty-two years of experience have justified my theory. Once  the first violin knows the work the practicing may begin; for he is in a  position gradually and tactfully to guide the working-out of the  interpretation without losing time in the struggle to correct faults in  balance which are developed in an unprepared 'reading' of the work.  There is always one important melody, and it is easier to find it  studying the score, to trace it with eye and mind in its contrapuntal  web, than by making voyages of discovery in actual playing.    \"Every player has his own qualities, every instrument its own  advantages. Certain passages in a second violin or viola part may be  technically better suited to the hand of the player, to the nature of  the instrument, and--they will sound better than others. Yet from the  standpoint of the composition the passages that 'lie well' are often not  the more important. This is hard for the player--what is easy for him  he unconsciously is inclined to stress, and he must be on his guard  against it. This is another strong argument in favor of a thorough  preliminary study on the part of the leading violin of the construction  of the work.\"                     THE FIRST VIOLIN IN CHAMBER MUSIC VERSUS                          THE ORCHESTRA CONDUCTOR    The comparison which I asked Mr. Kneisel to make is one which he could  establish with authority. Aside from his experience as director of his  quartet, he has been the _concert-meister_ of such famous foreign  orchestras as Bilse's and that of the _Hofburg Theater_ in Vienna and,  for eighteen years, of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in this country. He  has also conducted over one hundred concerts of the Boston Symphony, and  was director of the Worcester Music Festivals.    \"Nikisch once said to me, after he had heard us play the Schumann A  minor quartet in Boston: 'Kneisel, it was beautiful, and I felt that you  had more difficulty in developing it than I have with an orchestral  score!' And I think he was right. First of all the symphonic conductor  is an autocrat. There is no appeal from the commands of his baton. But  the first violin of a quartet is, in a sense, only the 'first among  peers.' The velvet glove is an absolute necessity in his case. He must  gain his art ends by diplomacy and tact, he must always remember that  his fellow artists are solo players. If he is arbitrary, no matter how  right he may be, he disturbs that fine feeling of artistic fellowship,  that delicate balance of individual temperaments harmonized for and by a  single purpose. In this connection I do not mind confessing that though  I enjoy a good game of cards, I made it a rule never to play cards with  my colleagues during the hours of railroad traveling involved in keeping  our concert engagements. I played chess. In chess the element of luck  does not enter. Each player is responsible for what he does or leaves  undone. And defeat leaves no such sting as it does when all may be  blamed on chance. In an _ensemble_ that strives for perfection there  must be no undercurrents of regret, of dissatisfaction--nothing that  interferes with the sympathy and good will which makes each individual  artist do his best. And so I have never regretted giving cards the  go-by!\"                        HINTS TO THE SERIOUS VIOLIN STUDENT    Of late years Mr. Kneisel's activity as a teacher has added to his  reputation. Few teachers can point to a galaxy of artist pupils which  includes such names as Samuel Gardner, Sascha Jacobsen, Breskin, Helen  Jeffry and Olive Meade (who perpetuates the ideals of his great string  _ensemble_ in her own quartet). \"What is the secret of your method?\" I  asked him first of all. \"Method is hardly the word,\" he told me. \"It  sounds too cut-and-dried. I teach according to principles, which must,  of course, vary in individual cases; yet whose foundation is fixed. And  like Joachim, or Leschetiszky, I have preparatory teachers.                                 THE GENERAL FAULT    \"My experience has shown me that the fundamental fault of most pupils is  that they do not know how to hold either the bow or the violin. Here in  America the violin student as a rule begins serious technical study too  late, contrary to the European practice. It is a great handicap to begin  really serious work at seventeen or eighteen, when the flexible bones  of childhood have hardened, and have not the pliability needed for  violin gymnastics. It is a case of not bending the twig as you want the  tree to grow in time. And those who study professionally are often more  interested in making money as soon as possible than in bending all their  energies on reaching the higher levels of their art. Many a promising  talent never develops because its possessor at seventeen or eighteen is  eager to earn money as an orchestra or 'job' player, instead of  sacrificing a few years more and becoming a true artist. I've seen it  happen time and again: a young fellow really endowed who thinks he can  play for a living and find time to study and practice 'after hours.' And  he never does!    \"But to return to the general fault of the violin student. There is a  certain angle at which the bow should cross the strings in order to  produce those vibrations which give the roundest, fullest, most perfect  tone [he took his own beautiful instrument out of its case to illustrate  the point], and the violin must be so held that the bow moves straight  across the strings in this manner. A deviation from the correct attack  produces a scratchy tone. And it is just in the one fundamental thing:  the holding of the violin in exactly the same position when it is taken  up by the player, never varying by so much as half-an-inch, and the  correct attack by the bow, in which the majority of pupils are  deficient. If the violin is not held at the proper angle, for instance,  it is just as though a piano were to stand on a sloping floor. Too many  students play 'with the violin' on the bow, instead of holding the  violin steady, and letting the bow play.    \"And in beginning to study, this apparently simple, yet fundamentally  important, principle is often overlooked or neglected. Joachim, when he  studied as a ten-year-old boy under Hellmesberger in Vienna, once played  a part in a concerto by Maurer, for four violins and piano. His teacher  was displeased: 'You'll never be a fiddler!' he told him, 'you use your  bow too stiffly!' But the boy's father took him to Boehm, and he remained  with this teacher for three years, until his fundamental fault was  completely overcome. And if Joachim had not given his concentrated  attention to his bowing while there was still time, he would never have  been the great artist he later became.                               THE ART OF THE BOW    \"You see,\" he continued, \"the secret of really beautiful violin playing  lies in the bow. A Blondin crossing Niagara finds his wire hard and firm  where he first steps on it. But as he progresses it vibrates with  increasing intensity. And as the tight-rope walker knows how to control  the vibrations of his wire, so the violinist must master the vibrations  of his strings. Each section of the string vibrates with a different  quality of tone. Most pupils think that a big tone is developed by  pressure with the bow--yet much depends on what part of the string this  pressure is applied. Fingering is an art, of course, but the great art  is the art of the bow, the 'art of bowing,' as Tartini calls it. When a  pupil understands it he has gone far.    \"Every pupil may be developed to a certain degree without ever  suspecting how important a factor the manipulation of the bow will be in  his further progress. He thinks that if the fingers of his left hand are  agile he has gained the main end in view. But then he comes to a  stop--his left hand can no longer aid him, and he finds that if he wants  to play with real beauty of expression the bow supplies the only true  key. Out of a hundred who reach this stage,\" Mr. Kneisel went on, rather  sadly, \"only some five or six, or even less, become great artists. They  are those who are able to control the bow as well as the left hand. All  real art begins with phrasing, and this, too, lies altogether in the  mastery of bow--the very soul of the violin!\"    I asked Mr. Kneisel how he came to write his own \"Advanced Exercises\"  for the instrument. \"I had an idea that a set of studies, in which each  single study presented a variety of technical figures might be a relief  from the exercises in so many excellent methods, where pages of scales  are followed by pages of arpeggios, pages of double-notes and so forth.  It is very monotonous to practice pages and pages of a single technical  figure,\" he added. \"Most pupils simply will not do it!\" He brought out a  copy of his \"Exercises\" and showed me their plan. \"Here, for instance, I  have scales, trills, arpeggios--all in the same study, and the study is  conceived as a musical composition instead of a technical formula."]]]
