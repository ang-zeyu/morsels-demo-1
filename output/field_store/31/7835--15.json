Yes, I must smile when I reflect that  unconsciously I uttered the magic formula by which our red-and  blue-coated cavaliers more frequently win female hearts than by their  mustachioed attractiveness--\"Tomorrow I leave, probably never to  return.\"           *       *       *       *       *    During the night which I passed at Goslar, a remarkably curious  occurrence befell me. Even now I cannot think of it without terror. I am  not cowardly by nature and Heaven knows that I have never experienced  any special anguish when, for example, a naked blade has sought to make  acquaintance with my nose or when I have lost my way at night in a wood  of ill repute, or when, at a concert, a yawning lieutenant has  threatened to swallow me--but _ghosts_ I fear almost as much as the  _Austrian Observer_[52]. What is fear? Does it originate in the brain or  in the emotions? This was a point which I frequently disputed with Dr.  Saul Ascher, when we accidentally met in the Cafe Royal in Berlin, where  for a long time I used to take dinner. The Doctor invariably maintained  that we feared anything, because we recognized it as fearful, by a  certain process of reasoning, for reason alone is an active power--the  emotions are not. While I ate and drank my fill, the Doctor continued to  demonstrate to me the advantages of reason. Toward the end of his  demonstration, he was accustomed to look at his watch and remark  conclusively, \"Reason is the highest principle!\" Reason! Never do I hear  this word without recalling Dr. Saul Ascher, with his abstract legs, his  tight-fitting transcendental-grey long coat, his forbidding icy face,  which could have served as frontispiece for a textbook of geometry. This  man, deep in the fifties, was a personified straight line. In his  striving for the positive, the poor man had, by dint of philosophizing,  eliminated all the splendid things from life, such as sunshine,  religion, and flowers, so that there remained nothing for him but the  cold positive grave. The Apollo Belvedere and Christianity were the two  special objects of his malice, and he had even published a pamphlet  against the latter, in which he had demonstrated its unreasonableness  and untenableness. In addition to this, he has written a great number of  books, in all of which _Reason_ shines forth in all its peculiar  excellence, and as the poor Doctor meant what he said in all  seriousness, he was, so far, deserving of respect. But the great joke  consisted precisely in this, that the Doctor invariably cut such a  seriously absurd figure when he could not comprehend what every child  comprehends, simply because it is a child. I visited the Doctor of  Reason several times in his own house, where I found him in company with  very pretty girls; for Reason, it seems, does not prohibit the enjoyment  of the things of this world. Once, however, when I called, his servant  told me the \"Herr Doctor\" had just died. I experienced as much emotion  on this occasion as if I had been told that the \"Herr Doctor\" had just  moved.    To return to Goslar. \"The highest principle is Reason,\" said I  soothingly to myself, as I slid into bed. But it availed me nothing. I  had just been reading in Varnhagen von Ense's _German Tales,_ which I  had brought with me from Clausthal, that terrible story of the son who  went about to murder his father and was warned in the night by the ghost  of his mother. The wonderful truthfulness with which this story is  depicted, caused, while reading it, a shudder of horror in all my veins.  Ghost-stories invariably thrill us with additional horror when read  during a journey, and by night in a town, in a house, and in a room  where we have never been before. We involuntarily reflect, \"How many  horrors may have been perpetrated on this very spot where I now lie!\"  Meanwhile, the moon shone into my room in a doubtful, suspicious manner;  all kinds of uncalled-for shapes quivered on the walls, and as I raised  myself in bed and glanced fearfully toward them, I beheld--    There is nothing so uncanny as when a man accidentally sees his own face  by moonlight in a mirror. At the same instant there struck a  deep-booming, yawning bell, and that so slowly and wearily that after  the twelfth stroke I firmly believed that twelve full hours must have  passed and that it would begin to strike twelve all over again. Between  the last and next to the last tones, there struck in very abruptly, as  if irritated and scolding, another bell, which was apparently out of  patience with the slowness of its colleague. As the two iron tongues  were silenced, and the stillness of death sank over the whole house, I  suddenly seemed to hear, in the corridor before my chamber, something  halting and shuffling along, like the unsteady steps of an old man. At  last my door opened, and there entered slowly the late departed Dr. Saul  Ascher. A cold fever ran through me. I trembled like an ivy leaf and  scarcely dared to gaze upon the ghost. He appeared as usual, with the  same transcendental-grey long coat, the same abstract legs, and the same  mathematical face; only this latter was a little yellower than usual,  the mouth, which formerly described two angles of 22-1/2 degrees, was  pinched together, and the circles around the eyes had a somewhat greater  radius. Tottering, and supporting himself as usual upon his Malacca  cane, he approached me, and said in his usual drawling accent but in a  friendly manner, \"Do not be afraid, nor believe that I am a ghost. It is  a deception of your imagination, if you believe that you see me as a  ghost. What is a ghost? Define one. Deduce for me the conditions of the  possibility of a ghost. What reasonable connection is there between such  an apparition and reason? Reason, I say, _Reason!\"_ Here the ghost  proceeded to analyze reason, cited from Kant's _Critique of Pure  Reason_, part II, section I, book 2, chap. 3, the distinction between  phenomena and noumena, then went on to construct a hypothetical system  of ghosts, piled one syllogism on another, and concluded with the  logical proof that there are absolutely no ghosts. Meanwhile the cold  sweat ran down my back, my teeth clattered like castanets, and from very  agony of soul I nodded an unconditional assent to every assertion which  the phantom doctor alleged against the absurdity of being afraid of  ghosts, and which he demonstrated with such zeal that once, in a moment  of distraction, instead of his gold watch he drew a handful of  grave-worms from his vest-pocket, and remarking his error, replaced them  with a ridiculous but terrified haste. \"Reason is the highest--!\" Here  the clock struck _one_, but the ghost vanished.    The next morning I left Goslar and wandered along, partly at random, and  partly with the intention of visiting the brother of the Clausthal  miner. Again we had beautiful Sunday weather. I climbed hill and  mountain, saw how the sun strove to drive away the mists, and wandered  merrily through the quivering woods, while around my dreaming head rang  the bell-flowers of Goslar. The mountains stood in their white  night-robes, the fir-trees were shaking sleep out of their branching  limbs, the fresh morning wind curled their drooping green locks, the  birds were at morning prayers, the meadow-vale flashed like a golden  surface sprinkled with diamonds, and the shepherd passed over it with  his bleating flock.           *       *       *       *       *    After much circuitous wandering I came to the dwelling of the brother of  my Clausthal friend. Here I stayed all night and experienced the  following beautiful poem--      Stands the but upon the mountain      Where the ancient woodman dwells    There the dark-green fir-trees rustle,      Casts the moon its golden spells.      In the but there stands an arm-chair,      Richly carved and cleverly;    He who sits therein is happy,      And that happy man am I.      On the footstool sits a maiden,      On my lap her arms repose,    With her eyes like blue stars beaming,      And her mouth a new-born rose.      And the dear blue stars shine on me,      Wide like heaven's great arch their gaze;    And her little lily finger      Archly on the rose she lays.      Nay, the mother cannot see us,      For she spins the whole day long;    And the father plays the cithern      As he sings a good old song.      And the maiden softly whispers,      Softly, that none may hear;    Many a solemn little secret      Hath she murmured in my ear.      \"Since I lost my aunt who loved me,      Now we never more repair    To the shooting-lodge at Goslar,      And it is so pleasant there!      \"Here above it is so lonely,      On the rocks where cold winds blow;    And in winter we are always      Deeply buried in the snow.      \"And I'm such a timid creature,      And I'm frightened like a child    At the evil mountain spirits,      Who by night are raging wild\"      Silent falls the winsome maiden,      Frightened by her own surmise,    Little hands, so white and dimpled,      Pressing on her sweet blue eyes.      Louder now the fir-trees rustle,      Spinning-wheel more harshly drones;    In their pauses sounds the cithern,      And the old song's simple tones:      \"Do not fear, my tender nursling,      Aught of evil spirits' might;    For good angels still are watching      Round thy pathway day and night.\"      Now the fir-tree's dark-green fingers      Tap upon the window low,    And the moon, a yellow listener,      Casts within her sweetest glow.      Father, mother, both are sleeping,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12519"],[0,"The Virginia Housewife; Or, Methodical Cook (#15)"],[1,"up. Put it over the fowls or turkies--or you may put it on a  dish with a piece of fried bread first buttered--then toasted brown, and  just dipped into boiling water. This is very good sauce for white fowls  of all kinds.           *       *       *       *       *    COMMON SAUCE.    Plain butter melted thick, with a spoonful of walnut pickle or catsup,  is a very good sauce; but you may put as many things as you choose into  sauces.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MELT BUTTER.    Nothing is more simple than this process, and nothing so generally done  badly. Keep a quart tin sauce-pan, with a cover to it, exclusively for  this purpose; weigh one quarter of a pound of good butter; rub into it  two tea-spoonsful of flour; when well mixed, put it in the sauce-pan  with one table-spoonful of water, and a little salt; cover it, and set  the sauce-pan in a larger one of boiling water; shake it constantly till  completely melted, and beginning to boil. If the pan containing the  butter be set on coals, it will oil the butter and spoil it. This  quantity is sufficient for one sauce-boat. A great variety of delicious  sauces can be made, by adding different herbs to melted butter, all of  which are excellent to eat with fish, poultry, or boiled butchers' meat.  To begin with parsley--wash a large bunch very clean, pick the leaves  from the stems carefully, boil them ten minutes in salt and water, drain  them perfectly dry, mince them exceedingly fine, and stir them in the  butter when it begins to melt. When herbs are added to butter, you must  put two spoonsful of water instead of one. Chervil, young fennel,  burnet, tarragon, and cress, or pepper-grass, may all be used, and must  be prepared in the same manner as the parsley.           *       *       *       *       *    CAPER SAUCE.    Is made by mixing a sufficient quantity of capers, and adding them to  the melted butter, with a little of the liquor from the capers; where  capers cannot be obtained, pickled nasturtiums make a very good  substitute, or even green pickle minced and put with the butter.           *       *       *       *       *    OYSTER CATSUP.    Get fine fresh oysters, wash them in their own liquor, put them in a  marble mortar with salt, pounded mace, and cayenne pepper, in the  proportions of one ounce salt, two drachms mace, and one of cayenne to  each pint of oysters; pound them together, and add a pint of white wine  to each pint; boil it some minutes, and rub it through a sieve; boil it  again, skim it, and when cold, bottle, cork, and seal it. This  composition gives a fine flavour to white sauces, and if a glass of  brandy be added, it will keep good for a considerable time.           *       *       *       *       *    CELERY VINEGAR.    Pound two gills of celery seed, put it into a bottle ind fill it with  strong vinegar; shake it every day for a fortnight, then strain it, and  keep it for use. It will impart a pleasant flavour of celery to any  thing with which it is used. A very delicious flavour of thyme may be  obtained, by gathering it when in full perfection; it must be picked  from the stalks, a large handful of it put into a jar, and a quart of  vinegar or brandy poured on it; cover it very close--next day, take all  the thyme out, put in as much more; do this a third time; then strain  it, bottle and seal it securely. This is greatly preferable to the dried  thyme commonly used, during the season when it cannot be obtained in a  fresh state. Mint may be prepared in the same way. The flavour of both  these herbs must be preserved by care in the preparation: if permitted  to stand more than twenty hours in the liquor they are infused in, a  coarse and bitter taste will be extracted, particularly from mint.           *       *       *       *       *      VEGETABLES.      TO DRESS SALAD.    To have this delicate dish in perfection, the lettuce, pepper grass,  chervil, cress, &c. should be gathered early in the morning, nicely  picked, washed, and laid in cold water, which will be improved by adding  ice; just before dinner is ready to be served, drain the water from your  salad, cut it into a bowl, giving the proper proportions of each plant;  prepare the following mixture to pour over it: boil two fresh eggs ten  minutes, put them in water to cool, then take the yelks in a soup plate,  pour on them a table spoonful of cold water, rub them with a wooden  spoon until they are perfectly dissolved; then add two spoonsful of oil:  when well mixed, put in a tea-spoonful of salt, one of powdered sugar,  and one of made mustard; when all these are united and quite smooth,  stir in two table spoonsful of common, and two of tarragon vinegar; put  it over the salad, and garnish the top with the whites of the eggs cut  into rings, and lay around the edge of the bowl young scallions, they  being the most delicate of the onion tribe.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BOIL POTATOS.    Wash them, but do not pare or cut them, unless they are very large; fill  a sauce-pan half full of potatos of equal size, (or make them so by  dividing the large ones,) put to them as much cold water as will cover  them about an inch; they are sooner boiled, and more savoury, than when  drowned in water; most boiled things are spoiled by having too little  water, but potatos are often spoiled by having too much; they must  merely be covered, and a little allowed for waste in boiling, so that  they must be just covered when done. Set them on a moderate fire till  they boil, then take them off, and set them by the fire to simmer  slowly, till they are soft enough to admit a fork; (place no dependence  on the usual test of their skin's cracking, which, if they are boiled  fast, will happen to some potatos when they are not half done, and the  inside is quite hard,) then pour off the water, (if you let the potatos  remain in the water a moment after they are done enough, they will  become waxy and watery,) uncover the sauce-pan, and set it at such a  distance from the fire as will secure it from burning; their superfluous  moisture will evaporate, and the potatos will be perfectly dry and  mealy. You may afterwards place a napkin, folded up to the size of the  sauce-pan's diameter, over the potatos, to keep them dry and mealy till  wanted, this method of managing potatos, is, in every respect, equal to  steaming them, and they are dressed in half the time.           *       *       *       *       *    TO FRY SLICED POTATOS.    Peel large potatos, slice them about a quarter of an inch thick, or cut  them in shavings round and round, as you would peel a lemon; dry them  well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping. Take care that  your fat and frying-pan are quite clean; put it on a quick fire, watch  it, and as soon as the lard boils and is still, put in the slices of  potatos, and keep moving them till they are crisp; take them up, and lay  them to drain on a sieve; send them up with very little salt sprinkled  on them.           *       *       *       *       *    POTATOS MASHED.    When the potatos are thoroughly boiled, drain and dry them perfectly,  pick out every speck, and rub them through a colander into a clean  stew-pan; to a pound of potatos put half an ounce of butter, and a  table-spoonful of milk; do not make them too moist; mix them well  together. When the potatos are getting old and specked, and in frosty  weather, this is the best way of dressing them--you may put them into  shapes, touch them over with yelk of egg, and brown them very slightly  before a slow fire.           *       *       *       *       *    POTATOS MASHED WITH ONIONS.    Prepare some onions by putting them through a sieve, and mix them with  potatos; in proportioning the onions to the potatos, you will be guided  by your wish to have more or less of their flavour.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST POTATOS.    Wash and dry your potatos, (all of a size,) and put them in a tin Dutch  oven, or cheese toaster; take care not to put them too near the fire, or  they will get burned on the outside before they are warmed through.  Large potatos, will require two hours to roast them. To save time and  trouble, some cooks half boil them first.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST POTATOS UNDER MEAT.    Half boil large potatos, drain the water from them, and put them into an  earthen dish or small tin pan, under meat that is roasting, and baste  them with some of the dripping; when they are browned on one side, turn  them and brown the other; send them up around the meat, or in a small  dish.           *       *       *       *       *    POTATO BALLS.    Mix mashed potatos with the yelk of an egg, roll them into balls, flour  them, or cover them with egg and bread crumbs, fry them in clean  dripping, or brown them in a Dutch oven. They are an agreeable vegetable  relish, and a supper dish.           *       *       *       *       *    JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES.    Are boiled and dressed in the various ways we have just before directed  for potatos. They should be covered with thick melted butter, or a nice  white or brown sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    CABBAGE.    Pick cabbages very clean, and wash them thoroughly; then look them  carefully over again; quarter them if they are very large; put them into  a sauce pan with plenty of boiling water; if any skum rises, take it  off, put a large spoonful of salt into the sauce pan, and boil 'them  till the stalks feel tender. A young cabbage will take about twenty  minutes, or half an hour; when full grown, nearly an hour; see that they  are well covered with water all the time, and that no or smoke arises  from stirring the fire. With careful management, they will look as  beautiful when dressed as they did when growing. It will much ameliorate  the flavour of strong old cabbages, to boil them in two waters, _i.e._  when they are "]]]
