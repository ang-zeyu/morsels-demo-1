This practice has come from Great  Britain, where the impeachment is made by the house of commons, and the  house of lords is the high court of impeachment.    Sec.7. The house of representatives, in a case of impeachment, acts in  nearly the same manner as a grand jury in a court of law. A complaint is  made to the house; and if, upon examination, there appear to a majority  of the members present sufficient grounds for the charge, an accusation  in writing is prepared, called _articles of impeachment_, and delivered  to the senate. In some states, a majority of the members elected is  necessary to impeach. The president of the senate orders the court to be  summoned. The accused is brought before the court to answer to the  charge, and has counsel assigned him. The senators are sworn truly to  try and determine the impeachment according to evidence; and a day is  fixed for trial.    Sec.8. The house of representatives usually choose from their number a  committee of managers to conduct the trial, the proceedings in which are  the same as in law courts. The senators retire and deliberate as jurors  in such courts. Two-thirds of the senators--in some states two-thirds of  all the senators elected--must concur in order to convict the person  accused. If a person is convicted, the court may remove him from  office, or disqualify him to hold any office in the state, for a time,  or for life; or may both remove and disqualify him. This court can  pronounce no other sentence. But if the act committed is a crime, the  offender may also be indicted, tried, and punished in a court of  justice.    Sec.9. Judicial officers may also be removed by the governor on address of  the legislature. If a judge is suspected of corrupt conduct in his  office, or of being incompetent to discharge its duties, complaint is  made to the legislature, and the party complained of is notified, and an  opportunity is given him of being heard in his defense. If both  branches, by the required majorities, concur in the opinion that he  ought to be removed, they address the governor, setting forth their  reasons for the removal. If the governor considers the reasons  sufficient, the officer is removed. This mode of removal does not exist  in all the states. In New York, and perhaps in a few other states, the  legislature makes the removal without the concurrence of the governor;  and in that state some of the lower judicial officers may be removed by  the senate on the recommendation of the governor. In a few states,  judges are not removable by impeachment.          Chapter XXI.    Assessment and Collection of Taxes.        Sec.1. Every government must have the power of providing means for its  support. The money which is needed to pay the expenses of administering  the government, if the state has no permanent source of revenue, or  income, must be raised by taxation. A _tax_ is a rate or sum of money  assessed upon the person or property of a citizen for the use of the  state. When assessed upon the person, it is called a _poll-tax_, or  _capitation tax_, being a certain sum on every poll, or head. But as  persons ought generally to contribute to the public expenses according  to their ability, taxes are more just and equal when laid upon the  property of the citizens. Few poll-taxes are levied in this country.    Sec.2. There are certain kinds of property which are exempt from taxation;  such as the corporate property of the state, of counties, and of towns,  including the buildings in which the public business is done, the  prisons, jails, asylums, &c., and the lands attached to them;  school-houses and meeting-houses, with the lands attached;  burying-grounds, and the property of literary and charitable  institutions. But the property of business corporations, as rail-road,  banking, insurance, manufacturing, and other stock companies, like that  of individuals, is liable to taxation. _Real estate_, or _real  property_, is land with the buildings and other articles erected or  growing thereon. _Personal estate_, or _personal property_, consists of  movables, as goods, chattels, money, and debts due from solvent debtors.    Sec.3. As the property of every person is to be assessed in proportion to  its value, it is necessary, first, to make a correct valuation of all  the taxable property. For this purpose, the assessor or assessors pass  through the town, and make a list of the names of all the taxable  inhabitants, and the estimated value of the property, real and personal,  of each; and returns of the same are made to the proper county officers,  who cause the tax-list for each town to be made out, and order the taxes  to be collected.    Sec.4. In some states, persons liable to taxation are themselves required  to furnish lists of all their taxable property, printed blank lists  having been previously distributed among them for this purpose. To  secure an accurate valuation, the assessors, (called also _listers_,)  may require persons to make oath that they have made a true statement of  their property and its value. In states where the polls of the  tax-payers are assessed, these also are set down in the lists at such  sums as the law directs to be affixed to each poll.    Sec.5. Before a tax-list can be made out, it must be known what amount is  to be collected in each town. This amount is made up of three parts:  First, the sum wanted to pay the expenses of the town for the preceding  year; secondly, the town's share of the county expenses; and thirdly,  its proportional share of the expenses of the state government, or of  what is to be raised for state purposes.    Sec.6. The apportionment of the amount of the state and county expenses  among the several towns, is made according to the amount of property in  each as valued by the assessors. The state auditor or controller, having  received from the several counties returns of the value of the property  in each county, is enabled to determine its quota of the amount to be  raised for state purposes. To each county's share of the state expenses  is added the sum to be raised in the county for county purposes; and the  amount is apportioned among the towns in proportion to the value of the  assessed property of each. Then adding to each town's share of the  amount of the state and county expenses, the amount to be raised for  town purposes, gives the sum to be collected in the town.    Sec.7. Having thus ascertained the sum to be raised in each town, the  officers whose duty it is, cause a tax-list to be made out, in which the  amount of each person's tax is set opposite his name and the estimated  value of his property. The tax-list of each town, certified and signed  by the proper persons, is put into the hands of the collector, with a  warrant ordering the same to be collected.    Sec.8. The money collected for county and state purposes is paid to the  county treasurer, who pays to the state treasurer the amount raised in  the county for state expenses, and retains the remainder to be expended  in the county. The money collected for town purposes is paid to such  persons in the town as are by law authorized to receive the same.          Chapter XXII.    Education. School Funds; Schools, &c.        Sec.1. The proper object of government is to promote the welfare and  happiness of its citizens. For this purpose, it must provide for making  and properly administering laws to protect the people in the enjoyment  of life and the fruits of their labor. But it should go further, and  make express provision for improving the condition of the people,  especially the less fortunate portions of them.    Sec.2. The prosperity of a state or nation depends essentially upon the  education of its citizens. This is seen by comparing the condition of  the people of this country with the condition of the people of those  countries where the benefits of education are not enjoyed. Ignorance  tends to make men idle, vicious, and miserable. On the other hand,  learning is not only a means of enjoyment in itself, but of improving  the social condition of a people.    Sec.3. Again, a free government is better adapted than any other to promote  the welfare of a nation. But if the people are not properly educated,  they are incapable of self-government. And as many persons are unable to  pay for the tuition of their children, the safety of the government  itself requires the establishment of a system of education, by which the  great body of the people may be fitted to discharge their social and  political duties. The states have accordingly instituted school systems  for the instruction of children and youth of all classes at the public  expense.    Sec.4. In most of the states, the schools are supported only in part, in a  few of them wholly, at the expense of the states. Some states have  provided funds, the income of which is annually applied to this object.  _Fund_ generally signifies the money or capital stock employed in  carrying on trade or any other business operation. _State funds_ are the  moneys and other property of the state which are set apart for paying  the expenses of the government, or for the construction of canals,  roads, and other public improvements. The interest of these funds, and  the income from other sources, are called the _revenue_.    Sec.5. In some states, school funds are created by appropriating the public  lands, which are lands owned by the state as a body corporate. The  proceeds of these lands, from sales or rents, constitute a part or the  whole of the school fund, the interest of which is annually applied to  the support of schools. If the income from the school fund is  insufficient for this purpose, the deficiency may, as is done in some  states, be supplied, in whole or in part, by taxation, or from the state  treasury.    Sec.6. Many of the new states have large school funds. At an early period,  while most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15323"],[0,"The Green Eyes of Bâst (#15)"],[1,". He evidently thought he  had got away unobserved. He was carrying--that.\"    \"Good heavens!\" I said. \"The young fool seems determined to put a rope  around his own neck.\"    \"As a matter of fact,\" continued Gatton, \"he was _not_ unobserved. He  was followed right across St. James's Park. By the lake he lingered  for some time; and the man tracking him kept carefully out of sight,  of course. There was nobody else about at the moment, and presently,  thinking himself safe, Coverly dropped his bag in the water!  Immediately he set off walking rapidly again, and he was followed  right to Miss Merlin's door. But the spot where he had dropped the bag  had been marked, of course, and when I came in here to-day it had been  fished, up--and placed there for my inspection.\"    With ever-growing misgivings:    \"What does it contain?\" I asked.    Inspector Gatton walked across to the chair and threw the bag open.  First he took out several lumps of wet coal.    \"To weight it, of course,\" he said.    Then one by one he withdrew from the clammy interior a series of  ragged garments, the garments of a tramp. A pair of heavy boots there  were, a pair of patched trousers and an old shabby coat, a greasy cap,  and finally a threadbare red muffler!    Gatton looked hard at me.    \"He will have to break his obstinate silence now,\" he said. \"Failing  our discovery of new clews pointing in another direction, this is  hanging evidence!\"    \"It is maddening!\" I cried. \"Can nothing be done, Gatton? Is there no  possible line of inquiry hitherto neglected which might lead to the  discovery of the truth? For whatever your own ideas may be, personally  I am certain that Coverly is innocent.\"    Gatton replaced the sodden garments one by one in the bag, frowning as  he did so, and:    \"It occurred to me this morning,\" he replied, \"that there _is_ one  inquiry which in justice to the suspected man and in order to round  off the investigation, should be instituted. I'm afraid Coverly will  have a bad time in the Coroner's court, but it is even possible that  something might be done before the inquest. Now--\"    He looked at me quizzically, and:    \"Knowing your keen personal interest in the case, I am going to make a  suggestion. It is probably going outside the intentions of the chief  in regard to your share of the inquiry, but I'll risk that. I  stipulate, however, that anything you learn is to be communicated  direct to me, not to the _Planet_. Is this arrangement consistent with  your journalistic conscience?\"    \"Quite,\" I said eagerly; \"my contributions to the _Planet_ are always  subject, of course, to your censorship. What is it that you propose I  should do?\"    \"This,\" said Gatton tersely; \"I should like to know under what  circumstances Mr. Roger Coverly died.\"    \"Roger Coverly?\" I echoed.    \"The son of Sir Burnham Coverly,\" continued Gatton, \"and therefore the  direct heir to the title. He died somewhere abroad about five or six  years ago, and as a result the late Sir Marcus inherited the baronetcy  on the death of his uncle, Sir Burnham. You will remember that the  man, Morris, spoke of the ill-feeling existing between Lady Burnham  Coverly and Sir Marcus, because of the premature death of her own son,  of course.\"    \"I follow you,\" I said eagerly. \"You suggest that I should go down to  Friar's Park and interview Lady Burnham Coverly?\"    \"Exactly,\" replied Gatton. \"It's very irregular, of course, but I know  you well enough to take my chance of a carpeting. I may send a C.I.D.  man down as well. I've too much to do in town to think of going  myself; but I will advise you of any such step.\"    The motive underlying Inspector Gatton's suggestion was perfectly  evident to me and I experienced a feeling of gratitude for the  humanity which directed it. I held out my hand, and:    \"Thanks, Gatton,\" I said; \"you can leave the matter in my care with  every confidence. I will start for Friar's Park to-day.\"    \"Good,\" replied Gatton. \"Let me give you a hint. Take a good pistol  with you!\"          CHAPTER XI    THE SCARRED MAN      It was towards the hour of seven in the evening that I reached the  Abbey Inn at Upper Crossleys, itself among the most hoary buildings of  the ancient village. It belonged to the days when white-clad brethren  from the once great monastery of Croix-de-lis had labored in the abbey  meadows and fished in the little stream which ran slowly through a  neighboring valley. Time had scarred it deeply and the balcony  overhanging the coachyard sagged in a rather alarming fashion as  though about to drop down from sheer old age.    The surrounding country had impressed me at first sight. There were  long billowing hills and vales, much of their surface densely wooded,  but with wide spaces under cultivation and even greater tracts of a  sort of heath-land very wild in aspect and conjuring up pictures of  outlaws' camps and the clash of battling feudal days. Hard by had  resided of old a warden of the marches, and the ruins of his stronghold  might still be seen on the crest of a near-by hill.    From the room allotted to me I could look out over a varied prospect  of farmland and heath, terminated by the woody slopes which everywhere  hemmed in the valley. Peeping above the outer fringe of trees showed  a tower of some old house whereof the rest was hidden by verdure.    Having partaken of a typical country dinner, the small number of  courses being amply compensated by their quantity, I lighted my pipe  and went down to the bar-parlor, being minded to learn something of  the neighborhood at first hand from any chance visitor who might serve  my purpose.    The landlord, a somewhat taciturn member of his class, sat behind the  bar, pipe in mouth, as I entered, and only one other man was in the  room. This was a gipsy-looking fellow, with a very wild eye, attired  in the manner of a game-keeper, and wearing leggings and a fur cap. A  sporting rifle stood in the corner beside him. The landlord nodded,  and the other gave me a \"Good evening\" as I entered, whereupon I  determined to try the game-keeper as the more likely source of  information, and:    \"Is the shooting good hereabouts?\" I asked, by way of opening a  conversation.    My inquiry seemed hugely to amuse the man.    \"None better,\" was the reply; \"it's thick with game, sir, it is for  sure--and nobody to profit, only\"--he winked at the landlord--\"young  Jim Corder!\"    The landlord emitted a deep grunt which was evidently recognized by  the other as a laugh; for he himself laughed in a wild and not wholly  pleasant manner, whereby I concluded that \"young Jim Corder\" was a  standing joke in the neighborhood.    \"You look as though you knew a hare from a partridge,\" said I, \"so  I'll take your word for it.\"    This remark provoked a second and deeper growl from the landlord and a  further burst of outlandish laughter from my acquaintance, the  game-keeper. Presently:    \"Why, sir, if I tell you,\" declared the latter, \"them birds all know  me like I was their father, they do. I says, 'Good morning' regular  and them birds all bows to me, they does.\"    When the laughter had subsided, scenting possible information:    \"I gather,\" said I, \"that you get few shooting-parties nowadays?\"    Gloom descended upon both my gossips.    \"You're right, you are, sir,\" replied the game-keeper. \"He's right,  ain't he, Martin?\"    Martin, the landlord, growled. It occurred to me that he regarded the  other with a certain disfavor.    \"This 'ere country,\" continued the game-keeper, vaguely waving his arm  around, \"is a blighted spot. A blighted spot, ain't it, Martin?\"    Martin growled, whilst the game-keeper studied him covertly.    \"Since Sir Burnham went to his long rest these 'ere parts ain't knowed  themselves. I'm tellin' you, sir. Ain't knowed 'emselves. It's all  that quiet, winter and summer alike. The Park all shut up; and the  Park _was_ the Park in them days--warn't it, Martin?\"    Martin achieved speech; he removed his pipe, and:    \"It were, Hawkins,\" he concurred.    Silence fell for a minute or two. My new acquaintance, Hawkins, and  Martin both seemed to be pondering upon the degeneracy of Upper  Crossleys, and I could mot help thinking that Hawkins took a secret  delight in it. Then:    \"Surely the Park is still occupied by Lady Coverly?\" I asked.    \"Aye,\" Hawkins nodded. \"She's kep' me on, me and the missus, she has,  like the real lady she is. But things is different; things is wrong.  Ain't they, Martin?\" he asked, with a mischievous glance at the stolid  host.    \"Things is,\" agreed Martin.    \"Best part of Park be shut up,\" declared Hawkins. \"Horses gone,  carriages gone, everybody gone; only me and my old woman.\"    \"There must be house servants,\" I interjected.    \"My old woman!\" cried Hawkins triumphantly; \"same as I'm tellin' you!\"    \"You mean that Lady Coverly lives alone in the place with only--er,  Mrs. Hawkins to look after her?\"    It was Martin the landlord who answered my question.    \"Things ain't right,\" he observed, and returned to his mouth the pipe  which he had removed for the purpose of addressing me.    \"You don't know half of it,\" declared Hawkins. \"What's _my_ job, for  instance? I ask you--what is it?\"    Having thus spoken, he exchanged a significant look with the landlord  and relapsed into silence. Even my offer to replenish his tankard,  although it was accepted, did not result in any further confidences.  Prospects of crops and fruit were briefly touched upon, but that  exchange of glances between mine host and Hawkins seemed to have been  mutually understood to mean that the conversation touching Friar's  Park had proceeded far enough.    It was very mystifying, and naturally it served only to pique my  curiosity. A certain quality of loneliness which had seemed to belong  to the village, even in the brightness of the summer evening, now  asserted itself potently.
