His companion  Magohachi, seeing him fall, was in great anxiety; for should any harm  happen to Kazuma, what excuse could he make to Matayemon? So, wounded  as he was, he too engaged Takenouchi Gentan, and, being crippled by  the gashes he had received, was in deadly peril. Then the man who had  come up from the castle-town to act as Matayemon's second cried out--    \"See there, Sir Matayemon, your follower who is fighting with Gentan  is in great danger. Do you go to his rescue, and second Sir Kazuma: I  will give an account of the others!\"    \"Great thanks to you, sir. I will go and second Kazuma.\"    So Matayemon went to help Kazuma, whilst his second and the infantry  soldiers kept back the surviving Ronins, who, already wearied by their  fight with Matayemon, were unfit for any further exertion. Kazuma  meanwhile was still fighting with Matagoro, and the issue of the  conflict was doubtful; and Takenouchi Gentan, in his attempt to rescue  Matagoro, was being kept at bay by Magohachi, who, weakened by his  wounds, and blinded by the blood which was streaming into his eyes  from a cut in the forehead, had given himself up for lost when  Matayemon came and cried--    \"Be of good cheer, Magohachi; it is I, Matayemon, who have come to the  rescue. You are badly hurt; get out of harm's way, and rest yourself.\"    Then Magohachi, who until then had been kept up by his anxiety for  Kazuma's safety, gave in, and fell fainting from loss of blood; and  Matayemon worsted and slew Gentan; and even then, although be had  received two wounds, he was not exhausted, but drew near to Kazuma and  said--    \"Courage, Kazuma! The Ronins are all killed, and there now remains  only Matagoro, your father's murderer. Fight and win!\"    The youth, thus encouraged, redoubled his efforts; but Matagoro,  losing heart, quailed and fell. So Kazuma's vengeance was fulfilled,  and the desire of his heart was accomplished.    The two faithful retainers, who had died in their loyalty, were buried  with great ceremony, and Kazuma carried the head of Matagoro and  piously laid it upon his father's tomb.    So ends the tale of Kazuma's revenge.    I fear that stories of which killing and bloodshed form the principal  features can hardly enlist much sympathy in these peaceful days.  Still, when such tales are based upon history, they are interesting to  students of social phenomena. The story of Kazuma's revenge is mixed  up with events which at the present time are peculiarly significant: I  mean the feud between the great Daimios and the Hatamotos. Those who  have followed the modern history of Japan will see that the recent  struggle, which has ended in the ruin of the Tycoon's power and the  abolition of his office, was the outburst of a hidden fire which had  been smouldering for centuries. But the repressive might had been  gradually weakened, and contact with Western powers had rendered still  more odious a feudality which men felt to be out of date. The  revolution which has ended in the triumph of the Daimios over the  Tycoon, is also the triumph of the vassal over his feudal lord, and is  the harbinger of political life to the people at large. In the time of  Iyeyasu the burden might be hateful, but it had to be borne; and so it  would have been to this day, had not circumstances from without broken  the spell. The Japanese Daimio, in advocating the isolation of his  country, was hugging the very yoke which he hated. Strange to say,  however, there are still men who, while they embrace the new political  creed, yet praise the past, and look back with regret upon the day  when Japan stood alone, without part or share in the great family of  nations.    NOTE.--_Hatamoto_. This word means \"_under the flag_.\" The Hatamotos  were men who, as their name implied, rallied round the standard of the  Shogun, or Tycoon, in war-time. They were eighty thousand in number.  When Iyeyasu left the Province of Mikawa and became Shogun, the  retainers whom he ennobled, and who received from him grants of land  yielding revenue to the amount of ten thousand kokus of rice a year,  and from that down to one hundred kokus, were called _Hatamoto_. In  return for these grants of land, the Hatamotos had in war-time to  furnish a contingent of soldiers in proportion to their revenue. For  every thousand kokus of rice five men were required. Those Hatamotos  whose revenue fell short of a thousand kokus substituted a quota of  money. In time of peace most of the minor offices of the Tycoon's  government were filled by Hatamotos, the more important places being  held by the Fudai, or vassal Daimios of the Shogun. Seven years ago,  in imitation of the customs of foreign nations, a standing army was  founded; and then the Hatamotos had to contribute their quota of men  or of money, whether the country were at peace or at war. When the  Shogun was reduced in 1868 to the rank of a simple Daimio, his revenue  of eight million kokus reverted to the Government, with the exception  of seven hundred thousand kokus. The title of Hatamoto exists no more,  and those who until a few months ago held the rank are for the most  part ruined or dispersed. From having been perhaps the proudest and  most overbearing class in Japan, they are driven to the utmost straits  of poverty. Some have gone into trade, with the heirlooms of their  families as their stock; others are wandering through the country as  Ronins; while a small minority have been allowed to follow the fallen  fortunes of their master's family, the present chief of which is known  as the Prince of Tokugawa. Thus are the eighty thousand dispersed.    The koku of rice, in which all revenue is calculated, is of varying  value. At the cheapest it is worth rather more than a pound sterling,  and sometimes almost three times as much. The salaries of officials  being paid in rice, it follows that there is a large and influential  class throughout the country who are interested in keeping up the  price of the staple article of food. Hence the opposition with which a  free trade in rice has met, even in famine times. Hence also the  frequent so-called \"Rice Riots.\"    The amounts at which the lands formerly held by the chief Daimios, but  now patriotically given up by them to the Mikado, were assessed, sound  fabulous. The Prince of Kaga alone had an income of more than one  million two hundred thousand kokus. Yet these great proprietors were,  latterly at least, embarrassed men. They had many thousand mouths to  feed, and were mulcted of their dues right and left; while their mania  for buying foreign ships and munitions of war, often at exorbitant  prices, had plunged them heavily in debt.          A STORY OF THE OTOKODATE OF YEDO;      BEING THE SUPPLEMENT OF    THE STORY OF GOMPACHI AND KOMURASAKI      The word Otokodate occurs several times in these Tales; and as I  cannot convey its full meaning by a simple translation, I must  preserve it in the text, explaining it by the following note, taken  from the Japanese of a native scholar.    The Otokodate were friendly associations of brave men bound together  by an obligation to stand by one another in weal or in woe, regardless  of their own lives, and without inquiring into one another's  antecedents. A bad man, however, having joined the Otokodate must  forsake his evil ways; for their principle was to treat the oppressor  as an enemy, and to help the feeble as a father does his child. If  they had money, they gave it to those that had none, and their  charitable deeds won for them the respect of all men. The head of the  society was called its \"Father\"; if any of the others, who were his  apprentices, were homeless, they lived with the Father and served him,  paying him at the same time a small fee, in consideration of which, if  they fell sick or into misfortune, he took charge of them and assisted  them.    The Father of the Otokodate pursued the calling of farming out coolies  to the Daimios and great personages for their journeys to and from  Yedo, and in return for this received from them rations in rice. He  had more influence with the lower classes even than the officials; and  if the coolies had struck work or refused to accompany a Daimio on his  journey, a word from the Father would produce as many men as might be  required. When Prince Tokugawa Iyemochi, the last but one of the  Shoguns, left Yedo for Kioto, one Shimmon Tatsugoro, chief of the  Otokodate, undertook the management of his journey, and some three or  four years ago was raised to the dignity of Hatamoto for many faithful  services. After the battle of Fushimi, and the abolition of the  Shogunate, he accompanied the last of the Shoguns in his retirement.    In old days there were also Otokodate among the Hatamotos; this was  after the civil wars of the time of Iyeyasu, when, though the country  was at peace, the minds of men were still in a state of high  excitement, and could not be reconciled to the dulness of a state of  rest; it followed that broils and faction fights were continually  taking place among the young men of the Samurai class, and that those  who distinguished themselves by their personal strength and valour  were looked up to as captains. Leagues after the manner of those  existing among the German students were formed in different quarters  of the city, under various names, and used to fight for the honour of  victory. When the country became more thoroughly tranquil, the custom  of forming these leagues amongst gentlemen fell into disuse.    The past tense is used in speaking even of the Otokodate of the lower  classes; for although they nominally exist, they have no longer the  power and importance which they enjoyed at the time to which these  stories belong. They then, like the 'prentices of Old London, played a  considerable part in the society of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1302"],[0,"The Enemies of Books (#15)"],[1,"of, 126.
