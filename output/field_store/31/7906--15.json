Summerlee rejoined,  however, with a sour smile, by saying that he understood that Millbank  Prison had been pulled down.  Challenger's conceit is too colossal to  allow him to be really annoyed.  He only smiled in his beard and  repeated \"Really!  Really!\" in the pitying tone one would use to a  child.  Indeed, they are children both--the one wizened and  cantankerous, the other formidable and overbearing, yet each with a  brain which has put him in the front rank of his scientific age.  Brain, character, soul--only as one sees more of life does one  understand how distinct is each.    The very next day we did actually make our start upon this remarkable  expedition.  We found that all our possessions fitted very easily into  the two canoes, and we divided our personnel, six in each, taking the  obvious precaution in the interests of peace of putting one Professor  into each canoe.  Personally, I was with Challenger, who was in a  beatific humor, moving about as one in a silent ecstasy and beaming  benevolence from every feature.  I have had some experience of him in  other moods, however, and shall be the less surprised when the  thunderstorms suddenly come up amidst the sunshine.  If it is  impossible to be at your ease, it is equally impossible to be dull in  his company, for one is always in a state of half-tremulous doubt as to  what sudden turn his formidable temper may take.    For two days we made our way up a good-sized river some hundreds of  yards broad, and dark in color, but transparent, so that one could  usually see the bottom.  The affluents of the Amazon are, half of them,  of this nature, while the other half are whitish and opaque, the  difference depending upon the class of country through which they have  flowed.  The dark indicate vegetable decay, while the others point to  clayey soil.  Twice we came across rapids, and in each case made a  portage of half a mile or so to avoid them.  The woods on either side  were primeval, which are more easily penetrated than woods of the  second growth, and we had no great difficulty in carrying our canoes  through them.  How shall I ever forget the solemn mystery of it?  The  height of the trees and the thickness of the boles exceeded anything  which I in my town-bred life could have imagined, shooting upwards in  magnificent columns until, at an enormous distance above our heads, we  could dimly discern the spot where they threw out their side-branches  into Gothic upward curves which coalesced to form one great matted roof  of verdure, through which only an occasional golden ray of sunshine  shot downwards to trace a thin dazzling line of light amidst the  majestic obscurity.  As we walked noiselessly amid the thick, soft  carpet of decaying vegetation the hush fell upon our souls which comes  upon us in the twilight of the Abbey, and even Professor Challenger's  full-chested notes sank into a whisper.  Alone, I should have been  ignorant of the names of these giant growths, but our men of science  pointed out the cedars, the great silk cotton trees, and the redwood  trees, with all that profusion of various plants which has made this  continent the chief supplier to the human race of those gifts of Nature  which depend upon the vegetable world, while it is the most backward in  those products which come from animal life.  Vivid orchids and  wonderful colored lichens smoldered upon the swarthy tree-trunks and  where a wandering shaft of light fell full upon the golden allamanda,  the scarlet star-clusters of the tacsonia, or the rich deep blue of  ipomaea, the effect was as a dream of fairyland.  In these great wastes  of forest, life, which abhors darkness, struggles ever upwards to the  light.  Every plant, even the smaller ones, curls and writhes to the  green surface, twining itself round its stronger and taller brethren in  the effort.  Climbing plants are monstrous and luxuriant, but others  which have never been known to climb elsewhere learn the art as an  escape from that somber shadow, so that the common nettle, the jasmine,  and even the jacitara palm tree can be seen circling the stems of the  cedars and striving to reach their crowns.  Of animal life there was no  movement amid the majestic vaulted aisles which stretched from us as we  walked, but a constant movement far above our heads told of that  multitudinous world of snake and monkey, bird and sloth, which lived in  the sunshine, and looked down in wonder at our tiny, dark, stumbling  figures in the obscure depths immeasurably below them.  At dawn and at  sunset the howler monkeys screamed together and the parrakeets broke  into shrill chatter, but during the hot hours of the day only the full  drone of insects, like the beat of a distant surf, filled the ear,  while nothing moved amid the solemn vistas of stupendous trunks, fading  away into the darkness which held us in.  Once some bandy-legged,  lurching creature, an ant-eater or a bear, scuttled clumsily amid the  shadows.  It was the only sign of earth life which I saw in this great  Amazonian forest.    And yet there were indications that even human life itself was not far  from us in those mysterious recesses.  On the third day out we were  aware of a singular deep throbbing in the air, rhythmic and solemn,  coming and going fitfully throughout the morning.  The two boats were  paddling within a few yards of each other when first we heard it, and  our Indians remained motionless, as if they had been turned to bronze,  listening intently with expressions of terror upon their faces.    \"What is it, then?\" I asked.    \"Drums,\" said Lord John, carelessly; \"war drums.  I have heard them  before.\"    \"Yes, sir, war drums,\" said Gomez, the half-breed.  \"Wild Indians,  bravos, not mansos; they watch us every mile of the way; kill us if  they can.\"    \"How can they watch us?\" I asked, gazing into the dark, motionless void.    The half-breed shrugged his broad shoulders.    \"The Indians know.  They have their own way.  They watch us.  They talk  the drum talk to each other.  Kill us if they can.\"    By the afternoon of that day--my pocket diary shows me that it was  Tuesday, August 18th--at least six or seven drums were throbbing from  various points.  Sometimes they beat quickly, sometimes slowly,  sometimes in obvious question and answer, one far to the east breaking  out in a high staccato rattle, and being followed after a pause by a  deep roll from the north.  There was something indescribably  nerve-shaking and menacing in that constant mutter, which seemed to  shape itself into the very syllables of the half-breed, endlessly  repeated, \"We will kill you if we can.  We will kill you if we can.\"  No one ever moved in the silent woods.  All the peace and soothing of  quiet Nature lay in that dark curtain of vegetation, but away from  behind there came ever the one message from our fellow-man.  \"We will  kill you if we can,\" said the men in the east.  \"We will kill you if we  can,\" said the men in the north.    All day the drums rumbled and whispered, while their menace reflected  itself in the faces of our colored companions.  Even the hardy,  swaggering half-breed seemed cowed.  I learned, however, that day once  for all that both Summerlee and Challenger possessed that highest type  of bravery, the bravery of the scientific mind.  Theirs was the spirit  which upheld Darwin among the gauchos of the Argentine or Wallace among  the head-hunters of Malaya.  It is decreed by a merciful Nature that  the human brain cannot think of two things simultaneously, so that if  it be steeped in curiosity as to science it has no room for merely  personal considerations.  All day amid that incessant and mysterious  menace our two Professors watched every bird upon the wing, and every  shrub upon the bank, with many a sharp wordy contention, when the snarl  of Summerlee came quick upon the deep growl of Challenger, but with no  more sense of danger and no more reference to drum-beating Indians than  if they were seated together in the smoking-room of the Royal Society's  Club in St.  James's Street.  Once only did they condescend to discuss  them.    \"Miranha or Amajuaca cannibals,\" said Challenger, jerking his thumb  towards the reverberating wood.    \"No doubt, sir,\" Summerlee answered.  \"Like all such tribes, I shall  expect to find them of poly-synthetic speech and of Mongolian type.\"    \"Polysynthetic certainly,\" said Challenger, indulgently.  \"I am not  aware that any other type of language exists in this continent, and I  have notes of more than a hundred.  The Mongolian theory I regard with  deep suspicion.\"    \"I should have thought that even a limited knowledge of comparative  anatomy would have helped to verify it,\" said Summerlee, bitterly.    Challenger thrust out his aggressive chin until he was all beard and  hat-rim.  \"No doubt, sir, a limited knowledge would have that effect.  When one's knowledge is exhaustive, one comes to other conclusions.\"  They glared at each other in mutual defiance, while all round rose the  distant whisper, \"We will kill you--we will kill you if we can.\"    That night we moored our canoes with heavy stones for anchors in the  center of the stream, and made every preparation for a possible attack.  Nothing came, however, and with the dawn we pushed upon our way, the  drum-beating dying out behind us.  About three o'clock in the afternoon  we came to a very steep rapid, more than a mile long--the very one in  which Professor Challenger had suffered disaster upon his first  journey.  I confess that the sight of it consoled me, for it was really  the first direct corroboration, slight as it was, of the truth of his  story.  The Indians carried first our canoes and then our stores  through the brushwood, which is very thick at this point, while we four  whites, our rifles on our shoulders, walked between "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1390"],[0,"The Jimmyjohn Boss, and Other Stories (#15)"],[1,"to such accidents. The flags and the bunting hung gay around  the draped stage. While the audience rustled or resoundingly trod to  its chairs, and seated neighbors conferred solemnly together over the  programme, Stuart, behind the bunting, played \"Silver Threads among the  Gold\" upon a melodeon.    \"Pretty good this,\" he said to me, pumping his feet.    \"What?\" I said.    \"Tune. Sharon is for free silver.\"    \"Do you think they will catch your allusion?\" I asked him.    \"No. But I have a way of enjoying a thing by myself.\" And he pumped  away, playing with tasteful variations until the hall was full and the  singing-class assembled in gloves and ribbons.    They opened the ceremonies for us by rendering \"Sweet and Low\" very  happily; and I trusted it was an omen.    Sharon was hearty, and we had \"Sweet and Low\" twice. Then the speaking  began, and the speakers were welcomed, coming and going, with mild and  friendly demonstrations. Nothing that one would especially mark went  wrong until Reuben Gadsden. He strode to the middle of the boards, and  they creaked beneath his tread. He stood a moment in large glittering  boots and with hair flat and prominently watered. As he straightened  from his bow his suspender-buttons came into view, and remained so for  some singular internal reason, while he sent his right hand down into  the nearest pocket and began his oratory.    \"It is sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of France,\" he  said, impressively, and stopped.    We waited, and presently he resumed:    \"It is sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of France.\" He  took the right hand out and put the left hand in.    \"It is sixteen or seventeen years,\" said he, and stared frowning at his  boots.    I found the silence was getting on my nerves. I felt as if it were  myself who was drifting to idiocy, and tremulous empty sensations began  to occur in my stomach. Had I been able to recall the next sentence, I  should have prompted him.    \"It is sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of France,\" said  the orator, rapidly.    And down deep back among the men came a voice, \"Well, I guess it must  be, Reub.\"    This snapped the tension. I saw Reuben's boots march away; Mr. Eastman  came from behind the bunting and spoke (I suppose) words of protest. I  could not hear them, but in a minute, or perhaps two, we grew calm, and  the speaking continued.    There was no question what they thought of Guy and Leola. He conquered  the back of the room. They called his name, they blessed him with  endearing audible oaths, and even the ladies smiled at his pleasant,  honest face--the ladies, except Mrs. Mattern. She sat near Mrs.  Jeffries, and throughout Guy's \"Blue-Jay\" fanned herself, exhibiting a  well-sustained inattention. She might have foreseen that Mrs. Jeffries  would have her turn. When the \"Death of Paul Dombey\" came, and  handkerchiefs began to twinkle out among the audience, and various  noises of grief were rising around us, and the men themselves murmured  in sympathy, Mrs. Jeffries not only preserved a suppressed-hilarity  countenance, but managed to cough twice with a cough that visibly bit  into Mrs. Mattern's soul.    But Leola's appealing cadences moved me also. When Paul was dead,  she made her pretty little bow, and we sat spellbound, then gave her  applause surpassing Guy's. Unexpectedly I found embarrassment of choice  dazing me, and I sat without attending to the later speakers. Was not  successful humor more difficult than pathos? Were not tears more cheaply  raised than laughter? Yet, on the other hand, Guy had one prize, and  where merit was so even--I sat, I say, forgetful of the rest of the  speakers, when suddenly I was aware of louder shouts of welcome, and I  awaked to Josey Yeatts bowing at us.    \"Spit it out, Josey!\" a large encouraging voice was crying in the back  of the hall. \"We'll see you through.\"    \"Don't be scared, Josey!\" yelled another.    Then Josey opened his mouth and rhythmically rattled the following:    \"I love little pussy her coat is so warm And if I don't hurt her she'll  do me no harm I'll sit by the fi-yer and give her some food And pussy  will love me because I am good.\"    That was all. It had come without falter or pause, even for breath.  Josey stood, and the room rose to him.    \"Again! again!\" they roared. \"He ain't a bit scared!\" \"Go it, Josey!\"  \"You don't forgit yer piece!\" And a great deal more, while they pounded  with their boots.    \"I love little pussy,\" began Josey.    \"Poor darling!\" said a lady next me. \"No mother.\"    \"I'll sit by the fi-yer.\"    Josey was continuing. But nobody heard him finish. The room was a Babel.    \"Look at his little hand!\" \"Only three fingers inside them rags!\"  \"Nobody to mend his clothes any more.\" They all talked to each other,  and clapped and cheered, while Josey stood, one leg slightly advanced  and proudly stiff, somewhat after the manner of those military  engravings where some general is seen erect upon an eminence at the  moment of victory.    Mr. Eastman again appeared from the bunting, and was telling us, I have  no doubt, something of importance; but the giant barkeeper now shouted  above the din, \"Who says Josey Yeatts ain't the speaker for this night?\"    At that striking of the common chord I saw them heave, promiscuous and  unanimous, up the steps to the stage. Josey was set upon Abe Hanson's  shoulder, while ladies wept around him. What the literary committee  might have done I do not know, for we had not the time even to resign.  Guy and Leola now appeared, bearing the prize between them--a picture of  Washington handing the Bible out of clouds to Abraham Lincoln--and very  immediately I found myself part of a procession. Men and women we were,  marching about Sharon. The barkeeper led; four of Sharon's fathers  followed him, escorting Josey borne aloft on Abe Hanson's shoulder,  and rigid and military in his bearing. Leola and Guy followed with the  picture; Stuart walked with me, whistling melodies of the war--Dixie  and others. Eastman was not with us. When the ladies found themselves  conducted to the saloon, they discreetly withdrew back to the  entertainment we had broken out from. Josey saw them go, and shrilly  spoke his first word:    \"Ain't I going to have any ice-cream?\"    This presently caused us to return to the ladies, and we finished the  evening with entire unity of sentiment. Eastman alone took the incident  to heart; inquired how he was to accomplish anything with hands tied,  and murmured his constant burden once more: \"One is not appreciated, not  appreciated.\"    I do not stop over in Sharon any more. My ranch friend, whose presence  there brought me to visit him, is gone away. But such was my virgin  experience of the place; and in later days fate led me to be concerned  with two more local competitions--one military and one civil--which  greatly stirred the population. So that I never pass Sharon on my long  travels without affectionately surveying the sandy, quivering, bleached  town, unshaded by its twinkling forest of wind-wheels. Surely the heart  always remembers a spot where it has been merry! And one thing I should  like to know--shall know, perhaps: what sort of citizen in our republic  Josey will grow to be. For whom will he vote? May he not himself come to  sit in Washington and make laws for us? Universal suffrage holds so many  possibilities.          Napoleon Shave-Tail      Augustus Albumblatt, young and new and sleek with the latest  book-knowledge of war, reported to his first troop commander at Fort  Brown. The ladies had watched for him, because he would increase the  number of men, the officers because he would lessen the number of  duties; and he joined at a crisis favorable to becoming speedily known  by them all. Upon that same day had household servants become an  extinct race. The last one, the commanding officer's cook, had told the  commanding officer's wife that she was used to living where she could  see the cars. She added that there was no society here \"fit for man or  baste at all.\" This opinion was formed on the preceding afternoon when  Casey, a sergeant of roguish attractions in G troop, had told her that  he was not a marrying man. Three hours later she wedded a gambler,  and this morning at six they had taken the stage for Green River, two  hundred miles south, the nearest point where the bride could see the  cars.    \"Frank,\" said the commanding officer's wife, \"send over to H troop for  York.\"    \"Catherine,\" he answered, \"my dear, our statesmen at Washington say  it's wicked to hire the free American soldier to cook for you. It's too  menial for his manhood.\"    \"Frank, stuff!\"    \"Hush, my love. Therefore York must be spared the insult of twenty  more dollars a month, our statesmen must be re-elected, and you and I,  Catherine, being cookless, must join the general mess.\"    Thus did all separate housekeeping end, and the garrison began unitedly  to eat three times a day what a Chinaman set before them, when the  long-expected Albumblatt stepped into their midst, just in time for  supper.    This youth was spic-and-span from the Military Academy, with a  top-dressing of three months' thoughtful travel in Germany. \"I was  deeply impressed with the modernity of their scientific attitude,\" he  pleasantly remarked to the commanding officer. For Captain Duane, silent  usually, talked at this first meal to make the boy welcome in this  forlorn two-company post.    \"We're cut off from all that sort of thing here,\" said he. \"I've not  been east of the Missouri since '69. But we've got the railroad across,  and we've killed some Indians, and we've had some fun, and we're glad  we're alive--eh, Mrs. Starr?\"    \"I should think so,\" said the lady.    \"Especially now we've got a bachelor at the post!\" said Mrs. Bainbridge.  \"That has been the one drawback, Mr. Albumblatt.\"    \"I thank you for the compliment,\" said"]]]
