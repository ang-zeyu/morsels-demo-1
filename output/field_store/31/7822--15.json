So he went and discharged the boor that  waited and packed up all his plunder, and came up to me in his old  clothes again. \"How now, captain,\" says I, \"what, have you altered  your equipage already?\" \"I am no more ashamed, sir, of your livery,\"  answered he, \"than of your service, and nevertheless your servant for  what I have got by it.\" \"Well,\" says I to him, \"but what will you do  now with all your money?\" \"I wish my poor father had some of it,\" says  he, \"and for the rest I got it for you, sir, and desire you would take  it.\" He spoke it with so much honesty and freedom that I could not  but take it very kindly; but, however, I told him I would not take a  farthing from him as his master, but I would have him play the good  husband with it, now he had such good fortune to get it. He told me  he would take my directions in everything. \"Why, then,\" said I, \"I'll  tell you what I would advise you to do, turn it all into ready money,  and convey it by return home into England, and follow yourself the  first opportunity, and with good management you may put yourself in a  good posture of living with it.\" The fellow, with a sort of dejection  in his looks, asked me if he had disobliged me in anything? \"Why?\"  says I. \"That I was willing to turn him out of his service.\" \"No,  George\" (that was his name), says I, \"but you may live on this money  without being a servant.\" \"I'd throw it all into the Elbe,\" says he,  \"over Torgau bridge, rather than leave your service; and besides,\"  says he, \"can't I save my money without going from you? I got it in  your service, and I'll never spend it out of your service, unless you  put me away. I hope my money won't make me the worse servant; if I  thought it would, I'd soon have little enough.\" \"Nay, George,\" says  I, \"I shall not oblige you to it, for I am not willing to lose you  neither: come, then,\" says I, \"let us put it all together, and see  what it will come to.\" So he laid it all together on the table, and by  our computation he had gotten as much plunder as was worth about 1400  rix-dollars, besides three horses with their furniture, a tent, a bed,  and some wearing linen. Then he takes the necklace of pearl, a very  good watch, a diamond ring, and 100 pieces of gold, and lays them by  themselves, and having, according to our best calculation, valued the  things, he put up all the rest, and as I was going to ask him what  they were left out for, he takes them up in his hand, and coming round  the table, told me, that if I did not think him unworthy of my service  and favour, he begged I would give him leave to make that present to  me; that it was my first thought his going out, that he had got it  all in my service, and he should think I had no kindness for him if I  should refuse it.    I was resolved in my mind not to take it from him, and yet I could  find no means to resist his importunity. At last I told him, I would  accept of part of his present, and that I esteemed his respect in  that as much as the whole, and that I would not have him importune me  farther; so I took the ring and watch, with the horse and furniture as  before, and made him turn all the rest into money at Leipsic, and  not suffering him to wear his livery, made him put himself into a  tolerable equipage, and taking a young Leipsicer into my service, he  attended me as a gentleman from that time forward.    The king's army never entered Leipsic, but proceeded to Merseberg, and  from thence to Halle, and so marched on into Franconia, while the Duke  of Saxony employed his forces in recovering Leipsic and driving the  Imperialists out of his country. I continued at Leipsic twelve days,  being not willing to leave my comrade till he was recovered; but Sir  John Hepburn so often importuned me to come into the army, and sent  me word that the king had very often inquired for me, that at last I  consented to go without him; so having made our appointment where to  meet, and how to correspond by letters, I went to wait on Sir John  Hepburn, who then lay with the king's army at the city of Erfurt in  Saxony. As I was riding between Leipsic and Halle, I observed my  horse went very awkwardly and uneasy, and sweat very much, though the  weather was cold, and we had rid but very softly; I fancied therefore  that the saddle might hurt the horse, and calls my new captain up.  \"George,\" says I, \"I believe this saddle hurts the horse.\" So we  alighted, and looking under the saddle found the back of the horse  extremely galled; so I bid him take off the saddle, which he did, and  giving the horse to my young Leipsicer to lead, we sat down to see if  we could mend it, for there was no town near us. Says George, pointing  with his finger, \"If you please to cut open the pannel there, I'll get  something to stuff into it which will bear it from the horse's back.\"  So while he looked for something to thrust in, I cut a hole in  the pannel of the saddle, and, following it with my finger, I felt  something hard, which seemed to move up and down. Again, as I thrust  it with my finger, \"Here's something that should not be here,\" says I,  not yet imagining what afterwards fell out, and calling, \"Run back,\"  bade him put up his finger. \"Whatever 'tis,\" says he, \"'tis this hurts  the horse, for it bears just on his back when the saddle is set on.\"  So we strove to take hold on it, but could not reach it; at last we  took the upper part of the saddle quite from the pannel, and there  lay a small silk purse wrapped in a piece of leather, and full of gold  ducats. \"Thou art born to be rich, George,\" says I to him, \"here's  more money.\" We opened the purse and found in it four hundred and  thirty-eight small pieces of gold.    There I had a new skirmish with him whose the money should be. I  told him 'twas his, he told me no; I had accepted of the horse and  furniture, and all that was about him was mine, and solemnly vowed he  would not have a penny of it. I saw no remedy, but put up the money  for the present, mended our saddle, and went on. We lay that night at  Halle, and having had such a booty in the saddle, I made him search  the saddles of the other two horses, in one of which we found three  French crowns, but nothing in the other.    We arrived at Erfurt the 28th of September, but the army was removed,  and entered into Franconia, and at the siege of Koningshoven we came  up with them. The first thing I did was to pay my civilities to Sir  John Hepburn, who received me very kindly, but told me withal that  I had not done well to be so long from him, and the king had  particularly inquired for me, had commanded him to bring me to him at  my return. I told him the reason of my stay at Leipsic, and how I had  left that place and my comrade, before he was cured of his wounds, to  wait on him according to his letters. He told me the king had spoken  some things very obliging about me, and he believed would offer me  some command in the army, if I thought well to accept of it. I told  him I had promised my father not to take service in an army without  his leave, and yet if his Majesty should offer it, I neither knew  how to resist it, nor had I an inclination to anything more than the  service, and such a leader, though I had much rather have served as a  volunteer at my own charge (which, as he knew, was the custom of our  English gentlemen) than in any command. He replied, \"Do as you think  fit; but some gentlemen would give 20,000 crowns to stand so fair for  advancement as you do.\"    The town of Koningshoven capitulated that day, and Sir John was  ordered to treat with the citizens, so I had no further discourse with  him then; and the town being taken, the army immediately advanced down  the river Maine, for the king had his eye upon Frankfort and Mentz,  two great cities, both which he soon became master of, chiefly by  the prodigious expedition of his march; for within a month after the  battle, he was in the lower parts of the empire, and had passed from  the Elbe to the Rhine, an incredible conquest, had taken all the  strong cities, the bishoprics of Bamberg, of Wurtzburg, and almost all  the circle of Franconia, with part of Schawberland--a conquest large  enough to be seven years a-making by the common course of arms.    Business going on thus, the king had not leisure to think of small  matters, and I being not thoroughly resolved in my mind, did not press  Sir John to introduce me. I had wrote to my father with an account  of my reception in the army, the civilities of Sir John Hepburn, the  particulars of the battle, and had indeed pressed him to give me  leave to serve the King of Sweden, to which particular I waited for  an answer, but the following occasion determined me before an answer  could possibly reach me.    The king was before the strong castle of Marienburg, which commands  the city of Wurtzburg. He had taken the city, but the garrison and  richer part of the burghers were retired into the castle, and trusting  to the strength of the place, which was thought impregnable, they bade  the Swedes do their worst; 'twas well provided with all things, and a  strong garrison in it, so that the army indeed expected 'twould be a  long piece of work. The castle stood on a high rock, and on the steep  of the rock was a bastion which defended the only passage up the hill  into the castle; the Scots were chose out to make this attack, and the  king was an eye-witness of their gallantry. In the action Sir John was  not commanded out, but Sir James Ramsey led them on; but I observed  that most of the Scotch officers in the other regiments prepared to  serve as volunteers for the honour of their countrymen, and Sir John  Hepburn led them on. I was resolved to see this piece of service,  and therefore joined myself to the volunteers. We were armed with  partisans, and each man two pistols at our belt.

In acute cases of hysteria it is better to wait for  a calmer period before applying psychoanalysis. In cases of nervous  prostration this manner of treatment, which demands the serious co-operation  and attention of the patient, which lasts a long time and at first takes no  notice of the continuance of the phenomena, is difficult.  This form of  psychotherapy places great demands on the physician's patience and  understanding. Psychoanalyses which last more than a year, are no rarity. It  cannot be applied to the seriously degenerated; to people who have passed  far beyond middle life, because among the last named the accumulated  material compasses too much; to those who are entangled in a state of great  fear and who live in deep depression. Analysis can be applied to the  neuroses of children.  It is desirable in those cases for the physician to  be supported by a trusted person, as for example a woman assistant, but  preferably by parents enlightened sufficiently to observe the spontaneous  remarks of the child, to make notes of them, and communicate them to the  physician. According to the experiments undertaken by the Zurich school, the  expectation is justified within certain limits, that psychoanalysis will be  therapeutically useful in certain forms of paranoia and dementia praecox.    I think that it will soon be said of psychoanalysis, as of so many other  systems which like it were decried and yet later were highly valued, that  the enemies of to-day are the friends of to-morrow.    Whoever wishes to judge Freud must take the trouble to initiate himself  seriously into his doctrines, and use his methods for a long time in  practice, according to his instructions.    Most of the condemnations are brought forward by investigators who judge a  priori, without acquaintance with the facts, upon uncertain theoretical  grounds and with prepossession against his sexual theory.    Whoever initiates himself seriously into the practice of psychoanalysis,  will arrive at the conclusion that this new form of psychical curing  deserves, to a great degree, the attention of the physician and that it may  be considered as an enrichment of the armory of the psychotherapy, not yet  sufficiently valued.    Does it render other forms of psychotherapy superfluous? There can be no  thought of that.    Taking the pros and cons given here, we see that each of the forms of  psychical therapy deserves in its turn preference, and that all support and  complement each other.    Jung, as well as Freud, both of whom have made their life's aim the  perfection of psychoanalysis, and who for that reason now concern themselves  exclusively with it, appreciate all forms of verbal treatment, as well with  hypnotism as without it. Hypnotic suggestion and suggestion given when awake  was used at an earlier period by both of them with good results, and they  still are not averse to using this method where quick comprehension and the  immediate subdual of a troublesome symptom is desired.    The psychoanalyst follows the longer road, and assails rather the root of  the sickness; it works more radically; hypnotic treatment takes hold quicker  and is directed at the symptoms.    Freud explains it in this manner:  when one treats the patient by hypnotic  suggestion, one introduces a new idea from outside in exchange for the  morbid idea; if psychoanalysis is applied, then one simply eliminates the  morbid idea. Within certain limits the modus agendi of the two methods is in  absolute opposition.    The suggestion method, substituting one idea for another, puts in something;  the analytical, expelling an idea, takes out something. Both aim at and  obtain the same end, a more or less lasting cure. Suggestion neutralizes,  stops the poison; analysis expels the harmful matter. The latter manner of  treatment is positive and the most decisive.    \"Don't we all analyze?\"  Bernheim inquires, and once more I agree that all  forms of psychotherapeutics do, but there is a difference in analysis.    Superficial analysis can bring us a long way toward the goal. In many cases  it may suffice.  But the profound, the Freudian analysis, is what we need if  we wish to attain the radical cure of psychoneurosis, as far as we can ever  speak of a radical cure. Many cases of illness do not lend themselves to  deep analysis.    When, because of the nature of the illness, or the lifetime, or the feeble  intelligence of the patient, or because of temporary circumstances of a  moral or material nature, its adaptation is excluded or impossible, it is  advisable, especially in chronic cases-- to take refuge in the more  palliative forms of the psychic methods of cure.    Thus the psychotherapeutic as moral leader fills the role of guide  (directeur-d'ames), one who helps along the doubter, encourages the toilers,  calms the frightened, arouses courage, keeps up hope and comforts where  comfort is needed.    Pierre Janet, in his instructive book (\"Obsessions et Idees Fixes\"),  observes that one of his chronic patients gave him the pet name of \"le  remonteur de pendules,\" an expression which luminously describes the role of  the physician of souls, who, tirelessly, day in, day out, lifts the burdens,  and for a time breathes new life into the depressed.    Hypnotic suggestion, which induces sleep, stills pain, silences fear,  abolishes functional disturbances, works chiefly palliatively. The place for  its application is where quick comprehension is desired. In its simplest  form it resembles the treatment of a mother, who soothes her child with  pacifying words and loving touch, and rocks him to sleep, and also it  resembles the behavior of the father, who asserts his authority by force and  breaks down the childish opposition.  We find hypnotic suggestion, perfected  and clothed in its scientific garment, in Liebeault's assertion: \"It is a  cure of authority, of faith, of confidence, a cure which frequently performs  semi-miracles. Respect on one side, sympathy on the other, is what gives the  hypnotiser results.\"    However highly we may value this last mentioned form of therapy, however  numerous the cures due to it may be, however indispensable it may be in the  practice of medicine, yet its splendor pales before the light which shines  forth from the cures which aim at reeducation and which are directed toward  the understanding. Those are the cures which make use of analysis.    One method, which we will call the superficial analytical method, is  directed exclusively toward the upper consciousness and cures principally  through exhorting, convincing, exercising and hardening. Its sponsors are  Bernheim, Rosenbach, P. E. Levy, Dubois.  At least it is true to its birth,  it has suggestion blood in its veins.    The other method is the deeper:  the Freudian analysis. This does not allow  itself to be satisfied with seeing only one side of the medal, it does not  limit its field of activity to the superliminal consciousness, in searching  for the causes of psychogenic illnesses, but it penetrates into the strata  which lie hidden under the threshold of the consciousness.    Where the moral and the suggestive methods of cure are limited exclusively  to symptomatic treatment, the first form of educative therapy, limited  merely to a superficial analysis, is only partly symptomatic, but the second  form of educative therapy penetrates with its deep-going analysis to the  root of the trouble, and has as its aim a fundamental cure.    Only too frequently the physician must be satisfied with the cure of the  symptoms, with lightening the load. He always strives to remove the cause.  Freud's great service is that he has opened before the physician a path  which leads to the cause.    These lines of Vondel's seem as if composed for him:     \"The physician must not only know  How high the pulse has mounted,  And  where the sickness lies, which makes him groan with pain,  But he must see  the cause, from where  The great weakness of this sickness came.\"        REVIEWS    AN ELEMENTARY STUDY OF THE BRAIN, BASED ON THE DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN OF  THE SHEEP.  By Eben W. Fiske, A.M., M.D. Illustrated with photographs and  diagrams by the author.  The Macmillan Company, New.  York, 1913.    The study of the brain is confessedly a difficult subject, and particularly  so for the elementary student. There is certainly no royal road to its  conquest, but this is an added reason why an introduction to its study  should be made as simple as the subject permits, and also as interesting.  Dr. Fiske has attempted this task in this book, which he entitles \"An  elementary study of the brain.\"  The brain of the sheep is chosen as the  basis of study because of its availability, its relative simplicity of  structure, and its essential similarity to that of man.  It appears to the  author, and we think with justice, that the subject should be approached  from a biological standpoint; hence, throughout the book, there is constant  reference to the evolution of nervous structure and to fundamental  conceptions of a biological character. Further than this, the relations of  cerebral anatomy and function, together with allied psychological  considerations, demand continual reference as a supplement to purely  anatomical considerations. The secret of exciting interest in any anatomical  study surely lies in a consideration of the function of the organ or  structure in relation to its anatomical form.  Bare descriptions cannot and  should not inspire interest, whereas the driest anatomical facts, if seen in  their broader relationships, at once assume a significance in the student's  mind which may be attained in no other way.    The first chapter is a brief statement of phylogeny, followed, as are  succeeding chapters, by directions to the student regarding means of study.  The second chapter concerns itself with ontogeny, and"]]]
