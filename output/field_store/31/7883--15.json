He forgets that these advantages are the result of long years of  unremitting and patient labour; that these things are the _crown_, not  the _first-fruits_ of the settler's toil; and that during the interval  many and great privations must be submitted to by almost every class of  emigrants.    Many persons, on first coming out, especially if they go back into any  of the unsettled townships, are dispirited by the unpromising appearance  of things about them. They find none of the advantages and comforts of  which they had heard and read, and they are unprepared for the present  difficulties; some give way to despondency, and others quit the place in  disgust.    [Illustration: Log-Village--Arrival of a Stage-coach]    A little reflection would have shown them that every rood of land must  be cleared of the thick forest of timber that encumbers it before an ear  of wheat can be grown; that, after the trees have been chopped, cut into  lengths, drawn together, or _logged_, as we call it, and burned, the  field must be fenced, the seed sown, harvested, and thrashed before any  returns can be obtained; that this requires time and much labour, and,  if hired labour, considerable outlay of ready money; and in the mean  time a family must eat. If at a distance from a store, every article  must be brought through bad roads either by hand or with a team, the  hire of which is generally costly in proportion to the distance and  difficulty to be encountered in the conveyance. Now these things are  better known beforehand, and then people are aware what they have to  encounter.    Even a labouring man, though he have land of his own, is often, I may  say generally, obliged to _hire out_ to work for the first year or two,  to earn sufficient for the maintenance of his family; and even so many  of them suffer much privation before they reap the benefit of their  independence. Were it not for the hope and the certain prospect of  bettering their condition ultimately, they would sink under what they  have to endure; but this thought buoys them up. They do not fear an old  age of want and pauperism; the present evils must yield to industry and  perseverance; they think also for their children; and the trials of the  present time are lost in pleasing anticipations for the future.    \"Surely,\" said I, \"cows and pigs and poultry might be kept; and you know  where there is plenty of milk, butter, cheese, and eggs, with pork and  fowls, persons cannot be very badly off for food.\"    \"Very true,\" replied my friend; \"but I must tell you it is easier to  talk of these things at first than to keep them, unless on cleared or  partially cleared farms; but we are speaking of a _first_ settlement in  the backwoods. Cows, pigs, and fowls must eat, and if you have nothing  to give them unless you purchase it, and perhaps have to bring it from  some distance, you had better not be troubled with them, as the trouble  is certain and the profit doubtful. A cow, it is true, will get her  living during the open months of the year in the bush, but sometimes she  will ramble away for days together, and then you lose the use of her,  and possibly much time in seeking her; then in the winter she requires  some additional food to the _browse_* that she gets during the chopping  season, or ten to one but she dies before spring; and as cows generally  lose their milk during the cold weather, if not very well kept, it is  best to part with them in the fall and buy again in the spring, unless  you have plenty of food for them, which is not often the case the first  winter. As to pigs they are great plagues on a newly cleared farm if you  cannot fat them off-hand; and that you cannot do without you buy food  for them, which does not answer to do at first. If they run loose they  are a terrible annoyance both to your own crops and your neighbours if  you happen to be within half a mile of one; for though you may fence out  cattle you cannot pigs: even poultry require something more than they  pick up about the dwelling to be of any service to you, and are often  taken off by hawks, eagles, foxes, and pole-cats, till you have proper  securities for them.\"    [* The cattle are supported in a great measure during the fall and  winter by eating the tender shoots of the maple, beech and bass, which  they seek in the newly-chopped fallow; but they should likewise be  allowed straw or other food, or they will die in the very hard weather.]    \"Then how are we to spin our own wool and make our own soap and  candles?\" said I. \"When you are able to kill your own sheep, and hogs,  and oxen, unless you buy wool and tallow\"--then, seeing me begin to look  somewhat disappointed, he said, \"Be not cast down, you will have all  these things in time, and more than these, never fear, if you have  patience, and use the means of obtaining them. In the mean while prepare  your mind for many privations to which at present you are a stranger;  and if you would desire to see your husband happy and prosperous, be  content to use economy, and above all, be cheerful. In a few years the  farm will supply you with all the necessaries of life, and by and by you  may even enjoy many of the luxuries. Then it is that a settler begins to  taste the real and solid advantages of his emigration; then he feels the  blessings of a country where there are no taxes, tithes, nor poor-rates;  then he truly feels the benefit of independence. It is looking forward  to this happy fulfillment of his desires that makes the rough paths  smooth, and lightens the burden of present ills. He looks round upon a  numerous family without those anxious fears that beset a father in  moderate circumstances at home; for he knows he does not leave them  destitute of an honest means of support.\"    In spite of all the trials he had encountered, I found this gentleman  was so much attached to a settler's life, that he declared he would not  go back to his own country to reside for a permanence on any account;  nor is he the only one that I have heard express the same opinion; and  it likewise seems a universal one among the lower class of emigrants.  They are encouraged by the example of others whom they see enjoying  comforts that they could never have obtained had they laboured ever so  hard at home; and they wisely reflect they must have had hardships to  endure had they remained in their native land (many indeed had been  driven out by want), without the most remote chance of bettering  themselves or becoming the possessors of land free from all  restrictions. \"What to us are the sufferings of one, two, three, or even  four years, compared with a whole life of labour and poverty,\" was the  remark of a poor labourer, who was recounting to us the other day some  of the hardships he had met with in this country. He said he \"knew they  were only for a short time, and that by industry he should soon get over  them.\"    I have already seen two of our poor neighbours that left the parish a  twelvemonth ago; they are settled in Canada Company lots, and are  getting on well. They have some few acres cleared and cropped, but are  obliged to \"_hire out_\", to enable their families to live, working on  their own land when they can. The men are in good spirits, and say \"they  shall in a few years have many comforts about them that they never could  have got at home, had they worked late and early; but they complain that  their wives are always pining for home, and lamenting that ever they  crossed the seas.\" This seems to be the general complaint with all  classes; the women are discontented and unhappy. Few enter with their  whole heart into a settler's life. They miss the little domestic  comforts they had been used to enjoy; they regret the friends and  relations they left in the old country; and they cannot endure the  loneliness of the backwoods.    This prospect does not discourage me: I know I shall find plenty of  occupation within-doors, and I have sources of enjoyment when I walk  abroad that will keep me from being dull. Besides, have I not a right to  be cheerful and contented for the sake of my beloved partner? The change  is not greater for me than him; and if for his sake I have voluntarily  left home, and friends, and country, shall I therefore sadden him by  useless regrets? I am always inclined to subscribe to that sentiment of  my favourite poet, Goldsmith,--    \"Still to ourselves in every place consign'd,  Our own felicity we make or find.\"    But I shall very soon be put to the test, as we leave this town to-  morrow by ten o'clock. The purchase of the Lake lot is concluded. There  are three acres chopped and a shanty up; but the shanty is not a  habitable dwelling, being merely an open shed that was put up by the  choppers as a temporary shelter; so we shall have to build a house. Late  enough we are; too late to get in a full crop, as the land is merely  chopped, not cleared, and it is too late now to log and burn the fallow,  and get the seed-wheat in: but it will be ready for spring crops. We  paid five dollars and a half per acre for the lot; this was rather high  for wild land, so far from a town, and in a scantily-settled part of the  township; but the situation is good, and has a water frontage, for which  my husband was willing to pay something more than if the lot had been  further inland.    In all probability it will be some time before I find leisure again to  take up my pen. We shall remain guests with ------ till our house is in  a habitable condition, which I suppose will be about Christmas.          LETTER VII.

Letters written on potsherds and flakes of  limestone.    Red brick the material for all large buildings. Limestone capitals of  debased leafage. Rudely cut relief patterns in wood. Coarsely carved  and turned bone or ivory. Pottery in Byzantine Age with white facing  and rudely painted figures. Textiles, with embroidery in colours, and  especially purple discs with thread designs of the earlier Arab  period. A characteristic of late Roman and Arab mounds is the organic  smell.    Muhammadan Period. Seventh to fifteenth centuries.  Characterized by great amounts of glazed pottery. Smaller antiquities  found in cemeteries or on ruined sites, the earliest transitional,  and related to Coptic examples of the same kinds. Pottery: lamps at  first continue Christian forms and are unglazed; afterwards long  spouted lamps of dark green glaze. Fragments of vessels, &c., from  the rubbish heaps of old Cairo are glazed; a typical faience has a  soft sandy body of light colour with painted designs in blue or blue  and brown with transparent glaze. Those of the Mamluk period, and  probably some of earlier date, show a general resemblance to Western  Asiatic contemporary wares, due to importation of potters from Syria,  Asia Minor, and Persia (between twelfth and fifteenth centuries).  Other varieties have decoration in metallic lustre on an opaque white  tin glaze; others again have monochrome glazes imitating imported  Chinese wares. Inscriptions very rare. Glass: if found, is in  fragments; rich coloured enamel designs are seldom earlier than the  thirteenth century. Textiles: chiefly found in small pieces; the  colours rich; ornament consisting of geometrical designs and Cufic  inscriptions. Any silk, or printed patterns, should be secured.    No information about papyri is given here, for the reason that any  site containing them should not be touched except by a trained  excavator.    [ILLUSTRATION XIII: EGYPTIAN POTTERY TYPES]          CHAPTER VIII      MESOPOTAMIA      [See the diagrams of flint implements, Illustration II; pottery and  brick-forms, Illustration XIV; cuneiform signs, and other scripts  Illustration XV].     Mesopotamian antiquities are nearly always found in Tells, or  artificial mounds, which are the sites of ancient towns or temples.  The surrounding plain for a distance of several hundred yards out,  whether steppe-desert or untilled land, will usually be found to be  productive of antiquities, either a few inches or few feet deep or,  in the case of the dessert, actually lying upon the surface. These  are usually the result of rainstorms washing out antiquities from the  tell itself. Each tell or ganglion of connected tells usually has a  number of small subsidiary tells round about it, the sites of small  isolated buildings or villages connected with the central settlement.  Originally the settlements were built upon natural rises of the  ground which stood up as islands in the fen-country.    Visitors should give the local names of tells in Arabic characters,  when possible, so that mistakes in transliteration into English may  be avoided. Antiquities bought in the neighbourhood of a tell should  be noted as coming from that neighbourhood. Depredations by Arabs (or  by others!) should be noted, and reported to the nearest Political  Officer or Inspector of Antiquities. The barbarous practice of  forcibly dislodging inscribed bricks from walls, as trophies and  'souvenirs', which has unhappily been common during the war, should  never be imitated and always discountenanced as much as possible.    Other good spots for antiquities than tells are rare. In the  mountainous and stony country of the North we may meet with rock-  sculptures, as at Bavian, and these should always be recorded by a  traveller, even if he is not certain that they have not been remarked  before: something new may turn up at any time. Antiquities acquired  in the neighbourhood of such monuments should be noted, and their  precise place of origin ascertained, if possible, as in this way the  site of some ancient settlement adjoining the monument may be  identified. The open ruin-fields, or _Khurbas_, characteristic of  Palestine are not usual, except in the case of Parthian or Sassanian  palace ruins such as Ctesiphon, Hatra, or Ukheidhir, which were often  abandoned almost as soon as they were built, so that no later  population could pile up rubbish-heaps or graves above them.    In order to aid the visitor to get some idea of the age of a tell or  other site from the antiquities found on its surface and its  neighbourhood, and so to be able to give some idea of what is likely  to be found in it, the following hints have been drawn up.    In the first place, most of the surface remains, are, as elsewhere,  pottery sherds. These should tell us their date by their appearance.  It must be said, however, that our experience on the subject of the  development of Mesopotamian pottery is limited. Owing to the  attention of Assyriologists having been so long focussed on the study  of the cuneiform records, to the neglect of general archaeology, we  have nothing like the knowledge of these things that we have in Egypt  or in Greece. Such minutiae of information as our common knowledge of  ceramic development in Egypt or in Greece gives us with regard to  these countries, enabling us to date sites with great accuracy, are  not vet available for Mesopotamia. And if for this reason all  possible information as to the objects found on archaeological sites  is desirable, it is also impossible yet to give the visitor any  absolute guide to the distinctive appearance of pottery at every  period. The main periods are known. The 'prehistoric', the Sumerian,  the late Babylonian, and the Parthian styles are easily  distinguishable. If a visitor is able to tell us that such-and-such a  mound is prehistoric or is Parthian, or that settlements of both  periods existed on it, this is what we want. One of the most general  of criteria with regard to pottery is whether it is glazed or not. If  glazed, it is, generally speaking, late. Other things besides pottery  are of course found, and the presence or the absence of metal, and  the occurrence of stone implements, are important. But it must be  remembered that stone was used long into the 'Bronze' Age, and  contemporaneously with copper. There is no sudden break between the  two periods. Fragments of shell and mother-of-pearl, often with  incised designs, are very characteristic of the earliest period.  Coins are of late date; a tell with coins on it is certain to contain  buildings as late as the fourth or third century B.C. (though it may  also contain far older buildings as well). One of the most useful  criteria of age is: Bricks. The form of the brick is a very good  guide to date. The Babylonians used both kiln-baked and crude bricks.  The oldest type, whether baked or crude, is plano-convex in form, and  uninscribed. The mortar is bitumen. Later on rectangular bricks,  often square, made in moulds, were introduced. These usually bore the  name of the royal builder. Later on bricks became generally oblong  and much like our own. In the sixth century the square shape was  revived. Both shapes were in use at the Nebuchadnezzar period. Glazed  bricks were then common. Under the Persians mortar took the place of  bitumen. Under the Parthians and Sassanians, bricks were yellow,  oblong, small, and very hard. Details will be found below, The names  of various excavated sites are given in brackets as the 'classical'  sources of information on certain points, and as the places from  which type-antiquities have come to our Museums. Ancient names are in  capitals; museums in italics.      I. PREHISTORIC (?) AGE: Chalcolithic (aeneolithic) period, before  3500 B.C.    Until quite recently no traces of the Stone Age had been discovered  in Babylonia other than a few possible palaeoliths lying on the  surface of the desert: all traces of a Neolithic Age were supposed to  have been buried beneath the alluvium of the valley. In Assyria,  however, neolithic traces in the shape of obsidian flakes had been  discovered by the late Prof. L. W. King in the course of his  excavation of the mound of Kuyunjik (NINEVEH), besides fragments of  painted pottery resembling those from the earliest deposits in Asia  Minor and those found by the American geologist Pumpelly in his  diggings in the _kurgans_ of Turkestan, (to which he assigned an  extremely remote date B.C.). In Persia, and about the head of the  Persian Gulf, somewhat similar pottery was discovered by de Morgan  and the other French excavators at Susa, Tepe Musyan, Bandar Bushir,  and other places: here again the dates were put at a very remote  period. With the exception of a few flint saw-blades from Warka [1],  Fara, Zurghul, and Babylon [2], no similar remains had been found in  Babylonia until, in 1918, Capt. R. Campbell Thompson, exploring on  behalf of the British Museum, discovered flint and obsidian flakes  and painted pottery lying on the surface of the desert at Tell Abu  Shahrein (ERIDU), and also at Tell Muqayyar (UR). The continued  excavations carried out by Mr. H. R. Hall for the Museum in 1919 have  produced more of the same evidence from both places, besides a new  'prehistoric' site at Tell el-Ma'abed or Tell el-'Obeid near Ur. It  seems that these antiquities date from the very end of the neolithic,  or rather to the succeeding 'chalcolithic', age; whether they are  really prehistoric, as regards Babylonian history, must until more  evidence from stratified deposits is found remain undecided. They  prove the occupation of the head of the Persian Gulf at the beginning  of history by a people whose"]]]
