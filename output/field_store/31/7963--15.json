An attempt was made to land, where there proved not to be  sufficient water for the boat. During this transaction, an old man and a  youth were standing on the rocks where the boat was trying to approach.  Having seen how much our men had laboured to get under land, they were  very solicitous to point out the deepest water. Afterwards they brought  fire, and seemed willing to render any service in their power. Two of the  officers suffered themselves to be conducted by the old man to a cave at  some distance, but declined going in, though he invited them by all the  signs he could invent. This was rather unfortunate, as the rain was  falling very violently, and the cave was found next day sufficiently  large to have sheltered the whole party. The old man certainly took great  pains to make this understood, but the motive of his earnestness  unluckily was mistaken, and his visitors suffered for their suspicions.  He afterwards assisted in clearing away the bushes, and making  preparations for the party to sleep on shore, and next morning was  rewarded with presents for his very friendly behaviour. Two days  afterwards, when Governor Phillip returned to the same spot, the old man  met him with a dance and a song of joy. His son was with him, and several  of the natives; a hatchet was given them and other presents; and as the  Governor was to return next day to Port Jackson, it was hoped that the  friendship thus begun, and so studiously cultivated, would have continued  firm. But as soon as it was dark, the old man stole a spade, and was  caught with it in his hand. Governor Phillip thought it necessary, on  this occasion, to shew some tokens of displeasure, and therefore when the  delinquent approached, he gave him two or three slight slaps on the  shoulder, and then pushed him away, at the same time pointing to the  spade. This gentle chastisement at once destroyed their friendship. The  old man immediately seized a spear, and coming close up to the Governor,  poized it, and seemed determined to strike. But seeing that his threats  were disregarded, (for his antagonist chose rather to risk the effects of  his anger than to fire upon him) or perhaps dissuaded by something the  other natives said, in a few moments he dropped the spear and went away.  It was impossible not to be struck with the courage displayed by him on  this occasion, for Governor Phillip at the time was not alone, but had  several officers and men about him. From this and other similar events,  personal bravery appears to be a quality in which the natives of New  South Wales are not by any means deficient. The old man returned the next  morning with many other natives, but, in order to convince him of his  fault, he was less noticed than his companions, who were presented with  hatchets and various other articles.    9 March 1788    It was now the 9th of March, and Governor Phillip returned to Port  Jackson: having gained some useful knowledge of the country, and  maintained an intercourse with the natives without departing from his  favourite plan of treating them with the utmost kindness. He had  endeavoured at the same time to gain their confidence, if possible, and  secure their friendship. If these humane endeavours were afterwards  rendered fruitless by the wanton profligacy of some depraved individuals,  however he might regret it, he could have no reason to reproach himself.    The rain, which was almost constant, prevented the Governor from  returning by land, which otherwise he meant to have done, for the sake of  exploring a part of the country which appeared to be good and free from  timber.      Chapter X.    March 1788    Departure of the French Ships--Death of M. Le Receveur--Return of the  Supply from Norfolk Island--Description of that Place--Howe Island  discovered.    10 March 1788    On the 10th of March, the French ships sailed from Botany Bay. M. De la  Peyrouse during his stay there had set up two long boats, the frames of  which he had brought with him from Europe. There had not been much  intercourse between the French and English in this interval: both being  too busily employed to waste their time in parties of pleasure. Captain  Clonard had waited on Governor Phillip with the letters which were to be  forwarded to the French ambassador; and a few of the English officers had  gone over by land about the same time to pay a visit in Botany Bay; both  parties were of course received with politeness and hospitality. Some few  of the convicts contrived to abscond, and endeavoured to get admitted  into the French ships, but were, with great propriety, rejected. Those  vessels returned towards the north, where they were to make another  voyage.    During the stay of M. De la Peyrouse in Botany Bay, Father Le Receveur,  who had come out in the Astrolabe as a naturalist, died. His death was  occasioned by wounds which he received in the unfortunate rencounter at  the Navigator's Islands. A slight monument was erected to his memory,  with the following inscription.    Hic jacet LE RECEVEUR,  E. F. F. Minimis Galliae Sacerdos,  Physicus in circumnavigatione  Mundi,  Duce DE LA PEYROUSE,  Ob. 17 Feb. 1788.    The monument being soon after destroyed by the natives, Governor Phillip  caused the inscription to be engraved on copper, and affixed to a  neighbouring tree. M. De la Peyrouse had paid a similar tribute of  respect to the memory of Captain Clerke, at the harbour of St. Peter and  Paul in Kamtschatka.    19 March 1788    On the 19th of this month, Lieutenant Ball arrived in the Supply from  Norfolk Island. He had made that island on the 29th of February, but was  five days off the coast before a place could be found at which it was  possible to land the stores and provisions. So completely do the rocks  surround the island, that it was not easy to find a place even to land a  man. At length, however, they succeeded, having discovered at the  south-west end, a small opening in a reef that runs across a bay. Here  the people, provisions and stores were all put on shore in perfect  safety. The Commandant wrote in high spirits at the promising appearance  of his new territory; and subsequent accounts have proved, that the  opinion he then formed was not erroneous. He described Norfolk Island as  one entire wood, or rather as a garden overrun with the noblest pines, in  straightness, size, and magnitude, far superior to any he had ever seen.  Nothing can exceed the fertility of its soil. Wherever it has been since  examined, a rich black mould has been found to the depth of five or six  feet: and the grain and garden seeds which have been sown, such only  excepted as were damaged in the carriage, or by the weevil, have  vegetated with the utmost luxuriance. To prevent repetitions, it may  perhaps be best to unite in this place the accounts which have been  received of this island, though many of them will easily be perceived to  be greatly posterior to this first return of the Supply.    Norfolk Island is about seven leagues in circumference, and if not  originally formed, like many other small islands, by the eruption of  volcanic matter from the bed of the sea, must doubtless have contained a  volcano. This conclusion is formed from the vast quantity of pumice stone  which is scattered in all parts of it, and mixed with the soil. The  crater, or at least some traces of its former existence, will probably be  found at the summit of a small mountain, which rises near the middle of  the island. To this mountain the Commandant has given the name of Mount  Pitt. The island is exceedingly well watered. At, or near Mount Pitt,  rises a strong and copious stream, which flowing through a very fine  valley, divides itself into several branches, each of which retains  sufficient force to be used in turning mills: and in various parts of the  island excellent springs have been discovered.    The climate is pure, salubrious, and delightful, preserved from  oppressive heats by constant breezes from the sea, and of so mild a  temperature throughout the winter, that vegetation continues there  without interruption, one crop succeeding another. Refreshing showers  from time to time maintain perpetual verdure; not indeed of grass, for  none has yet been seen upon the island, but of the trees, shrubs, and  other vegetables which in all parts grow abundantly. On the leaves of  these, and of some kinds in particular, the sheep, hogs, and goats, not  only live, but thrive and fatten very much. To the salubrity of the air  every individual in this little colony can bear ample testimony, from the  uninterrupted state of good health which has been in general enjoyed.    When our settlers landed, there was not a single acre clear of wood in  the island, and the trees were so bound together by that kind of creeping  shrub called supple jack, interwoven in all directions, as to render it  very difficult to penetrate far among them. The Commandant, small as his  numbers were at first, by indefatigable activity soon caused a space to  be cleared sufficient for the requisite accommodations, and for the  production of esculent vegetables of all kinds in the greatest abundance.  When the last accounts arrived, three acres of barley were in a very  thriving state, and ground was prepared to receive rice and Indian corn.  In the wheat there had been a disappointment, the grain that was sown  having been so much injured by the weevil, as to be unfit for vegetation.  But the people were all at that time in commodious houses; and, according  to the declarations of Mr. King himself, in his letters to Governor  Phillip, there was not a doubt that this colony would be in a situation  to support itself entirely without assistance, in less than four years:  and with very little in the intermediate time. Even two years would be  more than sufficient for this purpose,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15106"],[0,"Origin of the Anglo-Boer War Revealed (2nd ed.) (#15)"],[1,"a controversy with England,  taking up the position of repudiating the claim of suzerainty, and  averring the complete independence of the State, subject only to the one  clause _re_ treaties with foreign nations. Another object would be  gained, viz., of diverting England from Bond aims by that and similar  controversies. To make a show of sincerity about it all, the opinions  (foregathered, of course) of certain eminent jurists in England and  Holland were obtained, who refuted the claim in elaborate disquisitions  and with that readiness of apparent conviction so peculiar to some  advocates' affected faith in their clients' cause. Thus England was  decoyed into a protracted tournament of words and phrases without any  practical result, but gratifying and inspiring no doubt to certain  well-paid _soi-disant_ champions of the principle defined as the  \"_perfection of justice_,\" who revel in a display of forensic erudition,  which, however, only illustrates to the unedified lay mind how speech is  adaptable to veil inward conviction, and how a mass of rhetoric can be  employed to justify the breach of simple and well-understood  engagements.    It continues to be clumsily insisted upon in official and paid Press  organs how the need of providing Transvaal armaments became realized  only with that Anglo-capitalistic plot of 1895-96 against Boer  independence, and that, in fact, Dr. Jameson was worthy of the Boer  nation's lasting gratitude for opening their eyes to their helplessly  unarmed and unprepared condition up to that time. In those papers it is  declared with unblushing inexactness how the Transvaal at that epoch  possessed only two hundred and fifty inefficient and ill-equipped  artillerists, with only a few cannons of various antiquated types, and  how the burgher element had, up to that time, continued unarmed and in  unsuspecting insecurity. To stamp these misstatements as false, it needs  only to be considered that from the time of the Boer trek in 1835-38  every Boer had been a hunter and guerilla soldier possessed of the best  firearms then extant, ready at any sacrifice to provide still more  effective weapons as inventions in arms of precision in turn progressed.  His passion to be well armed only equalled that of his love for land.  From 1881 every Transvaal and Orange Free State Boer without exception  had, and was obliged to have, his Martini-Henry rifle. The Government  arsenals were supplied with reserves of that up to recently unsurpassed  weapon and with large stores of ammunition. The authorities supplied  that rifle at L4 each, and even gratis in the case of indigent burghers.  At the frequent reviews (_wapenschouwingen_) each burgher had to appear  mounted, with his Martini-Henry rifle and thirty rounds ammunition. To  maintain proficiency in rifle practice, prizes and honours were  distributed at Government expense in each ward, whilst there was plenty  of private emulation encouraged among young and old in the science of  sharp-shooting, the Governments of both Republics contributing  ammunition at below cost price.    In about 1893 the Transvaal Government introduced about 10,000 new  rifles of the Guede pattern, firing a steel-pointed bullet, but the  issue did not become general, as the Martini-Henry rifle continued to be  held more effective for game and for war. The Mauser rifle was only  provided, after long hesitation and much diffidence, for its  rapid-firing quality in war, whereas for game it is still considered  inferior to the larger bored Martini-Henry.    On the occasion of the Jameson incursion, the Transvaal had in readiness  extensive parks of the most modern quick-firing Maxims and Nordenfeldts  of various calibres, and breech-loading field artillery of the Krupp  make. The Orange Free State hurried to their assistance with similar  artillery, each burgher armed with a Martini-Henry rifle. Besides all  that, there was the dynamite and explosives factory equipped to  manufacture all sorts of modern ammunition as it does now, and this is  why President Krueger described that factory as one of the corner-stones  of Boer independence. In the face of these facts it is a most singular  departure to say that the Transvaal only thought of arming when becoming  alarmed for the future by the Jameson attempt, and that statement could  only have been intended to mislead the uninformed at a distance. \"_Qui  s'excuse s'accuse_\" is applicable in this as well as in other ruses for  hiding those sinister Bond aims and to pose as the guileless and  victimized Boer nation. It was just the other way about--it was England  who was unprepared and exposed to imminent risk of aggression on the  part of the Boer combination.    What had amazed and actually exasperated many Boers was the ludicrously  puny attempt made by Jameson and the Johannesburg revolutionary concert.  It was at the time thought that the invasion of some 700 men was only a  first installment, and that much larger developments were in preparation  to attack the State. It was for that reason that only a few batteries of  artillery were despatched at a late moment to Doornkop under Commandant  Trichaart to operate against Jameson's party, while the bulk was held in  reserve with an extensive mobilization of burghers to resist other  supposed opposition of an altogether more formidable but yet undefined  character. When nothing further transpired, the feeling uppermost with  the people was unbounded derision at that impotent fiasco, and a  loathing contempt for the cowering Johannesburg rabble who betrayed and  sacrificed the insensate doctor. It was loudly asserted that the  combined forces of the two Republics were competent to resist an  invasion a hundred times stronger than the one so foolishly attempted;  but, with cooler counsels, it was resolved to adopt the appealing  attitude of the deeply injured party who miraculously and providentially  escaped a great national peril. Upon these lines the raid incident  afforded an immense advantage to Afrikaner Bond tactics, and an impulse  to Bond propaganda which enormously increased Boer partisanship,  inflicting at the same time a fatal check upon the diplomacy of England  and upon the essential peace-preserving measures for safeguarding her  South African interests. The circumstances, however, served to embolden  many hitherto undecided sympathisers into openly declared and vehement  Boer partisans, revealing the singular spectacle, among English people  even, of a morbid cult apparently ready to sacrifice their nation just  to vindicate their judicial dicta about Boer innocence and to parade  their own darling sense of shocked and violated national honour.    Quite other and more emphatic terms apply to the revolting sewerage such  as the socialistic platform and other purulent nurseries for breeding  wilful and hypocritical abettors, at so much a score, of misguided and  treason-hatching Afrikanerdom.          THE TRANSVAAL DYNAMITE AND EXPLOSIVES MONOPOLY      The factory pertaining to this enterprise, situated near Pretoria, is  recognised to be the most extensive and best equipped of its kind in  existence. It is capable of turning out all the dynamite and similar  blasting material needed for the gold and other mines of the State, also  every description of explosive needed for modern ammunition.    Its equipments include ateliers and laboratories under the conduct of  eminent scientists and men of most advanced technical proficiency. The  site is a farm named Modderfontein of about 8,000 acres near Pretoria.  The industry provides employment for over 5,000 persons. In connection  with this factory is a foundry at Pretoria for casting shells, etc. The  various ingredients, such as sulphur, guhr, saltpetre, etc., are  believed to be plentiful in the State, but their exploitation is found  to be more costly than it is to import the pure articles from Europe.    The investment is represented mostly by French and German shareholders,  the Transvaal Government also possessing a portion of the shares. The  contract with the State conveys a complete monopoly for the manufacture  and importation of all descriptions of explosives, and is so framed as  to base its subsistence upon international rights. One of the conditions  is that the issue of ammunition is relegated to State control. In this  manner burghers only get supplies, whilst Uitlanders are limited to very  small quantities for sporting purposes by special permits.
