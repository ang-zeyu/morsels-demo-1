After the feast, the sultan sent for the chief cadi, and commanded him  to draw up a contract of marriage between the Princess Buddir al Buddoor  and Aladdin. When the contract had been drawn, the sultan asked Aladdin  if he would stay in the palace and complete the ceremonies of the  marriage that day. \"Sire,\" said Aladdin, \"though great is my impatience  to enter on the honour granted me by your majesty, yet I beg you to  permit me first to build a palace worthy to receive the princess your  daughter. I pray you to grant me sufficient ground near your palace, and  I will have it completed with the utmost expedition.\" The sultan granted  Aladdin his request, and again embraced him. After which he took his  leave with as much politeness as if he had been bred up and had always  lived at court.    Aladdin returned home in the order he had come, amidst the acclamations  of the people, who wished him all happiness and prosperity. As soon as  he dismounted, he retired to his own chamber, took the lamp, and  summoned the genie as usual, who professed his allegiance. \"Genie,\" said  Aladdin, \"build me a palace fit to receive the Princess Buddir al  Buddoor. Let its materials be made of nothing less than porphyry,  jasper, agate, lapis lazuli, and the finest marble. Let its walls be  massive gold and silver bricks laid alternately. Let each front contain  six windows, and let the lattices of these (except one, which must be  left unfinished) be enriched with diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, so  that they shall exceed everything of the kind ever seen in the world.  Let there be an inner and outer court in front of the palace, and a  spacious garden; but above all things, provide a safe treasure-house,  and fill it with gold and silver. Let there be also kitchens and  storehouses, stables full of the finest horses, with their equerries and  grooms, and hunting equipage, officers, attendants, and slaves, both men  and women, to form a retinue for the princess and myself. Go and execute  my wishes.\"    When Aladdin gave these commands to the genie, the sun was set. The next  morning at daybreak the genie presented himself, and, having obtained  Aladdin's consent, transported him in a moment to the palace he had  made. The genie led him through all the apartments, where he found  officers and slaves, habited according to their rank and the services to  which they were appointed. The genie then showed him the treasury, which  was opened by a treasurer, where Aladdin saw large vases of different  sizes, piled up to the top with money, ranged all round the chamber. The  genie thence led him to the stables, where were some of the finest  horses in the world, and the grooms busy in dressing them; from thence  they went to the storehouses, which were filled with all things  necessary, both for food and ornament.    When Aladdin had examined every portion of the palace, and particularly  the hall with the four-and-twenty windows, and found it far to exceed  his fondest expectations, he said, \"Genie, there is one thing wanting, a  fine carpet for the princess to walk upon from the sultan's palace to  mine. Lay one down immediately.\" The genie disappeared, and Aladdin saw  what he desired executed in an instant. The genie then returned, and  carried him to his own home.    When the sultan's porters came to open the gates, they were amazed to  find what had been an unoccupied garden filled up with a magnificent  palace, and a splendid carpet extending to it all the way from the  sultan's palace. They told the strange tidings to the grand vizier, who  informed the sultan, who exclaimed, \"It must be Aladdin's palace, which  I gave him leave to build for my daughter. He has wished to surprise us,  and let us see what wonders can be done in only one night.\"    Aladdin, on his being conveyed by the genie to his own home, requested  his mother to go to the Princess Buddir al Buddoor, and tell her that  the palace would be ready for her reception in the evening. She went,  attended by her women slaves, in the same order as on the preceding day.  Shortly after her arrival at the princess's apartment, the sultan  himself came in, and was surprised to find her, whom he knew as his  suppliant at his divan in such humble guise, to be now more richly and  sumptuously attired than his own daughter. This gave him a higher  opinion of Aladdin, who took such care of his mother, and made her share  his wealth and honours. Shortly after her departure, Aladdin, mounting  his horse, and attended by his retinue of magnificent attendants, left  his paternal home forever, and went to the palace in the same pomp as on  the day before. Nor did he forget to take with him the Wonderful Lamp,  to which he owed all his good fortune, nor to wear the Ring which was  given him as a talisman. The sultan entertained Aladdin with the utmost  magnificence, and at night, on the conclusion of the marriage  ceremonies, the princess took leave of the sultan her father. Bands of  music led the procession, followed by a hundred state ushers, and the  like number of black mutes, in two files, with their officers at their  head. Four hundred of the sultan's young pages carried flambeaux on each  side, which, together with the illuminations of the sultan's and  Aladdin's palaces, made it as light as day. In this order the princess,  conveyed in her litter, and accompanied also by Aladdin's mother,  carried in a superb litter and attended by her women slaves, proceeded  on the carpet which was spread from the sultan's palace to that of  Aladdin. On her arrival Aladdin was ready to receive her at the  entrance, and led her into a large hall, illuminated with an infinite  number of wax candles, where a noble feast was served up. The dishes  were of massy gold, and contained the most delicate viands. The vases,  basins, and goblets were gold also, and of exquisite workmanship, and  all the other ornaments and embellishments of the hall were answerable  to this display. The princess, dazzled to see so much riches collected  in one place, said to Aladdin, \"I thought, prince, that nothing in the  world was so beautiful as the sultan my father's palace, but the sight  of this hall alone is sufficient to show I was deceived.\"    When the supper was ended, there entered a company of female dancers,  who performed, according to the custom of the country, singing at the  same time verses in praise of the bride and bridegroom. About midnight  Aladdin's mother conducted the bride to the nuptial apartment, and he  soon after retired.    The next morning the attendants of Aladdin presented themselves to dress  him, and brought him another habit, as rich and magnificent as that worn  the day before. He then ordered one of the horses to be got ready,  mounted him, and went in the midst of a large troop of slaves to the  sultan's palace to entreat him to take a repast in the princess's  palace, attended by his grand vizier and all the lords of his court. The  sultan consented with pleasure, rose up immediately, and, preceded by  the principal officers of his palace, and followed by all the great  lords of his court, accompanied Aladdin.    The nearer the sultan approached Aladdin's palace, the more he was  struck with its beauty; but when he entered it, came into the hall, and  saw the windows, enriched with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, all large  perfect stones, he was completely surprised, and said to his son-in-law,  \"This palace is one of the wonders of the world; for where in all the  world besides shall we find walls built of massy gold and silver, and  diamonds, rubies, and emeralds composing the windows? But what most  surprises me is, that a hall of this magnificence should be left with  one of its windows incomplete and unfinished.\" \"Sire,\" answered Aladdin,  \"the omission was by design, since I wished that you should have the  glory of finishing this hall.\" \"I take your intention kindly,\" said the  sultan, \"and will give orders about it immediately.\"    After the sultan had finished this magnificent entertainment, provided  for him and for his court by Aladdin, he was informed that the jewellers  and goldsmiths attended; upon which he returned to the hall, and showed  them the window which was unfinished. \"I sent for you,\" said he, \"to fit  up this window in as great perfection as the rest. Examine them well,  and make all the dispatch you can.\"    The jewellers and goldsmiths examined the three-and-twenty windows with  great attention, and after they had consulted together, to know what  each could furnish, they returned, and presented themselves before the  sultan, whose principal jeweller undertaking to speak for the rest,  said, \"Sire, we are all willing to exert our utmost care and industry to  obey you; but among us all we cannot furnish jewels enough for so great  a work.\" \"I have more than are necessary,\" said the sultan; \"come to my  palace, and you shall choose what may answer your purpose.\"    When the sultan returned to his palace, he ordered his jewels to be  brought out, and the jewellers took a great quantity, particularly those  Aladdin had made him a present of, which they soon used, without making  any great advance in their work. They came again several times for more,  and in a month's time had not finished half their work. In short, they  used all the jewels the sultan had, and borrowed of the vizier, but yet  the work was not half done.    Aladdin, who knew that all the sultan's endeavours to make this window  like the rest were in vain, sent for the jewellers and goldsmiths, and  not only commanded them to desist from their work, but ordered them to  undo what they had begun, and to carry all their jewels back to the  sultan and to the vizier. They undid in a few hours what they had been "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1493"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 1 (#15)"],[1," I was  alone, I did not fall into sin, but as soon as this woman came to  me, she tempted me.\" God replied: \"I gave her unto thee as a  help, and thou art ungrateful when thou accusest her, saying,  'She gave me of the tree.' Thou shouldst not have obeyed her, for  thou art the head, and not she.\"[79] God, who knows all things,  had foreseen exactly this, and He had not created Eve until Adam  had asked Him for a helpmate, so that he might not have  apparently good reason for reproaching God with having created  woman.[80]    As Adam tried to shift the blame for his misdeed from himself, so  also Eve. She, like her husband, did not confess her  transgression and pray for pardon, which would have been granted  to her.[81] Gracious as God is, He did not pronounce the doom  upon Adam and Eve until they showed themselves stiff-necked. Not  so with the serpent. God inflicted the curse upon the serpent  without hearing his defense; for the serpent is a villain, and  the wicked are good debaters. If God had questioned him, the  serpent would have answered: \"Thou didst give them a command, and  I did contradict it. Why did they obey me, and not Thee?\"[82]  Therefore God did not enter into an argument with the serpent,  but straightway decreed the following ten punishments: The mouth  of the serpent was closed, and his power of speech taken away;  his hands and feet were hacked off; the earth was given him as  food; he must suffer great pain in sloughing his skin; enmity is  to exist between him and man; if he eats the choicest viands, or  drinks the sweetest beverages, they all change into dust in his  mouth; the pregnancy of the female serpent lasts seven years; men  shall seek to kill him as soon as they catch sight of him; even  in the future world, where all beings will be blessed, he will  not escape the punishment decreed for him; he will vanish from  out of the Holy Land if Israel walks in the ways of God.[83]    Furthermore, God spake to the serpent: \"I created thee to be king  over all animals, cattle and the beasts of the field alike; but  thou wast not satisfied. Therefore thou shalt be cursed above all  cattle and above every beast of the field. I created thee of  upright posture; but thou wast not satisfied. Therefore thou  shalt go upon thy belly. I created thee to eat the same food as  man; but thou wast not satisfied. Therefore thou shalt eat dust  all the days of thy life. Thou didst seek to cause the death of  Adam in order to espouse his wife. Therefore I will put enmity  between thee and the woman.\" How true it is--he who lusts after  what is not his due, not only does he not attain his desire, but  he also loses what he has!    As angels had been present when the doom was pronounced upon the  serpent--for God had convoked a Sanhedrin of seventy-one angels  when He sat in judgment upon him--so the execution of the decree  against him was entrusted to angels. They descended from heaven,  and chopped off his hands and feet. His suffering was so great  that his agonized cries could be heard from one end of the world  to the other.[84]    The verdict against Eve also consisted of ten curses, the effect  of which is noticeable to this day in the physical, spiritual,  and social state of woman.[85] It was not God Himself who  announced her fate to Eve. The only woman with whom God ever  spoke was Sarah. In the case of Eve, He made use of the services  of an interpreter.[86]    Finally, also the punishment of Adam was tenfold: he lost his  celestial clothing--God stripped it off him; in sorrow he was to  earn his daily bread; the food he ate was to be turned from good  into bad; his children were to wander from land to land; his body  was to exude sweat; he was to have an evil inclination; in death  his body was to be a prey of the worms; animals were to have  power over him, in that they could slay him; his days were to be  few and full of trouble; in the end he was to render account of  all his doings on earth.    These three sinners were not the only ones to have punishment  dealt out to them. The earth fared no better, for it had been  guilty of various misdemeanors. In the first place, it had not  entirely heeded the command of God given on the third day, to  bring forth \"tree of fruit.\" What God had desired was a tree the  wood of which was to be as pleasant to the taste as the fruit  thereof. The earth, however, produced a tree bearing fruit, the  tree itself not being edible.[88] Again, the earth did not do its  whole duty in connection with the sin of Adam. God had appointed  the sun and the earth witnesses to testify against Adam in case  he committed a trespass. The sun, accordingly, had grown dark the  instant Adam became guilty of disobedience, but the earth, not  knowing how to take notice of Adam's fall, disregarded it  altogether.[89] The earth also had to suffer a tenfold  punishment: independent before, she was hereafter to wait to be  watered by the rain from above; sometimes the fruits of the earth  fail; the grain she brings forth is stricken with blasting and  mildew; she must produce all sorts of noxious vermin; thenceforth  she was to be divided into valleys and mountains; she must grow  barren trees, bearing no fruit; thorns and thistles sprout from  her; much is sown in the earth, but little is harvested; in time  to come the earth will have to disclose her blood, and shall no  more cover her slain; and, finally, she shall, one day, \"wax old  like a garment.\"[90]    When Adam heard the words, \"Thorns and thistles shall it bring  forth,\" concerning the ground, a sweat broke out on his face, and  he said: \"What! Shall I and my cattle eat from the same manger?\"  The Lord had mercy upon him, and spoke, \"In view of the sweat of  thy face, thou shalt eat bread.\"[91]    The earth is not the only thing created that was made to suffer  through the sin of Adam. The same fate overtook the moon. When  the serpent seduced Adam and Eve, and exposed their nakedness,  they wept bitterly, and with them wept the heavens, and the sun  and the stars, and all created beings and things up to the throne  of God. The very angels and the celestial beings were grieved by  the trans gression of Adam. The moon alone laughed, wherefore God  grew wroth, and obscured her light. Instead of shining steadily  like the sun, all the length of the day, she grows old quickly,  and must be born and reborn, again and again.[92] The callous  conduct of the moon offended God, not only by way of contrast  with the compassion of all other creatures, but because He  Himself was full of pity for Adam and his wife. He made clothes  for them out of the skin stripped from the serpent.[93] He would  have done even more. He would have permitted them to remain in  Paradise, if only they had been penitent. But they refused to  repent, and they had to leave, lest their godlike understanding  urge them to ravage the tree of life, and they learn to live  forever. As it was, when God dismissed them from Paradise, He did  not allow the Divine quality of justice to prevail entirely. He  associated mercy with it. As they left, He said: \"O what a pity  that Adam was not able to observe the command laid upon him for  even a brief span of time!\"    To guard the entrance to Paradise, God appointed the cherubim,  called also the ever-turning sword of flames, because angels can  turn themselves from one shape into another at need.[94] Instead  of the tree of life, God gave Adam the Torah, which likewise is a  tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and he was permitted  to take up his abode in the vicinity of Paradise in the east.[95]    Sentence pronounced upon Adam and Eve and the serpent, the Lord  commanded the angels to turn the man and the woman out of  Paradise. They began to weep and supplicate bitterly, and the  angels took pity upon them and left the Divine command  unfulfilled, until they could petition God to mitigate His severe  verdict. But the Lord was inexorable, saying, \"Was it I that  committed a trespass, or did I pronounce a false judgment?\" Also  Adam's prayer, to be given of the fruit of the tree of life, was  turned aside, with the promise, however, that if he would lead a  pious life, he would be given of the fruit on the day of  resurrection, and he would then live forever.    Seeing that God had resolved unalterably, Adam began to weep  again and implore the angels to grant him at least permission to  take sweet-scented spices with him out of Paradise, that outside,  too, he might be able to bring offerings unto God, and his  prayers be accepted before the Lord. Thereupon the angels came  before God, and spake: \"King unto everlasting, command Thou us to  give Adam sweet-scented spices of Paradise,\" and God heard their  prayer. Thus Adam gathered saffron, nard, calamus, and cinnamon,  and all sorts of seeds besides for his sustenance. Laden with  these, Adam and Eve left Paradise, and came upon earth.[96] They  had enjoyed the splendors of Paradise but a brief span of  time--but a few hours. It was in the first hour of the sixth day  of creation that God conceived the idea of creating man; in the  second hour, He took counsel with the angels; in the third, He  gathered the dust for the body of man; in the fourth, He formed  Adam; in the fifth, He clothed him with skin; in the sixth, the  soulless shape was complete, so that it could stand upright; in  the seventh, a soul was breathed into it; in the eighth, man was  led into Paradise; in the ninth, the Divine command prohibiting  the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden was issued to  him; in the tenth, he transgressed the command; in the eleventh,  he was judged; and in the twelfth hour of the day, he was cast  out of Paradise, in atonement for his sin.    This eventful day was the first of the month of Tishri. Therefore  God spoke to Adam: \"Thou shalt be the prototype of thy children.  As thou hast been judged by Me on this day and absolved, so thy"]]]
