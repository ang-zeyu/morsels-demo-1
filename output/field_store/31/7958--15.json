Magnum ingenium Luci Luculli magnumque optimarum artium studium, tum  omnis liberalis et digna homine nobili ab eo percepta doctrina, quibus  temporibus florere in foro maxime potuit, caruit omnino rebus urbanis. Ut  enim admodum adolescens cum fratre pari pietate et industria praedito  paternas inimicitias magna cum gloria est persecutus, in Asiam quaestor  profectus, ibi permultos annos admirabili quadam laude provinciae praefuit;  deinde absens factus aedilis, continuo praetor--licebat enim celerius legis  praemio--, post in Africam, inde ad consulatum, quem ita gessit ut  diligentiam admirarentur omnes, ingenium cognoscerent. Post ad  Mithridaticum bellum missus a senatu non modo opinionem vicit omnium, quae  de virtute eius erat, sed etiam gloriam superiorum. 2. Idque eo fuit  mirabilius, quod ab eo laus imperatoria non admodum exspectabatur, qui  adolescentiam in forensi opera, quaesturae diuturnum tempus Murena bellum  in Ponto gerente in Asia pace consumpserat. Sed incredibilis quaedam ingeni  magnitudo non desideravit indocilem usus disciplinam. Itaque cum totum iter  et navigationem consumpsisset partim in percontando a peritis, partim in  rebus gestis legendis, in Asiam factus imperator venit, cum esset Roma  profectus rei militaris rudis. Habuit enim divinam quandam memoriam rerum,  verborum maiorem Hortensius, sed quo plus in negotiis gerendis res quam  verba prosunt, hoc erat memoria illa praestantior, quam fuisse in  Themistocle, quem facile Graeciae principem ponimus, singularem ferunt: qui  quidem etiam pollicenti cuidam se artem ei memoriae, quae tum primum  proferebatur, traditurum respondisse dicitur oblivisci se malle discere,  credo, quod haerebant in memoria quaecumque audierat et viderat. Tali  ingenio praeditus Lucullus adiunxerat etiam illam, quam Themistocles  spreverat, disciplinam. Itaque ut litteris consignamus quae monumentis  mandare volumus, sic ille in animo res insculptas habebat. 3. Tantus ergo  imperator in omni genere belli fuit, proeliis, oppugnationibus, navalibus  pugnis totiusque belli instrumento et apparatu, ut ille rex post Alexandrum  maximus hunc a se maiorem ducem cognitum quam quemquam eorum, quos  legisset, fateretur. In eodem tanta prudentia fuit in constituendis  temperandisque civitatibus, tanta aequitas, ut hodie stet Asia Luculli  institutis servandis et quasi vestigiis persequendis. Sed etsi magna cum  utilitate rei publicae, tamen diutius quam vellem tanta vis virtutis atque  ingeni peregrinata afuit ab oculis et fori et curiae. Quin etiam, cum  victor a Mithridatico bello revertisset, inimicorum calumnia triennio  tardius quam debuerat triumphavit. Nos enim consules introduximus paene in  urbem currum clarissimi viri: cuius mihi consilium et auctoritas quid tum  in maximis rebus profuisset dicerem, nisi de me ipso dicendum esset: quod  hoc tempore non est necesse. Itaque privabo illum potius debito testimonio  quam id cum mea laude communicem.    II. 4. Sed quae populari gloria decorari in Lucullo debuerunt, ea fere sunt  et Graecis litteris celebrata et Latinis. Nos autem illa externa cum  multis, haec interiora cum paucis ex ipso saepe cognovimus. Maiore enim  studio Lucullus cum omni litterarum generi tum philosophiae deditus fuit  quam qui illum ignorabant arbitrabantur, nec vero ineunte aetate solum, sed  et pro quaestore aliquot annos et in ipso bello, in quo ita magna rei  militaris esse occupatio solet, ut non multum imperatori sub ipsis pellibus  otii relinquatur. Cum autem e philosophis ingenio scientiaque putaretur  Antiochus, Philonis auditor, excellere, eum secum et quaestor habuit et  post aliquot annos imperator, cumque esset ea memoria, quam ante dixi, ea  saepe audiendo facile cognovit, quae vel semel audita meminisse potuisset.  Delectabatur autem mirifice lectione librorum, de quibus audiebat.    5. Ac vereor interdum ne talium personarum cum amplificare velim, minuam  etiam gloriam. Sunt enim multi qui omnino Graecas non ament litteras,  plures qui philosophiam, reliqui, etiam si haec non improbent, tamen earum  rerum disputationem principibus civitatis non ita decoram putant. Ego  autem, cum Graecas litteras M. Catonem in senectute didicisse acceperim, P.  autem Africani historiae loquantur in legatione illa nobili, quam ante  censuram obiit, Panaetium unum omnino comitem fuisse, nec litterarum  Graecarum nec philosophiae iam ullum auctorem requiro. 6. Restat ut iis  respondeam, qui sermonibus eius modi nolint personas tam gravis illigari.  Quasi vero clarorum virorum aut tacitos congressus esse oporteat aut  ludicros sermones aut rerum colloquia leviorum! Etenim, si quodam in libro  vere est a nobis philosophia laudata, profecto eius tractatio optimo atque  amplissimo quoque dignissima est, nec quicquam aliud videndum est nobis,  quos populus Romanus hoc in gradu collocavit, nisi ne quid privatis studiis  de opera publica detrahamus. Quod si, cum fungi munere debebamus, non modo  operam nostram numquam a populari coetu removimus, sed ne litteram quidem  ullam fecimus nisi forensem, quis reprehendet nostrum otium, qui in eo non  modo nosmet ipsos hebescere et languere nolumus, sed etiam ut plurimis  prosimus enitimur? Gloriam vero non modo non minui, sed etiam augeri  arbitramur eorum, quorum ad popularis illustrisque laudes has etiam minus  notas minusque pervolgatas adiungimus. 7. Sunt etiam qui negent in iis, qui  in nostris libris disputent, fuisse earum rerum, de quibus disputatur,  scientiam: qui mihi videntur non solum vivis, sed etiam mortuis invidere.    III. Restat unum genus reprehensorum, quibus Academiae ratio non probatur.  Quod gravius ferremus, si quisquam ullam disciplinam philosophiae probaret  praeter eam, quam ipse sequeretur. Nos autem, quoniam contra omnis dicere  quae videntur solemus, non possumus quin alii a nobis dissentiant recusare:  quamquam nostra quidem causa facilis est, qui verum invenire sine ulla  contentione volumus, idque summa cura studioque conquirimus. Etsi enim  omnis cognitio multis est obstructa difficultatibus eaque est et in ipsis  rebus obscuritas et in iudiciis nostris infirmitas, ut non sine causa  antiquissimi et doctissimi invenire se posse quod cuperent diffisi sint,  tamen nec illi defecerunt neque nos studium exquirendi defetigati  relinquemus, neque nostrae disputationes quicquam aliud agunt nisi ut in  utramque partem dicendo eliciant et tamquam exprimant aliquid, quod aut  verum sit aut ad id quam proxime accedat. 8. Neque inter nos et eos, qui se  scire arbitrantur, quicquam interest, nisi quod illi non dubitant quin ea  vera sint, quae defendunt: nos probabilia multa habemus, quae sequi facile,  adfirmare vix possumus. Hoc autem liberiores et solutiores sumus, quod  integra nobis est iudicandi potestas, nec ut omnia, quae praescripta et  quasi imperata sint, defendamus necessitate ulla cogimur. Nam ceteri primum  ante tenentur adstricti quam quid esset optimum iudicare potuerunt: deinde  infirmissimo tempore aetatis aut obsecuti amico cuidam aut una alicuius,  quem primum audierunt, oratione capti de rebus incognitis iudicant et, ad  quamcumque sunt disciplinam quasi tempestate delati, ad eam tamquam ad  saxum adhaerescunt. 9. Nam, quod dicunt omnino se credere ei, quem iudicent  fuisse sapientem, probarem, si id ipsum rudes et indocti iudicare  potuissent--statuere enim qui sit sapiens vel maxime videtur esse  sapientis--, sed ut potuerint, potuerunt omnibus rebus auditis, cognitis  etiam reliquorum sententiis, iudicaverunt autem re semel audita atque ad  unius se auctoritatem contulerunt.

At the time and upon the chosen spot, in the darkness of the  night and far removed from the habitation of any human soul, the wagon was  halted and the mob fired upon the six manacled men, shooting them to death  as no humane person would have shot dogs. Chained together as they were,  in their awful struggles after the first volley, the victims tumbled out  of the wagon upon the ground and there in the mud, struggling in their  death throes, the victims were made the target of the murderous shotguns,  which fired into the writhing, struggling, dying mass of humanity, until  every spark of life was gone. Then the officers of the law who had them in  charge, drove away to give the alarm and to tell the world that they had  been waylaid and their prisoners forcibly taken from them and killed.    It has been claimed that the prompt, vigorous and highly commendable steps  of the governor of the State of Tennessee and the judge having  jurisdiction over the crime, and of the citizens of Memphis generally, was  the natural revolt of the humane conscience in that section of the  country, and the determination of honest and honorable men to rid the  community of such men as those who were guilty of this terrible massacre.  It has further been claimed that this vigorous uprising of the people and  this most commendably prompt action of the civil authorities, is ample  proof that the American people will not tolerate the lynching of innocent  men, and that in cases where brutal lynchings have not been promptly dealt  with, the crimes on the part of the victims were such as to put them  outside the pale of humanity and that the world considered their death a  necessary sacrifice for the good of all.    But this line of argument can in no possible way be truthfully sustained.  The lynching of the six men in 1894, barbarous as it was, was in no way  more barbarous than took nothing more than a passing notice. It was only  the other lynchings which preceded it, and of which the public fact that  the attention of the civilized world has been called to lynching in  America which made the people of Tennessee feel the absolute necessity for  a prompt, vigorous and just arraignment of all the murderers connected  with that crime. Lynching is no longer \"Our Problem,\" it is the problem of  the civilized world, and Tennessee could not afford to refuse the legal  measures which Christianity demands shall be used for the punishment of  crime.      MEMPHIS THEN AND NOW    Only two years prior to the massacre of the six men near Memphis, that  same city took part in a massacre in every way as bloody and brutal as  that of September last. It was the murder of three young colored men and  who were known to be among the most honorable, reliable, worthy and  peaceable colored citizens of the community. All of them were engaged in  the mercantile business, being members of a corporation which conducted a  large grocery store, and one of the three being a letter carrier in the  employ of the government. These three men were arrested for resisting an  attack of a mob upon their store, in which melee none of the assailants,  who had armed themselves for their devilish deeds by securing court  processes, were killed or even seriously injured. But these three men were  put in jail, and on three or four nights after their incarceration a mob  of less than a dozen men, by collusion with the civil authorities, entered  the jail, took the three men from the custody of the law and shot them to  death. Memphis knew of this awful crime, knew then and knows today who the  men were who committed it, and yet not the first step was ever taken to  apprehend the guilty wretches who walk the streets today with the brand of  murder upon their foreheads, but as safe from harm as the most upright  citizen of that community. Memphis would have been just as calm and  complacent and self-satisfied over the murder of the six colored men in  1894 as it was over these three colored men in 1892, had it not recognized  the fact that to escape the brand of barbarism it had not only to speak  its denunciation but to act vigorously in vindication of its name.      AN ALABAMA HORROR IGNORED    A further instance of this absolute disregard of every principle of  justice and the indifference to the barbarism of Lynch Law may be cited  here, and is furnished by white residents in the city of Carrolton,  Alabama. Several cases of arson had been discovered, and in their search  for the guilty parties, suspicion was found to rest upon three men and a  woman. The four suspects were Paul Hill, Paul Archer, William Archer, his  brother, and a woman named Emma Fair. The prisoners were apprehended,  earnestly asserted their innocence, but went to jail without making any  resistance. They claimed that they could easily prove their innocence upon  trial.    One would suspect that the civilization which defends itself against the  barbarisms of Lynch Law by stating that it lynches human beings only when  they are guilty of awful attacks upon women and children, would have been  very careful to have given these four prisoners, who were simply charged  with arson, a fair trial, to which they were entitled upon every principle  of law and humanity. Especially would this seem to be the case when if is  considered that one of the prisoners charged was a woman, and if the  nineteenth century has shown any advancement upon any lines of human  action, it is preeminently shown in its reverence, respect and protection  of its womanhood. But the people of Alabama failed to have any regard for  womanhood whatever.    The three men and the woman were put in jail to await trial. A few days  later it was rumored that they were to be subjects of Lynch Law, and, sure  enough, at night a mob of lynchers went to the jail, not to avenge any  awful crime against womanhood, but to kill four people who had been  suspected of setting a house on fire. They were caged in their cells,  helpless and defenseless; they were at the mercy of civilized white  Americans, who, armed with shotguns, were there to maintain the majesty of  American law. And most effectively was their duty done by these splendid  representatives of Governor Fishback's brave and honorable white  southerners, who resent \"outside interference.\" They lined themselves up  in the most effective manner and poured volley after volley into the  bodies of their helpless, pleading victims, who in their bolted prison  cells could do nothing but suffer and die. Then these lynchers went  quietly away and the bodies of the woman and three men were taken out and  buried with as little ceremony as men would bury hogs.    No one will say that the massacre near Memphis in 1894 was any worse than  this bloody crime of Alabama in 1892. The details of this shocking affair  were given to the public by the press, but public sentiment was not moved  to action in the least; it was only a matter of a day's notice and then  went to swell the list of murders which stand charged against the noble,  Christian people of Alabama.      AMERICA AWAKENED    But there is now an awakened conscience throughout the land, and Lynch Law  can not flourish in the future as it has in the past. The close of the  year 1894 witnessed an aroused interest, an assertative humane principle  which must tend to the extirpation of that crime. The awful butchery last  mentioned failed to excite more than a passing comment In 1894, but far  different is it today. Gov. Jones, of Alabama, in 1893 dared to speak out  against the rule of the mob in no uncertain terms. His address indicated a  most helpful result of the present agitation. In face of the many denials  of the outrages on the one hand and apologies for lynchers on the other,  Gov. Jones admits the awful lawlessness charged and refuses to join in  the infamous plea made to condone the crime. No stronger nor more  effective words have been said than those following from Gov. Jones.      While the ability of the state to deal with open revolts against the    supremacy of its laws has been ably demonstrated, I regret that    deplorable acts of violence have been perpetrated, in at least four    instances, within the past two years by mobs, whose sudden work and    quick dispersions rendered it impossible to protect their victims.    Within the past two years nine prisoners, who were either in jail or in    the custody of the officers, have been taken from them without    resistance, and put to death. There was doubt of the guilt of the    defendants in most of these cases, and few of them were charged with    capital offenses. None of them involved the crime of rape. The largest    rewards allowed by law were offered for the apprehension of the    offenders, and officers were charged to a vigilant performance of their    duties, and aided in some instances by the services of skilled    detectives; but not a single arrest has been made and the grand juries    in these counties have returned no bills of indictment. This would    indicate either that local public sentiment approved these acts of    violence or was too weak to punish them, or that the officers charged    with that duty were in some way lacking in their performance. The evil    cannot be cured or remedied by silence as to its existence. Unchecked,    it will continue until it becomes a reproach to our good name, and a    menace to our prosperity and peace; and it behooves you to exhaust all    remedies within your power to find better preventives for such crimes.      A FRIENDLY WARNING    From England comes a friendly voice which must give to every patriotic  citizen food for earnese thought.

Porter, gives the American people a most  interesting review of the antilynching crusade"]]]
