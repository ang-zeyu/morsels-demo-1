And the Bogles  fetched a strange big stone and rolled it on top of her, to keep her  from rising. And they told two of the Will-o-the-wykes to take turns in  watching on the black snag, to see that she lay safe and still, and  couldn't get out to spoil their sport.    And there lay the poor Moon, dead and buried in the bog, till some one  would set her loose; and who'd know where to look for her.    Well, the days passed, and 't was the time for the new moon's coming,  and the folk put pennies in their pockets and straws in their caps so as  to be ready for her, and looked about, for the Moon was a good friend to  the marsh folk, and they were main glad when the dark time was gone, and  the paths were safe again, and the Evil Things were driven back by the  blessed Light into the darkness and the waterholes.    But days and days passed, and the new Moon never came, and the nights  were aye dark, and the Evil Things were worse than ever. And still the  days went on, and the new Moon never came. Naturally the poor folk were  strangely feared and mazed, and a lot of them went to the Wise Woman who  dwelt in the old mill, and asked if so be she could find out where the  Moon was gone.    \"Well,\" said she, after looking in the brewpot, and in the mirror, and  in the Book, \"it be main queer, but I can't rightly tell ye what's  happened to her. If ye hear of aught, come and tell me.\"    So they went their ways; and as days went by, and never a Moon came,  naturally they talked--my word! I reckon they _did_ talk! their tongues  wagged at home, and at the inn, and in the garth. But so came one day,  as they sat on the great settle in the Inn, a man from the far end of  the bog lands was smoking and listening, when all at once he sat up and  slapped his knee. \"My faicks!\" says he, \"I'd clean forgot, but I reckon  I kens where the Moon be!\" and he told them of how he was lost in the  bogs, and how, when he was nigh dead with fright, the light shone out,  and he found the path and got home safe.    So off they all went to the Wise Woman, and told her about it, and she  looked long in the pot and the Book again, and then she nodded her  head.    \"It's dark still, childer, dark!\" says she, \"and I can't rightly see,  but do as I tell ye, and ye 'll find out for yourselves. Go all of ye,  just afore the night gathers, put a stone in your mouth, and take a  hazel-twig in your hands, and say never a word till you're safe home  again. Then walk on and fear not, far into the midst of the marsh, till  ye find a coffin, a candle, and a cross. Then ye'll not be far from your  Moon; look, and m'appen ye 'll find her.\"    So came the next night in the darklings, out they went all together,  every man with a stone in his mouth, and a hazel-twig in his hand, and  feeling, thou may'st reckon, main feared and creepy. And they stumbled  and stottered along the paths into the midst of the bogs; they saw  nought, though they heard sighings and flutterings in their ears, and  felt cold wet fingers touching them; but all at once, looking around for  the coffin, the candle, and the cross, while they came nigh to the pool  beside the great snag, where the Moon lay buried. And all at once they  stopped, quaking and mazed and skeery, for there was the great stone,  half in, half out of the water, for all the world like a strange big  coffin; and at the head was the black snag, stretching out its two arms  in a dark gruesome cross, and on it a tiddy light flickered, like a  dying candle. And they all knelt down in the mud, and said, \"Our Lord,  first forward, because of the cross, and then backward, to keep off the  Bogles; but without speaking out, for they knew that the Evil Things  would catch them, if they didn't do as the Wise Woman told them.\"    Then they went nigher, and took hold of the big stone, and shoved it up,  and afterwards they said that for one tiddy minute they saw a strange  and beautiful face looking up at them glad-like out of the black water;  but the Light came so quick and so white and shining, that they stept  back mazed with it, and the very next minute, when they could see again,  there was the full Moon in the sky, bright and beautiful and kind as  ever, shining and smiling down at them, and making the bogs and the  paths as clear as day, and stealing into the very corners, as though  she'd have driven the darkness and the Bogles clean away if she could.          A Son of Adam      A man was one day working. It was very hot, and he was digging.  By-and-by he stopped to rest and wipe his face; and he was very angry to  think he had to work so hard only because of Adam's sin. So he  complained bitterly, and said some very hard words about Adam.    It happened that his master heard him, and he asked, \"Why do you blame  Adam? You'd ha' done just like Adam, if you'd a-been in his place.\"    \"No, I shouldn't,\" said the man; \"I should ha' know'd better.\"    \"Well, I'll try you,\" says his master; \"come to me at dinner-time.\"    So come dinner-time, the man came, and his master took him into a room  where the table was a-set with good things of all sorts. And he said:  \"Now, you can eat as much as ever you like from any of the dishes on the  table; but don't touch the covered dish in the middle till I come back.\"  And with that the master went out of the room and left the man there all  by himself.    So the man sat down and helped himself, and ate some o' this dish and  some o' that, and enjoyed himself finely. But after awhile, as his  master didn't come back, he began to look at the covered dish, and to  wonder whatever was in it. And he wondered more and more, and he says to  himself, \"It must be something very nice. Why shouldn't I just look at  it? I won't touch it. There can't be any harm in just peeping.\" So at  last he could hold back no longer, and he lifted up the cover a tiny  bit; but he couldn't see anything. Then he lifted it up a bit more, and  out popped a mouse. The man tried to catch it; but it ran away and  jumped off the table and he ran after it. It ran first into one corner,  and then, just as he thought he'd got it, into another, and under the  table, and all about the room. And the man made such a clatter, jumping  and banging and running round after the mouse, a-trying to catch it,  that at last his master came in.    \"Ah!\" he said; \"never you blame Adam again, my man!\"          The Children in the Wood           Now ponder well, you parents dear,         These words which I shall write;       A doleful story you shall hear,         In time brought forth to light.       A gentleman of good account,         In Norfolk dwelt of late,       Who did in honour far surmount         Most men of his estate.         Sore sick he was and like to die,         No help his life could save;       His wife by him as sick did lie,         And both possest one grave.       No love between these two was lost,         Each was to other kind;       In love they lived, in love they died,         And left two babes behind.         The one a fine and pretty boy         Not passing three years old,       The other a girl more young than he,         And framed in beauty's mould.       The father left his little son,         As plainly did appear,       When he to perfect age should come,         Three hundred pounds a year;         And to his little daughter Jane         Five hundred pounds in gold,       To be paid down on marriage-day,         Which might not be controlled.       But if the children chanced to die         Ere they to age should come,       Their uncle should possess their wealth;         For so the will did run.         \"Now, brother,\" said the dying man,         \"Look to my children dear;       Be good unto my boy and girl,         No friends else have they here;       To God and you I recommend         My children dear this day;       But little while be sure we have         Within this world to stay.         \"You must be father and mother both,         And uncle, all in one;       God knows what will become of them         When I am dead and gone.\"       With that bespake their mother dear:         \"O brother kind,\" quoth she,       \"You are the man must bring our babes         To wealth or misery.         \"And if you keep them carefully,         Then God will you reward;       But if you otherwise should deal,         God will your deeds regard.\"       With lips as cold as any stone,         They kissed their children small:       \"God bless you both, my children dear!\"         With that the tears did fall.         These speeches then their brother spake         To this sick couple there:       \"The keeping of your little ones,         Sweet sister, do not fear;       God never prosper me nor mine,         Nor aught else that I have,       If I do wrong your children dear         When you are laid in grave!\"         The parents being dead and gone,         The children home he takes,       And brings them straight unto his house         Where much of them he makes.       He had not kept these pretty babes         A twelvemonth and a day,       But, for their wealth, he did devise         To make them both away.         He bargained with two ruffians strong,         Which were of furious mood,       That they should take these children young,         And slay them in a wood.       He told his wife an artful tale         He would the children send       To be brought up in London town         With one that was his friend.         Away then went those pretty babes,         Rejoicing at that tide,       Rejoicing with a merry mind         They should on cock-horse ride.       They prate and prattle pleasantly,         As they ride on the way,       To those that should their butchers be         And work their lives' decay:         So that the pretty speech they had         "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14264"],[0,"The Practice and Science of Drawing (#15)"],[1," it  receives reflected light. Now, the greatest amount of reflected light  will come from the direction opposite to that of the direct light, as  all objects in this direction are strongly lit. The surface of the wall  between points E and H, being directly opposite the light, will give  most reflection. And between points 5 and 6 this light will be reflected  by the cone to the eye in its greatest intensity, since at these points  the angles of incidence equal the angles of reflection. The other parts  of the shadow will receive a certain amount of reflected light,  lessening in amount on either side of these points. We have now rays of  light coming to the eye from the cone between the extreme points 7 and  8. From 7 to 3 we have the light, including the half tones. Between 1  and 2 the high light. Between 3 and 8 the shadows, with the greatest  amount of reflected light between 5 and 6.    [Illustration: Plate XIX.    ILLUSTRATING CURVED LINKS SUGGESTING FULLNESS AND FORESHORTENING]    I should not have troubled the reader with this tedious diagram were it  not that certain facts about light and shade can be learned from it. The  first is that the high lights come much more within the edge of the  object than you would have expected. With the light directly opposite  point 7, one might have thought the highest light would have come there,  and that is where many students put it, until the loss of roundness in  the appearance of their work makes them look more carefully for its  position. So remember always to look out for high lights within the  contours of forms, not on the edges.    The next thing to notice is that #the darkest part of the shadow will  come nearest the lights between points 3 and 5#. This is the part turned  most away from the direction of the greatest amount of reflected light,  and therefore receiving least. The lightest part of the shadow will be  in the middle, rather towards the side away from the light, generally  speaking. The shadow cast on the ground will be dark, like the darkest  part of the shadow on the cone, as its surface is also turned away from  the chief source of reflected light.    Although the artist will very seldom be called upon to draw a cone, the  same principles of light and shade that are so clearly seen in such a  simple figure obtain throughout the whole of nature. This is why the  much abused drawing and shading from whitened blocks and pots is so  useful. Nothing so clearly impresses the general laws of light and shade  as this so-called dull study.    This lightening of shadows in the middle by reflected light and  darkening towards their edges is a very important thing to remember, the  heavy, smoky look students' early work is so prone to, being almost  entirely due to their neglect through ignorance of this principle.  Nothing is more awful than shadows darker in the middle and gradually  lighter towards their edges. Of course, where there is a deep hollow in  the shadow parts, as at the armpit and the fold at the navel in the  drawing on page 90 [Transcribers Note: Plate XVIII], you will get a  darker tone. But this does not contradict the principle that generally  shadows are lighter in the middle and darker towards the edges. Note the  luminous quality the observation of this principle gives the shadow on  the body of our demonstration drawing.    This is a crude statement of the general principles of light and shade  on a simple round object. In one with complex surfaces the varieties of  light and shade are infinite. But the same principles hold good. The  surfaces turned more to the source of light receive the greatest amount,  and are the lightest. And from these parts the amount of light lessens  through what are called the half tones as the surface turns more away,  until a point is reached where no more direct light is received, and the  shadows begin. And in the shadows the same law applies: those surfaces  turned most towards the source of reflected light will receive the most,  and the amount received will gradually lessen as the surface turns away,  until at the point immediately before where the half tones begin the  amount of reflected light will be very little, and in consequence the  darkest part of the shadows may be looked for. There may, of course, be  other sources of direct light on the shadow side that will entirely  alter and complicate the effect. Or one may draw in a wide, diffused  light, such as is found in the open air on a grey day; in which case  there will be little or no shadow, the modelling depending entirely on  degrees of light and half tone.    In studying the principles of simple light and shade it is advisable to  draw from objects of one local colour, such as white casts. In  parti-coloured objects the problem is complicated by the different tones  of the local colour. In line drawing it is as well to take as little  notice as possible of these variations which disturb the contemplation  of pure form and do not belong to the particular province of form  expression with which drawing is concerned.    Although one has selected a strong half light and half shade effect to  illustrate the general principles of light and shade, it is not  advisable in making line drawings to select such a position. A point of  view with a fairly wide light at your back is the best. In this position  little shadow will be seen, most of the forms being expressed by the  play of light and half tone. The contours, as they are turned away from  the light, will naturally be darker, and against a light background your  subject has an appearance with dark edges that is easily expressed by a  line drawing. Strong light and shade effects should be left for mass  drawing. You seldom see any shadows in Holbein's drawings; he seems to  have put his sitters near a wide window, close against which he worked.  Select also a background as near the tone of the highest light on the  object to be drawn as possible. This will show up clearly the contour.  In the case of a portrait drawing, a newspaper hung behind the head  answers very well and is always easily obtained. The tone of it can be  varied by the distance at which it is placed from the head, and by the  angle at which it is turned away from or towards the light.    Don't burden a line drawing with heavy half tones and shadows; keep them  light. The beauty that is the particular province of line drawing is the  beauty of contours, and this is marred by heavy light and shade. Great  draughtsmen use only just enough to express the form, but never to  attempt the expression of tone. Think of the half tones as part of the  lights and not as part of the shadows.    There are many different methods of drawing in line, and a student of  any originality will find one that suits his temperament. But I will try  and illustrate one that is at any rate logical, and that may serve as a  fair type of line drawing generally.    The appearance of an object is first considered as a series of contours,  some forming the boundaries of the form against the background, and  others the boundaries of the subordinate forms within these bounding  lines. The light and shade and differences of local colour (like the  lips, eyebrows, and eyes in a head) are considered together as tones of  varying degrees of lightness and darkness, and suggested by means of  lines drawn parallel across the drawing from left to right, and from  below upwards, or vice versa, darker and closer together when depth is  wanted, and fainter and further apart where delicacy is demanded, and  varying in thickness when gradation is needed. This rule of parallel  shading is broken only when strongly marked forms, such as the swing  lines of hair, a prominent bone or straining muscles, &c., demand it.  This parallel shading gives a great beauty of surface and fleshiness  to a drawing. The lines following, as it were, the direction of the  light across the object rather than the form, give a unity that has a  great charm. It is more suited to drawings where extreme delicacy of  form is desired, and is usually used in silver point work, a medium  capable of the utmost refinement.    [Illustration: Plate XX.    STUDY FOR THE FIGURE OF LOVE IN THE PICTURE \"LOVE LEAVING PSYCHE\"  ILLUSTRATING A METHOD OF DRAWING    The lines of shading following a convenient parallel direction unless  prominent forms demand otherwise.]    In this method the lines of shading not being much varied in direction  or curved at all, a minimum amount of that \"form stimulus\" is conveyed.  The curving of the lines in shading adds considerably to the force of  the relief, and suggests much stronger modelling. In the case of  foreshortened effects, where the forms are seen at their fullest,  arching one over the other, some curvature in the lines of shading is of  considerable advantage in adding to the foreshortened look.    Lines drawn down the forms give an appearance of great strength and  toughness, a tense look. And this quality is very useful in suggesting  such things as joints and sinews, rocks, hard ground, or gnarled  tree-trunks, &c. In figure drawing it is an interesting quality to use  sparingly, with the shading done on the across-the-form principle; and  to suggest a difference of texture or a straining of the form. Lines of  shading drawn in every direction, crossing each other and resolving  themselves into tone effects, suggest atmosphere and the absence of  surface form. This is more often used in the backgrounds of pen and ink  work and is seldom necessary in pencil or chalk drawing, as they are  more concerned with form than atmosphere. Pen and ink is more often used  for elaborate pictorial effects in illustration work, owing to the ease  with which it can be reproduced and printed; and it is here that one  more often finds this muddled quality of line spots being used to fill  up interstices and make the tone even.
