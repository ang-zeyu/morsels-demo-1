He promised to meet them at the church porch exactly at nine o'clock,  and matters were all arranged, and Henry waited with much eagerness and  anxiety now for the coming night, which he hoped would dissipate one of  the fearful deductions which his imagination had drawn from recent  circumstances.    He gave to Flora a pair of pistols of his own, upon which he knew he  could depend, and he took good care to load them well, so that there  could be no likelihood whatever of their missing fire at a critical  moment.    \"Now, Flora,\" he said, \"I have seen you use fire-arms when you were much  younger than you are now, and therefore I need give you no instructions.  If any intruder does come, and you do fire, be sure you take a good aim,  and shoot low.\"    \"I will, Henry, I will; and you will be back in two hours?\"    \"Most assuredly I will.\"    The day wore on, evening came, and then deepened into night. It turned  out to be a cloudy night, and therefore the moon's brilliance was  nothing near equal to what it had been on the preceding night Still,  however, it had sufficient power over the vapours that frequently  covered it for many minutes together, to produce a considerable light  effect upon the face of nature, and the night was consequently very far,  indeed, from what might be called a dark one.    George, Henry, and Marchdale, met in one of the lower rooms of the  house, previous to starting upon their expedition; and after satisfying  themselves that they had with them all the tools that were necessary,  inclusive of the same small, but well-tempered iron crow-bar with which  Marchdale had, on the night of the visit of the vampyre, forced open the  door of Flora's chamber, they left the hall, and proceeded at a rapid  pace towards the church.    \"And Flora does not seem much alarmed,\" said Marchdale, \"at being left  alone?\"    \"No,\" replied Henry, \"she has made up her mind with a strong natural  courage which I knew was in her disposition to resist as much as  possible the depressing effects of the awful visitation she has  endured.\"    \"It would have driven some really mad.\"    \"It would, indeed; and her own reason tottered on its throne, but, thank  Heaven, she has recovered.\"    \"And I fervently hope that, through her life,\" added Marchdale, \"she may  never have such another trial.\"    \"We will not for a moment believe that such a thing can occur twice.\"    \"She is one among a thousand. Most young girls would never at all have  recovered the fearful shock to the nerves.\"    \"Not only has she recovered,\" said Henry, \"but a spirit, which I am  rejoiced to see, because it is one which will uphold her, of resistance  now possesses her.\"    \"Yes, she actually--I forgot to tell you before--but she actually asked  me for arms to resist any second visitation.\"    \"You much surprise me.\"    \"Yes, I was surprised, as well as pleased, myself.\"    \"I would have left her one of my pistols had I been aware of her having  made such a request. Do you know if she can use fire-arms?\"    \"Oh, yes; well.\"    \"What a pity. I have them both with me.\"    \"Oh, she is provided.\"    \"Provided?\"    \"Yes; I found some pistols which I used to take with me on the  continent, and she has them both well loaded, so that if the vampyre  makes his appearance, he is likely to meet with rather a warm  reception.\"    \"Good God! was it not dangerous?\"    \"Not at all, I think.\"    \"Well, you know best, certainly, of course. I hope the vampyre may come,  and that we may have the pleasure, when we return, of finding him dead.  By-the-bye, I--I--. Bless me, I have forgot to get the materials for  lights, which I pledged myself to do.\"    \"How unfortunate.\"    \"Walk on slowly, while I run back and get them.\"    \"Oh, we are too far--\"    \"Hilloa!\" cried a man at this moment, some distance in front of them.    \"It is Mr. Chillingworth,\" said Henry.    \"Hilloa,\" cried the worthy doctor again. \"Is that you, my friend, Henry  Bannerworth?\"    \"It is,\" cried Henry.    Mr. Chillingworth now came up to them and said,--    \"I was before my time, so rather than wait at the church porch, which  would have exposed me to observation perhaps, I thought it better to  walk on, and chance meeting with you.\"    \"You guessed we should come this way?'    \"Yes, and so it turns out, really. It is unquestionably your most direct  route to the church.\"    \"I think I will go back,\" said Mr Marchdale.    \"Back!\" exclaimed the doctor; \"what for?\"    \"I forgot the means of getting lights. We have candles, but no means of  lighting them.\"    \"Make yourselves easy on that score,\" said Mr. Chillingworth. \"I am  never without some chemical matches of my own manufacture, so that as  you have the candles, that can be no bar to our going on a once.\"    \"That is fortunate,\" said Henry.    \"Very,\" added Marchdale; \"for it seems a mile's hard walking for me, or  at least half a mile from the hall. Let us now push on.\"    They did push on, all four walking at a brisk pace. The church, although  it belonged to the village, was not in it. On the contrary, it was  situated at the end of a long lane, which was a mile nearly from the  village, in the direction of the hall, therefore, in going to it from  the hall, that amount of distance was saved, although it was always  called and considered the village church.    It stood alone, with the exception of a glebe house and two cottages,  that were occupied by persons who held situations about the sacred  edifice, and who were supposed, being on the spot, to keep watch and  ward over it.    It was an ancient building of the early English style of architecture,  or rather Norman, with one of those antique, square, short towers, built  of flint stones firmly embedded in cement, which, from time, had  acquired almost the consistency of stone itself. There were numerous  arched windows, partaking something of the more florid gothic style,  although scarcely ornamental enough to be called such. The edifice stood  in the centre of a grave-yard, which extended over a space of about half  an acre, and altogether it was one of the prettiest and most rural old  churches within many miles of the spot.    Many a lover of the antique and of the picturesque, for it was both,  went out of his way while travelling in the neighbourhood to look at it,  and it had an extensive and well-deserved reputation as a fine specimen  of its class and style of building.    In Kent, to the present day, are some fine specimens of the old Roman  style of church, building; and, although they are as rapidly pulled down  as the abuse of modern architects, and the cupidity of speculators, and  the vanity of clergymen can possibly encourage, in older to erect  flimsy, Italianised structures in their stead, yet sufficient of them  remain dotted over England to interest the traveller. At Walesden there  is a church of this description which will well repay a visit. This,  then, was the kind of building into which it was the intention of our  four friends to penetrate, not on an unholy, or an unjustifiable errand,  but on one which, proceeding from good and proper motives, it was highly  desirable to conduct in as secret a manner as possible.    The moon was more densely covered by clouds than it had yet been that  evening, when they reached the little wicket-gate which led into the  churchyard, through which was a regularly used thoroughfare.    \"We have a favourable night,\" remarked Henry, \"for we are not so likely  to be disturbed.\"    \"And now, the question is, how are we to get in?\" said Mr.  Chillingworth, as he paused, and glanced up at the ancient building.    \"The doors,\" said George, \"would effectually resist us.\"    \"How can it be done, then?\"    \"The only way I can think of,\" said Henry, \"is to get out one of the  small diamond-shaped panes of glass from one of the low windows, and  then we can one of us put in our hands, and undo the fastening, which is  very simple, when the window opens like a door, and it is but a step  into the church.\"    \"A good way,\" said Marchdale. \"We will lose no time.\"    They walked round the church till they came to a very low window indeed,  near to an angle of the wall, where a huge abutment struck far out into  the burial-ground.    \"Will you do it, Henry?\" said George.    \"Yes. I have often noticed the fastenings. Just give me a slight hoist  up, and all will be right.\"    George did so, and Henry with his knife easily bent back some of the  leadwork which held in one of the panes of glass, and then got it out  whole. He handed it down to George, saying,--    \"Take this, George. We can easily replace it when we leave, so that  there can be no signs left of any one having been here at all.\"    George took the piece of thick, dim-coloured glass, and in another  moment Henry had succeeded in opening the window, and the mode of  ingress to the old church was fair and easy before them all, had there  been ever so many.    \"I wonder,\" said Marchdale, \"that a place so inefficiently protected has  never been robbed.\"    \"No wonder at all,\" remarked Mr. Chillingworth. \"There is nothing to  take that I am aware of that would repay anybody the trouble of taking.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"Not an article. The pulpit, to be sure, is covered with faded velvet;  but beyond that, and an old box, in which I believe nothing is left but  some books, I think there is no temptation.\"    \"And that, Heaven knows, is little enough, then.\"    \"Come on,\" said Henry. \"Be careful; there is nothing beneath the window,  and the depth is about two feet.\"    Thus guided, they all got fairly into the sacred edifice, and then Henry  closed the window, and fastened it on the inside as he said,--    \"We have nothing to do now but to set to work opening a way into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1484"],[0,"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (#15)"],[1,"of the Hartrotts was in keeping with these new  relationships. In the home in Berlin, the servants wore knee-breeches  and white wigs on the nights of great banquets. Karl had bought an old  castle with pointed towers, ghosts in the cellars, and various legends  of assassinations, assaults and abductions which enlivened its history  in an interesting way. An architect, decorated with many foreign orders,  and bearing the title of \"Councillor of Construction,\" was engaged  to modernize the mediaeval edifice without sacrificing its terrifying  aspect. The Romantica described in anticipation the receptions in the  gloomy salon, the light diffused by electricity, simulating torches,  the crackling of the emblazoned hearth with its imitation logs bristling  with flames of gas, all the splendor of modern luxury combined with the  souvenirs of an epoch of omnipotent nobility--the best, according to  her, in history. And the hunting parties, the future hunting parties!  . . . in an annex of sandy and loose soil with pine woods--in no way  comparable to the rich ground of their native ranch, but which had the  honor of being trodden centuries ago by the Princes of Brandenburg,  founders of the reigning house of Prussia. And all this advancement in a  single year! . . .    They had, of course, to compete with other oversea families who had  amassed enormous fortunes in the United States, Brazil or the Pacific  coast; but these were Germans \"without lineage,\" coarse plebeians who  were struggling in vain to force themselves into the great world by  making donations to the imperial works. With all their millions, the  very most that they could ever hope to attain would be to marry their  daughters with ordinary soldiers. Whilst Karl! . . . The relatives of  Karl! . . . and the Romantica let her pen run on, glorifying a family in  whose bosom she fancied she had been born.    From time to time were enclosed with Elena's effusions brief, crisp  notes directed to Desnoyers. The brother-in-law continued giving an  account of his operations the same as when living on the ranch under  his protection. But with this deference was now mixed a badly concealed  pride, an evident desire to retaliate for his times of voluntary  humiliation. Everything that he was doing was grand and glorious. He had  invested his millions in the industrial enterprises of modern Germany.  He was stockholder of munition factories as big as towns, and of  navigation companies launching a ship every half year. The Emperor was  interesting himself in these works, looking benevolently on all those  who wished to aid him. Besides this, Karl was buying land. At first  sight, it seemed foolish to have sold the fertile fields of their  inheritance in order to acquire sandy Prussian wastes that yielded only  to much artificial fertilizing; but by becoming a land owner, he now  belonged to the \"Agrarian Party,\" the aristocratic and conservative  group par excellence, and thus he was living in two different but  equally distinguished worlds--that of the great industrial friends  of the Emperor, and that of the Junkers, knights of the countryside,  guardians of the old traditions and the supply-source of the officials  of the King of Prussia.    On hearing of these social strides, Desnoyers could not but think of the  pecuniary sacrifices which they must represent. He knew Karl's past,  for on the ranch, under an impulse of gratitude, the German had one day  revealed to the Frenchman the cause of his coming to America. He was  a former officer in the German army, but the desire of living  ostentatiously without other resources than his salary, had dragged him  into committing such reprehensible acts as abstracting funds belonging  to the regiment, incurring debts of honor and paying for them with  forged signatures. These crimes had not been officially prosecuted  through consideration of his father's memory, but the members of his  division had submitted him to a tribunal of honor. His brothers and  friends had advised him to shoot himself as the only remedy; but  he loved life and had fled to South America where, in spite of  humiliations, he had finally triumphed.    Wealth effaces the spots of the past even more rapidly than Time. The  news of his fortune on the other side of the ocean made his family give  him a warm reception on his first voyage home; introducing him again  into their world. Nobody could remember shameful stories about a few  hundred marks concerning a man who was talking about his father-in-law's  lands, more extensive than many German principalities. Now, upon  installing himself definitely in his country, all was forgotten. But,  oh, the contributions levied upon his vanity . . . Desnoyers shrewdly  guessed at the thousands of marks poured with both hands into the  charitable works of the Empress, into the imperialistic propagandas,  into the societies of veterans, into the clubs of aggression and  expansion organized by German ambition.    The frugal Frenchman, thrifty in his expenditures and free from social  ambitions, smiled at the grandeurs of his brother-in-law. He considered  Karl an excellent companion although of a childish pride. He recalled  with satisfaction the years that they had passed together in the  country. He could not forget the German who was always hovering around  him, affectionate and submissive as a younger brother. When his family  commented with a somewhat envious vivacity upon the glories of their  Berlin relatives, Desnoyers would say smilingly, \"Leave them in peace;  they are paying very dear for their whistle.\"    But the enthusiasm which the letters from Germany breathed finally  created an atmosphere of disquietude and rebellion. Chichi led the  attack. Why were they not going to Europe like other folks? all their  friends had been there. Even the Italian and Spanish shopkeepers were  making the voyage, while she, the daughter of a Frenchman, had never  seen Paris! . . . Oh, Paris. The doctors in attendance on melancholy  ladies were announcing the existence of a new and terrible disease, \"the  mania for Paris.\" Dona Luisa supported her daughter. Why had she not  gone to live in Europe like her sister, since she was the richer of the  two? Even Julio gravely declared that in the old world he could study to  better advantage. America is not the land of the learned.    Infected by the general unrest, the father finally began to wonder  why the idea of going to Europe had not occurred to him long before.  Thirty-four years without going to that country which was not his!  . . . It was high time to start! He was living too near to his business. In  vain the retired ranchman had tried to keep himself indifferent to the  money market. Everybody was coining money around him. In the club, in  the theatre, wherever he went, the people were talking about purchases  of lands, of sales of stock, of quick negotiations with a triple profit,  of portentous balances. The amount of money that he was keeping idle in  the banks was beginning to weigh upon him. He finally ended by involving  himself in some speculation; like a gambler who cannot see the roulette  wheel without putting his hand in his pocket.    His family was right. \"To Paris!\" For in the Desnoyers' mind, to go to  Europe meant, of course, to go to Paris. Let the \"aunt from Berlin\" keep  on chanting the glories of her husband's country! \"It's sheer nonsense!\"  exclaimed Julio who had made grave geographical and ethnic comparisons  in his nightly forays. \"There is no place but Paris!\" Chichi saluted  with an ironical smile the slightest doubt of it--\"Perhaps they make as  elegant fashions in Germany as in Paris? . . . Bah!\" Dona Luisa took up  her children's cry. \"Paris!\" . . . Never had it even occurred to her to  go to a Lutheran land to be protected by her sister.    \"Let it be Paris, then!\" said the Frenchman, as though he were speaking  of an unknown city.    He had accustomed himself to believe that he would never return to it.  During the first years of his life in America, the trip would have been  an impossibility because of the military service which he had evaded.  Then he had vague news of different amnesties. After the time for  conscription had long since passed, an inertness of will had made him  consider a return to his country as somewhat absurd and useless. On the  other side, nothing remained to attract him. He had even lost track of  those country relatives with whom his mother had lived. In his heaviest  hours he had tried to occupy his activity by planning an enormous  mausoleum, all of marble, in La Recoleta, the cemetery of the rich,  in order to move thither the remains of Madariaga as founder of the  dynasty, following him with all his own when their hour should come.  He was beginning to feel the weight of age. He was nearly seventy years  old, and the rude life of the country, the horseback rides in the rain,  the rivers forded upon his swimming horse, the nights passed in the open  air, had brought on a rheumatism that was torturing his best days.    His family, however, reawakened his enthusiasm. \"To Paris!\" . . . He  began to fancy that he was twenty again, and forgetting his habitual  parsimony, wished his household to travel like royalty, in the most  luxurious staterooms, and with personal servants. Two copper-hued  country girls, born on the ranch and elevated to the rank of maids  to the senora and her daughter, accompanied them on the voyage, their  oblique eyes betraying not the slightest astonishment before the  greatest novelties.    Once in Paris, Desnoyers found himself quite bewildered. He confused  the names of streets, proposed visits to buildings which had long since  disappeared, and all his attempts to prove himself an expert authority  on Paris were attended with disappointment. His children, guided by  recent reading up, knew Paris better than he. He was considered  a foreigner in his own country. "]]]
