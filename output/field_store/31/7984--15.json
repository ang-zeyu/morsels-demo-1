The smith, leaning with his hammer upon the anvil, listened to them as  they described the weapons.    \"Nay, nay, Master Myles,\" said he, when Myles had ended by telling the  use to which he intended putting them. \"Thou art going all wrong in this  matter. With such blades, ere this battle is ended, some one would be  slain, and so murder done. Then the family of him who was killed would  haply have ye cited, and mayhap it might e'en come to the hanging, for  some of they boys ha' great folkeys behind them. Go ye to Tom Fletcher,  Master Myles, and buy of him good yew staves, such as one might break a  head withal, and with them, gin ye keep your wits, ye may hold your own  against knives or short swords. I tell thee, e'en though my trade be  making of blades, rather would I ha' a good stout cudgel in my hand than  the best dagger that ever was forged.\"    Myles stood thoughtfully for a moment or two; then, looking up,  \"Methinks thou speaketh truly, Robin,\" said he; \"and it were ill done to  have blood upon our hands.\"        CHAPTER 15    From the long, narrow stone-paved Armory Court, and connecting it with  the inner Buttery Court, ran a narrow arched passage-way, in which was  a picket-gate, closed at night and locked from within. It was in this  arched passage-way that, according to little Robert Ingoldsby's report,  the bachelors were lying in wait for Myles. Gascoyne's plan was that  Myles should enter the court alone, the Knights of the Rose lying  ambushed behind the angle of the armory building until the bachelors  should show themselves.    It was not without trepidation that Myles walked alone into the court,  which happened then to be silent and empty. His heart beat more quickly  than it was wont, and he gripped his cudgel behind his back, looking  sharply this way and that, so as not to be taken unawares by a flank  movement of his enemies. Midway in the court he stopped and hesitated  for a moment; then he turned as though to enter the armory. The next  moment he saw the bachelors come pouring out from the archway.    Instantly he turned and rushed back towards where his friends lay  hidden, shouting: \"To the rescue! To the rescue!\"    \"Stone him!\" roared Blunt. \"The villain escapes!\"    He stopped and picked up a cobble-stone as he spoke, flinging it after  his escaping prey. It narrowly missed Myles's head; had it struck him,  there might have been no more of this story to tell.    \"To the rescue! To the rescue!\" shouted Myles's friends in answer, and  the next moment he was surrounded by them. Then he turned, and swinging  his cudgel, rushed back upon his foes.    The bachelors stopped short at the unexpected sight of the lads with  their cudgels. For a moment they rallied and drew their knives; then  they turned and fled towards their former place of hiding.    One of them turned for a moment, and flung his knife at Myles with a  deadly aim; but Myles, quick as a cat, ducked his body, and the weapon  flew clattering across the stony court. Then he who had flung it turned  again to fly, but in his attempt he had delayed one instant too long.  Myles reached him with a long-arm stroke of his cudgel just as he  entered the passage-way, knocking him over like a bottle, stunned and  senseless.    The next moment the picket-gate was banged in their faces and the bolt  shot in the staples, and the Knights of the Rose were left shouting and  battering with their cudgels against the palings.    By this time the uproar of fight had aroused those in the rooms and  offices fronting upon the Armory Court; heads were thrust from many of  the windows with the eager interest that a fight always evokes.    \"Beware!\" shouted Myles. \"Here they come again!\" He bore back towards  the entrance of the alley-way as he spoke, those behind him scattering  to right and left, for the bachelors had rallied, and were coming again  to the attack, shouting.    They were not a moment too soon in this retreat, either, for the next  instant the pickets flew open, and a volley of stones flew after the  retreating Knights of the Rose. One smote Wilkes upon the head,  knocking him down headlong. Another struck Myles upon his left shoulder,  benumbing his arm from the finger-tips to the armpit, so that he thought  at first the limb was broken.    \"Get ye behind the buttresses!\" shouted those who looked down upon the  fight from the windows--\"get ye behind the buttresses!\" And in answer  the lads, scattering like a newly-flushed covey of partridges, fled  to and crouched in the sheltering angles of masonry to escape from the  flying stones.    And now followed a lull in the battle, the bachelors fearing to leave  the protection of the arched passage-way lest their retreat should be  cut off, and the Knights of the Rose not daring to quit the shelter of  the buttresses and angles of the wall lest they should be knocked down  by the stones.    The bachelor whom Myles had struck down with his cudgel was sitting up  rubbing the back of his head, and Wilkes had gathered his wits enough to  crawl to the shelter of the nearest buttress. Myles, peeping around the  corner behind which he stood, could see that the bachelors were gathered  into a little group consulting together. Suddenly it broke asunder, and  Blunt turned around.    \"Ho, Falworth!\" he cried. \"Wilt thou hold truce whiles we parley with  ye?\"    \"Aye,\" answered Myles.    \"Wilt thou give me thine honor that ye will hold your hands from harming  us whiles we talk together?\"    \"Yea,\" said Myles, \"I will pledge thee mine honor.\"    \"I accept thy pledge. See! here we throw aside our stones and lay  down our knives. Lay ye by your clubs, and meet us in parley at the  horse-block yonder.\"    \"So be it,\" said Myles, and thereupon, standing his cudgel in the angle  of the wall, he stepped boldly out into the open court-yard. Those of  his party came scatteringly from right and left, gathering about him;  and the bachelors advanced in a body, led by the head squire.    \"Now what is it thou wouldst have, Walter Blunt?\" said Myles, when both  parties had met at the horse-block.    \"It is to say this to thee, Myles Falworth,\" said the other. \"One time,  not long sin, thou didst challenge me to meet thee hand to hand in the  dormitory. Then thou didst put a vile affront upon me, for the which I  ha' brought on this battle to-day, for I knew not then that thou wert  going to try thy peasant tricks of wrestling, and so, without guarding  myself, I met thee as thou didst desire.\"    \"But thou hadst thy knife, and would have stabbed him couldst thou ha'  done so,\" said Gascoyne.    \"Thou liest!\" said Blunt. \"I had no knife.\" And then, without giving  time to answer, \"Thou canst not deny that I met thee then at thy  bidding, canst thou, Falworth?\"    \"Nay,\" said Myles, \"nor haply canst thou deny it either.\" And at this  covert reminder of his defeat Myles's followers laughed scoffingly and  Blunt bit his lip.    \"Thou hast said it,\" said he. \"Then sin. I met thee at thy bidding,  I dare to thee to meet me now at mine, and to fight this battle out  between our two selves, with sword and buckler and bascinet as gentles  should, and not in a wrestling match like two country hodges.\"    \"Thou art a coward caitiff, Walter Blunt!\" burst out Wilkes, who stood  by with a swelling lump upon his head, already as big as a walnut. \"Well  thou knowest that Falworth is no match for thee at broadsword play. Is  he not four years younger than thou, and hast thou not had three times  the practice in arms that he hath had? I say thou art a coward to seek  to fight with cutting weapons.\"    Blunt made no answer to Wilkes's speech, but gazed steadfastly at Myles,  with a scornful smile curling the corners of his lips. Myles stood  looking upon the ground without once lifting his eyes, not knowing what  to answer, for he was well aware that he was no match for Blunt with the  broadsword.    \"Thou art afraid to fight me, Myles Falworth,\" said Blunt, tauntingly,  and the bachelors gave a jeering laugh in echo.    Then Myles looked up, and I cannot say that his face was not a trifle  whiter than usual. \"Nay,\" said he, \"I am not afraid, and I will fight  thee, Blunt.\"    \"So be it,\" said Blunt. \"Then let us go at it straightway in the armory  yonder, for they be at dinner in the Great Hall, and just now there  be'st no one by to stay us.\"    \"Thou shalt not fight him, Myles!\" burst out Gascoyne. \"He will murther  thee! Thou shalt not fight him, I say!\"    Myles turned away without answering him.    \"What is to do?\" called one of those who were still looking out of the  windows as the crowd of boys passed beneath.    \"Blunt and Falworth are going to fight it out hand to hand in the  armory,\" answered one of the bachelors, looking up.    The brawling of the squires was a jest to all the adjoining part of the  house. So the heads were withdrawn again, some laughing at the \"sparring  of the cockerels.\"    But it was no jesting matter to poor Myles.        CHAPTER 16    I have no intention to describe the fight between Myles Falworth and  Walter Blunt. Fisticuffs of nowadays are brutal and debasing enough, but  a fight with a sharp-edged broadsword was not only brutal and debasing,  but cruel and bloody as well.    From the very first of the fight Myles Falworth was palpably and  obviously overmatched. After fifteen minutes had passed, Blunt stood  hale and sound as at first; but poor Myles had more than one red stain  of warm blood upon doublet and hose, and more than one bandage had been  wrapped by Gascoyne and Wilkes about sore wounds.    He had received no serious injury as yet, for not only was his body  protected by a buckler, or small oblong shield, which he carried upon  his left arm, and his head by a bascinet, or light helmet of steel, but  perhaps, after all, Blunt was not over-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15580"],[0,"The Rustlers of Pecos County (#15)"],[1,"he had any respect for Steele as a man or as a Ranger.    \"Steele, that was the second break of yours last night,\" he said  finally. \"If you come fooling round the ranch again there'll be hell!\"    It seemed strange that a man who had lived west of the Pecos for ten  years could not see in Steele something which forbade that kind of talk.    It certainly was not nerve Wright showed; men of courage were seldom  intolerant; and with the matchless nerve that characterized Steele or  the great gunmen of the day there went a cool, unobtrusive manner, a  speech brief, almost gentle, certainly courteous. Wright was a  hot-headed Louisianian of French extraction; a man evidently who had  never been crossed in anything, and who was strong, brutal, passionate,  which qualities, in the face of a situation like this, made him simply a  fool!    The way Steele looked at Wright was joy to me. I hated this smooth,  dark-skinned Southerner. But, of course, an ordinary affront like  Wright's only earned silence from Steele.    \"I'm thinking you used your Ranger bluff just to get near Diane  Sampson,\" Wright sneered. \"Mind you, if you come up there again there'll  be hell!\"    \"You're damn right there'll be hell!\" retorted Steele, a kind of high  ring in his voice. I saw thick, dark red creep into his face.    Had Wright's incomprehensible mention of Diane Sampson been an instinct  of love--of jealousy? Verily, it had pierced into the depths of the  Ranger, probably as no other thrust could have.    \"Diane Sampson wouldn't stoop to know a dirty blood-tracker like  you,\" said Wright hotly. His was not a deliberate intention to rouse  Steele; the man was simply rancorous. \"I'll call you right, you cheap  bluffer! You four-flush! You damned interfering conceited Ranger!\"    Long before Wright ended his tirade Steele's face had lost the tinge of  color, so foreign to it in moments like this; and the cool shade, the  steady eyes like ice on fire, the ruthless lips had warned me, if they  had not Wright.    \"Wright, I'll not take offense, because you seem to be championing your  beautiful cousin,\" replied Steele in slow speech, biting. \"But let me  return your compliment. You're a fine Southerner! Why, you're only a  cheap four-flush--damned bull-headed--_rustler_\"    Steele hissed the last word. Then for him--for me--for Hoden--there was  the truth in Wright's working passion-blackened face.    Wright jerked, moved, meant to draw. But how slow! Steele lunged  forward. His long arm swept up.    And Wright staggered backward, knocking table and chairs, to fall hard,  in a half-sitting posture, against the wall.    \"Don't draw!\" warned Steele.    \"Wright, get away from your gun!\" yelled the cowboy Brick.    But Wright was crazed by fury. He tugged at his hip, his face corded  with purple welts, malignant, murderous, while he got to his feet.    I was about to leap through the door when Steele shot. Wright's gun went  ringing to the floor.    Like a beast in pain Wright screamed. Frantically he waved a limp arm,  flinging blood over the white table-cloths. Steele had crippled him.    \"Here, you cowboy,\" ordered Steele; \"take him out, quick!\"    Brick saw the need of expediency, if Wright did not realize it, and he  pulled the raving man out of the place. He hurried Wright down the  street, leaving the horses behind.    Steele calmly sheathed his gun.    \"Well, I guess that opens the ball,\" he said as I came out.    Hoden seemed fascinated by the spots of blood on the table-cloths. It  was horrible to see him rubbing his hands there like a ghoul!    \"I tell you what, fellows,\" said Steele, \"we've just had a few pleasant  moments with the man who has made it healthy to keep close-mouthed in  Linrock.\"    Hoden lifted his shaking hands.    \"What'd you wing him for?\" he wailed. \"He was drawin' on you. Shootin'  arms off men like him won't do out here.\"    I was inclined to agree with Hoden.    \"That bull-headed fool will roar and butt himself with all his gang  right into our hands. He's just the man I've needed to meet. Besides,  shooting him would have been murder for me!\"    \"Murder!\" exclaimed Hoden.    \"He was a fool, and slow at that. Under such circumstances could I kill  him when I didn't have to?\"    \"Sure it'd been the trick.\" declared Jim positively. \"I'm not allowin'  for whether he's really a rustler or not. It just won't do, because  these fellers out here ain't goin' to be afraid of you.\"    \"See here, Hoden. If a man's going to be afraid of me at all, that trick  will make him more afraid of me. I know it. It works out. When Wright  cools down he'll remember, he'll begin to think, he'll realize that I  could more easily have killed him than risk a snapshot at his arm. I'll  bet you he goes pale to the gills next time he even sees me.\"    \"That may be true, Steele. But if Wright's the man you think he is he'll  begin that secret underground bizness. It's been tolerable healthy these  last six months. You can gamble on this. If thet secret work does  commence you'll have more reason to suspect Wright. I won't feel very  safe from now on.    \"I heard you call him rustler. He knows thet. Why, Wright won't sleep at  night now. He an' Sampson have always been after me.\"    \"Hoden, what are your eyes for?\" demanded Steele. \"Watch out. And now  here. See your friend Morton. Tell him this game grows hot. Together you  approach four or five men you know well and can absolutely trust.    \"Hello, there's somebody coming. You meet Russ and me to-night, out in  the open a quarter of a mile, straight from the end of this street.  You'll find a pile of stones. Meet us there to-night at ten o'clock.\"    The next few days, for the several hours each day that I was in town, I  had Steele in sight all the time or knew that he was safe under cover.    Nothing happened. His presence in the saloons or any place where men  congregated was marked by a certain uneasy watchfulness on the part of  almost everybody, and some amusement on the part of a few.    It was natural to suppose that the lawless element would rise up in a  mass and slay Steele on sight. But this sort of thing never happened. It  was not so much that these enemies of the law awaited his next move, but  just a slowness peculiar to the frontier.    The ranger was in their midst. He was interesting, if formidable. He  would have been welcomed at card tables, at the bars, to play and drink  with the men who knew they were under suspicion.    There was a rude kind of good humor even in their open hostility.    Besides, one Ranger, or a company of Rangers could not have held the  undivided attention of these men from their games and drinks and  quarrels except by some decided move. Excitement, greed, appetite were  rife in them.    I marked, however, a striking exception to the usual run of strangers I  had been in the habit of seeing. The Sneckers had gone or were under  cover. Again I caught a vague rumor of the coming of Jack Blome, yet he  never seemed to arrive.    Moreover, the goings-on among the habitues of the resorts and the  cowboys who came in to drink and gamble were unusually mild in  comparison with former conduct.    This lull, however, did not deceive Steele and me. It could not last.  The wonder was that it had lasted so long.    There was, of course, no post office in Linrock. A stage arrived twice  a week from Sanderson, if it did not get held up on the way, and the  driver usually had letters, which he turned over to the elderly keeper  of a little store.    This man's name was Jones, and everybody liked him. On the evenings the  stage arrived there was always a crowd at his store, which fact was a  source of no little revenue to him.    One night, so we ascertained, after the crowd had dispersed, two thugs  entered his store, beat the old man and robbed him. He made no  complaint; however, when Steele called him he rather reluctantly gave  not only descriptions of his assailants, but their names.    Steele straightaway went in search of the men and came across them in  Lerett's place. I was around when it happened.    Steele strode up to a table which was surrounded by seven or eight men  and he tapped Sim Bass on the shoulder.    \"Get up, I want you,\" he said.    Bass looked up only to see who had accosted him.    \"The hell you say!\" he replied impudently.    Steele's big hand shifted to the fellow's collar. One jerk, seemingly no  effort at all, sent Bass sliding, chair and all, to crash into the bar  and fall in a heap. He lay there, wondering what had struck him.    \"Miller, I want you. Get up,\" said Steele.    Miller complied with alacrity. A sharp kick put more life and  understanding into Bass.    Then Steele searched these men right before the eyes of their comrades,  took what money and weapons they had, and marched them out, followed by  a crowd that gathered more and more to it as they went down the street.  Steele took his prisoners into Jones' store, had them identified;  returned the money they had stolen, and then, pushing the two through  the gaping crowd, he marched them down to his stone jail and locked them  up.    Obviously the serious side of this incident was entirely lost upon the  highly entertained audience. Many and loud were the coarse jokes cracked  at the expense of Bass and Miller and after the rude door had closed  upon them similar remarks were addressed to Steele's jailer and guard,  who in truth, were just as disreputable looking as their prisoners.    Then the crowd returned to their pastimes, leaving their erstwhile  comrades to taste the sweets of prison life.    When I got a chance I asked Steele if he could rely on his hired hands,  and with a twinkle in his eye which surprised me as much as his reply,  he said Miller and Bass would have flown the coop before morning.    He was right. When I reached the lower end of town next morning, the  same old crowd, enlarged by other curious men and youths, had come to  pay their"]]]
