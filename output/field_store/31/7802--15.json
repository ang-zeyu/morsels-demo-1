The \"lap\" and \"lead\" are opened by the action of the valve lever acting as  a lever, and the port opening is given by the incline of the curved slide  in which the center of that lever slides, and the amount of this opening  depends upon the angle given to that incline. When these two actions are  in unison, the motion of the valve is very rapid, and this occurs when the  steam is being admitted. Then follows a period of opposition of these  motions, during which time the valve pauses momentarily, this  corresponding to the time when the port is fully open. Further periods of  unison follow, at which time the sharp \"cut-off\" is obtained.    The \"compression\" resulting with this gear is also reduced to a minimum,  owing to the peculiar movement given to the valves (_i. e._, the series of  accelerations and retardations referred to), as, while the \"lead\" is  obtained later and quicker, the port is also shut for \"compression\" later  and quicker, doing away with the necessity for a special expansion valve,  with its complicated and expensive machinery, and allowing the main valve  to be used for expansion, as the \"compression\" is not of an injurious  amount, even with a \"cut-off\" reduced to 15 per cent., or about 1/6 of the  stroke.    Thus, so far as the distribution of the steam and its treatment in the  cylinder is concerned, a marked advantage is shown in favor of this valve  gear. But next in its favor, as before said, is that the above advantages  are not gained at the cost of added complication of parts or increased  cost of machinery, but the reverse, as this gear can be built at a less  cost than link gear, varying according to the circumstances, but reaching  as high as a saving of 25 per cent., or, if it be compared with a link  gear supplemented by the usual special expansion valve and gear as  employed on marine engines, then the total saving is fully 50 per cent.,  and an equally good result is obtained as to the distribution and  subsequent treatment of the steam.    After accuracy of result and reduction in cost may rank saving room and  the advantages arising therefrom (though for steamships perhaps this  should have come first). Taking locomotives of the inside cylinder type,  which is the general form in use in England and the continent of Europe,  by clearing away the eccentrics and valves from the middle of the engine,  much larger cylinders may be introduced and a higher rate of expansion  employed, and this is being done. Also room is left for increasing the  length and wearing surfaces of all the main bearings with even less  crowding than is now the case with engines with the smaller cylinders.    But this advantage of saving room comes much more prominently forward in  marine engines, especially in war ships, where every inch of room saved is  valuable; and in the new type of triple-cylinder engines now coming so  much into vogue in the mercantile marine, whether those engines be only  the ordinary three-cylinder engines with double expansion, or the newer,  triple expansion engine, expanding the steam consecutively through three  cylinders--the form of marine engine which promises to come into use  wherever high-class work and economy are required. On this system, by  placing all the valve chests in front of the cylinders instead of between  them, or in a line with them, sufficient room is saved to get the new-type  three-cylinder engine into the space occupied by the old form of  two-cylinder engine.    Besides these prominent advantages there are others which, though of minor  importance, are still necessary to the practical and permanent success of  any new mechanical arrangement, such as the accessibility of all the  working parts while in motion, for examination and oiling; the ease with  which any part or the whole can be stripped and cleaned, or pinned up out  of the way in case of break down or accident, or got at and dismantled for  ordinary repair; the ease with which the whole may be handled, started,  reversed, or set at any point of expansion--all these being  recommendations to enlist the care and attention of the engineers in  charge by lightening their duties and rendering the engines easy to work.    With those advantages it is perhaps not surprising that this valve gear  has been very considerably adopted for many classes of steam engines,  especially where a high result has been required, with economy of space,  and a minimum of complication.    Having crucially tested the original engine on the London and  North-Western Railway, Mr. Webb proceeded to build others similar, and on  his bringing out his Compound Express Engine--notably the most advanced  step in locomotive design of the present day--he adopted this valve gear  throughout. There are now a number of these engines running some of the  fastest trains on the London and North-Western Railway, with the most  satisfactory results.    Following these, others of the leading railways took up the system, and  prominently among these Mr. Worsdell, of the Great Eastern Railway, built  a number of large express engines for his fast and heavy traffic, and is  now building a number of others similar as to the valve gear for his  suburban traffic, which is specially heavy. Also the Lancashire and  Yorkshire and the Midland and others of the chief railways are employing  the system specially for large express engines; the Midland engines having  cylinders of 19 inches diameter by 26 inches stroke, and four coupled  wheels of 7 feet diameter. A number of the above-named engines have run  large mileages, in many cases already exceeding 100,000 miles per engine.  For other countries also a number of locomotive engines have been built or  contracted for--both of inside and outside cylinder types--making a total  of nearly 800 locomotives built and building, many of them being of  special design and large size, up to 20 inches and 21 inches diameter of  cylinder.    In all these the absence of wire-drawing may be specially noted by the  full line at the top of the diagram, showing the admission of steam--this  fullness arising from the rapid and full opening of the port for  admission.    Passing now to the other great type of engines, those covered under the  general designation of marine engines, this gear has been applied to  nearly 40,000 H.P. indicated, built and building, and to all classes and  sizes, from the launch engine with cylinders 8 inches by 9 inches, running  at 600 to 700 revolutions per minute, up to engines for the largest class  of war ships, such as her Britannic Majesty's steel cruiser Amphion, of  5,000 H.P., with cylinders in duplicate of 46 inches and 86 inches  diameter, and 3 feet 3 inches stroke, running 100 revolutions per minute.  An examination of the indicator diagrams taken from these engines shows  that no wire-drawing takes place, and that, though the expansion is  carried to a point beyond the ordinary requirements, the compression is  but slightly increased. In all the diagrams taken from this valve motion  there is seen the clear, full upper line showing an abundant admission of  steam without any wire-drawing, and also the distinctly marked points  where \"cut-off\" or \"suppression\" and where \"release\" takes place, showing  the rapid action of the valves at those points.    It is well known to engineers that to obtain the maximum advantage out of  compounding, it is necessary to cut off in the low pressure cylinder at a  point corresponding to the relation between the low and the high, and that  point should be unaltered, whereas the point of cut-off in the high may at  the same time be varied to suit the work to be done.    In an ordinary link motion engine (where both links are connected to the  same weigh shaft), when linking up the high pressure cylinder to cut-off  short, the same change is necessarily made in the low. By the use of the  Joy gear, cut-off valves may be fitted to both cylinders, that for the low  pressure being fixed at the constant position required by the proportion  of the cylinders, while that on the high is adjustable; of course, in this  case, the position of the quadrants must be only changed for reversing. In  arranging the independent cut-off on the Joy gear, it is only necessary to  increase the length of the vibrating link beyond the point of attachment  for the main valve spindle connection to obtain a point from which motion  may be taken to actuate the cut-off valve; even then the cost of the Joy  gear for both cylinders is but little more than for a single set of link  gear.    This arrangement gives an absolutely perfect distribution of steam for  compounding, also equalizes the power developed by both cylinders, and is  far more simple and inexpensive than any other gear in existence.           *       *       *       *       *          THE STEAM BELL.      [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    The secondary railways in rural districts in Austria having no gates or  bars at the level crossings, or guards at such points, but being open like  tramways, special precautions are required to avoid accidents, and the  public has to be warned of the approach of the train from a sufficient  distance. This is done by ringing bells preferably to sounding whistles,  as these are more likely to startle horses. The steam bell shown by our  illustrations has been adopted for this purpose on the Austrian lines, and  is a simple contrivance. It consists of a cylindrical chamber, a, ending  in a narrower tube, c, which forms the seating for a flap valve, d, to  which the hammer or clapper, e, is fixed. Steam is admitted through a  small pipe, b, at the bottom, and after a certain interval attains  sufficient pressure to lift the valve.

Such monuments give you much  better than any words of mine ample suggestions for marble treatment. I  may quote such names as Nicolo Pisano and Verocchio.    Photos of some of their work I have brought. Note Pisano's beautiful  white altar at Bologna, and Mina de Fiesole's work in Florence. They all  show the sculptor as supreme. Why should not we encourage individual  young sculptors more? Give them portions of your work in which they can  put all the fervor and enthusiasm of young manhood. Their powers may not  be ripe, but they possess a verve and intensity that may have forever  fled when in later years the imagination is less enthusiastic and the  pulses slower. I am sure there are many young sculptors now wanting  commissions who have been trained at the academy, and better still, in  the best French schools. I maintain that the contemporary French school  of sculpture is in its line equal to any school of sculpture that has  ever existed, not excepting that of Phidias or that of the Italian  Renaissance of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. I believe history  will confirm this. Why not give these men an opportunity, and help on  the movement to found a truly English school of sculpture, rather than  give all such work to trading firms of carvers, who will do you any  number of superficial feet, properly priced and scheduled, and in the  bills of quantities, of any style you please, from prehistoric to  Victorian Gothic? Of course, this is our British way of founding a great  school.    There is one method of treatment that appeals to me very strongly, and  that is the application of colored metals to marble, more especially  bronze and copper. I may quote as a successful example near the  Wellington Memorial at St. Paul's. Another suggestion--although it is  not used in combination with marble, but it nevertheless suggests what  might be done in the way of bronze panels--that is, the Fawcett  Memorial, by Gilbert, in the west chapel at Westminster Abbey.           *       *       *       *       *          THE ST. LAWRENCE HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE.      The St. Lawrence State Hospital at Ogdensburg, N.Y., is a center of  public, professional, philanthropic, and legislative interest. Though  projected in advance of the adoption of the system of State care for the  insane, it was opened at a time to make it come under close observation  in relation to the question of State care, and the friends of this  departure from the inefficient, often almost barbarous provisions of  county house confinement could have no better example to point the  excellence of their theories than this new and progressively planned  State hospital. The members of the State Lunacy Commission and Miss  Schuyler and her colleagues of the State Charities Aid Society, who  fought the State care bills through the Legislature this winter and in  1890, would be repaid for all of their trouble by contrasting the  condition of the inmates of the St. Lawrence State Hospital with the  state they were in under their former custodians, the county officers of  the northern New York counties. At the best, even when these officials  realized the responsibility of their charge and were actuated by humane  impulses, the county houses offered no chance of remedial treatment.  Custody and maintenance, the former mainly a reliance on force, the  later often of scant provision, were the sum total of what was deemed  necessary for the lunatics. In their new environment they find  everything as different in accommodations and treatment as the word  hospital in the title of the institution is different in sound and  significance from the hope-dispelling, soul-chilling names of \"asylum,\"  \"mad house,\" and \"bedlam\" formerly given to all retreats for the  mentally afflicted. They find, and it is an encouraging feature of the  plan that so many of them quickly see and appreciate it, that they are  considered as sufferers from disease and not from demoniacal possession.  The remarkable range of classification provided for, the adaptability of  construction to the different classifications, the reliance on  occupation, the dependence on treatment, and the subordination of the  custodial feature, except where a wise conservatism demands its  retention, are apparent alike to inmates and visitors.    This hospital is complete as to plans, and as to the power plant,  drainage, and subway construction necessary for the 1,500 patients, that  the legislature has provided for in its law establishing the  institution. Buildings are already finished and occupied that  accommodate 200 inmates, and the contractors have nearly finished part  of the central group that will bring that number up to nearly 1,300. The  appropriation asked for this year by the managers will be scaled down  considerably by Mr. McClelland, the very economical chairman of the Ways  and Means Committee of the Democratic Assembly. But, unless he has  miscalculated, there will be money enough to carry on the work of  construction to advantage for the year. An appropriation sufficient to  complete the buildings at once was thought by many to be the wisest  economy, but big figures in an appropriation bill have very little  chance this year. The bill establishing the State Hospital district and  providing for the building of the institution fixed the per capita cost  of construction, including the purchase of land, at $1,150, and the  plans have been made on that basis for 1,500 patients. But if the needs  of the district should require it, the capacity could be increased by an  almost indefinite extension of the system of outlying colony groups at a  very small per capita cost, as the central group is by far the most  expensive in construction.    The administration group in part, and one outlying group, with the  general kitchen, bakery, workshop, laundry, employes' dwelling house,  power house, and pumping station, are already erected, and have added a  feature of architectural beauty to Point Airy. This point, of itself of  picturesque and romantic beauty, juts into the St. Lawrence River at the  head of the Galoup Rapids, three miles below Ogdensburg. It is a part of  the hospital farm of 950 acres, which includes woodland, meadow, farm  land, and a market garden tract of the $100 an acre grade. The location  of the institution in these particulars and in reference to salubrity,  sewerage facilities and abundance and excellence of water supply, is  wonderfully advantageous.    In planning the hospital Dr. P.M. Wise, who has since become its medical  superintendent, aimed to take the utmost advantage of the scenic and  hygienic capabilities of the site, and to improve on all previous  combinations of the two general divisions of a mixed asylum--a hospital  department for the concentration of professional treatment, and a  maintenance department for the separate care of the chronic insane. He  was anxious to secure as much as possible of the compactness and ease of  administration of the linear plan of construction, with wings on either  side of the executive building of long corridors occupied as day rooms,  with sleeping rooms opening out of them on both sides. But he wanted to  avoid the depressing influence of this monotonous structure, as the  better results of variety and increased opportunities of subdivision and  classification are well recognized. He was not, however, prepared to  accept wholly that abrupt departure from the linear plan known as the  \"cottage plan,\" which in some institutions has been carried to the  extreme of erecting a detached building for every ward. The climate of  St. Lawrence county forbade this. Her winters are as vigorous as those  of her Canadian neighbors, even as her people are almost as ebullient in  their politics as the vigorous warring liberals and conservatives across  the river. And there are features of the linear plan that can only be  left out of our asylum structure at the expense of efficiency. Other  rules that he formulated from his experience were that a building for  the insane should never exceed two stories in height; that fire proof  construction and at least two stairways from the upper floors should be  provided; that day rooms should be on the first and sleeping rooms on  the second floor; that all buildings for the insane who suffer from  sluggish and enfeebled circulation of the blood should be capable of  being warmed to 70 deg. in the coldest weather; that ample cubic space and  ventilation should be provided; and that, as far as possible, without  too great increase of the cost of maintenance or sacrificing essential  provisions for treatment and necessary restraint, asylums should aim to  reproduce the conditions of domestic life.    [Illustration: THE ST. LAWRENCE HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE.]    State Architect Isaac G. Perry planned the St. Lawrence State Hospital  buildings on ideas suggested by medical experience, with a breadth of  comprehension and a technical skill in combining adaptability, utility,  and beauty that have accomplished wonders. The buildings are  satisfactory in every particular to every one who has seen them, and  even the most casual observer is impressed with the effect of beauty.  This was accomplished without elaboration of material, expressive  carving or finish. The ornamentation is purely structural and is  obtained by a handling of the materials of construction which also  yielded the largest promise of strength and durability.    The central hospital group, of which an idea is given in the cut, now  consists of five buildings. The picture shows three, the center one and  two of the flanking cottages on one side. They are matched on the other  side. The central or administration building is a three story structure  of Gouverneur marble, and, like all of the stone used, a native St.  Lawrence county stone.
