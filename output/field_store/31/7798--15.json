Don Shirley was the man I come on horseback with from  Memphis to Lonoke. He was a man what dealt in horses. Sure he was a  white man. He's where we got some horses. I don't remember if he lived  at Lonoke or not.    \"I have voted, yes ma'am, a heap of times. I don't remember what kind er  ticket I votes. I'm a Democrat, I think so. I ain't voted fur sometime  now. I don't know if I'll vote any more times or not. I don't know what  is right bout votin and what ain't right.    \"When I was a boy I helped farm. We had what we made. I guess it was  plenty. I had more to eat and I didn't have as many changes of clothes  as folks has to have nowdays bout all de difference. They raised lots  more. They bought things to do a year and didn't be allus goin to town.  It was hard to come to town. Yes mam it did take a long time, sometimes  in a ox wagon. The oxen pulled more over muddy roads. Took three days to  come to town and git back. I farmed one-half-for-the-other and on shear  crop. Well one bout good as the other. Bout all anybody can make farmin  is plenty to eat and a little to wear long time ago and nows the same  way. The most I reckon I ever did make was on Surrounded Hill (Biscoe)  when I farmed one-half-fur-de-udder for Sheriff Reinhardt. The ground  was new and rich and the seasons hit just fine. No maam I never owned no  farm, no livestock, no home. The only thing I owned was a horse one  time. I worked 16 or 17 years for Mr. Brown and for Mr. Plunkett and  Son. I drayed all de time fur em. Hauled freight up from the old depot  (wharf) down on the river. Long time fore a railroad was thought of. I  helped load cotton and hides on the boats. We loaded all day and all  night too heap o'nights. We worked till we got through and let em take  the ship on.    \"The times is critical for old folks, wages low and everything is so  high. The young folks got heap better educations but seems like they  can't use it. They don't know how to any avantage. I know they don't  have as good chances at farmin as de older folks had. I don't know why  it is. My son works up at the lumber yard. Yes he owns this house.  That's all he owns. He make nough to get by on, I recken. He works hard,  yes maam. He helps me if he can. I get $4 a month janitor at the Farmers  and Merchants Bank (Des Arc). I works a little garden and cleans off  yards. No maam it hurts my rheumatism to run the yard mower. I works  when I sho can't hardly go. Nothin matter cept I'm bout wo out. I plied  for the old folks penshun but I ain't got nuthin yet. I signed up at the  bank fur it agin not long ago.

I can remember when my old  master sold Aunt Susan. She raised me. I seen old master when he was  tryin' to whip old Aunt Susan. She was the cook. She said, 'I ain't  goin' let you whip me' and I heard my sister say next day he done sold  Aunt Susan. I ain't seed her since. I called her ma. My mother died when  I was two years old. She was full Injun. My father was black but his  hair was straight. His face was so black it shined. Looked like it was  greased. My father said he was freeborn and I've seen stripes on his  back look like the veins on back of my hand where they whipped him  tryin' to make him disown his freedom.    \"Old Jack Clifton was my master. Yes ma'm, that was his name.    \"I 'member when they had those old looms--makin' cloth and old shuttle  to put the thread on. I can see 'em now.    \"I can 'member when this used to be a Injun place. I've seen old Injun  mounds. White folks come and run 'em out and give 'em Injun Territory.    \"I heered the guns in the war and seed the folks comin' home when the  war broke. They said they was fitin' 'bout freedom, tryin' to free the  people. I 'member when they was fitin' at Marks Mill. I know some of the  people said that was where they was sot free.    \"I don't know as I seed any Ku Klux when they was goin' round. Hearin'  'bout 'em scared me. I have a good recollection. I can remember the  first dream I ever had and the first time I whistled. I can remember  when I was two or three years old. Remember when they had a big old  conch shell. Old master would blow it at twelve o'clock for 'em to come  in.    \"Old master was good to us but I 'member he had a leather strap and if  we chillun had done anything he'd make us younguns put our head 'tween  his legs and put that strap on us. My goodness! He called me Pat and  called his own son Bug--his own son Junie. We played together. Old  master had nicknames for everybody.    \"My first mistress was named Miss Mary but she died. I 'member when old  master married and brought Miss Becky home.    \"Marse John (he was old master's oldest son) he used to tote me about in  his saddle bags. He was the overseer.    \"I 'member old master's ridin' hoss--a little old bay pony--called him  Hardy. I never remember nobody else bein' on it--that was his ridin'  hoss.    \"Old master had dogs. One was Gus and one named Brute (he was a red bone  hound). And one little dog they called Trigger. Old master's head as  white as cotton.    \"I do remember the day they said the people was free--after the war  broke. My father come and got me.    \"Now I'm givin' you a true statement. I've been stayin' by myself  twenty-three years. I been here in Pine Bluff--well I jest had got here  when the people was comin' back from that German war.    \"My God, we had the finest time when we killed hogs--make sausage. We'd  eat cracklin's--oh, we thought they wasn't nothin' like cracklin's. The  Lord have mercy, there was an old beech tree set there in my master's  yard. You could hear that old tree pop ever' day bout the same time,  bout twelve o'clock. We used to eat beech mass. Good? Yes ma'm! I think  about it often and wonder why it was right in old master's yard.    \"I've cast a many a vote. Not a bit of trouble in the world. Hope elect  most all the old officers here in town. I had a brother was a constable  under Squire Gaines. Well of course, Miss, I don't think it's right when  they disfranchised the colored people. I tell you, Miss, I read the  Bible and the Bible says every man has his rights--the poor and the free  and the bound. I got good sense from the time I leaped in this world. I  'member well I used to go and cast my vote just that quick but they got  so they wouldn't let you vote unless you could read.    \"I've had 'em to offer me money to vote the Democrat ticket. I told him,  no. I didn't think that was principle. The colored man ain't got no  representive now. Colored men used to be elected to the legislature and  they'd go and sell out. Some of 'em used to vote the Democrat ticket.  God wants every man to have his birthright.    \"I tell you one thing they did. This here no fence law was one of the  lowest things they ever did. I don't know what the governor was studyin'  'bout. If they would let the old people raise meat, they wouldn't have  to get so much help from the government. God don't like that, God wants  the people to raise things. I could make a livin' but they won't let me.    \"The first thing I remember bout studyin' was Junie, old master's son,  studyin' his book and I heard 'em spell the word 'baker'. That was when  they used the old Blue Back Speller.    \"I went to school. I'm goin' tell you as nearly as I can. That was,  madam, let me see, that was in sixty-nine as near as I can come at it.  Miss, I don't know how long I went. My father wouldn't let me. I didn't  know nothin' but work. I weighed cotton ever since I was a little boy. I  always wanted to be weighin'. Looked like it was my gift--weighin'  cotton.    \"I'm a Missionary Baptist preacher. Got a license to preach. You go down  and try to preach without a license and they put you up.    \"Madam, you asked me a question I think I can answer with knowledge and  understanding. The young people is goin' too fast. The people is growin'  weaker and wiser. You take my folks--goin' to school but not doin'  anything. I don't think there's much to the younger generation. Don't  think they're doin' much good.

She called after him: \"I have been killed once,  and now you are trying to kill me again. Oh Heavy Collar!\" As he ran away,  he could still hear her angry words following him, until at last they died  away in the distance. He ran all night long, and whenever he stopped to  breathe and listen, he seemed to hear in the distance the echoes of her  voice. All he could hear was, \"Oh Heavy Collar!\" and then he would rush  away again. He ran until he was all tired out, and by this time it was  daylight. He was now quite a long way below Fort McLeod. He was very  sleepy, but dared not lie down, for he remembered that the ghost had said  that she would follow him. He kept walking on for some time, and then sat  down to rest, and at once fell asleep.    Before he had left his party, Heavy Collar had said to his young men: \"Now  remember, if any one of us should get separated from the party, let him  always travel to the Belly River Buttes. There will be our meeting-place.\"  When their leader did not return to them, the party started across the  country and went toward the Belly River Buttes. Heavy Collar had followed  the river up, and had gone a long distance out of his way; and when he  awoke from his sleep he too started straight for the Belly River Buttes, as  he had said he would.    When his party reached the Buttes, one of them went up on top of the hill  to watch. After a time, as he looked down the river, he saw two persons  coming, and as they came nearer, he saw that one of them was Heavy Collar,  and by his side was a woman. The watcher called up the rest of the party,  and said to them: \"Here comes our chief. He has had luck. He is bringing a  woman with him. If he brings her into camp, we will take her away from  him.\" And they all laughed. They supposed that he had captured her. They  went down to the camp, and sat about the fire, looking at the two people  coming, and laughing among themselves at the idea of their chief bringing  in a woman. When the two persons had come close, they could see that Heavy  Collar was walking fast, and the woman would walk by his side a little way,  trying to keep up, and then would fall behind, and then trot along to catch  up to him again. Just before the pair reached camp there was a deep ravine  that they had to cross. They went down into this side by side, and then  Heavy Collar came up out of it alone, and came on into the camp.    When he got there, all the young men began to laugh at him and to call out,  \"Heavy Collar, where is your woman?\" He looked at them for a moment, and  then said: \"Why, I have no woman. I do not understand what you are talking  about.\" One of them said: \"Oh, he has hidden her in that ravine. He was  afraid to bring her into camp.\" Another said, \"Where did you capture her,  and what tribe does she belong to?\" Heavy Collar looked from one to  another, and said: \"I think you are all crazy. I have taken no woman. What  do you mean?\" The young man said: \"Why, that woman that you had with you  just now: where did you get her, and where did you leave her? Is she down  in the coulee? We all saw her, and it is no use to deny that she was with  you. Come now, where is she?\" When they said this, Heavy Collar's heart  grew very heavy, for he knew that it must have been the ghost woman; and he  told them the story. Some of the young men could not believe this, and they  ran down to the ravine, where they had last seen the woman. There they saw  in the soft dirt the tracks made by Heavy Collar, when he went down into  the ravine, but there were no other tracks near his, where they had seen  the woman walking. When they found that it was a ghost that had come along  with Heavy Collar, they resolved to go back to their main camp. The party  had been out so long that their moccasins were all worn out, and some of  them were footsore, so that they could not travel fast, but at last they  came to the cut banks, and there found their camp--seven lodges.    That night, after they had reached camp, they were inviting each other to  feasts. It was getting pretty late in the night, and the moon was shining  brightly, when one of the Bloods called out for Heavy Collar to come and  eat with him. Heavy Collar shouted, \"Yes, I will be there pretty soon.\" He  got up and went out of the lodge, and went a little way from it, and sat  down. While he was sitting there, a big bear walked out of the brush close  to him. Heavy Collar felt around him for a stone to throw at the bear, so  as to scare it away, for he thought it had not seen him. As he was feeling  about, his hand came upon a piece of bone, and he threw this over at the  bear, and hit it. Then the bear spoke, and said: \"Well, well, well, Heavy  Collar; you have killed me once, and now here you are hitting me. Where is  there a place in this world where you can hide from me? I will find you, I  don't care where you may go.\" When Heavy Collar heard this, he knew it was  the ghost woman, and he jumped up and ran toward his lodge, calling out,  \"Run, run! a ghost bear is upon us!\"    All the people in the camp ran to his lodge, so that it was crowded full of  people. There was a big fire in the lodge, and the wind was blowing hard  from the west. Men, women, and children were huddled together in the lodge,  and were very much afraid of the ghost. They could hear her walking toward  the lodge, grumbling, and saying: \"I will kill all these dogs. Not one of  them shall get away.\" The sounds kept coming closer and closer, until they  were right at the lodge door. Then she said, \"I will smoke you to death.\"  And as she said this, she moved the poles, so that the wings of the lodge  turned toward the west, and the wind could blow in freely through the smoke  hole. All this time she was threatening terrible things against them. The  lodge began to get full of smoke, and the children were crying, and all  were in great distress--almost suffocating. So they said, \"Let us lift one  man up here inside, and let him try to fix the ears, so that the lodge will  get clear of smoke.\" They raised a man up, and he was standing on the  shoulders of the others, and, blinded and half strangled by the smoke, was  trying to turn the wings. While he was doing this, the ghost suddenly hit  the lodge a blow, and said, \"_Un_!\" and this scared the people who were  holding the man, and they jumped and let him go, and he fell down. Then the  people were in despair, and said, \"It is no use; she is resolved to smoke  us to death.\" All the time the smoke was getting thicker in the lodge.    Heavy Collar said: \"Is it possible that she can destroy us? Is there no one  here who has some strong dream power that can overcome this ghost?\"    His mother said: \"I will try to do something. I am older than any of you,  and I will see what I can do.\" So she got down her medicine bundle and  painted herself, and got out a pipe and filled it and lighted it, and stuck  the stem out through the lodge door, and sat there and began to pray to the  ghost woman. She said: \"Oh ghost, take pity on us, and go away. We have  never wronged you, but you are troubling us and frightening our  children. Accept what I offer you, and leave us alone.\"    A voice came from behind the lodge and said: \"No, no, no; you dogs, I will  not listen to you. Every one of you must die.\"    The old woman repeated her prayer: \"Ghost, take pity on us. Accept this  smoke and go away.\"    Then the ghost said: \"How can you expect me to smoke, when I am way back  here? Bring that pipe out here. I have no long bill to reach round the  lodge.\" So the old woman went out of the lodge door, and reached out the  stem of the pipe as far as she could reach around toward the back of the  lodge. The ghost said: \"No, I do not wish to go around there to where you  have that pipe. If you want me to smoke it, you must bring it here.\" The  old woman went around the lodge toward her, and the ghost woman began to  back away, and said, \"No, I do not smoke that kind of a pipe.\" And when the  ghost started away, the old woman followed her, and she could not help  herself.    She called out, \"Oh my children, the ghost is carrying me off!\" Heavy  Collar rushed out, and called to the others, \"Come, and help me take my  mother from the ghost.\" He grasped his mother about the waist and held her,  and another man took him by the waist, and another him, until they were all  strung out, one behind the other, and all following the old woman, who was  following the ghost woman, who was walking away.    All at once the old woman let go of the pipe, and fell over dead. The ghost  disappeared, and they were troubled no more by the ghost woman.        THE WOLF-MAN      There was once a man who had two bad wives. They had no shame. The man  thought if he moved away where there were no other people, he might teach  these women to become good, so he moved his lodge away off on the prairie.  Near where they camped was a high butte, and every evening about sundown,  the man would go up on top of it, and look all over the country to see  where the buffalo were feeding, and if any enemies were approaching. There  was a buffalo skull on the hill, which he used to sit on.    \"This is very lonesome,\" said one woman to the other, one day. \"We have no  one to talk with nor to visit.\"    \"Let us kill our husband,\" said the other. \"Then we will go back to our  relations and have a good time.\"    Early in the morning, the man went out to hunt, and as soon as he was out  of sight, his wives went up on top of the butte. There they dug a deep pit,  and covered it over with light sticks, grass, and dirt, and placed the  buffalo skull on top.    In the afternoon they saw their husband coming home, loaded down with meat  he had killed. So they hurried to cook for him. After eating, he went up on  the butte and sat down on the skull. The slender sticks gave way, and he  fell into the pit. His wives were watching him, and when they saw him"]]]
