Sheridan and Johnson Counties (Wyoming) have  sage grouse protected until 1915. The miners (mostly foreigners) are out  after rabbits at all seasons. To them everything that flies, walks or  swims, large enough to be seen, is a \"rabbit.\" They are even worse than  the average sheep-herder, as he will seldom kill a bird brooding her  young, but to one of those men, a wren or creeper looks like a turkey.  Antelope, mountain sheep and grizzly bears are _going_, fast! The moose  season opens in 1915, for a 30 days open season, then close season until  1920.--(Howard Eaton, Wolf.)

BRITISH COLUMBIA:    Wild fowl are in the greatest danger in the southern part of the  Province, especially the wood-duck. Otherwise birds are increasing  rather than otherwise, especially the small non-game birds. The sea  otter is almost extinct.--(A. Bryan Williams, Provincial Game Warden,  Vancouver.)    MANITOBA:    Whooping crane, wood-duck and golden plover. Other species begin to show  a marked increase, due to our stringent protective measures. For  example, the pinnated grouse and sharp-tailed grouse are more plentiful  than in 15 years. Prong-horned antelope and wolf are threatened with  extinction.--(J.P. Turner, Winnipeg.)    The game birds indigenous to this Province are fairly plentiful. Though  the prairie chicken was very scarce some few years ago, these birds have  become very plentiful again, owing to the strict enforcement of our  present \"Game Act.\" The elk are in danger of becoming extinct if they  are not stringently guarded. Beaver and otter were almost extinct some  few years ago, but are now on the increase, owing to a strict  enforcement of the \"Game Act.\"--(Charles Barber, Winnipeg.)    NEW BRUNSWICK:    Partridge, plover and woodcock. Moose and deer are getting more  plentiful every year.--(W.W. Gerard, St. John.)    NOVA SCOTIA:    The Canada grouse may possibly become extinct in Nova Scotia, unless the  protection it now enjoys can save it. The American golden plover, which  formerly came in immense flocks, is now very rare. Snowflakes are very  much less common than formerly, but I think this is because our winters  are now usually much less severe. The caribou is almost extinct on the  mainland of Nova Scotia, but is still found in North Cape Breton Island.  The wolf has become excessively rare, but as it is found in New  Brunswick, it may occur here at any time again. The beaver had been  threatened with extinction; but since being protected, it has  multiplied, and is now on a fairly safe footing again.--(Curator of  Museum, Halifax.)    ONTARIO:    Quail are getting scarce.--(E. Tinsley, Toronto.)    Wood-duck, bob white, woodcock, golden plover, Hudsonian curlew, knot  and dowitcher [are threatened with extinction.]--(C.W. Nash, Toronto.)    PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND:    The species threatened with extinction are the golden plover, American  woodcock, pied-billed grebe, red-throated loon, sooty shearwater,  gadwall, ruddy duck, black-crowned night heron, Hudsonian godwit,  kildeer, northern pileated woodpecker, chimney swift, yellow-bellied  flycatcher, red-winged blackbird, pine finch, magnolia warbler,  ruby-crowned kinglet.--(E.T. Carbonell, Charlottetown.)          In closing the notes of this survey, I repeat my assurance that they are  not offered on a basis of infallibility. It would require years of work  to obtain answers from forty-eight states to the three questions that I  have asked that could be offered as absolutely exact. All these reports  are submitted on the well-recognized court-testimony basis,--\"to the  best of our knowledge and belief.\" Gathered as they have been from  persons whose knowledge is good, these opinions are therefore valuable;  and they furnish excellent indices of wild-life conditions as they exist  in 1912 in the various states and provinces of North America north of  Mexico.           *        *        *        *        *    CHAPTER VI    THE REGULAR ARMY OF DESTRUCTION      In order to cure any disease, the surgeon must make of it a correct  diagnosis. It is useless to try to prescribe remedies without a thorough  understanding of the trouble.    That the best and most interesting wild life of America is disappearing  at a rapid rate, we all know only too well. That proposition is entirely  beyond the domain of argument. The fact that a species or a group of  species has made a little gain here and there, or is stationary, does  not sensibly diminish the force of the descending blow. The wild-life  situation is full of surprises. For example, in 1902 I was astounded by  the extent to which bird life had decreased over the 130 miles between  Miles City, Montana, and the Missouri River since 1886; for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13268"],[0,"Hindu literature : Comprising The Book of good counsels, Nala and Damayanti, The (#15)"],[1,"the foolish Tortoise fell.'    'I never heard it,' said the King. 'How was that?' The Goose related--      THE STORY OF THE TORTOISE AND THE GEESE    \"There is a pool in South Behar called the 'Pool of the Blue Lotus,' and  two Geese had for a long time lived there. They had a friend in the pool  who was a Tortoise, and he was known as 'Shelly-neck,' It chanced one  evening that the Tortoise overheard some fishermen talking by the water.  'We will stop here to-night,' they said, 'and in the morning we will  catch the fish, the tortoises, and such like.' Extremely alarmed at  this, the Tortoise repaired to his friends the Geese, and reported the  conversation.    'What ever am I to do, Gossips?' he asked.    'The first thing is to be assured of the danger,' said the Geese.    'I am assured,' exclaimed the Tortoise; 'the first thing is to avoid it:  don't you know?--        'Time-not-come' and 'Quick-at-peril,' these two fishes 'scaped the net;      'What-will-be-will-be,' he perished, by the fishermen beset.'    'No,' said the Geese,' how was it?' Shelly-neck related:--      THE STORY OF FATE AND THE THREE FISHES    \"It was just such a pool as this, and on the arrival at it of just such  men as these fishermen, that three fishes, who had heard their designs,  held consultation as to what should be done.    'I shall go to another water,' said \"Time-not-come,\" and away he went.    'Why should we leave unless obliged?' asked \"Quick-at-peril.\" 'When the  thing befalls I shall do the best I can--        'Who deals with bad dilemmas well, is wise.      The merchant's wife, with womanly device,      Kissed--and denied the kiss--under his eyes.'    'How was that?' asked the other fish. Quick-at-peril related:--      THE STORY OF THE UNABASHED WIFE    \"There was a trader in Vikrama-poora, who had a very beautiful wife, and  her name was Jewel-bright. The lady was as unfaithful as she was fair,  and had chosen for her last lover one of the household servants. Ah!  womankind!--        'Sex, that tires of being true,      Base and new is brave to you!      Like the jungle-cows ye range,      Changing food for sake of change.'    Now it befell one day that as Jewel-bright was bestowing a kiss on the  mouth of the servant, she was surprised by her husband; and seeing him  she ran up hastily and said, 'My lord, here is an impudent varlet! he  eats the camphor which I procured for you; I was actually smelling it on  his lips as you entered.' The servant catching her meaning, affected  offence. 'How can a man stay in a house where the mistress is always  smelling one's lips for a little camphor?' he said; and thereat he was  for going off, and was only constrained by the good man to stay, after  much entreaty. 'Therefore,' said Quick-at-peril, 'I mean to abide here,  and make the best I can of what befalls, as she did.'    'Yes, yes,' said What-will-be-will-be, 'we all know        'That which will not be will not be, and what is to be will be:--      Why not drink this easy physic, antidote of misery?'    'When the morning came, the net was thrown, and both the fishes  inclosed. Quick-at-peril, on being drawn up, feigned himself dead; and  upon the fisherman's laying him aside, he leaped off again into the  water. As to What-will-be-will-be, he was seized and forthwith  dispatched.--And that,' concluded the Tortoise, 'is why I wish to devise  some plan of escape.'    'It might be compassed if you could go elsewhere,' said the Geese, 'but  how can you get across the ground?'    'Can't you take me through the air?' asked the Tortoise.    'Impossible!' said the Geese.    'Not at all!' replied the Tortoise; 'you shall hold a stick across in  your bills, and I will hang on to it by my mouth--and thus you can  readily convey me,'    'It is feasible,' observed the Geese, 'but remember,        'Wise men their plans revolve, lest ill befall;      The Herons gained a friend, and so, lost all.'    'How came that about?' asked the Tortoise. The Geese related:--      THE STORY OF THE HERONS AND THE MONGOOSE    \"Among the mountains of the north there is one named Eagle-cliff, and  near it, upon a fig-tree, a flock of Herons had their residence. At the  foot of the tree, in a hollow, there lived a serpent; and he was  constantly devouring the nestlings of the Herons. Loud were the  complaints of the parent birds, until an old Heron thus advised  them:--'You should bring some fishes from the pool, and lay them one by  one in a line from the hole of yonder Mongoose to the hollow where the  Serpent lives. The Mongoose will find him when it comes after the fish,  and if it finds him it will kill him.' The advice seemed good, and was  acted upon; but in killing the Snake the Mongoose overheard the cry of  the young Herons; and climbing the tree daily, he devoured all that the  Snake had left. Therefore,' concluded the Geese, 'do we bid you look  well into your plan: if you should open your mouth, for instance, as we  carry you, you will drop and be killed.'    'Am I a fool,' cried the Tortoise, 'to open my mouth? Not I! Come now,  convey me!'    'Thereupon the Geese took up the stick; the Tortoise held fast with his  mouth, and away they flew. The country people, observing this strange  sight, ran after.    'Ho! ho!' cried one, 'look at the flying Tortoise!'    'When he falls we'll cook and eat him here,' said another.    'No; let us take him home for dinner!' cried a third.    'We can light a fire by the pool, and eat him,' said the first.    'The Tortoise heard these unkind remarks in a towering passion. 'Eat  me!--eat ashes!' he exclaimed, opening his mouth--and down he fell  directly, and was caught by the countrymen.--Said I not well,' concluded  the Goose-Minister, 'that to scorn counsel is to seek destruction?'    'You have well said,' replied King Silver-sides, disconsolately.    'Yes, your Majesty,' interposed the Crane, who was just returned, 'if  the Fort had been cleared, Night-cloud could not have fired it, as he  did, by the Vulture's instigation.'    'We see it all,' sighed the King, 'but too late!'        'Whoso trusts, for service rendered, or fair words, an enemy,      Wakes from folly like one falling in his slumber from a tree.'    'I witnessed Night-cloud's reception,' continued the Crane. 'King  Jewel-plume showed him great favor, and was for anointing him Rajah of  Camphor-island.'    'Hear you that, my Liege?' asked the Goose.    'Go on; I hear!' said Silver-sides.    'To that the Vulture demurred,' continued the Crane:--'\"favor to low  persons,\" he said, \"was like writing on the sea-sand. To set the  base-born in the seat of the great was long ago declared impolitic--        'Give mean men power, and give thy throat to the knife;      The Mouse, made Tiger, sought his master's life.'    'How was that?' asked King Jewel-plume. The Vulture related--      THE STORY OF THE RECLUSE AND THE MOUSE    \"In the forest of the Sage Gautama there dwelt a Recluse named  Mighty-at-Prayer. Once, as he sat at his frugal meal, a young mouse  dropped beside him from the beak of a crow, and he took it up and fed it  tenderly with rice grains. Some time after the Saint observed a cat  pursuing his dependent to devour it, whereupon he changed the mouse into  a stout cat. The cat was a great deal harassed by dogs, upon which the  Saint again transformed it into a dog. The dog was always in danger of  the tigers, and his protector at last gave him the form of a  tiger--considering him all this while, and treating him withal, like  nothing but a mouse. The country-folk passing by would say, 'That a  tiger! not he; it is a mouse the Saint has transformed.' And the mouse  being vexed at this, reflected, 'So long as the Master lives, this  shameful story of my origin will survive!' With this thought he was  about to take the Saint's life, when he, who knew his purpose, turned  the ungrateful beast by a word to his original shape. Besides, your  Majesty,\" continued the Vulture, \"it may not be so easy to take in  Camphor-island--        'Many fine fishes did the old Crane kill,      But the Crab matched him, maugre all his bill.'    'How came that to pass?' asked Jewel-plume.    'The Vulture related:--      THE STORY OF THE CRANE AND THE CRAB    \"There was an old Crane at a mere called Lily-water, in Malwa, who stood  one day in the shallows with a most dejected look and drooping bill. A  Crab observed him and called out, 'Friend Crane! have you given up  eating, that you stand there all day?' 'Nay, sir!' replied the old  Crane; 'I love my dish of fish, but I have heard the fishermen say that  they mean to capture every one that swims in this water; and as that  destroys my hope of subsistence, I am resigning myself to death.' All  this the fishes overheard. 'In this matter certainly,' they said, 'his  interest is ours; we ought to consult him; for it is written--        'Fellow be with kindly foemen, rather than with friends unkind;      Friend and foeman are distinguished not by title but by mind.'    Thereupon they repaired to him: 'Good Crane,' they said, 'what course is  there for safety?'    'Course of safety there is,' replied the Crane, 'to go elsewhere; and I  will carry you one by one to another pool, if you please.'    'Do so,' said the trembling fishes.    \"The Crane accordingly took one after another, and having eaten them  returned with the report that he had safely deposited each. Last of all,  the Crab requested to be taken; and the Crane, coveting his tender  flesh, took him up with great apparent respect. On arriving at the spot,  which was covered with fish-bones, the Crab perceived the fate reserved  for him; and turning round he fastened upon the Crane's throat and tore  it so that he perished.'    'Well, but,' said King Jewel-plume, 'we can make Night-cloud viceroy  here, to send over to Vindhya all the productions of Camphor-isle!'    'Then the Vulture Far-sight laughed a low laugh and said--        'Who, ere he makes a gain"]]]
