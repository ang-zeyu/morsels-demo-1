Here he finds himself living in a vehicle which he has never used before--a  vehicle furthermore which is very far from being fully developed--a vehicle  which shuts him out to a great extent from the world about him, instead of  enabling him to see it. The lower part of his nature burnt itself away  during his purgatorial life, and now there remain to him only his higher  and more refined thoughts, the noble and unselfish aspirations which he  poured out during earth-life. These cluster round him, and make a sort of  shell about him, through the medium of which he is able to respond to  certain types of vibrations in this refined matter.    These thoughts which surround him are the powers by which he draws upon the  wealth of the heaven-world, and he finds it to be a storehouse of infinite  extent, upon which he is able to draw just according to the power of those  thoughts and aspirations; for in this world is existing the infinite  fullness of the Divine Mind, open in all its limitless affluence to every  soul, just in proportion as that soul has qualified itself to receive. A  man who has already completed his human evolution, who has fully realized  and unfolded the divinity whose germ is within him, finds the whole of this  glory within his reach; but since none of us has yet done that, since we  are only gradually rising towards that splendid consummation, it follows  that none of us as yet can grasp that entirety.    But each draws from it and cognizes so much of it as he has by previous  effort prepared himself to take. Different individuals bring very different  capacities; they tell us in the East that each man brings his own cup, and  some of the cups are large and some are small, but small or large every cup  is filled to its utmost capacity; the sea of bliss holds far more than  enough for all.    A man can look out upon all this glory and beauty only through the windows  which he himself has made. Every one of these thought-forms is such a  window, through which response may come to him from the forces without. If  during his earth-life he has chiefly regarded physical things, then he has  made for himself but few windows through which this higher glory can shine  in upon him. Yet every man who is above the lowest savage must have had  some touch of pure unselfish feeling, even if it were but once in all his  life, and that will be a window for him now.    The ordinary man is not capable of any great activity in this mental world;  his condition is chiefly receptive, and his vision of anything outside his  own shell of thought is of the most limited character. He is surrounded by  living forces, mighty angelic inhabitants of this glorious world, and many  of their orders are very sensitive to certain aspirations of man and  readily respond to them. But a man can take advantage of these only in so  far as he has already prepared himself to profit by them, for his thoughts  and aspirations are only along certain lines, and he cannot suddenly form  new lines. There are many directions which the higher thought may  take--some of them personal and some impersonal. Among the latter are art,  music and philosophy; and a man whose interest lay along any one of these  lines finds both measureless enjoyment and unlimited instruction waiting  for him--that is, the amount of enjoyment and instruction is limited only  by his power of perception.    We find a large number of people whose only higher thoughts are those  connected with affection and devotion. If a man loves another deeply or if  he feels strong devotion to a personal deity, he makes a strong mental  image of that friend or of the deity, and the object of his feeling is  often present in his mind. Inevitably he takes that mental image into the  heaven-world with him, because it is to that level of matter that it  naturally belongs.    Take first the case of affection. The love which forms and retains such an  image is a very powerful force--a force which is strong enough to reach and  to act upon the ego of his friend in the higher part of the mental world.  It is that ego that is the real man whom he loves--not the physical body  which is so partial a representation of him. The ego of the friend, feeling  this vibration, at once and eagerly responds to it, and pours himself into  the thought-form, which has been made for him; so that the man's friend is  truly present with him more vividly than ever before. To this result it  makes no difference whatever whether the friend is what we call living or  dead; the appeal is made not to the fragment of the friend which is  sometimes imprisoned in a physical body, but to the man himself on his own  true level; and he always responds. A man who has a hundred friends can  simultaneously and fully respond to the affection of every one of them, for  no number of representations on a lower level can exhaust the infinity of  the ego.    Thus every man in his heaven-life has around him all the friends for whose  company he wishes, and they are for him always at their best, because he  himself makes for them the thought-form through which they manifest to him.  In our limited physical world we are so accustomed to thinking of our  friend as only the limited manifestation which we know in the physical  world, that it is at first difficult for us to realize the grandeur of the  conception; when we can realize it, we shall see how much nearer we are in  truth to our friends in the heaven-life than we ever were on earth. The  same is true in the case of devotion. The man in the heaven-world is two  great stages nearer to the object of his devotion than he was during  physical life, and so his experiences are of a far more transcendent  character.    In this mental world, as in the astral, there are seven subdivisions. The  first, second and third are the habitat of the ego in his causal body, so  the mental body contains matter of the remaining four only, and it is in  those sections that his heaven-life is passed. Man does not, however, pass  from one to the other of these, as is the case in the astral world, for  there is nothing in this life corresponding to the rearrangement. Rather is  the man drawn to the level which best corresponds to the degree of his  development, and on that level he spends the whole of his life in the  mental body. Each man makes his own conditions, so that the number of  varieties is infinite.    Speaking broadly, we may say that the dominant characteristic observed in  the lowest portion is unselfish family affection. Unselfish it must be, or  it would find no place here; all selfish tinges, if there were any, worked  out their results in the astral world. The dominant characteristic of the  sixth level may be said to be anthropomorphical religious devotion; while  that of the fifth section is devotion expressing itself in active work of  some sort. All these--the fifth, sixth and seventh subdivisions--are  concerned with the working out of devotion to personalities (either to  one's family and friends or to a personal deity) rather than the wider  devotion to humanity for its own sake, which finds its expression in the  next section. The activities of this fourth stage are varied. They can best  be arranged in four main divisions: unselfish pursuit of spiritual  knowledge; high philosophy or scientific thought; literary or artistic  ability exercised for unselfish purposes; and service for the sake of  service.    Even to this glorious heaven-life there comes an end, and then the mental  body in its turn drops away as the others have done, and the man's life in  his causal body begins. Here the man needs no windows, for this is his true  home and all his walls have fallen away. The majority of men have as yet  but very little consciousness at such a height as this; they rest dreamily  unobservant and scarcely awake, but such vision as they have is true,  however limited it may be by their lack of development. Still, every time  they return, these limitations will be smaller, and they themselves will be  greater; so that this truest life will be wider and fuller for them.    As this improvement continues, this causal life grows, longer and longer,  assuming an ever larger proportion as compared to the existence at lower  levels. And as he grows, the man becomes capable not only of receiving but  also of giving. Then indeed is his triumph approaching, for he is learning  the lesson of the Christ, learning the crowning glory of sacrifice, the  supreme delight of pouring out all his life for the helping of his  fellow-men, the devotion of the self to the all, of celestial strength to  human service, of all those splendid heavenly forces to the aid of the  struggling sons of earth. That is part of the life that lies before us;  these are some of the steps which even we who are still so near the bottom  of the golden ladder may see rising above us, so that we may report them to  those who have not seen as yet, in order that they too may open their eyes  to the unimaginable splendour which surrounds them here and now in this  dull daily life. This is part of the gospel of Theosophy--the certainty of  this sublime future for all. It is certain because it is here already,  because to inherit it we have only to fit ourselves for it.          Chapter VII    REINCARNATION      This life of the ego in his own world, which is so glorious and so fully  satisfying for the developed man, plays but a very small part in the life  of the ordinary person, for in his case the ego has not yet reached a  sufficient stage of development to be awake in his causal body. In  obedience to the law of Nature he has withdrawn into it, but in doing so he  has lost the sensation of vivid life, and his restless desire to feel this  once more pushes him in the direction of another"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12928"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 1 (#15)"],[1," sailors were set to paint the  inside of the canvas for the boats; The Doctor to clear out the dock  previous to laying down the keel, etc.; and the bullock-drivers and smith  to make a stockyard.    FIRES IN THE BUSH.    At 11 A.M. I discovered the grass near our tents to be on fire, but with  the assistance of the people it was fortunately extinguished. All the  country beyond the river was in flames, and indeed, from the time of our  arrival in these parts, the atmosphere had been so obscured by smoke that  I could never obtain a distinct view of the horizon. The smoke darkened  the air at night, so as to hide the stars, and thus prevented us from  ascertaining our latitude. One spark might have set the whole country on  our side in a blaze, and then no food would remain for the cattle, not to  mention the danger to our stores and ammunition. Fires prevailed fully as  extensively at great distances in the interior, and the sultry air seemed  heated by the general conflagration. In the afternoon I took my rifle and  explored the course of the river some miles downwards, an interesting  walk where probably no white man's foot had ever trod before. I found a  flowery desert, the richest part of the adjacent country being quite  covered with a fragrant white amaryllis in full bloom.* The river widened  into smooth deep reaches, so that I felt sanguine about our progress with  the boats. In returning, I examined the hills on the right bank. One,  named Einerguendi by Brown, consisted of compact felspar, coloured green  by chlorite, with grains of quartz and acicular crystals of felspar.    (Footnote. Calostemma candidum, Lindley manuscripts; foliis...tubo  perianthii limbo multo breviore, corona truncata dentibus sterilibus  nullis, umbellis densis, pedicellis articulatis exterioribus multo  longioribus.)    ROCKS OF BULLABALAKIT.    The hill immediately over our camp was Bullabalakit, and consisted partly  of granular felspar, probably tinged greenish with chlorite; and partly  of concretionary porphyry, the concretions being mottled red and white,  and containing grains of quartz and crystals of common felspar; the white  concretions resisting the action of the atmosphere stood in relief on the  weather surface; I noticed also a vein of amethystine quartz.    December 24 and 25.    Ribs and thwarts were necessary to distend the canvas boats, and though  we had brought only moulds of each sort, yet we had tools and hands to  make them when required. We also sawed the pine wood into thin planks to  form a floor in each boat, whereon to lay our stores. We made the ribs of  bluegum (eucalyptus). The weather was excessively hot, yet the men worked  hard at the saw-pit notwithstanding; but all our activity was in danger  of being fruitless, for the river each day fell about four inches!    BOAT LAUNCHED.    December 26.    At half-past one P.M. the first boat was launched on the Namoi, and the  keel of the second immediately laid down. The delay occasioned by the  preparation of these boats was more irksome as the waters of the river  continued to subside.    Amongst the objects, which in this country were quite new to me, were the  insects continually buzzing about my tent. Of these, a fly as large as a  small bee, and of a rich green and gold colour, being a species of  stilbum, occasionally surprised me with a hum almost as musical as the  tones of an Eolian harp.    BEES LOAD MY RIFLE WITH HONEY.    But the habits of the bees were very remarkable, judging from a singular  circumstance which occurred respecting my rifle, for I found that a  quantity of wax and honey had been deposited in the barrel, and also in  the hollow part of the ramrod. I had previously observed one of these  bees occasionally enter the barrel of the piece, and it now appeared that  wax and honey had been lodged immediately above the charge, to the depth  of about two inches. The honey was first perceived in the hollow part of  the ramrod; and although an empty, double-barreled gun lay beside the  rifle, neither wax nor honey was found in either of its tubes. The bee,  which I frequently observed about my tent, was as large as the English  bee, and had a sting.    December 28.    This day I sent off one of the men (Stephen Bombelli) with a despatch for  the government at Sydney, giving an account of our journey thus far, and  stating my intention of descending the Namoi in the boats. Bombelli was  mounted on horseback, armed with a pistol, and provided with food for  twelve days, being sufficient to enable him to carry the despatch to  Pewen Bewen, and to return to the depot which I had arranged to establish  here.    EMBARK ON THE NAMOI IN CANVAS BOATS.    December 29.    We launched the second boat, and having loaded both, I left two men in  charge of the carts, bullocks and horses, at Bullabalakit, and embarked,  at last, on the waters of the Namoi, on a voyage of discovery.    IMPEDIMENTS TO THE NAVIGATION.    We passed along several reaches without meeting any impediment, but, at  length, an accumulation of drift timber and gravel brought us up at a  spot where two large trees had fallen across the stream from opposite  banks. From the magnitude of these trunks and others which, interwoven  with rubbish and buried in gravel, supported them, I anticipated a long  delay, but the activity of the whole party was such that a clear passage  was opened in less than half an hour. The sailors swam about like frogs,  and swimming, divided with a cross-cut saw trees under water. I found I  could survey the river as we proceeded by measuring, with a pocket  sextant, the angle subtended by the two ends of a twelve feet rod held in  the second boat, at the opposite end of each reach, the bearing being  observed at the same time. By referring to one of Brewster's tables, the  angle formed by the rod of twelve feet, I ascertained thus the length of  each reach. This operation occasioned a delay of a few seconds only, just  as the last boat arrived in sight of each place of observation.    Several black swans floated before us, and they were apparently not much  alarmed even at the unwonted sight of boats on the Namoi. The evenness of  the banks and reaches, and the depth and stillness of the waters were  such that I might have traced the river downwards, at least so far as  such facilities continued, had our boats been of a stronger material than  canvas.    BOAT STAKED, AND SINKS.    But dead trees lay almost invisible under water, and at the end of a  short reach where I awaited the reappearance of the second boat, we heard  suddenly confused shouts, and on making to the shore, and running to the  spot, I found that the boat had run foul of a sunken tree and had filled  almost immediately. Mr. White had, on the instant, managed to run her  ashore, across another sunken trunk, and thus prevented her from going  down in deep water opposite to a steep bank. By this disaster our whole  stock of tea, sugar, and tobacco, with part of our flour and pork, were  immersed in the water, but fortunately all the gunpowder had been stowed  in the first boat.    THE LEAK PATCHED.    This catastrophe furnished another instance of the activity of the  sailors; the cargo was got out, and the sunken boat being hauled up, a  rent was discovered in the canvas of her larboard bow. This the sailmaker  patched with a piece of canvas; a fire was made; tar was melted and  applied; the boat was set afloat, reloaded, and again underway in an hour  and a half.    SHE AGAIN RUNS FOUL OF A LOG.    Once more upon the waters everything seemed to promise a successful  voyage down the river, but our hopes were doomed to be of short duration,  for as I again awaited the reappearance of the second boat, a shout  similar to the first again rose, and on running across the intervening  land within the river bend, I found her once more on the point of going  down, from similar damage sustained in the STARBOARD bow.    RESOLVE TO PROCEED BY LAND.    It was now near five P.M., and the labours of the day had been sufficient  to convince me that the course of the Namoi could be much more  conveniently traced at that time by a journey on land than with boats of  canvas on the water. We pitched our tents; and on plotting my work I  found we were distant, in a direct line, only about two miles from  Bullabalakit.    December 30.    The cattle from the depot camp arrived at nine A.M., four men having been  sent there early this morning to bring them with the carts and horses to  the place where we had disembarked.    PROVISIONS DAMAGED.    The tea, sugar, and biscuit, having got wet in the sunken boat, I was  compelled to halt this day in order to dry these articles if possible, in  the sun, and the heat being very intense, we were tolerably successful.  The sugar, in a liquid state, was laid out in small quantities on  tarpaulins; the tea was also spread out thinly before the sun, and thrown  about frequently--and thus we were enabled, by the evening, to pack it up  quite dry in canisters; the whole having lost in weight two and a half  pounds. The sugar had crystallised sufficiently to be put up again,  without any danger of fermentation. During many days I had anxiously  watched the smoky red hot sky for some appearance of rain: no dew  nourished the grass, which had become quite yellow, and the river upon  which I set my hopes was rapidly drying up. In my tent the thermometer  generally reached 100 degrees of Fahrenheit during the day. At length the  welcome sound of thunder was heard, and dark clouds cooled the atmosphere  long before sunset. These clouds at length poured a heavy shower on the  yawning earth; flakes of ice or hail accompanied it, and we enjoyed a  cool draught of iced water, where the air had just before been nearly as  warm as the blood.    In emptying the water out of the sunken boat we found a crayfish  resembling those which I had seen in the freshwater lagoons about"]]]
