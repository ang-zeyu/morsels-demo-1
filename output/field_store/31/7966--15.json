Their value, indeed, lies  exclusively in their relation to the practical problems. Where  theoretical questions are to be answered and scientific studies  concerning the laws and variations of the mind are to be undertaken,  the long series of laboratory experiments carried on with patience and  devotion are indispensable and can never be replaced by the short-cut  methods of the tests. But where practical tasks of pedagogy or  jurisprudence or medicine, or especially of commerce and industry, are  before us, the method of tests ought to be sovereign. It can be  adapted to the special situations and can succeed perfectly, if the  task is to discover the outlines of the mental individuality for  particular practical work.    The only real difficulty of the method lies in the ease with which it  can be used. A device which presupposes complicated instruments deters  the layman and will be used only by those who are well trained.  Moreover, the amateur would not think of constructing and adapting  such apparatus himself. But when nothing is necessary but to use words  or numbers or syllables or pictures, or, as in those experiments which  we just described, newspapers and so on, any one feels justified in  applying the scheme or in replacing it by a new apparently better one  according to his caprice. The manifoldness of the proposed tests for  special functions, is therefore enormous to-day. What is needed now is  surely much more that order be brought into this chaos of  propositions, and that definite norms and standards be secured for  certain chief examinations, than that the number of variations simply  be increased.    The chief danger, moreover, lies in the fact that those who are not  accustomed to psychological laboratory research are easily misled.  They fancy that such an experiment can be carried out in a mere  mechanical way without careful study of all the conditions and  accompanying circumstances. Thereby a certain crudeness of procedure  may enter which is not at all suggested by the test method itself. The  psychological layman too seldom recognizes how many other psychical  functions may play a role in the result of the experiment beside the  one which is interesting him at that moment. The well-schooled  laboratory worker almost automatically gives consideration to all such  secondary circumstances. While his experiments may refer to the  process of memory, he will yet at the same time carefully consider the  particular situation as to the emotional setting of the subject, as to  his attention, as to his preceding experience, as to his intelligence,  as to his physiological condition, and many other factors which may  have indirect influence even on the simplest memory test. Hence the  real performance of the experiments ought to be undertaken only by  those who are thoroughly familiar and well trained in psychological  research. And they alone, moreover, can decide what particular form  such an experiment ought to take in a given practical situation. It  must be left to them, for instance, to judge in which cases the mental  function of economic importance ought to be tested after being  resolved into its components and in which it ought to be examined in  its characteristic unity.          XI    CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MEN OF AFFAIRS      While the psychologists have to perform the actual labor, the  representatives of practical life are much better able to indicate the  points at which the psychological levers ought to be applied. In the  past year I have sought contact with several hundred large concerns in  America which belong to many different industrial realms. My time did  not allow me personal observation in so many cases, but everywhere I  begged for information from the leading men. I asked in individual  letters for the particular psychological qualities which from the  standpoint of the management seemed essential for the various kinds of  labor in their establishments. I always inquired to what extent  consideration was given to such psychological points of view at the  appointment of applicants, and asked for material concerning the  question how far individuals who proved to be unfit for one kind of  labor showed fitness at other kinds of work. The replies which I  received from all sides varied from a few meaningless lines to long  documents, which in some cases were composed of detailed reports from  all the department chiefs of a particular concern. The common  fundamental turn was decidedly a feeling of strong interest in the  formulation of the question, which was practically new to all of them.  Whether the answer came from paper mills or machine shops, from  meat-packing houses or from breweries, from electrical or chemical  mills, from railroad or mining companies, from department stores or  from publishing houses, everywhere it was acknowledged that they had  given hardly any conscious attention to the real psychological  dispositions of their employees. They had of course noticed whether  their men were industrious or lazy, honest or dishonest, skillful or  clumsy, peaceful or quarrelsome people, but I had emphasized from the  start in all my letters that such points of view were not before my  mind. The mental qualities for which I asked were the psychological  functions of attention, memory, ideas, imagination, feeling, volition,  suggestibility, ability to learn, ability to discriminate, judgment,  space-sense, time-sense, and so on. It would lead too far here to  discuss why these two groups of characteristics indeed belong to two  different aspects of mental life, and why only the latter is strictly  psychological. The way in which the management is accustomed to look  on their men is the practical way of ordinary life, in which we try to  understand our neighbor by entering into the meaning of his mental  functions and by seeking to grasp what his aim is. But such an  interpretation of the other man's mind is not a psychological  analysis. It gives us the purposes of his inner life, but does not  show us its structure and its component parts. We can abstract from  interpreting and appreciating in order to describe the elements of the  mind which in themselves have no meaning and no value, but which are  the only important factors, if we are to determine psychologically  what we may expect from the individual.    While the replies to my letters showed that hardly any attention had  so far been given to such problems of objective psychology in the  industrial concerns, it became evident that the managers felt  distinctly that here a problem was touched which must be of highest  importance for economic success. From many different sides willingness  was shown to study the problem of employment under the psychological  aspect. As my material came mostly from very large establishments in  which labor of very many different kinds is carried on side by side,  of course I frequently received the assurance that whenever an  industrious energetic man is unsuccessful in one kind of work, a trial  is made with him in another department, and that by such shifting the  right place can often be found for him. Young people, to whom, in  spite of long trial and the best will, it seems impossible to supply  certain automatic machines, become excellent workers at much more  difficult labor in the same establishment. Women who are apparently  careless and inattentive when they have to distribute their attention  over a number of operations do high-class work when they are engaged  in a single activity; and in other cases the opposite is reported.    I may mention a few concrete chance illustrations. In a pencil factory  the women in one department have to grasp with one movement a dozen  pencils, no more and no less. Some learn this at once without effort,  and they earn high wages; others never can learn it in spite of  repeated trials. If those who fail in this department are transferred,  for instance, to the department where the gold-leaf is most carefully  to be applied to the pencils before stamping, very often they show  great fitness in spite of the extreme exactitude needed for this work.  To show how often activities which appear extremely similar may demand  different individuals, if the work is based on different psychical  functions, I may refer to a report from one of the largest  establishments in the country. In the accounting department a large  number of girls are occupied with looking over hundreds of thousands  of slips from which the weekly pay-list is compiled. Each slip  contains six figures and small groups of twenty slips have to be  looked through to see whether those six figures on each correspond.  With moistened forefinger they turn up the slips one by one in much  the same manner that a bank clerk counts money. A good sorter will  turn up the slips so rapidly that a bystander is unable to read a  single figure, and yet she will not overlook an error in thousands of  slips. After the slips are sorted, the operation of obtaining the  totals on each order number is performed with the aid of an adding  machine. The machine operator rolls up the slips of the pile with the  thumb of her left hand and transfers the amount to the proper keys of  the machine. It has been found that the most rapid and accurate girls  at sorting are not seldom useless on the machines. They press the  wrong, keys and make errors in copying the total from the machine  indicators to the file-card. On the other hand, some of the best  machine operators are very slow and inaccurate at the sorting table.  Girls have been found very poor at the work at which they were first  set, and very successful and efficient as soon as they had been  transferred from the one to the other.

After the shepherd had thus obtained the  dragon's head, twilight began to approach. He washed himself nicely,  took the falcon on his shoulder, the hounds behind him, and the bagpipes  under his arm, played as he went, drove the sheep, and proceeded to the  emperor's palace, with the damsel at his side still in terror. When they  came to the town, all the town assembled as to see a wonder. The  emperor, who had seen all his heroism from the hill, called him into  his presence, and gave him his daughter, went immediately to church, had  them married, and held a wedding festival for a week. After this the  prince told him who and whence he was, and the emperor and the whole  town rejoiced still more. Then, as the prince was urgent to go to his  own home, the emperor gave him a large escort, and equipped him for the  journey. When they were in the neighbourhood of the water-mill, the  prince halted his attendants, went inside, cut up the three wands, and  struck the root with them, and the iron door opened at once. In the  vault was a vast multitude of people. The prince ordered them to come  out one by one, and go whither each would, and stood himself at the  door. They came out thus one after another, and lo! there were his  brothers also, whom he embraced and kissed. When the whole multitude had  come out, they thanked him for releasing and delivering them, and went  each to his own home. But he went to his father's house with his  brothers and bride, and there lived and reigned to the end of his days.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 6: This is intended as an insult. \"Azhdaja,\" a dragon, is  feminine in Servian.]          XV    THE GOOD CHILDREN      The Lord was angered at mankind, and for three years there was a great  famine over all the world; nowhere in the world was even a grain of corn  produced, and what people sowed failed to come up from a drought so  great that for three years there was not a drop of rain or dew. For one  year more people managed to live somehow or other, thrashing up what old  corn there was; the rich made money, for corn rose very high. Autumn  came. Where anybody had or purchased old seed, they sowed it; and  entreated the Lord, hoped in the love of God, if God would give  fertility, \"if God would forgive our sins.\" But it was not so. They did  not obtain the love of God. When they cast the seed into the holy earth,  that was the last they saw of it; if it germinated somewhat, if it sent  up shoots, it withered away close to the ground. Woe! and abundance of  it! God's world went on, sorrowed and wept, for now it was manifest  that death by hunger was approaching. They somehow got miserably through  the winter. Spring came. Where anybody had still any grain, they sowed  it. What would come to pass? No blessing was poured forth, for the  thought began with wind. Moreover, there was but little snow in the  winter, and everything dried up so that the black earth remained as it  was. It now came to this--all the world began to perish! The people  died; the cattle perished; as misery carried them, so did the people  proceed.    There was at that time a powerful emperor in a certain empire: as the  young ordinarily cleave to the young, so would he associate only with  young men. Whether in council or in office or in the army, there were  none but young men; no old men had access to anything anywhere. Well, as  young men, unripe in understanding, were the councillors, so was their  counsel also unripe. One year passed; a second passed; then, in the  third year, they saw that misery was already on every side, that it was  already coming to this, that all the world would perish. The young  emperor assembled his young council, and they began to advise after  their fashion; they advised, they advised, and ah! the resolutions they  came to were such that it is a sin even to give an account of their  resolutions! Well, the emperor made proclamation after their advice,  that all old people were to be drowned, in order that, said he, bread  might not be wasted in vain, but there might be a supply of bread for  the young; and that no one should venture, on pain of death, to maintain  or harbour any old man. Well, heralds went about throughout the whole  country, and promulgated the emperor's command everywhere--yea, brigands  seized old people where they chose, and drowned them without mercy.    There were then in a certain place three own brothers, who had an aged  father. When they heard of this edict, they told their father; and their  father said: \"My sons, such is the will of God and the will of the  emperor; take me, let me perish at once, only that you, my children, may  live on. I am already with one foot in the grave,\" \"No, our own daddy!  we will die, but we will not give you up,\" cried the good sons with one  voice, and fell upon his neck; \"we will keep you; we will take from our  own mouths, and will nourish you.\"    The three brothers took their aged father, conducted him into their  cottage, dug under the raised portion of the floor, made up a bed with  sheets and frieze-coats, for straw was scarce, and placed the old man  there, brought him a loaf of bread as black as the holy earth, and  covered him over with the floor. There the old man abode for two or  three months, and his sons brought him clandestinely all they had. The  summer passed without harvest, without mowing. September passed too.  Autumn passed without joy. Winter passed too. Now came spring; the sun  became warm. It was now time to sow, but there was no seed. The world  was large, but there was no seed-corn. When one kind was used up, the  people sowed others, hoping that there would be a crop; but when they  cast it into the holy earth, it rotted there. It seemed as if the end of  the world were come.    Then the three sons went to their father, and asked him: \"Daddy, what  shall we do? It's time to sow. God is now sending showers of rain; the  earth is warmed and is crumbling like grits; but of seed there is not a  blessed grain,\" \"Take, my sons, and strip the old roof off the house,  and thresh the bundles and sow the chaff.\" The lads stripped the house  and barn (anyhow, there was nothing in it), and threshed away till the  sweat ran from their brows, so that they crushed the bundles as small as  poppy-seeds. When they sowed, God gave a blessing; so in a week's time  it became green like rue; in a month's time, in two months' time, there  was corn, ever so much--ever so much, and all manner of seed was found  there: there was rye, there was wheat and barley; yea, maybe, there was  also a plant or two of buckwheat and millet. Wherever you went  throughout the world there was no corn to be seen; all the plain was  overgrown with grasses, steppe-grasses, and thistles, but with _them_  was corn like a forest. How people wondered and were astounded! The fame  thereof went over the whole world, and the news reached the emperor  himself, that in such and such a place there were three own brothers,  and with them corn had sprung up for all the world, and so beautiful,  never was the like beheld! The emperor ordered the three brothers to  appear in the imperial presence.    The brothers heard of it, and smacked the tops of their heads with their  hands. \"Now it will be amen with us!\" They went again to their father.  \"Daddy! they tell us to appear before the emperor. Advise us, daddy,  what to do!\" \"Go, my sons--what will be, will be; and tell the pure  truth before the emperor.\" The brothers started off and went to the  emperor. The emperor inquired menacingly: \"Why, villains, did ye hoard  up corn, when there was such a famine that so many people died of  hunger? Tell the truth; if not I shall order you to be tortured and  racked even unto death.\" The brothers related all as it had been, from  the beginning to the end. \"Now, most gracious emperor, give us over to  any torture whatever, or let thy kindness have compassion on us!\" The  emperor's brow became smooth, his eyes became serene. He then ordered  the old father to be brought before him at once, and made him sit beside  him close to his throne, and hearkened to his counsel till death, and  his sons he rewarded handsomely. He ordered the corn to be collected ear  by ear, and to be rubbed out in men's hands; and sent it about for  seed-corn in all empires, and from it was produced holy corn for all the  world.          XVI    THE DUN HORSE[7]      I    Many years ago there lived in the Pawnee tribe an old woman and her  grandson a boy about sixteen years old. These people had no relations  and were very poor. They were so poor that they were despised by the  rest of the tribe. They had nothing of their own; and always, after the  village started to move the camp from one place to another, these two  would stay behind the rest, to look over the old camp and pick up  anything that the other Indians had thrown away as worn out or useless.  In this way they would sometimes get pieces of robes, wornout moccasins  with holes in them, and bits of meat.    Now, it happened one day, after the tribe had moved away from the camp,  that this old woman and her boy were following along the trail behind  the rest, when they came to a miserable old wornout dun horse, which  they supposed had been abandoned by some Indians. He was thin and  exhausted, was blind of one eye, had a bad sore back, and one of his  forelegs was very much swollen. In fact, he was so worthless that none  of the Pawnees had been willing to take the trouble to try to drive him  along with them. But when the old woman and her boy came along, the boy  said, \"Come now, we will take this old horse, for we can make him carry  our pack.\" So the old woman put her pack on the horse, and drove him  along, but he limped and could only go very slowly.
