Hide in the  earth, thou horrible shadow.\"    Again none saw the ghost but he.    \"What is it your Majesty sees?\" asked one of the nobles.    The Queen dared not permit an answer to be given to this question. She  hurriedly begged her guests to quit a sick man who was likely to grow  worse if he was obliged to talk.    Macbeth, however, was well enough next day to converse with the witches  whose prophecies had so depraved him.    He found them in a cavern on a thunderous day. They were revolving round  a cauldron in which were boiling particles of many strange and horrible  creatures, and they knew he was coming before he arrived.    \"Answer me what I ask you,\" said the King.    \"Would you rather hear it from us or our masters?\" asked the first  witch.    \"Call them,\" replied Macbeth.    Thereupon the witches poured blood into the cauldron and grease into the  flame that licked it, and a helmeted head appeared with the visor on, so  that Macbeth could only see its eyes.    He was speaking to the head, when the first witch said gravely, \"He  knows thy thought,\" and a voice in the head said, \"Macbeth, beware  Macduff, the chieftain of Fife.\" The head then descended Into the  cauldron till it disappeared.    \"One word more,\" pleaded Macbeth.    \"He will not be commanded,\" said the first witch, and then a crowned  child ascended from the cauldron bearing a tree in his hand The child  said--        \"Macbeth shall be unconquerable till       The Wood of Birnam climbs Dunsinane Hill.\"    \"That will never be,\" said Macbeth; and he asked to be told if Banquo's  descendants would ever rule Scotland.    The cauldron sank into the earth; music was heard, and a procession of  phantom kings filed past Macbeth; behind them was Banquo's ghost. In  each king, Macbeth saw a likeness to Banquo, and he counted eight kings.    Then he was suddenly left alone.    His next proceeding was to send murderers to Macduff's castle. They  did not find Macduff, and asked Lady Macduff where he was. She gave  a stinging answer, and her questioner called Macduff a traitor. \"Thou  liest!\" shouted Macduff's little son, who was immediately stabbed, and  with his last breath entreated his mother to fly. The murderers did not  leave the castle while one of its inmates remained alive.    Macduff was in England listening, with Malcolm, to a doctor's tale of  cures wrought by Edward the Confessor when his friend Ross came to tell  him that his wife and children were no more. At first Ross dared not  speak the truth, and turn Macduff's bright sympathy with sufferers  relieved by royal virtue into sorrow and hatred. But when Malcolm said  that England was sending an army into Scotland against Macbeth, Ross  blurted out his news, and Macduff cried, \"All dead, did you say? All my  pretty ones and their mother? Did you say all?\"    His sorry hope was in revenge, but if he could have looked into  Macbeth's castle on Dunsinane Hill, he would have seen at work a force  more solemn than revenge. Retribution was working, for Lady Macbeth was  mad. She walked in her sleep amid ghastly dreams. She was wont to wash  her hands for a quarter of an hour at a time; but after all her washing,  would still see a red spot of blood upon her skin. It was pitiful to  hear her cry that all the perfumes of Arabia could not sweeten her  little hand.    \"Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?\" inquired Macbeth of the  doctor, but the doctor replied that his patient must minister to her own  mind. This reply gave Macbeth a scorn of medicine. \"Throw physic to the  dogs,\" he said; \"I'll none of it.\"    One day he heard a sound of women crying. An officer approached him and  said, \"The Queen, your Majesty, is dead.\" \"Out, brief candle,\" muttered  Macbeth, meaning that life was like a candle, at the mercy of a puff of  air. He did not weep; he was too familiar with death.    Presently a messenger told him that he saw Birnam Wood on the march.  Macbeth called him a liar and a slave, and threatened to hang him if he  had made a mistake. \"If you are right you can hang me,\" he said.    From the turret windows of Dunsinane Castle, Birnam Wood did indeed  appear to be marching. Every soldier of the English army held aloft a  bough which he had cut from a tree in that wood, and like human trees  they climbed Dunsinane Hill.    Macbeth had still his courage. He went to battle to conquer or die, and  the first thing he did was to kill the English general's son in single  combat. Macbeth then felt that no man could fight him and live, and when  Macduff came to him blazing for revenge, Macbeth said to him, \"Go back;  I have spilt too much of your blood already.\"    \"My voice is in my sword,\" replied Macduff, and hacked at him and bade  him yield.    \"I will not yield!\" said Macbeth, but his last hour had struck. He fell.    Macbeth's men were in retreat when Macduff came before Malcolm holding a  King's head by the hair.    \"Hail, King!\" he said; and the new King looked at the old.    So Malcolm reigned after Macbeth; but in years that came afterwards the  descendants of Banquo were kings.          THE COMEDY OF ERRORS        AEGEON was a merchant of Syracuse, which is a seaport in Sicily. His  wife was AEmilia, and they were very happy until AEgeon's manager died,  and he was obliged to go by himself to a place called Epidamnum on the  Adriatic. As soon as she could AEmilia followed him, and after they had  been together some time two baby boys were born to them. The babies were  exactly alike; even when they were dressed differently they looked the  same.    And now you must believe a very strange thing. At the same inn where  these children were born, and on the same day, two baby boys were born  to a much poorer couple than AEmilia and AEgeon; so poor, indeed, were  the parents of these twins that they sold them to the parents of the  other twins.    AEmilia was eager to show her children to her friends in Syracuse,  and in treacherous weather she and AEgeon and the four babies sailed  homewards.    They were still far from Syracuse when their ship sprang a leak, and the  crew left it in a body by the only boat, caring little what became of  their passengers.    AEmilia fastened one of her children to a mast and tied one of the  slave-children to him; AEgeon followed her example with the remaining  children. Then the parents secured themselves to the same masts, and  hoped for safety.    The ship, however, suddenly struck a rock and was split in two, and  AEmilia, and the two children whom she had tied, floated away from  AEgeon and the other children. AEmilia and her charges were picked up by  some people of Epidamnum, but some fishermen of Corinth took the  babies from her by force, and she returned to Epidanmum alone, and very  miserable. Afterwards she settled in Ephesus, a famous town in Asia  Minor.    AEgeon and his charges were also saved; and, more fortunate than  AEmilia, he was able to return to Syracuse and keep them till they were  eighteen. His own child he called Antipholus, and the slavechild he  called Dromio; and, strangely enough, these were the names given to the  children who floated away from him.    At the age of eighteen the son who was with AEgeon grew restless with a  desire to find his brother. AEgeon let him depart with his servant, and  the young men are henceforth known as Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio  of Syracuse.    Let alone, AEgeon found his home too dreary to dwell in, and traveled  for five years. He did not, during his absence, learn all the news of  Syracuse, or he would never have gone to Ephesus.    As it was, his melancholy wandering ceased in that town, where he was  arrested almost as soon as he arrived. He then found that the Duke of  Syracuse had been acting in so tyrannical a manner to Ephesians unlucky  enough to fall into his hands, that the Government of Ephesus had  angrily passed a law which punished by death or a fine of a thousand  pounds any Syracusan who should come to Ephesus. AEgeon was brought  before Solinus, Duke of Ephesus, who told him that he must die or pay a  thousand pounds before the end of the day.    You will think there was fate in this when I tell you that the children  who were kidnaped by the fishermen of Corinth were now citizens of  Ephesus, whither they had been brought by Duke Menaphon, an uncle of  Duke Solinus. They will henceforth be called Antipholus of Ephesus and  Dromio of Ephesus.    Moreover, on the very day when AEgeon was arrested, Antipholus of  Syracuse landed in Ephesus and pretended that he came from Epidamnum in  order to avoid a penalty. He handed his money to his servant Dromio of  Syracuse, and bade him take it to the Centaur Inn and remain there till  he came.    In less than ten minutes he was met on the Mart by Dromio of Ephesus,  his brother's slave, and immediately mistook him for his own Dromio.  \"Why are you back so soon? Where did you leave the money?\" asked  Antipholus of Syracuse.    This Drornio knew of no money except sixpence, which he had received on  the previous Wednesday and given to the saddler; but he did know that  his mistress was annoyed because his master was not in to dinner, and he  asked Antipholus of Syracuse to go to a house called The Phoenix without  delay. His speech angered the hearer, who would have beaten him if he  had not fled. Antipholus of Syracuse them went to The Centaur, found  that his gold had been deposited there, and walked out of the inn.    He was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14300"],[0,"The Life of Napoleon I (Complete) (#15)"],[1,"of Five Hundred. In this Council were the younger deputies,  and with them rested the sole initiation of laws. Thus the young  deputies were to make the laws, but the older deputies were to amend  or reject them; and this nice adjustment of the characteristics of  youth and age, a due blending of enthusiasm with caution, promised to  invigorate the body politic and yet guard its vital interests.  Lastly, in order that the two Councils should continuously represent  the feelings of France, one third of their members must retire for  re-election every year, a device which promised to prevent any violent  change in their composition, such as might occur if, at the end of  their three years' membership, all were called upon to resign at once.    But the real crux of constitution builders had hitherto been in the  relations of the Legislature to the Executive. How should the brain of  the body politic, that is, the Legislature, be connected with the  hand, that is, the Executive? Obviously, so argued all French  political thinkers, the two functions were distinct and must be kept  separate. The results of this theory of the separation of powers were  clearly traceable in the course of the Revolution. When the hand had  been left almost powerless, as in 1791-2, owing to democratic jealousy  of the royal Ministry, the result had been anarchy. The supreme needs  of the State in the agonies of 1793 had rendered the hand omnipotent:  the Convention, that is, the brain, was for some time powerless before  its own instrument, the two secret committees. Experience now showed  that the brain must exercise a general control over the hand, without  unduly hampering its actions. Evidently, then, the deputies of France  must intrust the details of administration to responsible Ministers,  though some directing agency seemed needed as a spur to energy and a  check against royalist plots. In brief, the Committee of Public  Safety, purged of its more dangerous powers, was to furnish the model  for a new body of five members, termed the Directory. This  organism, which was to give its name to the whole period 1795-1799,  was not the Ministry. There was no Ministry as we now use the term.  There were Ministers who were responsible individually for their  departments of State: but they never met for deliberation, or  communicated with the Legislature; they were only heads of  departments, who were responsible individually to the Directors. These  five men formed a powerful committee, deliberating in private on the  whole policy of the State and on all the work of the Ministers. The  Directory had not, it is true, the right of initiating laws and of  arbitrary arrest which the two committees had freely exercised during  the Terror. Its dependence on the Legislature seemed also to be  guaranteed by the Directors being appointed by the two legislative  Councils; while one of the five was to vacate his office for  re-election every year. But in other respects the directorial powers  were almost as extensive as those wielded by the two secret  committees, or as those which Bonaparte was to inherit from the  Directory in 1799. They comprised the general control of policy in  peace and war, the right to negotiate treaties (subject to  ratification by the legislative councils), to promulgate laws voted by  the Councils and watch over their execution, and to appoint or dismiss  the Ministers of State.    Such was the constitution which was proclaimed on September 22nd,  1795, or 1st Vendemiaire, Year IV., of the revolutionary calendar. An  important postscript to the original constitution now excited fierce  commotions which enabled the young officer to repair his own shattered  fortunes. The Convention, terrified at the thought of a general  election, which might send up a malcontent or royalist majority,  decided to impose itself on France for at least two years longer. With  an effrontery unparalleled in parliamentary annals, it decreed that  the law of the new constitution, requiring the re-election of  one-third of the deputies every year, should now be applied to itself;  and that the rest of its members should sit in the forthcoming  Councils. At once a cry of disgust and rage arose from all who were  weary of the Convention and all its works. \"Down with the  two-thirds!\" was the cry that resounded through the streets of Paris.  The movement was not so much definitely royalist as vaguely  malcontent. The many were enraged by the existing dearth and by the  failure of the Revolution to secure even cheap bread. Doubtless the  royalists strove to drive on the discontent to the desired goal, and  in many parts they tinged the movement with an unmistakably Bourbon  tint. But it is fairly certain that in Paris they could not alone have  fomented a discontent so general as that of Vendemiaire. That they  would have profited by the defeat of the Convention is, however,  equally certain. The history of the Revolution proves that those who  at first merely opposed the excesses of the Jacobins gradually drifted  over to the royalists. The Convention now found itself attacked in the  very city which had been the chosen abode of Liberty and Equality.  Some thirty thousand of the Parisian National Guards were determined  to give short shrift to this Assembly that clung so indecently to  life; and as the armies were far away, the Parisian malcontents seemed  masters of the situation. Without doubt they would have been but for  their own precipitation and the energy of Buonaparte.    But how came he to receive the military authority which was so  potently to influence the course of events? We left him in Fructidor  disgraced: we find him in the middle of Vendemiaire leading part of  the forces of the Convention. This bewildering change was due to the  pressing needs of the Republic, to his own signal abilities, and to  the discerning eye of Barras, whose career claims a brief notice.    Paul Barras came of a Provencal family, and had an adventurous life  both on land and in maritime expeditions. Gifted with a robust frame,  consummate self-assurance, and a ready tongue, he was well equipped  for intrigues, both amorous and political, when the outbreak of the  Revolution gave his thoughts a more serious turn. Espousing the  ultra-democratic side, he yet contrived to emerge unscathed from the  schisms which were fatal to less dextrous trimmers. He was present at  the siege of Toulon, and has striven in his \"Memoires\" to disparage  Buonaparte's services and exalt his own. At the crisis of Thermidor  the Convention intrusted him with the command of the \"army of the  interior,\" and the energy which he then displayed gained for him the  same position in the equally critical days of Vendemiaire. Though he  subsequently carped at the conduct of Buonaparte, his action proved  his complete confidence in that young officer's capacity: he at once  sent for him, and intrusted him with most important duties. Herein  lies the chief chance of immortality for the name of Barras; not that,  as a terrorist, he slaughtered royalists at Toulon; not that he was  the military chief of the Thermidorians, who, from fear of their own  necks, ended the supremacy of Robespierre; not even that he degraded  the new _regime_ by a cynical display of all the worst vices of the  old; but rather because he was now privileged to hold the stirrup for  the great captain who vaulted lightly into the saddle.    The present crisis certainly called for a man of skill and  determination. The malcontents had been emboldened by the timorous  actions of General Menou, who had previously been intrusted with the  task of suppressing the agitation. Owing to a praiseworthy desire to  avoid bloodshed, that general wasted time in parleying with the most  rebellious of the \"sections\" of Paris. The Convention now appointed  Barras to the command, while Buonaparte, Brune, Carteaux, Dupont,  Loison, Vachot, and Vezu were charged to serve under him.[32] Such was  the decree of the Convention, which therefore refutes Napoleon's later  claim that he was in command, and that of his admirers that he was  second in command.    Yet, intrusted from the outset by Barras with important duties, he  unquestionably became the animating spirit of the defence. \"From the  first,\" says Thiebault, \"his activity was astonishing: he seemed to be  everywhere at once: he surprised people by his laconic, clear, and  prompt orders: everybody was struck by the vigour of his arrangements,  and passed from admiration to confidence, from confidence to  enthusiasm.\" Everything now depended on skill and enthusiasm. The  defenders of the Convention, comprising some four or five thousand  troops of the line, and between one and two thousand patriots,  gendarmes, and Invalides, were confronted by nearly thirty thousand  National Guards. The odds were therefore wellnigh as heavy as those  which menaced Louis XVI. on the day of his final overthrow. But the  place of the yielding king was now filled by determined men, who saw  the needs of the situation. In the earlier scenes of the Revolution,  Buonaparte had pondered on the efficacy of artillery in  street-fighting--a fit subject for his geometrical genius. With a few  cannon, he knew that he could sweep all the approaches to the palace;  and, on Barras' orders, he despatched a dashing cavalry officer,  Murat--a name destined to become famous from Madrid to Moscow--to  bring the artillery from the neighbouring camp of Sablons. Murat  secured them before the malcontents of Paris could lay hands on them;  and as the \"sections\" of Paris had yielded up their own cannon after  the affrays of May, they now lacked the most potent force in  street-fighting. Their actions were also paralyzed by divided  counsels: their commander, an old general named Danican, moved his men  hesitatingly; he wasted precious minutes in parleying, and thus gave  time to Barras' small but compact force to"]]]
