We may be unable to resist the temptation to loot  Germany more or less if we conquer her. We are already actively engaged  in piracy against her, stealing her ships and selling them in our prize  courts, instead of honestly detaining them until the war is over and  keeping a strict account of them. When gentlemen rise in the House of  Commons and say that they owe Germans money and do not intend to pay it,  one must face the fact that there will be a strong popular demand for  plunder. War, after all, is simply a letting loose of organized murder,  theft, and piracy on a foe; and I have no doubt the average Englishman  will say to me what Falstaff said to Pistol concerning his share in the  price of the stolen fan: \"Reason, you rogue, reason: do you think I'll  endanger my soul _gratis_?\" To which I reply, \"If you can't resist the  booty, take it frankly, and know yourself for half patriot, half  brigand; but don't talk nonsense about disablement. Cromwell tried it in  Ireland. He had better have tried Home Rule. And what Cromwell could not  do to Ireland we cannot do to Germany.\"      *The Sensible People.*    Finally we come to the only body of opinion in which there is any hope  of civilization: the opinion of the people who are bent, not on  gallantry nor revenge nor plunder nor pride nor panic nor glory nor any  of the invidiousnesses of patriotism, but on the problem of how to so  redraw the map of Europe and reform its political constitutions that  this abominable crime and atrocious nuisance, a European war, shall not  easily occur again. The map is very important; for the open sores which  have at last suppurated and burst after having made the world uneasy for  years, were produced by altering the colour of Alsace and Lorraine and  of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the map. And the new map must be settled,  not by conquest, but by consent of the people immediately concerned. One  of the broken treaties of Europe which has been mentioned less  frequently of late than the Belgian treaty is the treaty of Prague, by  which a plebiscite was to have been taken on the subject of the  nationality of Schleswig and Holstein. That plebiscite has never been  taken. It may have to be taken, with other plebiscites, before this war  is settled.      *German Unity Inviolable.*    But here let me warn those who are hoping for a disintegrated Germany  like that which Thackeray ridiculed, that their hopes are vain. The  southern Germans, the, friendliest, most easy-going people in the world  (as far as I know the world) dislike the Prussians far more heartily  than we do; but they know that they are respected and strong and big as  part of United Germany, and that they were weak and despised and petty  as separate kingdoms. Germany will hold together. No doubt the Germans  may reasonably say to the Prussian drill sergeant and his master  Hohenzollern, \"A nice mess you have made of your job after all we have  endured from you because we believed you could make us invincible. We  thought that if you were hard masters you were at any rate good  grenadiers; but here are these piffling little Belgians and these  Russians who were beaten by the Japanese, and these English who made  such a poor show against a handful of Boer farmers, fighting and  organizing just as well as you. So, as the French and English are  organized as a republic and an extremely limited monarchy, we will try  how that sort of constitution will suit us.\" But they will not break up:  on the contrary, they are much more likely to extend the German  community by incorporating German Austria. And as this would raise the  question whether Hohenzollern or Hapsburg should rule the roost, the  simplest solution would be to get rid of them both, and take the sooner  or later inevitable step into the democratic republican form of  Government to which Europe is visibly tending, though \"this king  business,\" as my American correspondents call it, has certain  conveniences when it is limited and combined with an aristocracy also  limited by primogeniture and politically controlled by a commonalty into  which all but the eldest brothers in the aristocratic families fall,  thus making the German segregation of the _adel_ class impossible. Such  a monarchy, especially when the monarch is a woman, as in Holland today,  and in England under Victoria, is a fairly acceptable working substitute  for a formal republic in old civilizations with inveterate monarchical  traditions, absurd as it is in new and essentially democratic States. At  any rate, it is conceivable that the western allies might demand the  introduction of some such political constitution in Germany and Austria  as a guarantee; for though the demand would not please Russia, some of  Russia's demands will not please us; and there must be some give and  take in the business.      *Limits of Constitutional Interference.*    Let us consider this possibility for a moment. First, it must be firmly  postulated that civilized nations cannot have their political  constitutions imposed on them from without if the object of the  arrangement is peace and stability. If a victorious Germany were to  attempt to impose the Prussian constitution on France and England, they  would submit to it just as Ireland submitted to Dublin Castle, which, to  say the least, would not be a millennial settlement. Profoundly as we  are convinced that our Government of India is far better than any native  Indian government could be (the assumption that \"natives\" could govern  at all being made for the sake of argument with due reluctance), it is  quite certain that until it becomes as voluntary as the parliamentary  government of Australia, and has been modified accordingly, it will  remain an artificial, precarious, and continually threatening political  structure. Nevertheless, we need not go to the opposite extreme and  conclude that a political constitution must fit a country so accurately  that it must be home-made to measure. Europe has a stock of ready-made  constitutions, both Monarchical and Republican, which will fit any  western European nation comfortably enough. We are at present  considerably bothered by the number of Germans who, though their own  country and constitution is less than a day's journey away, settle here  and marry Englishwomen without feeling that our constitution is  unbearable. Englishmen are never tired of declaring that \"they do things  better abroad\" (as a matter of fact they often do), and that the ways of  Prussia are smarter than the ways of Paddington. It is therefore quite  possible that a reach-me-down constitution proposed, not by the  conquerors, but by an international congress with no interest to serve  but the interests of peace, might prove acceptable enough to a nation  thoroughly disgusted with its tyrants.      *Physician: Heal Thyself.*    Now a congress which undertook the Liberalization of Germany would  certainly not stop there. If we invite a congress to press for a  democratization of the German constitution, we must consent to the  democratization of our own. If we send the Kaiser to St. Helena (or  whatever the title of the Chiselhurst villa may be) we must send Sir  Edward Grey there, too. For if on the morrow of the peace we may all  begin to plot and plan one another's destruction over again in the  secrecy of our Foreign Office, so that in spite of Parliament and free  democratic institutions the Foreign Secretary may at any moment step  down from the Foreign Office to the House of Commons and say, \"I  arranged yesterday with the ambassador from Cocagne that England is to  join his country in fighting Brobdingnag; so vote me a couple of hundred  millions, and off with you to the trenches,\" we shall be just where we  were before as far as any likelihood of putting an end to war is  concerned. The congress will certainly ask us to pledge ourselves that  if we shake the mailed fist at all we shall shake it publicly, and that  though we may keep our sword ready (let me interject in passing that  disarmament is all nonsense: nobody is going to disarm after this  experience) it shall be drawn by the representatives of the nation, and  not by Junker diplomatists who despise and distrust the nation, and have  planned war behind its back for years. Indeed they will probably demur  to its being drawn even by the representative of the nation until the  occasion has been submitted to the judgment of the representatives of  the world, or such beginnings of a world representative body as may be  possible. That is the true _Weltpolitik_.      *The Hegemony of Peace.*    For the main business of the settlement, if it is to have any serious  business at all, must be the establishment of a Hegemony of Peace, as  desired by all who are really capable of high civilization, and  formulated by me in the daily Press in a vain attempt to avert this  mischief whilst it was brewing. Nobody took the smallest public notice  of me; so I made a lady in a play say \"Not bloody likely,\" and instantly  became famous beyond the Kaiser, beyond the Tsar, beyond Sir Edward  Grey, beyond Shakespeare and Homer and President Wilson, the papers  occupying themselves with me for a whole week just as they are now  occupying themselves with the war, and one paper actually devoting a  special edition to a single word in my play, which is more than it has  done for the Treaty of London (1839). I concluded then that this was a  country which really could not be taken seriously. But the habits of a  lifetime are not so easily broken; and I am not afraid to produce  another dead silence by renewing my good advice, as I can easily recover  my popularity by putting still more shocking expressions into my next  play, especially now that events have shewn that I was right on the  point of foreign policy.      *East Is East; and West Is West.*    I repeat, then, that there should be a definite understanding that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1364"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive; Or, Two Miles a Minute on the Rails (#15)"],[1,".\"    \"I'll say Tom is being careful,\" thought Ned, as he stepped out through  the runway toward the erection shed.    Before he reached the entrance to the huge shed, however, Ned chanced  to look down the enclosure. There were several arc lights burning, but  even these only furnished a dim illumination for the whole yard.    He supposed that four watchmen were tramping their several beats along  the inside of the stockade and close to the trolley-track. But when he  saw an instant gleam of light down there, close to the ground, Ned did  not believe that it was the flash of a torch in the hand of any sentry.    \"Funny,\" he muttered. \"That's outside the fence, or I'm much mistaken.  I wonder now--\"    He turned from the door of the shed, left the runway, and began walking  toward the distant point at which he had seen the mysterious flash of  light.          Chapter XV    The Enemy Still Active      Ned was dressed in a dark business suit, so he was not likely to be  observed from a distance, for it was a starless night. Half way to the  end of the great yard he began to wonder if the light he had seen might  not have been an hallucination.    He doubted very much if anybody was creeping about outside the fence.  The boards were close together, with scarcely a crack half an inch wide  anywhere. A light out there--    It flashed again. He was positive of it this time, and of its locality  as well. It could be nobody who had any honest business about the Swift  Construction Company's premises. It was not Koku, for ordinarily the  giant would not use an electric torch.    Ned did not know where any of the watchmen were who were acting as  sentinels. In fact, as it appeared later, three of them had been called  off their beats by Tom himself to help in some necessary task inside  the shed. The young inventor was getting ready to run the huge  locomotive out upon the yard-track.    Remembering vividly the attempt which had been made some weeks before  to blow up the Hercules 0001, it was only natural that Ned should  suspect that the flash of light he had seen revealed the presence of  some ill-conditioned person lurking just beyond the fence.    A man might be crouching there prepared to hurl an explosive bomb over  the fence when the locomotive was brought around as far as that spot.  Or was the villain foolish enough to attempt to enter the enclosure by  surmounting the fence?    Ned, keeping close to the ground, crossed the rails in the fortunate  shadow of one of the posts. There he found a place where, with his back  to a pole-prop right at this curve in the trolley system, the shadow  enfolded him completely.    Had his movements been marked by the person outside the fence?  Ned  waited several long and anxious minutes for some move from out there.  Then something rather unexpected occurred. For the past ten minutes he  had forgotten about the test of the Hercules 0001 which Tom had  promised.    With a blast of its siren the huge electric locomotive burst out of the  shed and thundered around the track. It smote Ned Newton's mind  suddenly that the inventor was going to \"take a chance\" on this evening  and try to get some speed out of the huge machine.    The electric headlight cast a broad cone of white and dazzling light  across the yard. It suddenly struck full upon the spot where Ned Newton  crouched; but the upright against which he leaned was broad enough to  hide him completely.    Looking up at the top of the stockade at that moment of illumination,  the young financial manager of the Swift Construction Company beheld a  crawling figure nearing the wire entanglements on the summit of the  fence.    The unknown man was climbing by means of a notched pole. Ned could not  see that he bore any bulky object in his hands; indeed, he needed both  of them to aid him to climb. But the man's right hand was reaching  upward, above his head.    The Hercules 0001 came roaring on. Its cone of light passed beyond  Ned's station. In a few seconds it reached the spot, and roared on. Ned  had not made a move. It seemed to him that he could not move or speak.    The onrush of the electric locomotive all but swept the young fellow  from his feet. It had come and gone in an instant!    \"He's making more than fifteen or twenty miles an hour, all right,\"  muttered Ned.    Then he flashed another glance up at the figure outside the fence. The  man's cap showed above the top of the boards. He seemed to be dragging  something up to him from below--something that hung and swung around  and around a few feet from the ground.    Ned was about to dart out of concealment and hail the fellow.  He was  not armed, nor could he get out of the stockade near this point. He  feared what the marauder intended, and he felt that he must frighten  him away.    \"Suppose that is a bomb and he means to fling it in front of Tom's  locomotive?\" thought the anxious Ned.    He again saw the stranger's right hand reach up above his head.  But he  had no bomb in his hand. Ned suddenly shrieked a word of warning! It  had come to him what the man was doing and what the result of his act  would be.    The wire-cutters bit on one of the copper wires. There followed a flash  of blue flame, and the man screamed. He dropped the thing swinging  below him and involuntarily grabbed at the wires with his left hand.    He was caught, then! The crackling intermittent shocks of electric  fluid passed through his body in fiery sequence. His limbs writhed. He  mouthed horribly, and croaking gasps came from between his wide open  jaws.    The Hercules 0001 had rounded the enclosure and was coming down upon  its second lap. The cone of white radiance from the headlight fell upon  the writhing body of the victim on the wires.  The locomotive siren  emitted a blast that almost deafened Ned.    The monster ground to a stop. Tom swung himself half out of the cab  window beside the controller.    \"Who's that?\" he yelled. Then he saw Ned below him. \"Who is that  fellow?\"    \"No friend of yours, Tom, I believe,\" returned his financial manager in  a shaking voice.    \"Where's Rad? Rad!\" Tom shouted at the top of his voice.    \"I's comm', Massa Tom,\" rejoined the colored man.    \"Never mind coming here! Get a move on, and get to the switchboard.  Turn the current out of the fence wires.    \"Yis, sir, I'll go Massa Tom,\" declared the old man.    \"Is he a spotter, Ned?\" demanded the inventor.    \"He's no friend. I am going out by the gate. He's got something there  that means harm, I believe. Do you think he's killed, Tom?\"    \"Only ought to be. Not enough current to kill him. But he's badly  burned and--and--well! I bet he won't care to fool around the works  again.\"    Ned dashed away to an entrance. A watchman came running, opened the  small gate, and followed Ned into the open.    Before they arrived at the vicinity of the accident Rad had got to the  switchboard. The electricity was shut out of the stockade wires.    Ned uttered another shout. He saw the writhing body of the shocked man  fall from the stockade. When he and the watchman got to the spot the  fellow lay upon his back, groaning and sobbing; but Ned saw at once  that he was more frightened than hurt.    \"Well, you did it that time!\" exclaimed the young financial manager.  \"And I hope you got enough.\"    \"You--you demons!\" gasped the man. \"I'll have the law on you--\"    \"Sure you will,\" cackled the watchman. \"You had every right in the  world to try to cut those wires, of course, and get into the yard of  the works. Sure! The judge will believe you all right.\"    Ned was, meanwhile, staring closely at the fallen man. Tom had come  down from the locomotive and was close to the fence.    \"Who is he?\" demanded the inventor. \"Not O'Malley?\"    Ned stepped to the fence and whispered:    \"It's the other fellow. The little chap with the Vandyke. He's dressed  like a tramp, but it's the same man.\"    \"Is he badly hurt?\" demanded Tom.    \"His temper is, Boss,\" said the watchman callously. \"And say! I know  this fellow. He works for the Blatz Detective Agency. I used to work  for those folks myself. His name is Myrick--Joe Myrick.\"    \"Ned,\" said Tom sternly, \"go to the office and call the police.  I'll  make him tell why he was here. And I'll make the Blatz people explain,  too. Hullo! what's that?\"    Ned had seized the rope he had seen in Myrick's hand, and from a patch  of weeds drew a two-gallon oil-can.    \"What you got there, Ned?\" repeated the young inventor.    \"Whatever it is, I am going to be mighty easy with it. I think this  scoundrel was trying to get it over the fence and into the way of the  locomotive.\"    \"You can't hang anything on me,\" said Myrick, suddenly. \"I was just  climbing up to the top of the fence to get a squint at that contraption  you've built. You can't hang anything on me.\"    \"He's evidently feeling better,\" said Tom, scornfully. \"Nugent, don't  let him get away from you. Go call the police, Ned. And take care of  that can until we can find out what's in it.\"    Later, when the police had removed Joe Myrick and the mysterious can  had been deposited in a tub of water in the open lot until its contents  could be examined, Tom said to his chum:    \"I was just working up some speed on the locomotive. The speedometer  indicated fifty-five when I saw that fellow sprawling up there on the  fence. I would not have dared go much faster in any case.\"    \"Why, you weren't half trying, Tom!\" cried the delighted Ned.    \"She did slide around easy, didn't she? Fifty-five on an almost  circular track is a good showing. I am not so scared as I was, my boy.\"    \"You think that on a straight track you might accomplish what you set  out to do?\"    \"It looks like it. At any rate, I shall risk a trial on the H. & P. A.  tracks. I'm going to take her West. Be ready on Monday, Ned, for I  shall want you with me,\" declared Tom Swift.          Chapter XVI    Off for the West      Of course, as Tom supposed"]]]
