A small reef lies between four  and five miles N. E. by E. from the largest and easternmost of these  isles; it is covered at half tide, and therefore dangerous, but we had 7  to 8 fathoms at less than a mile distance, on the inside.    At noon, the depth was 8 fathoms, the largest North-point Isle, which is  nearly separated into two, was distant four miles, and our situation was  as under:      Latitude observed to the north,                 21 deg. 56' 17\"  Pier Head top, bore                             S. 38 E.  Northumberland Island, peak marked 'h',           N. 15 W.  North-point I., westernmost, highest part,      S. 56 W.  North-point I., largest,                  S. 37 to 16 W.      In steering W. by N., rippling water was seen ahead at one o'clock. and  the depth diminishing to 4 fathoms, we hauled a little to the southward  and then resumed our course. This rippling seems to have been on a part  of the same shoal near which captain Cook anchored in 3 fathoms; for it  lies five miles from the North-point Isles, and as he says, \"half way  between them and three small islands which lie directly without them.\"    [EAST COAST. BROAD SOUND.]    Our course for the west side of Broad Sound passed close to some low,  flat isles, lying to the south-east of the peaked West Hill set from Pier  Head. At dusk I sought to anchor behind the hill, for it had the  appearance of being separated from the main land; but the water being too  shallow, we hauled off upon a wind. At ten o'clock, however, the breeze  having become light and the sea gone down, an anchor was dropped in 5  fathoms, sandy bottom; whence the top of West Hill bore N. 68 deg. W. three  miles. A flood tide was found running from the N. N. E., one mile and a  quarter per hour.    THURSDAY 9 SEPTEMBER 1802    In the morning I landed with the botanical gentlemen, and wished to  ascend the top of the hill; but the brush wood was too thick to be  penetrable. Upon a projecting head on the north-east side, I took a part,  and about half way up the hill on the south-east side, the remainder of a  set of bearings, which included many of the Northumberland Isles not  before seen, and other of the Flat Isles within Broad Sound. The furthest  visible part of the main land towards Cape Palmerston, was distant about  five leagues, and behind it was a hill to which, from its form, I gave  the name of _Mount Funnel_; the shore both to the north and south was  low, and the Flat Isles to the southward of the ship were mostly over-run  with mangroves. I did not go round West Hill, and could not see whether  it were connected with the main land, or not; but if joined, it must be  by a very low isthmus. The bearings at this station, most essential to  the connection of the survey, were these:      Main coast, the extremes,                          N. 1 deg. and S. 10 deg. 45'  E.  Pier Head, the top,                                          S. 61  25  E.  Northumberland Isles, peak marked 'h',                       N. 61  45  E.  Northumberland Isles, high northmost marked 'i', dist. 11 L. N. 19  15  E.      The stone of the hill had in it specks of quartz or feldtspath, and was  not much unlike that of Pier Head; but it had a more basaltic appearance.  A piece of it applied to the theodolite, drew the needle two degrees out  of its direction, and yet the bearings did not show any great difference  from the true variation; for an amplitude taken on board the ship by Mr.  Flinders, when the head was N. N. E, gave 6 deg. 18', or corrected to the  meridian, 7 deg. 17' east, and the variation on the eastern side of the hill  was 8 deg. 15', according to the back bearing of Pier Head.    From an observation of the sun's upper and lower limbs in an artificial  horizon, the latitude was 21 deg. 50' 18\", and the ship bore from thence S.  68 deg. E. two miles and a half; the latitude of the ship should therefore  have been 21 deg. 51' 14\"; but a meridian altitude observed to the north by  lieutenant Flinders, gave 21 deg. 49' 54\"; and I believe that altitudes from  the sea horizon can never be depended on nearer than to one minute, on  account of the variability of the horizontal refraction. From this cause  it was that, when possible, we commonly observed the latitude on board  the ship both to the north and south, taking the sun's altitude one way  and his supplement the other, and the mean of the two results was  considered to be true; separately, they often differed 1', 2', and even  3', and sometimes they agreed. The observation to the north most commonly  gave the least south latitude, but not always, nor was there any regular  coincidence between the results and the heights of the barometer or  thermometer; though in general, the more hazy the weather, the greater  were the differences. At this time, the wind was light from the eastward  and weather hazy; the thermometer stood at 72 deg., and barometer at 30.15  inches.    At two o'clock we got under way to go up Broad Sound, it being then near  low water. After steering south-east one mile, the depth rapidly  diminished and we tacked; but the ship was set upon a bank of sand, where  she hung five minutes and then swung off. I afterwards steered nearer to  the shore, in deeper water; and at dusk the anchor was dropped in 5  fathoms, sandy bottom, between the Flat Isles and the main, West Hill  bearing N. 35 deg. W. three leagues; the master sounded towards the coast,  which was five miles off, and found the deepest water to be on that side.  In the morning [FRIDAY 10 SEPTEMBER 1802] the wind had shifted to south,  and we beat up in a channel formed by the Flat Isles and the shoals  attached to them, on one side, and the shelving banks from the main  coast, on the other. We had the assistance of a strong flood tide till  eleven o'clock; at which time the anchor was let go, one mile from the  north end of the 4th Flat Island.    I landed immediately, with the botanists; and at the south-east end of  the island, which is a little elevated, took bearings and the meridian  altitude of both limbs of the sun from an artificial horizon. The  latitude deduced was 22 deg. 8' 33\"; and the ship bearing N. 19 deg. 30' W., two  miles, it should have been for her, 22 deg. 6' 40\"; but lieutenant Flinders'  observation to the north gave 22 deg. 5' 19\", or 1' 21\" less, nearly as on  the preceding day; and it was ascertained that the difference arose  neither from the eye nor the instrument. Amongst the bearings were,    West Hill, the top,                            N. 16 deg. 40' W.  Northumberland Isles. the peak marked 'h',     N. 25  15  E.  Long Island, extreme of the north point,       N. 73  35  E.  Upper Head, on the west shore up Broad Sound,  S. 39  55  E.    The 4th Flat Isle is about one mile long, and there is a smaller lying  off its south-east end; they are a little elevated, and bear grass and  small trees; but the shores are covered with mangroves, and surrounded  with extensive flats of mud and sand. The main coast, from which they lie  two or three miles, is also low, with mangroves and shelving mud banks;  but there is a deep channel between, of a mile in width. In the evening,  when the flood made, we steered into this channel with a light  sea-breeze; but not having time to clear it before dark, the anchor was  dropped in 4 fathoms at six o'clock.    My attention was attracted this evening by the vast extent of mud left  dry on each side of the channel, and I ordered particular attention to be  paid to the tides during the night. At eleven o'clock, when the flood had  ceased running, the depth was sounded and the lead line measured, and the  same at half past five in the morning [SATURDAY 11 SEPTEMBER 1802] when  it was low water; the difference was no less than thirty-two feet, and it  wanted a day of being full moon; so that the springs may reach two or  three feet higher. The flood set S. by E., but its greatest rate did not  exceed one mile and three quarters an hour.    At daylight the wind was south-east, directly against us. We backed and  filled, drifting up with the flood between the shoals on each side, and  having the Lady Nelson and a boat ahead; but on approaching the end of  the channel, our passage into the sound was blocked up by a bank running  across, upon which there was not water enough for the ship by a fathom,  and we therefore anchored. At nine the tide had risen a fathom. and we  passed over into the open sound; the depth immediately increasing to 4  and 7 fathoms, reduced to low water. So long as the flood continued  running we worked up the sound; and when it ceased, anchored three miles  from a shallow opening in the low western shore, the second which had  been observed. We again proceeded upwards with the evening's tide until  dusk; and at nine next morning [SUNDAY 12 SEPTEMBER 1802] passed a fifth  opening, and anchored abreast of the hilly projection on its east side,  which I have named _Upper Head_, in 4 fathoms, soft bottom, two-thirds of  a mile from the shore. This was the first place on the main where there  was any prospect of being able to land; for the western shore, thus far  up, was equally low, and as much over-run with mangroves and defended by  muddy flats, as the shores of Keppel Bay.    It being my intention to explore the head of Broad Sound with the brig  and whale boat, a situation where tents could be fixed and an easy  communication held with the ship during my absence, was the object now  sought; and I immediately went with a party of the gentlemen, to  ascertain how far Upper Head"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13127"],[0,"Observations on the Mussulmauns of India (#15)"],[1,"ign; if the King's  dunkah[15] be heard abroad, the people hide their chattahs, and even  descend from their carriages, elephants, horses, or palkies, standing with  their hands folded, in all humility, to make obeisance to the  King,--resuming them only when the royal cortege has moved out of sight. I  have known many of the first nobility in the Court of Oude, and English  gentlemen in the King's suite, exposed to the rays of the morning sun,  during the hottest season of the year; in these airings, the King alone  has the benefit of a chattah, except the Resident happens to be of the  party, who being always received as an equal, is privileged to the chattah,  the chowrie, and the hookha; indulgences of which those only who have  lived in India can possibly estimate the true value.    But to my subject:--The saddle is adorned with Hosein's chain armour, gold  turban, a richly set sword, with an embroidered belt: some of the family  and friends attend respectfully near the horse. Then follow the bearers of  incense, in gold censers, suspended to chains, which they wave about,  fumigating the air with the refreshing smell of lahbaun,[16]--a  sweet-scented resin from the cedar of Lebanon, I imagine, though some  suppose it to be the frankincense noticed in Scripture.    Next in the cavalcade is a chanter or reader of the Musseeah, who selects  passages from that well-arranged work suited to the time when Hosein's  person was the mark for Yuzeed's arrows, and which describe his conduct on  the trying occasion; one or two couplets being chanted, the procession  advances in slow time, halting every five minutes on the way from the  beginning to the end of the march. The reader is attended by the  proprietor of the Tazia display, and his many relatives and friends,  bare-footed, and without any covering on their heads;--many of these  persons throw chaff on their heads,[17] expressive of grief, and whilst  the Musseeah is chanted, their boisterous expressions of sorrow are  painfully severe to the mere observer of the scene.    The Tazia then follows, surrounded by banners, and covered with a canopy  upheld by silver poles in the hands of the supporters, according to the  general style of conveying their dead at the funerals of the Mussulmauns.  The canopy is of green, bordered and embroidered with gold. The model of  Cossum's tomb follows in succession, which is covered with gold cloth, and  has a canopy also supported over it, in the same way, by poles carried by  several men. The palkie and chundole of silver and tissue are next seen;  the trays of Mayndhie, the flowers of uberuck, and the other paraphernalia  of the marriage ceremony, follow in due order. Then the camels and  elephants, conveying the tent equipage and luggage of Hosein, form a long  train, representing the supposed style of his march from Medina to  Kraabaallah.    The last and most judicious feature in the arrangement is the several  elephants with confidential servants, distributing bread and money to the  poor, who are thus attracted to the rear in countless numbers, leaving the  cavalcade in quiet possession of the space of roadway uncrowded by the  multitude. The bread given on these occasions is in great esteem amongst  the females, who receive a small portion from the followers on their  return from Kraabaallah with veneration, for the Emaum's sake, in whose  name it is given. I have often been led to the remembrance of past times  by this act of theirs, when the cross-buns of Good-Friday were esteemed by  the aged women as possessing virtues beyond the mere substance of the cake.    The whole line of march is guarded in each procession by burkhandhars[18]  (matchlock men), who fire singly, at intervals on the way. Several bands  of music are dispersed in the cavalcade, performing solemn dirge-like airs,  peculiar to the style of composition in Hindoostaun and well-suited to the  occasion--muffled drums and shrill trumpets, imitating the reiteration of  'Hasan, Hosein', when Mortem is performed. I remember a fine female  elephant, belonging to King Ghauzee ood deen Hyder, which had been so well  instructed, as to keep time with the soundings from her proboscis with the  occasional Mortems. I cannot say that she clearly pronounced the names of  the two sons of Ali, yet the regularity of keeping time with the music and  the human voices was of itself sufficient to excite admiration--the  Natives declare that she pronounces the names distinctly. Her name is  Hoseinie, the feminine of Hosein.    Amongst the many varieties of Native musical instruments I have seen in  India, the kettle-drum is the most simple and singular, which I will take  the liberty of describing:--It is of well-baked earth, moulded in the  usual way, and very similar in shape to those of the Royal Horse Guards. A  globe of the common size, divided into exact halves, would be about the  dimension and shape of a pair of Indian manufacture; the parchment is  strained over the open mouth, with a thin hoop to fix it firm; the  slightest pressure with the fingers on this hoop draws it into tune. The  simplicity of this accompaniment to the human voice, when touched by the  fingers, very much in the way Europeans use the tambourine, is only to be  appreciated by those who have been long acquainted with the sound. The  only time when it is beaten with sticks is, when used as dunkahs, before  the King and Queen, on their appearing in public--a sort of alarum to warn  obstructing hackeries, or carriages, to move out of the way.    I have occasionally observed a singular mode of imitating the sound of  cavalry going over hard ground, adopted in the processions of great men on  the tenth of Mahurrum; the contrivance is called chuckee,[19] and composed  of ebony, or some equally hard wood, the shape and size of a pocket globe,  divided into halves; each person, having the pair, beats them with a  particular tact on the flat surface, so as to produce the desired sound of  horses galloping; and where from fifty to a hundred men, or more, are  engaged in this performance, the resemblance may be easily conceived.    There are many little observances, not of sufficient importance to make  them general to all who keep Mahurrum, that need not here be  detailed;--but one must not be omitted, as it is a feature in the domestic  observances of Mussulmauns. On the Tazias, when about to be conveyed to  Kraabaallah, I discovered small portions of corn, rice, bread, fruits,  flowers, cups of water, &c.;--this is in keeping with the Mussulmaun  funerals, who invariably convey food to the tomb with their dead.[1] For  the same reason, at Mahurrum, camphor and rosewater are always carried  with the Tazia to Kraabaallah, although there is not the same occasion for  the articles, as will be observed when the burial service is explained.    I have seen females of rank, with their own hands, place red and green wax  lights in front of the Tazia in their halls, on the night of Mayndhie. I  was told, in answer to my inquiry, What was meant by the solemn process I  had witnessed?--that these ladies had some petition to make, for which  they sought the Emaum's intercession at the throne of mercy. The red light  was for Hosein, who died in battle; the green for Hasan, who died by  poison,--which these colours symbolize; and that those females place great  dependance on the fulfilment of their desires, who thus present to their  Emaums the wax lights on the night of Mayndhie.    I have remarked that the noblemen and gentlemen generally engaged in the  service of celebrating Mahurrum, walk on the tenth morning with their  heads bare and their feet uncovered from their homes to the burial  ground[2] called Kraabaallah, whatever may be the distance,--perhaps four  or five miles,--exposed to the fiery rays of the sun: some persons, who on  this occasion are very scrupulous in thus humbling their nature, walk back  again in the same manner, after the funeral ceremony has been duly gone  through at Kraabaallah. The magnitude of this undertaking can be only well  understood by those who have experienced the state of an atmosphere in the  shady rooms of a large house, when the thermometer ranges from eighty-four  to eighty-eight, or even ninety degrees; and when, if you venture to the  verandah for a few seconds, the flames of heated wind are not only  insupportable to Europeans, but frequently produce severe attacks of fever.  The luxurious habits of the Eastern great men may be well recollected when  counting over the proofs of zeal exhibited in this undertaking, where  every selfish consideration for the time is banished. The nobility (or  indeed any one who lays the slightest claim to gentility) never walk from  one house to another during their lives, but at this particular season;  even in their gardens indulging in whatever luxury they may boast, by  being conveyed round in their palkie, or thonjaun[22]--a chair with poles,  supported by bearers. On the tenth day, the good Mussulmauns rigidly fast  until after the third watch; not even a drop of water, or the hookha,  enters their mouths;--as they believe Hosein's sufferings only concluded  just before the third watch, they cautiously abstain from indulgences,  until that hour has passed.    The procession having reached Kraabaallah, the whole ceremony of a funeral  is gone through. The Tazia is committed to the grave with equal solemnity  to that which is observed when their dead are deposited in the tomb: this  occupies some time. I never witnessed the movements at Kraabaallah,--the  season of the year, the confusion, and the anticipated feuds between  Sheahs and Soonies, ever deterred me from gratifying my curiosity. It is  always expected that the bad feelings between the two sects, amongst the  lower orders of the people, may produce a real battle on the imitative  ground of Kraabaallah; and I have heard of many such terminations of the  Mahurrum at"]]]
