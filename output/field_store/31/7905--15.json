The  session was not so stormy as some of the later ones; but occasions arose  which revealed to the King and to the House of Commons the deeply  discordant assumptions and purposes by which each party was influenced,  and which brought out Bacon's powers of adjusting difficulties and  harmonising claims. He never wavered in his loyalty to his own House,  where it is clear that his authority was great. But there was no limit  to the submission and reverence which he expressed to the King, and,  indeed, to his desire to bring about what the King desired, as far as it  could be safely done. Dealing with the Commons, his policy was \"to be  content with the substance and not to stand on the form.\" Dealing with  the King, he was forward to recognise all that James wanted recognised  of his kingcraft and his absolute sovereignty. Bacon assailed with a  force and keenness which showed what he could do as an opponent, the  amazing and intolerable grievances arising out of the survival of such  feudal customs as Wardship and Purveyance; customs which made over a  man's eldest son and property, during a minority, to the keeping of the  King, that is, to a King's favourite, and allowed the King's servants to  cut down a man's timber before the windows of his house. But he urged  that these grievances should be taken away with the utmost tenderness  for the King's honour and the King's purse. In the great and troublesome  questions relating to the Union he took care to be fully prepared. He  was equally strong on points of certain and substantial importance,  equally quick to suggest accommodations where nothing substantial was  touched. His attitude was one of friendly and respectful independence.  It was not misunderstood by the King. Bacon, who had hitherto been an  unsworn and unpaid member of the Learned Counsel, now received his  office by patent, with a small salary, and he was charged with the grave  business of preparing the work for the Commissioners for the Union of  the Kingdoms, in which, when the Commission met, he took a foremost and  successful part.    But the Parliament before which their report was to be laid did not meet  till ten months after the work of the Commission was done (Dec.,  1604--Nov., 1605). For nearly another year Bacon had no public work. The  leisure was used for his own objects. He was interested in history in a  degree only second to his interest in nature; indeed, but for the  engrossing claims of his philosophy of nature, he might have been the  first and one of the greatest of our historians. He addressed a letter  to the Chancellor Ellesmere on the deficiencies of British history, and  on the opportunities which offered for supplying them. He himself could  at present do nothing; \"but because there be so many good painters, both  for hand and colours, it needeth but encouragement and instructions to  give life and light unto it.\" But he mistook, in this as in other  instances, the way in which such things are done. Men do not accomplish  such things to order, but because their souls compel them, as he himself  was building up his great philosophical structure, in the midst of his  ambition and disappointment. And this interval of quiet enabled him to  bring out his first public appeal on the subject which most filled his  mind. He completed in English the _Two Books of the Advancement of  Knowledge_, which were published at a book-shop at the gateway of Gray's  Inn in Holborn (Oct., 1605). He intended that it should be published in  Latin also; but he was dissatisfied with the ornate translation sent him  from Cambridge, and probably he was in a hurry to get the book out. It  was dedicated to the King, not merely by way of compliment, but with the  serious hope that his interest might be awakened in the subjects which  were nearest Bacon's heart. Like other of Bacon's hopes, it was  disappointed. The King's studies and the King's humours were not of the  kind to make him care for Bacon's visions of the future, or his eager  desire to begin at once a novel method of investigating the facts and  laws of nature; and the appeal to him fell dead. Bacon sent the book  about to his friends with explanatory letters. To Sir T. Bodley he  writes:         \"I think no man may more truly say with the Psalm, _Multum incola       fuit anima mea_ [Ps. 120] than myself. For I do confess since I was       of any understanding, my mind hath in effect been absent from that       I have done; and in absence are many errors which I willingly       acknowledge; and among them, this great one which led the rest:       that knowing myself by inward calling to be fitter to hold a book       than to play a part, I have led my life in civil causes, for which       I was not very fit by nature, and more unfit by the preoccupation       of my mind. Therefore, calling myself home, I have now enjoyed       myself; whereof likewise I desire to make the world partaker.\"    To Lord Salisbury, in a note of elaborate compliment, he describes his  purpose by an image which he repeats more than once. \"I shall content  myself to awake better spirits, _like a bell-ringer, which is first up  to call others to church_.\" But the two friends whose judgment he  chiefly valued, and who, as on other occasions, were taken into his most  intimate literary confidence, were Bishop Andrewes, his \"inquisitor,\"  and Toby Matthews, a son of the Archbishop of York, who had become a  Roman Catholic, and lived in Italy, seeing a good deal of learned men  there, apparently the most trusted of all Bacon's friends.    When Parliament met again in November, 1605, the Gunpowder Plot and its  consequences filled all minds. Bacon was not employed about it by  Government, and his work in the House was confined to carrying on  matters left unfinished from the previous session. On the rumour of  legal promotions and vacancies Bacon once more applied to Salisbury for  the Solicitorship (March, 1606). But no changes were made, and Bacon was  \"still next the door.\" In May, 1606, he did what had for some time been  in his thoughts: he married; not the lady whom Essex had tried to win  for him, that Lady Hatton who became the wife of his rival Coke, but one  whom Salisbury helped him to gain, an alderman's daughter, Alice  Barnham, \"an handsome maiden,\" with some money and a disagreeable  mother, by her second marriage, Lady Packington. Bacon's curious love of  pomp amused the gossips of the day. \"Sir Francis Bacon,\" writes Carleton  to Chamberlain, \"was married yesterday to his young wench, in Maribone  Chapel. He was clad from top to toe in purple, and hath made himself and  his wife such store of raiments of cloth of silver and gold that it  draws deep into her portion.\" Of his married life we hear next to  nothing: in his _Essay on Marriage_ he is not enthusiastic in its  praise; almost the only thing we know is that in his will, twenty years  afterwards, he showed his dissatisfaction with his wife, who after his  death married again. But it gave him an additional reason, and an  additional plea, for pressing for preferment, and in the summer of 1606  the opening came. Coke was made Chief-Justice of the Common Pleas,  leaving the Attorney's place vacant. A favourite of Salisbury's, Hobart,  became Attorney, and Bacon hoped for some arrangement by which the  Solicitor Doddridge might be otherwise provided for, and he himself  become Solicitor. Hopeful as he was, and patient of disappointments, and  of what other men would have thought injustice and faithlessness, he  felt keenly both the disgrace and the inconvenience of so often  expecting place, and being so often passed over. While the question was  pending, he wrote to the King, the Chancellor, and Salisbury. His letter  to the King is a record in his own words of his public services. To the  Chancellor, whom he believed to be his supporter, he represented the  discredit which he suffered--he was a common gaze and a speech;\" \"the  little reputation which by his industry he gathered, being scattered and  taken away by continual disgraces, _every new man coming above me_;\" and  his wife and his wife's friends were making him feel it. The letters  show what Bacon thought to be his claims, and how hard he found it to  get them recognised. To the Chancellor he urged, among other things,  that time was slipping by--         \"I humbly pray your Lordship to consider that time groweth precious       with me, and that a married man is seven years elder in his       thoughts the first day.... And were it not to satisfy my wife's       friends, and to get myself out of being a common gaze and a speech,       I protest before God I would never speak word for it. But to       conclude, as my honourable Lady your wife was some mean to make me       to change the name of another, so if it please you to help me to       change my own name, I can be but more and more bounden to you; and       I am much deceived if your Lordship find not the King well       inclined, and my Lord of Salisbury forward and affectionate.\"    To Salisbury he writes:         \"I may say to your Lordship, in the confidence of your poor       kinsman, and of a man by you advanced, _Tu idem fer opem, qui spem       dedisti_; for I am sure it was not possible for any living man to       have received from another more significant and comfortable words       of hope; your Lordship being pleased to tell me, during the course       of my last service, that you would raise me; and that when you had       resolved to raise a man, you were more careful of him than himself;       and that what you had done for me in my marriage was a benefit to       me, but of no use to your Lordship.... And I know, and all the       world knoweth, that your Lordship is no dealer of holy water,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13893"],[0,"Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: William McKinley; (#15)"],[1,"general attack, powerful forces  were assembled at various points on our coast to invade Cuba and Puerto  Rico. Meanwhile naval demonstrations were made at several exposed  points. On May 11 the cruiser _Wilmington_ and torpedo boat  _Winslow_ were unsuccessful in an attempt to silence the batteries  at Cardenas, a gallant ensign, Worth Bagley, and four seamen falling.  These grievous fatalities were, strangely enough, among the very few  which occurred during our naval operations in this extraordinary  conflict.    Meanwhile the Spanish naval preparations had been pushed with great  vigor. A powerful squadron under Admiral Cervera, which had assembled at  the Cape Verde Islands before the outbreak of hostilities, had crossed  the ocean, and by its erratic movements in the Caribbean Sea delayed our  military plans while baffling the pursuit of our fleets. For a time  fears were felt lest the _Oregon_ and _Marietta_, then nearing  home after their long voyage from San Francisco of over 15,000 miles,  might be surprised by Admiral Cervera's fleet, but their fortunate  arrival dispelled these apprehensions and lent much-needed  reenforcement. Not until Admiral Cervera took refuge in the harbor of  Santiago de Cuba, about May 19, was it practicable to plan a systematic  naval and military attack upon the Antillean possessions of Spain.    Several demonstrations occurred on the coasts of Cuba and Puerto Rico in  preparation for the larger event. On May 13 the North Atlantic Squadron  shelled San Juan de Puerto Rico. On May 30 Commodore Schley's squadron  bombarded the forts guarding the mouth of Santiago Harbor. Neither  attack had any material result. It was evident that well-ordered land  operations were indispensable to achieve a decisive advantage.    The next act in the war thrilled not alone the hearts of our countrymen  but the world by its exceptional heroism. On the night of June 3  Lieutenant Hobson, aided by seven devoted volunteers, blocked the narrow  outlet from Santiago Harbor by sinking the collier _Merrimac_ in  the channel, under a fierce fire from the shore batteries, escaping with  their lives as by a miracle, but falling into the hands of the  Spaniards. It is a most gratifying incident of the war that the bravery  of this little band of heroes was cordially appreciated by the Spanish  admiral, who sent a flag of truce to notify Admiral Sampson of their  safety and to compliment them on their daring act. They were  subsequently exchanged July 7.    By June 7 the cutting of the last Cuban cable isolated the island.  Thereafter the invasion was vigorously prosecuted. On June 10, under a  heavy protecting fire, a landing of 600 marines from the _Oregon_,  _Marblehead_, and _Yankee_ was effected in Guantanamo Bay, where it had  been determined to establish a naval station.    This important and essential port was taken from the enemy, after severe  fighting, by the marines, who were the first organized force of the  United States to land in Cuba.    The position so won was held despite desperate attempts to dislodge  our forces. By June 16 additional forces were landed and strongly  intrenched. On June 22 the advance of the invading army under  Major-General Shafter landed at Daiquiri, about 15 miles east of  Santiago. This was accomplished under great difficulties, but with  marvelous dispatch. On June 23 the movement against Santiago was begun.  On the 24th the first serious engagement took place, in which the First  and Tenth Cavalry and the First United States Volunteer Cavalry, General  Young's brigade of General Wheeler's division, participated, losing  heavily. By nightfall, however, ground within 5 miles of Santiago was  won. The advantage was steadily increased. On July 1 a severe battle  took place, our forces gaining the outworks of Santiago; on the 2d El  Caney and San Juan were taken after a desperate charge, and the  investment of the city was completed. The Navy cooperated by shelling  the town and the coast forts.    On the day following this brilliant achievement of our land forces, the  3d of July, occurred the decisive naval combat of the war. The Spanish  fleet, attempting to leave the harbor, was met by the American squadron  under command of Commodore Sampson. In less than three hours all the  Spanish ships were destroyed, the two torpedo boats being sunk and the  _Maria Teresa_, _Almirante Oquendo_, _Vizcaya_, and _Cristobal Colon_  driven ashore. The Spanish admiral and over 1,300 men were taken  prisoners. While the enemy's loss of life was deplorably large, some 600  perishing, on our side but one man was killed, on the _Brooklyn_, and  one man seriously wounded. Although our ships were repeatedly struck,  not one was seriously injured. Where all so conspicuously distinguished  themselves, from the commanders to the gunners and the unnamed heroes in  the boiler rooms, each and all contributing toward the achievement of  this astounding victory, for which neither ancient nor modern history  affords a parallel in the completeness of the event and the marvelous  disproportion of casualties, it would be invidious to single out any for  especial honor. Deserved promotion has rewarded the more conspicuous  actors. The nation's profoundest gratitude is due to all of these brave  men who by their skill and devotion in a few short hours crushed the sea  power of Spain and wrought a triumph whose decisiveness and far-reaching  consequences can scarcely be measured. Nor can we be unmindful of the  achievements of our builders, mechanics, and artisans for their skill in  the construction of our war ships.    With the catastrophe of Santiago Spain's effort upon the ocean virtually  ceased. A spasmodic effort toward the end of June to send her  Mediterranean fleet, under Admiral Camara, to relieve Manila was  abandoned, the expedition being recalled after it had passed through the  Suez Canal.    The capitulation of Santiago followed. The city was closely besieged by  land, while the entrance of our ships into the harbor cut off all relief  on that side. After a truce to allow of the removal of noncombatants  protracted negotiations continued from July 3 until July 15, when, under  menace of immediate assault, the preliminaries of surrender were agreed  upon. On the 17th General Shafter occupied the city. The capitulation  embraced the entire eastern end of Cuba. The number of Spanish soldiers  surrendering was 22,000, all of whom were subsequently conveyed to Spain  at the charge of the United States. The story of this successful  campaign is told in the report of the Secretary of War, which will be  laid before you. The individual valor of officers and soldiers was never  more strikingly shown than in the several engagements leading to the  surrender of Santiago, while the prompt movements and successive  victories won instant and universal applause. To those who gained this  complete triumph, which established the ascendency of the United States  upon land as the fight off Santiago had fixed our supremacy on the seas,  the earnest and lasting gratitude of the nation is unsparingly due. Nor  should we alone remember the gallantry of the living; the dead claim our  tears, and our losses by battle and disease must cloud any exultation at  the result and teach us to weigh the awful cost of war, however rightful  the cause or signal the victory.    With the fall of Santiago the occupation of Puerto Rico became the next  strategic necessity. General Miles had previously been assigned to  organize an expedition for that purpose. Fortunately he was already at  Santiago, where he had arrived on the 11th of July with reenforcements  for General Shafter's army.    With these troops, consisting of 3,415 infantry and artillery, two  companies of engineers, and one company of the Signal Corps, General  Miles left Guantanamo on July 21, having nine transports convoyed by the  fleet under Captain Higginson with the _Massachusetts_ (flagship), _Dixie_,  _Gloucester_, _Columbia_, and _Yale_, the two latter carrying troops.  The expedition landed at Guanica July 25, which port was entered with  little opposition. Here the fleet was joined by the _Annapolis_ and  the _Wasp_, while the _Puritan_ and _Amphitrite_ went to San Juan and  joined the _New Orleans_, which was engaged in blockading that port. The  Major-General Commanding was subsequently reenforced by General Schwan's  brigade of the Third Army Corps, by General Wilson with a part of his  division, and also by General Brooke with a part of his corps, numbering  in all 16,973 officers and men.    On July 27 he entered Ponce, one of the most important ports in the  island, from which he thereafter directed operations for the capture of  the island.    With the exception of encounters with the enemy at Guayama,  Hormigueros, Coarno, and Yauco and an attack on a force landed at Cape  San Juan, there was no serious resistance. The campaign was prosecuted  with great vigor, and by the 12th of August much of the island was in  our possession and the acquisition of the remainder was only a matter  of a short time. At most of the points in the island our troops were  enthusiastically welcomed. Protestations of loyalty to the flag and  gratitude for delivery from Spanish rule met our commanders at every  stage. As a potent influence toward peace the outcome of the Puerto  Rican expedition was of great consequence, and generous commendation  is due to those who participated in it.    The last scene of the war was enacted at Manila, its starting place. On  August 15, after a brief assault upon the works by the land forces, in  which the squadron assisted, the capital surrendered unconditionally.  The casualties were comparatively few. By this the conquest of the  Philippine Islands, virtually accomplished when the Spanish capacity for  resistance was destroyed by Admiral Dewey's victory of the 1st of May,  was formally sealed.
