In brief, this parchment was a portion of the title-deeds he had lost;  and though it did not prove sufficient to enable him to recover his  fortune, it brought his opponent to a composition, which gave him an  annuity for life. Small as this was, he determined that these poor  people, who had so generously saved his life at the risk of their  own, should be sharers in it. Finding that what they most desired was  to have a cottage in the neighborhood of the Dust-heap, built large  enough for all three to live together, and keep a cow, Mr. Waterhouse  paid a visit to Manchester Square, where the owner of the property  resided. He told his story, as far as was needful, and proposed to  purchase the field in question.    The great Dust-Contractor was much amused, and his daughter--a very  accomplished young lady--was extremely interested. So the matter was  speedily arranged to the satisfaction and pleasure of all parties. The  acquaintance, however, did not end here. Mr. Waterhouse renewed his  visits very frequently, and finally made proposals for the young  lady's hand, she having already expressed her hopes of a propitious  answer from her father.    \"Well, Sir,\" said the latter, \"you wish to marry my daughter, and she  wishes to marry you. You are a gentleman and a scholar, but you have  no money. My daughter is what you see, and she has no money. But I  have; and therefore, as she likes you and I like you, I'll make you  both an offer. I will give my daughter twenty thousand pounds,--or you  shall have the Dust-heap. Choose!\"    Mr. Waterhouse was puzzled and amused, and referred the matter  entirely to the young lady. But she was for having the money, and no  trouble. She said the Dust-heap might be worth much, but they did not  understand the business.    \"Very well,\" said her father, laughing, \"then, there's the money.\"    This was the identical Dust-heap, as we know from authentic  information, which was subsequently sold for forty thousand pounds,  and was exported to Russia to rebuild Moscow.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM HOUSEHOLD WORDS.]    AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY.    In one of the dirtiest and most gloomy streets leading to the Rue  St. Denis, in Paris, there stands a tall and ancient house, the lower  portion of which is a large mercer's shop. This establishment is held  to be one of the very best in the neighborhood, and has for many years  belonged to an individual on whom we will bestow the name of Ramin.    About ten years ago, Monsieur Ramin was a jovial red-faced man of  forty, who joked his customers into purchasing his goods, flattered  the pretty _grisettes_ outrageously, and now and then gave them a  Sunday treat at the barrier, as the cheapest way of securing their  custom. Some people thought him a careless, good-natured fellow, and  wondered how, with his off-hand ways, he contrived to make money so  fast, but those who knew him well saw that he was one of those who  \"never lost an opportunity.\" Others declared that Monsieur Ramin's  own definition of his character was, that he was a \"_bon enfant_,\"  and that \"it was all luck.\" He shrugged his shoulders and laughed when  people hinted at his deep scheming in making, and his skill in taking  advantage of Excellent Opportunities.    He was sitting in his gloomy parlor one fine morning in spring,  breakfasting from a dark liquid honored with the name of onion soup,  glancing at the newspaper, and keeping a vigilant look on the shop  through the open door, when his old servant Catharine suddenly  observed:    \"I suppose you know Monsieur Bonelle has come to live in the vacant  apartment on the fourth floor?\"    \"What!\" exclaimed Monsieur Ramin, in a loud key.    Catharine repeated her statement, to which her master listened in  total silence.    \"Well!\" he said at length, in his most careless tones, \"what about  the old fellow?\" and he once more resumed his triple occupation of  reading, eating, and watching.    \"Why,\" continued Catharine, \"they say he is nearly dying, and that his  housekeeper, Marguerite, vowed he could never get up stairs alive. It  took two men to carry him up; and when he was at length quiet in bed,  Marguerite went down to the porter's lodge, and sobbed there a whole  hour, saying her poor master had the gout, the rheumatics, and a bad  asthma; that though he had been got up stairs, he would never come  down again alive; that if she could only get him to confess his sins  and make his will, she would not mind it so much; but that when  she spoke of the lawyer or the priest, he blasphemed at her like a  heathen, and declared that he would live to bury her and everybody  else.\"    Monsieur Ramin heard Catharine with great attention, forgot to finish  his soup, and remained for five minutes in profound rumination,  without so much as perceiving two customers who had entered the shop  and were waiting to be served. When aroused, he was heard to exclaim:    \"What an excellent opportunity!\"    Monsieur Bonelle had been Ramin's predecessor. The succession of the  latter to the shop was a mystery. No one ever knew how it was that  this young and poor assistant managed to replace his patron. Some said  that he had detected Monsieur Bonelle in frauds which he threatened  to expose unless the business were given up to him as the price of his  silence; others averred, that having drawn a prize in the lottery,  he had resolved to set up a fierce opposition over the way, and  that Monsieur Bonelle, having obtained a hint of his intentions, had  thought it most prudent to accept the trifling sum his clerk offered,  and avoid a ruinous competition. Some charitable souls--moved no doubt  by Monsieur Bonelle's misfortune--endeavored to console and pump him;  but all they could get from him was the bitter exclamation, \"To think  I should have been duped by _him_!\" For Ramin had the art, though  then a mere youth, to pass himself off on his master as an innocent  provincial lad. Those who sought an explanation from the new mercer  were still more unsuccessful. \"My good old master,\" he said in his  jovial way, \"felt in need of repose, and so I obligingly relieved him  of all business and botheration.\"    Years passed away; Ramin prospered, and neither thought nor heard  of his \"good old master.\" The house, of which he tenanted the lower  portion, was offered for sale. He had long coveted it, and had almost  concluded an agreement with the actual owner, when Monsieur Bonelle  unexpectedly stepped in at the eleventh hour, and by offering a trifle  more secured the bargain. The rage and mortification of Monsieur Ramin  were extreme. He could not understand how Bonelle, whom he had thought  ruined, had scraped up so large a sum; his lease was out, and he  now felt himself at the mercy of the man he had so much injured. But  either Monsieur Bonelle was free from vindictive feelings, or those  feelings did not blind him to the expediency of keeping a good tenant:  for though he raised the rent until Monsieur Ramin groaned inwardly,  he did not refuse to renew the lease. They had met at that period, but  never since.    \"Well, Catharine,\" observed Monsieur Ramin to his old servant on the  following morning, \"How is that good Monsieur Bonelle getting on?\"    \"I dare say you feel very uneasy about him,\" she replied with a sneer.    Monsieur Ramin looked up and frowned.    \"Catharine,\" said he, dryly, \"you will have the goodness, in the first  place, not to make impertinent remarks: in the second place, you will  oblige me by going up stairs to inquire after the health of Monsieur  Bonelle, and say that I sent you.\"    Catharine grumbled, and obeyed. Her master was in the shop, when she  returned in a few minutes, and delivered with evident satisfaction the  following gracious message:    \"Monsieur Bonelle desires his compliments to you, and declines to  state how he is; he will also thank you to attend to your own shop,  and not to trouble yourself about his health.\"    \"How does he look?\" asked Monsieur Ramin, with perfect composure.    \"I caught a glimpse of him, and he appears to me to be rapidly  preparing for the good offices of the undertaker.\"    Monsieur Ramin smiled, rubbed his hands, and joked merrily with a  dark-eyed _grisette_, who was cheapening some ribbon for her cap. That  girl made an excellent bargain that day.    Toward dusk the mercer left the shop to the care of his attendant, and  softly stole up to the fourth story. In answer to his gentle ring, a  little old woman opened the door, and giving him a rapid look, said  briefly:    \"Monsieur is inexorable: he won't see any doctor whatever.\"    She was going to shut the door in his face, when Ramin quickly  interposed, under his breath, with \"I am not a doctor.\"    She looked at him from head to foot.    \"Are you a lawyer?\"    \"Nothing of the sort, my good lady.\"    \"Well then, are you a priest?\"    \"I may almost say, quite the reverse.\"    \"Indeed, you must go away, Master sees no one.\"    Once more she would have shut the door, but Ramin prevented her.    \"My good lady,\" said he in his most insinuating tones, \"it is true  I am neither a lawyer, a doctor, nor a priest. I am an old friend,  a very old friend of your excellent master; I have come to see good  Monsieur Bonelle in his present affliction.\"    Marguerite did not answer, but allowed him to enter, and closed the  door behind him. He was going to pass from the narrow and gloomy  ante-chamber into an inner room--whence now proceeded a sound of loud  coughing--when the old woman laid her hand on his arm, and raising  herself on tip-toe, to reach his ear, whispered:    \"For Heaven's sake, sir, since you are his friend, do talk to him:  do tell him to make his will, and hint something about a soul to be  saved, and all that sort of thing: do, sir!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13797"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#15)"],[1,"\"    \"How--what is it you wish?\" cried Emily; terrified.    \"It was _his_ wish,\" replied Edward. \"He evinced an earnest desire  to have this pledge of an unfortunate and unfulfilled engagement  restored.\"    \"How is that possible? You did not speak with him before his  death; and this happened so suddenly after, that, to give you the  commission--\"    \"There was no time for it! that is true,\" answered Edward, with an  inward shudder, although outwardly he was calm. \"Perhaps this wish  was awakened immediately before his death. I found it, as I told you,  expressed in those papers.\"    \"Incomprehensible!\" she exclaimed. \"Only a short time before his  death, we cherished--deceitful, indeed, they proved, but, oh, what  blessed hopes! we reckoned on casualties, on what might possibly  occur to assist as. Neither of us could endure to dwell on the idea  of separation; and yet--yet since--Oh, my God,\" she cried, overcome by  sorrow, and she hid her face between her hands.    Edward was lost in confused thought. For a time both again were  silent: at length Emily started up--    \"Forgive me, M. de Wensleben. What you have related to me, what you  have asked of me, has produced so much excitement, so much agitation,  that it is necessary that I should be alone for a few moments, to  recover my composure.\"    \"I am gone,\" cried Edward, springing from his chair.    \"No! no!\" she replied, \"you are my guest; remain here. I have a  household duty which calls me away.\" She laid a stress on these words.    She leant forward, and with a sad, sweet smile, she gave her hand to  the friend of her lost Ferdinand, pressing his gently, and disappeared  through the inner door.    Edward stood stunned, bewildered; then he paced the room with hasty  steps, threw himself on the sofa, and took up one of the books that  lay on the table, rather to have something in his hand, than to read.  It proved to be Young's \"Night Thoughts.\" He looked through it, and  was attracted by many passages, which seemed, in his present frame  of mind, fraught with peculiar meaning; yet his thoughts wandered  constantly from the page to his dead friend. The candles, unheeded  both by Emily and him, burned on with long wicks, giving little light  in the silent room, over which the red glare from the hearth shed a  lurid glow. Hurried footsteps sounded in the anteroom; the door was  thrown open.    Edward looked up, and saw D'Effernay staring at him, and round the  room, in an angry, restless manner.    Edward could not but think there was something almost unearthly in  those dark looks and that towering form.    \"Where is my wife?\" was D'Effernay's first question.    \"She is gone to fulfill some household duty,\" replied the other.    \"And leaves you here alone in this miserable darkness! Most  extraordinary!--indeed, most unaccountable!\" and as he spoke he  approached the table and snuffed the candles, with a movement of  impatience.    \"She left me here with old friends,\" said Edward, with a forced smile.  \"I have been reading.\"    \"What, in the dark?\" inquired D'Effernay, with a look of mistrust.  \"It was so dark when I came in, that you could not possibly have  distinguished a letter.\"    \"I read for some time, and then I fell into a train of thought, which  is usually the result of reading Young's 'Night Thoughts.'\"    \"Young! I cannot bear that author. He is so gloomy.\"    \"But you are fortunately so happy, that the lamentations of the lonely  mourner can find no echo in your breast.\"    \"You think so!\" said D'Effernay, in a churlish tone, and he pressed  his lips together tightly, as Emily came into the room: he went to  meet her.    \"You have been a long time away,\" was his observation, as he looked  into her eyes, where the trace of tears might easily be detected. \"I  found our guest alone.\"    \"M. de Wensleben was good enough to excuse me,\" she replied; \"and then  I thought you would be back immediately.\"    They sat down to the table; coffee was brought, and the past appeared  to be forgotten.    The conversation at first was broken by constant pauses. Edward saw  that Emily did all she could to play the hostess agreeably, and to  pacify her husband's ill-humor.    In this attempt the young man assisted her, and at last they were  successful. D'Effernay became more cheerful; the conversation more  animated; and Edward found that his host could be a very agreeable  member of society when he pleased, combining a good deal of  information with great natural powers. The evening passed away more  pleasantly than it promised at one time; and after an excellent and  well-served supper, the young officer was shown into a comfortable  room, fitted up with every modern luxury; and weary in mind and body,  he soon fell asleep. He dreamed of all that had occupied his waking  thoughts-of his friend, and his friend's history.    But in that species of confusion which often characterizes dreams,  he fancied that he was Ferdinand, or at least, his own individuality  seemed mixed up with that of Hallberg. He felt that he was ill. He lay  in an unknown room, and by his bedside stood a small table, covered  with glasses and phials, containing medicines, as is usual in a sick  room.    The door opened, and D'Effernay came in, in his dressing-gown, as  if he had just left his bed: and now in Edward's mind dreams and  realities were mingled together, and he thought that D'Effernay came,  perhaps, to speak with him on the occurrences of the preceding day.  But no! he approached the table on which the medicines stood, looked  at the watch, took up one of the phials and a cup, measured the  draught, drop by drop, then he turned and looked round him stealthily,  and then he drew from his breast a pale blue, coiling serpent, which  he threw into the cup, and held it to the patient's lips, who drank,  and instantly felt a numbness creep over his frame which ended in  death. Edward fancied that he was dead; he saw the coffin brought, but  the terror lest he should be buried alive, made him start up with a  sudden effort, and he opened his eyes.    The dream had passed away; he sat in his bed safe and well; but it was  long ere he could in any degree recover his composure, or get rid of  the impression which the frightful apparition had made on him. They  brought his breakfast, with a message from the master of the house  to inquire whether he would like to visit the park, farms, &c. He  dressed quickly, and descended to the court, where he found his host  in a riding dress, by the side of two fine horses, already saddled.  D'Effernay greeted the young man courteously; but Edward felt  an inward repugnance as he looked on that gloomy though handsome  countenance, now lighted up by the beams of the morning sun, yet  recalling vividly the dark visions of the night. D'Effernay was full  of attentions to his new friend. They started on their ride, in spite  of some threatening clouds, and began the inspection of meadows,  shrubberies, farms, &c. After a couple of hours, which were consumed  in this manner, it began to rain a few drops, and at last burst out  into a heavy shower. It was soon impossible even to ride through the  woods for the torrents that were pouring down, and so they returned to  the castle.    Edward retired to his room to change his dress, and to write some  letters, he said, but more particularly to avoid Emily, in order not  to excite her husband's jealousy. As the bell rang for dinner he  saw her again, and found to his surprise that the captain, whom he  had first seen in the coffee-room, and who had given him so much  information, was one of the party. He was much pleased, for they had  taken a mutual fancy to each other. The captain was not at quarters  the day Edward had left them, but as soon as he heard where his friend  had gone, he put horses to his carriage and followed him, for he said  he also should like to see these famous estates. D'Effernay seemed  in high good humor to-day, Emily far more silent than yesterday,  and taking little part in the conversation of the men, which turned  on political economy. After coffee she found an opportunity to give  Edward (unobserved) a little packet. The look with which she did so,  told plainly what it contained, and the young man hurried to his room  as soon as he fancied he could do so without remark or comment. The  continued rain precluded all idea of leaving the house any more that  day. He unfolded the packet; there were a couple of sheets, written  closely in a woman's fair hand, and something wrapped carefully in a  paper, which he knew to be the ring. It was the fellow to that which  he had given the day before to Emily, only Ferdinand's name was  engraved inside instead of hers. Such were the contents of the  papers:--    \"Secrecy would be misplaced with the friend of the dead. Therefore,  will I speak to you of things which I have never uttered to a human  being until now. Jules D'Effernay is nearly related to me. We knew  each other in the Netherlands, where our estates joined. The boy loved  me already with a love that amounted to passion; this love was my  father's greatest joy, for there was an old and crying injustice which  the ancestors of D'Effernay had suffered from ours, that could alone,  he thought, be made up by the marriage of the only children of the two  branches. So we were destined for each other almost from our cradles;  and I was content it should be so, for Jules's handsome face and  decided preference for me were agreeable to me, although I felt no  great affection for him. We were separated: Jules traveled in France,  England, and America, and made money as a merchant, which profession  he had taken up suddenly. My father, who had a place under government,  left his country in consequence of political troubles, and came into  this part of the world where some distant relations of my mother's  lived. He liked the neighborhood; he bought land; we lived very  happily; I was"]]]
