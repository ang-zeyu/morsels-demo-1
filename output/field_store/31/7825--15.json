It will dry  in your stove, or in an oven after pyes are drawn.    _To candy Orange-Flowers_:--Take half a pound of double-refin'd  sugar finely beaten, wet it with orange-flower-water, then boil  it candy-high, then put in a handful of orange-flowers, keeping it  stirring, but let it not boil, and when the sugar candies about them,  take it off the fire, drop it on a plate, and set it by till 'tis  cold.    _To make Conserve of Red-Roses, or any other Flowers_:--Take  rose-buds, and pick them, and cut off the white part from the red,  and put the red flowers, and sift them through a sieve to take out the  seeds; then weigh them, and to every pound of flowers take two pounds  and a half of loaf-sugar, beat the flowers pretty fine in a stone  mortar; then by degrees put the sugar to them, and beat it very well  till 'tis well incorporated together; then put it into gallipots, and  tye it over with paper, and over that leather, and it will keep seven  years.    _To preserve white Pear Plumbs_:--Take pear plumbs when they are  yellow, before they are too ripe; give them a slit in the seam, and  prick them behind; make your water almost scalding hot, and put a  little sugar to it to sweeten it, and put in your plumbs and cover  them close; set them on the fire to coddle, and take them off  sometimes a little, and set them on again: take care they do not  break; have in readiness as much double-refin'd sugar boiled to a  height as will cover them, and when they are coddled pretty tender,  take them out of that liquor, and put them into your preserving-pan to  your syrup, which must be but blood-warm when your plumbs go in. Let  them boil till they are clear, scum them and take them off, and let  them stand two hours; then set them on again and boil them, and when  they are thoroughly preserved, take them up and lay them in glasses;  boil your syrup till 'tis thick; and when 'tis cold, put in your  plumbs; and a month after, if your syrup grows thin, you must boil it  again, or make a fine jelly of pippins, and put on them. This way  you may do the pimordian plumb, or any white plumb, and when they are  cold, paper them up.    _To preserve Mulberries whole_:--Set some mulberries over the fire  in a skillet, and draw from them a pint of juice, when 'tis strained.  Then take three pounds of sugar, beaten very fine; wet the sugar with  the pint of juice; boil up your sugar, and scum it, and put in two  pounds of ripe mulberries, and let them stand in the syrup till they  are thoroughly warm; then set them on the fire, and let them boil very  gently; do them but half enough, so put them by in the syrup till next  day; then boil them gently again, and when the syrup is pretty thick,  and will stand in a round drop when 'tis cold, they are enough; so put  all together in a gallipot for use.    _To preserve whole Quinces white_:--Take the largest quinces of the  greenest colour, and scald them till they are pretty soft; then pare  them and core them with a scoop; then weigh your quinces against so  much double-refin'd sugar, and make a syrup of one half, and put in  your quinces, and boil them as fast as you can; then you must have  in readiness pippin liquor; let it be very strong of the pippins, and  when 'tis strained out, put in the other half of your sugar, and make  it a jelly, and when your quinces are clear, put them into the jelly,  and let them simmer a little; they will be very white; so glass them  up, and when they are cold, paper them and keep them in a stove.    _To make white Quince Marmalade_:--Scald your quinces tender, take off  the skin and pulp them from the core very fine, and to every pound  of quince have a pound and half of double-refin'd sugar in lumps, and  half a pint of water; dip your sugar in the water and boil and scum it  till 'tis a thick syrup: then put in your quince, boil and scum it on  a quick fire a quarter of an hour, so put it in your pots.    _To make red Quince Marmalade_:--Pare and core a pound of quince, beat  the parings and cores and some of your worst quinces, and strain out  the juice; and to every pound of quince take ten or twelve spoonfuls  of that juice, and three-quarters of a pound of loaf-sugar; put all  into your preserving-pan, cover it close, and let it stew over a  gentle fire two hours; when 'tis of an orange-red, uncover and boil it  up as fast as you can: when of a good colour, break it as you like it,  give it a boil, and pot it up.    _To make Melon Mangoes_:--Take small melons, not quite ripe, cut  a slip down the side, and take out the inside very clean; beat  mustard-seeds, and shred garlick, and mix with the seeds, and put in  your mangoes; put the pieces you cut out into their places again, and  tye them up, and put them into your pot, and boil some vinegar (as  much as you think will cover them) with whole pepper, and some salt,  and Jamaica pepper, and pour in scalding hot over your mangoes, and  cover them close to keep in the steam; and so do every day for nine  times together, and when they are cold cover them with leather.    _To make Conserve of Hips_:--Gather the hips before they grow soft,  cut off the heads and stalks, slit them in halves, and take out all  the seed and white that is in them very clean; then put them in an  earthen pan, and stir them every day, else they will grow mouldy;  let them stand till they are soft enough to rub through a coarse  hair-sieve; as the pulp comes, take it off the sieve; they are a dry  berry, and will require pains to rub it through; then add its weight  in sugar, and mix it well together without boiling; keeping it in deep  gallipots for use.    _To make clear Cakes of Gooseberries_:--Take your white Dutch  gooseberries when they are thorough ripe, break them with your fingers  and squeeze out all the pulp into a fine piece of cambrick or thick  muslin to run thro' clear; then weigh the juice and sugar one against  the other; then boil the juice a little while, then put in your sugar  and let it dissolve, but not boil; scum it and put it into glasses,  and stove it in a warm stove.    _To make white Quince Paste_:--Scald the quinces tender to the core,  and pare them, and scrape the pulp clean from the core, beat it in  a mortar, and pulp it through a colander; take to a pound of pulp a  pound and two ounces of sugar, boil the sugar till 'tis candy-high;  then put in your pulp, stir it about constantly till you see it come  clear from the bottom of the preserving-pan; then take it off, and lay  it on plates pretty thin: you may cut it in what shape you please, or  make quince chips of it; you must dust it with sugar when you put it  into the stove, and turn it on papers in a sieve, and dust the other  side; when they are dry, put them in boxes with papers between. You  may make red quince paste the same way as this, only colour the quince  with cochineel.    _To make Syrup of any flower_:--Clip your flowers, and take their  weight in sugar; then take a high gallipot, and a row of flowers, and  a strewing of sugar, till the pot is full; then put in two or three  spoonfuls of the same syrup or still'd water; tye a cloth on the top  of the pot, and put a tile on that, and set your gallipot in a kettle  of water over a gentle fire, and let it infuse till the strength is  out of the flowers, which will be in four or five hours; then strain  it thro' a flannel, and when 'tis cold bottle it up.      VIII.--PICKLES.    _To pickle Nasturtium-Buds_:--Gather your little knobs quickly after  your blossoms are off; put them in cold water and salt for three days,  shifting them once a day; then make a pickle (but do not boil it  at all) of some white-wine, some white-wine vinegar, eschalot,  horse-radish, pepper, salt, cloves, and mace whole, and nutmeg  quartered; then put in your seeds and stop them close; they are to be  eaten as capers.    _To keep Quinces in Pickle_:--Cut five or six quinces all to pieces,  and put them in an earthen pot or pan, with a gallon of water and two  pounds of honey; mix all these together well, and then put them in  a kettle to boil leisurely half an hour, and then strain your liquor  into that earthen pot, and when 'tis cold, wipe your quinces clean,  and put them into it: they must be covered very close, and they will  keep all the year.    _To pickle Ashen-keys_:--Take ashen-keys as young as you can get them,  and put them in a pot with salt and water; then take green whey, when  'tis hot, and pour over them; let them stand till they are cold before  you cover them, so let them stand; when you use them, boil them in  fair water; when they are tender take them out, and put them in salt  and water.    _To pickle Pods of Radishes_:--Gather the youngest pods, and put them  in water and salt twenty-four hours; then make a pickle for them of  vinegar, cloves, mace, whole pepper: boil this, and drain the pods  from the salt and water, and pour the liquor on them boiling hot: put  to them a clove of garlick a little"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12296"],[0,"Camps and Trails in China (#15)"],[1,"ets,  overhung with trees which often form a cool green canopy overhead,  beautiful lawns and well-kept houses, and in the center of the town is a  lovely lake surrounded by a wide border of palms. At the far end, like a  jewel in a crystal setting, seems to float a white pagoda, an outpost of  the temple which stands in the midst of a watery meadow of lotos plants.  The city shops are excellent, but in most instances the prices are  exceedingly high.    Like all the French towns in the Orient the hours for work are rather  confusing to the foreigner. The shops open at 6:30 in the morning and close  at 11 o'clock to reopen again at 3 in the afternoon and continue business  until 7:30 or 8 o'clock in the evening. During the middle of the day all  houses have the shutters closely drawn, and because of the intense heat and  glare of the sun the streets are absolutely deserted, not even a native  being visible. In the morning a _petit déjeuner_, remarkable especially for  its \"petitness,\" is served, and a real _déjeuner_ comes later anywhere from  10 to 12:30.    About 6 o'clock in the evening the open _cafés_ and restaurants along the  sidewalk are lined with groups of men and women playing cards and dice and  drinking gin and bitters, vermouth or absinthe. There is an air of  happiness and life about Hanoi which is typically Parisian and even during  war time it is a city of gayety. An immense theater stands in the center of  the town, but has not been opened since the beginning of the war.    We had letters to M. Chemein Dupontés, the director of the railroads, as  well as to the Lieutenant-Governor and other officials. Without exception  we were received in the most cordial manner and every facility and  convenience put at our disposal. M. Dupontés was especially helpful.    Some time before our arrival a tunnel on the railroad from Hanoi to Yün-nan  Fu had caved in and for almost a month trains had not been running. It was  now in operation, however, but all luggage had to be transferred by hand at  the broken tunnel and consequently must not exceed eighty-five pounds in  weight. This meant repacking our entire equipment and three days of hard  work. M. Dupontés arranged to have our 4000 pounds of baggage put in a  special third class carriage with our \"boys\" in attendance and in this way  saved the expedition a considerable amount of money. He personally went  with us to the station to arrange for our comfort with the _chef de gare_,  telegraphed ahead at every station upon the railroad, and gave us an open  letter to all officials; in fact there was nothing which he left undone.    The railroad is a remarkable engineering achievement for it was constructed  in great haste through a difficult mountainous range. Yün-nan is an  exceedingly rich province and the French were quick to see the advantages  of drawing its vast trade to their own seaports. The British were already  making surveys to construct a railroad from Bhamo on the headwaters of the  Irawadi River across Yün-nan to connect with the Yangtze, and the French  were anxious to have their road in operation some time before the rival  line could be completed.    Owing to its hasty construction and the heavy rainfall, or perhaps to both,  the tunnels and bridges frequently cave in or are washed away and the  railroad is chiefly remarkable for the number of days in the year in which  it does not operate; nevertheless the French deserve great credit for their  enterprise in extending their line to Yün-nan Fu over the mountains where  there is a tunnel or bridge almost every mile of the way. While it was  being built through the fever-stricken jungles of Tonking the coolies died  like flies, and it was necessary to suspend all work during the summer  months.    The scenery along the railroad is marvelous and the traveling is by no  means uncomfortable, but the hotels in which one stops at night are  wretched. One of our friends in Hongkong related an amusing experience  which he had at Lao-kay, the first hotel on the railroad. He asked for a  bath and discovered that a tub of hot water had been prepared. He wished a  cold bath, and seeing a large tank filled with cold water in the corner of  the room he climbed in and was enjoying himself when the hotel proprietor  suddenly rushed upstairs exclaiming, \"Mon Dieu, Mon Dieu, you are in the  tank of drinking water.\"    When we arrived at Yün-nan Fu we found a surprisingly cosmopolitan  community housed within its grim old walls; some were consuls, some  missionaries, some salt, telegraph, or customs officials in the Chinese  employ, and others represented business firms in Hongkong, but all received  us with open handed hospitality characteristic of the East.    We thought that after leaving Hongkong our evening clothes would not again  be used, but they were requisitioned every night for we were guests at  dinners given by almost everyone of the foreign community. Mr. Howard Page,  a representative of the Standard Oil Company, proved a most valuable  friend, and through him we were able to obtain a caravan and make other  arrangements for the transportation of our baggage. M. Henry Wilden, the  French Consul, an ardent sportsman and a charming gentleman, took an active  interest in our affairs and arranged a meeting for us with the Chinese  Commissioner of Foreign Affairs. Moreover, he later transported our trunks  to Hongkong with his personal baggage and assisted us in every possible  way.    We went to the Foreign Office at half past ten and were ushered into a  large room where a rather imposing lunch had already been spread. The  Commissioner, a fat, jolly little man, who knew a few words of French but  none of English, received us in the most cordial way and immediately opened  several bottles of champagne in our honor. He asked why our passports had  not been viséd in Peking, and we pleased him greatly by replying that at  the time we were in the capital Yün-nan was an independent province and  consequently the Peking Government had not the temerity to put their stamp  upon our passports.    Inasmuch as Yün-nan was infested with brigands we had expected some  opposition to our plans for traveling in the interior, but none was  forthcoming, and with the exception of an offer of a guard of soldiers for  our trip to Ta-li Fu which we knew it would be impolitic to refuse, we left  the Foreign Office with all the desired permits.    The Chinese Government appeared to be greatly interested in our zoölogical  study of Yün-nan, offered to assist us in every way we could suggest, and  telegraphed to every mandarin in the north and west of the province,  instructing them to receive us with all honor and to facilitate our work in  every way. None of the opposition which we had been led to expect  developed, and it is difficult to see how we could have been more cordially  received.          CHAPTER X      ON THE ROAD TO TA-LI FU    On August 6, we dispatched half our equipment to Ta-li Fu, and three days  later we ourselves left Yün-nan Fu at eleven o'clock in the morning after  an interminable wait for our caravan. Through the kindness of Mr. Page, a  house boat was put at our disposal and we sailed across the upper end of  the beautiful lake which lies just outside the city, and intercepted the  caravan twenty-five _li_ [Footnote: A _li_ in this province equals  one-third of an English mile.] from Yün-nan Fu.    On the way we passed a number of cormorant fishers, each with ten or a  dozen birds sitting quietly upon the boat with outspread wings drying their  feathers. Every bird has a ring about its neck, and is thus prevented from  swallowing the fish which it catches by diving into the water.    After waiting an hour for our caravan we saw the long train of mules and  horses winding up the hill toward us. There were seventeen altogether, and  in the midst of them rode the cook clinging desperately with both hands to  a diminutive mule, his long legs dangling and a look of utter wretchedness  upon his face. Just before the caravan reached us it began to rain, and the  cook laboriously pulled on a suit of yellow oilskins which we had purchased  for him in Yün-nan Fu. These, together with a huge yellow hat, completed a  picture which made us roar with laughter; Heller gave the caption for it  when he shouted, \"Here comes the 'Yellow Peril.'\"    We surveyed the tiny horses with dismay. As Heller vainly tried to get his  girth tight enough to keep the saddle from sliding over the animal's tail  he exclaimed, \"Is this a horse or a squirrel I'm trying to ride?\" But it  was not so bad when we finally climbed aboard and found that we did not  crush the little brutes.    A seventy-pound box on each side of the saddle with a few odds and ends on  top made a pack of at least one hundred and sixty pounds. This is heavy  even for a large animal and for these tiny mules seemed an impossibility,  but it is the usual weight, and the businesslike way in which they moved  off showed that they were not overloaded.    The Yün-nan pack saddle is a remarkably ingenious arrangement. The load is  strapped with a rawhide to a double A-shaped frame which fits loosely over  a second saddle on the animal's back and is held in place by its own  weight. If a mule falls the pack comes off and, moreover, it can be easily  removed if the road is bad or whenever a stop is made. It has the great  disadvantage, however, of giving the horses serious back sores which  receive but scanty attention from the _mafus_ (muleteers).    When we were fairly started upon our long ride to Ta-li Fu the time slipped  by in a succession of delightful days. Since this was the main caravan  route the _mafus_ had regular stages beyond which they would not go. If we  did not stop for luncheon the march could be ended early in the afternoon  and we could settle ourselves for the night in a temple which always proved  a veritable \"haven of rest\" after a long day"]]]
