The tombs of their successors were monuments of a moderate  size, involving no oppression of the people, but perhaps rather  improving their condition by causing a rise in the rate of wages.  Certainly, the native remains of the period give a cheerful  representation of the condition of all classes. The nation for the most  part enjoys peace, and applies itself to production. The wealth of the  nobles increases, and the position of their dependents is improved.  Slaves were few, and there was ample employment for the labouring  classes. We do not see the stick at work upon the backs of the labourers  in the sculptures of the time; they seem to accomplish their various  tasks with alacrity and gaiety of heart. They plough, and hoe, and reap;  drive cattle or asses; winnow and store corn; gather grapes and tread  them, singing in chorus as they tread; cluster round the winepress or  the threshingfloor, on which the animals tramp out the grain; gather  lotuses; save cattle from the inundation; engage in fowling or fishing;  and do all with an apparent readiness and cheerfulness which seems  indicative of real content. There may have been a darker side to the  picture, and undoubtedly was while Khufu and Shafra held the throne; but  kings of a morose and cruel temper seem to have been the exception,  rather than the rule, in Egypt; and the moral code, which required  kindness to be shown to dependents, seems, at this period at any rate,  to have had a hold upon the consciences, and to have influenced the  conduct, of the mass of the people. \"Happy the nation that has no  history!\" Egypt during this golden age was neither assailed by any  aggressive power beyond her borders, nor had herself conceived the idea  of distant conquest. An occasional raid upon the negroes of the South,  or chastisement of the nomades of the East, secured her interests in  those quarters, and prevented her warlike virtues from dying out through  lack of use. But otherwise tranquillity was undisturbed, and the  energies of the nation were directed to increasing its material  prosperity, and to progress in the arts.    Among the marvels of Egypt perhaps the Sphinx is second to none. The  mysterious being with the head of a man and the body of a lion is not at  all uncommon in Egyptian architectural adornment, but the one placed  before the Second Pyramid (the Pyramid of Shafra), and supposed to be  contemporary with it, astonishes the observer by its gigantic  proportions. It is known to the Arabs as Abul-hol, the father of terror.  It measures more than one hundred feet in length, and was partially  carved from the rocks of the Lybian hills. Between its out-stretched  feet there stands a chapel, uncovered in 1816, three walls of which are  formed by tablets bearing inscriptions indicative of its use and origin.    A small temple behind the great Sphinx, probably also built by Shafra,  is formed of great blocks of the hardest red granite, brought from the  neighbourhood of Syene and fitted to each other with a nicety  astonishing to modern architects, who are unable to imagine what tools  could have proved equal to the difficult achievement. Mysterious  passages pierce the great Sphinx and connect it with the Second Pyramid,  three hundred feet west of it. In the face of this mystery all questions  are vain, and yet every visitor adds new queries to those that others  have asked before him.        Since what unnumbered year        Hast thou kept watch and ward,      And o'er the buried land of fear        So grimly held thy guard?      No faithless slumber snatching,        Still couched in silence brave,      Like some fierce hound, long watching        Above her master's grave....          Dost thou in anguish thus        Still brood o'er OEdipus?      And weave enigmas to mislead anew,        And stultify the blind        Dull heads of human-kind,          And inly make thy moan,      That, mid the hated crew,        Whom thou so long couldst vex,        Bewilder and perplex,      Thou yet couldst find a subtler than thine own?          Even now; methinks that those        Dark, heavy lips which close        In such a stern repose,      Seem burdened with some thought unsaid,      And hoard within their portals dread        Some fearful secret there,      Which to the listening earth      She may not whisper forth.        Not even to the air!          Of awful wonders hid        In yonder dread Pyramid,          The home of magic fears;        Of chambers vast and lonely,        Watched by the Genii only,      Who tend their masters' long-forgotten biers,        And treasures that have shone        On cavern walls alone,          For thousand, thousand years.          Would she but tell. She knows        Of the old Pharaohs;      Could count the Ptolemies' long line;      Each mighty myth's original hath seen,      Apis, Anubis,--ghosts that haunt between        The bestial and divine,--      (Such he that sleeps in Philae,--he that stands        In gloom unworshipped, 'neath his rock-hewn lane,--      And they who, sitting on Memnonian sands,        Cast their long shadows o'er the desert plain:)          Hath marked Nitocris pass,          And Oxymandyas      Deep-versed in many a dark Egyptian wile,--        The Hebrew boy hath eyed        Cold to the master's bride;      And that Medusan stare hath frozen the smile      Of all her love and guile,        For whom the Caesar sighed,        And the world-loser died,--      The darling of the Nile.        FOOTNOTES:    [8] Fergusson, \"History of Architecture,\" vol. i. pp. 91, 92.          V.    THE RISE OF THEBES TO POWER, AND THE EARLY THEBAN KINGS.      Hitherto Egypt had been ruled from a site at the junction of the narrow  Nile valley with the broad plain of the Delta--a site sufficiently  represented by the modern Cairo. But now there was a shift of the seat  of power. There is reason to believe that something like a disruption of  Egypt into separate kingdoms took place, and that for a while several  distinct dynasties bore sway in different parts of the country.  Disruption was naturally accompanied by weakness and decline. The old  order ceased, and opportunity was offered for some new order--some new  power--to assert itself. The site on which it arose was one three  hundred and fifty miles distant from the ancient capital, or four  hundred and more by the river. Here, about lat. 26 deg., the usually narrow  valley of the Nile opens into a sort of plain or basin. The mountains on  either side of the river recede, as though by common consent, and leave  between themselves and the river's bank a broad amphitheatre, which in  each case is a rich green plain--an alluvium of the most productive  character--dotted with _dom_ and date palms, sometimes growing single,  sometimes collected into clumps or groves. On the western side the  Libyan range gathers itself up into a single considerable peak, which  has an elevation of twelve hundred feet. On the east the desert-wall  maintains its usual level character, but is pierced by valleys  conducting to the coast of the Red Sea. The situation was one favourable  for commerce. On the one side was the nearest route through the sandy  desert to the Lesser Oasis, which commanded the trade of the African  interior; on the other the way led through the valley of Hammamat, rich  with _breccia verde_ and other valuable and rare stones, to a district  abounding in mines of gold, silver, and lead, and thence to the Red Sea  coast, from which, even in very early times, there was communication  with the opposite coast of Arabia, the region of gums and spices.    In this position there had existed, probably from the very beginnings of  Egypt, a provincial city of some repute, called by its inhabitants Ape  or Apiu, and, with the feminine article prefixed, Tape, or Tapiu, which  some interpret \"The city of thrones\". To the Greeks the name \"Tape\"  seemed to resemble their own well-known \"Thebai\", whence they  transferred the familiar appellation from the Baeotian to the  Mid-Egyptian town, which has thus come to be known to Englishmen and  Anglo-Americans as \"Thebes.\" Thebes had been from the first the capital  of a \"nome\". It lay so far from the court that it acquired a character  of its own--a special cast of religion, manners, speech, nomenclature,  mode of writing, and the like--which helped to detach it from Lower or  Northern Egypt more even than its isolation. Still, it was not until  the northern kingdom sank into decay from internal weakness and  exhaustion, and disintegration supervened in the Delta and elsewhere,  that Thebes resolved to assert herself and claim independent  sovereignty. Apparently, she achieved her purpose without having  recourse to arms. The kingdoms of the north were content to let her go.  They recognized their own weakness, and allowed the nascent power to  develop itself unchecked and unhindered.    The first known Theban monarch is a certain Antef or Enantef, whose  coffin was discovered in the year 1827 by some Arabs near Qurnah, to the  west of Thebes. The mummy bore the royal diadem, and the epigraph on the  lid of the coffin declared the body which it contained to be that of  \"Antef, king of _the two Egypts._\" The phrase implied a claim to  dominion over the whole country, but a claim as purely nominal as that  of the kings of England from Edward IV. to George III. to be monarchs of  France and Navarre. Antef s rule may possibly have reached to  Elephantine on the one hand, but is not likely to have extended much  beyond Coptos on the other. He was a local chieftain posing as a great  sovereign, but probably with no intention to deceive either his own  contemporaries or posterity.
