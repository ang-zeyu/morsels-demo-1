He called the ministers to him, who were all  excellent men of different nations, and before them made such a  confession of Christian faith, as no book, but the heart, can truly  and feelingly deliver. Then calling for his will, and settling his  temporal affairs, the last scene of this tragedy, was the parting  between the two brothers. Sir Philip exerted all his soul in  endeavouring to suppress his sorrow, in which affection and nature  were too powerful for him, while the other demonstrated his tenderness  by immoderate transports of grief, a weakness which every tender  breast will easily forgive, who have ever felt the pangs of parting  from a brother; and a brother of Sir Philip Sidney's worth, demanded  still additional sorrow. He took his leave with these admonishing  words, \"My dear, much loved, honoured brother, love my memory; cherish  my friends; their faith to me may assure you they are honest. But  above all, govern your will and affections, by the will and word of  your Creator. In me, beholding the end of this world with all her  vanities.\" And with this farewel he desired the company to lead him  away.    After his death, which happened on the 16th of October, the States of  Zealand became suitors to his Majesty, and his noble friends, that  they might have the honour of burying his body at the public expence  of their government,[4] but in this they were denied; for soon after,  his body was brought to Flushing, and being embarked with great  solemnity on the 1st of November, landed at Tower Wharf on the 6th of  the same month; and the 16th of February following, after having lain  in state, it was magnificently deposited in St. Paul's Cathedral.    As the funeral of many princes has not exceeded it in solemnity, so  few have equalled it in the undissembled sorrow for his loss[5] King  James writ an epitaph upon him, and the Muses of Oxford lamenting him,  composed elegies to his memory. It may be justly said of this great  man, what a celebrated poet now living has applied to Archbishop Laud,      Around his tomb did art and genius weep,    Beauty, wit, piety, and bravery, were undissembled    mourners.    He left behind him one child named Elizabeth, (married to the earl of  Rutland) whom he had by Sir Francis Walsingham's daughter, and who  unfortunately died without issue to perpetuate the living virtues  of her illustrious family. She is said to have been excessively  beautiful; that she married the earl of Rutland by authority, but  that her affections were dedicated to the earl of Essex, and as Queen  Elizabeth was in love with that nobleman, she became very jealous of  this charming countess. It has been commonly reported[6] that Sir  Philip, some hours before his death, enjoyned a near friend to  consign his works to the flames. What promise his friend returned is  uncertain, but if he broke his word to befriend the public, posterity  has thank'd him, and every future age will with gratitude acknowledge  the favour.    Of all his works his Arcadia is the most celebrated; it is dedicated  to his sister the countess of Pembroke, who was a Lady of as fine a  character, and as equally finished in every female accomplishment, as  her brother in the manly. She lived to a good old age, and died  in 1621. Ben Johnson has wrote an epitaph upon her, so inimitably  excellent, that I cannot resist the temptation of inserting it here.  She was buried in the Cathedral Church of Salisbury, among the graves  of the family of the Pembrokes.    EPITAPH.      Underneath this marble hearse,    Lyes the subject of all verse,    Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother,    Death e're thou hast killed another,    Learned and fair, and good as she,    Time shall throw his dart at thee.    The Arcadia was printed first in 1613 in 4to; it has been translated  into almost every language. As the ancient AEgyptians presented secrets  under their mystical hyeroglyphics, so that an easy figure was  exhibited to the eye, and a higher notion couched under it to the  judgment, so all the Arcadia is a continual grove of morality,  shadowing moral and political truths under the plain and striking  emblems of lovers, so that the reader may be deceived, but not hurt,  and happily surprized to more knowledge than he expected.    Besides the celebrated Arcadia, Sir Philip wrote,    A dissuasive letter addressed to Queen Elizabeth; against her marriage  with the duke of Anjou, printed in a book called Serinia Ceciliana,  4to. 1663.    Astrophel & Stella, written at the desire of Lady Rich, whom he  perfectly loved, and is thought to be celebrated in the Arcadia by the  name of Philoclea.    --------------- Ourania, a poem, 1606.

The true PICTURE of LOVE.      Poore painters oft with silly poets joyne,    To fill the world with vain and strange conceits,    One brings the stuff, the other stamps the coyne    Which breeds nought else but glosses of deceits.    Thus painters Cupid paint, thus poets doe    A naked god, blind, young, with arrows two.      Is he a god, that ever flyes the light?    Or naked he, disguis'd in all untruth?    If he be blind, how hitteth he so right?    How is he young, that tamed old Phoebus    youth?    But arrowes two, and tipt with gold or lead,    Some hurt, accuse a third with horney head.      No nothing so; an old, false knave he is,    By Argus got on Io, then a cow:    What time for her, Juno her Jove did miss,    And charge of her to Argus did allow.    Mercury killed his false sire for this act,    His damme a beast was pardoned, beastly    fact.      With father's death, and mother's guilty shame,    With Jove's disdain at such a rival's feed:    The wretch compel'd, a runegate became,    And learn'd what ill, a miser-state did breed,    To lye, to steal, to prie, and to accuse,    Nought in himself, each other to abuse.

Of all our poets he seems to be the most courtly, the  bravest, the most active, and in the moral sense, the best.]    [Footnote 6: Camden Brit. in Kent.]           *       *       *       *       *      CHISTOPHER MARLOE    Was bred a student in Cambridge, but there is no account extant of his  family. He soon quitted the University, and became a player on the  same stage with the incomparable Shakespear. He was accounted, says  Langbaine, a very fine poet in his time, even by Ben Johnson himself,  and Heywood his fellow-actor stiles him the best of poets. In a copy  of verses called the Censure of the Poets, he was thus characterized.      Next Marloe bathed in Thespian springs,    Had in him those brave sublunary things,    That your first poets had; his raptures were    All air and fire, which made his verses clear;    For that fine madness still he did retain,    Which rightly should possess a poet's brain.    His genius inclined him wholly to tragedy, and he obliged the world  with six plays, besides one he joined for with Nash, called Dido Queen  of Carthage; but before I give an account of them, I shall present his  character to the reader upon the authority of Anthony Wood, which is  too singular to be passed over. This Marloe, we are told, presuming  upon his own little wit, thought proper to practise the most epicurean  indulgence, and openly profess'd atheism; he denied God, Our Saviour;  he blasphemed the adorable Trinity, and, as it was reported, wrote  several discourses against it, affirming Our Saviour to be a deceiver,  the sacred scriptures to contain nothing but idle stories, and all  religion to be a device of policy and priestcraft; but Marloe came to  a very untimely end, as some remarked, in consequence of his execrable  blasphemies. It happened that he fell deeply in love with a low girl,  and had for his rival a fellow in livery, who looked more like a pimp  than a lover. Marloe, fired with jealousy, and having some reason to  believe that his mistress granted the fellow favours, he rushed upon  him to stab him with his dagger; but the footman being quick, avoided  the stroke, and catching hold of Marloe's wrist stabbed him with his  own weapon, and notwithstanding all the assistance of surgery, he soon  after died of the wound, in the year 1593. Some time before his death,  he had begun and made a considerable progress in an excellent poem  called Hero and Leander, which was afterwards finished by George  Chapman, who fell short, as it is said, of the spirit and invention of  Marloe in the execution of it.    What credit may be due to Mr. Wood's severe representation of this  poet's character, the reader must judge for himself. For my part, I am  willing to suspend my judgment till I meet with some other testimony  of his having thus heinously offended against his God, and against the  best and most amiable system of Religion that ever was, or ever can  be: Marloe might possibly be inclined to free-thinking, without  running the unhappy lengths that Mr. Wood tells us, it was reported he  had done.

The angered boar bolted this way and that; but each time the new rope  held him where Tarzan had made it fast about the stem of the tree above  the branch from which he had cast it.    As Horta grunted and charged, slashing the sturdy jungle patriarch with  his mighty tusks until the bark flew in every direction, Tarzan dropped  to the ground behind him.  In the ape-man's hand was the long, keen  blade that had been his constant companion since that distant day upon  which chance had directed its point into the body of Bolgani, the  gorilla, and saved the torn and bleeding man-child from what else had  been certain death.    Tarzan walked in toward Horta, who swung now to face his enemy.  Mighty  and muscled as was the young giant, it yet would have appeared but the  maddest folly for him to face so formidable a creature as Horta, the  boar, armed only with a slender hunting knife.  So it would have seemed  to one who knew Horta even slightly and Tarzan not at all.    For a moment Horta stood motionless facing the ape-man.  His wicked,  deep-set eyes flashed angrily.  He shook his lowered head.    \"Mud-eater!\" jeered the ape-man. \"Wallower in filth.  Even your meat  stinks, but it is juicy and makes Tarzan strong.  Today I shall eat  your heart, O Lord of the Great Tusks, that it shall keep savage that  which pounds against my own ribs.\"    Horta, understanding nothing of what Tarzan said, was none the less  enraged because of that.  He saw only a naked man-thing, hairless and  futile, pitting his puny fangs and soft muscles against his own  indomitable savagery, and he charged.    Tarzan of the Apes waited until the upcut of a wicked tusk would have  laid open his thigh, then he moved--just the least bit to one side; but  so quickly that lightning was a sluggard by comparison, and as he  moved, he stooped low and with all the great power of his right arm  drove the long blade of his father's hunting knife straight into the  heart of Horta, the boar.  A quick leap carried him from the zone of  the creature's death throes, and a moment later the hot and dripping  heart of Horta was in his grasp.    His hunger satisfied, Tarzan did not seek a lying-up place for sleep,  as was sometimes his way, but continued on through the jungle more in  search of adventure than of food, for today he was restless.  And so it  came that he turned his footsteps toward the village of Mbonga, the  black chief, whose people Tarzan had baited remorselessly since that  day upon which Kulonga, the chief's son, had slain Kala.    A river winds close beside the village of the black men.  Tarzan  reached its side a little below the clearing where squat the thatched  huts of the Negroes.  The river life was ever fascinating to the  ape-man. He found pleasure in watching the ungainly antics of Duro, the  hippopotamus, and keen sport in tormenting the sluggish crocodile,  Gimla, as he basked in the sun.  Then, too, there were the shes and the  balus of the black men of the Gomangani to frighten as they squatted by  the river, the shes with their meager washing, the balus with their  primitive toys.    This day he came upon a woman and her child farther down stream than  usual.  The former was searching for a species of shellfish which was  to be found in the mud close to the river bank.  She was a young black  woman of about thirty.  Her teeth were filed to sharp points, for her  people ate the flesh of man.  Her under lip was slit that it might  support a rude pendant of copper which she had worn for so many years  that the lip had been dragged downward to prodigious lengths, exposing  the teeth and gums of her lower jaw.  Her nose, too, was slit, and  through the slit was a wooden skewer.  Metal ornaments dangled from her  ears, and upon her forehead and cheeks; upon her chin and the bridge of  her nose were tattooings in colors that were mellowed now by age.  She  was naked except for a girdle of grasses about her waist.  Altogether  she was very beautiful in her own estimation and even in the estimation  of the men of Mbonga's tribe, though she was of another people--a  trophy of war seized in her maidenhood by one of Mbonga's fighting men.    Her child was a boy of ten, lithe, straight and, for a black, handsome.  Tarzan looked upon the two from the concealing foliage of a near-by  bush.  He was about to leap forth before them with a terrifying scream,  that he might enjoy the spectacle of their terror and their incontinent  flight; but of a sudden a new whim seized him.  Here was a balu  fashioned as he himself was fashioned.  Of course this one's skin was  black; but what of it?  Tarzan had never seen a white man.  In so far  as he knew, he was the sole representative of that strange form of life  upon the earth.  The black boy should make an excellent balu for  Tarzan, since he had none of his own.  He would tend him carefully,  feed him well, protect him as only Tarzan of the Apes could protect his  own, and teach him out of his half human, half bestial lore the secrets  of the jungle from its rotting surface vegetation to the high tossed  pinnacles of the forest's upper terraces.    * * *    Tarzan uncoiled his rope, and shook out the noose.  The two before him,  all ignorant of the near presence of that terrifying form, continued  preoccupied in the search for shellfish, poking about in the mud with  short sticks.    Tarzan stepped from the jungle behind them; his noose lay open upon the  ground beside him.  There was a quick movement of the right arm and the  noose rose gracefully into the air, hovered an instant above the head  of the unsuspecting youth, then settled.  As it encompassed his body  below the shoulders, Tarzan gave a quick jerk that tightened it about  the boy's arms, pinioning them to his sides.  A scream of terror broke  from the lad's lips, and as his mother turned, affrighted at his cry,  she saw him being dragged quickly toward a great white giant who stood  just beneath the shade of a near-by tree, scarcely a dozen long paces  from her.    With a savage cry of terror and rage, the woman leaped fearlessly  toward the ape-man. In her mien Tarzan saw determination and courage  which would shrink not even from death itself.  She was very hideous  and frightful even when her face was in repose; but convulsed by  passion, her expression became terrifyingly fiendish.  Even the ape-man  drew back, but more in revulsion than fear--fear he knew not.    Biting and kicking was the black she's balu as Tarzan tucked him  beneath his arm and vanished into the branches hanging low above him,  just as the infuriated mother dashed forward to seize and do battle  with him.  And as he melted away into the depth of the jungle with his  still struggling prize, he meditated upon the possibilities which might  lie in the prowess of the Gomangani were the hes as formidable as the  shes.    Once at a safe distance from the despoiled mother and out of earshot of  her screams and menaces, Tarzan paused to inspect his prize, now so  thoroughly terrorized that he had ceased his struggles and his outcries.    The frightened child rolled his eyes fearfully toward his captor, until  the whites showed gleaming all about the irises.    \"I am Tarzan,\" said the ape-man, in the vernacular of the anthropoids.  \"I will not harm you.  You are to be Tarzan's balu.  Tarzan will  protect you.  He will feed you.  The best in the jungle shall be for  Tarzan's balu, for Tarzan is a mighty hunter.  None need you fear, not  even Numa, the lion, for Tarzan is a mighty fighter.  None so great as  Tarzan, son of Kala.  Do not fear.\"    But the child only whimpered and trembled, for he did not understand  the tongue of the great apes, and the voice of Tarzan sounded to him  like the barking and growling of a beast.  Then, too, he had heard  stories of this bad, white forest god.  It was he who had slain Kulonga  and others of the warriors of Mbonga, the chief.  It was he who entered  the village stealthily, by magic, in the darkness of the night, to  steal arrows and poison, and frighten the women and the children and  even the great warriors.  Doubtless this wicked god fed upon little  boys.  Had his mother not said as much when he was naughty and she  threatened to give him to the white god of the jungle if he were not  good? Little black Tibo shook as with ague.    \"Are you cold, Go-bu-balu?\" asked Tarzan, using the simian equivalent  of black he-baby in lieu of a better name.  \"The sun is hot; why do you  shiver?\"    Tibo could not understand; but he cried for his mamma and begged the  great, white god to let him go, promising always to be a good boy  thereafter if his plea were granted.  Tarzan shook his head.  Not a  word could he understand.  This would never do! He must teach  Go-bu-balu a language which sounded like talk.  It was quite certain to  Tarzan that Go-bu-balu's speech was not talk at all.  It sounded quite  as senseless as the chattering of the silly birds.  It would be best,  thought the ape-man, quickly to get him among the tribe of Kerchak  where he would hear the Mangani talking among themselves.  Thus he  would soon learn an intelligible form of speech.    Tarzan rose to his feet upon the swaying branch where he had halted far  above the ground, and motioned to the child to follow him; but Tibo  only clung tightly to the bole of the tree and wept.  Being a boy, and  a native African, he had, of course, climbed into trees many times  before this; but the idea of racing off through the forest, leaping  from one branch to another, as his captor, to his horror, had done when  he had carried Tibo away from his mother, filled his childish heart  with terror.    Tarzan sighed.  His newly acquired balu had much indeed to learn.  It  was pitiful that a balu of his size and strength should be so backward.  He tried to coax Tibo to follow him; but the child dared not, so Tarzan  picked him up and carried"]]]
