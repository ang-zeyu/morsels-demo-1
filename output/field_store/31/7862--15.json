Berlin is  endurable when one is alone; there one is busy, and can chatter all  day; but here it is enough to drive one mad; I must formerly have been  an entirely different mortal, to bear it as I did. * * * The girl  received the notice to leave very lightly and good-naturedly, as  quite a matter of course; Kahle, on the other hand, was beside  himself, and almost cried; said he could not find a place at  Christmas-time, and would go to the dogs, as he expressed it. I  consoled him by promising to pay his wages for another quarter if he  failed to find a place by New Year's. The girl is quite useless except  in cooking, of which more orally. I cannot enumerate all the little  trifles, and certainly Kahle does not belong to the better half of  gardeners. * * * I feel so vividly as if I were with you while writing  this that I am becoming quite gay, until I again recollect the three  hundred and fifty miles, including one hundred and seventy-five  without a railroad. Pomerania is terribly long, after all. Have you my  Kuelz letter, too? Bernhard has probably kept it in his pocket. Do not  prepay your letters, or they will be stolen. Innumerable books have  arrived from the binder; he claims one section of Scott's _Pirate_ is  missing; I know nothing about it. The tailor says that he has been  able to make only five pair of drawers from the stuff; presumably he  is wearing the sixth himself. Farewell, my sweetheart. Write as often  as you can, and give love and kisses to every one from me, large and  small. May God's mercy be with you.    Your most faithful v.B.      Schoenhausen, October 10, '50.    _My Darling_,--In a sullen rage I swoop down upon my inkstand after  just lighting the Town Councillor downstairs with the kindliest  countenance in the world. He sat here for two and a half hours by the  clock, moaning and groaning, without the least regard for my wry face;  I was just about to read the paper when he came. From ten to two I  crawled about the Elbe's banks, in a boat and on foot, with many  stupid people, attending to breakwaters, protective banks, and all  sorts of nonsense. This is, in general, a day of vexations; this  morning I dreamed so charmingly that I stood with you on the seashore;  it was just like the new strand, only the mud was rocks, the beeches  were thick-foliaged laurel, the sea was as green as the Lake of Traun,  and opposite us lay Genoa, which we shall probably never see, and it  was delightfully warm; then I was awakened by Hildebrand, accompanied  by a summoner, who brought me an order to serve as a juror at  Magdeburg from October 20th to November 16th, under penalty of from  one hundred to two hundred rix-dollars for each day of absence. I am  going there by the first train tomorrow, and hope to extricate myself;  for God so to punish my deep and restless longing for what is dearest  to me in this world, so that we shall not have the fleeting pleasure  of a couple of weeks together, would, indeed, be incredibly severe. I  am all excitement; that is our share in the newly achieved  liberty--that I am to be forced to spend my few days of freedom  sitting in judgment over thievish tramps of Jews, like a prisoner in a  fortress. I hope Gerlach can free me; otherwise I shall never speak to  him again. Tomorrow I shall at once drop you a line from Magdeburg, to  tell you how I succeed. * * * The people have abandoned the  dike-captain conspiracy against me; the Town Councillor says he will  not press it at all. He chattered to me for hours about his land-tax  commission, in which his anxiety drove him to rage against his own  flesh, and also, unfortunately, against ours. Our chief misfortune is  the cowardly servility towards those above and the chasing after  popularity below, which characterize our provincial councillor;  consequently public business, the chase, land-tax, etc., are all  deleteriously affected. It is due principally to the fact that he is  grossly ignorant and bungling in affairs, and is, therefore, for  better, for worse, in the hands of his democratic circuit secretary,  to whom he never dares to show his teeth; and, despite all that, the  fellow wears trousers, has been a soldier, and is a nobleman. La-Croix  is district-attorney at Madgeburg, withal, and he, too, must help me  to sneak out of it. It is still impossible for me to acquiesce in the  notion that we are to be separated all winter, and I am sick at heart  whenever I think of it; only now do I truly feel how very, very much  you and the _babies_ are part of myself, and how you fill my being.  That probably explains why it is that I appear cold to all except you,  even to mother; if God should impose on me the terrible affliction of  losing you, I feel, so far as my feelings can at this moment grasp and  realize such a wilderness of desolation, that I would then cling so to  your parents that mother would have to complain of being persecuted  with love. But away with all imaginary misery; there is enough in  reality. Let us now earnestly thank the Lord that we are all together,  even though separated by three hundred and fifty miles, and let us  experience the sweetness of knowing that we love each other very much,  and can tell each other so. To me it is always like ingratitude to God  that we choose to live apart so long, and are not together while He  makes it possible for us; but He will show us His will; all may turn  out differently; the Chambers may be dissolved, possibly very quickly,  as the majority is probably opposed to the Ministry. Manteuffel was  resolved upon it in that event, and it seems that Radowitz, since he  is Minister, has approached him, and, in general, wants to change his  politics again. Best love to all. Farewell. God keep you.    Your most faithful v.B.      Berlin, April 28, '51.    _My Dear Sweetheart_,--Mother's premonition that I would remain long  away has, unfortunately, proved correct this time. * * * The King was  the first to propose my nomination, and that at once, as a real  delegate to the Diet; his plan has, of course, encountered much  opposition, and has finally been so modified that Rochow will, it is  true, remain Minister at Petersburg, whither he is to return in two  months, but meanwhile, provisionally, he is commissioned to Frankfort,  and I am to accompany him, with the assurance that, on his leaving for  Petersburg, I shall be his successor. But this last is between  ourselves.    Now I want to go, first of all, to Frankfort, and take a  look at the situation, and hear how I shall stand pecuniarily pending  my definite appointment, of which I know nothing at all as yet. Then I  shall see whether I can leave again shortly after the start, and  whether I am to count on staying any longer; for, although I have,  indeed, accepted, still I am not yet sufficiently familiar with the  ground to be able to say definitely whether I shall stay there or  shortly get out again. As soon as that is decided, we shall probably,  after all, have to consider for you, too, the prospect of exchanging  your quiet Reinfeld existence for the noise of the Diet's diplomacy.  You folks have often complained that nothing was made of me by those  above me; now this is, beyond my expectations and wishes, a sudden  appointment to what is at this moment the most important post in our  diplomatic service; I have not sought it; I must assume that the Lord  wished it, and I cannot withdraw, although I foresee that it will be  an unfruitful and a thorny office, in which, with the best intentions,  I shall forfeit the good opinion of many people. But it would be  cowardly to decline. I cannot give you today further particulars as to  our plans, how we shall meet, what will be done about your going to  the seashore; only I shall try to make leisure, if possible, to see  you before. I feel almost like crying when I think of this sudden  upsetting of our innocent plans, as well as of the uncertainty when I  shall see you again, my beloved heart, and the babies; and I earnestly  pray God to arrange it all without detriment to our earthly welfare  and without harm to my soul. God be with you, my dear, and bring us  together again soon. With heartfelt love.    Your most faithful v.B.      Frankfort, May 14, '51.    _My Little Dear,_--* * * It seems to be getting constantly more  certain that I shall take Rochow's position in the summer. In that  event, if the rating remains as it was, I shall have a salary of  twenty-one thousand rix-dollars, but I shall have to keep a large  train and household establishment and you, my poor child, must sit  stiff and sedate in the drawing-room, be called Excellency, and be  clever and wise with Excellencies. * * * The city is not so bad as you  suppose; there are a great many charming villas before the gates,  similar to those in the Thiergarten, only more sunny. As Councillor of  Legation, it will be difficult for us to live there, owing to distance  and expense; but as Ambassador, quite as charming as is possible in a  foreign land. By letters of introduction I have quickly become  acquainted with the charming world hereabouts. Yesterday I dined with  the English Ambassador, Lord Cowley, nephew of the Duke of Wellington;  very kind, agreeable people; she is an elegant woman of about forty,  very worldly, but benevolent and easy to get acquainted with; I have  immediately put myself on a friendly footing with her, so that when  you step into the cold bath of diplomatic society she may be a  powerful support for you. Previously I called on a Frau von Stallupin  (pronounce Stolipine), a young woman without children, kindly, like  all Russian women, but terribly rich, and settled in a little  castle-like villa, so that one hardly dares to take a step or to sit  down; a Scharteuck interior is a rude barn compared with it."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13058"],[0,"The Teeth of the Tiger (#15)"],[1,"that the chief was clear of the matter and  that he had no more crows to pluck with his, Mazeroux's, superiors, whom  he revered almost as much as he did the chief. Everybody was now agreed;  they were \"friends all round\"; and Mazeroux was choking with delight.    \"They'll lock her up, eh?\"    \"No,\" said Perenna. \"There's not enough 'hold' on her for them to issue  a warrant.\"    \"What!\" growled Mazeroux indignantly. \"Not enough hold? I hope, in any  case, that you won't let her go. She made no bones, you know, about  attacking you! Come, Chief, polish her off, a she-devil like that!\"    Don Luis remained pensive. He was thinking of the unheard-of  coincidences, the accumulation of facts that bore down on Mme. Fauville  from every side. And the decisive proof which would join all these  different facts together and give to the accusation the grounds which it  still lacked was one which Perenna was able to supply. This was the marks  of the teeth in the apple hidden among the shrubs in the garden. To the  police these would be as good as any fingerprint, all the more as they  could compare the marks with those on the cake of chocolate.    Nevertheless, he hesitated; and, concentrating his anxious attention, he  watched, with mingled feelings of pity and repulsion, that woman who, to  all seeming, had killed her husband and her husband's son. Was he to give  her the finishing stroke? Had he the right to play the part of judge? And  supposing he were wrong?           *       *       *       *       *    Meantime, M. Desmalions had walked up to him and, while pretending to  speak to Mazeroux, was really asking Perenna:    \"What do you think of it?\"    Mazeroux shook his head. Perenna replied:    \"I think, Monsieur le Prefet, that, if this woman is guilty, she is  defending herself, for all her cleverness, with inconceivable lack  of skill.\"    \"Meaning--?\"    \"Meaning that she was doubtless only a tool in the hands of an  accomplice.\"    \"An accomplice?\"    \"Remember, Monsieur le Prefet, her husband's exclamation in your office  yesterday: 'Oh, the scoundrels! the scoundrels!' There is, therefore, at  least one accomplice, who perhaps is the same as the man who was present,  as Sergeant Mazeroux must have told you, in the Cafe du Pont-Neuf when  Inspector Verot was last there: a man with a reddish-brown beard,  carrying an ebony walking-stick with a silver handle. So that--\"    \"So that,\" said M. Desmalions, completing the sentence, \"by arresting  Mme. Fauville to-day, merely on suspicion, we have a chance of laying our  hands on the accomplice.\"    Perenna did not reply. The Prefect continued, thoughtfully:    \"Arrest her ... arrest her.... We should need a proof for that.... Did  you receive no clue?\"    \"None at all, Monsieur le Prefet. True, my search was only summary.\"    \"But ours was most minute. We have been through every corner of  the room.\"    \"And the garden, Monsieur le Prefet?\"    \"The garden also.\"    \"With the same care?\"    \"Perhaps not.... But I think--\"    \"I think, on the contrary, Monsieur le Prefet, that, as the murderers  passed through the garden in coming and going, there might be a chance--\"    \"Mazeroux,\" said M. Desmalions, \"go outside and make a more thorough  inspection.\"    The sergeant went out. Perenna, who was once more standing at one side,  heard the Prefect of Police repeating to the examining magistrate:    \"Ah, if we only had a proof, just one! The woman is evidently guilty. The  presumption against her is too great! ... And then there are Cosmo  Mornington's millions.... But, on the other hand, look at her ... look at  all the honesty in that pretty face of hers, look at all the sincerity of  her grief.\"    She was still crying, with fitful sobs and starts of indignant protest  that made her clench her fists. At one moment she took her tear-soaked  handkerchief, bit it with her teeth and tore it, after the manner of  certain actresses.    Perenna saw those beautiful white teeth, a little wide, moist and  gleaming, rending the dainty cambric. And he thought of the marks of  teeth on the apple. And he was seized with an extreme longing to know the  truth. Was it the same pair of jaws that had left its impress in the pulp  of the fruit?    Mazeroux returned. M. Desmalions moved briskly toward the sergeant, who  showed him the apple which he had found under the ivy. And Perenna at  once realized the supreme importance which the Prefect of Police attached  to Mazeroux's explanations and to his unexpected discovery.    A conversation of some length took place between the magistrates and  ended in the decision which Don Luis foresaw. M. Desmalions walked  across the room to Mme. Fauville. It was the catastrophe. He reflected  for a second on the manner in which he should open this final contest,  and then he asked:    \"Are you still unable, Madame, to tell us how you employed your time  last night?\"    She made an effort and whispered:    \"Yes, yes.... I took a taxi and drove about. ... I also walked a  little--\"    \"That is a fact which we can easily verify when we have found the  driver of the taxi. Meanwhile, there is an opportunity of removing the  somewhat ... grievous impression which your silence has left on our  minds.\"    \"I am quite ready--\"    \"It is this: the person or one of the persons who took part in the  crime appears to have bitten into an apple which was afterward thrown  away in the garden and which has just been found. To put an end to any  suppositions concerning yourself, we should like you to perform the  same action.\"    \"Oh, certainly!\" she cried, eagerly. \"If this is all you need to  convince you--\"    She took one of the three apples which Desmalions handed her from the  dish and lifted it to her mouth.    It was a decisive act. If the two marks resembled each other, the proof  existed, assured and undeniable.    Before completing her movement, she stopped short, as though seized with  a sudden fear.... Fear of what? Fear of the monstrous chance that might  be her undoing? Or fear rather of the dread weapon which she was about to  deliver against herself? In any case nothing accused her with greater  directness than this last hesitation, which was incomprehensible if she  was innocent, but clear as day if she was guilty!    \"What are you afraid of, Madame?\" asked M. Desmalions.    \"Nothing, nothing,\" she said, shuddering. \"I don't know.... I am afraid  of everything.... It is all so horrible--\"    \"But, Madame, I assure you that what we are asking of you has no sort of  importance and, I am persuaded, can only have a fortunate result for you.  If you don't mind, therefore--\"    She raised her hand higher and yet higher, with a slowness that betrayed  her uneasiness. And really, in the fashion in which things were  happening, the scene was marked by a certain solemnity and tragedy that  wrung every heart.    \"And, if I refuse?\" she asked, suddenly.    \"You are absolutely entitled to refuse,\" said the Prefect of Police. \"But  is it worth while, Madame? I am sure that your counsel would be the first  to advise you--\"    \"My counsel?\" she stammered, understanding the formidable meaning  conveyed by that reply.    And, suddenly, with a fierce resolve and the almost ferocious air that  contorts the face when great dangers threaten, she made the movement  which they were pressing her to make. She opened her mouth. They saw  the gleam of the white teeth. At one bite, the white teeth dug into  the fruit.    \"There you are, Monsieur,\" she said.    M. Desmalions turned to the examining magistrate.    \"Have you the apple found in the garden?\"    \"Here, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    M. Desmalions put the two apples side by side.    And those who crowded round him, anxiously looking on, all uttered one  exclamation.    The two marks of teeth were identical.    Identical! Certainly, before declaring the identity of every detail, the  absolute analogy of the marks of each tooth, they must wait for the  results of the expert's report. But there was one thing which there was  no mistaking and that was the complete similarity of the two curves.    In either fruit the rounded arch was bent according to the same  inflection. The two semicircles could have fitted one into the other,  both very narrow, both a little long-shaped and oval and of a restricted  radius which was the very character of the jaw.    The men did not speak a word. M. Desmalions raised his head. Mme.  Fauville did not move, stood livid and mad with terror. But all the  sentiments of terror, stupor and indignation that she might simulate with  her mobile face and her immense gifts as an actress, did not prevail  against the compelling proof that presented itself to every eye.    The two imprints were identical! The same teeth had bitten into  both apples!    \"Madame--\" the Prefect of Police began.    \"No, no,\" she cried, seized with a fit of fury, \"no, it's not  true.... This is all just a nightmare.... No, you are never going to  arrest me? I in prison! Why, it's horrible!... What have I done? Oh, I  swear that you are mistaken--\"    She took her head between her hands.    \"Oh, my brain is throbbing as if it would burst! What does all this mean?  I have done no wrong.... I knew nothing. It was you who told me this  morning.... Could I have suspected? My poor husband ... and that dear  Edmond who loved me ... and whom I loved! Why should I have killed them?  Tell me that! Why don't you answer?\" she demanded. \"People don't commit  murder without a motive.... Well?... Well?... Answer me, can't you?\"    And once more convulsed with anger, standing in an aggressive  attitude, with her clenched hands outstretched at the group of  magistrates, she screamed:    \"You're no better than butchers ... you have no right to torture a woman  like this.... Oh, how horrible! To accuse me ... to arrest me ... for  nothing! ... Oh, it's abominable! ... What butchers you all are! ... And  it's you in particular,\" addressing"]]]
