If anything was displaced, it might so very well have happened  as she closed the drawer; a jolt might have done it so easily.    \"You come, Jug, and decide. I really can't. It's too difficult.\"    But after a pause and a long glare Josephine would sigh, \"Now you've put  the doubt into my mind, Con, I'm sure I can't tell myself.\"    \"Well, we can't postpone it again,\" said Josephine. \"If we postpone it  this time--\"      Chapter 3.XII.    But at that moment in the street below a barrel-organ struck up.  Josephine and Constantia sprang to their feet together.    \"Run, Con,\" said Josephine. \"Run quickly. There's sixpence on the--\"    Then they remembered. It didn't matter. They would never have to stop  the organ-grinder again. Never again would she and Constantia be told to  make that monkey take his noise somewhere else. Never would sound that  loud, strange bellow when father thought they were not hurrying enough.  The organ-grinder might play there all day and the stick would not  thump.         \"It never will thump again,        It never will thump again,    played the barrel-organ.    What was Constantia thinking? She had such a strange smile; she looked  different. She couldn't be going to cry.    \"Jug, Jug,\" said Constantia softly, pressing her hands together. \"Do you  know what day it is? It's Saturday. It's a week to-day, a whole week.\"         \"A week since father died,        A week since father died,\"    cried the barrel-organ. And Josephine, too, forgot to be practical and  sensible; she smiled faintly, strangely. On the Indian carpet there fell  a square of sunlight, pale red; it came and went and came--and stayed,  deepened--until it shone almost golden.    \"The sun's out,\" said Josephine, as though it really mattered.    A perfect fountain of bubbling notes shook from the barrel-organ, round,  bright notes, carelessly scattered.    Constantia lifted her big, cold hands as if to catch them, and then her  hands fell again. She walked over to the mantelpiece to her favourite  Buddha. And the stone and gilt image, whose smile always gave her such  a queer feeling, almost a pain and yet a pleasant pain, seemed to-day  to be more than smiling. He knew something; he had a secret. \"I know  something that you don't know,\" said her Buddha. Oh, what was it, what  could it be? And yet she had always felt there was... something.    The sunlight pressed through the windows, thieved its way in, flashed  its light over the furniture and the photographs. Josephine watched it.  When it came to mother's photograph, the enlargement over the piano, it  lingered as though puzzled to find so little remained of mother, except  the earrings shaped like tiny pagodas and a black feather boa. Why did  the photographs of dead people always fade so? wondered Josephine. As  soon as a person was dead their photograph died too. But, of course,  this one of mother was very old. It was thirty-five years old. Josephine  remembered standing on a chair and pointing out that feather boa to  Constantia and telling her that it was a snake that had killed their  mother in Ceylon... Would everything have been different if mother hadn't  died? She didn't see why. Aunt Florence had lived with them until they  had left school, and they had moved three times and had their yearly  holiday and... and there'd been changes of servants, of course.    Some little sparrows, young sparrows they sounded, chirped on the  window-ledge. \"Yeep--eyeep--yeep.\" But Josephine felt they were not  sparrows, not on the window-ledge. It was inside her, that queer little  crying noise. \"Yeep--eyeep--yeep.\" Ah, what was it crying, so weak and  forlorn?    If mother had lived, might they have married? But there had been nobody  for them to marry. There had been father's Anglo-Indian friends before  he quarrelled with them. But after that she and Constantia never met a  single man except clergymen. How did one meet men? Or even if they'd met  them, how could they have got to know men well enough to be more than  strangers? One read of people having adventures, being followed, and so  on. But nobody had ever followed Constantia and her. Oh yes, there had  been one year at Eastbourne a mysterious man at their boarding-house who  had put a note on the jug of hot water outside their bedroom door! But  by the time Connie had found it the steam had made the writing too faint  to read; they couldn't even make out to which of them it was addressed.  And he had left next day. And that was all. The rest had been looking  after father, and at the same time keeping out of father's way. But now?  But now? The thieving sun touched Josephine gently. She lifted her face.  She was drawn over to the window by gentle beams...    Until the barrel-organ stopped playing Constantia stayed before the  Buddha, wondering, but not as usual, not vaguely. This time her wonder  was like longing. She remembered the times she had come in here, crept  out of bed in her nightgown when the moon was full, and lain on the  floor with her arms outstretched, as though she was crucified. Why? The  big, pale moon had made her do it. The horrible dancing figures on the  carved screen had leered at her and she hadn't minded. She remembered  too how, whenever they were at the seaside, she had gone off by herself  and got as close to the sea as she could, and sung something, something  she had made up, while she gazed all over that restless water. There had  been this other life, running out, bringing things home in bags, getting  things on approval, discussing them with Jug, and taking them back to  get more things on approval, and arranging father's trays and trying not  to annoy father. But it all seemed to have happened in a kind of tunnel.  It wasn't real. It was only when she came out of the tunnel into the  moonlight or by the sea or into a thunderstorm that she really felt  herself. What did it mean? What was it she was always wanting? What did  it all lead to? Now? Now?    She turned away from the Buddha with one of her vague gestures. She went  over to where Josephine was standing. She wanted to say something to  Josephine, something frightfully important, about--about the future and  what...    \"Don't you think perhaps--\" she began.    But Josephine interrupted her. \"I was wondering if now--\" she murmured.  They stopped; they waited for each other.    \"Go on, Con,\" said Josephine.    \"No, no, Jug; after you,\" said Constantia.    \"No, say what you were going to say. You began,\" said Josephine.    \"I... I'd rather hear what you were going to say first,\" said Constantia.    \"Don't be absurd, Con.\"    \"Really, Jug.\"    \"Connie!\"    \"Oh, Jug!\"    A pause. Then Constantia said faintly, \"I can't say what I was going to  say, Jug, because I've forgotten what it was... that I was going to say.\"    Josephine was silent for a moment. She stared at a big cloud where the  sun had been. Then she replied shortly, \"I've forgotten too.\"          4. MR. AND MRS. DOVE.    Of course he knew--no man better--that he hadn't a ghost of a chance,  he hadn't an earthly. The very idea of such a thing was preposterous.  So preposterous that he'd perfectly understand it if her father--well,  whatever her father chose to do he'd perfectly understand. In fact,  nothing short of desperation, nothing short of the fact that this was  positively his last day in England for God knows how long, would have  screwed him up to it. And even now... He chose a tie out of the chest  of drawers, a blue and cream check tie, and sat on the side of his bed.  Supposing she replied, \"What impertinence!\" would he be surprised? Not  in the least, he decided, turning up his soft collar and turning it down  over the tie. He expected her to say something like that. He didn't see,  if he looked at the affair dead soberly, what else she could say.    Here he was! And nervously he tied a bow in front of the mirror, jammed  his hair down with both hands, pulled out the flaps of his jacket  pockets. Making between 500 and 600 pounds a year on a fruit farm in--of  all places--Rhodesia. No capital. Not a penny coming to him. No chance  of his income increasing for at least four years. As for looks and all  that sort of thing, he was completely out of the running. He couldn't  even boast of top-hole health, for the East Africa business had knocked  him out so thoroughly that he'd had to take six months' leave. He was  still fearfully pale--worse even than usual this afternoon, he thought,  bending forward and peering into the mirror. Good heavens! What had  happened? His hair looked almost bright green. Dash it all, he hadn't  green hair at all events. That was a bit too steep. And then the green  light trembled in the glass; it was the shadow from the tree outside.  Reggie turned away, took out his cigarette case, but remembering how the  mater hated him to smoke in his bedroom, put it back again and drifted  over to the chest of drawers. No, he was dashed if he could think of one  blessed thing in his favour, while she... Ah!... He stopped dead, folded  his arms, and leaned hard against the chest of drawers.    And in spite of her position, her father's wealth, the fact  that she was an only child and far and away the most popular  girl in the neighbourhood; in spite of her beauty and her  cleverness--cleverness!--it was a great deal more than that, there  was really nothing she couldn't do; he fully believed, had it been  necessary, she would have been a genius at anything--in spite of the  fact that her parents adored her, and she them, and they'd as soon let  her go all that way as... In spite of every single thing you could think  of, so terrific was his love that he couldn't help hoping. Well, was  it hope? Or was this queer, timid longing to have the chance of looking  after her, of making it his job to see that she had everything she  wanted, and that nothing came near "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14291"],[0,"The Story of Geographical Discovery: How the World Became Known (#15)"],[1," the latter's reply he, like a good business man, shortened his  answer by giving a copy of the letter he had recently written to  Martinez. What was more important and more useful, Toscanelli sent  a map showing in hours (or degrees) the probable distance between  Spain and Cathay westward. By adding the information given by Marco  Polo to the incorrect views of Ptolemy about the breadth of the  inhabited world, Toscanelli reduced the distance from the Azores  to 52 deg., or 3120 miles. Columbus always expressed his indebtedness  to Toscanelli's map for his guidance, and, as we shall see, depended  upon it very closely, both in steering, and in estimating the distance  to be traversed. Unfortunately this map has been lost, but from  a list of geographical positions, with latitude and longitude,  founded upon it, modern geographers have been able to restore it  in some detail, and a simplified sketch of it may be here inserted,  as perhaps the most important document in Columbus's career.    Certainly, whether he had the idea of reaching the Indies by a  westward voyage before or not, he adopted Toscanelli's views with  enthusiasm, and devoted his whole life henceforth to trying to  carry them into operation.    He gathered together all the information he could get about the  fabled islands of the Atlantic--the Island of St. Brandan, where  that Irish saint found happy mortals; and the Island of Antilla,  imagined by others, with its seven cities. He gathered together  all the gossip he could hear--of mysterious corpses cast ashore  on the Canaries, and resembling no race of men known to Europe;  of huge canes, found on the shores of the same islands, evidently  carved by man's skill. Curiously enough, these pieces of evidence  were logically rather against the existence of a westward route to  the Indies than not, since they indicated an unknown race, but,  to an enthusiastic mind like Columbus's, anything helped to confirm  him in his fixed idea, and besides, he could always reply that  these material signs were from the unknown island of Zipangu, which  Marco Polo had described as at some distance from the shores of  Cathay.    He first approached, as was natural, the King of Portugal, in whose  land he was living, and whose traditional policy was directed to  maritime exploration. But the Portuguese had for half a century been  pursuing another method of reaching India, and were not inclined  to take up the novel idea of a stranger, which would traverse their  long-continued policy of coasting down Africa. A hearing, however,  was given to him, but the report was unfavourable, and Columbus had  to turn his eyes elsewhere. There is a tradition that the Portuguese  monarch and his advisers thought rather more of Columbus's ideas  at first; and attempted secretly to put them into execution; but  the pilot to whom they entrusted the proposed voyage lost heart  as soon as he lost sight of land, and returned with an adverse  verdict on the scheme. It is not known whether Columbus heard of  this mean attempt to forestall him, but we find him in 1487 being  assisted by the Spanish Court, and from that time for the next  five years he was occupied in attempting to induce the Catholic  monarchs of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, to allow him to try his  novel plan of reaching the Indies. The final operations in expelling  the Moors from Spain just then engrossed all their attention and  all their capital, and Columbus was reduced to despair, and was  about to give up all hopes of succeeding in Spain, when one of  the great financiers, a converted Jew named Luis de Santaguel,  offered to find means for the voyage, and Columbus was recalled.    [Illustration: BEHAIM'S GLOBE. 1492.]    On the 19th April 1492 articles were signed, by which Columbus  received from the Spanish monarchs the titles of Admiral and Viceroy  of all the lands he might discover, as well as one-tenth of all the  tribute to be derived from them; and on Friday the 3rd August, of  the same year, he set sail in three vessels, entitled the _Santa  Maria_ (the flagship), the _Pinta_, and the _Nina_. He started from  the port of Palos, first for the Canary Islands. These he left  on the 6th September, and steered due west. On the 13th of that  month, Columbus observed that the needle of the compass pointed due  north, and thus drew attention to the variability of the compass.  By the 21st September his men became mutinous and tried to force him  to return. He induced them to continue, and four days afterwards  the cry of \"Land! land!\" was heard, which kept up their spirits  for several days, till, on the 1st October, large numbers of birds  were seen. By that time Columbus had reckoned that he had gone  some 710 leagues from the Canaries, and if Zipangu were in the  position that Tostanelli's map gave it, he ought to have been in  its neighbourhood. It was reckoned in those days that a ship on  an average could make four knots an hour, dead reckoning, which  would give about 100 miles a day, so that Columbus might reckon  on passing over the 3100 miles which he thought intervened between  the Azores and Japan in about thirty-three days. All through the  early days of October his courage was kept up by various signs  of the nearness of land--birds and branches--while on the 11th  October, at sunset, they sounded, and found bottom; and at ten  o'clock, Columbus, sitting in the stern of his vessel, saw a light,  the first sure sign of land after thirty-five days, and in near  enough approximation to Columbus's reckoning to confirm him in the  impression that he was approaching the mysterious land of Zipangu.  Next morning they landed on an island, called by the natives Guanahain,  and by Columbus San Salvador. This has been identified as Watling  Island. His first inquiry was as to the origin of the little plates  of gold which he saw in the ears of the natives. They replied that  they came from the West--another confirmation of his impression.  Steering westward, they arrived at Cuba, and afterwards at Hayti  (St. Domingo). Here, however, the _Santa Maria_ sank, and Columbus  determined to return, to bring the good news, after leaving some  of his men in a fort at Hayti. The return journey was made in the  _Nina_ in even shorter time to the Azores, but afterwards severe  storms arose, and it was not till the 15th March 1493 that he reached  Palos, after an absence of seven and a half months, during which  everybody thought that he and his ships had disappeared.    He was naturally received with great enthusiasm by the Spaniards,  and after a solemn entry at Barcelona he presented to Ferdinand  and Isabella the store of gold and curiosities carried by some  of the natives of the islands he had visited. They immediately  set about fitting out a much larger fleet of seven vessels, which  started from Cadiz, 25th September 1493. He took a more southerly  course, but again reached the islands now known as the West Indies.  On visiting Hayti he found the fort destroyed, and no traces of  the men he had left there. It is needless for our purposes to go  through the miserable squabbles which occurred on this and his  subsequent voyages, which resulted in Columbus's return to Spain  in chains and disgrace. It is only necessary for us to say that  in his third voyage, in 1498, he touched on Trinidad, and saw the  coast of South America, which he supposed to be the region of the  Terrestrial Paradise. This was placed by the mediaeval maps at the  extreme east of the Old World. Only on his fourth voyage, in 1502,  did he actually touch the mainland, coasting along the shores of  Central America in the neighbourhood of Panama. After many  disappointments, he died, 20th May 1506, at Valladolid, believing,  as far as we can judge, to the day of his death, that what he had  discovered was what he set out to seek--a westward route to the  Indies, though his proud epitaph indicates the contrary:--      A Castilla y a Leon    | To Castille and to Leon    Nuevo mondo dio Colon. | A NEW WORLD gave Colon.[1]    [Footnote 1: Columbus's Spanish name was Cristoval Colon.]    To this day his error is enshrined in the name we give to the Windward  and Antilles Islands--West Indies: in other words, the Indies reached  by the westward route. If they had been the Indies at all, they  would have been the most easterly of them.    Even if Columbus had discovered a new route to Farther India, he  could not, as we have seen, claim the merit of having originated  the idea, which, even in detail, he had taken from Toscanelli.  But his claim is even a greater one. He it was who first dared  to traverse unknown seas without coasting along the land, and his  example was the immediate cause of all the remarkable discoveries  that followed his earlier voyages. As we have seen, both Vasco da  Gama and Cabral immediately after departed from the slow coasting  route, and were by that means enabled to carry out to the full  the ideas of Prince Henry; but whereas, by the Portuguese method  of coasting, it had taken nearly a century to reach the Cape of  Good Hope, within thirty years of Columbus's first venture the  whole globe had been circumnavigated.    The first aim of his successors was to ascertain more clearly what it  was that Columbus had discovered. Immediately after Columbus's third,  voyage, in 1498, and after the news of Vasco da Gama's successful  passage to the Indies had made it necessary to discover some strait  leading from the \"West Indies\" to India itself, a Spanish gentleman,  named Hojeda, fitted out an expedition at his own expense, with  an Italian pilot on board, named Amerigo Vespucci, and tried once  more to find a strait to India near Trinidad. They were, of course,  unsuccessful, but they coasted along and landed on the north coast  of South America, which, from certain resemblances, they termed  Little Venice (Venezuela). Next year, as we have seen, Cabral,  in"]]]
