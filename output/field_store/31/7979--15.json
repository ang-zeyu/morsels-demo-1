In reality it is a filthy outrage upon life, an idiot's smashing  of the furniture of homes, a mangling, a malignant mischief, a scalding  of stokers, a disemboweling of gunners, a raping of caught women by  drunken soldiers. By book and pamphlet, by picture and cinematograph  film, the pacifist must organize wisdom in these matters.    And not only indignation and distress must come to this task. The stern,  uncompromising militarist will not be moved from his determinations by  our horror and hostility. These things will but \"brace\" him. He has a  more vulnerable side. The ultimate lethal weapon for every form of  stupidity is ridicule, and against the high silliness of the militarist  it is particularly effective. It is the laughter of wholesome men that  will finally end war. The stern, strong, silent man will cease to  trouble us only when we have stripped him of his last rag of pretension  and touched through to the quick of his vanity with the realization of  his apprehended foolishness. Literature will have failed humanity if it  is so blinded by the monstrous agony in Flanders as to miss the  essential triviality at the head of the present war. Not the slaughter  of ten million men can make the quality of the German Kaiser other than  theatrical and silly.    The greater part of the world is in an agony, a fever, but that does not  make the cause of that fever noble or great. A man may die of yellow  fever through the bite of a mosquito; that does not make a mosquito  anything more than a dirty little insect or an aggressive imperialist  better than a pothouse fool.    Henceforth we must recognize no heroic war but defensive war, and as the  only honorable warriors such men as those peasants of Vise who went out  with shotguns against the multitudinous overwhelming nuisance of  invasion that trampled down their fields.    Or war to aid such defensive war.      II.    But the people who positively admire and advocate and want war for its  own sake are only a small, feverish minority of mankind. The greater  obstacle to the pacification of the world is not the war-seeker, but the  vast masses of people who for the most various motives support and  maintain all kinds of institutions and separations that make for war.  They do not want war, they do not like war, but they will not make  sacrifices, they will not exert themselves in any way to make war  difficult or impossible.    It is they who give the war maniac his opportunity. They will not lock  the gun away from him, they will not put a reasonable limit to the  disputes into which he can ultimately thrust his violent substitute for  a solution. They are like the people who dread and detest yellow fever,  but oppose that putting of petrol on the ponds which is necessary to  prevent it because of the injury to the water flowers.    Now, it is necessary, if we are to have an intelligently directed  anti-war campaign, that we should make a clear, sound classification of  these half-hearted people, these people who do not want war, but who  permit it. Their indecisions, their vagueness, these are the really  effective barriers to our desire to end war forever.    And first, there is one thing very obvious, and that is the necessity  for some controlling world authority if treaties are to be respected and  war abolished. While there are numerous sovereign States in the world  each absolutely free to do what it chooses, to arm its people or  repudiate engagements, there can be no sure peace. But great multitudes  of those who sincerely desire peace forever cannot realize this. There  are, for example, many old-fashioned English liberals who denounce  militarism and \"treaty entanglements\" with equal ardor; they want  Britain to stand alone, unaggressive, but free; not realizing that such  an isolation is the surest encouragement to any war-enamored power.  Exactly the same type is to be found in the United States, and is  probably even more influential there. But only by so spinning a web of  treaties that all countries are linked by general obligations to mutual  protection can a real world-pacification be achieved.    The present alliance against the insufferable militarism of Germany may  very probably be the precursor of a much wider alliance against any  aggression whatever in the future. Only through some such arrangement is  there any reasonable hope of a control and cessation of that constant  international bickering and pressure, that rivalry in finance, that  competition for influence in weak neutral countries, which has initiated  all the struggles of the last century, and which is bound to accumulate  tensions for fresh wars so long as it goes on.    Already several States, and particularly the Government of the United  States of America, have signed treaties of arbitration, and The Hague  Tribunal spins a first web of obligations, exemplary if gossamer,  between the countries of the world. But these are but the faint initial  suggestions of much greater possibilities, and it is these greater  possibilities that have now to be realized if all the talk we have had  about a war to end war is to bear any fruit. What is now with each week  of the present struggle becoming more practicable is the setting up of a  new assembly that will take the place of the various embassies and  diplomatic organizations, of a mediaeval pattern and tradition, which  have hitherto conducted international affairs.    This war must end in a public settlement, to which all of the  belligerents will set their hands; it will not be a bundle of treaties,  but one treaty binding eight or nine or more powers. This settlement  will almost certainly be attained at a conference of representatives of  the various Foreign Offices involved. Quite possibly interested neutral  powers will also send representatives. There is no reason whatever why  this conference should dissolve, why it should not become a permanent  conference upon the inter-relations of the participating powers and the  maintenance of the peace of the world. It could have a seat and  officials, a staff, and a revenue of its own; it could sit and debate  openly, publish the generally binding treaties between its constituent  powers, and claim for the support of its decisions their military and  naval resources.    The predominance of the greater powers could be secured either by the  representatives having multiple votes, according to the population  represented, or by some sort of proportional representation. Each power  could appoint its representatives through its Foreign Office or by  whatever other means it thought fit. They could as conveniently be  elected by a legislature or a nation. And such a body would not only be  of enormous authority in the statement, interpretation, and enforcement  of treaties, but it could also discharge a hundred useful functions in  relation to world hygiene, international trade and travel, the control  of the ocean, the exploration and conservation of the world's supplies  of raw material and food supply. It would be, in fact, a World Council.    Today this is an entirely practicable and hopeful proposal if only we  can overcome the opposition of those who cling to the belief that it is  possible for a country to be at the same time entirely pacific and  entirely unresponsible to and detached from the rest of mankind.    Given such a body, such a great alliance of world powers, much else in  the direction of world pacification becomes possible. Without it we may  perhaps expect a certain benefit from the improved good feeling of  mankind and the salutary overthrow of the German military culture, but  we cannot hope for any real organized establishment of peace.    I believe that a powerful support for the assembly and continuance of  such a world congress as this could be easily and rapidly developed in  North and South America, in Britain and the British Empire generally, in  France and Italy, in all the smaller States of northern, central, and  western Europe. It would probably have the personal support of the Czar,  unless he has profoundly changed the opinions with which he opened his  reign, the warm accordance of educated China and Japan, and the good  will of a renascent Germany. It would open a new era for mankind.      III.    Now, this idea of a congress of the belligerents to arrange the peace  settlements after this war, expanding by the accession of neutral powers  into a permanent world congress for the enforcement of international law  and the maintenance of the peace of mankind, is so reasonable and  attractive and desirable that if it were properly explained it would  probably receive the support of nineteen out of every twenty intelligent  persons.    Nevertheless, its realization is, on the whole, improbable. A mere  universal disgust with war is no more likely to end war than the  universal dislike for dying has ended death. And though war, unlike  dying, seems to be an avoidable fate, it does not follow that its  present extreme unpopularity will end it unless people not only desire  but see to the accomplishment of their desire.    And here again one is likely to meet an active and influential  opposition. Though the general will and welfare may point to the future  management of international relations through a world congress, the  whole mass of those whose business has been the direction of  international relations is likely to be either skeptical or actively  hostile to such an experiment. All the foreign offices and foreign  ministers, the diplomatists universally, the politicians who have  specialized in national assertion, and the courts that have symbolized  and embodied it, all the people, in fact, who will be in control of the  settlement, are likely to be against so revolutionary a change.    For it would be an entirely revolutionary change. It would put an end to  secrecy. It would end "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15479"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 2, May, 1915 (#15)"],[1,"was, in fact, so enormous  as to cause for a moment an ammunition crisis, which, however, was  completely overcome several weeks ago.    The methodical and complete exploitation of all the resources of the  country, organized since the beginning of the war, has enabled us to  accumulate a considerable stock of fresh munitions, and an increasing  rate of production is henceforth assured. We are thus sure of being able  to provide without particular effort for all the needs of the campaign,  present and future, however long the war may last, and it is this  certainty which has enabled us to supply projectiles to several of the  allied armies, among others, to the Serbian and Belgian armies. From  the statements of German prisoners we have learned that the  effectiveness of our new projectiles is superior to that of the old  ones.      FRENCH HEAVY GUNS SUPERIOR.    Our heavy artillery was in process of reorganization when the war broke  out, with the result that we were indisputably in a position of  inferiority in respect of this arm during the first battles. But today  the roles have been changed and our adversaries themselves acknowledge  the superiority of our heavy artillery.    The change has been brought about in various ways, partly by the intense  activity of the cannon foundries in new production, partly by the  employment at the front of the enormous reserves of artillery preserved  in the fortresses. The very large number of heavy guns at the front  represents only a part of the total number available for use. There is  an abundant stock of projectiles for the heavy artillery, which, as in  the case of the field gun ammunition, is daily growing in importance.  The same is true of the reserves of powder and other explosives and of  all materials needed for the manufacture of shells.    With regard to small arms, hand grenades, bombs, and all the devices for  lifetaking which the trench warfare at short distance has brought into  use, the position of the French troops is in every way favorable.    _There follows a passage on the development of the machine gun in this  kind of warfare._    Owing to the extended use of this weapon, the number supplied to the  various units has been appreciably increased, says the review. Not only  is each unit in possession of its full regulation complement of machine  guns, but the number of these guns attached to each unit has been  increased since Feb. 1 by one-third.    _The report next passes to the transport service, which, it says, has  worked with remarkable precision since the beginning of the war. This  section of the review closes by referring to food supplies for the army,  which are described as abundant._      _LONDON, March 27, (Correspondence of The Associated Press.)--The eighth  installment of the French official review of the war, previous chapters  of which have been published, takes up the German losses of officers,  the wastage of guns and projectiles, and \"the moral wastage of the  German Army.\"_    _The chapter on losses of officers begins with the statement that the  condition of the cadres, or basic organizations, in the German Army is  bad. The proportion of officers, and notably of officers by profession,  has been enormously reduced, it says; and a report made in December  showed that in a total of 124 companies, active or reserve, there were  only 49 officers of the active army. The active regiments have at the  present time, according to the review, an average of 12 professional  officers; the reserve regiments, 9 to 10; the reserve regiments of new  formation, 6 to 7; and it is to be remembered that these officers have  to be drawn upon afresh for the creation of new units._    \"If Germany creates new army corps, and if the war lasts ten months,\" it  continues, \"she will reduce almost to nothing the number of professional  officers in each regiment, a number which already is very insufficient.\"      FRENCH CONDITIONS IN CONTRAST.    _The French report points out that on the other hand, all the French  regiments have been constantly kept at a minimum figure of eighteen  professional officers per regiment. At the same time it admits that the  commanders of German corps, commanders of active battalions, and the  officers attached to the commanders of army corps are officers by  profession._    _The French report then addresses itself to the wastage of material.  Discussing the wastage of guns, it says:_    It is easy to ascertain the German losses in artillery. On Dec. 28 the  Sixty-sixth Regiment of Artillery entrained at Courtrai for Germany  twenty-two guns, of which eighteen were used up. This figure is  extremely high for a single regiment.    The same facts have been ascertained as regards heavy artillery. On  Dec. 21 and 22 seventy-seven guns of heavy artillery, which were no  longer serviceable, were sent to Cologne. These movements, which are not  isolated facts, show how ill the German artillery has resisted the  ordeal of the campaign.    Other proofs, moreover, are decisive. For some weeks we have noted the  very peculiar aspect of the marking on the bands of a great number of  shells of the 77 gun. When these markings are compared with those of  shells fired three months ago it is plain beyond all question that the  tubes are worn and that many of them require to be replaced. This loss  in guns is aggravated by the necessity which has arisen of drawing upon  the original army corps for the guns assigned to the recently formed  corps or those in course of formation. Several regiments of field  artillery have, in fact, had to give up two batteries.      WEARING OUT OF MATERIAL.    These two phenomena--wearing out of material and drafts upon  batteries--will inevitably result either in the reduction of batteries  from six to four guns, a reduction of the number of batteries in the  army corps, or the partial substitution for 77 guns of 9-centimeter  cannon of the old pattern, the presence of which has been many times  perceived at the front.    Furthermore, the German artillery lacks and has lacked for a very long  time munitions. It has been obliged to reduce its consumption of shells  in a notable degree. No doubt is possible in this respect. The  statements of prisoners since the battle of the Marne, and still more  since the battle of the Yser, make it clear that the number of shots  allowed to the batteries for each action is strictly limited. We have  found on officers killed or taken prisoner the actual orders prescribing  positively a strict economy of munitions.    For the last three months, too, we notice that the quality of the  projectiles is mediocre. Many of them do not burst. On Jan. 7, in the  course of a bombardment of Laventie, scarcely any of the German shells  burst. The proportion of non-bursts was estimated at two-fifths by the  British on Dec. 14, two-thirds by ourselves in the same month. On Jan. 3  at Bourg-et-Comin, and at other places since then, shrapnel fell the  explosion of which scarcely broke the envelope and the bullets were  projected without any force. About the same time our Fourteenth Army  Corps was fired at with shrapnel loaded with fragments of glass, and on  several points of our front shell casings of very bad quality have been  found, denoting hasty manufacture and the use of materials taken at  hazard.    From numerous indications it appears that the Germans are beginning to  run short of their 1898 pattern rifle. A certain number of the last  reinforcements (January) are armed with carbines or rifles of a poor  sort without bayonets. Others have not even rifles. Prisoners taken at  Woevre had old-pattern weapons.    The upshot of these observations is that Germany, despite her large  stores at the beginning, and the great resources of her industrial  production, presents manifest signs of wear, and that the official  optimism which she displays does not correspond with the reality of the  facts.      MORAL WASTAGE.    _Under the caption \"Moral Wastage of the German Army,\" the review  continues:_    The material losses of the German Army have corresponded with a moral  wastage which it is interesting and possible to follow, both from the  interrogation of prisoners and the pocketbooks and letters seized upon  them or on the killed.    At the beginning of the war the entire German Army, as was natural, was  animated by an unshakable faith in the military superiority of the  empire. It lived on the recollections of 1870, and on those of the long  years of peace, during which all the powers which had to do with Germany  displayed toward her a spirit of conciliation and patience which might  pass for weakness.    The first prisoners we took in August showed themselves wholly  indifferent to the reverses of the German Army. They were sincerely and  profoundly convinced that, if the German Army retired, it was in virtue  of a preconceived plan, and that our successes would lead to nothing.  The events at the end of August were calculated to strengthen this  contention in the minds of the German soldiers.    The strategic retreat of the French Army, the facility with which the  German armies were able to advance from Aug. 25 to Sept. 5, gave our  adversaries a feeling of absolute and final superiority, which  manifested itself at that time by all the statements gleaned and all the  documents seized.    At the moment of the battle of the Marne the first impression was one of  failure of comprehension and of stupor. A great number of German  soldiers, notably those who fell into our hands during the first days of  that battle, believed fully, as at the end of August, that the retreat  they were ordered to make was only a means of luring us into a trap.  German military opinion was suddenly converted when the soldiers saw  that this retreat continued, and that it was being carried out in  disorder, under conditions which left no doubt as to its cause and its  extent.    This time it was "]]]
