In 1886, Mr. R.E. Froude published in the Transactions of the  Institution of Naval Architects the deductions drawn from an extensive  series of trials made with four models of similar form and equal  diameter, but having different pitch ratios. Mr. S.W. Barnaby has  published some of the results of experiments made under the direction of  Mr. J.I. Thornycroft; and in his paper read before the Institution of  Civil Engineers in 1890 he has also put Mr. R.E. Froude's results into a  shape more suitable for comparison with practice. Nor ought Mr. G.A.  Calvert's carefully planned experiments to pass unnoticed, of which an  account was given in the Transactions of the Institution of Naval  Architects in 1887. These experiments were made on rectangular bodies  with sections of propeller blade form, moved through the water at  various velocities in straight lines, in directions oblique to their  plane faces; and from their results an estimate was formed of the  resistance of a screw.    One of the most important results deduced from experiments on model  screws is that they appear to have practically equal efficiencies  throughout a wide range both in pitch ratio and in surface ratio; so  that great latitude is left to the designer in regard to the form of the  propeller. Another important feature is that, although these experiments  are not a direct guide to the selection of the most efficient propeller  for a particular ship, they supply the means of analyzing the  performances of screws fitted to vessels, and of thus indirectly  determining what are likely to be the best dimensions of screw for a  vessel of a class whose results are known. Thus a great advance has been  made on the old method of trial upon the ship itself, which was the  origin of almost every conceivable erroneous view respecting the screw  propeller. The fact was lost sight of that any modification in form,  dimensions, or proportions referred only to that particular combination  of ship and propeller, or to one similar thereto; so something like  chaos was the result. This, however, need not be the case much longer.    In regard to the materials used for propellers, steel has been largely  adopted for both solid and loose-bladed screws; but unless protected in  some way, the tips of the blades are apt to corrode rapidly and become  unserviceable. One of the stronger kinds of bronze is often judiciously  employed for the blades, in conjunction with a steel boss. Where the  first extra expense can be afforded, bronze seems the preferable  material; the castings are of a reliable character, and the metal does  not rapidly corrode; the bronze blades can therefore with safety be made  lighter than steel blades, which favors their springing and  accommodating themselves more readily to the various speeds of the  different parts of the wake. This might be expected to result in some  slight increase of efficiency; of which, however, the writer has never  had the opportunity of satisfactorily determining the exact extent.  Instances can be brought forward where bronze blades have been  substituted for steel or iron with markedly improved results; but in  cases of this kind which the writer has had the opportunity of  analyzing, the whole improvement might be accounted for by the modified  proportions of the screw when in working condition. In other words, both  experiment and practical working alike go to show that, although cast  iron and steel blades as usually proportioned are sufficiently stiff to  retain their form while at work, bronze blades, being made much lighter,  are not; and the result is that the measured or set pitch is less than  that which the blades assume while at work. Some facts relative to this  subject have already been given in a recent paper by the author.    _Twin Screws_.--The great question of twin screw propulsion has been put  to the test upon a large scale in the mercantile marine, or rather in  what would usually be termed the passenger service. While engineers,  however, are prepared to admit its advantages so far as greater security  from total breakdown is concerned, there is by no means thorough  agreement as to whether single or twin screws have the greater  propulsive efficiency. What is required to form a sound judgment upon  the whole question is a series of examples of twin and single screw  vessels, each of which is known to be fitted with the most suitable  propeller for the type of vessel and speed; and until this information  is available, little can be said upon the subject with any certainty. So  far the following large passenger steamers, particulars of which are  given in table II., have been fitted with twin screws. It appears t be a  current opinion that the twin screw arrangement necessitates a greater  weight of machinery. This is not necessarily so, however; on the  contrary, the opportunity is offered for reducing the weight of all that  part of the machinery of which the weight relatively to power is  inversely proportional to the revolutions for a given power. This can be  reduced in the proportion of 1 to the square root of 2, that is 71 per  cent. of its weight in the single screw engine; for since approximately  the same total disk area is required in both cases with similar  proportioned propellers, the twins will work at a greater speed of  revolution than the single screw. From a commercial point of view there  ought to be little disagreement as to the advantage of twin screws, so  long as the loss of space incurred by the necessity for double tunnels  is not important; and for the larger passenger vessels now built for  ocean service the disadvantage should not be great. Besides their  superiority in the matter of immunity from total breakdown, and in  greatly diminished weight of machinery, they also offer the opportunity  of reducing to some extent the cost of machinery. A slightly greater  engine room staff is necessary; but this seems of little importance  compared with the foregoing advantages.

The principle,  however, on which this has generally been done is open to some  objections. It has been usual to compare the weight directly with the  indicated horse-power, and to express the comparison in pounds per  horse-power. So long as the machinery thus compared is for vessels of  the same class and working at about the same speed of revolution, no  great fault can be found; but as speed of revolution is a great factor  in the development of power, and as it is often dependent on  circumstances altogether external to the engine and concerning rather  the speed of the ship, the engines fitted to high speed ships will thus  generally appear to greater advantage than is their due. Leaving the  condenser out of the question, the weight of an engine would be much  better referred to cylinder capacity and working pressures, where these  are materially different, than directly to the indicated power. The  advantages of saving weight of machinery, so long as it can be done with  efficiency, are well known and acknowledged. If weight is to be reduced,  it must be done by care in design, not by reduction of strength, because  safety and saving of repairs are much more important than the mere  capability of carrying a few tons more of paying load. It must also be  done with economy; but this is a matter which generally settles itself  aright, as no shipowner will pay more for a saving in weight than will  bring in a remunerative interest on his outlay.

To resent an injury, received from a white  man, though of the lowest rank, and to dare to strike him, though upon the  strongest and grossest provocation, is an enormous crime. To attempt to  escape from the cruelties exercised upon us, by flight, is punished with  mutilation, and sometimes with death. To take arms against masters, whose  cruelties no submission can mitigate, no patience exhaust, and from whom no  other means of deliverance are left, is the most atrocious of all crimes;  and is punished by a gradual death, lengthened out by torments, so  exquisite, that none, but those who have been long familiarized, with West  Indian barbarity, can hear the bare recital of them without horror. And yet  I learn from writers, whom the Europeans hold in the highest esteem, that  treason is a crime, which cannot be committed by a slave against his  master; that a slave stands in no civil relation towards his master, and  owes him no allegiance; that master and slave are in a state of war; and if  the slave take up arms for his deliverance, he acts not only justifiably,  but in obedience to a natural duty, the duty of self-preservation. I read  in authors whom I find venerated by our oppressors, that to deliver one's  self and one's countrymen from tyranny, is an act of the sublimest heroism.  I hear Europeans exalted, as the martyrs of public liberty, the saviours of  their country, and the deliverers of mankind--I see other memories honoured  with statues, and their names immortalized in poetry--and yet when a  generous negro is animated by the same passion which ennobled them,--when  he feels the wrongs of his countrymen as deeply, and attempts to avenge  them as boldly--I see him treated by those same Europeans as the most  execrable of mankind, and led out, amidst curses and insults to undergo a  painful, gradual and ignominious death: And thus the same Briton, who  applauds his own ancestors for attempting to throw off the easy yoke,  imposed on them by the Romans, punishes us, as detested parricides, for  seeking to get free from the cruelest of all tyrannies, and yielding to the  irresistible eloquence of an African Galgacus or Boadicea.    Are then the reason and morality, for which Europeans so highly value  themselves, of a nature so variable and fluctuating, as to change with the  complexion of those, to whom they are applied?--Do rights of nature cease  to be such, when a negro is to enjoy them?--Or does patriotism in the heart  of an African, rankle into treason?    A Free Negro  --_American Museum_, V, 77 et seq., 1789.        REMARKABLE SPEECH OF ADAHOONZOU, KING OF DAHOMEY, AN INTERIOR NATION OF  AFRICA, ON HEARING WHAT WAS PASSING IN ENGLAND RESPECTING THE SLAVE TRADE      I admire the reasoning of the white men; but with all their sense, it does  not appear that they have thoroughly studied the nature of the blacks,  whose disposition differs as much from that of the whites, as their colour.  The same great Being formed both; and since it hath seemed convenient for  him to distinguish mankind by opposite complexions, it is a fair conclusion  to presume that there may be as a great a disagreement in the qualitie  of their minds; there is likewise a remarkable difference between the  countries which we inhabit. You, Englishmen, for instance, as I have been  informed, are surrounded by the ocean, and by this situation seem intended  to hold communication with the whole world, which you do, by means of your  ships; whilst we Dahomans, being placed on a large continent, and hemmed in  amidst a variety of other people, of the same complexion, but speaking  different languages, are obliged by the sharpness of our swords, to defend  ourselves from their incursions, and punish the depredations they make on  us. Such conduct in them is productive of incessant wars. Your countrymen,  therefore, who alledge that we go to war for the purpose of supplying your  ships with slaves, are grossly mistaken.    You think you can work a reformation as you call it, in the manners of  the blacks; but you ought to consider the disproportion between the  magnitude of the two countries; and then you will soon be convinced of  the difficulties that must be surmounted, to change the system of such a  vast country as this. We know you are a brave people, and that you might  bring over a great many of the blacks to your opinions, by points of your  bayonets; but to effect this, a great many must be put to death and  numerous cruelties must be committed, which we do not find to have been  the practice of the whites; besides, that this would militate against the  very principle which is professed by those who wish to bring about a  reformation.    In the name of my ancestors and myself, I aver, that no Dahoman ever  embarked in war merely for the sake of procuring wherewithal to purchase  your commodities. I, who have not been long master of this country, have  without thinking of the market, killed many thousands, and I shall kill  many thousands more. When policy or justice requires that men be put to  death, neither silk, nor coral, nor brandy, nor cowries, can be accepted  as substitutes for the blood that ought to be spilt for example sake:  besides if white men chuse to remain at home, and no longer visit this  country for the same purpose that has usually brought them thither, will  black men cease to make war? I answer, by no means, and if there be no  ships to receive their captives, what will become of them? I answer, for  you, they will be put to death. Perhaps you may be asked, how will the  blacks be punished with guns and powder? I reply by another question, had  we not clubs, and bows, and arrows before we knew white men? Did not you  see me make _custom_--annual ceremony--for Weebaigah, the third king of  Dahomey? And did you not observe on the day such ceremony was performing,  that I carried a bow in my hand, and a quiver filled with arrows on my  back? These were the emblems of the times; when, with such weapons, that  brave ancestor fought and conquered all his neighbors. God made war for  all the world; and every kingdom, large or small, has practiced it, more  or less, though perhaps in a manner unlike, and upon different principles.  Did Weebaigah sell slaves? No; his prisoners were all killed to a man.  What else could he have done with them? Was he to let them remain in this  country to cut the throats of his subjects? This would have been wretched  policy indeed; which, had it been adopted, the Dahoman name would have  long ago been extinguished, instead of becoming as it is at this day, the  terror of surrounding nations. What hurts me most is, that some of your  people have maliciously misrepresented us in books, which never die;  alledging that we sell our wives and children for the sake of procuring a  few kegs of brandy. No! We are shamefully belied, and I hope you will  contradict, from my mouth, the scandalous stories that have been  propagated; and tell posterity that we have been abused. We do, indeed,  sell to the white men a part of our prisoners, and we have a right to do  so. Are not all prisoners at the disposal of their captors? and are we to  blame, if we send delinquents to a far country? I have been told you do  the same. If you want no more slaves from us, why cannot you be ingenious  and tell the plain truth; saying that the slaves you have already  purchased are sufficient for the country for which you bought them; or  that the artists who used to make fine things, are all dead, without  having taught anybody to make more? But for a parcel of men, with long  heads, to sit down in England, and frame laws for us, and pretend to  dictate how we are to live, of whom they know nothing, never having been  in a black man's country during the whole course of their lives, is to me  somewhat extraordinary! No doubt they must have been biased by the report  of some one, who had had to do with us; who, for want of a due knowledge  of the treatment of slaves, found that they died on his hands, and that  his money was lost; and seeing that others thrived by the traffic, he  envious of their good luck, has vilified both black and white traders.    You have seen me kill many men at the customs; and you have often observed  delinquents at Grigwhee, and others of my provinces tied, and sent up to  me. I kill them, but do I ever insist on being paid for them? Some heads I  order to be placed at my door, others to be strewed about the market place,  that the people may stumble upon them, when they little expect such a  sight. This gives a grandeur to my customs, far beyond the display of fine  things which I buy; this makes my enemies fear me, and gives me such a name  in the Bush.[9] Besides, if I neglect this indispensable duty, would my  ancestors suffer me to live? would they not trouble me day and night, and  say, that I sent no body to serve them? that I was only solicitous about my  own name, and forgetful of my ancestors? White men are not acquainted with  these circumstances; but I now tell you that you may hear and know, and  inform your countrymen, why customs are made, and will be made, as long as  black men continue to possess their country; the few that can be spared  from this necessary celebration, we sell to the white men; and happy, no  doubt, are such, when they find themselves on the Grigwhee, to be disposed  of to the Europeans. \"We shall still drink water,\" say they to themselves;  \"white men will not kill us; and we may even"]]]
