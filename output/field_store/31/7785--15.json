They took her o'er the mountains,      They took her o'er the sea;    Move on, move on, my bonny sheep,      There is no rest for me!      NATURE AND ART[18] (1802)      Nature and art asunder seem to fly,      Yet sooner than we think find common ground;      In place of strife, harmonious songs resound,    And both, at one, to my abode draw nigh.    In sooth but one endeavor I descry:      Then only, when in ordered moments' round      Wisdom and toil our lives to Art have bound,    Dare we rejoice in Nature's liberty.    Thus is achievement fashioned everywhere:      Not by ungovernable, hasty zeal        Shalt thou the height of perfect form attain.    Husband thy strength, if great emprize thou dare;      In self-restraint thy masterhood reveal,        And under law thy perfect freedom gain.      COMFORT IN TEARS[19] (1803)      How is it that thou art so sad      When others are so gay?    Thou hast been weeping--nay, thou hast!      Thine eyes the truth betray.      \"And if I may not choose but weep      Is not my grief mine own?    No heart was heavier yet for tears--      O leave me, friend, alone!\"      Come join this once the merry band,      They call aloud for thee,    And mourn no more for what is lost,      But let the past go free.      \"O, little know ye in your mirth,      What wrings my heart so deep!    I have not lost the idol yet,      For which I sigh and weep.\"      Then rouse thee and take heart! thy blood      Is young and full of fire;    Youth should have hope and might to win,      And wear its best desire.      \"O, never may I hope to gain      What dwells from me so far;    It stands as high, it looks as bright,      As yonder burning star.\"      Why, who would seek to woo the stars      Down from their glorious sphere?    Enough it is to worship them,      When nights are calm and clear.      \"Oh, I look up and worship too--      My star it shines by day--    Then let me weep the livelong night      The while it is away.\"      EPILOGUE TO SCHILLER'S \"SONG OF THE  BELL\"[20]    [This fine piece, written originally in 1805, on Schiller's death,  was altered and recast by Goethe in 1815, on the occasion of the  performance on the stage of the _Song of the Bell_. Hence the allusion  in the last verse.]      To this city joy reveal it!    Peace as its first signal peal it!    (_Song of the Bell_--concluding lines).      And so it proved! The nation felt, ere long,    That peaceful signal, and, with blessings fraught,    A new-born joy appeared; in gladsome song    To hail the youthful princely pair we sought;    While in the living, ever-swelling throng    Mingled the crowds from every region brought,    And on the stage, in festal pomp arrayed,    The HOMAGE OF THE ARTS[21] we saw displayed.      When, lo! a fearful midnight sound I hear,    That with a dull and mournful echo rings.    And can it be that of our friend so dear    It tells, to whom each wish so fondly clings?    Shall death o'ercome a life that all revere?    How such a loss to all confusion brings!    How such a parting we must ever rue!    The world is weeping--shall not we weep, too?      He was our own! How social, yet how great    Seemed in the light of day his noble mind!    How was his nature, pleasing yet sedate,    Now for glad converse joyously inclined,    Then swiftly changing, spirit-fraught elate,    Life's plan with deep-felt meaning it designed,    Fruitful alike in counsel and in deed!    This have we proved, this tested, in our need.      He was our own! O may that thought so blest    O'ercome the voice of wailing and of woe!    He might have sought the Lasting, safe at rest    In harbor, when the tempest ceased to blow.    Meanwhile his mighty spirit onward pressed    Where goodness, beauty, truth, forever grow;    And in his rear, in shadowy outline, lay    The vulgar, which we all, alas, obey!      Now doth he deck the garden-turret fair    Where the stars' language first illumed his soul,    As secretly yet clearly through the air    On the eterne, the living sense it stole;    And to his own, and our great profit, there    Exchangeth to the seasons as they roll;    Thus nobly doth he vanquish, with renown,    The twilight and the night that weigh us down.      Brighter now glowed his cheek, and still more bright,    With that unchanging, ever-youthful glow,--    That courage which o'ercomes, in hard-fought fight,    Sooner or later, every earthly foe,--    That faith which, soaring to the realms of light,    Now boldly presseth on, now bendeth low,    So that the good may work, wax, thrive amain,    So that the day the noble may attain.      Yet, though so skilled, of such transcendent worth,    This boarded scaffold doth he not despise;    The fate that on its axis turns the earth    From day to night, here shows he to our eyes,    Raising, through many a work of glorious birth,    Art and the artist's fame up toward the skies.    He fills with blossoms of the noblest strife,    With life itself, this effigy of life.      His giant-step, as ye full surely know,    Measured the circle of the will and deed,    Each country's changing thoughts and morals, too,    The darksome book with clearness could he read;    Yet how he, breathless 'midst his friends so true,    Despaired in sorrow, scarce from pain was freed,--    All this have we, in sadly happy years,    For he was ours, bewailed with feeling tears.      When from the agonizing weight of grief    He raised his eyes upon the world again,    We showed him how his thoughts might find relief    From the uncertain present's heavy chain,    Gave his fresh-kindled mind a respite brief,    With kindly skill beguiling every pain,    And e'en at eve when setting was his sun,    From his wan cheeks a gentle smile we won.      Full early had he read the stern decree,    Sorrow and death to him, alas, were known;    Ofttimes recovering, now departed he,--    Dread tidings, that our hearts had feared to own!    Yet his transfigured being now can see    Itself, e'en here on earth, transfigured grown.    What his own age reproved, and deemed a crime,    Hath been ennobled now by death and time.      And many a soul that with him strove in fight,    And his great merit grudged to recognize,    Now feels the impress of his wondrous might,    And in his magic fetters gladly lies;    E'en to the highest hath he winged his flight,    In close communion linked with all we prize.    Extol him then! What mortals while they live    But half receive, posterity shall give.      Thus is he left us, who so long ago,--    Ten years, alas, already!--turned from earth;    We all, to our great joy, his precepts know,    Oh, may the world confess their priceless worth!    In swelling tide toward every region flow    The thoughts that were his own peculiar birth;    He gleams like some departing meteor bright,    Combining, with his own, eternal light.      ERGO BIBAMUS![22] (1810)      For a praiseworthy object we're now gathered here,    So, brethren, sing: ERGO BIBAMUS!    Tho' talk may be hushed, yet the glasses ring clear,    Remember then, ERGO BIBAMUS!    In truth 'tis an old, 'tis an excellent word,    With its sound befitting each bosom is stirred,    And an echo the festal hall filling is heard,    A glorious ERGO BIBAMUS!      I saw mine own love in her beauty so rare,    And bethought me of: ERGO BIBAMUS;    So I gently approached, and she let me stand there,    While I helped myself, thinking: BIBAMUS!    And when she's appeared, and will clasp you and kiss,    Or when those embraces and kisses ye miss,    Take refuge, till found is some worthier bliss,    In the comforting ERGO BIBAMUS!      I am called by my fate far away from each friend;    Ye loved ones, then: ERGO BIBAMUS!    With wallet light-laden from hence I must wend,    So double our ERGO BIBAMUS!    Whate'er to his treasure the niggard may add,    Yet regard for the joyous will ever be had,    For gladness lends ever its charms to the glad,    So, brethren, sing: ERGO BIBAMUS!      And what shall we say of to-day as it flies?    I thought but of:  ERGO BIBAMUS!    'Tis one of those truly that seldom arise,    So again and again sing: BIBAMUS!    For joy through a wide-open portal it guides,    Bright glitter the clouds as the curtain divides,    And a form, a divine one, to greet us in glides,    While we thunder our: ERGO BIBAMUS.      THE WALKING BELL[23] (1813)      A child refused to go betimes    To church like other people;    He roamed abroad, when rang the chimes    On Sundays from the steeple.      His mother said: \"Loud rings the bell,    Its voice ne'er think of scorning;    Unless thou wilt behave thee well,    'Twill fetch thee without warning.\"      The child then thought: \"High over head    The bell is safe suspended--\"    So to the fields he straightway sped    As if 'twas school-time ended.      The bell now ceased as bell to ring,    Roused by the mother's twaddle;    But soon ensued a dreadful thing!--    The bell begins to waddle.      It waddles fast, though strange it seem;    The child, with trembling wonder,    Runs off, and flies, as in a dream;    The bell would draw him under.      He finds the proper time at last,    And straightway nimbly rushes    To church, to chapel, hastening fast    Through pastures, plains, and bushes.      Each Sunday and each feast as well,    His late disaster heeds he;    The moment that he hears the bell,    No other summons needs he.      FOUND[24] (1813)      Once through the forest    Alone I went;    To seek for nothing    My thoughts were bent.      I saw i' the shadow    A flower stand there;    As stars it glisten'd,    As eyes 'twas fair.      I sought to pluck it,--    It gently said:    \"Shall I be gather'd    Only to fade?\"      With all its roots    I dug it with care,    And took it home    To my garden fair.      In silent corner    Soon it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11128"],[0,"The Red Thumb Mark (#15)"],[1,"hat evidently concealed a  bandage.    \"I am not really hurt at all,\" Thorndyke replied cheerily, \"though very  disreputable to look at. Just came a cropper in the mud, Jervis,\" he  added, as he noted my dismayed expression. \"Dinner and a clothes-brush  are what I chiefly need.\" Nevertheless, he looked very pale and shaken  when he came into the light on the landing, and he sank into his  easy-chair in the limp manner of a man either very weak or very  fatigued.    \"How did it happen?\" I asked when Polton had crept away on tip-toe to  make ready for dinner.    Thorndyke looked round to make sure that his henchman had departed, and  said--    \"A queer affair, Jervis; a very odd affair indeed. I was coming up from  the Borough, picking my way mighty carefully across the road on account  of the greasy, slippery mud, and had just reached the foot of London  Bridge when I heard a heavy lorry coming down the slope a good deal too  fast, considering that it was impossible to see more than a dozen yards  ahead, and I stopped on the kerb to see it safely past. Just as the  horses emerged from the fog, a man came up behind and lurched violently  against me and, strangely enough, at the same moment passed his foot in  front of mine. Of course I went sprawling into the road right in front  of the lorry. The horses came stamping and sliding straight on to me,  and, before I could wriggle out of the way, the hoof of one of them  smashed in my hat--that was a new one that I came home in--and  half-stunned me. Then the near wheel struck my head, making a dirty  little scalp wound, and pinned down my sleeve so that I couldn't pull  away my arm, which is consequently barked all the way down. It was a  mighty near thing, Jervis; another inch or two and I should have been  rolled out as flat as a starfish.\"    \"What became of the man?\" I asked, wishing I could have had a brief  interview with him.    \"Lost to sight though to memory dear: he was off like a lamplighter. An  alcoholic apple-woman picked me up and escorted me back to the hospital.  It must have been a touching spectacle,\" he added, with a dry smile at  the recollection.    \"And I suppose they kept you there for a time to recover?\"    \"Yes; I went into dry dock in the O. P. room, and then old Langdale  insisted on my lying down for an hour or so in case any symptoms of  concussion should appear. But I was only a trifle shaken and confused.  Still, it was a queer affair.\"    \"You mean the man pushing you down in that way?\"    \"Yes; I can't make out how his foot got in front of mine.\"    \"You don't think it was intentional, surely?\" I said.    \"No, of course not,\" he replied, but without much conviction, as it  seemed to me; and I was about to pursue the matter when Polton  reappeared, and my friend abruptly changed the subject.    After dinner I recounted my conversation with Walter Hornby, watching my  colleague's face with some eagerness to see what effect this new  information would produce on him. The result was, on the whole,  disappointing. He was interested, keenly interested, but showed no  symptoms of excitement.    \"So John Hornby has been plunging in mines, eh?\" he said, when I had  finished. \"He ought to know better at his age. Did you learn how long he  had been in difficulties?\"    \"No. But it can hardly have been quite sudden and unforeseen.\"    \"I should think not,\" Thorndyke agreed. \"A sudden slump often proves  disastrous to the regular Stock Exchange gambler who is paying  differences on large quantities of unpaid-for stock. But it looks as if  Hornby had actually bought and paid for these mines, treating them as  investments rather than speculations, in which case the depreciation  would not have affected him in the same way. It would be interesting to  know for certain.\"    \"It might have a considerable bearing on the present case, might it  not?\"    \"Undoubtedly,\" said Thorndyke. \"It might bear on the case in more ways  than one. But you have some special point in your mind, I think.\"    \"Yes. I was thinking that if these embarrassments had been growing up  gradually for some time, they might have already assumed an acute form  at the time of the robbery.\"    \"That is well considered,\" said my colleague. \"But what is the special  bearing on the case supposing it was so?\"    \"On the supposition,\" I replied, \"that Mr. Hornby was in actual  pecuniary difficulties at the date of the robbery, it seems to me  possible to construct a hypothesis as to the identity of the robber.\"    \"I should like to hear that hypothesis stated,\" said Thorndyke, rousing  himself and regarding me with lively interest.    \"It is a highly improbable one,\" I began with some natural shyness at  the idea of airing my wits before this master of inductive method; \"in  fact, it is almost fantastic.\"    \"Never mind that,\" said he. \"A sound thinker gives equal consideration  to the probable and the improbable.\"    Thus encouraged, I proceeded to set forth the theory of the crime as it  had occurred to me on my way home in the fog, and I was gratified to  observe the close attention with which Thorndyke listened, and his  little nods of approval at each point that I made.    When I had finished, he remained silent for some time, looking  thoughtfully into the fire and evidently considering how my theory and  the new facts on which it was based would fit in with the rest of the  data. At length he spoke, without, however, removing his eyes from the  red embers--    \"This theory of yours, Jervis, does great credit to your ingenuity. We  may disregard the improbability, seeing that the alternative theories  are almost equally improbable, and the fact that emerges, and that  gratifies me more than I can tell you, is that you are gifted with  enough scientific imagination to construct a possible train of events.  Indeed, the improbability--combined, of course, with possibility--really  adds to the achievement, for the dullest mind can perceive the  obvious--as, for instance, the importance of a finger-print. You have  really done a great thing, and I congratulate you; for you have  emancipated yourself, at least to some extent, from the great  finger-print obsession, which has possessed the legal mind ever since  Galton published his epoch-making monograph. In that work I remember he  states that a finger-print affords evidence requiring no  corroboration--a most dangerous and misleading statement which has been  fastened upon eagerly by the police, who have naturally been delighted  at obtaining a sort of magic touchstone by which they are saved the  labour of investigation. But there is no such thing as a single fact  that 'affords evidence requiring no corroboration.' As well might one  expect to make a syllogism with a single premise.\"  \"I suppose they  would hardly go so far as that,\" I said, laughing.    \"No,\" he admitted. \"But the kind of syllogism that they do make is  this--    \"'The crime was committed by the person who made this finger-print.    \"'But John Smith is the person who made the finger-print.    \"'Therefore the crime was committed by John Smith.'\"    \"Well, that is a perfectly good syllogism, isn't it?\" I asked.    \"Perfectly,\" he replied. \"But, you see, it begs the whole question,  which is, 'Was the crime committed by the person who made this  finger-print?' That is where the corroboration is required.\"    \"That practically leaves the case to be investigated without reference  to the finger-print, which thus becomes of no importance.\"    \"Not at all,\" rejoined Thorndyke; \"the finger-print is a most valuable  clue as long as its evidential value is not exaggerated. Take our  present case, for instance. Without the thumb-print, the robbery might  have been committed by anybody; there is no clue whatever. But the  existence of the thumb-print narrows the inquiry down to Reuben or some  person having access to his finger-prints.\"    \"Yes, I see. Then you consider my theory of John Hornby as the  perpetrator of the robbery as quite a tenable one?\"  \"Quite,\" replied  Thorndyke. \"I have entertained it from the first; and the new facts that  you have gathered increase its probability. You remember I said that  four hypotheses were possible: that the robbery was committed either by  Reuben, by Walter, by John Hornby, or by some other person. Now, putting  aside the 'some other person' for consideration only if the first three  hypotheses fail, we have left, Reuben, Walter, and John. But if we leave  the thumb-print out of the question, the probabilities evidently point  to John Hornby, since he, admittedly, had access to the diamonds,  whereas there is nothing to show that the others had. The thumb-print,  however, transfers the suspicion to Reuben; but yet, as your theory  makes evident, it does not completely clear John Hornby. As the case  stands, the balance of probabilities may be stated thus: John Hornby  undoubtedly had access to the diamonds, and therefore might have stolen  them. But if the thumb-mark was made after he closed the safe and before  he opened it again, some other person must have had access to them, and  was probably the thief.    \"The thumb-mark is that of Reuben Hornby, a fact that establishes a  _prima facie_ probability that he stole the diamonds. But there is no  evidence that he had access to them, and if he had not, he could not  have made the thumb-mark in the manner and at the time stated.    \"But John Hornby may have had access to the previously-made thumb-mark  of Reuben, and may possibly have obtained it; in which case he is almost  certainly the thief.    \"As to Walter Hornby, he may have had the means of obtaining Reuben's  thumb-mark; but there is no evidence that he had access either to the  diamonds or to Mr. Hornby's memorandum block. The _prima facie_  probabilities in his case, therefore, are very slight.\"    \"The actual points at issue, then,\" I said, \"are, whether Reuben had any  means of opening the safe, and whether Mr."]]]
