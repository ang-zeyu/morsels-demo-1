No doubt, from  the beginning to the end of the war--notably in the case of  Burgoyne--the British were seriously hampered by the dilatory and unsafe  counsels of Lord George Germaine, who was allowed by the favour of the  king to direct military operations, and who, we remember, had disgraced  himself on the famous battlefield of Minden.    All the conditions in the country at large were favourable to the  imperial troops had they been commanded by generals of ability. The  Loyalists formed a large available force, rendered valueless time after  time by the incapacity of the men who directed operations. At no time  did the great body of the American people warmly respond to the demands  made upon them by congress to support Washington. Had it not been for  New England and Virginia the war must have more than once collapsed for  want of men and supplies. It is impossible to exaggerate the absence of  public spirit in the States during this critical period of their  history. The English historian, Lecky, who has reviewed the annals of  those times with great fairness, has truly said: \"The nobility and  beauty of the character of Washington can hardly be surpassed; several  of the other leaders of the revolution were men of ability and public  spirit, and few armies have ever shown a nobler self-devotion than that  which remained with Washington through the dreary winter at Valley  Forge. But the army that bore those sufferings was a very small one, and  the general aspect of the American people during the contest was far  from heroic or sublime.\" This opinion is fully borne out by those  American historians who have reviewed the records of their national  struggle in a spirit of dispassionate criticism. We know that in the  spring of 1780 Washington himself wrote that his troops were \"constantly  on the point of starving for want of provisions and forage.\" He saw \"in  every line of the army the most serious features of mutiny and  sedition.\" Indeed he had \"almost ceased to hope,\" for he found the  country in general \"in such a state of insensibility and indifference to  its interests\" that he dare not flatter himself \"with any change for the  better.\" The war under such circumstances would have come to a sudden  end had not France liberally responded to Washington's appeals and  supported him with her money, her sailors and her soldiers. In the  closing years of the war Great Britain had not only to fight France,  Spain, Holland and her own colonies, but she was without a single ally  in Europe. Her dominion was threatened in India, and the king prevented  the intervention of the only statesman in the kingdom to whom the  colonists at any time were likely to listen with respect. When Chatham  died with a protest on his lips \"against the dismemberment of this  ancient monarchy,\" the last hope of bringing about a reconciliation  between the revolutionists and the parent state disappeared for ever,  and the Thirteen Colonies became independent at Yorktown.      SECTION 2.--Canada and Nova Scotia during the Revolution.    If Canada was saved to England during the American Revolution it was not  on account of the energy and foresight shown by the king and his  ministers in providing adequately for its defence, but mainly through  the coolness and excellent judgment displayed by Governor Carleton. The  Quebec act, for which he was largely responsible, was extremely  unpopular in the Thirteen Colonies, on account of its having extended  the boundaries of the province and the civil law to that western country  beyond the Alleghanies, which the frontiersmen of Pennsylvania and  Virginia regarded as specially their own domain. The fact that the  Quebec act was passed by parliament simultaneously with the Boston port  bill and other measures especially levelled against Massachusetts, gave  additional fuel to the indignation of the people, who regarded this  group of acts as part of a settled policy to crush the British-speaking  colonies.    Under these circumstances, the invasion of Canada by Arnold in 1775,  with the full approval of the continental congress, soon after the  taking of Crown Point and Ticonderoga by the \"Green Mountain boys\" of  Vermont, was a most popular movement which, it was hoped generally,  would end in the easy conquest of a province, occupied by an alien  people, and likely to be a menace in the future to the country south of  the St. Lawrence. The capture of Chambly and St. John's--the keys of  Canada, by way of Lake Champlain--was immediately followed by the  surrender of Montreal, which was quite indefensible, and the flight of  Carleton to Quebec, where he wisely decided to make a stand against the  invaders. At this time there were not one thousand regular troops in the  country, and Carleton's endeavour to obtain reinforcements from Boston  had failed in consequence of the timidity of Admiral Graves, who  expressed his opinion that it was not safe to send vessels up the St.  Lawrence towards the end of the month of October. No dependence  apparently could be placed at this critical juncture on a number of the  French _habitants_, as soon as the districts of Richelieu, Montreal and  Three Rivers were occupied by the continental troops. Many of them were  quite ready to sell provisions to the invaders, provided they were paid  in coin, and a few of them even joined Montgomery on his march to  Quebec. Happily, however, the influence of the clergy and the  _seigneurs_ was sufficiently powerful to make the great mass of the  people neutral during this struggle for supremacy in the province.    The bishop and the priests, from the outset, were quite alive to the  gravity of the situation. They could not forget that the delegates to  the continental congress, who were now appealing to French Canada to  join the rebellious colonists, had only a few weeks before issued an  address to the people of England in which they expressed their  astonishment that the British parliament should have established in  Canada \"a religion that had deluged their land in blood and dispersed  impiety, bigotry, persecution, murder, and rebellion through every part  of the world.\" Almost simultaneously with the capture of the forts on  Lake Champlain, Bishop Briand issued a _mandement_ in which he dwelt  with emphasis on the great benefits which the people of French Canada  had already derived from the British connection and called upon them all  to unite in the defence of their province. No doubt can exist that these  opinions had much effect at a time when Carleton had reason to doubt  even the loyalty of the English population, some of whom were  notoriously in league with the rebels across the frontier, and gave  material aid to the invaders as soon as they occupied Montreal. It was  assuredly the influence of the French clergy that rendered entirely  ineffectual the mission of Chase, Franklin, and the Carrolls of  Maryland--one of whom became the first Roman Catholic archbishop of the  United States--who were instructed by congress to offer every possible  inducement to the Roman Catholic subjects of England in Canada to join  the revolutionary movement.    Richard Montgomery, who had commanded the troops invading Canada, had  served at Louisbourg and Quebec, and had subsequently become a resident  of New York, where his political opinions on the outbreak of the  revolution had been influenced by his connection, through marriage, with  the Livingstones, bitter opponents of the British government. His merit  as a soldier naturally brought him into prominence when the war began,  and his own ambition gladly led him to obey the order to go to Canada,  where he hoped to emulate the fame of Wolfe and become the captor of  Quebec. He formed a junction, close to the ancient capital, with the  force under Benedict Arnold, who was at a later time to sully a  memorable career by an act of the most deliberate treachery to his  compatriots. When Montgomery and Arnold united their forces before  Quebec, the whole of Canada, from Lake Champlain to Montreal, and from  that town to the walls of the old capital, was under the control of the  continental troops. Despite the great disadvantages under which he  laboured, Carleton was able to perfect his defences of the city, which  he determined to hold until reinforcements should arrive in the spring  from England. Montgomery had neither men nor artillery to storm the  fortified city which he had hoped to surprise and easily occupy with the  aid of secret friends within its walls. Carleton, however, rallied all  loyal men to his support, and the traitors on whom the invaders had  relied were powerless to carry out any treacherous design they may have  formed. The American commanders at once recognised the folly of a  regular investment of the fortress during a long and severe winter, and  decided to attempt to surprise the garrison by a night assault. This  plan was earned out in the early morning of the thirty-first of  December, 1775, when the darkness was intensified by flurries of light  blinding snow, but it failed before the assailants could force the  barricades which barred the way to the upper town, where all the  principal offices and buildings were grouped, just below the chateau and  fort of St. Louis, which towers above the historic heights. Montgomery  was killed, Arnold was wounded at the very outset, and a considerable  number of their officers and men were killed or wounded.    Carleton saved Quebec at this critical hour and was able in the course  of the same year, when General Burgoyne arrived with reinforcements  largely composed of subsidised German regiments, to drive the  continental troops in confusion from the province and destroy the fleet  which congress had formed on Lake Champlain. Carleton took possession of  Crown Point but found the season too late--it was now towards the end of  autumn--to attempt an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12667"],[0,"Travels of Richard and John Lander into the interior of Africa, for the (#15)"],[1,"moors. Mr. Park and some of his attendants gave him a few sheets  of paper, on which to write his charms. Proceeding northward along  the banks of the river, they arrived at Mayemow, the chief man of  which town presented Mr. Park with a bullock, and he in return gave  him some amber and beads. Crossing the river, they entered  Fatteconda, the capital of Bondou, and received an invitation from a  slatee to lodge at his house, for as in Africa there are no inns,  strangers stand at the Bentang, or market-place, till they are  invited by some of the inhabitants. Soon afterwards, Mr. Park was  conducted to the king, who was desirous of seeing him immediately,  if he was not too much fatigued for the interview.    He took his interpreter with him, and followed the messenger till  they were quite out of the town, when suspecting some trick, Mr. Park  stopped and asked his guide, whither he was going?--Upon this, he  pointed to a man sitting under a tree at some little distance, and  told him that the king frequently gave audience in that retired  manner, in order to avoid a crowd of people. When he advanced, the  king desired him to come and sit by him upon the mat, and after  hearing his story, on which he made no observation, he inquired of  Mr. Park, if he wished to purchase any slaves or gold. Being answered  in the negative, he seemed surprised, but desired him to visit him  again in the evening, that he might be supplied with some provisions.    This prince was called Almami, and was a pagan. It was reported that  he had caused Major Houghton to be plundered. His behaviour,  therefore, at this interview, although distinguished by greater  civility than was expected, caused Mr. Park some uneasiness, for as  he was now entirely in his power, he thought it more politic to  conciliate the good opinion of the monarch, by a few presents.  Accordingly, in the evening, Mr. Park took with him a canister of  gunpowder, some amber, tobacco, and an umbrella; and as he considered  that his bundles would inevitably be searched, he concealed some few  articles in the roof of the hut where he lodged, putting on his new  blue coat, in order to preserve it.    Mr. Park on coming to the entrance of the court, as well as his guide  and interpreter, according to custom, took off their sandals, and the  former pronounced the king's name aloud, repeating it till he was  answered from within. They found the monarch sitting upon a mat, and  two attendants with him. Mr. Park told him his reasons for passing  through his country, but his majesty did but seem half satisfied. He  thought it impossible, he said, that any man in his senses would  undertake so dangerous a journey, merely to look at the country and  its inhabitants. When, however, Mr. Park had delivered his presents,  his majesty seemed well pleased, and was particularly delighted with  the umbrella, which he repeatedly furled and unfurled, to the great  admiration of himself and his two attendants, who could not for some  time comprehend the use of this wonderful machine. After this, Mr.  Park was about to take his leave, when the king began a long preamble  in favour of the whites, extolling their immense wealth and good  dispositions. He next proceeded to an eulogium on Mr. Park's blue  coat, of which the yellow buttons seemed particularly to please his  fancy, and he concluded by entreating Mr. Park to present him with  it, assuring him, as a matter of great consolation to him for the  loss of it, that he would wear it on all public occasions, and inform  every one who saw it, of the great liberality of Mr. Park towards  him. The request of an African prince, in his own dominions, comes  very little short of a command. Mr. Park, therefore, very quietly  took off his coat, the only good one in his possession, and laid it  at his feet. In return for his compliance, he presented Mr. Park  with great plenty of provisions, and desired to see him again in the  morning. Mr. Park accordingly attended, and found the king sitting on  his bed. His majesty told him he was sick, and wished to have a  little blood taken from him, but Mr. Park had no sooner tied up his  arm, and displayed the lancet, than his courage failed, and he begged  him to postpone the operation. He then observed, that his women were  very desirous to see him, and requested that he would favour them  with a visit. An attendant was ordered to conduct him, and he had no  sooner entered the court appropriated to the ladies, than the whole  seraglio surrounded him, some begging for physic, some for amber, and  all of them trying that great African specific, blood-letting. They  were ten or twelve in number, most of them young and handsome, and  wearing on their heads ornaments of gold and beads of amber. They  rallied him on the whiteness of his skin and the prominency of his  nose. They insisted that both were artificial, the first they said,  was produced when he was an infant, by dipping him in milk, and they  insisted that his nose had been pinched every day, till it had  acquired its present unsightly and unnatural conformation. On his  part, without disputing his own deformity, he paid them many  compliments on African beauty. He praised the glossy jet of their  skins, and the lovely depression of their noses; but they said, that  flattery, or as they emphatically termed it, _honey-mouth_, was not  esteemed in Bondou. The ladies, however, were evidently not  displeased, for they presented him with a jar of honey and some fish.    Mr. Park was desired to attend the king again, a little before  sunset, on which occasion he presented to his majesty some beads and  writing paper, as a small offering, in return for which the king gave  him five drachms of gold. He seconded the act by one still greater,  he suffered the baggage to pass without examination, and Mr. Park was  allowed to depart when he pleased.    Accordingly, on the morning of the 23d, Mr. Park left Fatteconda, and  in a few hours arrived at a small village, the boundary between  Bondou and Kajaaga. Hearing it was dangerous for travellers, Mr. Park  resolved to proceed by night, until they should reach a more  hospitable part of the country, and directed their course through the  woods. On this occasion, Mr. Park says, \"the stillness of the air,  the howling of the wild beasts, and the deep solitude of the forest,  made the scene solemn and impressive. Not a word was uttered by any  of us, but in a whisper; all were attentive, and every one anxious to  show his sagacity, by pointing out to me the wolves and hyenas, as  they glided, like shadows, from one thicket to another.\" The  following afternoon they arrived at Joag, in the kingdom of Kajaaga,  where they took up their abode at the house of the chief man, here  called the _dooty_. He was a rigid Mohammedan, but distinguished for  his hospitality. The town was supposed to contain about two thousand  inhabitants; it was surrounded by a high wall, in which were a number  of port-holes for musketry. Every man's possession was likewise  surrounded by a wall, the whole forming so many distinct citadels,  and, amongst a people unacquainted with the use of artillery, the  walls answer all the purposes of stronger fortifications.    The same evening, Madiboo, the Bushreen from Pisania, went to pay a  visit to his father and mother, who dwelt at a neighbouring town,  called Dramanet. He was joined by the blacksmith; and as soon as it  was dark, Mr. Park was invited to see the sports of the inhabitants.  A great crowd surrounded a dancing party; the dances, however,  consisted more in wanton gestures, than in muscular exertion or  graceful attitudes. The women vied with each other in displaying the  most voluptuous movements imaginable.    On the 25th December, early in the morning, a number of horsemen  entered the town, and came to the bentang on which Mr. Park had made  his bed. One of them, thinking he was asleep, attempted to steal his  musket; but finding that he could not effect his purpose  undiscovered, he desisted.    Mr. Park now perceived, by the countenance of the interpreter,  Johnson, that something bad was in agitation; he was also surprised  to see Madiboo, and the blacksmith so soon returned. On inquiring the  reason, Madiboo informed him, that as they were dancing at Dramanet,  ten horsemen belonging to Batcheri, the king, with his second son at  their head, had inquired if the white man had passed. The ten  horsemen mentioned by Madiboo arrived, and entering the bentang  dismounted, and seated themselves with those who had come before, the  whole being about twenty in number, forming a circle round him, and  each man holding his musket in his hand. Mr. Park now remarked to his  landlord, that as he did not understand the Serawoolii tongue, he  hoped whatever the men had to say, they would speak in Mandingo. To  this they agreed, and a man, loaded with a remarkable number of  saphies, opened the business in a long oration, purporting that the  white man had entered the king's town, without having first paid the  duties, or giving any present to the king, and that according to the  laws of the country, his people, cattle and baggage were forfeited,  and he added, that they had received orders from the king, to conduct  Mr. Park to Mauna. It would have been equally vain and imprudent to  have resisted or irritated such a body of men, he, therefore,  affected to comply with their demands. The poor blacksmith, who was a  native of Kasson, mistook this feigned compliance for a real  intention, and begged Mr. Park privately, that he would not entirely  ruin him by going to Mauna, adding, that as he had every reason to  believe that a war would soon take place between Kasson and Kajaaga,  he should not only lose his little property, the savings of four  years' industry, but should certainly be detained and sold as a  slave.    Mr. Park told the king's son, he was ready to go with him upon"]]]
