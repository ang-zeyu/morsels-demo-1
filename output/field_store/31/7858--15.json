This ever-moving,  ever-changing curve of steers rolled toward Jane and when below her,  scarce half a mile, it began to narrow and close into a circle. Lassiter  had ridden parallel with her position, turned toward her, then aside,  and now he was riding directly away from her, all the time pushing the  head of that bobbing line inward.    It was then that Jane, suddenly understanding Lassiter's feat stared  and gasped at the riding of this intrepid man. His horse was fleet and  tireless, but blind. He had pushed the leaders around and around till  they were about to turn in on the inner side of the end of that line  of steers. The leaders were already running in a circle; the end of the  herd was still running almost straight. But soon they would be wheeling.  Then, when Lassiter had the circle formed, how would he escape? With  Jane Withersteen prayer was as ready as praise; and she prayed for this  man's safety. A circle of dust began to collect. Dimly, as through a  yellow veil, Jane saw Lassiter press the leaders inward to close the gap  in the sage. She lost sight of him in the dust, again she thought she  saw the black, riderless now, rear and drag himself and fall. Lassiter  had been thrown--lost! Then he reappeared running out of the dust into  the sage. He had escaped, and she breathed again.    Spellbound, Jane Withersteen watched this stupendous millwheel of  steers. Here was the milling of the herd. The white running circle  closed in upon the open space of sage. And the dust circles closed above  into a pall. The ground quaked and the incessant thunder of pounding  hoofs rolled on. Jane felt deafened, yet she thrilled to a new sound. As  the circle of sage lessened the steers began to bawl, and when it closed  entirely there came a great upheaval in the center, and a terrible  thumping of heads and clicking of horns. Bawling, climbing, goring, the  great mass of steers on the inside wrestled in a crashing din, heaved  and groaned under the pressure. Then came a deadlock. The inner strife  ceased, and the hideous roar and crash. Movement went on in the outer  circle, and that, too, gradually stilled. The white herd had come to a  stop, and the pall of yellow dust began to drift away on the wind.    Jane Withersteen waited on the ridge with full and grateful heart.  Lassiter appeared, making his weary way toward her through the sage. And  up on the slope Judkins rode into sight with his troop of boys. For the  present, at least, the white herd would be looked after.    When Lassiter reached her and laid his hand on Black Star's mane, Jane  could not find speech.    \"Killed--my--hoss,\" he panted.    \"Oh! I'm sorry,\" cried Jane. \"Lassiter! I know you can't replace him,  but I'll give you any one of my racers--Bells, or Night, even Black  Star.\"    \"I'll take a fast hoss, Jane, but not one of your favorites,\" he  replied. \"Only--will you let me have Black Star now an' ride him over  there an' head off them fellers who stampeded the herd?\"    He pointed to several moving specks of black and puffs of dust in the  purple sage.    \"I can head them off with this hoss, an' then--\"    \"Then, Lassiter?\"    \"They'll never stampede no more cattle.\"    \"Oh! No! No!... Lassiter, I won't let you go!\"    But a flush of fire flamed in her cheeks, and her trembling hands shook  Black Star's bridle, and her eyes fell before Lassiter's.        CHAPTER VII. THE DAUGHTER OF WITHERSTEEN    \"Lassiter, will you be my rider?\" Jane had asked him.    \"I reckon so,\" he had replied.    Few as the words were, Jane knew how infinitely much they implied. She  wanted him to take charge of her cattle and horse and ranges, and save  them if that were possible. Yet, though she could not have spoken aloud  all she meant, she was perfectly honest with herself. Whatever the price  to be paid, she must keep Lassiter close to her; she must shield from  him the man who had led Milly Erne to Cottonwoods. In her fear she so  controlled her mind that she did not whisper this Mormon's name to her  own soul, she did not even think it. Besides, beyond this thing she  regarded as a sacred obligation thrust upon her, was the need of a  helper, of a friend, of a champion in this critical time. If she could  rule this gun-man, as Venters had called him, if she could even keep him  from shedding blood, what strategy to play his flame and his presence  against the game of oppression her churchmen were waging against her?  Never would she forget the effect on Tull and his men when Venters  shouted Lassiter's name. If she could not wholly control Lassiter, then  what she could do might put off the fatal day.    One of her safe racers was a dark bay, and she called him Bells because  of the way he struck his iron shoes on the stones. When Jerd led out  this slender, beautifully built horse Lassiter suddenly became all eyes.  A rider's love of a thoroughbred shone in them. Round and round Bells he  walked, plainly weakening all the time in his determination not to take  one of Jane's favorite racers.    \"Lassiter, you're half horse, and Bells sees it already,\" said Jane,  laughing. \"Look at his eyes. He likes you. He'll love you, too. How  can you resist him? Oh, Lassiter, but Bells can run! It's nip and tuck  between him and Wrangle, and only Black Star can beat him. He's too  spirited a horse for a woman. Take him. He's yours.\"    \"I jest am weak where a hoss's concerned,\" said Lassiter. \"I'll take  him, an' I'll take your orders, ma'am.\"    \"Well, I'm glad, but never mind the ma'am. Let it still be Jane.\"    From that hour, it seemed, Lassiter was always in the saddle, riding  early and late, and coincident with his part in Jane's affairs the days  assumed their old tranquillity. Her intelligence told her this was only  the lull before the storm, but her faith would not have it so.    She resumed her visits to the village, and upon one of these she  encountered Tull. He greeted her as he had before any trouble came  between them, and she, responsive to peace if not quick to forget, met  him halfway with manner almost cheerful. He regretted the loss of her  cattle; he assured her that the vigilantes which had been organized  would soon rout the rustlers; when that had been accomplished her riders  would likely return to her.    \"You've done a headstrong thing to hire this man Lassiter,\" Tull went  on, severely. \"He came to Cottonwoods with evil intent.\"    \"I had to have somebody. And perhaps making him my rider may turn out  best in the end for the Mormons of Cottonwoods.\"    \"You mean to stay his hand?\"    \"I do--if I can.\"    \"A woman like you can do anything with a man. That would be well, and  would atone in some measure for the errors you have made.\"    He bowed and passed on. Jane resumed her walk with conflicting thoughts.  She resented Elder Tull's cold, impassive manner that looked down upon  her as one who had incurred his just displeasure. Otherwise he would  have been the same calm, dark-browed, impenetrable man she had known  for ten years. In fact, except when he had revealed his passion in the  matter of the seizing of Venters, she had never dreamed he could be  other than the grave, reproving preacher. He stood out now a strange,  secretive man. She would have thought better of him if he had picked  up the threads of their quarrel where they had parted. Was Tull what  he appeared to be? The question flung itself in-voluntarily over Jane  Withersteen's inhibitive habit of faith without question. And she  refused to answer it. Tull could not fight in the open. Venters had said,  Lassiter had said, that her Elder shirked fight and worked in the dark.  Just now in this meeting Tull had ignored the fact that he had sued,  exhorted, demanded that she marry him. He made no mention of Venters.  His manner was that of the minister who had been outraged, but  who overlooked the frailties of a woman. Beyond question he seemed  unutterably aloof from all knowledge of pressure being brought to bear  upon her, absolutely guiltless of any connection with secret power over  riders, with night journeys, with rustlers and stampedes of cattle. And  that convinced her again of unjust suspicions. But it was convincement  through an obstinate faith. She shuddered as she accepted it, and that  shudder was the nucleus of a terrible revolt.    Jane turned into one of the wide lanes leading from the main street and  entered a huge, shady yard. Here were sweet-smelling clover, alfalfa,  flowers, and vegetables, all growing in happy confusion. And like these  fresh green things were the dozens of babies, tots, toddlers, noisy  urchins, laughing girls, a whole multitude of children of one family.  For Collier Brandt, the father of all this numerous progeny, was a  Mormon with four wives.    The big house where they lived was old, solid, picturesque the lower  part built of logs, the upper of rough clapboards, with vines growing  up the outside stone chimneys. There were many wooden-shuttered windows,  and one pretentious window of glass proudly curtained in white. As this  house had four mistresses, it likewise had four separate sections, not  one of which communicated with another, and all had to be entered from  the outside.    In the shade of a wide, low, vine-roofed porch Jane found Brandt's wives  entertaining Bishop Dyer. They were motherly women, of comparatively  similar ages, and plain-featured, and just at this moment anything but  grave. The Bishop was rather tall, of stout build, with iron-gray hair  and beard, and eyes of light blue. They were merry now; but Jane had  seen them when they were not, and then she feared him as she had feared  her father.    The women flocked around her in welcome.    \"Daughter of Withersteen,\" said the Bishop, gaily, as he took her hand,  \"you have not been prodigal of your gracious self of late. A Sabbath  without you at service! I shall reprove Elder Tull.\"    \"Bishop, the guilt is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13003"],[0,"Pioneers in Canada (#15)"],[1,"the warriors, for in respect to  others they add no more than in the case of women, who are considered  a useless class, accordingly but little is added in their case.\"    In the summer of 1615 Champlain, returning from France, made his way  up the Ottawa River, and, by a short portage, to Lake Nipissing,  thence down French River to the waters of Lake Huron. On the banks of  the French River he met a detachment of the Ottawa tribe (of the  Algonkin family). These people he styled the _Cheveux Releves_,  because the men's hair was gathered up and dressed more carefully and  becomingly on the top of the head than (he says) could at that time be  done by a hairdresser in France. This arrangement of the hair gave the  men a very handsome appearance, but here their toilet ended, for they  wore no clothes whatever (in the summertime), making up for this  simplicity by painting their faces in different colours, piercing  their ears and nostrils and decorating them with shell beads, and  tattooing their bodies and limbs with elaborate patterns.    These Ottawas carried a club, a long bow and arrows, and a round  shield of dressed leather, made (wrote Champlain) \"from the skin of an  animal like the buffalo\".[26] The chief of the party explained many  things to the white man by drawing with a piece of charcoal on the  white bark of the birch tree. He gave him to understand that the  present occupation of his band of warriors was the gathering of  blueberries, which would be dried in the sun, and could then be  preserved for eating during the winter.    [Footnote 26: This was the first intimation probably that any European  sent home for publication regarding the existence of the bison in  North America, though the Spanish explorers nearly a hundred years  before Champlain must have met with it in travelling through  Louisiana, Texas, and northern Mexico. The bison is not known ever to  have existed near Hudson Bay, or in Canada proper (basin of the St.  Lawrence). South of Canada it penetrated to Pennsylvania and the  Susquehanna River, but not farther eastward.]    From French River, Champlain passed southwards to the homeland of the  Hurons, which lay to the east of what Champlain called \"the Fresh  Water Sea\" (Lake Huron). This country he describes in enthusiastic  terms. The Hurons, like the other Iroquois tribes (and unlike the  hunting races to the north of them), were agriculturists, and  cultivated pumpkins, sunflowers,[27] beans and Indian corn.    [Footnote 27: The Amerindians of the Lake regions made much use of the  sunflowers of the region (_Helianthus multiflorus_). Besides this  species of sunflower already mentioned, which furnishes tubers from  its roots (the \"Jerusalem\" artichoke) others were valued for their  seeds, and some or all of these are probably the originals of the  cultivated sunflower in European gardens. The largest of these was  called _Soleille_ by the French Canadians. It grew in the cultivated  fields of the Amerindians to seven or eight feet in height, with an  enormous flower. The seeds were carefully collected and boiled. Their  oil was collected then from the water and was used to grease the hair.  This same Huron country (the Simcoe country of modern times) was  remarkable for its wild fruits. There was the Canada plum (_Prunus  americana_), the wild black cherry (_Prunus serotina_), the red  cherries (_P. pennsylvanica_), the choke cherry (_P. virginiana_),  wild apples (_Pyrus coronaria_), wild pears (a small berry-like pear  called \"poire\" by the French: _Pyrus canadensis_), and the may-apple  (_Podophyllum peltatum_). Champlain describes this may-apple as of the  form and colour of a small lemon with a similar taste, but having an  interior which is very good and almost like that of figs. The  may-apples grow on a plant which is two and a half feet high, with not  more than three or four leaves like those of the fig tree, and only  two fruits on each plant.]    The Hurons persuaded Champlain to go with them to attack the Iroquois  tribe of the Senekas (Entuhonorons) on the south shores of Lake  Ontario. On the way thither he noticed the abundance of stags and  bears, and, near the lake, of cranes, white and purple-brown.[28]    [Footnote 28: The cranes of Canada--so often alluded to by the French  explorers as \"Grues\"--are of two species, _Grus canadensis_, with its  plumage of a purple-grey, and _Grus americanus_, which is pure white  (see p. 139).]    On the southern shores of the lake[29] were large numbers of chestnut  trees, \"whose fruit was still in the burr. The chestnuts are small but  of a good flavour.\" The southern country was covered with forests,  with very few clearings. After crossing the Oneida River the Hurons  captured eleven of the Senekas, four women, one girl, three boys, and  three men. The people had left the stockade in which their relations  were living to go and fish by the lake shore. One of the Huron  chiefs--the celebrated Iroquet, who had been so much associated with  Champlain from the time of his arrival--proceeded at once to cut off  the finger of one of these women prisoners. Whereupon Champlain,  firmer than in years gone by, interposed and reprimanded him, pointing  out that it was not the act of a warrior such as he declared himself  to be, to conduct himself with cruelty towards women \"who had no  defence but their tears, so that one should treat them with humanity  on account of their helplessness and weakness\". Champlain went on to  say that this act was base and brutal, and that if he committed any  more of such cruelties he, Champlain, \"would have no heart to assist  or favour them in the war\". To this Iroquet replied that their enemies  treated them in the same manner, but that since this was displeasing  to the Frenchmen he would not do anything more to women, but he would  not promise to refrain from torturing the men.    [Footnote 29: Lakes Ontario and Huron were probably first actually  reached by Father Le Caron, a Recollett missionary who came out with  Champlain in 1615 (see p. 90), and by Etienne Brule, Champlain's  interpreter.]    However, in the subsequent fighting which occurred when they reached  the six-sided stockade of the Senekas (a strong fortification which  faced a large pond on one side, and was surrounded by a moat  everywhere else except at the entrance), the Hurons and Algonkins  showed a great lack of discipline. Champlain and the few Frenchmen  with him, by using their arquebuses, drove the enemy back into the  fort, but not without having some of their Indian allies wounded or  killed. Champlain proposed to the Hurons that they should erect what  was styled in French a _cavalier_--a kind of box, with high, loopholed  sides, which was erected on a tall scaffolding of stout timbers. This  was to be carried by the Hurons to within a pike's length of the  stockade. Four French arquebusiers then scrambled up into the  _cavalier_ and fired through the loopholes into the huts of the Seneka  town. Meantime the Hurons were to set fire, if possible, to the wooden  stockade. They managed the whole business so stupidly that the fire  produced no effect, the flames being blown in the opposite direction  to that which was desired. The brave Senekas threw water on to the  blazing sticks and put out the fire. Champlain was wounded by an arrow  in the leg and knee. The reinforcement of the five hundred Hurons  expected by the allies did not turn up. The Hurons with Champlain lost  heart, and insisted on retreating. Only the dread of the French  firearms prevented the retreat being converted into a complete  disaster. Whenever the Senekas came near enough to get speech with the  French they asked them \"why they interfered with native quarrels\".    Champlain being unable to walk, the Hurons made a kind of basket,  similar to that in which they carried their wounded. In this he was so  crowded into a heap, and bound and pinioned, that it was as impossible  for him to move \"as it would be for an infant in his swaddling  clothes\". This treatment caused him considerable pain after he had  been carried for some days; in fact he suffered agonies while fastened  in this way on to the back of a savage.    He was afterwards obliged to pass the winter of 1615-6 in the Huron  country. At that time it swarmed with game. Amongst birds, there were  swans, white cranes, brent-geese, ducks, teal, the redbreasted thrush  (which the Americans call \"robin\"), brown larks (_Anthus_), snipe, and  other birds too numerous to mention, which Champlain seems to have  brought down with his fowling-piece in sufficient quantities to feed  the whole party whilst waiting for the capture of deer on a large  scale.    Meanwhile, many of the Indians were catching fish, \"trout and pike of  prodigious size\". When they desired to secure a large number of deer,  they would make an enclosure in a fir forest in the form of the two  converging sides of a triangle, with an open base. The two sides of  these traps were made of great stakes of wood closely pressed  together, from 8 to 9 feet high; and each of the sides was 1000 yards  long. At the point of the triangle there was a little enclosure. The  Hurons were so expeditious in this work that in less than ten days  these long fences and the \"pound\" or enclosure at their convergence  were finished. They then started before daybreak and scattered  themselves in the woods at a considerable distance behind the  commencement of these fences, each man separated from his fellow by  about 80 yards. Every Huron carried two pieces of wood, one like a  drumstick and the other like a flat, resonant board. They struck the  flat piece of wood with the drumstick and it made a loud clanging  sound. The deer who swarmed in the forest, hearing this noise, fled  before the savages, who drove them steadily towards the converging  fences. As they closed up, the Hurons imitated very cleverly the  yapping of wolves. This"]]]
