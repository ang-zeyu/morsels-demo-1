Felix quietly chipped away at the block he was shaping, but his temper,  too, was inwardly rising. The same talk, varied in detail, but the same  in point, took place every time the brothers were together, and always  with the same result of anger. In earlier days Sir Constans had been as  forward in all warlike exercises as Oliver was now, and being possessed  of extraordinary physical strength, took a leading part among men.  Wielding his battle-axe with irresistible force, he distinguished  himself in several battles and sieges.    He had a singular talent for mechanical construction (the wheel by which  water was drawn from the well at the palace was designed by him), but  this very ingenuity was the beginning of his difficulties. During a long  siege, he invented a machine for casting large stones against the walls,  or rather put it together from the fragmentary descriptions he had seen  in authors, whose works had almost perished before the dispersion of the  ancients; for he, too, had been studious in youth.    The old Prince was highly pleased with this engine, which promised him  speedy conquest over his enemies, and the destruction of their  strongholds. But the nobles who had the hereditary command of the siege  artillery, which consisted mainly of battering-rams, could not endure to  see their prestige vanishing. They caballed, traduced the Baron, and he  fell into disgrace. This disgrace, as he was assured by secret messages  from the Prince, was but policy; he would be recalled so soon as the  Prince felt himself able to withstand the pressure of the nobles. But it  happened that the old Prince died at that juncture, and the present  Prince succeeded.    The enemies of the Baron, having access to him, obtained his confidence;  the Baron was arrested and amerced in a heavy fine, the payment of which  laid the foundation of those debts which had since been constantly  increasing. He was then released, but was not for some two years  permitted to approach the Court. Meantime, men of not half his descent,  but with an unblushing brow and unctuous tongue, had become the  favourites at the palace of the Prince, who, as said before, was not  bad, but the mere puppet of circumstances.    Into competition with these vulgar flatterers Aquila could not enter. It  was indeed pride, and nothing but pride, that had kept him from the  palace. By slow degrees he had sunk out of sight, occupying himself more  and more with mechanical inventions, and with gardening, till at last he  had come to be regarded as no more than an agriculturist. Yet in this  obscure condition he had not escaped danger.    The common people were notoriously attached to him. Whether this was due  to his natural kindliness, his real strength of intellect, and charm of  manner, or whether it was on account of the uprightness with which he  judged between them, or whether it was owing to all these things  combined, certain it is that there was not a man on the estate that  would not have died for him. Certain it is, too, that he was beloved by  the people of the entire district, and more especially by the shepherds  of the hills, who were freer and less under the control of the patrician  caste. Instead of carrying disputes to the town, to be adjudged by the  Prince's authority, many were privately brought to him.    This, by degrees becoming known, excited the jealousy and anger of the  Prince, an anger cunningly inflamed by the notary Francis, and by other  nobles. But they hesitated to execute anything against him lest the  people should rise, and it was doubtful, indeed, if the very retainers  of the nobles would attack the Old House, if ordered. Thus the Baron's  weakness was his defence. The Prince, to do him justice, soon forgot the  matter, and laughed at his own folly, that he should be jealous of a man  who was no more than an agriculturist.    The rest were not so appeased; they desired the Baron's destruction if  only from hatred of his popularity, and they lost no opportunity of  casting discredit upon him, or of endeavouring to alienate the  affections of the people by representing him as a magician, a thing  clearly proved by his machines and engines, which must have been  designed by some supernatural assistance. But the chief, as the most  immediate and pressing danger, was the debt to Francis the notary, which  might at any moment be brought before the Court.    Thus it was that the three sons found themselves without money or  position, with nothing but a bare patent of nobility. The third and  youngest alone had made any progress, if such it could be called. By  dint of his own persistent efforts, and by enduring insults and rebuffs  with indifference, he had at last obtained an appointment in that  section of the Treasury which received the dues upon merchandise, and  regulated the imposts. He was but a messenger at every man's call; his  pay was not sufficient to obtain his food, still it was an advance, and  he was in a government office. He could but just exist in the town,  sleeping in a garret, where he stored the provisions he took in with him  every Monday morning from the Old House. He came home on the Saturday  and returned to his work on the Monday. Even his patience was almost  worn out.    The whole place was thus falling to decay, while at the same time it  seemed to be flowing with milk and honey, for under the Baron's personal  attention the estate, though so carelessly guarded, had become a very  garden. The cattle had increased, and were of the best kind, the horses  were celebrated and sought for, the sheep valued, the crops the wonder  of the province. Yet there was no money; the product went to the notary.  This extraordinary fertility was the cause of the covetous longing of  the Court favourites to divide the spoil.          CHAPTER V    BARON AQUILA      Felix's own position was bitter in the extreme. He felt he had talent.  He loved deeply, he knew that he was in turn as deeply beloved; but he  was utterly powerless. On the confines of the estate, indeed, the men  would run gladly to do his bidding. Beyond, and on his own account, he  was helpless. Manual labour (to plough, to sow, to work on shipboard)  could produce nothing in a time when almost all work was done by  bondsmen or family retainers. The life of a hunter in the woods was  free, but produced nothing.    The furs he sold simply maintained him; it was barter for existence, not  profit. The shepherds on the hills roamed in comparative freedom, but  they had no wealth except of sheep. He could not start as a merchant  without money; he could not enclose an estate and build a house or  castle fit for the nuptials of a noble's daughter without money, or that  personal influence which answers the same purpose; he could not even  hope to succeed to the hereditary estate, so deeply was it encumbered;  they might, indeed, at any time be turned forth.    Slowly the iron entered into his soul. This hopelessness, helplessness,  embittered every moment. His love increasing with the passage of time  rendered his position hateful in the extreme. The feeling within that he  had talent which only required opportunity stung him like a scorpion.  The days went by, and everything remained the same. Continual brooding  and bitterness of spirit went near to drive him mad.    At last the resolution was taken, he would go forth into the world. That  involved separation from Aurora, long separation, and without  communication, since letters could be sent only by special messenger,  and how should he pay a messenger? It was this terrible thought of  separation which had so long kept him inactive. In the end the  bitterness of hopelessness forced him to face it. He began the canoe,  but kept his purpose secret, especially from her, lest tears should melt  his resolution.    There were but two ways of travelling open to him: on foot, as the  hunters did, or by the merchant vessels. The latter, of course, required  payment, and their ways were notoriously coarse. If on foot he could not  cross the Lake, nor visit the countries on either shore, nor the  islands; therefore he cut down the poplar and commenced the canoe.  Whither he should go, and what he should do, was entirely at the mercy  of circumstances. He had no plan, no route.    He had a dim idea of offering his services to some distant king or  prince, of unfolding to him the inventions he had made. He tried to  conceal from himself that he would probably be repulsed and laughed at.  Without money, without a retinue, how could he expect to be received or  listened to? Still, he must go; he could not help himself, go he must.    As he chopped and chipped through the long weeks of early spring, while  the easterly winds bent the trees above him, till the buds unfolded and  the leaves expanded--while his hands were thus employed, the whole map,  as it were, of the known countries seemed to pass without volition  before his mind. He saw the cities along the shores of the great Lake;  he saw their internal condition, the weakness of the social fabric, the  misery of the bondsmen. The uncertain action of the League, the only  thread which bound the world together; the threatening aspect of the  Cymry and the Irish; the dread north, the vast northern forests, from  which at any time invading hosts might descend on the fertile south--it  all went before his eyes.    What was there behind the immense and untraversed belt of forest which  extended to the south, to the east, and west? Where did the great Lake  end? Were the stories of the gold and silver mines of Devon and Cornwall  true? And where were the iron mines, from which the ancients drew their  stores of metal?    Led by these thoughts he twice or thrice left his labour, and walking  some twenty miles through the forests, and over the hills, reached the  summit of White Horse."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13962"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 455, September 20, 1884 (#15)"],[1,"of this work will be of interest in showing the general  practice followed in California for carrying water across deep mountain  gorges. In order to augment its water supply, the North Bloomfield Gravel  Mining Company desired to conduct water from a stream known as Texas  Creek, in Nevada County, California, across the Big Canon branch of the  South Yuba River into the main Bloomfield flume or aqueduct, which was  located on the side of Big Canon Creek, at a vertical elevation of 620  feet above the bed of the latter stream. The quantity of water to be  carried was about 32 cubic feet a second (1,250 miner's inches), which  could be diverted from Texas Creek at a point 480 feet vertical above the  Bloomfield flume. An aqueduct about 4,000 feet long, partly of ditch and  partly of flume, was needed to bring the water from the catchment dam on  the creek to the brow of the gorge. The vertical head for the pipe could  therefore be from a maximum of 460 feet down to any lesser head; with a  head of 460 feet, the pipe would be 4,790 feet long; and with a head of  220 feet, the length would be 4,290 feet. Assuming a maximum tensile  strain upon the iron of 16,500 pounds per square inch, with the formula  for the greatest head of about    d = (.359 l/h)^{1/5}, [or, v = 68 (dh/l)^{1/2}, and Q = 32],    and a lower value of the coefficient in the last equation for the lesser  heads, it was found, by calculation, that the least cost could be obtained  with a head from 300 to 350 feet. The head fixed upon was 303.6 feet, with  a length of 4,438.7 feet. A profile of the pipe, with nearly the same  horizontal and vertical scales (horizontal scale, showing slope lengths),  is given in Fig. 14; details are given in Figs. 15 and 16. The pipe was of  double riveted sheet iron, made in lengths of about 20 feet, and of the  following thicknesses:      1,349 linear feet,    0.083 inch thick.      220    \"            0.095     \"      240    \"            0.109     \"      250    \"            0.120     \"      320    \"            0.134     \"      610    \"            0.148     \"    1,450    \"            0.165     \"    Some of the iron was of the very poorest quality; the pipe was made by  contract in San Francisco, without the supervision of an inspector, as the  contractors were a firm of good reputation; the bad quality of the iron  was not detected until too late to have it corrected. Since then, the  writer has always had such pipes--the mines of which he has been the  manager using large quantities--made directly on the ground where they are  to be used; the pipe makers, in the latter case, always reject such sheets  as are too much below in thickness the standard gauge, and those which  show in passing through the rolls the bad quality of iron; tests of each  joint by hydrostatic pressure would add too much to the cost.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.]    The maximum tensile strain upon each of the seven thicknesses of iron used  was intended to be 16,500 pounds per square inch. Some of the sheets were  below the standard gauge, so that, in reality, the tensile strain is  sometimes as high as 18,000 pounds. The mean diameter of the pipe was  1.416 feet. The entrance into the pen-stock was tapered, so that the  coefficient of contraction was about 0.92. For pressures not exceeding say  380 feet, the joints were put together stove-pipe fashion. For greater  pressures, the joints were made by an inner sleeve riveted on one end of  the joint, with an outer lap-welded band, as shown by Fig. 15; lead was  run into the space between the outer band and the pipe, and then tightly  driven up by calking-irons. The pipe was laid under the bed of the Big  Canon Creek, a large stream when in freshet, where the head below the  hydraulic grade line was 760 feet. Some of the lead joints leaked slightly  at first, but this was soon remedied by more careful calking. No man-holes  or escape-gates were used. The pipe for the larger part of the year is not  filled at its upper end; when such is the case, the water at the inlet  carries down the pipe a great quantity of air, for which escapes must be  provided to prevent a jarring or throbbing, which would soon destroy the  pipe. The escape air-valves used are shown by Fig. 16. They consist simply  of a heavy flap valve of cast-iron, with recess for lead filling to give  greater weight set on top the pipe, seating on a vulcanized rubber  cushion, and swinging on a loose hinge. When the pipe is only partly  filled with water, the valves drop down by their own weight, allowing the  air to freely escape; when the water rises above the level of a valve, it  is tightly closed by the resulting pressure. There are fourteen of these  valves, those on the lower end being designed to allow air to freely enter  the pipe in case it should burst in the deeper portion, and thus prevent  any collapse from atmospheric pressure. The valves have answered the  desired purposes most effectually. The pipe was hauled over a road built  to the inlet end, and shot down the mountain side by means of a V-shaped  trough of wood. For the lower end, the joints were hauled up the cliff  side into place by a crab worked by horse-power. On steep inclinations,  the pipe was held firmly in place by wire ropes fastened to iron pins in  the solid rock, as shown by the sketch. The covering of earth and stone  was 1 foot to 2 feet in depth; with steep slopes, the earth was kept from  sliding by rough dry walls, or by cedar plank placed crosswise. The pipe  was laid in 1878; the first year it broke twice, owing to the wretched  quality of the iron; since then, it has given no trouble, and has required  practically no attention. The cost of this work--ditch and flume 4,000  feet, and pipe 4,440 feet--was $23,779.53.    A comparison of the relative values of n, in the formula v = n (r s)^{1/2},  for the foregoing ditch, flume, and pipe will be instructive. The ditch  has a width on the bottom of 3 feet, on the top of 6 feet, with a depth of  3 feet, and an inclination of 20 feet per mile; its sides are rough, being  cut in part through the rock and with sharp curves, although fairly  regular; with a flow of about 1,300 miner's inches (32.8 cubic feet per  second) the ditch runs about full.    Therefore:          6 + 3    a = ----- x 3 = 13.5 ;          2    [TEX: a = \\frac{6+3}{2} \\times 3 = 13.5;]               a    r = ------------- = 1.41 ;        3.3 + 3 + 3.3    [TEX: r = \\frac{a}{3.3 + 3 + 3.3} = 1.41;]            20       1    s = ------ = ----- ;         5280     264    [TEX: s = \\frac{20}{5280} = \\frac{1}{264};]      Q = 32.8, hence           Q    v = --- = 2.43;         a    [TEX: v = \\frac{Q}{a} = 2.43;]    and         /              {1/2} \\    n ( in v = n (r s)^    ) = 33.       \\                  /    [TEX: n\\ (\\text{in}\\ v = n (r s)^\\frac{1}{2}) = 33.]    The flume is of unplaned boards, rectangular, 2.67 wide x 2.83 deep, with  an inclination of 32 feet per mile. There are sharp curves, although these  were made as regular as practicable; the boiling action of the water  passing around these curves brought the flow line (Q = 32.8) nearly up to  the top of the sides; with a straight flume of the same size, the water  would have doubtless stood several inches lower.    Therefore:        a = 2.67 x 2.83 = 7.56 ;                    a      r =  -------------------- = 0.908 ;          2.83 + 2.67 + 2.83    [TEX: r = \\frac{a}{2.83 + 2.67 + 2.83} = 0.908;]               32       1      s =  ------ = ----- ;            5280     165    [TEX: s = \\frac{32}{5280} = \\frac{1}{165};]        Q = 32.8, hence             Q      v = --- = 4.34;           a    [TEX: v = \\frac{Q}{a} = 4.34;]        and n = 59.

The very singular and simple hydraulic motor which we illustrate herewith  is the invention of a Russian engineer, Mr. Jagn. It is scarcely as yet  known in Western Europe, where, however, something will probably be heard  of it ere long. Its true field would seem to be Egypt, India, or any  country where canals or rivers are used for irrigation, and where it is  desired to draw water from them at particular spots in the simplest and  cheapest manner. At present in nearly all such cases water is raised by  hand or steam power; nevertheless it must be obvious that the current of  the canal itself, slow though it may be, is quite sufficient to raise a  small portion of the discharge to the very moderate height generally  needed to lift it over the banks into the adjoining fields. Why then is it  not employed for the purpose? The answer is obvious, when we consider the  various hydraulic motors at present in use. Of course, motors worked by  water pressure must here be excluded; and we are left with scarcely  anything but the undershot wheel, the turbine, and the screw pump. All  these require expensive buildings and erections to set them to work,  present but a very small fraction of their surface to the water at any one  time, and must be very large and costly if they are to draw even a very  moderate amount of power"]]]
