[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14451"],[0,"African Camp Fires (#15)"],[1," latest fluffiest summer toilettes from London and Paris--I  mention a few of the refinements of civilization that offer to the  traveller some of the most piquant of contrasts.    For it must not be forgotten that Nairobi, in spite of these things--due  to the direct but slender thread of communication by railroad and  ships--is actually in the middle of an African wilderness--is a black  man's town, as far as numbers go.[6]    The game feeds to its very outskirts, even wanders into the streets at  night.[7] Lions may be heard roaring within a mile or so of town; and  leopards occasionally at night come on the verandas of the outlying  dwellings. Naked savages from the jungle untouched by civilization in  even the minutest particular wander the streets unabashed.    It is this constantly recurring, sharply drawn contrast that gives  Nairobi its piquant charm. As one sits on the broad hotel veranda a  constantly varied pageant passes before him. A daintily dressed,  fresh-faced Englishwoman bobs by in a smart rickshaw drawn by two  uniformed runners; a Kikuyu, anointed, curled, naked, brass adorned,  teeters along, an expression of satisfaction on his face; a horseman,  well appointed, trots briskly by followed by his loping syce; a string  of skin-clad women, their heads fantastically shaved, heavily  ornamented, lean forward under the burden of firewood for the market; a  beautiful baby in a frilled perambulator is propelled by a tall, solemn,  fine-looking black man in white robe and cap; the driver of a high cart  tools his animal past a creaking, clumsy, two-wheeled wagon drawn by a  pair of small humpbacked native oxen. And so it goes, all day long,  without end. The public rickshaw boys just across the way chatter and  game and quarrel and keep a watchful eye out for a possible patron on  whom to charge vociferously and full tilt. Two or three old-timers with  white whiskers and red faces continue to slaughter thousands and  thousands and thousands of lions from the depths of their easy chairs.    The stone veranda of that hotel is a very interesting place. Here gather  men from all parts of East Africa, from Uganda, and the jungles of the  Upper Congo. At one time or another all the famous hunters drop into its  canvas chairs--Cunninghame, Allan Black, Judd, Outram, Hoey, and the  others; white traders with the natives of distant lands; owners of farms  experimenting bravely on a greater or lesser scale in a land whose  difficulties are just beginning to be understood; great naturalists and  scientists from the governments of the earth, eager to observe and  collect this interesting and teeming fauna; and sportsmen just out and  full of interest, or just returned and modestly important. More  absorbing conversation can be listened to on this veranda than in any  other one place in the world. The gathering is cosmopolitan; it is  representative of the most active of every social, political, and racial  element; it has done things; it contemplates vital problems from the  vantage ground of experience. The talk veers from pole to pole--and  returns always to lions.    Every little while a native--a raw savage--comes along and takes up a  stand just outside the railing. He stands there mute and patient for  five minutes--a half hour--until some one, any one, happens to notice  him.    \"N'jo!--come here!\" commands this person.    The savage silently proffers a bit of paper on which is written the name  of the one with whom he has business.    \"Nenda officie!\" indicates the charitable person waving his hand  towards the hotel office.    Then, and not until this permission has been given by some one, dares  the savage cross the threshold to do his errand.    If the messenger happens to be a trained houseboy, however, dressed in  his uniform of khaki or his more picturesque white robe and cap, he is  privileged to work out his own salvation. And behind the hotel are rows  and rows of other boys, each waiting patiently the pleasure of his  especial bwana lounging at ease after strenuous days. At the drawling  shout of \"boy!\" one of them instantly departs to find out which  particular boy is wanted.    The moment any white man walks to the edge of the veranda a half-dozen  of the rickshaws across the street career madly around the corners of  the fence, bumping, colliding, careening dangerously, to drop  beseechingly in serried confusion close around the step. The rickshaw  habit is very strong in Nairobi. If a man wants to go a hundred yards  down the street he takes a rickshaw for that stupendous journey. There  is in justification the legend that the white man should not exert  himself in the tropics. I fell into the custom of the country until I  reflected that it would hardly be more fatal to me to walk a half-hour  in the streets of Nairobi than to march six or seven hours--as I often  did--when on safari or in the hunting field. After that I got a little  exercise, to the vast scandal of the rickshaw boys. In fact, so unusual  was my performance that at first I had fairly to clear myself a way with  my kiboko. After a few experiences they concluded me a particularly  crazy person and let me alone.    Rickshaws, however, are very efficient and very cheap. The runners, two  in number, are lithe little round-headed Kavirondos, generally, their  heads shaved to leave a skull cap, clad in scant ragged garments, and  wearing each an anklet of little bells. Their passion for ornament they  confine to small bright things in their hair and ears. They run easily,  with a very long stride. Even steep hills they struggle up somehow,  zigzagging from one side of the road to the other, edging along an inch  or so at a time. In such places I should infinitely have preferred to  have walked, but that would have lost me caste everywhere. There are  limits even to a crazy man's idiosyncrasies. For that reason I never  thoroughly enjoyed rickshaws, save along the level ways with bells  jingling and feet patpatting a rapid time. Certainly I did not enjoy  them going down the steep hills. The boy between the shafts in front  hits the landscape about every forty feet. I do not really object to  sudden death, but this form of it seemed unfair to some poor hungry  lion.    However, the winding smooth roads among the forested, shaded bungalows  of the upper part of town were very attractive, especially towards  evening. At that time the universal sun-helmet or double terai could be  laid aside for straw hats, cloth caps, or bare heads. People played the  more violent games, or strolled idly. At the hotel there was now a good  deal of foolish drinking; foolish, because in this climate it is very  bad for the human system, and in these surroundings of much interest and  excitement the relief of its exaltation from monotony or ennui or  routine could hardly be required.    FOOTNOTES:    [6] Fifteen hundred whites to twelve thousand natives, approximately.    [7] This happened twice while I was in the country.          XV.    PEOPLE.      Considered as a class rather than as individuals, the dark-skinned  population is easily the more interesting. Considered as individuals,  the converse is true. Men like Sir Percy Girouard, Hobley, Jackson, Lord  Delamere, McMillan, Cunninghame, Allan Black, Leslie Tarleton,  Vanderweyer, the Hill cousins, Horne, and a dozen others are nowhere  else to be met in so small a community. But the whites have developed  nothing in their relations one to another essentially different. The  artisan and shopkeeping class dwell on the flats; the Government people  and those of military connections live on the heights on one side of the  little stream; the civil service and bigger business men among the hills  on the other. Between them all is a little jealousy, and contempt, and  condescension; just as there is jealousy, and contempt, and  condescension elsewhere. They are pleasant people, and hospitable, and  some of them very distinguished in position or achievement; and I am  glad to say I have good friends among them.    But the native is the joy, and the never-ceasing delight. For his  benefit is the wide, glittering, colourful, insanitary bazaar, with its  dozens of little open-air veranda shops, its \"hotels\" where he can sit  in a real chair and drink real tea, its cafes, and the dark mysteries of  its more doubtful amusements. The bazaar is right in the middle of town,  just where it ought not to be, and it is constantly being quarantined,  and threatened with removal. It houses a large population mysteriously,  for it is of slight extent. Then on the borders of town are the two  great native villages--one belonging to the Somalis, and the other  hospitably accommodating the swarms of caravan porters and their  families. For, just as in old days Mombasa and Zanzibar used to be the  points from which caravans into the interior would set forth, now  Nairobi outfits the majority of expeditions. Probably ten thousand  picked natives of various tribes are engaged in the profession. Of  course but a small proportion of this number is ever at home at any one  time; but the village is a large one. Both these villages are built in  the native style, of plaster and thatch; have their own headman  government--under supervision--and are kept pretty well swept out and  tidy. Besides these three main gathering places are many camps and  \"shambas\"[8] scattered everywhere; and the back country counts millions  of raw jungle savages, only too glad to drift in occasionally for a look  at the metropolis.    At first the newcomer is absolutely bewildered by the variety of these  peoples; but after a little he learns to differentiate. The Somalis are  perhaps the first recognizable, with their finely chiselled,  intelligent, delicate brown features, their slender forms, and their  strikingly picturesque costumes of turbans, flowing robes, and  embroidered sleeveless jackets.

And this was all you had to bring me?    _Mephistopheles_. All but one weighty, grave request!  \"Bid her, when I am dead, three hundred masses sing me!\"  With this I have made a clean pocket and breast.    _Martha_. What! not a medal, pin nor stone?  Such as, for memory's sake, no journeyman will lack,  Saved in the bottom of his sack,  And sooner would hunger, be a pauper--    _Mephistopheles_. Madam, your case is hard, I own!  But blame him not, he squandered ne'er a copper.  He too bewailed his faults with penance sore,  Ay, and his wretched luck bemoaned a great deal more.    _Margaret_. Alas! that mortals so unhappy prove!  I surely will for him pray many a requiem duly.    _Mephistopheles_. You're worthy of a spouse this moment; truly  You are a child a man might love.    _Margaret_. It's not yet time for that, ah no!    _Mephistopheles_. If not a husband, say, meanwhile a beau.  It is a choice and heavenly blessing,  Such a dear thing to one's bosom pressing.    _Margaret_. With us the custom is not so.    _Mephistopheles_. Custom or not!  It happens, though.    _Martha_. Tell on!    _Mephistopheles_. I slood beside his bed, as he lay dying,  Better than dung it was somewhat,--  Half-rotten straw; but then, he died as Christian ought,  And found an unpaid score, on Heaven's account-book lying.  \"How must I hate myself,\" he cried, \"inhuman!  So to forsake my business and my woman!  Oh! the remembrance murders me!  Would she might still forgive me this side heaven!\"    _Martha_ [_weeping_]. The dear good man! he has been long forgiven.    _Mephistopheles_. \"But God knows, I was less to blame than she.\"    _Martha_. A lie! And at death's door! abominable!    _Mephistopheles_. If I to judge of men half-way am able,  He surely fibbed while passing hence.  \"Ways to kill time, (he said)--be sure, I did not need them;  First to get children--and then bread to feed them,  And bread, too, in the widest sense,  And even to eat my bit in peace could not be thought on.\"    _Martha_. Has he all faithfulness, all love, so far forgotten,  The drudgery by day and night!    _Mephistopheles_. Not so, he thought of you with all his might.  He said: \"When I from Malta went away,  For wife and children my warm prayers ascended;  And Heaven so far our cause befriended,  Our ship a Turkish cruiser took one day,  Which for the mighty Sultan bore a treasure.  Then valor got its well-earned pay,  And I too, who received but my just measure,  A goodly portion bore away.\"    _Martha_. How? Where? And he has left it somewhere buried?    _Mephistopheles_. Who knows which way by the four winds 'twas carried?  He chanced to take a pretty damsel's eye,  As, a strange sailor, he through Naples jaunted;  All that she did for him so tenderly,  E'en to his blessed end the poor man haunted.    _Martha_. The scamp! his children thus to plunder!  And could not all his troubles sore  Arrest his vile career, I wonder?    _Mephistopheles_. But mark! his death wipes off the score.  Were I in your place now, good lady;  One year I'd mourn him piously  And look about, meanwhiles, for a new flame already.    _Martha_. Ah, God! another such as he  I may not find with ease on this side heaven!  Few such kind fools as this dear spouse of mine.  Only to roving he was too much given,  And foreign women and foreign wine,  And that accursed game of dice.    _Mephistopheles_. Mere trifles these; you need not heed 'em,  If he, on his part, not o'er-nice,  Winked at, in you, an occasional freedom.  I swear, on that condition, too,  I would, myself, 'change rings with you!    _Martha_. The gentleman is pleased to jest now!    _Mephistopheles [aside_]. I see it's now high time I stirred!  She'd take the very devil at his word.        [_To_ MARGERY.]  How is it with your heart, my best, now?    _Margaret_. What means the gentleman?    _Mephistopheles. [aside_]. Thou innocent young heart!         [_Aloud_.]  Ladies, farewell!    _Margaret_. Farewell!    _Martha_. But quick, before we part!--  I'd like some witness, vouching truly  Where, how and when my love died and was buried duly.  I've always paid to order great attention,  Would of his death read some newspaper mention.    _Mephistopheles_. Ay, my dear lady, in the mouths of two  Good witnesses each word is true;  I've a friend, a fine fellow, who, when you desire,  Will render on oath what you require.  I'll bring him here.    _Martha_. O pray, sir, do!    _Mephistopheles_. And this young lady 'll be there too?  Fine boy! has travelled everywhere,  And all politeness to the fair.    _Margaret_. Before him shame my face must cover.    _Mephistopheles_. Before no king the wide world over!    _Martha_. Behind the house, in my garden, at leisure,  We'll wait this eve the gentlemen's pleasure.                STREET.          FAUST. MEPHISTOPHELES.    _Faust_. How now? What progress? Will 't come right?    _Mephistopheles_. Ha, bravo? So you're all on fire?  Full soon you'll see whom you desire.  In neighbor Martha's grounds we are to meet tonight.  That woman's one of nature's picking  For pandering and gipsy-tricking!    _Faust_. So far, so good!    _Mephistopheles_. But one thing we must do.    _Faust_. Well, one good turn deserves another, true.    _Mephistopheles_. We simply make a solemn deposition  That her lord's bones are laid in good condition  In holy ground at Padua, hid from view.    _Faust_. That's wise! But then we first must make the journey thither?    _Mephistopheles. Sancta simplicitas_! no need of such to-do;  Just swear, and ask not why or whether.    _Faust_. If that's the best you have, the plan's not worth a feather.    _Mephistopheles_. O holy man! now that's just you!  In all thy life hast never, to this hour,  To give false witness taken pains?  Have you of God, the world, and all that it contains,  Of man, and all that stirs within his heart and brains,  Not given definitions with great power,  Unscrupulous breast, unblushing brow?  And if you search the matter clearly,  Knew you as much thereof, to speak sincerely,  As of Herr Schwerdtlein's death? Confess it now!    _Faust_. Thou always wast a sophist and a liar.    _Mephistopheles_. Ay, if one did not look a little nigher.  For will you not, in honor, to-morrow  Befool poor Margery to her sorrow,  And all the oaths of true love borrow?    _Faust_. And from the heart, too.    _Mephistopheles_. Well and fair!  Then there'll be talk of truth unending,  Of love o'ermastering, all transcending--  Will every word be heart-born there?    _Faust_. Enough! It will!--If, for the passion  That fills and thrills my being's frame,  I find no name, no fit expression,  Then, through the world, with all my senses, ranging,  Seek what most strongly speaks the unchanging.  And call this glow, within me burning,  Infinite--endless--endless yearning,  Is that a devilish lying game?    _Mephistopheles_. I'm right, nathless!    _Faust_. Now, hark to me--  This once, I pray, and spare my lungs, old fellow--  Whoever _will_ be right, and has a tongue to bellow,  Is sure to be.  But come, enough of swaggering, let's be quit,  For thou art right, because I must submit.                GARDEN.          MARGARET _on_ FAUST'S _arm_. MARTHA _with_ MEPHISTOPHELES.            [_Promenading up and down_.]    _Margaret_. The gentleman but makes me more confused  With all his condescending goodness.  Men who have travelled wide are used  To bear with much from dread of rudeness;  I know too well, a man of so much mind  In my poor talk can little pleasure find.    _Faust_. One look from thee, one word, delights me more  Than this world's wisdom o'er and o'er.         [_Kisses her hand_.]    _Margaret_. Don't take that trouble, sir! How could you bear to kiss it?  A hand so ugly, coarse, and rough!  How much I've had to do! must I confess it--  Mother is more than close enough.         [_They pass on_.]    _Martha_. And you, sir, are you always travelling so?    _Mephistopheles_. Alas, that business forces us to do it!  With what regret from many a place we go,  Though tenderest bonds may bind us to it!    _Martha_. 'Twill do in youth's tumultuous maze  To wander round the world, a careless rover;  But soon will come the evil days,  And then, a lone dry stick, on the grave's brink to hover,  For that nobody ever prays.    _Mephistopheles_. The distant prospect shakes my reason.    _Martha_. Then, worthy sir, bethink yourself in season.        [_They pass on_.]    _Margaret_. Yes, out of sight and out of mind!  Politeness you find no hard matter;  But you have friends in plenty, better  Than I, more sensible, more refined.    _Faust_. Dear girl, what one calls sensible on earth,  Is often vanity and nonsense.    _Margaret_. How?    _Faust_. Ah, that the pure and simple never know  Aught of themselves and all their holy worth!  That meekness, lowliness, the highest measure  Of gifts by nature lavished, full and free--    _Margaret_. One little moment, only, think of me,  I shall to think of you have ample time and leisure.    _Faust_. You're, may be, much alone?    _Margaret_. Our household is but small, I own,  And yet needs care, if truth were known.  We have no maid; so I attend to cooking, sweeping,  Knit, sew, do every thing, in fact;  And mother, in all branches of housekeeping,  Is so exact!  Not that she need be tied so very closely down;  We might stand higher than some others, rather;  A nice estate was left us by my father,  A house and garden not far out of town.  Yet, after all, my life runs pretty quiet;  My brother is a soldier,  My little sister's dead;  With the dear child indeed a wearing life I led;  And yet with all its plagues again would gladly try it,  The child was such a pet.    _Faust_. An angel, if like thee!    _Margaret_. I reared her and she heartily loved me.  She and my father never saw each"]]]
