Diabelli  therefore coolly submitted to all this abuse of the enraged composer, and  wrote to him that he would note down the threatened bass aria, and publish  it, but would give him the usual gratuity for it, and that Beethoven had  better come to see him. On this Beethoven said no more. This Sonata is  dedicated to the Archduke Rudolph, and is also published by Schlesinger.]      326.    TO F. RIES,--LONDON.    Vienna, April 25, 1823.    DEAR RIES,--    The Cardinal's stay here of a month robbed me of a great deal of time,  being obliged to give him daily lessons of two or three hours each; and  after such lessons I was scarcely able next day to think, far less to  write. My continued melancholy situation compels me, however, to write  immediately what will bring me in sufficient money for present use. What a  sad revelation is this! I am, besides, far from well, owing to my many  troubles,--weak eyes among others.    But do not be uneasy, you shall shortly receive the Symphony; really and  truly, my distressing condition is alone to blame for the delay. In the  course of a few weeks you shall have thirty-three new variations on a theme  [Valse, Op. 120] dedicated to your wife.    Bauer [First Secretary to the Austrian Embassy] has the score of the  \"Battle of Vittoria,\" which was dedicated to the then Prince Regent, and  for which I have still to receive the costs of copying. I do beg you, my  dear friend, to remit me as soon as possible anything you can get for it.  With regard to your tender conjugal discussion, you will always find an  opponent in me,--that is, not so much an opponent of yours as a partisan of  your wife's. I remain, as ever, your friend,    BEETHOVEN.      327.    TO HERR LISSNER,--PETERSBURG.    Vienna, May 7, 1823.    SIR,--    Herr v. Schuppanzigh assured me, when he was here, that you were anxious to  acquire some of my productions for your house. Perhaps the following works  might suit your purpose, namely: six _bagatelles_ for pianoforte, 20 gold  ducats; thirty-five variations on a favorite theme for pianoforte, forming  one entire work, 30 gold ducats; two grand airs with chorus, the poetry by  Goethe and Matthisson, which can be sung either with instrumental or  pianoforte accompaniment, 12 gold ducats.    I request an answer as soon as possible, for others also wish to have my  works.    I am, sir, your obedient    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.      328.[1]    TO SCHINDLER.    Hetzendorf, 1823.    SAMOTHRACIAN VAGABOND!--[2]    You must hunt out from Schlemmer [the copyist] what is still wanting in the  \"Kyrie;\" show him the postscript, and so, _satis_, no more of such a  wretch! Farewell! arrange everything; I am to bind up my eyes at night, and  to spare them as much as possible; otherwise, says Smetana, I shall write  little more music in the time to come.    [Footnote 1: \"We arrived at Hetzendorf on May 17\" is written by Carl in  Beethoven's note-book of 1823; and on this note is written, in the  \"scamp's\" hand, Hetzendorf, 1823.]    [Footnote 2: \"By the word 'Samothracian,' Beethoven alludes to the  Samothracian Mysteries, partly grounded on music. Their mutual  participation in the Beethoven Mysteries is intended to be thus indicated.  Among the initiated were also Brunswick, Lichnowsky, and Zmeskall.\" [From a  note of Schindler's on the subject.]]      329.    TO SCHINDLER.    Hetzendorf, 1823 (?).    Pray, forward the packet to-day, and inquire this afternoon, if possible,  about the housekeeper in the Glockengasse, No. 318, 3d Etage. She is a  widow, understands cookery, and is willing to serve merely for board and  lodging, to which, of course, I cannot consent, or only under certain  conditions. My present one is too shameful. I cannot invite you here, but  be assured of my gratitude.      330.    TO SCHINDLER.[1]    Hetzendorf, 1823.    I enclose the letter to Herr v. Obreskow [Charge d'Affaires of the Russian  Legation]; as soon as I receive the money, I will immediately send you 50  florins for your trouble. Not a word more than what is absolutely  necessary!    I have advertised your house. You can mention, merely as a casual remark at  the right moment, that France also remitted the money to you.    Never forget that such persons represent Majesty itself.    [Footnote 1: Louis VIII. sent a gold medal for his subscription copy of the  Mass on February 20, 1824.]      331.    TO SCHINDLER.    I beg you will kindly write out the enclosed invitation neatly for me on  the paper I send you, for Carl has too much to do. I wish to dispatch it  early on Wednesday. I want to know where Grillparzer lives; perhaps I may  pay him a visit myself.[1] You must have a little patience about the 50  florins; as yet it is impossible for me to send them, for which you are as  much to blame as I am.    [Footnote 1: It is well known that in the winter of 1822-23 Beethoven was  engaged in the composition of an opera for the Royal Theatre; for which  purpose Grillparzer had given him his _Melusina_.]      332.    TO SCHINDLER.    I send K.'s [Kanne's] book [libretto]. Except the first act, which is  rather insipid, it is written in such a masterly style that it does not by  any means require a first-rate composer. I will not say that on this very  account it would be the more suitable for me; still, if I can get rid of  previous engagements, who knows what may or will happen! Please acknowledge  the receipt of this.      333.    TO SCHINDLER.    I wish to know about Esterhazy, and also about the post. A letter-carrier  from the Mauer [a place near Hetzendorf] was here; I only hope the message  has been properly delivered. Nothing as yet from Dresden [see No. 330]. I  mean to ask you to dine with me a few days hence, for I still suffer from  my weak eyes; to-day, however, for the first time, they seem to improve,  but I scarcely dare make any use of them as yet.    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.    P.S. As for the Tokay,[1] it is better adapted for _summer_ than for  _autumn_, and also for some fiddler who could _respond_ to its noble fire,  and yet _stand firm as a rock_.    [Footnote 1: A musical friend had sent the _maestro_ six bottles of genuine  Tokay, expressing his wish that it might tend to restore his strength.  Schindler, he says, wrote to Beethoven at Hetzendorf, to tell him of this,  and received the above answer, and the order through \"Frau Schnaps\" to do  as he pleased with the wine. He sent one bottle of it to Hetzendorf, but  Beethoven at that time had inflamed eyes.]      334.    TO SCHINDLER.    I cannot at present accept these tempting invitations [from Sonntag and  Unger]; so far as my weak eyes permit, I am very busy, and when it is fine,  I go out. I will myself thank these two fair ladies for their amiability.  No tidings from Dresden. I shall wait till the end of this month, and then  apply to a lawyer in Dresden. I will write about Schoberlechner to-morrow.      335.    TO SCHINDLER.    June 18, 1823.    You ought to have perfectly well known that I would have nothing to do with  the affair in question. With regard to my being \"liberal,\" I think I have  shown you that I am so on principle; indeed, I suspect you must have  observed that I even have gone _beyond_ these principles. _Sapienti  sat._[1]    [Footnote 1: Franz Schoberlechner, pianist in Vienna, wrote to Beethoven on  June 25, 1823, to ask him for letters of introduction to Leipzig, Dresden,  Berlin, and Russia, etc. The _maestro_, however, wrote across the letter,  \"An active fellow requires no other recommendation than from one  respectable family to another,\" and gave it back to Schindler, who showed  it to Schoberlechner, and no doubt at his desire urged Beethoven to comply  with his request. Beethoven, however, did not know Schoberlechner, and had  no very high opinion of him, as he played chiefly _bravura_ pieces, and,  besides, on the bills of his concerts, he pompously paraded all his titles,  decorations, and as member of various societies, which gave ample subject  for many a sarcastic remark on the part of Beethoven.]      336.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Vienna, June 1, 1823.    I have been always ailing since Y.R.H. left this, and latterly afflicted by  severe inflammation of the eyes, which has now in so far subsided that for  the last eight days I have been able once more to use my sight, though very  sparingly. Y.R.H. will perceive from the enclosed receipt of June 27, the  dispatch of some music. As Y.R.H. seemed to take pleasure in the C minor  Sonata,[1] I thought I did not take too much on myself by surprising Y.R.H.  with the dedication. The Variations[2] have been written out for at least  five or six weeks past, but the state of my eyes did not permit me to  revise them thoroughly myself. My hope of being entirely restored proved  vain. At last I made Schlemmer look them over, so, though they may not look  very neat, still they are correct. The C minor Sonata was engraved in Paris  in a very faulty manner, and being engraved here from that copy, I tried to  make it as correct as possible. I intend shortly to send you a beautifully  engraved copy of the Variations. With regard to the Mass[3] that Y.R.H.  wished should be more generally known, my continued bad health for some  years past, causing me to incur heavy debts, and compelling me to give up  my intention of going to England, induced me to ponder on some mode of  improving my condition. This Mass seemed well adapted to my purpose. I was  advised to offer it to different courts. Painful as this was to me, I felt  that I should have cause for self-re"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13291"],[0,"The World's Great Men of Music: Story-Lives of Master Musicians (#15)"],[1,"playing. As a conductor  he made many movements, and is said to have crouched below the desk in  soft passages; in Crescendos he would gradually lift himself up  until at the loudest parts he would rise to his full height with arms  extended, even springing into the air, as though he would float in  space.    Beethoven as a teacher, showed none of the impatience and carelessness  that were seen in his personal habits. He insisted on a pupil  repeating the passage carefully a number of times, until it could be  played to his satisfaction. He did not seem to mind a few wrong notes,  but the pupil must not fail to grasp the meaning or put in the right  expression, or his anger would be aroused. The first was an accident,  the other would be a lack of knowledge of feeling.    Beethoven loved nature as much or more than any musician ever did. How  he hailed the spring because he knew the time would soon come when he  could close the door of his lodgings in the hot city, and slip away to  some quiet spot and hold sweet communion with nature. A forest was a  paradise, where he could ramble among the trees and dream. Or he  would select a tree where a forking branch would form a seat near the  ground. He would climb up and sit in it for hours, lost in thought.  Leaning against the trunk of a lime tree, his eyes fixed upon the  network of leaves and branches above him, he sketched the plan of his  oratorio \"The Mount of Olives\"; also that of his one opera \"Fidelio,\"  and the third Symphony, known as the \"Eroica.\" He wrote to a friend,  \"No man loves the country more than I. Woods, trees and rocks give the  response which man requires. Every tree seems to say 'Holy, holy.'\"    Already, as a young man, symptoms of deafness began to appear, and  the fear of becoming a victim of this malady made the composer more  sensitive than ever. He was not yet thirty when this happened, and  believing his life work at an end, he became deeply depressed. Various  treatments were tried for increasing deafness; at one time it seemed  to be cured by the skill of Dr. Schmidt, to whom out of gratitude he  dedicated his Septet, arranged as a Trio. By his advice the composer  went for the summer of 1820 to the little village of Heiligenstadt  (which means Holy City) in the hope that the calm, sweet environment  would act as a balm to his troubled mind. During this period of rest  and quiet his health improved somewhat, but from now on he had to give  up conducting his works, on account of his deafness.    It may be thought that one so reticent and retiring, of such hasty  temper and brusque manners, would scarcely be attracted to women.  But Beethoven, it is said, was very susceptible to the charm of the  opposite sex. He was however, most careful and high-souled in all his  relations with women. He was frequently in love, but it was usually a  Platonic affection. For the Countess Julie Guicciardi he protested  the most passionate love, which was in a measure returned. She was  doubtless his \"immortal beloved,\" whose name vibrates through the  Adagio of the \"Moonlight Sonata,\" which is dedicated to her. He wrote  her the most adoring letters; but the union, which he seemed to desire  so intensely, was never brought about, though the reason is not known.  For Bettina von Arnim, Goethe's little friend, he conceived a tender  affection. Another love of his was for the Countess Marie Erdoedy,  to whom he dedicated the two fine Trios, Op. 70, but this was also  a purely Platonic affection. The composer was unfortunate in his  attachments, for the objects were always of a much higher social  standing than himself. As he constantly associated with people of rank  and culture, it was natural that the young girl nobly born, with all  the fascinations of the high bred aristocrat, should attract him far  more than the ordinary woman of his own class. And thus it happened  that several times he staked his chances of happiness on a love he  knew could never be consummated. Yet no one needed a kind, helpful,  sympathetic wife more than did our poet-musician. She would have  soothed his sensitive soul when he suffered from fancied wrongs,  shielded him from intrusion, shared his sorrows and triumphs, and  attended to his house-keeping arrangements, which were always in a sad  state of confusion. This blissful state was seemingly not for him. It  was best for the great genius to devote himself wholly to his divine  art, and to create those masterpieces which will always endure.    In 1804 Beethoven completed one of his greatest symphonies, the  \"Eroica.\" He made a sketch, as we have seen, two years before. He had  intended it to honor Napoleon, to whose character and career he was  greatly attracted. But when Napoleon entered Paris in triumph and was  proclaimed Emperor, Beethoven's worship was turned to contempt. He  seized the symphony, tore the little page to shreds and flung the work  to the other end of the room. It was a long time before he would look  at the music again, but finally, he consented to publish it under the  title by which it is now known.    When we consider the number and greatness of Beethoven's compositions  we stand aghast at the amount of labor he accomplished. \"I live only  in my music,\" he wrote, \"and no sooner is one thing done than the next  is begun. I often work at two or three things at once.\" Music was his  language of expression, and through his music we can reach his heart  and know the man as he really was. At heart he was a man capable of  loving deeply and most worthy to be loved.    Of the composer's two brothers, one had passed away and had left his  boy Carl, named after himself, as a solemn charge, to be brought up by  Uncle Ludwig as his own son. The composer took up this task generously  and unselfishly. He was happy to have the little lad near him, one of  his own kin to love. But as Carl grew to young manhood he proved to  be utterly unworthy of all this affection. He treated his good uncle  shamefully, stole money from him, though he had been always generously  supplied with it, and became a disgrace to the family. There is no  doubt that his nephew's dissolute habits saddened the master's life,  estranged him from his friends and hastened his death.    How simple and modest was this great master, in face of his mighty  achievements! He wrote to a friend in 1824: \"I feel as if I had  scarcely written more than a few notes.\" These later years had been  more than full of work and anxiety. Totally deaf, entirely thrown in  upon himself, often weak and ill, the master kept on creating work  after work of the highest beauty and grandeur.    Ludwig van Beethoven passed from this plane March 26, 1827, having  recently completed his fifty-sixth year, and was laid to rest in the  Waehring Cemetery near Vienna. Unlike Mozart, he was buried with much  honor. Twenty thousand people followed him to his grave. Among them  was Schubert, who had visited him on his deathbed, and was one of the  torch bearers. Several of the Master's compositions were sung by a  choir of male voices, accompanied by trombones. At the grave Hummel  laid three laurel wreaths on the casket.          VIII    CARL MARIA VON WEBER      As we have already seen in the life stories of a number of musicians,  the career they were to follow was often decided by the father, who  determined to form them into wonder children, either for monetary gain  or for the honor and glory of the family. The subject of this story is  an example of such a preconceived plan.    Franz Anton von Weber, who was a capable musician himself, had always  cherished the desire to give a wonder child to the world. In his  idea wonder children need not be born such, they could be made by the  proper care and training. He had been a wealthy man, but at the time  of our story, was in reduced circumstances, and was traveling about  Saxony at the head of a troupe of theatrical folk, called \"Weber's  Company of Comedians.\"    Little Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst, to give his full name, was born  December 18, 1786, at Eutin, a little town in Lower Saxony. He was the  first child of a second marriage, and before the baby boy could  speak, his career had been planned; the father had made up his mind  to develop his son into an extraordinary musical genius. It is not  recorded what his young mother, a delicate girl of seventeen, thought  about it; probably her ideas for her baby son did not enter into the  father's plan. Mother and child were obliged to follow in the train  of the wandering comedians, so baby Carl was brought up amid the  properties of stage business. Scenery, canvas, paints and stage lights  were the materials upon which Carl's imagination was fed. He learned  stage language with his earliest breath; it is no wonder he turned to  writing for the stage as to the manner born.    As a child he was neither robust nor even healthy, which is not  surprising, since he was not allowed to run afield with other  children, enjoying the sweet air of nature, the flowers, the sunshine  and blue sky. No, he must stay indoors much of the time and find his  playmates among cardboard castles and painted canvas streets. This  treatment was not conducive to rosy cheeks and strong, sturdy little  legs. Then, before the delicate child was six years old, a violin was  put into his hand, and if his progress on it was thought to be too  slow by his impatient father, he was treated to raps and blows by way  of incentive to work yet harder. His teachers, too, were continually  changing, as the comedians had to travel about from place to place.  After awhile he was taken in hand by Michael Haydn, a brother of the  great Josef. Michael was a famous musician himself and seldom gave  lessons to any one. But he was interested in Carl and took charge of  his musical education for some time.    It was not long before Carl Maria's genius began definitely to show  itself, for he started to write for the lyric"]]]
