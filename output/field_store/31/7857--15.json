The  literary critics, East as well as West, whose views and pretensions  Field had so often lampooned mercilessly, had their innings, and as  Field had not then conquered the popular heart with his \"Little Boy  Blue,\" his matchless lullabies, and his fascinating fairy tales and  other stories, \"Culture's Garland\" was left to cumber the shelves of  the book-stores. Several of the articles and poems in this book have  been included in the collected edition of Field's works. In it will be  found Field's famous \"Markessy di Pullman\" papers, with these clever  introductory imitations:      _\"Il bianco di cazerni della graze fio bella    Di teruca si mazzoni quel' antisla Somno della.\"                                     --Petrarch.      \"He who conduces to a fellow's sleep    Should noble fame and goodly riches reap.\"                                     --Tasso.      \"Sleep mocks at death: when weary of the earth    We do not die--we take an upper berth.\"                                     --Dante._    There, too, are reprinted the verses he composed and credited to Judge  Cooley, to which allusion has already been made in these pages, and of  which Field wrote to his friend Cowen the week they were published: \"I  think they will create somewhat of a sensation; I have put a good deal  of work upon them.\" All the pieces of verse read by Field at the  Indianapolis convention also appear in \"Culture's Garland,\" three of  them being included in the article on \"Mr. Isaac Watts, Tutor,\" of  which \"The Merciful Lad\" was one of Field's favorites:      _THE MERCIFUL LAD      Through all my life the poor shall find      In me a constant friend,    And on the weak of every kind      My mercy shall attend.      The dumb shall never call on me      In vain for kindly aid,    And in my hands the blind shall see      A bounteous alms display'd.      In all their walks the lame shall know      And feel my goodness near,    And on the deaf will I bestow      My gentlest words of cheer.      'Tis by such pious works as these--      Which I delight to do--    That men their fellow-creatures please,      And please their Maker, too._    Field was immensely tickled with the British gravity of one of his  critics, who ridiculed this imitation of Dr. Watts, because, forsooth,  he could not comprehend how the dumb could call, the blind see, or the  lame walk, while he wanted to know what gracious effect the gentlest  words could produce on the ears of the deaf.    Throughout \"Culture's Garland\" Field is the unsparing satirist of  contemporary humbug and pretence--social, political, and literary--and  that perhaps accounts for its failure to achieve an immediate popular  success. I, for one, am glad that so late as December, 1893, and after  he had tasted the sweets of popular applause, with its attendant  royalties, he had the courage to write of it to a friend in Boston, \"I  am not ashamed of this little book, but, like the boy with the  measles, I am sorry for it in spots.\"    \"Culture's Garland\" really cleared the way for Field's subsequent  literary success. It taught him the lesson that his average daily  newspaper work had not body enough to fill out the covers of a book.  With grim determination he set himself the task to master the art of  telling stories in prose. He was absolutely confident of himself in  verse, but to his dying day he was never quite satisfied with anything  he wrote in prose. His poems went to the printer almost exactly as  they were originally composed. Nearly all of his tales were written  over and over again with fastidious pains before they were committed  to type. Every word and sentence of such stories as \"The Robin and the  Violet,\" \"The First Christmas Tree,\" \"Margaret, a Pearl,\" and \"The  Mountain and the Sea\" was scrutinized and weighed by his keen literary  sense and discriminating ear before it was permitted to pass final  muster. In only one instance do I remember that this extreme care  failed to improve the original story. \"The Werewolf\" (\"Second Book of  Tales\") was a more powerful and moving fancy as first written than as  eventually printed. He consulted with me during four revisions of \"The  Werewolf,\" and told me that he had written the whole thing over seven  times. I never knew him so finicky and beset with doubts as to the use  of words and phrases as he was in this instance. The result is a  marvellous piece of technicality perfect archaic old English mosaic,  with the soul--the fascinating shudder--refined, out of a weird and  fearful tale.    But all the care, study, and exercise Field put upon his prose stories  bore fruit in the gradual improvement in tone and style of his daily  composition. His study of old English ballads started him about this  time on the production of a truly remarkable series of lullabies,  while his work began to show more and more the influence of Father  Prout. But the old Field continued to show itself in such occasional  quatrains as this:      _For there was Egypt in her eye--      The languor of the South--    Persia was in her perfumed sigh,      And Turkey in her mouth._    Along in January, 1889, began the frequent paraphrases from Horace.  \"Wynken, Blynken and Nod,\" over which Field expended more than the  usual pains he bestowed on his verse, was printed in March of the same  year. One day in April, in 1889, Field surprised and delighted the  readers of the News with the publication of the following amazing  array of verse in one issue: \"Our Two Opinions,\" Horace I, 4; Heine's  \"Love Song,\" Horace I, 20; Hugo's \"Pool in the Forest,\" Horace I, 5;  Beranger's \"Broken Fiddle,\" Horace I, 28; \"Chloe\"; Uhland's \"Three  Cavaliers,\" and Horace IV, 11.    It must not be imagined that this was the result of one day's or one  week's work. He had been preparing for it for months; and each piece  of versification was as perfect as he could make it. The amazement and  widely expressed admiration with which this broadside of verse was  received encouraged Field to a still greater _tour de force_, upon the  preparation of which he bent all his energies and spare time for more  than three months. What Field described in a letter to Cowen as \"The  'Golden Week' in my newspaper career,\" consisted in \"the paper running  a column of my (his) verse per diem--something never before attempted  in American journalism.\" The titles of the verse printed during the  \"Golden Week\" testify alike to his industry and versatility:      THE GOLDEN WEEK, JULY 15TH-20TH, 1889.      Monday, July 15, \"Prof. Vere de Blaw.\"      Tuesday, \"Horace to His Patron,\" \"Poet and    King,\" \"Alaskan Lullaby,\" \"Lizzie,\" \"Horace I,    30.\"      Wednesday, \"The Conversazzhyony.\"      Thursday, \"Egyptian Folk Song,\" Beranger's    \"To My Old Coat,\" \"Horace's Sailor and Shade,\"    \"Uhland's Chapel,\" \"Guess,\" \"Alaskan Balladry.\"      Friday, \"Marthy's Younkit,\" \"Fairy and Child,\"    \"A Heine Love Song,\" \"Jennie,\" \"Horace I, 27.\"      Saturday, \"The Happy Isles of Horace,\" Beranger's    \"Ma Vocation,\" \"Child and Mother,\" \"The    Bibliomaniac's Bride,\" \"Alaskan Balladry, No. 2,\"    \"Mediaeval Eventide Song.\"    Upon some of these now familiar poems Field had been at work for more  than a month. He read to me portions of \"Marthy's Younkit\" as early as  the spring of 1887. Among the letters which his guardian, Mr. Gray,  kindly placed at my disposal, I find the following bearing on \"The  Golden Week.\" It is written from the Benedict Farm, Genoa Junction,  Wis., some sixty miles from Chicago, to which Field had retired to  recuperate after having provided enough poetry in advance to fill his  column during the week of his absence:      DEAR MR. GRAY: I send herewith copies of poems which have appeared    in the Daily News this week. I am proud to have been the first    newspaper man to have made the record of a column of original verse    every day for a week; I am greatly mistaken if this feeling of    pardonable pride is not shared by you. I regard some of the poems as    my best work so far, but I shall do better yet if my life is spared.    We are rusticating here by the side of a Wisconsin lake this summer.    Farm board seems to agree with us and we shall in all likelihood    remain here until September. I have been grievously afflicted with    nervous dyspepsia for a month, but am much better just now. The    paper gives me a three months' European vacation whensoever I wish    to go. At present I intend to go in the winter and shall take Julia    and Mary (Trotty) with me. I do wish that Mrs. Gray would write to    me; I want to know all about her home affairs and especially about    Mrs. Bacon--my grudge against her _in re_ mince pie has expired    under the statute of limitations. God bless you, dear friend--you    and yours,      Affectionately,      EUGENE FIELD.    Although Field's body was rusticating on farm fare in Wisconsin, his  pen was furnishing its two thousand three hundred words a day to the  Daily News, as the \"Sharps and Flats\" column through the summer of  1889 shows. In a letter written from the Benedict Farm during the  Golden Week to Cowen, who was at this time in London working on the  English edition of the New York Herald, Field unfolds some of his  doings and plans:      The copies of the London Herald "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130"],[0,"Orthodoxy (#15)"],[1,"and co-operation, they were demonstrably right.  But they really were wrong, in so far as they suggested that men  had ever aimed at order or ethics directly by a conscious exchange  of interests.  Morality did not begin by one man saying to another,  \"I will not hit you if you do not hit me\"; there is no trace  of such a transaction.  There IS a trace of both men having said,  \"We must not hit each other in the holy place.\"  They gained their  morality by guarding their religion.  They did not cultivate courage.  They fought for the shrine, and found they had become courageous.  They did not cultivate cleanliness.  They purified themselves for  the altar, and found that they were clean.  The history of the Jews  is the only early document known to most Englishmen, and the facts can  be judged sufficiently from that.  The Ten Commandments which have been  found substantially common to mankind were merely military commands;  a code of regimental orders, issued to protect a certain ark across  a certain desert.  Anarchy was evil because it endangered the sanctity.  And only when they made a holy day for God did they find they had made  a holiday for men.         If it be granted that this primary devotion to a place or thing  is a source of creative energy, we can pass on to a very peculiar fact.  Let us reiterate for an instant that the only right optimism is a sort  of universal patriotism.  What is the matter with the pessimist?  I think it can be stated by saying that he is the cosmic anti-patriot.  And what is the matter with the anti-patriot? I think it can be stated,  without undue bitterness, by saying that he is the candid friend.  And what is the matter with the candid friend?  There we strike  the rock of real life and immutable human nature.         I venture to say that what is bad in the candid friend  is simply that he is not candid.  He is keeping something back--  his own gloomy pleasure in saying unpleasant things.  He has  a secret desire to hurt, not merely to help.  This is certainly,  I think, what makes a certain sort of anti-patriot irritating to  healthy citizens.  I do not speak (of course) of the anti-patriotism  which only irritates feverish stockbrokers and gushing actresses;  that is only patriotism speaking plainly.  A man who says that  no patriot should attack the Boer War until it is over is not  worth answering intelligently; he is saying that no good son  should warn his mother off a cliff until she has fallen over it.  But there is an anti-patriot who honestly angers honest men,  and the explanation of him is, I think, what I have suggested:  he is the uncandid candid friend; the man who says, \"I am sorry  to say we are ruined,\" and is not sorry at all.  And he may be said,  without rhetoric, to be a traitor; for he is using that ugly knowledge  which was allowed him to strengthen the army, to discourage people  from joining it.  Because he is allowed to be pessimistic as a  military adviser he is being pessimistic as a recruiting sergeant.  Just in the same way the pessimist (who is the cosmic anti-patriot)  uses the freedom that life allows to her counsellors to lure away  the people from her flag.  Granted that he states only facts, it is  still essential to know what are his emotions, what is his motive.  It may be that twelve hundred men in Tottenham are down with smallpox;  but we want to know whether this is stated by some great philosopher  who wants to curse the gods, or only by some common clergyman who wants  to help the men.         The evil of the pessimist is, then, not that he chastises gods  and men, but that he does not love what he chastises--he has not  this primary and supernatural loyalty to things.  What is the evil  of the man commonly called an optimist?  Obviously, it is felt  that the optimist, wishing to defend the honour of this world,  will defend the indefensible.  He is the jingo of the universe;  he will say, \"My cosmos, right or wrong.\"  He will be less inclined  to the reform of things; more inclined to a sort of front-bench  official answer to all attacks, soothing every one with assurances.  He will not wash the world, but whitewash the world.  All this  (which is true of a type of optimist) leads us to the one really  interesting point of psychology, which could not be explained  without it.         We say there must be a primal loyalty to life:  the only  question is, shall it be a natural or a supernatural loyalty?  If you like to put it so, shall it be a reasonable or an  unreasonable loyalty?  Now, the extraordinary thing is that the  bad optimism (the whitewashing, the weak defence of everything)  comes in with the reasonable optimism.  Rational optimism leads  to stagnation:  it is irrational optimism that leads to reform.  Let me explain by using once more the parallel of patriotism.  The man who is most likely to ruin the place he loves is exactly  the man who loves it with a reason.  The man who will improve  the place is the man who loves it without a reason.  If a man loves  some feature of Pimlico (which seems unlikely), he may find himself  defending that feature against Pimlico itself.  But if he simply loves  Pimlico itself, he may lay it waste and turn it into the New Jerusalem.  I do not deny that reform may be excessive; I only say that it is the  mystic patriot who reforms.  Mere jingo self-contentment is commonest  among those who have some pedantic reason for their patriotism.  The worst jingoes do not love England, but a theory of England.  If we love England for being an empire, we may overrate the success  with which we rule the Hindoos.  But if we love it only for being  a nation, we can face all events:  for it would be a nation even  if the Hindoos ruled us.  Thus also only those will permit their  patriotism to falsify history whose patriotism depends on history.  A man who loves England for being English will not mind how she arose.  But a man who loves England for being Anglo-Saxon may go against  all facts for his fancy.  He may end (like Carlyle and Freeman)  by maintaining that the Norman Conquest was a Saxon Conquest.  He may end in utter unreason--because he has a reason.  A man who  loves France for being military will palliate the army of 1870.  But a man who loves France for being France will improve the army  of 1870.  This is exactly what the French have done, and France is  a good instance of the working paradox.  Nowhere else is patriotism  more purely abstract and arbitrary; and nowhere else is reform more  drastic and sweeping.  The more transcendental is your patriotism,  the more practical are your politics.         Perhaps the most everyday instance of this point is in the case  of women; and their strange and strong loyalty.  Some stupid people  started the idea that because women obviously back up their own  people through everything, therefore women are blind and do not  see anything.  They can hardly have known any women.  The same women  who are ready to defend their men through thick and thin are (in  their personal intercourse with the man) almost morbidly lucid  about the thinness of his excuses or the thickness of his head.  A man's friend likes him but leaves him as he is:  his wife loves him  and is always trying to turn him into somebody else.  Women who are  utter mystics in their creed are utter cynics in their criticism.  Thackeray expressed this well when he made Pendennis' mother,  who worshipped her son as a god, yet assume that he would go wrong  as a man.  She underrated his virtue, though she overrated his value.  The devotee is entirely free to criticise; the fanatic can safely  be a sceptic.  Love is not blind; that is the last thing that it is.  Love is bound; and the more it is bound the less it is blind.         This at least had come to be my position about all that  was called optimism, pessimism, and improvement.  Before any  cosmic act of reform we must have a cosmic oath of allegiance.  A man must be interested in life, then he could be disinterested  in his views of it.  \"My son give me thy heart\"; the heart must  be fixed on the right thing:  the moment we have a fixed heart we  have a free hand.  I must pause to anticipate an obvious criticism.  It will be said that a rational person accepts the world as mixed  of good and evil with a decent satisfaction and a decent endurance.  But this is exactly the attitude which I maintain to be defective.  It is, I know, very common in this age; it was perfectly put in those  quiet lines of Matthew Arnold which are more piercingly blasphemous  than the shrieks of Schopenhauer--    \"Enough we live:--and if a life, With large results so little rife,  Though bearable, seem hardly worth This pomp of worlds, this pain  of birth.\"         I know this feeling fills our epoch, and I think it freezes  our epoch.  For our Titanic purposes of faith and revolution,  what we need is not the cold acceptance of the world as a compromise,  but some way in which we can heartily hate and heartily love it.  We do not want joy and anger to neutralize each other and produce a  surly contentment; we want a fiercer delight and a fiercer discontent.  We have to feel the universe at once as an ogre's castle,  to be stormed, and yet as our own cottage, to which we can return  at evening.         No one doubts that an ordinary man can get on with this world:  but we demand not strength enough to get on with it, but strength  enough to get it on.  Can he hate it enough to change it,  and yet love it enough to think it worth changing?  Can he look  up at its colossal good without once feeling acquiescence?  Can he look up at its colossal evil without once feeling despair?  Can he, in short, be at once not only a pessimist and an optimist,  but a fanatical pessimist and a fanatical optimist?  Is he enough of a  pagan to die for the world, and enough of a Christian to die to it?  In this combination, I maintain, it is the rational optimist who"]]]
