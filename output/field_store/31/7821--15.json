An eight-day clock with large  dial and plain case is the most suitable.    Every kitchen should also be provided with a slate, with sponge and  pencil attached, on one side of which the market orders and other  memoranda may be jotted down, and on the other the bills of fare for the  day or week. In households where servants are kept, the slate will save  many a vexatious blunder and unnecessary call to the kitchen, while if  one is herself mistress, cook, and housekeeper, it may prove an  invaluable aid and time-saver if thus used.    [Illustration: A Convenient Kitchen Table.]    Lack of sufficient table room is often a great source of inconvenience  to the housekeeper. To avoid this, arrange swinging tables or shelves at  convenient points upon the wall, which may be put up or let down as  occasion demands. For ordinary kitchen uses, small tables of suitable  height on easy-rolling casters, and with zinc tops, are the most  convenient and most easily kept clean. It is quite as well that they be  made without drawers, which are too apt to become receptacles for a  heterogeneous mass of rubbish. If desirable to have some handy place for  keeping articles which are frequently required for use, an arrangement  similar to that represented in the accompanying cut may be made at very  small expense. It may be also an advantage to arrange small shelves  about and above the range, on which may be kept various articles  necessary for cooking purposes.    One of the most indispensable articles of furnishing for a  well-appointed kitchen, is a sink; however, a sink must be properly  constructed and well cared for, or it is likely to become a source of  great danger to the health of the inmates of the household. Earthen-ware  is the best material for kitchen sinks. Iron is very serviceable, but  corrodes, and if painted or enameled, this soon wears off. Wood is  objectionable from a sanitary standpoint. A sink made of wood lined with  copper answers well for a long time if properly cared for.    The sink should if possible stand out from the wall, so as to allow free  access to all sides of it for the sake of cleanliness, and under no  circumstances should there be any inclosure of woodwork or cupboards  underneath to serve as a storage place for pots and kettles and all  kinds of rubbish, dust, and germs. It should be supported on legs, and  the space below should be open for inspection at all times. The pipes  and fixtures should be selected and placed by a competent plumber.    Great pains should be taken to keep the pipes clean and well  disinfected. Refuse of all kinds should be kept out. Thoughtless  housekeepers and careless domestics often allow greasy water and bits of  table waste to find their way into the pipes. Drain pipes usually have a  bend, or trap, through which water containing no sediment flows freely;  but the melted grease which often passes into the pipes mixed with hot  water, becomes cooled and solid as it descends, adhering to the pipes,  and gradually accumulating until the drain is blocked, or the water  passes through very slowly. A grease-lined pipe is a hotbed for disease  germs.    Water containing much grease should be cooled and the grease removed  before being turned into the kitchen sink, while bits of refuse should  be disposed of elsewhere, since prevention of mischief is in this case,  as in most others, far easier than cure. It is customary for  housekeepers to pour a hot solution of soda or potash down the sink  pipes occasionally, to dissolve any grease which may tend to obstruct  the passage; but this is only a partial safeguard, as there is no  certainty that all the grease will be dissolved, and any particles  adhering to the pipes very soon undergo putrefaction.    A frequent flushing with hot water is important; besides which the pipes  should be disinfected two or three times a week by pouring down a gallon  of water holding in solution a pound of good chloride of lime.    STOVES AND RANGES.--The furnishing of a modern kitchen would be  quite incomplete without some form of stove or range. The multiplicity  of these articles, manufactured each with some especial merit of its  own, renders it a somewhat difficult task to make a choice among them.  Much must, however, depend upon the kind of fuel to be used, the size of  the household, and various other circumstances which make it necessary  for each individual housekeeper to decide for herself what is best  adapted to her wants. It may be said, in brief, that economy of fuel,  simplicity of construction, and efficiency in use are the chief points  to be considered in the selection of stoves and ranges.    A stove or range of plain finish is to be preferred, because it is much  easier to keep clean, and will be likely to present a better appearance  after a few months' wear than one of more elaborate pattern. But  whatever stove or range is selected, its mechanism should be thoroughly  understood in every particular, and it should be tested with dampers  open, with dampers closed, and in every possible way, until one is  perfectly sure she understands its action under all conditions.    OIL AND GAS STOVES.--In many households, oil, gas, and gasoline  stoves have largely taken the place of the kitchen range, especially  during the hot weather of summer. They can be used for nearly every  purpose for which a wood or a coal range is used; they require much less  labor and litter, and can be instantly started into full force and as  quickly turned out when no longer required, while the fact that the heat  can be regulated with exactness, makes them superior for certain  processes of cooking to any other stove. But while these stoves are  convenient and economical, especially in small families, they should be  used with much care. Aside from the danger from explosion, which is by  no means inconsiderable in the use of gasoline and oil stoves, they are  not, unless well cared for altogether healthful. Unless the precaution  is taken to use them in well-ventilated rooms or to connect them with a  chimney, they vitiate the atmosphere to a considerable extent with the  products of combustion. Oil stoves, unless the wicks are kept well  trimmed, are apt to smoke, and this smoke is not only disagreeable, but  extremely irritating to the mucous membrane of the nose and throat. Oil  stoves are constructed on the same principle as ordinary oil lamps, and  require the same care and attention.    Quite recently there has been invented by Prof. Edward Atkinson a very  unique apparatus for cooking by means of the heat of an ordinary  kerosene lamp, called the \"Aladdin Cooker.\" The food to be cooked is  placed in a chamber around which hot water, heated by the flame of the  lamp, circulates. The uniform heat thus obtained performs the process of  cooking, slowly, but most satisfactorily and economically, the result  being far superior to that obtained by the ordinary method of cooking by  quick heat. The cooker is only used for stewing and steaming; but Mr.  Atkinson has also invented an oven in which the heat is conveyed to the  place where it is needed by a column of hot air instead of hot water.  With this oven, which consists of an outer oven made of non-conducting  material, and an inner oven made of sheet iron, with an intervening  space between, through which the hot air circulates, no smoke or odor  from the lamp can reach the interior.    KITCHEN. UTENSILS.--The list of necessary kitchen utensils must of  course be governed somewhat by individual circumstances, but it should  not be curtailed for the sake of display in some other department, where  less depends upon the results. A good kitchen outfit is one of the  foundation-stones of good housekeeping. The following are some of the  most essential:--    Two dish pans; two or more _papier-mache_ tubs for washing glassware;  one kneading board; one bread board; one pair scales, with weights;  scrubbing and stove brushes; brooms; dustpans; roller for towel;  washbowl; soap dish; vegetable brushes.    [Illustration: A Double Boiler.]    FOR THE TIN CLOSET.-One dipper; one egg-beater; one two-quart pail;  one four-quart pail; six brick-loaf bread pans; three shallow tins;  three granite-ware pie tins; two perforated sheet iron pans for rolls,  etc.; one set of measures, pint, quart, and two quart; two colanders;  two fine wire strainers; one flour sifter; one apple corer; one set  patty pans; two dripping pans; two sets gem irons; one set muffin rings;  one toaster; one broiler; the six saucepans, different sizes; two  steamers; six milk-pans; one dozen basins, different sizes; one chopping  bowl and knife; six double boilers; two funnels, large and small; one  can opener; griddle; kettles, iron and granite ware; two water baths.    FOR THE DISH CLOSET.--One half dozen iron-stone china cups; three  quart bowls; three pint bowls; two large mixing bowls; two quart bowls  with lip; six deep plates; three kitchen pitchers; one glass rolling  pin; six wooden and six iron spoons, assorted sizes; six kitchen  teaspoons; one stone baking pot; glass jars for stores; crocks and jars.    THE PANTRY.--The pantry and china closet should have direct light  and good ventilation. The dark, dingy places sometimes used for this  purpose are germ breeders. There should be plenty of shelf room and  cupboards for the fine glass and china-ware, with a well-arranged sink  for washing the dishes. The sink for this purpose is preferably one  lined with tinned or planished copper; for dishes will be less liable to  become injured and broken then when washed in an iron or earthen-ware  sink. Extension or folding shelves are a great convenience, and can be  arranged for the sink if desired. The accompanying cuts illustrate a  sink of four compartments for dish-washing, devised by the writer for  use in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#15)"],[1,"was;    Respect the grayest pile  For the departed creature's sake    That hovered there awhile.    Fire exists the first in light,    And then consolidates, --  Only the chemist can disclose    Into what carbonates.            XXXI.    A MAN.    Fate slew him, but he did not drop;    She felled -- he did not fall --  Impaled him on her fiercest stakes --    He neutralized them all.    She stung him, sapped his firm advance,    But, when her worst was done,  And he, unmoved, regarded her,    Acknowledged him a man.            XXXII.    VENTURES.    Finite to fail, but infinite to venture.    For the one ship that struts the shore  Many's the gallant, overwhelmed creature    Nodding in navies nevermore.            XXXIII.    GRIEFS.    I measure every grief I meet    With analytic eyes;  I wonder if it weighs like mine,    Or has an easier size.    I wonder if they bore it long,    Or did it just begin?  I could not tell the date of mine,    It feels so old a pain.    I wonder if it hurts to live,    And if they have to try,  And whether, could they choose between,    They would not rather die.    I wonder if when years have piled --    Some thousands -- on the cause  Of early hurt, if such a lapse    Could give them any pause;    Or would they go on aching still    Through centuries above,  Enlightened to a larger pain    By contrast with the love.    The grieved are many, I am told;    The reason deeper lies, --  Death is but one and comes but once,    And only nails the eyes.    There's grief of want, and grief of cold, --    A sort they call 'despair;'  There's banishment from native eyes,    In sight of native air.    And though I may not guess the kind    Correctly, yet to me  A piercing comfort it affords    In passing Calvary,    To note the fashions of the cross,    Of those that stand alone,  Still fascinated to presume    That some are like my own.            XXXIV.    I have a king who does not speak;  So, wondering, thro' the hours meek    I trudge the day away,--  Half glad when it is night and sleep,  If, haply, thro' a dream to peep    In parlors shut by day.    And if I do, when morning comes,  It is as if a hundred drums    Did round my pillow roll,  And shouts fill all my childish sky,  And bells keep saying 'victory'    From steeples in my soul!    And if I don't, the little Bird  Within the Orchard is not heard,    And I omit to pray,  'Father, thy will be done' to-day,  For my will goes the other way,    And it were perjury!            XXXV.    DISENCHANTMENT.    It dropped so low in my regard    I heard it hit the ground,  And go to pieces on the stones    At bottom of my mind;    Yet blamed the fate that fractured, less    Than I reviled myself  For entertaining plated wares    Upon my silver shelf.            XXXVI.    LOST FAITH.    To lose one's faith surpasses    The loss of an estate,  Because estates can be    Replenished, -- faith cannot.    Inherited with life,    Belief but once can be;  Annihilate a single clause,    And Being's beggary.            XXXVII.    LOST JOY.    I had a daily bliss    I half indifferent viewed,  Till sudden I perceived it stir, --    It grew as I pursued,    Till when, around a crag,    It wasted from my sight,  Enlarged beyond my utmost scope,    I learned its sweetness right.            XXXVIII.    I worked for chaff, and earning wheat    Was haughty and betrayed.  What right had fields to arbitrate    In matters ratified?    I tasted wheat, -- and hated chaff,    And thanked the ample friend;  Wisdom is more becoming viewed    At distance than at hand.            XXXIX.    Life, and Death, and Giants    Such as these, are still.  Minor apparatus, hopper of the mill,  Beetle at the candle,    Or a fife's small fame,  Maintain by accident    That they proclaim.            XL.    ALPINE GLOW.    Our lives are Swiss, --    So still, so cool,    Till, some odd afternoon,  The Alps neglect their curtains,    And we look farther on.    Italy stands the other side,    While, like a guard between,  The solemn Alps,  The siren Alps,    Forever intervene!            XLI.    REMEMBRANCE.    Remembrance has a rear and front, --    'T is something like a house;  It has a garret also    For refuse and the mouse,    Besides, the deepest cellar    That ever mason hewed;  Look to it, by its fathoms    Ourselves be not pursued.            XLII.    To hang our head ostensibly,    And subsequent to find  That such was not the posture    Of our immortal mind,    Affords the sly presumption    That, in so dense a fuzz,  You, too, take cobweb attitudes    Upon a plane of gauze!            XLIII.    THE BRAIN.    The brain is wider than the sky,    For, put them side by side,  The one the other will include    With ease, and you beside.    The brain is deeper than the sea,    For, hold them, blue to blue,  The one the other will absorb,    As sponges, buckets do.    The brain is just the weight of God,    For, lift them, pound for pound,  And they will differ, if they do,    As syllable from sound.            XLIV.    The bone that has no marrow;    What ultimate for that?  It is not fit for table,    For beggar, or for cat.    A bone has obligations,    A being has the same;  A marrowless assembly    Is culpabler than shame.    But how shall finished creatures    A function fresh obtain? --  Old Nicodemus' phantom    Confronting us again!            XLV.    THE PAST.    The past is such a curious creature,    To look her in the face  A transport may reward us,    Or a disgrace.    Unarmed if any meet her,    I charge him, fly!  Her rusty ammunition    Might yet reply!            XLVI.    To help our bleaker parts    Salubrious hours are given,  Which if they do not fit for earth    Drill silently for heaven.            XLVII.    What soft, cherubic creatures    These gentlewomen are!  One would as soon assault a plush    Or violate a star.    Such dimity convictions,    A horror so refined  Of freckled human nature,    Of Deity ashamed, --    It's such a common glory,    A fisherman's degree!  Redemption, brittle lady,    Be so, ashamed of thee.            XLVIII.    DESIRE.    Who never wanted, -- maddest joy    Remains to him unknown:  The banquet of abstemiousness    Surpasses that of wine.    Within its hope, though yet ungrasped    Desire's perfect goal,  No nearer, lest reality    Should disenthrall thy soul.            XLIX.    PHILOSOPHY.    It might be easier    To fail with land in sight,  Than gain my blue peninsula    To perish of delight.            L.    POWER.    You cannot put a fire out;    A thing that can ignite  Can go, itself, without a fan    Upon the slowest night.    You cannot fold a flood    And put it in a drawer, --  Because the winds would find it out,    And tell your cedar floor.            LI.    A modest lot, a fame petite,    A brief campaign of sting and sweet    Is plenty! Is enough!  A sailor's business is the shore,    A soldier's -- balls. Who asketh more  Must seek the neighboring life!            LII.    Is bliss, then, such abyss  I must not put my foot amiss  For fear I spoil my shoe?    I'd rather suit my foot  Than save my boot,  For yet to buy another pair  Is possible  At any fair.    But bliss is sold just once;  The patent lost  None buy it any more.            LIII.    EXPERIENCE.    I stepped from plank to plank    So slow and cautiously;  The stars about my head I felt,    About my feet the sea.    I knew not but the next    Would be my final inch, --  This gave me that precarious gait    Some call experience.            LIV.    THANKSGIVING DAY.    One day is there of the series    Termed Thanksgiving day,  Celebrated part at table,    Part in memory.    Neither patriarch nor pussy,    I dissect the play;  Seems it, to my hooded thinking,    Reflex holiday.    Had there been no sharp subtraction    From the early sum,  Not an acre or a caption    Where was once a room,    Not a mention, whose small pebble    Wrinkled any bay, --  Unto such, were such assembly,    'T were Thanksgiving day.            LV.    CHILDISH GRIEFS.    Softened by Time's consummate plush,    How sleek the woe appears  That threatened childhood's citadel    And undermined the years!    Bisected now by bleaker griefs,    We envy the despair  That devastated childhood's realm,    So easy to repair.              II. LOVE.      I.    CONSECRATION.    Proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it,    Proud of the pain I did not feel till thee,  Proud of my night since thou with moons dost slake it,    Not to partake thy passion, my humility.            II.    LOVE'S HUMILITY.    My worthiness is all my doubt,    His merit all my fear,  Contrasting which, my qualities    Do lowlier appear;    Lest I should insufficient prove    For his beloved need,  The chiefest apprehension    Within my loving creed.    So I, the undivine abode    Of his elect content,  Conform my soul as 't were a church    Unto her sacrament.            III.    LOVE.    Love is anterior to life,    Posterior to death,  Initial of creation, and    The exponent of breath.            IV.    SATISFIED.    One blessing had I, than the rest    So larger to my eyes  That I stopped gauging, satisfied,    For this enchanted size.    It was the limit of my dream,    The focus of my prayer, --  A perfect, paralyzing bliss    Contented as despair.    I knew no more of want or cold,    Phantasms both become,  For this new value in the soul,    Supremest earthly sum.    The heaven below the heaven above    Obscured with ruddier hue.  Life's latitude leant over-full;    The judgment perished, too.    Why joys so scantily disburse,    Why Paradise defer,  Why floods are served to us in bowls, --    I speculate no more.            V.    WITH A FLOWER.    When roses cease to bloom, dear,    And violets are done,  When bumble-bees in solemn flight    Have passed beyond the sun,    The hand that paused to gather    Upon this summer's day  Will idle lie, in Auburn, --    Then take my flower, "]]]
