Those who desire to assist in the uplifting of humanity cannot afford  to be silent and to allow judgment to go against them by default.  Courage they will need; for a charge of indecency is sure to be  levelled against them by the indecent, and they may be misjudged even  by the pure.    This is not the place in which so delicate a matter can be fully  discussed, nor does space permit; but if the movement towards sex  instruction is not to be stultified by the very ideas which evidence  the need for it, the subject cannot be wholly ignored here, and I  venture to throw out a few suggestions.    Are we indeed to believe that the noblest and most spiritual of men  will compromise themselves in the eyes of the woman they love best,  and whose respect they most desire, by committing in her presence and  making her the instrument of an indelicate act? A great poet, who  remained an ardent lover and a devoted companion until his wife died  in his arms--blissfully happy that she might die so--has written:        \"Let us not always say,      'Spite of the flesh to-day      I strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole.'      As the bird wings and sings,      Let us cry, 'All good things      Are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul.'\"    Again: are we, who believe in a Divine government of the world, able  to imagine that God has made the perpetuation of the race dependent  upon acts of sin or of indelicacy? Did He who graced with His presence  the marriage at Cana in Galilee really countenance a ceremony which  was a prelude to sin? Did He who took the little children in His arms  and blessed them know, as He said \"for of such is the kingdom of  heaven,\" that not one of them could have existed without indelicacy,  and that they were but living proof of their fathers' lapses and their  mothers' humiliation? Is He whom we address daily as \"Our Father\"  willing to be described by a name with which impurity is of necessity  connected? And has He implanted in us as the strongest of our  instincts that which cannot elevate and must debase?    Again: it needs no wide experience of life, nor any very indulgent  view of it, to feel some truth at least in the words Tennyson puts  into the mouth of his ideal man:                            \"Indeed I knew      Of no more subtle master under heaven      Than is the maiden passion for a maid      Not only to keep down _the base in man_,      But teach high thought, and amiable words,      And courtliness, and the desire for fame,      And love of truth, and all that makes a man.\"    And yet this passion is indisputably sexual passion, and the chastest  of lovers has bodily proof that the most spiritual of his kisses is  allied to the supreme embrace of love. Our body is the instrument by  which all our emotions are expressed. The most obvious way of  expressing affection is by bodily contact. The mother fondles her  child, kisses its lips and its limbs, and presses it to her breast.  Young children hold hands, put their arms round one another and kiss;  and, although later we become less demonstrative, we still take our  friend's arm, press his hand with ours, and lay a hand upon his  shoulder; we pat our horse or dog and stroke our cat. The lover  returns to the spontaneous and unrestrained caresses of his childhood.  These become more and more intimate until they find their consummation  in the most intimate and most sacred of all embraces. From first to  last these caresses--however deep the pleasure they bestow--are sought  by the mother or the lover, not _for the sake of_ that pleasure, but  as a means of expressing emotion. He only who realises this fact and  conforms to it can enter on married life with any certainty of  happiness. The happiness of very many marriages is irretrievably  shattered at the outset through the craving for sexual excitement  which, in the absence of wise guidance, grows up in every normal boy's  heart, and by the contemplation of sexual intercourse as an act of  physical pleasure.    And once again: It is the experience of those who have given  instruction in sex questions to the young that by those whose minds  have never been defiled the instruction is received with instant  reverence, as something sacred; not with shame, as something foul. I  venture once more to quote Canon Lyttelton, who sets forth his  experience and my own in language the beauty of which I cannot  imitate:    \"There is something awe-inspiring in the innocent readiness of little  children to learn the explanation of by far the greatest fact within  the horizon of their minds. The way they receive it, with native  reverence, truthfulness of understanding, and guileless delicacy, is  nothing short of a revelation of the never-ceasing bounty of Nature,  who endows successive generations of children with this instinctive  ear for the deep harmonies of her laws. People sometimes speak of the  indescribable beauty of children's innocence, and insist that there is  nothing which calls for more constant thanksgiving than that influence  on mankind. But I will venture to say that no one quite knows what it  is who has foregone the privilege of being the first to set before  them the true meaning of life and birth and the mystery of their own  being.\"    To the arguments thus briefly indicated it is no answer to say that  sexual union is essentially physical, and that to regard it in any  other way is transcendental. Among primitive men eating and drinking  were merely animal. We have made them, in our meals, an accompaniment  to social pleasures, and in our religious life we have raised them to  a sacramental level.          CHAPTER VI.    CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PURITY TEACHING IS BEST GIVEN: REMEDIAL AND  CURATIVE MEASURES.      We have now seen that impurity is almost universal among boys who have  been left without warning and instruction; that, under these  conditions, it is practically inevitable; that its direct results are  lowered vitality and serious injury to character, its indirect results  an appalling amount of degradation and misery; finally, that there is  nothing in sex knowledge, when rightly presented, which can in the  least defile a child's mind. All that now remains is for us to  consider by whom and under what circumstances instruction on this  subject should be given, and what assistance can be rendered to boys  who desire to lead chaste lives.    Without doubt, instruction should be given to a boy by his parents in  the home. When young children ask questions with regard to  reproduction, parents should neither ignore these question nor give  the usual silly answers. If the occasion on which the question is  asked is not one in which an answer can appropriately be given, the  child should be gently warned that the question raised is one about  which people do not openly talk, and the promise of an answer  hereafter should be made. Then, at the first convenient hour, the  child can either be given the information he seeks or told that he  shall hear all about the matter at some future specified time, as for  example, his sixth or eighth birthday.    In the absence of questions from a child, the ideal thing would be for  the child, at the age of six, seven, or eight, to learn orally from  his mother the facts of maternity and to receive warning against  playing with his private parts. Whether at this time it is best to  teach him the facts of paternity is, I think, doubtful. Canon  Lyttelton is strongly of opinion that the father's share in the  child's existence should be explained when the mother's share is  explained, and there is much weight in what he says. If the question  of paternity is reserved, it should not be on the ground that there is  anything embarrassing or indelicate about the matter, and, when the  facts are revealed, the child should clearly understand that they have  been withheld merely until his mind was sufficiently developed to  understand them. The only safe guide in such matters is experience,  and of this as yet we have unfortunately little.    The question next arises: should it be the mother or the father who  gives this instruction? As regards the earlier part of the instruction  a confident reply can be made to this question. The information should  be given by the parent whose relations with the child are the more  intimate and tender, and whose influence over him is the greater.  This will, of course, usually be the mother. The subject of paternity  may, if reserved for future treatment, be appropriately given by the  father, provided that he and his son are on really intimate terms. If  timely warning is given to a child about playing with his private  parts, no reference need be made to self-abuse until a boy leaves home  for school, or until he is nearing the age of puberty.    There are many mothers whose insight and tact will enable them to  approach these questions in the best possible way and to say exactly  the right thing. There are others--a large majority, I think--who  would be glad of guidance, and there are not a few who would certainly  leave the matter alone unless thus guided. It was mainly to assist  parents in this work that I published last year a pamphlet entitled  _Private Knowledge for Boys_.[D] This embodies just what, in my  opinion, should be said to an intelligent child, and it has, in my own  hands, proved effective for many years past. In the case of _young_  children the teaching should certainly be oral, _provided_ that the  mother knows clearly what to say, has sufficient powers of expression  to say it well, and can talk without any feeling of embarrassment.  Unless these conditions co-exist I recommend the use of a pamphlet. As  I have found that children often do not know what one means by the  \"private parts,\" I make this clear at the outset.

The romantic passion of love, as it was cherished, and indeed  enjoined, by the rules of chivalry, associated well with the no less  romantic feelings of devotion; and they might be said much more to  enhance than to counteract each other. It was, therefore, with a glow  of expectation that had something even of a religious character that  Sir Kenneth, his sensations thrilling from his heart to the ends of  his fingers, expected some second sign of the presence of one who, he  strongly fancied, had already bestowed on him the first. Short as  the space was during which the procession again completed a third  perambulation of the chapel, it seemed an eternity to Kenneth. At length  the form which he had watched with such devoted attention drew nigh.  There was no difference betwixt that shrouded figure and the others,  with whom it moved in concert and in unison, until, just as she passed  for the third time the kneeling Crusader, a part of a little and  well-proportioned hand, so beautifully formed as to give the highest  idea of the perfect proportions of the form to which it belonged, stole  through the folds of the gauze, like a moonbeam through the fleecy cloud  of a summer night, and again a rosebud lay at the feet of the Knight of  the Leopard.    This second intimation could not be accidental---it could not be  fortuitous, the resemblance of that half-seen but beautiful female hand  with one which his lips had once touched, and, while they touched it,  had internally sworn allegiance to the lovely owner. Had further proof  been wanting, there was the glimmer of that matchless ruby ring on that  snow-white finger, whose invaluable worth Kenneth would yet have prized  less than the slightest sign which that finger could have made; and,  veiled too, as she was, he might see, by chance or by favour, a stray  curl of the dark tresses, each hair of which was dearer to him a hundred  times than a chain of massive gold. It was the lady of his love! But  that she should be here--in the savage and sequestered desert--among  vestals, who rendered themselves habitants of wilds and of caverns, that  they might perform in secret those Christian rites which they dared  not assist in openly; that this should be so, in truth and in reality,  seemed too incredible--it must be a dream--a delusive trance of the  imagination. While these thoughts passed through the mind of Kenneth,  the same passage, by which the procession had entered the chapel,  received them on their return. The young sacristans, the sable nuns,  vanished successively through the open door. At length she from whom he  had received this double intimation passed also; yet, in passing, turned  her head, slightly indeed, but perceptibly, towards the place where he  remained fixed as an image. He marked the last wave of her veil--it was  gone--and a darkness sunk upon his soul, scarce less palpable than that  which almost immediately enveloped his external sense; for the last  chorister had no sooner crossed the threshold of the door than it shut  with a loud sound, and at the same instant the voices of the choir were  silent, the lights of the chapel were at once extinguished, and Sir  Kenneth remained solitary and in total darkness. But to Kenneth,  solitude, and darkness, and the uncertainty of his mysterious situation  were as nothing--he thought not of them--cared not for them--cared for  nought in the world save the flitting vision which had just glided past  him, and the tokens of her favour which she had bestowed. To grope on  the floor for the buds which she had dropped--to press them to his lips,  to his bosom, now alternately, now together--to rivet his lips to the  cold stones on which, as near as he could judge, she had so lately  stepped--to play all the extravagances which strong affection suggests  and vindicates to those who yield themselves up to it, were but the  tokens of passionate love common to all ages. But it was peculiar to the  times of chivalry that, in his wildest rapture, the knight imagined of  no attempt to follow or to trace the object of such romantic attachment;  that he thought of her as of a deity, who, having deigned to show  herself for an instant to her devoted worshipper, had again returned  to the darkness of her sanctuary--or as an influential planet, which,  having darted in some auspicious minute one favourable ray, wrapped  itself again in its veil of mist. The motions of the lady of his love  were to him those of a superior being, who was to move without watch or  control, rejoice him by her appearance, or depress him by her absence,  animate him by her kindness, or drive him to despair by her cruelty--all  at her own free will, and without other importunity or remonstrance than  that expressed by the most devoted services of the heart and sword of  the champion, whose sole object in life was to fulfil her commands, and,  by the splendour of his own achievements, to exalt her fame.    Such were the rules of chivalry, and of the love which was its ruling  principle. But Sir Kenneth's attachment was rendered romantic by other  and still more peculiar circumstances. He had never even heard the sound  of his lady's voice, though he had often beheld her beauty with rapture.  She moved in a circle which his rank of knighthood permitted him  indeed to approach, but not to mingle with; and highly as he stood  distinguished for warlike skill and enterprise, still the poor Scottish  soldier was compelled to worship his divinity at a distance almost as  great as divides the Persian from the sun which he adores. But when was  the pride of woman too lofty to overlook the passionate devotion of  a lover, however inferior in degree? Her eye had been on him in the  tournament, her ear had heard his praises in the report of the battles  which were daily fought; and while count, duke, and lord contended  for her grace, it flowed, unwillingly perhaps at first, or even  unconsciously, towards the poor Knight of the Leopard, who, to support  his rank, had little besides his sword. When she looked, and when she  listened, the lady saw and heard enough to encourage her in a partiality  which had at first crept on her unawares. If a knight's personal beauty  was praised, even the most prudish dames of the military court of  England would make an exception in favour of the Scottish Kenneth;  and it oftentimes happened that, notwithstanding the very considerable  largesses which princes and peers bestowed on the minstrels, an  impartial spirit of independence would seize the poet, and the harp was  swept to the heroism of one who had neither palfreys nor garments to  bestow in guerdon of his applause.    The moments when she listened to the praises of her lover became  gradually more and more dear to the high-born Edith, relieving the  flattery with which her ear was weary, and presenting to her a subject  of secret contemplation, more worthy, as he seemed by general report,  than those who surpassed him in rank and in the gifts of fortune. As her  attention became constantly, though cautiously, fixed on Sir Kenneth,  she grew more and more convinced of his personal devotion to herself and  more and more certain in her mind that in Kenneth of Scotland she beheld  the fated knight doomed to share with her through weal and woe--and the  prospect looked gloomy and dangerous--the passionate attachment to which  the poets of the age ascribed such universal dominion, and which its  manners and morals placed nearly on the same rank with devotion itself.    Let us not disguise the truth from our readers. When Edith became aware  of the state of her own sentiments, chivalrous as were her sentiments,  becoming a maiden not distant from the throne of England--gratified as  her pride must have been with the mute though unceasing homage rendered  to her by the knight whom she had distinguished, there were moments  when the feelings of the woman, loving and beloved, murmured against the  restraints of state and form by which she was surrounded, and when she  almost blamed the timidity of her lover, who seemed resolved not to  infringe them. The etiquette, to use a modern phrase, of birth and rank,  had drawn around her a magical circle, beyond which Sir Kenneth might  indeed bow and gaze, but within which he could no more pass than an  evoked spirit can transgress the boundaries prescribed by the rod of a  powerful enchanter. The thought involuntarily pressed on her that she  herself must venture, were it but the point of her fairy foot, beyond  the prescribed boundary, if she ever hoped to give a lover so reserved  and bashful an opportunity of so slight a favour as but to salute her  shoe-tie. There was an example--the noted precedent of the \"King's  daughter of Hungary,\" who thus generously encouraged the \"squire of low  degree;\" and Edith, though of kingly blood, was no king's daughter, any  more than her lover was of low degree--fortune had put no such extreme  barrier in obstacle to their affections. Something, however, within  the maiden's bosom--that modest pride which throws fetters even on love  itself forbade her, notwithstanding the superiority of her condition, to  make those advances, which, in every case, delicacy assigns to the other  sex; above all, Sir Kenneth was a knight so gentle and honourable, so  highly accomplished, as her imagination at least suggested, together  with the strictest feelings of what was due to himself and to her,  that however constrained her attitude might be while receiving his  adorations, like the image of some deity, who is neither supposed to  feel nor to reply to the homage"]]]
