Thus Moses 'scaped the mad decree    Of evil Pharaoh and set free    The flock of God, prefiguring so    Christ spared from fate's malignant blow.      Vain too the king's hostility    Who framed the pitiless decree    That Israel's mothers should not rear    To manhood's strength their offspring dear.      Quickened by love, a woman's mind    Found means to thwart that law unkind,    And, falsely true, the child concealed    Destined to be his people's Shield.      On him it was that God did place    The august priesthood's holy grace,    The law on stony tablets writ    Did to his trembling hands commit.      And may we not with prophet's eye    In such a hero Christ descry?    The proud Egyptian's might he broke    And freed his kinsmen from the yoke.      So we by Error's might hemmed round    Were by our Captain's strength unbound:    His foe He wounded in the fight    And saved us from Death's horrid night.      Cheering by sign of flame their feet,    Moses renewed with waters sweet    His folk, albeit purified    From stain, what time they crossed the tide.      And he, remote on peaceful height,    Amalek's banded hosts did smite:    He prayed with arms stretched out above,    Foreshadowing the Cross of Love.      Yet truer Jesus surely he,    Who after many a victory    And labours long the tribes' renown    With promised heritage did crown;      Who when the waters rose on high    And now the Jordan's bed was dry,    Set up twelve stones of memory,    Types of apostles yet to be.      Rightly the Wise Men said, I ween,    That they Judaea's King had seen,    Since noble deeds of other days    Prophetic chant the Saviour's praise.      Of those old rulers He is King    Who did to Jacob judgment bring,    King of the Mother Church divine,    God's ancient and God's present Shrine.      Of Ephraim's sons He is adored:    Manasseh's sacred house as Lord    Reveres Him: to His might the seed    Of brethren twelve their fealty plead.      Nay, each degenerate race hath fled    Its shameful rites and orgies dread:    Grim Baal in glowing furnace cast    Sinks to the earth, forsook at last.      Idols smoke-blackened, wooden-hewn,    Of brass and stone, in dust are strewn:    The chiselled deities downtrod:    For all confess in Christ their God.      Rejoice all peoples, Jewry, Rome,    Fair Hellas, Thrace, Aegyptus' home:    Persians and Scythian land forlorn,    Rejoice: the world's great King is born!      Behold your Chief! His praise forth tell:    Ye sick, ye hale, all heaven and hell:    Ay, you whose vital spark hath sped:    For lo! in Him e'en Death is dead.                                        EPILOGUS        Inmolat Deo Patri      pius, fidelis, innocens, pudicus    dona conscientiae,      quibus beata mens abundat intus:    alter et pecuniam        5      recidit, unde victitent egeni.    Nos citos iambicos      sacramus et rotatiles trochaeos,    sanctitatis indigi      nec ad levamen pauperum potentes;        10    adprobat tamen Deus      pedestre carmen, et benignus audit.    Multa divitis domo      sita est per omnes angulos supellex.    Fulget aureus scyphus,        15      nec aere defit expolita pelvis:    est et olla fictilis,      gravisque et ampla argentea est parabsis.    Sunt eburna quaepiam,      nonnulla quercu sunt cavata et ulmo:        20    omne vas fit utile,      quod est ad usum congruens herilem,    Instruunt enim domum      ut empta magno, sic parata ligno.    Me paterno in atrio                 25      ut obsoletum vasculum caducis    Christus aptat usibus,      sinitque parte in anguli manere.    Munus ecce fictile      inimus intra regiam salutis;      30    attamen vel infimam      Deo obsequelam praestitisse prodest.    Quidquid illud accidit,      iuvabit ore personasse Christum.                                        EPILOGUE        The pure and faithful saint, whose heart is whole,      To God the Father makes his sacrifice    From out the treasures of a stainless soul,      Glad gifts of innocence, beyond all price:    Another with free hand bestows his gold,      Whereby his needy neighbour may be fed.    No wealth of holiness my heart doth hold,      No store have I to buy my brothers bread:    So here I humbly dedicate to Thee      The rolling trochee and iambus swift;    Thou wilt approve my simple minstrelsy,      Thine ear will listen to Thy servant's gift.    The rich man's halls are nobly furnished;      Therein no nook or corner empty seems;    Here stands the brazen laver burnished,      And there the golden goblet brightly gleams;    Hard by some crock of clumsy earthen ware,      Massive and ample lies a silver plate;    And rough-hewn cups of oak or elm are there      With vases carved of ivory delicate.    Yet every vessel in its place is good,      So be it for the Master's service meet;    The priceless salver and the bowl of wood      Alike He needs to make His home complete.    Therefore within His Father's spacious hall      Christ fits me for the service of a day,    Mean though I be, a vessel poor and small,--      And in some lowly corner lets me stay.    Lo in the palace of the King of Kings      I play the earthen pitcher's humble part;    Yet to have done Him meanest service brings      A thrill of rapture to my thankful heart:    Whate'er the end, this thought will joy afford,      My lips have sung the praises of my Lord.          _This edition of the_ Cathemerinon of Prudentius _has been prepared for  the Temple Classics by_ Rev. R. MARTIN POPE, M.A. (_St John's College,  Cambridge, translator of the_ \"Letters of John Hus\"), _who has done the  translation of the_ Praefatio _and_ Hymns i., ii., iii., viii., xi.,  xii., _with notes thereon and the note on_ Prudentius. _For the rendering  of_ Hymns iv., v., vi., vii., ix., x., _and the_ Epilogus _with notes  thereon,_ Mr R.F. DAVIS, M.A. (_St John's College, Cambridge_), _is  responsible. The text, with some minor alterations in orthography and  punctuation, is that of_ Dressel (Lipsiae, 1860). _The frontispiece is  due to the kind suggestion of_ Dr SANDYS, _Public Orator of Cambridge  University, to whom the thanks of the translators are hereby presented._                                   TRANSLATOR'S NOTE      AURELIUS PRUDENTIUS CLEMENS (to give his full title) was born, probably  at Saragossa (Caesaraugusta), in Spain, in the year of our Lord 348. The  fourth century exercised a profound influence alike on the destiny of  the Roman Empire and of the Christian Church. After a long discipline,  strangely alternating between fiery persecution and contemptuous  toleration, the Church entered upon a new era, when in 323 Constantine,  the first Christian emperor, became master of the Roman world. Two  years later the Council of Nicaea met to utter its verdict on the  Arian controversy and to establish the terms of the orthodox symbol. A  generation later Julian took up the reins of empire and commenced his  quixotic and fruitless attempt to revive the glories of Paganism.  Athanasius died in 373: but fourteen years later Augustine, his successor  in the championship of the faith, was baptized, and in 395, at the death  of Theodosius, when the Empire was divided between Honorius and Arcadius,  he became Bishop of Hippo, and was marked out by his saintliness and  learning as the leader of the Western Church, which he shaped by his  splendid ideal of the _Civitas Dei_ into unity and stability, when  the secular empire was falling into decay.    We know little more of the life of Prudentius than he himself has  disclosed. The _Preface_, which stands as an introduction to his poems,  is a miniature autobiography of great interest. M. Boissier in his _Fin du  Paganisme_ calls it _melancolique_: though it is rather the retrospect  of a serious and awakened, but not morbid, conscience. Prudentius views  his past years in the light of that new spiritual truth to which he has  opened his soul. We gather that he received a liberal education and was  called to the bar. We need not misunderstand the allusion to the  deceitfulness of the barrister life, seeing that the ordinary arts of  rhetoric stand condemned by his recently adopted ethical standard. He held  two important judicial posts and was promoted to a high position, probably  in the civil service and not outside the limits of his native province, the  _provincia Tarraconensis_.    He speaks of himself as having reached the age of fifty-seven, which  brings us down to 405, and as intending to consecrate his remaining years  to the poetic treatment of religious subjects. When and how he became a  Christian we do not know, and it were vain to guess, although the  suggestion that he may have owed his conversion to the influence of some  Christian family of his acquaintance is at least interesting. It is  unlikely that he took up poetry for the first time in his old age. His  mastery of all kinds of metre--heroic and lyric--prove the practised hand.  The probability is that in the years of repose after a busy career his  desire to redeem an unspiritual past suggested for the exercise of his  natural gifts a field hitherto unoccupied by any of the writers of his  age. Why not consecrate his powers to the task of interesting the literary  circles of the Empire in the evangel of Christ? Why not present the truths  of Christianity in a poetic guise, wrought into forms of beauty and set  forth in the classical metres of Roman literature? This became the passion  of his life, and however we may view the results of his toil, the spirit  in which he went to work, as described in the touching _Epilogue_,  cannot but evoke our profound admiration. He is but a vessel of earth, but  whatever the issue may be, it will be a lasting joy to have sounded forth  the praise of Christ in song.    This then is how Prudentius becomes the first poet of the Christian Church,  or, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14969"],[0,"Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (#15)"],[1,"during the journey, and by  becoming obsessed with railroad phobia they protect themselves against a  repetition of the painful experiences.    This also fits in with the not as yet understood fact that the  concurrence of fear with mechanical shaking produces the severest  hysterical forms of traumatic neurosis. It may at least be assumed that  inasmuch as even a slight intensity of these influences becomes a source  of sexual excitement, the action of an excessive amount of the same will  produce a profound disorder in the sexual mechanism.    *Muscular Activity.*--It is well known that the child has need for  strong muscular activity, from the gratification of which it draws  extraordinary pleasure. Whether this pleasure has anything to do with  sexuality, whether it includes in itself sexual satisfaction? or can be  the occasion of sexual excitement; all this may be refuted by critical  consideration, which will probably be directed also to the position  taken above that the pleasure in the sensations of passive movement are  of sexual character or that they are sexually exciting. The fact  remains, however, that a number of persons report that they experienced  the first signs of excitement in their genitals during fighting or  wrestling with playmates, in which situation, besides the general  muscular exertion, there is an intensive contact with the opponent's  skin which also becomes effective. The desire for muscular contest with  a definite person, like the desire for word contest in later years, is a  good sign that the object selection has been directed toward this  person. \"Was sich liebt, das neckt sich.\"[21] In the promotion of sexual  excitement through muscular activity we might recognize one of the  sources of the sadistic impulse. The infantile connection between  fighting and sexual excitement acts in many persons as a determinant for  the future preferred course of their sexual impulse.[22]    *Affective Processes.*--The other sources of sexual excitement in the  child are open to less doubt. Through contemporary observations, as well  as through later investigations, it is easy to ascertain that all more  intensive affective processes, even excitements of a terrifying nature,  encroach upon sexuality; this can at all events furnish us with a  contribution to the understanding of the pathogenic action of such  emotions. In the school child, fear of a coming examination or exertion  expended in the solution of a difficult task can become significant for  the breaking through of sexual manifestations as well as for his  relations to the school, inasmuch as under such excitements a sensation  often occurs urging him to touch the genitals, or leading to a  pollution-like process with all its disagreeable consequences. The  behavior of children at school, which is so often mysterious to the  teacher, ought surely to be considered in relation with their  germinating sexuality. The sexually-exciting influence of some painful  affects, such as fear, shuddering, and horror, is felt by a great many  people throughout life and readily explains why so many seek  opportunities to experience such sensations, provided that certain  accessory circumstances (as under imaginary circumstances in reading, or  in the theater) suppress the earnestness of the painful feeling.    If we might assume that the same erogenous action also reaches the  intensive painful feelings, especially if the pain be toned down or held  at a distance by a subsidiary determination, this relation would then  contain the main roots of the masochistic-sadistic impulse, into the  manifold composition of which we are gaining a gradual insight.    *Intellectual Work.*--Finally, is is evident that mental application or  the concentration of attention on an intellectual accomplishment will  result, especially often in youthful persons, but in older persons as  well, in a simultaneous sexual excitement, which may be looked upon as  the only justified basis for the otherwise so doubtful etiology of  nervous disturbances from mental \"overwork.\"    If we now, in conclusion, review the evidences and indications of the  sources of the infantile sexual excitement, which have been reported  neither completely nor exhaustively, we may lay down the following  general laws as suggested or established. It seems to be provided in the  most generous manner that the process of sexual excitement--the nature  of which certainly remains quite mysterious to us--should be set in  motion. The factor making this provision in a more or less direct way is  the excitation of the sensible surfaces of the skin and sensory organs,  while the most immediate exciting influences are exerted on certain  parts which are designated as erogenous zones. The criterion in all  these sources of sexual excitement is really the quality of the stimuli,  though the factor of intensity (in pain) is not entirely unimportant.  But in addition to this there are arrangements in the organism which  induce sexual excitement as a subsidiary action in a large number of  inner processes as soon as the intensity of these processes has risen  above certain quantitative limits. What we have designated as the  partial impulses of sexuality are either directly derived from these  inner sources of sexual excitation or composed of contributions from  such sources and from erogenous zones. It is possible that nothing of  any considerable significance occurs in the organism that does not  contribute its components to the excitement of the sexual impulse.    It seems to me at present impossible to shed more light and certainty on  these general propositions, and for this I hold two factors responsible;  first, the novelty of this manner of investigation, and secondly, the  fact that the nature of the sexual excitement is entirely unfamiliar to  us. Nevertheless, I will not forbear speaking about two points which  promise to open wide prospects in the future.    *Diverse Sexual Constitutions.*--(_a_) We have considered above the  possibility of establishing the manifold character of congenital sexual  constitutions through the diverse formation of the erogenous zones; we  may now attempt to do the same in dealing with the indirect sources of  sexual excitement. We may assume that, although these different sources  furnish contributions in all individuals, they are not all equally  strong in all persons; and that a further contribution to the  differentiation of the diverse sexual constitution will be found in the  preferred developments of the individual sources of sexual excitement.    *The Paths of Opposite Influences.*--(_b_) Since we are now dropping the  figurative manner of expression hitherto employed, by which we spoke of  _sources_ of sexual excitement, we may now assume that all the  connecting ways leading from other functions to sexuality must also be  passable in the reverse direction. For example, if the lip zone, the  common possession of both functions, is responsible for the fact that  the sexual gratification originates during the taking of nourishment,  the same factor offers also an explanation for the disturbances in the  taking of nourishment if the erogenous functions of the common zone are  disturbed. As soon as we know that concentration of attention may  produce sexual excitement, it is quite natural to assume that acting on  the same path, but in a contrary direction, the state of sexual  excitement will be able to influence the availability of the voluntary  attention. A good part of the symptomatology of the neuroses which I  trace to disturbance of sexual processes manifests itself in  disturbances of the other non-sexual bodily functions, and this hitherto  incomprehensible action becomes less mysterious if it only represents  the counterpart of the influences controlling the production of the  sexual excitement.    However the same paths through which sexual disturbances encroach upon  the other functions of the body must in health be supposed to serve  another important function. It must be through these paths that the  attraction of the sexual motive-powers to other than sexual aims, the  sublimation of sexuality, is accomplished. We must conclude with the  admission that very little is definitely known concerning the paths  beyond the fact that they exist, and that they are probably passable in  both directions.    [1] For it is really impossible to have a correct knowledge of the part  belonging to heredity without first understanding the part belonging to  the infantile.    [2] This assertion on revision seemed even to myself so bold that I  decided to test its correctness by again reviewing the literature. The  result of this second review did not warrant any change in my original  statement. The scientific elaboration of the physical as well as the  psychic phenomena of the infantile sexuality is still in its initial  stages. One author (S. Bell, \"A Preliminary Study of the Emotions of  Love Between the Sexes,\" American Journal of Psychology, XIII, 1902)  says: \"I know of no scientist who has given a careful analysis of the  emotion as it is seen in the adolescent.\" The only attention given to  somatic sexual manifestations occurring before the age of puberty was in  connection with degenerative manifestations, and these were referred to  as a sign of degeneration. A chapter on the sexual life of children is  not to be found in all the representative psychologies of this age which  I have read. Among these works I can mention the following: Preyer;  Baldwin (The Development of the Mind in the Child and in the Race,  1898); Perez (L'enfant de 3-7 ans, 1894); Struempel (Die paedagogische  Pathologie, 1899); Karl Groos (Das Seelenleben des Kindes, 1904); Th.  Heller (Grundriss der Heilpaedagogic, 1904); Sully (Observations  Concerning Childhood, 1897). The best impression of the present  situation of this sphere can be obtained from the journal Die"]]]
