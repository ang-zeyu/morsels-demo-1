Apart from the _'amils_, Mohammed's agents amongst the Arabian tribes,  the Khalifate was the only political institution which arose out of the  necessity of the Moslim community, without foreign influence. It rescued  Islam from threatening destruction, and it led the Faithful to conquest. No  wonder that in historic legend the first four occupiers of that leadership,  who, from Medina, accomplished such great things, have been glorified into  saints, and are held up to all the following generations as examples to put  them to shame. In the Omayyads the ancient aristocracy of Mecca came to the  helm, and under them, the Mohammedan state was above all, as Wellhausen  styled it, \"the Arabian Empire.\" The best khalifs of this house had  the political wisdom to give the governors of the provinces sufficient  independence to prevent schism, and to secure to themselves the authority  in important matters. The reaction of the non-Arabian converts against the  suppression of their own culture by the Arabian conquerors found support in  the opposition parties, above all with the Shi'ah. The Abbasids, cleverer  politicians than the notoriously unskillful Alids, made use of the Alid  propaganda to secure the booty to themselves at the right moment. The means  which served the Alids for the establishment only of an invisible dynasty  of princes who died as martyrs, enabled the descendants of Mohammed's  uncle Abbas to overthrow the Omayyads, and to found their own Khalifate at  Bagdad, shining with the brilliance of an Eastern despotism.    When it is said that the Abbasid Khalifate maintained itself from 750 till  the Mongol storm in the middle of the thirteenth century, that only refers  to external appearance. After a brief success, the actual power of these  khalifs was transferred to the hands, first, of the captains of their  bodyguard, then of sultan-dynasties, whose forcibly acquired powers, were  legalized by a formal investiture. In the same way the large provinces  developed into independent kingdoms, whose rulers considered the  nomination-diplomas from Bagdad in the light of mere ornaments. Compared to  this irreparable disintegration of the empire, temporary schisms such as  the Omayyad Khalifate in Spain, the Fatimid Khalifate in Egypt, and here  and there an independent organization of the Kharijites were of little  significance.    It seems strange that the Moslim peoples, although the theory of Islam  never attributed an hereditary character to the Khalifate, attached so high  a value to the Abbasid name, that they continued unanimously to acknowledge  the Khalifate of Bagdad for centuries during which it possessed no  influence. But the idea of hereditary rulers was deeply rooted in most  of the peoples converted to Islam, and the glorious period of the first  Abbasids so strongly impressed itself on the mind of the vulgar, that the  _appearance_ of continuation was easily taken for _reality_. Its voidness  would sooner have been realized, if lack of energy had not prevented the  later Abbasids from trying to recover the lost power by the sword, or if  amongst their rivals who could also boast of a popular tradition--e.g.,  the Omayyads, or still more the Alids--a political genius had succeeded in  forming a powerful opposition. But the sultans who ruled the various states  did not want to place all that they possessed in the balance on the chance  of gaining the title of Khalif. The Moslim world became accustomed to the  idea that the honoured House of the Prophet's uncle Abbas existed for the  purpose of lending an additional glory to Mohammedan princes by a diploma.  Even after the destruction of Bagdad by the Mongols in 1258, from which  only a few Abbasids escaped alive, Indian princes continued to value visits  or deeds of appointment granted them by some begging descendant of the  \"Glorious House.\" The sultans of Egypt secured this luxury permanently for  themselves by taking a branch of the family under their protection, who  gave the glamour of their approval to every new result of the never-ending  quarrels of succession, until in the beginning of the sixteenth century  Egypt, together with so many other lands, was swallowed up by the Turkish  conqueror.    These new rulers, who added the Byzantine Empire to Islam, who with Egypt  brought Southern and Western Arabia with the Holy Cities also under their  authority, and caused all the neighbouring princes, Moslim and Christian  alike, to tremble on their thrones, thought it was time to abolish the  senseless survival of the Abbasid glory. The prestige of the Ottomans was  as great as that of the Khalifate in its most palmy days had been; and they  would not be withheld from the assumption of the title. There is a doubtful  tale of the abdication of the Abbasids in their favour, but the question  is of no importance. The Ottomans owed their Khalifate to their sword; and  this was the only argument used by such canonists as thought it worth their  while to bring such an incontestable fact into reconciliation with the law.  This was not strictly necessary, as they had been accustomed for eight  centuries to acquiesce in all sorts of unlawful acts which history  demonstrated to be the will of Allah.    The sense of the tradition that established descent from the tribe of  Qoraish as necessary for the highest dignity in the community was capable  of being weakened by explanation; and, even without that, the leadership of  the irresistible Ottomans was of more value to Islam than the chimerical  authority of a powerless Qoraishite. In our own time, you can hear  Qoraishites, and even Alids, warmly defend the claims of the Turkish  sultans to the Khalifate, as they regard these as the only Moslim princes  capable of championing the threatened rights of Islam.    Even the sultans of Stambul could not think of restoring the authority of  the Khalif over the whole Mohammedan world. This was prevented not only  by the schismatic kingdoms, khalifates, or imamates like Shi'itic Persia,  which was consolidated just in the sixteenth century, by the unceasing  opposition of the Imams of Yemen, and Kharijite principalities at the  extremities of the Mohammedan world. Besides these, there were numerous  princes in Central Asia, in India, and in Central Africa, whom either the  Khalifate had always been obliged to leave to themselves, or who had become  so estranged from it that, unless they felt the power of the Turkish arms,  they preferred to remain as they were. Moreover, Islam had extended itself  not only by political means, but also by trade and colonization into  countries even the existence of which was hardly known in the political  centres of Islam, e.g., into Central Africa or the Far East of Asia.  Without thinking of rivalling the Abbasids or their successors, some of the  princes of such remote kingdoms, e.g., the sherifs of Morocco, assumed the  title of Commander of the Faithful, bestowed upon them by their flatterers.  Today, there are petty princes in East India under Dutch sovereignty who  decorate themselves with the title of Khalif, without suspecting that they  are thereby guilty of a sort of arrogant blasphemy.    Such exaggeration is not supported by the canonists; but these have devised  a theory, which gives a foundation to the authority of Mohammedan princes,  who never had a real or fictitious connection with a real or fictitious  Khalifate. Authority there must be, everywhere and under all circumstances;  far from the centre this should be exercised, according to them, by the  one who has been able to gain it and who knows how to hold it; and all the  duties are laid upon him, which, in a normal condition, would be discharged  by the Khalif or his representative. For this kind of authority the  legists have even invented a special name: \"_shaukah,_\" which means actual  influence, the authority which has spontaneously arisen in default of a  chief who in one form or another can be considered as a mandatary of the  Khalifate.    Now, it is significant that many of those Mohammedan governors, who owe  their existence to wild growth in this way, seek, especially in our day,  for connection with the Khalifate, or, at least, wish to be regarded as  naturally connected with the centre. The same is true of such whose former  independence or adhesion to the Turkish Empire has been replaced by the  sovereignty of a Western state. Even amongst the Moslim peoples placed  under the direct government of European states a tendency prevails to be  considered in some way or another subjects of the Sultan-Khalif. Some  scholars explain this phenomenon by the spiritual character which the  dignity of Khalif is supposed to have acquired under the later Abbasids,  and retained since that time, until the Ottoman princes combined it again  with the temporal dignity of sultan. According to this view the later  Abbasids were a sort of popes of Islam; while the temporal authority, in  the central districts as well as in the subordinate kingdoms, was in the  hands of various sultans. The sultans of Constantinople govern, then, under  this name, as much territory as the political vicissitudes allow them to  govern--_i.e._, the Turkish Empire; as khalifs, they are the spiritual  heads of the whole of Sunnite Islam.    Though this view, through the ignorance of European statesmen and  diplomatists, may have found acceptance even by some of the great powers,  it is nevertheless entirely untrue; unless by \"spiritual authority\" we are  to understand the empty appearance of worldly authority. This appearance  was all that the later Abbasids retained after the loss of their temporal  power; spiritual authority of any kind they never possessed.    The spiritual authority in catholic Islam reposes in the legists, who in  this respect are called in a tradition the _\"heirs of the prophets.\"_ Since  they could no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10166"],[0,"What Germany Thinks; Or, The War as Germans see it (#15)"],[1,"to the _Berliner Zeitung am  Mittag_ (August 5th): \"May I supplement your article 'Spies and  Spy-hunting' with a few facts from my own personal knowledge. On August  3rd no fewer than sixty-four spies (?) were brought into the police  station at the Potsdamer Railway Station (Berlin). Not one was kept in  arrest, for the simple fact that they were all innocent German citizens.    \"Among others who were 'captured' and threatened with death by the  raging crowd on the Potsdamer Platz were: A pensioned Prussian major,  who was waiting for his son; a surgeon in the Landwehr; a high official  from the Courts of Justice; and lastly, a pensioned Bavarian army  officer who, on account of his stature, was thought to be a Russian. A  drunken shop-assistant egged on the crowd against this last suspect, so  that his life was really in danger. He was rescued by four Prussian  officers, who pretended to arrest their Bavarian colleague, and were in  this way able to lead him into safety.\"    This twentieth-century reign of terror is not, however, without a ray of  humour. The semi-official _Koelnische Zeitung_ (August 4th) contained a  legend which set all Germany hunting for French motor-cars. \"Several  motor-cars with ladies in them, taking gold to Russia, are on their way  across Germany. They must be stopped and a communication sent to the  nearest military or police station.\"    \"The occupants of the motor-cars carrying gold to Russia are said to  have transferred the precious metal to cyclists dressed as  bricklayers.\"[55]    [Footnote 55: _Das Kleine Journal_ (Berlin), August 5th.]    \"The official announcement that French and Russian motor-cars had been  seen on our country roads has aroused the otherwise leaden, heavy  imaginations of the country people to the most incredible delirium. We  will limit ourselves to a single instance. One of our cars met a peasant  with a hand-waggon near Nerchau. As soon as he perceived the motor he  bolted in mad fright into a neighbouring corn-field.    \"Our man called in a friendly voice: 'My good fellow, what are you  running away for?' Then the hero answered in a trembling voice: 'I  thought it was a French motor!'\"[56]    [Footnote 56: _Leipziger Volkszeitung_, August 6th.]    On August 6th every important paper in the German Empire contained the  following paragraph issued by the \"Army Direction\" in Berlin:    \"The hunt for alleged hostile motor-cars must stop. It endangers the  motor-car communications so necessary to our armies.\"    This warning was repeated in stronger terms on the following day, and  the roll of murdered victims began to leak out. \"Unfortunately through  this hunt several persons have been wrongfully shot. In Leipzig a doctor  and his chauffeur have been shot, while between Berlin and Koepenick a  company of armed civilians on the look-out for Russian motor-cars tried  to stop a car. The chauffeur was compelled to put the brakes on so  suddenly that the motor dashed into a tree, with the result that the  occupants--several persons connected with the army--were hurled on to  the road and received dangerous injuries.    \"In Munich a chauffeur was shot dead by a sentinel because he did not  stop soon enough. Even children are not spared in this degrading fear of  spies.    \"Near Bueren (Westphalia) the twelve-year-old daughter of Town Councillor  Buddeberg in Bielefeld was returning with her mother from Marburg in a  motor. Somebody must have telephoned that the car was suspect, for the  Landwehr Society placed armed sentinels at various points on the road.  They cried 'Halt!' to the chauffeur; just as the car was stopping, shots  were fired, and the girl sank dead in the arms of her mother.    \"Even the nationalist journals have expressed their astonishment that a  civilian society is permitted to hold the public highways with armed  guards. At Coblence a teacher and organist named Ritter was shot by a  sentinel.\"[57]    [Footnote 57: _Leifziger Volkszeitung_, Supplement I., August 7th. Here  we have proof that Germany allowed armed civilians to murder supposed  Frenchmen, a fact to be remembered when weighing Germany's accusations  against Belgian civilians. The German Government has published a White  Book (328 quarto pages) during the summer, 1915, indicting Belgian  civilians with all kinds of atrocities. Waiving the point that if  Germany first laid aside international law she had no right to expect  Belgium to respect its dictates, it may be safely assumed that the  evidence cited by the Germans is of little or no value. The oath which  German soldiers are compelled to take precludes the possibility that  they would or could give evidence which reflected on the conduct of the  German army either in peace or war, even if the evidence is absolutely  true. \"In the interests of military discipline\" the truth must be  suppressed. The same oath is, however, proof that the German soldier  must be prepared to lay down either his life _or his honour_ in defence  of the army, and in a later chapter irrefutable evidence from German  sources will be adduced to show that the White Book in question contains  \"sworn lies\" emanating from members of the German army.]    In its issue for August 11th the same newspaper gave the names of four  more victims who had been shot in Westphalia. Among them was a poor  woman of weak intellect; she was near a bridge, and failing to comply  with a sentry's challenge, was shot. The bullet passed through her leg  and killed a little girl who was working near her.    Wolff's Bureau in Berlin reports: \"In spite of the most urgent appeals  which the Army Direction has issued during the last few days, begging  the public not to place hindrances in the way of motor-cars, blundering  mistakes are still being made every hour in all parts of Germany,  accompanied by the most serious consequences.    \"The morning papers again contain reports of gold-motors having been  captured. There are neither gold-motors nor foreign motors in Germany.  Anyone who interferes with motor traffic is committing a sin against the  army.\"[58]    [Footnote 58: _Leipziger Volkszeitung_, August 10th.]    Another warning appeared in all the papers of August 12th in a still  more imperative form. Yet a section of the public seemed to find a  source of humour in this tragic hunt. A correspondent of the _Berliner  Tageblatt_ gave an interesting report of his motor-ride (joy-ride?) from  Lindau to Munich.    \"We were hardly two kilometres out of Lindau when we were stopped by a  barricade of hay-wagons. On each side peasants stood with threatening  mien, armed with pitchforks, revolvers and ancient carbines at  full-cock. 'Hands up!' First visitation; we show our papers, everything  in order. Off again.    \"About every two kilometres this scene was repeated: road jammed with  huge, long wagons, the same excitement, the same discussion, but now and  then somewhat sharper. In some villages the duty to defend the  Fatherland has turned into madness.    \"'Here, get out! Where was this paper stamped? Yes, it is possible to  forge!' They refuse to believe anything; not even a passport from the  Chief in Command, nor papers proving me to be a German and my companion  a German officer. When I tell them that I am an author and journalist  from Berlin, they parry with a 'What the devil is that?'    \"These brave peasants defend their Fatherland well. Once we had to wait  half an hour till a _gendarme_ came and ended the comedy with a few  short words. Then we are allowed to get in again, and as I turn round a  peasant shouts a last greeting: 'Really, I took you for a common hussy  in disguise!'    \"They threaten us from the houses. Now and then the trigger of a gun  clicks as it is levelled at us from a window. The roads are lined with  peasants armed with all sorts of weapons, iron spikes, dung-forks,  clubs, scythes, and old swords from the time of our great-grandfathers.    \"Up to the suburbs of Munich they stand at every village by day and by  night to see that nothing happens to the Fatherland! And even if we were  stopped twenty-eight times in this short distance; even if we did have  to put up with hard words and black looks--we suffered all this gladly.  We rejoiced to see with our own eyes how valiantly our peasants defend  the frontiers of their Fatherland.\"[59]    [Footnote 59: Edmund Edel in the _Berliner Tageblatt_, August 9th.]    In due time the bloodthirsty Pecksniff who had set the avalanche in  motion appeared to express his holy indignation.    \"Wolff's Bureau has circulated the following warning. Berlin, August  14th. This fatal hunt for motor-cars has claimed yet another victim.  Recently an Austrian countess was shot while working for the Red Cross,  and now a cavalry captain and his chauffeur have been killed by a  forest-keeper on the look-out for Russian _automobile_.    \"The General Staff has again and again issued the most urgent demands  that this unhappy hunt for foreign motorists--which has already caused  the death of several good Germans--should cease.    \"It is unadulterated madness (_es ist heller Wahnsinn_) to search for  enemy motors in our land. Neither enemy officers, nor cars loaded with  gold, are driving around in Germany. Would that our people would stop  this horrible murder of their own countrymen and lend an ear to the  warning voice of our Army Direction. Our Fatherland needs every single  man in this serious hour.\"[60]    [Footnote 60: _Leipziger Volkszeitung_, August 15th.]    Only one more nail requires to be driven home to prove the blood-guilt  of the German authorities for the murder of their own citizens.    \"Innumerable reports are in circulation about the capture of spies and  the prevention of plots against persons and buildings. In spite of the  fact that the military authorities have repeatedly and urgently appealed  for the exercise of the greatest discretion in publishing such reports,  the nationalist Press exploits"]]]
