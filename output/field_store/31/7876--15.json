[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13331"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Chichester (1901) (#15)"],[1," is a regular octagon in shape. Four octagonal pinnacles  are placed at its base next to each of the turrets of the tower; and  between these, on the other four faces of the spire, are tall stone  dormers, with carved crockets and finials on the copings of the  high-pitched gables. Above this group the spire is divided into three  sections by two bands of diaper-work cut out of the stone surfaces as  cusped quatrefoils; and from the base of the spire to its capstone  there is a projecting rib on each angle between the several faces of  the octagon.    The #Bell Tower#, which stands alone to the north of the cathedral,  is now the only one of its kind in England; and it is curious that in  two cases where these towers were found, as at Salisbury and at  Norwich, spires had been added to the central towers. The cathedral  bells have been hung in this tower since the fifteenth century. The  structure itself, with its massive walls, is square in plan at the  base, but at the top story it becomes an octagon, and the buttresses  on each angle terminate as pinnacles between the angles of the square  and four sides of the octagon.    [Illustration: THE NAVE, LOOKING WEST. _Photochrom Co., Ltd., photo.]          CHAPTER III.    THE INTERIOR.      The #Nave# of Chichester, compared with that of other cathedrals,  possesses several peculiar characteristics. It has a beauty apart from  others in the quiet simplicity with which it has been designed. There  is an evident restraint, almost severity, to be felt in studying the  exquisite proportions of its parts. It does not exhibit the massive  force and strength of Durham; but the rigid power in the square piers  of the arcades is stern compared with the more subtle variations of  light and shade produced by the curved surfaces of the circular piers  either at Ely or Peterborough.    During the Reformation period the divisions between the several  chapels to the north and south of the nave were removed; and so since  that date Chichester has been the only cathedral in England which has  what may be called five aisles, and it is wider than any other,  excepting York, being ninety-one feet across.    The central space, or nave proper, is divided into eight bays  throughout its length. The vertical lines which mark these divisions  are the triple attached vaulting shafts. They support the transverse  ribs of the stone vault; and from their carved Purbeck marble capitals  spring also the wall and diagonal ribs. A Purbeck string-course in  each case separates the triforium gallery from the arcade below and  from the clerestory above.    [Illustration: THE NAVE, LOOKING EAST. _Photochrom Co., Ltd., photo_.]    The nave arcades have round arches. The fine stone facing of the piers  toward the nave, the small columns in the jambs, the vaulting shafts,  and the moulded outer member of the arches are all additions to the  twelfth-century structure. In the triforium, the round arch again  occurs with two smaller sub-arches of similar shape. In the nave these  were not altered after the second fire; but the clerestory above was  much changed in character. The central arch of the three remained  semicircular, but the side ones became pointed in place of the early  round arches. The detached columns, the jamb shafts, and the moulding  of the arches were all altered in detail; and the stone used was of  finer texture, like that with which the piers of the arcade below were  faced.    In the #South Aisle# there is a good view, which extends beyond the  transept into the small chapel of S. Mary Magdalen at the east end, in  which is the only really fine stained-glass window in the church. The  chapel aisle to the south of this, again, is interesting, in that it  still retains some signs of what purposes it served in former days.  The two western bays were originally the #chapel of S. George#.  Those to the east were dedicated as the #chapel of S. Clement#. In  each of these the old piscina and aumbry remain near where the altar  had been placed. The latter chapel has now been restored in memory of  Bishop Durnford (see page 121). Mr. G.F. Bodley, A.R.A., and Mr. T.  Garner were the architects who designed the new work. The old wall  arcade is now again used as part of the reredos. The figures under the  arches are--in the centre S. Clement, on the south S. Anselm, and on  the north S. Alphege. In the quatrefoils above are figures of two  angels bearing in their hands shields, on which are represented the  symbols of the Passion. Behind the altar, which is of oak, is a white  marble re-table. The deeply moulded arch which separates the two  vaulted bays of each of these chapels is carried by some very  beautiful carved capitals. Above them may be seen the square abaci  which are so much used in all the later work in the cathedral. They  are peculiarly a French characteristic, and serve to indicate the  relationship there was between the English and Continental schools of  mediaeval architecture.    Beyond this chapel is the doorway from the south porch, which gives  access to the west walk of the cloister.    The doorway on the right in the south aisle next to the entrance to  the south arm of the transept leads to the #Bishop's Consistory  Court# (or Langton's Chapter House), which is now a muniment-room.    The small chamber above the south porch is supposed to have been a  secret #Treasury#. It is approached through the muniment-room, and  has been popularly known as the \"Lollard's Prison.\"    [Illustration: THE SOUTH AISLE FROM THE NAVE. _S.B. Bolas & Co.  photo_.]    The #North Aisle# is similar to that on the south side. Towards its  western end is the entrance door from the north porch.    The north chapel aisle was originally used as three separate chapels  until the divisions between them were removed. The two bays at the  west were the #chapel of S. Anne#; the two next east of this formed  the chapel of the Four Virgins, and the last bay was the small chapel  of SS. Thomas and Edmund. In the first named of these there may still  be seen, in the jambs, the capitals, and the arch-moulds of the  north-western window, some of the colour decoration of which so much  remained until the nineteenth century. The space in the north wall  shows where the aumbry used to be. The small remnants of the division  wall at the east are some slight indication of what the design of the  arcading on this wall was before it was destroyed. In the next chapel,  that of the #Four Virgins#, there is nothing to show where the  aumbry or the piscina was. But on the north 'the position of the  arcading on the east dividing wall remains. The #chapel of SS. Thomas  and Edmund# has an arcade on the east wall similar to that in the  chapel of S. Clement. The aumbry is on the north and the piscina on  the south side of the position which the altar used to occupy.    The #Rood-Screen# at the entrance to the choir from the nave was  erected in 1889, and is a memorial of Archdeacon Walker. It was  designed by Mr. T. Garner. At the point where the arms of the cross  meet is a figure representing the \"Agnus Dei,\" and at the extremities  of the cross are carvings of the four-winged figures of the cherubim.    The #Pulpit# was designed by Sir Gilbert Scott, and is a memorial  of Dean Hook. It is very elaborately carved, and is made of Caen stone  and Purbeck marble. The four figures are intended to represent  Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.    The #Lectern# of brass was presented to the church as a memorial of  Richard Owen, of Chichester, by his daughter.    The #Font# under the south-western tower is a copy of an old one in  the church at Shoreham. It was the gift of Bishop Durnford, as a  memorial of his wife.    The #Monuments in the Nave# have in many cases suffered from bad  usage, and in most instances they do not now occupy their original  places in the building.    The canopied memorial to Bishop Durnford (1), [30] under which is a  recumbent effigy, forms part of the screen between S. Clement's  chapel and the south aisle of the nave. It was designed by Mr. Garner.  There are several tablets in the nave and aisles by Flaxman. The best  are those to the memory of Captain Cromwell's wife and daughter (2),  in S. Clement's chapel, and one on the north side of the nave, in the  chapel of the Four Virgins, as a memorial of Collins (3), the poet,  who was a native of Chichester. The two recumbent figures under the  arch leading into this same chapel are said to be those of Richard  Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, and his wife (4). It was restored by  Richardson. Fitz-Alan was beheaded in 1397. Some say that these two  figures were removed from the chapel of the monastery of the Grey  Friars at the time of the Reformation, and were placed in their  present position in 1843, having been found embedded in the stonework  of the chapel wall close by. The base upon which the figures rest is  modern. The earl is represented in full armour. At his feet is a lion,  and at his head, under the helmet, is a coronet and a lion's head. At  the countess's feet is a dog, and her head rests upon two pillows.      [30] The figures in parenthesis refer to the numbers on the plan at  the end.    The most beautiful monument now remaining in the church is that which  is said to represent Maud, Countess of Arundel (1270) (5). The  modelling of the whole figure and the long flowing lines of her robes  are worthy of careful study. The whole pose and the disposition of the  two angels at the head arranging the pillows, with the two dogs upon  which her feet rest, have been finely conceived and well executed. The  hands are clasped over the breast, with the forearms bent upwards  slightly towards the face. On each of the long sides of the base  supporting the figure are six elongated quatrefoil panels, containing  in all six female figures and six shields. Between the quatrefoils are  winged heads of ten angelic figures.

It is one of the nice  observances of the profession.\"    The general so far laid aside the dignity appropriate to a Confederate  officer of high rank and wide renown as to smile. But no one in his  power and out of his favor would have drawn any happy augury from that  outward and visible sign of approval. It was neither genial nor  infectious; it did not communicate itself to the other persons exposed  to it--the caught spy who had provoked it and the armed guard who had  brought him into the tent and now stood a little apart, watching his  prisoner in the yellow candle-light. It was no part of that warrior's  duty to smile; he had been detailed for another purpose. The  conversation was resumed; it was in character a trial for a capital  offense.    \"You admit, then, that you are a spy--that you came into my camp,  disguised as you are in the uniform of a Confederate soldier, to obtain  information secretly regarding the numbers and disposition of my  troops.\"    \"Regarding, particularly, their numbers. Their disposition I already  knew. It is morose.\"    The general brightened again; the guard, with a severer sense of his  responsibility, accentuated the austerity of his expression and stood a  trifle more erect than before. Twirling his gray slouch hat round and  round upon his forefinger, the spy took a leisurely survey of his  surroundings. They were simple enough. The tent was a common \"wall  tent,\" about eight feet by ten in dimensions, lighted by a single tallow  candle stuck into the haft of a bayonet, which was itself stuck into a  pine table at which the general sat, now busily writing and apparently  forgetful of his unwilling guest. An old rag carpet covered the earthen  floor; an older leather trunk, a second chair and a roll of blankets  were about all else that the tent contained; in General Clavering's  command Confederate simplicity and penury of \"pomp and circumstance\" had  attained their highest development. On a large nail driven into the tent  pole at the entrance was suspended a sword-belt supporting a long sabre,  a pistol in its holster and, absurdly enough, a bowie-knife. Of that  most unmilitary weapon it was the general's habit to explain that it was  a souvenir of the peaceful days when he was a civilian.    It was a stormy night. The rain cascaded upon the canvas in torrents,  with the dull, drum-like sound familiar to dwellers in tents. As the  whooping blasts charged upon it the frail structure shook and swayed and  strained at its confining stakes and ropes.    The general finished writing, folded the half-sheet of paper and spoke  to the soldier guarding Adderson: \"Here, Tassman, take that to the  adjutant-general; then return.\"    \"And the prisoner, General?\" said the soldier, saluting, with an  inquiring glance in the direction of that unfortunate.    \"Do as I said,\" replied the officer, curtly.    The soldier took the note and ducked himself out of the tent. General  Clavering turned his handsome face toward the Federal spy, looked him in  the eyes, not unkindly, and said: \"It is a bad night, my man.\"    \"For me, yes.\"    \"Do you guess what I have written?\"    \"Something worth reading, I dare say. And--perhaps it is my vanity--I  venture to suppose that I am mentioned in it.\"    \"Yes; it is a memorandum for an order to be read to the troops at  _reveille_ concerning your execution. Also some notes for the guidance  of the provost-marshal in arranging the details of that event.\"    \"I hope, General, the spectacle will be intelligently arranged, for I  shall attend it myself.\"    \"Have you any arrangements of your own that you wish to make? Do you  wish to see a chaplain, for example?\"    \"I could hardly secure a longer rest for myself by depriving him of some  of his.\"    \"Good God, man! do you mean to go to your death with nothing but jokes  upon your lips? Do you know that this is a serious matter?\"    \"How can I know that? I have never been dead in all my life. I have  heard that death is a serious matter, but never from any of those who  have experienced it.\"    The general was silent for a moment; the man interested, perhaps amused  him--a type not previously encountered.    \"Death,\" he said, \"is at least a loss--a loss of such happiness as we  have, and of opportunities for more.\"    \"A loss of which we shall never be conscious can be borne with composure  and therefore expected without apprehension. You must have observed,  General, that of all the dead men with whom it is your soldierly  pleasure to strew your path none shows signs of regret.\"    \"If the being dead is not a regrettable condition, yet the becoming so--  the act of dying--appears to be distinctly disagreeable to one who has  not lost the power to feel.\"    \"Pain is disagreeable, no doubt. I never suffer it without more or less  discomfort. But he who lives longest is most exposed to it. What you  call dying is simply the last pain--there is really no such thing as  dying. Suppose, for illustration, that I attempt to escape. You lift the  revolver that you are courteously concealing in your lap, and--\"    The general blushed like a girl, then laughed softly, disclosing his  brilliant teeth, made a slight inclination of his handsome head and said  nothing. The spy continued: \"You fire, and I have in my stomach what I  did not swallow. I fall, but am not dead. After a half-hour of agony I  am dead. But at any given instant of that half-hour I was either alive  or dead. There is no transition period.    \"When I am hanged to-morrow morning it will be quite the same; while  conscious I shall be living; when dead, unconscious. Nature appears to  have ordered the matter quite in my interest--the way that I should have  ordered it myself. It is so simple,\" he added with a smile, \"that it  seems hardly worth while to be hanged at all.\"    At the finish of his remarks there was a long silence. The general sat  impassive, looking into the man's face, but apparently not attentive to  what had been said. It was as if his eyes had mounted guard over the  prisoner while his mind concerned itself with other matters. Presently  he drew a long, deep breath, shuddered, as one awakened from a dreadful  dream, and exclaimed almost inaudibly: \"Death is horrible!\"--this man of  death.    \"It was horrible to our savage ancestors,\" said the spy, gravely,  \"because they had not enough intelligence to dissociate the idea of  consciousness from the idea of the physical forms in which it is  manifested--as an even lower order of intelligence, that of the monkey,  for example, may be unable to imagine a house without inhabitants, and  seeing a ruined hut fancies a suffering occupant. To us it is horrible  because we have inherited the tendency to think it so, accounting for  the notion by wild and fanciful theories of another world--as names of  places give rise to legends explaining them and reasonless conduct to  philosophies in justification. You can hang me, General, but there your  power of evil ends; you cannot condemn me to heaven.\"    The general appeared not to have heard; the spy's talk had merely turned  his thoughts into an unfamiliar channel, but there they pursued their  will independently to conclusions of their own. The storm had ceased,  and something of the solemn spirit of the night had imparted itself to  his reflections, giving them the sombre tinge of a supernatural dread.  Perhaps there was an element of prescience in it. \"I should not like to  die,\" he said--\"not to-night.\"    He was interrupted--if, indeed, he had intended to speak further--by the  entrance of an officer of his staff, Captain Hasterlick, the  provost-marshal. This recalled him to himself; the absent look passed  away from his face.    \"Captain,\" he said, acknowledging the officer's salute, \"this man is a  Yankee spy captured inside our lines with incriminating papers on him.  He has confessed. How is the weather?\"    \"The storm is over, sir, and the moon shining.\"    \"Good; take a file of men, conduct him at once to the parade ground, and  shoot him.\"    A sharp cry broke from the spy's lips. He threw himself forward, thrust  out his neck, expanded his eyes, clenched his hands.    \"Good God!\" he cried hoarsely, almost inarticulately; \"you do not mean  that! You forget--I am not to die until morning.\"    \"I have said nothing of morning,\" replied the general, coldly; \"that was  an assumption of your own. You die now.\"    \"But, General, I beg--I implore you to remember; I am to hang! It will  take some time to erect the gallows--two hours--an hour. Spies are  hanged; I have rights under military law. For Heaven's sake, General,  consider how short--\"    \"Captain, observe my directions.\"    The officer drew his sword and fixing his eyes upon the prisoner pointed  silently to the opening of the tent. The prisoner hesitated; the officer  grasped him by the collar and pushed him gently forward. As he  approached the tent pole the frantic man sprang to it and with cat-like  agility seized the handle of the bowie-knife, plucked the weapon from  the scabbard and thrusting the captain aside leaped upon the general  with the fury of a madman, hurling him to the ground and falling  headlong upon him as he lay. The table was overturned, the candle  extinguished and they fought blindly in the darkness. The  provost-marshal sprang to the assistance of his Superior officer and was  himself prostrated upon the struggling forms. Curses and inarticulate  cries of rage and pain came from the welter of limbs and bodies; the  tent came down upon them and beneath its hampering and enveloping folds  the struggle went on.
