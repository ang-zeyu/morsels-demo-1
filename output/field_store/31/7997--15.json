Jackson was certainly swimming well, although the terrific strain was  beginning to tell upon him.    \"Go it, Jackson,\" roared Lew Flapp. \"Go it, old Moneybags!\"    \"Moneybags\" was a signal among many of the cadets, signifying that the  speaker had bet money on the result. Betting at the academy was  strictly prohibited, but wagers were often made on the sly.    Hearing this cry, Jackson renewed his struggles and for a few seconds  held his lead.    But now Dick Rover was crawling up inch by inch. He had passed Tom, who  was left hopelessly in the rear, and now he was pressing Larry.    \"The major and the captain are tie!\"    \"See, Captain Rover is crawling ahead!\"    \"Swim, Jackson, swim!\" yelled Lew Flapp frantically. \"You must win!\"  And Pender took up the call, and so did Rockley.    Again Jackson did his best. The finish of the race was now but twenty  yards off.    \"Go in and win, Dick,\" came from Larry Colby. \"I'm about used up,\" and  he let Dick go ahead.    Dick was almost as fresh as at the start and slowly but surely he kept  gaining upon Jackson until the two were not over two yards apart.    \"Hurrah, Captain Rover is crawling up!\"    \"Don't give up, Jackson, you can win out yet!\" screamed Lew Flapp.    \"Go it, Dick!\" yelled Sam. \"Go it, I say! The race is yours!\"    Cheered by the last cry Dick increased his stroke and in a second more  he was alongside of Jackson.    The latter made a side kick, intending to catch Dick in the stomach,  but the eldest Rover was wise enough to keep out of his opponent's  reach.    The kick made Jackson lose ground, and like a flash Dick passed him.    \"Dick Rover is ahead!\"    \"See, Jackson is played out! He can hardly take another stroke!\"    \"Major Colby is crawling up! See, he is passing Jackson!\"    \"And here comes Tom Rover, too.\"    \"Wake up, Tom!\" cried Sam. \"You can beat Jackson yet!\"    At this cry Tom did wake up, and seeing Jackson floundering around put  on a final spurt and passed him.    \"Dick Rover has won the race!\"    \"And Major Colby is second, and Tom Rover third.\"    \"Poor Jackson wasn't in it, after all!\"          CHAPTER XVII    THE ENEMY PLOT MISCHIEF      The most disgusted cadet on Pine Island was Lew Flapp, and when Jackson  walked out of the water and entered one of the bath-tents he followed  his crony with a face full of bitterness.    \"Why didn't you try to keep up and win out\"? he asked bitterly, while  Jackson was dressing.    \"I did try. But Rover came up like a steam engine.\"    \"You seemed to play out all in a minute.\"    \"And that is just what I did do. The pace was too hot for me, and I  just about collapsed. Those fellows are good swimmers, no two ways  about that.\"    \"Bah! I could have beaten them with ease.\"    \"I'd like to see you do it.\"    \"Do you know I lost six dollars on that race,\" went on Flapp, after a  pause.    \"Who won the money\"?    \"Songbird Powell.\"    \"How did you come to put up such an odd figure, Lew\"?    \"I bet a dollar even first, and then, when I felt certain you would  win, I gave him odds of five to one. I was a chump.\"    \"Well, I did my best--honestly I did,\" returned Jackson, who hated to  have his crony lose.    \"I ought to make you pay me back.\"    \"I'd do it if I had the money,\" said Jackson. He rarely had money in  his pocket, spending everything as fast as received.    \"Well, that is one more we owe that crowd,\" observed Flapp with  increased bitterness.    When Jackson was dressed he and Flapp took themselves to another part  of the camp, and there met Pender, Rockley, and Ben Hurdy.    \"Let us take a walk,\" said Jackson. \"I am sick of staying around where  the others can stare at me.\"    \"Come with me,\" put in Pender. \"I have found something I want to show  you.\"    \"A gold mine, perhaps,\" said Flapp. \"I need one just now. Betting on  Jackson nearly cleaned me out.\"    \"It's no gold mine, but it may prove useful to us,\" answered the other  cadet.    The crowd started off, and Pender led the way through the woods and  partly around the rocky hill in the center of the island.    \"I ran into it quite by accident,\" he said. \"You'd never suspect it was  there unless you knew of it.\"    \"Knew of what?\" asked Rockley. \"What sort of a mystery are you running  us into now?\"    \"Just wait and see.\"    Pender stepped from the path they had been pursuing and pushed aside  some overhanging bushes. Beyond was a small clearing, backed up by a  high, rocky wall. In the wall was an opening, blocked up by a heavy  door secured by a rusty iron chain that was passed through a ring in  the rocks.    \"Well, this is certainly odd,\" exclaimed Flapp. \"What kind of a place  is it\"?    \"It's a den of some sort,\" said Hurdy. \"Maybe some counterfeiters  belong here.\"    \"Bosh, you talk as if you were in a dime novel,\" came from Jackson.  \"More than likely some old hermit lived here. When some men get queer  in the head they come to just such a spot as this to end their days.  They hate the sight of other human beings.\"    \"I reckon it is a hermit's den,\" said Pender. \"But if so the hermit  left it years ago, for everything inside is covered with dust and  cobwebs and mildew.\"    Pender walked up to the stout wooden door, unfastened the iron chain,  and threw the barrier back.    One after the other the boys entered the opening beyond. At first they  could see but little, but gradually their eyes became accustomed to the  gloom and they made out a rocky chamber about twelve feet wide and  running back in irregular shape for a hundred feet or more. At some  points the ceiling was so low they had to stoop, while elsewhere it was  far above their reach. The flooring was fairly level, with rock in some  places and hard dirt in others.    The opening was rudely furnished with a heavy table and a bench, and  close to one wall was a box bed, still filled with pine boughs. On a  big wooden hook hung a man's coat, so decayed that it began to fall  apart when they touched it. The table contained several tin cups and  plates, all rust eaten.    \"This is certainly a curious find,\" said Flapp. \"How did you happen to  hit it, Gus?\"    \"I was exploring the cliff above when I happened to slip and fall into  the bushes just in front of the door. I was shook up but not hurt, and  when I got up I saw the door and wondered what it meant. Then I looked  inside and after that went back to camp to tell you fellows about it.\"    \"It will make a dandy place for secret meetings,\" suggested Rockley.  \"We can come here and do what we please.\"    \"Just what I thought,\" said Pender. \"We can smuggle no end of good  things here from the nearest village and come whenever we have our off  time.\"    \"Perhaps we can do more than that,\" said Flapp, struck with a sudden  idea.    \"What\"? asked the others.    \"I'll tell you some other time. It's a great find,\" continued the tall  boy.    In the meantime those left at the camp had surrounded Dick and were  congratulating him on his victory.    \"I knew you would win,\" said Powell, when the excitement was over. \"I  bet with Lew Flapp on the result. Garling was stakeholder.\"    \"What did you win, Songbird\"?    \"Six dollars.\"    \"Gracious! You went in pretty deep.'    \"Flapp called me a coward when I told him I didn't want to bet, so I  had to take him up,\" went on Songbird. \"Had it been anybody else I  might have given the money back. But I won't give it back to that  bully.\"    \"It's against the rules to bet, Songbird.\"    \"But you are not going to tell on me, are you?\"    \"You know me better than to ask the question. Just the same, I am sorry  you bet,\" said Dick.    \"I'm going to treat the boys as soon as I get the chance,\" went on  Powell. \"Six dollars will buy a whole lot of ice cream and cake, not to  mention soda and candy and peanuts.\" And then he began to hum to  himself:       \"Peanuts and candy and raspberry ice,      Chocolate cake, and all that's nice,      Ev'ry student can come if he will,      And ev'ry student can eat his fill!\"    \"I believe you'd sing at a funeral,\" said Dick, laughing.    \"I wouldn't sing at my own funeral,\" answered Powell, and stalked off,  humming as gayly as ever.    The remainder of the day passed quietly enough, although by the  whispering in various tents it was easy to see that something unusual  was in the air.    \"Hazing to-night, as sure as guns,\" said Major Larry to one of the  officers.    \"Shall we arrest the hazers\"? asked the officer, with a twinkle in his  eye.    \"You must obey orders,\" answered the youthful major, non-committally,  since he had given no orders on the subject.    He could well remember his first year in camp, when he had been dragged  from his cot at midnight, almost stripped, and thrown into a brook of  icy spring water, and then made to run over a rough road in his bare  feet for half a mile, \"just to warm up,\" as the hazers told him. It  was rough sport, not to be approved, but \"boys will be boys,\" and it  is practically impossible to stop hazing even in the highest of our  institutions of learning.    It was poor Hans Mueller who was the first to suffer that night. In the  midst of the darkness, for there was no moon, Hans found himself  suddenly aroused from his slumbers by being dragged out of his cot by  the feet.    \"Shtop!\" he began, when a hand was thrust over his mouth. Then he was  raised up by six cadets, shoved out of the back of the tent and carried  away to the grove in the rear of the camp. The party had to pass two  sentries, but the sentries were evidently posted, for they appeared to  see nothing wrong.    Hans was not allowed to speak until he was out of hearing distance of  the camp. Then he was dumped on the ground with a dull thud.    \"Mine cracious! vot does dis mean annahow\"? he demanded, as he  struggled to his feet. \"Does you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#15)"],[1,"Acts in the year  1888, less than one half (45 per cent.) were charged with begging; the  other offences consisted principally in prostitution, in having  implements of housebreaking, in frequenting places of public resort to  commit felony, in being found on enclosed premises for unlawful  purposes. In all these cases, with the exception of prostitution, it  is not probable that destitution had much, if anything, to do with  inducing the offenders to violate the law. Men who live the life of  incorrigible rogues, who prowl about enclosed premises, who lead a  mysterious existence, without doing any work, are not to be classed  among the destitute; as a general rule, such persons are habitual  thieves and vagabonds, who persist in the life they have adopted  merely because it suits them best. One of the great difficulties in  dealing with persons of this stamp is their hatred of a well-ordered  existence; in a vast number of cases the life they live is the only  kind of life they thoroughly enjoy; it is a profound mistake to  imagine that they are pining for what are usually regarded as the  decencies and comforts of human beings. Nothing is further from their  thoughts. Let us alone and mind your own business is the secret  sentiment and often the open avowal of most of these people. \"We  should be miserable living according to your ideas; let us live  according to our own.\" It is very common for benevolent people to  assume that the objects of their compassion and solicitude are, in  reality, as wretched as they imagine them to be. Living themselves in  ease, and it may be affluence, and surrounded by all the amenities of  existence, it is difficult for them to realise that multitudes can  enjoy a rude kind of happiness in the absence of all this. Such,  however, is the fact. The vagabond class is not more miserable than  any other; it is, of course, not without its sorrows, vicissitudes,  and troubles, but what section of the community is free from these  ills? This class has even a philosophy adapted to its circumstances,  the fundamental articles of which have been once for all summed up in  the lines of Burns:--      \"Life is all a variorum;      We regard not how it goes,    Let them cant about decorum      Who have characters to lose.\"    What has just been said respecting the loafing, thieving vagabond  applies in a very great measure to the ordinary beggar. The habitual  beggar is a person who will not work. He hates anything in the shape  of regular occupation, and will rather put up with severe hardships  than settle down to the ordinary life of a working-man. It would be  easy to adduce instances to demonstrate the accuracy of what is here  stated. It would be easy to mention cases by the hundred, in which men  addicted to begging have been thoroughly fitted out and started in  life, but all to no purpose. Once a man fairly takes to begging, as a  means of livelihood, it is almost hopeless attempting to cure him.  After a time he loses the capacity for labour; his faculties, for want  of exercise, become blunted and powerless, and he remains a beggar to  the end of his days. It sometimes happens that the beggar who has  taken to mendicancy as a profession is obliged to go to the workhouse  as a kind of temporary refuge. This is not so frequent considering the  sort of life a vagrant has to lead; but when it does occur, the  labour-master of the Union very often finds it next to impossible to  got him to perform the task every able-bodied person is expected to  complete when taking shelter in a Casual Ward. As a result the  habitual beggar has sometimes to appear before the magistrates as a  refractory pauper, but a short sentence of imprisonment, which usually  follows, has lost all its terrors for him; he prefers enduring it to  doing the task allotted to him at the workhouse.    From this it will be seen that habits of indolence, and not the stress  of destitution, are responsible for a great deal of the begging which  goes on in England; but these habits are not answerable for the whole  of it. When times are bad begging has a decided tendency to increase,  and this arises from the fact that a considerable proportion of the  community possess wonderfully few resources within themselves. Even in  depressed times it is astonishing how well men who can turn their  hand, as it is called, can manage to live. Men of this stamp are not  beaten and rendered helpless by the misfortune of losing their usual  employment; they are capable of devising fresh methods of earning a  livelihood; they are persistent, persevering, energetic; they are not  content to stand by with their hands in their pockets and their back  at the wall; at times they even create an occupation, and devise new  wants for the community. Such men exist in large numbers among the  working population, and are able to tide over periods of slackness and  depression in a truly admirable way. But there are others who are  utterly lost the moment trade ceases to flourish. As soon as they lose  the job they have been accustomed to work at they at once sink into a  condition of complete helplessness; knowing not which way to move or  what steps to take; in a very short time they are to be found  soliciting alms in the streets. It is a very serious matter when such  persons are reduced to these straits. With the advent of better times  it is often very difficult to enrol them once again in the ranks of  industry. Bad habits have been acquired, self-respect has broken down,  the mind has become accustomed to a lower plane of existence; the  danger has arisen that persons who were to begin with only beggars by  accident may end by becoming beggars from choice. This is what  actually does happen in some instances, and especially where the level  of life and comfort has at all times been low. The transition from the  one state to the other is not a very pronounced one, and the step into  the position of a habitual beggar is not hard to take after a certain  number of lessons in the mendicant's art have once been learnt. In one  sense it is the pressure of want which has made these people beggars,  in another sense it is their own apathy and feebleness of resource.    It is not easy to estimate the number of persons who become habitual  mendicants in consequence of slackness of work and the temporary loss  of employment. As a matter of fact the whole body of statistical  information bearing upon vagrancy is rather unreliable in character,  and it is difficult to see how it can be anything else. In almost all  cases of begging the initiative is taken by the police; it very seldom  happens that a private citizen gives a beggar in charge. The regular  and systematic enforcement of the Vagrancy Acts by the public  authorities is impeded by a variety of causes, each of which makes it  difficult to grasp accurately the proportions of the begging  population. In the first place no two policemen enforce the law with  the same stringency; one is inclined to be lax and lenient, while  another will not allow a single case to escape. In some districts  chief constables do not care to bring too many begging cases before  the local magistrates; in other districts chief constables are zealous  for the rooting out of vagrancy. In some counties the magistrates  themselves are not so anxious to convict for vagrancy as they are in  others; where the latter tendency prevails, the police take their cue  from the magistrates and comparatively few offences against the  Vagrancy Acts are brought up for trial. Again, there are times when  the public have fits of indulgence towards beggars, which are  counterbalanced at other periods by a corresponding access of  severity; these oscillations of public sentiment are immediately felt  by the executive authorities. The conduct of policemen and magistrates  towards the begging fraternity is largely shaped by the dominant  public mood, and the statistics of vagrancy move up and down in  sympathy with it. Thus it comes to pass that the variations which take  place in the annual statistics of vagrancy do not necessarily  correspond with the growth or diminution of the number of persons  following this mode of life; the actual number of such persons in the  population may in reality be varying very little or, perhaps,  remaining stationary, whilst official statistics are pointing to the  conclusion that important changes are going on. In short, the  statistics of vagrancy are more useful as affording a clue to the  state of public sentiment with respect to this offence than as  offering an accurate test of the extent to which vagrancy prevails.    After this explanation it will be seen how difficult it is, in the  first place, to estimate the exact numbers of the vagrant population;  and, in the next place, the exact proportion of beggars who have been  driven into the ranks of vagrancy, as a result of bad trade and  inability to obtain work. My own impression is, that the number of  persons who are forced to beg for want of work is not large, and they  consist, for the most part, of men beyond middle life or verging upon  old age. There are two causes at present in operation in England which  often press hard upon such men. The first of these causes is one which  was felt more severely twenty or thirty years ago than at the present  moment--I moan the introduction of machinery into industries formerly  carried on to a large extent by hand. One of the most conspicuous  characteristics of the present century is the ever-increasing extent  to which inventions of all kinds have invaded almost every department  of industry. As far as the young are concerned, those inventions have  been on the whole a benefit, and what used to be hard work has become,  as Professor Alfred Marshall recently said, merely looking on. But the  case stands differently with workmen who are surprised by some new  invention at a period of life when the"]]]
