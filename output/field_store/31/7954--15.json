On the other side it is said,  with equal vehemence, that the coloured people are mongrels, unfit to  mingle with the pure parental breeds, and that this is proved by their  excessive fecundity. The coloured people are also accused of being  inferior in physical constitution when compared with either of the  parent races, and therefore undesirable.    My own observations, corroborated by the opinions of many other  observers, leads me to believe that the fecundity of the coloured people  is neither greater nor less than that of other people--white, black or  yellow--whose birthrate is not artificially restricted, and that their  general physical constitution, when not undermined by disease or stunted  by underfeeding, is as strong as that of any other human variety. The  great naturalist, Wallace, has insisted that some degree of difference  favours fertility, but that a little more tends to infertility, and by  applying this hypothesis to the facts as I have observed them I am led  to believe that there is no biological difference between the Bantu and  the European of a degree sufficient to produce any difference, one way  or the other, in the fertility of the offspring of the two races, but  proper statistics, continued over several generations, will, of course,  be required to prove or disprove this conclusion.    The gravest, and, as I think, the most unjust of the many charges  brought against these people by an unthinking public, is that the  half-caste, wherever he is found, partakes of all the vices but of none  of the virtues of his parents. When we remember that in the towns of  South Africa the coloured people of necessity form the class that in the  nature of things is peculiarly exposed to the temptations of  prostitution and crime, then it becomes a matter for wonder that these  people are as good and as law-abiding as indeed they are. People who  know South Africa will admit that the coloured girl is from childhood  exposed to the temptation of loose-living far more than either the  Native girl in the kraal or the European girl in her home, and that the  coloured boys and youths, by reason of the lack of the right kind of  home-influence, which is the result of the unfavourable position in  life of the bulk of their parents, naturally gravitate towards the  levels where it becomes difficult to avoid crime. But despite all these  adverse conditions that press so heavily against them the coloured  people of South Africa, taken as a whole, stand justified of the  calumnies uttered against them. The coloured people as a whole are not  behind the whites in anything except in the lack of opportunity for  education and self-improvement, a lack caused not by themselves, but by  their inimical surroundings.    That many of the coloured people are immoral and shiftless need not be  denied; the same may be said about the \"poor whites,\" who as a class  perplex well-meaning legislators, but neither of these proved  accusations give reason for thinking that either of these classes is  inherently inferior to their more favourably-placed fellow-beings. We  must always remember the tremendous handicap of being reared in the  depressing surroundings of sloth and squalor. I have seen hundreds of  poor whites--as white as any blond German could wish to be--who seemed  utterly unfit for the complexities of civilised life, but I have also  seen many of the children of these people who, after being removed from  their home surroundings, have risen to positions of usefulness and  trust, in which they have earned reputations for integrity and capacity.  The trenchant saying of a British working-man is in point, \"Treat a man  like a dog and he will behave like a dog,\" and the corollary is equally  true, that if you treat a man as a man he will, as a rule, rise and quit  himself like a man.    The familiar cry that once white blood is diluted with black it is \"all  up\" with our civilisation is not convincing when we remember that the  ground-work of this civilisation was built up by races that were not  \"pure white\"; that the white civilisation during the dark ages sank to a  very low level through no dilution of African blood, and that it was a  mixed race, the Moors, who brought back into Europe the lost principles  of Aristotelian science on which the crumbling structure of European  culture was rebuilt. To believe that the people of Asia and of Africa  may be capable of attaining to Western civilisation, but that the  offspring produced by the crossing of these races with whites will not  have the necessary capacity therefor is to me impossible. So far from  being deterrent to mental growth it would seem that an infusion of  African blood in the European serves rather to increase mental capacity;  at any rate, those who know South Africa well will not deny that an  unmistakable tincture of African blood in a white family is often  associated with marked intellectual ability. Against this concession it  has indeed been alleged that, while it must be admitted that a small  admixture of black blood in a white race enriches it, a small admixture  of white blood in a black race degrades it, but this fanciful notion has  not been supported by scientific data. The truth of the matter is that  as the blacks are the underdogs, the half-breed becomes a racial and  social bastard, as indeed he is openly named in South Africa, a man  condemned before he is tried, handicapped from birth in a way that would  drag down and keep under most of those who shout loudest about their  racial superiority. It is his condition and not his nature that keeps  the coloured man underneath.    To the man who in face of the facts of history and of to-day believes  that all we have of civilisation we owe to the Teutonic or to the  Nordic type of man, and that nothing good can ever come out of coloured  Nazareths, the possibility of the whites in South Africa becoming  browned by the selective agency of tropical light or by an infusion of  African blood, no doubt, seems an evil to be prevented at any cost, but  those who, like myself, have seen coloured women working in their homes  as thriftily and self-sacrificingly as the best of our own women, and  coloured men labouring steadily against heavy odds to improve their  condition, have become convinced that the coloured people of South  Africa suffer under no inherent disabilities when compared with the  whites, and for this reason we cannot join in the general wail over a  predicted evil which we regard as exaggerated in itself and not,  moreover, likely to happen. I would not, however, be taken to advocate  the inter-breeding of white and black. Those who have witnessed the  misery and suffering which the coloured people have to endure for being  coloured will welcome any fair means of preventing miscegenation in  South Africa. Proscriptive legislation has been advocated by both the  detractors and the defenders of the half-breed, as a means of  preventing what both schools, for their different reasons, regard as  wrong and undesirable, but I cannot agree that it can ever be right or  expedient to penalise and make criminal a natural act which under  existing conditions is in many places unavoidable.    There can be no doubt that the evil of miscegenation in South Africa has  been greatly exaggerated, both in respect of its nature and its extent,  but, nevertheless, so long as the racial prejudice of the white man  remains as strong as it is to-day--and there is nothing to show that it  is likely to decrease in the future--so long will it be the duty of all  good citizens to discourage by persuasion and precept the production of  children for whom the ruling race has no love and little pity. Even  those among the whites who, in a spirit of good will and tolerance urge  that the coloured people should receive preferential treatment because  of the white blood which is in them, cannot escape having their point of  view warped by their racial prepossession, for, surely, it is not  because of a man's class or colour that he is treated as a man to-day  but because of his being a civilised member of a civilised community.  Nevertheless, the day when civilisation shall be the sole qualification  for full membership of the civilised community of South Africa is not  yet.    I say, therefore, in answer to the question whether, without the full  fraternity which seems impossible here, the white and the black races  may not live together in South Africa in political liberty and equality,  that the trend of events leads to the belief that the established pride  of race of the whites, and the growing pride of race among the Natives  will conduce to voluntary separation wherever this is possible, and that  in this way the coming generations will contrive to live territorially  separate under a common governance, founded upon political equality and  liberty.      CONCLUSION.    The evidence before us leads inevitably to the conclusion that there is  nothing in the mental constitution, or in the moral nature of the South  African Native, to warrant his relegation to a place of inferiority in  the land of his birth, but the same evidence also leads to the  conclusion that the racial antipathy which prevails to-day will remain  unaffected by this admission, seeing that this racial animosity is  caused not by alleged mental disparity but by unalterable physical  difference between the two races.    It is important that this distinction be grasped for it goes to the root  of the matter. It is the marked physical dissimilarity of the black man  that rouses the fear and jealousy of the white man, and not any inherent  mental inferiority in him. And we must take human nature as we find it,  inscrutable and immutable as it is; wherefore we must reckon with, and  not hastily condemn, the imponderable purpose of a fundamental instinct  which is older"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14909"],[0,"Elsie's New Relations (#15)"],[1,"it. \"Why, no, she's not there!\" he said in  wonder and disappointment. \"Ah, yonder she is! behind that window  curtain,\" as \"cluck, cluck cluck,\" came from a distant corner. \"Max, Max,  catch her quick, 'fore she gets away!\"    Max ran and hastily drew aside the curtain.    There was nothing there, as Walter, Lulu and Gracie, who had all rushed to  the spot, perceived with amazement.    \"Hark!\" said Mr. Dinsmore, and as a death-like silence fell upon the room  the \"cluck, cluck, cluck\" was distinctly heard from the hall.    Out rushed the children and searched its whole length, but without finding  the intruder.    Back they came to report their failure. Then dogs, big and little, barked  and growled, now here, now there, little pigs squealed, cats meowed, and  mice squealed from the corners, under sofas and chairs, in the ladies'  laps, in the gentlemen's pockets, yet not one could be seen.    For a while it made a great deal of sport, but at length little feeble  Gracie grew frightened and nervous, and running to \"Mamma Vi\" hid her head  in her lap with a burst of tears and sobs.    That put an end to the fun and frolic, everybody sobered down instantly  and kept very quiet, while Grandpa Dinsmore carefully explained to the  little weeper that Cousin Ronald had made all the sounds which had so  excited and alarmed her, and that there was really nothing in the room  that could hurt or annoy her.    She lifted her head at last, wiped away her tears, and with a laugh that  was half a sob, said, \"I'll stop crying, then; but I'm afraid everybody  thinks I'm a great baby.\"    \"Oh no, dear!\" said Grandma Elsie, \"we all know that if our little girlie  is easily troubled, it is because she is not well and strong like the rest  of us.\"    \"And I must beg your pardon for frightening you so, my wee bit bonny  lassie,\" said Mr. Lilburn, stroking her hair. \"I'll try to atone for it,  one o' these days, by telling you and the other bairns the finest stories  I know.\"    The promise called forth from the young folks a chorus of thanks and  exclamations of delight, Walter adding, \"Won't you please tell one now,  Cousin Ronald, to comfort Gracie?\"    \"A very disinterested request, no doubt, my little son,\" Elsie said  laughingly, as she rose and took his hand to lead him from the room; \"but  it is high time both you and Gracie were in your nests. So bid good-night,  and we will go.\"          CHAPTER XI.        \"At Christmas play, and make good cheer,       For Christmas comes but once a year.\"                             --Tusser.      It was the day before Christmas.    \"When do our holidays begin, mamma?\" asked Rosie, as she put her books  neatly away in her desk after the last morning recitation.    \"Now, my child; we will have no tasks this afternoon. Instead, I give my  five little folks an invitation to drive into the city with me. How many  will accept?\"    \"I, thank you, ma'am,\" \"and I,\" \"and I,\" came in joyous tones from one and  another, for all were in the room, and not one indifferent to the delight  of a visit to the city, especially just at this time when the stores were  so full of pretty things. Besides, who could fail to enjoy a drive with  the kind, sweet lady some of them called mamma, others Grandma Elsie?    \"Then you may all be ready to start immediately after dinner,\" she said,  glancing around upon them with a benign smile.    It was a still, bright day, mild for the season, no snow on the ground to  make a sleigh-ride possible, but the roads were good, they had fine  horses, plenty of wraps, and the ride in the softly-cushioned,  easy-rolling carriage, whose large plate-glass windows gave them a good  view of the country first, then of the streets and shop windows of the  city, was found very enjoyable.    They were not afraid to jest, laugh, and be as merry as health, freedom  from care, youthful spirits, and pleasing anticipations for the morrow  inclined them to be.    Most of the Christmas shopping had been done days before, but some orders  were left with grocers and confectioners, and Grandma Elsie treated  generously to bonbons.    She allowed her children much greater latitude in such matters than her  father had permitted her in her early years.    The Ion carriage had scarcely turned out of the avenue, on its way to the  city, when one of the parlors became the scene of great activity and  mirth. A large Christmas tree was brought in and set up by the men  servants; then Lester and his Elsie, Violet, Edward and Zoe proceeded to  trim it.    That done they gave their attention to the adorning with evergreens the  walls of that and several other rooms, completing their labors and closing  the doors upon the tree some time before the return of the children.    \"We shall have scarcely more than time to dress for tea,\" Grandma Elsie  said, as the carriage drew up at the door; \"so go directly to your rooms,  my dears. Are you very tired, little Gracie?\"    \"No, ma'am, just a wee bit,\" said the child. \"I'm getting so much  stronger, and we've had such a nice time, Grandma Elsie.\"    \"I'll carry you up-stairs, little missy,\" said Tom, the servant man, who  opened the door for them, picking her up as he spoke.    \"Bring her in here, Tom,\" Violet said, speaking from the door of her  dressing-room. \"And will you come in too, Lulu dear?\"    Violet was very careful never to give Lulu an order; her wishes when  addressing her were always expressed in the form of a request.    Lulu complied at once, Tom stepping back for her to enter first.    She was in high good-humor, having enjoyed her drive extremely.    \"Mamma Vi,\" she exclaimed, \"we've had a splendid time! It's just  delightful to be taken out by Grandma Elsie.\"    \"Yes; I have always found it so,\" said Violet. \"And how has your papa's  baby girl enjoyed herself?\" drawing Gracie toward her, as Tom set her  down, and taking off her hat.    \"Oh, ever so much! Mamma how beautiful you look! I wish papa was here to  see you.\"    \"That's just what I was thinking,\" said Lulu. \"You _are_ beautiful, Mamma  Vi, and then you always wear such very pretty and becoming things.\"    \"I am glad you approve my taste in dress,\" Violet said, laughing. \"And  what do you think of those?\" with a slight motion of her hand in the  direction of the bed.    Both little girls turned to look, then with a little cry of surprise and  delight hastened to give a closer inspection to what they saw there--two  pretty dresses of soft, fine white cashmere, evidently intended for them,  each with sash and ribbons lying on it, Lulu's of rose pink, Gracie's a  delicate shade of blue.    \"O Mamma Vi! are they for us?\" exclaimed Lulu.    \"They were bought and made expressly for my two dear little girls; for  them to wear to-night,\" said Violet. \"Do they suit your taste, dears?\"    \"They are just beautiful, my dear, sweet, pretty mamma,\" cried Gracie,  running to her and half smothering her with hugs and kisses.    \"There, pet, that will do,\" said Violet, laughing, as she returned a  hearty kiss, then gently disengaged the child's arms from her neck; \"we  must make haste to array you in them before the tea-bell rings,\" and  taking Gracie's hand, she led her toward the bed.    Lulu was standing there smoothing down the folds of her new dress, and  noting, with a thrill of pleasure, how prettily the rich sash and ribbons  contrasted with its creamy whiteness. \"Mamma Vi,\" she said, looking up  into her young stepmother's face, her expression a mixture of penitence  and gratitude, \"how good you and Grandma Elsie are to me! Indeed,  everybody here is good to me; though I--I'm so bad-tempered.\"    \"You have been very good of late, dear,\" Violet said, bending down to kiss  her forehead, \"and it is a dear delight to me to do all I can to make my  husband's children happy.\"    Agnes now came to Violet's assistance, and when the tea-bell rang, a few  minutes later, the two little girls were quite ready to descend with their  mamma to the supper-room.    Grandma Elsie looked in on her way down, and Violet said, sportively,  \"See, mamma, I have my dolls dressed.\"    \"Yes,\" Elsie returned, with a smile, \"you were always fond of dressing  dolls,\" and, passing a hand over Gracie's curls and touching Lulu's cheek  caressingly with the other, \"these are better worth it than any you have  had heretofore.\"    \"Grandma Elsie,\" said Lulu in her fearless, straightforward way, and  gazing with earnest, affectionate scrutiny into the fair face, \"you don't  look as if you could be mother to Mamma Vi and Aunt Elsie and Uncle  Edward.\"    \"Why, my child?\" laughed the lady addressed; \"can't you see a  resemblance?\"    \"Oh, yes, ma'am! but you look so young, not so very much older than they  do.\"    They were now passing through the upper hall. Walter had hold of his  mother's hand, and Rosie had just joined them.    \"That is true,\" she remarked, and I am so glad of it! I couldn't bear to  have my dear, beautiful mamma grow old, and wrinkled, and gray.\"    \"Yet it will have to be some day, Rosie, unless she is laid away out of  sight before the time comes for those changes,\" the mother answered with  gentle gravity.    There were various exclamations of surprise and pleasure from the children  as they entered the supper-room. Its walls were beautifully trimmed with  evergreens, and bouquets of hot-house flowers adorned the table, filling  the air with delicious fragrance.    When the meal was over, all adjourned to the parlor usually occupied by  them when not entertaining company. This, too, they found trimmed with  evergreens, and while the children were looking about and commenting upon  the taste displayed in their arrangement, the folding doors communicating  with another parlor were suddenly thrown open, disclosing the grand  achievement of the afternoon--the beautiful Christmas tree--tall,  wide-spreading, glittering with lights and tinsel ornaments, gorgeous with  gay colors, and every branch loaded down"]]]
