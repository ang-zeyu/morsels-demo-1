Come  in and tell us what to do.\"    \"Oh, he'll be all right,\" declared Mr. Damon, adding his assurances to  Tom's.    They found Mrs. Nestor verging on an attack of hysteria. Though Mr.  Nestor often went out during the evening, he seldom stayed late.    \"And he said he'd be right back if he found you weren't at home, Tom,\"  said Mrs. Nestor. \"I'm sure I don't know what can be keeping him!\"    \"It's too soon to get worried yet,\" replied the young inventor  cheerfully. \"I'll wait a little while, and then, if he doesn't come,  Mr. Damon and I will go back over the road and look carefully. He may  have had a slight fall--sprained his ankle or something like that--and  not be able to ride. We came by the turnpike, a road he probably  wouldn't take on his wheel. He's all right, you may be sure of that.\"    Tom tried to speak reassuringly, but somehow, he did not believe  himself. He was beginning to think more and more how strange it was  that Mr. Nestor did not return home.    \"We'll wait just a bit longer before setting out on a search,\" he told  Mary and her mother. \"But I'm sure he will be along any minute now.\"    They went into the library, Mary and her mother, Tom and Mr. Damon. And  there they sat waiting. Tom tried to entertain Mary and Mrs. Nestor  with an account of his trial trip in the Air Scout, but the two women  scarcely heard what he said.    All sat watching the clock, and looking from that to the telephone,  which they tried to hope would ring momentarily and transmit to them  good news. Then they would listen for the sound of footsteps or bicycle  wheels on the gravel walk. But they heard nothing, and as the seconds  were ticked off on the clock the nervousness of Mrs. Nestor increased,  until she exclaimed:    \"I can stand it no longer! We must notify the police--or do something!\"    \"I wouldn't notify the police just yet,\" counseled Tom. \"Mr. Damon and  I will start out and look along the road. If it should happen, as will  probably turn out to be the case, that Mr. Nestor has met with only a  simple accident, he would not like the notoriety, or publicity, of  having the police notified.\"    \"No, I am sure he would not,\" agreed Mary. \"Tom's way is best, Mother.\"    \"All right, just as you say, only find my husband,\" and Mrs. Nestor  sighed, and turned her head away.    \"Even if Mr. Nestor had had a fall,\" reasoned Tom, \"he could call for  help, and get some one to telephone, unless--\"    And as he reasoned thus Tom Swift gave a mental start at his own use of  the word \"help.\"    That weird cry on the lonely meadow came back to him with startling  distinctness.    \"Come on, Mr. Damon!\" cried Tom, in a voice he tried to make cheerful.  \"We'll find that Mr. Nestor is probably walking along, carrying his  disabled bicycle instead of having it carry him.  We'll soon have him  safe back to you,\" he called to the two women.    \"I wish I could go with you, and help search,\" observed Mary.    \"Oh, I couldn't bear to be left alone!\" exclaimed her mother.    \"We'll telephone as soon as we find him,\" called Tom to Mrs. Nestor, as  he and Mr. Damon again got into the runabout and started away from the  place.    \"What do you think of it, Tom?\" asked the eccentric man, when they were  once more on the road.    \"Why, nothing much--as yet,\" Tom said. \"That is, I think nothing more  than a simple accident has happened, if, indeed, it is anything more  than that he has delayed to talk to some friends.\"    \"Would he delay this long?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"And then, Tom--bless my spectacles! what of that cry we heard?  Could  that have been Mr. Nestor?\"    There! It was out! The suspicion that Tom had been trying to keep his  mind away from came to the fore. Well, he might as well race the issue  now as later.    \"I've been thinking of that,\" he told Mr. Damon. \"It might have been  Mary's father calling for help.\"    \"But we looked, Tom, near the trees, and couldn't discover anything. If  he had been calling for help--\"    Mr. Damon did not finish.    \"He may have fallen from his wheel and been hurt,\" said Tom, as he  turned the electric runabout into the highway that Mr. Nestor would,  most likely, have taken on his way from Shopton. \"Then he may have  called for help, and some autoists, passing, may have heard and taken  him away.\"    \"Yes, but where, Tom? Whoever called for help was taken away, that's  sure. But where?\"    \"To some hospital, I suppose.\"    \"Then hadn't we better inquire there? There are only two hospitals of  any account around here. The one in Shopton and the one in Waterfield.  My wife is on the board of Lady Managers there. We could call that  hospital up and--\"    \"We'll look along the road first,\" said Tom. \"If we begin to make  inquiries at the hospitals there will be a lot of questions asked, and  a general alarm may be sent out. Mr. Nestor wouldn't like that, if he  isn't in any danger. And it may turn out that he has met an old friend,  and has been talking with him all this while, forgetting all about the  passage of time.\"    They were now driving along the highway that led from the little suburb  where Mr. Nestor lived, to the main part of Shopton, just beyond which  was Tom's home. This section was country-like, with very few houses and  those placed at rather infrequent intervals. The road was a good one,  though not the main-traveled one, and Mr. Nestor, as was known,  frequently used it when he rode his bicycle, an exercise of which he  was very fond.    As Tom and Mr. Damon drove along, they scanned, as best they could in  the light from the young moon and the powerful lamps on the runabout,  every part of the highway. They were looking for some dark blot which  might indicate where a man had fallen from his wheel and was lying in  some huddled heap on the road. But they saw nothing like this, much to  their relief.    \"Do you know, Tom,\" said Mr. Damon, when they were nearing the town,  and their search, thus far, had been in vain, \"I think we're going at  this the wrong way.\"    \"Why, so?\"    \"Because Mr. Nestor may have fallen, and been hurt, and have been  carried into any one of a dozen houses along the road. In that case we  wouldn't see him. We've passed over the most lonely part of the journey  and haven't seen him. If the accident occurred near the houses his  cries would have brought some one out to help him. He is well known  around here, and, even if he were unconscious and couldn't tell who he  was, he could be identified by papers in his pockets. Then his family  would be notified by telephone.\"    \"Perhaps you are right, Mr. Damon. We may be wasting time this way.  What do you suggest?\" asked Tom.    \"That we don't delay any longer, but call up the hospitals at once. If  he isn't in either of those he must be in some house, and in such  condition that his identity cannot be established. In that event it is  a case for the police. We haven't found him, and I think we had better  give the alarm.\"    Tom Swift thought it over for a moment. Then he came to a sudden  decision.    \"You're right!\" he told Mr. Damon. \"We mustn't waste any more time. He  isn't along the road he ought to have traveled in coming from my house  to his home--that's sure. But before I call up the hospitals I want to  try out one more idea.\"    \"What's that, Tom?\"    \"I want to go to the place where we heard that cry for help.\"    \"Do you think that could have been Mr. Nestor?\"    \"It may have been. We'll go and take another look around there.  Some  man was evidently hurt there, and was taken away. We may get a clew.  The lights on the runabout will give us a better chance to look around  than we had by the little pocket lamp. We'll try there, and, if we  don't find anything, then I'll call up the hospitals.\"          CHAPTER XVI    THE LONG NIGHT      With the speedy runabout it did not take Tom Swift and Mr. Damon long  to reach the place where the Air Scout had been grounded a few hours  before, and where they had heard the cry for help. All was as dark and  as silent as when they had been there before.    But, as Tom had said, the lights from his electric runabout would give  a brilliant illumination, and these he now directed toward the clump of  trees whence the cry for help had seemed to come.    \"Doesn't appear to have been visited by any one since we were here,\"  remarked Tom, as he observed the marks of the new automobile tire in  the dust. \"Now we'll look about more carefully.\"    This they did, but they were about to give up in despair and start for  the nearest telephone to call up the hospitals, when Mr. Damon gave an  exclamation.    \"What is it?\" asked Tom.    \"Something bright and shining!\" said his companion. \"I saw it gleam in  the light of the lamps. You nearly put your foot on it, Tom. Just step  back a moment.\"    Tom did so, and the eccentric man, with another exclamation, this time  of satisfaction, reached down and picked something up from the dusty  road.    \"It's a watch!\" he exclaimed. \"A gold watch! And it's been stepped on,  evidently, or run over by an auto. Not much damaged, but the case is a  bit bent and scratched. It's stopped, too!\" he added as he held it to  his ear.    \"What time does it show?\" asked Tom.    \"Eight forty-seven,\" answered Mr. Damon, as he consulted the dial.  \"Why, Tom, that was just about when we heard the cries for help!\"    \"Yes, it must have been. Let me see that watch.\"    No sooner had the young inventor taken the timepiece into his hands  than he, too, uttered a cry of amazement.    \"Do you recognize it?\" asked Mr. Damon, in great excitement.    \"It's Mr. Nestor's watch!\" cried Tom. \"He must have fallen here, and  been hurt. It was Mr. Nestor who cried for help, and who was taken away  by the autoists. They've probably taken him to some hospital. There's  been an accident all right.\"    Tom and Mr. Damon were of one mind now in thinking that Mr. Nestor had  met with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12855"],[0,"Elizabethan Sea-Dogs: A Chronicle of Drake and His Companions (#15)"],[1,"commandment that of all men my Lord Treasurer should not know of  it.' The cautious Lord Treasurer Burleigh was against what he considered  dangerous forms of privateering and was for keeping on good terms with  Spanish arms and trade as long as possible. Mendoza, lynx-eyed  ambassador of Spain, was hoodwinked. But Doughty, the viper in Drake's  bosom, was meditating mischief: not exactly treason with Spain, but at  least a breach of confidence by telling Burleigh.    De Guaras, chief Spanish spy in England, was sorely puzzled. Drake's  ostensible destination was Egypt, and his men were openly enlisted for  Alexandria. The Spaniards, however, saw far enough through this to  suppose that he was really going back to Nombre de Dios. It did not seem  likely, though quite possible, that he was going in search of the  Northwest Passage, for Martin Frobisher had gone out on that quest the  year before and had returned with a lump of black stone from the arctic  desolation of Baffin Island. No one seems to have divined the truth.  Cape Horn was unknown. The Strait of Magellan was supposed to be the  only opening between South America and a huge antarctic continent, and  its reputation for disasters had grown so terrible, and rightly  terrible, that it had been given up as the way into the Pacific. The  Spanish way, as we have seen, was overland from Nombre de Dios to  Panama, more or less along the line of the modern Panama Canal.    In the end Drake got away quietly enough, on the 15th of November,  1577. The court and country were in great excitement over the conspiracy  between the Spaniards and Mary Queen of Scots, now a prisoner of nine  years' standing.    'THE FAMOUS VOYAGE OF SIR FRANCIS DRAKE _into the South Sea, and  therehence about the whole Globe of the Earth, begun in the year of our  Lord 1577_' well deserves its great renown. Drake's flotilla seems  absurdly small. But, for its own time, it was far from insignificant;  and it was exceedingly well found. The _Pelican_, afterwards called the  _Golden Hind_, though his flagship, was of only a hundred tons. The  _Elizabeth_, the _Swan_, the _Marigold_, and the _Benedict_ were of  eighty, fifty, thirty, and fifteen. There were altogether less than  three hundred tons and two hundred men. The crews numbered a hundred and  fifty. The rest were gentlemen-adventurers, special artificers, two  trained surveyors, musicians, boys, and Drake's own page, Jack Drake.  There was great store of wild-fire, chain-shot, harquebusses, pistols,  corslets, bows and other like weapons in great abundance. Neither had he  omitted to make provision for ornament and delight, carrying with him  expert musicians, rich furniture (all the vessels for his table, yea,  many belonging even to the cook-room, being of pure silver), and divers  shows of all sorts of curious workmanship whereby the civility and  magnificence of his native country might amongst all nations  withersoever he should come, be the more admired.'[3]    [3: The little handbook issued by Pette and Jackman in 1580, for those  whom we should now call commercial travellers, is full of 'tips' about  'Thinges to be carried with you, whereof more or lesse is to be carried  for a shewe of our commodities to bee made.' For instance:--'Kersies of  all orient couleurs, specially of stamel (fine worsted), brode cloth of  orient couleurs also. Taffeta hats. Deepe cappes for mariners. Quilted  Cappes of Levant Taffeta of divers coulours, for the night. Garters of  Silke. Girdels of Buffe and all leathers, with gilt and ungilt Buckles,  specially wast girdels. Wast girdels of velvet. Gloves of all sortes,  knit and of leather. Gloves perfumed. Shooes of Spanish leather, of  divers colours. Looking glasses for Women, great and fayre. Comes of  Ivorie. Handkerchewes, with silk of divers colours, wrought. Glasen eyes  to ride with against dust [so motor goggles are not so new, after all!].  Boxes with weightes of golde, and every kind of coyne of golde, to shewe  that the people here use weight and measure, which is a certayne shewe  of wisedome, and of a certayne government settled here.' There are also  elaborate directions about what to take 'For banketing on shipborde of  persons of credite' [and prospective customers]. 'First, the sweetest  perfumes to set under hatches to make the place smell sweete against  their coming aborde. Marmelade. Sucket [candies]. Figges barrelled.  Raisins of the Sun. Comfets that shall not dissolve. Prunes damaske.  Dried peres. Walnuttes. Almondes. Olives, to make them taste their wine.  The Apple John that dureth two yeares, to make showe of our fruites.  Hullocke [a sweet wine]. Sacke. Vials of good sweet waters, and  casting-bottels of glass, to besprinckel the gests withal, after their  coming aborde. The sweet oyle of Xante and excellent French vinegar and  a fine kind of Bisket steeped in the same do make a banketting dishe.  and a little Sugar cast in it cooleth and comforteth, and refresheth the  spirittes of man. Synomomme Water and Imperiall Water is to be had with  you to comfort your sicke in the voyage.'    No feature is neglected. 'Take with you the large mappe of London and  let the river be drawn full of shippes to make the more showe of your  great trade. The booke of the Attyre of All Nations carried with you and  bestowed in gift would be much esteemed. Tinder boxes, with steel,  flint, and matches. A painted Bellowes, for perhaps they have not the  use of them. All manner of edge tools. Note specially what dyeing they  use.' After many more items the authors end up with two bits of good  advice. 'Take with you those things that bee in the Perfection of  Goodnesse to make your commodities in credit in time to come.' 'Learn  what the Country hath before you offer your commodities for sale; for if  you bring thither what you yourself desire to lade yourself home with,  you must not sell yours deare lest hereafter you purchase theirs not so  cheape as you would.']    Sou'sou'west went Drake's flotilla and made its landfall 'towards the  Pole Antartick' off the 'Land of Devils' in 31 deg. 40' south, northeast of  Montevideo. Frightful storms had buffeted the little ships about for  weary weeks together, and all hands thought they were the victims of  some magician on board, perhaps the 'Italianate' Doughty, or else of  native witchcraft from the shore. The experienced old pilot, who was a  Portuguese, explained that the natives had sold themselves to Devils,  who were kinder masters than the Spaniards, and that 'now when they see  ships they cast sand into the air, whereof ariseth a most gross thick  fogg and palpable darkness, and withal horrible, fearful, and  intolerable winds, rains, and storms.'    But witchcraft was not Thomas Doughty's real offence. Even before  leaving England, and after betraying Elizabeth and Drake to Burleigh,  who wished to curry favor with the Spanish traders rather than provoke  the Spanish power, Doughty was busy tampering with the men. A  storekeeper had to be sent back for peculation designed to curtail  Drake's range of action. Then Doughty tempted officers and men: talked  up the terrors of Magellan's Strait, ran down his friend's authority,  and finally tried to encourage downright desertion by underhand means.  This was too much for Drake. Doughty was arrested, tied to the mast, and  threatened with dire punishment if he did not mend his ways. But he  would not mend his ways. He had a brother on board and a friend, a 'very  craftie lawyer'; so stern measures were soon required. Drake held a sort  of court-martial which condemned Doughty to death. Then Doughty, having  played his last card and lost, determined to die 'like an officer and  gentleman.'    Drake solemnly 'pronounced him the child of Death and persuaded him  that he would by these means make him the servant of God.' Doughty fell  in with the idea and the former friends took the Sacrament together,  'for which Master Doughty gave him hearty thanks, never otherwise  terming him than \"My good Captaine.\"' Chaplain Fletcher having ended  with the absolution, Drake and Doughty sat down together 'as cheerfully  as ever in their lives, each cheering up the other and taking their  leave by drinking to each other, as if some journey had been in hand.'  Then Drake and Doughty went aside for a private conversation of which no  record has remained. After this Doughty walked to the place of  execution, where, like King Charles I,       He nothing common did or mean     Upon that memorable scene.    'And so bidding the whole company farewell he laid his head on the  block.' 'Lo! this is the end of traitors!' said Drake as the executioner  raised the head aloft.    Drake, like Magellan, decided to winter where he was, in Port St. Julian  on the east coast of Patagonia. His troubles with the men were not yet  over; for the soldiers resented being put on an equality with the  sailors, and the 'very craftie lawyer' and Doughty's brother were  anything but pleased with the turn events had taken. Then, again, the  faint-hearts murmured in their storm-beaten tents against the horrors of  the awful Straits. So Drake resolved to make things clear for good and  all. Unfolding a document he began: 'My Masters, I am a very bad orator,  for my bringing up hath not been in learning, but what I shall speak  here let every man take good notice of and let him write it down; for I  will speak nothing but I will answer it in England, yea, and before Her  Majesty, and I have it here already set down.' Then, after reminding  them of the great adventure before them and saying that mutiny and  dissension must stop at once, he went on: 'For by the life of God it  doth even take my wits from me to think of it. Here is such controversy  between the gentlemen and sailors that it doth make me mad to hear it. I  must have the gentleman to haul with the mariner and the mariner with  the gentleman. I would know him that"]]]
