Its successful teaching requires more preparation  than any earlier section. The teacher is advised carefully to peruse  Channing's _Students' History_, ch. iv, and to state in simple, clear  language, the difference between the ideas on representation which  prevailed in England and in the colonies. Another point to make clear is  the legal supremacy of Parliament. The outbreak was hastened by the  stupid use of legal rights which the supremacy of Parliament placed in  the hands of Britain's rulers, who acted often in defiance of the real  public opinion of the mass of the inhabitants of Great Britain.

Advantages of the British.--At first sight it seems as if the  Americans were very foolish to fight the British. There were five or six  times as many people in the British Isles as there were in the  continental colonies. The British government had a great standing army.  The Americans had no regular army. The British government had a great  navy. The Americans had no navy. The British government had quantities  of powder, guns, and clothing, while the Americans had scarcely any  military stores of any kind. Indeed, there were so few guns in the  colonies that one British officer thought if the few colonial gunsmiths  could be bribed to go away, the Americans would have no guns to fight  with after a few months of warfare.    [Illustration: GRAND UNION FLAG. Hoisted at Cambridge, January, 1776.  The British Union and thirteen stripes,]    [Sidenote: Advantages of the Americans.]    134. Advantages of the Americans.--All these things were clearly  against the Americans. But they had some advantages on their side. In  the first place, America was a long way off from Europe. It was very  difficult and very costly to send armies to America, and very difficult  and very costly to feed the soldiers when they were fighting in America.  In the second place, the Americans usually fought on the defensive and  the country over which the armies fought was made for defense. In New  England hill succeeded hill. In the Middle states river succeeded river.  In the South wilderness succeeded wilderness. In the third place, the  Americans had many great soldiers. Washington, Greene, Arnold, Morgan,  and Wayne were better soldiers than any in the British army.    [Sidenote: The Loyalists.]    135. Disunion among the Americans.--We are apt to think of the  colonists as united in the contest with the British. In reality the  well-to-do, the well-born, and the well-educated colonists were as a  rule opposed to independence. The opponents of the Revolution were  strongest in the Carolinas, and were weakest in New England.    [Illustration: THE SIEGE OF BOSTON.]    [Sidenote: Boston and neighborhood, 1775-76.]    [Sidenote: Importance of Dorchester and Charlestown.]    136. Siege of Boston.--It was most fortunate that the British army  was at Boston when the war began, for Boston was about as bad a place  for an army as could be found. In those days Boston was hardly more than  an island connected with the mainland by a strip of gravel. Gage built a  fort across this strip of ground. The Americans could not get in. But  they built a fort at the landward end, and the British could not get  out. On either side of Boston was a similar peninsula. One of these was  called Dorchester Heights; the other was called Charlestown. Both  overlooked Boston. To hold that town, Gage must possess both Dorchester  and Charlestown. If the Americans could occupy only one of these, the  British would have to abandon Boston. At almost the same moment Gage  made up his mind to seize Dorchester, and the Americans determined to  occupy the Charlestown hills. The Americans moved first, and the first  battle was fought for the Charlestown hills.    [Illustration: A POWDER-HORN USED AT BUNKER HILL.]    [Sidenote: Battle of Bunker Hill, 1775. _Higginson_, 183-188;  _McMaster_, 129-130.]    137. Bunker Hill, June 17, 1775.--When the seamen on the British  men-of-war waked up on the morning of June 17, the first thing they saw  was a redoubt on the top of one of the Charlestown hills. The ships  opened fire. But in spite of the balls Colonel Prescott walked on the  top of the breastwork while his men went on digging. Gage sent three or  four thousand men across the Charles River to Charlestown to drive the  daring Americans away. It took the whole morning to get them to  Charlestown, and then they had to eat their dinner. This delay gave the  Americans time to send aid to Prescott. Especially went Stark and his  New Hampshire men, who posted themselves behind a breastwork of fence  rails and hay. At last the British soldiers marched to the attack. When  they came within good shooting distance, Prescott gave the word to fire.  The British line stopped, hesitated, broke, and swept back. Again the  soldiers marched to the attack, and again they were beaten back. More  soldiers came from Boston, and a third time a British line marched up  the hill. This time it could not be stopped, for the Americans had no  more powder. They had to give up the hill and escape as well as they  could. One-half of the British soldiers actually engaged in the assaults  were killed or wounded. The Americans were defeated. But they were  encouraged and were willing to sell Gage as many hills as he wanted at  the same price.

Washington in Command, July, 1775.--The Continental Congress  was again sitting at Philadelphia. It took charge of the defense of the  colonies. John Adams named Washington for commander-in-chief, and he was  elected. Washington took command of the army on Cambridge Common, July  3, 1775. He found everything in confusion. The soldiers of one colony  were jealous of the soldiers of other colonies. Officers who had not  been promoted were jealous of those who had been promoted. In the winter  the army had to be made over. During all this time the people expected  Washington to fight. But he had not powder enough for half a battle. At  last he got supplies in the following way. In the spring of 1775 Ethan  Allen and his Green Mountain Boys, with the help of the people of  western Massachusetts and Connecticut, had captured Ticonderoga and  Crown Point. These forts were filled with cannon and stores left from  the French campaigns. Some of the cannon were now dragged by oxen over  the snow and placed in the forts around Boston. Captain Manley, of the  Massachusetts navy, captured a British brig loaded with powder.  Washington now could attack. He seized and held Dorchester Heights. The  British could no longer stay in Boston. They went on board their ships  and sailed away (March, 1776).

Invasion of Canada, 1775-76.--While the siege of Boston was  going on, the Americans undertook the invasion of Canada. There were  very few regular soldiers in Canada in 1775, and the Canadians were not  likely to fight very hard for their British masters. So the leaders in  Congress thought that if an American force should suddenly appear  before Quebec, the town might "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12426"],[0,"Routledge's Manual of Etiquette (#15)"],[1,"opinions, and tastes of his  friends, will enable a judicious host to avoid many quicksands, and  establish much pleasant intercourse on the occasion of a dinner party.    The lady of the house takes the head of the table. The gentleman who  led her down to dinner occupies the seat on her right hand, and the  gentleman next in order of precedence, that on her left. The master of  the house takes the foot of the table. The lady whom he escorted sits  on his right hand, and the lady next in order of precedence on his  left.    The gentlemen who support the lady of the house should offer to  relieve her of the duties of hostess. Many ladies are well pleased  thus to delegate the difficulties of carving, and all gentlemen  who accept invitations to dinner should be prepared to render such  assistance when called upon. To offer to carve a dish, and then  perform the office unskilfully, is an unpardonable _gaucherie_. Every  gentleman should carve, and carve well.    As soon as you are seated at table, remove your gloves, place your  table napkin across your knees, and remove the roll which you find  probably within it to the left side of your plate.    The soup should be placed on the table first. Some old-fashioned  persons still place soup and fish together; but \"it is a custom more  honoured in the breach than the observance.\" Still more old-fashioned,  and in still worse taste is it to ask your guests if they will take  \"soup or fish.\" They are as much separate courses as the fish and  the meat; and all experienced diners take both. In any case, it is  inhospitable to appear to force a choice upon a visitor, when that  visitor, in all probability, will prefer to take his soup first and  his fish afterwards. All well-ordered dinners begin with soup, whether  in summer or winter. The lady of the house should help it and send  it round, without asking each individual in turn. It is as much an  understood thing as the bread beside each plate, and those who do not  choose it, are always at liberty to leave it untasted.    In eating soup, remember always to take it from the side of the spoon,  and to make no sound in doing so.    If the servants do not go round with wine the gentlemen should help  the ladies and themselves to sherry or sauterne immediately after the  soup.    You should never ask for a second supply of either soup or fish; it  delays the next course, and keeps the table waiting.    Never offer to \"assist\" your neighbours to this or that dish. The word  is inexpressibly vulgar--all the more vulgar for its affectation  of elegance. \"Shall I send you some mutton?\" or \"may I help you to  grouse?\" is better chosen and better bred.    As a general rule, it is better not to ask your guests if they will  partake of the dishes; but to send the plates round, and let them  accept or decline them as they please. At very large dinners it is  sometimes customary to distribute little lists of the order of the  dishes at intervals along the table. It must be confessed that  this gives somewhat the air of a dinner at an hotel; but it has the  advantage of enabling the visitors to select their fare, and, as  \"forewarned is forearmed,\" to keep a corner, as the children say, for  their favourite dishes.    If you are asked to take wine, it is polite to select the same as  that which your interlocutor is drinking. If you invite a lady to take  wine, you should ask her which she will prefer, and then take the  same yourself. Should you, however, for any reason prefer some other  vintage, you can take it by courteously requesting her permission.    As soon as you are helped, begin to eat; or, if the viands are too hot  for your palate, take up your knife and fork and appear to begin. To  wait for others is now not only old-fashioned, but ill-bred.    Never offer to pass on the plate to which you have been helped. This  is a still more vulgar piece of politeness, and belongs to the manners  of a hundred years ago. The lady of the house who sends your plate to  you is the best judge of precedence at her own table.    In helping soup, fish, or any other dish, remember that to overfill a  plate is as bad as to supply it too scantily.    Silver fish-knives will now always be met with at the best tables;  but where there are none, a piece of crust should be taken in the left  hand, and the fork in the right. There is no exception to this rule in  eating fish.    We presume it is scarcely necessary to remind the reader that he is  never, under any circumstances, to convey his knife to his mouth. Peas  are eaten with the fork; tarts, curry, and puddings of all kinds with  the spoon.    Always help fish with a fish-slice, and tart and puddings with a  spoon, or, if necessary, a spoon and fork.    Asparagus must be helped with the asparagus-tongs.    In eating asparagus, it is well to observe what others do, and act  accordingly. Some very well-bred people eat it with the fingers;  others cut off the heads, and convey them to the mouth upon the fork.  It would be difficult to say which is the more correct.    In eating stone fruit, such as cherries, damsons, &c., the same rule  had better be observed. Some put the stones out from the mouth into a  spoon, and so convey them to the plate. Others cover the lips with the  hand, drop them unseen into the palm, and so deposit them on the side  of the plate. In our own opinion, the last is the better way, as it  effectually conceals the return of the stones, which is certainly the  point of highest importance. Of one thing we may be sure, and that is,  that they must never be dropped from the mouth to the plate.    In helping sauce, always pour it on the side of the plate.    If the servants do not go round with the wine (which is by far  the best custom), the gentlemen at a dinner-table should take upon  themselves the office of helping those ladies who sit near them.  Ladies take more wine in the present day than they did fifty years  ago, and gentlemen should remember this, and offer it frequently.  Ladies cannot very well ask for wine, but they can always decline it.  At all events, they do not like to be neglected, or to see gentlemen  liberally helping themselves, without observing whether their fair  neighbours' glasses are full or empty. Young ladies seldom drink more  than three glasses of wine at dinner; but married ladies, professional  ladies, and those accustomed to society, and habits of affluence, will  habitually take five or even six, whether in their own homes or at the  tables of their friends.    The habit of taking wine with each other has almost wholly gone out  of fashion. A gentleman may ask the lady whom he conducted down to  dinner; or he may ask the lady of the house to take wine with him.  But even these last remnants of the old custom are fast falling into  disuse.    Unless you are a total abstainer, it is extremely uncivil to decline  taking wine if you are invited to do so. In accepting, you have only  to pour a little fresh wine into your glass, look at the person who  invited you, bow slightly, and take a sip from the glass.    It is particularly ill-bred to empty your glass on these occasions.    Certain wines are taken with certain dishes, by old-established  custom--as sherry, or sauterne, with soup and fish; hock and claret  with roast meat; punch with turtle; champagne with whitebait; port  with venison; port, or burgundy, with game; sparkling wines between  the roast and the confectionery; madeira with sweets; port with  cheese; and for dessert, port, tokay, madeira, sherry, and claret. Red  wines should never be iced, even in summer. Claret and burgundy should  always be slightly warmed; claret-cup and champagne-cup should, of  course, be iced.    Instead of cooling their wines in the ice-pail, some hosts have of  late years introduced clear ice upon the table, broken up in small  lumps, to be put inside the glasses. This is an innovation that cannot  be too strictly reprehended or too soon abolished. Melting ice can but  weaken the quality and flavour of the wine. Those who desire to drink  _wine and_ _water_ can asked for iced water if they choose, but it  savours too much of economy on the part of a host to insinuate the  ice inside the glasses of his guests, when the wine could be more  effectually iced outside the bottle.    A silver knife and fork should be placed to each guest at dessert.    If you are asked to prepare fruit for a lady, be careful to do so, by  means of the silver knife and fork only, and never to touch it with  your fingers.    It is wise never to partake of any dish without knowing of what  ingredients it is composed. You can always ask the servant who hands  it to you, and you thereby avoid all danger of having to commit the  impoliteness of leaving it, and showing that you do not approve of it.    Never speak while you have anything in your mouth.    Be careful never to taste soups or puddings till you are sure they  are sufficiently cool; as, by disregarding this caution, you may be  compelled to swallow what is dangerously hot, or be driven to the  unpardonable alternative of returning it to your plate.    When eating or drinking, avoid every kind of audible testimony to the  fact.    Finger-glasses, containing water slightly warmed and perfumed, are  placed to each person at dessert. In these you may dip the tips of  your fingers, wiping them afterwards on your table-napkin. If the  finger-glass and d'Oyley are placed on your dessert-plate, you should  immediately remove the d'Oyley to the left of your plate, and place  the finger-glass upon it. By these means you leave the right for the  wine-glasses.    Be careful to know the shapes of the various kinds of wine-glasses  commonly in use, in order that you may never put forward one for  another. High and narrow, and very broad and shallow glasses, are used  for champagne; large, goblet-shaped glasses for burgundy and claret;  ordinary wine-glasses for sherry and"]]]
