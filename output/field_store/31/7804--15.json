COLERIDGE        ACT I      SCENE I      A Room fitted up for astrological labors, and provided with  celestial Charts, with Globes, Telescopes, Quadrants, and other  mathematical Instruments--Seven Colossal Figures, representing  the Planets, each circle in the background, so that Mars and  Saturn are nearest the eye.--The remainder of the Scene, and its  disposition, is given in the Fourth Scene of the Second  Act.--There must be a Curtain over the Figures, which may be  dropped, and conceal them on occasion.    [_In the Fifth Scene of this Act it must be dropped; but in the  Seventh Scene it must be again drawn up wholly or in part._]    WALLENSTEIN _at a black Table, on which a Speculum Astrologicum  is described with Chalk_. SENI _is taking Observations through a  window_.    WALLENSTEIN.    All well--and now let it be ended, Seni. Come,  The dawn commences, and Mars rules the hour.  We must give o'er the operation. Come,  We know enough.    SENI.                   Your Highness must permit me  Just to contemplate Venus. She's now rising;  Like as a sun, so shines she in the east.    WALLENST.    She is at present in her perigee,  And now shoots down her strongest influences.                    [_Contemplating the figure on the table._]    Auspicious aspect! fateful in conjunction,  At length the mighty three corradiate;  And the two stars of blessing, Jupiter  And Venus, take between them the malignant  Slily-malicious Mars, and thus compel  Into _my_ service that old mischief-founder:  For long he viewed me hostilely, and ever  With beam oblique, or perpendicular,  Now in the Quartile, now in the Secundan,  Shot his red lightnings at my stars, disturbing  Their blessed influences and sweet aspects.  Now they have conquer'd the old enemy,  And bring him in the heavens a prisoner to me.    SENI (_who has come down from the window_).    And in a corner house, your Highness--think of that!  That makes each influence of double strength.    WALLENST.    And sun and moon, too, in the Sextile aspect,  The soft light with the vehement--so I love it;  SOL is the heart, LUNA the head of heaven;  Bold be the plan, fiery the execution.    SENI.    And both the mighty Lumina by no  Maleficus _affronted_. Lo! Saturnus,  Innocuous, powerless, _in cadente Domo_.    WALLENST.    The empire of Saturnus is gone by;  Lord of the secret birth of things is he  Within the lap of earth, and in the depths  Of the imagination dominates;  And his are all things that eschew the light.  The time is o'er of brooding and contrivance,  For Jupiter, the lustrous, lordeth now,  And the dark work, complete of preparation,  He draws by force into the realm of light.  Now must we hasten on to action, ere  The scheme and most auspicious positure  Parts o'er my head, and takes once more its flight,  For the heavens journey still, and sojourn not.                      [_There are knocks at the door._]    There's some one knocking there. See who it is.    TERZKY (_from without_).    Open, and let me in.    WALLENSTEIN.                         Ay--'tis Terzky.  What is there of such urgence? We are busy.    [Illustration: WALLENSTEIN AND TERZKY As performed at the  Municipal Theatre, Hamburg, 1906.]    TERZKY (_from without_).    Lay all aside at present, I entreat you.  It suffers no delaying.    WALLENSTEIN.    Open, Seni!    [_While_ SENI _opens the door for_ TERZKY, WALLENSTEIN  _draws the curtain over the figures_.]      SCENE II      WALLENSTEIN. COUNT TERZKY    TERZKY (_enters_).    Hast thou already heard it? He is taken.  Gallas has given him up to the Emperor.             [SENI _draws off the black table, and exit_.]    WALLENSTEIN (_to_ TERZKY).    Who has been taken? Who is given up?    TERZKY.    The man who knows our secrets, who knows every  Negotiation with the Swede and Saxon,  Through whose hands all and everything has pass'd--    WALLENSTEIN (_drawing back_).    Nay, not Sesina?--Say, No! I entreat thee.    TERZKY.    All on his road for Regensburg to the Swede  He was plunged down upon by Gallas' agent,  Who had been long in ambush, lurking for him.  There must have been found on him my whole packet  To Thur, to Kinsky, to Oxenstiern, to Arnheim:  All this is in their hands; they have now an insight  Into the whole--our measures and our motives.      SCENE III      _To them enters_ ILLO.    ILLO (_to_ TERZKY).    Has he heard it?    TERZHY.                    He has heard it.    ILLO (_to_ WALLENSTEIN).                 Thinkest thou still  To make thy peace with the Emperor, to regain  His confidence? E'en were it now thy wish  To abandon all thy plans, yet still they know  What thou hast wish'd: then forwards thou must press,  Retreat is now no longer in thy power.    TERZKY.    They have documents against us, and in hands,  Which show beyond all power of contradiction--    WALLENST.    Of my handwriting--no iota. Thee  I punish for thy lies.    ILLO.                         And thou believest,  That what this man, and what thy sister's husband,  Did in thy name, will not stand on thy reck'ning?  _His_ word must pass for thy word with the Swede,  And not with those that hate thee at Vienna?    TERZKY.    In writing thou gavest nothing--But bethink thee,  How far thou ventured'st by word of mouth  With this Sesina! And will he be silent?  If he can save himself by yielding up  Thy secret purposes, will he retain them?    ILLO.    Thyself dost not conceive it possible;  And since they now have evidence authentic  How far thou hast already gone, speak!--tell us,  What art thou waiting for? Thou canst no longer  Keep thy command; and beyond hope of rescue  Thou'rt lost, if thou resign'st it.    WALLENSTEIN.                         In the army  Lies my security. The army will not  Abandon me. Whatever they may know,  The power is mine, and they must gulp it down--  And if I give them caution for my fealty,  They must be satisfied, at least appear so.    ILLO.    The army, Duke, _is_ thine now--for this moment--  'Tis thine, but think with terror on the slow,  The quiet power of time. From open violence  The attachment of thy soldiery secures thee  Today--tomorrow: but grant'st thou them a respite  Unheard, unseen, they'll undermine that love  On which thou now dost feel so firm a footing,  With wily theft will draw away from thee  One after the other other--    WALLENSTEIN.              'Tis a cursed accident!    ILLO.    Oh! I will call it a most blessed one,  If it work on thee as it ought to do,  Hurry thee on to action--to decision.  The Swedish General--    WALLENSTEIN.            He's arrived! Know'st thou  What his commission is--    ILLO.                          To thee alone  Will he intrust the purpose of his coming.    WALLENST.    A cursed, cursed accident! Yes, yes,  Sesina knows too much, and won't be silent.    TERZKY.    He's a Bohemian fugitive and rebel,  His neck is forfeit. Can he save himself  At thy cost, think you he will scruple it?  And if they put him to the torture, will he,  Will _he_, that dastardling, have strength enough--    WALLENSTEIN (_lost in thought_).    Their confidence is lost, irreparably!  And I may act which way I will, I shall  Be and remain forever in their thought  A traitor to my country. How sincerely  Soever I return back to my duty,  It will no longer help me--    ILLO.                        Ruin thee,  That it will do! Not thy fidelity,  Thy weakness will be deemed the sole occasion--    WALLENSTEIN (_pacing up and down in extreme agitation_).    What! I must realize it now in earnest,  Because I toy'd too freely with the thought!  Accursed he who dallies with a devil!  And must I--I _must_ realize it now--  Now, while I have the power, it _must_ take place?    ILLO.     Now--now--ere they can ward and parry it!    WALLENSTEIN (_looking at the paper of signatures_).    I have the Generals' word--a written promise!  Max Piccolomini stands not here--how's that?    TERZKY.    It was--he fancied--    ILLO.                     Mere self-willedness.  There needed no such thing 'twixt him and you.    WALLENST.    He is quite right; there needed no such thing.  The regiments, too, deny to march for Flanders--  Have sent me in a paper of remonstrance,  And openly resist the Imperial orders.  The first step to revolt's already taken.    ILLO.

But as a rule the whole of the country peopled by the Serbs  was split into a number of tiny principalities always at war with one  another. Generally speaking, this country gradually became divided into  two main geographical divisions: (1) the _Pomorje_, or country _by the  sea_, which included most of the modern Montenegro and the southern halves  of Hercegovina and Dalmatia, and (2) the _Zagorje_, or country _behind the  hills_, which included most of the modern Bosnia, the western half of the  modern kingdom of Serbia, and the northern portions of Montenegro and  Hercegovina, covering all the country between the _Pomorje_ and the Save;  to the north of the _Pomorje_ and _Zagorje_ lay Croatia. Besides their  neighbours in the east and south, those in the north and west played an  important part in Serbian history even in those early days.    Towards the end of the eighth century, after the decline of the power of  the Avars, Charlemagne extended his conquests eastwards (he made a great  impression on the minds of the Slavs, whose word for king, _kral_ or  _korol_, is derived directly from his name), and his son Louis conquered  the Serbs settled in the country between the rivers Save and Drave. This  is commemorated in the name of the mass of hill which lies between the  Danube and the Save, in eastern Slavonia, and is to this day known as  _Fru[)s]ka Gora_, or French Hill. The Serbs and Bulgars fought against the  Franks, and while the Bulgars held their own, the Serbs were beaten, and  those who did not like the rule of the new-comers had to migrate  southwards across the Save; at the same time the Serbs between the rivers  Morava and Timok (eastern Serbia) were subjected by the Bulgars. With the  arrival of the Magyars, in the ninth century, a wall was raised between  the Serbs and central and western Europe on land. Croatia and Slavonia  (between the Save and the Drave) were gradually drawn into the orbit of  the Hungarian state, and in 1102, on the death of its own ruler, Croatia  was absorbed by Hungary and has formed part of that country ever since.  Hungary, aiming at an outlet on the Adriatic, at the same time subjected  most of Dalmatia and parts of Bosnia. In the west Venice had been steadily  growing in power throughout the tenth century, and by the end of it had  secured control of all the islands off Dalmatia and of a considerable part  of the coast. All the cities on the mainland acknowledged the supremacy of  Venice and she was mistress of the Adriatic.    In the interior of the Serb territory, during the eleventh and twelfth  centuries, three political centres came into prominence and shaped  themselves into larger territorial units. These were: (1) Raska, which had  been Caslav's centre and is considered the birth-place of the Serbian  state (this district, with the town of Ras as its centre, included the  south-western part of the modern kingdom of Serbia and what was the  Turkish _sandjak_ or province of Novi-Pazar); (2) Zeta, on the coast (the  modern Montenegro); and (3) Bosnia, so called after the river Bosna, which  runs through it. Bosnia, which roughly corresponded to the modern province  of that name, became independent in the second half of the tenth century,  and was never after that incorporated in the Serbian state. At times it  fell under Hungarian influence; in the twelfth century, during the reign  of Manuel Comnenus, who was victorious over the Magyars, Bosnia, like all  other Serb territories, had to acknowledge the supremacy of  Constantinople.    It has already been indicated that the Serbs and Croats occupied territory  which, while the Church was still one, was divided between two dioceses,  Italy and Dacia, and when the Church itself was divided, in the eleventh  century, was torn apart between the two beliefs. The dividing line between  the jurisdictions of Rome and Constantinople ran from north to south  through Bosnia, but naturally there has always been a certain vagueness  about the extent of their respective jurisdictions. In later years the  terms Croat and Roman Catholic on the one hand, and Serb and Orthodox on  the other, became interchangeable. Hercegovina and eastern Bosnia have  always been predominantly Orthodox, Dalmatia and western Bosnia  predominantly Roman Catholic. The loyalty of the Croatians to  Austria-Hungary has been largely owing to the influence of Roman  Catholicism.    During the first centuries of Serbian history Christianity made slow  progress in the western half of the Balkan peninsula. The Dalmatian coast  was always under the influence of Rome, but the interior was long pagan.  It is doubtful whether the brothers Cyril and Methodius (cf. chap. 5)  actually passed through Serb territory, but in the tenth century their  teachings and writings were certainly current there. At the time of the  division of the Churches all the Serb lands except the Dalmatian coast,  Croatia, and western Bosnia, were faithful to Constantinople, and the  Greek hierarchy obtained complete control of the ecclesiastical  administration. The elaborate organisation and opulent character of the  Eastern Church was, however, especially in the hands of the Greeks, not  congenial to the Serbs, and during the eleventh and twelfth centuries the  Bogomil heresy (cf. chap, 6), a much more primitive and democratic form of  Christianity, already familiar in the East as the Manichaean heresy, took  hold of the Serbs' imagination and made as rapid and disquieting progress  in their country as it had already done in the neighbouring Bulgaria;  inasmuch as the Greek hierarchy considered this teaching to be  socialistic, subversive, and highly dangerous to the ecclesiastical  supremacy of Constantinople, all of which indeed it was, adherence to it  became amongst the Serbs a direct expression of patriotism.        15    _The Rise and Fall of the Serbian Empire and the Extinction of Serbian  Independence_, 1168-1496      From 1168 the power of the Serbs, or rather of the central Serb state of  Raska, and the extent of its territory gradually but steadily increased.  This was outwardly expressed in the firm establishment on the throne of  the national Nemanja dynasty, which can claim the credit of having by its  energy, skill, and good fortune fashioned the most imposing and formidable  state the Serb race has ever known. This dynasty ruled the country  uninterruptedly, but not without many quarrels, feuds, and rivalries  amongst its various members, from 1168 until 1371, when it became extinct.    There were several external factors which at this time favoured the rise  of the Serbian state. Byzantium and the Greek Empire, to which the Emperor  Manuel Comnenus had by 1168 restored some measure of its former greatness  and splendour, regaining temporary control, after a long war with Hungary,  even over Dalmatia, Croatia, and Bosnia, after this date began  definitively to decline, and after the troublous times of the fourth  crusade (1204), when for sixty years a Latin empire was established on the  Bosphorus, never again recovered as a Christian state the position in the  Balkan peninsula which it had so long enjoyed. Bulgaria, too, after the  meteoric glory of its second empire under the Asen dynasty (1186-1258),  quite went to pieces, the eastern and northern parts falling under Tartar,  the southern under Greek influence, while the western districts fell to  Serbia. In the north, on the other hand, Hungary was becoming a dangerous  and ambitious neighbour. During the thirteenth century, it is true, the  attention of the Magyars was diverted by the irruption into and  devastation of their country by their unwelcome kinsmen from Asia, the  Tartars, who wrought great havoc and even penetrated as far as the  Adriatic coast. Nevertheless Hungary was always a menace to Serbia;  Croatia, Slavonia, and the interior of Dalmatia, all purely Serb  territories, belonged to the Hungarian crown, and Bosnia was under the  supremacy of the Magyars, though nominally independent.    The objects of the Magyars were twofold--to attain the hegemony of the  Balkan peninsula by conquering all the still independent Serb territories,  and to bring the peninsula within the pale of Rome. They were not  successful in either of these objects, partly because their wars with the  Serbian rulers always failed to reach a decision, partly because their  plans conflicted with those of the powerful Venetian republic. The  relations between Venice and Serbia were always most cordial, as their  ambitions did not clash; those of Venice were not continental, while those  of Serbia were never maritime. The semi-independent Slavonic city-republic  of Ragusa (called Dubrovnik in Serbian) played a very important part  throughout this period. It was under Venetian supremacy, but was  self-governing and had a large fleet of its own. It was the great place of  exchange between Serbia and western Europe, and was really the  meeting-place of East and West. Its relations with Serbia were by no means  always peaceful; it was a Naboth's vineyard for the rulers and people of  the inland kingdom, and it was never incorporated within their dominions.  Ragusa and the other cities of the Dalmatian coast were the home during  the Middle Ages of a flourishing school of Serbian literature, which was  inspired by that of Italy. The influence of Italian civilization and of  the Italian Church was naturally strong in the Serb province, much of  which was under Venetian rule; the reason for this was that communication  by sea with Italy was easier and safer than that by land with Serbia.
