Du Maurier told us the story of himself completely in his novels. It was  said of de Quincey that in his writings he could tell the story of his  own life and no other. This might be said of du Maurier too.    The story of his childhood, as we read it through his books, gives us  the picture of an extremely sensitive and romantic child possessed of a  great power of responding affectionately to the scenes in which he grew  up, as well as to the people who surrounded him. It is this sentiment  for place as well as for people that sometimes gives us in his books a  remarkable poetic strain--a strain like music in its caressing revival  of old associations. And we really get a very accurate idea of the  inward story of the artist when we contrast this temperamental  sensitiveness with the kind of work upon which he employed his skill  during the chief part of his career.    Everywhere in du Maurier's life we find the testimony to his sweetness  of disposition. He had the great loyalty to friends which is really  loyalty to the world at large, made up of possible friends. Friends are  not an accident, but they are made by a process of natural selection,  which, if we are wise and generous, we do not attempt to superintend.    [Illustration:    Proxy         \"As you're going to say your Prayers, Maud, _please_ mention I'm so       dreadfully tired I can't say mine to-night, but I'll be sure to       remember to-morrow!\"    _Punch's Almanack_, 1874.]    Du Maurier was optimistic, he had the genius for keeping tragedy at bay;  for enduring, for instance, such a dark cloud constantly threatening as  blindness without claiming pity. It is easy for such people to impart  charm in whatever art they practise. And it is not true, as modern  novelists and playwrights seem to imagine, that \"depth\" always implies  what is sinister, and that only the surface of life is charming. Let us  once again believe in fragrance in art. Summer is as great as winter.  Within a sweet-smelling blossom is the whole profound history of a tree  struggling to survive the vengeance of frost and gales. It is the  fragrant things of life that contain all that has been conserved through  unkind weather.    One of the chief influences in du Maurier's life was his admiration of  Thackeray. This revealed sympathy with greatness. Thackeray was one who  was greater in life than in his art, as are all the greatest artists. He  was great as a man of the world. In a short life his presence made  itself prevail everywhere in London. It requires, too, considerable  genius to live only in precisely the street and the house in London you  want to. This Thackeray managed to do; and to know only the people you  want to, as Thackeray did. This is real sovereignty.    There was a reserve about du Maurier in manner when he encountered  complete strangers. He retained the detached and distant manner with  slight acquaintances which his role of an observer in Society had taught  him. Like all those who have an exceptionally loyal friendship to give,  he could not pretend to give it to every person introduced to him. In  this he was, of course, no true Bohemian. In Bohemian circles it is the  fashion to make extravagant use of terms of endearment and to fall upon  the neck at first meetings, and men like du Maurier reserve the display  of affection for the home.    Art-critics and secretaries of Art Galleries, frame-makers and all those  whose business throws them into constant contact with living artists and  their art, know how exactly like their pictures artists always are,  their work being immediately expressive of their own fibre, coarse or  refined. Du Maurier's art reveals a marked preference for certain kinds  of people. In life too he was selective; knowing well whom he liked, and  in whom he wished to inspire regard.    The artist's family was of the small nobility of France. The name  Palmella was given him in remembrance of the great friendship between  his father's sister and the Duchess de Palmella, who was the wife of the  Portuguese Ambassador to France. The real family name was Busson; the  \"du Maurier\" came from the Chateau le Maurier, built in the fifteenth  century, and still standing in Anjou or Maine. It belonged to du  Maurier's cousins, the Auberys, and in the seventeenth century it was  the Auberys who wore the title of du Maurier; and an Aubery du Maurier,  who distinguished himself in that century, was Louis of that name,  French Ambassador to Holland. The Auberys and the Bussons married and  intermarried, the Bussons assuming the territorial name of du Maurier.    George du Maurier's grandfather's name was Robert Mathurin Busson du  Maurier, _Gentilhomme verrier_--gentleman glass-blower. Until the  Revolution glass-blowing was a monopoly of the _gentilshommes_, no  commoner might engage in the industry, at that time considered an art.  The Busson genealogy dates from the twelfth century. The novelist made  use of many of the names which occur in papers relating to his family  history, in _Peter Ibbetson_.    Du Maurier's father was a small _rentier_, deriving his income from the  family glass-works in Anjou. He was born in England, whither the  artist's grandfather had fled to escape the Revolution and the  guillotine, returning to France in 1816.    His grandmother was a bourgeoise, by name Bruaire, a descendant of Jean  Bart, the admiral. His grandfather was not rich, and while in England  mainly depended on the liberality of the British Government, which  allowed him a pension of twenty pounds a year for each member of his  family. He died a schoolmaster at Tours.    The mother of the artist was an Englishwoman married to his father at  the British Embassy in Paris, and the artist was born in Paris on March  6, 1834, in a little house in the Champs Elysees. His parents removed to  Belgium in 1863, where they stayed three years. When the child was five  they came to London, taking 1 Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone Road--the  house which had been formerly occupied by Charles Dickens. Du Maurier  remembered riding in the park, on a little pony, escorted by a groom,  who led his pony by a strap. One day there cantered past a young woman  surrounded by horsemen; at the bidding of his groom he waved his hat,  and the lady smiled and kissed her hand to him. It was Queen Victoria  with her equerries.    The father grew very poor. He was a man of scientific tastes, and lost  his money in inventions which never came to anything. After a year in  Devonshire Terrace the family had to wander again, going to Boulogne,  where they lived at the top of the Grand Rue. Here the artist said they  lived in a beautiful house, and had sunny hours and were happy.    Apropos of du Maurier's early homes, Sir Francis Burnand, in his  _Records and Reminiscences_, tells an amusing story, which, whilst of  necessity abbreviating, we shall try to give as nearly as possible in  his own words. Some members of the _Punch_ staff who, with the  proprietors, were visiting Paris during the Exhibition year of 1889,  took a drive in the neighbourhood of Passy. Du Maurier, who had not  stayed in Paris for some years, pointed out house after house as being  his birthplace. He started with the selection of a small but attractive  suburban residence, afterwards correcting himself and pointing to a  house much more attractive-looking than the first. Soon, however, the  puzzled expression which his companions had noticed in him before,  returned to his face, and he called a halt for the third time, pointing  to a large house in an extensive garden with a fountain. \"No,\" he  exclaimed with conviction, \"I was wrong. This is where I was born.  There's the fountain, there are the green shutters! and in _that_ room!\"  The party descended again and poured out libations. After the sleepy  stage of a long drive had been reached, du Maurier awoke, and, as if  soliloquising, muttered, \"No, no, I was wrong, absurdly wrong. But I see  my mistake.\" And he aroused his companions to view a fine mansion  approached by a drive.    \"Yes,\" he exclaimed, \"the other places were mistakes. It is so difficult  to remember the exact spot where one was born. But there can be no doubt  about this. _Cocher! Arretez! s'il vous plait_,\" he cried, and he was  about to open the door and descend, when William Bradbury, of the party,  stopped him.    \"No, you don't, Kiki; you've been born in three or four places already,  and we've drunk your health in every one of 'em; so we won't do it again  till you've quite made up your mind where you _were_ born.\"    In vain du Maurier protested. \"You bring us out for a holiday, you take  us about everywhere, and you won't let a chap be born where he likes.\"  But Mr. Bradbury was inexorable; the door was closed, the coachman  grinned, cracked his whip, and away they went, the party siding with Mr.  Bradbury in objecting to pulling up at every inn to toast the occasion.    Sir Francis speaks of what fun du Maurier was at such times, and of  never remembering having seen him so boyish, so \"Trilbyish\" as on the  occasion of the memorable visit.    From Boulogne du Maurier was brought by his family to Paris, to live in  an apartment on the first floor of the house No. 80 in the Champs  Elysees. In the artist's manhood the ground and first floor were a cafe,  and he said he felt sorry to look up at the windows from which his  mother used to watch his return from school, and see waiters bustling  about and his home invaded.      Section 2    He went to school at the age of thirteen, in the Pension Froussard, in  the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne. He remembered with affection his master  Froussard, who became a deputy after the Revolution of 1848.

Elsewhere, we find full-blown flowers interspersed  with buds (fig. 98), or tied together with cords (fig. 99); or those  emblematic plants which symbolise the union of Upper and Lower Egypt under  the rule of a single Pharaoh (fig. 100); or birds with human hands and  arms, perched in an attitude of adoration on the sign which represents a  solemn festival; or kneeling prisoners tied to the stake in couples, each  couple consisting of an Asiatic and a negro (fig. 101). Male and female  Niles (fig. 102), laden with flowers and fruits, either kneel, or advance  in majestic procession, along the ground level. These are the nomes, lakes,  and districts of Egypt, bringing offerings of their products to the god.  In one instance, at Karnak, Thothmes III. caused the fruits, flowers, and  animals indigenous to the foreign lands which he had conquered, to be  sculptured on the lower courses of his walls (fig. 103). The ceilings were  painted blue, and sprinkled with five-pointed stars painted yellow,  occasionally interspersed with the cartouches of the royal founder. The  monotony of this Egyptian heaven was also relieved by long bands of  hieroglyphic inscriptions. The vultures of Nekheb and Uati, the goddesses  of the south and north, crowned and armed with divine emblems (fig. 104),  hovered above the nave of the hypostyle halls, and on the under side of the  lintels of the great doors, above the head of the king as he passed through  on his way to the sanctuary. At the Ramesseum, at Edfu, at Philae, at  Denderah, at Ombos, at Esneh, the depths of the firmament seemed to open to  the eyes of the faithful, revealing the dwellers therein. There the  celestial ocean poured forth its floods navigated by the sun and moon with  their attendant escort of planets, constellations, and decani; and there  also the genii of the months and days marched in long procession. In the  Ptolemaic age, zodiacs fashioned after Greek models were sculptured side by  side with astronomical tables of purely native origin (fig. 105). The  decoration of the architraves which supported the massive roofing slabs was  entirely independent of that of the ceiling itself. On these were wrought  nothing save boldly cut inscriptions, in which the beauty of the temple,  the names of the builder-kings who had erected it, and the glory of the  gods to whom it was consecrated, are emphatically celebrated. Finally, the  decoration of the lowest part of the walls and of the ceiling was  restricted to a small number of subjects, which were always similar: the  most important and varied scenes being suspended, as it were, between earth  and heaven, on the sides of the chambers and the pylons.    [Illustration: Fig. 105.--Zodiacal circle of Denderah.]    These scenes illustrate the official relations which subsisted between  Egypt and the gods. The people had no right of direct intercourse with the  deities. They needed a mediator, who, partaking of both human and divine  nature, was qualified to communicate with both. The king alone, Son of the  Sun, was of sufficiently high descent to contemplate the god in his temple,  to serve him, and to speak with him face to face. Sacrifices could be  offered only by him, or through him, and in his name. Even the customary  offerings to the dead were supposed to pass through his hands, and the  family availed themselves of his name in the formula _suten ta hotep_ to  forward them to the other world. The king is seen, therefore, in all parts  of the temple, standing, seated, kneeling, slaying the victim, presenting  the parts, pouring out the wine, the milk, and the oil, and burning the  incense. All humankind acts through him, and through him performs its duty  towards the gods. When the ceremonies to be performed required the  assistance of many persons, then alone did mortal subordinates (consisting,  as much as possible, of his own family) appear by his side. The queen,  standing behind him like Isis behind Osiris, uplifts her hand to protect  him, shakes the sistrum, beats the tambourine to dispel evil spirits, or  holds the libation vase or bouquet. The eldest son carries the net or  lassoes the bull, and recites the prayer while his father successively  presents to the god each object prescribed by the ritual. A priest may  occasionally act as substitute for the prince, but other men perform only  the most menial offices. They are slaughterers or servants, or they bear  the boat or canopy of the god. The god, for his part, is not always alone.  He has his wife and his son by his side; next after them the gods of the  neighbouring homes, and, in a general way, all the gods of Egypt. From the  moment that the temple is regarded as representing the world, it must, like  the world, contain all gods, both great and small. They are most frequently  ranged behind the principal god, seated or standing; and with him they  share in the homage paid by the king. Sometimes, however, they take an  active part in the ceremonies. The spirits of On and Khonu[21] kneel before  the sun, and proclaim his praise. Hor, Set, or Thoth conducts Pharaoh into  the presence of his father Amen Ra, or performs the functions elsewhere  assigned to the prince or the priest. They help him to overthrow the victim  or to snare birds for the sacrifice; and in order to wash away his  impurities, they pour upon his head the waters of youth and life. The  position and functions of these co-operating gods were strictly defined in  the theology. The sun, travelling from east to west, divided the universe  into two worlds, the world of the north and the world of the south. The  temple, like the universe, was double, and an imaginary line passing  through the axis of the sanctuary divided it into two temples--the temple  of the south on the right hand, and the temple of the north on the left.  The gods and their various manifestations were divided between these two  temples, according as they belonged to the northern or southern hemisphere.  This fiction of duality was carried yet further. Each chamber was divided,  in imitation of the temple, into two halves, the right half belonging to  the south, and the left half to the north. The royal homage, to be  complete, must be rendered in the temples of the south and of the north,  and to the gods of the south and of the north, and with the products of the  south and of the north. Each sculptured tableau must, therefore, be  repeated at least twice in each temple--on a right wall and on a left wall.  Amen, on the right, receives the corn, the wine, the liquids of the south;  while on the left he receives the corn, the wine, and the liquids of the  north. As with Amen, so with Maut, Khonsu, Mentu, and many other gods. Want  of space frequently frustrated the due execution of this scheme, and we  often meet with a tableau in which the products of north and south together  are placed before an Amen who represents both Amen of the south and Amen of  the north. These departures from decorative usage are, however,  exceptional, and the dual symmetry is always observed where space permits.    [Illustration: Fig. 106.--Frieze of uraei and cartouches.]    In Pharaonic times, the tableaux were not over-crowded. The wall-surface  intended to be covered was marked off below by a line carried just above  the ground level decoration, and was bounded above by the usual cornice, or  by a frieze. This frieze might be composed of uraei, or of bunches of  lotus; or of royal cartouches (fig. 106) supported on either side by divine  symbols; or of emblems borrowed from the local cult (by heads of Hathor,  for instance, in a temple dedicated to Hathor); or of a horizontal line of  dedicatory inscription engraved in large and deeply-cut hieroglyphs. The  wall space thus framed in contained sometimes a single scene and sometimes  two scenes, one above the other. The wall must be very lofty, if this  number is exceeded. Figures and inscriptions were widely spaced, and the  scenes succeeded one another with scarcely a break. The spectator had to  discover for himself where they began or ended. The head of the king was  always studied from the life, and the faces of the gods reproduced the  royal portrait as closely as possible. As Pharaoh was the son of the gods,  the surest way to obtain portraits of the gods was to model their faces  after the face of the king. The secondary figures were no less carefully  wrought; but when these were very numerous, they were arranged on two or  three levels, the total height of which never exceeded that of the  principal personages. The offerings, the sceptres, the jewels, the  vestments, the head-dresses, and all the accessories were treated with a  genuine feeling for elegance and truth. The colours, moreover, were so  combined as to produce in each tableau the effect of one general and  prevailing tone; so that in many temples there were chambers which can be  justly distinguished as the Blue Hall, the Red Hall, or the Golden Hall. So  much for the classical period of decoration.    [Illustration: Fig. 107.--Wall of a chamber at Denderah, to show the  arrangement of the tableaux.]    As we come down to later times, these tableaux are multiplied, and under  the Greeks and Romans they become so numerous that the smallest wall  contained not less than four (fig. 107), five, six, or even eight  registers. The principal figures are, as it were, compressed, so as to  occupy less room, and all the intermediate space is crowded with thousands  of tiny hieroglyphs. The gods and kings are no longer portraits of the  reigning sovereign, but mere conventional types without vigour or life. As  for the secondary figures and accessories, the sculptor's only care is to  crowd in as many as possible. This was not due to a defect of taste, and to  the prevalence of a religious idea which decided but enforced these  changes. The object of decoration was not merely the"]]]
