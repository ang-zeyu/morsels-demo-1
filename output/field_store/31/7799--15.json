He tried to stifle it, but it followed him.  At last he made up his mind he would not go to church any more. When he  came back to Northfield, after years, his mother had died, but the text  kept coming to him over and over, and he said, 'I will not become a  Christian;' and said he to me, 'Moody, my heart is as hard as that  stone.' It was all Greek to me, because I was not a Christian myself at  the time. After my conversion, in Boston, he was about the first man I  thought of. When I got back and asked my mother about him, she told me  he was gone out of his mind, and to every one who went to the asylum to  see him he pointed his finger and said: '_Seek ye first the Kingdom, of  God and His Righteousness_.' When I went back to my native village,  after that, I was told he was still out of his mind, but at home. I went  to see him, and asked him did he know me. He was rocking backwards and  forwards in his rocking chair, and he gave me that vacant stare and  pointed to me as he said, '_Young man, seek first the Kingdom of God and  His Righteousness_.' When, last month, I laid down my younger brother in  his grave, I could not help but think of that man lying but a few yards  away. May every man and woman here be wise for eternity and seek now the  Kingdom of God and His Righteousness, is my prayer.\"      THE PRAYING SHOE-MAKER.      A correspondent of _The American Messenger_ relates this instance of a  poor man in the village where he lived, who, with a family of young  children and a wife in very feeble health, found it extremely difficult  to obtain a livelihood. He was at length compelled to work by the week  for a shoe-dealer in the city, four miles from the village, returning to  his family every Saturday evening, and leaving home early on Monday  morning.    He usually brought home the avails of his week's labor in provisions for  the use of his family during the following week; but on one cold and  stormy night, in the depth of winter, he went towards his humble  dwelling with empty hands, but a full heart. His employer had declared  himself unable to pay him a penny that night, and the shoe-maker, too  honest to incur a debt without knowing that he should be able to cancel  it, bent his weary steps homeward, trusting that He who hears the ravens  when they cry, would fill the mouths of his little family. He knew that  he should find a warm house and loving hearts to receive him, but he  knew, too, that a disappointment awaited them which would make at least  _one_ heart ache.    When he entered his cottage, cold and wet with the rain, he saw a bright  fire, brighter faces, and a table neatly spread for the anticipated  repast. The tea-kettle was sending forth its cloud of steam, all ready  for \"the cup which cheers, but not inebriates,\" and a pitcher of milk,  which had been sent in by a kind neighbor, was waiting for the bread so  anxiously expected by the children. The sad father confessed his  poverty, and his wife in tears begged him to make _some_ effort to  procure food for them before the Sabbath. He replied, \"Let us ask God to  give us our daily bread. Prayer avails with God when we ask for temporal  good, as well as when we implore spiritual blessings.\" The sorrowing  group knelt around the family altar, and while the father was entreating  fervently for the mercies they so much needed, a gentle knocking at the  door was heard. When the prayer was ended the door was opened, and there  stood a woman in the \"peltings of the storm,\" who had never been at that  door before, though she lived only a short distance from it. She had a  napkin in her hand, which contained a large loaf of bread; and half  apologizing for offering it, said she had unintentionally made \"a larger  batch of bread\" than usual that day, and though she hardly knew why, she  thought it might be acceptable there.    After expressing their sincere gratitude to the woman, the devout  shoe-maker and his wife gave thanks to God with overflowing hearts.  While the little flock were appeasing their hunger with the nice new  bread and milk, the father repaired to the house where I was an inmate,  and told his artless tale with streaming eyes, and it is unnecessary to  say, that he returned to his home that night with a basket heavily  laden, and a heart full of gratitude to a prayer-answering God.      HOW THE LORD CONTROLS EVEN THE LOCOMOTIVE AND THE RAILROAD TRAIN.      A remarkable instance of how the Lord controlled circumstances for the  detention of one train, and speeded the arrival of the other, in answer  to the prayer of a poor widow, who was in anxiety and distress, is thus  known to the editor of _The Watchman and Reflector_:    \"Not long ago an engineer brought his train to a stand at a little  Massachusetts village, where the passengers have five minutes for lunch.  A lady came along the platform and said: 'The conductor tells me the  train at the junction in P---- leaves fifteen minutes before our  arrival. It is Saturday night, that is the last train. I have a very  sick child in the car, and no money for a hotel, and none for a private  conveyance for the long, long journey into the country. What shall I  do?' 'Well,' said the engineer, 'I wish I could tell you.' 'Would it be  possible for you to hurry a little?' said the anxious, tearful mother.  'No, madam, I have the time-table, and the rules say I must run by it.'    She turned sorrowfully away, leaving the bronzed face of the engineer  wet with tears. Presently she returned and said, 'Are you a Christian?'  'I trust I am,' was the reply. 'Will you pray with me that the Lord may,  in some way, delay the train at the junction?' 'Why, yes, I will pray  with you, but I have not much faith.' Just then, the conductor cried,  'All aboard.' The poor woman hurried back to her deformed and sick  child, and away went the train, climbing the grade. 'Somehow,' says the  engineer, 'everything worked to a charm. _As I prayed, I couldn't help  letting my engine out just a little_. We hardly stopped at the first  station, people got on and off with wonderful alacrity, the conductor's  lantern was in the air in half a minute, and then away again. Once over  the summit, it was dreadful easy to give her a little more, and then a  little more, as I prayed, till she seemed to shoot through the air like  an arrow. Somehow I couldn't hold her, knowing I had the road, and so we  dashed up to the junction six minutes ahead of time.' There stood the  train, and the conductor with his lantern on his arm. 'Well,' said he,  '_will you tell me what I am waiting here for? Somehow I felt I must  wait your coming to-night, but I don't know why_.' 'I guess,' said the  brother conductor, 'it is for this woman, with her sick and deformed  child, dreadfully anxious to get home this Saturday night.' But the man  on the engine and the grateful mother think they can tell why the train  waited. God held it to answer their prayers.\"    Think of this wonderful improbability according to natural  circumstances. These trains never connected with each other, nor were  intended to. There was no message sent ahead to stop. There was not the  slightest business reason for waiting, yet the second conductor, on  arrival of the first, asks this question, \"_What am I waiting for_,\" and  the answer of the first is more singular, \"I don't know.\"      ANOTHER INSTANCE OF SUPERHUMAN CONTROL OF THE LOCOMOTIVE, IN ANSWER TO  PRAYER.      An exact parallel instance to the foregoing is given in the experience  of a correspondent of _The Christian_, which occurred in the latter part  of November, 1864, while traveling with her aged father and two small  girls:    \"We started from New Hampshire on Thursday morning, expecting to have  ample time to get through to Indiana before Saturday night; but, after  we crossed the St. Lawrence River, the next day, I think, there was a  smash-up on a freight train, which hindered our train about two hours. I  began to feel anxious, as I knew our limited means would not permit us  to stop long on the way. After the cars had started again, I inquired of  the conductor what time we should get to Toledo, fearing we should not  reach there in time for the down train. _He said it would be impossible  to gain the time._ Soon they changed conductors, and I made a similar  inquiry, getting about the same answer. Still I hoped, till we reached  the Detroit River. Here I found that, though they had put on all the  steam they dared to, they were _almost an hour behind time_, so I should  have to stay over till Sunday night.    \"After getting seated in the cars on the other side, I ventured to ask  the conductor if we should get to Toledo in time for the down train. He  readily said, '_No, madam, impossible! If we put on all the steam, we  dare to, we shall be more than half an hour behind time._ If we were on  some trains we might hope they would wait; but on this, _never! He is  the most exact conductor you ever saw. He was never known to wait a  second, say nothing about a minute, beyond the time._' I then inquired  if we could not stay at the depot. He said, No; we should all freeze to  death, for the fire is out till Sunday evening.    \"A gentleman sitting in front of us said he would show us a good hotel  near by, as he was acquainted there. I thanked him, but sunk back on my  seat. Covering my eyes with my hand, and raising my heart to God, I  said, 'O, God, if thou art my Father, and I am thy child, put it into  the heart of that conductor to wait till we get there.'    \"Soon I became calm, and fell asleep, not realizing that God would  answer my poor prayer; but, when we reached Toledo, to the astonishment  of us all, there stood the conductor, _wanting to know the reason why he  had to wait_, when our conductor told him there was a lady with her  crippled "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11565"],[0,"Friends, though divided: A Tale of the Civil War (#15)"],[1," soldier, and had  been appointed to that rank at Gloucester. The house was a massive  structure of the reign of Henry VIII.; but being built at a time when  the castellated abodes were going out of fashion, was not capable of  standing a siege, and had not indeed been put in any posture of defense.  Sir Henry was with the king, and only a few retainers remained in the  house. Prince Rupert was received at the entrance by Lady Sidmouth, who  had at her side her daughter, a girl of fourteen, whom Harry thought the  most beautiful creature he had ever seen. The prince alighted, and  doffing his broad plumed hat, kissed the lady's hand, and conducted her  into the house again, Harry doing the same to her daughter.    \"You must pardon a rough reception,\" the lady said to the prince. \"Had I  had notice of your coming, I would have endeavored to receive you in a  manner more befitting; but hearing from one of my retainers, who  happened to be in the village when you arrived, of your coming, I  thought that the accommodation--poor as it is--would be better than that  which you could obtain there.\"    Prince Rupert replied gayly, and in a few minutes they were seated at  supper. The conversation was lightly kept up, when suddenly a tremendous  crash was heard, shouts of alarm were raised, and a retainer rushed into  the hall, saying that the place was attacked by a force of Roundheads.    \"Defense is hopeless,\" the lady said, as Prince Rupert and Harry drew  their swords. \"There are but five or six old men here, and the door  appears to be already yielding. There is a secret chamber here where you  can defy their search.\"    Prince Rupert, dreading above all things to be taken prisoner, and  seeing that resistance would be, as their hostess said, vain, followed  her into an adjoining room hung with arras. Lifting this, she showed a  large stone. Beneath it, on the floor was a tile, in no way differing  from the others. She pressed it, and the stone, which was but slight,  turned on a hinge, and disclosed an iron door. This she opened with a  spring, showing a small room within, with a ladder leading to another  above.    \"Mount that,\" she said. \"You will find in the chamber above a large  stone. Pull the ladder up with you and lower the stone, which exactly  fits into the opening. Even should they discover this chamber, they will  not suspect that another lies above it.\"    Prince Rupert, taking a light from her hands, hastily mounted, followed  by Harry, and pulled the steps after him, just as they heard the iron  door close. It needed the united strength of the prince and Harry to  lift the stone, which was a large one, with an iron ring in the center,  and to place it in the cavity. Having done this, they looked round. The  room was about eight feet long by six wide, and lighted by a long narrow  loophole extending from the ground to the roof. They deemed from its  appearance that it was built in one of the turrets of the building.    \"That was a narrow escape, Master Harry,\" the prince said. \"It would  have been right bad news for my royal uncle if I had been caught here  like a rat in a trap. I wonder we heard nothing of a Roundhead force in  this neighborhood. I suppose that they must have been stationed at some  place further north, and that the news of our passing reached them. I  trust that they have no suspicion that we are in the house; but I fear,  from this sudden attack upon an undefended building, that some spy from  the village must have taken word to them.\"    Lady Sidmouth had just time to return to the hall when the doors gave  way, and a body of Roundheads burst into the room. They had drawn swords  in their hands, and evidently expected an attack. They looked round with  surprise at seeing only Lady Sidmouth and her daughter.    \"Where is the malignant Rupert?\" the leader exclaimed. \"We have sure  news that he rode, attended by an officer only, hither, and that he was  seen to enter your house.\"    \"If you want Prince Rupert, you must find him,\" the lady said calmly.  \"I say not that he has not been here; but I tell you that he is now  beyond your reach.\"    \"He has not escaped,\" the officer said, \"for the house is surrounded.  Now, madam, I insist upon your telling me where you have hidden him.\"    \"I have already told you, sir, that he is beyond your reach, and nothing  that you can do will wring any further explanation from me.\"    The officer hesitated. For a moment he advanced a step toward her, with  a menacing gesture. But, heated as the passions of men were, no violence  was done to women, and with a fierce exclamation he ordered his troopers  to search the house. For a quarter of an hour they ransacked it high and  low, overturned every article of furniture, pulling down the arras, and  tapping the walls with the hilts of their swords.    \"Take these two ladies away,\" he said to his lieutenant, \"and ride with  them at once to Storton. They will have to answer for having harbored  the prince.\"    The ladies were immediately taken off, placed on pillions behind two  troopers, and carried away to Storton. In the meantime the search went  on, and presently the hollow sound given by the slab in the wall was  noticed. The spring could not be discovered, but crowbars and hammers  being brought, the slab of stone was presently shivered. The discovery  of the iron door behind it further heightened their suspicion that the  place of concealment was found. The door, after a prolonged resistance,  was battered in. But the Roundheads were filled with fury, on entering,  to discover only a small, bare cell, with no signs of occupation  whatever. The search was now prolonged in other directions; but,  becoming convinced that it was useless, and that the place of  concealment was too cunningly devised to admit of discovery, the  captain ordered the furniture to be piled together, and setting light to  it and the arras in several places, withdrew his men from the house,  saying that if a rat would not come out of his hole, he must be smoked  in it.    The prince and Harry from their place of concealment had heard the sound  of blows against the doors below.    \"They have found the way we have gone,\" the prince said, \"but I think  not that their scent is keen enough to trace us up here. If they do so,  we will sell our lives dearly, for I will not be taken prisoner, and  sooner or later our troop will hear of the Roundheads' attack, and will  come to our rescue.\"    They heard the fall of the iron door, and the exclamations and cries  with which the Roundheads broke into the room below. Then faintly they  heard the sound of voices, and muffled knocks, as they tried the walls.  Then all was silent again.    \"The hounds are thrown off the scent,\" the prince said. \"It will need a  clever huntsman to put them on it. What will they do next, I wonder?\"    Some time passed, and then Harry exclaimed:    \"I perceive a smell of something burning, your royal highness.\"    \"Peste! methinks I do also,\" the prince said. \"I had not thought of  that. If these rascals have set fire to the place we shall be roasted  alive here.\"    A slight wreath of smoke was seen curling up through the crevice of the  tightly-fitting stone.    \"We will leap out, and die sword in hand,\" the prince said; and seizing  the ring, he and Harry pulled at it. Ere they raised the stone an inch,  a volume of dense smoke poured up, and they at once dropped it into its  place again, feeling that their retreat was cut off. The prince put his  sword in its scabbard.    \"We must die, my lad,\" he said. \"A strange death, too, to be roasted in  a trap. But after all, whether by that or the thrust of a Roundhead  sword makes little difference in the end. I would fain have fallen in  the field, though.\"    \"Perhaps,\" Harry suggested, \"the fire may not reach us here. The walls  are very thick, and the chamber below is empty.\"    The prince shook his head.    \"The heat of the fire in a house like this will crack stone walls,\" he  said.    He then took off his cloak and threw it over the stone, dressing it down  tightly to prevent the smoke from curling in. Through the loophole they  could now hear a roar, and crackling sounds, and a sudden glow lit up  the country.    \"The flames are bursting through the windows,\" Harry said. \"They will  bring our troop down ere long.\"    \"The troop will do us no good,\" Prince Rupert replied. \"All the king's  army could not rescue us. But at least it would be a satisfaction before  we die to see these crop-eared knaves defeated.\"    Minute after minute passed, and a broad glare of light illumined the  whole country round. Through the slit they could see the Roundheads  keeping guard round the house in readiness to cut off any one who might  seek to make his escape, while at a short distance off they had drawn up  the main body of the force. Presently, coming along the road at a rapid  trot, they saw a body of horse.    \"There are our men,\" the prince exclaimed.    The Roundheads had seen them too. A trumpet was sounded, and the men on  guard round the house leaped to their horses, and joined the main body,  just as the Cavaliers charged upon them. The Roundheads fought stoutly;  but the charge of the Cavaliers was irresistible. Furious at the sight  of the house in flames, and ignorant of the fate which had befallen  their prince and their master's son, they burst upon the Roundheads with  a force which the latter were unable to withstand. For four or five  minutes the fight continued, and then such of the Roundheads as were  able clapped spurs to their horses and galloped off, hotly pursued by  the Cavaliers. The pursuit was a short one. Several of the Cavaliers  were gathered at the spot where the conflict had taken place, and were,  apparently, questioning a wounded man. Then the trumpeter who was with  them sounded the recall, and in a few minutes the Royalist troops came  riding back. They could see Jacob pointing to"]]]
