O Gracie, Gracie, why did mamma die? why did God take  her away from us when we need her so much? I can't love Him for that! I  don't love Him!\" she exclaimed with a sudden shower of tears, albeit not  much given to shedding them.    \"Don't cry, Lulu,\" Gracie said in distress, \"maybe papa will find another  mamma for us. I wish he would.\"    \"I don't! stepmothers are always hateful! I'd hate her and never mind a  word she said. O Max, Max! I'm so glad to see you!\" as a handsome,  dark-eyed, merry-faced boy came rushing in.    \"I've just come for a minute!\" he cried half breathlessly, catching her in  his arms, giving her a resounding kiss, then bending over Gracie with a  sudden change to extreme gentleness of manner; she was his baby sister and  so weak and timid.    \"Poor little Gracie!\" he said softly. \"I wish I was a big man to take you  and Lulu away and give you a good time!\"    \"I love you, Max,\" she returned, stroking and patting his cheek. \"I wish  you'd be a good boy, so you could live here with us.\"    \"I don't want to,\" he answered, frowning. \"I mean I don't want to live  with her; I sha'n't ever call her aunt again. I wouldn't have come in if I  hadn't known she was out. I saw her going to market. I'm going off to  Miller's Pond to fish for trout. You know it's Saturday and there's no  school. Jim Bates is going with me and we're to be back by noon; that is,  old Tommy said I must.\"    Lulu laughed at Max's irreverent manner of alluding to the man who had the  oversight of him out of school hours; then jumping up, \"O Max!\" she cried,  \"I want to go too! I'll be ready in a minute.\"    \"What'll Mrs. Scrimp say?\" laughed Max.    Lulu tossed her head with a scornful smile which said more plainly than  words that she did not care what Mrs. Scrimp might do or say in regard to  the matter, ran into the hall, and returned almost instantly with hat and  sacque.    \"Come, Max,\" she said, \"we'd better be off before she gets back. Gracie,  you won't mind being left alone for just a little bit? Ann's in the  kitchen, you know.\"    \"I wish I could go too!\" sighed Gracie. \"I wish I could run about and have  good times like you and Max!\"    \"Maybe you will, some o' these days. Good-by, little one,\" said Max,  giving a parting pat to the little white cheek.    \"Good-by,\" cried Lulu from the doorway; \"don't fret, because maybe I'll  find something pretty to bring you when I come back.\"    She took a small basket from the table in the hall, Max shouldered his  fishing-rod, which he had left there behind the front door, and they went  out together.          CHAPTER XI.        \"Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted,       Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint.\"                                        --_Shaks._      The children walked very fast, glancing this way and that till satisfied  that there was no longer any danger of encountering Mrs. Scrimp, then  their pace slackened a little and they breathed more freely.    \"Won't she be mad because you came without asking her, Lu?\" queried Max.    \"I s'pose so.\"    \"What'll she do about it?\"    \"Scold, scold, scold! and threaten to make me fast; but she knows she  can't do that. I always manage to get something to eat. I've found a key  that fits the pantry door; so I just help myself. She doesn't know about  the key and wonders how it happens; thinks she forgot to lock it.\"    \"But, Lulu, you wouldn't steal!\"    \"'Taint stealing to take what papa pays for! Max, you're too stupid!\"  cried Lulu indignantly.    Max gave a long, low whistle. \"Fact, Lu! that's so! our father does pay  for more than we can possibly eat, and expects us to have all we want.\"    \"Do you get enough, Max?\"    \"Yes; and right good too. Mrs. Fox is real good and kind; but he's just  awful! I tell you, Lu, if I don't thrash him within an inch of his life  when I grow to be a man, it'll be queer.\"    \"Tell me about him! what is it he does to you?\"    \"Well, in the first place, he pretends to be very good and pious; he  preaches and prays and talks to me as if I were the greatest sinner in the  world, while all the time he's ten times worse himself and the biggest  kind of a hypocrite. He tells me it's very wicked when I get angry at his  hateful treatment of me, and gets as mad as a March hare himself while  he's talking about it.\"    \"Well, I'd let him storm and never care a cent.\"    \"Yes, but that isn't all; he beats me dreadfully for the least little  thing, and sometimes for nothing at all. One time he bought a new padlock  for the barn-door and pretty soon it disappeared. He couldn't find it  anywhere, so he called me and asked me what I had done with it. I said I  hadn't touched it, hadn't seen it, didn't even know he had bought one; and  that was the truth. But he wouldn't believe me; he said I must have taken  it, for I was the only mischievous person about the place, and if I didn't  own up and show him where it was, he'd horsewhip me till I did.\"    \"O Max! the wicked old wretch!\" cried Lulu, between her clenched teeth.  \"What did you do? You couldn't tell a lie!\"    \"No, I thought I couldn't, Lu; and oh, I'm so ashamed!\" said Max, growing  very red and tears starting to his eyes. \"But he beat me, and beat me, and  beat me till I thought he'd kill me; and so to stop him at last I said I  took it. But I didn't gain anything, for of course he asked next where it  was, and I couldn't tell him, because I didn't know. So he began again;  but I fainted, and I suppose that scared him and made him stop. He didn't  say anything more about the padlock till weeks afterward it was found in  the hay, and it was clear that I hadn't anything to do with it.\"    \"Oh, the old wretch!\" cried Lulu again. \"Did he tell you then he was sorry  for having abused you so when you were innocent?\"    \"No, indeed! not he! He said, 'Well, you didn't deserve it that time, but  I've no doubt you've escaped many a time when you did.'\"    \"Max, I'd never stand it! I'd run away!\" exclaimed Lulu, stopping short  and facing her brother with eyes that fairly blazed with indignation.    \"I've thought of that, Lu; I've felt tempted to do it more than once,\" Max  said with a sigh; \"but I thought how papa would feel hearing of it. I'd  rather bear it all than have him feel that his son had done anything to  disgrace him.\"    \"Max, you're better than I am!\" cried Lulu with affectionate warmth. \"I'd  never have thought of anything but how to get away as fast as possible  from that horrid, horrid beast of a man.\"    \"Papa thinks he's good, and that's the reason he put me with him. Oh, but  don't I wish he knew the truth!\"    \"I should think the old rascal would be afraid of what papa may do when he  comes and hears all the things you'll have to tell.\"    \"I suppose he thinks papa will believe his story instead of mine; and  perhaps he will,\" said Max a little sadly.    \"No; don't you be one bit afraid of that!\" cried Lulu, hotly. \"Papa knows  you're a truthful boy. His children couldn't be liars!\"    \"But you know I can't say any more that I've never told an untruth,\" said  Max, coloring painfully.    \"Well, you couldn't help it,\" Lulu said, trying to comfort him. \"I'm  afraid that I might have done it myself to keep from being killed.\"    \"Hello! here comes Jim!\" cried Max with a sudden change of tone, his face  brightening wonderfully as a lad somewhat older in appearance than  himself, and carrying a fishing-rod over his shoulder, came hurrying down  a lane and joined them.    \"Hello! Max,\" he said; \"we've a splendid day for fishing, haven't we?\"  Then in a whisper, \"Who's this you're taking along?\"    \"My sister Lulu,\" Max answered aloud. \"She'll help us dig worms for bait,  won't you, Lu?\"    \"Yes, if you'll let me fish a little after you've caught some.\"    \"Good-morning, Miss Lulu,\" said Jim, lifting his hat.    \"Good-morning,\" she returned, giving him a careless nod.    \"It's a long walk for a girl,\" he remarked.    \"Oh,\" said Max, laughing, \"she's half boy; ain't you, Lu?\"    \"I s'pose; if you mean in walking, jumping and running. Aunt Beulah calls  me a regular tomboy. But I'd rather be that than stay cooped up in the  house all the time.\"    They had now left the town behind, and presently they turned from the  highway and took a narrow path that led them deep into the woods, now in  the very height of their autumnal beauty.    The sun shone brightly, but through a mellow haze; the air was deliciously  pure, cool, and bracing.    The children's pulses bounded, they laughed and jested; the boys whistled  and Lulu sang in a voice of birdlike melody.    \"O Max,\" she said, \"I wish Gracie was well and with us here!\"    \"Yes, so do I,\" he answered; \"but 'tisn't likely she can ever be strong  like you and me, Lu.\"    \"Well, I'll tell her all about it and take her all the pretty things I can  find. Oh, what a lovely place!\" as they came out upon the shore of the  pond, a tiny sheet of clear still water surrounded by woods and hills  except where a rivulet entered it on one side and left it on the other.    \"Yes,\" assented Jim, \"it's a right nice place, is Miller's Pond, and has  lots of nice fish in it.\"    The boys laid down their rods, Lulu her basket, and all three fell to  digging for earth-worms.    When they deemed that they had a sufficient quantity of bait, the lads  seated themselves on the roots of a fallen tree close to the water, each,  with fishing-rod in hand, and Lulu, picking up her basket, wandered off  among the trees and bushes.    \"Don't go too far away and get lost,\" Max called after her.    \"No,\" she answered, \"I'll not go out of sight of the pond; so I can easily  find my way back. But don't you go off and leave me.\"    \"No; if you're not here, I'll hallo when we're 'most ready to start.\"    What treasures Lulu found as she wandered here and there, every now and  then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14893"],[0,"Prince Jan, St. Bernard (#15)"],[1,"and knew that the captain, on  his cot, was awake, too. So the dog rose softly and moved to the side of  the narrow bed, where he stretched himself on the floor. Presently he  felt a hand touch his head and he turned quickly to caress it with his  tongue. Then he heard the old man say, \"It's bound to work out right  some way, Jan!\"    The next morning the captain was more cheerful, and when the postman  came along the street, the old man called out, \"It's a beautiful day,  isn't it?\"    The postman nodded, then said, \"I have a registered letter for you,  Captain.\"    With surprised eyes and quick steps, the old man reached the gate and  signed the card. He turned the letter over, stared at it, then smiled  and cried out, \"It's from my daughter!\"    A happy smile illumined his face and his fingers were unsteady as he  tore open the envelope, saying, \"She and her husband went to Alaska two  years ago. I haven't heard anything from them for six months. You see,  when winter begins up there, the river freezes solid, so no boats or  mail can reach them.\"    \"Well, the postmen up there have an easy time once in a while,\" replied  the letter-carrier as he slung the heavy pouch over his shoulder and  went on his way.    The old man sat on the step of the porch and read the letter, which was  a long one. Jan knew his master was glad over something, and yet, when  the letter was finished, there were tears rolling down the captain's  cheeks. Jan edged tightly against him.    \"They're all well,\" said the old man, \"and they want us to come and  live with them. Look, Jan!\" He held out a piece of paper which the dog  sniffed at. \"That is to pay our way, and we're going to start just as  soon as we can pack up. You see, it worked out right in the end!\"    Busy hours followed for them all. The captain hurried about the little  house, packing things into boxes, and taking down pictures, which he put  into a trunk. One picture he held for some minutes, \"That was Jenny when  she was a little girl, just able to walk, Jan.\" Then he wrapped it very  carefully in a faded blue knitted scarf and placed it in the trunk with  the other things. Hippity-Hop scurried about the room, and Cheepsie had  a hard time clinging to the old man's shoulder, for he moved so swiftly  and kept leaning over the trunk.    It was three o'clock in the afternoon when the trunk was shut and locked  and an old carpet-bag stood beside it. The captain's hat was on his  head, Cheepsie chirped in his cage that was wrapped tightly with paper,  and Hippity-Hop mewed forlornly from a basket, while Jan moved nervously  between the bundles and his master, wondering what it all meant. Then a  man drove to the door and carried the trunk and valise to his wagon,  leaving the captain to pick up the bird-cage and the hamper that held  the kitten.    \"Come along, Jan,\" he called cheerfully, and the dog rushed ahead,  turning back to frisk in circles or leap up in front of his friends. Jan  was much happier than Hippity-Hop, who was yowling loudly as she stuck  one paw through a hole in the basket, and Cheepsie's twitters sounded  really cross.    Jan, once again, was put in a baggage car and after a ride of several  hours, the captain got him out and led him to a wharf. Jan remembered  his trip in the boat when he came to the Land of No Snow. He hesitated  to go up the plank walk, but the captain smiled and said, \"It's all  right, Jan. Come along!\" and then the dog trotted fearlessly along the  boards that led to the deck of the big boat. Everything was confusion,  but Jan did not worry when his master led him down into the lower part  of the boat, under the deck. After tying Jan, the old man gave him a  final pat and said, \"I'll be back soon, Jan\"; and the dog, knowing  everything was all right, stretched on his side and closed his eyes. He  was tired from the trip, the excitement of packing, and from those days  of worry before the letter came that made the captain happy again. So he  was very glad to have nothing to do, nothing to think about.    Then the boat trembled and puffed, and Prince Jan knew that he and  Hippity-Hop and Cheepsie and their loved master were going somewhere  together, and he was satisfied.          Chapter XIII    THE VOICES OF THE HOSPICE DOGS      Prince Jan could not tell how many days and nights passed while the boat  throbbed on its way. He grew accustomed to the motion and as the captain  came often each day to see him and talk to him, and many other people  also visited him, Jan found life very pleasant.    Among his visitors was a pretty young woman with big brown eyes and a  gentle voice. Nearly always a little child was in her arms, or held by  the hand, for it was just beginning to walk. Captain Smith and these two  seemed to be great friends. Many times he carried the baby in his arms  and it laughed up in his face when he held it down to pat Jan's head.  The dog watched for them every day, and he was never disappointed. Once,  the captain brought Hippity-Hop to see Jan, and the kitten purred loudly  and rubbed against the dog's legs, while Jan poked her gently with his  nose. The old man chuckled, \"You haven't forgotten each other, have  you?\" Then he picked up the kitten and carried it away.    That night, without warning, everything seemed to change, somehow. The  boat leaped and jumped as though it were frightened at the big waves  that washed against and over it. The night was dark, and down in the  hold of the vessel it was still darker. Jan listened to men running  overhead, voices called loudly and then came a sudden crash. The boat  quivered as though it were hurt.    Jan was thrown so heavily against the side of the boat that he lay  gasping for breath, then he dragged himself to his feet. Swaying with  the jerky motion, but managing to brace himself, he peered through the  inky darkness toward the steps leading to the deck. Again he heard the  hurried feet, the loud voices of men, and this time there were cries of  women and children, too.    He knew something was not right, and as he pulled with all his strength  on the rope that held him, and strained his eyes toward the stairway, he  heard a sound that made him give a loud bark of joy.    \"All right, Jan!\" his master was calling through the darkness, \"I'm  coming!\"    The dog whimpered and licked the hands that fumbled at the rope which  was tied to the side of the boat. With a leap and yelp of joy, Jan  scrambled up the stairs ahead of his master, and both of them reached  the deck.    It was very early in the morning and the sky was heavy with dark clouds.  The wind screamed and big waves tossed so high that at times the boat  appeared to be down in the bottom of a great hole. Although the vessel  jerked, groaned, creaked and crunched, it did not move forward. When the  water washed back a few minutes, Jan saw jagged rocks poking up and felt  the boat pounding on them. He could not understand it at all, and as he  looked up with puzzled eyes at his master, he saw the old man was  staring straight ahead at a strip of land not very far away, where a lot  of people were running about in a great hurry.    One of the boat crew ran past Jan, carrying a rope. Other men were  fastening queer looking rings about the bodies of women and children,  while still more men were lowering a little boat into the water. But as  soon as it touched the waves, it was turned on end and smashed like an  egg-shell against the side of the ship. Jan, standing with his legs  braced firmly, saw the frightened women and children huddled together.  Most of them were very quiet, but some were crying. A few were kneeling  on the wet deck, and though their eyes were shut, Jan knew they were not  asleep, for their lips were moving as if they were talking to some one  whom he could not see.    The shore did not seem very far away, and Jan saw men pushing a little  boat into the water. They leaped into it quickly and grabbed up oars.    \"Thank God!\" said the old poundmaster to a man who stood beside him and  Jan. \"The Life Guards will save the women and children!\"    \"There is no Life Saving Station here,\" Jan heard a woman's voice reply.  He looked up and saw the pretty lady beside his old master. Her face was  very white and she held her baby tightly in her arms, while she stared  at the place where the tiny boat was being shoved into the sea by men  who stood waist-deep in the rushing water. Then the boat shot high on a  wave and started toward the ship. Those on the shore joined in the  cheers that sounded on the stranded ship; but even as they cheered, a  bigger wave snatched at the boat and overturned it, dumping all the men  into the sea. The little boat was dashed on the beach, but those who had  been rowing it bobbed about in the water until helped to land.    A group of men, who had been talking with a man wearing a cap trimmed  with gold braid, now carried a rope to the side of the ship and tossed  it swiftly toward land. Men on the shore were trying to launch another  boat, and every one on the ship leaned forward watching them. The waves  carried the rope some distance forward, and then tossed it back against  the ship's side as though playing with it, just as a cat plays with a  mouse. Tangled and twisted, the rope rose on the crest of a high wave,  then dropped from sight, only to bob up once more, and all the time  drifting further from land.    \"The vessel will be driftwood in half an hour more! She is breaking  amidships!\" the man beside Jan was speaking again to the poundmaster.  \"No boat can live in such a sea and no man can swim it.\"    Captain Smith looked down at Jan. \"It doesn't count so much with us,  Jan,\" he said, \"but it's the women and children. Maybe you can help  them. Come!\"    The dog started at the sound of command and followed his master across  the water-washed deck to the group of ship's officers who were gathered  around the captain of the boat. All were talking"]]]
