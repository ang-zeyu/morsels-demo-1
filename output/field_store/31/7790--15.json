Mr. Tyrrel had formerly been tortured with  the innocent eulogiums she pronounced of Mr. Falkland. But these were  lameness itself, compared with the rich and various eloquence that now  flowed from her lips. Love had not the same effect upon her, especially  at the present moment, which it would have had upon a person instructed  to feign a blush, and inured to a consciousness of wrong. She described  his activity and resources, the promptitude with which every thing was  conceived, and the cautious but daring wisdom with which it was  executed. All was fairy-land and enchantment in the tenour of her  artless tale; you saw a beneficent genius surveying and controlling the  whole, but could have no notion of any human means by which his purposes  were effected.    Mr. Tyrrel listened for a while to these innocent effusions with  patience; he could even bear to hear the man applauded, by whom he had  just obtained so considerable a benefit. But the theme by amplification  became nauseous, and he at length with some roughness put an end to the  tale. Probably, upon recollection, it appeared still more insolent and  intolerable than while it was passing; the sensation of gratitude wore  off, but the hyperbolical praise that had been bestowed still haunted  his memory, and sounded in his ear;--Emily had entered into the  confederacy that disturbed his repose. For herself, she was wholly  unconscious of offence, and upon every occasion quoted Mr. Falkland as  the model of elegant manners and true wisdom. She was a total stranger  to dissimulation; and she could not conceive that any one beheld the  subject of her admiration with less partiality than herself. Her  artless love became more fervent than ever. She flattered herself that  nothing less than a reciprocal passion could have prompted Mr. Falkland  to the desperate attempt of saving her from the flames; and she trusted  that this passion would speedily declare itself, as well as induce the  object of her adoration to overlook her comparative unworthiness.    Mr. Tyrrel endeavoured at first with some moderation to check Miss  Melville in her applauses, and to convince her by various tokens that  the subject was disagreeable to him. He was accustomed to treat her with  kindness. Emily, on her part, was disposed to yield an unreluctant  obedience, and therefore it was not difficult to restrain her. But upon  the very next occasion her favourite topic would force its way to her  lips. Her obedience was the acquiescence of a frank and benevolent  heart; but it was the most difficult thing in the world to inspire her  with fear. Conscious herself that she would not hurt a worm, she could  not conceive that any one would harbour cruelty and rancour against her.  Her temper had preserved her from obstinate contention with the persons  under whose protection she was placed; and, as her compliance was  unhesitating, she had no experience of a severe and rigorous treatment.  As Mr. Tyrrel's objection to the very name of Falkland became more  palpable and uniform, Miss Melville increased in her precaution. She  would stop herself in the half-pronounced sentences that were meant to  his praise. This circumstance had necessarily an ungracious effect; it  was a cutting satire upon the imbecility of her kinsman. Upon these  occasions she would sometimes venture upon a good-humoured  expostulation:--\"Dear sir! well, I wonder how you can be so ill-natured!  I am sure Mr. Falkland would do you any good office in the  world:\"--till she was checked by some gesture of impatience and  fierceness.    At length she wholly conquered her heedlessness and inattention. But it  was too late. Mr. Tyrrel already suspected the existence of that passion  which she had thoughtlessly imbibed. His imagination, ingenious in  torment, suggested to him all the different openings in conversation, in  which she would have introduced the praise of Mr. Falkland, had she not  been placed under this unnatural restraint. Her present reserve upon the  subject was even more insufferable than her former loquacity. All his  kindness for this unhappy orphan gradually subsided. Her partiality for  the man who was the object of his unbounded abhorrence, appeared to him  as the last persecution of a malicious destiny. He figured himself as  about to be deserted by every creature in human form; all men, under the  influence of a fatal enchantment, approving only what was sophisticated  and artificial, and holding the rude and genuine offspring of nature in  mortal antipathy. Impressed with these gloomy presages, he saw Miss  Melville with no sentiments but those of rancorous aversion; and,  accustomed as he was to the uncontrolled indulgence of his propensities,  he determined to wreak upon her a signal revenge.          CHAPTER VII.      Mr. Tyrrel consulted his old confident respecting the plan he should  pursue; who, sympathising as he did in the brutality and insolence of  his friend, had no idea that an insignificant girl, without either  wealth or beauty, ought to be allowed for a moment to stand in the way  of the gratifications of a man of Mr. Tyrrel's importance. The first  idea of her now unrelenting kinsman was to thrust her from his doors,  and leave her to seek her bread as she could. But he was conscious that  this proceeding would involve him in considerable obloquy; and he at  length fixed upon a scheme which, at the same time that he believed it  would sufficiently shelter his reputation, would much more certainly  secure her mortification and punishment.    For this purpose he fixed upon a young man of twenty, the son of one  Grimes, who occupied a small farm, the property of his confident. This  fellow he resolved to impose as a husband on Miss Melville, who, he  shrewdly suspected, guided by the tender sentiments she had  unfortunately conceived for Mr. Falkland, would listen with reluctance  to any matrimonial proposal. Grimes he selected as being in all respects  the diametrical reverse of Mr. Falkland. He was not precisely a lad of  vicious propensities, but in an inconceivable degree boorish and  uncouth. His complexion was scarcely human; his features were coarse,  and strangely discordant and disjointed from each other. His lips were  thick, and the tone of his voice broad and unmodulated. His legs were of  equal size from one end to the other, and his feet misshapen and clumsy.  He had nothing spiteful or malicious in his disposition, but he was a  total stranger to tenderness; he could not feel for those refinements in  others, of which he had no experience in himself. He was an expert  boxer: his inclination led him to such amusements as were most  boisterous; and he delighted in a sort of manual sarcasm, which he could  not conceive to be very injurious, as it left no traces behind it. His  general manners were noisy and obstreperous; inattentive to others; and  obstinate and unyielding, not from any cruelty and ruggedness of  temper, but from an incapacity to conceive those finer feelings, that  make so large a part of the history of persons who are cast in a gentler  mould.    Such was the uncouth and half-civilised animal, which the industrious  malice of Mr. Tyrrel fixed upon as most happily adapted to his purpose.  Emily had hitherto been in an unusual degree exempted from the  oppression of despotism. Her happy insignificance had served her as a  protection. No one thought it worth his while to fetter her with those  numerous petty restrictions with which the daughters of opulence are  commonly tormented. She had the wildness, as well as the delicate frame,  of the bird that warbles unmolested in its native groves.    When therefore she heard from her kinsman the proposal of Mr. Grimes for  a husband, she was for a moment silent with astonishment at so  unexpected a suggestion. But as soon as she recovered her speech, she  replied, \"No, sir, I do not want a husband.\"    \"You do! Are not you always hankering after the men? It is high time you  should be settled.\"    \"Mr. Grimes! No, indeed! when I do have a husband, it shall not be such  a man as Mr. Grimes neither.\"    \"Be silent! How dare you give yourself such unaccountable liberties?\"    \"Lord, I wonder what I should do with him. You might as well give me  your great rough water-dog, and bid me make him a silk cushion to lie in  my dressing-room. Besides, sir, Grimes is a common labouring man, and I  am sure I have always heard my aunt say that ours is a very great  family.\"    \"It is a lie! Our family! have you the impudence to think yourself one  of our family?\"    \"Why, sir, was not your grandpapa my grandpapa? How then can we be of a  different family?\"    \"From the strongest reason in the world. You are the daughter of a  rascally Scotchman, who spent every shilling of my aunt Lucy's fortune,  and left you a beggar. You have got an hundred pounds, and Grimes's  father promises to give him as much. How dare you look down upon your  equals?\"    \"Indeed, sir, I am not proud. But, indeed and indeed, I can never love  Mr. Grimes. I am very happy as I am: why should I be married?\"    \"Silence your prating! Grimes will be here this afternoon. Look that you  behave well to him. If you do not, he will remember and repay, when you  least like it.\"    \"Nay, I am sure, sir--you are not in earnest?\"    \"Not in earnest! Damn me, but we will see that. I can tell what you  would be at. You had rather be Mr. Falkland's miss, than the wife of a  plain downright yeoman. But I shall take care of you.--Ay, this comes of  indulgence. You must be taken down, miss. You must be taught the  difference between high-flown notions and realities. Mayhap you may take  it a little in dudgeon or so; but never mind that. Pride always wants a  little smarting. If you should be brought to shame, it is I that shall  bear the blame of it.\"    The tone in which Mr. Tyrrel spoke was so different from any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11344"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 415, December 15, 1883 (#15)"],[1,"for this purpose. The apparatus in question consists  of a concave sponge electrode, the concavity of which corresponds to the  convexity of the external aspect of the cranium. Above the electrode is  a chamber of metal or India-rubber, designed to contain ice. The whole  is secured to the head of the patient by a single chin-strap, and  connection established with an ordinary galvanic battery by means of an  appropriate clamp and insulated cord. The indifferent pole is applied  over the sternum or other convenient point. Care should be taken not to  employ too strong currents, as otherwise vertigo and other unpleasant  symptoms may be produced. An application of from five to ten minutes is  usually sufficient to arrest the head-pain. As an additional security it  is well to recommend the patient to take a hot foot-bath, and to remain  as quiet as possible for twelve hours succeeding the treatment. In  hyperaemic headache cupping and blood-letting have been recommended; but  as a rule both procedures are not only unnecessary but positively  inadmissible, as exclusion of the superfluous amount of blood by  compression upon the carotids, followed by a corresponding dilatation of  the peripheral circulation by means of the foot-bath, will almost always  be sufficient to cause a permanent cessation of the symptoms. Among the  internal remedies which may be employed with good effect in certain  cases are aconite, bromide of potassium, and Indian hemp. The inhalation  of from five to ten drops of chloroform is an excellent expedient in  some instances. Chlorodyne, which is nothing more than a mixture of  sedatives, often works well, and indeed frequently excels other  remedies. The regulation of the heart's action is also of very great  importance in these cases, and the physician should have no hesitancy in  resorting to such remedies as digitalis and belladonna for the purpose  of reducing the tension in the domain of the cerebral circulation. As a  matter of course the digestive functions should be carefully looked to;  the bowels should be kept open; and in all cases where there are  indications of a congestive origin, alcohol in all forms should be  absolutely forbidden.--_Med.

[Footnote: From a paper published in the _British Medical Journal_.]    By F.J.B. QUINLAN, M.D., M.R.I.A., F.K.Q.C P., Physician to St.  Vincent's Hospital, Dublin.      From time immemorial, the _Verbascum thapsus_, or great mullein, has  been a trusted popular remedy, in Ireland, for the treatment of the  above formidable malady. It is a wild plant--most persons would call it  a weed--found in many parts of the United Kingdom; and, according to  Sowerby's _British Botany_, vol. vi., page 110, is \"rather sparingly  distributed over England and the south of Scotland.\" In most parts of  Ireland, however, in addition to growing wild it is carefully cultivated  in gardens, and occasionally on a rather extensive scale; and this is  done wholly and solely in obedience to a steady popular call for the  herb by phthisical sufferers. Constantly, in Irish newspapers, there are  advertisements offering it for sale; and there are, in this city,  pharmaceutical establishments of the first rank in which it can be  bought. Still it does not appear in the Pharmacopoeia; nor, as far as I  know, has its use received the official sanction of the medical  profession. Some friends with whom I talked over the matter at the  Pharmaceutical Conference at Southampton last August, suggested that it  would be desirable to make a therapeutical research into the powers of  this drug, and ascertain by actual experiment its efficacy or otherwise.  Having partially accomplished this, I am anxious to very briefly set  forth what has been done, in order that others may be induced to  co-operate in the work.    \"There are five mulleins, all belonging to the parent order of the  Scrophulariaceae; but the old Irish remedy is the great mullein, or  _Verbascum thapsus_, a faithful delineation of which will be found in  Plate 1, 437, vol. vi., of Sowerby. It is a hardy biennial, with a thick  stalk, from eighteen inches to four feet high, and with very peculiar  large woolly and mucilaginous leaves, and a long flower spike with ugly  yellow and nearly sessile flowers. The leaves are best gathered in late  summer or autumn, shortly before the plant flowers. In former times it  appears to have been rather highly thought of, particularly as a remedy  for diarrhoea; and Dioscorides, Culpepper, and Gerarde favorably allude  to it.    \"Having been furnished with a good supply of fresh mullein from a garden  near this city, where it is extensively grown, I commenced operations.  As it proved useful, subsequent supplies were procured from our  drug-contractor.    \"The old Irish method of administering the mullein is to place an ounce  of dried leaves, or a corresponding quantity of the fresh ones, in a  pint of milk; to boil for ten minutes, and then to strain. This strained  fluid is given warm to the patient, with or without a little sugar. It  is administered twice a day; and the taste of the mixture is bland,  mucilaginous, comforting to the praecordia, and not disagreeable. I  resolved to try this method, and also the watery infusion; and,  moreover, the natural expressed juice fortified with glycerin. This  latter preparation was carefully made for me, from fresh mullein leaves,  by Dr. John Evans, chemist to the Queen and the Prince of Wales.    \"Some phthisical sufferers, of whom there are here, alas! too many, were  now admitted from time to time into St. Vincent's Hospital. They were  admitted in all stages, from an early one to the most advanced. On each  admission the case was carefully examined; the history, symptoms, and  physical signs were exactly noted; and the patient was weighed on a  stage balance with great accuracy. The patient was put as much as  possible on the mullein treatment only. For obvious reasons, no  cod-liver oil, koumiss, or other weight producer was given; the patients  got the diet suitable to such sufferers; and, if the special symptoms  became troublesome, received appropriate treatment. As much as possible,  however, they were left to the mullein--a proceeding which was entirely  satisfactory to themselves. In addition to the admission weighing, they  were carefully weighed every week, and care was taken that this should  be done as nearly as possible on the same day and hour, with the same  clothes, and, in fact, as much as could be under the same conditions. In  securing this the patients anxiously co-operated; and it was frequently  amusing, but sometimes painful, to watch the satisfaction or chagrin  with which the weekly result was received. I must here tender my  acknowledgments to our zealous, attentive, and accurate house surgeon,  Mr. Denis P. Kenna, by whom this important, but tedious, duty was  discharged.\"    Dr. Quinlan then refers to several cases, in which the mullein plant has  been tried as a remedy for consumption, and remarks that these cases,  although too few to justify any general conclusion, appear to establish  some useful facts. The mullein plant boiled in milk is liked by the  patients; in watery infusion it is disagreeable, and the succus is still  more so. The hot milk decoction causes a comfortable (what our Gallic  neighbors call _pectorale_) sensation, and when once patients take it  they experience a physiological want, and when the supply was once or  twice interrupted, complained much in consequence. That it eases  phthisical cough there can be no doubt; in fact, some of the patients  scarcely took their cough mixtures at all--an unmixed boon to phthisical  sufferers with delicate stomachs. Its power of checking phthisical  looseness of the bowels was very marked, and experiment proved that this  was not merely due to the well known astringent properties of boiled  milk. It also gave great relief to the dyspnoea. For phthisical night  sweats it is utterly useless; but these can be completely checked by the  hypodermic use of from one-eighteenth to one-fiftieth of a grain of the  atropia sulphate; the smaller dose, if it will answer, being preferable,  as the larger causes dryness of the pharynx, and interferes with ocular  accommodation. In advanced cases, it does not prevent loss of weight,  nor am I aware of anything that will, except koumiss. Dr. Carrick, in  his interesting work on the koumiss treatment of Southern Russia (page  213), says: \"I have seen a consumption invalid gain largely in weight,  while the disease was making rapid progress in her lungs, and the  evening temperature rarely fell below 101 deg. Fahr. Until then I considered  that an increase of weight in phthisis pulmonalis was a proof of the  arrest of the malady.\" If koumiss possesses this power, mullein does  not; but unfortunately, as real koumiss can be made from the milk of the  mare only, and as it does not bear traveling, the consumptive invalid  must go at least to Samara or Southern Russia. In pretubercular and  early cases of pulmonary consumption, mullein appears to have a distinct  weight-increasing power; and I have observed this in several private  cases also. Having no weighings of these latter, however, makes this  statement merely an expression of opinion. In early cases, mullein milk  appears to act very much in the same manner as cod-liver oil; and when  we consider that it is at once cheap and palatable it is certainly worth  a trial. I will continue the research by careful weighings of early  cases; and will further endeavor to ascertain whether the addition of  mullein to the cultivating solution prevents the propagation of the  phthisical bacillus.           *       *       *       *       *          ACTION OF MINERAL WATERS AND OF HOT WATER UPON THE BILE.
