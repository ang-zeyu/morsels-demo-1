Beautiful as he describes her, with a face full  of sweetness, and manners noble and engaging, he speaks most of the  charms of her golden locks. The black gown could hardly have implied her  widowhood: the allusion would not have been delicate. The vine belongs to  dramatic poets, among whom the lover was at that time to be classed, the  _Orlando_ not having appeared. Its duplification intimated another self;  and the crowning laurel was the success that awaited the heroic poet and  the conqueror of the lady's heart.[14]    The marriage was never acknowledged. The husband was in the receipt of  profits arising from church-offices, which put him into the condition of  the fellow of a college with us, who cannot marry so long as he retains  his fellowship: but it is proved to have taken place, though the date of  it is uncertain. Ariosto, in a satire written three or four years after  his falling in love, says he never intends either to marry or to take  orders; because, if he takes orders, he cannot marry; and if he marries,  he cannot take orders--that is to say, must give up his semi-priestly  emoluments. This is one of the falsehoods which the Roman Catholic  religion thinks itself warranted in tempting honest men to fall into;  thus perplexing their faith as to the very roots of all faith, and  tending to maintain a sensual hypocrisy, which can do no good to the  strongest minds, and must terribly injure the weak.    Ariosto's love for this lady I take to have been one of the causes of  dissatisfaction between him and the cardinal. \"Fortunately for the poet,\"  as Panizzi observes, Ippolito was not always in Ferrara. He travelled  in Italy, and he had an archbishopric in Hungary, the tenure of which  compelled occasional residence. His company was not desired in Rome, so  that he was seldom there. Ariosto, however, was an amusing companion; and  the cardinal seems not to have liked to go anywhere without him. In the  year 1515 he was attended by the poet part of the way on a journey to  Rome and Urbino; but Ariosto fell ill, and had leave to return. He  confesses that his illness was owing to an anxiety of love; and he even  makes an appeal to the cardinal's experience of such feelings; so that it  might seem he was not afraid of Ippolito's displeasure in that direction.  But the weakness which selfish people excuse in themselves becomes a  \"very different thing\" (as they phrase it) in another. The appeal to the  cardinal's experience might only have exasperated him, in its assumption  of the identity of the case. However, the poet was, at all events, left  this time to the indulgence of his love and his poetry; and in the  course of the ensuing year, a copy of the first edition of the _Orlando  Furioso_, in forty cantos, was put into the hands of the illustrious  person to whom it was dedicated.    The words in which the cardinal was pleased to express himself on this  occasion have become memorable. \"Where the devil, Master Lodovick,\" said  the reverend personage, \"have you picked up such a parcel of trumpery?\"  The original term is much stronger, aggravating the insult with  indecency. There is no equivalent for it in English; and I shall not  repeat it in Italian. \"It is as low and indecent,\" says Panizzi, \"as  any in the language.\" Suffice it to say that, although the age was not  scrupulous in such matters, it was one of the last words befitting the  lips of the reverend Catholic; and that, when Ippolito of Este  (as Ginguene observes) made that speech to the great poet, \"he  uttered--prince, cardinal, and mathematician as he was--an  impertinence.\"[15]    Was the cardinal put out of temper by a device which appeared in this  book? On the leaf succeeding the title-page was the privilege for its  publication, granted by Leo in terms of the most flattering personal  recognition.[16] So far so good; unless the unpoetical Este patron was  not pleased to see such interest taken in the book by the tasteful Medici  patron. But on the back of this leaf was a device of a hive, with the  bees burnt out of it for their honey, and the motto, \"Evil for good\"  (_Pro bono malum_). Most biographers are of opinion that this device was  aimed at the cardinal's ill return for all the sweet words lavished on  him and his house. If so, and supposing Ariosto to have presented the  dedication-copy in person, it would have been curious to see the faces of  the two men while his Eminence was looking at it. Some will think that  the good-natured poet could hardly have taken such an occasion of  displaying his resentment. But the device did not express at whom it was  aimed: the cardinal need not have applied it to himself if he did not  choose, especially as the book was full of his praises; and good-natured  people will not always miss an opportunity of covertly inflicting a  sting. The device, at all events, shewed that the honey-maker had got  worse than nothing by his honey; and the house of Este could not say they  had done any thing to contradict it.    I think it probable that neither the poet's device nor the cardinal's  speech were forgotten, when, in the course of the next year, the parties  came to a rupture in consequence of the servant's refusing to attend his  master into Hungary. Ariosto excused himself on account of the state of  his health and of his family. He said that a cold climate did not agree  with him; that his chest was affected, and could not bear even the stoves  of Hungary; and that he could not, in common decency and humanity, leave  his mother in her old age, especially as all the rest of the family were  away but his youngest sister, whose interests he had also to take care  of. But Ippolito was not to be appeased. The public have seen, in a late  female biography, a deplorable instance of the unfeelingness with which  even a princess with a reputation for religion could treat the declining  health and unwilling retirement of a poor slave in her service, fifty  times her superior in every thing but servility. Greater delicacy was  not to be expected of the military priest. The nobler the servant, the  greater the desire to trample upon him and keep him at a disadvantage. It  is a grudge which rank owes to genius, and which it can only wave when  its possessor is himself \"one of God Almighty's gentlemen.\" I do not mean  in point of genius, which is by no means the highest thing in the world,  whatever its owners may think of it; but in point of the highest of all  things, which is nobleness of heart. I confess I think Ariosto was wrong  in expecting what he did of a man he must have known so well, and in  complaining so much of courts, however good-humouredly. A prince occupies  the station he does, to avert the perils of disputed successions, and  not to be what his birth cannot make him--if nature has not supplied the  materials. Besides, the cardinal, in his quality of a mechanical-minded  man with no taste, might with reason have complained of his servant's  attending to poetry when it was \"not in his bond;\" when it diverted  him from the only attentions which his employer understood or desired.  Ippolito candidly confessed, as Ariosto himself tells us, that he not  only did not care for poetry, but never gave his attendant one stiver in  patronage of it, or for any thing whatsoever but going his journeys and  doing as he was bidden.[17] On the other hand, the cardinal's payments  were sorry ones; and the poet might with justice have thought, that he  was not bound to consider them an equivalent for the time be was expected  to give up. The only thing to have been desired in this case was, that he  should have said so; and, in truth, at the close of the explanation which  he gave on the subject to his friends at court, he did--boldly desiring  them, as became him, to tell the cardinal, that if his eminence expected  him to be a \"serf\" for what he received, he should decline the bargain;  and that he preferred the humblest freedom and his studies to a slavery  so preposterous.[18] The truth is, the poet should have attached himself  wholly to the Medici. Had he not adhered to the duller house, he might  have led as happy a life with the pope as Pulci did with the pope's  father; perhaps have been made a cardinal, like his friends Bembo and  Sadolet. But then we might have lost the _Orlando_.    The only sinecure which the poet is now supposed to have retained, was a  grant of twenty-five crowns every four months on the episcopal chancery  of Milan: so, to help out his petty income, he proceeded to enter into  the service of Alfonso, which shews that both the brothers were not angry  with him. He tells us, that he would gladly have had no new master, could  he have helped it; but that, if he must needs serve, he would rather  serve the master of every body else than a subordinate one. At this  juncture he had a brief prospect of being as free as he wished; for an  uncle died leaving a large landed property still known as the Ariosto  lands (_Le Arioste_); but a convent demanded it on the part of one of  their brotherhood, who was a natural son of this gentleman; and a more  formidable and ultimately successful claim was advanced in a court of  law by the Chamber of the Duchy of Ferrara, the first judge in the cause  being the duke's own steward and a personal enemy of the poet's. Ariosto,  therefore, while the suit was going on, was obliged to content himself  with his fees from Milan and a monthly allowance which he received from  the duke of \"about thirty-eight shillings,\" together with provisions  for three servants and two horses. He entered the duke's service in the  spring of 1518, and remained in it for the rest of his life. But it was  not so burden-some as that of the cardinal; and the consequence of the  poet's greater leisure was a second edition of the _Furioso_, in the year  1521, with additions and corrections; still, however, in forty cantos"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10657"],[0,"\"De Bello Gallico\" and Other Commentaries (#15)"],[1,"trumpet; the soldiers to be called off from  the works; those who had proceeded some distance for the purpose of  seeking materials for the rampart, to be summoned; the order of battle  to be formed; the soldiers to be encouraged; the watchword to be given.  A great part of these arrangements was prevented by the shortness of  time and the sudden approach and charge of the enemy. Under these  difficulties two things proved of advantage; [first] the skill and  experience of the soldiers, because, having been trained by former  engagements, they could suggest to themselves what ought to be done, as  conveniently as receive information from others; and [secondly] that  Caesar had forbidden his several lieutenants to depart from the works  and their respective legions, before the camp was fortified. These, on  account of the near approach and the speed of the enemy, did not then  wait for any command from Caesar, but of themselves executed whatever  appeared proper.    XXI.--Caesar, having given the necessary orders, hastened to and fro  into whatever quarter fortune carried him to animate the troops, and  came to the tenth legion. Having encouraged the soldiers with no further  speech than that \"they should keep up the remembrance of their wonted  valour, and not be confused in mind, but valiantly sustain the assault  of the enemy\"; as the latter were not farther from them than the  distance to which a dart could be cast, he gave the signal for  commencing battle. And having gone to another quarter for the purpose of  encouraging [the soldiers], he finds them fighting. Such was the  shortness of the time, and so determined was the mind of the enemy on  fighting, that time was wanting not only for affixing the military  insignia, but even for putting on the helmets and drawing off the covers  from the shields. To whatever part any one by chance came from the works  (in which he had been employed), and whatever standards he saw first, at  these he stood, lest in seeking his own company he should lose the time  for fighting.    XXII.--The army having been marshalled, rather as the nature of the  ground and the declivity of the hill and the exigency of the time, than  as the method and order of military matters required; whilst the legions  in the different places were withstanding the enemy, some in one  quarter, some in another, and the view was obstructed by the very thick  hedges intervening, as we have before remarked, neither could proper  reserves be posted, nor could the necessary measures be taken in each  part, nor could all the commands be issued by one person. Therefore, in  such an unfavourable state of affairs, various events of fortune  followed.    XXIII.--The soldiers of the ninth and tenth legions, as they had been  stationed on the left part of the army, casting their weapons, speedily  drove the Atrebates (for that division had been opposed to them), who  were breathless with running and fatigue, and worn out with wounds, from  the higher ground into the river; and following them as they were  endeavouring to pass it, slew with their swords a great part of them  while impeded (therein). They themselves did not hesitate to pass the  river; and having advanced to a disadvantageous place, when the battle  was renewed, they [nevertheless] again put to flight the enemy, who had  returned and were opposing them. In like manner, in another quarter two  different legions, the eleventh and the eighth, having routed the  Veromandui, with whom they had engaged, were fighting from the higher  ground upon the very banks of the river. But, almost the whole camp on  the front and on the left side being then exposed, since the twelfth  legion was posted in the right wing, and the seventh at no great  distance from it, all the Nervii, in a very close body, with  Boduognatus, who held the chief command, as their leader, hastened  towards that place; and part of them began to surround the legions on  their unprotected flank, part to make for the highest point of the  encampment.    XXIV.--At the same time our horsemen, and light-armed infantry, who had  been with those who, as I have related, were routed by the first assault  of the enemy, as they were betaking themselves into the camp, met the  enemy face to face, and again sought flight into another quarter; and  the camp-followers who from the Decuman Gate and from the highest ridge  of the hill had seen our men pass the river as victors, when, after  going out for the purposes of plundering, they looked back and saw the  enemy parading in our camp, committed themselves precipitately to  flight; at the same time there arose the cry and shout of those who came  with the baggage-train; and they (affrighted) were carried some one way,  some another. By all these circumstances the cavalry of the Treviri were  much alarmed (whose reputation for courage is extraordinary among the  Gauls, and who had come to Caesar, being sent by their state as  auxiliaries), and, when they saw our camp filled with a large number of  the enemy, the legions hard pressed and almost held surrounded, the  camp-retainers, horsemen, slingers, and Numidians fleeing on all sides  divided and scattered, they, despairing of our affairs, hastened home,  and related to their state that the Romans were routed and conquered,  [and] that the enemy were in possession of their camp and baggage-train.    XXV.--Caesar proceeded, after encouraging the tenth legion, to the right  wing; where he perceived that his men were hard pressed, and that in  consequence of the standards of the twelfth legion being collected  together in one place, the crowded soldiers were a hindrance to  themselves in the fight; that all the centurions of the fourth cohort  were slain, and the standard-bearer killed, the standard itself lost,  almost all the centurions of the other cohorts either wounded or slain,  and among them the chief centurion of the legion, P. Sextius Baculus, a  very valiant man, who was so exhausted by many and severe wounds, that  he was already unable to support himself; he likewise perceived that the  rest were slackening their efforts, and that some, deserted by those in  the rear, were retiring from the battle and avoiding the weapons; that  the enemy [on the other hand], though advancing from the lower ground,  were not relaxing in front, and were [at the same time] pressing hard on  both flanks; he also perceived that the affair was at a crisis, and that  there was not any reserve which could be brought up; having therefore  snatched a shield from one of the soldiers in the rear (for he himself  had come without a shield), he advanced to the front of the line, and  addressing the centurions by name, and encouraging the rest of the  soldiers, he ordered them to carry forward the standards, and extend the  companies, that they might the more easily use their swords. On his  arrival, as hope was brought to the soldiers and their courage restored,  whilst every one for his own part, in the sight of his general, desired  to exert his utmost energy, the impetuosity of the enemy was a little  checked.    XXVI.--Caesar, when he perceived that the seventh legion, which stood  close by him, was also hard pressed by the enemy, directed the tribunes  of the soldiers to effect a junction of the legions gradually, and make  their charge upon the enemy with a double front; which having been done,  since they brought assistance the one to the other, nor feared lest  their rear should be surrounded by the enemy, they began to stand their  ground more boldly, and to fight more courageously. In the meantime, the  soldiers of the two legions which had been in the rear of the army, as a  guard for the baggage-train, upon the battle being reported to them,  quickened their pace, and were seen by the enemy on the top of the hill;  and Titus Labienus, having gained possession of the camp of the enemy,  and observed from the higher ground what was going on in our camp, sent  the tenth legion as a relief to our men, who, when they had learnt from  the flight of the horse and the sutlers in what position the affair was,  and in how great danger the camp and the legion and the commander were  involved, left undone nothing [which tended] to despatch.    XXVI.--By their arrival, so great a change of matters was made, that our  men, even those who had fallen down exhausted with wounds, leant on  their shields, and renewed the fight: then the camp-retainers, though  unarmed, seeing the enemy completely dismayed, attacked [them though]  armed; the horsemen too, that they might by their valour blot out the  disgrace of their flight, thrust themselves before the legionary  soldiers in all parts of the battle. But the enemy, even in the last  hope of safety, displayed such great courage that when the foremost of  them had fallen, the next stood upon them prostrate, and fought from  their bodies; when these were overthrown, and their corpses heaped up  together, those who survived cast their weapons against our men  [thence], as from a mound, and returned our darts which had fallen  between [the armies]; so that it ought not to be concluded, that men of  such great courage had injudiciously dared to pass a very broad river,  ascend very high banks, and come up to a very disadvantageous place;  since their greatness of spirit had rendered these actions easy,  although in themselves very difficult.    XXVIII.--This battle being ended, and the nation and name of the Nervii  being almost reduced to annihilation, their old men, whom together with  the boys and women we have stated to have been collected together in the  fenny places and marshes, on this battle having been reported to them,  since they were convinced that nothing was an obstacle to the  conquerors, and nothing safe to the conquered, sent ambassadors to  Caesar by the consent of all who remained, and surrendered themselves to  him; and in recounting the calamity of their "]]]
