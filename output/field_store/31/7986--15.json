[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1561"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning (#15)"],[1," us take the example of an Ear of Corn. Some people  wonder--hearing nowadays that the folk of old used to worship a  Corn-spirit or Corn-god--wonder that any human beings could have been so  foolish. But probably the good people who wonder thus have never REALLY  LOOKED (with their town-dazed eyes) at a growing spike of wheat. (1) Of  all the wonderful things in Nature I hardly know any that thrills one  more with a sense of wizardry than just this very thing--to observe,  each year, this disclosure of the Ear within the Blade--first a swelling  of the sheath, then a transparency and a whitey-green face within a  hooded shroud, and then the perfect spike of grain disengaging itself  and spiring upward towards the sky--\"the resurrection of the wheat with  pale visage appearing out of the ground.\"     (1) Even the thrice-learned Dr. Famell quotes apparently with  approval the scornful words of Hippolytus, who (he says) \"speaks of the  Athenians imitating people at the Eleusinian mysteries and showing to  the epoptae (initiates) that great and marvelous mystery of perfect  revelation--in solemn silence--a CUT CORNSTALK ([gr teqerismenon] [gr  stacon]).\"--Cults of the Greek States, vol. iii, p. 182.      If this spectacle amazes one to-day, what emotions must it not have  aroused in the breasts of the earlier folk, whose outlook on the world  was so much more direct than ours--more 'animistic' if you like! What  wonderment, what gratitude, what deliverance from fear (of starvation),  what certainty that this being who had been ruthlessly cut down and  sacrificed last year for human food had indeed arisen again as a savior  of men, what readiness to make some human sacrifice in return, both as  an acknowledgment of the debt, and as a gift of something which would  no doubt be graciously accepted!--(for was it not well known that where  blood had been spilt on the ground the future crop was so much more  generous?)--what readiness to adopt some magic ritual likely to  propitiate the unseen power--even though the outline and form of the  latter were vague and uncertain in the extreme! Dr. Frazer, speaking of  the Egyptian Osiris as one out of many corn-gods of the above character,  says (1): \"The primitive conception of him as the corn-god comes clearly  out in the festival of his death and resurrection, which was celebrated  the month of Athyr. That festival appears to have been essentially a  festival of sowing, which properly fell at the time when the husbandman  actually committed the seed to the earth. On that occasion an effigy of  the corn-god, moulded of earth and corn, was buried with funeral rites  in the ground in order that, dying there, he might come to life again  with the new crops. The ceremony was in fact a charm to ensure the  growth of the corn by sympathetic magic, and we may conjecture that as  such it was practised in a simple form by every Egyptian farmer on his  fields long before it was adopted and transfigured by the priests in the  stately ritual of the temple.\" (2)     (1) The Golden Bough, iv, p. 330.     (2) See ch. xv.      The magic in this case was of a gentle description; the clay image of  Osiris sprouting all over with the young green blade was pathetically  poetic; but, as has been suggested, bloodthirsty ceremonies were also  common enough. Human sacrifices, it is said, had at one time been  offered at the grave of Osiris. We bear that the Indians in Ecuador used  to sacrifice men's hearts and pour out human blood on their fields  when they sowed them; the Pawnee Indians used a human victim the same,  allowing his blood to drop on the seed-corn. It is said that in Mexico  girls were sacrificed, and that the Mexicans would sometimes GRIND their  (male) victim, like corn, between two stones. (\"I'll grind his bones to  make me bread.\") Among the Khonds of East India--who were particularly  given to this kind of ritual--the very TEARS of the sufferer were an  incitement to more cruelties, for tears of course were magic for Rain.  (1)     (1) The Golden Bough, vol. vii, \"The Corn-Spirit,\" pp. 236 sq.      And so on. We have referred to the Bull many times, both in his  astronomical aspect as pioneer of the Spring-Sun, and in his more direct  role as plougher of the fields, and provider of food from his own body.  \"The tremendous mana of the wild bull,\" says Gilbert Murray, \"occupies  almost half the stage of pre-Olympic ritual.\" (1) Even to us there is  something mesmeric and overwhelming in the sense of this animal's  glory of strength and fury and sexual power. No wonder the primitives  worshiped him, or that they devised rituals which should convey his  power and vitality by mere contact, or that in sacramental feasts  they ate his flesh and drank his blood as a magic symbol and means of  salvation.     (1) Four Stages, p. 34.          VI. MAGICIANS, KINGS AND GODS    It is perhaps necessary, at the commencement of this chapter, to say a  few more words about the nature and origin of the belief in Magic.  Magic represented on one side, and clearly enough, the beginnings of  Religion--i.e. the instinctive sense of Man's inner continuity with the  world around him, TAKING SHAPE: a fanciful shape it is true, but with  very real reaction on his practical life and feelings. (1) On the other  side it represented the beginnings of Science. It was his first attempt  not merely to FEEL but to UNDERSTAND the mystery of things.     (1) For an excellent account of the relation of Magic to Religion  see W. McDougall, Social Psychology (1908), pp. 317-320.      Inevitably these first efforts to understand were very puerile, very  superficial. As E. B. Tylor says (1) of primitive folk in general, \"they  mistook an imaginary for a real connection.\" And he instances the case  of the inhabitants of the City of Ephesus, who laid down a rope, seven  furlongs in length, from the City to the temple of Artemis, in order to  place the former under the protection of the latter! WE should lay down  a telephone wire, and consider that we established a much more efficient  connection; but in the beginning, and quite naturally, men, like  children, rely on surface associations. Among the Dyaks of Borneo (2)  when the men are away fighting, the WOMEN must use a sort of telepathic  magic in order to safeguard them--that is, they must themselves rise  early and keep awake all day (lest darkness and sleep should give  advantage to the enemy); they must not OIL their hair (lest their  husbands should make any SLIPS); they must eat sparingly and put aside  rice at every meal (so that the men may not want for food). And so on.  Similar superstitions are common. But they gradually lead to a little  thought, and then to a little more, and so to the discovery of actual  and provable influences. Perhaps one day the cord connecting the temple  with Ephesus was drawn TIGHT and it was found that messages could be, by  tapping, transmitted along it. That way lay the discovery of a fact. In  an age which worshiped fertility, whether in mankind or animals, TWINS  were ever counted especially blest, and were credited with a magic  power. (The Constellation of the Twins was thought peculiarly lucky.)  Perhaps after a time it was discovered that twins sometimes run in  families, and in such cases really do bring fertility with them. In  cattle it is known nowadays that there are more twins of the female sex  than of the male sex. (3)     (1) Primitive Culture, vol. i, p. 106.     (2) See The Golden Bough, i, 127.     (3) See Evolution of Sex, by Geddes and Thomson (1901), p. 41,  note.      Observations of this kind were naturally made by the ablest members of  the tribe--who were in all probability the medicine-men and wizards--and  brought in consequence power into their hands. The road to power in  fact--and especially was this the case in societies which had not  yet developed wealth and property--lay through Magic. As far as magic  represented early superstition land religion it laid hold of the HEARTS  of men--their hopes and fears; as far as it represented science and the  beginnings of actual knowledge, it inspired their minds with a sense of  power, and gave form to their lives and customs. We have no reason to  suppose that the early magicians and medicine-men were peculiarly wicked  or bent on mere self-aggrandizement--any more than we have to think the  same of the average country vicar or country doctor of to-day. They  were merely men a trifle wiser or more instructed than their flocks.  But though probably in most cases their original intentions were decent  enough, they were not proof against the temptations which the possession  of power always brings, and as time went on they became liable to trade  more and more upon this power for their own advancement. In the  matter of Religion the history of the Christian priesthood through the  centuries shows sufficiently to what misuse such power can be put; and  in the matter of Science it is a warning to us of the dangers attending  the formation of a scientific priesthood, such as we see growing up  around us to-day. In both cases--whether Science or Religion--vanity,  personal ambition, lust of domination and a hundred other vices, unless  corrected by a real devotion to the public good, may easily bring as  many evils in their train as those they profess to cure.    The Medicine-man, or Wizard, or Magician, or Priest, slowly but  necessarily gathered power into his hands, and there is much evidence to  show that in the case of many tribes at any rate, it was HE who became  ultimate chief and leader and laid the foundations of Kingship. The  Basileus was always a sacred personality, and often united in himself as  head of the clan the offices of chief in warfare and leader in priestly  rites--like Agamemnon in Homer, or Saul or David in the Bible. As a  magician he had influence over the fertility of the earth and, like the  blameless king in the Odyssey, under"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15620"],[0,"Recreations in Astronomy (#15)"],[1,"Saturn only 0.13. This  extremely rapid revolution produces a great flattening at the poles.  If Jupiter should rotate four times more rapidly than it does, it  could not be held together compactly. As it is, the polar diameter  is five thousand miles less than the equatorial: the difference  in diameters produced by the [Page 102] same cause on the earth,  owing to the slower motion and smaller mass, being only twenty-six  miles. The effect of this will be more specifically treated  hereafter.    The difference in the size of the planets is very noticeable. If  we represent the sun by a gilded globe two feet in diameter, we  must represent Vulcan and Mercury by mustard-seeds; Venus, by a  pea; Earth, by another; Mars, by one-half the size; Asteroids, by  the motes in a sunbeam; Jupiter, by a small-sized orange; Saturn,  by a smaller one; Uranus, by a cherry; and Neptune, by one a little  larger.    Apply the principle that attraction is in proportion to the mass,  and a man who weighs one hundred and fifty pounds on the earth  weighs three hundred and ninety-six on Jupiter, and only fifty-eight  on Mars; while on the Asteroids he could play with bowlders for  marbles, hurl hills like Milton's angels, leap into the fifth-story  windows with ease, tumble over precipices without harm, and go  around the little worlds in seven jumps.    [Illustration: Fig. 39.--Orbit of Earth, showing Parallelism of  Axis and Seasons.]    The seasons of a planet are caused by the inclination of its axis  to the plane of its orbit. In Fig. 39 the rotating earth is seen  at A, with its northern pole turning in constant sunlight, and  its southern pole in constant darkness; everywhere south of the  equator is more darkness than day, and hence winter. Passing on  to B, the world is seen illuminated equally on each side of the  equator. Every place has its twelve hours' darkness and light at  each revolution. But at C--the axis of the earth always preserving  the same direction--the northern pole is shrouded in continual  gloom. Every place [Page 105] north of the equator gets more  darkness than light, and hence winter.    The varying inclination of the axes of the different planets gives  a wonderful variety to their seasons. The sun is always nearly  over the equator of Jupiter, and every place has nearly its five  hours day and five hours night. The seasons of Earth, Mars, and  Saturn are so much alike, except in length, that no comment is  necessary. The ice-fields at either pole of Mars are observed to  enlarge and contract, according as it is winter or summer there.  Saturn's seasons are each seven and a half years long. The alternate  darkness and light at the poles is fifteen years long.    But the seasons of Venus present the greatest anomaly, if its assigned  inclination of axis (75 deg.) can be relied on as correct, which is  doubtful. Its tropic zone extends nearly to the pole, and at the  same time the winter at the other pole reaches the equator. The  short period of this planet causes it to present the south pole to  the sun only one hundred and twelve days after it has been scorching  the one at the north. This gives two winters, springs, summers, and  autumns to the equator in two hundred and twenty-five days.    If each whirling world should leave behind it a trail of light to  mark its orbit, and our perceptions of form were sufficiently acute,  we should see that these curves of light are not exact circles, but  a little flattened into an ellipse, with the sun always in one  of the foci. Hence each planet is nearer to the sun at one part  of its orbit than another; that point is called the perihelion,  and the farthest point aphelion. This eccentricity of orbit, or  distance of the sun from the centre, is very small. [Page 106] In  the case of Venus it is only .007 of the whole, and in no instance  is it more than .2, viz., that of Mercury. This makes the sun appear  twice as large, bright, and hot as seen and felt on Mercury at its  perihelion than at its aphelion. The earth is 3,236,000 miles nearer  to the sun in our winter than summer. Hence the summer in the  southern hemisphere is more intolerable than in the northern. But  this eccentricity is steadily diminishing at a uniform rate, by  reason of the perturbing influence of the other planets. In the case  of some other planets it is steadily increasing, and, if it were to  go on a sufficient time, might cause frightful extremes of  temperature; but Lalande has shown that there are limits at which it  is said, \"Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.\" Then a  compensative diminution will follow.    Conceive a large globe, to represent the sun, floating in a round  pond. The axis will be inclined 7-1/2 deg. to the surface of the water,  one side of the equator be 7-1/2 deg. below the surface, and the other  side the same distance above. Let the half-submerged earth sail  around the sun in an appropriate orbit. The surface of the water  will be the plane of the orbit, and the water that reaches out  to the shore, where the stars would be set, will be the plane of  the ecliptic. It is the plane of the earth's orbit extended to  the stars.    The orbits of all the planets do not lie in the same plane, but  are differently inclined to the plane of the ecliptic, or the plane  of the earth's orbit. Going out from the sun's equator, so as to  see all the orbits of the planets on the edge, we should see them  inclined to that of the earth, as in Fig. 40.    [Illustration: Fig. 40.--Inclination of the Planes of Orbits.]    If the earth, and Saturn, and Pallas were lying in [Page 107] the  same direction from the sun, and the outer bodies were to start in a  direct line for the sun, they would not collide with the earth on  their way; but Saturn would pass 4,000,000 and Pallas 50,000,000  miles over our heads. From this same cause we do not see Venus and  Mercury make a transit across the disk of the sun at every  revolution.    [Illustration: Fig. 41.--Inclination of Orbits of Venus and Earth.  Nodal Line, D B.]    Fig. 41 shows a view of the orbits of the earth and Venus seen  not from the edge but from a position somewhat above. The point E,  where Venus crosses the plane of the earth's orbit, is called the  ascending node. If the earth were at B when Venus is at E, Venus  would be seen on the disk of the sun, making a transit. The same  would be true if the earth were at D, and Venus at the descending  node F.    This general view of the flying spheres is full of interest. [Page  108] While quivering themselves with thunderous noises, all is  silent about them; earthquakes may be struggling on their surfaces,  but there is no hint of contention in the quiet of space. They are  too distant from one another to exchange signals, except, perhaps,  the fleet of asteroids that sail the azure between Mars and Jupiter.  Some of these come near together, continuing to fill each other's  sky for days with brightness, then one gradually draws ahead. They  have all phases for each other--crescent, half, full, and gibbous.  These hundreds of bodies fill the realm where they are with  inexhaustible variety. Beyond are vast spaces--cold, dark, void of  matter, but full of power. Occasionally a little spark of light  looms up rapidly into a world so huge that a thousand of our earths  could not occupy its vast bulk. It swings its four or eight moons  with perfect skill and infinite strength; but they go by and leave  the silence unbroken, the darkness unlighted for years.  Nevertheless, every part of space is full of power. Nowhere in its  wide orbit can a world find a place; at no time in its eons of  flight can it find an instant when the sun does not hold it in  safety and life.    _The Outlook from the Earth._    If we come in from our wanderings in space and take an outlook from  the earth, we shall observe certain movements, easily interpreted  now that we know the system, but nearly inexplicable to men who  naturally supposed that the earth was the largest, most stable,  and central body in the universe.    We see, first of all, sun, moon, and stars rise in the east, mount  the heavens, and set in the west. As I [Page 109] revolve in my  pivoted study-chair, and see all sides of the room--library, maps,  photographs, telescope, and windows--I have no suspicion that it is  the room that whirls; but looking out of a car-window in a depot at  another car, one cannot tell which is moving, whether it be his car  or the other. In regard to the world, we have come to feel its  whirl. We have noticed the pyramids of Egypt lifted to hide the sun;  the mountains of Hymettus hurled down, so as to disclose the moon  that was behind them to the watchers on the Acropolis; and the  mighty mountains of Moab removed to reveal the stars of the east.  Train the telescope on any star; it must be moved frequently, or the  world will roll the instrument away from the object. Suspend a  cannon-ball by a fine wire at the equator; set it vibrating north  and south, and it swings all day in precisely the same direction.  But suspend it directly over the north pole, and set it swinging  toward Washington; in six hours after it is swinging toward Rome, in  Italy; in twelve hours, toward Siam, in Asia; in nineteen hours,  toward the Sandwich Islands; and in twenty-four, toward Washington  again, not because it has changed the plane of its vibration, but  because the earth has whirled beneath it, and the torsion of the  wire has not been sufficient to compel the plane of the original  direction to change with the turning of the earth. The law of  inertia keeps it moving in the same direction. The same experimental  proof of revolution is shown in a proportional degree at any point  between the pole and the equator.    But the watchers on the Acropolis do not get turned over so as to  see the moon at the same time every night. [Page 110] We turn down  our eastern horizon, but we do not find fair"]]]
