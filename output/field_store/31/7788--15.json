Meanwhile Michelangelo received a still more important commission on  the 24th of April 1503. The Consuls of the Arte della Lana and the  Operai of the Duomo ordered twelve Apostles, each 4-1/4 cubits high,  to be carved out of Carrara marble and placed inside the church. The  sculptor undertook to furnish one each year, the Board of Works  defraying all expenses, supplying the costs of Michelangelo's living  and his assistants, and paying him two golden florins a month. Besides  this, they had a house built for him in the Borgo Pinti after Il  Cronaca's design. He occupied this house free of charges while he was  in Florence, until it became manifest that the contract of 1503 would  never be carried out. Later on, in March 1508, the tenement was let on  lease to him and his heirs. But he only held it a few months; for on  the 15th of June the lease was cancelled, and the house transferred to  Sigismondo Martelli.    The only trace surviving of these twelve Apostles is the huge  blocked-out S. Matteo, now in the courtyard of the Accademia. Vasari  writes of it as follows: \"He also began a statue in marble of S.  Matteo, which, though it is but roughly hewn, shows perfection of  design, and teaches sculptors how to extract figures from the stone  without exposing them to injury, always gaining ground by removing the  superfluous material, and being able to withdraw or change in case of  need.\" This stupendous sketch or shadow of a mighty form is indeed  instructive for those who would understand Michelangelo's method. It  fully illustrates the passages quoted above from Cellini and Vasari,  showing how a design of the chief view of the statue must have been  chalked upon the marble, and how the unfinished figure gradually  emerged into relief. Were we to place it in a horizontal position on  the ground, that portion of a rounded form which has been disengaged  from the block would emerge just in the same way as a model from a  bath of water not quite deep enough to cover it. At the same time we  learn to appreciate the observations of Vigenere while we study the  titanic chisel-marks, grooved deeply in the body of the stone, and  carried to the length of three or four inches. The direction of these  strokes proves that Michelangelo worked equally with both hands, and  the way in which they are hatched and crossed upon the marble reminds  one of the pen-drawing of a bold draughtsman. The mere  surface-handling of the stone has remarkable affinity in linear effect  to a pair of the master's pen-designs for a naked man, now in the  Louvre. On paper he seems to hew with the pen, on marble to sketch  with the chisel. The saint appears literally to be growing out of his  stone prison, as though he were alive and enclosed there waiting to be  liberated. This recalls Michelangelo's fixed opinion regarding  sculpture, which he defined as the art \"that works by force of taking  away.\" In his writings we often find the idea expressed that a statue,  instead of being a human thought invested with external reality by  stone, is more truly to be regarded as something which the sculptor  seeks and finds inside his marble--a kind of marvellous discovery.  Thus he says in one of his poems: \"Lady, in hard and craggy stone the  mere removal of the surface gives being to a figure, which ever grows  the more the stone is hewn away.\" And again--      _The best of artists hath no thought to show    Which the rough stone in its superfluous shell    Doth not include: to break the marble spell    Is all the hand that serves the brain can do._    S. Matthew seems to palpitate with life while we scrutinise the  amorphous block; and yet there is little there more tangible than some  such form as fancy loves to image in the clouds.    To conclude what I have said in this section about Michelangelo's  method of working on the marble, I must confirm what I have stated  about his using both left and right hand while chiselling. Raffaello  da Montelupo, who was well acquainted with him personally, informs us  of the fact: \"Here I may mention that I am in the habit of drawing  with my left hand, and that once, at Rome, while I was sketching the  Arch of Trajan from the Colosseum, Michelangelo and Sebastiano del  Piombo, both of whom were naturally left-handed (although they did not  work with the left hand excepting when they wished to use great  strength), stopped to see me, and expressed great wonder, no sculptor  or painter ever having done so before me, as far as I know.\"      V    If Vasari can be trusted, it was during this residence at Florence,  when his hands were so fully occupied, that Michelangelo found time to  carve the two _tondi_, Madonnas in relief enclosed in circular spaces,  which we still possess. One of them, made for Taddeo Taddei, is now at  Burlington House, having been acquired by the Royal Academy through  the medium of Sir George Beaumont. This ranks among the best things  belonging to that Corporation. The other, made for Bartolommeo Pitti,  will be found in the Palazzo del Bargello at Florence. Of the two,  that of our Royal Academy is the more ambitious in design, combining  singular grace and dignity in the Madonna with action playfully  suggested in the infant Christ and little S. John. That of the  Bargello is simpler, more tranquil, and more stately. The one recalls  the motive of the Bruges Madonna, the other almost anticipates the  Delphic Sibyl. We might fancifully call them a pair of native pearls  or uncut gems, lovely by reason even of their sketchiness. Whether by  intention, as some critics have supposed, or for want of time to  finish, as I am inclined to believe, these two reliefs are left in a  state of incompleteness which is highly suggestive. Taking the Royal  Academy group first, the absolute roughness of the groundwork supplies  an admirable background to the figures, which seem to emerge from it  as though the whole of them were there, ready to be disentangled. The  most important portions of the composition--Madonna's head and throat,  the drapery of her powerful breast, on which the child Christ  reclines, and the naked body of the boy--are wrought to a point which  only demands finish. Yet parts of these two figures remain  undetermined. Christ's feet are still imprisoned in the clinging  marble; His left arm and hand are only indicated, and His right hand  is resting on a mass of broken stone, which hides a portion of His  mother's drapery, but leaves the position of her hand uncertain. The  infant S. John, upright upon his feet, balancing the chief group, is  hazily subordinate. The whole of his form looms blurred through the  veil of stone, and what his two hands and arms are doing with the  hidden right arm and hand of the Virgin may hardly be conjectured. It  is clear that on this side of the composition the marble was to have  been more deeply cut, and that we have the highest surfaces of the  relief brought into prominence at those points where, as I have said,  little is wanting but the finish of the graver and the file. The  Bargello group is simpler and more intelligible. Its composition by  masses being quite apparent, we can easily construct the incomplete  figure of S. John in the background. What results from the study of  these two circular sketches in marble is that, although Michelangelo  believed all sculpture to be imperfect in so far as it approached the  style of painting, yet he did not disdain to labour in stone with  various planes of relief which should produce the effect of  chiaroscuro. Furthermore, they illustrate what Cellini and Vasari have  already taught us about his method. He refused to work by piecemeal,  but began by disengaging the first, the second, then the third  surfaces, following a model and a drawing which controlled the  cutting. Whether he preferred to leave off when his idea was  sufficiently indicated, or whether his numerous engagements prevented  him from excavating the lowest surfaces, and lastly polishing the  whole, is a question which must for ever remain undecided. Considering  the exquisite elaboration given to the Pieta of the Vatican, the  Madonna at Bruges, the Bacchus and the David, the Moses and parts of  the Medicean monuments, I incline to think that, with time enough at  his disposal, he would have carried out these rounds in all their  details. A criticism he made on Donatello, recorded for us by Condivi,  to the effect that this great master's works lost their proper effect  on close inspection through a want of finish, confirms my opinion.  Still there is no doubt that he must have been pleased, as all true  lovers of art are with the picturesque effect--an effect as of things  half seen in dreams or emergent from primeval substances--which the  imperfection of the craftsman's labour leaves upon the memory.    At this time Michelangelo's mind seems to have been much occupied with  circular compositions. He painted a large Holy Family of this shape  for his friend Angelo Doni, which may, I think, be reckoned the only  easel-picture attributable with absolute certainty to his hand.  Condivi simply says that he received seventy ducats for this fine  work. Vasari adds one of his prattling stories to the effect that Doni  thought forty sufficient; whereupon Michelangelo took the picture  back, and said he would not let it go for less than a hundred: Doni  then offered the original sum of seventy, but Michelangelo replied  that if he was bent on bargaining he should not pay less than 140. Be  this as it may, one of the most characteristic products of the  master's genius came now into existence. The Madonna is seated in a  kneeling position on the ground; she throws herself vigorously  backward, lifting the little Christ upon her right arm, and presenting  him to a bald-headed old man, S. Joseph, who seems about to take him  in his arms.

This, to me, was an easy opportunity of descent, notwithstanding  the boards fastened over the face of the ladder, and I availed myself of  it.    \"I have taken some time and trouble in order that you (so far as I am  aware the only human being beside myself who knows me to be the author of  Foggatt's death) shall have at least the means of appraising my crime at  its just value of culpability.

You see the thing, of course,  from your own point of view--I from mine. And I remember my mother!    \"Trusting that you will forgive the odd freak of a man--a criminal, let us  say--who makes a confidant of the man set to hunt him down, I beg leave to  be, sir, your obedient servant,    \"SIDNEY MASON.\"    I read the singular document through and handed it back to Hewitt.    \"How does it strike you?\" Hewitt asked.    \"Mason would seem to be a man of very marked character,\" I said.  \"Certainly no fool. And, if his tale is true, Foggatt is no great loss to  the world.\"    \"Just so--if the tale is true. Personally I am disposed to believe it is.\"    \"Where was the letter posted?\"    \"It wasn't posted. It was handed in with the others from the front-door  letter-box this morning in an unstamped envelope. He must have dropped it  in himself during the night.

Both quite ordinary and no special marks.\"    \"Where do you suppose he's gone?\"    \"Impossible to guess. Some might think he meant suicide by the expression  'beyond the reach even of your abilities of search,' but I scarcely think  he is the sort of man to do that. No, there is no telling. Something may  be got by inquiring at his late address, of course; but, when such a man  tells you he doesn't think you will find him, you may count upon its being  a difficult job. His opinion is not to be despised.\"    \"What shall you do?\"    \"Put the letter in the box with the casts for the police. _Fiat justitia_,  you know, without any question of sentiment. As to the apple, I really  think, if the police will let me, I'll make you a present of it.

It should cure you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    This is the history of the withered and almost petrified half apple that  stands in my cabinet among a number of flint implements and one or two  rather fine old Roman vessels. Of Mr. Sidney Mason we never heard another  word. The police did their best, but he had left not a track behind him.  His rooms were left almost undisturbed, and he had gone without anything  in the way of elaborate preparation for his journey, and without leaving a  trace of his intentions.          IV.      THE CASE OF THE DIXON TORPEDO.    Hewitt was very apt, in conversation, to dwell upon the many curious  chances and coincidences that he had observed, not only in connection with  his own cases, but also in matters dealt with by the official police, with  whom he was on terms of pretty regular, and, indeed, friendly,  acquaintanceship. He has told me many an anecdote of singular happenings  to Scotland Yard officials with whom he has exchanged experiences. Of  Inspector Nettings, for instance, who spent many weary months in a search  for a man wanted by the American Government, and in the end found, by the  merest accident (a misdirected call), that the man had been lodging next  door to himself the whole of the time; just as ignorant, of course, as was  the inspector himself as to the enemy at the other side of the party-wall.  Also of another inspector, whose name I can not recall, who, having been  given rather meager and insufficient details of a man whom he anticipated  having great difficulty in finding, went straight down the stairs of the  office where he had received instructions, and actually _fell over_ the  man near the door, where he had stooped down to tie his shoe-lace! There  were cases, too, in which, when a great and notorious crime had been  committed, and various persons had been arrested on suspicion, some were  found among them who had long been badly wanted for some other crime  altogether. Many criminals had met their deserts by venturing out of their  own particular line of crime into another; often a man who got into  trouble over something comparatively small found himself in for a  startlingly larger trouble, the result of some previous misdeed that  otherwise would have gone unpunished. The ruble note-forger Mirsky might  never have been handed over to the Russian authorities had he confined his  genius to forgery alone. It was generally supposed at the time of his  extradition that he had communicated with the Russian Embassy, with a view  to giving himself up--a foolish proceeding on his part, it would seem,  since his whereabouts, indeed even his identity as the forger, had not  been suspected. He _had_ communicated with the Russian Embassy, it is  true, but for quite a different purpose, as Martin Hewitt well understood  at the time. What that purpose was is now for the first time published.           *       *       *       *       *    The time was half-past one in the afternoon, and Hewitt sat in his inner  office examining and comparing the handwriting of two letters by the aid  of a large lens. He put down the lens and glanced at the clock on the  mantel-piece with a premonition of lunch; and as he did so his clerk  quietly entered the room with one of those printed slips which were kept  for the announcement of unknown visitors. It was filled up in a hasty and  almost illegible hand, thus:    Name of visitor: _F. Graham Dixon_.    Address: _Chancery Lane_.    Business: _Private and urgent_.    \"Show Mr. Dixon in,\" said Martin Hewitt.    Mr. Dixon was a gaunt, worn-looking man of fifty or so, well, although  rather carelessly, dressed, and carrying in his strong, though drawn, face  and dullish eyes the look that characterizes the life-long strenuous  brain-worker. He leaned forward anxiously in the chair which Hewitt  offered him, and told his story with a great deal of very natural  agitation.    \"You may possibly have heard, Mr. Hewitt--I know there are rumors--of the  new locomotive torpedo which the government is about adopting; it is, in  fact, the Dixon torpedo, my own invention, and in every respect--not  merely in my own opinion, but in that of the government experts--by far  the most efficient and certain yet produced. It will travel at least four  hundred yards farther than any torpedo now made, with perfect accuracy of  aim (a very great desideratum, let me tell you), and will carry an  unprecedentedly heavy charge. There are other advantages--speed, simple  discharge, and so forth--that I needn't bother you about. The machine is  the result of many years of work and disappointment, and its design has  only been arrived at by a careful balancing of principles and means, which  are expressed on the only four existing sets of drawings. The whole thing,  I need hardly tell you, is a profound secret, and you may judge of my  present state of mind when I tell you that one set of drawings has been  stolen.\"    \"From your house?\"    \"From my office, in Chancery Lane, this morning. The four sets of drawings  were distributed thus: Two were at the Admiralty Office, one being a  finished set on thick paper, and the other a set of tracings therefrom;  and the other two were at my own office, one being a penciled set,  uncolored--a sort of finished draft, you understand--and the other a set  of tracings similar to those at the Admiralty. It is this last set that  has gone. The two sets were kept together in one drawer in my room. Both  were there at ten this morning; of that I am sure, for I had to go to that  very drawer for something else when I first arrived. But at twelve the  tracings had vanished.\"    \"You suspect somebody, probably?\"    \"I can not. It is a most extraordinary thing. Nobody has left the office  (except myself, and then only to come to you) since ten this morning, and  there has been no visitor. And yet the drawings are gone!\"    \"But have you searched the place?\"    \"Of course I have! It was twelve o'clock when I first discovered my loss,  and I have been turning the place upside down ever since--I and my  assistants. Every drawer has been emptied, every desk and table turned  over, the very carpet and linoleum have been taken up, but there is not a  sign of the drawings. My men even insisted on turning all their pockets  inside out, although I never for a moment suspected either of them, and it  would take a pretty big pocket to hold the drawings, doubled up as small  as they might be.\"    \"You say your men--there are two, I understand--had neither left the  office?\"    \"Neither; and they are both staying in now. Worsfold suggested that it  would be more satisfactory if they did not leave till something was done  toward clearing the mystery up, and, although, as I have said, I don't  suspect either in the least, I acquiesced.\"    \"Just so. Now--I am assuming that you wish me to undertake the recovery of  these drawings?\"    The engineer nodded hastily.    \"Very good; I will go round to your office. But first perhaps you can tell  me something about your assistants--something it might be awkward to tell  me in their presence, you know. Mr. Worsfold, for instance?\"    \"He is my draughtsman--a very excellent and intelligent man, a very smart  man, indeed, and, I feel sure, quite beyond suspicion. He has prepared  many"]]]
