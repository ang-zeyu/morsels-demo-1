Have you changed, or  is the fire still burning?    BOLZ (_smiling_).    I have become a journalist, Miss Adelaide.    ADELAIDE.    Your friend is one, too.    BOLZ.    Only as a side issue. But I belong to the guild. He who has joined it  may have the ambition to write wittily or well. All that goes beyond  that is not for us.    ADELAIDE.    Not for you?    BOLZ.    For that we are too flighty, too restless and scatter-brained.    ADELAIDE.    Are you in earnest about that, Conrad?    BOLZ.    Perfectly in earnest. Why should I wish to seem to you different from  what I am? We journalists feed our minds on the daily news; we must  taste the dishes Satan cooks for men down to the smallest morsel; so  you really should make allowances for us. The daily vexation over  failure and wrong doing, the perpetual little excitements over all  sorts of things--that has an effect upon a man. At first one clenches  one's fist, then one learns to laugh at it. If you work only for the  day you come to live for the day.    ADELAIDE (_perturbed_).    But that is sad, I think.    BOLZ.    On the contrary, it is quite amusing. We buzz like bees, in spirit we  fly through the whole world, suck honey when we find it, and sting  when something displeases us. Such a life is not apt to make great  heroes, but queer dicks like us are also needed.    ADELAIDE (_aside_).    Now he too is at it, and he is even worse than the other one.    BOLZ.    We won't waste sentiment on that account. I scribble away so long as  it goes. When it no longer goes, others take my place and do the same.  When Conrad Bolz, the grain of wheat, has been crushed in the great  mill, other grains fall on the stones until the flour is ready from  which the future, possibly, will bake good bread for the benefit of  the many.    ADELAIDE.    No, no, that is morbidness; such resignation is wrong.    BOLZ.    Such resignation will eventually be found in every profession. It is  not your lot. To you is due a different kind of happiness, and you  will find it. (_Feelingly_.) Adelaide, as a boy I wrote you tender  verses and lulled myself in foolish dreams. I was very fond of you,  and the wound our separation inflicted still smarts at times.  [ADELAIDE _makes a deprecatory gesture_.] Don't be alarmed, I am not  going to pain you. I long begrudged my fate, and had moments when I  felt like an outcast. But now when you stand there before me in full  radiancy, so lovely, so desirable, when my feeling for you is as warm  as ever, I must say to you all the same: Your father, it is true,  treated me roughly; but that he separated us, that he prevented you,  the rich heiress, who could claim anything, with your own exclusive  circle of friends, from throwing herself away on a wild boy who had  always shown more presumption than power--that was really very  sensible, and he acted quite rightly in the matter.    ADELAIDE (_in her agitation seizing his hands_).    Thank you, Conrad, thank you for speaking so of my dead father! Yes,  you are good, you have a heart. It makes me very happy that you should  have shown it to me.    BOLZ.    It is only a tiny little pocket-heart for private use. It was quite  against my will that it happened to make its appearance.    ADELAIDE.    And now enough of us two! Here in this house our help is needed. You  have won, have completely prevailed against us. I submit, and  acknowledge you my master. But now show mercy and let us join forces.  In this conflict of you men a rude blow has been struck at the heart  of a girl whom I love. I should like to make that good again and I  want you to help me.    BOLZ.    I am at your command.    ADELAIDE.    The Colonel must be reconciled. Think up some way of healing his  injured self-esteem.    BOLZ.    I have thought it over and have taken some steps. Unfortunately, all I  can do is to make him feel that his anger at Oldendorf is folly. This  soft conciliatory impulse you alone can inspire.    ADELAIDE.    Then we women must try our luck.    BOLZ.    Meanwhile I will hurry and do what little I can.    ADELAIDE.    Farewell, Mr. Editor. And think not only of the progress of the great  world, but also occasionally of one friend, who suffers from the base  egotism of wishing to be happy on her own account.    BOLZ.    You have always found your happiness in looking after the happiness of  others. With that kind of egotism there is no difficulty in being  happy. [_Exit_.]    ADELAIDE (_alone_).    He still loves me! He is a man with feeling and generosity. But he,  too, is resigned. They are all _ill_--these men! They have no courage!  From pure learning and introspection they have lost all confidence in  themselves. This Conrad! Why doesn't he say to me: \"Adelaide, I want  you to be my wife?\" He can be brazen enough when he wants to! God  forbid! He philosophizes about my kind of happiness and his kind of  happiness! It was all very fine, but sheer nonsense.--My young  country-squires are quite different. They have no great burden of  wisdom and have more whims and prejudices than they ought to; but they  do their hating and loving thoroughly and boldly, and never forget  their own advantage. They are the better for it! Praised be the  country, the fresh air, and my broad acres! [_Pause; with decision_.]  The _Union_ is to be sold! Conrad must come to the country to get rid  of his crotchets! [_Sits down and writes; rings; enter_ CARL.] Take  this note to Judge Schwarz; I want him kindly to come to me on urgent  business.    [_Exit_ CARL.]    _Enter_ IDA _through the side door on the left_.    IDA.    I am too restless to keep still! Let me cry here to my heart's  content! [_Weeps on_ ADELAIDE'S _neck_.]    ADELAIDE (_tenderly_).    Poor child! The bad men have been very cruel to you. It's all right  for you to grieve, darling, but don't be so still and resigned!    IDA.    I have but the one thought: he is lost to me--lost forever!    ADELAIDE.    You are a dear good girl. But be reassured! You haven't lost him at  all. On the contrary, we'll see to it that you get him back better  than ever. With blushing cheeks and bright eyes he shall reappear to  you, the noble man, your chosen demigod--and your pardon the demigod  shall ask for having caused you pain!--    IDA (_looking up at her_).    What are you telling me?    ADELAIDE.    Listen! This night I read in the stars that you were to become Mrs.  Member-of-Parliament. A big star fell from heaven, and on it was  written in legible letters: \"Beyond peradventure she shall have him!\"  The fulfilment has attached to it but one condition.    IDA.    What condition? Tell me!    ADELAIDE.    I recently told you of a certain lady and an unknown gentleman. You  remember?    IDA.    I have thought of it incessantly.    ADELAIDE.    Good! On the same day on which this lady finds her knight again shall  you also be reconciled with your professor--not sooner, not later.  Thus it is written.    IDA.    I am so glad to believe you. And when will the day come?    ADELAIDE.    Yes, dear, I do not know that exactly. But I will confide in you,  since we girls are alone, that the said lady is heartily tired of the  long hoping and waiting and will, I fear, do something desperate.    IDA (_embracing her_).    If only she will hurry up!    ADELAIDE (_holding her_).    Hush! Some man might hear us! [_Enter_ KORB.] What is it, old friend?    KORB.    Miss Adelaide, out there is Mr. Bellmaus, the friend--    ADELAIDE.    Very well, and he wishes to speak to me?    KORB.    Yes. I myself advised him to come to you; he has something to tell  you.    ADELAIDE.    Bring him in here! [_Exit_ KORB.]    IDA.    Let me go away; my eyes are red with weeping.    ADELAIDE.    Well go, dear. In a few minutes I will rejoin you. (_Exit_ IDA.)    He too! The whole _Union_--one after the other!    _Enter_ BEULMAUS.    BELLMAUS (_shyly, bowing repeatedly_).    You permit me, Miss Runeck!    ADELAIDE (_kindly_).    I am glad to receive your visit, and am curious about the interesting  disclosures you have to make to me.    BELLMAUS.    There is no one to whom I would rather confide what I have heard, Miss  Runeck, than to you. Having learned from Mr. Korb that you are a  subscriber to our newspaper I feel sure--    ADELAIDE.    That I deserve, too, to be a friend of the editors. Thank you for the  good opinion.    BELLMAUS.    There is this man Schmock! He is a poor fellow who has been little in  good society and was until now on the staff of the _Coriolanus_.    ADELAIDE. I remember having seen him.    BELLMAUS.    At Bolz's request I gave him a few glasses of punch. He thereupon grew  jolly and told me of a great plot that Senden and the editor of the  _Coriolanus_ have hatched between them. These two gentlemen, so he  assures me, had planned to discredit Professor Oldendorf in the  Colonel's eyes and so drove the Colonel into writing articles for the  _Coriolanus_.    ADELAIDE.    But is the young man who made you these revelations at all  trustworthy?    BELLMAUS.    He can't stand much punch, and after three glasses he told me all this  of his own accord. In general I don't consider him very reputable. I  should call him a good fellow, but reputable--no, he's not quite that.    ADELAIDE (_indifferently_.)    Do you suppose this gentleman who drank the three glasses of punch  would be willing to repeat his disclosures before other persons?    BELLMAUS.    He said he would, and spoke of proofs too.    ADELAIDE (_aside_).    Aha! (_Aloud_.) I fear the proofs won't amount to much. And you have  not spoken of it to the professor or Mr. Bolz?    BELLMAUS.    Our professor is very much occupied these days, and Bolz is the  jolliest man in the world; but his relations with Mr. von Senden being  already strained I thought--    ADELAIDE (_quickly_).    And you were quite right, dear Mr. Bellmaus. So in other regards you  are content with Mr. Bolz?

At a vestry meeting  held March 28, the redoubtable George Frederick Muntz, with George  Edmonds, and other \"advanced\" men of the times, demanded a personal  examination of the books, &c., &c., with the result doubtless  anticipated and wished for--a general shindy, free fight, and tumult.  For his share in the riot, G.F.M. was put on his trial in the following  year (March 30 to April 1) and had to pay over L2,000 in the shape of  costs, but he may be said to have won something after all, for a better  feeling gradually took the place of rancour, and a system of \"voluntary\"  rates--notably one for the rebuilding of St. Martin's--was happily  brought to work. The Bill for the abolition of Churchrates was passed  July 13, 1868.    ~Church Street.~--In 1764 at Warwick a legal battle was fought as to a  right of way through the New Hall Park, the path in dispute being the  site of the present Church Street.    ~Circuses.~--The first notice we have of any circus visiting Birmingham  is that of Astley's which came here October 7, 1787. In 1815 Messrs.  Adams gave performances in a \"new equestrian circus on the Moat,\" and it  has interest in the fact that this was the first appearance locally of  Mr. Ryan, a young Irishman, then described as \"indisputably the first  tight-rope dancer in the world of his age.\" Mr. Ryan, a few years later,  started a circus on his own account, and after a few years of tent  performances, which put money in his pocket, ventured on the speculation  of building a permanent structure in Bradford-street, opening his \"New  Grand Arena\" there in 1827. Unfortunately, this proved a failure, and  poor Ryan went to the wall. The circus (known now as the Circus Chapel),  long lay empty, but was again re-opened May 19, 1838, as an  amphitheatre, but not successfully. In 1839 the celebrated Van Amburgh,  whose establishment combined the attractions of a circus and a  menagerie, visited this town, and his performances were held, rather  strangely, at the Theatre Royal. On the night of the Bull Ring Riots,  July 15th, when there was \"a full house,\" the startling news that a  number of buildings were on fire, &c., was shouted out just at the  moment that Van Amburgh was on the stage with a number of his  well-trained animals. He himself was reclining on the boards, his head  resting on the sides of a tawny lion, while in his arms was a beautiful  child, four or five years old, playing with the ears of the animal. The  intelligence naturally caused great excitement, but the performer went  quietly on, hoisting the little darling to his shoulder, and putting his  animals through their tricks as calmly as if nothing whatever was the  matter. In 1842, Ducrow's famous troupe came, and once again opened  Ryan's Circus in the Easter week, and that was the last time the  building was used for the purpose it was originally erected for.  Cooke's, Hengler's, Newsome's, and Sanger's periodical visits are  matters of modern date. The new building erected by Mr. W.R. Inshaw, at  foot of Snow Hill, for the purposes of a Concert Hall, will be adaptable  as a Circus.    ~Climate.~--From the central position in which Birmingham is situated,  and its comparative elevation, the town has always been characterised as  one of the healthiest in the kingdom. Dr. Priestley said the air  breathed here was as pure as any he had analysed. Were he alive now and  in the habit of visiting the neighbourhood of some of our rolling mills,  &c., it is possible he might return a different verdict, but  nevertheless the fact remains that the rates of mortality still contrast  most favourably as against other large manufacturing towns.    ~Clocks.~--One of Boulton's specialties was the manufacture of clocks,  but it was one of the few branches that did not pay him. Two of his  finest astronomical clocks were bought by the Empress of Russia, after  being offered for sale in this country in vain. His friend, Dr. Small,  is said to have invented a timepiece containing but a single wheel. The  \"town clocks\" of the present day are only worth notice on account of  their regular irregularity, and those who wish to be always \"up to the  time o' day,\" had best set their watches by the instrument placed in the  wall of the Midland Institute. The dome of the Council House would be a  grand position in which to place a really good clock, and if the dials  were fitted with electric lights it would be useful at all hours, from  near and far.    ~Clubs.~--No place in the kingdom can record the establishment of more  clubs than Birmingham, be they Friendly Clubs, Money Clubs (so-called),  or the more taking Political Clubs, and it would be a hard task to name  them all, or say how they flourished, or dropped and withered. In the  years 1850-60 it was estimated that at publichouses and coffeehouses  there were not less than 180 Money Clubs, the members paying in weekly  or fortnightly subscriptions of varying amount for shares L5 to L100,  and though there cannot be the slightest doubt that many of our present  mastermen owe their success in life to this kind of mutual help, the  spirit of gambling in money shares proved, on the whole, to be  disastrous to the members who went in for good interest on their  deposits. Of Friendly Clubs we shall have something to say under another  beading. Respecting the Political Clubs and those of a general nature we  may say that the earliest we have note of is the \"Church and King Club,\"  whose first meeting was held at the Royal Hotel, Nov. 27, 1792. Of a  slightly different nature was the \"Hampden Club,\" established in 1815,  but which was closed by the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in 1817.  During the troublous times of 1830-40, many clubs, or \"smoke-room  palavers,\" existed, but, perhaps the only one that really showed results  was the Branch Club (or local agency), connected with the Land Scheme of  Feargus O'Connor [see \"_Land Societies_\"], and that ultimately dwindled  to naught. On July 5, 1847, a club on the plan of the London  \"Whittington\" was started here, but when or why it ended deponent  knoweth not.--The Union Clubhouse, corner of Newhall Street and Colmore  Row, which cost L16,000, was built in 1868-9, being opened May 3rd of  the latter year. This must be considered as the chief neutral ground in  local club matters, gentlemen of all shades of politics, &c., being  members. The number of members is limited to 400, with 50 \"temporary\"  members, the entrance fee being L15 15s., and the annual subscription L7  7s.--The Town and District Club, opened at the Shakespeare Rooms, in  August, 1876, also started on the non-political theory: the town members  paying L3 3s per annum, and country members a guinea or guinea and half,  according to their residence being within 25 or 100 miles.--A Liberal  Club was founded October 16, 1873, under the auspices of Mr. Joseph  Chamberlain and took possession of its present rooms in Corporation  Street, January 20, 1880, pending the completion of the palatial edifice  now in course of erection in Edmund Street, at the corner of Congreve  Street. The \"Forward Liberal Club,\" opened in Great Hampton Street,  October 30, 1880. A \"Junior Liberal Club\" celebrated their establishment  by a meeting in the Town Hall, November 16, 1880. The Conservatives, of  course, have not been at all backward in Club matters, for there has  been some institution or other of the kind connected with the party for  the last hundred years. The Midland Conservative Club was started July  4, 1872, and has its head-quarters now in Waterloo-street, the old  County Court buildings being remodelled for the purpose. A Junior  Conservative Club opened in Castle Street, June 25, 1874; a Young Men's  Conservative Club commenced July 26, 1876; the Belmont Conservative  Club, July 30, 1877; and the Hampton Conservative Club, August 21st of  same year. In fact, every ward in the borough, and every parish and  hamlet in the suburbs now has its Conservative and Liberal Club; the  workingmen having also had _their_ turn at Club-making, the Birmingham  Heath working men opening up shop, August 25, 1864; the Saltley boys in  October, 1868; the St. Albanites following suit December 1, 1873; and  the Ladywood men, November 30, 1878. A Club of more pretentious  character, and called _par excellence \"The_ Working-man's Club,\" was  begun July 20, 1863, but the industriously-inclined members thereof did  not work together well, and allowed the affair to drop through. Backed  by several would-be-thought friends of the working class, another  \"Working Men's Club\" sprung into existence April 29, 1875, with a  nominal capital of L2,500 in 10s. shares. Rooms were opened in Corn  Exchange Passage on the 31st of May, and for a time all promised well.  Unfortunately the half-sovereigns did not come in very fast, and the  landlord, though he knew \"Nap\" to be a very favourite game, did not  choose, to be caught napping, and therefore \"took his rest\" at the end  of the fifth half-year, and in so doing rent the whole fabric of the  club.--The Edgbaston Art Club was organised in 1878; the Chess Club in  1841; the Germania Club in 1856; the Gymnastic Club in 1866; the  Dramatic Club in May, 1865; the Farmer's Club in May, 1864, the Pigeon  flying Club at Quilter's in 1875, &c., &c. Club law has great  attractions for the Brums--every profession and every trade hath its  club, and all the \"fanciers\" of every sort and kind club by themselves,  till their name is \"Legion.\"    ~Coaches.~--From its being situated as it were in the very heart of the  kingdom, Birmingham, in the olden days, and it is but fifty years ago,  was an important converging central-point of the great mailcoach system,  and a few notes in connection therewith cannot be uninteresting. Time  was when even coaching was not known, for have we not read how long it  took ere the tidings of Prince Rupert's attack on our town reached  London. A great fear seems "]]]
