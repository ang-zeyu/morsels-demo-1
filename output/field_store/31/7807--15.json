A raging thirst, which was redoubled in the daytime by the beams of a  burning sun, consumed us: it was such, that we eagerly moistened our  parched lips with urine, which we cooled in little tin cups. We put the cup  in a place where there was a little water, that the urine might cool the  sooner; it often happened that these cups were stolen from those who had  thus prepared them. The cup was returned, indeed, to him to whom it  belonged, but not till the liquid which it contained was drank. Mr. Savigny  observed that the urine of sum of us was more agreeable than that of  others. There was a passenger who could never prevail on himself to swallow  it: in reality, it had not a disagreeable taste; but in some of us it  became thick, and extraordinarily acrid: it produced an effect truly worthy  of remark: namely, that it was scarcely swallowed, when it excited an  inclination to urine anew. We also tried to quench our thirst by drinking  sea-water. Mr. Griffon, the governor's secretary, used it continually, he  drank ten or twelve glasses in succession. But all these means only  diminished our thirst to render it more severe a moment afterwards.    An officer of the army, found by chance, a little lemon, and it may be  imagined how valuable this fruit must be to him; he, in fact, reserved it  entirely for himself; his comrades, notwithstanding the most pressing  entreaties, could not obtain any of it; already emotions of rage were  rising in every heart, and if he had not partly yielded to those who  surrounded him, they would certainly have taken it from him by force, and  he would have perished, the victim of his selfishness. We also disputed for  about thirty cloves of garlic, which had been found accidentally in a  little bag: all these disputes were generally accompanied with violent  threats, and if they had been protracted we should, perhaps, have come to  the last extremities.    We had found, also, two little phials which contained a spirituous liquor  to clean the teeth; he who possessed them, kept them carefully, and made  many difficulties to give one or two drops of this liquid in the hollow of  the hand. This liquor, which we believe was an essence of guiacum,  cinnamon, cloves, and other aromatic substances, produced on our tongues a  delightful sensation, and removed for a few moments the thirst which  consumed us. Some of us found pieces of pewter, which, being put into the  mouth produced a kind of coolness.    One of the means generally employed, was to put some sea-water into a hat,  with which we washed our faces for some time, recurring to it at intervals;  we also moistened our hair with it, and held our hands plunged in the  water.[29] Misfortune rendered us ingenious, and every one thought of a  thousand means to alleviate his sufferings; extenuated by the most cruel  privations, the smallest agreeable sensation was to us a supreme happiness;  thus we eagerly sought a little empty phial, which one of us possessed, and  which had formerly contained essence of roses: as soon as we could get hold  of it we inhaled, with delight, the perfume which issued from it, and which  communicated to our senses the most soothing impressions. Some of us  reserved our portion of wine in little tin cups, and sucked up the wine  with a quill; this manner of taking it was very beneficial to us, and  quenched our thirst much more than if we had drunk it off at once. Even the  smell of this liquor was extremely agreeable to us. Mr. Savigny observed  that many of us, after having taken their small portion, fell into a state  approaching to intoxication, and that there was always more discord among  us after the distribution had been made.    The following is one instance, among many, which we could adduce. The tenth  day of our being on the raft, after a distribution of wine, Messrs.  Clairet, Coudin, Charlot, and one or two of our sailors, conceived the  strange idea of destroying themselves, first intoxicating themselves with  what remained in our barrel. In vain Captain Dupont, seconded by Messrs.  Lavillette, Savigny, Lheureux, and all the others, opposed their purpose by  urgent remonstrances, and by all the firmness of which they were  capable--their disordered brains persisted in the mad idea which governed  them, and a new combat was on the point of commencing; however, after  infinite trouble, we were beginning to bring back Messrs. Clairet and  Coudin to the use of their reason; or rather he who watched over us  dispelled this fatal quarrel, by turning our attention to the new danger  which threatened us, at the moment when cruel discord was, perhaps, about  to break out among wretches already a prey to so many other evils--it was a  number of sharks which came and surrounded our raft. They approached so  near, that we were able to strike them with our sabre, but we could not  subdue one of them, notwithstanding the goodness of the weapon we  possessed, and the ardour with which the brave Lavillette made use of it.  The blows which he struck these monsters, made them replunge into the sea;  but a few seconds after, they re-appeared upon the surface, and did not  seem at all alarmed at our presence. Their backs rose about 30 centimetres  above the water: several of them appeared to us to be at least 10 metres in  length.    Three days passed in inexpressible anguish; we despised life to such a  degree that many of us did not fear to bathe in sight of the sharks which  surrounded our raft; others placed themselves naked on the front part of  our machine which was still submerged: these means diminished, a little,  their burning thirst. A kind of polypus (mollusques),[30] known by seamen  under the name of _galere_, was frequently driven in great numbers on our  raft, and when their long arms clung to our naked bodies, they caused us  the most cruel sufferings. Will it be believed, that amidst these dreadful  scenes, struggling with inevitable death, some of us indulged in  pleasantries which excited a smile, notwithstanding the horror of our  situation? One, among others said, joking, \"_If the brig is sent to look  for us, let us pray to God that she may have the eyes of Argus_,\" alluding  to the name of the vessel, which we presumed would be sent after us. This  consolatory idea did not quit us an instant, and we spoke of it frequently.    During the day of the 16th, reckoning ourselves to be very near land, eight  of the most determined of us, resolved to try to reach the coast: we  unfastened a strong fish of a mast,[31] which made part of the little  parapet of which we have spoken, we fixed boards to it at intervals,  transversely, by means of great nails, to hinder it from upsetting; a  little mast and sail were fixed in the front; we intended to provide  ourselves with oars made of barrel staves, cut out with the only sabre we  had remaining: we cut pieces of rope, we split them, and made smaller  ropes, that were more easy to manage: a hammock cloth, which was by chance  on the raft, served for a sail; the dimensions of which, might be about 130  centimetres in breadth and 160 in length: the transverse diameter of the  fish was 60 or 70 centimetres, and its length about 12 metres. A certain  portion of wine was assigned to us, and our departure fixed for the next  day, the 17th. When our machine was finished, it remained to make a trial  of it: a sailor wanting to pass from the front to the back of it, finding  the mast in his way, set his foot on one of the cross boards; the weight of  his body made it upset, and this accident proved to us the temerity of our  enterprise. It was then resolved that we should all await death in our  present situation; the cable winch fastened the machine to our raft, was  made loose, and it drifted away. It is very certain that if we had ventured  upon this second raft, weak as we were, we should not have been able to  hold out six hours, with our legs in the water, and thus obliged  continually to row.    Mean time the night came, and its gloomy shades revived in our minds the  most afflicting thoughts; we were convinced that there were not above  twelve or fifteen bottles of wine left in our barrel. We began to feel an  invincible disgust at the flesh which had till then, scarcely supported us;  and we may say that the sight of it inspired us with a sentiment of terror,  which was doubtless produced by the idea of approaching destruction.    On the 17th, in the morning, the sun appeared entirely free from clouds;  after having put up our prayers to the Almighty, we divided among us, a  part of our wine; every one was taking with delight his small portion, when  a captain of infantry looking towards the horizon, descried a ship, and  announced it to us by an exclamation of joy: we perceived that it was a  brig; but it was at a very great distance; we could distinguish only the  tops of the masts. The sight of this vessel excited in us a transport of  joy which it would be difficult to describe; each of us believed his  deliverance certain, and we gave a thousand thanks to God; yet, fears  mingled with our hopes: we straitened some hoops of casks, to the end of  which we tied handkerchiefs of different colours. A man, assisted by us all  together, mounted to the top of the mast and waved these little flags.    For above half an hour, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],[0,"Dope (#15)"],[1,"contemplated cutting herself adrift from it all that she perceived  the Gordian knot which bound her to the drug coterie. How far, yet how  smoothly, by all but imperceptible stages she had glided down the stream  since that night when the gold box had lain upon her dressing-table!  Kazmah's drug store in Bond Street had few secrets for her; or so she  believed. She knew that the establishment of the strange, immobile  Egyptian was a source from which drugs could always be obtained; she  knew that the dream-reading business served some double purpose; but she  did not know the identity of Kazmah.    Two of the most insidious drugs familiar to modern pharmacy were wooing  her to slavery, and there was no strong hand to hold her back. Even the  presence of her mother might have offered some slight deterrent at this  stage of Rita's descent, but the girl had quitted her suburban home as  soon as her salary had rendered her sufficiently independent to do so,  and had established herself in a small but elegant flat situated in the  heart of theatreland.    But if she had walked blindly into the clutches of cocaine and veronal,  her subsequent experiments with chandu were prompted by indefensible  curiosity, and a false vanity which urged her to do everything that  was \"done\" by the ultra-smart and vicious set of which she had become a  member.    Her first introduction to opium-smoking was made under the auspices of  an American comedian then appearing in London, an old devotee of the  poppy, and it took place shortly after Sir Lucien Pyne had proposed  marriage to Rita. This proposal she had not rejected outright; she had  pleaded time for consideration. Monte Irvin was away, and Rita secretly  hoped that on his return he would declare himself. Meanwhile she  indulged in every new craze which became fashionable among her  associates. A chandu party took place at the American's flat in Duke  Street, and Rita, who had been invited, and who had consented to go with  Sir Lucien Pyne, met there for the first time the woman variously known  as \"Lola\" and \"Mrs. Sin.\"        CHAPTER XIII. A CHANDU PARTY    From the restaurant at which she had had supper with Sir Lucien, Rita  proceeded to Duke Street. Alighting from Pyne's car at the door, they  went up to the flat of the organizer of the opium party--Mr. Cyrus  Kilfane. One other guest was already present--a slender, fair woman, who  was introduced by the American as Mollie Gretna, but whose weakly pretty  face Rita recognized as that of a notorious society divorcee, foremost  in the van of every new craze, a past-mistress of the smartest vices.    Kilfane had sallow, expressionless features and drooping, light-colored  eyes. His straw-hued hair, brushed back from a sloping brow, hung lankly  down upon his coat-collar. Long familiarity with China's ruling vice and  contact with those who practiced it had brought about that mysterious  physical alteration--apparently reflecting a mental change--so often  to be seen in one who has consorted with Chinamen. Even the light eyes  seemed to have grown slightly oblique; the voice, the unimpassioned  greeting, were those of a son of Cathay. He carried himself with a stoop  and had a queer, shuffling gait.    \"Ah, my dear daughter,\" he murmured in a solemnly facetious manner, \"how  glad I am to welcome you to our poppy circle.\"    He slowly turned his half-closed eyes in Pyne's direction, and slowly  turned them back again.    \"Do you seek forgetfulness of old joys?\" he asked. \"This is my own case  and Pyne's. Or do you, as Mollie does, seek new joys--youth's eternal  quest?\"    Rita laughed with a careless abandon which belonged to that part of her  character veiled from the outer world.    \"I think I agree with Miss Gretna,\" she said lightly. \"There is not so  much happiness in life that I want to forget the little I have had.\"    \"Happiness,\" murmured Kilfane. \"There is no real happiness. Happiness is  smoke. Let us smoke.\"    \"I am curious, but half afraid,\" declared Rita. \"I have heard that opium  sometimes has no other effect than to make one frightfully ill.\"    \"Oh, my dear!\" cried Miss Gretna, with a foolish giggling laugh, \"you  will love it! Such fascinating dreams! Such delightful adventures!\"    \"Other drugs,\" drawled Sir Lucien, \"merely stimulate one's normal mental  activities. Chandu is a key to another life. Cocaine, for instance  enhances our capacity for work. It is only a heretic like De Quincey who  prostitutes the magic gum to such base purposes. Chandu is misunderstood  in Europe; in Asia it is the companion of the aesthete's leisure.\"    \"But surely,\" said Rita, \"one pipe of opium will not produce all these  wonders.\"    \"Some people never experience them at all,\" interrupted Miss Gretna.  \"The great idea is to get into a comfortable position, and just resign  yourself--let yourself go. Oh, it's heavenly!\"    Cyrus Kilfane turned his dull eyes in Rita's direction.    \"A question of temperament and adaptability,\" he murmured. \"De Quincey,  Pyne\"--slowly turning towards the baronet--\"is didactic, of course; but  his Confessions may be true, nevertheless. He forgets, you see, that he  possessed an unusual constitution, and the temperament of a Norwegian  herring. He forgets, too, that he was a laudanum drinker, not an opium  smoker. Now you, my daughter\"--the lustreless eyes again sought Rita's  flushed face--\"are vivid--intensely vital. If you can succeed in  resigning yourself to the hypnosis induced your experiences will be  delightful. Trust your Uncle Cy.\"    Leaving Rita chatting with Miss Gretna, Kilfane took Pyne aside,  offering him a cigarette from an ornate, jewelled case.    \"Hello,\" said the baronet, \"can you still get these?\"    \"With the utmost difficulty,\" murmured Kilfane, returning the case to  his pocket. \"Lola charges me five guineas a hundred for them, and only  supplies them as a favor. I shall be glad to get back home, Pyne. The  right stuff is the wrong price in London.\"    Sir Lucien laughed sardonically, lighting Kilfane's cigarette and then  his own.    \"I find it so myself,\" he said. \"Everything except opium is to be had at  Kazmah's, and nothing except opium interests me.\"    \"He supplies me with cocaine,\" murmured the comedian. \"His figure works  out, as nearly as I can estimate it, at 10s 7 1/2d. a grain. I saw him  about it yesterday afternoon, pointing out to the brown guy that as the  wholesale price is roughly 2 1/4d., I regarded his margin of profit as  somewhat broad.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"The first time I had ever seen him, Pyne. I brought an introduction  from Dr. Silver, of New York, and Kazmah supplied me without  question--at a price.\"    \"You always saw Rashid?\"    \"Yes. If there were other visitors I waited. But yesterday I made a  personal appointment with Kazmah. He pretended to think I had come to  have a dream interpreted. He is clever, Pyne. He never moved a muscle  throughout the interview. But finally he assured me that all the  receivers in England had amalgamated, and that the price he charged  represented a very narrow margin of profit. Of course he is a liar. He  is making a fortune. Do you know him personally?\"    \"No,\" replied Sir Lucien, \"outside his Bond Street home of mystery he is  unknown. A clever man, as you say. You obtain your opium from Lola?\"    \"Yes. Kazmah sent her to me. She keeps me on ridiculously low rations,  and if I had not brought my own outfit I don't think she would have  sold me one. Of course, her game is beating up clients for the Limehouse  dive.\"    \"You have visited 'The House of a Hundred Raptures'?\"    \"Many times, at week-ends. Opium, like wine, is better enjoyed in  company.\"    \"Does she post you the opium?\"    \"Oh, no; my man goes to Limehouse for it. Ah! here she is.\"    A woman came in, carrying a brown leather attache case. She had left her  hat and coat in the hall, and wore a smart blue serge skirt and a white  blouse. She was not tall, but she possessed a remarkably beautiful  figure which the cut of her garments was not intended to disguise, and  her height was appreciably increased by a pair of suede shoes having the  most wonderful heels which Rita ever remembered to have seen worn on or  off the stage. They seemed to make her small feet appear smaller, and  lent to her slender ankles an exaggerated frontal curve.    Her hair was of that true, glossy black which suggests the blue sheen of  raven's plumage, and her thickly fringed eyes were dark and southern as  her hair. She had full, voluptuous lips, and a bold self-assurance. In  the swift, calculating glance which she cast about the room there was  something greedy and evil; and when it rested upon Rita Dresden's dainty  beauty to the evil greed was added cruelty.    \"Another little sister, dear Lola,\" murmured Kilfane. \"Of course, you  know who it is? This, my daughter,\" turning the sleepy glance towards  Rita, \"is our officiating priestess, Mrs. Sin.\"    The woman so strangely named revealed her gleaming teeth in a swift,  unpleasant smile, then her nostrils dilated and she glanced about her  suspiciously.    \"Someone smokes the chandu cigarettes,\" she said, speaking in a low tone  which, nevertheless, failed to disguise her harsh voice, and with a very  marked accent.    \"I am the offender, dear Lola,\" said Kilfane, dreamily waving his  cigarette towards her. \"I have managed to make the last hundred spin  out. You have brought me a new supply?\"    \"Oh no, indeed,\" replied Mrs. Sin, tossing her head in a manner oddly  reminiscent of a once famous Spanish dancer. \"Next Tuesday you get some  more. Ah! it is no good! You talk and talk and it cannot alter anything.  Until they come I cannot give them to you.\"    \"But it appears to me,\" murmured Kilfane, \"that the supply is always  growing less.\"    \"Of course. The best goes all to Edinburgh now. I have only three sticks  of Yezd left of all my stock.\"    \"But the cigarettes.\"    \"Are from Buenos Ayres? Yes."]]]
