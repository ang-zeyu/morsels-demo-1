There was no real laughter anywhere that night.    The entire adventure seemed so incredible, here, in this twentieth  century--but yet delusion, that feeble word, did not occur once in the  comments my mind suggested though did not utter. I remembered that  forbidding Shadow too; my sister's watercolors; the vanished personality  of our hostess; the inexplicable, thundering Noise, and the figure of  Mrs. Marsh in her midnight ritual that was so childish yet so horrible.  I shivered in spite of my own \"emancipated\" cast of mind.    \"There is no Mabel,\" were the words with which my sister sent another  shower of ice down my spine. \"He has killed her in his lake of fire and  brimstone.\"    I stared at her blankly, as in a nightmare where nothing true or  possible ever happened.    \"He killed her in his lake of fire and brimstone,\" she repeated more  faintly.    A desperate effort was in me to say the strong, sensible thing which  should destroy the oppressive horror that grew so stiflingly about us  both, but again the mirror drew the attempted smile into the merest  grin, betraying the distortion that was everywhere in the place.    \"You mean,\" I stammered beneath my breath, \"that her faith has gone, but  that the terror has remained?\" I asked it, dully groping. I moved out of  the line of the reflection in the glass.    She bowed her head as though beneath a weight; her skin was the pallor  of grey ashes.    \"You mean,\" I said louder, \"that she has lost her--mind?\"    \"She is terror incarnate,\" was the whispered answer. \"Mabel has lost her  soul. Her soul is--there!\" She pointed horribly below. \"She is seeking  it ...?\"    The word \"soul\" stung me into something of my normal self again.    \"But her terror, poor thing, is not--cannot be--transferable to us!\" I  exclaimed more vehemently. \"It certainly is not convertible into  feelings, sights and--even sounds!\"    She interrupted me quickly, almost impatiently, speaking with that  conviction by which she conquered me so easily that night.    \"It is her terror that revived 'the Others.' It has brought her into  touch with them. They are loose and driving after her. Her efforts at  resistance have given them also hope--that escape, after all, is  possible. Day and night they strive.    \"Escape! Others!\" The anger fast rising in me dropped of its own accord  at the moment of birth. It shrank into a shuddering beyond my control.  In that moment, I think, I would have believed in the possibility of  anything and everything she might tell me. To argue or contradict seemed  equally futile.    \"His strong belief, as also the beliefs of others who have preceded  him,\" she replied, so sure of herself that I actually turned to look  over my shoulder, \"have left their shadow like a thick deposit over the  house and grounds. To them, poor souls imprisoned by thought, it was  hopeless as granite walls--until her resistance, her effort to dissipate  it--let in light. Now, in their thousands, they are flocking to this  little light, seeking escape. Her own escape, don't you see, may release  them all!\"    It took my breath away. Had his predecessors, former occupants of this  house, also preached damnation of all the world but their own exclusive  sect? Was this the explanation of her obscure talk of \"layers,\" each  striving against the other for domination? And if men are spirits, and  these spirits survive, could strong Thought thus determine their  condition even afterwards?    So many questions flooded into me that I selected no one of them, but  stared in uncomfortable silence, bewildered, out of my depth, and  acutely, painfully distressed. There was so odd a mixture of possible  truth and incredible, unacceptable explanation in it all; so much  confirmed, yet so much left darker than before. What she said did,  indeed, offer a quasi-interpretation of my own series of abominable  sensations--strife, agony, pity, hate, escape--but so far-fetched that  only the deep conviction in her voice and attitude made it tolerable for  a second even. I found myself in a curious state of mind. I could  neither think clearly nor say a word to refute her amazing statements,  whispered there beside me in the shivering hours of the early morning  with only a wall between ourselves and--Mabel. Close behind her words I  remember this singular thing, however--that an atmosphere as of the  Inquisition seemed to rise and stir about the room, beating awful wings  of black above my head.    Abruptly, then, a moment's common sense returned to me. I faced her.    \"And the Noise?\" I said aloud, more firmly, \"the roar of the closing  doors? We have all heard that! Is that subjective too?\"    Frances looked sideways about her in a queer fashion that made my flesh  creep again. I spoke brusquely, almost angrily. I repeated the question,  and waited with anxiety for her reply.    \"What noise?\" she asked, with the frank expression of an innocent child.  \"What closing doors?\"    But her face turned from grey to white, and I saw that drops of  perspiration glistened on her forehead. She caught at the back of a  chair to steady herself, then glanced about her again with that sidelong  look that made my blood run cold. I understood suddenly then. She did  not take in what I said. I knew now. She was listening--for something  else.    And the discovery revived in me a far stronger emotion than any mere  desire for immediate explanation. Not only did I not insist upon an  answer, but I was actually terrified lest she would answer. More, I felt  in me a terror lest I should be moved to describe my own experiences  below-stairs, thus increasing their reality and so the reality of all.  She might even explain them too!    Still listening intently, she raised her head and looked me in the eyes.  Her lips opened to speak. The words came to me from a great distance, it  seemed, and her voice had a sound like a stone that drops into a deep  well, its fate though hidden, known.    \"We are in it with her, too, Bill. We are in it with her. Our  interpretations vary--because we are--in parts of it only. Mabel is in  it--all.\"    The desire for violence came over me. If only she would say a definite  thing in plain King's English! If only I could find it in me to give  utterance to what shouted so loud within me! If only--the same old cry--  something would happen! For all this elliptic talk that dazed my mind  left obscurity everywhere. Her atrocious meaning, nonetheless, flashed  through me, though vanishing before it wholly divulged itself.    It brought a certain reaction with it. I found my tongue. Whether I  actually believed what I said is more than I can swear to; that it  seemed to me wise at the moment is all I remember. My mind was in a  state of obscure perception less than that of normal consciousness.    \"Yes, Frances, I believe that what you say is the truth, and that we are  in it with her\"--I meant to say I with loud, hostile emphasis, but  instead I whispered it lest she should hear the trembling of my voice--  \"and for that reason, my dear sister, we leave tomorrow, you and I--  today, rather, since it is long past midnight--we leave this house of  the damned. We go back to London.\"    Frances looked up, her face distraught almost beyond recognition. But it  was not my words that caused the tumult in her heart. It was a sound--  the sound she had been listening for--so faint I barely caught it  myself, and had she not pointed I could never have known the direction  whence it came. Small and terrible it rose again in the stillness of the  night, the sound of gnashing teeth. And behind it came another--the  tread of stealthy footsteps. Both were just outside the door.    The room swung round me for a second. My first instinct to prevent my  sister going out--she had dashed past me frantically to the door--gave  place to another when I saw the expression in her eyes. I followed her  lead instead; it was surer than my own. The pistol in my pocket swung  uselessly against my thigh. I was flustered beyond belief and ashamed  that I was so.    \"Keep close to me, Frances,\" I said huskily, as the door swung wide and  a shaft of light fell upon a figure moving rapidly. Mabel was going down  the corridor. Beyond her, in the shadows on the staircase, a second  figure stood beckoning, scarcely visible.    \"Before they get her! Quick!\" was screamed into my ears, and our arms  were about her in the same moment. It was a horrible scene. Not that  Mabel struggled in the least, but that she collapsed as we caught her  and fell with her dead weight, as of a corpse, limp, against us. And her  teeth began again. They continued, even beneath the hand that Frances  clapped upon her lips....    We carried her back into her own bedroom, where she lay down peacefully  enough. It was so soon over.... The rapidity of the whole thing robbed  it of reality almost. It had the swiftness of something remembered  rather than of something witnessed. She slept again so quickly that it  was almost as if we had caught her sleepwalking. I cannot say. I asked  no questions at the time; I have asked none since; and my help was  needed as little as the protection of my pistol. Frances was strangely  competent and collected.... I lingered for some time uselessly by the  door, till at length, looking up with a sigh, she made a sign for me to  go.    \"I shall wait in your room next door,\" I whispered, \"till you come.\"  But, though going out, I waited in the corridor instead, so as to hear  the faintest call for help. In that dark corridor upstairs I waited, but  not long. It may have been fifteen minutes when Frances reappeared,  locking the door softly behind her. Leaning over the banisters, I saw  her.    \"I'll go in again about six o'clock,\" she whispered, \"as soon as it gets  light. She is sound asleep now.

The  other feller grabs his shoulder and jerks him over on his back.    \"He stands lookin' down at him for a moment, and then he says, sort of  thoughtful: 'He isn't badly hurt, but I suppose I shouldn't have hit him  twice.'    \"Can you beat that, Steve? You can't!    \"When Sandy come to he got up to his feet, wobbling--seen his guns--went  over and scooped 'em up, with the eye of the tenderfoot on him all the  time--scooped 'em up--stood with 'em all poised--and so he backed out  through the door. It wasn't any pretty thing to see. The tenderfoot, he  turned to the bar again.    \"'If you don't mind,' he says, 'I think I'll switch my order and take  that whisky instead. I seem to need it.'    \"'Son!' says I, 'there ain't nothin' in the house you can't have for the  askin'. Try some of this!'    \"And I pulled out a bottle of my private stock--you know the stuff; I've  had it twenty-five years, and it was ten years old when I got it. That  ain't as much of a lie as it sounds.    \"He takes a glass of it and sips it, sort of suspicious, like a wolf  scentin' the wind for an elk in winter. Then his face lighted up like a  lantern had been flashed on it. You'd of thought that he was lookin' his  long-lost brother in the eye from the way he smiled at me. He holds the  glass up and lets the light come through it, showin' the little traces  and bubbles of oil.    \"'May I know your name?' he says.    \"It made me feel like Rockerbilt, hearin' him say that, in _that_  special voice.    \"'Me,' says I, 'I'm Flanders.'    \"'It's an honour to know you, Mr. Flanders,' he says. 'My name is  Anthony Bard.'    \"We shook hands, and his grip was three fourths man, I'll tell the  world.    \"'Good liquor,' says he, 'is like a fine lady. Only a gentleman can  appreciate it. I drink to you, sir.'    \"So that's how Sandy Ferguson went under the sod. To-day? Well, I  couldn't let Ferguson stand in a barroom where a gentleman had been,  could I?\"          CHAPTER XV      THE DARKNESS IN ELDARA    Even the stout roan grew weary during the third day, and when they  topped the last rise of hills, and looked down to darker shadows in  Eldara in the black heart of the hollow, the mustang stood with hanging  head, and one ear flopped forward. Cruel indeed had been the pace which  Nash maintained, yet they had never been able to overhaul the flying  piebald of Anthony Bard.    As they trotted down the slope, Nash looked to his equipment, handled  his revolver, felt the strands of the lariat, and resting only his toes  in the stirrups, eased all his muscles to make sure that they were  uncramped from the long journey. He was fit; there was no doubt of that.    Coming down the main street--for Eldara boasted no fewer than three  thoroughfares--the first houses which Nash passed showed no lights. As  far as he could see, the blinds were all drawn; not even the glimmer of  a candle showed, and the voices which he heard were muffled and low.    He thought of plague or some other disaster which might have overtaken  the little village and wiped out nine tenths of the populace in a day.  Only such a thing could account for silence in Eldara. There should have  been bursts and roars of laughter here and there, and now and then a  harsh stream of cursing. There should have been clatter of kitchen tins;  there should have been neighing of horses; there should have been the  quiver and tingle of children's voices at play in the dusty streets. But  there was none of this. The silence was as thick and oppressive as the  unbroken dark of the night. Even Butler's saloon was closed!    This, however, was something which he would not believe, no matter what  testimony his eyes gave him. He rode up to a shuttered window and kicked  it with his heel.    Only the echoes of that racket replied to him from the interior of the  place. He swore, somewhat touched with awe, and kicked again.    A faint voice called: \"Who's there?\"    \"Steve Nash. What the devil's happened to Eldara?\"    The boards of the shutter stirred, opened, so that the man within could  look out.    \"Is it Steve, honest?\"    \"Damn it, Butler, don't you know my voice? What's turned Eldara into a  cemetery?\"    \"Cemetery's right. 'Butch' Conklin and his gang are going to raid the  place to-night.\"    \"Butch Conklin?\"    And Nash whistled long and low.    \"But why the devil don't the boys get together if they know Butch is  coming with his gunmen?\"    \"That's what they've done. Every able-bodied man in town is out in the  hills trying to surprise Conklin's gang before they hit town with their  guns going.\"    Butler was a one-legged man, so Nash kept back the question which  naturally formed in his mind.    \"How do they know Conklin is coming? Who gave the tip?\"    \"Conklin himself.\"    \"What? Has he been in town?\"    \"Right. Came in roaring drunk.\"    \"Why'd they let him get away again?\"    \"Because the sheriff's a bonehead and because our marshal is solid  ivory. That's why.\"    \"What happened?\"    \"Butch came in drunk, as I was saying, which he generally is, but he  wasn't giving no trouble at all, and nobody felt particular called on to  cross him and ask questions. He was real sociable, in fact, and that's  how the mess was started.\"    \"Go on. I don't get your drift.\"    \"Everybody was treatin' Butch like he was the king of the earth and not  passin' out any backtalk, all except one tenderfoot----\"    But here a stream of tremendous profanity burst from Nash. It rose, it  rushed on, it seemed an exhaustless vocabulary built up by long practice  on mustangs and cattle.    At length: \"Is that damned fool in Eldara?\"    \"D'you know him?\"    \"No. Anyway, go on. What happened?\"    \"I was sayin' that Butch was feelin' pretty sociable. It went all right  in the bars. He was in here and didn't do nothin' wrong. Even paid for  all the drinks for everybody in the house, which nobody could ask more  even from a white man. But then Butch got hungry and went up the street  to Sally Fortune's place.\"    A snarl came from Nash.    \"Did they let that swine go in there?\"    \"Who'd stop him? Would you?\"    \"I'd try my damnedest.\"    \"Anyway, in he went and got the centre table and called for ten dollars'  worth of bacon and eggs--which there hasn't been an egg in Eldara this  week. Sally, she told him, not being afraid even of Butch. He got pretty  sore at that and said that it was a frame-up and everyone was ag'in'  him. But finally he allowed that if she'd sit down to the table and keep  him company he'd manage to make out on whatever her cook had ready to  eat.\"    \"And Sally done it?\" groaned Nash.    \"Sure; it was like a dare--and you know Sally. She'd risk her whole  place any time for the sake of a bet.\"    \"I know it, but don't rub it in.\"    \"She fetched out a steak and served Butch as if he'd been a king and  then sat down beside him and started kiddin' him along, with all the  gang of us sittin' or standin' around and laughin' fit to bust, but not  loud for fear Butch would get annoyed.    \"Then two things come in together and spoiled the prettiest little party  that was ever started in Eldara. First was that player piano which Sally  got shipped in and paid God-knows-how-much for; the second was this  greenhorn I was tellin' you about.\"    \"Go on,\" said Nash, the little snarl coming back in his voice. \"Tell me  how the tenderfoot walked up and kicked Butch out of the place.\"    \"Somebody been tellin' you?\"    \"No; I just been readin' the mind of Eldara.\"    \"It was a nice play, though. This Bard--we found out later that was his  name--walks in, takes a table, and not being served none too quick, he  walks over and slips a nickel in the slot of the piano. Out she starts  with a piece of rippin' ragtime--you know how loud it plays? Butch, he  kept on talkin' for a minute, but couldn't hear himself think. Finally  he bellers: 'Who turned that damned tin-pan loose?'    \"This Bard walks up and bows. He says: 'Sir, I came here to find food,  and since I can't get service, I'll take music as a substitute.'    \"Them was the words he used, Steve, honest to God. Used them to Butch!    \"Well, Conklin was too flabbergasted to budge, and Bard, he leaned over  and says to Sally: 'This floor is fairly smooth. Suppose you and I dance  till I get a chance to eat?'    \"We didn't know whether to laugh or to cheer, but most of us compromised  by keeping an eye on Butch's gun.    \"Sally says, 'Sure I'll dance,' and gets up.    \"'Wait!' hollers Butch; 'are you leavin' me for this wall-eyed galoot?'    \"There ain't nothin' Sally loves more'n a fight--we all know that. But  this time I guess she took pity on the poor tenderfoot, or maybe she  jest didn't want to get her floor all messed up.    \"'Keep your hat on, Butch,' she says, 'all I want to do is to give him  some motherly advice.'    \"'If you're acting that part,' says Bard, calm as you please, 'I've got  to tell mother that she's been keeping some pretty bad company.'    \"'Some what?' bellers Butch, not believin' his ears.    \"And young Bard, he steps around the girl and stands over Butch.    \"'Bad company is what I said,' he repeats, 'but maybe I can be  convinced.'    \"'Easy,' says Butch, and reaches for his gun.    \"We all dived for the door, but me being held up on account of my  missing leg, I was slow an' couldn't help seein' what happened. Butch  was fast, but the young feller was faster. He had Butch by the wrist  before the gun came clear--just gave a little twist--and there he stood  with the gun in his hand pointin' into Butch's face, and Butch sittin'  there like a feller in a trance or wakin' up out of a bad dream.    \"Then he gets up, slow and dignified, though he had enough liquor in him  to float a ship.    \"'I been mobbed,' he says, 'it's easy to see that. I come here peaceful  and quiet, and here I been mobbed. But I'm comin' back, boys, and I  ain't comin' alone.'    \"There "]]]
