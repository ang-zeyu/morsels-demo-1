Here was the only event, under  Louis the Young's reign, of any real importance, in view of its long and  bloody consequences for his country.  A Petty war or a sullen strife  between the Kings of France and England, petty quarrels of Louis with  some of the great lords of his kingdom, certain rigorous measures against  certain districts in travail of local liberties, the first bubblings of  that religious fermentation which resulted before long, in the south of  France, in the crusade against the Albigensians--such were the facts  which went to make up with somewhat of insipidity the annals of this  reign.  So long as Suger lived, the kingship preserved at home the wisdom  which it had been accustomed to display, and abroad the respect it had  acquired under Louis the Fat; but at the death of Suger it went on  languishing and declining, without encountering any great obstacles.  It  was reserved for Louis the Young's son, Philip Augustus, to open for  France, and for the kingship in France, a new era of strength and  progress.    Philip II., to whom history has preserved the name of Philip Augustus,  given him by his contemporaries, had shared the crown, been anointed, and  taken to wife Isabel of Hainault, a year before the death of Louis VII.  put him in possession of the kingdom.  He was as yet only fifteen, and  his father, by his will, had left him under the guidance of Philip of  Alsace, Count of Flanders, as regent, and of Robert Clement, marshal of  France, as governor.  But Philip, though he began his reign under this  double influence, soon let it be seen that he intended to reign by  himself, and to reign with vigor.  \"Whatever my vassals do,\" said he,  during his minority, \"I must bear with their violence and outrageous  insults and villanous misdeeds; but, please God, they will get weak and  old whilst I shall grow in strength and power, and shall be, in my turn,  avenged according to my desire.\"  He was hardly twenty, when, one day,  one of his barons seeing him gnawing, with an air of abstraction and  dreaminess, a little green twig, said to his neighbors, \"If any one could  tell me what the king is thinking of, I would give him my best horse.\"  Another of those present boldly asked the King.  \"I am thinking,\"  answered Philip, \"of a certain matter, and that is, whether God will  grant unto me or unto one of my heirs grace to exalt France to the height  at which she was in the time of Charlemagne.\"    It was not granted to Philip Augustus to resuscitate the Frankish empire  of Charlemagne, a work impossible for him or any one whatsoever in the  twelfth and thirteenth centuries; but he made the extension and  territorial construction of the kingdom of France the chief aim of his  life, and in that work he was successful.  Out of the forty-three years  of his reign, twenty-six at the least were war-years, devoted to that  very purpose.  During the first six, it was with some of his great French  vassals, the Count of Champagne, the Duke of Burgundy, and even the Count  of Flanders, sometime regent, that Philip had to do battle, for they all  sought to profit by his minority so as to make themselves independent and  aggrandize themselves at the expense of the crown; but, once in  possession of the personal power as well as the title of king, it was,  from 1187 to 1216, against three successive kings of England, Henry II.,  Richard Coeur de Lion, and John Lackland, masters of the most beautiful  provinces of France, that Philip directed his persistent efforts.  They  were in respect of power, of political capacity and military popularity,  his most formidable foes.  Henry II., what with his ripeness of age, his  ability, energy, and perseverance, without any mean jealousy or puerile  obstinacy, had over Philip every advantage of position and experience,  and he availed himself thereof with discretion, habitually maintaining  his feudal status of great French vassal as well as that of foreign  sovereign, seeking peace rather than strife with his youthful suzerain,  and some-times even going to his aid.  He thus played off the greater  part of the undeclared attempts or armed expeditions by which, from 1186  to 1189, Philip tried to cut him short in his French possessions, and,  so long as Henry IL lived, there were but few changes in the territorial  proportions of the two states.  But, at Henry's death, Philip found  himself in a very different position towards Henry's two sons, Richard  Coeur de Lion and John Lackland.  They were of his own generation; he had  been on terms with them, even in opposition to their own father, of  complicity and familiarity: they had no authority over him, and he had no  respect for them.  Richard was the feudal prince, beyond comparison the  boldest, the most unreflecting, the most passionate, the most ruffianly,  the most heroic adventurer of the middle ages, hungering after movement  and action, possessed of a craving spirit for displaying his strength,  and doing his pleasure at all times and in all places, not only in  contempt of the rights and well-being of his subjects, but at the risk of  his own safety, his own power, and even of his crown.  Philip was of a  sedate temperament, patient, persevering, moved but little by the spirit  of adventure, more ambitious than fiery, capable of far-reaching designs,  and discreet at the same time that he was indifferent as to the  employment of means.  He had fine sport with Richard.  We have already  had the story of the relations between them, and their rupture during  their joint crusade in the East.  On returning to the West, Philip did  not wrest from King Richard those great and definitive conquests which  were to restore to France the greater part of the marriage-portion that  went with Eleanor of Aquitaine; but he paved the way for them by petty  victories and petty acquisitions, and by making more and more certain his  superiority over his rival.  When, after Richard's death, he had to do  with John Lackland, cowardly and insolent, knavish and addle-pated,  choleric, debauched, and indolent, an intriguing subordinate on the  throne on which he made pretence to be the most despotic of kings, Philip  had over him, even more than over his brother Richard, immense  advantages.  He made such use of them that after six years' struggling,  from 1199 to 1205, he deprived John of the greater part of his French  possessions, Anjou, Normandy, Touraine, Maine, and Poitou.  Philip would  have been quite willing to dispense with any legal procedure by way of  sanction to his conquests, but John furnished him with an excellent  pretext; for on the 3d of April, 1203, he assassinated with his own hand,  in the tower of Rouen, his young nephew Arthur, Duke of Brittany, and in  that capacity vassal of Philip Augustus, to whom he was coming to do  homage.  Philip had John, also his vassal, cited before the court of the  barons of France, his peers, to plead his defence of this odious act.  \"King John,\" says the contemporary English historian Matthew Paris, \"sent  Eustace, Bishop of Ely, to tell King Philip that he would willingly go to  his court to answer before his judges, and to show entire obedience in  the matter, but that he must have a safe-conduct.  King Philip replied,  but with neither heart nor visage unmoved, 'Willingly; let him come in  peace and safety.'  'And return so too, my lord?' said the bishop.  'Yes,' rejoined the king, 'if the decision of his peers allow him.'  And when the envoys from England entreated him to grant to the King of  England to go and return in safety, the King of France was wroth, and  answered with his usual oath, 'No, by all the saints of France, unless  the decision tally therewith.'  'My lord king,' rejoined the bishop, 'the  Duke of Normandy cannot come unless there come also the King of England,  since the duke and the king are one and the same person.  The baronage of  England would never allow it in any way, and if the king were willing,  he would run, as you know, risk of imprisonment or death.'  King Philip  answered him, 'How now, my lord bishop?  It is well known that my  liegeman, the Duke of Normandy, by violence got possession of England.  And so, prithee, if a vassal increase in honor and power, shall his lord  suzerain lose his rights?  Never!'    \"King John was not willing to trust to chance and the decision of the  French, who liked him not; and he feared above everything to be  reproached with the shameful murder of Arthur.  The grandees of France,  nevertheless, proceeded to a decision, which they could not do lawfully,  since he whom they had to try was absent, and would have gone had he been  able.\"    The condemnation, not a whit the less, took full effect; and Philip  Augustus thus recovered possession of nearly all the territories which  his father, Louis VII., had kept but for a moment.  He added, in  succession, other provinces to his dominions; in such wise that the  kingdom of France, which was limited, as we have seen, under Louis the  Fat, to the Ile-de-France and certain portions of Picardy and Orleanness,  comprised besides, at the end of the reign of Philip Augustus,  Vermandois, Artois, the two Vexins, French and Norman, Berri, Normandy,  Maine, Anjou, Poitou, Touraine, and Auvergne.    In 1206 the territorial work of Philip Augustus was well nigh completed;  but his wars were not over.  John Lackland, when worsted, kicked against  the pricks, and was incessantly hankering, in his antagonism to the King  of France, after hostile alliances and local conspiracies easy to hatch  amongst certain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#15)"],[1,"se, save against the English.\"    There was universal and sincere joy.  The peace fulfilled the  requirements at the same time of the public welfare and of national  feeling; it was the only means of re-establishing order at home, and  driving from the kingdom the foreigner who aspired to conquer it.  Only  the friends of the Duke of Orleans, and of the Count of Armagnac, one  assassinated twelve years before, and the other massacred but lately,  remained sad and angry at not having yet been able to obtain either  justice or vengeance; but they maintained reserve and silence.  They were  not long in once more finding for mistrust and murmuring grounds or  pretexts which a portion of the public showed a disposition to take up.  The Duke of Burgundy had made haste to publish his ratification of the  treaty of reconciliation; the _dauphin_ had let his wait.  The Parisians  were astounded not to see either the _dauphin_ or the Duke of Burgundy  coming back within their walls, and at being, as it were, forgotten and  deserted amidst the universal making-up.  They complained that no armed  force was being collected to oppose the English, and that there was an  appearance of flying before them, leaving open to them Paris, in which at  this time there was no captain of renown.  They were still more troubled  when, on the 29th of July, they saw the arrival at the St. Denis gate of  a multitude of disconsolate fugitives, some wounded, and others dropping  from hunger, thirst, and fatigue.  When they were asked who they were,  and what was the reason of their desperate condition, \"We are from  Pontoise,\" they said; \"the English took the town this morning; they  killed or wounded all before them; happy he whosoever could escape from  their hands; never were Saracens so cruel to Christians as yonder folk  are.\"  It was a real fact.  The King of England, disquieted at the  reconciliation between the Duke of Burgundy and the _dauphin_, and at the  ill success of his own proposals at the conference of the 30th of May  preceding, had vigorously resumed the war, in order to give both the  reunited French factions a taste of his resolution and power.  He had  suddenly attacked and carried Pontoise, where the command was in the  hands of the lord of Isle-Adam, one of the most valiant Burgundian  officers.  Isle-Adam, surprised and lacking sufficient force, had made a  feeble resistance.  There was no sign of an active union on the part of  the two French factions for the purpose of giving the English battle.  Duke John, who had fallen back upon Troyes, sent order upon order for his  vassals from Burgundy, but they did not come up.  Public alarm and  distrust were day by day becoming stronger.  Duke John, it was said, was  still keeping up secret communications with the seditious in Paris and  with the King of England; why did he not act with more energy against  this latter, the common enemy?  The two princes in their conference of  July 9, near Melun, had promised to meet again; a fresh interview  appeared necessary in order to give efficacy to their reconciliation.  Duke John was very pressing for the _dauphin_ to go to Troyes, where the  king and queen happened to be. The _dauphin_ on his side was earnestly  solicited by the most considerable burgesses of Paris to get this  interview over in order to insure the execution of the treaty of peace  which had been sworn to with the Duke of Burgundy.  The _dauphin_ showed  a disposition to listen to these entreaties.  He advanced as far as  Montereau in order to be ready to meet Duke John as soon as a place of  meeting should be fixed.    Duke John hesitated, from irresolution even more than from distrust.  It  was a serious matter for him to commit himself more and more, by his own  proper motion, against the King of England and his old allies amongst the  populace of Paris.  Why should he be required to go in person to seek the  _dauphin_?  It was far simpler, he said, for Charles to come to the king  his father.  Tanneguy Duchatel went to Troyes to tell the duke that the  _dauphin_ had come to meet him as far as Montereau, and, with the help of  the lady of Giae, persuaded on his side, to Bray-sur-Seine, two leagues  from Montereau.  When the two princes had drawn thus near, their agents  proposed that the interview should take place on the very bridge of  Montereau, with the precautions and according to the forms decided on.  In the duke's household many of his most devoted servants were opposed  to this interview; the place, they said, had been chosen by and would be  under the ordering of the _dauphin_'s people, of the old servants of the  Duke of Orleans and the Count of Armagnac.  At the same time four  successive messages came from Paris urging the duke to make the plunge;  and at last he took his resolution.  \"It is my duty,\" said he, \"to risk  my person in order to get at so great a blessing as peace.  Whatever  happens, my wish is peace.  If they kill me, I shall die a martyr.  Peace  being made, I will take the men of my lord the _dauphin_ to go and fight  the English.  He has some good men of war and some sagacious captains.  Tanneguy and Barbazan are valiant knights.  Then we shall see which is  the better man, Jack (Hannotin) of Flanders or Henry of Lancaster.\"  He  set out for Bray on the 10th of September, 1419, and arrived about two  o'clock before Montereau.  Tanneguy Duchatel came and met him there.  \"Well,\" said the duke, \"on your assurance we are come to see my lord the  _dauphin_, supposing that he is quite willing to keep the peace between  himself and us, as we also will keep it, all ready to serve him according  to his wishes.\"  \"My most dread lord,\" answered Tanneguy, \"have ye no  fear; my lord is well pleased with you, and desires henceforth to govern  himself according to your counsels.  You have about him good friends who  serve you well.\"  It was agreed that the _dauphin_ and the duke should,  each from his own side, go upon the bridge of Montereau, each with ten  men-at-arms, of whom they should previously forward a list.  The  _dauphin_'s people had caused to be constructed at the two ends of the  bridge strong barriers closed by a gate; about the centre of the bridge  was a sort of lodge made of planks, the entrance to which was, on either  side, through a pretty narrow passage; within the lodge there was no  barrier in the middle to separate the two parties.  Whilst Duke John and  his confidants, in concert with the _dauphin_'s people, were regulating  these material arrangements, a chamber-attendant ran in quite scared,  shouting out, \"My lord, look to yourself; without a doubt you will be  betrayed.\"  The duke turned towards Tanneguy, and said, \"We trust  ourselves to your word; in God's holy name, are you quite sure of what  you have told us?  For you would do ill to betray us.\"  \"My most dread  lord,\" answered Tanneguy, \"I would rather be dead than commit treason  against you or any other: have ye no fear; I certify you that my lord  meaneth you no evil.\"  \"Very well, we will go then, trusting in God and  you,\" re-joined the duke; and he set out walking to the bridge.  On  arriving at the barrier on the castle side he found there to receive him  Sire de Beauveau and Tanneguy Duchatel.  \"Come to my lord,\" said they;  \"he is awaiting you.\"  \"Gentlemen,\" said the duke, \"you see how I come;\"  and he showed them that he and his people had only their swords; then  clapping Tanneguy on the shoulder, he said, \"Here is he in whom I trust,\"  and advanced towards the _dauphin_, who remained standing, on the town  side, at the end of the lodge constructed in the middle of the bridge.  On arriving at the prince's presence Duke John took off his velvet cap  and bent his knee to the ground.  \"My lord,\" said he, \"after God, my duty  is to obey and serve you; I offer to apply thereto and employ therein my  body, my friends, my allies, and well-wishers.  Say I well?\" he added,  fixing his eyes on the _dauphin_.  \"Fair cousin,\" answered the prince,  \"you say so well that none could say better; rise and be covered.\"  Conversation thereupon ensued between the two princes.  The _dauphin_  complained of the duke's delay in coming to see him: \"For eighteen days,\"  he said, \"you have made us await your coming in this place of Montereau,  this place a prey to epidemic and mortality, at the risk of and probably  with an eye to our personal danger.\"  The duke, surprised and troubled,  resumed his haughty and exacting tone: \"We can neither do nor advise  aught,\" said he, \"save in your father's presence; you must come thither.\"  \"I shall go when I think proper,\" said Charles, \"and not at your will and  pleasure; it is well known that whatever we do, we two together, the king  will be content therewith.\"  Then he reproached the duke with his  inertness against the English, with the capture of Pontoise, and with his  alliances amongst the promoters of civil war.  The conversation was  becoming more and more acrid and biting.  \"In so doing,\" added the  _dauphin_, \"you were wanting to your duty.\"  \"My lord,\" replied the duke,  \"I did only what it was my duty to do.\"  \"Yes, you were wanting,\"  repeated Charles.  \"No,\" replied the duke.  It was probably at these  words that, the lookers-on also waxing wroth, Tanneguy Duchatel told the  duke that the time had come for expiating the murder of the Duke of  Orleans, which none of them had forgotten, and raised his battle-axe to  strike the duke.  Sire de Navailles, who happened to be at his master's  side, arrested the weapon; but, on the other hand, the Viscount of  Narbonne raised his over Navailles, saying, \"Whoever stirs is a dead  man.\"  At this moment, it is said, the mob which was thronging before the  barriers at the end of the bridge heard cries of \"Alarm! slay, slay.\"  Tanneguy had struck and felled the duke; several others ran their swords  into him; and he expired.  The _dauphin_ had withdrawn from the scene and  gone"]]]
