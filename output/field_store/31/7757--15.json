'The blessing' of roads and railways is a return no  self-respecting nation would accept for its degradation. 'The blessing'  of education is proving one of the greatest obstacles in our progress  towards freedom.      A MOVEMENT OF PURIFICATION    The fact is that non-co-operation by reason of its non-violence has  become a religious and purifying movement. It is daily bringing strength  to the nation, showing it its weak spots and the remedy for removing  them. It is a movement of self-reliance. It is the mightiest force for  revolutionising opinion and stimulating thought. It is a movement of  self-imposed suffering and therefore possesses automatic checks against  extravagance or impatience. The capacity of the nation for suffering  regulates its advance towards freedom. It isolates the force of evil by  refraining from participation in it, in any shape or form.      WHY WAS INDIA LOST?    [A dialog between the Reader and Editor,--_Indian Home Rule_].    Reader: You have said much about civilisation--enough to make me ponder  over it. I do not know what I should adopt and what I should avoid from  the nations of Europe. but one question comes to my lips immediately. If  civilisation is a disease, and if it has attacked England why has she  been able to take India, and why is she able to retain it?    Editor: Your question is not very difficult to answer, and we shall  presently be able to examine the true nature of Swaraj; for I am aware  that I have still to answer that question. I will, however, take up your  previous question. The English have not taken India; we have given it to  them. They are not in India because of their strength, but because we  keep them. Let us now see whether these positions can be sustained. They  came to our country originally for the purpose of trade. Recall the  Company Bahadur. Who made it Bahadur? They had not the slightest  intention at the time of establishing a kingdom. Who assisted the  Company's officers? Who was tempted at the sight of their silver? Who  bought their goods? History testifies that we did all this. In order to  become rich all at once, we welcomed the Company's officers with open  arms. We assisted them. If I am in the habit of drinking Bhang, and a  seller thereof sells it to me, am I to blame him or myself? By blaming  the seller shall I be able to avoid the habit? And, if a particular  retailer is driven away will not another take his place? A true servant  of India will have to go to the root of the matter. If an excess of food  has caused me indigestion I will certainly not avoid it by blaming  water. He is a true physician who probes the cause of disease and, if  you pose as a physician for the disease of India, you will have to find  out its true cause.    Reader: You are right. Now, I think you will not have to argue much with  me to drive your conclusions home. I am impatient to know your further  views. We are now on a most interesting topic. I shall, therefore,  endeavour to follow your thought, and stop you when I am in doubt.    Editor: I am afraid that, in spite of your enthusiasm, as we proceed  further we shall have differences of opinion. Nevertheless, I shall  argue only when you will stop me. We have already seen that the English  merchants were able to get a footing in India because we encouraged  them. When our princes fought among themselves, they sought the  assistance of Company Bahadar. That corporation was versed alike in  commerce and war. It was unhampered by questions of morality. Its object  was to increase its commerce and to make money. It accepted our  assistance, and increased the number of its warehouses. To protect the  latter it employed an army which was utilised by us also. Is it not then  useless to blame the English for what we did at that time? The Hindus  and the Mahomedans were at daggers drawn. This, too, gave the Company  its opportunity, and thus we created the circumstances that gave the  Company its control over India. Hence it is truer to say that we gave  India to the English than that India was lost.    Reader: Will you now tell me how they are able to retain India?    Editor: The causes that gave them India enable them to retain it. Some  Englishmen state that they took, and they hold, India by the sword. Both  these statements are wrong. The sword is entirely useless for holding  India. We alone keep them. Napoleon is said to have described the  English as a nation of shop keepers. It is a fitting description. They  hold whatever dominions they have for the sake of their commerce. Their  army and their navy are intended to protect it. When the Transvaal  offered no such attractions, the late Mr. Gladstone discovered that it  was no right for the English to hold it. When it became a paying  proposition, resistance led to war. Mr. Chamberlain soon discovered that  England enjoyed a suzerainty over the Transvaal. It is related that some  one asked the late President Kruger whether there was gold in the moon?  He replied that it was highly unlikely, because, if there were, the  English would have annexed it. Many problems can be solved by  remembering that money is their God. Then it follows that we keep the  English in India for our base self-interest. We like their commerce,  they please us by their subtle methods, and get what they want from us.  To blame them for this is to perpetuate their power. We further  strengthen their hold by quarrelling amongst ourselves. If you accept  the above statements, it is proved that the English entered India for  the purposes of trade. They remain in it for the same purpose, and we  help them to do so. Their arms and ammunition are perfectly useless. In  this connection, I remind you that it is the British flag which is  waving in Japan, and not the Japanese. The English have a treaty with  Japan for the sake of their commerce and you will see that, if they can  manage it, their commerce will greatly expand in that country. They  wish to convert the whole word into a vast market for their goods. That  they cannot do so is true, but the blame will not be theirs. They will  leave no stone unturned to reach the goal.      SWARAJ MY IDEAL    The following is a fairly full report of Mr. Gandhi's important speech  at Calcutta on the 13th December 1920:--    The very fact, that so many of you cannot understand Hindi which is  bound to be the National medium of expression throughout Hindustan in  gatherings of Indians belonging to different parts of the land, shows  the depth of the degradation to which we have sunk, and points to the  supreme necessity of the non-co-operation movement which is intended to  lift us out of that condition. This Government has been instrumental in  degrading this great nation in various ways, and it is impossible to be  free from it without co-operation amongst ourselves which is in turn  impossible without a national medium of expression.    But I am not here to day to plead for the medium. I am to plead for the  acceptance by the country of the programme of non-violent, progressive  non-co-operation. Now all the words that I have used here are absolutely  necessary and the two adjectives 'progressive' and 'non-violent' are  integral part of a whole. With me non-violence is part of my religion, a  matter of creed. But with the great number of Mussalmans non-violence is  a policy, with thousand, if not millions of Hindus, it is equally a  matter of policy. But whether it is a creed or a policy, it is utterly  impossible for you to finish the programme for the enfranchisement of  the millions of India, without recognising the necessity and the value  of non-violence. Violence may for a moment avail to secure a certain  measure of success but it could not in the long run achieve any  appreciable result. On the other hand all violence would prove  destructive to the honour and self-respect of the nation. The blue books  issued by the Government of India show that inasmuch as we have used  violence, military expenditure has gone up, not proportionately but in  geometrical progression. The bonds of our slavery have been forged all  the stronger for our having offered violence. And the whole history of  British rule in India is a demonstration of the fact that we have never  been able to offer successful violence. Whilst therefore I say that  rather than have the yoke of a Government that has so emasculated us, I  would welcome violence. I would urge with all the emphasis that I can  command that India will never be able to regain her own by methods  of violence.    Lord Ronaldshay who has done me the honour of reading my booklet on Home  Rule has warned my countrymen against engaging themselves in a struggle  for a Swaraj such as is described in that booklet. Now though I do not  want to withdraw a single word of it, I would say to you on this  occasion that I do not ask India to follow out to-day the methods  prescribed in my booklet. If they could do that they would have Home  Rule not in a year but in a day, and India by realising that ideal wants  to acquire an ascendancy over the rest of the world. But it must remain  a day dream more or less for the time being. What I am doing to-day is  that I am giving the country a pardonable programme not the abolition of  law courts, posts, telegraphs and of railways but for the attainment of  Parliamentary Swarja. I am telling you to do that so long as we do not  isolate ourselves from this Government, we are co-operating with it  through schools, law courts and councils, through service civil and  military and payment of taxes and foreign trade.    The moment this fact is realised and non-co-operation is effected, this  Government must totter to pieces. If I know that the masses were  prepared for the whole programme at once, I would not delay in putting  it at once to work.

The sight of his weakness makes her strong. A mighty power thrills her  body. Stooping beneath his outstretched arms grasping at the air for  support, Tusee lifts him upon her broad shoulders. With half-running,  triumphant steps she carries him away into the open night.          A DREAM OF HER GRANDFATHER      Her grandfather was a Dakota \"medicine man.\" Among the Indians of his  day he was widely known for his successful healing work. He was one of  the leading men of the tribe and came to Washington, D.C., with one of  the first delegations relative to affairs concerning the Indian people  and the United States government.    His was the first band of the Great Sioux Nation to make treaties with  the government in the hope of bringing about an amicable arrangement  between the red and white Americans. The journey to the nation's capital  was made almost entirely on pony-back, there being no railroads, and the  Sioux delegation was beset with many hardships on the trail. His visit  to Washington, in behalf of peace among men, proved to be his last  earthly mission. From a sudden illness, he died and was buried here.    When his small granddaughter grew up she learned the white man's tongue,  and followed in the footsteps of her grandfather to the very seat of  government to carry on his humanitarian work. Though her days were  filled with problems for welfare work among her people, she had a  strange dream one night during her stay in Washington. The dream was  this: Returning from an afternoon out, she found a large cedar chest had  been delivered to her home in her absence. She sniffed the sweet perfume  of the red wood, which reminded her of the breath of the forest,--and  admired the box so neatly made, without trimmings. It looked so clean,  strong and durable in its native genuineness. With elation, she took the  tag in her hand and read her name aloud. \"Who sent me this cedar chest?\"  she asked, and was told it came from her grandfather.    Wondering what gift it could be her grandfather wished now to confer  upon her, wholly disregarding his death years ago, she was all eagerness  to open the mystery chest.    She remembered her childhood days and the stories she loved to hear  about the unusual powers of her grandfather,--recalled how she, the wee  girl, had coveted the medicine bags, beaded and embroidered in porcupine  quills, in symbols designed by the great \"medicine man,\" her  grandfather. Well did she remember her merited rebuke that such things  were never made for relics. Treasures came in due time to those ready to  receive them.    In great expectancy, she lifted the heavy lid of the cedar chest. \"Oh!\"  she exclaimed, with a note of disappointment, seeing no beaded Indian  regalia or trinkets. \"Why does my grandfather send such a light gift in  a heavy, large box?\" She was mystified and much perplexed.    The gift was a fantastic thing, of texture far more delicate than a  spider's filmy web. It was a vision! A picture of an Indian camp, not  painted on canvas nor yet written. It was dream-stuff, suspended in the  thin air, filling the inclosure of the cedar wood container. As she  looked upon it, the picture grew more and more real, exceeding the  proportions of the chest. It was all so illusive a breath might have  blown it away; yet there it was, real as life,--a circular camp of white  cone-shaped tepees, astir with Indian people. The village crier, with  flowing head-dress of eagle plumes, mounted on a prancing white pony,  rode within the arena. Indian men, women and children stopped in groups  and clusters, while bright painted faces peered out of tepee doors, to  listen to the chieftain's crier.    At this point, she, too, heard the full melodious voice. She heard  distinctly the Dakota words he proclaimed to the people. \"Be glad!  Rejoice! Look up, and see the new day dawning! Help is near! Hear me,  every one.\"    She caught the glad tidings and was thrilled with new hope for her  people.          THE WIDESPREAD ENIGMA CONCERNING BLUE-STAR WOMAN      It was summer on the western plains. Fields of golden sunflowers facing  eastward, greeted the rising sun. Blue-Star Woman, with windshorn braids  of white hair over each ear, sat in the shade of her log hut before an  open fire. Lonely but unmolested she dwelt here like the ground squirrel  that took its abode nearby,--both through the easy tolerance of the land  owner. The Indian woman held a skillet over the burning embers. A large  round cake, with long slashes in its center, was baking and crowding the  capacity of the frying pan.    In deep abstraction Blue-Star Woman prepared her morning meal. \"Who am  I?\" had become the obsessing riddle of her life. She was no longer a  young woman, being in her fifty-third year. In the eyes of the white  man's law, it was required of her to give proof of her membership in the  Sioux tribe. The unwritten law of heart prompted her naturally to say,  \"I am a being. I am Blue-Star Woman. A piece of earth is my birthright.\"    It was taught, for reasons now forgot, that an Indian should never  pronounce his or her name in answer to any inquiry. It was probably a  means of protection in the days of black magic. Be this as it may,  Blue-Star Woman lived in times when this teaching was disregarded. It  gained her nothing, however, to pronounce her name to the government  official to whom she applied for her share of tribal land. His  persistent question was always, \"Who were your parents?\"    Blue-Star Woman was left an orphan at a tender age. She did not remember  them. They were long gone to the spirit-land,-and she could not  understand why they should be recalled to earth on her account. It was  another one of the old, old teachings of her race that the names of the  dead should not be idly spoken. It had become a sacrilege to mention  carelessly the name of any departed one, especially in matters of  disputes over worldy possessions. The unfortunate circumstances of her  early childhood, together with the lack of written records of a roving  people, placed a formidable barrier between her and her heritage. The  fact was events of far greater importance to the tribe than her  reincarnation had passed unrecorded in books. The verbal reports of the  old-time men and women of the tribe were varied,--some were actually  contradictory. Blue-Star Woman was unable to find even a twig of her  family tree.    She sharpened one end of a long stick and with it speared the fried  bread when it was browned. Heedless of the hot bread's \"Tsing!\" in a  high treble as it was lifted from the fire, she added it to the six  others which had preceded it. It had been many a moon since she had had  a meal of fried bread, for she was too poor to buy at any one time all  the necessary ingredients, particularly the fat in which to fry it.  During the breadmaking, the smoke-blackened coffeepot boiled over. The  aroma of freshly made coffee smote her nostrils and roused her from the  tantalizing memories.    The day before, friendly spirits, the unseen ones, had guided her  aimless footsteps to her Indian neighbor's house. No sooner had she  entered than she saw on the table some grocery bundles. \"Iye-que,  fortunate one!\" she exclaimed as she took the straight-backed chair  offered her. At once the Indian hostess untied the bundles and measured  out a cupful of green coffee beans and a pound of lard. She gave them to  Blue-Star Woman, saying, \"I want to share my good fortune. Take these  home with you.\" Thus it was that Blue-Star Woman had come into  unexpected possession of the materials which now contributed richly to  her breakfast.    The generosity of her friend had often saved her from starvation.  Generosity is said to be a fault of Indian people, but neither the  Pilgrim Fathers nor Blue-Star Woman ever held it seriously against them.  Blue-Star Woman was even grateful for this gift of food. She was fond of  coffee,-that black drink brought hither by those daring voyagers of long  ago. The coffee habit was one of the signs of her progress in the white  man's civilization, also had she emerged from the tepee into a log hut,  another achievement. She had learned to read the primer and to write her  name. Little Blue-Star attended school unhindered by a fond mother's  fears that a foreign teacher might not spare the rod with her darling.    Blue-Star Woman was her individual name. For untold ages the Indian  race had not used family names. A new-born child was given a brand-new  name. Blue-Star Woman was proud to write her name for which she would  not be required to substitute another's upon her marriage, as is the  custom of civilized peoples.    \"The times are changed now,\" she muttered under her breath. \"My  individual name seems to mean nothing.\" Looking out into space, she saw  the nodding sunflowers, and they acquiesced with her. Their drying  leaves reminded her of the near approach of autumn. Then soon, very  soon, the ice would freeze along the banks of the muddy river. The day  of the first ice was her birthday. She would be fifty-four winters old.  How futile had been all these winters to secure her a share in tribal  lands. A weary smile flickered across her face as she sat there on the  ground like a bronze figure of patience and long-suffering.    The breadmaking was finished. The skillet was set aside to cool. She  poured the appetizing coffee into her tin cup. With fried bread and  black coffee she regaled herself. Again her mind reverted to her  riddle. \"The missionary preacher said he could not explain the white  man's law to me. He who reads daily from the Holy Bible, which he tells  me is God's book, cannot understand mere man's laws. This also puzzles  me,\" thought she to herself. \"Once a wise leader of our people,  addressing a president of this "]]]
