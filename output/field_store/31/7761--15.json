[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10479"],[0,"Our Churches and Chapels: Their Parsons, Priests, & Congregations (#15)"],[1," of Quakerdom seemed  more conventional than their ancestors in general dress. There was a  slight dash of antiquity in their style; but their hats and bonnets,  their coats and shawls had evidently been made for ornament as well  as use. Originally Quakers were peculiarly stringent in respect to  the plainness of their clothes; what they wore was always good,  always made out of something which could not be beaten for its  excellence of quality; but it was always simple, always out of the  line of shoddy and bespanglement. But Quakerism is neither  immaculate nor invincible; time is changing its simplicity, its  quaint old fashioned solidity of dress; \"civilisation\" is quietly  eating away its rigidity; and the day is coming when Quakerism will  don the same suit as the rest of the world. For the first ten  minutes we were in the chapel silence was not to us so much of a  singularity; but when the Town Hall clock struck seven, when the  machinery in the dim steeple of Trinity Church, which adjoins, gave  a slow confirmation of it, and when all the little clocks in the  neighbouring houses--for you could hear them on account of the  general silence--chirped out sharply the same thing, one began to  feel dubious and mystified. But the Quakers took all quietly, and  even the children present sat still. The chime of another hour  quarter came in due order; still there was no sign of action. Two  minutes afterwards, an elderly gentleman, whose eyes had been kept  close during the greater part of the time which had passed, suddenly  leaned forward; the \"congregation\" followed his example in a crack,  and for ten minutes they prayed, the elderly gentleman leading the  way in a rather high-keyed voice, which he singularly modulated. But  there was not much of \"the old Foxian orgasm\" manifested by him; he  was serene, did not shake, was not agonised. He finished as he began  without any warning; the general assemblage was seated in a second;  and for seven minutes there was another reign of taciturnity. When  that time had elapsed the same elderly party gave an exhortation,  simple in language, kindly in tone, and free from both bewilderment  and fierceness. Mr. Jesper--the person to whom we have been  alluding--is one of the principal speakers at this meeting house.  His colleague in talking is Mrs. Abbatt, a very worthy lady, who has  often the afflatus upon her, and who can hold forth with a good deal  of earnestness and perspicuity. Although Mr. Jesper and Mrs. Abbatt  do the greatest portion of the talking and praying, others break  through the ring fence of Quakerdom's silence periodically. One  little gentleman has often small outbursts; but he is not very  exhilerating. All the \"members\" attending the meeting house are very  decorous, respectable, middle-class people--substantial well-pursed  folk, who can afford to be independent, and take life easily--men  and women who dislike shoddy and cant as much as they condemn  spangles and lackered gentility.    The aggregate of the people connected with the place are calm,  steady-going beings. We have a large respect for Quakerism. Its  professors are made of strong, enduring, practical metal. They never  neglect business for religion, nor religion for business. They  believe in paying their way and in being paid; in moral rectitude  and yard wands not the millionth part of an inch too long; in yea  and nay; in good trade, good purses, good clothes, and good  language; in clear-headed, cool calculations; in cash, discounts,  sobriety, and clean shirts; in calmness and close bargain driving;  in getting as much as they can, in sticking to it a long while, and  yet in behaving well to the poor. The influence of the creed they  profess has made their uprightness and humanity proverbial. Their  home influence has been powerful; their views in the outer world are  becoming more fully realised every day. Nations have smiled  contemptuously at them as they have gone forth on lonely missions of  freedom and peace; but the inner beatings of the world's great heart  today are in favour of liberty of thought and quietness. The Quakers  have been amongst life's pioneers in the long, hard battle for human  freedom and human peace. Quakerism may be a quaint, hat-loving,  silence-revering concern in its meeting-houses; its Uriahs, and  Abimelechs, and Deborahs, and Abigails, may look curious creatures  in their collarless coats and long drawn bonnets; but they belong to  a race of men and women who have kept the lamp of freedom burning;  who have set a higher price upon conscience than gold; who have  struggled to make everything free--the body, the religion, the bread  and butter, and the trade of the nations; who are now by their  doctrines slowly lifting humanity out of the red track of war, and  teaching it how grand a triumph can be made all the world over by  absolute Peace and Honesty.        ST. PETER'S CHURCH.        Upon a high piece of enclosed land, adjoining Fylde-road, stands St.  Peter's Church. Portions of its precincts are covered with  gravestones; the remainder has been \"considerably damaged\" of late,  according to the belief of one of the churchwardens, by the vicious  scratching of a number of irreverent hens, whose owners will be  prosecuted if they do not look better after them. The other Sunday,  we saw a notice posted at the front of the church relative to the  great hen-scratching question. It is said that some of these tame  and reclaimed birds have penetrated a foot or two into the ground  for the purpose of lying, not laying, therein; and on this account  it is important that their proprietors should look more  (h)energetically after them. The foundation stone of St. Peter's  Church was laid by Mr. Justice Park, one of the old recorders of  Preston, in 1822; Rickman, an able Birmingham architect, designed  the place; and the edifice (sans steeple, which was built in 1852,  out of money left by the late Thomas German, Esq.), was erected at a  cost of 6,900 pounds, provided by the Commissioners for the building  of new churches. St. Peter's has a lofty, commanding appearance.  Learned people say it is built in the florid Gothic style of  architecture, and we are not inclined to dispute their definition.  It has a very churchly look, and if the steeple were at the other  end, it would be equally orthodox. The world, as a rule, fixes its  steeples westward; but St. Peter's, following a few others we could  name, rises in the opposite direction, and, like a good Mussulman,  turns to the East. There is nothing in its graveyard calling for  special comment. Neither monuments nor lofty tombs relieve it. All  round it has a flat dull aspect, and good arrangements have been  made for walking over the tombstones and obliterating their  inscriptions. There are two ways into the church at the western end;  both are near each other; but one has advantages which the other  does not possess. Passing through the larger you immediately face  the pulpit and the congregation; entering by the other you can hang  your harp on several preliminary willows--sit just sideways and hear  what's going on, stay behind the screen until a point arrives when a  move forward can be made without many people catching your \"mould of  form,\" or inquire who's present and who isn't, and glide out if  nothing suitable is observed.    St. Peter's Church, internally, looks dirty. If cleanliness be next  to godliness, a good cleaning would do it good and improve its  affinities. Whitewash, paint, floorcloths, dusters, wash leathers,  and sundry other articles in the curriculum of scrubbers,  renovators, and purifiers are needed. The walls want mundifying, so  does the ceiling, so do the floors; the Ten Commandments need  improving; the Apostles' Creed isn't plain enough; the spirit of a  time worn grimness requires ostracising from the place. All is  substantial; but there is an ancient unwashed dulness about the  general establishment, which needs transforming into cleanness and  brightness. The pews are high, and on the average they will hold six  persons each. Seven might get into them on a pinch; but if the  number were much extended beyond that point, either abraison or blue  places through violent pressure would be the consequence. Two or  three pews at the top end will hold twelve each; but that apostolic  number is not very often observed in them. The price of a single  sitting in the middle aisle is 10s. per annum; the cost of a side  seat is equal to three civil half-crowns. The long side seats are  free; so are the galleries, excepting that portion of them in front  of the organ. Often the church is not much more than half filled on  a Sunday; but it is said that many sittings, calculated to  accommodate nearly a full congregation, are let. Viewed from the  copperhead standpoint this is right; but taking a higher ground it  would be more satisfactory if even fewer pews were let and more folk  attended. The church is not well arranged for people occupying side  seats. In looking ahead the pillars of the nave constantly intercept  their vision if they care about seeing who is reading or preaching.  Wherever the pulpit were put it would blush unseen, so far as many  are concerned. At present it is fixed on the south-eastern side, and  only about one-fourth of those seated under the galleries can see  either it or the preacher. Some of them at times complain  considerably of sequestration; others feel it a little occasionally;  a few think it a rather snug thing to be out of sight. A large five-  light stained glass window occupies the chancel end; but there is  nothing very entrancing in its appearance. The greater portion of it  has a bright, amber-coloured, monotonous flashiness about it, which  flares the eyes if gazed at long, and makes other things, if looked  at directly afterwards, yellow-hued; and it is surmounted with a  number of minor designs, reminding one of the big"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10484"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 03: Ancient Achievements (#15)"],[1,"they were, but as they appeared to  be; and if he exaggerated, he displayed great energy of action. He aimed  to idealize merely human beauty, and his imitation of Nature was carried  out in the minutest details. None of his works are extant; but as he  alone was permitted to make the statue of Alexander, we infer that he  had no equals. The Emperor Tiberius transferred one of his statues (that  of an athlete) from the baths of Agrippa to his own chamber, which so  incensed the people that he was obliged to restore it. His favorite  subject was Hercules, and a colossal statue of this god was carried to  Rome by Fabius Maximus, when he took Tarentum, and afterward was  transferred to Constantinople; the Farnese Hercules and the Belvidere  Torso are probably copies of this work. He left many eminent scholars,  among whom were Chares (who executed the famous Colossus of Rhodes),  Agesander, Polydorus, and Athenodorus who sculptured the group of the  \"Laocooen.\" The Rhodian school was the immediate offshoot from the school  of Lysippus at Sicyon; and from this small island of Rhodes the Romans,  when they conquered it, carried away three thousand statues. The  Colossus was one of the wonders of the world (seventy cubits in height);  and the Laocooen (the group of the Trojan hero and his two sons encoiled  by serpents) is a perfect miracle of art, in which pathos is exhibited  in the highest degree ever attained in sculpture. It was discovered in  1506, near the baths of Titus, and is one of the choicest remains of  ancient plastic art.    The great artists of antiquity did not confine themselves to the  representation of man, but also carved animals with exceeding accuracy  and beauty. Nicias was famous for his dogs, Myron for his cows, and  Lysippus for his horses. Praxiteles composed his celebrated lion after a  living animal. \"The horses of the frieze of the Elgin Marbles,\" says  Flaxman, \"appear to live and move; to roll their eyes, to gallop,  prance, and curvet; the veins of their faces and legs seem distended  with circulation. The beholder is charmed with the deer-like lightness  and elegance of their make; and although the relief is not above an inch  from the background, and they are so much smaller than nature, we can  scarcely suffer reason to persuade us they are not alive.\" The Greeks  also carved gems, cameos, medals, and vases, with unapproachable  excellence. Very few specimens have come down to our times, but those  which we possess show great beauty both in design and execution.    Grecian statuary began with ideal representations of the deities, and  was carried to the greatest perfection by Phidias in his statues of  Jupiter and Minerva. Then succeeded the school of Praxiteles, in which  the figures of gods and goddesses were still represented, but in mortal  forms. The school of Lysippus was famous for the statues of celebrated  men, especially in cities where Macedonian rulers resided. Artists were  expected henceforth to glorify kings and powerful nobles and rulers by  portrait statues. From this period, however, plastic art degenerated;  nor were works of original genius produced, but rather copies or  varieties from the three great schools to which allusion has been made.  Sculpture may have multiplied, but not new creations; although some  imitations of great merit were produced, like the Hermaphrodite, the  Torso, the Farnese Hercules, and the Fighting Gladiator. When Corinth  was sacked by Mummius, some of the finest statues of Greece were carried  to Rome; and after the civil war between Caesar and Pompey, the Greek  artists emigrated to Italy. The fall of Syracuse introduced many works  of priceless value into Rome; but it was from Athens, Delphi, Corinth,  Elis, and other great centres of art that the richest treasures were  brought. Greece was despoiled to ornament Italy.    The Romans did not create a school of sculpture. They borrowed wholly  from the Greeks, yet made, especially in the time of Hadrian, many  beautiful statues. They were fond of this art, and all eminent men had  statues erected to their memory. The busts of emperors were found in  every great city, and Rome was filled with statues. The monuments of the  Romans were even more numerous than those of the Greeks, and among them  some admirable portraits are found. These sculptures did not express  that consummation of beauty and grace, of refinement and sentiment,  which marked the Greeks; but the imitations were good. Art had reached  its perfection under Lysippus; there was nothing more to learn. Genius  in that department could soar no higher. It will never rise to  loftier heights.    It is noteworthy that the purest forms of Grecian art arose in its  earlier stages. From a moral point of view, sculpture declined from the  time of Phidias. It was prostituted at Rome under the emperors. The  specimens which have often been found among the ruins of ancient baths  make us blush for human nature. The skill of execution did not decline  for several centuries; but the lofty ideal was lost sight of, and gross  appeals to human passions were made by those who sought to please  corrupt leaders of society in an effeminate age. The turgidity and  luxuriance of art gradually passed into tameness and poverty. The  reliefs on the Arch of Constantine are rude and clumsy compared with  those on the column of Marcus Aurelius.    It is not my purpose to describe the decline of art, or enumerate the  names of the celebrated masters who exalted sculpture in the palmy days  of Pericles or even Alexander. I simply speak of sculpture as an art  which reached a great perfection among the Greeks and Romans, as we have  a right to infer from the specimens that have been preserved. How many  more must have perished, we may infer from the criticisms of the ancient  authors. The finest productions of our own age are in a measure  reproductions; they cannot be called creations, like the statue of the  Olympian Jove. Even the Moses of Michael Angelo is a Grecian god, and  Powers's Greek Slave is a copy of an ancient Venus. The very tints which  have been admired in some of the works of modern sculptors are borrowed  from Praxiteles, who succeeded in giving to his statues an appearance of  living flesh. The Museum of the Vatican alone contains several thousand  specimens of ancient sculpture which have been found among the debris of  former magnificence, many of which are the productions of Greek artists  transported to Rome. Among them are antique copies of the Cupid and the  Faun of Praxiteles, the statue of Demosthenes, the Minerva Medica, the  Athlete of Lysippus, the Torso Belvedere sculptured by Apollonius, the  Belvidere Antinous, of faultless anatomy and a study for Domenichino,  the Laocooen, so panegyrized by Pliny, the Apollo Belvedere, the work of  Agasias of Ephesus, the Sleeping Ariadne, with numerous other statues of  gods and goddesses, emperors, philosophers, poets, and statesmen of  antiquity. The Dying Gladiator, which ornaments the capitol, is alone a  magnificent proof of the perfection to which sculpture was carried  centuries after the art had culminated at Athens. And these are only a  few which stand out among the twenty thousand recovered statues that now  embellish Italy, to say nothing of those that are scattered over Europe.  We have the names of hundreds of artists who were famous in their day.  Not merely the figures of men are chiselled, but of animals and plants.  Nature in all her forms was imitated; and not merely Nature, but the  dresses of the ancients are perpetuated in marble. No modern sculptor  has equalled, in delicacy of finish, the draperies of those ancient  statues as they appear to us even after the exposure and accidents of  two thousand years. No one, after a careful study of the museums of  Europe, can question that of all the nations who have claimed to be  civilized, the ancient Greeks and Romans deserve a proud pre-eminence in  an art which is still regarded as among the highest triumphs of human  genius. All these matchless productions of antiquity are the result of  native genius alone, without the aid of Christian ideas. Nor with the  aid of Christianity are we sure that any nation will ever soar to  loftier heights than did the Greeks in that proud realm which was  consecrated to Paganism.    We are not so certain in regard to the excellence of the ancients in the  art of painting as we are in regard to sculpture and architecture, since  so few specimens of painting have been preserved. We have only the  testimony of the ancients themselves; and as they had so severe a taste  and so great a susceptibility to beauty in all its forms, we cannot  suppose that their notions were crude in this great art which the  moderns have carried to such great perfection. In this art the moderns  doubtless excel, especially in perspective and drawing, and light and  shade. No age, we fancy, can surpass Italy in the fifteenth and  sixteenth centuries, when the genius of Raphael, Correggio, and  Domenichino blazed with such wonderful brilliancy.    Painting in some form, however, is very ancient, though not so ancient  as are the temples of the gods and the statues that were erected to  their worship. It arose with the susceptibility to beauty of form and  color, and with the view of conveying thoughts and emotions of the soul  by imitation of their outward expression. The walls of Babylon were  painted after Nature with representations of different species of  animals and of combats between them and man. Semiramis was represented  as on horseback, striking a leopard with a dart, and her husband Ninus  as wounding a lion. Ezekiel describes various idols and beasts portrayed  upon the walls, and even princes painted in vermilion, with girdles  around their loins. In ages almost fabulous there were some rude  attempts in this art, which probably arose from the coloring of statues  and reliefs. The wooden "]]]
