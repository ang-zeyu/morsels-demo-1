In the \"History of the Ti-Ping Revolution\" (published in London in 1866),  written by an Englishman who held a command among the Ti-Piugs, there is  given a full, interesting, and apparently candid account of the religious  and moral character of this great movement, from which I take the  following particulars:--    \"I have probably,\" says this writer,[24] \"had a much greater experience  of the Ti-Ping religious practices than any other European, and as a  Protestant Christian I have never yet found occasion to condemn their form  of worship. The most important part of their faith is the Holy Bible,--Old  and New Testaments, entire. These have been printed and circulated  gratuitously by the government through the whole population of the Ti-Ping  jurisdiction.\" Abstracts of the Bible, put into verse, were circulated and  committed to memory. Their form of worship was assimilated to  Protestantism. The Sabbath was kept religiously on the seventh day. Three  cups of tea were put on the altar on that day as an offering to the  Trinity. They celebrated the communion once a month by partaking of a cup  of grape wine. Every one admitted to their fellowship was baptized, after  an examination and confession of sins. The following was the form  prescribed in the \"Book of Religious Precepts of the Ti-Ping  Dynasty\":--[25]    _Forms to be observed when Men wish to forsake their Sins_--\"They must  kneel down in God's presence, and ask him to forgive their sins. They may  then take either a basin of water and wash themselves, or go to the river  and bathe themselves; after which they must continue daily to supplicate  Divine favor, and the Holy Spirit's assistance to renew their hearts,  saying grace at every meal, keeping holy the Sabbath day, and obeying all  God's commandments, especially avoiding idolatry. They may then be  accounted the children of God, and their souls will go to Heaven when they  die.\"    The prayer offered by the recipient of Baptism was as follows:--    \"I (A. B.), kneeling down with a true heart, repent of my sins, and pray  the Heavenly Father, the great God, of his abundant mercy, to forgive my  former sins of ignorance in repeatedly breaking the Divine commands,  earnestly beseeching him also to grant me repentance and newness of life,  that my soul may go to Heaven, while I henceforth truly forsake my former  ways, abandoning idolatry and all corrupt practices, in obedience to  God's commands. I also pray that God would give me his Holy Spirit to  change my wicked heart, deliver me from all temptation, and grant me his  favor and protection, bestowing on me food and raiment, and exemption from  calamity, peace in this world and glory in the next, through the mercies  of our Saviour and Elder Brother, Jesus, who redeemed us from sin.\"    In every household throughout the Ti-Ping territory the following  translation of the Lord's Prayer was hung up for the use of the children,  printed in large black characters on a white board:--    \"Supreme Lord, our Heavenly Father, forgive all our sins that we have  committed in ignorance, rebelling against thee. Bless us, brethren and  sisters, thy little children. Give us our daily food and raiment; keep  from us all calamities and afflictions; that in this world we may have  peace and finally ascend to heaven to enjoy everlasting happiness. We pray  thee to bless our brethren and sisters of all nations. We ask these things  for the redeeming merits of our Lord and Saviour, our heavenly brother,  Jesus. We also pray, Heavenly Father, that thy will may be done on earth  as in heaven: for thine are all the kingdoms, glory, and power. Amen.\"    The writer says he has frequently watched the Ti-Ping women teaching the  children this prayer; \"and often, on entering a house, the children ran up  to me, and pulling me toward the board, began to read the prayer.\"    The seventh day was kept very strictly. As soon as midnight sounded on  Friday, all the people throughout; Ti-Pingdom were summoned to worship.  Two other services were held during the day. Each opened with a doxology  to God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Then was sung this hymn:--        \"The true doctrine is different from the doctrine of this world;      It saves men's souls and gives eternal bliss.      The wise receive it instantly with joy;      The foolish, wakened by it, find the way to Heaven.      Our Heavenly Father, of his great mercy,      Did not spare his own Son, but sent him down      To give his life to redeem sinners.      When men know this, and repent, they may go to Heaven.\"    The rest of the services consisted in a chapter of the Bible read by the  minister; a creed, repeated by the congregation standing; a prayer, read  by the minister and repeated by the whole congregation kneeling. Then the  prayer was burned, the minister read a sermon, an anthem was chanted to  the long life of the king; then followed the Ten Commandments, music, and  the burning of incense and fire-crackers. No business was allowed on the  Sabbath, and the shops were closed. There was a clergy, chosen by  competitive examination, subject to the approval of the Tien-Wong, or  supreme religious head of the movement. There was a minister placed over  every twenty-five families, and a church, or Heavenly Hall, assigned to  him in some public building. Over every twenty, five parishes there was a  superior, who visited them in turn every Sabbath. Once every month the  whole people were addressed by the chief Wong.    The writer of this work describes his attendance on morning prayers at  Nan-king, in the Heavenly Hall of the Chung-Wang's household. This took  place at sunrise every morning, the men and women sitting on opposite  sides of the hall. \"Oftentimes,\" says he, \"while kneeling in the midst of  an apparently devout congregation, and gazing on the upturned countenances  lightened by the early morning sun, have I wondered why no British  missionary occupied my place, and why Europeans generally preferred  slaughtering the Ti-Pings to accepting them as brothers in Christ. When I  look back,\" he adds, \"on the unchangeable and universal kindness I always  met with among the Ti-Pings, even when their dearest relatives were being  slaughtered by my countrymen, or delivered over to the Manchoos to be  tortured to death, their magnanimous forbearance seems like a dream. Their  kind and friendly feelings were often annoying. To those who have  experienced the ordinary dislike of foreigners by the Chinese, the  surprising friendliness of the Ti-Pings was most remarkable.\" They  welcomed Europeans as \"brethren from across the sea,\" and claimed them as  fellow-worshippers of \"Yesu.\"    Though the Ti-Pings did not at once lay aside all heathen customs, and  could not be expected to do so, they took some remarkable steps in the  right direction. Their women were in a much higher position than among the  other Chinese; they abolished the custom of cramping their feet; a married  woman had rights, and could not be divorced at will, or sold, as under the  Manchoos. Large institutions were established for unmarried women. Slavery  was totally abolished, and to sell a human being was made a capital  offence. They utterly prohibited the use of opium; and this was probably  their chief offence in the eyes of the English. Prostitution was punished  by death, and was unknown in their cities. Idolatry was also utterly  abolished. Their treatment of the people under them was merciful; they  protected their prisoners, whom the Imperialists always massacred. The  British troops, instead of preserving neutrality, aided the Imperialists  in putting down the insurrection in such ways as this. The British  cruisers _assumed_ that the Ti-Ping junks were pirates, because they  captured Chinese vessels. The British ship Bittern and another steamer  sank every vessel but two in a rebel fleet, and gave up the crew of one  which they captured to be put to death. This is the description of another  transaction of the same kind, in the harbor of Shi-poo: \"The junks were  destroyed, and their crews shot, drowned, and hunted down, until about a  thousand were killed; the Bittern's men aiding the Chinese on shore to  complete the wholesale massacre.\"[26]    It is the deliberate opinion of this well-informed English writer that the  Ti-Ping insurrection would have succeeded but for British intervention;  that the Tartar dynasty would have been expelled, the Chinese regained  their autonomy, and Christianity have been established throughout the  Empire. At the end of his book he gives a table of _forty-three_ battles  and massacres in which the British soldiers and navy took part, in which  about four hundred thousand of the Ti-Pings were killed, and he estimates  that more than two millions more died of starvation in 1863 and 1864, in  the famine occasioned by the operations of the allied English, French, and  Chinese troop's, when the Ti-Pings were driven from their territories. In  view of such facts, well may an English writer say: \"It is not once or  twice that the policy of the British government has been ruinous to the  best interests of the world. Disregard of international law and of treaty  law in Europe, deeds of piracy and spoliation in Asia, one vast system of  wrong and violence, have everywhere for years marked the dealings of the  British government with the weaker races of the globe.\"[27]    Other Englishmen, beside \"Lin-Le\" and Mr. Meadows, give the same testimony  to the Christian character of this great movement in China. Captain  Fishbourne, describing his visit in H.M.S. Hermes to Nan-king, says: \"It  was obvious to the commonest observer that they were practically a  different race.\" They had the Scriptures, many seemed to him to be  practical Christians, serious and religious, believing in a special  Providence, thinking that their trials were sent to purify them. \"They  accuse us of magic,\" said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1468"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 1 (#15)"],[1,"which had not been previously approved by the English Privy Council.  The authority of the English legislature extended over Ireland. The  executive administration was entrusted to men taken either from England  or from the English pale, and, in either case, regarded as foreigners,  and even as enemies, by the Celtic population.    But the circumstance which, more than any other, has made Ireland to  differ from Scotland remains to be noticed. Scotland was Protestant. In  no part of Europe had the movement of the popular mind against the Roman  Catholic Church been so rapid and violent. The Reformers had vanquished,  deposed, and imprisoned their idolatrous sovereign. They would not  endure even such a compromise as had been effected in England. They had  established the Calvinistic doctrine, discipline, and worship; and they  made little distinction between Popery and Prelacy, between the Mass and  the Book of Common Prayer. Unfortunately for Scotland, the prince whom  she sent to govern a fairer inheritance had been so much annoyed by  the pertinacity with which her theologians had asserted against him the  privileges of the synod and the pulpit that he hated the ecclesiastical  polity to which she was fondly attached as much as it was in his  effeminate nature to hate anything, and had no sooner mounted the  English throne than he began to show an intolerant zeal for the  government and ritual of the English Church.    The Irish were the only people of northern Europe who had remained true  to the old religion. This is to be partly ascribed to the circumstance  that they were some centuries behind their neighbours in knowledge. But  other causes had cooperated. The Reformation had been a national as well  as a moral revolt. It had been, not only an insurrection of the laity  against the clergy, but also an insurrection of all the branches of the  great German race against an alien domination. It is a most significant  circumstance that no large society of which the tongue is not Teutonic  has ever turned Protestant, and that, wherever a language derived from  that of ancient Rome is spoken, the religion of modern Rome to this day  prevails. The patriotism of the Irish had taken a peculiar direction.  The object of their animosity was not Rome, but England; and they had  especial reason to abhor those English sovereigns who had been the  chiefs of the great schism, Henry the Eighth and Elizabeth. During  the vain struggle which two generations of Milesian princes maintained  against the Tudors, religious enthusiasm and national enthusiasm became  inseparably blended in the minds of the vanquished race. The new feud  of Protestant and Papist inflamed the old feud of Saxon and Celt.  The English conquerors meanwhile, neglected all legitimate means of  conversion. No care was taken to provide the vanquished nation with  instructors capable of making themselves understood. No translation of  the Bible was put forth in the Irish language. The government contented  itself with setting up a vast hierarchy of Protestant archbishops,  bishops, and rectors, who did nothing, and who, for doing nothing, were  paid out of the spoils of a Church loved and revered by the great body  of the people.    There was much in the state both of Scotland and of Ireland which might  well excite the painful apprehensions of a farsighted statesman. As yet,  however, there was the appearance of tranquillity. For the first time  all the British isles were peaceably united under one sceptre.    It should seem that the weight of England among European nations ought,  from this epoch, to have greatly increased. The territory which her new  King governed was, in extent, nearly double that which Elizabeth had  inherited. His empire was the most complete within itself and the most  secure from attack that was to be found in the world. The Plantagenets  and Tudors had been repeatedly under the necessity of defending  themselves against Scotland while they were engaged in continental war.  The long conflict in Ireland had been a severe and perpetual drain on  their resources. Yet even under such disadvantages those sovereigns had  been highly considered throughout Christendom. It might, therefore, not  unreasonably be expected that England, Scotland, and Ireland combined  would form a state second to none that then existed.    All such expectations were strangely disappointed. On the day of the  accession of James the First, England descended from the rank which she  had hitherto held, and began to be regarded as a power hardly of the  second order. During many years the great British monarchy, under four  successive princes of the House of Stuart, was scarcely a more important  member of the European system than the little kingdom of Scotland had  previously been. This, however, is little to be regretted. Of James the  First, as of John, it may be said that, if his administration had been  able and splendid, it would probably have been fatal to our country,  and that we owe more to his weakness and meanness than to the wisdom and  courage of much better sovereigns. He came to the throne at a critical  moment. The time was fast approaching when either the King must  become absolute, or the parliament must control the whole executive  administration. Had James been, like Henry the Fourth, like Maurice of  Nassau, or like Gustavus Adolphus, a valiant, active, and politic ruler,  had he put himself at the head of the Protestants of Europe, had  he gained great victories over Tilly and Spinola, had he adorned  Westminster with the spoils of Bavarian monasteries and Flemish  cathedrals, had he hung Austrian and Castilian banners in Saint Paul's,  and had he found himself, after great achievements, at the head of fifty  thousand troops, brave, well disciplined, and devotedly attached to his  person, the English Parliament would soon have been nothing more than  a name. Happily he was not a man to play such a part. He began his  administration by putting an end to the war which had raged during  many years between England and Spain; and from that time he shunned  hostilities with a caution which was proof against the insults of his  neighbours and the clamours of his subjects. Not till the last year of  his life could the influence of his son, his favourite, his Parliament,  and his people combined, induce him to strike one feeble blow in  defence of his family and of his religion. It was well for those whom he  governed that he in this matter disregarded their wishes. The effect of  his pacific policy was that, in his time, no regular troops were needed,  and that, while France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Germany swarmed with  mercenary soldiers, the defence of our island was still confided to the  militia.    As the King had no standing army, and did not even attempt to form one,  it would have been wise in him to avoid any conflict with his people.  But such was his indiscretion that, while he altogether neglected the  means which alone could make him really absolute, he constantly put  forward, in the most offensive form, claims of which none of his  predecessors had ever dreamed. It was at this time that those strange  theories which Filmer afterwards formed into a system and which became  the badge of the most violent class of Tories and high churchmen, first  emerged into notice. It was gravely maintained that the Supreme Being  regarded hereditary monarchy, as opposed to other forms of government,  with peculiar favour; that the rule of succession in order of  primogeniture was a divine institution, anterior to the Christian, and  even to the Mosaic dispensation; that no human power, not even that  of the whole legislature, no length of adverse possession, though it  extended to ten centuries, could deprive a legitimate prince of his  rights, that the authority of such a prince was necessarily always  despotic; that the laws, by which, in England and in other countries,  the prerogative was limited, were to be regarded merely as concessions  which the sovereign had freely made and might at his pleasure resume;  and that any treaty which a king might conclude with his people was  merely a declaration of his present intentions, and not a contract of  which the performance could be demanded. It is evident that this theory,  though intended to strengthen the foundations of government, altogether  unsettles them. Does the divine and immutable law of primogeniture admit  females, or exclude them? On either supposition half the sovereigns of  Europe must be usurpers, reigning in defiance of the law of God, and  liable to be dispossessed by the rightful heirs. The doctrine that  kingly government is peculiarly favoured by Heaven receives no  countenance from the Old Testament; for in the Old Testament we read  that the chosen people were blamed and punished for desiring a king, and  that they were afterwards commanded to withdraw their allegiance  from him. Their whole history, far from countenancing the notion that  succession in order of primogeniture is of divine institution, would  rather seem to indicate that younger brothers are under the especial  protection of heaven. Isaac was not the eldest son of Abraham, nor Jacob  of Isaac, nor Judah of Jacob, nor David of Jesse nor Solomon of David  Nor does the system of Filmer receive any countenance from those  passages of the New Testament which describe government as an ordinance  of God: for the government under which the writers of the New Testament  lived was not a hereditary monarchy. The Roman Emperors were republican  magistrates, named by the senate. None of them pretended to rule by  right of birth; and, in fact, both Tiberius, to whom Christ commanded  that tribute should be given, and Nero, whom Paul directed the Romans to  obey, were, according to the patriarchal theory of government, usurpers.  In the middle ages the doctrine of indefeasible hereditary right would  have been"]]]
