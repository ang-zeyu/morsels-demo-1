Bonnivet, during his investment of Milan, had posted Bayard with a small  corps in the village of Rebec.  \"The good knight, who was never wont to  murmur at any commission given him, said, 'Sir Admiral, you would send me  to a village hard by the enemy, the which is without any fortress, and  would need four times so many men as I have, for to be in safety and to  hold it.'  'Sir Bayard,' said the admiral, 'go in peace; on my faith I  promise you that within three days I will send you plenty of men with you  for to hold Rebec, since I well know that it is not to be held with so  few men; but never you mind; there shall not a mouse get out of Milan  without you have notice of it.'  And so much did he say of one sort and  another that the good knight, with great disgust, went away with the men  told off to him to his post in Rebec.  He wrote many times to the admiral  that he was in very dangerous plight, and that, if he would have them  hold out long, he should send him aid; but he got no answer.  The enemies  who were inside Milan were warned that the good knight was in Rebec with  very little company; so they decided on a night to go and surprise and  defeat him.  And the good knight, who was ever on his guard, set nearly  every night half his men to watch and to listen, and himself passed two  or three nights at it, in such sort that he fell ill, as much from  melancholy as from cold, and far more than he let it appear; howbeit he  was forced to keep his room that day.  When it came on towards night, he  ordered some captains who were with him to go on the watch.  They went,  or made show of going; but, because it rained a little, back went all  those who were on the watch, save three or four poor archers, the which,  when the Spaniards approached within bow-shot of the village, made no  resistance, but took to flight, shouting, 'Alarm alarm!'  The good  knight, who in such jeopardy never slept but with his clothes on, rose at  once, had the bridle put on a charger that was already saddled, and went  off with five or six men-at-arms of his, straight to the barrier whither  incontinently came up Captain Lorges and a certain number of his foot,  who bore themselves mighty well.  The uproar was great and the alarm was  hot.  Then said the good knight to Captain Lorges, 'Lorges, my friend,  this is an unequal sort of game; if they pass this barrier we are cooked.  I pray you, retire your men, keep the best order you can, and march  straight to the camp at Abbiate-Grasso; I, with the horse I have, will  remain in the rear.  We must leave our baggage to the enemy; there is no  help for it.  Save we the lives if possible.' .  .  .  The enemy sought  on all sides for the good knight, but he had already arrived at  Abbiate-Grasso, where he had some unpleasant words with the admiral;  howbeit, I will not make any mention of them; but if they had both lived  longer than they did live, they would probably have gone a little  farther.  The good knight was like to die of grief at the mishap that  had befallen him, even though it was not his fault; but in war there is  hap and mishap more than in all other things.\"  [_Histoire du bon  Chevalier sans Peur et sans Reproche,_ t. ii.  pp. 120-123. _Les Gestes  et la Vie du Chevalier Bayard,_ by Champier, pp. 171-174.]    The situation of the French army before Milan was now becoming more and  more, not insecure only, but critical.  Bonnivet considered it his duty  to abandon it and fall back towards Piedmont, where he reckoned upon  finding a corps of five thousand Swiss who were coming to support their  compatriots engaged in the service of France.  Near Romagnano, on the  banks of the Sesia, the retreat was hotly pressed by the imperial army,  the command of which had been ultimately given by Charles V. to the  Constable de Bourbon, with whom were associated the Viceroy of Naples,  Charles de Lannoy, and Ferdinand d'Avalos, Marquis of Pescara, the most  able amongst the Neapolitan officers.  On the 30th of April, 1524, some  disorder took place in the retreat of the French; and Bonnivet, being  severely wounded, had to give up the command to the Count of St. Pol and  to Chevalier Bayard.  Bayard, last as well as first in the fight,  according to his custom, charged at the head of some men-at-arms upon the  Imperialists, who were pressing the French too closely, when he was  himself struck by a shot from an arquebuse, which shattered his reins.  \"Jesus, my God,\" he cried, \"I am dead!\"  He then took his sword by the  handle, and kissed the cross-hilt of it as the sign of the cross, saying  aloud as he did so, \"Have pity on me, O God, according to Thy great  mercy\" (Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam misericordiam tuam);  thereupon he became incontinently quite pale, and all but fell; but he  still had heart enough to grasp the pommel of the saddle, and remained in  that condition until a young gentleman, his own house-steward, helped him  to dismount and set him down under a tree, with his face to the enemy.  The poor gentleman burst into tears, seeing his good master so mortally  hurt that remedy there was none; but the good knight consoled him gently,  saying, \"Jacques, my friend, leave off thy mourning; it is God's will to  take me out of this world; by His grace I have lived long therein, and  have received therein blessings and honors more than my due.  All the  regret I feel at dying is that I have not done my duty so well as I  ought.  I pray you, Jacques, my friend, let them not take me up from this  spot, for, when I move, I feel all the pains that one can feel, short of  death, which will seize me soon.\"  The Constable de Bourbon, being  informed of his wound, came to him, saying, \"Bayard, my friend, I am sore  distressed at your mishap; there is nothing for it but patience; give not  way to melancholy; I will send in quest of the best surgeons in this  country, and, by God's help, you will soon be healed.\"  \"My lord,\"  answered Bayard, \"there is no pity for me; I die having done my duty; but  I have pity for you, to see you serving against your king, your country,  and your oath.\"  Bourbon withdrew without a word.  The Marquis of Pescara  came passing by.  \"Would to God, gentle Sir Bayard,\" said he, \"that it  had cost me a quart of my blood, without meeting my death, that I had  been doomed not to taste meat for two years, and that I held you safe and  sound my prisoner, for by the treatment I showed you, you should have  understanding of how much I esteemed the high prowess that was in you.\"  He ordered his people to rig up a tent over Bayard, and to forbid any  noise near him, so that he might die in peace.  Bayard's own gentlemen  would not, at any price, leave him.  \"I do beseech you,\" he said to them,  \"to get you gone; else you might fall into the enemy's hands, and that  would profit me nothing, for all is over with me.  To God I commend ye,  my good friends; and I recommend to you my poor soul; and salute, I pray  you, the king our master, and tell him that I am distressed at being no  longer able to do him service, for I had good will thereto.  And to my  lords the princes of France, and all my lords my comrades, and generally  to all gentlemen of the most honored realm of France when ye see them.\"    [Illustration: The Death of Bayard----76]    \"He lived for two or three hours yet.  There was brought to him a priest,  to whom he confessed, and then he yielded up his soul to God; whereat all  the enemy had mourning incredible.  Five days after his death, on the 5th  of May, 1524, Beaurain wrote to Charles V., 'Sir, albeit Sir Bayard was  your enemy's servant, yet was it pity of his death, for 'twas a gentle  knight, well beloved of every one, and one that lived as good a life as  ever any man of his condition.  And in truth he fully showed it by his  end, for it was the most beautiful that I ever heard tell of.'  By the  chiefs of the Spanish army certain gentlemen were commissioned to bear  him to the church, where solemn service was done for him during two days.  Then, by his own servitors was he carried into Dauphiny, and, on passing  through the territory of the Duke of Savoy, where the body was rested, he  did it as many honors as if it had been his own brother's.  When the news  of his death was known in Dauphiny, I trow that never for a thousand  years died there gentleman of the country mourned in such sort.  He was  borne from church to church, at first near Grenoble, where all my lords  of the parliament court of Dauphiny, my lords of the Exchequer, pretty  well all the nobles of the country and the greater part of all the  burgesses, townsfolk, and villagers came half a league to meet the body:  then into the church of Notre-Dame, in the aforesaid Grenoble, where a  solemn service was done for him; then to a house of _Minimes,_ which had  been founded aforetime by his good uncle the bishop of Grenoble, Laurens  Alment; and there he was honorably interred.  Then every one withdrew to  his own house; but for a month there was a stop put to festivals dances,  banquets, and all other pastimes.  'Las! they had good reason; for  greater loss could not have come upon the country.\"  [_Histoire du bon  Chevalier sans Peur et sans Reproche,_ t. ii.  pp. 125-132.]    It is a duty and an honor for history to give to such lives and such  deaths, as remarkable for modesty as for manly worth, the full place  which they ought to occupy in the memory of mankind.    The French army continued its retreat under the orders of the Count of  St. Pol, and re-entered France by way of Suza and Briancon.  It was  Francis I.'s third time of losing Milaness.

Philip V. had never admitted that his renunciation of the crown of France  was seriously binding upon him; he had seen, by the precedent of the war  of devolution, how a powerful sovereign may make sport of such acts; his  Italian minister, Alberoni, an able and crafty man, who had set the crown  of Spain upon the head of Elizabeth Farnese, and had continued to rule  her, cautiously egged on his master into hostilities against France.  They counted upon the Parliaments, taking example from that of Paris, on  the whole of Brittany, in revolt at the prolongation of the tithe-tax, on  all the old court, accustomed to the yoke of the bastards and of Madame  de Maintenon, on Languedoc, of which the Duke of Maine was the governor;  they talked of carrying off the Duke of Orleans, and taking him to the  castle of Toledo; Alberoni promised the assistance of a Spanish army.  The Duchess of Maine had fired the train, without the knowledge, she  said, and probably against the will, too, of her husband, more indolent  than she in his perfidy.  Some scatter-brains of great houses were mixed  up in the affair; MM. de Richelieu, de Laval, and de Pompadour; there was  secret coming and going between the castle of Sceaux and the house of the  Spanish ambassador, the Prince of Cellamare; M. de Malezieux, the  secretary and friend of the duchess, drew up a form of appeal from the  French nobility to Philip V., but nobody had signed it, or thought of  doing so.  They got pamphlets written by Abbe Brigault, whom the duchess  had sent to Spain; the mystery was profound, and all the conspirators  were convinced of the importance of their manoeuvres; every day, however,  the Regent was informed of them by his most influential negotiator with  foreign countries, Abbe Dubois, his late tutor, and the most depraved of  all those who were about him.  Able and vigilant as he was, he was not  ignorant of any single detail of the plot, and was only giving the  conspirators time to compromise themselves.  At last, just as a young  abbe, Porto Carrero, was starting for Spain, carrying important papers,  he was arrested at Poitiers, and his papers were seized.  Next day,  December 7, 1718, the Prince of Cellamare's house was visited, and the  streets were lined with troops.  Word was brought in all haste to the  Duchess of Maine.  She had company, and dared not stir.  M. de Chatillon  came in; joking commenced.  \"He was a cold creature, who never thought of  talking,\" says Madame de Stael in her memoirs.  \"All at once he said,  'Really there is some very amusing news: they have arrested and put in  the Bastille, for this affair of the Spanish ambassador, a certain Abbe  Bri .  .  .  .  Bri' he could not remember the name, and those who knew  it had no inclination to help him.  At last he finished, and added, 'The  most amusing part is, that he has told all, and so, you see, there are  some folks in a great fix.'  Thereupon he burst out laughing for the  first time in his life.  The Duchess of Maine, who had not the least  inclination thereto, said, 'Yes, that is very amusing.'  'O! it is enough  to make you die of laughing,' he resumed; 'fancy those folks who thought  their affair was quite a secret; here's one who tells more than he is  asked, and names everybody by name!'\"  The agony was prolonged for some  days; jokes were beginning to be made about it at the Duchess of Maine's;  she kept friends with her to pass the night in her room, waiting for her  arrest to come.  Madame de Stael was reading Machiavelli's conspiracies.  \"Make haste and take away that piece of evidence against us,\" said Madame  du Maine, laughingly, \"it would be one of the strongest.\"    The arrest came, however; it was six A.M., and everybody was asleep, when  the king's men entered the Duke of Maine's house.  The Regent had for a  long time delayed to act, as if he wanted to leave everybody time to get  away; but the conspirators were too scatter-brained to take the trouble.  The duchess was removed to Dijon, within the government, and into the  very house of the Duke of Bourbon, her nephew, which was a very bitter  pill for her.  The Duke of Maine, who protested his innocence and his  ignorance, was detained in the Castle of Dourlans in Picardy.  Cellamare  received his passports and quitted France.  The less illustrious  conspirators were all put in the Bastille; the majority did not remain  there long, and purchased their liberty by confessions, which the Duchess  of Maine ended by confirming.  \"Do not leave Paris until you are driven  thereto by force,\" Alberoni had written to the Prince of Cellamare, \"and  do not start before you have fired all the mines.\"  Cellamare started,  and the mines did not burst after his withdrawal; conspiracy and  conspirators were covered with ridicule; the natural clemency of the  Regent had been useful; the part of the Duke and Duchess of Maine was  played out.    The only serious result of Cellamare's conspiracy was to render imminent  a rupture with Spain.  From the first days of the regency the old enmity  of Philip V. towards the Duke of Orleans and the secret pretensions of  both of them to the crown of France, in case of little Louis XV.'s death,  rendered the relations between the two courts thorny and strained at  bottom, though still perfectly smooth in appearance.  It was from England  that Abbe Dubois urged the Regent to seek support.  Dubois, born in the  very lowest position, and endowed with a soul worthy of his origin, was  \"a little, lean man, wire-drawn, with a light colored wig, the look of a  weasel, a clever expression,\" says St. Simon, who detested him; \"all  vices struggled within him for the mastery; they kept up a constant  hubbub and strife together.  Avarice, debauchery, ambition, were his  gods; perfidy, flattery, slavishness, his instruments; and complete  unbelief his comfort.  He excelled in low intrigues; the boldest lie was  second nature to him, with an air of simplicity, straightforwardness,  sincerity, and often bashfulness.\"  In spite of all these vices, and the  depraving influence he had exercised over the Duke of Orleans from his  earliest youth, Dubois was able, often far-sighted, and sometimes bold;  he had a correct and tolerably practical mind.  Madame, who was afraid of  him, had said to her son on the day of his elevation to power, \"I desire  only the welfare of the state and your own glory; I have but one request  to make for your honor's sake, and I demand your word for it, that is,  never to employ that scoundrel of an Abbe Dubois, the greatest rascal in  the world, and one who would sacrifice the state and you to the slightest  interest.\"  The Regent promised; yet a few months later and Dubois was  Church-councillor of State, and his growing influence with the prince  placed him, at first secretly, and before long openly, at the head of  foreign affairs.    [Illustration: Cardinal Dubois----78]    James Stuart, King James II.'s son, whom his friends called James III.  and his enemies Chevalier St. George, had just unsuccessfully attempted a  descent upon Scotland.  The Jacobites had risen; they were crying aloud  for their prince, who remained concealed in Lorraine, when at last he  resolved to set out and traverse France secretly.  Agents, posted by the  English ambassador, Lord Stair, were within an ace of arresting him,  perhaps of murdering him.  Saved by the intelligence and devotion of the  post-mistress of Nonancourt, he embarked on the 26th of December at  Dunkerque, too late to bring even moral support to the men who were  fighting and dying for him.  Six weeks after landing at Peterhead, in  Scotland, he started back again without having struck a blow, without  having set eyes upon the enemy, leaving to King George I. the easy task  of avenging himself by sending to death upon the scaffold the noblest  victims.  The Duke of Orleans had given him a little money, had known of  and had encouraged his passage through France, but had accorded him no  effectual aid; the wrath of both parties, nevertheless, fell on him.    Inspired by Dubois, weary of the weakness and dastardly incapacity of the  Pretender, the Regent consented to make overtures to the King of England.  The Spanish nation was favorable to France, but the king was hostile to  the Regent; the English loved neither France nor the Regent, but their  king had an interest in severing France from the Pretender forever.  Dubois availed himself ably of his former relations with Lord Stanhope,  heretofore commander of the English troops in Spain, for commencing a  secret negotiation which soon extended to Holland, still closely knit to  England.  \"The character of our Regent,\" wrote Dubois on the 10th of  March, 1716, \"leaves no ground for fearing lest he should pique himself  upon perpetuating the prejudices and the procedure of our late court,  and, as you yourself remark, he has too much wit not to see his true  interest.\"  Dubois was the bearer to the Hague of the Regent's proposals;  King George was to cross over thither; the clever negotiator veiled his  trip under the pretext of purchasing rare books; he was going, he said,  to recover from the hands of the Jews Le Poussin's famous pictures of the  Seven Sacraments, not long ago carried off from Paris.  The order of  succession to the crowns of France and England, conformably to the peace  of Utrecht, was guaranteed in the scheme of treaty; that was the only  important advantage to the Regent, who considered himself to be thus  nailing the renunciation of Philip V.; in other respects all the  concessions came"]]]
