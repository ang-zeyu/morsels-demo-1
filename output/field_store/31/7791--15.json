The workers,  originally concerned only in the amelioration of their material  position, have, in theory, abandoned the basis of the modern State, and  seek their salvation in the revolution which they preach. They do not  wish to obtain what they can within the limitations of the historically  recognized State, but they wish to substitute for it a new State, in  which they themselves are the rulers. By this aspiration they not only  perpetually menace State and society, but endanger in the separate  countries the industries from which they live, since they threaten to  destroy the possibility of competing in the international markets by  continuous increase of wages and decrease of work. Even in Germany this  movement has affected large sections of the population.    Until approximately the middle of the last century, agriculture and  cattle-breeding formed the chief and most important part of German  industries. Since then, under the protection of wise tariffs, and in  connection with the rapid growth of the German merchant navy, trade has  marvellously increased. Germany has become an industrial and trading  nation; almost the whole of the growing increase of the population finds  work and employment in this sphere. Agriculture has more and more lost its  leading position in the economic life of the people. The artisan  class has thus become a power in our State. It is organized in trade  unions, and has politically fallen under the influence of the  international social democracy. It is hostile to the national class  distinctions, and strains every nerve to undermine the existing power of  the State.    It is evident that the State cannot tolerate quietly this dangerous  agitation, and that it must hinder, by every means, the efforts of the  anti-constitutionalist party to effect their purpose. The law of  self-preservation demands this; but it is clear that, to a certain  point, the pretensions of the working classes are justified. The citizen  may fairly claim to protect himself from poverty by work, and to have an  opportunity of raising himself in the social scale, if he willingly  devotes his powers. He is entitled to demand that the State should grant  this claim, and should be bound to protect him against the tyranny of  capital.    Two means of attaining such an object are open to the State: first, it  may create opportunities of work, which secure remunerative employment  to all willing hands; secondly, it may insure the workman by legislation  against every diminution in his capacity to work owing to sickness, age,  or accident; may give him material assistance when temporarily out of  work, and protect him against compulsion which may hinder him from  working.    The economical prosperity of Germany as the visible result of three  victorious campaigns created a labour market sufficiently large for  present purposes, although without the conscious intention of the State.  German labour, under the protection of the political power, gained a  market for itself. On the other hand, the German State has intervened  with legislation, with full consciousness of the end and the means. As  Scharnhorst once contrasted the duty of the citizen with the rights of  man, so the Emperor William I. recognized the duty of the State towards  those who were badly equipped with the necessaries of life. The position  of the worker was assured, so far as circumstances allowed, by social  legislation. No excuse, therefore, for revolutionary agitation now  existed.    A vigorous opposition to all the encroachments of the social democrats  indicated the only right way in which the justifiable efforts of the  working class could be reconciled with the continuance of the existing  State and of existing society, the two pillars of all civilization and  progress. This task is by no means completed. The question still is, How  to win back the working class to the ideals of State and country? Willing  workers must be still further protected against social democratic tyranny.    Germany, nevertheless, is in social-political respects at the head of  all progress in culture. German science has held its place in the world.  Germany certainly took the lead in political sciences during the last  century, and in all other domains of intellectual inquiry has won a  prominent position through the universality of her philosophy and her  thorough and unprejudiced research into the nature of things.    The achievements of Germany in the sphere of science and literature are  attested by the fact that the annual export of German books to foreign  countries is, according to trustworthy estimates, twice as large as that  of France, England, and America combined. It is only in the domain of  the exact sciences that Germany has often been compelled to give  precedence to foreign countries. German art also has failed to win a  leading position. It shows, indeed, sound promise in many directions,  and has produced much that is really great; but the chaos of our  political conditions is, unfortunately, reflected in it. The German  Empire has politically been split up into numerous parties. Not only are  the social democrats and the middle class opposed, but they, again, are  divided among themselves; not only are industries and agriculture bitter  enemies, but the national sentiment has not yet been able to vanquish  denominational antagonisms, and the historical hostility between North  and South has prevented the population from growing into a completely  united body.    So stands Germany to-day, torn by internal dissensions, yet full of  sustained strength; threatened on all sides by dangers, compressed into  narrow, unnatural limits, she still is filled with high aspirations, in  her nationality, her intellectual development, in her science,  industries, and trade.    And now, what paths does this history indicate to us for the future?  What duties are enforced on us by the past?    It is a question of far-reaching importance; for on the way in which the  German State answers this question, depend not only our own further  development, but to some extent the subsequent shaping of the history of  the world.          CHAPTER IV        GERMANY'S HISTORICAL MISSION    Let us pass before our mind's eye the whole course of our historical  development, and let us picture to ourselves the life-giving streams of  human beings, that in every age have poured forth from the Empire of  Central Europe to all parts of the globe; let us reflect what rich seeds  of intellectual and moral development were sown by the German  intellectual life: the proud conviction forces itself upon us with  irresistible power that a high, if not the highest, importance for the  entire development of the human race is ascribable to this German  people.    This conviction is based on the intellectual merits of our nation, on  the freedom and the universality of the German spirit, which have ever  and again been shown in the course of its history. There is no nation  whose thinking is at once so free from prejudice and so historical as  the German, which knows how to unite so harmoniously the freedom of the  intellectual and the restraint of the practical life on the path of free  and natural development. The Germans have thus always been the  standard-bearers of free thought, but at the same time a strong bulwark  against revolutionary anarchical outbreaks. They have often been worsted  in the struggle for intellectual freedom, and poured out their best  heart's blood in the cause. Intellectual compulsion has sometimes ruled  the Germans; revolutionary tremors have shaken the life of this  people--the great peasant war in the sixteenth century, and the  political attempts at revolution in the middle of the nineteenth  century. But the revolutionary movement has been checked and directed  into the paths of a healthy natural advancement. The inevitable need of  a free intellectual self-determination has again and again disengaged  itself from the inner life of the soul of the people, and broadened into  world-historical importance.    Thus two great movements were born from the German intellectual life, on  which, henceforth, all the intellectual and moral progress of man must  rest: the Reformation and the critical philosophy. The Reformation,  which broke the intellectual yoke, imposed by the Church, which checked  all free progress; and the Critique of Pure Reason, which put a stop to  the caprice of philosophic speculation by defining for the human mind  the limitations of its capacity for knowledge, and at the same time  pointed out in what way knowledge is really possible. On this  substructure was developed the intellectual life of our time, whose  deepest significance consists in the attempt to reconcile the result of  free inquiry with the religious needs of the heart, and to lay a  foundation for the harmonious organization of mankind. Torn this way and  that, between hostile forces, in a continuous feud between faith and  knowledge, mankind seems to have lost the straight road of progress.  Reconciliation only appears possible when the thought of religious  reformation leads to a permanent explanation of the idea of religion,  and science remains conscious of the limits of its power, and does not  attempt to explain the domain of the supersensual world from the results  of natural philosophy.    The German nation not only laid the foundations of this great struggle  for an harmonious development of humanity, but took the lead in it. We  are thus incurring an obligation for the future, from which we cannot  shrink. We must be prepared to be the leaders in this campaign, which is  being fought for the highest stake that has been offered to human  efforts. Our nation is not only bound by its past history to take part  in this struggle, but is peculiarly adapted to do so by its special  qualities.
