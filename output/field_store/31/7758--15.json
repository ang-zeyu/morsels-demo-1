In all the world was scarcity of bread, and hunger and famine oppressed  specially and most, the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan. Of which  lands Joseph gat all the money for selling of wheat, and brought it into  the king's treasury. When all people lacked money, all Egypt came to  Joseph saying: Give us bread, why die we to the lacking money. To whom  he answered: Bring to me your beasts and I shall give you for them  victuals, if ye have no money: which when they brought, he gave to them  victuals and food for horses, sheep, oxen and asses, and sustained them  one year for changing of their beasts. Then came they again the second  year and said: We hide not from thee our lord that our money is failed  and also our beasts be gone, and there is nothing left but our bodies  and our land. Why then shall we die in thy sight? And we ourselves and  also our land shall be thine, buy us into bondship and servitude of the  king, and give us seed to sow lest the earth turn into wilderness. Then  Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, every man selling his possessions  for the vehement hunger that they had. He subdued all unto Pharaoh, and  all his people from the last terms of Egypt unto the utterest ends of  the same, except the land longing to the priests, which was given to  them by the king, to whom were given victuals openly out of all the  barns and garners, and therefore they were not compelled to sell their  possessions. Then said Joseph to all the peoples: Lo, now ye see and  know that Pharaoh oweth and is in possession of you and of your land.  Take to you seed and sow ye the fields that ye may have fruit. The fifth  part thereof ye shall give to the king and four parts I promise to you  to sow, and for meat to your servants and to your children. Which  answered: Our health is in thine hand, let our lord only behold us and  we shall gladly serve the king. From that time unto this present day, in  all the land of Egypt the fifth part is paid to the king; and it is  holden for a law, except the land longing to the priests which is free  from this condition.    Then Israel dwelled in Egypt in the land of Goshen, and was in  possession thereof. He increased and multiplied greatly, and lived  therein seventeen years. And all the years of his life were an hundred  and seven and forty years. When he understood that the day of his death  approached, he called to him his son Joseph and said to him: If I may  find so much grace in thy sight, do to me so much mercy as thou promise  and swear that thou bury me not in Egypt, but that I may rest with my  fathers, and take and carry me from this land, and lay me in the  sepulchre of my forefathers. To whom Joseph answered: I shall do that  thou hast commanded. Then said he: Swear to me, and so he swore. And  then Israel adored and worshipped our Lord, and turned him toward his  bed's head. Then this done, anon after it was told to Joseph that his  father was sick and feeble; who anon took his sons Manasseh and Ephraim  and came to his father. Anon it was told to the father: Lo thy son  Joseph cometh to thee, which then was comforted, and sat up in his bed.  And Joseph entered in, and Jacob said: Almighty God appeared to me in  Luz which is in the land of Canaan, and he blessed me and said: I shall  increase thee and multiply thee into tourbes of peoples, I shall give to  thee this land and to thy seed after thee in sempiternal possession,  therefore thy two sons that be born to thee in this land of Egypt tofore  I came hither to thee, shall be my sons Ephraim and Manasseh, they shall  be reputed to me as Simeon and Reuben. The other that thou shalt get  after them shall be thine, and shall be called in the name of their  brethren in their possessions. Then he, seeing Joseph's sons, said to  him: Who be these children? Joseph answered: They be my sons which God  hath given to me in this place. Bring them hither, said he, to me that I  may bless them. Israel's eyes were dimmed and might not see clearly for  great age. He took them to him and kissed them and said to Joseph: I am  not defrauded from the sight of thee, and furthermore God hath showed to  me thy seed. Then when Joseph took them from his father's lap, he  worshipped him kneeling low to the earth, and set Ephraim on his right  side, and on the left side of Israel, and Manasseh on the right side of  his father Israel, which took his right hand and laid it on the head of  Ephraim the younger brother, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh  which was first born. Then Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph and said:  God, in whose sight walked my fathers Abraham and Isaac, God that hath  fed me from my youth unto this present day, the angel that hath kept me  from all evil bless these children, and my name be called on them, and  the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and grow they into multitude  upon earth. Then Joseph seeing that his father set his right hand upon  the head of Ephraim the younger brother took it heavily, and took his  father's hand and would have laid it on the head of Manasseh, and said  to his father; Nay father, it is not convenient, that ye do, this is the  first begotten son, set thy right hand on his head. Which renied that  and would not do so, but said: I wot, my son, I wot what I do, and this  son shall increase into peoples and multiply, but his younger brother  shall be greater than he, and his seed shall grow into gentiles, and  blessed them, saying that same time: In thee shall be blessed Israel,  and shall be said: God make thee like to Ephraim and Manasseh. And he  said to Joseph his son: Lo! now I die and God shall be with you, and  shall reduce and bring you again into the land of your fathers; and I  give to thee one part above thy brethren, which I gat and won from the  hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow. Then Jacob called his sons  tofore him and said to them:    Gather ye altogether tofore me, that I may show to you things that be to  come, and hear your father Israel. And there he told to each of them his  condition singularly. And when he had blessed his twelve sons he  commanded them to bury him with his fathers in a double spelunke which  is in the field of Ephron the Hittite against Mamre in the land of  Canaan which Abraham bought. And this said he gathered to him his feet  and died. Which anon as Joseph saw, he fell on his visage and kissed  him. He commanded to his masters of physic and medicines, which were his  servants, that they should embalm the body of his father with sweet  spices aromatic; which was all done, and then went they sorrowing him  forty days. The Egyptians wailed him seventy days, and when the wailing  was past, Joseph did say to Pharaoh how he had sworn and promised to  bury him in the land of Canaan. To whom Pharaoh said: Go and bury thy  father like as thou hast sworn. Which then took his father's body and  went, and with him were accompanied all the aged men of Pharaoh's house,  and the noblest men of birth of all the land of Egypt, the house of  Joseph with his brethren, without the young children, flocks and beasts,  which they left in the land of Goshen. He had in his fellowship  chariots, carts and horsemen, and was a great tourbe and company, and  came over Jordan where as they hallowed the exequies by great wailing  seven days long. And when they of the country saw this plaint and  sorrowing they said: This is a great sorrow to the Egyptians. And that  same place is named yet the bewailing of Egypt. The children of Israel  did as they were commanded, and bare him into the land of Canaan, and  buried him in the double spelunke which Abraham had bought. Then when  Jacob the father was buried, Joseph with all his fellowship returned  into Egypt. Then his brethren after the death of their father spake  together privily, and dreading that Joseph would avenge the wrong and  evil that they had done to him, came to him and said: Thy father  commanded us ere he died that we should say thus to thee: We pray thee  that thou wilt forget, and not remember the sin and trespass of thy  brethren, ne the malice that they executed in thee. We beseech thee  that thou wilt forgive to thy father, servant of God, this wickedness.  Which when Joseph heard he wept bitterly, and his brethren came to him  kneeling low to the ground and worshipped him, and said, We be thy  servants. To whom he answered: Be ye nothing afeard ne dread you not,  ween ye that ye may resist God's will? Ye thought to have done to me  evil, but God hath turned it into good, and hath exalted me as ye see  and know, that he should save much people. Be ye nothing afeard, I shall  feed you and your children. And comforted them with fair words, and  spake friendly and joyously to them. And he abode and dwelled still in  Egypt with all the house of his father, and lived an hundred and ten  years, and saw the sons of Ephraim in to the third generation. After  these things he said to his brethren: After my death, God shall visit  you and shall do you depart from this land unto the land that he  promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. When that time shall come, take  my bones and lead them with you from this place, and then died. Whose  body was embalmed with sweet spices and aromatics and laid in a chest in  Egypt.

I do not mention these things by way of making a pitiful wail over my  losses, nor in order to excite commiseration; for, though I do feel  sorry for the loss of lexicons, dictionaries, &c., which had been the  companions of my boyhood, yet, after all, the plundering only set me  entirely free for my expedition to the north, and I have never since had  a moment's concern for any thing I left behind. The Boers resolved to  shut up the interior, and I determined to open the country, and we shall  see who have been most successful in resolution, they or I.    A short sketch of African housekeeping may not prove uninteresting to  the reader. The entire absence of shops led us to make every thing we  needed from the raw materials. You want bricks to build a house, and  must forthwith proceed to the field, cut down a tree, and saw it into  planks to make the brick-moulds; the materials for doors and windows,  too, are standing in the forest; and, if you want to be respected by  the natives, a house of decent dimensions, costing an immense amount of  manual labor, must be built. The people can not assist you much; for,  though most willing to labor for wages, the Bakwains have a curious  inability to make or put things square: like all Bechuanas, their  dwellings are made round. In the case of three large houses, erected by  myself at different times, every brick and stick had to be put square by  my own right hand.    Having got the meal ground, the wife proceeds to make it into bread; an  extempore oven is often constructed by scooping out a large hole in an  anthill, and using a slab of stone for a door. Another plan, which might  be adopted by the Australians to produce something better than their  \"dampers\", is to make a good fire on a level piece of ground, and,  when the ground is thoroughly heated, place the dough in a small,  short-handled frying-pan, or simply on the hot ashes; invert any sort of  metal pot over it, draw the ashes around, and then make a small fire  on the top. Dough, mixed with a little leaven from a former baking, and  allowed to stand an hour or two in the sun, will by this process become  excellent bread.    We made our own butter, a jar serving as a churn; and our own candles  by means of moulds; and soap was procured from the ashes of the plant  salsola, or from wood-ashes, which in Africa contain so little alkaline  matter that the boiling of successive leys has to be continued for  a month or six weeks before the fat is saponified. There is not much  hardship in being almost entirely dependent on ourselves; there is  something of the feeling which must have animated Alexander Selkirk on  seeing conveniences springing up before him from his own ingenuity; and  married life is all the sweeter when so many comforts emanate directly  from the thrifty striving housewife's hands.    To some it may appear quite a romantic mode of life; it is one of active  benevolence, such as the good may enjoy at home. Take a single day as  a sample of the whole. We rose early, because, however hot the day may  have been, the evening, night, and morning at Kolobeng were deliciously  refreshing; cool is not the word, where you have neither an increase of  cold nor heat to desire, and where you can sit out till midnight with no  fear of coughs or rheumatism. After family worship and breakfast between  six and seven, we went to keep school for all who would attend--men,  women, and children being all invited. School over at eleven o'clock,  while the missionary's wife was occupied in domestic matters, the  missionary himself had some manual labor as a smith, carpenter, or  gardener, according to whatever was needed for ourselves or for the  people; if for the latter, they worked for us in the garden, or at some  other employment; skilled labor was thus exchanged for the unskilled.  After dinner and an hour's rest, the wife attended her infant-school,  which the young, who were left by their parents entirely to their own  caprice, liked amazingly, and generally mustered a hundred strong; or  she varied that with a sewing-school, having classes of girls to learn  the art; this, too, was equally well relished. During the day every  operation must be superintended, and both husband and wife must labor  till the sun declines. After sunset the husband went into the town to  converse with any one willing to do so, sometimes on general subjects,  at other times on religion. On three nights of the week, as soon as the  milking of the cows was over and it had become dark, we had a public  religious service, and one of instruction on secular subjects, aided  by pictures and specimens. These services were diversified by attending  upon the sick and prescribing for them, giving food, and otherwise  assisting the poor and wretched. We tried to gain their affections by  attending to the wants of the body. The smallest acts of friendship, an  obliging word and civil look, are, as St. Xavier thought, no despicable  part of the missionary armor. Nor ought the good opinion of the most  abject to be uncared for, when politeness may secure it. Their good  word in the aggregate forms a reputation which may be well employed  in procuring favor for the Gospel. Show kind attention to the reckless  opponents of Christianity on the bed of sickness and pain, and they  never can become your personal enemies. Here, if any where, love begets  love.    When at Kolobeng, during the droughts we were entirely dependent on  Kuruman for supplies of corn. Once we were reduced to living on bran,  to convert which into fine meal we had to grind it three times over. We  were much in want of animal food, which seems to be a greater necessary  of life there than vegetarians would imagine. Being alone, we could  not divide the butcher-meat of a slaughtered animal with a prospect  of getting a return with regularity. Sechele had, by right of  chieftainship, the breast of every animal slaughtered either at home or  abroad, and he most obligingly sent us a liberal share during the whole  period of our sojourn. But these supplies were necessarily so irregular  that we were sometimes fain to accept a dish of locusts. These are quite  a blessing in the country, so much so that the RAIN-DOCTORS sometimes  promised to bring them by their incantations. The locusts are strongly  vegetable in taste, the flavor varying with the plants on which they  feed. There is a physiological reason why locusts and honey should be  eaten together. Some are roasted and pounded into meal, which, eaten  with a little salt, is palatable. It will keep thus for months. Boiled,  they are disagreeable; but when they are roasted I should much prefer  locusts to shrimps, though I would avoid both if possible.    In traveling we sometimes suffered considerably from scarcity of meat,  though not from absolute want of food. This was felt more especially by  my children; and the natives, to show their sympathy, often gave them  a large kind of caterpillar, which they seemed to relish; these insects  could not be unwholesome, for the natives devoured them in large  quantities themselves.    Another article of which our children partook with eagerness was a very  large frog, called \"Matlametlo\".*       * The Pyxicephalus adspersus of Dr. Smith.     Length of head and body, 5-1/2 inches;     fore legs, 3 inches;     hind legs, 6 inches.     Width of head posteriorly, 3 inches;     of body, 4-1/2 inches.    These enormous frogs, which, when cooked, look like chickens, are  supposed by the natives to fall down from thunder-clouds, because after  a heavy thunder-shower the pools, which are filled and retain water a  few days, become instantly alive with this loud-croaking, pugnacious  game. This phenomenon takes place in the driest parts of the desert, and  in places where, to an ordinary observer, there is not a sign of life.  Having been once benighted in a district of the Kalahari where there  was no prospect of getting water for our cattle for a day or two, I  was surprised to hear in the fine still evening the croaking of frogs.  Walking out until I was certain that the musicians were between me  and our fire, I found that they could be merry on nothing else but  a prospect of rain. From the Bushmen I afterward learned that the  matlametlo makes a hole at the root of certain bushes, and there  ensconces himself during the months of drought. As he seldom emerges, a  large variety of spider takes advantage of the hole, and makes its  web across the orifice. He is thus furnished with a window and screen  gratis; and no one but a Bushman would think of searching beneath  a spider's web for a frog. They completely eluded my search on the  occasion referred to; and as they rush forth into the hollows filled by  the thunder-shower when the rain is actually falling, and the Bechuanas  are cowering under their skin garments, the sudden chorus struck up  simultaneously from all sides seems to indicate a descent from the  clouds.    The presence of these matlametlo in the desert in a time of drought was  rather a disappointment, for I had been accustomed to suppose that the  note was always emitted by them when they were chin-deep in water. Their  music was always regarded in other spots as the most pleasant sound that  met the ear after crossing portions of the thirsty desert; and I could  fully appreciate the sympathy for these animals shown by Aesop, himself  an African, in his fable of the \"Boys and the Frogs\".    It is remarkable that attempts have not been made to any extent to  domesticate some of the noble and useful creatures of Africa in England.  The eland, which is the most magnificent of all antelopes, would  grace the parks of our nobility more than deer. This animal, from the  excellence of its flesh, would be appropriate to our own country; and as  there is also a splendid esculent frog nearly as large"]]]
