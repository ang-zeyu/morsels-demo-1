Hymn 2:7.  An evening song.    1 [Dread Sovereign, let my evening song  Like holy incense rise;  Assist the offerings of my tongue  To reach the lofty skies.    2 Thro' all the dangers of the day,  Thy hand was still my guard,  And still to drive my wants away  Thy mercy stood prepar'd.]    3 Perpetual blessings from above  Encompass me around,  But O how few returns of love  Hath my Creator found!    4 What have I done for him that dy'd  To save my wretched soul?  How are my follies multiply'd,  Fast as my minutes roll;    5 Lord, with this guilty heart of mine  To thy dear cross I flee,  And to thy grace my soul resign  To be renew'd by thee.    6 Sprinkled afresh with pardoning blood  I lay me down to rest,  As in th' embraces of my God,  Or on my Saviour's breast.      Hymn 2:8.  A hymn for morning or evening.    1 Hosanna, with a cheerful sound,  To God's upholding hand;  Ten thousand snares attend us round,  And yet secure we stand.    2 That was a most amazing power  That rais'd us with a word,  And every day and every hour  We lean upon the Lord.    3 The evening rests our weary head,  And angels guard the room;  We wake and we admire the bed  That was not made our tomb.    4 The rising morning can't assure  That we shall end the day,  For death stands ready at the door  To seize our lives away.    5 Our breath is forfeited by sin  To God's revenging law;  We own thy grace, immortal King,  In every gasp we draw.    6 God is our sun, whose daily light  Our joy and safety brings:  Our feeble flesh lies safe at night  Beneath his shady wings.      Hymn 2:9.  Godly sorrow arising from the sufferings of Christ.    1 Alas! and did my Saviour bleed,  And did my Sovereign die?  Would he devote that sacred head  For such a worm as I?    2 [Thy body slain, sweet Jesus, thine,  And bath'd in its own blood,  While all expos'd to wrath divine  The glorious Sufferer stood.]    3 Was it for crimes that I had done  He groan'd upon the tree?  Amazing pity! grace unknown!  And love beyond degree!    4 Well might the sun in darkness hide,  And shut his glories in,  When God the mighty Maker dy'd  For man the creature's sin.    5 Thus might I hide my blushing face  While his dear cross appears,  Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,  And melt my eyes to tears.    6 But drops of grief can ne'er repay  The debt of love I owe;  Here, Lord, I give myself away,  'Tis all that I can do.      Hymn 2:10.  Parting with carnal joys.    1 My soul forsakes her vain delight,  And bids the world farewell  Base as the dirt beneath my feet,  And mischievous as hell.    2 No longer will I ask your love,  Nor seek your friendship more;  The happiness that I approve  Lies not within your power.    3 There's nothing round this spacious earth  That suits my large desire;  To boundless joy and solid mirth  My nobler thoughts aspire.    4 [Where pleasure rolls its living flood,  From sin and dross refin'd,  Still springing from the throne of God,  And fit to cheer the mind.    5 Th' Almighty Ruler of the sphere,  The glorious and the great,  Brings his own all-sufficience there,  To make our bliss complete.]    6 Had I the pinions of a dove,  I'd climb the heavenly road;  There sits my Saviour dress'd in love,  And there my smiling God.      Hymn 2:11.  The same.    1 Send the joys of earth away,  Away ye tempters of the mind,  False as the smooth deceitful sea,  And empty as the whistling wind.    2 Your streams were floating me along  Down to the gulf of black despair,  And whilst I listen'd to your song,  Your streams had e'en convey'd me there.    3 Lord, I adore thy matchless grace,  That warn'd me of that dark abyss,  That drew me from those treacherous seas,  And bid me seek superior bliss.    4 Now to the shining realms above  I stretch my hands, and glance mine eyes;  O for the pinions of a dove  To bear me to the upper skies.    5 There from the bosom of my God  Oceans of endless pleasure roll;  There would I fix my last abode,  And drown the sorrows of my soul.      Hymn 2:12.  Christ is the substance of the Levitical priesthood.    1 The true Messiah now appears,  The types are all withdrawn;  So fly the shadows and the stars  Before the rising dawn.    2 No smoking sweets, nor bleeding lambs,  Nor kid, nor bullock slain,  Incense and spice of costly names  Would all be burnt in vain.    3 Aaron must lay his robes away;  His mitre and his vest,  When God himself comes down to be  The offering and the priest.    4 He took our mortal flesh to show  The wonders of his love;  For us he paid his life below,  And prays for us above.    5 \"Father, (he cries) forgive their sins,  \"For I myself have dy'd,\"  And then he shews his open'd veins,  And pleads his wounded side.      Hymn 2:13.  The creation, preservation, dissolution, and  restoration of this world.    1 Sing to the Lord that built the skies,  The Lord that rear'd this stately frame;  Let half the nations sound his praise,  And lands unknown repeat his Name.    2 He form'd the seas, and form'd the hills,  Made every drop and every dust,  Nature and time with all their wheels,  And push'd them into motion first.    3 Now from his high imperial throne  He looks far down upon the spheres;  He bids the shining orbs roll on,  And round he turns our hasty years.    4 Thus shall this moving engine last  Till all his saints are gather'd in,  Then for the trumpet's dreadful blast  To shake it all to dust again!    5 Yet when the sound shall tear the skies,  And lightning burn the globe below,  Saints, you may lift your joyful eyes,  There's a new heaven and earth for you.      Hymn 2:14.  The Lord's day; or, Delight in ordinances.    1 Welcome, sweet day of rest,  That saw the Lord arise;  Welcome to this reviving breast,  And these rejoicing eyes!    2 The King himself comes near,  And feasts his saints to-day,  Here we may sit, and see him here,  And love, and praise, and pray.    3 One day amidst the place  Where my dear God hath been,  Is sweeter than ten thousand days  Of pleasurable sin.    4 My willing soul would stay  In such a frame as this,  And sit and sing herself away  To everlasting bliss.      Hymn 2:15.  The enjoyment of Christ; or, Delight in worship.    1 Far from my thoughts, vain world, be gone,  Let my religious hours alone;  Fain would my eyes my Saviour see,  I wait a visit, Lord, from thee.    2 My heart grows warm with holy fire,  And kindles with a pure desire:  Come, my dear Jesus, from above,  And feed my soul with heavenly love.    3 [The trees of life immortal stand  In flourishing rows at thy right-hand,  And in sweet murmurs by their side  Rivers of bliss perpetual glide.    4 Haste then, but with a smiling face,  And spread the table of thy grace:  Bring down a taste of fruit divine,  And cheer my heart with sacred wine.]    6 Blest Jesus, what delicious fare!  How sweet thy entertainments are!  Never did angels taste above  Redeeming grace, and dying love.    6 Hail, great Immanuel, all divine,  In thee thy Father's glories shine;  Thou brightest, sweetest, fairest one,  That eyes have seen, or angels known.      Hymn 2:16.  Part the second.    7 Lord, what a heaven of saving grace,  Shines thro' the beauties of thy face,  And lights our passions to a flame!  Lord, how we love thy charming Name!    8 When I can say, my God is mine,  When I can feel thy glories shine,  I tread the world beneath my feet,  And all that earth calls good or great.    9 While such a scene of sacred joys  Our raptur'd eyes and souls employs,  Here we could sit, and gaze away  A long, an everlasting day.    10 Well, we shall quickly pass the night  To the fair coasts of perfect light;  Then shall our joyful senses rove  O'er the dear object of our love.    11 [There shall we drink full draughts of bliss,  And pluck new life from heavenly trees:  Yet now, and then, dear Lord, bestow  A drop of heaven on worms below.    12 Send comforts down from thy right-hand,  While we pass thro' this barren land,  And in thy temple let us see  A glimpse of love, a glimpse of thee.]      Hymn 2:17  God's eternity.    1 Rise, rise, my soul, and leave the ground,  Stretch all thy thoughts abroad,  And rouse up every tuneful sound  To praise th' eternal God.    2 Long ere the lofty skies were spread  Jehovah fill'd his throne;  Or Adam form'd, or angels made,  The Maker liv'd alone.    3 His boundless years can ne'er decrease,  But still maintain their prime;  Eternity's his dwelling-place,  And ever is his time.    4 While like a tide our minutes flow,  The present and the past,  He fills his own immortal now,  And sees our ages waste.    5 The sea and sky must perish too,  And vast destruction come!  The creatures--look, how old they grow,  And wait their fiery doom!    6 Well, let the sea shrink all away,  And flame melt down the skies,  My God shall live an endless day,  When th' old creation dies.      Hymn 2:18.  The ministry of angels.    1 High on a hill of dazzling light,  The King of Glory spreads his seat,  And troops of angels stretch'd for flight,  Stand waiting round his awful feet.    2 \"Go,\" saith the Lord, \"my Gabriel go,  \"Salute the virgin's fruitful womb,[1]  \"Make haste, ye cherubs, down below,  Sing and proclaim the Saviour come.\"    3 Here a bright squadron leaves the skies,  And thick around Elisha stands;[2]  Anon a heavenly soldier flies,  And breaks the chains from Peter's hands.[3]    4 Thy winged troops, O God of hosts,  Wait on thy wandering church below,  Here we are sailing to thy coasts,  Let angels be our convoy too.    5 Are they not all thy servants,[4] Lord?  At thy command they go and come  With cheerful haste obey thy word,  And guard thy children to their home."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13376"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage, King AEthelbert, 596 to King George III, 1775 (#15)"],[1,"interests in the shires  and in the shire courts. This officer came to be selected by the  king and earl of the shire to be a judicial and financial deputy  of the earl and to execute the law. The office of sheriff, which  was not hereditary, was also responsible for the administration of  royal lands and royal accounts. The sheriff summoned the freemen  holding land in the shire, four men selected by each community or  township, and all public officers to meet twice a year at their  \"shiremote\". Actually only the great lords - the bishops, earls,  and thegns - attended. The shire court was primarily concerned  with issues of the larger landholders. Here the freemen  interpreted the customary law of the locality. The earl declared  the secular law and the bishop declared the spiritual law. They  also declared the sentence of the judges. The earl usually took a  third of the profits, such as fines and forfeits, of the shire  court, and the bishop took a share. In time, the earls each came  to supervise several shires and the sheriff became head of the  shire and assumed the earl's duties there, such as heading the  county fyrd. The shire court also heard cases which had been  refused justice at the hundredmote and cases of keeping the peace  of the shire.    The hundred was a division of the shire, having come to refer to a  geographical area rather than a number of households. The monthly  hundredmote could be attended by any freeman holding land (or a  lord's steward), but was usually attended only by reeve, thegns,  parish priest, and four representatives selected by each agrarian  community or village - usually villeins. Here transfers of land  were witnessed. A reeve, sometimes the sheriff, presided over  local criminal and peace and order issues [\"leet jurisdiction\",  which derived from sac and soc jurisdiction] and civil cases at  the hundred court. All residents were expected to attend the leet  court. The sheriff usually held each hundred court in turn. The  suitors to these courts were the same as those of the shire  courts. They were the judges who declared the law and ordered the  form of proof, such as compurgatory oath and ordeal. They were  customarily thegns, often twelve in number. They, as well as the  king and the earl, received part of the profits of justice.  Summary procedure was followed when a criminal was caught in the  act or seized after a hue and cry. Every freeman over age twelve  had to be in a hundred and had to follow the hue and cry.    \"No one shall make distraint [seizure of personal property out of  the possession of an alleged wrongdoer into the custody of the  party injured, to procure a satisfaction for a wrong committed] of  property until he has appealed for justice in the hundred court  and shire court\".    In 997, King Ethelred in a law code ordered the sheriff and twelve  leading magnates of each shire to swear to accuse no innocent man,  nor conceal any guilty one. This was the germ of the later assize,  and later still the jury.    The integrity of the judicial system was protected by certain  penalties: for swearing a false oath, bot as determined by a  cleric who has heard his confession, or, if he has not confessed,  denial of burial in consecrated ground. Also a perjurer lost his  oath-worthiness. Swearing a false oath or perjury was also  punishable by loss of one's hand or half one's wergeld. A lord  denying justice, as by upholding an evildoing thegn of his, had  to pay 120s. to the king for his disobedience. Furthermore, if a  lord protected a theow of his who had stolen, he had to forfeit  the theow and pay his wer, for the first offense, and he was  liable for all he property, for subsequent offenses. There was a  bot for anyone harboring a convicted offender. If anyone failed to  attend the gemot thrice after being summoned, he was to pay the  king a fine for his disobedience. If he did not pay this fine or  do right, the chief men of the burh were to ride to him, and take  all his property to put into surety. If he did not know of a  person who would be his surety, he was to be imprisoned. Failing  that, he was to be killed. But if he escaped, anyone who harbored  him, knowing him to be a fugitive, would be liable pay his wer.  Anyone who avenged a thief without wounding anyone, had to pay the  king 120s. as wite for the assault.    \"And if anyone is so rich or belongs to so powerful a kindred,  that he cannot be restrained from crime or from protecting and  harboring criminals, he shall be led out of his native district  with his wife and children, and all his goods, to any part of the  kingdom which the King chooses, be he noble or commoner, whoever  he may be - with the provision that he shall never return to his  native district. And henceforth, let him never be encountered by  anyone in that district; otherwise he shall be treated as a thief  caught in the act.\"    This lawsuit between a son and his mother over land was heard at a  shire meeting: \"Here it is declared in this document that a shire  meeting sat at Aylton in King Cnut's time. There were present  Bishop AEthelstan and Earl Ranig and Edwin, the Earl's son, and  Leofwine, Wulfsige's son, and Thurkil the White; and Tofi the  Proud came there on the King's business, and Bryning the sheriff  was present, and AEthelweard of Frome and Leofwine of Frome and  Godric of Stoke and all the thegns of Herefordshire. Then Edwin,  Enneawnes son, came traveling to the meeting and sued his own  mother for a certain piece of land, namely Wellington and Cradley.  Then the bishop asked whose business it was to answer for his  mother, and Thurkil the White replied that it was his business to  do so, if he knew the claim. As he did not know the claim, three  thegns were chosen from the meeting [to ride] to the place where  she was, namely at Fawley, and these were Leofwine of Frome and  AEthelsige the Red and Winsige the seaman, and when they came to  her they asked her what claim she had to the lands for which her  son was suing her. Then she said that she had no land that in any  way belonged to him, and was strongly incensed against her son,  and summoned to her kinswoman, Leofflaed, Thurkil's wife, and in  front of them said to her as follows: 'Here sits Leofflaed, my  kinswoman, to whom, after my death, I grant my land and my gold,  my clothing and my raiment and all that I possess.' And then she  said to the thegns: 'Act like thegns, and duly announce my message  to the meeting before all the worthy men, and tell them to whom I  have granted my land and all my property, and not a thing to my  own son, and ask them to be witnesses of this.' And they did so;  they rode to the meeting and informed all the worthy men of the  charge that she had laid upon them. Then Thurkil the White stood  up in the meeting and asked all the thegns to give his wife the  lands unreservedly which her kinswoman had granted her, and they  did so. Then Thurkil rode to St. AEthelbert's minister, with the  consent and cognizance of the whole assembly, and had it recorded  in a gospel book.\"    Courts controlled by lords of large private estates had various  kinds of jurisdiction recognized by the King: sac and soke  [possession of legal powers of execution and profits of justice  held by a noble or institution over inhabitants and tenants of the  estate, exercised through a private court], toll [right to collect  a payment on the sale of cattle and property] and team [right to  hold a court to determine the honesty of a man accused of illegal  possession of cattle], infangenetheof [the authority to judge and  to hang and take the chattels of a thief caught on the property],  and utfangenetheof [the authority to judge and to hand and take  the chattels of a thief dwelling out of his liberty, and  committing theft without the same, if he were caught within the  lord's property]. Some lords were even given jurisdiction over  breach of the royal peace, ambush and treacherous manslaughter,  harboring of outlaws, forced entry into a residence, and failure  to answer a military summons. Often this court's jurisdiction  overlapped that of the hundred court and sometimes a whole hundred  had passed under the jurisdiction of an abbot, bishop, or earl.    A lord and his noble lady, or his steward, presided at this court.  The law was administered here on the same principles as at the  hundred court. Judges of the leet of the court of a large private  estate were chosen from the constables and four representatives  selected from each community, village, or town.    Before a dispute went to the hundred court, it might be taken care  of by the head tithing man, e.g. cases between vills, between  neighbors, and some compensations and settlements, namely  concerning pastures, meadows, harvests, and contests between  neighbors.    The vill [similar to village] was the smallest community for  judicial purposes. There were several vills in a hundred.    In London, the Hustings Court met weekly and decided such issues  as wills and bequests and commerce matters. The folkmote of all  citizens met three times a year. Each ward had a leet court [for  minor criminal matters].    The king and his witan decided the complaints and issues of the  nobility and those cases which had not received justice in the  hundred or shire court. The witan had a criminal jurisdiction and  could imprison or outlaw a person. The witan could even compel the  king to return any land he might have unjustly taken. Specially  punishable by the king was \"oferhyrnesse\": contempt of the king's  law. It covered refusal of justice, neglect of summons to gemot or  pursuit of thieves, disobedience to the king's officers, sounding  the king's coin, accepting another man's dependent without his  leave, buying outside markets, and refusing to pay Peter's pence.    The forests were peculiarly subject to the absolute will of the  king. They were outside the common law. Their unique"]]]
