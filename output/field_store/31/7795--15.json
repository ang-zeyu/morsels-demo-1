[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11464"],[0,"Cuba, Old and New (#15)"],[1,", politics came into the matter and, like our own under similar  circumstances, each Congressman insisted that some of such work as could  immediately be undertaken, some of the money that could be immediately  spent, should benefit his particular district. The result was that what was  done by the Cubans was somewhat scattered, short stretches built here and  there, new bridges built when there might or might not be a usable road to  them. The Cuban plan involved, for its completion, a period of years and  a large appropriation. It called for comparatively small yearly  appropriations for many roads, for more than four hundred different  projects. Then came the Second Intervention, in 1906, with what has seemed  to many of us an utterly unwise and unwarranted expenditure for the  completion of certain selected projects included in the Cuban plan. It may  be granted that the roads were needed, some of them very much needed, but  there are thousands of miles of unconstructed but much needed roads in  the United States. Yet, in this country, Federal, State, county, and town  treasuries are not drained to their last dollar, and their credit strained,  to build those roads. From the drain on its financial resources, the island  will recover, but the misfortune appears in the setting of a standard for  Federal expenditure, in its total for all purposes amounting to about  $40,000,000 a year, far beyond the reasonable or proper bearing power of  the island. But the work was done, the money spent, and the Cubans were  committed to more work and to further expenditure. I find no data showing  with exactness the mileage completed by the Magoon government, which came  to an end in January, 1909, but a Cuban official report made at the end of  1910 shows that the combined activities of the respective administrations,  Spanish, American, and Cuban, had given the island, at that time,  practically a thousand miles of improved highway, distributed throughout  the island.    To see the real Cuba, one must get into the country. Havana is the  principal city, and for many it is the most interesting place on the  island, but it is no more Cuba than Paris is France or than New York is the  United States. The real Cuba is rural; the real Cuban is a countryman, a  man of the soil. If he is rich, he desires to measure his possessions in  _caballerias_ of 33-1/3 acres; if poor, in _hectareas_ of 2-1/2 acres. I do  not recall any Cuban cartoon representing the Cuban people that was not a  picture of the peasant, the _guajiro_. Cuba, as a political organism, is  shown as a quite charming _senorita_, but _el pueblo Cubano_, the Cuban  people, are shown as the man of the fields. With the present equipment  of railroads, trolley lines, automobile busses, and highways, little  excursions are easily made in a day. The railways, trolleys, and automobile  busses are unsatisfactory means of locomotion for sight-seeing. The  passenger is rushed past the very sights that would be of the greatest  interest. To most of us, a private hired automobile is open to the very  serious objection of its expensiveness, an item that may sometimes be  reduced by division. It has been my good fortune in more recent years to be  whirled around in cars belonging to friends but my favorite trip in earlier  days is, I presume, still open to those who may care to make it. I have  recommended it to many, and have taken a number with me over the route.    It is an easy one-day excursion of about sixty miles, by rail to Guanajay,  by carriage to Marianao, and return to Havana by rail. Morning trains  run to Guanajay, through a region generally attractive and certainly  interesting to the novice, by way of Rincon and San Antonio de los Banos, a  somewhat roundabout route, but giving a very good idea of the country, its  plantations, villages, and peasant homes. At Guanajay, an early lunch, or a  late breakfast, may be obtained at the hotel, before or after an inspection  of the town itself, a typical place with its little central park, its old  church, and typical residences. Inquiry regarding the transportation to  Marianao by carriage should not be too direct. It should be treated as a  mere possibility depending upon a reasonable charge. I have sometimes spent  a very pleasant hour in intermittent bargaining with the competitors for  the job, although knowing very well what I would pay and what they would  finally accept. Amiably conducted, as such discussions should be in  Cuba, the chaffering becomes a matter of mutual entertainment. A bargain  concluded, a start may be made about noon for a drive over a good road,  through a series of typical villages, to Marianao, in time for a late  afternoon train to Havana, reaching there in ample time for dinner. Along  the road from Guanajay to Marianao, Maceo swept with ruthless hand in  1896, destroying Spanish property. Here the Spaniards, no less ruthless,  destroyed the property of Cubans. It is now a region of peaceful industry,  and little or nothing remains to indicate its condition when I first saw  it. The little villages along the way were in ruins, the fields were  uncultivated, and there were no cattle. At intervals there stood the walls  of what had been beautiful country estates. Only one of many was left  standing. At intervals, also, stood the Spanish blockhouses. All along that  route, in 1906, were the insurrectos of the unfortunate experience of that  year. In the village of Caimito, a short distance from Guanajay, along that  road, I visited Pino Guerra at his then headquarters when he and his  forces so menaced Havana that Secretary Taft, in his capacity of Peace  Commissioner, ordered their withdrawal to a greater distance. The trip by  rail and road, exhibits most of Cuba's special characteristics. There are  fields of sugar cane and fields of tobacco, country villages and peasant  homes, fruits and vegetables, ceiba trees, royal palms, cocoanut palms, and  mango trees. There is no other trip, as easily made, where so much can be  seen. But there are other excursions in the vicinity, for many reasons best  made by carriage or by private hired automobile. Within fifteen miles or so  of the city, are places like Calvario, Bejucal, and Managua, all reached  by good highways through interesting and typical country, and all well  illustrating the real life of the real Cubans. It was in the vicinity of  those places that Maximo Gomez operated in 1895 and 1896, terrorizing  Havana by menacing it from the south and the east while Maceo threatened it  from the west. Another short and pleasant trip can be made around the head  of the harbor to Guanabacoa, and thence to Cojimar. Another interesting and  easily reached point is Guines, a good example of places of its size and  class.    Of Cuba's larger cities, there are a score that would demand attention in a  guide-book. Just as there is a certain similarity in most American cities,  in that they are collections of business and residence buildings of  generally similar architecture, so is there a certain sameness in most of  Cuba's cities. To see two or three of them is to get a general idea of all,  although each has its particular features, some particular building, or  some special charm of surroundings. The most difficult of access are  Baracoa, the oldest city of the island, and Trinidad, founded only a few  years later. Glancing at some of these places, in their order from west  to east, the first is Pinar del Rio, a comparatively modern city, dating  really from the second half of the 18th Century. It owes its past and its  present importance to its location as a centre of the tobacco region of the  _Vuelta Abajo_. From comfortable headquarters here, excursions can be made,  by rail or road, through what is perhaps the most attractive, and not  the least interesting section of the island. To the north are the Organ  Mountains and the picturesque town of Vinales, one of the most charming  spots, in point of scenery, in Cuba. To the west, by rail, is Guane, the  oldest settlement in western Cuba, and all around are beautiful hills and  cultivated valleys. Eastward from Havana, the first city of importance is  Matanzas. Here is much to interest and much to charm, the city itself, its  harbor, its two rivers, the famous valley of the Yumuri, and the caves of  Bellamar. The city, founded in 1693, lies along the shore of the bay and  rises to the higher ground of the hills behind it. It lies about sixty  miles from Havana, and is easily reached by rail or by automobile. The  next city in order, also on the north coast, is Cardenas, a modern place,  settled in 1828, and owing its importance to its convenience as a shipping  port for the numerous sugar estates in its vicinity, an importance now  somewhat modified by the facilities for rail shipment to other harbors.  Seventy-five miles or so further eastward is Sagua la Grande, another point  of former convenience as a shipping point for sugar. The city itself is  located on a river, or estuary, some ten or twelve miles from its mouth.  Forty miles or so further on are Remedies and Caibarien, a few miles apart,  the latter on the coast and the former a few miles inland. Caibarien, like  Cardenas and Sagua, is chiefly notable as a sugar port, while Remedios is  the centre of one of the great tobacco districts, producing a leaf of good  quality but generally inferior to the _Partidos_ of Havana Province, and  quite inferior to the famous _Vuelta Abajo_. Southward of this region, and  about midway the width of the island, somewhat more than two hundred miles  eastward of Havana, is the city of Santa Clara, better known in the island  as Villa Clara. The city dates its existence from 1689. It lies surrounded  by rolling hills and expansive valleys, but in the absence of extensive  plantations in its immediate environs, one is led to wonder just why so  pleasant a place should be there, and why it should have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1149"],[0,"From London to Land's End (#15)"],[1,"\"Ecclesiastical Polity,\" and of several other valuable pieces.    6.

I shall take the north part of this county in my return from Cornwall; so  I must now lean to the south--that is to say, to the South Coast--for in  going on indeed we go south-west.    About twenty-two miles from Exeter we go to Totnes, on the River Dart.  This is a very good town, of some trade; but has more gentlemen in it  than tradesmen of note.  They have a very fine stone bridge here over the  river, which, being within seven or eight miles of the sea, is very  large; and the tide flows ten or twelve feet at the bridge.  Here we had  the diversion of seeing them catch fish with the assistance of a dog.  The  case is this:--On the south side of the river, and on a slip, or narrow  cut or channel made on purpose for a mill, there stands a corn-mill; the  mill-tail, or floor for the water below the wheels, is wharfed up on  either side with stone above high-water mark, and for above twenty or  thirty feet in length below it on that part of the river towards the sea;  at the end of this wharfing is a grating of wood, the cross-bars of which  stand bearing inward, sharp at the end, and pointing inward towards one  another, as the wires of a mouse-trap.    When the tide flows up, the fish can with ease go in between the points  of these cross-bars, but the mill being shut down they can go no farther  upwards; and when the water ebbs again, they are left behind, not being  able to pass the points of the grating, as above, outwards; which, like a  mouse-trap, keeps them in, so that they are left at the bottom with about  a foot or a foot and a half of water.  We were carried hither at low  water, where we saw about fifty or sixty small salmon, about seventeen to  twenty inches long, which the country people call salmon-peal; and to  catch these the person who went with us, who was our landlord at a great  inn next the bridge, put in a net on a hoop at the end of a pole, the  pole going cross the hoop (which we call in this country a shove-net).  The net being fixed at one end of the place, they put in a dog (who was  taught his trade beforehand) at the other end of the place, and he drives  all the fish into the net; so that, only holding the net still in its  place, the man took up two or three and thirty salmon-peal at the first  time.    Of these we took six for our dinner, for which they asked a shilling  (viz., twopence a-piece); and for such fish, not at all bigger, and not  so fresh, I have seen six-and-sixpence each given at a London  fish-market, whither they are sometimes brought from Chichester by land  carriage.    This excessive plenty of so good fish (and other provisions being  likewise very cheap in proportion) makes the town of Totnes a very good  place to live in; especially for such as have large families and but  small estates.  And many such are said to come into those parts on  purpose for saving money, and to live in proportion to their income.    From hence we went still south about seven miles (all in view of this  river) to Dartmouth, a town of note, seated at the mouth of the River  Dart, and where it enters into the sea at a very narrow but safe  entrance.  The opening into Dartmouth Harbour is not broad, but the  channel deep enough for the biggest ship in the Royal Navy.  The sides of  the entrance are high-mounded with rocks, without which, just at the  first narrowing of the passage, stands a good strong fort without a  platform of guns, which commands the port.    The narrow entrance is not much above half a mile, when it opens and  makes a basin or harbour able to receive 500 sail of ships of any size,  and where they may ride with the greatest safety, even as in a mill-pond  or wet dock.  I had the curiosity here, with the assistance of a merchant  of the town, to go out to the mouth of the haven in a boat to see the  entrance, and castle or fort that commands it; and coming back with the  tide of flood, I observed some small fish to skip and play upon the  surface of the water, upon which I asked my friend what fish they were.  Immediately one of the rowers or seamen starts up in the boat, and,  throwing his arms abroad as if he had been bewitched, cries out as loud  as he could bawl, \"A school! a school!\"  The word was taken to the shore  as hastily as it would have been on land if he had cried \"Fire!\"  And by  that time we reached the quays the town was all in a kind of an uproar.    The matter was that a great shoal--or, as they call it, a \"school\"--of  pilchards came swimming with the tide of flood, directly out of the sea  into the harbour.  My friend whose boat we were in told me this was a  surprise which he would have been very glad of if he could but have had a  day or two's warning, for he might have taken 200 tons of them.  And the  like was the case of other merchants in town; for, in short, nobody was  ready for them, except a small fishing-boat or two--one of which went out  into the middle of the harbour, and at two or three hauls took about  forty thousand of them.  We sent our servant to the quay to buy some, who  for a halfpenny brought us seventeen, and, if he would have taken them,  might have had as many more for the same money.  With these we went to  dinner; the cook at the inn broiled them for us, which is their way of  dressing them, with pepper and salt, which cost us about a farthing; so  that two of us and a servant dined--and at a tavern, too--for three  farthings, dressing and all.  And this is the reason of telling the tale.  What drink--wine or beer--we had I do not remember; but, whatever it was,  that we paid for by itself.  But for our food we really dined for three  farthings, and very well, too.  Our friend treated us the next day with a  dish of large lobsters, and I being curious to know the value of such  things, and having freedom enough with him to inquire, I found that for  6d. or 8d. they bought as good lobsters there as would have cost in  London 3s. to 3s. 6d. each.    In observing the coming in of those pilchards, as above, we found that  out at sea, in the offing, beyond the mouth of the harbour, there was a  whole army of porpoises, which, as they told us, pursued the pilchards,  and, it is probable, drove them into the harbour, as above.  The school,  it seems, drove up the river a great way, even as high as Totnes Bridge,  as we heard afterwards; so that the country people who had boats and nets  catched as many as they knew what to do with, and perhaps lived upon  pilchards for several days.  But as to the merchants and trade, their  coming was so sudden that it was no advantage to them.    Round the west side of this basin or harbour, in a kind of a semicircle,  lies the town of Dartmouth, a very large and populous town, though but  meanly built, and standing on the side of a steep hill; yet the quay is  large, and the street before it spacious.  Here are some very flourishing  merchants, who trade very prosperously, and to the most considerable  trading ports of Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the Plantations; but  especially they are great traders to Newfoundland, and from thence to  Spain and Italy, with fish; and they drive a good trade also in their own  fishery of pilchards, which is hereabouts carried on with the greatest  number of vessels of any port in the west, except Falmouth.    A little to the southward of this town, and to the east of the port, is  Tor Bay, of which I know nothing proper to my observation, more than that  it is a very good road for ships, though sometimes (especially with a  southerly or south-east wind) ships have been obliged to quit the bay and  put out to sea, or run into Dartmouth for shelter.    I suppose I need not mention that they had from the hilly part of this  town, and especially from the hills opposite to it, the noble prospect,  and at that time particularly delightful, of the Prince of Orange's fleet  when he came to that coast, and as they entered into Tor Bay to land--the  Prince and his army being in a fleet of about 600 sail of transport  ships, besides 50 sail of men-of-war of the line, all which, with a fair  wind and fine weather, came to an anchor there at once.    This town, as most of the towns of Devonshire are, is full of Dissenters,  and a very large meeting-house they have here.  How they act here with  respect to the great dispute about the doctrine of the Trinity, which has  caused such a breach among those people at Exeter and other parts of the  county, I cannot give any account of.  This town sends two members to  Parliament.    From hence we went to Plympton, a poor and thinly-inhabited town, though  blessed with the like privilege of sending members to the Parliament, of  which I"]]]
