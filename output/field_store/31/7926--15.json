Nature gives to each the soil that suits it, and uses her  diligence to prevent any of them dying, so long as it is possible for  them to continue alive. Why do they all draw their nourishment from  roots as from a mouth dipped into the earth, and distribute the strong  bark over the pith? Why are all the softer parts like the pith deeply  encased within, while the external parts have the strong texture of  wood, and outside of all is the bark to resist the weather's  inclemency, like a champion stout in endurance? Again, how great is  nature's diligence to secure universal propagation by multiplying seed!  Who does not know all these to be contrivances, not only for the present  maintenance of a species, but for its lasting continuance, generation  after generation, for ever? And do not also the things believed  inanimate on like grounds of reason seek each what is proper to itself?  Why do the flames shoot lightly upward, while the earth presses downward  with its weight, if it is not that these motions and situations are  suitable to their respective natures? Moreover, each several thing is  preserved by that which is agreeable to its nature, even as it is  destroyed by things inimical. Things solid like stones resist  disintegration by the close adhesion of their parts. Things fluid like  air and water yield easily to what divides them, but swiftly flow back  and mingle with those parts from which they have been severed, while  fire, again, refuses to be cut at all. And we are not now treating of  the voluntary motions of an intelligent soul, but of the drift of  nature. Even so is it that we digest our food without thinking about it,  and draw our breath unconsciously in sleep; nay, even in living  creatures the love of life cometh not of conscious will, but from the  principles of nature. For oftentimes in the stress of circumstances will  chooses the death which nature shrinks from; and contrarily, in spite of  natural appetite, will restrains that work of reproduction by which  alone the persistence of perishable creatures is maintained. So entirely  does this love of self come from drift of nature, not from animal  impulse. Providence has furnished things with this most cogent reason  for continuance: they must desire life, so long as it is naturally  possible for them to continue living. Wherefore in no way mayst thou  doubt but that things naturally aim at continuance of existence, and  shun destruction.'    'I confess,' said I, 'that what I lately thought uncertain, I now  perceive to be indubitably clear.'    'Now, that which seeks to subsist and continue desires to be one; for if  its oneness be gone, its very existence cannot continue.'    'True,' said I.    'All things, then, desire to be one.'    'I agree.'    'But we have proved that one is the very same thing as good.'    'We have.'    'All things, then, seek the good; indeed, you may express the fact by  defining good as that which all desire.'    'Nothing could be more truly thought out. Either there is no single end  to which all things are relative, or else the end to which all things  universally hasten must be the highest good of all.'    Then she: 'Exceedingly do I rejoice, dear pupil; thine eye is now fixed  on the very central mark of truth. Moreover, herein is revealed that of  which thou didst erstwhile profess thyself ignorant.'    'What is that?' said I.    'The end and aim of the whole universe. Surely it is that which is  desired of all; and, since we have concluded the good to be such, we  ought to acknowledge the end and aim of the whole universe to be \"the  good.\"'        SONG XI.    REMINISCENCE.[J]          Who truth pursues, who from false ways        His heedful steps would keep,      By inward light must search within        In meditation deep;      All outward bent he must repress      His soul's true treasure to possess.        Then all that error's mists obscured        Shall shine more clear than light,      This fleshly frame's oblivious weight        Hath quenched not reason quite;      The germs of truth still lie within,      Whence we by learning all may win.        Else how could ye the answer due        Untaught to questions give,      Were't not that deep within the soul        Truth's secret sparks do live?      If Plato's teaching erreth not,      We learn but that we have forgot.      FOOTNOTES:    [J] The doctrine of Reminiscence--_i.e._, that all learning is really  recollection--is set forth at length by Plato in the 'Meno,' 81-86, and  the 'Phaedo,' 72-76. See Jowett, vol. ii., pp. 40-47 and 213-218.        XII.      Then said I: 'With all my heart I agree with Plato; indeed, this is now  the second time that these things have been brought back to my  mind--first I lost them through the clogging contact of the body; then  after through the stress of heavy grief.'    Then she continued: 'If thou wilt reflect upon thy former admissions, it  will not be long before thou dost also recollect that of which erstwhile  thou didst confess thyself ignorant.'    'What is that?' said I.    'The principles of the world's government,' said she.    'Yes; I remember my confession, and, although I now anticipate what thou  intendest, I have a desire to hear the argument plainly set forth.'    'Awhile ago thou deemedst it beyond all doubt that God doth govern the  world.'    'I do not think it doubtful now, nor shall I ever; and by what reasons  I am brought to this assurance I will briefly set forth. This world  could never have taken shape as a single system out of parts so diverse  and opposite were it not that there is One who joins together these so  diverse things. And when it had once come together, the very diversity  of natures would have dissevered it and torn it asunder in universal  discord were there not One who keeps together what He has joined. Nor  would the order of nature proceed so regularly, nor could its course  exhibit motions so fixed in respect of position, time, range, efficacy,  and character, unless there were One who, Himself abiding, disposed  these various vicissitudes of change. This power, whatsoever it be,  whereby they remain as they were created, and are kept in motion, I call  by the name which all recognise--God.'    Then said she: 'Seeing that such is thy belief, it will cost me little  trouble, I think, to enable thee to win happiness, and return in safety  to thy own country. But let us give our attention to the task that we  have set before ourselves. Have we not counted independence in the  category of happiness, and agreed that God is absolute happiness?'    'Truly, we have.'    'Then, He will need no external assistance for the ruling of the world.  Otherwise, if He stands in need of aught, He will not possess complete  independence.'    'That is necessarily so,' said I.    'Then, by His own power alone He disposes all things.'    'It cannot be denied.'    'Now, God was proved to be absolute good.'    'Yes; I remember.'    'Then, He disposes all things by the agency of good, if it be true that  _He_ rules all things by His own power whom we have agreed to be good;  and He is, as it were, the rudder and helm by which the world's  mechanism is kept steady and in order.'    'Heartily do I agree; and, indeed, I anticipated what thou wouldst say,  though it may be in feeble surmise only.'    'I well believe it,' said she; 'for, as I think, thou now bringest to  the search eyes quicker in discerning truth; but what I shall say next  is no less plain and easy to see.'    'What is it?' said I.    'Why,' said she, 'since God is rightly believed to govern all things  with the rudder of goodness, and since all things do likewise, as I have  taught, haste towards good by the very aim of nature, can it be doubted  that His governance is willingly accepted, and that all submit  themselves to the sway of the Disposer as conformed and attempered to  His rule?'    'Necessarily so,' said I; 'no rule would seem happy if it were a yoke  imposed on reluctant wills, and not the safe-keeping of obedient  subjects.'    'There is nothing, then, which, while it follows nature, endeavours to  resist good.'    'No; nothing.'    'But if anything should, will it have the least success against Him whom  we rightly agreed to be supreme Lord of happiness?'    'It would be utterly impotent.'    'There is nothing, then, which has either the will or the power to  oppose this supreme good.'    'No; I think not.'    'So, then,' said she, 'it is the supreme good which rules in strength,  and graciously disposes all things.'    Then said I: 'How delighted am I at thy reasonings, and the conclusion  to which thou hast brought them, but most of all at these very words  which thou usest! I am now at last ashamed of the folly that so sorely  vexed me.'    'Thou hast heard the story of the giants assailing heaven; but a  beneficent strength disposed of them also, as they deserved. But shall  we submit our arguments to the shock of mutual collision?--it may be  from the impact some fair spark of truth may be struck out.'    'If it be thy good pleasure,' said I.    'No one can doubt that God is all-powerful.'    'No one at all can question it who thinks consistently.'    'Now, there is nothing which One who is all-powerful cannot do.'    'Nothing.'    'But can God do evil, then?'    'Nay; by no means.'    'Then, evil is nothing,' said she, 'since He to whom nothing is  impossible is unable to do evil.'    'Art thou mocking me,' said I, 'weaving a labyrinth of tangled  arguments, now seeming to begin where thou didst end, and now to end  where thou didst begin, or dost thou build up some wondrous circle of  Divine simplicity? For, truly, a little before thou didst begin with  happiness, and say it was the supreme good, and didst declare it to be  seated in the supreme Godhead. God Himself, too, thou didst affirm to be  supreme good and all-complete happiness; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14339"],[0,"Music Talks with Children (#15)"],[1,"was given more room--he  was liberated.    Just because the seed of a beautiful thing came to life in his tiny  world he found love for it and a new life, a care, _something outside  of himself_. And it brought him all.    That love which is not given to self reveals the beauty of the world.          CHAPTER XXII.    IN SCHOOL.        \"Every successive generation becomes a living memorial of our public    schools, and a living example of their excellence.\"--_Joseph Story._    In these days we learn many things in our schools--even music. They  surely must have a purpose, all the studies and the music as well. Let  us in this Talk see if we can find what the purpose is.    It costs our Government a great deal to educate the children of the  land. There are now nearly twenty million children in our country.  That is a number you cannot conceive. But every morning of the year,  when it is not a vacation day, you may think of this vast number  leaving home and going to school to be taught. I am sure the picture  will make us all think how wise a Government is that devotes so much  to making us know more, because by learning more we are able to enjoy  more, to do more, to be more. And this makes us better citizens.    Year after year, as men study and learn about what is best to have  children taught in school, the clearer it becomes that what is given  is dictated because of its usefulness. Arithmetic teaches us to  calculate our daily affairs. Grammar teaches us to listen and to speak  understandingly. Penmanship and Spelling teach us properly to make the  signs which represent speech. Geography teaches us of the earth on  which we live, and how we may travel about it. History teaches us how  to understand the doings of our own day and makes us acquainted with  great men of former times, who by striving have earned a place in our  remembrance.    As we go on in our school education, taking up new studies, we find to  a still greater degree that what we learn is for usefulness.  Arithmetic becomes mathematics in general. Grammar is brought before  us in other languages, and branches out into the study of Rhetoric and  Literature. History is taught us of many lands, particularly of  Greece, Rome, and England. And, bit by bit, these various histories  merge into one, until, perhaps not until college years or later, the  doings of the countries in all the centuries of which we have  knowledge is one unbroken story to us. We know the names of lands and  of people. Why Greece could love art, why Rome could have conquest;  why these countries and all their glories passed away to give place to  others; all these things become clear to us. We learn of generals,  statesmen, poets, musicians, rulers. Their characters are made clear;  their lives are given to us in biography, and year after year the  story of the earth and man is more complete, more fascinating, more  helpful to us in learning our own day.    Then, besides all these studies, we are taught to do things with the  hands. After the Talks we have already had about doing, we know what  it means to have training of the hands. It really means the training  of the thoughts. We are training the mind to make the hands perform  their tasks rightly. It is the same in the science lesson which  teaches us to see; actually to use our eyes until we see things. That  may not seem to be a difficult task, but there are really very few  people who can accurately and properly use their eyes. If there were  more, fewer mistakes would be made.    Thus we can see that school work divides its tasks into two general  classes:    First, the learning of facts.    Second, the actual doing of things.    You will readily see that to do things properly is possible only when  we know facts which tell us how to do them. That shows you at once the  wisdom of the education you receive.    Now, let us imagine that school life is over. For many years you have  gone faithfully every day to your place, you have done your tasks as  honestly as you could, and said your lessons, being wounded no doubt  by failures, but gladdened again by successes. Now, when it is all  over, what is there of it?    Well, above all things, there is one truth of it which it is wonderful  people do not think of more frequently. And that truth is this: The  only education we may use in our own life is that which we have  ourselves. No longer have we help of companions or teachers. We depend  entirely upon our own personal knowledge. If we speak it is our own  knowledge of Grammar that is used. We cannot have a book at hand in  order to know from it the words we should use. If we make a  calculation about money, or do anything with numbers, it must be done  from our knowledge of Arithmetic, and it must be right or people will  very soon cease to deal with us. Then, if we have a letter from a  friend, we must of ourselves know how to read it, and if we have aught  to say to another at a distance, we must be able clearly to express  ourselves in writing, so that we may make no mistake in our meaning.    And this, likewise, is to be said of all the rest. Our knowledge of  History, of Geography, of men of past times, of the boundaries of  countries, of cities, of people, of everything, must come from  ourselves. And, further yet, according as we have been careful to see  in the right way and to do in the right way while we were under  instruction in school, so we shall be likely to see and to do when we  are not in school, and no longer have some one over us who will kindly  and patiently correct our errors, teach us new ways, and give us  greater powers. We may, of course, go on learning after our school  days are ended; and really much of the best education comes then, if  we will immediately set about correcting the faults which we find in  ourselves.    Indeed, many men have gained the best part of their education after  leaving school, where, perhaps, it was their fortune to stay but a  short time.[67] But we must remember that the habits of learning,  doing, seeking, are gained in early years, and if they are not gained  then they rarely come.    Now, what have we learned about schools and school-tasks? We have  learned a little of the purpose which lies in the education we  receive; that out of it must come the power to do and to know; that is  our own power; not that of any one else. We have seen the usefulness  of school-studies, and how practical they are in our daily life.    In all this Talk we have said nothing about Music. If, however, we  understand what the other studies mean, what their purpose is, we  shall learn something which shall be valuable when we come to study  the meaning and purpose of music in schools. That shall be our next  Talk.            CHAPTER XXIII.    MUSIC IN SCHOOL.        \"Become in early years well-informed concerning the extent of the    four voices.    \"Try, even with a poor voice, to sing at sight without the aid of an  instrument; from that your ear will constantly improve. In case,  however, that you have a good voice, do not hesitate a moment to  cultivate it; and believe, at the same time, that heaven has granted  you a valuable gift.\"--_Robert Schumann._[68]    In the previous Talk we learned two very important facts about school  studies. They were these:       I. They are useful.      II. They are useful in proportion to our own (not to anybody else's)        real knowledge of them.    We do not study useless subjects, and it is not from our books, nor  from our teacher that we go through life, making our way. In other  words, the harder we work, the more independent we become; and the  more independent we become, the more power we have to help others.    Now, whatever is true about other school studies is likewise true  about music. It is given to children in school because it is useful,  and because a child can gain power by learning it. Let us see about  this.    To one who does not think deeply, it might seem that if any study in  school is merely ornamental, that study is music. He might say that  all the other studies tend to some practical end in life and business:  that one could not add, nor read, nor transact business, nor write a  letter any more correctly by knowing music. It is only an unthinking  person--_none other_--who would say that.    Of the usefulness of all the school studies we have spoken. We need  only to take a few steps along the pleasant road, about which we have  had so many Talks, and we shall see how much music means in life. To  us it is already plain. Music is a new world, to enter which  cultivates new senses, teaches us to love the beautiful, and makes us  watchful of two of the most important things in life: the thoughts and  the heart. We must have exact thoughts or the music is not made  aright, and the heart may be what it will, music tells all about it.  Therefore, let it be good.    But music in school brings us to daily tasks in tone. What do we  learn? After the difficulties of reading the notes and making the  voice responsive are somewhat overcome, we study for greater power in  both, the one-, two-, or three-part exercises and songs; the exercises  for skill and the songs to apply the skill, and make us acquainted  with the music of great masters.    In one Talk, one of the first, we spoke of the major scale. It has  eight tones only, and though it has existed for many hundreds of  years, no one has yet dreamed of all the wonderful tone-pictures which  are contained in it. It is out of it that all the great composers have  written their works, and for centuries to come men will find in it  beauties great, and pure, and lasting.    As we sing in school, we are learning to put the major scale to some  use. It calls upon us in the melodies which it expresses, to be  careful that each tone shall be right in length, in pitch, in  loudness, in place. We must sing exactly with the others, not  offensively loud, nor so softly as"]]]
