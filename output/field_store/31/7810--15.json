And after the town of Saubha had fallen, the discus came  back into my hands. And taking it up I once more hurled it with force  saying, \"_Go thou unto Salwa_.\" The discus then cleft Salwa in twain who  in that fierce conflict was at the point of hurling a heavy mace. And  with its energy it set the foe ablaze. And after that brave warrior was  slain, the disheartened Danava women fled in all directions, exclaiming  _Oh!_ and _Alas!_ And taking my chariot in front of the town of Saubha I  cheerfully blew my conch and gladdened the hearts of my friends. And  beholding their town, high as the peak of the Meru, with its palaces and  gate-ways utterly destroyed, and all ablaze, the Danavas fled in fear.  And having thus destroyed the town of Saubha and slain Salwa, I returned  to the Anarttas and delighted my friends. And, O king, it is for this  reason that I could not come to the city named after the elephant  (Hastinapura), O destroyer of hostile heroes! O warrior, if I had come,  Suyodhana would not have been alive or the match at dice would not have  taken place. What can I do now? It is difficult to confine the waters  after the dam is broken!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having addressed the Kaurava thus, that  foremost of male persons, of mighty arms, the slayer of Madhu, possessed  of every grace, saluting the Pandavas, prepared for departure. And the  mighty-armed hero reverentially saluted Yudhishthira the just, and the  king in return and Bhima also smelt the crown of his head. And he was  embraced by Arjuna, and the twins saluted him with reverence. And he was  duly honoured by Dhaumya, and worshipped with tears by Draupadi. And  causing Subhadra and Abhimanyu to ascend his golden car, Krishna mounted  it himself, worshipped by the Pandavas. And consoling Yudhishthira,  Krishna set out for Dwaraka on his car resplendent as the sun and unto  which were yoked the horses _Saivya_ and _Sugriva_. And after he of the  Dasharha race had departed, Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Prishata, also set  out for his own city, taking with him the sons of Draupadi. And the king  of Chedi, Dhrishtaketu also, taking his sister with him set out for his  beautiful city of Suktimati, after bidding farewell to the Pandavas.  And, O Bharata, the Kaikeyas also, with the permission of Kunti's son  possessed of immeasurable energy, having reverentially saluted all the  Pandavas, went away. But Brahmanas and the Vaisyas and the dwellers of  Yudhishthira's kingdom though repeatedly requested to go, did not leave  the Pandavas. O foremost of kings, O bull of the Bharata race, the  multitude that surrounded those high-souled ones in the forest of  Kamyaka looked extraordinary. And Yudhishthira, honouring those  high-minded Brahmanas, in due time ordered his men, saying '_Make ready  the car_.'\"      SECTION XXIII    Vaisampayana continued, \"After the chief of the Dasharhas had departed,  the heroic Yudhishthira, and Bhima, and Arjuna, and the twins, each  looking like unto Shiva, and Krishna, and their priest, ascending costly  cars unto which were yoked excellent steeds, together went into the  forest. And at time of going they distributed _Nishkas_ of gold and  clothes and kine unto Brahmanas versed in _Siksha_ and _Akshara_ and  _mantras_. And twenty attendants followed them equipped with bows, and  bowstrings, and blazing weapons, and shafts and arrows and engines of  destruction. And taking the princess's clothes and the ornaments, and  the nurses and the maid-servants, Indrasena speedily followed the  princes on a car. And then approaching the best of Kurus, the  high-minded citizens walked round him. And the principal Brahmanas of  Kurujangala cheerfully saluted him. And together with his brothers,  Yudhishthira the just, on his part saluted them cheerfully. And the  illustrious king stopped there a little, beholding the concourse of the  inhabitants of Kurujangala. And the illustrious bull among the Kurus  felt for them as a father feeleth for his sons, and they too felt for  the Kuru chief even as sons feel for their father! And that mighty  concourse, approaching the Kuru hero, stood around him. And, O king,  affected, with bashfulness, and with tears in their eyes, they all  exclaimed, 'Alas, O lord! O Dharma!' And they said, 'Thou art the chief  of the Kurus, and the king of us, thy subjects! Where dost thou go, O  just monarch, leaving all these citizens and the inhabitants of the  country, like a father leaving his sons? Fie on the cruel-hearted son of  Dhritarashtra! Fie on the evil-minded son of Suvala! Fie on Karna! For,  O foremost of monarchs, those wretches ever wish unto thee who art firm  in virtue! Having thyself established the unrivalled city of  Indraprastha of the splendour of Kailasa itself, where dost thou go,  leaving it, O illustrious and just king, O achiever of extraordinary  deeds! O illustrious one, leaving that peerless palace built by Maya,  which possesseth the splendour of the palace of the celestials  themselves, and is like unto a celestial illusion, ever guarded by the  gods, where dost thou go, O son of Dharma?' And Vibhatsu knowing the  ways of virtue, pleasure, and profit said unto them in a loud voice,  'Living in the forest, the king intendeth to take away the good name of  his enemies! O ye with the regenerate ones at your head, versed in  virtue and profit, do you approaching the ascetics separately and  inclining them to grace, represent unto them what may be for our supreme  good!' Upon hearing these words of Arjuna, the Brahmanas and the other  orders, O king, saluting him cheerfully walked round the foremost of  virtuous men! And bidding farewell unto the son of Pritha, and  Vrikodara, and Dhananjaya and Yajnaseni, and the twins, and commanded by  Yudhishthira, they returned to their respective abodes in the kingdom  with heavy hearts.\"      SECTION XXIV    Vaisampayana said, \"After they had departed, Yudhishthira the virtuous  son of Kunti, unwavering in his promises, addressed all his brothers,  saying, 'We shall have to dwell in the solitary forest for these twelve  years. Search ye, therefore, in this mighty forest for some spot  abounding in birds and deer and flowers and fruits, beautiful to behold,  and auspicious, and inhabited by virtuous persons and where we may dwell  pleasantly for all these years!' Thus addressed by Yudhishthira,  Dhananjaya replied unto the son of Dharma, after reverencing the  illustrious king as if he were his spiritual preceptor. And Arjuna said,  'Thou hast respectfully waited upon all the great and old _Rishis_.  There is nothing unknown to thee in the world of men. And O bull of the  Bharata race, thou hast always waited with reverence upon Brahmanas  including Dwaipayana and others, and Narada of great ascetic merit, who  with senses under control, ever goeth to the gates of all the world from  the world of the gods unto that of Brahma, including that of the  Gandharvas and Apsaras! And thou knowest, without doubt, the opinions of  the Brahmanas, and, O king, their prowess also! And O monarch, thou  knowest what is calculated to do us good! And O great king, we will live  wherever thou likest! Here is this lake, full of sacred water, called  _Dwaitavana_, abounding with flowers, and delightful to look at, and  inhabited by many species of birds. If, O king, it pleaseth thee, here  should we like to dwell these twelve years! Thinkest thou otherwise?'  Yudhishthira replied, 'O Partha, what thou hast said recommendeth itself  to me! Let us go that sacred and celebrated and large lake called  _Dwaitavana_!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Then the virtuous son of Pandu, accompanied by  numerous Brahmanas, all went to the sacred lake called _Dwaitavana_. And  Yudhishthira was surrounded by numerous Brahmanas some of whom  sacrificed with fire and some without it and some of whom, devoted to  the study of the Vedas, lived upon alms or were of the class called  _Vanaprasthas_. And the king was also surrounded by hundreds of  _Mahatmas_ crowned with ascetic success and of rigid vows. And those  bulls of the Bharata race, the sons of Pandu setting out with those  numerous Brahmanas, entered the sacred and delightful woods of _Dwaita_.  And the king saw that mighty forest covered on the close of summer with  _Salas_, and palms, and mangoes, and _Madhukas_, and _Nipas_ and  _Kadamvas_ and _Sarjjas_ and _Arjunas_, and _Karnikars_, many of them  covered with flowers. And flocks of peacocks and _Datyuhas_ and  _Chakoras_ and _Varhins_ and _Kokilas_, seated on the tops of the  tallest trees of that forest were pouring forth their mellifluous notes.  And the king also saw in that forest mighty herds of gigantic elephants  huge as the hills, with temporal juice trickling down in the season of  rut, accompanied by herds of she-elephants. And approaching the  beautiful Bhogavati (Saraswati), the king saw many ascetics crowned with  success in the habitations in that forest, and virtuous men of  sanctified souls clad in barks of trees and bearing matted locks on  their heads. And descending from their cars, the king that foremost of  virtuous men with his brothers and followers entered that forest like  Indra of immeasurable energy entering heaven. And crowds of _Charanas_  and _Siddhas_, desirous of beholding the monarch devoted to truth, came  towards him. And the dwellers of that forest stood surrounding that lion  among kings possessed of great intelligence. And saluting all the  _Siddhas_, and saluted by them in return as a king or a god should be,  that foremost of virtuous men entered the forest with joined hands  accompanied by all those foremost of regenerate ones. And the  illustrious and virtuous king, saluted in return by those virtuous  ascetics that had approached him, sat down in their midst at the foot of  a mighty tree decked with flowers, like his father (Pandu) in days  before. And those chiefs of the Bharata race _viz_., Bhima and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11924"],[0,"The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry (#15)"],[1,"person chosen to receive the first present was Krishna  himself. The _Purana_ changes this by substituting gods for guests.  Yudhisthira is uncertain who should be worshipped first. 'Who is the great  lord of the gods,' he asks, 'to whom we should bow our heads?' To this a  Pandava gives a clear answer. Krishna, he says, is god of gods. 'No one  understands his nature. He is lord of Brahma, Siva and Indra. It is he who  creates, preserves and destroys. His work is endless. He is the unseen and  imperishable. He descends upon the earth continually for the sake of his  worshippers and assuming mortal form appears and acts like a mortal. He  sits in our houses and calls us 'brothers.' We are deluded by his power  and consider him a brother. Yet never have we seen one as great as him.'  He speaks in fact as one who, knowing Krishna, has seen, for the moment,  the god beyond the man. His vision is shared by the others present.  Krishna is therefore placed on a throne and before the vast concourse of  rajas, Yudhisthira worships him.    Among the guests, however, is one raja to whom the vision is denied. He is  Sisupala, Krishna's rival for the hand of Rukmini, and since Rukmini's  abduction, his deadly enemy. Krishna's elevation as a god is more than he  can stomach and he utters an angry protest. Krishna, he says, is not god  at all. He is a mere cowherd's son of low caste who has debased himself by  eating the leavings of the cowherds' children and has even been the lover  of the cowgirls. As a child he was an arrant pilferer, stealing milk and  butter from every house, while as a youth he has trifled with other men's  wives. He has also slighted Indra. Krishna quietly listens to this  outburst. Then, deeming Sisupala's enmity to have reached its furthest  limit, he allows his patience to be exhausted. He reaches for his quoit  and hurling it through the air, slays Sisupala on the spot. The ceremonies  are then completed and Krishna leaves for Dwarka. As he nears the city, he  discovers the Yadavas hard pressed by an army of demons. He and Balarama  intervene. The demons are either killed or put to flight and the Yadavas  are rescued. When a little later Sisupala's two brothers bring an army  against him, they too are vanquished.    Twelve years now intervene. Yudhisthira in the moment of triumph has  gambled away his kingdom. The Pandavas have once again been driven into  exile and the old feud has broken out afresh. As the exile ends, both  sides prepare for war and Krishna also leaves for the battle. Balarama is  loath to intervene so goes away on pilgrimage. After various adventures,  however, he also arrives on the scene. As he comes, a series of  single-handed combats is in progress with Krishna and other Rajas looking  on. Duryodhana, the son of blind Dhritarashtra, the king of the Kauravas  is fighting Bhima, the powerful Pandava and just as Balarama arrives he is  dealt a foul blow and wounded in the thigh. Balarama is shocked to see so  many uncles and cousins involved in strife and begs them to desist.  Duryodhana replies that it is Krishna who has willed the war and that they  are as puppets in his hands. It is Krishna who is actively aiding the  Pandavas and the war is only being carried on because of his advice. It is  Krishna also who has sponsored foul play. Balarama is pained at such  accusations and strongly criticizes Krishna. Krishna, however, is ready  with an answer. The Kauravas, he says, cheated the Pandavas of their  kingdom by the game of dice. Duryodhana had told Draupadi to sit on his  thigh and so he deserved to have it broken. So unjust and tyrannical are  the Kauravas that any methods used against them are fair. Balarama keeps  silent and a little later returns to Dwarka.    This incident concludes the _Purana's_ references to the war. Nothing is  said of Krishna's sermon--the _Bhagavad Gita_. No mention is made of  Krishna's role as charioteer to Arjuna. Nothing further is said of its  deadly outcome. Krishna's career as a warrior, in fact, is ended and with  this episode the _Purana_ enters its final phase.    As Krishna lives at Dwarka, surrounded by his wives and huge progeny, he  wearies of his earthly career. By now his mission has been accomplished.  Hordes of demons have been slain, cruel monarchs killed and much of  Earth's burden lifted. There is no longer any pressing need for him to  stay and he decides to quit his body and 're-enter with all his emanations  the sphere of Vishnu.' To do this, however, the whole of the Yadava race  must first be ended.[41] One, day some Yadava boys make fun of certain  Brahmans. They dress up one of their company as a pregnant girl, take him  to the Brahmans and innocently inquire what kind of child the woman will  bring forth. The Brahmans immediately penetrate the disguise and angered  at the youth's impertinence, they reply, 'A club that will crush the whole  Yadava race.' The boys run to King Ugrasena, relate what has happened and  are even more alarmed when an iron club is brought forth from the boy's  belly. Ugrasena has the club ground to dust and thrown into the sea, where  its particles become rushes. One part of the club, however, is like a  lance and does not break. When thrown into the sea, it is swallowed by a  fish. A hunter catches it and taking the iron spike from its stomach lays  it aside for future use. It is an arrow made from this particular spike  which a little later will bring about Krishna's death. Similarly it is the  iron rushes which will cause the death of the Yadavas. Already, therefore,  a chain of sinister happenings has been started and from now onwards the  action moves relentlessly to its grim and tragic close.    As the final scene unfolds, the gods, headed by Brahma and Siva, approach  Krishna begging him to return. Krishna tells them that everything is now  in train and within seven nights he will complete the destruction of the  Yadavas and return to his everlasting home.    Signs portending the destruction of Dwarka now appear. 'A dreadful figure,  death personified, haunts every house, coming and going no one knows how  and being invulnerable to weapons by which he is assailed. Strong  hurricanes blow; large rats multiply and infest the roads and houses and  attack persons in their sleep; starlings scream in their cages, storks  imitate the hooting of owls and goats the howling of jackals; cows bring  forth foals and camels mules; food in the moment of being eaten is filled  with worms; fire burns with discoloured flames and at sunset and sunrise  the air is traversed by headless and hideous spirits.'[42] Krishna draws  the Yadavas' attention to these omens and advises them to leave Dwarka and  move to Prabhasa, a site farther inland.    Udho, who earlier in the story has acted as Krishna's envoy to the  cowgirls quickly realizes that the end is near and approaches Krishna for  advice. 'Tell me, O Lord, what it is proper I should do. For it is clear  that shortly you will destroy the Yadavas.' Krishna then tells him to go  to a shrine high up in the mountains and by meditating on Krishna obtain  release. He adds minute instructions on the technique of penance and ends  with some definitions of the yoga of devotion. He concludes by telling  Udho that when all the Yadavas have perished, he himself will go to heaven  and Dwarka will be swallowed by the ocean. Udho bows low and leaves for  the mountains.    Krishna now assembles the leading Yadavas and leaving behind only the  elders, the women and children, escorts them to Prabhasa, a town inland,  assuring them that by proper worship they may yet avert their fate. At  Prabhasa the Yadavas bathe and purify themselves, anoint the gods' statues  and make offerings. They appease the Brahmans with costly gifts--'thereby  countering evil omens, gaining the road to happiness and ensuring rebirth  at a higher level.'    Their worship however, is of no avail for almost immediately they fall to  drinking. 'As they drank, the destructive flame of dissension was kindled  amongst them by mutual collision, and fed with the fuel of abuse.  Infuriated by the divine influence, they fell upon one another with  missile weapons and when these were expended, they had recourse to the  rushes growing high. The rushes in their hands became like thunderbolts  and they struck one another with them fatal blows. Krishna interposed to  prevent them but they thought that he was taking part with each severally,  and continued the conflict. Krishna then, enraged, took up a handful of  rushes to destroy them, and the rushes became a club of iron and with this  he slew many of the murderous Yadavas; whilst others, fighting fiercely,  put an end to one another. In a short time, there was not a single Yadava  left alive, except the mighty Krishna and Daruka, his charioteer.'[43]    With the slaughter thus completed, Krishna feels free to leave the earth.  Such Yadavas who have been left behind in Dwarka have been spared, but the  greater part of the race is dead. He therefore makes ready for his own  departure. Balarama, who has helped Krishna in the brawl, goes to the  sea-shore, performs yoga and, leaving his body, joins the Supreme Spirit.  Sesha, the white serpent of eternity, issues from his mouth and hymned by  snakes and other serpents proceeds to the ocean. 'Bringing an offering of  respect, Ocean came to meet him; and then the majestic being, adored by  attendant snakes entered into the waters of the deep.'[44]    Krishna then seats himself by a fig tree, lays his left leg across his  right thigh, turns the sole of his foot outwards and assumes one of the  postures in which abstraction is practised. As he meditates he appears  lovelier than ever. His eyes flash. The four arms of Vishnu spring from  his body. He wears his crown, his sacred thread and garland of flowers. As  he sits, glorious and beautiful, the same hunter, who earlier had salvaged  the iron spike from the "]]]
