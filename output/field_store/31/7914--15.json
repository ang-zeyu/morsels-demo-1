Far from the traditions and methods of  the School, the best of their knowledge and of their talent is due to  their profound and sincere contemplation of nature and to their freedom  of spirit. And for that reason they will have a permanent place in the  evolution of their art.          VIII    THE MODERN ILLUSTRATORS CONNECTED WITH IMPRESSIONISM: RAFFAELLI,  TOULOUSE-LAUTREC, FORAIN, CHERET, ETC.      Not the least important result of Impressionism has been the veritable  revolution effected by it in the art of illustration. It was only  natural that its principles should have led to it. The substitution of  the beauty of character for the beauty of proportion was bound to move  the artists to regard illustration in a new light; and as pictorial  Impressionism was born of the same movement of ideas which created the  naturalist novel and the impressionist literature of Flaubert, Zola and  the Goncourts, and moreover as these men were united by close relations  and a common defence, Edouard Manet's modern ideas soon took up the  commentary of the books dealing with modern life and the description of  actual spectacles.    The Impressionists themselves have not contributed towards illustration.  Their work has consisted in raising to the style of grand painting  subjects, that seemed at the best only worthy of the proportion of  vignettes, in opposition to the subjects qualified as \"noble\" by the  School. The series of works by Manet and Degas may be considered as  admirable illustrations to the novels by Zola and the Goncourts. It is a  parallel research in modern psychologic truth. But this research has  remained confined to pictures. It may be presumed that, had they wished  to do so, Manet and Degas could have admirably illustrated certain  contemporary novels, and Renoir could have produced a masterpiece in  commenting, say, upon Verlaine's _Fetes Galantes_. The only things that  can be mentioned here are a few drawings composed by Manet for Edgar A.  Poe's _The Raven_ and Mallarme's _L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune_, in addition  to a few music covers without any great interest.    But if the Impressionists themselves have neglected actively to assist  the interesting school of modern illustration, a whole legion of  draughtsmen have immediately been inspired by their principles. One of  their most original characteristics was the realistic representation of  the scenes, the _mise en cadre_, and it afforded these draughtsmen an  opportunity for revolutionising book illustration. There had already  been some excellent artists who occupied themselves with vignette  drawings, like Tony Johannot and Celestin Nanteuil, whose pretty and  smart frontispieces are to be found in the old editions of Balzac. The  genius of Honore Daumier and the high fancy of Gavarni and of Grevin had  already announced a serious protest of modern sentiment against academic  taste, in returning on many points to the free tradition of Eisen, of  the two Moreaus and of Debucourt. Since 1845 the draughtsman Constantin  Guys, Baudelaire's friend, gave evidence, in his most animated  water-colour drawings, of a curious vision of nervous elegance and of  expressive skill quite in accord with the ideas of the day.  Impressionism, and also the revelation of the Japanese colour prints,  gave an incredible vigour to these intuitive glimpses. Certain  characteristics will date from the days of Impressionism. It is due to  Impressionism that artists have ventured to show in illustration, for  instance, figures in the foreground cut through by the margin, rising  perspectives, figures in the background that seem to stand on a higher  plane than the others, people seen from a second story; in a word, all  that life presents to our eyes, without the annoying consideration for  \"style\" and for arrangement, which the academic spirit obstinately  insisted to apply to the illustration of modern life. Degas in  particular has given many examples of this novelty in composition. One  of his pastels has remained typical, owing to the scandal caused by it:  he represents a dance-scene at the Opera, seen from the orchestra. The  neck of a double bass rises in the middle of the picture and cuts into  it, a large black silhouette, behind which sparkle the gauze-dresses and  the lights. That can be observed any evening, and yet it would be  difficult to recapitulate all the railleries and all the anger caused by  so natural an audacity. Modern illustration was to be the pretext of a  good many more outbursts!    We must now consider four artists of great importance who are remarkable  painters and have greatly raised the art of illustration. This title  illustrator, despised by the official painters, should be given them as  the one which has secured them the best claim to fame. They have  restored to this title all its merit and all its brilliancy and have  introduced into illustration the most serious qualities of painting. Of  these four men the first in date is M.J.F. Raffaelli, who introduced  himself about 1875 with some remarkable and intensely picturesque  illustrations in colours in various magazines. He gave an admirable  series of _Parisian Types_, in album form, and a series of etchings to  accompany the text of M. Huysmans, describing the curious river \"la  Bievre\" which penetrates Paris in a thousand curves, sometimes  subterranean, sometimes above ground, and serves the tanners for washing  the leather. This series is a model of modern illustration. But, apart  from the book, the entire pictorial work of M. Raffaelli is a humorous  and psychological illustration of the present time. He has painted with  unique truth and spirit the working men's types and the small  _bourgeois_, the poor, the hospital patients and the roamers of the  outskirts of Paris. He has succeeded in being the poet of the sickly and  dirty landscapes by which the capitals are surrounded; he has rendered  their anaemic charm, the confused perspectives of houses, fences, walls  and little gardens, and their smoke, under the melancholy of rainy  skies. With an irony free from bitterness he has noted the clumsy  gestures of the labourer in his Sunday garb and the grotesque  silhouettes of the small townsmen, and has compiled a gallery of very  real sociologic interest. M. Raffaelli has also exhibited Parisian  landscapes in which appear great qualities of light. He excels in  rendering the mornings in the spring, with their pearly skies, their  pale lights, their transparency and their slight shadows, and finally he  has proved his mastery by some large portraits, fresh harmonies,  generally devoted to the study of different qualities of white. If the  name \"Impressionist\" meant, as has been wrongly believed, an artist who  confines himself to giving the impression of what he sees, then M.  Raffaelli would be the real Impressionist. He suggests more than he  paints. He employs a curious technique: he often leaves a sky completely  bare, throwing on to the white of the canvas a few colour notes which  suffice to give the illusion. He has a decided preference for white and  black, and paints very slightly in small touches. His very correct  feeling for values makes him an excellent painter; but what interests  him beyond all, is psychologic expression. He notes it with so hasty a  pencil, that one might almost say that he writes with colour. He is also  an etcher of great merit, and an original sculptor. He has invented  small bas-reliefs in bronze which can be attached to the wall, like  sketches or nick-nacks; and he has applied his talent even to renewing  the material for painting. He is an ingenious artist and a prolific  producer, a roguish, but sympathetic, observer of the life of the small  people, which has not prevented him from painting very seriously when he  wanted to, as is witnessed among other works by his very fine portrait  of M. Clemenceau speaking at a public meeting, in the presence of a  vociferous audience from which rise some hundred of heads whose  expressions are noted with really splendid energy and fervour.    Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who died recently, insane, leaves a great  work behind him. He had a kind of cruel genius. Descended from one of  the greatest families of France, badly treated by nature who made him a  kind of ailing dwarf, he seemed to take a bitter pleasure in the study  of modern vice. He painted scenes at cafe-concerts and the rooms of  wantons with intense truth. Nobody has revealed better than he the  lowness and suffering of the creatures \"of pleasure,\" as they have been  dubbed by the heartrending irony of life. Lautrec has shown the  artificiality of the painted faces; the vulgarity of the types of the  prostitutes of low origin; the infamous gestures, the disorder, the  slovenliness of the dwellings of these women; all the shady side of  their existence. It has been said that he loved ugliness. As a matter of  fact, he did not exaggerate, he raised a powerful accusation against  everything he saw. But his terrible clairvoyance passed for caricature.  This sad psychologist was a great painter; he pleased himself with  dressing in rose-coloured costumes the coarsest and most vulgar  creatures he painted, such as one can find at the cabarets and concerts,  and he enjoyed the contrast of fresh tones with the faces marked by vice  and poverty; Lautrec's two great influences have been the Japanese and  Degas. Of the former he retained the love for decorative arabesques and  the unconventional grouping; of the other the learned draughtsmanship,  expressive in its broad simplification, and one might say that the pupil  has often been worthy of the masters. One can only regret that Lautrec  should have confined his vision and his high faculties to the study of a  small and very Parisian world; but, seeing his works, one cannot deny"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14060"],[0,"Mr. Britling Sees It Through (#15)"],[1,"the way.\"    \"Oh!--we should fight. Of course we should fight. Could any one but a  congenital idiot suppose we shouldn't fight? They know we should fight.  They aren't altogether idiots in Germany. But the thing's absurd. Why  _should_ Germany attack France? It's as if Manning here took a hatchet  suddenly and assailed Edith.... It's just the dream of their military  journalists. It's such schoolboy nonsense. Isn't that a beautiful pillar  rose? Edith only put it in last year.... I hate all this talk of wars  and rumours of wars.... It's worried all my life. And it gets worse and  it gets emptier every year....\"      Section 2    Now just at that moment there was a loud report....    But neither Mr. Britling nor Mr. Manning nor Mr. Direck was interrupted  or incommoded in the slightest degree by that report. Because it was too  far off over the curve of this round world to be either heard or seen at  Matching's Easy. Nevertheless it was a very loud report. It occurred at  an open space by a river that ran through a cramped Oriental city, a  city spiked with white minarets and girt about by bare hills under a  blazing afternoon sky. It came from a black parcel that the Archduke  Francis Ferdinand of Austria, with great presence of mind, had just  flung out from the open hood of his automobile, where, tossed from the  side of the quay, it had descended a few seconds before. It exploded as  it touched the cobbled road just under the front of the second vehicle  in the procession, and it blew to pieces the front of the automobile and  injured the aide-de-camp who was in it and several of the spectators.  Its thrower was immediately gripped by the bystanders. The procession  stopped. There was a tremendous commotion amongst that brightly-costumed  crowd, a hot excitement in vivid contrast to the Sabbath calm of  Matching's Easy....    Mr. Britling, to whom the explosion was altogether inaudible, continued  his dissertation upon the common-sense of the world and the practical  security of our Western peace.      Section 3    Lunch was an open-air feast again. Three visitors had dropped in; they  had motored down from London piled up on a motor-cycle and a side-car; a  brother and two sisters they seemed to be, and they had apparently  reduced hilariousness to a principle. The rumours of coming hockey that  had been floating on the outskirts of Mr. Direck's consciousness ever  since his arrival, thickened and multiplied.... It crept into his mind  that he was expected to play....    He decided he would not play. He took various people into his  confidence. He told Mr. Britling, and Mr. Britling said, \"We'll make you  full back, where you'll get a hit now and then and not have very much to  do. All you have to remember is to hit with the flat side of your stick  and not raise it above your shoulders.\" He told Teddy, and Teddy said,  \"I strongly advise you to dress as thinly as you can consistently with  decency, and put your collar and tie in your pocket before the game  begins. Hockey is properly a winter game.\" He told the maiden aunt-like  lady with the prominent nose, and she said almost enviously, \"Every one  here is asked to play except me. I assuage the perambulator. I suppose  one mustn't be envious. I don't see why I shouldn't play. I'm not so old  as all that.\" He told Hugh, and Hugh warned him to be careful not to get  hold of one of the sprung sticks. He considered whether it wouldn't be  wiser to go to his own room and lock himself in, or stroll off for a  walk through Claverings Park. But then he would miss Miss Corner, who  was certain, it seemed, to come up for hockey. On the other hand, if he  did not miss her he might make himself ridiculous in her eyes, and  efface the effect of the green silk stuff with the golden pheasants.    He determined to stay behind until she arrived, and explain to her that  he was not going to play. He didn't somehow want her to think he wasn't  perfectly fit to play.    Mr. Carmine arrived in an automobile with two Indians and a gentleman  who had been a prospector in Alaska, the family who had danced overnight  at the Dower House reappeared, and then Mrs. Teddy, very detached with a  special hockey stick, and Miss Corner wheeling the perambulator. Then  came further arrivals. At the earliest opportunity Mr. Direck secured  the attention of Miss Corner, and lost his interest in any one else.    \"I can't play this hockey,\" said Mr. Direck. \"I feel strange about it.  It isn't an American game. Now if it were baseball--!\"    He left her to suppose him uncommonly hot stuff at baseball.    \"If you're on my side,\" said Cecily, \"mind you pass to me.\"    It became evident to Mr. Direck that he was going to play this hockey  after all.    \"Well,\" he said, \"if I've got to play hockey, I guess I've got to play  hockey. But can't I just get a bit of practice somewhere before the game  begins?\"    So Miss Corner went off to get two sticks and a ball and came back to  instruct Mr. Direck. She said he had a good eye. The two small boys  scenting play in the air got sticks and joined them. The overnight  visitor's wife appeared from the house in abbreviated skirts, and  wearing formidable shin-guards. With her abundant fair hair, which was  already breaking loose, so to speak, to join the fray, she looked like a  short stout dismounted Valkyr. Her gaze was clear and firm.      Section 4    Hockey as it was played at the Dower House at Matching's Easy before the  war, was a game combining danger, physical exercise and kindliness in a  very high degree. Except for the infant in the perambulator and the  outwardly calm but inwardly resentful aunt, who wheeled the child up and  down in a position of maximum danger just behind the unnetted goal,  every one was involved. Quite able-bodied people acquainted with the  game played forward, the less well-informed played a defensive game  behind the forward line, elderly, infirm, and bulky persons were used  chiefly as obstacles in goal. Several players wore padded leg-guards,  and all players were assumed to have them and expected to behave  accordingly.    Proceedings began with an invidious ceremony called picking up. This was  heralded by Mr. Britling, clad in the diaphanous flannels and bearing a  hockey stick, advancing with loud shouts to the centre of the hockey  field. \"Pick up! Pick up!\" echoed the young Britlings.    Mr. Direck became aware of a tall, drooping man with long hair and long  digressive legs in still longer white flannel trousers, and a face that  was somehow familiar. He was talking with affectionate intimacy to  Manning, and suddenly Mr. Direck remembered that it was in Manning's  weekly paper, _The Sectarian_, in which a bitter caricaturist enlivened  a biting text, that he had become familiar with the features of  Manning's companion. It was Raeburn, Raeburn the insidious, Raeburn the  completest product of the party system.... Well, that was the English  way. \"Come for the pick up!\" cried the youngest Britling, seizing upon  Mr. Direck's elbow. It appeared that Mr. Britling and the overnight  dinner guest--Mr. Direck never learnt his name--were picking up.    Names were shouted. \"I'll take Cecily!\" Mr. Direck heard Mr. Britling  say quite early. The opposing sides as they were picked fell into two  groups. There seemed to be difficulties about some of the names. Mr.  Britling, pointing to the more powerful looking of the Indian gentlemen,  said, \"_You_, Sir.\"    \"I'm going to speculate on Mr. Dinks,\" said Mr. Britling's opponent.    Mr. Direck gathered that Mr. Dinks was to be his hockey name.    \"You're on _our_ side,\" said Mrs. Teddy. \"I think you'll have to play  forward, outer right, and keep a sharp eye on Cissie.\"    \"I'll do what I can,\" said Mr. Direck.    His captain presently confirmed this appointment.    His stick was really a sort of club and the ball was a firm hard cricket  ball.... He resolved to be very gentle with Cecily, and see that she  didn't get hurt.    The sides took their places for the game, and a kind of order became  apparent to Mr. Direck. In the centre stood Mr. Britling and the  opposing captain, and the ball lay between them. They were preparing to  \"bully off\" and start the game. In a line with each of them were four  other forwards. They all looked spirited and intent young people, and  Mr. Direck wished he had had more exercise to justify his own alert  appearance. Behind each centre forward hovered one of the Britling boys.  Then on each side came a vaguer row of three backs, persons of gentler  disposition or maturer years. They included Mr. Raeburn, who was  considered to have great natural abilities for hockey but little  experience. Mr. Raeburn was behind Mr. Direck. Mrs. Britling was the  centre back. Then in a corner of Mr. Direck's side was a small girl of  six or seven, and in the half-circle about the goal a lady in a motoring  dust coat and a very short little man whom Mr. Direck had not previously  remarked. Mr. Lawrence Carmine, stripped to the braces, which were  richly ornamented with Oriental embroidery, kept goal for our team.    The centre forwards went through a rapid little ceremony. They smote  their sticks on the ground, and then hit the sticks together. \"One,\"  said Mr. Britling. The operation was repeated. \"Two,\" ... \"Three.\"    Smack, Mr. Britling had got it and the ball had gone to the shorter and  sturdier of the younger Britlings, who had been standing behind Mr.  Direck's captain. Crack, and it was away to Teddy; smack, and it was  coming right at Direck.    \"Lordy!\" he said, and prepared to smite it.    Then something swift and blue had flashed before him, intercepted the  ball and shot it past him. This was Cecily Corner, and she and Teddy  were running abreast like the wind towards Mr. Raeburn.    \"Hey!\" cried Mr. Raeburn, \"stop!\" and advanced, as it seemed to Mr.  Direck, with unseemly and threatening gestures towards Cissie.    But before Mr."]]]
