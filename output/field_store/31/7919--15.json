The inspector advanced, put out his hand to the little knob, and slid the  hatch along its groove.    Then he took an involuntary step back again.    Framed in the aperture, and falling forward a little before it jammed  again in its frame, was something that resembled a large lumpy pudding,  done up in a pudding-bag of faded browny red frieze.    \"Ah!\" said the inspector.    To close the hatch again he would have had to thrust that pudding back  with his hand; and somehow he did not quite like the idea of touching  it. Instead, he turned the handle of the cupboard itself. There was  weight behind it, so much weight that, after opening the door three or  four inches and peering inside, he had to put his shoulder to it in order  to close it again. In closing it he left sticking out, a few inches from  the floor, a triangle of black and white check skirt.    He went into the small hall.    \"All right!\" he called.    They had got Oleron into his clothes. He still used his hands as  blinkers, and his brain was very confused. A number of things were  happening that he couldn't understand. He couldn't understand the  extraordinary mess of dead flowers there seemed to be everywhere; he  couldn't understand why there should be police officers in his room; he  couldn't understand why one of these should be sent for a four-wheeler  and a stretcher; and he couldn't understand what heavy article they  seemed to be moving about in the kitchen--his kitchen....    \"What's the matter?\" he muttered sleepily....    Then he heard a murmur in the square, and the stopping of a four-wheeler  outside. A police officer was at his elbow again, and Oleron wondered  why, when he whispered something to him, he should run off a string of  words--something about \"used in evidence against you.\" They had lifted  him to his feet, and were assisting him towards the door....    No, Oleron couldn't understand it at all.    They got him down the stairs and along the alley. Oleron was aware of  confused angry shoutings; he gathered that a number of people wanted to  lynch somebody or other. Then his attention became fixed on a little fat  frightened-eyed man who appeared to be making a statement that an officer  was taking down in a notebook.    \"I'd seen her with him ... they was often together ... she came into my  shop and said it was for him ... I thought it was all right ... 111333  the number was,\" the man was saying.    The people seemed to be very angry; many police were keeping them back;  but one of the inspectors had a voice that Oleron thought quite kind and  friendly. He was telling somebody to get somebody else into the cab  before something or other was brought out; and Oleron noticed that a  four-wheeler was drawn up at the gate. It appeared that it was himself  who was to be put into it; and as they lifted him up he saw that the  inspector tried to stand between him and something that stood behind the  cab, but was not quick enough to prevent Oleron seeing that this  something was a hooded stretcher. The angry voices sounded like a sea;  something hard, like a stone, hit the back of the cab; and the inspector  followed Oleron in and stood with his back to the window nearer the side  where the people were. The door they had put Oleron in at remained open,  apparently till the other inspector should come; and through the opening  Oleron had a glimpse of the hatchet-like \"To Let\" boards among the  privet-trees. One of them said that the key was at Number Six....    Suddenly the raging of voices was hushed. Along the entrance-alley  shuffling steps were heard, and the other inspector appeared at the  cab door.    \"Right away,\" he said to the driver.    He entered, fastened the door after him, and blocked up the second window  with his back. Between the two inspectors Oleron slept peacefully. The  cab moved down the square, the other vehicle went up the hill. The  mortuary lay that way.          PHANTAS           _\"For, barring all pother,        With this, or the other,  Still Britons are Lords of the Main._\"      THE CHAPTER OF ADMIRALS      I    As Abel Keeling lay on the galleon's deck, held from rolling down it only  by his own weight and the sun-blackened hand that lay outstretched upon  the planks, his gaze wandered, but ever returned to the bell that hung,  jammed with the dangerous heel-over of the vessel, in the small  ornamental belfry immediately abaft the mainmast. The bell was of cast  bronze, with half-obliterated bosses upon it that had been the heads of  cherubs; but wind and salt spray had given it a thick incrustation of  bright, beautiful, lichenous green. It was this colour that Abel  Keeling's eyes liked.    For wherever else on the galleon his eyes rested they found only  whiteness--the whiteness of extreme eld. There were slightly varying  degrees in her whiteness; here she was of a white that glistened like  salt-granules, there of a greyish chalky white, and again her whiteness  had the yellowish cast of decay; but everywhere it was the mild,  disquieting whiteness of materials out of which the life had departed.  Her cordage was bleached as old straw is bleached, and half her ropes  kept their shape little more firmly than the ash of a string keeps its  shape after the fire has passed; her pallid timbers were white and clean  as bones found in sand; and even the wild frankincense with which (for  lack of tar, at her last touching of land) she had been pitched, had  dried to a pale hard gum that sparkled like quartz in her open seams. The  sun was yet so pale a buckler of silver through the still white mists  that not a cord or timber cast a shadow; and only Abel Keeling's face and  hands were black, carked and cinder-black from exposure to his pitiless  rays.    The galleon was the _Mary of the Tower_, and she had a frightful list to  starboard. So canted was she that her mainyard dipped one of its steel  sickles into the glassy water, and, had her foremast remained, or more  than the broken stump of her bonaventure mizzen, she must have turned  over completely. Many days ago they had stripped the mainyard of its  course, and had passed the sail under the Mary's bottom, in the hope that  it would stop the leak. This it had partly done as long as the galleon  had continued to glide one way; then, without coming about, she had begun  to glide the other, the ropes had parted, and she had dragged the sail  after her, leaving a broad tarnish on the silver sea.    For it was broadside that the galleon glided, almost imperceptibly, ever  sucking down. She glided as if a loadstone drew her, and, at first, Abel  Keeling had thought it was a loadstone, pulling at her iron, drawing her  through the pearly mists that lay like face-cloths to the water and hid  at a short distance the tarnish left by the sail. But later he had known  that it was no loadstone drawing at her iron. The motion was due--must  be due--to the absolute deadness of the calm in that silent, sinister,  three-miles-broad waterway. With the eye of his mind he saw that  loadstone now as he lay against a gun-truck, all but toppling down the  deck. Soon that would happen again which had happened for five days past.  He would hear again the chattering of monkeys and the screaming of  parrots, the mat of green and yellow weeds would creep in towards the  Mary over the quicksilver sea, once more the sheer wall of rock would  rise, and the men would run....    But no; the men would not run this time to drop the fenders. There were  no men left to do so, unless Bligh was still alive. Perhaps Bligh was  still alive. He had walked half-way down the quarter-deck steps a little  before the sudden nightfall of the day before, had then fallen and lain  for a minute (dead, Abel Keeling had supposed, watching him from his  place by the gun-truck), and had then got up again and tottered forward  to the forecastle, his tall figure swaying and his long arms waving. Abel  Keeling had not seen him since. Most likely, he had died in the  forecastle during the night. If he had not been dead he would have come  aft again for water....    At the remembrance of the water Abel Keeling lifted his head. The strands  of lean muscle about his emaciated mouth worked, and he made a little  pressure of his sun-blackened hand on the deck, as if to verify its  steepness and his own balance. The mainmast was some seven or eight yards  away.... He put one stiff leg under him and began, seated as he was, to  make shuffling movements down the slope.    To the mainmast, near the belfry, was affixed his contrivance for  catching water. It consisted of a collar of rope set lower at one side  than at the other (but that had been before the mast had steeved so many  degrees away from the zenith), and tallowed beneath. The mists lingered  later in that gully of a strait than they did on the open ocean, and the  collar of rope served as a collector for the dews that condensed on the  mast. The drops fell into a small earthen pipkin placed on the deck  beneath it.    Abel Keeling reached the pipkin and looked into it. It was nearly a third  full of fresh water. Good. If Bligh, the mate, was dead, so much the more  water for Abel Keeling, master of the _Mary of the Tower_. He dipped two  fingers into the pipkin and put them into his mouth. This he did several  times. He did not dare to raise the pipkin to his black and broken lips  for dread of a remembered agony, he could not have told how many days  ago, when a devil had whispered to him, and he had gulped down the  contents of the pipkin in the morning, and for the rest of the day had  gone waterless.... Again he moistened his fingers and sucked them; then  he lay sprawling against the mast, idly watching the drops of water  as they fell.    It was odd how the drops formed. Slowly they collected at the edge of the  tallowed collar, trembled in their fullness for an instant, and fell,  another beginning the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],[0,"The Kybalion (#15)"],[1,"and by the appropriate  methods change the polarity when the same is desirable. We advise all  students to familiarize themselves with this Principle of Polarity, for  a correct understanding of the same will throw light on many difficult  subjects.        CHAPTER XI    RHYTHM        \"Everything flows out and in; everything has its tides;      all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests      in everything; the measure of the swing to the right,      is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm      compensates\"--The Kybalion.    The great Fifth Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Rhythm-embodies the  truth that in everything there is manifested a measured motion; a  to-and-from movement; a flow and inflow; a swing forward and backward; a  pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide and a low-  tide; between the two-poles manifest on the physical, mental or  spiritual planes. The Principle of rhythm is closely connected with the  Principle of Polarity described in the preceding chapter. Rhythm  manifests between the two poles established by the Principle of  Polarity. This does not mean, however, that the pendulum of Rhythm  swings to the extreme poles, for this rarely happens; in fact, it is  difficult to establish the extreme polar opposites in the majority of  cases. But the swing is ever \"toward\" first one pole and then the other.    There is always an action and reaction; an advance and a retreat; a  rising and a sinking; manifested in all of the airs and phenomena of the  Universe. Suns, worlds, men, animals, plants, minerals, forces, energy,  mind and matter, yes, even Spirit, manifests this Principle. The  Principle manifests in the creation and destruction of worlds; in the  rise and fall of nations; in the life history of all things; and finally  in the mental states of Man.    Beginning with the manifestations of Spirit--of THE ALL--it will be  noticed that there is ever the Outpouring and the Indrawing; the  \"Outbreathing and Inbreathing of Brahm,\" as the Brahmans word it.  Universes are created; reach their extreme low point of materiality; and  then begin in their upward swing. Suns spring into being, and then their  height of power being reached, the process of retrogression begins, and  after aeons they become dead masses of matter, awaiting another impulse  which starts again their inner energies into activity and a new solar  life cycle is begun. And thus it is with all the worlds; they are born,  grow and die; only to be reborn. And thus it is with all the things of  shape and form; they swing from action to reaction; from birth to death;  from activity to inactivity--and then back again. Thus it is with all  living things; they are born, grow, and die--and then are reborn. So it  is with all great movements, philosophies, creeds, fashions,  governments, nations, and all else-birth, growth, maturity, decadence,  death-and then new-birth. The swing of the pendulum is ever in evidence.    Night follows day; and day night. The pendulum swings from Summer to  Winter, and then back again. The corpuscles, atoms, molecules, and all  masses of matter, swing around the circle of their nature. There is no  such thing as absolute rest, or cessation from movement, and all  movement partakes of rhythm. The principle is of universal application.  It may be applied to any question, or phenomena of any of the many  planes of life. It may be applied to all phases of human activity.  There is always the Rhythmic swing from one pole to the other. The  Universal Pendulum is ever in motion. The Tides of Life flow in and out,  according to Law.    The Principle of rhythm is well understood by modern science, and is  considered a universal law as applied to material things. But the  Hermetists carry the principle much further, and know that its  manifestations and influence extend to the mental activities of Man, and  that it accounts for the bewildering succession of moods, feelings and  other annoying and perplexing changes that we notice in ourselves. But  the Hermetists by studying the operations of this Principle have learned  to escape some of its activities by Transmutation.    The Hermetic Masters long since discovered that while the Principle of  Rhythm was invariable, and ever in evidence in mental phenomena, still  there were two planes of its manifestation so far as mental phenomena  are concerned. They discovered that there were two general planes of  Consciousness, the Lower and the Higher, the understanding of which fact  enabled them to rise to the higher plane and thus escape the swing of  the Rhythmic pendulum which manifested on the lower plane. In other  words, the swing of the pendulum occurred on the Unconscious Plane, and  the Consciousness was not affected. This they call the Law of  Neutralization. Its operations consist in the raising of the Ego above  the vibrations of the Unconscious Plane of mental activity, so that the  negative-swing of the pendulum is not manifested in consciousness, and  therefore they are not affected. It is akin to rising above a thing and  letting it pass beneath you. The Hermetic Master, or advanced student,  polarizes himself at the desired pole, and by a process akin to  \"refusing\" to participate in the backward swing or, if you prefer, a  \"denial\" of its influence over him, he stands firm in his polarized  position, and allows the mental pendulum to swing back along the  unconscious plane. All individuals who have attained any degree of self-  mastery, accomplish this, more or less unknowingly, and by refusing to  allow their moods and negative mental states to affect them, they apply  the Law of Neutralization. The Master, however, carries this to a much  higher degree of proficiency, and by the use of his Will he attains  a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of belief on the  part of those who allow themselves to be swung backward and forward by  the mental pendulum of moods and feelings.    The importance of this will be appreciated by any thinking person who  realizes what creatures of moods, feelings and emotion the majority of  people are, and how little mastery of themselves they manifest. If you  will stop and consider a moment, you will realize how much these swings  of Rhythm have affected you in your life--how a period of Enthusiasm has  been invariably followed by an opposite feeling and mood of Depression.  Likewise, your moods and periods of Courage have been succeeded by equal  moods of Fear. And so it has ever been with the majority of  persons--tides of feeling have ever risen and fallen with them, but they  have never suspected the cause or reason of the mental phenomena. An  understanding of the workings of this Principle will give one the key to  the Mastery of these rhythmic swings of feeling, and will enable him to  know himself better and to avoid being carried away by these inflows and  outflows. The Will is superior to the conscious manifestation of this  Principle, although the Principle itself can never be destroyed. We may  escape its effects, but the Principle operates, nevertheless. The  pendulum ever swings, although we may escape being carried along with  it.    There are other features of the operation of this Principle of Rhythm of  which we wish to speak at this point. There comes into its operations  that which is known as the Law of Compensation. One of the definitions  or meanings of the word \"Compensate\" is, \"to counterbalance\" which is  the sense in which the Hermetists use the term. It is this Law of  Compensation to which the Kybalion refers when it says: \"The measure of  the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm  compensates.\"    The Law of Compensation is that the swing in one direction determines  the swing in the opposite direction, or to the opposite pole-the one  balances, or counterbalances, the other. On the Physical Plane we see  many examples of this Law. The pendulum of the clock swings a certain  distance to the right, and then an equal distance to the left. The  seasons balance each other in the same way. The tides follow the same  Law. And the same Law is manifested in all the phenomena of Rhythm. The  pendulum, with a short swing in one direction, has but a short swing in  the other; while the long swing to the right invariably means the long  swing to the left.  An object hurled upward to a certain height has an  equal distance to traverse on its return. The force with which a  projectile is sent upward a mile is reproduced when the projectile  returns to the earth on its return journey. This Law is constant on the  Physical Plane, as reference to the standard authorities will show you.    But the Hermetists carry it still further. They teach that a man's  mental states are subject to the same Law. The man who enjoys keenly, is  subject to keen suffering; while he who feels but little pain is capable  of feeling but little joy. The pig suffers but little mentally, and  enjoys but little--he is compensated. And on the other hand, there are  other animals who enjoy keenly, but whose nervous organism and  temperament cause them to suffer exquisite degrees of pain and so it is  with Man. There are temperaments which permit of but low degrees of  enjoyment, and equally low degrees of suffering; while there are others  which permit the most intense enjoyment, but also the most intense  suffering. The rule is that the capacity for pain and pleasure, in each  individual, are balanced. The Law of Compensation is in full operation  here.    But the Hermetists go still further in this matter. They teach that  before one is able to enjoy a certain degree of pleasure, he must have  swung as far, proportionately, toward the other pole of feeling. They  hold, however, that the Negative is precedent to the Positive in this  matter, that is to say that in experiencing a certain degree of pleasure  it does not follow that he will"]]]
