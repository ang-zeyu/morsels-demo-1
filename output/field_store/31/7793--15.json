Mr. C.B. Stetson has written on this  subject with great force and earnestness, and it will not be amiss to  quote a sentence as to the advantages enjoyed by the technically  workman. He says that \"it is the rude or dexterous workman, rather than  the really skilled one, who is supplanted by machinery. Skilled labor  requires thinking; but a machine never thinks, never judges, never  discriminates. Though its employment does, indeed, enable rude laborers  to do many things now which formerly could only be done by dexterous  workmen, it is clear that its use has decidedly increased the relative  demand for skilled labor as compared with unskilled, and there is  abundant room for an additional increase, if it is true, as declared by  the most eminent authority, that the power now expended can be readily  made to yield three or four times its present results, and ultimately  ten or twenty times, when masters and workmen can be had with sufficient  intelligence and skill for the direction and manipulation of the tools  and machinery that would be invented.\"    The establishment of colleges and universities by the aid of national  grants has depended very much for their character upon the industrial  tendencies of the respective States, it being understood that the land  grants have principally been given to those of the newer States and  Territories which required development, although some of the  institutions of the older States on the Atlantic seaboard have also been  recipients of the same fund, which in itself only dates from an act of  Congress in 1862. In California and Missouri, both States abounding in  mineral resources, there are courses in mining and metallurgy provided  in the institutions receiving national aid. In the great grain-producing  sections of the Mississippi Valley the colleges are principally devoted  to agriculture, whereas the characteristic feature of the Iowa and  Kansas schools is the prominence given to industries.    We need not devote attention to the aims and arrangements of the  agricultural colleges proper, but will pass at once to those which deal  with the mechanical arts, dealing first of all with those that are  assisted by the national land grant. Taking them alphabetically, we have  first the State Agricultural College of Colorado, in the mechanical and  drawing department of which shops for bench work in wood and iron and  for forging have been recently erected, this institution being one of  the newest in America. In the Illinois Industrial University the student  of mechanical engineering receives practice in five shops devoted to  pattern-making, blacksmithing, moulding and founding, benchwork for  iron, and machine tool-work for iron. In the first shop the practice  consists of planing, chiseling, turning, and the preparation of patterns  for casting. The ordinary blacksmithing operations take place in the  second shop, and those of casting in the third. In the fourth there is,  first of all, a course of freehand benchwork, and afterward the fitting  of parts is undertaken. In the fifth shop all the fundamental operations  on iron by machinery are practiced, the actual work being carefully  outlined beforehand by drawings. This department of the University  consists, in point of fact, of three separate schools, destined to  qualify the student for every kind of engineering--mining, railway,  mechanical, and architectural. In addition to the shops and machine  rooms, there are well furnished cabinets of geological and mineralogical  specimens, chemical laboratories for assaying and metallurgy, stamp  mill, furnaces, etc., and, in fact, every known vehicle for practical  instruction. The school of architecture prepares students for the  building profession. Among the subjects in this branch are office work  and shop practice, constructing joints in carpentry and joinery, cabinet  making and turning, together with modeling in clay. The courses in  mathematics, mechanics and physics are the same as those in the  engineering school; but the technical studies embrace drawing from  casts, wood, stone, brick, and iron construction, turners' work,  slating, plastering, painting, and plumbing, architectural drawing and  designing, the history and aesthetics of architecture, estimates,  agreements specification, heating, lighting, draining, and ventilation.  The student's work from scale drawing occupies three terms, carpentry  and joinery being taught in the first year, turning and cabinet making  in the second, metal and stone work in the third. A more condensed  course, known as the builder's course, is given to those who can only  stop one year. The machine shop has a steam engine of 16 horse power,  two engines and three plain lathes, a planer, a large drill press, a  pattern shop, a blacksmith's shop, all of the machinery having been  built on the spot. The carpenter's shop is likewise supplied with  necessary machine tools, such as saws, planers, tenoning machine,  whittlers, etc., the power being furnished by the machine shop. At the  date of the last University report, there were 41 students in the  courses of mechanical engineering, 41 in those of civil engineering, 3  in mining engineering, and 14 in architecture. Tuition is free in all  the University classes, though each student has to pay a matriculation  fee of $10, and the incidental expenses amount to about $23 annually. He  is charged for material used or apparatus broken, but not for the  ordinary wear and tear of instruments. It should be mentioned that the  endowment of the Illinois Industrial University is from scrip received  from the Government for 480,000 acres of land, of which 454,460 have  been sold for $319,178. The real estate of the University, partly made  up by donations and partly by appropriations made in successive sessions  by the State of Illinois, is estimated at $450,000.    The Purdue University in Indiana, named after its founder, who gave  $150,000, which was supplemented by another $50,000 from the State and a  bond grant of 390,000 acres, also provides a very complete mechanical  course, with shop instruction, divided as follows:      Bench working in wood    for 12 weeks, or 120 hours.

Exercising in sawing  and planing to dimensions. 2 Application, or box nailed together. 3  Mortise and tenon joints; a plain mortise and tenon; an open dovetailed  mortise and tenon (dovetailed halving); a dovetailed keyed mortise and  tenon. 4. Splices. 5. Common dovetailing. 6. Lap dovetailing and  rabbeting. 7. Blind or secret dovetail. 8. Miter-box. 9. Carpenter's  trestle. 10. Panel door. 11. Roof truss. 12. Section of king-post truss  roof. 13. Drawing model.    The course in wood turning includes: 1. Elementary principles: first,  straight turning; second, cutting in; third, convex curves with the  chisel; fourth, compound curves formed with the gouge. 2. File and  chisel handles. 3. Mallets. 4. Picture frames (chuck work). 5. Card  receiver (chuck work). 6. Watch safe (chuck work). 7. Ball.    In the pattern-making course the student is supposed to have some skill  in bench and lathe work, which will be increased; the direct object  being to teach what forms of pattern are in general necessary, and how  they must be constructed in order to get a perfect mould from them. The  character of the work differs each year. For instance, for the last  year, besides simpler patterns easily drawn from the sand, such as  glands, ball-cranks, etc., there were a series of flanged pipe-joints  for 21/2 in. pipes, including the necessary core boxes; also pulley  patterns from 6 in. to 10 in. diameter, built in segments for strength,  and to prevent warping and shrinkage; and, lastly, a complete set of  patterns for a three horse-power horizontal steam engine, all made from  drawings of the finished piece. In the vise work in iron, the chief  requirements are these: 1, given a block of cast iron 4 in. by 2 in. by  11/2 in. in thickness, to reduce the thickness 1/4 in. by chipping, and then  finishing with the file; 2, to file a round hole square; 3, to file a  round hole into elliptical; 4, given a 3 in. cube of wrought iron, to  cut a spline 3 in. by 3/8 in. by 1/4 in., and second, when the under side  is a one half round hollow--these two cuts involve the use of the cope  chisel and the round nose chisel, and are examples of very difficult  chipping; 5, round tiling or hand-vise work; 6, scraping; 7, special  examples of fitting. In the forging classes are elementary processes,  driving, bending, and upsetting; courses in welding; miscellaneous  forging; steel forging, including hardening and tempering in all its  details.    It is worth mentioning that in the industrial art school of the Purdue  University there were 13 of the fair sex as students, besides one in the  chemical school, and two going through the mechanical courses just  detailed, showing that the scope of woman's industry is less limited in  America than in England. The Iowa State Agricultural College has also  two departments of mechanical and civil engineering, the former  including a special course of architecture. The workshop practice, which  occupies three forenoons of 21/2 hours each per week, is, however, of more  general character, and is not pursued with such a regard to any special  calling as in the case of the Purdue University.    The Kansas State Agricultural College has a course of carpentry, though  designed rather more to meet the everyday necessities of a farmer's  life. In fact, all the students are obliged to attend these classes, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11414"],[0,"In the Claws of the German Eagle (#15)"],[1,"stoutly. \"They charged me a mark for a quart of milk.\"    I put my question of the morning to him: \"Is it dangerous traveling  along here so late?\" His answer was anything but reassuring.  \"Yes, it is very dangerous.\"    Then he explained that one of his comrades had been shot by a  Belgian from the bluffs above that very afternoon and that the men  were all very angry. All the Belgians had taken to cover, for the  road was totally cleared of pedestrians from this place on to  Mouland.    \"Well, what am I to do?\" I asked.    \"Go straight ahead. Swerve neither to the right nor left. Be sure  you have no weapons, and stop at once when the guard cries  'Halt!' and you will get through all right. But, above all, be sure to  stand stock still immediately at the challenge. Above all--that,\" he  insisted.    \"But did I not stop still when you cried 'Halt!' a minute ago?\" I  asked.    \"No,\" he said; \"you took two or three steps before you came to a  perfect stop. See, this is the way to do it.\" He started off briskly,  and as I cried \"Halt!\" came to a standstill with marvelous and  sudden precision for a man of his weight.    \"Do it that way and cry out, 'Ready, here!' and it will be all right.\"    I would give a great deal for a vignette of that ponderous fellow  acting as drillmaster to this stray American. The intensity of the  situation rapidly ripened his interest into an affection. I was fretting  to get away, but the amenities demanded a more formal leave-  taking. At last, however, I broke away, bearing with me his paternal  benediction. Far ahead a company of soldiers was forming into  line. Just as I reached the place they came to attention, and at a  gesture from the captain I walked like a royal personage down  past the whole line, feeling hundreds of eyes critically playing upon  me. I suspect that the captain had a sense of humor and was  enjoying the discomfiture he knew I must feel.    Estimating my advance by the signboards, where distances were  marked in kilometers, it appeared that I was getting on with  wretched slowness, considering the efforts I was making. At this  rate, I knew I should never reach the Holland frontier by nightfall,  and from the warnings I had received I dreaded to attempt  crossing after sundown. Sleeping in the fields when the whole  country was infested by soldiers was out of the question, so I  turned to the first open cottage of a peasant and asked him to take  me in for the night. He shook his head emphatically, and gave me  to understand it would be all his life were worth if he did so. So I  rallied my energies for one last effort, and plunged wildly ahead.    The breeze was blowing refreshingly up the river, the road was  clear, and soon I was rewarded by seeing the smoke still curling  up from the ruins of Vise. I looked at my watch, which pointed to  the time for sunset, and yet there was the sun, curiously enough,  some distance up from the horizon. The fact of the matter is that I  had reset my watch at Liege, and clocks there had all been  changed to German time. With a tremendous sense of relief I  discovered that I had a full hour more than I had figured on.    There was ample time now to cover the remaining distance, and  so I rested a moment before what appeared to be a deserted  house. Slowly the shutters were pushed back and a sweet-faced  old lady timorously thrust her head out of an upper window. She  apparently had been hiding away terror-stricken, and there was  something pathetic in the half-trusting way she risked her fate  even now. In a low voice she put some question in the local patois  to me. I could not understand what she was asking, but concluded  that she was seeking comfort and assurance. So I sought to  convey by much gesturing and benevolent smiling that all was  quiet and safe along the Meuse. She may have concluded that I  was some harmless, roaming idiot who could not answer a plain  question; but it was the best I could do, and I walked on to Vise  with the fine feeling of having played the role of comforter.    At Vise I was heartened by two dogs who jumped wildly and  joyously around me. I gathered courage enough here to swerve to  the right, and from the window of a still burning roadside cafe  extracted three wine-glasses as souvenirs of the trip.    Presently I was in Mouland, whose few forlorn walls grouped about  the village church made a pathetic picture as they glowed  luminously in the setting sun. A flock of doves were cooing in the  blackened ruins. Now I was on the home-stretch; and, that there  might be no mistake with my early morning comrades, I cried out  in German, \"Here comes a friend!\" With broad smiles on their  faces, they were waiting there to receive me.    They made a not unpicturesque group gathered around their  camp-fire. One was plucking a chicken, another making the straw  beds for the night. A third was laboriously at work writing a post-  card. I ventured the information that I had made over fifty  kilometers that day. They punctured my pride somewhat by stating  that that was often the regular stint for German soldiers. But,  pointing to their own well-made hobnailed boots, they added,  \"Never in thin rubber soles like yours.\" After emptying my pockets  of eatables and promising to deliver the post-card, I passed once  more under the great Dutch banner into neutral territory.    My three Holland friends were there with an automobile, and,  greeting me with a hearty \"Gute Knabe!\" whisked me off to  Maastricht. For the next three days I did all my writing in bed,  nursing a, couple of bandaged feet. I wouldn't have missed that  trip for ten thousand dollars. I wouldn't go through it again for a  hundred thousand.      Part 3  With the War Photographers in Belgium            Chapter IX    How I Was Shot As A German Spy        IN the last days of September, the Belgians moving in and through  Ghent in their rainbow-colored costumes, gave to the city a  distinctively holiday touch. The clatter of cavalry hoofs and the  throb of racing motors rose above the voices of the mobs that  surged along the streets.    Service was normal in the cafes. To the accompaniment of music  and clinking glasses the dress-suited waiter served me a five-  course lunch for two francs. It was uncanny to see this blaze of life  while the city sat under the shadow of a grave disaster. At any  moment the gray German tide might break out of Brussels and  pour its turbid flood of soldiers through these very streets. Even  now a Taube hovered in the sky, and from the skirmish-line an  occasional ambulance rumbled in with its crimsoned load.    I chanced into Gambrinus' cafe and was lost in the babbling sea of  French and Flemish. Above the melee of sounds, however, I  caught a gladdening bit of English. Turning about, I espied a little  group of men whose plain clothes stood out in contrast to the  colored uniforms of officers and soldiers crowded into the cafe.  Wearied of my efforts at conversing in a foreign tongue, I went  over and said: \"Do you really speak English!\" \"Well, rather!\"  answered the one who seemed to act as leader of the group. \"We  are the only ones now and it will be scarcer still around here in a  few days.\" \"Why!\" I asked.    \"Because Ghent will be in German hands.\" This brought an  emphatic denial from one of his confreres who insisted that the  Germans had already reached the end of their rope. A certain  correspondent, joining in the argument, came in for a deal of  banter for taking the war de luxe in a good hotel far from the front.    \"What do you know about the war?\" they twitted him. \"You've  pumped all your best stories out of the refugees ten miles from the  front, after priming them with a glass of beer.\"    They were a group of young war-photographers to whom danger  was a magnet. Though none of them had yet reached the age of  thirty, they had seen service in all the stirring events of Europe and  even around the globe. Where the clouds lowered and the seas  tossed, there they flocked. Like stormy petrels they rushed to the  center of the swirling world. That was their element. A free-lance, a  representative of the Northcliffe press, and two movie-men  comprised this little group and made an island of English amidst  the general babel.    Like most men who have seen much of the world, they had  ceased to be cynics. When I came to them out of the rain, carrying  no other introduction than a dripping overcoat, they welcomed me  into their company and whiled away the evening with tales of the  Balkan wars.    They were in high spirits over their exploits of the previous day,  when the Germans, withdrawing from Melle on the outskirts of the  city, had left a long row of cottages still burning. As the enemy  troops pulled out the further end of the street, the movie men  came in at the other and caught the pictures of the still blazing  houses. We went down to view them on the screen. To the gentle  throbbing of drums and piano, the citizens of Ghent viewed the  unique spectacle of their own suburbs going up in smoke.    At the end of the show they invited me to fill out their automobile  on the morrow. Nearly every other motor had been commandeered  by the authorities for the \"Service Militaire\" and bore on the front  the letters \"S. M.\" Our car was by no means in the blue-ribbon  class. It had a hesitating disposition and the authorities, regarding  it as more of a liability than an asset, had passed it over.    But the correspondents counted it a great stroke of fortune to have  any car at all; and, that they might continue to have it, they kept it  at night carefully locked in a room in the hotel.    They had their chauffeur under like supervision. He was one of  their kind, and with the cunning of a diplomat obtained the permit  to buy petrol, most precious of all treasures in the field of war.  Indeed, gasoline, along with courage and discipline, completed the  trinity of success in the"]]]
