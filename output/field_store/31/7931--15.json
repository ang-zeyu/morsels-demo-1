'It would all have been different if Symons had lived. We should never  have let them escape from under our guns. That commando would have been  smashed up altogether.'    'But what about the other commando that came up the next day?'    'Oh, the General would have managed them all right. He'd have, soon  found some way of turning them out.' Nor do I doubt he would, if the  fearless confidence with which he inspired his troops could have  protected his life. But the bullet is brutally indiscriminating, and  before it the brain of a hero or the quarters of a horse stand exactly  the same chance to the vertical square inch.    After Talana Hill was lost to view we began to search for Majuba, and  saw it just as night closed in--a great dark mountain with memories as  sad and gloomy as its appearance. The Boer guards pointed out to us  where they had mounted their big cannons to defend Laing's Nek, and  remarked that the pass was now impregnable. I could not resist saying,  'This is not the only road into the Transvaal.' 'Ah, but you English  always come where we want you to come.'    We now approached the frontier. I had indulged in hopes of leaving the  train while in the Volksrust Tunnel by climbing out of the window. The  possibility had, however, presented itself to Spaarwater, for he shut  both windows, and just before we reached the entrance opened the breech  of his Mauser to show me that it was fully loaded. So prudence again  imposed patience. It was quite dark when the train reached Volksrust,  and we knew ourselves actually in the enemy's country. The platform was  densely crowded with armed Boers. It appeared that two new commandos had  been called out, and were waiting for trains to take them to the front.  Moreover, a strong raiding party had just come back from British  Swaziland. The windows were soon blocked with the bearded faces of men  who gazed stolidly and commented freely to each other on our  appearance. It was like being a wild beast in a cage. After some time a  young woman pushed her way to the window and had a prolonged stare, at  the end of which she observed in a loud voice (I must record it)--'Why,  they're not so bad looking after all.' At this there was general  laughter, and Spaarwater, who was much concerned, said that they meant  no harm, and that if we were annoyed he would have everyone cleared  away. But I said: 'Certainly not; let them feast their eyes.' So they  did, for forty minutes by the clock.    Their faces were plain and rough, but not unkindly. The little  narrow-set pig-eyes were the most displeasing feature. For the rest they  looked what they were, honest ignorant peasants with wits sharpened by  military training and the conditions of a new country. Presently I  noticed at the window furthest from the platform one of quite a  different type. A handsome boyish face without beard or moustache, and a  very amiable expression. We looked at each other. There was no one else  at that side of the carriage.    'Will you have some cigarettes?' he said, holding me out a packet. I  took one, and we began to talk. 'Is there going to be much more war?' he  inquired anxiously.    'Yes, very much more; we have scarcely begun,' He looked quite  miserable.    I said, 'You have not been at the front yet?'    'No, I am only just commandeered.'    'How old are you?'    'Sixteen.'    'That's very young to go and fight.'    He shook his head sadly.    'What's your name?'    'Cameron.'    'That's not a Dutch name?'    'No, I'm not a Dutchman. My father came from Scotland.'    'Then why do you go and fight against the British?'    'How can I help it? I live here. You must go when you're commandeered.  They wouldn't let me off. Mother tried her best. But it's \"come out and  fight or leave the country\" here, and we've got nothing but the farm.'    'The Government would have paid you compensation afterwards.'    'Ah! that's what they told father last time. He was loyal, and helped to  defend the Pretoria laager. He lost everything, and he had to begin all  over again.'    'So now you fight against your country?'    'I can't help it,' he repeated sullenly, 'you must go when you're  commandeered.' And then he climbed down off the footboard, and I did not  see him again--one piteous item of Gladstone's legacy--the ruined and  abandoned loyalist in the second generation.    Before the train left Volksrust we changed our guards. The honest  burghers who had captured us had to return to the front, and we were to  be handed over to the police. The leader of the escort--a dear old  gentleman--I am ignorant of his official rank--approached and explained  through Spaarwater that it was he who had placed the stone and so caused  our misfortunes. He said he hoped we bore no malice. We replied by no  means, and that we would do the same for him with pleasure any day.  Frankland asked him what rewards he would get for such distinguished  service. In truth he might easily have been shot, had we turned the  corner a minute earlier. The subaltern apparently contemplated some  Republican V.C. or D.S.O. But the farmer was much puzzled by his  question. After some explaining we learnt that he had been given  fourteen days' furlough to go home to his farm and see his wife. His  evident joy and delight were touching. I said 'Surely this is a very  critical time to leave the front. You may miss an important battle.'    'Yes,' he replied simply, 'I hope so.' Then we said 'good-bye,' and I  gave him, and also Spaarwater, a little slip of paper setting forth that  they had shown kindness and courtesy to British prisoners of war, and  personally requesting anyone into whose hands the papers might come to  treat them well, should they themselves be taken by the Imperial forces.    We were then handed to a rather dilapidated policeman of a gendarme  type, who spat copiously on the floor of the carriage and informed us  that we should be shot if we attempted to escape. Having no desire to  speak to this fellow, we let down the sleeping shelves of the  compartment and, as the train steamed out of Volksrust, turned to sleep.          CHAPTER X    IN AFRIKANDER BONDS      Pretoria: December 3rd, 1899.    It was, as nearly as I can remember, midday when the train-load of  prisoners reached Pretoria. We pulled up in a sort of siding with an  earth platform on the right side which opened into the streets of the  town. The day was fine, and the sun shone brightly. There was a  considerable crowd of people to receive us; ugly women with bright  parasols, loafers and ragamuffins, fat burghers too heavy to ride at the  front, and a long line of untidy, white-helmeted policemen--'zarps' as  they were called--who looked like broken-down constabulary. Someone  opened--unlocked, that is, the point--the door of the railway carriage  and told us to come out; and out we came--a very ragged and tattered  group of officers--and waited under the sun blaze and the gloating of  many eyes. About a dozen cameras were clicking busily, establishing an  imperishable record of our shame. Then they loosed the men and bade them  form in rank. The soldiers came out of the dark vans, in which they had  been confined, with some eagerness, and began at once to chirp and joke,  which seemed to me most ill-timed good humour. We waited altogether for  about twenty minutes. Now for the first time since my capture I hated  the enemy. The simple, valiant burghers at the front, fighting bravely  as they had been told 'for their farms,' claimed respect, if not  sympathy. But here in Pretoria all was petty and contemptible. Slimy,  sleek officials of all nationalities--the red-faced, snub-nosed  Hollander, the oily Portuguese half-caste--thrust or wormed their way  through the crowd to look. I seemed to smell corruption in the air. Here  were the creatures who had fattened on the spoils. There in the field  were the heroes who won them. Tammany Hall was defended by the  Ironsides.    From these reflections I was recalled by a hand on my shoulder. A  lanky, unshaven police sergeant grasped my arm. 'You are not an  officer,' he said; 'you go this way with the common soldiers,' and he  led me across the open space to where the men were formed in a column of  fours. The crowd grinned: the cameras clicked again. I fell in with the  soldiers and seized the opportunity to tell them not to laugh or smile,  but to appear serious men who cared for the cause they fought for; and  when I saw how readily they took the hint, and what influence I  possessed with them, it seemed to me that perhaps with two thousand  prisoners something some day might be done. But presently a superior  official--superior in rank alone, for in other respects he looked a  miserable creature--came up and led me back to the officers. At last,  when the crowd had thoroughly satisfied their patriotic curiosity, we  were marched off; the soldiers to the enclosed camp on the racecourse,  the officers to the States Model Schools prison.    The distance was short, so far as we were concerned, and surrounded by  an escort of three armed policemen to each officer, we swiftly traversed  two sandy avenues with detached houses on either hand, and reached our  destination. We turned a corner; on the other side of the road stood a  long, low, red brick building with a slated verandah and a row of iron  railings before it. The verandah was crowded with bearded men in _khaki_  uniforms or brown suits of flannel--smoking, reading, or talking. They  looked up as we arrived. The iron gate was opened, and passing in we  joined sixty British officers 'held by the enemy;' and the iron gate was  then shut again.    'Hullo! How are you? Where did they catch you? What's the latest news of  Buller's advance? Are we going to be exchanged?' and a dozen other  questions were asked.

He  wrote to a friend, the author of \"Edge Hill,\" in Richmond, that he had  quite overcome \"the seductive and dangerous besetment\" by which he had so  often been prostrated, and to another friend that, incredible as it might  seem, he had become a \"model of temperance,\" and of \"other virtues,\"  which it had sometimes been difficult for him to practice. Before the  close of the summer, however, he relapsed into his former courses, and  for weeks was regardless of everything but a morbid and insatiable  appetite for the means of intoxication.    In the autumn he published all the prose stories he had then written, in  two volumes, under the title of \"Tales of the Grotesque and the  Arabesque.\" The work was not salable, perhaps because its contents were  too familiar from recent separate publication in magazines; and it was  not so warmly praised, generally, as I think it should have been, though  in point of style the pieces which it embraced are much less perfect than  they were made subsequently.    He was with Mr. Burton until June, 1840--more than a year. Mr. Burton  Appreciated his abilities and would have gladly continued the connection;  but Poe was so unsteady of purpose and so unreliable that the actor was  never sure when he left the city that his business would be cared for. On  one occasion, returning after the regular day of publication, he found  the number unfinished, and Poe incapable of duty. He prepared the  necessary copy himself, published the magazine, and was proceeding with  arrangements with for another month, when he received a letter from his  assistant, of which the tone may be inferred from this answer:    \"I am sorry you have thought it necessary to send me such a letter. Your  troubles have given a morbid tone to your feelings which it is your duty  to discourage. I myself have been as severely handled by the world as you  can possibly have been, but my sufferings have not tinged my mind with  melancholy, nor jaundiced my views of society. You must rouse your  energies, and if care assail you, conquer it. I will gladly overlook the  past. I hope you will as easily fulfill your pledges for the future. We  shall agree very well, thought I cannot permit the magazine to be made a  vehicle for that sort of severity which you think is so 'successful with  the mob.' I am truly much less anxious about making a monthly 'sensation'  than I am upon the point of fairness. You must, my dear sir, get rid of  your avowed ill-feelings toward your brother authors. You see I speak  plainly; I cannot do otherwise upon such a subject. You say the people  love havoc. I think they love justice. I think you yourself would not  have written the article on Dawes, in a more healthy state of mind. I am  not trammeled by any vulgar consideration of expediency; I would rather  lose money than by such undue severity wound the feelings of a  kind-hearted and honorable man. And I am satisfied that Dawes has  something the true fire in him. I regretted your word-catching spirit.  But I wander from my design. I accept your proposition to recommence your  interrupted avocations upon the _Maga_. Let us meet as if we had not  exchanged letters. Use more exercise, write when feelings prompt, and be  assured of my friendship. You will soon regain a healthy activity of  mind, and laugh at your past vagaries.\"    This letter was kind and judicious. It gives us a glimpse of Poe's theory  of criticism, and displays the temper and principles of the literary  comedian in an honorable light. Two or three months afterward Burton went  out of town to fulfill a professional engagement, leaving material and  directions for completing the next number of the magazine in four days.  He was absent nearly a fortnight, and on returning he found that his  printers in the meanwhile had not received a line of copy; but that Poe  had prepared the prospectus of a new monthly, and obtained transcripts of  his subscription and account books, to be used in a scheme for  supplanting him. He encountered his associate late in the evening at one  of his accustomed haunts, and said, \"Mr. Poe, I am astonished: Give me my  manuscripts so that I can attend to the duties you have so shamefully  neglected, and when you are sober we will settle.\" Poe interrupted him  with \"Who are you that presume to address me in this manner? Burton, I  am--_the editor--of the Penn.--Magazine_--and you are--hiccup--_a fool_.\"  Of course this ended his relations with the \"Gentleman's.\"    In November, 1840, Burton's miscellany was merged in \"The Casket,\" owned  by Mr. George R. Graham, and the new series received the name of its  proprietor, who encouraged Poe in its editorship. His connection with  \"Graham's Magazine\" lasted about a year and a half, and this was one of  the most active and brilliant periods of his literary life. He wrote in  it several of his finest tales and most trenchant criticisms, and  challenged attention by his papers entitled \"Autography,\" and those on  cryptology and ciphers. In the first, adopting a suggestion of Lavater,  he attempted the illustration of character from handwriting; and in the  second, he assumed that human ingenuity could construct no secret writing  which human ingenuity could not resolve; a not very dangerous  proposition, since it implied no capacity in himself to discover every  riddle of this kind that should be invented. He however succeeded with  several difficult cryptographs that were sent to him, and the direction  of his mind to the subject led to the composition of some of the tales of  ratiocination which so largely increased his reputation. The infirmities  which induced his separation from Mr. White and Mr. Burton at length  compelled Mr. Graham to seek for another editor; but Poe still remained  in Philadelphia, engaged from time to time in various literary  occupations, and in the vain effort to establish a journal of his own to  be called \"The Stylus.\" Although it requires considerable capital to  carry on a monthly of the description he proposed, I think it would not  have been difficult, with his well-earned fame as a magazinist, for him  to have found a competent and suitable publisher, but for the unfortunate  notoriety of his habits, and the failure in succession of three persons  who had admired him for his genius and pitied him for his misfortunes, by  every means that tact or friendship could suggest, to induce the  consistency and steadiness of application indispensable to success in  such pursuits. It was in the spring of 1848--more than a year after his  dissociation from Graham--that he wrote the story of \"The Gold Bug,\" for  which he was paid a prize of one hundred dollars. It has relation to  Captain Kyd's treasure, and is one of the most remarkable illustrations  of his ingenuity of construction and apparent subtlety of reasoning. The  interest depends upon the solution of an intricate cypher. In the autumn  of 1844 Poe removed to New York.    It was while he resided in Philadelphia that I became acquainted with  him. His manner, except during his fits of intoxication, was very quiet  and gentlemanly; he was usually dressed with simplicity and elegance; and  when once he sent for me to visit him, during a period of illness caused  by protracted and anxious watching at the side of his sick wife, I was  impressed by the singular neatness and the air of refinement in his home.  It was in a small house, in one of the pleasant and silent neighborhoods  far from the center of the town, and though slightly and cheaply  furnished, everything in it was so tasteful and so fitly disposed that it  seemed altogether suitable for a man of genius. For this and for most of  the comforts he enjoyed in his brightest as in his darkest years, he was  chiefly indebted to his mother-in-law, who loved him with more than  maternal devotion and constancy.    He had now written his most acute criticisms and his most admirable  tales. Of tales, beside those to which I have referred, he had produced  \"The Descent into the Maelstroem,\" \"The Premature Burial,\" \"The Purloined  Letter,\" \"The Murders of the Rue Morgue,\" and its sequel, \"The Mystery of  Marie Roget.\" The scenes of the last three are in Paris, where the  author's friend, the Chevalier Auguste Dupin, is supposed to reveal to  him the curiosities of his experience and observation in matters of  police. \"The Mystery of Marie Roget\" was first published in the autumn of  1842, before an extraordinary excitement, occasioned by the murder of a  young girl named Mary Rogers, in the vicinity of New York, had quite  subsided, though several months after the tragedy. Under the pretense of  relating the fate of a Parisian _grisette_, Mr. Poe followed in minute  detail the essential while merely paralleling the inessential facts of  the real murder. His object appears to have been to reinvestigate the  case and to settle his own conclusions as to the probable culprit. There  is a great deal of hair-splitting in the incidental discussions by Dupin,  throughout all these stories, but it is made effective. Much of their  popularity, as well as that of other tales of ratiocination by Poe, arose  from their being in a new key. I do not mean to say that they are not  ingenious; but they have been thought more ingenious than they are, on  account of their method and air of method. In \"The Murders of the Rue  Morgue,\" for instance, what ingenuity is displayed in unraveling a web  which has been woven for the express purpose of unraveling? The reader is  made to confound the ingenuity of the supposititious Dupin with that of  the writer of the story. These works brought the name of Poe himself  somewhat conspicuously before the law courts of Paris. The journal, _La  Commerce_, gave a _feuilleton_ in which \"The Murders of the Rue Morgue\"  appeared in translation. Afterward a writer for _La Quotidienne_ served "]]]
