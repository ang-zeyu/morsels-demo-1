It was put away with  other valuable U.G.R.R. documents for future reference. Touching the  \"rascality\" of William and James and the unfortunate predicament in  which it placed the kind-hearted widow, Mrs. Louisa White, the following  editorial clipped from the wide-awake Richmond Despatch, was also highly  appreciated, and preserved as conclusive testimony to the successful  working of the U.G.R.R. in the Old Dominion. It reads thus--    \"RASCALITY SOMEWHERE.--We called attention yesterday to the  advertisement of two negroes belonging to Mrs. Louisa White, by Toler &  Cook, and in the call we expressed the opinion that they were still  lurking about the city, preparatory to going off. Mr. Toler, we find, is  of a different opinion. He believes that they have already cleared  themselves--have escaped to a Free State, and we think it extremely  probable that he is in the right. They were both of them uncommonly  intelligent negroes. One of them, the one hired to Mr. White, was a  tip-top baker. He had been all about the country, and had been in the  habit of supplying the U.S. Pennsylvania with bread; Mr. W. having the  contract. In his visits for this purpose, of course, he formed  acquaintances with all sorts of sea-faring characters; and there is  every reason to believe that he has been assisted to get off in that  way, along with the other boy, hired to the Messrs. Williams. That the  two acted in concert, can admit of no doubt. The question is now to find  out how they got off. They must undoubtedly have had white men in the  secret. Have we then a nest of Abolition scoundrels among us? There  ought to be a law to put a police officer on board every vessel as soon  as she lands at the wharf. There is one, we believe for inspecting  vessels before they leave. If there is not there ought to be one.    \"These negroes belong to a widow lady and constitute all the property  she has on earth. They have both been raised with the greatest  indulgence. Had it been otherwise, they would never have had an  opportunity to escape, as they have done. Their flight has left her  penniless. Either of them would readily have sold for $1200; and Mr.  Toler advised their owner to sell them at the commencement of the year,  probably anticipating the very thing that has happened. She refused to  do so, because she felt too much attachment to them. They have made a  fine return, truly.\"    No comment is necessary on the above editorial except simply to express  the hope that the editor and his friends who seemed to be utterly  befogged as to how these \"uncommonly intelligent negroes\" made their  escape, will find the problem satisfactorily solved in this book.    However, in order to do even-handed justice to all concerned, it seems  but proper that William and James should be heard from, and hence a  letter from each is here appended for what they are worth. True they  were intended only for private use, but since the \"True light\" (Freedom)  has come, all things may be made manifest.        LETTER FROM WILLIAM HENRY GILLIAM.            ST. CATHARINES, C.W., MAY 15th, 1854.        My Dear Friend:--I receaved yours, Dated the 10th and the papers      on the 13th, I also saw the pice that was in Miss Shadd's paper      About me.

GILLIAM, the widow's Mite.      \"Our friend Minkins,\" in whose behalf William asks the united prayers of  his friends, was one of the \"scoundrels\" who assisted him and his two  companions to escape on the steamer. Being suspected of \"rascality\" in  this direction, he was arrested and put in jail, but as no evidence  could be found against him he was soon released.        JAMES MERCER'S LETTER.            TORONTO, MARCH 17th, 1854.

My friend, I would like to hear from you, I have been looking      for a letter from you for Several days as the last was very      interesting to me, please to write Right away.        Yours most Respectfully,        JOHN H. HILL.      Instead of weeping over the sad situation of his \"penniless\" mistress  and showing any signs of contrition for having wronged the man who held  the mortgage of seven hundred and fifty dollars on him, James actually  \"feels rejoiced in the Lord for his liberty,\" and is \"very much pleased  with Toronto;\" but is not satisfied yet, he is even concocting a plan by  which his wife might be run off from Richmond, which would be the cause  of her owner (Henry W. Quarles, Esq.) losing at least one thousand  dollars,          ST. CATHARINE, CANADA, JUNE 8th, 1854.        MR. STILL, DEAR FRIEND:--I received a letter from the poor old      widow, Mrs. L.E. White, and she says I may come back if I choose      and she will do a good part by me. Yes, yes I am choosing the      western side of the South for my home. She is smart, but cannot      bung my eye, so she shall have to die in the poor house at last,      so she says, and Mercer and myself will be the cause of it. That      is all right. I am getting even with her now for I was in the      poor house for twenty-five years and have just got out. And she      said she knew I was coming away six weeks before I started, so      you may know my chance was slim. But Mr. John Wright said I came      off like a gentleman and he did not blame me for coming for I      was a great boy. Yes I here him enough he is all gas. I am in      Canada, and they cannot help themselves.        About that subject I will not say anything more. You must write      to me as soon as you can and let me here the news and how the      Family is and yourself. Let me know how the times is with the      U.G.R.R. Co. Is it doing good business? Mr. Dykes sends his      respects to you. Give mine to your family.        Your true friend,        W.H. GILLIAM.      John Clayton, the companion in tribulation of William and James, must  not be lost sight of any longer. He was owned by the Widow Clayton, and  was white enough to have been nearly related to her, being a mulatto. He  was about thirty-five years of age, a man of fine appearance, and quite  intelligent. Several years previous he had made an attempt to escape,  but failed. Prior to escaping in this instance, he had been laboring in  a tobacco factory at $150 a year. It is needless to say that he did not  approve of the \"peculiar institution.\" He left a wife and one child  behind to mourn after him. Of his views of Canada and Freedom, the  following frank and sensible letter, penned shortly after his arrival,  speaks for itself--          TORONTO, March 6th, 1854.        DEAR MR. STILL:--I take this method of informing you that I am      well both in health and mind. You may rest assured that I fells      myself a free man and do not fell as I did when I was in      Virginia thanks be to God I have no master into Canada but I am      my own man. I arrived safe into Canada on friday last. I must      request of you to write a few lines to my wife and jest state to      her that her friend arrived safe into this glorious land of      liberty and I am well and she will make very short her time in      Virginia. tell her that I likes here very well and hopes to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15281"],[0,"Uncle Wiggily's Adventures (#15)"],[1," dollars.    \"My!\" exclaimed the rabbit. \"If I had that fish, and I could take him to a  jewelry shop, and sell him, I would get so much money that my fortune  would be made, and I wouldn't have to travel any farther. But I guess the  fish would rather stay in the pond than in a jewelry shop.\"    \"Indeed, I would,\" answered the fish, looking up. \"And I am glad you are  so kind as to be thoughtful of my feelings. Perhaps I may be able to help  you, some day.\"    And with that the fish dived away down under the water, after calling  good-bye to the rabbit, and then Uncle Wiggily hopped on, and he didn't  think any more about the goldfish, until some time after that.    Well, as soon as the elephant had his trunk packed--Oh, hold on, if you  please. I wonder what's the matter with me? There's no elephant in this  story. He comes in it about five pages farther on.    Well, after traveling for several hours, Uncle Wiggily ate his dinner,  then he hopped on some more, and he looked all around for his fortune, but  he couldn't find it. Then it began to get dark, and he wondered where he  could stay that night.    \"I might build a paper house,\" he said, \"but if I do the alligator might  come along and smash it, and this time he would probably catch me. I  wonder what I'd better do?\"    So he looked ahead, and there he saw a stream of water. It was quite a  wide brook, but on the other side of it he saw a nice little wooden house,  that no one lived in.    \"Now, if I could only get over there I'd be safe,\" said the old gentleman  rabbit. \"I guess I'll wade across.\"    Well, he started to do so, but he soon found that the water was too deep  for him to wade. It was over his head.    \"I'll have to swim across,\" said Uncle Wiggily.    But, as soon as he got ready to do that, he found himself in more trouble.  For he couldn't carry his crutch and valise across with him if he swam,  and he didn't like to leave them on the shore, for fear the alligator  would get them.    \"Oh, I certainly am in great trouble,\" said the rabbit. \"It's getting  darker and darker, and I have no place to stay. I haven't even any paper  with which to make me a paper house, but if I could only get across to the  wooden house, I'd be safe.\"    And, just as he spoke, there came a little puff of wind, and lo and  behold! a nice piece of paper was blown right down out of a tree, where it  had been caught on a branch. Right at Uncle Wiggily's side it fell; that  paper did.    \"Oh, joy!\" the rabbit gentleman cried. \"Here is paper to make me a house  with.\" But when he looked more closely at it, he saw that it wasn't big  enough for a house, and it wasn't the kind of paper that would keep out  the rain, either.    \"That will never do,\" said Uncle Wiggily, sadly. \"Ah! But I have an idea.  I will make me a paper boat, as Billie Goat once did, and in the boat I'll  sail across the stream, and sleep in the little wooden house.\"    So he folded up the paper, first like a soldier's hat, and then like a  fireman's hat, and then he pulled on the two ends, and, presto change! he  had a paper boat. Then he took his crutch, and stuck it up in the middle  of the boat, and put a piece of paper on the crutch, and he had a sail.  Then he put the boat in the water, and got in it himself. I mean he got in  the boat, not the water--with his valise.    \"Here we go!\" cried the old gentleman rabbit, and he shoved the boat out  from the shore. The wind caught in the little paper sail, and away Uncle  Wiggily went, as fine as fine could be.    \"I'll soon be on the other shore,\" he said, and just then he looked down,  and he saw some water coming inside the boat. \"Hum! That's bad,\" he cried.  \"I'm afraid my boat is leaking.\"    The wind blew harder, and the boat went faster, but more water came in,  for you see the paper was sort of melting, and falling apart, like an ice  cream cone, for it wasn't the waxed kind of paper from the inside of  cracker boxes--the kind that water won't hurt.    Well, the boat began to sink, and the water came up to Uncle Wiggily's  knees, and then, all of a sudden there was a funny sound on shore, a  snipping snooping woofing-woofing sound, and into the water jumped the  alligator with the skiller-scalery, swooping tail.    \"Now I've got you!\" he cried, snapping his jaws at the poor old gentleman  rabbit. And really it did seem as if Uncle Wiggily would be eaten up. But  you never can tell what is going to happen in this world; never indeed.    All of a sudden, just as the paper boat was melting all to pieces, and  Uncle Wiggily was trying, as best he could, to swim to shore with his  crutch and valise, and just as the alligator was going to grab him, along  came the big, kind goldfish.    \"Jump on my back, Uncle Wiggily!\" cried the fish, and the rabbit did so,  in the twinkling of an eye. And before the alligator could grab Uncle  Wiggily, the goldfish swam to shore with him, and he was safe. And the  alligator got some soap in his eye, from washing his face too hard, and  went sloshing away as mad as could be, but it served him right. And Uncle  Wiggily slept safely in the wooden house all night, and dreamed about  finding a gold dollar.    Now in case the banana man brings me some pink oranges for the elephant's  little boy, I'll tell you in another story about Uncle Wiggily and the mud  pie.[Transcriber's Note: in the above sentence, the word \"tell\" was  omitted in the original text.]          STORY XXII    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MUD PIE      Uncle Wiggily slept very soundly that night in the little wooden house,  across on the other side of the brook, where the alligator tried to catch  him, but didn't. And when he awakened in the morning the rabbit traveler  wondered what he was going to have for breakfast. But he didn't wonder  very long.    For, as soon as he had gotten up, and had washed his paws and face, and  combed out his ears--oh, dear me--I mean his whiskers--as soon as he had  done that, he heard a knock on the door.    \"Oh, my, suz dud and a bottle of milk!\" exclaimed the old gentleman  rabbit. \"I hope that isn't the scary-flary alligator again.\"    So he peeped out of the window, but to his surprise, he didn't see any  one.    \"I'm sure I heard a knock,\" he said, \"but I guess I was mistaken.\"    Well, he was going over to his valise to see if it had in it anything to  eat, when the knock again sounded on the door.    \"No, I wasn't mistaken,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"I wonder who that can be?  I'll peep, and find out.\"    So he hid behind the window curtain, and kept a close watch, and the first  things he saw were some little stones flying through the air. And they hit  against the front door with a rattlety-bang, and it was these stones that  had made the sound that was like a knock.    \"Oh! it must be some bad boys after me,\" thought the poor old gentleman  rabbit. \"My! I do seem to be having a dreadful time seeking my fortune.  There is always some kind of trouble.\"    And then more stones came through the air, and banged on the door and this  time Uncle Wiggily saw that they came from the stream, and, what is more,  he saw the goldfish throwing the stones and pebbles out of the brook with  his tail. Then the rabbit knew it was all right, for the goldfish was a  friend of his, so he ran out.    \"Were you throwing stones at the house?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.    \"Yes,\" replied the fish, \"it was the only way in which I could knock on  your door. You see I dare not leave the water, and I wanted you to know  that I had some breakfast for you.\"    And with that the kind goldfish took a little basket, made of watercress,  from off his left front fin, and handed Uncle Wiggily the basket, not his  fin, for he needed that to swim with.    \"You'll find some cabbage-salad with snorkery-snickery ell-grass dressing  on it, some water-lily cake, and some moss covered eggs for your  breakfast,\" said the fish. \"And I wish you good luck on your travels  to-day.\"    \"Thank you very much,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"and I am very much obliged to  you for saving me from the alligator last night.\"    \"Pray do not mention it,\" spoke the fish most condescendingly. \"I always  like to help my friends.\" And with that he swam away, and Uncle Wiggily  ate his breakfast, and then, taking his crutch and valise, he set off on  his travels again.    He hopped on for some time, and finally he came to a place where there  were some high, prickly bramble-briar bushes.    \"I will rest here in their shade a bit,\" thought the old gentleman rabbit,  \"and then I will go on.\"    So he sat down, and, as the sun was quite warm, he fell asleep before he  knew it. But he was suddenly awakened by a hissing sound, just like when  steam comes out of the parlor radiator on a frosty night. Then a voice  cried:    \"Now I've got you!\"    Uncle Wiggily looked up, and there was a big snake, just going to grab  him. But do you s'pose the rabbit waited for that snake? Not a bit of it.  Catching up his crutch and valise, he gave one tremendous and  extraordinary springery-spring, and over the prickery stickery briar and  bramble bushes he went, flying through the air, and the snake couldn't get  him.    But when Uncle Wiggily came down on the other side of the bushes! Oh, my!  that was a different story. For where do you imagine he landed? Where,  indeed, but right in the middle of a big mud pie that two little hedgehog  boys were making there. Yes, sir, right into the middle of that  squasher-squawshery mud pie fell Uncle Wiggily.    Oh! How the mud splashed up! It went all over the rabbit, and some got on  the two little hedgehog boys.    Well, they were as surprised as anything when they saw a nice old  gentleman rabbit come down in the middle of their pie, and at first they  thought he had done it on purpose.    \"Let's stick him full of our stickery-stockery quills,\" said one hedgehog  boy.    \"Yes, and then let's pull his ears,\" said the other hedgehog boy. But,  mind you, they didn't really "]]]
