The wise men of the world teach him; the poets of the  world flatter him; the princes of the world bow to him. He is trained in  all elegant accomplishments; he is led forward through a graceful,  luxurious society. His bearing is that of an emperor; his face is the  face of fine physical beauty. Imagine for yourself the sensual  countenance of a young Bacchus, beautiful as Milton's devils; imagine  him clad in splendor before which even English luxury is mean; arrayed  in jewels, to which even Eastern pomp is tinsel; imagine an expression  of tired hate, of low, brutal lust, hanging on those exquisite  licentious features, and you have before you the type of Roman  civilization. It is the boy just budding into manhood, whom later times  will name as the lowest embodiment of meanness and cruelty! You are  looking upon Nero!    Not only is this man an exact type of the ancient civilization, its  central power, its outside beauty, but the precise time of this sketch  of ours is the exact climax of the _moral_ results of the ancient  civilization. We are to look at Nero just when he has returned to Rome  from a Southern journey.[I] That journey had one object, which  succeeded. To his after-life it gives one memory, which never dies. He  has travelled to his beautiful country palace, that he might kill his  mother!    We can picture to ourselves Agrippina, by knowing that she was Nero's  mother, and our picture will not fail in one feature. She has all the  beauty of sense, all the attraction of passion. Indeed, she is the  Empress of Rome, because she is queen of beauty--and of lust. She is  most beautiful among the beautiful of Rome; but what is that beauty of  feature in a state of whose matrons not one is virtuous, of whose  daughters not one is chaste? It is the beauty of sense alone, fit  adornment of that external grandeur, of that old society.    In the infancy of her son, this beautiful Agrippina consulted a troop of  fortune-tellers as to his fate; and they told her that he would live to  be Emperor of Rome, and to kill his mother. With all the ecstasy of a  mother's pride fused so strangely with all the excess of an ambitious  woman's love of power, she cried in answer, \"He may kill me, if only he  rules Rome!\"[J]    She spoke her own fate in these words.    Here is the account of it by Tacitus. Nero had made all the  preparations; had arranged a barge, that of a sudden its deck might fall  heavily upon those in the cabin, and crush them in an instant. He meant  thus to give to the murder which he planned the aspect of an accident.  To this fatal vessel he led Agrippina. He talked with her affectionately  and gravely on the way; \"and when they parted at the lakeside, with his  old boyish familiarity he pressed her closely to his heart, either to  conceal his purpose, or because the last sight of a mother, on the eve  of death, touched even his cruel nature, and then bade her farewell.\"    Just at the point upon the lake where he had directed, as the Empress  sat in her cabin talking with her attendants, the treacherous deck was  let fall upon them all. But the plot failed. She saw dead at her feet  one of her favorites, crushed by the sudden blow. But she had escaped  it. She saw that death awaited them all upon the vessel. The men around  sprang forward, ready to do their master's bidding in a less clumsy and  more certain way. But the Empress, with one of her attendants, sprang  from the treacherous vessel into the less treacherous waves. And there,  this faithful friend of hers, with a woman's wit and a woman's devotion,  drew on her own head the blows and stabs of the murderers above, by  crying, as if in drowning, \"Save me, I am Nero's mother!\" Uttering those  words of self-devotion, she was killed by the murderers above, while the  Empress, in safer silence, buoyed up by fragments of the wreck, floated  to the shore.    Nero had failed thus in secret crime, and yet he knew that he could not  stop here. And the next day after his mother's deliverance, he sent a  soldier to her palace, with a guard; and there, where she was deserted  even by her last attendant, without pretence of secrecy, they put to  death the daughter and the mother of a Caesar. And Nero only waits to  look with a laugh upon the beauty of the corpse, before he returns to  resume his government at Rome.    That moment was the culminating moment of the ancient civilization. It  is complete in its centralizing power; it is complete in its external  beauty; it is complete in its crime. Beautiful as Eden to the eye, with  luxury, with comfort, with easy indolence to all; but dust and ashes  beneath the surface! It is corrupted at the head! It is corrupted at  the heart! There is nothing firm!    This is the moment which I take for our little picture. At this very  moment there is announced the first germ of the new civilization. In the  very midst of this falsehood, there sounds one voice of truth; in the  very arms of this giant, there plays the baby boy who is to cleave him  to the ground. This Nero slowly returns to the city. He meets the  congratulations of a senate, which thank him and the gods that he has  murdered his own mother. With the agony of an undying conscience  torturing him, he strives to avert care by amusement. He hopes to turn  the mob from despising him by the grandeur of their public  entertainments. He enlarges for them the circus. He calls unheard-of  beasts to be baited and killed for their enjoyment. The finest actors  rant, the sweetest musicians sing, that Nero may forget his mother, and  that his people may forget him.    At that period, the statesmen who direct the machinery of affairs inform  him that his personal attention is required one morning for a state  trial, to be argued before the Emperor in person. Must the Emperor be  there? May he not waste the hours in the blandishments of lying  courtiers, or the honeyed falsehoods of a mistress? If he chooses thus  to postpone the audience, be it so; Seneca, Burrhus, and his other  counsellors will obey. But the time will come when the worn-out boy will  be pleased some morning with the almost forgotten majesty of state. The  time comes one day. Worn out by the dissipation of the week, fretted by  some blunder of his flatterers, he sends for his wiser counsellors, and  bids them lead him to the audience-chamber, where he will attend to  these cases which need an Emperor's decision. It is at that moment that  we are to look upon him.    He sits there, upon that unequalled throne, his face sickly pale with  boyish debauchery; his young fore head worn with the premature sensual  wrinkles of lust; and his eyes bloodshot with last night's intemperance.  He sits there, the Emperor-boy, vainly trying to excite himself, and  forget her, in the blazonry of that pomp, and bids them call in the  prisoner.    A soldier enters, at whose side the prisoner has been chained for years.  This soldier is a tried veteran of the Praetorian cohorts. He was  selected, that from him this criminal could not escape; and for that  purpose they have been inseparably bound. But, as he leads that other  through the hall, he looks at him with a regard and earnestness which  say he is no criminal to him. Long since, the criminal has been the  guardian of his keeper. Long since, the keeper has cared for the  prisoner with all the ardor of a new-found son's affection.    They lead that gray-haired captive forward, and with his eagle eye he  glances keenly round the hall. That flashing eye has ere now bade  monarchs quail; and those thin lips have uttered words which shall make  the world ring till the last moment of the world shall come. The stately  Eastern captive moves unawed through the assembly, till he makes a  subject's salutation to the Emperor-judge who is to hear him. And when,  then, the gray-haired sage kneels before the sensual boy, you see the  prophet of the new civilization kneel before the monarch of the old! You  see Paul make a subject's formal reverence to Nero![K]    Let me do justice to the court which is to try him. In that  judgment-hall there are not only the pomp of Rome, and its crime; we  have also the best of its wisdom. By the dissolute boy, Nero, there  stands the prime minister Seneca, the chief of the philosophers of his  time; \"Seneca the saint,\" cry the Christians of the next century. We  will own him to be Seneca the wise, Seneca almost the good. To this sage  had been given the education of the monster who was to rule the world.  This sage had introduced him into power, had restrained his madness when  he could, and with his colleague had conducted the general  administration of the Empire with the greatest honor, while the boy was  wearing out his life in debauchery in the palace. Seneca dared say more  to Nero, to venture more with him, than did any other man. For the young  tiger was afraid of his old master long after he had tasted blood. Yet  Seneca's system was a cowardly system. It was the best of Roman morality  and Greek philosophy, and still it was mean. His daring was the bravest  of the men of the old civilization. He is the type of their  excellences, as is Nero the model of their power and their adornments.  And yet all that Seneca's daring could venture was to seduce the  baby-tyrant into the least injurious of tyrannies. From the plunder of a  province he would divert him by the carnage of the circus. From the  murder of a senator he could lure him by some new lust at home. From the  ruin of the Empire, he could seduce him by diverting him with the ruin  of a noble family. And Seneca did this with the best of motives. He said  he used all the power in his hands, and he thought he did. He was one of  those men of whom all times have their share. The bravest of his time,  he satisfied himself with alluring the beardless Emperor by petty crime  from public wrong; he could flatter him to the expedient. He dared not  order him to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15869"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World Volume 2 (#15)"],[1,"boom, and hoisted to a short mast. Some of the large canoes have  two sails, and all of them outriggers.    At first we thought the people of this island, as well as those of  Erromango, were a race between the natives of the Friendly Islands and  those of Mallicollo; but a little acquaintance with them convinced us that  they had little or no affinity to either, except it be in their hair, which  is much like what the people of the latter island have. The general colours  of it are black and brown, growing to a tolerable length, and very crisp  and curly. They separate it into small locks, which they woold or cue round  with the rind of a slender plant, down to about an inch of the ends; and,  as the hair grows, the woolding is continued. Each of these cues or locks  is somewhat thicker than common whipcord; and they look like a parcel of  small strings hanging down from the crown of their heads. Their beards,  which are strong and bushy, are generally short. The women do not wear  their hair so, but cropped; nor do the boys, till they approach manhood.  Some few men, women, and children, were seen, who had hair like ours; but  it was obvious that these were of another nation; and, I think, we  understood they came from Erronan. It is to this island they ascribe one of  the two languages which they speak, and which is nearly, if not exactly,  the same as that spoken in the Friendly Islands. It is therefore more than  probable that Erronan was peopled from that nation, and that by long  intercourse with Tanna and the other neighbouring islands, each had learnt  the other's language, which they use indiscriminately.    The other language which the people of Tanna speak, and, as we understood,  those of Erromango and Annatom, is properly their own. It is different from  any we had before met with, and bears no affinity to that of Mallicollo; so  that, it should seem, the people of these islands are a distinct nation of  themselves. Mallicollo, Apee, etc. were names entirely unknown to them; they  even knew nothing of Sandwich Island, which is much nearer. I took no small  pains to know how far their geographical knowledge extended; and did not  find that it exceeded the limits of their horizon.    These people are of the middle size, rather slender than otherwise; many  are little, but few tall or stout; the most of them have good features, and  agreeable countenances; are, like all the tropical race, active and nimble;  and seem to excel in the use of arms, but not to be fond of labour. They  never would put a hand to assist in any work we were carrying on, which the  people of the other islands used to delight in. Bat what I judge most from,  is their making the females do the most laborious work, as if they were  pack-horses. I have seen a woman carrying a large bundle on her back, or a  child on her back and a bundle under her arm, and a fellow strutting before  her with nothing but a club or spear, or some such thing. We have  frequently observed little troops of women pass, to and fro, along the  beach, laden with fruit and roots, escorted by a party of men under arms;  though, now and then, we have seen a man carry a burden at the same time,  but not often. I know not on what account this was done, nor that an armed  troop was necessary. At first, we thought they were moving out of the  neighbourhood with their effects, but we afterwards saw them both carry  out, and bring in, every day.    I cannot say the women are beauties, but I think them handsome enough for  the men, and too handsome for the use that is made of them. Both sexes are  of a very dark colour, but not black; nor have they the least  characteristic of the negro about them. They make themselves blacker than  they really are, by painting their faces with a pigment of the colour of  black-lead. They also use another sort which is red, and a third sort  brown, or a colour between red and black. All these, but especially the  first, they lay on with a liberal hand, not only on the face, but on the  neck, shoulders, and breast. The men wear nothing but a belt, and the  wrapping leaf as at Mallicollo. The women have a kind of petticoat made of  the filaments of the plantain-tree, flags, or some such thing, which  reaches below the knee. Both sexes wear ornaments, such as bracelets,  ear-rings, necklaces, and amulets. The bracelets are chiefly worn by the men;  some made of sea-shells, and others of those of the cocoa-nut. The men also  wear amulets; and those of most value being made of a greenish stone, the  green stone of New Zealand is valued by them for this purpose. Necklaces  are chiefly used by the women, and made mostly of shells. Ear-rings are  common to both sexes, and those valued most are made of tortoise-shell.  Some of our people having got some at the Friendly Islands, brought it to a  good market here, where it was of more value than any thing we had besides;  from which I conclude that these people catch but few turtle, though I saw  one in the harbour, just as we were getting under sail. I observed that,  towards the latter end of our stay, they began to ask for hatchets, and  large nails, so that it is likely they had found that iron is more  serviceable than stone, bone, or shells, of which all their tools I have  seen are made. Their stone hatchets, at least all those I saw, are not in  the shape of adzes, as at the other islands, but more like an axe. In the  helve, which is pretty thick, is made a hole into which the stone is fixed.    These people, besides the cultivation of ground, have few other arts worth  mentioning. They know how to make a coarse kind of matting, and a coarse  cloth of the bark of a tree, which is used chiefly for belts. The  workmanship of their canoes, I have before observed, is very rude; and  their arms, with which they take the most pains in point of neatness, come  far short of some others we have seen. Their weapons are clubs, spears or  darts, bows and arrows, and stones. The clubs are of three or four kinds,  and from three to five feet long. They seem to place most dependence on the  darts, which are pointed with three bearded edges. In throwing them they  make use of a becket, that is, a piece of stiff plaited cord about six  inches long, with an eye in one end and a knot at the other. The eye is  fixed on the fore-finger of the right hand, and the other end is hitched  round the dart, where it is nearly on an equipoise. They hold the dart  between the thumb and remaining fingers, which serve only to give it  direction, the velocity being communicated by the becket and fore-finger.  The former flies off from the dart the instant its velocity becomes greater  than that of the hand. But it remains on the finger ready to be used again.  With darts they kill both birds and fish, and are sure of hitting a mark,  within the compass of the crown of a hat, at the distance of eight or ten  yards; but, at double that distance, it is chance if they hit a mark the  size of a man's body, though they will throw the weapon sixty or seventy  yards. They always throw with all their might, let the distance be what it  will. Darts, bows and arrows are to them what musquets are to us. The  arrows are made of reeds pointed with hard wood; some are bearded and some  not, and those for shooting birds have two, three, and sometimes four  points. The stones they use are, in general, the branches of coral rocks  from eight to fourteen inches long, and from an inch to an inch-and-half in  diameter. I know not if they employ them as missive weapons; almost every  one of them carries a club, and besides that, either darts, or a bow and  arrows, but never both; those who had stones kept them generally in their  belts.    I cannot conclude this account of their arms without adding an entire  passage out of Mr Wales's journal. As this gentleman was continually on  shore amongst them, he had a better opportunity of seeing what they could  perform, than any of us. The passage is as follows: \"I must confess I have  been often led to think the feats which Homer represents his heroes as  performing with their spears, a little too much of the marvellous to be  admitted into an heroic poem; I mean when confined within the strait stays  of Aristotle. Nay, even so great an advocate for him as Mr Pope,  acknowledges them to be _surprising_. But since I have seen what these  people can do with their wooden spears, and them badly pointed, and not of  a very hard nature, I have not the least exception to any one passage in  that great poet on this account. But, if I see fewer exceptions, I can find  infinitely more beauties in him; as he has, I think, scarce an action,  circumstance, or description of any kind whatever, relating to a spear,  which I have not seen and recognised among these people; as their whirling  motion, and whistling noise, as they fly; their quivering motion, as they  stick in the ground when they fall; their meditating their aim, when they  are going to throw, and their shaking them in their hand as they go along,  etc. etc.\"    I know no more of their cookery, than that it consists of roasting and  baking; for they have no vessel in which water can be boiled. Nor do I know  that they have any other liquor but water and the juice of the cocoa-nut.    We are utter strangers to their religion; and but little acquainted with  their government. They seem to have chiefs among them; at least some were  pointed out to us by that title; but, as I before observed, they appeared  to have very little authority over the rest of the people. Old Geogy was  the only one the people were ever seen to take the least notice of; but  whether this was owing to high rank or old age, I cannot say. On several  occasions I have seen the old men respected and obeyed. Our friend Paowang  was so; and yet I never heard him called chief, and have many reasons to  believe that he had not a right to any more authority than many of his"]]]
