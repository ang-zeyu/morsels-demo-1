They passed their time in  Paradise, in a Rose Garden, _Xochitlycacan_ (\"where the roses are lifted  up\"); but on a time they began plucking the roses from the great Rose tree  in the centre of the garden, and Tonaca-tecutli, in his anger at their  action, hurled them to the earth, where they lived as mortals.    The significance of this myth, as applied to the daily descent of sun and  stars from the zenith to the horizon, is too obvious to need special  comment; and the coincidences of the rose garden on the mountain (in the  one instance the Hill of Heaven, in the other a supposed terrestrial  elevation) from which Quetzalcoatl issues, and the anger of the parent,  seem to indicate that the supposed historical relation of Ixtlilxochitl is  but a myth dressed in historic garb.    The second cycle of legends disclaimed any miraculous parentage for the  hero of Tollan. Las Casas narrates his arrival from the East, from some  part of Yucatan, he thinks, with a few followers,[1] a tradition which is  also repeated with definitiveness by the native historian, Alva  Ixtlilxochitl, but leaving the locality uncertain.[2] The historian,  Veytia, on the other hand, describes him as arriving from the North, a  full grown man, tall of stature, white of skin, and full-bearded,  barefooted and bareheaded, clothed in a long white robe strewn with red  crosses, and carrying a staff in his hand.[3]    [Footnote 1: Torquemada, _Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. vi, cap. xxiv. This was  apparently the canonical doctrine in Cholula. Mendieta says: \"El dios o  idolo de Cholula, llamado Quetzalcoatl, fue el mas celebrado y tenido por  mejor y mas digno sobre los otro dioses, segun la reputacion de todos.  Este, segun sus historias (aunque algunos digan que de Tula) vino de las  partes de Yucatan a la ciudad de Cholula.\" _Historia Eclesiastica  Indiana_, Lib. ii, cap. x.]    [Footnote 2: _Historia Chichimeca_, cap. i.]    [Footnote 3: _Historia_, cap. xv.]    Whatever the origin of Quetzalcoatl, whether the child of a miraculous  conception, or whether as an adult stranger he came from some far-off  land, all accounts agree as to the greatness and purity of his character,  and the magnificence of Tollan under his reign. His temple was divided  into four apartments, one toward the East, yellow with gold; one toward  the West, blue with turquoise and jade; one toward the South, white with  pearls and shells, and one toward the North, red with bloodstones; thus  symbolizing the four cardinal points and four quarters of the world over  which the light holds sway.[1]    [Footnote 1: Sahagun, Lib. ix, cap. xxix.]    Through the midst of Tollan flowed a great river, and upon or over this  river was the house of Quetzalcoatl. Every night at midnight he descended  into this river to bathe, and the place of his bath was called, In the  Painted Vase, or, In the Precious Waters.[1] For the Orb of Light dips  nightly into the waters of the World Stream, and the painted clouds of the  sun-setting surround the spot of his ablutions.    [Footnote 1: The name of the bath of Quetzalcoatl is variously given as  _Xicapoyan_, from _xicalli_, vases made from gourds, and _poyan_, to paint  (Sahagun, Lib. iii, cap. iii); _Chalchiuhapan_, from _atl_, water _pan_,  in, and _chalchiuitl_, precious, brilliant, the jade stone (_id._, Lib. x,  cap. xxix); and _Atecpanamochco_, from _atl_, water, _tecpan_, royal,  _amochtli_, any shining white metal, as tin, and the locative _co_, hence,  In the Shining Royal Water (_Anales de Cuauhtitlan_, p. 21). These names  are interesting as illustrating the halo of symbolism which surrounded the  history of the Light-God.]    I have said that the history of Quetzalcoatl in Tollan is but a  continuation of the conflict of the two primal brother gods. It is still  the implacable Tezcatlipoca who pursues and finally conquers him. But  there is this significant difference, that whereas in the elemental  warfare portrayed in the older myth mutual violence and alternate  destruction prevail, in all these later myths Quetzalcoatl makes no effort  at defence, scarcely remonstrates, but accepts his defeat as a decree of  Fate which it is vain to resist. He sees his people fall about him, and  the beautiful city sink into destruction, but he knows it is the hand of  Destiny, and prepares himself to meet the inevitable with what stoicism  and dignity he may.    The one is the quenching of the light by the darkness of the tempest and  the night, represented as a struggle; in the other it is the gradual and  calm but certain and unavoidable extinction of the sun as it noiselessly  sinks to the western horizon.    The story of the subtlety of Tezcatlipoca is variously told. In what may  well be its oldest and simplest version it is said that in his form as  Camaxtli he caught a deer with two heads, which, so long as he kept it,  secured him luck in war; but falling in with one of five goddesses he had  created, he begat a son, and through this act he lost his good fortune.  The son was Quetzalcoatl, surnamed Ce Acatl, and he became Lord of Tollan,  and a famous warrior. For many years he ruled the city, and at last began  to build a very great temple. While engaged in its construction  Tezcatlipoca came to him one day and told him that toward Honduras, in a  place called Tlapallan, a house was ready for him, and he must quit Tollan  and go there to live and die. Quetzalcoatl replied that the heavens and  stars had already warned him that after four years he must go hence, and  that he would obey. The time past, he took with him all the inhabitants of  Tula, and some he left in Cholula, from whom its inhabitants are  descended, and some he placed in the province of Cuzcatan, and others in  Cempoal, and at last he reached Tlapallan, and on the very day he arrived  there, he fell sick and died. As for Tula, it remained without an  inhabitant for nine years.[1]    [Footnote 1: Ramirez de Fuen-leal, _Historia de los Mexicanos por sus  Pinturas_, cap. viii.]    A more minute account is given by the author of the _Annals of  Cuauhtitlan_, a work written at an early date, in the Aztec tongue. He  assures his readers that his narrative of these particular events is  minutely and accurately recorded from the oldest and most authentic  traditions. It is this:--    When those opposed to Quetzalcoatl did not succeed in their designs, they  summoned to their aid a demon or sorcerer, by name Tezcatlipoca, and his  assistants. He said: \"We will give him a drink to dull his reason, and  will show him his own face in a mirror, and surely he will be lost.\" Then  Tezcatlipoca brewed an intoxicating beverage, the _pulque_, from the  maguey, and taking a mirror he wrapped it in a rabbit skin, and went to  the house of Quetzalcoatl.    \"Go tell your master,\" he said to the servants, \"that I have come to show  him his own flesh.\"    \"What is this?\" said Quetzalcoatl, when the message was delivered. \"What  does he call my own flesh? Go and ask him.\"    But Tezcatlipoca refused. \"I have not come to see you, but your master,\"  he said to the servants. Then he was admitted, and Quetzalcoatl said:--    \"Welcome, youth, you have troubled yourself much. Whence come you? What is  this, my flesh, that you would show me?\"    \"My Lord and Priest,\" replied the youth, \"I come from the mountain-side of  Nonoalco. Look, now, at your flesh; know yourself; see yourself as you are  seen of others;\" and with that he handed him the mirror.    As soon as Quetzalcoatl saw his face in the mirror he exclaimed:--    \"How is it possible my subjects can look on me without affright? Well  might they flee from me. How can a man remain among them filled as I am  with foul sores, his face wrinkled and his aspect loathsome? I shall be  seen no more; I shall no longer frighten my people.\"    Then Tezcatlipoca went away to take counsel, and returning, said:--    \"My lord and master, use the skill of your servant. I have come to console  you. Go forth to your people. I will conceal your defects by art.\"    \"Do what you please,\" replied Quetzalcoatl. \"I will see what my fate is to  be.\"    Tezcatlipoca painted his cheeks green and dyed his lips red. The forehead  he colored yellow, and taking feathers of the _quechol_ bird, he arranged  them as a beard. Quetzalcoatl surveyed himself in the mirror, and rejoiced  at his appearance, and forthwith sallied forth to see his people.    Tezcatlipoca withdrew to concoct another scheme of disgrace. With his  attendants he took of the strong _pulque_ which he had brewed, and came  again to the palace of the Lord of Tollan. They were refused admittance  and asked their country. They replied that they were from the Mountain of  the Holy Priest, from the Hill of Tollan. When Quetzalcoatl heard this, he  ordered them to be admitted, and asked their business. They offered him  the _pulque_, but he refused, saying that he was sick, and, moreover, that  it would weaken his judgment and might cause his death. They urged him to  dip but the tip of his finger in it to taste it; he complied, but even so  little of the magic liquor overthrew his self control, and taking the bowl  he quaffed a full draught and was drunk. Then these perverse men ridiculed  him, and cried out:--    \"You feel finely now, my son; sing us a song; sing, worthy priest.\"    Thereupon Quetzalcoatl began to sing, as follows:--    \"My pretty house, my coral house,    I call it Zacuan by name;  And must I leave it, do you say?    Oh my, oh me, and ah for shame.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: The original is--    Quetzal, quetzal, no calli,    Zacuan, no callin tapach  No callin nic yacahuaz    An ya, an ya, an quilmach.    Literally--    Beautiful, beautiful (is) my house    Zacuan, my house of coral;  My house, I must leave it.    Alas, alas, they say.    Zacuan, instead of being a proper name, may mean a rich yellow leather  from the bird called "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],[0,"A Woman's Journey Round the World (#15)"],[1," gold-washings in the river of the same name,  and not far from them, diamonds also are found.  Since seeking or  digging for diamonds is no longer an imperial monopoly, every one is  at liberty to employ himself in this occupation, and yet it is  exercised as much as possible in secret.  No one will acknowledge  looking for them, in order to avoid paying the State its share as  fixed by law.  The precious stones are sought for and dug out at  certain spots, from heaps of sand, stones, and soil, which have been  washed down by the heavy rains.    I had found lodgings in a venda for the last time, the preceding  evening, at Canto Gallo.  I had now to rely upon the hospitality of  the proprietors of the fazendas.  Custom requires that, on reaching  a fazenda, any person who desires to stop the middle of the day or  the night there, should wait outside and ask, through the servant,  permission to do so.  It is not until his application is granted,  which is almost always the case, that the traveller dismounts from  his mule, and enters the building.    They received me at the Fazenda of Boa Esperanza in the most  friendly manner, and, as I happened to arrive exactly at dinner-time  (it was between 3 and 4 o'clock), covers were immediately laid for  me and my attendant.  The dishes were numerous, and prepared very  nearly in the European fashion.    Great astonishment was manifested in every venda and fazenda at  seeing a lady arrive accompanied only by a single servant.  The  first question was, whether I was not afraid thus to traverse the  woods alone; and my guide was invariably taken on one side, and  questioned as to way I travelled.  As he was in the habit of seeing  me collect flowers and insects, he supposed me to be a naturalist,  and replied that my journey had a scientific object.    After dinner, the amiable lady of the house proposed that I should  go and see the coffee-plantations, warehouses, etc.; and I willingly  accepted her offer, as affording me an opportunity of viewing the  manner in which the coffee was prepared, from beginning to end.    The mode of gathering it I have already described.  When this is  done, the coffee is spread out upon large plots of ground, trodden  down in a peculiar manner, and enclosed by low stone walls, scarcely  a foot high, with little drain-holes in them, to allow of the water  running off in case of rain.  On these places the coffee is dried by  the glowing heat of the sun, and then shaken in large stone mortars,  ten or twenty of which are placed beneath a wooden scaffolding, from  which wooden hammers, set in motion by water power, descend into the  mortars, and easily crush the husks.  The mass, thus crushed, is  then placed in wooden boxes, fastened in the middle of a long table,  and having small openings at each side, through which both the berry  itself and the husk fall slowly out.  At the table are seated  negroes, who separate the berry from the husk, and then cast it into  shallow copper cauldrons, which are easily heated.  In these it is  carefully turned, and remains until it is quite dried.  This last  process requires some degree of care, as the colour of the coffee  depends upon the degree of heat to which it is exposed; if dried too  quickly, instead of the usual greenish colour, it contracts a  yellowish tinge.    On the whole, the preparation of coffee is not fatiguing, and even  the gathering of it is far from being as laborious as reaping is  with us.  The negro stands in an upright posture when gathering the  berry, and is protected by the tree itself against the great heat of  the sun.  The only danger he incurs is of being bitten by some  venomous snake or other--an accident, however, which, fortunately,  rarely happens.    The work on a sugar-plantation, on the contrary, is said to be  exceedingly laborious, particularly that portion of it which relates  to weeding the ground and cutting the cane.  I have never yet  witnessed a sugar-harvest, but, perhaps, may do so in the course of  my travels.    All work ceases at sunset, when the negroes are drawn up in front of  their master's house for the purpose of being counted, and then,  after a short prayer, have their supper, consisting of boiled beans,  bacon, carna secca, and manioc flour, handed out to them.    At sunrise, they again assemble, are once more counted, and, after  prayers and breakfast, go to work.    I had an opportunity of convincing myself in this, as well as in  many other fazendas, vendas, and private houses, that the slaves are  by far not so harshly treated as we Europeans imagine.  They are not  overworked, perform all their duties very leisurely, and are well  kept.  Their children are frequently the playmates of their master's  children, and knock each other about as if they were all equal.  There may be cases in which certain slaves are cruelly and  undeservedly punished; but do not the like instances of injustice  occur in Europe also?    I am certainly very much opposed to slavery, and should greet its  abolition with the greatest delight, but, despite this, I again  affirm that the negro slave enjoys, under the protection of the law,  a better lot than the free fellah of Egypt, or many peasants in  Europe, who still groan under the right of soccage.  The principal  reason of the better lot of the slave, compared to that of the  miserable peasant, in the case in point, may perhaps partly be, that  the purchase and keep of the one is expensive, while the other costs  nothing.    The arrangements in the houses belonging to the proprietors of the  fazendas are extremely simple.  The windows are unglazed, and are  closed at night with wooden shutters.  In many instances, the outer  roof is the common covering of all the rooms, which are merely  separated from one another by low partitions, so that you can hear  every word your neighbour says, and almost the breathing of the  person sleeping next to you.  The furniture is equally simple:  a  large table, a few straw sofas, and a few chairs.  The wearing  apparel is generally hung up against the walls; the linen alone  being kept in tin cases, to protect it from the attacks of the ants.    In the country, the children of even the most opulent persons run  about frequently without shoes or stockings.  Before they go to bed  they have their feet examined to see whether any sand-fleas have  nestled in them; and if such be the case, they are extracted by the  elder negro children.    9th October.  Early in the morning I took leave of my kind hostess,  who, like a truly careful housewife, had wrapped up a roasted fowl,  manioc flour, and a cheese for me, so that I was well provisioned on  setting off.    The next station, Aldea do Pedro, on the banks of the Parahyby, was  situated at a distance of sixteen miles.  Our way lay through  magnificent woods, and before we had traversed half of it, we  arrived at the river Parahyby, one of the largest in the Brazils,  and celebrated, moreover, for the peculiar character of its bed,  which is strewed with innumerable cliffs and rocks; these, owing to  the low state of the stream, were more than usually conspicuous.  On  every side rose little islands, covered with small trees or  underwood, lending a most magic appearance to the river.  During the  rainy season, most of these cliffs and rocks are covered with water,  and the river then appears more majestic.  On account of the rocks  it can only be navigated by small boats and rafts.    As you proceed along the banks, the scenery gradually changes.  The  fore-part of the mountain ranges subside into low hills, the  mountains themselves retreat, and the nearer you approach Aldea do  Pedro, the wider and more open becomes the valley.  In the  background alone are still visible splendid mountain ranges, from  which rises a mountain higher than the rest, somewhat more naked,  and almost isolated.  To this my guide pointed, and gave me to  understand that our way lay over it, in order to reach the Puris,  who lived beyond.    About noon I arrived at Aldea do Pedro, which I found to be a small  village with a stone church; the latter might, perhaps, contain 200  persons.  I had intended continuing my journey to the Puris the same  day, but my guide was attacked with pains in his knee, and could not  ride further.  I had, therefore, no resource but to alight at the  priest's, who gave me a hearty welcome; he had a pretty good house,  immediately adjoining the church.    10th October.  As my guide was worse, the priest offered me his  negro to replace him.  I thankfully accepted his offer, but could  not set off before 1 o'clock, for which I was, in some respects, not  sorry, as it was Sunday, and I hoped to see a great number of the  country people flock to mass.  This, however, was not the case;  although it was a very fine day there were hardly thirty people at  church.  The men were dressed exactly in the European fashion; the  women wore long cloaks with collars, and had white handkerchiefs  upon their heads, partly falling over their faces as well; the  latter they uncovered in church.  Both men and women were  barefooted.    As chance would have it, I witnessed a burial and a christening.  Before mass commenced, a boat crossed over from the opposite bank of  the Parahyby, and on reaching the side, a hammock, in which was the  deceased, was lifted out.  He was then laid in a coffin which had  been prepared for the purpose in a house near the churchyard.  The  corpse was enveloped in a white cloth, with the feet and half the  head protruding beyond it; the latter was covered with a peaked cap  of shining black cloth.    The christening took place before the burial.  The person who was to  be christened was a young negro of fifteen, who stood with his  mother at the church door.  As the priest entered the church to  perform mass, he christened him, in passing by, without much  ceremony or solemnity, and even without sponsors; the"]]]
