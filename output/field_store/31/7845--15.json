The very bones thereof are full  of marrow, yea and charged with memories of the happy past. Fried fish  binds Anglo-Judaea more than all the lip-professions of unity. Its savor  is early known of youth, and the divine flavor, endeared by a thousand  childish recollections, entwined with the most sacred associations,  draws back the hoary sinner into the paths of piety. It is on fried  fish, mayhap, that the Jewish matron grows fat. In the days of the  Messiah, when the saints shall feed off the Leviathan; and the Sea  Serpent shall be dished up for the last time, and the world and the  silly season shall come to an end, in those days it is probable that the  saints will prefer their Leviathan fried. Not that any physical frying  will be necessary, for in those happy times (for whose coming every  faithful Israelite prays three times a day), the Leviathan will have  what taste the eater will. Possibly a few highly respectable saints, who  were fashionable in their day and contrived to live in Kensington  without infection of paganism, will take their Leviathan in conventional  courses, and beginning with _hors d'oeuvres_ may _will_ him everything  by turns and nothing long; making him soup and sweets, joint and  _entree_, and even ices and coffee, for in the millennium the harassing  prohibition which bars cream after meat will fall through. But, however  this be, it is beyond question that the bulk of the faithful will  mentally fry him, and though the Christian saints, who shall be  privileged to wait at table, hand them plate after plate, fried fish  shall be all the fare. One suspects that Hebrews gained the taste in the  Desert of Sinai, for the manna that fell there was not monotonous to the  palate as the sciolist supposes, but likewise mutable under volition. It  were incredible that Moses, who gave so many imperishable things to his  people, did not also give them the knowledge of fried fish, so that they  might obey his behest, and rejoice, before the Lord. Nay, was it not  because, while the manna fell, there could be no lack of fish to fry,  that they lingered forty years in a dreary wilderness? Other delicious  things there are in Jewish cookery--_Lockschen_, which are the  apotheosis of vermicelli, _Ferfel_, which are _Lockschen_ in an atomic  state, and _Creplich_, which are triangular meat-pasties, and _Kuggol_,  to which pudding has a far-away resemblance; and there is even _gefuellte  Fisch_, which is stuffed fish without bones--but fried fish reigns above  all in cold, unquestioned sovereignty. No other people possesses the  recipe. As a poet of the commencement of the century sings:        The Christians are ninnies, they can't fry Dutch plaice,      Believe me, they can't tell a carp from a dace.    It was while discussing a deliciously brown oblong of the Dutch plaice  of the ballad that Samuel Levine appeared to be struck by an idea. He  threw down his knife and fork and exclaimed in Hebrew. \"_Shemah beni_!\"    Every one looked at him.    \"Hear, my son!\" he repeated in comic horror. Then relapsing into  English, he explained. \"I've forgotten to give Leah a present from her  _chosan_.\"    \"A-h-h!\" Everybody gave a sigh of deep interest; Leah, whom the  exigencies of service had removed from his side to the head of the  table, half-rose from her seat in excitement.    Now, whether Samuel Levine had really forgotten, or whether he had  chosen the most effective moment will never be known; certain it is that  the Semitic instinct for drama was gratified within him as he drew a  little folded white paper out of his waistcoat pocket, amid the keen  expectation of the company.    \"This,\" said he, tapping the paper as if he were a conjurer, \"was  purchased by me yesterday morning for my little girl. I said to myself,  says I, look here, old man, you've got to go up to town for a day in  honor of Ezekiel Phillips, and your poor girl, who had looked forward to  your staying away till Passover, will want some compensation for her  disappointment at seeing you earlier. So I thinks to myself, thinks I,  now what is there that Leah would like? It must be something  appropriate, of course, and it mustn't be of any value, because I can't  afford it. It's a ruinous business getting engaged; the worst bit of  business I ever did in all my born days.\" Here Sam winked facetiously at  the company. \"And I thought and thought of what was the cheapest thing I  could get out of it with, and lo and behold I suddenly thought of a  ring.\"    So saying, Sam, still with the same dramatic air, unwrapped the thick  gold ring and held it up so that the huge diamond in it sparkled in the  sight of all. A long \"O--h--h\" went round the company, the majority  instantaneously pricing it mentally, and wondering at what reduction Sam  had acquired it from a brother commercial. For that no Jew ever pays  full retail price for jewelry is regarded as axiomatic. Even the  engagement ring is not required to be first-hand--or should it be  first-finger?--so long as it is solid; which perhaps accounts for the  superiority of the Jewish marriage-rate. Leah rose entirely to her feet,  the light of the diamond reflected in her eager eyes. She leant across  the table, stretching out a finger to receive her lover's gift. Sam put  the ring near her finger, then drew it away teasingly.    \"Them as asks shan't have,\" he said, in high good humor. \"You're too  greedy. Look at the number of rings you've got already.\" The fun of the  situation diffused itself along the table.    \"Give it me,\" laughed Miriam Hyams, stretching out her finger. \"I'll say  'ta' so nicely.\"    \"No,\" he said, \"you've been naughty; I'm going to give it to the little  girl who has sat quiet all the time. Miss Hannah Jacobs, rise to receive  your prize.\"    Hannah, who was sitting two places to the left of him, smiled quietly,  but went on carving her fish. Sam, growing quite boisterous under the  appreciation of a visibly amused audience, leaned towards her, captured  her right hand, and forcibly adjusted the ring on the second finger,  exclaiming in Hebrew, with mock solemnity, \"Behold, thou art consecrated  unto me by this ring according to the Law of Moses and Israel.\"    It was the formal marriage speech he had learnt up for his approaching  marriage. The company roared with laughter, and pleasure and enjoyment  of the fun made Leah's lovely, smiling cheeks flush to a livelier  crimson. Badinage flew about from one end of the table to the other:  burlesque congratulations were showered on the couple, flowing over even  unto Mrs. Jacobs, who appeared to enjoy the episode as much as if her  daughter were really off her hands. The little incident added the last  touch of high spirits to the company and extorted all their latent  humor. Samuel excelled himself in vivacious repartee, and responded  comically to the toast of his health as drunk in coffee. Suddenly, amid  the hubbub of chaff and laughter and the clatter of cutlery, a still  small voice made itself heard. It same from old Hyams, who had been  sitting quietly with brow corrugated under his black velvet _koppel_.    \"Mr. Levine,\" he said, in low grave tones, \"I have been thinking, and I  am afraid that what you have done is serious.\"    The earnestness of his tones arrested the attention of the company. The  laughter ceased.    \"What do you mean?\" said Samuel. He understood the Yiddish which old  Hyams almost invariably used, though he did not speak it himself.  Contrariwise, old Hyams understood much more English than he spoke.    \"You have married Hannah Jacobs.\"    There was a painful silence, dim recollections surging in everybody's  brain.    \"Married Hannah Jacobs!\" repeated Samuel incredulously.    \"Yes,\" affirmed old Hyams. \"What you have done constitutes a marriage  according to Jewish law. You have pledged yourself to her in the  presence of two witnesses.\"    There was another tense silence. Samuel broke it with a boisterous  laugh.    \"No, no, old fellow,\" he said; \"you don't have me like that!\"    The tension was relaxed. Everybody joined in the laugh with a feeling of  indescribable relief. Facetious old Hyams had gone near scoring one.  Hannah smilingly plucked off the glittering bauble from her finger and  slid it on to Leah's. Hyams alone remained grave. \"Laugh away!\" he  said. \"You will soon find I am right. Such is our law.\"    \"May be,\" said Samuel, constrained to seriousness despite himself. \"But  you forget that I am already engaged to Leah.\"    \"I do not forget it,\" replied Hyams, \"but it has nothing to do with the  case. You are both single, or rather you _were_ both single, for now you  are man and wife.\"    Leah, who had been sitting pale and agitated, burst into tears. Hannah's  face was drawn and white. Her mother looked the least alarmed of the  company.    \"Droll person!\" cried Malka, addressing Sam angrily in jargon. \"What  hast thou done?\"    \"Don't let us all go mad,\" said Samuel, bewildered. \"How can a piece of  fun, a joke, be a valid marriage?\"    \"The law takes no account of jokes,\" said old Hyams solemnly.    \"Then why didn't you stop me?\" asked Sam, exasperated.    \"It was all done in a moment. I laughed myself; I had no time to think.\"    Sam brought his fist down on the table with a bang.    \"Well, I'll never believe this! If this is Judaism----!\"    \"Hush!\" said Malka angrily. \"These are your English Jews, who make mock  of holy things. I always said the son of a proselyte was----\"    \"Look here, mother,\" put in Michael soothingly. \"Don't let us make a  fuss before we know the truth. Send for some one who is likely to know.\"  He played agitatedly with his complex pocket-knife.    \"Yes, Hannah's father, Reb Shemuel is just the man,\" cried Milly  Phillips.    \"I told you my husband was gone to Manchester for a day or two,\" Mrs.  Jacobs reminded her.    \"There's the _Maggid_ of the Sons of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1271"],[0,"Bygone Beliefs: Being a Series of Excursions in the Byways of Thought (#15)"],[1,". If there is anything of value for modern  thought in the theory of magic, here is it to be found; and it is, I  think, indeed to be found, absurd and fantastic though the practices  based upon this philosophy, or which this philosophy was thought to  substantiate, most certainly are. I shall here endeavour to give a  sketch of certain of the outstanding doctrines of magical philosophy,  some details concerning the art of magic, more especially as practiced  in the Middle Ages in Europe, and, finally, an attempt to extract from  the former what I consider to be of real worth. We have already wandered  down many of the byways of magical belief, and, indeed, the word \"magic\"  may be made to cover almost every superstition of the past: To what we  have already gained on previous excursions the present, I hope, will add  what we need in order to take a synthetic view of the whole subject.      (2) EDWARD CLODD: _Animism the Seed of Religion_ (1905), p. 26.      In the first place, something must be said concerning what is called the  Doctrine of Emanations, a theory of prime importance in Neo-Platonic  and Kabalistic ontology. According to this theory, everything in the  universe owes its existence and virtue to an emanation from God, which  divine emanation is supposed to descend, step by step (so to speak),  through the hierarchies of angels and the stars, down to the things of  earth, that which is nearer to the Source containing more of the divine  nature than that which is relatively distant. As CORNELIUS AGRIPPA  expresses it: \"For God, in the first place is the end and beginning  of all Virtues; he gives the seal of #the _Ideas_ to his servants, the  Intelligences; who as faithful officers, sign all things intrusted  to them with an Ideal Virtue; the Heavens and Stars, as instruments,  disposing the matter in the mean while for the receiving of those forms  which reside in Divine Majesty (as saith Plato in Timeus) and to be  conveyed by Stars; and the Giver of Forms distributes them by the  ministry of his Intelligences, which he hath set as Rulers and  Controllers over his Works, to whom such a power is intrusted to things  committed to them that so all Virtues of Stones, Herbs, Metals, and all  other things may come from the Intelligences, the Governors. The Form,  therefore, and Virtue of things comes first from the _Ideas_, then from  the ruling and governing Intelligences, then from the aspects of the  Heavens disposing, and lastly from the tempers of the Elements  disposed, answering the influences of the Heavens, by which the  Elements themselves are ordered, or disposed. These kinds of operations,  therefore, are performed in these inferior things by express forms,  and in the Heavens by disposing virtues, in Intelligences by mediating  rules, in the Original Cause by _Ideas_ and exemplary forms, all which  must of necessity agree in the execution of the effect and virtue of  every thing.    \"There is, therefore, a wonderful virtue and operation in every Herb  and Stone, but greater in a Star, beyond which, even from the governing  Intelligences everything receiveth and obtains many things for itself,  especially from the Supreme Cause, with whom all things do mutually and  exactly correspond, agreeing in an harmonious consent, as it were in  hymns always praising the highest Maker of all things.... There  is, therefore, no other cause of the necessity of effects than the  connection of all things with the First Cause, and their correspondency  with those Divine patterns and eternal _Ideas_ whence every thing hath  its determinate and particular place in the exemplary world, from whence  it lives and receives its original being: And every virtue of herbs,  stones, metals, animals, words and speeches, and all things that are of  God, is placed there.\"(1) As compared with the _ex nihilo_ creationism  of orthodox theology, this theory is as light is to darkness. Of  course, there is much in CORNELIUS AGRIPPA'S statement of it which is  inacceptable to modern thought; but these are matters of form merely,  and do not affect the doctrine fundamentally. For instance, as a nexus  between spirit and matter AGRIPPA places the stars: modern thought  prefers the ether. The theory of emanations may be, and was, as a  matter of fact, made the justification of superstitious practices of the  grossest absurdity, but on the other hand it may be made the basis of  a lofty system of transcendental philosophy, as, for instance, that of  EMANUEL SWEDENBORG, whose ontology resembles in some respects that of  the Neo-Platonists. AGRIPPA uses the theory to explain all the marvels  which his age accredited, marvels which we know had for the most part no  existence outside of man's imagination. I suggest, on the contrary, that  the theory is really needed to explain the commonplace, since, in the  last analysis, every bit of experience, every phenomenon, be it ever  so ordinary--indeed the very fact of experience itself,--is most truly  marvellous and magical, explicable only in terms of spirit. As ELIPHAS  LEVI well says in one of his flashes of insight: \"The supernatural  is only the natural in an extraordinary grade, or it is the exalted  natural; a miracle is a phenomenon which strikes the multitude because  it is unexpected; the astonishing is that which astonishes; miracles are  effects which surprise those who are ignorant of their causes, or assign  them causes w hich are not in proportion to such effects.\"(1b) But I am  anticipating the sequel.      (1) H. C. AGRIPPA: _Occult Philosophy_, bk. i., chap. xiii. (WHITEHEAD'S  edition, pp. 67-68).    (1b) ELIPHAS LEVI: _Transcendental Magic, its Doctrine and Ritual_  (trans. by A. E. WAITE, 1896), p. 192.      The doctrine of emanations makes the universe one vast harmonious whole,  between whose various parts there is an exact analogy, correspondence,  or sympathetic relation. \"Nature\" (the productive principle), says  IAMBLICHOS (3rd-4th century), the Neo-Platonist, \"in her peculiar way,  makes a likeness of invisible principles through symbols in visible  forms.\"(2) The belief that seemingly similar things sympathetically  affect one another, and that a similar relation holds good between  different things which have been intimately connected with one another  as parts within a whole, is a very ancient one. Most primitive peoples  are very careful to destroy all their nail-cuttings and hair-clippings,  since they believe that a witch gaining possession of these might work  them harm. For a similar reason they refuse to reveal their REAL names,  which they regard as part of themselves, and adopt nicknames for common  use. The belief that a witch can torment an enemy by making an image of  his person in clay or wax, correctly naming it, and mutilating it with  pins, or, in the case of a waxen image, melting it by fire, is a very  ancient one, and was held throughout and beyond the Middle Ages. The  Sympathetic Powder of Sir KENELM DIGBY we have already noticed, as well  as other instances of the belief in \"sympathy,\" and examples of  similar superstitions might be multiplied almost indefinitely. Such are  generally grouped under the term \"sympathetic magic\"; but inasmuch as  all magical practices assume that by acting on part of a thing, or a  symbolic representation of it, one acts magically on the whole, or on  the thing symbolised, the expression may in its broadest sense be said  to involve the whole of magic.      (2) IAMBLICHOS: _Theurgia, or the Egyptian Mysteries_ (trans. by Dr  ALEX. WILDER, New York, 1911), p. 239.      The names of the Divine Being, angels and devils, the planets of the  solar system (including sun and moon) and the days of the week, birds  and beasts, colours, herbs, and precious stones--all, according to  old-time occult philosophy, are connected by the sympathetic relation  believed to run through all creation, the knowledge of which was  essential to the magician; as well, also, the chief portions of the  human body, for man, as we have seen, was believed to be a microcosm--a  universe in miniature. I have dealt with this matter and exhibited  some of the supposed correspondences in \"The Belief in Talismans\".  Some further particulars are shown in the annexed table, for which I  am mainly indebted to AGRIPPA. But, as in the case of the zodiacal gems  already dealt with, the old authorities by no means agree as to the  majority of the planetary correspondences.

In many cases these supposed correspondences are based, as will be  obvious to the reader, upon purely trivial resemblances, and, in any  case, whatever may be said--and I think a great deal may be said--in  favour of the theory of symbology, there is little that may be adduced  to support the old occultists' application of it.    So essential a part does the use of symbols play in all magical  operations that we may, I think, modify the definition of \"magic\"  adopted at the outset, and define \"magic\" as \"an attempt to "]]]
