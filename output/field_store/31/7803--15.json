Gems of  rhythmical verse, such as Poe's \"Bells,\" \"The Raven,\" Whistler's  \"Symphonies in Color,\" nameless forms in statuary, expressionless save in  the mere beauty of their proportions and curves, and, as has been stated,  nearly the entire field of instrumental music, are cases in point. In the  ornamental and decorative arts, as well as in architecture (from which they  are indeed inseparable), beauty alone, in like manner, should be the  principal aim and purpose. In the former, of course, it is indispensable  that such should be the case, as they are entirely subordinate and  accessory in their nature, their only _raison d'etre_ being to beautify or  render more agreeable objects already created for some purpose.    It must not be imagined that such artistic impressions--viz., where the  appeal is made almost solely to the aesthetic sense, regardless of the  reason, judgment, or feelings--are necessarily of a lower order. Their  effect is almost analogous to that which nature herself produces upon  us--the starry heavens, the mighty ocean, the tender flower. The  impression, whether the object belongs to the domain of nature or art, may  be a merely sensuous one; and if it stops there, as it certainly does for  the majority of people, it ranks without doubt far below productions where  the aesthetic element is only used to stimulate and heighten the appeal to  the mind or the feelings. But if it extend beyond, and makes the sensuous  impression but the parting link to the contemplation of ideal, abstract  beauty, without the intermediate aid of the heart or the reason, it is the  shortest and quickest road toward the realization of the infinite, and  makes us indeed feel that it is but a short step \"from nature up to  nature's God.\" Thus architecture, which embodies, more than any other of  the space arts, principles of abstract beauty, has been with reason called  the noblest of them all.    However, ornamental and architectural forms frequently do convey a meaning,  which we term symbolism in art. If this symbolism does not detract from the  first object of ornament--viz., to beautify--it is perfectly legitimate and  proper. It is impossible to fully appreciate many phases of art, as, for  instance, the Egyptian and the early Christian, if we leave out of sight  the symbolism which pervades them.    While beauty, or capacity for pleasing the eye, may be very definitely said  to be the aim of ornamental art, it is difficult to arrive at a universal  standard as to what constitutes beauty. What pleases one person will not  always please another. The child loves glittering objects and gaudy  combinations, which the mature taste of the man declares extravagant and  unharmonious. Savages decorate their weapons, utensils, and their own  persons with ornaments that appear uncouth and barbarous to civilized  people.    Besides these differences in taste, which are due to different degrees of  mental development, and which can consequently be easily disposed of, we  find among highly civilized and cultured nations, at different periods, a  great diversity of tastes. These varying and sometimes apparently  conflicting products of ornamental art we designate as styles, viz.,  Egyptian style, Greek style, Gothic style, etc. So marked are the  differences between them that we can sometimes tell at a glance to what  period and to what style a small fragment of decoration belongs.    Notwithstanding these differences, which at first may appear very great, a  careful study of the best styles--those that achieved the greatest and most  lasting popularity--will reveal the fact that they are all based upon  certain fundamental laws and principles, and that all are good, bad, or  indifferent according as they conform to or violate these principles. These  essentials having been preserved, the opportunities for the exercise of  individual or national taste are almost boundless.    II. _Position of Ornament._--The position that ornament occupies is  necessarily a secondary one, as it cannot exist independently, but is  always applied to objects created for some purpose entirely independent of  their capacity for pleasing. This gives us one of the great underlying  principles that should characterize all ornament, viz., _it must be  subordinate to the object which it adorns, and must not detract from its  use_. We often see this rule violated in personal, household, and  architectural decoration--windows so overloaded with projecting cornices  and lattice work as to almost exclude light and air; knife handles carved  so elaborately that it is impossible to grasp them firmly; styles of dress  in form or color that impede the motions of the wearer, and make the  clothes, rather than the personality of the wearer, the most noticeable  feature. From this principle there is but a step to another: _All ornament  should be modest and moderate_. It must not obtrude itself, and a great  profusion and ostentation in its application is always a sign of degeneracy  and bad taste. Of course some objects, from their nature, position, and  use, will admit of greater and more elaborate ornament than others.    Ornament, being entirely subordinate, should not conceal the construction  of the object. In architecture it should follow the leading lines of the  building, and should emphasize, or at least suggest, the construction. If  architectural in character, it should so enter into the construction of the  building that it could not be taken away without injuring it.    We must feel that a column, no matter how beautiful, is supporting  something. A floor, always a plane surface, must not be tiled or decorated  in any way to express relief. This would apparently destroy the essential  constructive quality of a floor, viz., flatness. For the same reason, all  shams, such as painted arches, pillars, etc., are not legitimate. As long  as they do not actually exist, they are evidently not necessary to the  construction, and have no purpose save an imaginary decorative one, and in  the words of Owen Jones, _construction must be decorated--not decoration  constructed_.    III. _Scope of Ornament._--The scope of ornamental art is almost boundless.  It is applied to objects large and small, adapted to the most various uses,  constructed of the most different materials. As the ornamentation is always  to be subordinate to the object, considerations regarding size, use,  position, material, etc., must govern it. An ornament that would be  admirable applied to one object, might be detestable if applied to another.  A design cannot be made without reference to its future application.    First: The material must be considered. Heavy and hard materials, such as  wood and stone, will not admit of as delicate curves and lines as textile  fabrics, such as cotton and woolen goods, laces, etc.    Second: The manner in which the article is to be made, whether by weaving,  cutting, carving, casting, etc.    Third: The position the object is to occupy. If elevated or otherwise  remote from the eye, elaborate finish and minute detail are useless.  Ornamental art, from time immemorial, has attained its greatest excellence  and exercised its greatest influence in connection with architecture.    In fact, the study of ornament is inseparable from that of architecture. It  is upon architectural forms that the greatest artists have in all ages  expended their greatest efforts and skill, and in a treatise on historic  ornament they are decidedly the most interesting and important object of  study.    IV. _Material of Ornament._--The two great sources of ornament are geometry  and nature. The latter includes the former; for not only must natural  forms, in order to be available as material for ornament, be first  conventionalized, or reduced to regular, symmetrical, geometric outlines,  but any and all designs, whether the unit of repetition be geometric or  conventional, must be founded upon geometric construction. This refers to  the regularity, repetition, and distribution of parts; so that every good  design, if reduced to its principal lines of construction, would exhibit  but a few geometric lines and inclosing spaces. Many designs are not only  geometric in their basis or plan, but make use of geometric figures as the  units or materials of design. Such designs, however, rank lower than those  in which natural forms conventionalized are taken as the subjects of  repetition; and as the ornament rises in the scale toward perfection, even  the geometric basis becomes less and less apparent, and sinks into a  decidedly subordinate position; so that in many of the most perfect  specimens it can be traced only in a few leading lines of the composition.  Its presence, however, is necessary, and is the foundation, if not the most  important element, of beauty in the design.      RELATION BETWEEN NATURE AND ORNAMENTAL ART.    While the natural world, including leaves, flowers, animals, etc., is the  greatest source of ornament, it is generally the opinion of the best  authorities, derived from the study of the best styles and by a  consideration of the principles of fitness and propriety which underlie the  entire physical and moral world, that natural forms in ornamental and  decorative art should not be literally copied or imitated. That is the aim  of painting, sculpture, and the other representative arts, where the object  is to present something to the eye which will suggest at once the actual  presence of the object. To produce that effect, the object, whether animal  or vegetable, is represented as much as possible in the actual  circumstances of its existence, surrounded by the necessary conditions of  its well-being and growth. A frame is placed around it, to shut it off as  much as possible from other "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1167"],[0,"A Strange Disappearance (#15)"],[1," at once followed. Not without anxiety. The assured poise  of Mr. Blake's head seemed to argue that the confidence betrayed by my  superior might receive a shock; and I felt it would be a serious blow  to his pride to fail now. But once within the room above, my doubts  speedily fled. There was that in Mr. Gryce's face which anyone  acquainted with him could not easily mistake. Whatever might be  the mysterious something which the room contained, it was evidently  sufficient in his eyes to justify his whole conduct.    \"Now sir,\" said Mr. Blake, turning upon my superior with his sternest  expression, \"the room and its contents are before you; what have you to  say for yourself.\"    Mr. Gryce equally stern, if not equally composed, cast one of his  inscrutable glances round the apartment and without a word stepped  before the picture that was as I have said, the only ornamentation of  the otherwise bare and unattractive room.    I thought Mr. Blake looked surprised, but his face was not one that  lightly expressed emotion.    \"A portrait of my cousin the Countess De Mirac,\" said he with a certain  dryness of tone hard to interpret.    Mr. Gryce bowed and for a moment stood looking with a strange lack of  interest at the proudly brilliant face of the painting before him, then  to our great amazement stepped forward and with a quick gesture turned  the picture rapidly to the wall, when--Gracious heavens! what a vision  started out before us from the reverse side of that painted canvas! No  luxurious brunette countenance now, steeped in pride and languor, but a  face--Let me see if I can describe it. But no, it was one of those faces  that are indescribable. You draw your breath as you view it; you feel as  if you had had an electric shock; but as for knowing ten minutes later  whether the eyes that so enthralled you were blue or black, or the locks  that clustered halo-like about a forehead almost awful in its expression  of weird, unfathomable power, were brown or red, you could not nor would  you pretend to say. It was the character of the countenance itself that  impressed you. You did not even know if this woman who might have been  anything wonderful or grand you ever read of, were beautiful or not. You  did not care; it was as if you had been gazing on a tranquil evening  sky and a lightning flash had suddenly startled you. Is the lightning  beautiful? Who asks! But I know from what presently transpired, that  the face was ivory pale in complexion, the eyes deeply dark, and the  hair,--strange and uncanny combination,--of a bright and peculiar golden  hue.    \"You dare!\" came forth in strange broken tones from Mr. Blake's lips.    I instantly turned towards him. He was gazing with a look that was half  indignant, half menacing at the silent detective who with eyes drooped  and finger directed towards the picture, seemed to be waiting for him to  finish.    \"I do not understand an audacity that allows you to--to--\" Was this  the haughty gentleman we had known, this hesitating troubled man with  bloodless lips and trembling hands?    \"I declared my desire to justify myself,\" said my principal with a  respectful bow. \"This is my justification. Do you note the color of the  woman's hair whose portrait hangs with its face turned to the wall in  your room? Is it like or unlike that of the strand you held in your hand  a few moments ago; a strand taken as I swear, hair by hair from the comb  of the poor creature who occupied the room above. But that is not all,\"  he continued as Mr. Blake fell a trifle aback; \"just observe the dress  in which this woman is painted; blue silk you see, dark and rich; a wide  collar cunningly executed, you can almost trace the pattern; a brooch;  then the roses in the hand, do you see? Now come with me upstairs.\"    Too much startled to speak, Mr. Blake, haughty aristocrat as he was,  turned like a little child and followed the detective who with an  assured step and unembarassed mien led the way into the deserted room  above.    \"You accuse me of insulting you, when I express disbelief of your  assertion that there was no connection between you and the girl Emily,\"  said Mr. Gryce as he lit the gas and unlocked that famous bureau drawer.  \"Will you do so any longer in face of these?\" And drawing off the towel  that lay uppermost, he revealed the neatly folded dress, wide collar,  brooch and faded roses that lay beneath. \"Mrs. Daniels assures us these  articles belonged to the sewing-woman Emily; were brought here by her.  Dare you say they are not the ones reproduced in the portrait below?\"    Mr. Blake uttering a cry sank on his knees before the drawer. \"My God!  My God!\" was his only reply, \"what are these?\" Suddenly he rose, his  whole form quivering, his eyes burning. \"Where is Mrs. Daniels?\" he  cried, hastily advancing and pulling the bell. \"I must see her at once.  Send the house-keeper here,\" he ordered as Fanny smiling demurely made  her appearance at the door.    \"Mrs. Daniels is out,\" returned the girl, \"went out as soon as ever you  got up from dinner, sir.\"    \"Gone out at this hour?\"    \"Yes sir; she goes out very often nowadays, sir.\"    Her master frowned. \"Send her to me as soon as she returns,\" he  commanded, and dismissed the girl.    \"I don't know what to make of this,\" he now said in a strange tone,  approaching again the touching contents of that open bureau drawer with  a look in which longing and doubt seemed in some way to be strangely  commingled. \"I cannot explain the presence of these articles in this  room; but if you will come below I will see what I can do to make other  matters intelligible to you. Disagreeable as it is for me to take anyone  into my confidence, affairs have gone too far for me to hope any longer  to preserve secrecy as to my private concerns.\"        CHAPTER XI. LUTTRA      \"Gentlemen,\" said he as he ushered us once more into his studio, \"you  have presumed, and not without reason I should say, to infer that the  original of this portrait and the woman who has so long occupied the  position of sewing-woman in my house, are one and the same. You will no  longer retain that opinion when I inform you that this picture, strange  as it may appear to you, is the likeness of my wife.\"    \"Wife!\" We both were astonished as I take it, but it was my voice which  spoke. \"We were ignorant you ever had a wife.\"    \"No doubt,\" continued our host smiling bitterly, \"that at least has  evaded the knowledge even of the detectives.\" Then with a return to  his naturally courteous manner, \"She was never acknowledged by me as my  wife, nor have we ever lived together, but if priestly benediction can  make a man and woman one, that woman as you see her there is my lawful  wife.\"    Rising, he softly turned the lovely, potent face back to the wall,  leaving us once more confronted by the dark and glowing countenance of  his cousin.    \"I am not called upon,\" said he, \"to go any further with you than this.  I have told you what no man till this hour has ever heard from my lips,  and it should serve to exonerate me from any unjust suspicions you may  have entertained. But to one of my temperament, secret scandal and the  gossip it engenders is only less painful than open notoriety. If I leave  the subject here, a thousand conjectures will at once seize upon you,  and my name if not hers will become, before I know it, the football of  gossip if not of worse and deeper suspicion than has yet assailed me.  Gentleman I take you to be honest men; husbands, perhaps, and fathers;  proud, too, in your way and jealous of your own reputation and that of  those with whom you are connected. If I succeed in convincing you that  my movements of late have been totally disconnected with the girl whose  cause you profess solely to be interested in, may I count upon your  silence as regards those actions and the real motive that led to them?\"    \"You may count upon my discretion as regards all matters that do not  come under the scope of police duty,\" returned Mr. Gryce. \"I haven't  much time for gossip.\"    \"And your man here?\"    \"O, he's safe where it profits him to be.\"    \"Very well, then, I shall count upon you.\"    And with the knitted brows and clinched hands of a proudly reticent  man who, perhaps for the first time in his life finds himself forced to  reveal his inner nature to the world, he began his story in these words:    \"Difficult as it is for me to introduce into a relation like this the  name of my father, I shall be obliged to do so in order to make my  conduct at a momentous crisis of my life intelligible to you. My father,  then, was a man of strong will and a few but determined prejudices.  Resolved that I should sustain the reputation of the family for wealth  and respectability, he gave me to understand from my earliest years,  that as long as I preserved my manhood from reproach, I had only to make  my wishes known, to have them immediately gratified; while if I crossed  his will either by indulging in dissipation or engaging in pursuits  unworthy of my name, I no longer need expect the favor of his  countenance or the assistance of his purse.    \"When, therefore, at a certain period of my life, I found that the  charms of my cousin Evelyn were making rather too strong an impression  upon my fancy for a secured peace of mind, I first inquired how such a  union would affect my father, and learning that it would be in direct  opposition to his views, cast about in my mind what I should do to  overcome my passion. Travel suggested itself, and I took a trip to  Europe. But the sight of new faces only awakened in me comparisons  anything but detrimental to the beauty of her who was at that time my  standard of feminine loveliness. Nature and the sports connected with a  wild life were my next resort. I went overland to California, roamed the  orange groves of Florida, and probed the wildernesses of Canada and  our Northern states. It was during these last "]]]
