Do not move the feet or bend the knees.    Exercise V.    (1) Standing erect, with hands on hips, raise yourself on the balls  of the feet several times, with sort of a springing motion. Pause a  moment after you have raised upon your toes, then let the heels sink to  the floor, then repeat, as above suggested. Keep the knees unbent and the  heels together. This exercise is specially beneficial in developing the  calf of the leg, and will make it sure the first few times it is tried.  If you have an undeveloped calf here is the exercises for you; (2) with  hands still on hips place your feet about two feet apart, and then cover  the body into a \"squatting\" position, pausing a moment and then resuming  original position. Repeat several times, but not too often at the first,  as it will make the thighs feel a little sore at the beginning. This  exercise will give one well developed thighs. This last movement may be  improved upon by sinking down with the weight resting upon the balls of  the foot, instead of upon the heel.    Exercise VI.    (1) Stand erect with hands on hips; (2) keeping the knee straight,  swing the right leg out about fifteen inches (keeping the toe turned a  little out and the sole flat)--then swing back to the rear until the toe  points straight to the ground, _keeping the knee stiff all the time_; (3)  repeat the swinging backward and forward several times; (4) then do  the same with the left leg; (5) with hands still on hips, raise the right  leg up, bending the knee, until the upper-leg (thigh) stands straight out  from the body (if you can raise it still higher, you may do so); (6)  place your foot again on the ground, and go through the same motion  with the left leg; (7) repeat several times, first one leg and then the  other, moving slowly at first and gradually increasing your speed until  you are executing a slow trot without moving from the over spot.    Exercise VII.    (1) Stand erect, with the arms extended straight in front of you, from  the shoulders, and of course on a level with the shoulders--the palms  must be down, fingers straight out, thumbs folded under and the thumb  side of hands touching each other; (2) bend the body forward from the  hips, stooping forward as far as possible and at the same time swing the  arms forward with a sweeping movement, sending them down, backward and  upward at the back, so that when the body has reached the limit of the  bending forward movement the arms are extended back and over the  body--keep the arms stiff and do not bend the knees; (3) resume standing  position and repeat several times.    Exercise VIII.    (1) Extend the arms straight, sideways, from the shoulder and hold them  there stiff and rigid with hands open; (2) close the hands forcibly  with a quick motion, pressing the fingers well into the palm; (3) open  the hands forcibly and quickly, spreading out the fingers and thumbs  as widely as possible forming a fan shaped hand; (4) close and open  the hands as above stated, several times, as rapidly as possible. Put  life into the exercise. This is a splendid exercise for developing the  muscles of the hand and for acquiring manual dexterity.    Exercise IX.    (1) Lie upon your stomach, extending your arms above your head and then  bowed upward and your legs stretched out full length and raised backward  and upward. The correct position may be carried in the mind by imagining  a watch--crystal or a saucer resting on the table on its middle, with  both ends turning upward; (2) lower and raise the arms and legs, several  times; (3) then turn over on your back and lie extended at full length,  with arms extended straight out upwards over the head, with back of  fingers touching the ground; (4) then raise up both legs from the waist  until they stand straight up in the air, like the mast of a ship, your  upper-body and arms remaining in the last position named. Lower the legs  and raise them several times; (5) resume position 3, lying flat upon the  back at full with arms extended straight out upward, over the head, with  backs of fingers touching the ground; (6) then gradually raise body to  sitting position, with arms projecting straight in front of the  shoulders. Then go back gradually to the lying down position, and  repeat the raising and lowering several times; (7) then turn over on the  face and stomach again and assume the following position:--Keeping  the body rigid from head to foot, raise your body until its weight rests  upon your palms (the arms being stretched out straight in front of you)  at one end, and upon your toes at the other end. Then gradually bend  arms at the elbow, allowing your chest to sink to the floor; then raise  up your chest and upper-body by straightening out your arms, the entire  weight falling upon the arms, with the toes as a pivot--this last is a  difficult motion, and should not be overdone at first.    Exercise X.    This exercise is for those troubled with a too large abdomen, which  trouble is caused by too much fat gathering there. The abdomen may  be materially reduced by a reasonable indulgence in this exercise--but  always remember \"moderation in all things\" and do not overdo matters,  or be in too much of a hurry. Here is the exercise: (1) exhale the breath  (breathe out all the air in the lungs, without straining yourself too  much) and then draw the abdomen in and up as far as you can, then hold  for a moment and let it resume its natural position. Repeat a number of  times and then take a breath or two and rest a moment. Repeat several  times, moving it in and out. It is surprising how much control one may  gain over these stubborn muscles with a little practice. This exercise  will not only reduce the fatty layers over the abdomen, but will also  greatly strengthen the stomach muscles. (2) Give the abdomen a good but  not rough kneading and rubbing.    Exercise XI.    The exercise is as follows:--Follow it carefully. (1) stand erect, with  heels together, toes slightly pointed outward; (2) raise the arms up by  the sides (with a circular movement) until the hands meet over the head,  thumbs touching each other; (3) keeping the knees stiff; the body rigid;  _the elbows unbent_; (and shoulders bent well back as the movement is  made); bring down the hands, slowly, with a sideway circular motion,  until they reach the sides of the legs the little finger and the  inner-edge (the \"chopping-edge\") of the hand alone touching the legs, and  palms of the hands facing straight to the front. The shoulder gets the  right position by touching the little finger of each hand to the seam of  the trousers. (4) Repeat several times, _slowly_ remember. With the hands  in the last position, having been placed there by the motion stated, it  is very difficult for the shoulders to warp forward. The chest is  projected a little; the head is erect; neck is straight, the back  straight and hollowed a little (the natural position); and the knees are  straight. In short, you have a fine, erect carriage--_now keep it_.      SEVEN MINOR BREATHING EXERCISES.    Exercise I.    (1) Stand erect with hands at sides. (2) Inhale complete breath.  (3) Raise the arms slowly, keeping them rigid until the hands touch over  head. (4) Retain the breath a few minutes with hands over head. (5)  Lower hands slowly to sides exhaling slowly at the same time. (6)  Practise cleansing breath.    Exercise II.    (1) Stand erect with arms straight in front of you.

(5) Exhale vigorously through  the mouth. (6) Practise cleansing breath.    Exercise V.    (1) Stand erect with your palms against the wall. (2) Inhale complete  breath and retain. (3) Lower the chest to the wall, resting your  weight on your hands. (4) Then raise yourself back with the arm muscles  alone, keeping the body stiff. (5) Exhale vigorously through the mouth.  (6) Practise cleansing breath.    Exercise VI.    (1) Stand erect with arms \"akimbo\" that is with hands resting around the  waist and elbows standing out. (2) Inhale complete breath and retain. (3)  Keep legs and hips stiff and bend well forward, as if bowing, at the same  time exhaling slowly. (4) Return to first position and then take another  complete breath. (5) Then bend backward exhaling slowly. (6) Return to  first position and take a complete breath. (7) Then bend sideways  exhaling slowly (vary by bending to right and then to left). (8) Practise  cleansing breath.    Exercise VII.    (1) Stand erect or sit erect with straight spinal column. (2) Inhale a  complete breath but instead of inhaling on a continuous steady stream,  take a series of short, quick \"sniffs\" as if you were smelling aromatic  salts and ammonia and did not wish to get too strong a \"whiff.\" Do not  exhale any of these little breaths, but add one to the other until the  entire lung space is filled.

[Footnote 1: _Coup d'Oeil General sur les Possessions Neerlandaises dans  l'Inde Archipelagique_.]    The points which entitle it to this distinction he enumerated minutely  in the work[1] before alluded to, but they have been summarized as  follows by Prince Lucien Bonaparte.    [Footnote 1: TEMMINCK, _Coup-d'oeil, &c_., t. i. c. iv. p. 328.; t. ii.  c. iii. p. 91.]    \"This species is perfectly intermediate between the Indian and African,  especially in the shape of the skull, and will certainly put an end to  the distinction between _Elephas_ and _Loxodon_, with those who admit  that anatomical genus; since although the crowns of the teeth of _E.  Sumatranus_ are more like the Asiatic animal, still the less numerous  undulated ribbons of enamel are nearly quite as wide as those forming  the lozenges of the African. The number of pairs of false ribs (which  alone vary, the true ones being always six) is fourteen, one less than  in the _Africanus_, _one_ more than in the _Indicus_; and so it is with  the dorsal vertebrae, which are twenty in the _Sumatranus_ (_twenty-one_  and _nineteen_, in the others), whilst the new species agrees with  _Africanus_ in the number of sacral vertebrae (_four_), and with  _Indicus_ in that of the caudal ones, which are _thirty-four_.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: _Proceed. Zool. Soc. London_, 1849. p. 144, _note_. The  original description of TEMMINCK is as follows:    \"Elephas Sumatranus, _Nob_. ressemble, par la forme generale du crane a  l'elephant du continent de l'Asie; mais la partie libre des  intermaxillaires est beaucoup plus courte et plus etroite; les cavites  nasales sont beaucoup moins larges; l'espace entre les orbites des yeux  est plus etroit; la partie posterieur du crane au contraire est plus  large que dans l'espece du continent.    \"Les machelieres se rapprochent, par la forme de leur couronne, plutot  de l'espece Asiatique que do celle qui est propre a l'Afrique;  c'est-a-dire que leur couronne offre la forme de rubans ondoyes et non  pas en losange; mais ces rubans sont de la largeur de ceux qu'on voit a  la couronne des dents de l'elephant d'Afrique; ils sont consequemment  moins nombreux que dans celui du continent de l'Asie. Les dimensions de  ces rubans, dans la direction d'avant en arriere, comparees a celle  prises dans la direction transversale et laterale, sont en raison de 3  ou 4 a 1; tandis que dans l'elephant du continent elles sont comme 4 ou  6 a 1. La longueur totale de six de ces rubans, dans l'espece nouvelle  de Sumatra, ainsi que dans celle d'Afrique, est d'environ 12  centimetres, tandis que cette longueur n'est que de 8 a 10 centimetres  dans l'espece du continent de l'Asie.    \"Les autres formes osteologiques sont a peu pres les memes dans les  trois especes; mais il y a difference dans le nombre des os dont le  squelette se compose, ainsi que le tableau comparatif ci-joint  l'eprouve.    \"_L'elephas Africanus_ a 7 vertebres du cou, 21 vert. dorsales, 3  lombaires, 4 sacrees, et 26 caudales; 21 paires de cotes, dont 6 vraies,  et 15 fausses. _L'elephas Indicus_ a 7 vertebres du cou, 19 dorsales, 3  lombaires, 5 sacrees, et 34 caudales, 19 paires de cotes, dont 6 vraies,  et 3 fausses. _L'elephas Sumatranus_ a 7 vertebres du cou, 20 dorsales,  3 lombaires, 4 sacrees, et 34 caudales; 20 paires du cotes, dont 6  vraies, et 14 fausses.    \"Ces caracteres ont ete constates sur trois squelettes de l'espece  nouvelle, un male et une femelle adultes et un jeune male. Nous n'avons  pas encore ete a meme de nous procurer la depouille de cette espece.\"]    PROFESSOR SCHLEGEL of Leyden, in a paper lately submitted by him to the  Royal Academy of Sciences of Holland, (the substance of which he has  obligingly communicated to me, through Baron Bentinck the Netherlands  Minister at this Court), has confirmed the identity of the Ceylon  elephant with that found in the Lampongs of Sumatra. The osteological  comparison of which TEMMINCK has given the results was, he says,  conducted by himself with access to four skeletons of the latter. And  the more recent opportunity of comparing a living Sumatran elephant with  one from Bengal, has served to establish other though minor points of  divergence. The Indian species is more robust and powerful: the  proboscis longer and more slender; and the extremity, (a point, in which  the elephant of Sumatra resembles that of Africa,) is more flattened and  provided with coarser and longer hair than that of India.    PROFESSOR SCHLEGEL, adverting to the large export of elephants from  Ceylon to the Indian continent, which has been carried on from time  immemorial, suggests the caution with which naturalists, in  investigating this question, should first satisfy themselves whether the  elephants they examine are really natives of the mainland,  or whether  they have been brought to it from the islands.[1] \"The extraordinary  fact,\" he observes in his letter to me, \"of the identity thus  established between the elephants of Ceylon and Sumatra; and the points  in which they are found to differ from that of Bengal, leads to the  question whether all the elephants of the Asiatic continent belong to  one single species; or whether these vast regions may not produce in  some quarter as yet unexplored the one hitherto found only in the two  islands referred to? It is highly desirable that naturalists who have  the means and opportunity, should exert themselves to discover, whether  any traces are to be found of the Ceylon elephant in the Dekkan; or of  that of Sumatra in Cochin China or Siam.\"    [Footnote 1: A further inquiry suggests itself, how far the intermixture  of the breed may have served to confound specific differences, in the  case of elephants bred on the continent of India, from stock partially  imported from Ceylon?]    To me the establishment of a fact so conclusively confirmatory of the  theory I had ventured to broach, is productive of great satisfaction.  But it is not a little remarkable that the distinction should not long  before have been discovered between the elephant of India and that of  Ceylon. Nor can it be regarded otherwise than as a singular illustration  of \"geographical distribution\" that two remote islands should be thus  shown to possess in common a species unknown in any other quarter of the  globe. As bearing on the ancient myth which represents both countries as  forming parts of a submerged continent, the discovery is curious--and it  is equally interesting in connection with the circumstance alluded to by  Gibbon, that amongst the early geographers and even down to a  comparatively modern date, Sumatra and Ceylon were confounded; and grave  doubts were entertained as to which of the two was the \"Taprobane\" of  antiquity. GEMMA FRISIUS, SEBASTIAN MUNSTER, JULIUS SCALIGER, ORTELIUS  and MERCATOR contended for the former; SALMASIUS, BOCHART, CLUVERIUS,  and VOSSIUS for Ceylon: and the controversy did not cease till it was  terminated by DELISLE about the beginning of the last century.    VIII. CETACEA.--Whales are so frequently seen that they have been  captured within sight of Colombo, and more than once their carcases,  after having been flinched by the whalers, have floated on shore near  the lighthouse, tainting the atmosphere within the fort by their rapid  decomposition.    Of this family, one of the most remarkable animals on the coast is the  dugong[1], a phytophagous cetacean, numbers of which are attracted to  the inlets, from the bay of Calpentyn to Adam's Bridge, by the still  water and the abundance of marine algae in these parts of the gulf. One  which was killed at Manaar and sent to me to Colombo[2] in 1847,  measured upwards of seven feet in length; but specimens considerably  larger have been taken at Calpentyn, and their flesh is represented as  closely resembling veal.    [Footnote 1: _Halicore dugung_, F. Cuv.]    [Footnote 2: The skeleton is now in the Museum of the Natural History  Society of Belfast.]    [Illustration: THE DUGONG.]    The rude approach to the human outline, observed in the shape of the  head of this creature, and the attitude of the mother when suckling her  young, clasping it to her breast with one flipper, while swimming with  the other, holding the heads of both above water; and when disturbed,  suddenly diving and displaying her fish-like tail,--these, together with  her habitual demonstrations of strong maternal affection, probably gave  rise to the fable of the \"mermaid;\" and thus that earliest invention of  mythical physiology may be traced to the Arab seamen and the Greeks, who  had watched the movements of the dugong in the waters of Manaar.    Megasthenes records the existence of a creature in the ocean, near  Taprobane, with the aspect of a woman[1]; and AElian, adopting and  enlarging on his information, peoples the seas of Ceylon with fishes  having the heads of lions, panthers, and rams, and, stranger still,  _cetaceans in the form of satyrs_. Statements such as these must have  had their origin in the hairs, which are set round the mouth of the  dugong, somewhat resembling a beard, which AElian and Megasthenes both  particularise, from their resemblance to the hair of a woman: \"[Greek:  kai gynaikon opsin echousin aisper anti plokamon akanthai  prosertentai\"][2]    [Footnote 1: MEGASTHENES, _Indica_, fragm. lix. 34,]    [Footnote 2: AELIAN, _Nat. Hist._, lib. xvi. ch. xviii.]    The Portuguese cherished the belief in the mermaid, and the annalist of  the exploits of the Jesuits in India, gravely records that seven of  these monsters, male and female, were captured at Manaar in 1560, and  carried to Goa, where they were dissected by Demas Bosquez, physician to  the Viceroy, and \"their internal structure found to be in all respects  conformable to the human.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: _Hist, de la"]]]
