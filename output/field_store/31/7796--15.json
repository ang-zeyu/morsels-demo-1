But it is most effectually kept at bay by the  expedient of building the wall hollow; that is to say, making the  external wall of the house to consist of two perfectly distinct walls,  standing about 2 in. apart, and held together by ties of earthenware or  iron. The result is that the moisture blowing through the outer skin  does not pass the cavity, but trickles down on the inner face of the  outer wall, while the inner wall remains dry. The ties are constructed  of shapes to prevent their conducting water themselves from without to  the inner wall. In addition to this, a series of slates forming an  intermediate protection is sometimes introduced, and forms an additional  and most valuable screen against weather. Sometimes, the two skins of  the wall are closer together--say 3/4 in.--and the space is filled with a  bituminous material.    A substance of a bituminous nature, called hygeian rock, has been of  late years introduced, and is being extensively used for this purpose;  it is melted and poured into the open space hot, and quickly hardens.  The use of such a material is open to the objection that no air can pass  through it. The rooms of our houses are receiving air constantly through  the walls, and much of the constant current up our chimneys is supplied,  to our great advantage, in this very imperceptible manner. The house  breathes, so to speak, through the pores of its brickwork. When this is  rendered impossible, it seems clear that fiercer draughts will enter  through the chinks and crevices, and that there will be a greater demand  upon flues not in use, occasioning down draught in the chimneys.    Another mode of keeping out weather is to cement the face of the  brickwork. But this hides up the work, and so tends to promote bad work,  besides being often very unsightly.    Among other peculiarities of brickwork are the facilities for  introducing different colors and different textures of surface which it  presents, the ease with which openings and arches can be formed in it,  the possibility of executing ornament and even carving, and the ease  with which brickwork will combine with other building materials. It  cannot be well made use of for columns, though it may readily enough be  turned into piers or pilasters. It cannot, generally speaking, with  advantage be made use of for any large domes, though the inner dome of  St. Paul's and the intermediate cone are of brick, and stand well. But  it is an excellent material for vaulting arcades and all purposes  involving the turning of arches.    Brickwork must be said to be durable, but it requires care. If not of  the best, brickwork within the reach of the constant vibration caused by  the traffic on a railway seems to be in danger of being shaken to  pieces, judging from one or two instances that have come under my own  observation. The mortar, and even in some cases the bricks themselves,  will rapidly deteriorate if moisture be allowed to get into the heart of  a brick wall, and in exposed situations this is very apt to happen. Care  should always be taken to keep the pointing of external brickwork in  good order, and to maintain all copings and other projections intended  to bar the access of water coming down from above, and to stop the  overflowing of gutters and stack pipes, which soon soaks the wall  through and through.    Of course, if there is a failure of foundations, brickwork, as was  pointed out earlier, becomes affected at once. But if these be good, and  the materials used be sound ones, and if the other precautions just  recommended be taken, it will last strong and sturdy for an immense  length of time. In some cases, as for example in the Roman ruins, it has  stood for 1,500 years under every possible exposure and neglect, and  still shows something of a sturdy existence after all, though sadly  mutilated. If we now return to the question, What can be well done in  brickwork? no better answer can be given than to point to what has been  and is being done, especially in London and within our own reach and  observation.    Great engineering works, such as railway viaducts, the lining of railway  tunnels, the piers and even the arches of bridges, sewage works, dock  and wharf walls, furnace chimneys, and other works of this sort are  chiefly done in brickwork. And notwithstanding that iron is far more  used by the engineer for some purposes and concrete for others now than  formerly, still there is a great field for brickwork. The late Mr.  Brunel, who was fond of pushing size to extremes, tried how wide a span  he could arch over with brickwork. And I believe the bridge which  carries the G.W.R. over the Thames at Maidenhead has the widest arch he  or any other engineer has successfully erected in brick. This arch has,  it is stated, a span of 128 ft. It is segmental, the radius being 169  ft., and the rise from springing to crown 24 ft., and the depth of the  arch 5 ft. 3 in. Nowadays, of course, no one would dream of anything but  an iron girder bridge in such a position. Mr. Brunel's father, when he  constructed the Thames Tunnel, lined it with brickwork foot by foot as  he went on, and that lining sustained the heavy weight of the bed of the  river and the river itself.    If you leave London by either of the southern lines, all of which are at  a high level, you go for miles on viaducts consisting of brick arches  carried on brick walls. If you leave by the northern lines, you plunge  into tunnel after tunnel lined with brickwork, and kept secure by such  lining. Mile after mile of London streets, and those in the suburbs,  present to the eye little but brick buildings; dwelling houses, shops,  warehouses, succeed one another, all in brickwork, and even when the eye  seems to catch a change, it is more apparent than real.    The white mansions of Tyburnia, Belgravia, South Kensington, and the  neat villas of the suburbs are only brickwork, with a thin coat of  stucco, which serves the purpose of concealing the real structure--often  only too much in need of concealment--with a material supposed to be a  little more sightly, and certainly capable of keeping the weather out  rather more effectually than common brickwork would.    More than this, such fine structures, apparently built entirely of  stone, as are being put up for commercial purposes in the streets of the  city, and for public purposes throughout London, are all of them nothing  more than brick fabrics with a facing of masonry. Examine one of them in  progress, and you will find the foundations and vaults of brickwork, and  not only the interior walls, but the main part of the front wall,  executed in brickwork, and the stone only skin deep. There are, however,  two or three ways of making use of brickwork without covering it up, and  of gaining good architectural effects thereby, and to these I beg now to  direct your attention.    The architect who desires to make an effective brick building, which  shall honestly proclaim to all the world that it is of brick, may do  this, and, if he will, may do it successfully, by employing brickwork  and no other material, but making the best use of the opportunities  which it affords, or he may erect his building of brickwork and stone  combined, or of brickwork and terra cotta. Mr. Robson, till lately the  architect to the School Board for London, has the merit of having put  down in every part of the metropolis a series of well contrived and well  designed buildings, the exterior of which almost without exception  consists of brickwork only.    If you examine one of his school-houses, you will see that the walls are  of ordinary stock brickwork, but usually brightened up by a little red  brick at each angle, and surmounted by well contrasted gables and with  lofty, well designed chimneys, rising from the tiled roof. The window  openings and doorways are marked by brickwork, usually also red, and  sometimes moulded, and though I personally must differ from the taste  which selected some of the forms employed (they are those in use in this  country in the 17th and the last centuries), I cordially recognize that  with very simple and inexpensive means exceedingly good, appropriate,  and effective buildings have been designed.    Among examples of architecture wholly, or almost wholly, executed in red  brick, I cannot pass over a building built many years ago, little known  on account of its obscure situation, but a gem in its way. I allude to  the schools designed by Mr. Wilde, and built in Castle street, Endell  street.    Of buildings where a small amount of stone is introduced into brickwork  we have a good many fine specimens in London. One of the best--probably  the best--is the library in Lincoln's Inn Fields. This is a large and  picturesque pile, built under Mr. Hardwick, as architect, in red brick,  with patterns in the blank parts of the walls done in black brick. It  has splendid moulded brick chimneys, and the mullions of the windows,  the copings, the entrances, and some other architectural features done  in stone. The building is a good reproduction of the style of building  in Tudor times, when, as has been already mentioned, brickwork was taken  into favor.    Another building of the same class, but not so good, is the older part  of the Consumption Hospital, at Brompton. Brickwork, with a little  stone, has been very successfully employed as the material for churches,  and in many such cases the interior is of unplastered brickwork. Such  churches often attain, when designed by skillful hands, great dignity  and breadth of effect. St. Albans, Holborn; the great church designed by  Mr. Butterfield, in Margaret street; Mr. Street's church near Vincent  square, Westminster; and several churches of Mr. Brooks', such as he was  kind enough to enable me to illustrate tonight, may be mentioned as  examples of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1152"],[0,"The Story of the Volsungs (Volsunga Saga); with Excerpts from the Poetic Edda (#15)"],[1," the         translators.        CHAPTER XX. Of Sigurd's Meeting with Brynhild on the Mountain.    By long roads rides Sigurd, till he comes at the last up on to Hindfell,  and wends his way south to the land of the Franks; and he sees before  him on the fell a great light, as of fire burning, and flaming up even  unto the heavens; and when he came thereto, lo, a shield-hung castle  before him, and a banner on the topmost thereof: into the castle went  Sigurd, and saw one lying there asleep, and all-armed. Therewith he  takes the helm from off the head of him, and sees that it is no man, but  a woman; and she was clad in a byrny as closely set on her as though it  had grown to her flesh; so he rent it from the collar downwards; and then  the sleeves thereof, and ever the sword bit on it as if it were cloth.  Then said Sigurd that over-long had she lain asleep; but she asked--    \"What thing of great might is it that has prevailed to rend my byrny,  and draw me from my sleep?\"    Even as sings the song: (1)         \"What bit on the byrny,       Why breaks my sleep away,       Who has turned from me       My wan tormenting?\"    \"Ah, is it so, that here is come Sigurd Sigmundson, bearing Fafnir's  helm on his head and Fafnir's bane in his hand?\"    Then answered Sigurd--         \"Sigmund's son       With Sigurd's sword       E'en now rent down       The raven's wall.\"    \"Of the Volsung's kin is he who has done the deed; but now I have heard  that thou art daughter of a mighty king, and folk have told us that thou  wert lovely and full of lore, and now I will try the same.\"    Then Brynhild sang--         \"Long have I slept       And slumbered long,       Many and long are the woes of mankind,       By the might of Odin       Must I bide helpless       To shake from off me the spells of slumber.         \"Hail to the day come back!       Hail, sons of the daylight!       Hail to thee, dark night, and thy daughter!       Look with kind eyes a-down,       On us sitting here lonely,       And give unto us the gain that we long for.         \"Hail to the Aesir,       And the sweet Asyniur! (2)       Hail to the fair earth fulfilled of plenty!       Fair words, wise hearts,       Would we win from you,       And healing hands while life we hold.\"    Then Brynhild speaks again and says, \"Two kings fought, one hight Helm  Gunnar, an old man, and the greatest of warriors, and Odin had promised  the victory unto him; but his foe was Agnar, or Audi's brother: and so  I smote down Helm Gunnar in the fight; and Odin, in vengeance for that  deed, stuck the sleep-thorn into me, and said that I should never  again have the victory, but should be given away in marriage; but  thereagainst I vowed a vow, that never would I wed one who knew the  name of fear.\"    Then said Sigurd, \"Teach us the lore of mighty matters!\"    She said, \"Belike thou cannest more skill in all than I; yet will I  teach thee; yea, and with thanks, if there be aught of my cunning that  will in anywise pleasure thee, either of runes or of other matters that  are the root of things; but now let us drink together, and may the Gods  give to us twain a good day, that thou mayst win good help and fame  from my wisdom, and that thou mayst hereafter mind thee of that which we  twain speak together.\"    Then Brynhild filled a beaker and bore it to Sigurd, and gave him the  drink of love, and spake--           \"Beer bring I to thee,         Fair fruit of the byrnies' clash,         Mixed is it mightily,         Mingled with fame,         Brimming with bright lays         And pitiful runes,         Wise words, sweet words,         Speech of great game.           \"Runes of war know thou,         If great thou wilt be!       Cut them on hilt of hardened sword,         Some on the brand's back,         Some on its shining side,       Twice name Tyr therein.           \"Sea-runes good at need,         Learnt for ship's saving,       For the good health of the swimming horse;         On the stern cut them,         Cut them on the rudder-blade       And set flame to shaven oar:         Howso big be the sea-hills,         Howso blue beneath,       Hail from the main then comest thou home.           \"Word-runes learn well         If thou wilt that no man       Pay back grief for the grief thou gavest;         Wind thou these,         Weave thou these,       Cast thou these all about thee,         At the Thing,         Where folk throng,       Unto the full doom faring.           \"Of ale-runes know the wisdom         If thou wilt that another's wife       Should not bewray thine heart that trusteth:         Cut them on the mead-horn,         On the back of each hand,       And nick an N upon thy nail.           \"Ale have thou heed         To sign from all harm       Leek lay thou in the liquor,         Then I know for sure         Never cometh to thee,       Mead with hurtful matters mingled.           \"Help-runes shalt thou gather         If skill thou wouldst gain       To loosen child from low-laid mother;         Cut be they in hands hollow,         Wrapped the joints round about;       Call for the Good-folks' gainsome helping.           \"Learn the bough-runes wisdom         If leech-lore thou lovest;       And wilt wot about wounds' searching         On the bark be they scored;         On the buds of trees       Whose boughs look eastward ever.           \"Thought-runes shalt thou deal with         If thou wilt be of all men       Fairest-souled wight, and wisest,         These areded         These first cut       These first took to heart high Hropt.         \"On the shield were they scored       That stands before the shining God,       On Early-waking's ear,       On All-knowing's hoof,       On the wheel which runneth       Under Rognir's chariot;       On Sleipnir's jaw-teeth,       On the sleigh's traces.         \"On the rough bear's paws,       And on Bragi's tongue,       On the wolf's claws,       And on eagle's bill,       On bloody wings,       And bridge's end;       On loosing palms,       And pity's path:         \"On glass, and on gold,       And on goodly silver,       In wine and in wort,       And the seat of the witch-wife;       On Gungnir's point,       And Grani's bosom;       On the Norn's nail,       And the neb of the night-owl.           \"All these so cut,         Were shaven and sheared,       And mingled in with holy mead,       And sent upon wide ways enow;         Some abide with the Elves,         Some abide with the Aesir,       Or with the wise Vanir,       Some still hold the sons of mankind.           \"These be the book-runes,         And the runes of good help,       And all the ale-runes,       And the runes of much might;         To whomso they may avail,         Unbewildered unspoilt;       They are wholesome to have:       Thrive thou with these then.

Sigurd spake now, \"Sure no wiser woman than thou art one may be found in  the wide world; yea, yea, teach me more yet of thy wisdom!\"    She answers, \"Seemly is it that I do according to thy will, and show  thee forth more redes of great avail, for thy prayer's sake and thy  wisdom;\" and she spake withal--    \"Be kindly to friend and kin, and reward not their trespasses against  thee; bear and forbear, and win for thee thereby long enduring praise of  men.    \"Take good heed of evil things: a may's love, and a man's wife; full oft  thereof doth ill befall!    \"Let not thy mind be overmuch crossed by unwise men at thronged meetings  of folk; for oft these speak worse than they wot of; lest thou be called  a dastard, and art minded to think that thou art even as is said; slay  such an one on another day, and so reward his ugly talk.    \"If thou farest by the way whereas bide evil things, be well ware of  thyself; take not harbour near the highway, though thou be benighted,  for oft abide there ill wights for men's bewilderment.    \"Let not fair women beguile thee, such as thou mayst meet at the feast,  so that the thought thereof stand thee in stead of sleep, and a quiet  mind; yea, draw them not to thee with kisses or other sweet things of  love.    \"If thou hearest the fool's word of a drunken man, strive not with him  being drunk with drink and witless; many a grief, yea, and the very  death, groweth from out such things.    \"Fight thy foes in the field, nor be burnt in thine house.    'Never swear thou wrongsome oath; great and grim is the reward for the  breaking of plighted troth.    \"Give kind heed to dead men,--sick-dead, Sea-dead; deal heedfully with  their dead corpses.    \"Trow never in him for whom thou hast slain father, brother, or whatso  near kin, yea, though young he be; 'for oft waxes wolf in youngling'.    \"Look thou with good heed to the wiles of thy friends; but little skill  is given to me, that I should foresee the ways of thy life; yet good it  were that hate fell not on thee from those of thy wife's house.\"    Sigurd spake, \"None among the sons of men can be found wiser than thou;  and thereby swear I, that thee will I have as my own, for near to my  heart thou liest.\"    She answers, \"Thee would I fainest choose, though I had all men's sons  to choose from.\"    And thereto they plighted troth both of them.
