The only thing I see to  correct in the Sun's article, continued the Father, is in regard to  population. 'A Spanish official told me that the census figures were  notoriously misleading. The census shows less than one-third colored.  That is said not to be true. As soon as a man with African blood,  whether light or dark, acquires property and education, he returns  himself in the census as white. The officials humor them in this  petty vanity. In fact it's the most difficult thing in the world to  distinguish between races in Cuba. Many Spaniards from Murcia,  for instance, of undoubted noble lineage are darker than Richmond  mulattoes.'\"    [Illustration: GENERAL RUSSELL A. ALGER, SECRETARY OF WAR.]    May I ask you, Father Yates, to what do you ascribe the absence of  Race prejudice in Cuba?    \"Certainly. In my humble opinion it is due to Church influence. We all  know the effect on our social life of our churches. Among Catholics  all men have always been on equal footing at the Communion rail.  Catholics would be unworthy of their name, i.e. Catholic or universal  were it not so.\"    \"Even in the days when slavery was practised this religious equality  and fellowship was fully recognized among Catholics.\"    Did you know there is an American Negro Saint? He was born in Colon,  Central America, and is called Blessed Martin De Porres. His name is  much honored in Cuba, Peru, Mexico and elsewhere. He wore the white  habit of a Dominican Brother. The Dominicans are called the Order of  Preachers.    Christ Died for All. Father Donovan has those words painted in large  letters over the Sanctuary in St. Joseph's Church. It is simply  horrible to think that some self-styled Christian sectarians act as if  Christ died for white men only.    Matanzas, Cuba, Jan. 20.--Not least among the problems of  reconstruction in Cuba is the social and political status of the  colored \"man and brother.\" In Cuba the shade of a man's complexion has  never been greatly considered, and one finds dusky Othellos in every  walk of life. The present dispute arose when a restaurant keeper from  Alabama refused a seat at his public table to the mulatto Colonel of  a Cuban regiment. The Southerner was perfectly sincere in the  declaration that he would see himself in a warmer climate than Cuba  before he would insult his American guests \"by seating a 'nigger'  among them!\" To the Colonel it was a novel and astonishing experience,  and is of course deeply resented by all his kind in Cuba, where  African blood may be found, in greater or less degree, in some of the  richest and most influential families of the island.    COLORED BELLES THERE.    In Havana you need not be surprised to see Creole belles on  the fashionable Prado--perhaps Cuban-Spanish. Cuban-English or  Cuban-German blondes--promenading with Negro officers in gorgeous  uniforms; or octoroon beauties with hair in natural crimp, riding in  carriages beside white husbands or lighting up an opera box with the  splendor of their diamonds. There was a wedding in the old cathedral  the other day, attended by the elite of the city, the bride being the  lovely young daughter of a Cuban planter, the groom a burly Negro.  Nobody to the manor born has ever dreamed of objecting to this  mingling of colors; therefore when some newly arrived foreigner  declares that nobody but those of his own complexion shall eat in a  public dining room, there is likely to be trouble.    THE WAR BEGAN.    When the war began the population of Cuba was a little more than  one-third black; now the proportion is officially reckoned as 525,684  colored, against 1,631,600 white. In 1898 two Negroes were serving as  secretaries in the Autonomist Cabinet. The last regiment that Blanco  formed was of Negro volunteers, to whom he paid--or, rather, promised  to pay, which is quite another matter, considering Blanco's habit--the  unusual hire of $20 a month, showing his appreciation of the colored  man as a soldier. If General Weyler evinced any partiality in Cuba,  it was for the black Creole. During the ten years' war, his cavalry  escort was composed entirely of colored men. Throughout his latest  reign in the island he kept black soldiers constantly on guard at the  gates of the government palace. While the illustrated papers of Spain  were caricaturing: the insurgents as coal-black demons with horns  and forked toe nails, burning canefields and butchering innocent  Spaniards, the Spanish General chose them for his bodyguards.    [Illustration: CUBAN WOMAN CAVALRY.]    ONE OF THE GREATEST GENERALS.    One of the greatest Generals of the day, considering the environment,  was Antonio Maceo, the Cuban mulatto hero, who, for two years, kept  the Spanish army at bay or led them a lively quickstep through the  western provinces to the very gates of Havana. As swift on the march  as Sheridan or Stonewall Jackson, as wary and prudent as Grant  himself, he had inspirations of military genius whenever a crisis  arose. It is not generally known that Martinez Campos, who owed his  final defeat at Colisea to Maceo, was a second cousin of this black  man. Maceo's mother, whose family name was Grinan, came from the town  of Mayari where all the people have Indian blood in their veins. Col.  Martinez del Campos, father of General Martinez Campos, was once  Military Governor of Mayari. While there he loved a beautiful girl of  Indian and Negro blood, who belonged to the Grinan family, and was  first cousin to Maceo's mother. Martinez Campos, Jr., the future  General and child of the Indian girl was born in Mayari. The Governor  could not marry his sweetheart, having a wife and children in Spain,  but when he returned to the mother country he took the boy along.  According to Spanish law, the town in which one is baptized is  recognized as his legal birthplace, so it was easy enough to  legitimatize the infant Campos. He grew up in Spain, and when sent to  Cuba as Captain-General, to his everlasting credit be it said, that  one of his first acts was to hunt up his mother. Having found her, old  and poor, he bought a fine house in Campo Florida, the aristocratic  suburb of Havana, established her there and cared for her tenderly  till she died. The cousins, though on opposite sides of the war,  befriended each other in many instances, and it is said that more  than once Captain-General Campos owed his life to his unacknowledged  relative.    HIS BROTHER CAPTURED.    The latter's half brother, Jose Maceo, was captured early in the war  and sent to the African prison, Centa; whence he escaped later on with  Quintin Bandera and others of his staff. The last named Negro Colonel  is to-day a prominent figure. \"Quintin Bandera\" means \"fifteen flags,\"  and the appellation was bestowed upon him by his grateful countrymen  after he had captured fifteen Spanish ensigns. Everybody seems to  have forgotten his real name, and Quintin Bandera he will remain in  history. While in the African penal settlement the daughter of a  Spanish officer fell in love with him. She assisted in his escape and  fled with him to Gibraltar. There he married his rescuer. She is of  Spanish and Moorish descent, and is said to be a lady of education  and refinement. She taught her husband to read and write and feels  unbounded pride in his achievements.    The noted General Jesus Rabi, of the Cuban Army, is of the same mixed  blood as the Maceos. Another well-known Negro commander is General  Flor Crombet, whose patriotic deeds have been dimmed by his atrocious  cruelties. Among all the officers now swarming Havana none attracts  more admiring attention than General Ducasse, a tall, fine-looking  mulatto, who was educated at the fine military school of St. Cyr. He  is of extremely polished manners and undeniable force of character,  can make a brilliant address and has great influence among the masses.  To eject such a man as he from a third rate foreign restaurant in his  own land would be ridiculous. His equally celebrated brother, Col.  Juan Ducasse, was killed last year in the Pinar del Rio insurrection.    COLORED MEN'S ACHIEVEMENTS.    Besides these sons of Mars, Cuba has considered her history enriched  by the achievements of colored men in peaceful walks of life. The  memory of Gabriel Concepcion de la Valdez the mulatto poet, is  cherished as that of a saint. He was accused by the Spanish government  of complicity in the slave insurrection of 1844 and condemned to be  shot in his native town, Matanzas. One bright morning in May he stood  by the old statue of Ferdinand VII. in the Plaza d'Armas, calmly  facing a row of muskets, along whose shining barrels the sun glinted.  The first volley failed to touch a vital spot. Bleeding from several  wounds, he still stood erect, and, pointing to his heart, said in a  clear voice, \"Aim here!\" Another mulatto author, educator and profound  thinker was Antonio Medina, a priest and professor of San Basilio  the Greater. He acquired wide reputation as a poet, novelist and  ecclesiastic, both in Spain and Cuba, and was selected by the Spanish  Academy to deliver the oration on the anniversary of Cerantes' death  in Madrid. His favorite Cuban pupil was Juan Gaulberto Gomez, the  mulatto journalist, who has been imprisoned time and again for  offences against the Spanish press laws. Senor Gomez, whose home is in  Matanzas, is now on the shady side of 40, a spectacled and scholarly  looking man. After the peace of Zanjon he collaborated in the  periodicals published by the Marquis of Sterling. In '79 he founded in  Havana, the newspaper La Fraternidad, devoted to the interest of the  colored race. For a certain fiery editorial he was deported to Centa  and kept there two years. Then he went to Madrid and assumed the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11114"],[0,"Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, (#15)"],[1,"  of our country or interest in, or knowledge of, the history of our      liberties, to whom, after a short residence, we give a full share      in our government. The result begins to be alarming--enormous      taxation, purchasable votes, demagogism,--all these alarm the      more thoughtful, and we are not yet sure of the end. It is a wise      thought that the possible bayonet or ruder weapon in the hands      of our new citizens would be even worse than the ballot, and our      safer course is to give the immigrants a stake and interest in      the government. But when we learn that on an average one thousand      immigrants per week landed at the port of Boston in the past      calendar year, is it not well to consider carefully how we double,      and more than double, the popular vote, with all its dangers and      its ingredients of ignorance and irresponsibility. Last of all, it      must be considered that the lives of men and women are essentially      different.        One sex lives in public, in constant conflict with the world; the      other sex must live chiefly in private and domestic life, or      the race will be without homes and gradually die out. If nearly      one-half of the male voters of our State forego their duty or      privilege, as is the fact, what proportion of women would exercise      the suffrage? Probably a very small one. The heaviest vote would      be in the cities, as now, and the ignorant and unfit women would      be the ready prey of the unscrupulous demagogue. Women do not hold      a position inferior to men. In this land they have the softer      side of life--the best of everything. There are, of course,      exceptions--individuals--whose struggle in life is hard, whose      husbands and fathers are tyrants instead of protectors; so there      are bad wives, and men ruined and disheartened by selfish, idle      women.        The best work that a woman can do for the purifying of politics is      by her influence over men, by the wise training of her children,      by her intelligent, unselfish counsel to husband, brother, or      friend, by a thorough knowledge and discussion of the needs of her      community. Many laws on the statute-books of our own and other      States have been the work of women. More might be added.        It is the opinion of many of us that woman's power is greater      without the ballot or possibility of office-holding for gain. When      standing outside of politics she discusses great questions upon      their merit. Much has been achieved by women in the anti-slavery      cause, the temperance cause, the improvement of public and private      charities, the reformation of criminals, all by intelligent      discussion and influence upon men. Our legislators have been ready      to listen to women and carry out their plans when well framed.        Women can do much useful public service upon boards of education,      school committees, and public charities, and are beginning to      do such work. It is of vital importance to the integrity of our      charitable and educational administration that it be kept out of      politics. Is it not well that we should have one sex who have no      political ends to serve who can fill responsible positions of      public trust? Voting alone can easily be exercised by women      without rude contact, but to attain any political power women must      affiliate themselves with men; because women will differ on      public questions, must attend primary meetings and caucuses, will      inevitably hold public office and strive for it; in short, women      must enter the political arena. This result will be repulsive to a      large portion of the sex, and would tend to make women unfeminine      and combative, which would be a detriment to society.        It is well that men after the burden and heat of the day should      return to homes where the quiet side of life is presented to them.      In these peaceful New England homes of ours, great and noble men      have been raised by wise and pious mothers, who instructed them,      not in politics, but in those general principles of justice,      integrity, and unselfishness which belong to and will insure      statesmanship in the men who are true to them. Here is the      stronghold of the sex, weakest in body, powerful for good or evil      over the stronger one, whom women sway and govern, not by the      ballot and by greater numbers but by those gentle influences      designed by the Creator to soften and subdue man's ruder nature.        CLARA T. LEONARD.    Mr. HOAR. The Senator from Missouri has alluded to me in connection  with the name of this lady. Perhaps he will allow me to make an  additional statement to that which I furnished him, in order that the  statement about her may be complete.    All that the Senator from Missouri has said of the character and worth  of Mrs. Leonard is true. I do not know her personally. Her husband is  my respected personal friend, a lawyer of high standing and character.  All that the Senator has said of her ability is proved better than by  any other testimony, by the very able and powerful letter which has  just been read. But Mrs. Leonard herself is the strongest refutation  of her own argument.    Politics, the political arena, political influence, political action  in this country consists, I suppose, in two things: one of them the  being intrusted with the administration of public affairs, and second,  having the vote counted in determining who shall be public servants,  and what public measures shall prevail in the commonwealth. Now, this  lady was intrusted for years with one of the most important public  functions ever exercised by any human being in the commonwealth  of Massachusetts. We have a board, called the board of lunacy and  charity, which controls the large charities for which Massachusetts  is famous and in many of which she was the first among civilized  communities, for the care of the pauper and the insane and the  criminal woman, and the friendless and the poor child. It is one  of the most important things, except the education of youth, which  Massachusetts does.    A little while ago a political campaign in Massachusetts turned upon a  charge which her governor made against the people of the commonwealth  in regard to the conduct of the great hospital at Tewksbury, where  she was charged by her chief executive magistrate with making sale of  human bodies, with cruelty to the poor and defenseless; and not only  the whole country, but especially the whole people of Massachusetts,  were stirred to the very depths of their souls by that accusation.  Mrs. Clara T. Leonard, the writer of this letter, came forward and  informed the people that she had been one of the board who had managed  that institution for years, that she knew all about it through and  through, that the accusation was false and a slander; and before her  word and her character the charge of that distinguished governor went  down and sunk into merited obscurity and ignominy.    Now, the question is whether the lady who can be intrusted with the  charge of one of the most important departments of government, and  whose judgment in regard to its character or proper administration is  to be taken as gospel by the people where her reputation extends, is  not fit to be trusted to have her vote counted when the question  is who is to be the next person who is to be trusted with that  administration. Mrs. Leonard's mistake is not in misunderstanding the  nature either of woman or of man, which she understands perfectly; it  is in misunderstanding the nature of politics, that is, the political  arena; and this lady has been in the political arena for the last  ten years of her life, one of the most important and potent forces  therein.    It is true, as she says, that the wife and the mother educate the  child and the man, and when the great function of the state, as we  hold in our State and as is fast being held everywhere, is also the  education of the child and the man, how does it degrade that wife and  mother, whose important function it is to do this thing, to utter  her voice and have her vote counted in regard to the methods and the  policies by which that education shall be conducted?    Why, Mr. President, Mrs. Leonard says in that letter that woman, the  wife and the maiden and the daughter, has no political ends to serve.  If political ends be to desire office for the greed of gain, if  political ends be to get an unjust power over other men, if political  ends be to get political office by bribery or by mob violence or by  voting through the shutter of a beer-house, that is true: but the  persons who are in favor of this measure believe that those very  things that Mrs. Leonard holds up as the proper ends in the life of  women are political ends and nothing else; that the education of the  child, that the preservation of the purity of the home, that the care  for the insane and the idiot and the blind and the deaf and the ruined  and deserted, are not only political ends but are the chief political  ends for which this political body, the state, is created: and those  who desire the help of women in the administration of the state desire  it because of the ability which could write such a letter as that on  the wrong side, and because the qualities of heart and brain which God  has given to understand this class of political ends better than He  has given it to the masculine heart and brain are needed for their  administration.    I have no word of disrespect for Mrs. Leonard, but I say that, in  spite of herself and her letter, her life and her character are the  most abundant and ample refutation of the belief which she erroneously  thinks she entertains. Nobody invites these ladies to a contest of  bayonets; nobody who believes that government is a matter of mere  physical force asks the co-operation of"]]]
