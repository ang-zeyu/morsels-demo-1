It is something strangely dreamlike to lie in the water in the    quiet, warm light, gently carried along by the stream; to look at    the sky with the moon and stars above one, and, on either side,    to see the wooded mountain-tops and castle parapets in the    moonlight, and to hear nothing but the gentle rippling of one's    own motion. I should like a swim like this every evening. Then I    drank some very good wine, and sat long talking with Lynar on the    balcony, with the Rhine beneath us. My little Testament and the    starry heavens brought us on Christian topics, and I long shook    at the Rousseau-like virtue of his soul.\"      \"Yesterday I was at Wiesbaden, and with a feeling of melancholy    revisited the scenes of former folly. May it please God to fill    with His clear and strong wine this vessel in which the champagne    of twenty-one years foamed so uselessly.... I do not understand    how a man who reflects on himself, and still knows, and will    know, nothing of God, can endure his life for contempt and    weariness. I do not know how I endured this in old days; if, as    then, I were to live without God, thee, and the children, I do    not know why I should not put life aside like a dirty shirt; and    yet most of my acquaintances live thus.\"    Now let us see what he thinks of his new duties:      \"Our intercourse here is at best nothing but a mutual suspicion    and espionage; if only there was anything to spy out and to hide!    It is pure trifles with which they worry themselves, and I find    these diplomatists with their airs of confidence and their petty    fussiness much more absurd than the member of the Second Chamber    in his conscious dignity. Unless some external events take place,    and we clever men of the Diet can neither direct nor foresee    them, I know already what we shall bring about in one or two or    three years, and will do it in twenty-four hours if the others    will only be reasonable and truthful for a single day. I am    making tremendous progress in the art of saying nothing in many    words; I write reports many pages long, which are smooth and    finished like leading articles, and if Manteuffel after reading    them can say what they contain, he can do more than I. We all do    as though we believed of each other that we are full of thoughts    and plans, if only we would express them, and all the time we    none of us know a hair's breadth more what will become of    Germany.\"    Of the Austrian Envoy who was President of the Diet he writes:      \"Thun in his outward appearance has something of a hearty good    fellow mixed with a touch of the Vienna _roue_. Underneath this    he hides, I will not say great political power and intellectual    gifts, but an uncommon cleverness and cunning, which with great    presence of mind appears from underneath the mask of harmless    good-humour as soon as politics are concerned. I consider him as    an opponent who is dangerous to anyone who honestly trusts him,    instead of paying back in his own coin.\"    His judgment on his other colleagues is equally decisive; of the  Austrian diplomatists he writes:      \"one must never expect that they will make what is right the    foundation of their policy for the simple reason that it is the    right. Cautious dishonesty is the characteristic of their    association with us. They have nothing which awakens confidence.    They intrigue under the mask of good-fellowship.\"    It was impossible to look for open co-operation from them;      \"their mouths are full of the necessity for common action, but    when it is a question of furthering our wishes, then officially    it is, 'We will not oppose,' and a secret pleasure in preparing    obstacles.\"    It was just the same with the envoys of the other countries: with few  exceptions there is none for whom right has any value in itself.      \"They are caricatures of diplomatists who put on their official    physiognomy if I ask them for a light, and select gestures and    words with a truly Regensburg caution, if they ask for the key of    the water-closet.\" Writing to Gerlach he speaks of \"the lying,    double-tongued policy of the Austrians. Of all the lies and    intrigues that go on up and down the Rhine an honest man from the    old Mark has no conception. These South German children of nature    are very corrupt.\"    His opinion of the diplomatists does not seem to have improved as he  knew them better. Years later he wrote:      \"There are few diplomatists who in the long run do not prefer to    capitulate with their conscience and their patriotism, and to    guard the interests of their country and their sovereign with    somewhat less decision, rather than, incessantly and with danger    to their personal position, to contend with the difficulties    which are prepared for them by a powerful and unscrupulous    enemy.\"    He does not think much better of his own Prussian colleagues; he often  complains of the want of support which he received. \"With us the  official diplomacy,\" he writes, \"is capable of playing under the same  roof with strangers against their own countrymen.\"    These letters are chiefly interesting because of the light they throw on  his own character at the beginning of his diplomatic career; we must not  take them all too seriously. He was too good a raconteur not to make a  good story better, and too good a letter-writer not to add something to  the effect of his descriptions; besides, as he says elsewhere, he did  not easily see the good side of people; his eyes were sharper for their  faults than their good qualities.[4] After the first few passages of  arms he got on well enough with Thun; when he was recalled two years  later Bismarck spoke of him with much warmth. \"I like him personally,  and should be glad to have him for a neighbour at Schoenhausen.\"    It is however important to notice that the first impression made on him  by diplomatic work was that of wanton and ineffective deceit. Those who  accuse him, as is so often done, of lowering the standard of political  morality which prevails in Europe, know little of politics as they were  at the time when Schwarzenberg was the leading statesman.    It was his fate at once to be brought in close contact with the most  disagreeable side of political life. In all diplomatic work there must  be a good deal of espionage and underhand dealing. This was a part of  his duties which Bismarck had soon to learn. He was entrusted with the  management of the Press. This consisted of two parts: first of all, he  had to procure the insertion of articles in influential papers in a  sense agreeable to the plans of the Prussian Government; secondly, when  hostile articles appeared, or inconvenient information was published, he  had to trace the authors of it,--find out by whom the obnoxious paper  had been inspired, or who had conveyed the secret information. This is a  form of activity of which it is of course not possible to give any full  account; it seems, however, clear that in a remarkably short time  Bismarck shewed great aptitude for his new duties. His letters to  Manteuffel are full of curious information as to the intrigues of those  who are hostile to Prussia. He soon learns to distrust the information  supplied by the police; all through his life he had little respect for  this department of the Prussian State. He soon had agents of his own. We  find him gaining secret information as to the plans of the Ultramontane  party in Baden from a compositor at Freiburg who was in his pay. On  other occasions, when a Court official at Berlin had conveyed to the  newspapers private information, Bismarck was soon able to trace him out.  We get the impression, both from his letters and from what other  information we possess, that all the diplomatists of Germany were  constantly occupied in calumniating one another through anonymous  contributions to a venal Press.    It is characteristic of the customs of the time that he had to warn his  wife that all her letters to him would be read in the post-office before  he received them. It was not only the Austrians who used these methods;  each of the Prussian Ministers would have his own organ which he would  use for his own purposes, and only too probably to attack his own  colleagues. It was at this time that a curious fact came to light with  regard to Herr von Prokesch-Osten, the Austrian Ambassador at Berlin. He  had been transferred from Berlin to Frankfort, and on leaving his house  sold some of his furniture. In a chest of drawers was found a large  bundle of papers consisting of newspaper articles in his handwriting,  which had been communicated to different papers, attacking the Prussian  Government, to which he at the time was accredited. Of Prokesch it is  that Bismarck once writes: \"As to his statements I do not know how much  you will find to be Prokesch, and how much to be true.\" On another  occasion, before many witnesses, Bismarck had disputed some statement he  made. \"If it is not true,\" cried Prokesch, \"then I should have lied in  the name of the Royal and Imperial Government.\" \"Certainly,\" answered  Bismarck. There was a dead pause in the conversation. Prokesch  afterwards officially admitted that the statement had been incorrect.    This association with the Press formed in him a habit of mind which he  never lost: the proper use of newspapers seemed to him, as to most  German statesmen, to be not the expression of public opinion but the  support of the Government; if a paper is opposed to the Government, the  assumption seems to be that it is bribed by some other State.      \"The whole country would rejoice if some of the papers which are    supported by foreign sources were suppressed, with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#15)"],[1,"seen me lift, the digging, the planting, the rowing, and the walking I do,  that they do not utterly contemn me, and indeed they seem lost in  amazement at it.    Talking of these pine-landers--gypsies, without any of the romantic  associations that belong to the latter people--led us to the origin of  such a population, slavery; and you may be sure I listened with infinite  interest to the opinions of a man of uncommon shrewdness and sagacity, who  was born in the very bosom of it, and has passed his whole life among  slaves. If any one is competent to judge of its effects, such a man is  the one; and this was his verdict, 'I hate slavery with all my heart; I  consider it an absolute curse wherever it exists. It will keep those  states where it does exist fifty years behind the others in improvement  and prosperity.' Further on in the conversation, he made this most  remarkable observation, 'As for its being an irremediable evil--a thing  not to be helped or got rid of--that's all nonsense; for as soon as people  become convinced that it is their interest to get rid of it, they will  soon find the means to do so, depend upon it.' And undoubtedly this is  true. This is not an age, nor yours a country, where a large mass of  people will long endure what they perceive to be injurious to their  fortunes and advancement. Blind as people often are to their highest and  truest interests, your country folk have generally shown remarkable  acuteness in finding out where their worldly progress suffered let or  hindrance, and have removed it with laudable alacrity. Now, the fact is  not at all as we at the north are sometimes told, that the southern  slaveholders deprecate the evils of slavery quite as much as we do; that  they see all its miseries; that, moreover, they are most anxious to get  rid of the whole thing, but want the means to do so, and submit most  unwillingly to a necessity from which they cannot extricate themselves.  All this I thought might be true, before I went to the south, and often  has the charitable supposition checked the condemnation which was  indignantly rising to my lips against these murderers of their brethren's  peace. A little reflection, however, even without personal observation,  might have convinced me that this could not be the case. If the majority  of Southerners were satisfied that slavery was contrary to their worldly  fortunes, slavery would be at an end from that very moment; but the fact  is--and I have it not only from observation of my own, but from the  distinct statement of some of the most intelligent southern men that I  have conversed with--the only obstacle to immediate abolition throughout  the south is the immense value of the human property, and, to use the  words of a very distinguished Carolinian, who thus ended a long discussion  we had on the subject, 'I'll tell you why abolition is impossible: because  every healthy negro can fetch a thousand dollars in the Charleston market  at this moment.' And this opinion, you see, tallies perfectly with the  testimony of Mr. K----.    He went on to speak of several of the slaves on this estate, as persons  quite remarkable for their fidelity and intelligence, instancing old  Molly, Ned the engineer, who has the superintendence of the steam-engine  in the rice-mill, and head-man Frank, of whom indeed, he wound up the  eulogium by saying, he had quite the principles of a white man--which I  thought most equivocal praise, but he did not intend it as such. As I was  complaining to Mr. ---- of the terribly neglected condition of the dykes,  which are in some parts so overgrown with gigantic briars that 'tis  really impossible to walk over them, and the trench on one hand, and river  on the other, afford one extremely disagreeable alternatives. Mr. K----  cautioned me to be particularly on my guard not to step on the thorns of  the orange tree. These, indeed, are formidable spikes, and he assured me,  were peculiarly poisonous to the flesh. Some of the most painful and  tedious wounds he had ever seen, he said, were incurred by the negroes  running these large green thorns into their feet.    This led him to speak of the glory and beauty of the orange trees on the  island, before a certain uncommonly severe winter, a few years ago,  destroyed them all. For five miles round the banks grew a double row of  noble orange trees, as large as our orchard apple trees, covered with  golden fruit, and silver flowers. It must have been a most magnificent  spectacle, and Captain F----, too, told me, in speaking of it, that he had  brought Basil Hall here in the season of the trees blossoming, and he had  said it was as well worth crossing the Atlantic to see that, as to see the  Niagara. Of all these noble trees nothing now remains but the roots, which  bear witness to their size, and some young sprouts shooting up, affording  some hope that, in the course of years, the island may wear its bridal  garland again. One huge stump close to the door is all that remains of an  enormous tree that overtopped the house, from the upper windows of which  oranges have been gathered from off its branches, and which, one year,  bore the incredible number of 8,542 oranges. Mr. K---- assured me of this  as a positive fact, of which he had at the time made the entry in his  journal, considering such a crop from a single tree well worthy of record.  Mr. ---- was called out this evening to listen to a complaint of over  work, from a gang of pregnant women. I did not stay to listen to the  details of their petition, for I am unable to command myself on such  occasions, and Mr. ---- seemed positively degraded in my eyes, as he stood  enforcing upon these women the necessity of their fulfilling their  appointed tasks. How honorable he would have appeared to me begrimed with  the sweat and soil of the coarsest manual labour, to what he then seemed,  setting forth to these wretched, ignorant women, as a duty, their unpaid  exacted labour! I turned away in bitter disgust. I hope this sojourn among  Mr. ----'s slaves may not lessen my respect for him, but I fear it; for  the details of slave holding are so unmanly, letting alone every other  consideration, that I know not how anyone, with the spirit of a man, can  condescend to them.    I have been out again on the river, rowing. I find nothing new. Swamps  crowned with perfect evergreens are the only land (that's Irish!) about  here, and, of course, turn which way I will, the natural features of river  and shore are the same. I do not weary of these most exquisite watery  woods, but you will of my mention of them, I fear. Adieu.           *       *       *       *       *      Dearest E----. Since I last wrote to you I have been actually engaged in  receiving and returning visits; for even to this _ultima thule_ of all  civilisation do these polite usages extend. I have been called upon by  several families residing in and about Darien, and rowed over in due form  to acknowledge the honour. How shall I describe Darien to you? The  abomination of desolation is but a poor type of its forlorn appearance,  as, half buried in sand, its straggling, tumble-down wooden houses peer  over the muddy bank of the thick slimy river. The whole town lies in a bed  of sand--side walks, or mid walks, there be none distinct from each other;  at every step I took my feet were ankle deep in the soil, and I had cause  to rejoice that I was booted for the occasion. Our worthy doctor, whose  lady I was going to visit, did nothing but regret that I had not allowed  him to provide me a carriage, though the distance between his house and  the landing is not a quarter of a mile. The magnitude of the exertion  seemed to fill him with amazement, and he over and over again repeated how  impossible it would be to prevail on any of the ladies there to take such  a walk. The houses seemed scattered about here and there, apparently  without any design, and looked, for the most part, either unfinished or  ruinous. One feature of the scene alone recalled the villages of New  England--the magnificent oaks, which seemed to add to the meanness and  insignificance of the human dwellings they overshadowed by their enormous  size and grotesque forms. They reminded me of the elms of Newhaven and  Stockbridge. They are quite as large, and more picturesque, from their  sombre foliage and the infinite variety of their forms--a beauty wanting  in the New England elm, which invariably rises and spreads in a way which,  though the most graceful in the world, at length palls on the capricious  human eye, which seeks, above all other beauties, variety. Our doctor's  wife is a New England woman; how can she live here? She had the fair eyes  and hair and fresh complexion of your part of the country, and its dearly  beloved snuffle, which seemed actually dearly beloved when I heard it down  here. She gave me some violets and narcissus, already blossoming  profusely--in January--and expressed, like her husband, a thousand regrets  at my having walked so far.    A transaction of the most amusing nature occurred to-day with regard to  the resources of the Darien Bank, and the mode of carrying on business in  that liberal and enlightened institution, the funds of which I should  think quite incalculable--impalpable, certainly, they appeared by our  experience this morning.    The river, as we came home, was covered with Ocone boxes. It is well for  them they are so shallow-bottomed, for we rasped sand all the way home  through the cut, and in the shallows of the river.    I have been over the rice-mill, under the guidance of the overseer and  head-man Frank, and have been made acquainted with the whole process of  threshing the rice, which is extremely curious; and here I may again  mention another statement of Miss Martineau's, which I am told is, and I  should suppose from what I see here must be, a mistake. She states that  the chaff of the husks of the rice is "]]]
