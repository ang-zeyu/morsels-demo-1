That was the only warning Billy had of what was to come. Indeed, there  was nothing in the conversation to prepare him even in the slightest  degree for what happened when he galloped up to the corral late one  afternoon in October. It was the season of frosty mornings and of  languorous, smoke-veiled afternoons, when summer has grown weary of  resistance and winter is growing bolder in his advances, and the two  have met in a passion-warmed embrace. Billy had ridden far with  his riders and the trailing wagons, in the zest of his young  responsibility sweeping the range to its farthest boundary of river  or mountain. They were not through yet, but they had swung back within  riding distance of the home ranch and Billy had come in for nearly a  month's accumulation of mail and to see how Dill was getting on.    He was tired and dusty and hungry enough to eat the fringes off his  chaps. He came to the ground without any spring to his muscles and  walked stiffly to the stable door, leading his horse by the bridle  reins. He meant to turn him loose in the stable, which was likely  to be empty, and shut the door upon him until he himself had eaten  something. The door was open and he went in unthinkingly, seeing  nothing in the gloom. It was his horse which snorted and settled  back on the reins and otherwise professed his reluctance to enter the  place.    Charming Billy, as was consistent with his hunger and his weariness  and the general mood of him, \"cussed\" rather fluently and jerked the  horse forward a step or two before he saw some one poised hesitatingly  upon the manger in the nearest stall.    \"I guess he's afraid of _me_,\" ventured a voice that he felt to his  toes. \"I was hunting eggs. They lay them always in the awkwardest  places to get at.\" She scrambled down and came toward him, bareheaded,  with the sleeves of her blue-and-white striped dress rolled to her  elbows--Flora Bridger, if you please.    Billy stood still and stared, trying to make the reality of her  presence seem reasonable; and he failed utterly. His most coherent  thought at that moment was a shamed remembrance of the way he had  sworn at his horse.    Miss Bridger stood aside from the wild-eyed animal and smiled upon his  master. \"In the language of the range, 'come alive,' Mr. Boyle,\" she  told him. \"Say how-de-do and be nice about it, or I'll see that  your coffee is muddy and your bread burned and your steak absolutely  impregnable; because I'm here to _stay_, mind you. Mama Joy and I have  possession of your kitchen, and so you'd better--\"    \"I'm just trying to let it soak into my brains,\" said Billy. \"You're  just about the last person on earth I'd expect to see here, hunting  eggs like you had a right--\"    \"I _have_ a right,\" she asserted. \"Your Dilly--he's a perfect love,  and I told him so--said I was to make myself perfectly at home. So I  have a perfect right to be here, and a perfect right to hunt eggs;  and if I could make that sentence more 'perfect,' I would do it.\" She  tilted her head to one side and challenged a laugh with her eyes.    Charming Billy relaxed a bit, yanked the horse into a stall and tied  him fast. \"Yuh might tell me how it happened that you're here,\" he  hinted, looking at her over the saddle. He had apparently forgotten  that he had intended leaving the horse saddled until he had rested  and eaten--and truly it would be a shame to hurry from so unexpected a  tete-a-tete.    Miss Bridger pulled a spear of blue-joint hay from a crack in the wall  and began breaking it into tiny pieces. \"It sounds funny, but Mr.  Dill bought father out to get a cook. The way it was, father has been  simply crazy to try his luck up in Klondyke; it's just like him to  get the fever after everybody else has had it and recovered. When the  whole country was wild to go he turned up his nose at the idea. And  now, mind you, after one or two whom he knew came back with some gold,  he must go and dig up a few million tons of it for himself! Your Dilly  is rather bright, do you know? He met father and heard all about his  complaint--how he'd go to the Klondyke in a minute if he could only  get the ranch and Mama Joy and me off his hands--so what does Dilly do  but buy the old ranch and hire Mama Joy and me to come here and keep  house! Father, I am ashamed to say, was _abjectly_ grateful to get  rid of his incumbrances, and he--he hit the trail immediately.\" She  stopped and searched absently with her fingers for another spear of  hay.    \"Do you know, Mr. Boyle, I think men are the most irresponsible  creatures! A _woman_ wouldn't turn her family over to a neighbor and  go off like that for three or four years, just chasing a sunbeam.  I--I'm horribly disappointed in father. A man has no right to a family  when he puts everything else first in his mind. He'll be gone three  or four years, and will spend all he has, and we--can shift for  ourselves. He only left us a hundred dollars, to use in an emergency!  He was afraid he might need the rest to buy out a claim or get  machinery or something. So if we don't like it here we'll have to  stay, anyway. We--we're 'up against it,' as you fellows say.\"    [Illustration: \"WE--WE'RE 'UP AGAINST IT,' AS YOU FELLOWS SAY.\"]    Charming Billy, fumbling the latigo absently, felt a sudden  belligerence toward her father. \"He ought to have his head punched  good and plenty!\" he blurted sympathetically.    To his amazement Miss Bridger drew herself up and started for the  door. \"I'm very sorry you don't like the idea of us being here, Mr.  Boyle,\" she replied coldly, \"but we happen to _be_ here, and I'm  afraid you'll just have to make the best of it!\"    Billy was at that moment pulling off the saddle. By the time he had  carried it from the stall, hung it upon its accustomed spike and  hurried to the door, Miss Bridger was nowhere to be seen. He said  \"Hell!\" under his breath, and took long steps to the house, but  she did not appear to be there. It was \"Mama Joy,\" yellow-haired,  extremely blue-eyed, and full-figured, who made his coffee and gave  him delicious things to eat--things which he failed properly to  appreciate, because he ate with his ears perked to catch the faintest  sound of another woman's steps and with his eyes turning constantly  from door to window. He did not even know half the time what Mama  Joy was saying, or see her dimples when she smiled; and Mama Joy was  rather proud of her dimples and was not accustomed to having them  overlooked.    He was too proud to ask, at supper time, where Miss Bridger was. She  did not choose to give him sight of her, and so he talked and talked  to Dill, and even to Mama Joy, hoping that Miss Bridger could hear  him and know that he wasn't worrying a darned bit. He did not consider  that he had said anything so terrible. What had she gone on like that  about her father for, if she couldn't stand for any one siding in with  her? Maybe he had put his sympathy a little too strong, but that is  the way men handle each other. She ought to know he wasn't sorry she  was there. Why, of _course_ she knew that! The girl wasn't a fool, and  she must know a fellow would be plumb tickled to have her around every  day. Well, anyway, he wasn't going to begin by letting her lead him  around by the nose, and he wasn't going to crumple down on his knees  and tell her to please walk all over him.    \"Well, anyway,\" he summed up at bedtime with a somewhat doubtful  satisfaction, \"I guess she's kinda got over the notion that I'm so  blame _comfortable_--like I was an old grandpa-setting-in-the-corner.  She's _got_ to get over it, by thunder! I ain't got to that point yet;  hell, no! I should say I hadn't!\"    It is a fact that when he rode away just after sunrise next morning  (he would have given much if duty and his pride had permitted him to  linger a while) no one could have accused him of being in any degree a  comfortable young man. For his last sight of Miss Bridger had been the  flutter of her when she disappeared through the stable door.          CHAPTER XIII.    _Billy Meets the Pilgrim._      The weeks that followed did not pass as quickly as before for Billy  Boyle, nor did raking the range with his riders bring quite as keen  a satisfaction with life. Always, when he rode apart in the soft haze  and watched the sky-line shimmer and dance toward him and then retreat  like a teasing maid, his thoughts wandered from the range and the  cattle and the men who rode at his bidding and rested with one slim  young woman who puzzled and tantalized him and caused him more mental  discomfort than he had ever known in his life before that night when  she entered so unexpectedly the line-camp and his life. He scarcely  knew just how he did feel toward her; sometimes he hungered for  her with every physical and mental fibre and was tempted to leave  everything and go to her. Times there were when he resented deeply  her treatment of him and repeated to himself the resolution not to lie  down and let her walk all over him just because he liked her.    When the round-up was over and the last of the beef on the way  to Chicago, and the fat Irish cook gathered up the reins of his  four-horse team, mounted with a grunt to the high seat of the mess  wagon and pointed his leaders thankfully into the trail which led to  the Double-Crank, though the sky was a hard gray and the wind blew  chill with the bite of winter and though tiny snowflakes drifted  aimlessly to earth with a quite deceitful innocence, as if they knew  nothing of more to come and were only idling through the air, the  blood of Charming Billy rioted warmly through his veins and his voice  had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#15)"],[1," idling there, silent, content to watch the  red glow pass away from the buttes and peaks, the color deepening  downward to meet the ebon shades of night creeping up like a dark  tide.    On turning toward the camp we essayed a short cut, which brought us to  a deep hollow with stony walls, which seemed better to go around. The  hollow, however, was quite long and we decided presently to cross it.  We descended a little way when Jones suddenly barred my progress with  his big arm.    \"Listen,\" he whispered.    It was quiet in the woods; only a faint breeze stirred the pine  needles; and the weird, gray darkness seemed to be approaching under  the trees.    I heard the patter of light, hard hoofs on the scaly sides of the  hollow.    \"Deer?\" I asked my companion in a low voice.    \"Yes; see,\" he replied, pointing ahead, \"just right under that broken  wall of rock; right there on this side; they're going down.\"    I descried gray objects the color of the rocks, moving down like  shadows.    \"Have they scented us?\"    \"Hardly; the breeze is against us. Maybe they heard us break a twig.  They've stopped, but they are not looking our way. Now I wonder--\"    Rattling of stones set into movement by some quick, sharp action, an  indistinct crash, but sudden, as of the impact of soft, heavy bodies,  a strange wild sound preceded in rapid succession violent brushings  and thumpings in the scrub of the hollow.    \"Lion jumped a deer,\" yelled Jones. \"Right under our eyes! Come on!  Hi! Hi! Hi!\"    He ran down the incline yelling all of the way, and I kept close to  him, adding my yells to his, and gripping my revolver. Toward the  bottom the thicket barred our progress so that we had to smash through  and I came out a little ahead of Jones. And farther up the hollow I  saw a gray swiftly bounding object too long and too low for a deer,  and I hurriedly shot six times at it.    \"By George! Come here,\" called my companion. \"How's this for quick  work? It's a yearling doe.\"    In another moment I leaned over a gray mass huddled at Jones feet. It  was a deer gasping and choking. I plainly heard the wheeze of blood  in its throat, and the sound, like a death-rattle, affected me  powerfully. Bending closer, I saw where one side of the neck, low  down, had been terribly lacerated.    \"Waa-hoo!\" pealed down the slope.    \"That's Emett,\" cried Jones, answering the signal. \"If you have  another shot put this doe out of agony.\"    But I had not a shot left, nor did either of us have a clasp knife.  We stood there while the doe gasped and quivered. The peculiar sound,  probably made by the intake of air through the laceration of the  throat, on the spur of the moment seemed pitifully human.    I felt that the struggle for life and death in any living thing was  a horrible spectacle. With great interest I had studied natural  selection, the variability of animals under different conditions of  struggling existence, the law whereby one animal struck down and  devoured another. But I had never seen and heard that law enacted on  such a scale; and suddenly I abhorred it.    Emett strode to us through the gathering darkness.    \"What's up?\" he asked quickly.    He carried my Remington in one hand and his Winchester in the other;  and he moved so assuredly and loomed up so big in the dusk that I  experienced a sudden little rush of feeling as to what his advent  might mean at a time of real peril.    [Illustration: JONES ABOUT TO LASSO A MOUNTAIN LION]    [Illustration: REMAINS OF A DEER KILLED BY LIONS]    \"Emett, I've lived to see many things,\" replied Jones, \"but this is  the first time I ever saw a lion jump a deer right under my nose!\"    As Emett bent over to seize the long ears of the deer, I noticed the  gasping had ceased.    \"Neck broken,\" he said, lifting the head. \"Well, I'm danged. Must have  been an all-fired strong lion. He'll come back, you may be sure of  that. Let's skin out the quarters and hang the carcass up in a tree!\"    We returned to camp in a half an hour, the richer for our walk by a  quantity of fresh venison. Upon being acquainted with our adventure,  Jim expressed himself rather more fairly than was his customary way.    \"Shore that beats hell! I knowed there was a lion somewheres, because  Don wouldn't lie down. I'd like to get a pop at the brute.\"    I believed Jim's wish found an echo in all our hearts. At any rate  to hear Emett and Jones express regret over the death of the doe  justified in some degree my own feelings, and I thought it was not  so much the death, but the lingering and terrible manner of it, and  especially how vividly it connoted the wild-life drama of the plateau.  The tragedy we had all but interrupted occurred every night, perhaps  often in the day and likely at different points at the same time.  Emett told how he had found fourteen piles of bleached bones and dried  hair in the thickets of less than a mile of the hollow on which we  were encamped.    \"We'll rope the danged cats, boys, or we'll kill them.\"    \"It's blowing cold. Hey, Navvy, _coco! coco!_\" called Emett.    The Indian, carefully laying aside his cigarette, kicked up the fire  and threw on more wood.    \"_Discass!_ (cold),\" he said to me. \"_Coco, bueno_ (fire good).\"    I replied, \"Me savvy--yes.\"    \"Sleep-ie?\" he asked.    \"Mucha,\" I returned.    While we carried on a sort of novel conversation full of Navajo,  English, and gestures, darkness settled down black. I saw the stars  disappear; the wind changing to the north grew colder and carried  a breath of snow. I like north wind best--from under the warm  blankets--because of the roar and lull and lull and roar in the pines.  Crawling into the bed presently, I lay there and listened to the  rising storm-wind for a long time. Sometimes it swelled and crashed  like the sound of a breaker on the beach, but mostly, from a low  incessant moan, it rose and filled to a mighty rush, then suddenly  lulled. This lull, despite a wakeful, thronging mind, was conducive to  sleep.      IV    To be awaked from pleasant dreams is the lot of man. The Navajo  aroused me with his singing, and when I peeped languidly from under  the flap of my sleeping bag, I felt a cold air and saw fleecy flakes  of white drifting through the small window of my tent.    \"Snow; by all that's lucky!\" I exclaimed, remembering Jones' hopes.  Straightway my langour vanished and getting into my boots and coat I  went outside. Navvy's bed lay in six inches of snow. The forest was  beautifully white. A fine dazzling snow was falling. I walked to the  roaring camp-fire. Jim's biscuits, well-browned and of generous  size, had just been dumped into the middle of our breakfast cloth, a  tarpaulin spread on the ground; the coffee pot steamed fragrantly, and  a Dutch oven sizzled with a great number of slices of venison. \"Did  you hear the Indian chanting?\" asked Jones, who sat with his horny  hands to the blaze.    \"I heard his singing.\"    \"No, it wasn't a song; the Navajo never sings in the morning. What you  heard was his morning prayer, a chant, a religious and solemn ritual  to the break of day. Emett says it is a custom of the desert tribe.  You remember how we saw the Mokis sitting on the roofs of their little  adobe huts in the gray of the morning. They always greet the sun in  that way. The Navajos chant.\"    It certainly was worth remembering, I thought, and mentally observed  that I would wake up thereafter and listen to the Indian.    \"Good luck and bad!\" went on Jones. \"Snow is what we want, but now we  can't find the scent of our lion of last night.\"    Low growls and snarls attracted me. Both our captives presented sorry  spectacles; they were wet, dirty, bedraggled. Emett had chopped down a  small pine, the branches of which he was using to make shelter for the  lions. While I looked on Tom tore his to pieces several times, but the  lioness crawled under hers and began licking her chops. At length  Tom, seeing that Emett meant no underhand trick, backed out of the  drizzling snow and lay down.    Emett had already constructed a shack for the hounds. It was a way of  his to think of everything. He had the most extraordinary ability. A  stroke of his axe, a twist of his great hands, a turn of this or that  made camp a more comfortable place. And if something, no matter what,  got out of order or broken, there was Emett to show what it was to be  a man of the desert. It had been my good fortune to see many able  men on the trail and round the camp-fire, but not one of them even  approached Emett's class. When I said a word to him about his knack  with things, his reply was illuminating: \"I'm fifty-eight, and four  out of every five nights of my life I have slept away from home on the  ground.\"    \"_Chineago!_\" called Jim, who had begun with all of us to assimilate a  little of the Navajo's language.    Whereupon we fell to eating with appetite unknown to any save hunters.  Somehow the Indian had gravitated to me at meal times, and now he sat  cross-legged beside me, holding out his plate and looking as hungry as  Moze. At first he had always asked for the same kind of food that  I happened to have on my own plate. When I had finished and had no  desire to eat more, he gave up his faculty of imitation and asked for  anything he could get. The Navajo had a marvelous appetite. He liked  sweet things, sugar best of all. It was a fatal error to let him get  his hands on a can of fruit. Although he inspired Jones with disgust  and Jim with worse, he was a source of unfailing pleasure to me. He  called me \"Mista Gay\" and he pronounced the words haltingly in low  voice and with unmistakable respect.    \"What's on for today?\" queried Emett.    \"I guess we may as well hang around camp and rest the hounds,\" replied  Jones. \"I did intend to go after the lion that killed the deer, but  this snow has taken away the scent.\"    \"Shore it'll stop snowin' soon,\" said Jim.    The falling snow had thinned out and looked "]]]
