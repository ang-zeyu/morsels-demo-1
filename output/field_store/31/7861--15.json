I  found about the fires of the natives a number of small balls of dry fibre  resembling hemp, and I at first supposed it to be a preparation for  making nets, having seen such on the Darling.    FOOD OF THE NATIVES DISCOVERED.    Barney the native however soon set me right by taking up the root of a  large reed or bulrush which grew in a dry lagoon hard by, and by showing  me how the natives extracted from the rhizoma a quantity of gluten; and  this was what they eat, obtaining it by chewing the fibre. They take up  the root of the bulrush in lengths of about eight or ten inches, peel off  the outer rind and lay it a little before the fire; then they twist and  loosen the fibres, when a quantity of gluten, exactly resembling wheaten  flour, may be shaken out, affording at all times a ready and wholesome  food. It struck me that this gluten, which they call Balyan, must be the  staff of life to the tribes inhabiting these morasses, where tumuli and  other traces of human beings were more abundant than at any part of the  Lachlan that I had visited.    HORSES KNOCK UP.    April 25.    We continued our route upwards along the right bank of the Lachlan on a  bearing of 36 degrees East of North taken from Mr. Oxley's map: and  coming to the river at nine miles we again watered our horses, and rested  them for they were very weak. After travelling fifteen miles one of them  rode by Woods, who carried the theodolite, knocked up when we were far  from the Lachlan. With some difficulty we however got it on until we  reached the river and, finding water, we halted for the day after a ride  of twenty-one miles.    SCENERY ON THE LACHLAN.    The scenery was highly picturesque at that part of the banks of the  Lachlan notwithstanding the dreary level of the naked plains back from  them.    CHARACTER OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TREES.    The yarra grew here, as on the Darling, to a gigantic size, the height  sometimes exceeding 100 feet; and its huge gnarled trunks, wild  romantic-formed branches often twisting in coils, shining white or light  red bark, and dark masses of foliage, with consequent streaks of shadow  below, frequently produced effects fully equal to the wildest forest  scenery of Ruysdael or Waterloo. Often as I hurried along did I take my  last look with reluctance of scenes forming the most captivating studies.  The yarra is certainly a pleasing object in various respects; its shining  bark and lofty height inform the traveller of a distant probability of  water, or at least of the bed of a river or lake; and being visible over  all other trees it usually marks the course of rivers so well that, in  travelling along the Darling and Lachlan, I could with ease trace the  general course of the river without approaching its banks until I wished  to encamp. The nature and character of several other species of the genus  eucalyptus were nevertheless very different and peculiar. The small kind,  covered with a rough bark and never exceeding the size of fruit trees in  an orchard and called, I believe, by Mr. Oxley, the dwarf-box, but by the  natives goborro, grows only on plains subject to inundation, and it  usually bears on the lower part of the trunk the mark of the water by  which it is at times surrounded. Between the goborro and the yarra there  seems this difference: the yarra grows only on the banks of rivers,  lakes, or ponds, from the water of which the roots derive nourishment;  but when the trunk itself has been too long immersed the tree dies; as  appeared on various lakes and in reedy swamps on the Lachlan. The goborro  on the contrary seldom grows on the banks of a running stream, but seems  to thrive in inundations, however long their duration. Mr. Oxley remarked  during his wet journey that there was always water where these trees  grew. We found them in most cases during a dry season, a sure indication  that none was to be discovered near them. It may be observed however that  all permanent waters are invariably surrounded by the yarra. These  peculiarities we ascertained only after examining many a hopeless hollow  where grew the goborro by itself; nor until I had found my sable guides  eagerly scanning the yarra from afar when in search of water, and  condemning any distant view of goborro trees as hopeless during that dry  season. In describing the trees which ornamented the river scenery I must  not omit to mention a long-leaved acacia whose dark stems and sombre  foliage, drooping over the bank, presented a striking and pleasing  contrast to the yarra trunks, and the light soil of the water-worn banks.  The bimbel (or spear-wood) which grows on dry forest land, the pine-like  Callitris pyramidalis on red sandhills, and a variety of acacias in the  scrubs, generally present groups of the most picturesque description.    RETURN TO THE PARTY.    April 26.    We continued towards the camp which I reached at about nine miles and  found that nothing extraordinary had occurred during my absence. The  overseer had been again to Coccoparra to hunt the wild cattle (by my  orders) yet, although he found a herd and put two bullets through one  animal, all escaped. The party thought to hem them in by driving them to  the foot of the range; but as soon as the cattle found themselves beset  they climbed, apparently without much difficulty, the abrupt rocky face  of the hills, throwing down on their ascent the large fragments and loose  stones that lay in their way and which, rolling down the declivities,  checked their pursuers until the bullocks, wounded and all, escaped.    DEAD BODY FOUND IN THE WATER.    The working cattle had little good grass at the camp, and another reason  I had for quitting it was the state of the waterhole. Even at first it  was small and the water had a slightly putrid taste, the cause of which  having been discovered, the water had become still less palatable. Piper,  our native interpreter, in diving for fish on the previous day had, to  his horror, brought up on his spear, instead of a fish, the putrid leg of  a man! Our guide (to the Booraran) had left the camp during my absence;  and it was said that he was aware of the circumstance of the body of a  native having been thrown into the hole; for he had abstained from  drinking any of the water.    I had still however a desire to reconnoitre the country to the southward  in hopes that I might see enough of its features to enable me to arrive  at some conclusion as to the final course of the Lachlan, and to arrange  our further journey accordingly.    ASCEND BURRADORGANG.    April 27.    I rode to Burradorgang, a saddle-backed hill bearing 117 degrees from our  camp and distant 19 miles. This hill I found to be the most western and  the last between the Murrumbidgee and the Lachlan. I only reached its  base with tired horses an hour before dusk. Just as I dismounted and  began to climb the rocks a drizzling rain came on from the north-west,  and it unfortunately first obscured that portion of the horizon which I  was most anxious to see.    VIEW FROM BURRADORGANG.    To the northward, eastward, and southward however it continued clear, and  the points visible in those directions fully occupied my attention until  the western horizon became distinct. I was at once enabled to identify  this hill with an angle observed when on the top of Yerrarar. Granard and  the principal summits of Peel's and Macquarie's ranges were visible and,  as the sky cleared I could see Warranary, that south-western extremity of  the Mount Granard range already mentioned, and which I was enabled by my  observations here to connect with the trigonometrical survey. But even  from this summit nothing could be observed beyond besides the  continuation of the range towards the north-west at an immense distance.  The object next in importance was the country between me and the  Murrumbidgee in a south-west direction. I expected that some kind of  ridge or hills above the common level would separate that river from the  Lachlan if the courses of both rivers continued to separate to any  considerable distance westward. But although I perceived a low ridge  extending towards the west from the most southern part of Peel's range I  also saw that it terminated in the low level of the plains at about 20  degrees West of South.    A RAINY NIGHT WITHOUT SHELTER.    Burradorgang, this last of hills, consisted of ferruginous sandstone like  all the others I saw further in the interior during the former journey. I  descended to its base just as darkness came on; and myself and the men  with me were forced to pass the night exposed to the wind and rain at a  place where nevertheless we could find no water for our horses.    April 28.    The rain ceased some time before daybreak, but the weather continued  cloudy and, fogs hanging on the distant horizon, I was not tempted again  to ascend the mountain as I certainly should have done had the morning  been clear. We mounted and retraced our steps to the camp. The country  between this hill and the river consisted chiefly of soft red soil in  which grew the cypress-like callitris, also acacia, and the bimbel or  spear-wood.* It seemed to consist of a very low undulation, extending  from the hill into the great angle formed by the Lachlan, whose general  course changes near that camp from west to south-west. There was however  a tract extending southward from the river for about three miles, on  which grew yarra trees bearing the marks of occasional floods to the  height of a foot above the common surface. This ground was probably in  part under water when Mr. Oxley passed it, as he represents a swamp or  morass in his map within this bend of the river. I found on the low  tract, between Burradorgang and our camp, a new curious species of  solanum, so completely covered with yellow prickles that its flowers and  leaves could scarcely be seen.**    (*"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13053"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art, and Science — Volume 1, No. (#15)"],[1,"eat a  number of little stars, and then cast them up. The man had seen the  eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. Like the red Indian, he recollects  every bush, every stone, every hillock, every pond necessary to find  his way, and never loses himself, however great the distance he may  have to travel.    His food is boiled beef and horse's flesh, cow's and mare's milk. But  his chief delicacy is raw and melted fat, while quantity is always  the chief merit of a repast. He mixes likewise a mess of fish, flour,  milk, fat, and a kind of bark, the latter to augment the volume. Both  men and women smoke inordinately, swallowing the vapor, as do many  dwellers in civilized lands--a most pernicious and terrible habit.  Brandy is their most precious drink, their own koumise having not  sufficient strength to satisfy them. In summer they wander about in  tents collecting hay, in winter they dwell in the yourte or hut, which  is a wooden frame, of beehive shape, covered with grass, turf, and  clay, with windows of clear ice. The very poor dig three feet below  the soil; the rich have a wooden floor level with the adjacent ground,  while rude benches all round serve as beds, divided one from the other  by partitions. The fireplace is in the middle, inclining toward the  door. A pipe carries away the smoke.    It was almost dark when Ivan halted before the yourte of Sakalar. It  was at once larger and cleaner to the eye than any of those around. It  had also numerous outhouses full of cows, and one or two men to tend  these animals were smoking their pipes at the door. Ivan gave his  horses to one of them, who knew him, and entered the hut. Sakalar, a  tall, thin, hardy man of about fifty, was just about to commence his  evening meal. A huge mass of boiled meat, stewed fish, and a sort of  soup, were ready; and a young girl about eighteen, neatly dressed,  clean, and pretty--all owing to her Yakoutsk education--was serving  the hunter.    \"Spirit of the woods protect me!\" shrieked the girl, spilling half of  the soup upon the floor.    \"What wild horses have you seen, Kolina?\" cried the hunter, who had  been a little scalded; and then seeing Ivan, added, \"A Yakouta welcome  to you, my son! My old heart is glad, and I am warm enough to melt an  iceberg at the sight of you, Ivan. Kolina, quick! another platter, a  fresh mug, the best bottle of brandy, and my red pipe from Moscow!\"    No need was there for the hunter to speak. Kolina, alert as a  reindeer, had sprung up from the low bench, and quickly brought forth  all their holiday ware, and even began to prepare a cake, such as Ivan  himself had taught her to make, knowing that be liked some sort of  bread with his meals.    \"And where are you going?\" cried Sakalar when the young man had  somewhat appeased his hunger.    \"To the North Sea, in search of the great ivory mine!\" said Ivan,  abruptly.    Kolina started back in terror and surprise, while Sakalar fixed  his keen eye on the youth with sorrow and curiosity, and almost  unequivocally, testified his belief that his favorite pupil in the  chase was mad. But Ivan rose and bade the serving-man of the rich  Yacouta bring in his boxes, and opened up his store of treasures.  There was tea for Kolina; and for Sakalar, rum, brandy, powder,  guns, tobacco, knives--all that could tempt a Yakouta. The father  and daughter examined them with pleasure for some time, but presently  Kolina shook her head.    \"Ivan,\" said Sakalar, \"all this is to tempt the poor Yakouta to cross  the wilderness of ice. It is much riches, but not enough to make  Sakalar mad. The mine is guarded by evil beings. But speak, lad, why  would you go there?\"    \"Let Kolina give me a pipe and I will tell my story,\" said Ivan; and  filling his glass, the young fur-trader told the story of his love,  and his bargain with the prudent widow.    \"And this cold-hearted woman,\" exclaimed Kolina with emotion, \"has  sent you to risk life on the horrible Frozen Sea. A Yakouta girl would  have been less selfish. She would have said, 'Stay at home--let me  have Ivan: the mammoth teeth may lie forever on the Frozen Sea!'\"    \"But the lad will go, and he will be drowned like a dog,\" said  Sakalar, more slowly, after this ebullition of feminine indignation.    \"You must go with him, father,\" continued Kolina, with a compassionate  look at Ivan; \"and as your child cannot remain alone, Kolina will go  too!\"    \"We will start when the horses have had five days' hay,\" said Sakalar  gravely--the animals alluded to being only fed when about to go a  journey--\"and Kolina shall go too, for Ivan will be two years on his  way.\"    Ivan listened in amazement: in the first place, at the sudden decision  and warmth of his attached friends, with whom he had dwelt twelve  years; then at the time required. He felt considerable doubts as to  the widow remaining unmarried such a time; but the explanation of  Sakalar satisfied him that it was impossible to perform the journey  even in two years. The hunter told him that they must first join the  tribes dwelling round Nijnei-Kolimsk (New-Kolimsk), where alone he  could get dogs and sledges for his journey across the Frozen Sea.  This, with the arrangements, would consume the winter. In the summer  nothing could be done. When the winter returned he must start toward  the north pole--a month's journey at least--and if he hit on the  place, must encamp there for the rest of the winter. That summer would  be spent in getting out the ivory, fattening up the dogs, and packing.  The third winter would be occupied by the journey home. On hearing  this, Ivan hesitated; but in describing the journey the spirit of the  old hunter got roused, and before night he was warm in his desire  to see over again the scenes of his youthful perils. Kolina solemnly  declared she must be of the party; and thus these experienced savages,  used to sudden and daring resolves, decided in one night on a journey  which would perhaps have been talked of half a century elsewhere  before it was undertaken.    Kolina slept little that night. In a compartment near her was one who  had since childhood been the ideal of her future. She had loved Ivan  as a playmate--she loved him as a man; and here, he whom she had  longed for all the winter, and he whom she had hoped to see once more  the next summer, had suddenly come, starting on a perilous journey  of years, to win the hand of an avaricious, but young and beautiful  widow. Kolina saw all her fairest dreams vanish, and the idol of her  heart crumble into dust. And yet she felt no ill-will to Ivan, and  never changed her resolve to be the faithful companion and attendant  of her father and his friend in their wild journey to the supposed  islands in the Frozen Sea.      III.--NIJNEI-KOLIMSK.    The five days fixed by Sakalar for preparing for the journey were  wholly devoted to the necessary arrangements. There was much to be  done, and much to be talked of. They had to travel a long way before  they reached even the real starting-point of their adventurous voyage.  Sakalar, duly to impress Ivan with the dangers and perils of the  search, narrated once more in minute detail all his former sufferings.  But nothing daunted the young trader. He was one of those men, who,  under more favorable circumstances, would have been a Cook, a Parry,  or a Franklin, periling everything to make farther discovery in the  science of geography.    The five horses of Ivan were exchanged for others more inured to the  kind of journey they were about to undertake. There was one for each  of the adventurers and four to carry the luggage, consisting chiefly  of articles with which to pay for the hire of dogs and sledges. All  were well armed, while the dress of all was the same--Kolina adopting  for the time the habits and appearance of the man. Over their usual  clothes they put a jacket of foxes' skins and a fur-breast cover; the  legs being covered by hare-skin wrappers. Over these were stockings of  soft reindeer leather, and high strong boots of the same material. The  knees were protected by knee-caps of fur, and then, above all, was a  coat with loose sleeves and hood of double deerskin. This was not all.  After the chin, nose, ears, and mouth had been guarded by appropriate  pieces, forming together a mask, they had received the additional  weight of a pointed fur cap. Our three travelers when they took their  departure looked precisely like three animated bundles of old clothes.    All were well armed with gun, pistol, hatchet, and hunting-knife,  while the girdle further supported a pipe and tobacco-pouch. They had  not explained whither they were going, but the whole village knew that  they must be about to undertake some perilous journey, and accordingly  turned out to cheer them as they went, while several ardent admirers  of Kolina were loud in their murmurs at her accompanying the  expedition. But the wanderers soon left the plain of Mioure behind  them, and entered on the delectable roads leading to the Frozen Sea.  Half-frozen marshes and quagmires met them at every step; but Sakalar  rode first, and the others followed one by one, and the experienced  old hunter, by advancing steadily without hurry, avoided these  dangers. They soon reached a vast plain three hundred miles across,  utterly deserted by the human race; a desert composed half of barren  rock and half of swampy quagmire, soft above, but at a foot deep  solid and perpetual ice. Fortunately, it was now frozen hard, and the  surface was fit to bear the horses. But for this the party must have  halted and waited for a severe frost. The rivers were not frozen  when large in volume, and the Aldana had to be crossed in the usual  flat-bottomed boat kept for travelers. At night they halted, and with  a bush and some deer-skins made a tent. Kolina cooked the supper, and  the men searched for some fields of stunted half-frozen grass to let  the horses graze. This was the"]]]
