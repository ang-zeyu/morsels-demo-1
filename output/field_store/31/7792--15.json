Here, in these  various hollows which have been hewn into it, many things are now to be  buried, as a witness to some far-off world--these metal cases  hermetically sealed contain documents in writing; matters of various  note are engraved on these plates; in these fair glass bottles we bury  the best old wine, with a note of the year of its vintage. We have coins  too of many kinds, from the mint of the current year. All this we have  received through the liberality of him for whom we build. There is space  yet remaining, if guest or spectator desires to offer anything to the  after-world!\"    After a slight pause the speaker looked round; but, as is commonly the  case on such occasions, no one was prepared; they were all taken by  surprise. At last, a merry-looking young officer set the example, and  said, \"If I am to contribute anything which as yet is not to be found in  this treasure-chamber, it shall be a pair of buttons from my uniform--I  don't see why they do not deserve to go down to posterity!\" No sooner  said than done, and then a number of persons found something of the  same sort which they could do; the young ladies did not hesitate to  throw in some of their side hair combs--smelling bottles and other  trinkets were not spared. Only Ottilie hung back; till a kind word from  Edward roused her from the abstraction in which she was watching the  various things being heaped in. Then she unclasped from her neck the  gold chain on which her father's picture had hung, and with a light  gentle hand laid it down on the other jewels. Edward rather disarranged  the proceedings, by at once, in some haste, having the cover let fall,  and fastened down.    The young mason who had been most active through all this, again took  his place as orator, and went on: \"We lay down this stone for ever, for  the establishing the present and the future possessors of this house.  But in that we bury this treasure together with it, we do it in the  remembrance--in this most enduring of works--of the perishableness of  all human things. We remember that a time may come when this cover so  fast sealed shall again be lifted; and that can only be when all shall  again be destroyed which as yet we have not brought into being.    \"But now--now that at once it may begin to be, back with our thoughts  out of the future--back into the present. At once, after the feast,  which we have this day kept together, let us on with our labor; let no  one of all those trades which are to work on our foundation, through us  keep unwilling holiday. Let the building rise swiftly to its height, and  out of the windows, which as yet have no existence, may the master of  the house, with his family and with his guests, look forth with a glad  heart over his broad lands. To him and to all here present herewith be  health and happiness.\"    With these words he drained a richly cut tumbler at a draught, and flung  it into the air, thereby to signify the excess of pleasure by destroying  the vessel which had served for such a solemn occasion. This time,  however, it fell out otherwise. The glass did not fall back to the  earth, and indeed without a miracle.    In order to get forward with the buildings, they had already thrown out  the whole of the soil at the opposite corner; indeed, they had begun to  raise the wall, and for this purpose had reared a scaffold as high as  was absolutely necessary. On the occasion of the festival, boards had  been laid along the top of this, and a number of spectators were allowed  to stand there. It had been meant principally for the advantage of the  workmen themselves. The glass had flown up there, and had been caught by  one of them, who took it as a sign of good luck for himself. He waved it  round without letting it out of his hand, and the letters E and O were  to be seen very richly cut upon it, running one into the other. It was  one of the glasses which had been executed for Edward when he was a boy.    The scaffoldings were again deserted, and the most active among the  party climbed up to look round them, and could not speak enough in  praise of the beauty of the prospect on all sides. How many new  discoveries does not a person make when on some high point he ascends  but a single story higher. Inland many fresh villages came in sight. The  line of the river could be traced like a thread of silver; indeed, one  of the party thought that he distinguished the spires of the capital. On  the other side, behind the wooded hill, the blue peaks of the far-off  mountains were seen rising, and the country immediately about them was  spread out like a map.    \"If the three ponds,\" cried some one, \"were but thrown together to make  a single sheet of water, there would be everything here which is noblest  and most excellent.\"    \"That might easily be effected,\" the Captain said. \"In early times they  must have formed all one lake among the hills here.\"    \"Only I must beseech you to spare my clump of planes and poplars that  stand so prettily by the centre pond,\" said Edward. \"See!\" He turned to  Ottilie, bringing her a few steps forward, and pointing down--\"those  trees I planted myself.\"    \"How long have they been standing there?\" asked Ottilie.    \"Just about as long as you have been in the world,\" replied Edward.  \"Yes, my dear child, I planted them when you were still lying in your  cradle.\"    The party now betook themselves back to the castle. After dinner was  over they were invited to walk through the village to take a glance at  what had been done there as well. At a hint from the Captain, the  inhabitants had collected in front of the houses. They were not standing  in rows, but formed in natural family groups; part were occupied at  their evening work, part out enjoying themselves on the new benches.  They had determined, as an agreeable duty which they imposed upon  themselves, to have everything in its present order and cleanliness, at  least every Sunday and holiday.    A little party, held together by such feelings as had grown up among our  friends, is always unpleasantly interrupted by a large concourse of  people. All four were delighted to find themselves again alone in the  large drawing-room, but this sense of home was a little disturbed by a  letter which was brought to Edward, giving notice of fresh guests who  were to arrive the following day.    \"It is as we supposed,\" Edward cried to Charlotte. \"The Count will not  stay away; he is coming tomorrow.\"    \"Then the Baroness, too, is not far off,\" answered Charlotte.    \"Doubtless not,\" said Edward. \"She is coming, too, tomorrow, from  another place. They only beg to be allowed to stay for a night; the next  day they will go on together.\"    \"We must prepare for them in time, Ottilie,\" said Charlotte.    \"What arrangement shall I desire to be made?\" Ottilie asked.    Charlotte gave a general direction, and Ottilie left the room.    The Captain inquired into the relation in which these two persons stood  toward each other, and with which he was only very generally acquainted.  They had some time before, both being already married, fallen violently  in love with each other; a double marriage was not to be interfered with  without attracting attention. A divorce was proposed. On the Baroness's  side it could be effected, on that of the Count it could not. They were  obliged seemingly to separate, but their position toward each other  remained unchanged, and though in the winter at the Residence they were  unable to be together, they indemnified themselves in the summer, while  making tours and staying at watering-places.    They were both slightly older than Edward and Charlotte, and had been  intimate with them from early times at court. The connection had never  been absolutely broken off, although it was impossible to approve of  their proceedings. On the present occasion their coming was most  unwelcome to Charlotte; and if she had looked closely into her reasons  for feeling it so, she would have found it was on account of Ottilie.  The poor innocent girl should not have been brought so early in contact  with such an example.    \"It would have been more convenient if they had not come till a couple  of days later,\" Edward was saying; as Ottilie re-entered, \"till we had  finished with this business of the farm. The deed of sale is complete.  One copy of it I have here, but we want a second, and our old clerk has  fallen ill.\" The Captain offered his services, and so did Charlotte, but  there was something or other to object to in both of them.    \"Give it to me,\" cried Ottilie, a little hastily.    \"You will never be able to finish it,\" said Charlotte.    \"And really I must have it early the day after tomorrow, and it is  long,\" Edward added.    \"It shall be ready,\" Ottilie cried; and the paper was already in her  hands.    The next morning, as they were looking out from their highest windows  for their visitors, whom they intended to go some way and meet, Edward  said, \"Who is that yonder, riding slowly along the road?\"    The Captain described accurately the figure of the horse-man.    \"Then it is he,\" said Edward; \"the particulars, which you can see better  than I, agree very well with the general figure, which I can see too. It  is Mittler; but what is he doing, coming riding at such a pace as that?\"    The figure came nearer, and Mittler it veritably was. They received him  with warm greetings as he came slowly up the steps.    \"Why did you not come yesterday?\" Edward cried, as he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11367"],[0,"A History of China (#15)"],[1,"ppearance. It is known that these northern  peoples had mastered the technique of horseback warfare and were far  ahead of the Chinese, although the Chinese imitated their methods. The  peasants of China, as they penetrated farther and farther north, had to  be protected by their rulers against the northern peoples, and since the  rulers needed their armed forces for their struggles within China, a  beginning was made with the building of frontier walls, to prevent  sudden raids of the northern peoples against the peasant settlements.  Thus came into existence the early forms of the \"Great Wall of China\".  This provided for the first time a visible frontier between Chinese and  non-Chinese. Along this frontier, just as by the walls of towns, great  markets were held at which Chinese peasants bartered their produce to  non-Chinese nomads. Both partners in this trade became accustomed to it  and drew very substantial profits from it. We even know the names of  several great horse-dealers who bought horses from the nomads and sold  them within China.    3 _Cultural changes_    Together with the economic and social changes in this period, there came  cultural changes. New ideas sprang up in exuberance, as would seem  entirely natural, because in times of change and crisis men always come  forward to offer solutions for pressing problems. We shall refer here  only briefly to the principal philosophers of the period.    Mencius (_c_. 372-289 B.C.) and Hsuen Tz[)u] (_c_. 298-238 B.C.) were  both followers of Confucianism. Both belonged to the so-called  \"scholars\", and both lived in the present Shantung, that is to say, in  eastern China. Both elaborated the ideas of Confucius, but neither of  them achieved personal success. Mencius (Meng Tz[)u]) recognized that  the removal of the ruling house of the Chou no longer presented any  difficulty. The difficult question for him was when a change of ruler  would be justified. And how could it be ascertained whom Heaven had  destined as successor if the existing dynasty was brought down? Mencius  replied that the voice of the \"people\", that is to say of the upper  class and its following, would declare the right man, and that this man  would then be Heaven's nominee. This theory persisted throughout the  history of China. Hsuen Tz[)u]'s chief importance lies in the fact that  he recognized that the \"laws\" of nature are unchanging but that man's  fate is determined not by nature alone but, in addition, by his own  activities. Man's nature is basically bad, but by working on himself  within the framework of society, he can change his nature and can  develop. Thus, Hsuen Tz[)u]'s philosophy contains a dynamic element, fit  for a dynamic period of history.    In the strongest contrast to these thinkers was the school of Mo Ti (at  some time between 479 and 381 B.C.). The Confucian school held fast to  the old feudal order of society, and was only ready to agree to a few  superficial changes. The school of Mo Ti proposed to alter the  fundamental principles of society. Family ethics must no longer be  retained; the principles of family love must be extended to the whole  upper class, which Mo Ti called the \"people\". One must love another  member of the upper class just as much as one's own father. Then the  friction between individuals and between states would cease. Instead of  families, large groups of people friendly to one another must be  created. Further one should live frugally and not expend endless money  on effete rites, as the Confucianists demanded. The expenditure on  weddings and funerals under the Confucianist ritual consumed so much  money that many families fell into debt and, if they were unable to pay  off the debt, sank from the upper into the lower class. In order to  maintain the upper class, therefore, there must be more frugality. Mo  Ti's teaching won great influence. He and his successors surrounded  themselves with a private army of supporters which was rigidly organized  and which could be brought into action at any time as its leader wished.  Thus the Mohists came forward everywhere with an approach entirely  different from that of the isolated Confucians. When the Mohists offered  their assistance to a ruler, they brought with them a group of technical  and military experts who had been trained on the same principles. In  consequence of its great influence this teaching was naturally hotly  opposed by the Confucianists.    We see clearly in Mo Ti's and his followers' ideas the influence of the  changed times. His principle of \"universal love\" reflects the breakdown  of the clans and the general weakening of family bonds which had taken  place. His ideal of social organization resembles organizations of  merchants and craftsmen which we know only of later periods. His stress  upon frugality, too, reflects a line of thought which is typical of  businessmen. The rationality which can also be seen in his metaphysical  ideas and which has induced modern Chinese scholars to call him an early  materialist is fitting to an age in which a developing money economy and  expanding trade required a cool, logical approach to the affairs of this  world.    A similar mentality can be seen in another school which appeared from  the fifth century B.C. on, the \"dialecticians\". Here are a number of  names to mention: the most important are Kung-sun Lung and Hui Tz[)u],  who are comparable with the ancient Greek dialecticians and Sophists.  They saw their main task in the development of logic. Since, as we have  mentioned, many \"scholars\" journeyed from one princely court to another,  and other people came forward, each recommending his own method to the  prince for the increase of his power, it was of great importance to be  able to talk convincingly, so as to defeat a rival in a duel of words on  logical grounds.    Unquestionably, however, the most important school of this period was  that of the so-called Legalists, whose most famous representative was  Shang Yang (or Shang Tz[)u], died 338 B.C.). The supporters of this  school came principally from old princely families that had lost their  feudal possessions, and not from among the so-called scholars. They were  people belonging to the upper class who possessed political experience  and now offered their knowledge to other princes who still reigned.  These men had entirely given up the old conservative traditions of  Confucianism; they were the first to make their peace with the new  social order. They recognized that little or nothing remained of the old  upper class of feudal lords and their following. The last of the feudal  lords collected around the heads of the last remaining princely courts,  or lived quietly on the estates that still remained to them. Such a  class, with its moral and economic strength broken, could no longer  lead. The Legalists recognized, therefore, only the ruler and next to  him, as the really active and responsible man, the chancellor; under  these there were to be only the common people, consisting of the richer  and poorer peasants; the people's duty was to live and work for the  ruler, and to carry out without question whatever orders they received.  They were not to discuss or think, but to obey. The chancellor was to  draft laws which came automatically into operation. The ruler himself  was to have nothing to do with the government or with the application of  the laws. He was only a symbol, a representative of the equally inactive  Heaven. Clearly these theories were much the best suited to the  conditions of the break-up of feudalism about 300 B.C. Thus they were  first adopted by the state in which the old idea of the feudal state had  been least developed, the state of Ch'in, in which alien peoples were  most strongly represented. Shang Yang became the actual organizer of the  state of Ch'in. His ideas were further developed by Han Fei Tz[)u] (died  233 B.C.). The mentality which speaks out of his writings has closest  similarity to the famous Indian Arthashastra which originated slightly  earlier; both books exhibit a \"Machiavellian\" spirit. It must be  observed that these theories had little or nothing to do with the ideas  of the old cult of Heaven or with family allegiance; on the other hand,  the soldierly element, with the notion of obedience, was well suited to  the militarized peoples of the west. The population of Ch'in, organized  throughout on these principles, was then in a position to remove one  opponent after another. In the middle of the third century B.C. the  greater part of the China of that time was already in the hands of  Ch'in, and in 256 B.C. the last emperor of the Chou dynasty was  compelled, in his complete impotence, to abdicate in favour of the ruler  of Ch'in.    Apart from these more or less political speculations, there came into  existence in this period, by no mere chance, a school of thought which  never succeeded in fully developing in China, concerned with natural  science and comparable with the Greek natural philosophy. We have  already several times pointed to parallels between Chinese and Indian  thoughts. Such similarities may be the result of mere coincidence. But  recent findings in Central Asia indicate that direct connections between  India, Persia, and China may have started at a time much earlier than we  had formerly thought. Sogdian merchants who later played a great role in  commercial contacts might have been active already from 350 or 400 B.C.  on and might have been the transmitters of new ideas. The most important  philosopher of this school was Tsou Yen (flourished between 320 and 295  B.C.); he, as so many other Chinese philosophers of this time, was a  native of Shantung, and the ports of the Shantung coast may well have  been ports of entrance of new ideas from Western Asia as were the roads  through the Turkestan basin into Western China. Tsou Yen's basic ideas  had their root in earlier Chinese speculations: the"]]]
