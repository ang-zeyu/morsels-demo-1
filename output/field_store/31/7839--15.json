He was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy  class, when Planchet approached and said:    \"I will lay a wager, your honor, that you and I are thinking of the same  thing.\"    \"I doubt it, Planchet,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"but what are you thinking  of?\"    \"I am thinking, sir, of those desperate looking men who were drinking in  the inn where we rested.\"    \"Always cautious, Planchet.\"    \"'Tis instinct, your honor.\"    \"Well, what does your instinct tell you now?\"    \"Sir, my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for  some bad purpose; and I was reflecting on what my instinct had told me,  in the darkest corner of the stable, when a man wrapped in a cloak and  followed by two other men, came in.\"    \"Ah ah!\" said D'Artagnan, Planchet's recital agreeing with his own  observations. \"Well?\"    \"One of these two men said, 'He must certainly be at Noisy, or be coming  there this evening, for I have seen his servant.'    \"'Art thou sure?' said the man in the cloak.    \"'Yes, my prince.'\"    \"My prince!\" interrupted D'Artagnan.    \"Yes, 'my prince;' but listen. 'If he is here'--this is what the other  man said--'let's see decidedly what to do with him.'    \"'What to do with him?' answered the prince.    \"'Yes, he's not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow; he'll defend  himself.'    \"'Well, we must try to take him alive. Have you cords to bind him with  and a gag to stop his mouth?'    \"'We have.'    \"'Remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman.'    \"'Yes, yes, my lord; don't be uneasy.'    \"'Besides, I shall be there.'    \"'You will assure us that justice----'    \"'Yes, yes! I answer for all that,' the prince said.    \"'Well, then, we'll do our best.' Having said that, they went out of the  stable.\"    \"Well, what matters all that to us?\" said D'Artagnan. \"This is one of  those attempts that happen every day.\"    \"Are you sure that we are not its objects?\"    \"We? Why?\"    \"Just remember what they said. 'I have seen his servant,' said one, and  that applies very well to me.\"    \"Well?\"    \"'He must certainly be at Noisy, or be coming there this evening,' said  the other; and that applies very well to you.\"    \"What else?\"    \"Then the prince said: 'Take notice that in all probability he will be  disguised as a cavalier;' which seems to me to leave no room for doubt,  since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers.  Now then, what do you say to that?\"    \"Alas! my dear Planchet,\" said D'Artagnan, sighing, \"we are  unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to  assassinate me. Those were good old days; never fear--these people owe  us no grudge.\"    \"Is your honor sure?\"    \"I can answer for it they do not.\"    \"Well, we won't speak of it any more, then;\" and Planchet took his place  in D'Artagnan's suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in  his master, which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed.    They had traveled onward about half a mile when Planchet came close up  to D'Artagnan.    \"Stop, sir, look yonder,\" he whispered; \"don't you see in the darkness  something pass by, like shadows? I fancy I hear horses' feet.\"    \"Impossible!\" returned D'Artagnan. \"The ground is soaking wet; yet I  fancy, as thou sayest, that I see something.\"    At this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear, coming through  darkness and space.    \"There are men somewhere about, but that's of no consequence to us,\"  said D'Artagnan; \"let us ride onward.\"    At about half-past eight o'clock they reached the first houses in Noisy;  every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village. The  obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the  roofs of houses. Here and there a dog barked behind a door or an  affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take  refuge behind a pile of faggots, from which retreat her eyes would shine  like peridores. These were the only living creatures that seemed to  inhabit the village.    Toward the middle of the town, commanding the principal open space, rose  a dark mass, separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and  overshadowed in the front by enormous lime-trees. D'Artagnan looked  attentively at the building.    \"This,\" he said to Planchet, \"must be the archbishop's chateau, the  abode of the fair Madame de Longueville; but the convent, where is  that?\"    \"The convent, your honor, is at the other end of the village; I know it  well.\"    \"Well, then, Planchet, gallop up to it whilst I tighten my horse's  girth, and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the  Jesuits' windows.\"    In about five minutes Planchet returned.    \"Sir,\" he said, \"there is one window of the convent lighted up.\"    \"Hem! If I were a 'Frondeur,'\" said D'Artagnan, \"I should knock here and  should be sure of a good supper. If I were a monk I should knock yonder  and should have a good supper there, too; whereas, 'tis very possible  that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds,  dying with hunger and thirst.\"    \"Yes,\" added Planchet, \"like the famous ass of Buridan. Shall I knock?\"    \"Hush!\" replied D'Artagnan; \"the light no longer burns in yonder  window.\"    \"Do you hear nothing?\" whispered Planchet.    \"What is that noise?\"    There came a sound like a whirlwind, at the same time two troops of  horsemen, each composed of ten men, sallied forth from each of the lanes  which encompassed the house and surrounded D'Artagnan and Planchet.    \"Heyday!\" cried D'Artagnan, drawing his sword and taking refuge behind  his horse; \"are you not mistaken? is it really for us that you mean your  attack?\"    \"Here he is! we have him!\" cried the horsemen, rushing on D'Artagnan  with naked swords.    \"Don't let him escape!\" said a loud voice.    \"No, my lord; be assured we shall not.\"    D'Artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation.    \"Halloo, gentlemen!\" he called out in his Gascon accent, \"what do you  want? what do you demand?\"    \"That thou shalt soon know,\" shouted a chorus of horsemen.    \"Stop, stop!\" cried he whom they had addressed as \"my lord;\" \"'tis not  his voice.\"    \"Ah! just so, gentlemen! pray, do people get into a passion at random at  Noisy? Take care, for I warn you that the first man that comes within  the length of my sword--and my sword is long--I rip him up.\"    The chieftain of the party drew near.    \"What are you doing here?\" he asked in a lofty tone, as that of one  accustomed to command.    \"And you--what are you doing here?\" replied D'Artagnan.    \"Be civil, or I shall beat you; for although one may not choose to  proclaim oneself, one insists on respect suitable to one's rank.\"    \"You don't choose to discover yourself, because you are the leader of an  ambuscade,\" returned D'Artagnan; \"but with regard to myself, who am  traveling quietly with my own servant, I have not the same reasons as  you have to conceal my name.\"    \"Enough! enough! what is your name?\"    \"I shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me,  my lord, or my prince, as it may suit you best to be called,\" said our  Gascon, who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat. \"Do you know  Monsieur d'Artagnan?\"    \"Lieutenant in the king's musketeers?\" said the voice; \"you are Monsieur  d'Artagnan?\"    \"I am.\"    \"Then you came here to defend him?\"    \"Him? whom?\"    \"The man we are seeking.\"    \"It seems,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that whilst I thought I was coming to  Noisy I have entered, without suspecting it, into the kingdom of  mysteries.\"    \"Come,\" replied the same lofty tone, \"answer! Are you waiting for him  underneath these windows? Did you come to Noisy to defend him?\"    \"I am waiting for no one,\" replied D'Artagnan, who was beginning to be  angry. \"I propose to defend no one but myself, and I shall defend myself  vigorously, I give you warning.\"    \"Very well,\" said the voice; \"go away from here and leave the place to  us.\"    \"Go away from here!\" said D'Artagnan, whose purposes were in conflict  with that order, \"that is not so easy, since I am on the point of  falling, and my horse, too, through fatigue; unless, indeed, you are  disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood.\"    \"Rascal!\"    \"Eh! monsieur!\" said D'Artagnan, \"I beg you will have a care what you  say; for if you utter another word like that, be you marquis, duke,  prince or king, I will thrust it down your throat! do you hear?\"    \"Well, well,\" rejoined the leader, \"there's no doubt 'tis a Gascon who  is speaking, and therefore not the man we are looking for. Our blow has  failed for to-night; let us withdraw. We shall meet again, Master  d'Artagnan,\" continued the leader, raising his voice.    \"Yes, but never with the same advantages,\" said D'Artagnan, in a tone of  raillery; \"for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and  there will be daylight.\"    \"Very good, very good,\" said the voice. \"En route, gentlemen.\"    And the troop, grumbling angrily, disappeared in the darkness and took  the road to Paris. D'Artagnan and Planchet remained for some moments  still on the defensive; then, as the noise of the horsemen became more  and more distant, they sheathed their swords.    \"Thou seest, simpleton,\" said D'Artagnan to his servant, \"that they  wished no harm to us.\"    \"But to whom, then?\"    \"I'faith! I neither know nor care. What I do care for now, is to make my  way into the Jesuits' convent; so to horse and let us knock at their  door.

Mrs. Venables did not look at him, but she looked the harder at Morna  instead.    \"Well,\" said she, \"I suppose you are right. In your position--yes--your  position is quite different!\" And the sudden, half accidental turn of  her sentence put Mrs. Venables on good terms with herself once more; and  so she rose all smiles and velvet. \"No, not even half a cup; but it was  really quite delicious; and I hope you'll come and see me soon, and tell  me all about her. At his age!\" she whispered as she went. \"At  sixty-five--if he's a day!\"    A stranger would have imagined that this lady had quite decided not to  call upon the newcomer herself; even Mrs. Woodgate was uncertain of her  neighbor's intention as the latter's wheels ground the Vicarage drive  once more, and she and her husband were left alone.    \"It will depend upon the county,\" said she; \"and Mrs. Venables is not  the county pure and simple, she's half Northborough still, and she'll  take her cue from the Invernesses and the Uniackes. But I do believe  she's been round the whole country-side, getting people to say they  won't call; as if it mattered to a man like Mr. Steel, or any woman he  is likely to have chosen. Still, it is mysterious, isn't it? But what  business of ours, as you say? Only, dear, you needn't have said it quite  so pointedly. Of course I'll call as soon as I can in decency; she may  let me be of use to her. Oh, bother Mrs. Venables! If she doesn't call,  no doubt many others won't; you must remember that he has never  entertained as yet. Oh, what a dance they could give! And did you hear  what she said about his age? He is sixty-five, now!\"    The vicar laughed. It was his habit to let his young wife rattle on when  they were alone, and even lay down the law for him to her heart's  content; but, though fifteen years her senior, and never a vivacious  man himself, there was much in their life that he saw in the same light  as she did, though never quite so soon.    \"Sixty-five!\" he suddenly repeated, with a fresh chuckle; \"and last  year, when Sybil was thought to be in the running--poor Sybil, how well  she took it!--last year her mother told me she knew for a fact he was  not a day more than five-and-forty! Poor Steel, too! He has done for  them both in that quarter, I am afraid. And now,\" added Hugh, in his  matter-of-fact way, as though they had been discussing theology all this  time, \"I must go back to my sermon if I am to get it done to-night.\"          CHAPTER X    A SLIGHT DISCREPANCY      Mrs. Woodgate paid the promised call a few days later, walking briskly  by herself along the woodland path that made it no distance from Marley  Vicarage to Normanthorpe House, and cutting a very attractive figure  among the shimmering lights and shadows of the trees. She was rather  tall, and very straight, with the pale brown skin and the dark brown  eye, which, more especially when associated with hair as light as Morna  Woodgate's, go to make up one of the most charming and distinctive types  of English womanhood. Morna, moreover, took a healthy interest in her  own appearance, and had not only the good taste to dress well, but the  good sense not to dress too well. Her new coat and skirt had just come  home, and, fawn-colored like herself, they fitted and suited her to  equal perfection. Morna thought that she might even go to church in the  coat and skirt, now and again during the summer, and she had a brown  straw hat with fine feathers of the lighter shade which she made  peculiarly her own; but this she had discarded as too grand for an  informal call, for Hugh had been summoned to a sick-bed at the last  moment, and might be detained too late to follow. But the Steels had  been back two days, and Morna could not wait another hour.    She was certainly consumed with curiosity; but that was not the only  feeling which Mrs. Woodgate entertained towards the lady who was to be a  nearer neighbor of her own sex and class than any she could count as  yet. On the class question Morna had no misgivings; nevertheless, she  was prepared for a surprise. Both she and her husband had seen a good  deal of Mr. Steel. Morna had perhaps seen the best of him, since she was  at once young and charming, and not even an unwilling and personally  innocent candidate for his hand, like honest Sybil Venables. Yet Morna  herself was not more attracted than repelled by the inscrutable  personality of this rich man dropped from the clouds, who had never a  word to say about his former life, never an anecdote to tell, never an  adventure to record, and of whom even Mrs. Venables had not the courage  to ask questions. What sort of woman would such a man marry, and what  sort of woman would marry such a man? Morna asked herself the one  question after the other, almost as often as she set her right foot in  front of her left; but she was not merely inquisitive in the matter, she  had a secret and instinctive compassion for the woman who had done this  thing.    \"She will not have a soul to call her own, poor thing!\" thought Morna,  as indignantly as though the imaginary evil was one of the worst that  could befall; for the vicar's wife had her little weaknesses, not by any  means regarded as such by herself; and this was one of the last things  that could have been said about her, or that she would have cared to  hear.    The woodland path led at last into the long avenue, and there was  Normanthorpe House at the end of the vista; an Italian palace  transplanted into the north of England, radiantly white between the  green trees and blue sky, with golden cupola burning in the sun; perhaps  the best specimen extant to mark a passing fashion in Georgian  architecture, but as ill-suited to the Delverton district as an  umbrella-tent to the North Pole. A cool grotto on a really hot day, the  house was an ice-pit on any other; or so Mrs. Woodgate fancied, fresh  from the cosey Vicarage, and warm from her rapid walk, as she stepped  into another temperature, across polished marble that struck a chill  through the soles of her natty brown shoes, and so into the lofty  drawing-room with pilasters and elaborate architraves to the doors. What  a place for a sane man to build in bleak old Delverton, even before  there was any Northborough to blacken and foul the north-east wind on  its way from the sea! What a place for a sane man to buy; and yet, in  its cool white smoothness, its glaring individuality, its alien air--how  like the buyer!    Though it was May, and warm enough for the month and place, Morna got up  when the footman had left her, and thrust one brown shoe after the other  as near as she could to the wood fire that glimmered underneath the  great, ornate, marble mantelpiece. Then she sat down again, and wondered  what to say; for Morna was at once above and below the conversational  average of her kind. Soon she was framing a self-conscious apology for  premature intrusion--Mrs. Steel was so long in coming. But at last there  was a rustle in the conservatory, and a slender figure in a big hat  stood for an instant on the threshold.    That was Morna's first impression of the new mistress of Normanthorpe,  and it was never erased from her mind; a slender silhouette in an  enormous hat, the light all behind her, the pilastered doorway for a  frame, a gay background of hothouse flowers, and in the figure itself a  nervous hesitancy which struck an immediate chord of sympathy in Morna.  She also was shy; the touch of imperfect nature was mutually discernible  and discerned; and the two were kin from the meeting of their hands.    Morna began her apology, nevertheless; but Rachel cut it very short. \"My  dear Mrs. Woodgate, I think it is so kind of you!\" she exclaimed, her  low voice full of the frankest gratitude; and Morna was surprised at the  time; it was as though she were the rich man's wife, and Mrs. Steel the  vicar's.    They sat a little, talking of the time of year; and it was some minutes  before Morna really saw her new neighbor's face, what with her great hat  and the position of the chair which Mrs. Steel selected. And for these  few minutes, after that first frank speech, the greater constraint was  on the part of the hostess; then all at once she seemed to throw it off,  rising impulsively, as though the great high room, with the Italian  tiles and the garish gilt furniture, struck the same chill to her as to  Morna before her.    \"Come round the garden,\" said Rachel, quickly. \"I am delighted with the  garden, and I think it's really warmer than the house.\"    Delightful it certainly was, or rather they, for the Normanthorpe  gardens were never spoken of in the singular number by those familiar  with their fame; they had been reconstructed and enlarged by a dead duke  with a fad for botany, and kept up by successors who could not endure  the cold, uncomfortable house. It was said to have been a similar taste  in Mr. Steel which had first attracted him to the place; but as he never  confirmed or contradicted anything that was said of him, and would only  smile when a rumor reached his ears, there was no real foundation for  the report.    The ducal botanist had left behind him the rarest collection of plants  and trees, and a tradition in scientific gardening which had not been  allowed to die; it was neglected Normanthorpe that had loaded the tables  and replenished the greenhouses of seats more favored by"]]]
