Then the jackal called  the villagers to witness that the man had fixed his punishment, and  he proposed that he and his wife should go to the herd of cattle,  and if they could pick out the cow that Kara claimed it would be  sure proof that it was his. So the jackals went and at once picked  out the cow, and the villagers were astonished and cried. \"This is  a just judgment! They have come from a distance and have recognised  the cow at once.\" The man who had stolen it had no answer to give;  then the jackal said: \"You yourself promised to pay double; you gave  a bribe of one hundred rupees to the headman and one hundred rupees  to the villagers and the cow you stole is worth two hundred rupees  that is four hundred rupees, therefore you must pay a fine of eight  hundred rupees;\" and the man was made to produce eight hundred rupees  and the jackal gave all the money to the villagers except ten rupees  which he gave to Kara; and he kept nothing for himself.    Then Kara and the jackals went away with the cow, and after getting  outside the village the jackals again warned Kara not to ask the cow  for anything when anyone was by and took their leave of him and went  home. Kara continued his journey and at evening arrived at a large  mango orchard in which a number of carters were camping for the  night. So Kara stopped under a tree at a little distance from the  carters and tied his cow to the root. Soon a storm came up and the  carters all took shelter underneath their carts and Kara asked his  cow for a tent and he and the cow took shelter in it. It rained hard  all night and in the morning the carters saw the tent and wondered  where it came from, and came to the conclusion that the cow must have  produced it; so they resolved to steal the cow.    Kara did not dare to make the cow swallow the tent in the day time  while the carters were about, so he stayed there all the next day and  at night the cow put away the tent. Then when Kara was asleep some  carters came and took away the cow and put in its place a cow with  a calf, and they hid the magic cow within a wall of packs from their  pack bullocks. In the morning Kara at once saw what had happened and  went to the carters and charged them with the theft; they denied all  knowledge of the matter and told him he might look for his cow if he  liked; so he searched the encampment but could not see it.    Then he called the village headman and chowkidar and they searched  and could not find the cow and they advised Kara to keep the cow and  calf as it must be better than his own barren cow; but he refused and  said that he would complain to the magistrate and he made the headman  promise not to let the carters go until he came back. So he went to  a Mahommedan magistrate and it chanced that he was an honest man who  gave just judgments and took no bribes, and made no distinction between  the rich and the poor; he always listened to both sides carefully,  not like some rascally magistrates who always believe the story  that is first told them and pay no attention to what the other side  say. So when Kara made his complaint this magistrate at once sent for  the carters and the carters swore that they had not stolen the cow:  and offered to forfeit all the property they had with them, if the  cow were found in their possession.    Then the magistrate sent police to search the encampment and the police  pulled down the pile of packs that had been put round the cow, and  found the cow inside and took it to the magistrate. Then the magistrate  ordered the carters to fulfil their promise and put them all in prison  and gave all their property to Kara. So Kara loaded all the merchandise  on the carts and pack bullocks and went home rejoicing. At first the  villagers did not recognise who it was who had come with so much wealth  but Kara made himself known to them and they were very astonished and  helped him to build a grand house. Then Kara went to the Raja from  whom he had borrowed the money for his parents' funerals and paid back  what he owed. The Raja was so pleased with him that he gave him his  daughter in marriage and afterwards Kara claimed his father-in-law's  kingdom and got possession of it and lived prosperously ever after.    And the seven sons of his first master who used to scold him were  excited by his success and thought that if they went to foreign parts  they also could gain great wealth; so they took some money from their  father and went off. But all they did was to squander their capital  and in the end they had to come back penniless to their father.          XXII. Lita and His Animals.    Once upon a time there was a man who had four sons: two of them were  married and two were unmarried and the youngest was named Lita. One  day Lita went to his father and asked for fifty or sixty rupees that  he might go on a trading expedition and he promised that if he lost  the money he would not ask for any share in the paternal property. As  he was very urgent his father at last gave him sixty rupees and he  set out on his travels. After going some way he came to a village in  which all the inhabitants were chasing a cat; he asked them what was  the matter and they told him that the cat was always stealing their  Raja's milk and the Raja had offered a reward of twenty rupees to  anyone who would kill it. Then Lita said to them \"Do not kill the cat;  catch it alive and give it to me and I will pay you twenty rupees for  it; then you can go to the Raja and say that you have killed it and ask  for the reward; and if the Raja asks to see the body tell him that a  stranger came and asked for the body, for he thought that a cat which  had fed on milk should be good eating and so you gave it to him.\" The  villagers thought that this would be an excellent plan and promised to  bring him the cat alive. They soon managed to catch it hiding under  a heap of firewood and brought it to Lita and he paid them twenty  rupees and then they went to the Raja and got twenty rupees from him.    Then Lita went on, and by-and-bye came to a village where the villagers  were hunting an otter in a tank; they had made a cut in the bank and  had let out all the water. Lita went to them and asked what they were  doing; they said that they were hunting for an otter which had been  destroying the Raja's fish and the Raja had promised them a reward if  they killed it, and they had driven it into the tank and were draining  off the water in order to catch it. Then Lita offered to buy it of them  if they brought it to him alive; so when they caught it they brought  it to him and he gave them money for it and continued his journey  with the cat and the otter. Presently he saw a crowd of men and he  went up to them and asked what they were doing: and they told him that  they were hunting a rat which was always gnawing the Raja's pens and  papers and the Raja had offered a reward for it, and they had driven  it out of the palace, but it had taken refuge in a hole and they were  going to dig it out Then Lita offered to buy it from them as he had  bought the other two animals and they dug it out and sold it to him.    He went on and in the same way found a crowd of men hunting a snake  which had bitten many people: and he offered to buy it for twenty  rupees and when they had chased it till it was exhausted, they  caught it alive and sold it to Lita. As his money was all spent,  he then set off homewards; and on the way the snake began to speak  and said: \"Lita, you have saved my life; had you not come by, those  men would certainly have had my life; come with me to my home, where  my father and mother are, and I will give you anything you ask for;  we have great possessions.\" But Lita was afraid and said: \"When you  get me there you will eat me, or if you don't, your father and mother  will.\" But the snake protested that it could not be guilty of such  ingratitude and at last Lita agreed to accompany it when he had left  the other animals at his home.    This he did and set off alone with the snake, and after some days they  reached the snake's home. The snake told Lita to wait outside while he  went and apprized his parents and he told Lita that when he was asked  to choose his reward he should name nothing but the ring which was on  the father-snake's finger, for the ring had this property that if it  were placed in a _seer_ of milk and then asked to produce anything  whatever, that thing would immediately appear. Then the snake went  on to his home and when the father and mother saw him they fell on  his neck and kissed him and wept over him saying that they had never  expected to see him again; the snake told them how he had gone to  the country of men and how a reward had been set on his head and he  had been hunted, and how Lita had bought him from the men who would  have killed him. The father snake asked why he had not brought Lita  to be rewarded and the snake said that he was afraid that when they  saw him they would eat him.    But the father and mother swore that they could not be guilty of  such ingratitude, and when he heard this the snake went and brought  in Lita, and they entertained him handsomely for two days; and on  the third day the father snake asked Lita what he would take as his  reward. Lita looked round at the shining palace in which they lived  and at first was afraid to speak but at last he said: \"I do not want  money or anything but the ring on your finger: if you will not give  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#15)"],[1," by taking  part in the uprising.  Caesar, for all his care, could neither prevent  nor stifle this defection, which threatened to become contagious, and  detach from Rome the neighboring peoplets that were still faithful.  Caesar, engaged upon the siege of Gergovia, encountered an obstinate  resistance; whilst Vercingetorix, encamped on the heights which  surrounded his birthplace, everywhere embarrassed, sometimes attacked,  and incessantly threatened the Romans.  The eighth legion, drawn on one  day to make an imprudent assault, was repulsed, and lost forty-six of its  bravest centurions.  Caesar determined to raise the siege, and to  transfer the struggle to places where the population could be more safely  depended upon.  It was the first decisive check he had experienced in  Gaul, the first Gallic town he had been unable to take, the first  retrograde movement he had executed in the face of the Gallic insurgents  and their chieftain.  Vercingetorix could not and would not restrain his  joy; it seemed to him that the day had dawned and an excellent chance  arrived for attempting a decisive blow.  He had under his orders, it is  said, eighty thousand men, mostly his own Arvernians, and a numerous  cavalry furnished by the different peoplets his allies.  He followed all  Caesar's movements in retreat towards the Saone, and, on arriving at  Longeau not far from Langres, near a little river called the Vingeanne,  he halted, pitched his camp about nine miles from the Romans, and  assembling the chiefs of his cavalry, said, \"Now is the hour of victory;  the Romans are flying to their province and leaving Gaul; that is enough  for our liberty to-day, but too little for the peace and repose of the  future; for they will return with greater armies, and the war will be  without end.  Attack we them amid the difficulties of their march; if  their foot support the cavalry, they will not be able to pursue their  route; if, as I fully trust, they leave their baggage, to provide for  their safety, they will lose both their honor and the supplies whereof  they have need.  None of the enemy's horse will dare to come forth from  their lines.  To give ye courage and aid, I will order forth from the  camp and place in battle array all our troops, and they will strike the  enemy with terror.\"  The Gallic horsemen cried out that they must all  bind themselves by the most sacred of oaths, and swear that none of them  would come again under roof, or see again wife, or children, or parent,  unless he had twice pierced through the ranks of the enemy.  And all did  take this oath, and so prepared for the attack.  Vercingetorix knew not  that Caesar, with his usual foresight, had summoned and joined to his  legions a great number of horsemen from the German tribes roving over the  banks of the Rhine, with which he had taken care to keep up friendly  relations.  Not only had he promised them pay, plunder, and lands, but,  finding their horses ill-trained, he had taken those of his officers,  even those of the Roman knights and veterans, and distributed them  amongst his barbaric auxiliaries.  The action began between the cavalry  on both sides; a portion of the Gallic had taken up position on the road  followed by the Roman army, to bar its passage; but whilst the fighting  at this point was getting more and more obstinate, the German horse in  Caesar's service gained a neighboring height, drove off the Gallic horse  that were in occupation, and pursued them as far as the river, near which  was Vercingetorix with his infantry.  Disorder took place amongst this  infantry so unexpectedly attacked.  Caesar launched his legions at them,  and there was a general panic and rout among the Gauls.  Vercingetorix  had great trouble in rallying them, and he rallied them only to order a  general retreat, for which they clamored.  Hurriedly striking his camp,  he made for Alesia (Semur in Auxois), a neighboring town and the capital  of the Mandubians, a peoplet in clientship to the AEduans.  Caesar  immediately went in pursuit of the Gauls; killed, he says, three  thousand, made important prisoners, and encamped with his legions before  Alesia the day but one after Vercingetorix, with his fugitive army, had  occupied the place as well as the neighboring hills, and was hard at work  intrenching himself, probably without any clear idea as yet of what he  should do to continue the struggle.    Caesar at once took a resolution as unexpected as it was discreetly bold.  Here was the whole Gallic insurrection, chieftain and soldiery, united  together within or beneath the walls of a town of moderate extent.  He  undertook to keep it there and destroy it on the spot, instead of having  to pursue it everywhere without ever being sure of getting at it.  He had  at his disposal eleven legions, about fifty thousand strong, and five or  six thousand cavalry, of which two thousand were Germans.  He placed them  round about Alesia and the Gallic camp, caused to be dug a circuit of  deep ditches, some filled with water, others bristling with palisades and  snares, and added, from interval to interval, twenty-three little forts,  occupied or guarded night and day by detachments.  The result was a line  of investment about ten miles in extent.  To the rear of the Roman camp,  and for defence against attacks from without, Caesar caused to be dug  similar intrenchments, which formed a line of circumvallation of about  thirteen miles.  The troops had provisions and forage for thirty days.  Vercingetorix made frequent sallies to stop or destroy these works; but  they were repulsed, and only resulted in getting his army more closely  cooped up within the place.  Eighty thousand Gallic insurgents were, as  it were, in prison, guarded by fifty thousand Roman soldiers.  Vercingetorix was one of those who persevere and act in the days of  distress just as in the spring-tide of their hopes.  Before the works of  the Romans were finished, he assembled his horsemen, and ordered them to  sally briskly from Alesia, return each to his own land, and summon the  whole population to arms.  He was obeyed; the Gallic horsemen made their  way, during the night, through the intervals left by the Romans' still  imperfect lines of investment, and dispersed themselves amongst their  various peoplets.  Nearly everywhere irritation and zeal were at their  height.  An assemblage of delegates met at Bibracte (Autun), and fixed  the amount of the contingent to be furnished by each nation, and a point  was assigned at which all those contingents should unite for the purpose  of marching together towards Alesia, and attacking the besiegers.  The  total of the contingents thus levied on forty-three Gallic peoplets  amounted, according to Caesar, to two hundred and eighty-three thousand  men; and two hundred and forty thousand men, it is said, did actually  hurry up to the appointed place.  Mistrust of such enormous numbers has  already been expressed by one who has lived through the greatest European  wars, and has heard the ablest generals reduce to their real strength the  largest armies.  We find in M. Thiers' _History of the Consulate_ and  Empire, that at Austerlitz, on the 2d of December, 1805, Napoleon had but  from sixty-five to seventy thousand men, and the combined Austrians and  Russians but ninety thousand.  At Leipzig, the biggest of modern battles,  when all the French forces on the one side, and the Austrian, Prussian,  Russian, and Swedish on the other, were face to face on the 18th of  October, 1813, they made all together about five hundred thousand men.  How can we believe, then, that nineteen centuries ago, Gaul, so weakly  populated and so slightly organized, suddenly sent two hundred and forty  thousand men to the assistance of eighty thousand Gauls besieged in the  little town of Alesia by fifty or sixty thousand Romans?  But whatever  may be the case with the figures, it is certain that at the very first  moment the national impulse answered the appeal of Vercingetorix, and  that the besiegers of Alesia, Caesar and his legions, found that they  were themselves all at once besieged in their intrenchments by a cloud of  Gauls hurrying up to the defence of their compatriots.  The struggle was  fierce, but short.  Every time that the fresh Gallic army attacked the  besiegers, Vercingetorix and the Gauls of Alesia sallied forth, and  joined in the attack.  Caesar and his legions, on their side, at one time  repulsed these double attacks, at another themselves took the initiative,  and assailed at one and the same time the besieged and the auxiliaries  Gaul had sent them.  The feeling was passionate on both sides: Roman  pride was pitted against Gallic patriotism.  But in four or five days the  strong organization, the disciplined valor of the Roman legions, and the  genius of Caesar carried the day.  The Gallic re-enforcements, beaten and  slaughtered without mercy, dispersed; and Vercingetorix and the besieged  were crowded back within their walls without hope of escape.  We have two  accounts of the last moments of this great Gallic insurrection and its  chief; one, written by Caesar himself, plain, cold, and harsh as its  author; the other, by two later historians, who were neither statesmen  nor warriors, Plutarch and Dion Cassius, has more detail and more  ornament, following either popular tradition or the imagination of the  writers.  It may be well to give both.  \"The day after the defeat,\" says  Caesar, \"Vercingetorix convokes the assembly, and shows that he did not  undertake the war for his own personal advantage, but for the general  freedom.  Since submission must be made to fortune, he offers to satisfy  the Romans either by instant death or by being delivered to them alive.  A deputation there anent is sent to Caesar, who orders the arms to be  given up and the chiefs brought to him.  He seats himself on his  tribunal, in the front of his camp.  The chiefs are"]]]
