Then without further ado Siegfried departs on his expedition,  taking Gunther with him to the foot of the mountain, and leaving Hagen  to guard the hall and sing a very fine solo which has often figured in  the programs of the Richter concerts, explaining that his interest in  the affair is that Siegfried will bring back the Ring, and that he,  Hagen, will presently contrive to possess himself of that Ring and  become Plutonic master of the world.    And now it will be asked how does Hagen know all about the Plutonic  empire; and why was he able to tell Gunther about Brynhild and  Siegfried, and to explain to Siegfried the trick of the Tarnhelm. The  explanation is that though Hagen's mother was the mother of Gunther, his  father was not the illustrious Gibich, but no less a person than our old  friend Alberic, who, like Wotan, has begotten a son to do for him what  he cannot do for himself.    In the above incidents, those gentle moralizers who find the serious  philosophy of the music dramas too terrifying for them, may allegorize  pleasingly on the philtre as the maddening chalice of passion which,  once tasted, causes the respectable man to forget his lawfully wedded  wife and plunge into adventures which eventually lead him headlong to  destruction.    We now come upon a last relic of the tragedy of Wotan. Returning  to Brynhild's mountain, we find her visited by her sister Valkyrie  Valtrauta, who has witnessed Wotan's solemn preparations with terror.  She repeats to Brynhild the account already given by the Norns. Clinging  in anguish to Wotan's knees, she has heard him mutter that were the ring  returned to the daughters of the deep Rhine, both Gods and world would  be redeemed from that stage curse off Alberic's in The Rhine Gold. On  this she has rushed on her warhorse through the air to beg Brynhild to  give the Rhine back its ring. But this is asking Woman to give up love  for the sake of Church and State. She declares that she will see them  both perish first; and Valtrauta returns to Valhalla in despair. Whilst  Brynhild is watching the course of the black thundercloud that marks her  sister's flight, the fires of Loki again flame high round the mountain;  and the horn of Siegfried is heard as he makes his way through them.  But the man who now appears wears the Tarnhelm: his voice is a strange  voice: his figure is the unknown one of the king of the Gibichungs. He  tears the ring from her finger, and, claiming her as his wife, drives  her into the cave without pity for her agony of horror, and sets Nothung  between them in token of his loyalty to the friend he is impersonating.  No explanation of this highway robbery of the ring is offered. Clearly,  this Siegfried is not the Siegfried of the previous drama.    The Second Act    In the second act we return to the hall of Gibich, where Hagen, in the  last hours of that night, still sits, his spear in his hand, and his  shield beside him. At his knees crouches a dwarfish spectre, his father  Alberic, still full of his old grievances against Wotan, and urging his  son in his dreams to win back the ring for him. This Hagen swears to  do; and as the apparition of his father vanishes, the sun rises and  Siegfried suddenly comes from the river bank tucking into his belt the  Tarnhelm, which has transported him from the mountain like the enchanted  carpet of the Arabian tales. He describes his adventures to Gutrune  until Gunther's boat is seen approaching, when Hagen seizes a cowhorn  and calls the tribesmen to welcome their chief and his bride. It is most  exhilarating, this colloquy with the startled and hastily armed clan,  ending with a thundering chorus, the drums marking the time with mighty  pulses from dominant to tonic, much as Rossini would have made them do  if he had been a pupil of Beethoven's.    A terrible scene follows. Gunther leads his captive bride straight into  the presence of Siegfried, whom she claims as her husband by the ring,  which she is astonished to see on his finger: Gunther, as she supposes,  having torn it from her the night before. Turning on Gunther, she says  \"Since you took that ring from me, and married me with it, tell him of  your right to it; and make him give it back to you.\" Gunther stammers,  \"The ring! I gave him no ring--er--do you know him?\" The rejoinder is  obvious. \"Then where are you hiding the ring that you had from me?\"  Gunther's confusion enlightens her; and she calls Siegfried trickster  and thief to his face. In vain he declares that he got the ring from no  woman, but from a dragon whom he slew; for he is manifestly puzzled;  and she, seizing her opportunity, accuses him before the clan of having  played Gunther false with her.    Hereupon we have another grandiose operatic oath, Siegfried attesting  his innocence on Hagen's spear, and Brynhild rushing to the footlights  and thrusting him aside to attest his guilt, whilst the clansmen call  upon their gods to send down lightnings and silence the perjured. The  gods do not respond; and Siegfried, after whispering to Gunther that the  Tarnhelm seems to have been only half effectual after all, laughs his  way out of the general embarrassment and goes off merrily to prepare for  his wedding, with his arm round Gutrune's waist, followed by the  clan. Gunther, Hagen and Brynhild are left together to plot operatic  vengeance. Brynhild, it appears, has enchanted Siegfried in such a  fashion that no weapon can hurt him. She has, however, omitted to  protect his back, since it is impossible that he should ever turn that  to a foe. They agree accordingly that on the morrow a great hunt shall  take place, at which Hagen shall thrust his spear into the hero's  vulnerable back. The blame is to be laid on the tusk of a wild boar.  Gunther, being a fool, is remorseful about his oath of blood-brotherhood  and about his sister's bereavement, without having the strength of mind  to prevent the murder. The three burst into a herculean trio, similar  in conception to that of the three conspirators in Un Ballo in Maschera;  and the act concludes with a joyous strain heralding the appearance of  Siegfried's wedding procession, with strewing of flowers, sacrificing to  the gods, and carrying bride and bridegroom in triumph.    It will be seen that in this act we have lost all connection with the  earlier drama. Brynhild is not only not the Brynhild of The Valkyries,  she is the Hiordis of Ibsen, a majestically savage woman, in whom  jealousy and revenge are intensified to heroic proportions. That is the  inevitable theatrical treatment of the murderous heroine of the Saga.  Ibsen's aim in The Vikings was purely theatrical, and not, as in his  later dramas, also philosophically symbolic. Wagner's aim in Siegfried's  Death was equally theatrical, and not, as it afterwards became in the  dramas of which Siegfried's antagonist Wotan is the hero, likewise  philosophically symbolic. The two master-dramatists therefore produce  practically the same version of Brynhild. Thus on the second evening of  The Ring we see Brynhild in the character of the truth-divining instinct  in religion, cast into an enchanted slumber and surrounded by the fires  of hell lest she should overthrow a Church corrupted by its alliance  with government. On the fourth evening, we find her swearing a malicious  lie to gratify her personal jealousy, and then plotting a treacherous  murder with a fool and a scoundrel. In the original draft of Siegfried's  Death, the incongruity is carried still further by the conclusion, at  which the dead Brynhild, restored to her godhead by Wotan, and again a  Valkyrie, carries the slain Siegfried to Valhalla to live there happily  ever after with its pious heroes.    As to Siegfried himself, he talks of women, both in this second act and  the next, with the air of a man of the world. \"Their tantrums,\" he  says, \"are soon over.\" Such speeches do not belong to the novice of the  preceding drama, but to the original Siegfried's Tod, with its leading  characters sketched on the ordinary romantic lines from the old Sagas,  and not yet reminted as the original creations of Wagner's genius whose  acquaintance we have made on the two previous evenings. The very  title \"Siegfried's Death\" survives as a strong theatrical point in the  following passage. Gunther, in his rage and despair, cries, \"Save me,  Hagen: save my honor and thy mother's who bore us both.\" \"Nothing can  save thee,\" replies Hagen: \"neither brain nor hand, but SIEGFRIED'S  DEATH.\" And Gunther echoes with a shudder, \"SIEGFRIED'S DEATH!\"          A WAGNERIAN NEWSPAPER CONTROVERSY    The devotion which Wagner's work inspires has been illustrated lately  in a public correspondence on this very point. A writer in The Daily  Telegraph having commented on the falsehood uttered by Brynhild in  accusing Siegfried of having betrayed Gunther with her, a correspondence  in defence of the beloved heroine was opened in The Daily Chronicle. The  imputation of falsehood to Brynhild was strongly resented and combated,  in spite of the unanswerable evidence of the text. It was contended that  Brynhild's statement must be taken as establishing the fact that she  actually was ravished by somebody whom she believed to be Siegfried,  and that since this somebody cannot have been Siegfried, he being as  incapable of treachery to Gunther as she of falsehood, it must have been  Gunther himself after a second exchange of personalities not mentioned  in the text. The reply to this--if so obviously desperate a hypothesis  needs a reply--is that the text is perfectly explicit as to Siegfried,  disguised as Gunther, passing the night with Brynhild with Nothung  dividing them, and in the morning bringing her down the mountain THROUGH  THE FIRE (an impassable obstacle to Gunther) and there transporting  himself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14874"],[0,"Elsie's Womanhood (#15)"],[1,"for hours, and was growing very weary. \"Curse the  wretch!\" he muttered, \"does he court all night? How many hours have I been  here waiting for my chance for a shot at him? It's getting to be no joke,  hungry, cold, tired enough to lie down here on the ground. But I'll stick  it out, and shoot him down like a dog. He thinks to enjoy the prize he  snatched from me, but he'll find himself mistaken, or my name's n----\" The  sentence ended with a fierce grinding of the teeth. Hark! was that the  distant tread of a horse? He bent his ear to the earth, and almost held  his breath to listen. Yes, faint but unmistakable; the sounds filled him  with a fiendish joy. For years he had nursed his hatred of Travilla, whom  he blamed almost exclusively for his failure to get possession of Elsie's  fortune.    He sprang up and again placed himself in position to fire. But what had  become of the welcome sounds? Alas for his hoped-for revenge; they had  died away entirely. The horse and his rider must have taken some other  road. More low-breathed, bitter curses: yet perchance it was not the man  for whose life he thirsted. He would wait and hope on.    But the night waned: one after another the moon and stars set and day  began to break in the east; the birds waking in their nests overhead grew  clamorous with joy, yet their notes seemed to contain a warning tone for  him, bidding him begone ere the coming of the light hated by those whose  deeds are evil. Chilled by the frosty air, and stiff and sore from long  standing in a constrained position, he limped away, and disappeared in the  deeper shadows of the woods.    Arthur's words of warning had taken their desired effect; and cowardly, as  base, wicked, and cruel, the man made haste to flee from the scene of his  intended crime, imagining at times that he even heard the bloodhounds  already on his track.          CHAPTER TENTH.        \"At last I know thee--and my soul,        From all thy arts set free,       Abjures the cold consummate art        Shrin'd as a soul in thee.\"                      --SARA J. CLARK.      The rest of the winter passed quietly and happily with our friends at Ion  and the Oaks, Mr. Travilla spending nearly half his time at the latter  place, and in rides and walks with Elsie, whom he now and then coaxed to  Ion for a call upon his mother.    Their courtship was serene and peaceful: disturbed by no feverish heat of  passion, no doubts and fears, no lovers' quarrels, but full of a deep,  intense happiness, the fruit of their long and intimate friendship, their  full acquaintance with, and perfect confidence in each other, and their  strong love. Enna sneeringly observed that \"they were more like some staid  old married couple than a pair of lovers.\"    Arthur made no confidant in regard to his late interview with Jackson;  nothing more was heard or seen of the scoundrel, and gradually Elsie came  to the conclusion that Mr. Travilla, who occasionally rallied her  good-naturedly on the subject of her fright, had been correct in his  judgment that it was either the work of imagination or of some practical  joker.    Arthur, on his part, thought that fear of the terrors he had held up  before him would cause Jackson--whom he knew to be an arrant coward--to  refrain from adventuring himself again in the neighborhood.    But he miscalculated the depth of the man's animosity towards Mr.  Travilla, which so exceeded his cowardice as at length to induce him to  return and make another effort to destroy either the life of that  gentleman or his hopes of happiness; perhaps both.    Elsie was very fond of the society of her dear ones, yet occasionally  found much enjoyment in being alone, for a short season, with Nature or a  book. A very happy little woman, as she had every reason to be, and full  of gratitude and love to the Giver of all good for His unnumbered  blessings, she loved now and then to have a quiet hour in which to count  them over, as a miser does his gold, to return her heartfelt thanks, tell  her best, her dearest Friend of all, how happy she was, and seek help from  Him to make a right use of each talent committed to her care.    Seated in her favorite arbor one lovely spring day, with thoughts thus  employed, and eyes gazing dreamily upon the beautiful landscape spread out  at her feet, she was startled from her reverie by some one suddenly  stepping in and boldly taking a seat by her side.    She turned her head. Could it be possible? Yes, it was indeed Tom Jackson,  handsomely dressed and looking, to a casual observer, the gentleman she  had once believed him to be. She recognized him instantly.    A burning blush suffused her face, dyeing even the fair neck and arms. She  spoke not a word, but rose up hastily with the intent to fly from his  hateful presence.    \"Now don't, my darling, don't run away from me,\" he said, intercepting  her. \"I'm sure you couldn't have the heart, if you knew how I have lived  for years upon the hope of such a meeting: for my love for you, dearest  Elsie, has never lessened, the ardor of my passion has never cooled----\"    \"Enough, sir,\" she said, drawing herself up, her eyes kindling and  flashing as he had never thought they could; \"how dare you insult me by  such words, and by your presence here? Let me pass.\"    \"Insult you, Miss Dinsmore?\" he cried, in affected surprise. \"You were not  wont, in past days, to consider my presence an insult, and I could never  have believed fickleness a part of your nature. You are now of age, and  have a right to listen to my defense, and my suit for your heart and  hand.\"    \"Are you mad? Can you still suppose me ignorant of your true character and  your history for years past? Know then that I am fully acquainted with  them; that I know you to be a lover of vice and the society of the  vicious--a drunkard, profane, a gambler, and one who has stained his hands  with the blood of a fellow-creature,\" she added with a shudder. \"I pray  God you may repent and be forgiven; but you are not and can never be  anything to me.\"    \"So with all your piety you forsake your friends when they get into  trouble,\" he remarked with a bitter sneer.    \"Friend of mine you never were,\" she answered quietly; \"I know it was my  fortune and not myself you really wanted. But though it were true that  you loved me as madly and disinterestedly as you professed, had I known  your character, never, _never_ should I have held speech with you, much  less admitted you to terms of familiarity--a fact which I look back upon  with the deepest mortification. Let me pass, sir, and never venture to  approach me again.\"    \"No you don't, my haughty miss! I'm not done with you yet,\" he exclaimed  between his clenched teeth, and seizing her rudely by the arm as she tried  to step past him. \"So you're engaged to that fatherly friend of yours,  that pious sneak, that deadly foe to me?\"    \"Unhand me, sir!\"    \"Not yet,\" he answered, tightening his grasp, and at the same time taking  a pistol from his pocket. \"I swear you shall never marry that man: promise  me on your oath that you'll not, or--I'll shoot you through the heart; the  heart that's turned false to me. D'ye hear,\" and he held the muzzle of his  piece within a foot of her breast.    Every trace of color fled from her face, but she stood like a marble  statue, without speech or motion of a muscle, her eyes looking straight  into his with firm defiance.    \"Do you hear?\" he repeated, in a tone of exasperation, \"speak! promise  that you'll never marry Travilla, or I'll shoot you in three  minutes--shoot you down dead on the spot, if I swing for it before night.\"    \"That will be as God pleases,\" she answered low and reverently; \"you can  have no power at all against me except it be given you from above.\"    \"I can't, hey? looks like it; I've only to touch the trigger here, and  your soul's out o' your body. Better promise than die.\"    Still she stood looking him unflinchingly in the eye; not a muscle moving,  no sign of fear except that deadly pallor.    \"Well,\" lowering his piece, \"you're a brave girl, and I haven't the heart  to do it,\" he exclaimed in admiration. \"I'll give up that promise; on  condition that you make another--that you'll keep all this a secret for  twenty-four hours, so I can make my escape from the neighborhood before  they get after me with their bloodhounds.\"    \"That I promise, if you will be gone at once.\"    \"You'll not say a word to any one of having seen me, or suspecting I'm  about here?\"    \"Not a word until the twenty-four hours are over.\"    \"Then good-bye. Your pluck has saved your life; but remember, I've not  said I won't shoot him or your father, if chance throws them in my way,\"  he added, looking back over his shoulder with a malicious leer, as he left  the arbor, then disappearing from sight among the trees and shrubbery  beyond.    Elsie's knees shook and trembled under her; she sank back into her seat,  covering her face and bowing her head upon her lap, while she sent up  silent, almost agonizing petitions for the safety of those two so  inexpressibly dear to her. Some moments passed thus, then she rose and  hastened, with a quick nervous step, to the house. She entered her  boudoir, and lay down upon a couch trembling in every fibre, every nerve  quivering with excitement. The shock had been terrible.    \"What de matter wid my chile? what ails you, honey?\" asked Aunt Chloe,  coming to her side full of concern.    \"I think one of my bad headaches is coming on, mammy. But oh, tell me, is  Mr. Travilla here?--and papa! where is he?\"    \"Here daughter,\" his voice answered, close at hand, \"and with a note for  you from Mr. Travilla, who has not shown himself to-day.\"    She took it eagerly, but with a hand that trembled as if with sudden  palsy, while the eyes, usually so keen-sighted, saw only a blurred and  confused jumble of letters in place of the clear, legible characters  really there.    \"I cannot see,\""]]]
