So Sir Gawain rode forth at a swift pace, and with him Gaheris, his  brother, for a squire. And as they went, they saw two knights fighting on  horseback, and when they reached them they divided them and asked the  reason of their quarrel. \"We fight for a foolish matter,\" one replied,  \"for we be brethren; but there came by a white hart this way, chased by  many hounds, and thinking it was an adventure for the high feast of King  Arthur, I would have followed it to have gained worship; whereat my  younger brother here declared he was the better knight and would go after  it instead, and so we fight to prove which of us be the better knight.\"    \"This is a foolish thing,\" said Sir Gawain. \"Fight with all strangers, if  ye will, but not brother with brother. Take my advice, set on against me,  and if ye yield to me, as I shall do my best to make ye, ye shall go to  King Arthur and yield ye to his grace.\"    \"Sir knight,\" replied the brothers, \"we are weary, and will do thy wish  without encountering thee; but by whom shall we tell the king that we were  sent?\"    \"By the knight that followeth the quest of the white hart,\" said Sir  Gawain. \"And now tell me your names, and let us part.\"    \"Sorlous and Brian of the Forest,\" they replied; and so they went their  way to the king's court.    Then Sir Gawain, still following his quest by the distant baying of the  hounds, came to a great river, and saw the hart swimming over and near to  the further bank. And as he was about to plunge in and swim after, he saw  a knight upon the other side, who cried, \"Come not over here, Sir knight,  after that hart, save thou wilt joust with me.\"    \"I will not fail for that,\" said Sir Gawain; and swam his horse across the  stream.    Anon they got their spears, and ran against each other fiercely; and Sir  Gawain smote the stranger off his horse, and turning, bade him yield.    \"Nay,\" replied he, \"not so; for though ye have the better of me on  horseback, I pray thee, valiant knight, alight, and let us match together  with our swords on foot.\"    \"What is thy name?\" quoth Gawain.    \"Allardin of the Isles,\" replied the stranger.    Then they fell on each other; but soon Sir Gawain struck him through the  helm, so deeply and so hard, that all his brains were scattered, and Sir  Allardin fell dead. \"Ah,\" said Gaheris, \"that was a mighty stroke for a  young knight!\"    Then did they turn again to follow the white hart, and let slip three  couple of greyhounds after him; and at the last they chased him to a  castle, and there they overtook and slew him, in the chief courtyard.    At that there rushed a knight forth from a chamber, with a drawn sword in  his hand, and slew two of the hounds before their eyes, and chased the  others from the castle, crying, \"Oh, my white hart! alas, that thou art  dead! for thee my sovereign lady gave to me, and evil have I kept thee;  but if I live, thy death shall be dear bought.\" Anon he went within and  armed, and came out fiercely, and met Sir Gawain face to face.    \"Why have ye slain my hounds?\" said Sir Gawain; \"they did but after their  nature: and ye had better have taken vengeance on me than on the poor dumb  beasts.\"    \"I will avenge me on thee, also,\" said the other, \"ere thou depart this  place.\"    Then did they fight with each other savagely and madly, till the blood ran  down to their feet. But at last Sir Gawain had the better, and felled the  knight of the castle to the ground. Then he cried out for mercy, and  yielded to Sir Gawain, and besought him as he was a knight and gentleman  to save his life. \"Thou shalt die,\" said Sir Gawain, \"for slaying my  hounds.\"    \"I will make thee all amends within my power,\" replied the knight.    But Sir Gawain would have no mercy, and unlaced his helm to strike his  head off; and so blind was he with rage, that he saw not where a lady ran  out from her chamber and fell down upon his enemy. And making a fierce  blow at him, he smote off by mischance the lady's head.    \"Alas!\" cried Gaheris, \"foully and shamefully have ye done--the shame  shall never leave ye! Why give ye not your mercy unto them that ask it? a  knight without mercy is without worship also.\"    Then Sir Gawain was sore amazed at that fair lady's death, and knew not  what to do, and said to the fallen knight, \"Arise, for I will give thee  mercy.\"    \"Nay, nay,\" said he, \"I care not for thy mercy now, for thou hast slain my  lady and my love--that of all earthly things I loved the best.\"    \"I repent me sorely of it,\" said Sir Gawain, \"for I meant to have struck  thee: but now shalt thou go to King Arthur and tell him this adventure,  and how thou hast been overcome by the knight that followeth the quest of  the white hart.\"    \"I care not whether I live or die, or where I go,\" replied the knight.    So Sir Gawain sent him to the court to Camelot, making him bear one dead  greyhound before and one behind him on his horse. \"Tell me thy name before  we part,\" said he.    \"My name is Athmore of the Marsh,\" he answered.    Then went Sir Gawain into the castle, and prepared to sleep there and  began to unarm; but Gaheris upbraided him, saying, \"Will ye disarm in this  strange country? bethink ye, ye must needs have many enemies about.\"    No sooner had he spoken than there came out suddenly four knights, well  armed, and assailed them hard, saying to Sir Gawain, \"Thou new-made  knight, how hast thou shamed thy knighthood! a knight without mercy is  dishonoured! Slayer of fair ladies, shame to thee evermore! Doubt not thou  shalt thyself have need of mercy ere we leave thee.\"    Then were the brothers in great jeopardy, and feared for their lives, for  they were but two to four, and weary with travelling; and one of the four  knights shot Sir Gawain with a bolt, and hit him through the arm, so that  he could fight no more. But when there was nothing left for them but  death, there came four ladies forth and prayed the four knights' mercy for  the strangers. So they gave Sir Gawain and Gaheris their lives, and made  them yield themselves prisoners.    On the morrow, came one of the ladies to Sir Gawain, and talked with him,  saying, \"Sir knight, what cheer?\"    \"Not good,\" said he.    \"It is your own default, sir,\" said the lady, \"for ye have done a passing  foul deed in slaying that fair damsel yesterday--and ever shall it be  great shame to you. But ye be not of King Arthur's kin.\"    \"Yea, truly am I,\" said he; \"my name is Gawain, son of King Lot of Orkney,  whom King Pellinore slew--and my mother, Belisent, is half-sister to the  king.\"    When the lady heard that, she went and presently got leave for him to quit  the castle; and they gave him the head of the white hart to take with him,  because it was in his quest; but made him also carry the dead lady with  him--her head hung round his neck and her body lay before him on his  horse's neck.    So in that fashion he rode back to Camelot; and when the king and queen  saw him, and heard tell of his adventures, they were heavily displeased,  and, by the order of the queen, he was put upon his trial before a court  of ladies--who judged him to be evermore, for all his life, the knight of  ladies' quarrels, and to fight always on their side, and never against  any, except he fought for one lady and his adversary for another; also  they charged him never to refuse mercy to him that asked it, and swore him  to it on the Holy Gospels. Thus ended the adventure of the white hart.    Meanwhile, Sir Tor had made him ready, and followed the knight who rode  away with the hound. And as he went, there suddenly met him in the road a  dwarf, who struck his horse so viciously upon the head with a great staff,  that he leaped backwards a spear's length.    \"Wherefore so smitest thou my horse, foul dwarf?\" shouted Sir Tor.    \"Because thou shall not pass this way,\" replied the dwarf, \"unless thou  fight for it with yonder knights in those pavilions,\" pointing to two  tents, where two great spears stood out, and two shields hung upon two  trees hard by.    \"I may not tarry, for I am on a quest I needs must follow,\" said Sir Tor.    \"Thou shalt not pass,\" replied the dwarf, and therewith blew his horn.  Then rode out quickly at Sir Tor one armed on horseback, but Sir Tor was  quick as he, and riding at him bore him from his horse, and made him  yield. Directly after came another still more fiercely, but with a few  great strokes and buffets Sir Tor unhorsed him also, and sent them both to  Camelot to King Arthur. Then came the dwarf and begged Sir Tor to take  him in his service, \"for,\" said he, \"I will serve no more recreant  knights.\"    \"Take then a horse, and come with me,\" said Tor.    \"Ride ye after the knight with the white hound?\" said the dwarf; \"I can  soon bring ye where he is.\"    So they rode through the forest till they came to two more tents. And Sir  Tor alighting, went into the first, and saw three damsels lie there,  sleeping. Then went he to the other, and found another lady also sleeping,  and at her feet the white hound he sought for, which instantly began to  bay and bark so loudly, that the lady woke. But Sir Tor had seized the  hound and given it to the dwarfs charge.    \"What will ye do, Sir knight?\" cried out the lady; \"will ye take away my  hound from me by force?\"    \"Yea, lady,\" said Sir Tor; \"for so I must, having the king's command; and  I have followed it from King Arthur's court, at Camelot, to this place.\"    \"Well\" said the lady, \"ye will not go far before ye be ill handled, and  will repent ye of the quest.\"    \"I shall cheerfully abide whatsoever adventure cometh, by the grace of  God,\" said Sir Tor; and so mounted his horse and began to ride back on his  way. But night coming on, he turned aside to a hermitage that was in the  forest, and there abode till the next day, making but sorrowful cheer of  such poor food as the hermit had to give him, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12758"],[0,"Library of the World's Best Mystery and Detective Stories (#15)"],[1,"can judge your soul. Perhaps  Infinite Mercy will shine upon you at the last moment! We must hope so.  There are examples. So sleep in peace to-night. Tomorrow you will be  included in the _auto da fe_: that is, you will be exposed to the  _quemadero_, the symbolical flames of the Everlasting Fire: it burns,  as you know, only at a distance, my son; and Death is at least two  hours (often three) in coming, on account of the wet, iced bandages,  with which we protect the heads and hearts of the condemned. There will  be forty-three of you. Placed in the last row, you will have time to  invoke God and offer to Him this baptism of fire, which is of the Holy  Spirit. Hope in the Light, and rest.\"    With these words, having signed to his companions to unchain the  prisoner, the prior tenderly embraced him. Then came the turn of the  _fra redemptor_, who, in a low tone, entreated the Jew's forgiveness  for what he had made him suffer for the purpose of redeeming him; then  the two familiars silently kissed him. This ceremony over, the captive  was left, solitary and bewildered, in the darkness.           *       *       *       *       *    Rabbi Aser Abarbanel, with parched lips and visage worn by suffering,  at first gazed at the closed door with vacant eyes. Closed? The word  unconsciously roused a vague fancy in his mind, the fancy that he had  seen for an instant the light of the lanterns through a chink between  the door and the wall. A morbid idea of hope, due to the weakness of  his brain, stirred his whole being. He dragged himself toward the  strange _appearance_. Then, very gently and cautiously, slipping one  finger into the crevice, he drew the door toward him. Marvelous! By an  extraordinary accident the familiar who closed it had turned the huge  key an instant before it struck the stone casing, so that the rusty  bolt not having entered the hole, the door again rolled on its hinges.    The rabbi ventured to glance outside. By the aid of a sort of luminous  dusk he distinguished at first a semicircle of walls indented by  winding stairs; and opposite to him, at the top of five or six stone  steps, a sort of black portal, opening into an immense corridor, whose  first arches only were visible from below.    Stretching himself flat he crept to the threshold. Yes, it was really a  corridor, but endless in length. A wan light illumined it: lamps  suspended from the vaulted ceiling lightened at intervals the dull hue  of the atmosphere--the distance was veiled in shadow. Not a single door  appeared in the whole extent! Only on one side, the left, heavily  grated loopholes, sunk in the walls, admitted a light which must be  that of evening, for crimson bars at intervals rested on the flags of  the pavement. What a terrible silence! Yet, yonder, at the far end of  that passage there might be a doorway of escape! The Jew's vacillating  hope was tenacious, for it was _the last_.    Without hesitating, he ventured on the flags, keeping close under the  loopholes, trying to make himself part of the blackness of the long  walls. He advanced slowly, dragging himself along on his breast,  forcing back the cry of pain when some raw wound sent a keen pang  through his whole body.    Suddenly the sound of a sandaled foot approaching reached his ears. He  trembled violently, fear stifled him, his sight grew dim. Well, it was  over, no doubt. He pressed himself into a niche and, half lifeless with  terror, waited.    It was a familiar hurrying along. He passed swiftly by, holding in his  clenched hand an instrument of torture--a frightful figure--and  vanished. The suspense which the rabbi had endured seemed to have  suspended the functions of life, and he lay nearly an hour unable to  move. Fearing an increase of tortures if he were captured, he thought  of returning to his dungeon. But the old hope whispered in his soul  that divine _perhaps_, which comforts us in our sorest trials. A  miracle had happened. He could doubt no longer. He began to crawl  toward the chance of escape. Exhausted by suffering and hunger,  trembling with pain, he pressed onward. The sepulchral corridor seemed  to lengthen mysteriously, while he, still advancing, gazed into the  gloom where there _must_ be some avenue of escape.    Oh! oh! He again heard footsteps, but this time they were slower, more  heavy. The white and black forms of two inquisitors appeared, emerging  from the obscurity beyond. They were conversing in low tones, and  seemed to be discussing some important subject, for they were  gesticulating vehemently.    At this spectacle Rabbi Aser Abarbanel closed his eyes: his heart beat  so violently that it almost suffocated him; his rags were damp with the  cold sweat of agony; he lay motionless by the wall, his mouth wide  open, under the rays of a lamp, praying to the God of David.    Just opposite to him the two inquisitors paused under the light of the  lamp--doubtless owing to some accident due to the course of their  argument. One, while listening to his companion, gazed at the rabbi!  And, beneath the look--whose absence of expression the hapless man did  not at first notice--he fancied he again felt the burning pincers  scorch his flesh, he was to be once more a living wound. Fainting,  breathless, with fluttering eyelids, he shivered at the touch of the  monk's floating robe. But--strange yet natural fact--the inquisitor's  gaze was evidently that of a man deeply absorbed in his intended reply,  engrossed by what he was hearing; his eyes were fixed--and seemed to  look at the Jew _without seeing him_.    In fact, after the lapse of a few minutes, the two gloomy figures  slowly pursued their way, still conversing in low tones, toward the  place whence the prisoner had come; HE HAD NOT BEEN SEEN! Amid the  horrible confusion of the rabbi's thoughts, the idea darted through  his brain: \"Can I be already dead that they did not see me?\" A hideous  impression roused him from his lethargy: in looking at the wall  against which his face was pressed, he imagined he beheld two fierce  eyes watching him! He flung his head back in a sudden frenzy of  fright, his hair fairly bristling! Yet, no! No. His hand groped over  the stones: it was the _reflection_ of the inquisitor's eyes, still  retained in his own, which had been refracted from two spots on the  wall.    Forward! He must hasten toward that goal which he fancied (absurdly, no  doubt) to be deliverance, toward the darkness from which he was now  barely thirty paces distant. He pressed forward faster on his knees,  his hands, at full length, dragging himself painfully along, and soon  entered the dark portion of this terrible corridor.    Suddenly the poor wretch felt a gust of cold air on the hands resting  upon the flags; it came from under the little door to which the two  walls led.    Oh, Heaven, if that door should open outward. Every nerve in the  miserable fugitive's body thrilled with hope. He examined it from top  to bottom, though scarcely able to distinguish its outlines in the  surrounding darkness. He passed his hand over it: no bolt, no lock! A  latch! He started up, the latch yielded to the pressure of his thumb:  the door silently swung open before him.    \"HALLELUIA!\" murmured the rabbi in a transport of gratitude as,  standing on the threshold, he beheld the scene before him.    The door had opened into the gardens, above which arched a starlit  sky, into spring, liberty, life! It revealed the neighboring fields,  stretching toward the sierras, whose sinuous blue lines were relieved  against the horizon. Yonder lay freedom! Oh, to escape! He would  journey all night through the lemon groves, whose fragrance reached  him. Once in the mountains and he was safe! He inhaled the delicious  air; the breeze revived him, his lungs expanded! He felt in his  swelling heart the _Veni foras_ of Lazarus! And to thank once more the  God who had bestowed this mercy upon him, he extended his arms,  raising his eyes toward Heaven. It was an ecstasy of joy!    Then he fancied he saw the shadow of his arms approach him--fancied  that he felt these shadowy arms inclose, embrace him--and that he was  pressed tenderly to some one's breast. A tall figure actually did  stand directly before him. He lowered his eyes--and remained  motionless, gasping for breath, dazed, with fixed eyes, fairly  driveling with terror.    Horror! He was in the clasp of the Grand Inquisitor himself, the  venerable Pedro Arbuez d'Espila, who gazed at him with tearful eyes,  like a good shepherd who had found his stray lamb.    The dark-robed priest pressed the hapless Jew to his heart with so  fervent an outburst of love, that the edges of the monochal haircloth  rubbed the Dominican's breast. And while Aser Abarbanel with  protruding eyes gasped in agony in the ascetic's embrace, vaguely  comprehending that _all the phases of this fatal evening were only a  prearranged torture, that of_ HOPE, the Grand Inquisitor, with an  accent of touching reproach and a look of consternation, murmured in  his ear, his breath parched and burning from long fasting:    \"What, my son! On the eve, perchance, of salvation--you wished to leave  us?\"          ERCKMANN-CHATRIAN    _The Owl's Ear_      On the 29th of July, 1835, Kasper Boeck, a shepherd of the little  village of Hirschwiller, with his large felt hat tipped back, his  wallet of stringy sackcloth hanging at his hip, and his great tawny dog  at his heels, presented himself at about nine o'clock in the evening at  the house of the burgomaster, Petrus Mauerer, who had just finished  supper and was taking a little glass of kirchwasser to facilitate  digestion.    This burgomaster was a tall, thin man, and wore a bushy gray mustache.  He had seen service in the armies of the Archduke Charles. He had a  jovial disposition, and ruled the village, it is said, with his finger  and with the rod.    \"Mr. Burgomaster,\" cried the shepherd in evident excitement.    But"]]]
