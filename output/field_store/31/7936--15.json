In opposition to the  unsatisfactory attempts of modern scholars, it is the traditional  interpretation of Mitra and Varuna that Mitra was god of day (_i.e.,_  the sun), and Varuna the god of night (_i.e.,_ covering),[85] while  native belief regularly attributes to him the lordship of water[86].  The 'thousand eyes' of Varuna are the result of this view. The other  light-side of Varuna as special lord of day (excluding the all-heaven  idea with the sun as his 'eye') is elsewhere scarcely referred to,  save in late hymns and VIII. 41.[87] In conjunction with the  storm-god, Indra, the wrath-side of Varuna is further developed. The  prayer for release is from 'long darkness,' _i.e._, from death; in  other words, may the light of life be restored (II. 27. 14-15; II. 28.  7). Grassmann, who believes that in Varuna there is an early  monotheistic deity, enumerates all his offices and omits the giving of  rain from the list;[88] while Ludwig derives his name from _var_ (=  velle) and defines him as the lofty god who wills!    Varuna's highest development ushers in the middle period of the Rig  Veda; before the rise of the later All-father, and even before the  great elevation of Indra. But when S[=u]rya and Dawn were chief, then  Varuna was chiefest. There is no monotheism in the worship of a god  who is regularly associated as one of a pair with another god. Nor is  there in Varuna any religious grandeur which, so far as it exceeds  that of other divinities, is not evolved from his old physical side.  One cannot personify heaven and write a descriptive poem about him  without becoming elevated in style, as compared with the tone of one  that praises a rain-cloud or even the more confined personality of the  sun. There is a stylistic but not a metaphysical descent from this  earlier period in the 'lords of the atmosphere,' for, as we shall  show, the elevation of Indra and Agni denotes a philosophical  conception yet more advanced than the almost monotheistic greatness  attained by Varuna. But one must find the background to this earlier  period; and in it Varuna is not monotheistic. He is the covering sky  united with the sun, or he whose covering is rain and dew. Indra  treats Varuna as Savitar treats Mitra, supplants him; and for the same  reason, because each represents the same priestly philosophy.    In the one extant hymn to Mitra (who is Indo-Iranian) it is Mitra that  'watches men,' and 'bears earth and heaven.' He is here (iii. 59) the  kindly sun, his name (Mitra, 'friend') being frequently punned upon.    The point of view taken by Barth deserves comment. He says:[89] \"It  has sometimes been maintained that the Varuna of the hymns is a god in  a state of decadence. In this view we can by no means concur; ... an  appeal to these few hymns is enough to prove that in the consciousness  of their authors the divinity of Varuna stood still intact.\" If,  instead of 'still intact,' the author had said, 'on the increase, till  undermined by still later philosophical speculation,' the true  position, in our opinion, would have been given. But a distinction  must be made between decadence of greatness and decadence of  popularity. It has happened in the case of some of the Vedic inherited  gods that exactly in proportion as their popularity decreased their  greatness increased; that is to say, as they became more vague and  less individual to the folk they were expanded into wider circles of  relationship by the theosophist, and absorbed other gods' majesty.[89]  Varuna is no longer a popular god in the Rig Veda. He is already a god  of speculation, only the speculation did not go far enough to suit the  later seers of Indra-Savitar-hood. Most certainly his worship, when  compared in popularity with that of Agni and Indra, is unequal. But  this is because he is too remote to be popular.    What made the popular gods was a union of near physical force to  please the vulgar, with philosophical mysticism to please the priest,  and Indra and Agni fulfilled the conditions, while awful, but distant,  Varuna did not.    In stating that the great hymn to Varuna is not typical of the  earliest stage of religious belief among the Vedic Aryans, we should  add one word in explanation. Varuna's traits, as shown in other parts  of the Rig Veda, are so persistent that they must be characteristic of  his original function. It does not follow, however, that any one hymn  in which he is lauded is necessarily older than the hymn cited from  the first book. The earliest stage of religious development precedes  the entrance into the Punj[=a]b. It may even be admitted that at the  time when the Vedic Aryans became Hindus, that is, when they settled  about the Indus, Varuna was the great god we see him in the great hymn  to his honor. But while the relation of the [=A]dityas to the spirits  of Ahura in Zoroaster's system points to this, yet it is absurd to  assume this epoch as the starting point of Vedic belief. Back of this  period lies one in which Varuna was by no means a monotheistic deity,  nor even the greatest divinity among the gods. The fact, noticed by  Hillebrandt, that the Vasishtha family are the chief praisers of  Varuna, may also indicate that his special elevation was due to the  theological conceptions of one clan, rather than of the whole people,  since in the other family books he is worshipped more as one of a  pair, Varuna and Mitra, heaven and sun.      ADITI.    The mother of Varuna and the luminous gods is the 'mother of kings,'  Boundlessness (_aditi_)[90] a product of priestly theosophy. Aditi  makes, perhaps, the first approach to formal pantheism in India, for  all gods, men, and things are identified with her (i. 89. 10). Seven  children of Aditi are mentioned, to whom is added an eighth (in one  hymn).[91] The chief of these, who is, _par excellence_ the [=A]ditya  (son of Aditi), is Varuna. Most of the others are divinities of the  sun (x. 72). With Varuna stands Mitra, and besides this pair are found  'the true friend' Aryaman, Savitar, Bhaga, and, later, Indra, as sun  (?). Daksha and Anca are also reckoned as [=A]dityas, and S[=u]rya is  enumerated among them as a divinity distinct from Savitar. But the  word _aditi,_ 'unbound,' is often a mere epithet, of Fire, Sky, etc.  Moreover, in one passage, at least, _aditi_ simply means 'freedom' (i.  24. 1), less boundlessness than 'un-bondage'; so, probably, in i. 185.  3, 'the gift of freedom.' Anca seems to have much the same meaning  with Bhaga, _viz.,_ the sharer, giver. Daksha may, perhaps, be the  'clever,' 'strong' one ([Greek: dexios]), abstract Strength; as  another name of the sun (?). Aditi herself (according to Mueller,  Infinity; according to Hillebrandt, Eternity) is an abstraction that  is born later than her chief sons, Sun and Varuna.[92] Zarathustra  (Zoroaster, not earlier than the close of the first Vedic period) took  the seven [=A]dityas and reformed them into one monotheistic  (dualistic) Spirit (Ahura), with a circle of six moral attendants,  thereby dynamically destroying every physical conception of them.      DAWN.    We have devoted considerable space to Varuna because of the  theological importance with which is invested his personality. If one  admit that a monotheistic Varuna is the _ur_-Varuna, if one see in him  a sign that the Hindus originally worshipped one universally great  superior god, whose image effaced that of all the others,[93] then the  attempt to trace any orderly development in Hindu theology may as well  be renounced; and one must imagine that this peculiar people, starting  with monotheism descended to polytheism, and then leapt again into the  conception of that Father-god whose form, in the end of the Rig Vedic  period, out-varunas Varuna as encompasser and lord of all. If, on the  other hand, one see in Varuna a god who, from the 'covering,' heaven  and cloud and rain, from earliest time has been associated with the  sun as a pair, and recognize in Varuna's loftier form the product of  that gradual elevation to which were liable all the gods at the hands  of the Hindu priests; if one see in him at this stage the highest god  which a theology, based on the worship of natural phenomena, was able  to evolve; then, for the reception of those gods who overthrew him  from his supremacy, because of their greater freedom from physical  restraints, there is opened a logical and historical path--until that  god comes who in turn follows these half-embodied ones, and stands as  the first immaterial author of the universe--and so one may walk  straight from the physical beginning of the Rig Vedic religion to its  spiritual Brahmanic end.    We turn now to one or two phenomena-deities that were never much  tampered with by priestly speculation; their forms being still as  bright and clear as when the first Vedic worshipper, waiting to salute  the rising sun, beheld in all her beauty, and thus praised    THE DAWN.[94]      As comes a bride hath she approached us, gleaming;    All things that live she rouses now to action.    A fire is born that shines for human beings;    Light hath she made, and driven away the darkness.      Wide-reaching hath she risen, to all approaching,    And shone forth clothed in garments white and glistening,    Of gold her color, fair to see her look is,    Mother of kine,[95] leader of days she gleameth.      Bearing the gods' eye, she, the gracious maiden,    --Leading along the white and sightly charger[96]    --Aurora, now is seen, revealed in glory,    With shining guerdons unto all appearing.      O near and dear one, light far off our foes, and    Make safe to us our kines' wide pasture-places.    Keep from us hatred; what is good, that bring us,    And send the singer wealth, O generous maiden.      With thy best beams for us do thou beam widely,    Aurora, goddess bright, our life extending;    And food bestow, O thou all goods possessing,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14515"],[0,"The Nervous Child (#15)"],[1,"to the hospital on false pretences.  Hence, perhaps for the first time in many years, the child is free  from the obsession, and the bed is not wetted.    _(c)_ In the third place, it is easy to recognise in the history of  many of the cases, the ill-effects of circumstances which add new  force to the fear of failure or shake the confidence in the control  which had been regained. Thus a boy, an only child, who had suffered  from enuresis till his seventh year, had regained complete control  till his eleventh year, when he went to school. In his dormitory at  school was a boy who had enuresis, and who was being fined and  punished by the schoolmaster. The enuresis at once reappeared and  continued unchecked so long as he was at school. As might be expected,  school life is very inimical to cure, unless the trouble can be kept  from the knowledge of the other boys. Anything which directly  increases the nervousness of the child--an illness, for example, with  loss of weight and failure of nutrition, or some mental stress, such  as the approach of an examination--is apt to accentuate the enuresis.    _(d)_ In the fourth place, the incontinence sometimes spreads to the  daytime, and the child is wet both by day and night. Further, in bad  cases it is not uncommon to find incontinence of faeces making its  appearance also. These extensions of the fault only take place when  the management continues to be very faulty, when the grown-up people  around them are more than usually distressed and pessimistic, and have  redoubled their expostulations and appeals.    Now these peculiarities of enuresis seem to me only explicable if we  assume that the want of control is due to auto-suggestion, dependent  at the beginning on the unwise attitude adopted towards the fault by  the nurses and parents, and later kept up by the sense of shame and  the mental distress involved.    The forms of treatment which have been recommended from time to time  are, as might be expected, very numerous.    _(a) Operative._--(i) Removal of tonsils and adenoids, (ii)  Circumcision.    _(b) Manipulative._--(i) Injection of saline solution under the skin  in the perineal and pubic regions, with object of lowering the  excitability of the bladder by counter-irritation. (ii) Gradual  distension of the bladder by hydrostatic pressure, (iii) Tilting the  foot of the bed so as to throw the urine to the fundus of the  bladder, in order to protect the sensitive trigone from irritation.    _(c) Educative._--(i) Curtailing the fluid drunk. (ii) Waking the  child at intervals during the night by an alarm clock or otherwise.  (iii) Rewards and punishments.    _(d) Medicinal._--(i) Belladonna. (ii) Thyroid extract.    _(e) By Suggestion._--(i) By simple suggestion. (ii) By hypnotic  suggestion.    I do not think that any single one of these various forms of treatment  outlined under the first four heads has any effect other than to aid  the suggestion of cure which we proffer in adopting it. Removal of  tonsils and adenoid vegetations might conceivably cure an enuresis  which is nocturnal, it cannot account for an incontinence which  spreads to the day. We might believe that to distend the bladder by  hydrostatic pressure was a cure for incontinence of urine, and that it  acted by removing the local cause,--the smallness and contraction of  the bladder,--were it not that the loss of control is so apt to spread  to the rectum as well. There is no evidence that the urine is  peculiarly irritating. Indeed, such evidence as we have goes to show  that, as in some other neuroses, the urine in enuresis is unduly  copious, and of very low specific gravity. Incidentally, we have in  this polyuria a further argument against the view recently advanced  that a small and contracted irritable bladder is the cause of  enuresis. We do, of course, meet with cases of irritable bladder often  enough, but the complaint is then not of incontinence, but always of  the discomfort of having to rise so frequently for micturition.    To deprive the child of fluid, to wake her many times at night, to  tilt the foot of the bed, are devices which may help in the hands of  some one who is confident of his ability to cure the condition and can  communicate the confidence to the child. Carried out hopelessly and  pessimistically by a tired and exasperated mother, they are well  calculated to strengthen the hold which the obsession has on the  child, so that often we meet with a mother who rightly enough  maintains that the more she wakes the child, the oftener the bed is  wet, till she wonders where it all comes from.    The treatment of enuresis to be successful must be conducted through  and by means of the grown-up persons who have the control of the  children. To stop the development of enuresis in early infancy we must  intervene to prevent the concentration of the child's mind on the  difficulty. During the time when control is ordinarily developed, in  the second and third year, judicious management of the child is  essential. The emphasis should be laid upon successes, not upon  failures. For every child his reputation will sway in the balance for  a time. He must be helped and encouraged to self-confidence, not  rendered diffident or self-conscious.    If the case is well established before it comes under our notice, the  mother, the nurse, the schoolmaster, or whoever is responsible for the  child's management, must understand clearly the nature of the trouble.  The suggestion acting on the child's mind must be altered, and  self-confidence restored. The child must learn to see that the thing  is not so desperately tragic. He should be told that the trouble  always gets well, and that it only goes on now because he is worried  about it and keeps thinking of it. If the whole environment of the  child is bad, so that such a change of suggestion is not possible, and  if enuresis is but one of many symptoms of mental or moral  instability, it may be necessary to remove the child and place him  under the influence of some one else. Sometimes the prescription of a  rubber urinal, which the child can slip on at night, is directly  curative. A public school boy, who was about to be sent away from  school for this failing, fortified by the possession of this  apparatus, wrote six months later to say that he knew now that it must  be all worry that caused the trouble, because with the urinal in  position he had not once had the incontinence.    In inveterate cases hypnotic suggestion is always, I think,  successful. It is obvious, however, that in many cases there are  objections to its use. Often enuresis is evidence that the child's  home environment has been at fault, and that his mental and moral  development has been retarded. It is the management which must be  modified or the home, if necessary, changed. Hypnotic suggestion will  make this one symptom disappear promptly enough, but it will rather  perpetuate than combat the cause--that undue susceptibility to  suggestion, which is characteristic alike of the little child and of  many older neuropathic persons.          CHAPTER VII    TOYS, BOOKS, AND AMUSEMENTS      Any one who has an opportunity of watching little children must have  observed that they are happiest and most contented when playing alone.  The education of the little child is carried on by means of games and  toys. Handling the various objects which we give him, imparting  movement to them, transferring them from hand to hand and from one  situation to another, he learns dexterity and precision of movement,  and in the process hand and brain grow in power. When at play, his  whole energies should be absorbed to the exclusion of everything else.  He will often be oblivious to everything that is going on around him,  intent only on the purpose of the moment. In order to permit this  fervour of self-education it is necessary that the child should be  accustomed to playing alone, and it is well, if only for convenience'  sake, that he should be accustomed to playing in a room by himself.  Something is wrong if the child cannot be left for a few moments  without breaking into tears or displaying bad temper. Engrossed in his  own tasks, he should be content to leave his nurse to move in and out  of the room without protest. If this fault has appeared and the child  cannot be left alone, our whole educational system is undermined, and  play will be profitless and over-exciting, because it demands the  constant participation of grown-up people. As a preliminary to all  improvement in the management of a nervous child, we must see to it  that he becomes accustomed to being alone. We must so arrange his  nursery that he can do no damage to himself. Scissors and matches must  not be left lying about, and a fireguard must be fixed in position so  that it cannot be disturbed. Then, disregarding his protests, the  nurse must leave him to himself, at first only for a moment or two,  re-entering the room in a matter-of-fact way without speaking to him,  and again leaving it. Soon he will learn that a temporary separation  does not mean that we have abandoned him for all time. Then the period  of absence can be gradually lengthened till all difficulty disappears.  Once his attention is removed from the grown-up people who mean so  much to him, his natural impulse to explore and experiment with his  playthings will show itself. Those toys are best which are neither  elaborate nor expensive. For a little child a small box containing a  miscellaneous collection of wooden or metal objects, none of them  small enough to be in danger of being swallowed, forms the material  for which his soul craves. Everything else in the room may be out of  his reach. A dozen times he will empty the box and then replace each  object in turn. He will arrange them in every possible combination,  and then sweep the whole away to start afresh.    At eighteen months of age observation and imitative"]]]
