Business men and bankers frequently shock their  friends and the community by suicide, on disclosures showing they have  embezzled money to use on some financial venture that came to a  disastrous end.    These cases are not difficult to understand. The love of money is the  controlling emotion of the age. Just as religion, war, learning,  invention and discovery have been the moving passions of former ages, so  now the accumulation of large fortunes is the main object that moves  man. It does not follow that this phase will not pass away and give  place to something more worth while, but while it lasts it will claim  its victims, just as other strong emotions in turn have done. The fear  of poverty, especially by those who have known something of the value of  money, the desire for the power that money brings, the envy of others,  the opportunities that seem easy, all these feelings are too strong for  many fairly good \"machines,\" and bring disaster when plans go wrong.    Only a small portion of those who have speculated with trust funds are  ever prosecuted. Generally the speculation is successful or at least  covered up. Many men prefer to take a chance of disgrace or punishment  or death rather than remain poor. These are not necessarily dishonest or  bad. They may be more venturesome, or more unfortunate; at any rate, it  is obvious that the passion for money, the chance to get it, the dread  of poverty, the love of wealth and power were too strong for their  equipment, otherwise the pressure would have been resisted. The same  pressure on some other man would not have brought disaster.    The restrictions placed around the accumulation of property are  multiplying faster than any other portions of the criminal code. It  takes a long time for new customs or habits or restraints to become a  part of the life and consciousness of man so that the mere suggestion of  the act causes the reaction that doing it is wrong. No matter how long  some statutes are on the books, and how severe the penalties, many men  never believe that doing the forbidden act is really a crime. For  instance, the violations of many revenue laws, game laws, prohibition  laws, and many laws against various means of getting property are often  considered as not really criminal. In fact, a large and probably growing  class of men disputes the justice of creating many legal rules in  reference to private property.    Primitive peoples, as a rule, held property in common. Their inhibitions  were few and simple. They took what they needed and wanted in the  easiest way. There is a strong call in all life to hark back to  primitive feelings, customs and habits. Many new laws are especially  painful and difficult to a large class of weak men who form the bulk of  our criminal class.    To understand the constant urge to throw off the shackles of  civilization, one need but think of the number of men who use liquor or  drugs. One need only look at the professional and business man, who at  every opportunity leaves civilization and goes to the woods to kill wild  animals or to the lakes and streams to fish.    The call to live a simple life, free from the conventions, customs and  rules, to kill for the sake of killing, to get to the woods and streams  and away from brick buildings and stone walls, is strong in the  constitution of almost every man. Probably the underlying cause of the  world war was the need of man to relax from the hard and growing strain  of the civilization that is continually weaving new fetters to bind  him. There must always come a breaking point, for, after all, man is an  animal and can live only from and by the primitive things.    Children have no idea of the rights of property. It takes long and  patient teaching, even to the most intelligent, to make them feel that  there is a point at which the taking of property is wrong. Nowhere in  Nature can we see an analogy to our property rights. Plants and animals  alike get their sustenance where and how they can. It is not meant here  to discuss the question of how many of the restrictions that control the  getting of property are wise and how many are foolish; it is only meant  to give the facts as they affect life and conduct.    It is certainly true that the child learns very slowly and very  imperfectly to distinguish the ways by which he may and may not get  property. His nature always protests against it as he goes along. Only a  few can ever learn it in anything like completeness. Many men cannot  learn it, and if they learned the forbidden things they would have no  feeling that to disobey was wrong. Even the most intelligent ones never  know or feel the whole code, and in fact, lawyers are forever debating  and judges doubting as to whether many ways of getting property are  inside or outside the law. No doubt many of the methods that intelligent  and respected men adopt for getting property have more inherent  criminality than others that are directly forbidden by the law. It must  always be remembered that all laws are naturally and inevitably evolved  by the strongest force in a community, and in the last analysis made for  the protection of the dominant class.          XV    ATTITUDE OF THE CRIMINAL      Probably the chief barrier to the commission of crime is the feeling of  right and wrong connected with the doing or not doing of particular  acts. All men have a more or less binding conscience. This is the result  of long teaching and habit in matters of conduct. Most people are taught  at home and in school that certain things are right and that others are  wrong. This constant instruction builds up habits and rules of conduct,  and it is mainly upon these that society depends for the behavior of its  citizens. To most men conscience is the monitor, rather than law. It  acts more automatically, and a shock to the conscience is far more  effective than the knowledge that a law is broken. For the most part the  promptings of conscience follow pretty closely the inhibitions of the  criminal code, although they may or may not follow the spirit of the  law. Each person has his own idea of the relative values attached to  human actions. That is, no two machines respond exactly alike as to the  relative importance of different things. No two ethical commands have  the same importance to all people or to any two people. Often men do  not hesitate to circumvent or violate one statute, when they could never  be even tempted to violate another.    Ordinarily unless the response of conscience is quick and plain, men are  not bothered by the infraction of the law except, perchance, by the fear  of discovery. This is quite apart from the teaching that it is the duty  of all men to obey all laws, a proposition so general that it has no  effect. Even those who make the statement do not follow the precept, and  the long list of penal laws that die from lack of enforcement instead of  by repeal is too well known to warrant the belief that anyone pays  serious attention to such a purely academic statement. No one believes  in the enforcement of all laws or the duty to obey all laws, and no one,  in fact, does obey them all. Those who proclaim the loudest the duty of  obedience to all laws never obey, for example, the revenue laws. These  are clear and explicit, and yet men take every means possible to have  their property exempted from taxation--in other words, to defraud the  State. This is done on the excuse that everyone else does it, and the  man who makes a strict return according to law would pay the taxes of  the shirkers. While this is true, it simply shows that all men violate  the law when the justification seems sufficient to them. The laws  against blasphemy, against Sunday work and Sunday play, against buying  and transporting intoxicating liquors and smuggling goods are freely  violated. Many laws are so recent that they have not grown to be  folk-ways or fixed new habits, and their violation brings no moral  shock. In spite of the professions often made, most men have a poor  opinion of congressmen and legislators, and feel that their own  conscience is a much higher guide for them than the law.    Religions have always taught obedience to God or to what takes His  place. Religious commands and feelings, are higher and more binding on  man than human law. The captains of industry are forever belittling and  criticising all those laws made by legislatures and courts which  interfere with the unrestricted use of property. None of this sort of  legislation has their approval and the courts are regarded as meddlesome  when they enforce it. The anti-trust laws, the anti-pooling laws,  factory legislation of all kinds, anything in short that interferes with  the unrestricted use of property by its owner are roundly condemned and  violated by evasion. On the other hand, so much has been written and  said in reference to the creation of the fundamental rights to own  property, and these rights depend so absolutely upon social arrangements  and work out such manifest injustice and inequality, that there is  always a deep-seated feeling of protest against many of our so-called  property laws. From those who advocate a new distribution of wealth and  condemn the injustice of present property rights, the step is quite  short to those who feel the injustice and put their ideas in force by  taking property when and where they are able to get it.    For instance, a miner may believe that the corporation for which he  works really has no right to the gold down in the mine. As he is digging  he strikes a particularly rich pocket of high-grade ore. He feels that  he does no wrong if he appropriates the ore. Elaborate means are taken  to prevent this, even compelling the absolute stripping of the workman,  and a complete change of clothes on going in and coming out of the mine.    Many laws are put on the books which are of a purely sumptuary nature;  these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12058"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#15)"],[1," could readily guess the presence      of the Pandavas there. This is too far-fetched and does not at      all agree with the spirit of their report to Duryodhana below.      And then the same word occurs in the very last line of the      Section. I take it that in both places the word has been used in      the same sense.      SECTION XXVI    (_Go-harana Parva_)    Vaisampayana said, \"Having listened to these words of his spies, king  Duryodhana reflected inwardly for some time and then addressed his  courtiers, saying, 'It is difficult to ascertain the course of events  definitely. Discern ye all, therefore, whither the sons of Pandu have  gone, of this thirteenth year which they are to pass undiscovered by us  all, the greater part hath already expired. What remains is by much the  smaller. If, indeed, the sons of Pandu can pass undiscovered what  remains of this year, devoted to the vow of truth as they are, they will  then have fulfilled their pledge. They will then return like mighty  elephants with temporal juice trickling down, or like snakes of virulent  poison. Filled with wrath, they will, without doubt, be inflicters of  terrible chastisement on the Kurus. It behoveth ye, therefore, to make  such efforts without loss of time as may induce the sons of Pandu,  acquainted as they are with the proprieties of time, and staying as they  now are in painful disguise, to re-enter the woods suppressing their  rage. Indeed, adopt ye such means as may remove all causes of quarrel  and anxiety from the kingdom, making it tranquil and foeless and  incapable of sustaining a diminution of territory.' Hearing these words  of Duryodhana, Karna said, 'Let other spies, abler and more cunning, and  capable of accomplishing their object, quickly go hence, O Bharata. Let  them, well-disguised, wander through swelling kingdoms and populous  provinces, prying into assemblies of the learned and delightful retreats  of provinces. In the inner apartments of palaces, in shrines and holy  spots, in mines and diverse other regions, the sons of Pandu should be  searched after with well-directed eagerness. Let the sons of Pandu who  are living in disguise be searched after by well-skilled spies in large  numbers, devoted to their work, themselves well-disguised, and all  well-acquainted with the objects of their search. Let the search be made  on the banks of rivers, in holy regions, in villages and towns, in  retreats of ascetics, in delightful mountains and mountain-caves.' When  Karna ceased, Duryodhana's second brother Duhsasana, wedded to a sinful  disposition, then addressed his eldest brother and said, 'O monarch, O  lord of men, let those spies only in whom we have confidence, receiving  their rewards in advance, once more go after the search. This and what  else hath been said by Karna have our fullest approval. Let all the  spies engage themselves in the search according to the directions  already given. Let these and others engage in the search from province  to province according to approved rules. It is my belief, however, that  the track the Pandavas have followed or their present abode or  occupation will not be discovered. Perhaps, they are closely concealed;  perhaps, they have gone to the other side of the ocean. Or, perhaps,  proud as they are of their strength and courage, they have been devoured  by wild beasts; or perhaps, having been overtaken by some unusual  danger, they have perished for eternity. Therefore, O prince of the Kuru  race, dispelling all anxieties from thy heart, achieve what thou wilt,  always acting according to thy energy.'\"      SECTION XXVII    Vaisampayana said, \"Endued with mighty energy and possessed of great  discernment, Drona then said, 'Persons like the sons of Pandu never  perish nor undergo discomfiture. Brave and skilled in every science,  intelligent and with senses under control, virtuous and grateful and  obedient to the virtuous Yudhishthira, ever following in the wake of  their eldest brother who is conversant with the conclusions of policy  and virtue and profit, who is attached to them as a father, and who  strictly adhereth to virtue and is firm in truth,--persons like them  that are thus devoted to their illustrious and royal brother, who gifted  with great intelligence, never injureth any body and who in his turn  himself obeyeth his younger brothers, never perish in this way. Why,  then, should not (Yudhishthira) the son of Pritha possessing a knowledge  of policy, be able to restore the prosperity of his brothers who are so  obedient and devoted and high-souled? It is for this that they are  carefully waiting for the arrival of their opportunity. Men such as  these never perish. This is what I see by my intellect. Do, therefore,  quickly and without loss of time, what should now be done, after proper  reflection. And let also the abode which the sons of Pandu with souls  under control as regards every purpose of life, are to occupy, be now  settled. Heroic and sinless and possessed of ascetic merit, the Pandavas  are difficult to be discovered (within the period of non-discovery).  Intelligent and possessed of every virtue, devoted to truth and versed  in the principles of policy, endued with purity and holiness, and the  embodiment of immeasurable energy, the son of Pritha is capable of  consuming (his foes) by a glance alone of his eyes. Knowing all this, do  what is proper. Let us, therefore, once more search after them, sending  Brahmanas and _Charanas_, ascetics crowned with success, and others of  this kind who may have a knowledge of those heroes!'\"      SECTION XXVIII    Vaisampayana said, \"Then that grandsire of the Bharatas, Bhishma the son  of Santanu, conversant with the _Vedas_, acquainted with the  proprieties of time and place, and possessing a knowledge of every duty  of morality, after the conclusion of Drona's speech, applauded the words  of the preceptor and spake unto the Bharatas for their benefit these  words consistent with virtue, expressive of his attachment to the  virtuous Yudhishthira, rarely spoken by men that are dishonest, and  always meeting with the approbation of the honest. And the words that  Bhishma spake were thoroughly impartial and worshipped by the wise. And  the grandsire of the Kurus said, 'The words that the regenerate Drona  acquainted with the truth of every affair hath uttered, are approved by  me. I have no hesitation in saying so. Endued with every auspicious  mark, observant of virtuous vows, possessed of Vedic lore, devoted to  religious observances, conversant with various sciences, obedient to the  counsels of the aged, adhering to the vow of truth, acquainted with the  proprieties of time, observant of the pledge they have given (in respect  of their exile), pure in their behaviour, ever adhering to the duties of  the Kshatriya order, always obedient to Kesava, high-souled, possessed  of great strength, and ever-bearing the burthens of the wise, those  heroic ones can never wither under misfortune. Aided by their own  energy, sons of Pandu who are now leading a life of concealment in  obedience to virtue, will surely never perish. It is even this that my  mind surmiseth. Therefore, O Bharata, I am for employing the aid of  honest counsel in our behaviour towards the sons of Pandu. It would not  be the policy of any wise man to cause them to be discovered now by  means of spies,[21] what we should do unto the sons of Pandu, I shall  say, reflecting with the aid of the intellect. Know that I shall say  nothing from ill will to thee. People like me should never give such  counsels to him that is dishonest, for only counsels (like those I would  give) should be offered unto them that are honest. Counsels, however,  that are evil, should under no circumstances be offered. He, O child,  that is devoted to truth and obedient to the aged, he, indeed, that is  wise, while speaking in the midst of an assembly, should under all  circumstances speak the truth, if the acquisition of virtue be an object  with him. I should, therefore, say that I think differently from all  those people here, in respect of the abode of Yudhishthira the just in  this the thirteenth year of his exile. The ruler, O child, of the city  or the province where king Yudhishthira resides cannot have any  misfortune. Charitable and liberal and humble and modest must the people  be of the country where king Yudhishthira resides. Agreeable in speech,  with passions under control, observant of truth, cheerful, healthy, pure  in conduct, and skilful in work must the people be of the country where  king Yudhishthira resides. The people of the place, where Yudhishthira  is, cannot be envious or malicious, or vain, or proud, but must all  adhere to their respective duties. Indeed, in the place where  Yudhishthira resides, Vedic hymns will be chanted all around, sacrifices  will be performed, the last full libations will always be poured,[22]  and gifts to Brahmanas will always be in profusion. There the clouds,  without doubt, pour abundant rain, and furnished with good harvest the  country will ever be without fear. There the paddy will not be without  grain, fruits will not be bereft of juice, floral garlands will not be  without fragrance, and the conversation of men will always be full of  agreeable words. There where king Yudhishthira resides, the breezes will  be delicious, the meetings of men will always be friendly, and cause of  fear there will be none. There kine will be plentiful, without any of  them being lean-fleshed or weak, and milk and curds and butter will all  be savoury and nutritious. There where king Yudhishthira resides, every  kind of corn will be full of nutrition and every edible full of flavour.  There where king Yudhishthira resides, the objects of all the senses,  viz.,--taste, touch, smell, and hearing, will be endued with excellent  attributes. There where king Yudhishthira resides, the sights and scenes  will be gladdening. And "]]]
