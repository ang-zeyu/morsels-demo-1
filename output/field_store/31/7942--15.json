Shakespeare, Druggist,\" as  to stimulate myself with the juicy joints of \"C. Dickens, Family  Butcher.\" Of these and suchlike pernicious establishments my patronage  consists in weaving round the shop-door a barbed-wire entanglement of  dialectic and then training my moral machine-guns on the customers.    In this devilish function I have, as you know, acquired by practice  a tremendous technical skill; and but for the more or less innocent  pride I take in showing off my accomplishment to all and sundry, I  doubt whether even my iron nerves would be proof against the horrors  that have impelled me to thus perfect myself. In my nonage I believed  humanity could be reformed if only it were intelligently preached  at for a sufficiently long period. This first fine careless rapture  I could no more recapture, at my age, than I could recapture  hoopingcough or nettlerash. One by one, I have flung all political  nostra overboard, till there remain only dynamite and scientific  breeding. My touching faith in these saves me from pessimism: I  believe in the future; but this only makes the present--which I  foresee as going strong for a couple of million of years or so--all  the more excruciating by contrast.    For casting into dramatic form a compendium of my indictments of the  present from a purely political standpoint, the old play of Snt George  occurred to me as having exactly the framework I needed. In the person  of the Turkish Knight I could embody that howling chaos which does  duty among us for a body-politic. The English Knight would accordingly  be the Liberal Party, whose efforts (whenever it is in favor with the  electorate) to reduce chaos to order by emulating in foreign politics  the blackguardism of a Metternich or Bismarck, and in home politics  the spirited attitudinisings of a Garibaldi or Cavor, are foredoomed  to the failure which its inherent oldmaidishness must always win for  the Liberal Party in all undertakings whatsoever. Snt George is, of  course, myself. But here my very aptitude in controversy tripped me up  as playwright. Owing to my nack of going straight to the root of the  matter in hand and substituting, before you can say Jack Robinson, a  truth for every fallacy and a natural law for every convention, the  scene of Snt George (Bernard Shaw)'s victory over the Turkish Knight  came out too short for theatrical purposes. I calculated that the play  as it stood would not occupy more than five hours in performance. I  therefore departed from the original scheme so far as to provide the  Turkish Knight with three attendant monsters, severally named the  Good, the Beyootiful, and the Ter-rew, and representing in themselves  the current forms of Religion, Art, and Science. These three Snt  George successively challenges, tackles, and flattens out--the first  as lunacy, the second as harlotry, the third as witchcraft. But even  so the play would not be long enough had I not padded a good deal of  buffoonery into the scene where the five corpses are brought back to  life.    The restorative Physician symbolises that irresistible force of human  stupidity by which the rottenest and basest institutions are enabled  to thrive in the teeth of the logic that has demolished them. Thus,  for the author, the close of the play is essentially tragic. But what  is death to him is fun to you, and my buffooneries wont offend any of  you. Bah!

Of a hospitable temper, she whose page  I am; but a great lady, over self-sure to be dudgeoned by wry faces in  the refectory. As for the little sister (if she did have finger in the  concoction)--no fear of offence there! I dare vow, who know somewhat  the fashion of her, she will but trill a pretty titter or so at your  qualms._      BENEDICTUS BENEDICAT.    I cry you mercy for a lacuna at the outset. I know not what had  knitted and blackened the brows of certain two speeding eastward  through London, enhansomed, on the night of the feast of St. Box:  _alter_, Geoffrey Dizzard, called \"The Honourable,\" _lieu-tenant_ in  the Guards of Edward the Peace Getter; _altera_, the Lady Angelica  Plantagenet, to him affianced. Devil take the cause of the bicker:  enough that they were at sulks. Here's for a sight of the girl!    Johannes Sargent, that swift giant from the New World, had already  flung her on canvas, with a brace of sisters. She outstands there, a  virgin poplar-tall; hair like ravelled flax and coiffed in the fashion  of the period; neck like a giraffe's; lips shaped for kissing rather  than smiling; eyes like a giraffe's again; breasts like a boy's, and  something of a dressed-up boy in the total aspect of her. She has  arms a trifle long even for such height as hers; fingers very long,  too, with red-pink nails trimmed to a point. She looks out slantwise,  conscious of her beauty, and perhaps of certain other things. Fire  under that ice, I conjecture--red corpuscles rampant behind that meek  white mask of hers. \"_Forsitan in hoc anno pulcherrima debutantium_\"  is the verdict of a contemporary journal. For \"_forsitan_\" read  \"_certe_.\" No slur, that, on the rest of the bevy.    Very much as Johannes had seen her did she appear now to the cits,  as the cabriolet swung past them. Paramount there, she was still more  paramount here. Yet this Geoffrey was not ill-looking. In the secret  journal of Mary Jane, serving-wench in the palace of Geoffrey's father  (who gat his barony by beer) note is made of his \"lovely blue eyes;  complexion like a blush rose; hands like a girl's; lips like a girl's  again; yellow curls close cropped; and for moustachio (so young is he  yet) such a shadow as amber might cast on water.\"    Here, had I my will, I would limn you Mary Jane herself, that parched  nymph. Time urges, though. The cabrioleteer thrashes his horse (me  with it) to a canter, and plunges into Soho. Some wagon athwart the  path gives pause. Angelica, looking about her, bites lip. For this  is the street of Wardour, wherein (say all the chronicles most  absolutely) she and Geoffrey had first met and plit their troth.    \"Methinks,\" cries she, loud and clear to the wagoner, and pointing  finger at Geoffrey, \"the Devil must be between your shafts, to make a  mock of me in this conjunction, the which is truly of his own doing.\"    \"Sweet madam,\" says Geoffrey (who was also called \"The Ready\"), \"shall  I help harness you at his side? Though, for my part, I doubt 'twere  supererogant, in that he buckled you to his service or ever the priest  dipped you.\"    A bitter jest, this; and the thought of it still tingled on the  girl's cheek and clawed her heart when Geoffrey handed her down at the  portico of Drury Lane Theatre. A new pantomime was afoot. Geoffrey's  father (that bluff red baron) had chartered a box, was already there  with his lady and others.    Lily among peonies, Angelica sat brooding, her eyes fastened on the  stage, Geoffrey behind her chair, brooding by the same token.  Presto, he saw a flood of pink rush up her shoulders to her ears. The  \"principal boy\" had just skipped on to the stage. No boy at all (God  be witness), but one Mistress Tina Vandeleur, very apt in masquerado,  and seeming true boy enough to the guileless. Stout of leg,  light-footed, with a tricksy plume to his cap, and the swagger of one  who would beard the Saints for a wager, this Aladdin was just such a  galliard as Angelica had often fondled in her dreams. He lept straight  into the closet of her heart, and \"Deus!\" she cried, \"maugre my  maidenhood, I will follow those pretty heels round the earth!\"    Cried Geoffrey \"Yea! and will not I presently string his ham to save  your panting?\"    \"_Tacete!_\" cried the groundlings.    A moment after, Geoffrey forgot his spleen. Cupid had noosed  him--bound him tight to the Widow Twankey. This was a woman most  unlike to Angelica: poplar-tall, I grant you; but elm-wide into the  bargain; deep-voiced, robustious, and puffed bravely out with hot  vital essences. Seemed so to Geoffrey, at least, who had no smattering  of theatres and knew not his cynosure to be none other than Master  Willie Joffers, prime buffo of the day. Like Angelica, he had had fond  visions; and lo here, the very lady of them!    Says he to Angelica, \"I am heartset on this widow.\"    \"By so much the better!\" she laughs. \"I to my peacock, you to your  peahen, with a Godspeed from each to other.\"    How to snare the birds? A pretty problem: the fowling was like to be  delicate. So hale a strutter as Aladdin could not lack for bonamies.  \"Will he deign me?\" wondered meek Angelica. \"This widow,\" thought  Geoffrey, \"is belike no widow at all, but a modest wife with a yea for  no man but her lord.\" Head to head they took counsel, cudgelled their  wits for some proper vantage. Of a sudden, Geoffrey clapped hand to  thigh. Student of Boccaccio, Heveletius, and other sages, he had the  clue in his palm. A whisper from him, a nod from Angelica, and the  twain withdrew from the box into the corridor without.    There, back to back, they disrobed swiftly, each tossing to other  every garment as it was doffed. Then a flurried toilet, and a  difficult, for the man especially; but hotness of desire breeds  dexterity. When they turned and faced each other, Angelica was such  a boy as Aladdin would not spurn as page, Geoffrey such a girl as the  widow might"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14672"],[0,"The Religion of the Ancient Celts (#15)"],[1,"-mother, and what may be a dim memory of Anu in  Leicestershire confirms this view. A cave on the Dane Hills is called  \"Black Annis' Bower,\" and she is said to have been a savage woman who  devoured human victims.[220] Earth-goddesses usually have human victims,  and Anu would be no exception. In the cult of Earth divinities Earth and  under-Earth are practically identical, while Earth-goddesses like  Demeter and Persephone were associated with the underworld, the dead  being Demeter's folk. The fruits of the earth with their roots below the  surface are then gifts of the earth- or under-earth goddess. This may  have been the case with Danu, for in Celtic belief the gifts of  civilisation came from the underworld or from the gods. Professor  Rh[^y]s finds the name Anu in the dat. _Anoniredi_, \"chariot of Anu,\" in  an inscription from Vaucluse, and the identification is perhaps  established by the fact that goddesses of fertility were drawn through  the fields in a vehicle.[221] Cormac also mentions Buanann as mother and  nurse of heroes, perhaps a goddess worshipped by heroes.[222]    Danu is also identified with Brigit, goddess of knowledge (_dan_),  perhaps through a folk-etymology. She was worshipped by poets, and had  two sisters of the same name connected with leechcraft and  smithwork.[223] They are duplicates or local forms of Brigit, a goddess  of culture and of poetry, so much loved by the Celts. She is thus the  equivalent of the Gaulish goddess equated with Minerva by Caesar, and  found on inscriptions as Minerva Belisama and Brigindo. She is the Dea  Brigantia of British inscriptions.[224] One of the seats of her worship  was the land of the Brigantes, of whom she was the eponymous goddess,  and her name (cf. Ir. _brig_, \"power\" or \"craft\"; Welsh _bri_, \"honour,\"  \"renown\") suggests her high functions. But her popularity is seen in the  continuation of her personality and cult in those of S. Brigit, at whose  shrine in Kildare a sacred fire, which must not be breathed on, or  approached by a male, was watched daily by nineteen nuns in turn, and on  the twentieth day by the saint herself.[225] Similar sacred fires were  kept up in other monasteries,[226] and they point to the old cult of a  goddess of fire, the nuns being successors of a virgin priesthood like  the vestals, priestesses of Vesta. As has been seen, the goddesses  Belisama and Sul, probably goddesses of fire, resembled Brigit in  this.[227] But Brigit, like Vesta, was at once a goddess of fire and of  fertility, as her connection with Candlemas and certain ritual survivals  also suggest. In the Hebrides on S. Bride's day (Candlemas-eve) women  dressed a sheaf of oats in female clothes and set it with a club in a  basket called \"Briid's bed.\" Then they called, \"Briid is come, Briid is  welcome.\" Or a bed was made of corn and hay with candles burning beside  it, and Bride was invited to come as her bed was ready. If the mark of  the club was seen in the ashes, this was an omen of a good harvest and a  prosperous year.[228] It is also noteworthy that if cattle cropped the  grass near S. Brigit's shrine, next day it was as luxuriant as ever.    Brigit, or goddesses with similar functions, was regarded by the Celts  as an early teacher of civilisation, inspirer of the artistic, poetic,  and mechanical faculties, as well as a goddess of fire and fertility. As  such she far excelled her sons, gods of knowledge. She must have  originated in the period when the Celts worshipped goddesses rather than  gods, and when knowledge--leechcraft, agriculture, inspiration--were  women's rather than men's. She had a female priesthood, and men were  perhaps excluded from her cult, as the tabued shrine at Kildare  suggests. Perhaps her fire was fed from sacred oak wood, for many  shrines of S. Brigit were built under oaks, doubtless displacing pagan  shrines of the goddess.[229] As a goddess, Brigit is more prominent than  Danu, also a goddess of fertility, even though Danu is mother of the  gods.    Other goddesses remembered in tradition are Cleena and Vera, celebrated  in fairy and witch lore, the former perhaps akin to a river-goddess  Clota, the Clutoida (a fountain-nymph) of the continental Celts; the  latter, under her alternative name Dirra, perhaps a form of a goddess of  Gaul, Dirona.[230] Aine, one of the great fairy-queens of Ireland, has  her seat at Knockainy in Limerick, where rites connected with her former  cult are still performed for fertility on Midsummer eve. If they were  neglected she and her troops performed them, according to local  legend.[231] She is thus an old goddess of fertility, whose cult, even  at a festival in which gods were latterly more prominent, is still  remembered. She is also associated with the waters as a water-nymph  captured for a time as a fairy-bride by the Earl of Desmond.[232] But  older legends connect her with the _sid_. She was daughter of Eogabal,  king of the _sid_ of Knockainy, the grass on which was annually  destroyed at Samhain by his people, because it had been taken from them,  its rightful owners. Oilill Olomm and Ferchus resolved to watch the  _sid_ on Samhain-eve. They saw Eogabal and Aine emerge from it. Ferchus  killed Eogabal, and Oilill tried to outrage Aine, who bit the flesh from  his ear. Hence his name of \"Bare Ear.\"[233] In this legend we see how  earlier gods of fertility come to be regarded as hostile to growth.  Another story tells of the love of Aillen, Eogabal's son, for Manannan's  wife and that of Aine for Manannan. Aine offered her favours to the god  if he would give his wife to her brother, and \"the complicated bit of  romance,\" as S. Patrick calls it, was thus arranged.[234]    Although the Irish gods are warriors, and there are special war-gods,  yet war-goddesses are more prominent, usually as a group of  three--Morrigan, Neman, and Macha. A fourth, Badb, sometimes takes the  place of one of these, or is identical with Morrigan, or her name, like  that of Morrigan, may be generic.[235] _Badb_ means \"a scald-crow,\"  under which form the war-goddesses appeared, probably because these  birds were seen near the slain. She is also called Badbcatha,  \"battle-Badb,\" and is thus the equivalent of _-athubodua,_ or, more  probably, _Cathubodua_, mentioned in an inscription from Haute-Savoie,  while this, as well as personal names like _Boduogenos_, shows that a  goddess Bodua was known to the Gauls.[236] The _badb_ or battle-crow is  associated with the Fomorian Tethra, but Badb herself is consort of a  war-god Net, one of the Tuatha De Danann, who may be the equivalent of  Neton, mentioned in Spanish inscriptions and equated with Mars.  Elsewhere Neman is Net's consort, and she may be the Nemetona of  inscriptions, e.g. at Bath, the consort of Mars. Cormac calls Net and  Neman \"a venomous couple,\" which we may well believe them to have  been.[237] To Macha were devoted the heads of slain enemies, \"Macha's  mast,\" but she, according to the annalists, was slain at Mag-tured,  though she reappears in the Cuchulainn saga as the Macha whose  ill-treatment led to the \"debility\" of the Ulstermen.[238] The name  Morrigan may mean \"great queen,\" though Dr. Stokes, connecting _mor_  with the same syllable in \"Fomorian,\" explains it as  \"nightmare-queen.\"[239] She works great harm to the Fomorians at  Mag-tured, and afterwards proclaims the victory to the hills, rivers,  and fairy-hosts, uttering also a prophecy of the evils to come at the  end of time.[240] She reappears prominently in the Cuchulainn saga,  hostile to the hero because he rejects her love, yet aiding the hosts of  Ulster and the Brown Bull, and in the end trying to prevent the hero's  death.[241]    The prominent position of these goddesses must be connected with the  fact that women went out to war--a custom said to have been stopped by  Adamnan at his mother's request, and that many prominent heroines of the  heroic cycles are warriors, like the British Boudicca, whose name may be  connected with _boudi_, \"victory.\" Specific titles were given to such  classes of female warriors--_bangaisgedaig_, _banfeinnidi_, etc.[242]  But it is possible that these goddesses were at first connected with  fertility, their functions changing with the growing warlike tendencies  of the Celts. Their number recalls that of the threefold _Matres_, and  possibly the change in their character is hinted in the Romano-British  inscription at Benwell to the _Lamiis Tribus_, since Morrigan's name is  glossed _lamia_.[243] She is also identified with Anu, and is mistress  of Dagda, an Earth-god, and with Badb and others expels the Fomorians  when they destroyed the agricultural produce of Ireland.[244] Probably  the scald-crow was at once the symbol and the incarnation of the  war-goddesses, who resemble the Norse Valkyries, appearing sometimes as  crows, and the Greek Keres, bird-like beings which drank the blood of  the slain. It is also interesting to note that Badb, who has the  character of a prophetess of evil, is often identified with the \"Washer  at the Ford,\" whose presence indicates death to him whose armour or  garments she seems to cleanse.[245]    The _Matres_, goddesses of fertility, do not appear by name in Ireland,  but the triplication of such goddesses as Morrigan and Brigit, the  threefold name of Dagda's wife, or the fact that Arm, Danu, and Buanan  are called \"mothers,\" while Buanan's name is sometimes rendered \"good  mother,\" may suggest that such grouped goddesses were not unknown. Later  legend knows of white women who assist in spinning, or three hags with  power over nature, or, as in the _Battle of Ventry_, of three  supernatural women who fall in love with Conncrithir, aid him in fight,  and heal his wounds. In this document and elsewhere is mentioned the  \"_sid_ of the White Women.\"[246] Goddesses of fertility are usually  goddesses of love, and the prominence given to females among the _side_,  the fact that they are"]]]
