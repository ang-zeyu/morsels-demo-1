You've got a bad start already, Duane, and if I  know this border you'll never be a respectable citizen again. You're  a born killer. I know every bad man on this frontier. More than one of  them have told me that something exploded in their brain, and when sense  came back there lay another dead man. It's not so with me. I've done a  little shooting, too, but I never wanted to kill another man just to  rid myself of the last one. My dead men don't sit on my chest at night.  That's the gun-fighter's trouble. He's crazy. He has to kill a new  man--he's driven to it to forget the last one.\"    \"But I'm no gun-fighter,\" protested Duane. \"Circumstances made me--\"    \"No doubt,\" interrupted Bland, with a laugh. \"Circumstances made me a  rustler. You don't know yourself. You're young; you've got a temper;  your father was one of the most dangerous men Texas ever had. I don't  see any other career for you. Instead of going it alone--a lone wolf,  as the Texans say--why not make friends with other outlaws? You'll live  longer.\"    Euchre squirmed in his seat.    \"Boss, I've been givin' the boy egzactly thet same line of talk. Thet's  why I took him in to bunk with me. If he makes pards among us there  won't be any more trouble. An' he'd be a grand feller fer the gang. I've  seen Wild Bill Hickok throw a gun, an' Billy the Kid, an' Hardin, an'  Chess here--all the fastest men on the border. An' with apologies to  present company, I'm here to say Duane has them all skinned. His draw is  different. You can't see how he does it.\"    Euchre's admiring praise served to create an effective little silence.  Alloway shifted uneasily on his feet, his spurs jangling faintly, and  did not lift his head. Bland seemed thoughtful.    \"That's about the only qualification I have to make me eligible for your  band,\" said Duane, easily.    \"It's good enough,\" replied Bland, shortly. \"Will you consider the  idea?\"    \"I'll think it over. Good night.\"    He left the group, followed by Euchre. When they reached the end of the  lane, and before they had exchanged a word, Bland called Euchre back.  Duane proceeded slowly along the moonlit road to the cabin and sat down  under the cottonwoods to wait for Euchre. The night was intense and  quiet, a low hum of insects giving the effect of a congestion of life.  The beauty of the soaring moon, the ebony canons of shadow under the  mountain, the melancholy serenity of the perfect night, made Duane  shudder in the realization of how far aloof he now was from enjoyment of  these things. Never again so long as he lived could he be natural. His  mind was clouded. His eye and ear henceforth must register impressions  of nature, but the joy of them had fled.    Still, as he sat there with a foreboding of more and darker work ahead  of him there was yet a strange sweetness left to him, and it lay in  thought of Jennie. The pressure of her cold little hands lingered in  his. He did not think of her as a woman, and he did not analyze his  feelings. He just had vague, dreamy thoughts and imaginations that were  interspersed in the constant and stern revolving of plans to save her.    A shuffling step roused him. Euchre's dark figure came crossing the  moonlit grass under the cottonwoods. The moment the outlaw reached  him Duane saw that he was laboring under great excitement. It scarcely  affected Duane. He seemed to be acquiring patience, calmness, strength.    \"Bland kept you pretty long,\" he said.    \"Wait till I git my breath,\" replied Euchre. He sat silent a little  while, fanning himself with a sombrero, though the night was cool, and  then he went into the cabin to return presently with a lighted pipe.    \"Fine night,\" he said; and his tone further acquainted Duane with  Euchre's quaint humor. \"Fine night for love-affairs, by gum!\"    \"I'd noticed that,\" rejoined Duane, dryly.    \"Wal, I'm a son of a gun if I didn't stand an' watch Bland choke his  wife till her tongue stuck out an' she got black in the face.\"    \"No!\" ejaculated Duane.    \"Hope to die if I didn't. Buck, listen to this here yarn. When I got  back to the porch I seen Bland was wakin' up. He'd been too fagged out  to figger much. Alloway an' Kate had gone in the house, where they lit  up the lamps. I heard Kate's high voice, but Alloway never chirped. He's  not the talkin' kind, an' he's damn dangerous when he's thet way. Bland  asked me some questions right from the shoulder. I was ready for them,  an' I swore the moon was green cheese. He was satisfied. Bland always  trusted me, an' liked me, too, I reckon. I hated to lie black thet  way. But he's a hard man with bad intentions toward Jennie, an' I'd  double-cross him any day.    \"Then we went into the house. Jennie had gone to her little room,  an' Bland called her to come out. She said she was undressin'. An' he  ordered her to put her clothes back on. Then, Buck, his next move was  some surprisin'. He deliberately thronged a gun on Kate. Yes sir, he  pointed his big blue Colt right at her, an' he says:    \"'I've a mind to blow out your brains.'    \"'Go ahead,' says Kate, cool as could be.    \"'You lied to me,' he roars.    \"Kate laughed in his face. Bland slammed the gun down an' made a grab  fer her. She fought him, but wasn't a match fer him, an' he got her by  the throat. He choked her till I thought she was strangled. Alloway made  him stop. She flopped down on the bed an' gasped fer a while. When she  come to them hardshelled cusses went after her, trying to make her give  herself away. I think Bland was jealous. He suspected she'd got thick  with you an' was foolin' him. I reckon thet's a sore feelin' fer a man  to have--to guess pretty nice, but not to BE sure. Bland gave it up  after a while. An' then he cussed an' raved at her. One sayin' of his is  worth pinnin' in your sombrero: 'It ain't nuthin' to kill a man. I don't  need much fer thet. But I want to KNOW, you hussy!'    \"Then he went in an' dragged poor Jen out. She'd had time to dress. He  was so mad he hurt her sore leg. You know Jen got thet injury fightin'  off one of them devils in the dark. An' when I seen Bland twist  her--hurt her--I had a queer hot feelin' deep down in me, an' fer the  only time in my life I wished I was a gun-fighter.    \"Wal, Jen amazed me. She was whiter'n a sheet, an' her eyes were big and  stary, but she had nerve. Fust time I ever seen her show any.    \"'Jennie,' he said, 'my wife said Duane came here to see you. I believe  she's lyin'. I think she's been carryin' on with him, an' I want to  KNOW. If she's been an' you tell me the truth I'll let you go. I'll send  you out to Huntsville, where you can communicate with your friends. I'll  give you money.'    \"Thet must hev been a hell of a minnit fer Kate Bland. If evet I seen  death in a man's eye I seen it in Bland's. He loves her. Thet's the  strange part of it.    \"'Has Duane been comin' here to see my wife?' Bland asked, fierce-like.    \"'No,' said Jennie.    \"'He's been after you?'    \"'Yes.'    \"'He has fallen in love with you? Kate said thet.'    \"'I--I'm not--I don't know--he hasn't told me.'    \"'But you're in love with him?'    \"'Yes,' she said; an', Buck, if you only could have seen her! She  thronged up her head, an' her eyes were full of fire. Bland seemed dazed  at sight of her. An' Alloway, why, thet little skunk of an outlaw cried  right out. He was hit plumb center. He's in love with Jen. An' the look  of her then was enough to make any feller quit. He jest slunk out of the  room. I told you, mebbe, thet he'd been tryin' to git Bland to marry Jen  to him. So even a tough like Alloway can love a woman!    \"Bland stamped up an' down the room. He sure was dyin' hard.    \"'Jennie,' he said, once more turnin' to her. 'You swear in fear of your  life thet you're tellin' truth. Kate's not in love with Duane? She's let  him come to see you? There's been nuthin' between them?'    \"'No. I swear,' answered Jennie; an' Bland sat down like a man licked.    \"'Go to bed, you white-faced--' Bland choked on some word or other--a  bad one, I reckon--an' he positively shook in his chair.    \"Jennie went then, an' Kate began to have hysterics. An' your Uncle  Euchre ducked his nut out of the door an' come home.\"    Duane did not have a word to say at the end of Euchre's long harangue.  He experienced relief. As a matter of fact, he had expected a good deal  worse. He thrilled at the thought of Jennie perjuring herself to save  that abandoned woman. What mysteries these feminine creatures were!    \"Wal, there's where our little deal stands now,\" resumed Euchre,  meditatively. \"You know, Buck, as well as me thet if you'd been some  feller who hadn't shown he was a wonder with a gun you'd now be full of  lead. If you'd happen to kill Bland an' Alloway, I reckon you'd be as  safe on this here border as you would in Santone. Such is gun fame in  this land of the draw.\"        CHAPTER IX    Both men were awake early, silent with the premonition of trouble ahead,  thoughtful of the fact that the time for the long-planned action was at  hand. It was remarkable that a man as loquacious as Euchre could hold  his tongue so long; and this was significant of the deadly nature of  the intended deed. During breakfast he said a few words customary in the  service of food. At the conclusion of the meal he seemed to come to an  end of deliberation.    \"Buck, the sooner the better now,\" he declared, with a glint in his eye.  \"The more time we use up now the less surprised Bland'll be.\"    \"I'm ready when you are,\" replied Duane, quietly, and he rose from the  table.    \"Wal, saddle up, then,\" went on Euchre, gruffly. \"Tie on them two packs  I made, one fer each saddle. You can't tell--mebbe either hoss will be  carryin' double. It's good they're both big, strong hosses. Guess thet  wasn't a wise move of your Uncle Euchre's--bringin' in your hosses an'  havin' them ready?\"    \"Euchre, I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10317"],[0,"Betty Gordon at Boarding School; Or, The Treasure of Indian Chasm (#15)"],[1,"their bus at the athletic field where several cars were drawn  up on the sidelines.    \"Then she shall have my fur coat and my best curly chrysanthemum,\"  announced Tommy Tucker gallantly, throwing a handsome raccoon fur coat  over Norma's shoulders and presenting her with a magnificent yellow  chrysanthemum.          CHAPTER XVI    THE NUTTING PARTY      To the boy's surprise Bobby, who was usually aloof and liked to tease  him, squeezed his arm surreptitiously.    \"You're a dear!\" she told him enthusiastically.    \"Girls are a queer lot,\" the dazed youth confided to Bob, as they went  back to their quarters. \"Here I handed over my coat to that Norma Guerin  and gave her the flower I'd been saving for Bobby, just to pay Bobby back  for being so snippy to me over at school. And she calls me a dear and is  nicer to me than she's been in months!\"    Bob briefly outlined something of the Guerin history, for Betty had told  him of the lost treasure in her hurried note, and hinted his belief that  the girls had very little money in comparison to Shadyside standards.    \"Shucks--money isn't anything!\" was Tommy's answer to the recital, with  the easy assurance of a person who has never been without a comfortable  competence. \"They're nice girls, and we'll pass the word that the boys  are to show them a good time.\"    As a result, when after the conclusion of the game, the girls and Miss  Anderson were ushered upstairs into the cozy suite of rooms the cadets  occupied, Norma and Alice found themselves plied with attentions. Miss  Anderson poured the hot chocolate and made friends with the shy Sydney  Cooke, who had been dreading this visit all the afternoon. Indeed his  chums had threatened to lock him in the clothes closet in order that they  might be sure of his attendance.    Winifred Marion Brown, in addition to his ability as a checker player,  was a good pianist, and he obligingly played for them to dance. The piano  belonged to the Tucker twins. Norma and Alice were \"rushed\" with  partners, and they quite forgot their clothes in the enjoyment of dancing  to irresistible music.    Libbie had brought a book of poems for Timothy Derby, who solemnly loaned  her one of his in exchange. This odd pair remained impervious to all  criticisms, and certainly many of those voiced were frank to the point of  painfulness.    \"But their natures can not understand the lyric appeal,\" said Libbie  sadly. Her English teacher moaned over her spelling and rejoiced in  her themes.    Finally Miss Anderson insisted they must go, and the bouquet of flowers  on the tea table was plucked apart to reveal nine little individual  bouquets, one for each guest.    \"Good-bye, and thank you for a lovely party,\" said Miss Anderson gaily.    \"Do you know?\" blurted Teddy Tucker, \"you're my idea of a chaperone! Most  of 'em are such dubs and kill-joys!\"    Which tactful speech proved to be the best Teddy could have made.    A week of small pleasures and hard study followed this \"glorious Friday  afternoon.\"    Bobby, for a wonder, remembered her promise of good behavior, and by  herculean effort managed to be on the \"starred\" list for the Saturday set  aside for the nutting expedition.    \"We'll go after lunch,\" planned Betty. \"Miss Anderson says if we strike  off toward the woods at the back of the school we ought to come to a  grove of hickory nut trees.\"    The eight girls, ready for their tramp, came in to lunch attired in heavy  wool skirts and stout shoes and carried their sweaters. Ada Nansen  glanced complacently at her own suede pumps and silk stockings.    \"It's hard to tell which is really the farmer's daughter to-day,\" she  drawled. \"Perhaps we all ought to assume that uniform out of kindness.\"    Ada sat at the table directly behind Norma, and not a girl at either  table could possibly miss the significance of her remarks. Their import,  it developed, had been plain to Miss Lacey who, on her way to her own  table, had overheard. Miss Lacey was a quiet, rather drab little woman,  misleading in her effacement of self. She knew more about her pupils than  they often suspected.    \"Ada,\" she said quietly, stopping by the girl, \"you may leave the table.  If you will persist in acting like a naughty little six year old girl,  you must be treated as one.\"    Ada flounced out of her chair and from the room. Her departure created a  ripple of curiosity. It was most unusual for a girl to be dismissed from  table, and had Ada only known it, she had drawn the attention of the  whole school to herself.    Miss Lacey went on to her seat, without a glance at the flushed faces of  Norma and Alice.    \"Some day,\" said Bobby furiously, \"I'm going to throw a plate at  that girl!\"    \"No, you're not,\" contradicted Betty. \"Then Mrs. Eustice would rise up  and send you from the room and you'd feel about half the size Ada does  now. For mercy's sake, don't descend to anybody's level--make 'em come up  to fight on yours.\"    They were all glad to get through the meal and find themselves outdoors.  It was a perfect autumn day, warm and hazy, and the red and gold of the  leaves showed burnished from the hillside. They tramped rather silently  at first, and then, as the tense mood wore off, their tongues were  loosened and they chattered like magpies.    \"Here's a tree!\" shouted Louise and Frances, who were in the lead.    When they had picked all the nuts on the ground, Bobby essayed to climb  the tree. She made rather sad work of the effort, for a shag-bark  hickory is not the easiest tree in the world to climb, and after she had  torn her skirt in two places and mended it with safety pins, she gave up  the attempt.    \"Let's walk further,\" she suggested. \"We'll mark our trail as we go like  the Indians.\"    This idea caught the fancy of the girls, and they marked an elaborate  trail, building little mounds at every turn and leaving odd arrangements  of stones to mark their passing.    \"Come on, I'll race you,\" shouted Bobby suddenly. \"I feel just like  exercising.\"    Betty wondered what she called the scramble through the woods, but she,  too, was ready for a run. They set off pellmell, laughing and shouting.    \"Look out!\" shrieked Betty, stopping so suddenly that Libbie and Louise  fell against her. \"Look! I almost ran right into it!\"    She pointed ahead to where the ground fell away abruptly. A great chasm,  like an angry scar, was cut through the earth, and on the side opposite  to the girls a steep hill came down in an uncompromising slant.    \"What a dandy hill for coasting!\" ejaculated Bobby. \"Let's come up here  this winter. We can steer away from this hole.\"    \"That's no hole,\" said Norma Guerin, in an odd voice. \"That's Indian  Chasm. And it's miles long.\"    Betty stared at her. She had thought Indian Chasm many miles away.    \"I didn't realize we had walked so far,\" said Norma, apparently reading  her thoughts. \"But I know I am right. Here are the woods and the steep  hill, just as grandma has described them a hundred times. This is  Indian Chasm.\"    The girls looked at her curiously. Betty had not told them the story,  believing that Alice and Norma should have that sole right. Now Norma  rapidly sketched the outlines for them and they listened breathlessly,  for surely this true story was more thrilling than any piece of fiction,  however highly colored.    \"I never heard of anything so romantic!\" was Libbie's comment.    To which Bobby retorted with cousinly severity:    \"Romantic? Where do you see anything romantic in a band of Indians  scalping a peaceful white family?\"    \"Oh, Bobby!\" protested Norma, laughing. \"They didn't scalp grandma. They  stole everything she had.\"    \"And is all that stuff down there now?\" asked Constance Howard,  round-eyed. \"Perhaps if we look we can see something.\"    There was a concerted rush to the chasm's edge, and the eight girls  plumped down flat on their stomachs, determined to see whatever there was  to be seen.    The sides of the earth fell away sharply, down, down. Betty shouted, and  the empty echo of her voice came back to her.    \"The ground's so shaly and crumbly,\" she said thoughtfully, \"that it  would be impossible to let a man down with a rope--the earth would cave  in and bury him.\"    \"I think I see a diamond,\" reported Libbie. \"Don't you see something  glittering down there?\"    \"Can't even see the bottom,\" said Bobby curtly. \"Much less a diamond. Oh,  girls, to think of those valuables at the bottom of a chasm like this  and none of us able to think up a way to get 'em out.\"    \"Well, lots of people have tried,\" said Alice reasonably. \"If grown-up  men couldn't salvage 'em for grandma, I guess it's nothing to our  discredit that we can't get them.\"    \"We might push Libbie in,\" suggested Bobby wickedly. \"Then she could tell  us how deep it is.\"    This had the effect of sending Libbie scurrying away from the  dangerous place, and the others followed her more slowly to resume the  search for nuts.    \"I wish we could think of a way, Norma, dear,\" said Betty.    \"Oh, I don't care--not so very much,\" answered Norma bravely. But then  she sighed deeply.          CHAPTER XVII    CAUGHT IN THE STORM      The Shadyside gymnasium was equipped with a fine pool, and it was the  school's boast that every girl learned to swim during her first term.  Perhaps the proximity of the lake and the lure of the small fleet of  canoes and rowboats tied up at the wharf had something to do with the  success of the swimming classes. No girl who could not swim was permitted  on the lake, alone or with a companion.    Betty and her chums awaited their final tests eagerly--so excited the  last day or two they could scarcely keep their minds on their books or  sit in patience through a recitation--and passed them with flying colors.  Constance Howard was an excellent swimmer, and it was the sight of her  paddling gracefully about the lake on sunny Saturday afternoons that  spurred the seven who could not swim "]]]
