This  was done at the request of the newspaper management,  and the staff apparently appreciated the move. Yet, on  his return, and probably realising that churning out  this many pieces -- that too, all on issues related to  Goa -- could be done by someone else too, Rajan went on  to write his editorial which claimed \"friends in Goa and  Bombay are eager to bury me...\" . Or something to that  effect. The \"friend' in Bombay was, one guesses, Alwyn  Fernandes, a former Times of India journalist, who at  one stage was actively considering taking over the  editorship of the Herald.    (At a later tenure, after the Herald faced a crisis  when chief reporter Julio Da Silva suddenly opted for  contesting an assembly election on a BJP ticket, rather  than staying on in journalism. Since one had turned to  freelancing, contributing to a local daily sounded a  good idea. This continued for some time, till, again,  Rajan Narayan's return resulted in getting the feeling  of being unwanted.)    At the end of the day -- though nobody should try to  write a premature obit for his influence on Goan  journalism -- Rajan will probably be known for what he  has written. Not for what he made sure didn't surface.  In this context, it is perhaps important to put down  these perspectives on the record, so that the future  could have other views from which to judge contemporary  journalism in Goa.      Chapter 8:  Rural Goa, unheard, unsung...    Melvyn S. MisquitaMelvyn S Misquita represents a trend among some of the  younger journalists -- well-educated (he holds two M.A.  degrees), Net-savvy, and eager to extend the boundaries  of journalism in Goa should be looking at, apart from  just the Secretariat. Recently, his work made it to the  news in a major way, when the Indian Express carried a  large spread in its national-edition on how Misquita  had traced the strange story of the sinking of a World  War II British passenger liner, BritanniaIII, which had  dozens of Goans (including one of Misquita's  grand-uncle's) on board.    If my entry into journalism was accidental, working  with rural correspondents in Goa was equally  unexpected. One morning of May 1998, then editor of the  Gomantak Times, Ashwin Tombat, asked me to handle local  correspondents who were contributing to the newspaper.  He assured me that correspondents were an integral part  of the newspaper and, that, a strong network would play  a vital role in strengthening the newspaper.    While Tombat's ability to put forth persuasive  arguments eventually convinced me to accept this task,  I was determined not to remain 'stuck' with  correspondents for long. There were many reasons for  this. Firstly, working with correspondents invariably  meant that one would end up merely re-writing their  stories and would not have much time to work on my own  stories. And with barely two years of journalism under  my belt, there was no way I would allow my ambition be  condemned to the mere restoration of correspondents'  news items.    Secondly, co-ordinating with correspondents involved  vast amounts of patience, as each correspondent had to  be handled differently. Moreover, since most were  part-time correspondents and could devote only a few  hours to the profession, I could only expect them to  function for a brief part of the day. Then again, these  correspondents were based in different parts of the  state and my interaction with them was largely  dependent on telephones and other means of remote communication.    The correspondents were certainly happy to have me  around, as till then their complaints seemed endless.  \"Our stories don't appear promptly in the newspaper  and, sometimes, they don't appear at all. People in our  locality then get upset and complain that we are not  sending in their stories,\" was a commonly echoed  grievance. \"No one attends to our telephone calls and,  when they do, they keep transferring our calls from one  person to another and they finally disconnect the  phone,\" was another general complaint.    Their complaints certainly had some degree of  legitimacy.    It is a common perception -- especially among  English-language newspapers in the state -- that correspondents   are third-class passengers, who deserve little or no  decent treatment. Let me cite two instances to prove  this point. In one English-language newspaper, a  correspondent sent me a crime report, which, under  normal circumstances, should have been carried the next  day. To my surprise, the report was not published for  the next two days. The correspondent called me and  sought an explanation for the delay. Unable to give him  a suitable reply, I transferred the call to the  concerned sub-editor, who simply snapped back and  insisted that the correspondent need not bother about  his report and, that, the report would appear only when  there space was available in the paper!    Some time ago, a Vasco-based couple died in a road  mishap in Porvorim and the correspondent promptly sent  in the report. The next morning, I was taken aback to  find the item in a single column, virtually hidden in  the section for continued items on Page 4.  Incidentally, the distribution of saplings by an MLA  not only merited a double-column spread, but also a  decent photograph -- ironically, just alongside the  news item reporting the tragic deaths. The sub-editor's  reply, like his news sense, left me baffled. \"So what?  So many people die almost everyday. What was so special  about these deaths?\" Unfortunately, the sub-editor  failed to acknowledge the fact that the same news item  was prominently displayed in the other two  English-language newspapers.    A former colleague once aptly described such an  attitude as \"'news sense' value which gets transformed  into 'nuisance value'.\"    In most cases, those serving on the news desk in  English-language papers have never worked as rural  correspondents and are, hence, unable, or in some cases  unwilling, to understand the intricacies of collecting  and sending news items. Confined to the four walls of  the newspaper office, some members of the news desk  play a role similar to that of a cook in the kitchen;  while rural correspondents are the waiters who have to  constantly interact either with an unhappy customer or,  in some cases, a satisfied customer. The news desk  essentially plays a vital role in the making or  breaking of a story sent by rural correspondents.    But then, the news desk is faced with pressures of a  different kind, which are not always understood by  rural correspondents, based as they are in remote  corners of Goa, who rarely witnessed the hectic  activity at the news desk, moments before the deadline.  On numerous occasions, news items placed on the page  had to be removed at the last moment to accommodate  late advertisements. As such, rural reports, no matter  how essential, simply couldn't find the space in newspaper.    Moreover, many correspondents are convinced that their  news items are more important than the others, so much  so that they cannot bear to find their reports delayed  even by a day. Quite often, their unhappiness over the  delay in printing their reports would become more vocal  with each passing day and, invariably, I became their  punching bag. This was largely because some of the  rural correspondents are considered important members  of the public in their locality and, at times, their  prestige and financial gains in journalism would often  be at stake with a delayed publication of their reports.    It must be admitted that over the years, journalism has  been turned into a prestigious and lucrative part-time  option for many of the rural correspondents. A few  years ago, a former editor mentioned to me that he was  on a trip to a remote village in Goa, when he decided  to attend a function in the locality. The place was  packed to capacity and he was forced to stand behind  occupied chairs. To his surprise, the chief guest  happened to be the local correspondent of his own newspaper!    This enthusiasm towards 'extra-curricular' activities  sometimes translates into political affiliation. In a  recent event which established the BJP-journo nexus in  Sanguem, a correspondent with a Marathi newspaper and  member of the Sanguem Patrakar Sangh was been  unanimously elected president of the Sanguem Unit of  the BJP. Similarly, the president of the Sanguem  Patrakar Sangh and a correspondent with an  English-language newspaper, was appointed the BJP booth  president of Tarimol-Sanguem. In most cases, reports  sent by correspondents to the news desk, in the past,  specially when there was no one in particular to look  after this responsibility, simply lacked form and  content. Illegible words either scribbled on scraps of  paper or sent as distorted faxed messages were among  the most popular methods deployed to communicate their  reports. In some cases, only a skilled pharmacist could  decipher the words used by some correspondents. Under  such conditions, the sub-editor assigned to such  reports had the arduous task of converting them into  decent stories. Quite often, the easiest way out would  be to forward the raw report to the dust bin. A  sub-editor flooded with such reports and working under  pressure would invariably exercise this option with  considerable frequency.    Then in June 1998, it was my turn to handle the  correspondent network under the fancy and wordy  designation of \"Chief of News Bureau\". In reality, I  had to play God in the laboratory. This meant  subjecting numerous correspondent reports to various  quality control tests each day and, in some cases,  creating sense from nonsense, before they were ready to  be read by thousands of readers in and around Goa.  Under such circumstances, I had anticipated that my  association with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11533"],[0,"Theocritus, translated into English Verse (#15)"],[1,"ome,      What gaps were in his harness time had made.      Then with couched lance to reach the foe, his targe      Covering his rear, and bide the biting sword;      Or, on the warpath, place his ambuscade,      Marshal his lines and rally his cavaliers;      This knightly Castor learned him, erst exiled      From Argos, when her realms with all their wealth      Of vineyards fell to Tydeus, who received      Her and her chariots at Adrastus' hand.      Amongst the Heroes none was Castor's match      Till age had dimmed the glory of his youth.        Such tutors this fond mother gave her son.      The stripling's bed was at his father's side,      One after his own heart, a lion's skin.      His dinner, roast meat, with a loaf that filled      A Dorian basket, you might soothly say      Had satisfied a delver; and to close      The day he took, sans fire, a scanty meal.      A simple frock went halfway down his leg:           *       *       *       *       *          IDYLL XXV.      Heracles the Lion Slayer.           *       *       *       *       *          To whom thus spake the herdsman of the herd,      Pausing a moment from his handiwork:      \"Friend, I will solve thy questions, for I fear      The angry looks of Hermes of the roads.      No dweller in the skies is wroth as he,      With him who saith the asking traveller nay.          \"The flocks Augeas owns, our gracious lord,      One pasture pastures not, nor one fence bounds.      They wander, look you, some by Elissus' banks      Or god-beloved Alpheus' sacred stream,      Some by Buprasion, where the grape abounds,      Some here: their folds stand separate. But before      His herds, though they be myriad, yonder glades      That belt the broad lake round lie fresh and fair      For ever: for the low-lying meadows take      The dew, and teem with herbage honeysweet,      To lend new vigour to the horned kine.      Here on thy right their stalls thou canst descry      By the flowing river, for all eyes to see:      Here, where the platans blossom all the year,      And glimmers green the olive that enshrines      Rural Apollo, most august of gods.      Hard by, fair mansions have been reared for us      His herdsmen; us who guard with might and main      His riches that are more than tongue may tell:      Casting our seed o'er fallows thrice upturn'd      Or four times by the share; the bounds whereof      Well do the delvers know, whose busy feet      Troop to his wine-vats in fair summer-time.      Yea, all these acres wise Augeas owns,      These corn-clad uplands and these orchards green,      Far as yon ledges whence the cataracts leap.      Here do we haunt, here toil, as is the wont      Of labourers in the fields, the livelong day.      But prythee tell me thou--so shalt thou best      Serve thine own interests--wherefore art thou here?      Seeking Augeas, or mayhap some slave      That serves him? I can tell thee and I will      All thou would'st know: for of no churlish blood      Thou earnest, nor wert nurtured as a churl:      That read I in thy stateliness of form;      The sons of heaven move thus among mankind.\"        Then answered him the warrior son of Zeus.      \"Yea, veteran, I would see the Epean King      Augeas; surely for this end I came.      If he bides there amongst his citizens,      Ruling the folk, determining the laws,      Look, father; bid some serf to be my guide,      Some honoured master-worker in the fields,      Who to shrewd questions shrewdly can reply.      Are not we made dependent each on each?\"          To him the good old swain made answer thus:      \"Stranger, some god hath timed thy visit here,      And given thee straightway all thy heart's desire.      Hither Augeas, offspring of the Sun,      Came, with young Phyleus splendid in his strength,      But yesterday from the city, to review      (Not in one day) his multitudinous wealth,      Methinks e'en princes say within themselves,      'The safeguard of the flock's the master's eye.'      But haste, we'll seek him: to my own fold I      Will pilot thee; there haply find the King.\"          He said and went in front: but pondered much      (As he surveyed the lion-skin and the club,      Itself an armful) whence this stranger came;      And fain had asked. But fear recalled the words      That trembled on his lip, the fear to say      Aught that his fiery friend might take amiss.      For who can fathom all his fellow's mind?          The dogs perceived their coming, yet far off:      They scented flesh, they heard the thud of feet:      And with wild gallop, baying furiously,      Ran at Amphitryon's son: but feebly whined      And fawned upon the old man at his side.      Then Heracles, just lifting from the ground      A pebble, scared them home, and with hard words      Cursed the whole pack; and having stopped their din      (Inly rejoiced, nathless, to see them guard      So well an absent master's house) he spake:          \"Lo! what a friend the royal gods have given      Man in the dog! A trusty servant he!      Had he withal an understanding heart,      To teach him when to rage and when forbear,      What brute could claim like praise? But, lacking wit,      'Tis but a passionate random-raving thing.\"          He spake: the dogs ran scurrying to their lairs.      And now the sun wheeled round his westering car      And led still evening on: from every field      Came thronging the fat flocks to bield and byre.      Then in their thousands, drove on drove, the kine      Came into view; as rainclouds, onward driven      By stress of gales, the west or mighty north,      Come up o'er all the heaven; and none may count      And naught may stay them as they sweep through air;      Such multitudes the storm's strength drives ahead,      Such multitudes climb surging in the rear--      So in swift sequence drove succeeded drove,      And all the champaign, all the highways swarmed      With tramping oxen; all the sumptuous leas      Rang with their lowing. Soon enough the stalls      Were populous with the laggard-footed kine,      Soon did the sheep lie folded in their folds.      Then of that legion none stood idle, none      Gaped listless at the herd, with naught to do:      But one drew near and milked them, binding clogs      Of wood with leathern thongs around their feet:      One brought, all hungering for the milk they loved,      The longing young ones to the longing dams.      One held the pail, one pressed the dainty cheese,      Or drove the bulls home, sundered from the kine.      Pacing from stall to stall, Augeas saw      What revenue his herdsman brought him in.      With him his son surveyed the royal wealth,      And, strong of limb and purpose, Heracles.      Then, though the heart within him was as steel,      Framed to withstand all shocks, Amphitryon's son      Gazed in amazement on those thronging kine;      For none had deemed or dreamed that one, or ten,      Whose wealth was more than regal, owned those tribes:      Such huge largess the Sun had given his child,      First of mankind for multitude of flocks.      The Sun himself gave increase day by day      To his child's herds: whatever diseases spoil      The farmer, came not there; his kine increased      In multitude and value year by year:      None cast her young, or bare unfruitful males.      Three hundred bulls, white-pasterned, crumple-horned,      Ranged amid these, and eke two hundred roans,      Sires of a race to be: and twelve besides      Herded amongst them, sacred to the Sun.      Their skin was white as swansdown, and they moved      Like kings amid the beasts of laggard foot.      Scorning the herd in uttermost disdain      They cropped the green grass in untrodden fields:      And when from the dense jungle to the plain      Leapt a wild beast, in quest of vagrant cows;      Scenting him first, the twelve went forth to war.      Stern was their bellowing, in their eye sat death,      Foremost of all for mettle and for might      And pride of heart loomed Phaeton: him the swains      Regarded as a star; so bright he shone      Among the herd, the cynosure of eyes.      He, soon as he descried the sun-dried skin      Of the grim lion, made at Heracles      (Whose eye was on him)--fain to make his crest      And sturdy brow acquainted with his flanks.      Straight the prince grasped him with no tender grasp      By the left horn, and bowed that giant bulk      To earth, neck foremost: then, by pressure brought      To bear upon his shoulder, forced him back.      The web of muscles that enwraps the nerves      Stood out from the brute's fore-arm plain to see.      Marvelled the King, and Phyleus his brave son,      At the strange prowess of Amphitryon's child.          Then townwards, leaving straight that rich champaign,      Stout Heracles his comrade, Phyleus fared;      And soon as they had gained the paven road,      Making their way hotfooted o'er a path      (Not o'er-conspicuous in the dim green wood)      That left the farm and threaded through the vines,      Out-spake unto the child of Zeus most high,      Who followed in his steps, Augeas' son,      O'er his right shoulder glancing pleasantly.          \"O stranger, as some old familiar tale      I seem to cast thy history in my mind.      For there came one to Argos, young and tall,      By birth a Greek from Helice-on-seas,      Who told this tale before a multitude:      How that an Argive in his presence slew      A fearful lion-beast, the dread and death      Of herdsmen; which inhabited a den      Or cavern by the grove of Nemean Zeus.      He may have come from sacred Argos' self,      Or Tiryns, or Mycenae: what know I?      But thus he told his tale, and said the slayer      Was (if my memory serves me) Perseus' son.      Methinks no islander had dared that deed      Save thee: the lion's skin that wraps thy ribs      Argues full well some gallant feat of arms.      But"]]]
