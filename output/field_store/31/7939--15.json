Perchance my love, amid the childish band,  Grateful for gifts the Holy Christmas gave her,  Here meekly kissed the grandsire's withered hand.  I feel, O maid! thy very soul  Of order and content around me whisper,--  Which leads thee with its motherly control,  The cloth upon thy board bids smoothly thee unroll,  The sand beneath thy feet makes whiter, crisper.  O dearest hand, to thee 'tis given  To change this hut into a lower heaven!  And here!    (_He lifts one of the bed-curtains_.)    What sweetest thrill is in my blood!  Here could I spend whole hours, delaying:  Here Nature shaped, as if in sportive playing,  The angel blossom from the bud.  Here lay the child, with Life's warm essence  The tender bosom filled and fair,  And here was wrought, through holier, purer presence,  The form diviner beings wear!    And I? What drew me here with power?  How deeply am I moved, this hour!  What seek I? Why so full my heart, and sore?  Miserable Faust! I know thee now no more.    Is there a magic vapor here?  I came, with lust of instant pleasure,  And lie dissolved in dreams of love's sweet leisure!  Are we the sport of every changeful atmosphere?    And if, this moment, came she in to me,  How would I for the fault atonement render!  How small the giant lout would be,  Prone at her feet, relaxed and tender!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Be quick! I see her there, returning.    FAUST    Go! go! I never will retreat.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Here is a casket, not unmeet,  Which elsewhere I have just been earning.  Here, set it in the press, with haste!  I swear, 'twill turn her head, to spy it:  Some baubles I therein had placed,  That you might win another by it.  True, child is child, and play is play.    FAUST    I know not, should I do it?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Ask you, pray?  Yourself, perhaps, would keep the bubble?  Then I suggest, 'twere fair and just  To spare the lovely day your lust,  And spare to me the further trouble.  You are not miserly, I trust?  I rub my hands, in expectation tender--    (_He places the casket in the press, and locks it again_.)    Now quick, away!  The sweet young maiden to betray,  So that by wish and will you bend her;  And you look as though  To the lecture-hall you were forced to go,--  As if stood before you, gray and loath,  Physics and Metaphysics both!  But away! [_Exeunt_.    MARGARET (_with a lamp_)    It is so close, so sultry, here!    (_She opens the window_)    And yet 'tis not so warm outside.  I feel, I know not why, such fear!--  Would mother came!--where can she bide?  My body's chill and shuddering,--  I'm but a silly, fearsome thing!    (_She begins to sing while undressing_)            There was a King in Thule,          Was faithful till the grave,--          To whom his mistress, dying,          A golden goblet gave.            Naught was to him more precious;          He drained it at every bout:          His eyes with tears ran over,          As oft as he drank thereout.            When came his time of dying,          The towns in his land he told,          Naught else to his heir denying          Except the goblet of gold.            He sat at the royal banquet          With his knights of high degree,          In the lofty hall of his fathers          In the Castle by the Sea.            There stood the old carouser,          And drank the last life-glow;          And hurled the hallowed goblet          Into the tide below.            He saw it plunging and filling,          And sinking deep in the sea:          Then fell his eyelids forever,          And never more drank he!    (_She opens the press in order to arrange her clothes, and perceives  the casket of jewels_.)    How comes that lovely casket here to me?  I locked the press, most certainly.  'Tis truly wonderful! What can within it be?  Perhaps 'twas brought by some one as a pawn,  And mother gave a loan thereon?  And here there hangs a key to fit:  I have a mind to open it.  What is that? God in Heaven! Whence came  Such things? Never beheld I aught so fair!  Rich ornaments, such as a noble dame  On highest holidays might wear!  How would the pearl-chain suit my hair?  Ah, who may all this splendor own?    (_She adorns herself with the jewelry, and steps before the  mirror_.)    Were but the ear-rings mine, alone!  One has at once another air.  What helps one's beauty, youthful blood?  One may possess them, well and good;  But none the more do others care.  They praise us half in pity, sure:  To gold still tends,  On gold depends  All, all! Alas, we poor!    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          IX      PROMENADE    (FAUST, _walking thoughtfully up and down. To him_ MEPHISTOPHELES.)    MEPHISTOPHELES    By all love ever rejected! By hell-fire hot and unsparing!  I wish I knew something worse, that I might use it for  swearing!    FAUST    What ails thee? What is't gripes thee, elf?  A face like thine beheld I never.    MEPHISTOPHELES    I would myself unto the Devil deliver,  If I were not a Devil myself!    FAUST    Thy head is out of order, sadly:  It much becomes thee to be raving madly.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Just think, the pocket of a priest should get  The trinkets left for Margaret!  The mother saw them, and, instanter,  A secret dread began to haunt her.  Keen scent has she for tainted air;  She snuffs within her book of prayer,  And smells each article, to see  If sacred or profane it be;  So here she guessed, from every gem,  That not much blessing came with them.  \"My child,\" she said, \"ill-gotten good  Ensnares the soul, consumes the blood.  Before the Mother of God we'll lay it;  With heavenly manna she'll repay it!\"  But Margaret thought, with sour grimace,  \"A gift-horse is not out of place,  And, truly! godless cannot be  The one who brought such things to me.\"  A parson came, by the mother bidden:  He saw, at once, where the game was hidden,  And viewed it with a favor stealthy.  He spake: \"That is the proper view,--  Who overcometh, winneth too.  The Holy Church has a stomach healthy:  Hath eaten many a land as forfeit,  And never yet complained of surfeit:  The Church alone, beyond all question,  Has for ill-gotten goods the right digestion.\"    FAUST    A general practice is the same,  Which Jew and King may also claim.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Then bagged the spangles, chains, and rings,  As if but toadstools were the things,  And thanked no less, and thanked no more  Than if a sack of nuts he bore,--  Promised them fullest heavenly pay,  And deeply edified were they.    FAUST    And Margaret?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Sits unrestful still,  And knows not what she should, or will;  Thinks on the jewels, day and night,  But more on him who gave her such delight.    FAUST    The darling's sorrow gives me pain.  Get thou a set for her again!  The first was not a great display.    MEPHISTOPHELES    O yes, the gentleman finds it all child's-play!    FAUST    Fix and arrange it to my will;  And on her neighbor try thy skill!  Don't be a Devil stiff as paste,  But get fresh jewels to her taste!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Yes, gracious Sir, in all obedience!    [_Exit_ FAUST.    Such an enamored fool in air would blow  Sun, moon, and all the starry legions,  To give his sweetheart a diverting show.    [_Exit_.    [Illustration]          X      THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE    MARTHA (_solus_)    God forgive my husband, yet he  Hasn't done his duty by me!  Off in the world he went straightway,--  Left me lie in the straw where I lay.  And, truly, I did naught to fret him:  God knows I loved, and can't forget him!    (_She weeps_.)    Perhaps he's even dead! Ah, woe!--  Had I a certificate to show!    MARGARET (_comes_)    Dame Martha!    MARTHA    Margaret! what's happened thee?    MARGARET    I scarce can stand, my knees are trembling!  I find a box, the first resembling,  Within my press! Of ebony,--  And things, all splendid to behold,  And richer far than were the old.    MARTHA    You mustn't tell it to your mother!  'Twould go to the priest, as did the other.    MARGARET    Ah, look and see--just look and see!    MARTHA (_adorning her_)    O, what a blessed luck for thee!    MARGARET    But, ah! in the streets I dare not bear them,  Nor in the church be seen to wear them.    MARTHA    Yet thou canst often this way wander,  And secretly the jewels don,  Walk up and down an hour, before the mirror yonder,--  We'll have our private joy thereon.  And then a chance will come, a holiday,  When, piece by piece, can one the things abroad display,  A chain at first, then other ornament:  Thy mother will not see, and stories we'll invent.    MARGARET    Whoever could have brought me things so precious?  That something's wrong, I feel suspicious.    (_A knock_)    Good Heaven! My mother can that have been?    MARTHA (_peeping through the blind_)    'Tis some strange gentleman.--Come in!    (MEPHISTOPHELES _enters_.)      MEPHISTOPHELES    That I so boldly introduce me,  I beg you, ladies, to excuse me.    (_Steps back reverently, on seeing_ MARGARET.)    For Martha Schwerdtlein I'd inquire!      MARTHA    I'm she: what does the gentleman desire?      MEPHISTOPHELES (_aside to her_)    It is enough that you are she:  You've a visitor of high degree.  Pardon the freedom I have ta'en,--  Will after noon return again.      MARTHA (_aloud_)    Of all things in the world! Just hear--  He takes thee for a lady, dear!      MARGARET    I am a creature young and poor:  The gentleman's too kind, I'm sure.  The jewels don't belong to me.      MEPHISTOPHELES    Ah, not alone the jewelry!  The look, the manner, both betray--  Rejoiced am I that I may stay!      MARTHA    What is your business? I would fain--    MEPHISTOPHELES    I would I had a more cheerful strain!  Take not unkindly its repeating:  Your husband's dead, and sends a greeting.      MARTHA    Is dead? Alas, that heart so true!  My husband dead! Let me die, too!

And she's queerer than ever.  I  never liked her much, but I can't bear that way she has now of looking  at people without speaking--just as if she was finding them out.\"    \"I am,\" said Sara, promptly, when she heard of this.  \"That's what I  look at some people for.  I like to know about them.  I think them over  afterward.\"    The truth was that she had saved herself annoyance several times by  keeping her eye on Lavinia, who was quite ready to make mischief, and  would have been rather pleased to have made it for the ex-show pupil.    Sara never made any mischief herself, or interfered with anyone.  She  worked like a drudge; she tramped through the wet streets, carrying  parcels and baskets; she labored with the childish inattention of the  little ones' French lessons; as she became shabbier and more  forlorn-looking, she was told that she had better take her meals  downstairs; she was treated as if she was nobody's concern, and her  heart grew proud and sore, but she never told anyone what she felt.    \"Soldiers don't complain,\" she would say between her small, shut teeth,  \"I am not going to do it; I will pretend this is part of a war.\"    But there were hours when her child heart might almost have broken with  loneliness but for three people.    The first, it must be owned, was Becky--just Becky.  Throughout all  that first night spent in the garret, she had felt a vague comfort in  knowing that on the other side of the wall in which the rats scuffled  and squeaked there was another young human creature. And during the  nights that followed the sense of comfort grew. They had little chance  to speak to each other during the day. Each had her own tasks to  perform, and any attempt at conversation would have been regarded as a  tendency to loiter and lose time. \"Don't mind me, miss,\" Becky  whispered during the first morning, \"if I don't say nothin' polite.  Some un'd be down on us if I did. I MEANS 'please' an' 'thank you' an'  'beg pardon,' but I dassn't to take time to say it.\"    But before daybreak she used to slip into Sara's attic and button her  dress and give her such help as she required before she went downstairs  to light the kitchen fire.  And when night came Sara always heard the  humble knock at her door which meant that her handmaid was ready to  help her again if she was needed.  During the first weeks of her grief  Sara felt as if she were too stupefied to talk, so it happened that  some time passed before they saw each other much or exchanged visits.  Becky's heart told her that it was best that people in trouble should  be left alone.    The second of the trio of comforters was Ermengarde, but odd things  happened before Ermengarde found her place.    When Sara's mind seemed to awaken again to the life about her, she  realized that she had forgotten that an Ermengarde lived in the world.  The two had always been friends, but Sara had felt as if she were years  the older.  It could not be contested that Ermengarde was as dull as  she was affectionate.  She clung to Sara in a simple, helpless way; she  brought her lessons to her that she might be helped; she listened to  her every word and besieged her with requests for stories.  But she had  nothing interesting to say herself, and she loathed books of every  description.  She was, in fact, not a person one would remember when  one was caught in the storm of a great trouble, and Sara forgot her.    It had been all the easier to forget her because she had been suddenly  called home for a few weeks.  When she came back she did not see Sara  for a day or two, and when she met her for the first time she  encountered her coming down a corridor with her arms full of garments  which were to be taken downstairs to be mended. Sara herself had  already been taught to mend them.  She looked pale and unlike herself,  and she was attired in the queer, outgrown frock whose shortness showed  so much thin black leg.    Ermengarde was too slow a girl to be equal to such a situation.  She  could not think of anything to say.  She knew what had happened, but,  somehow, she had never imagined Sara could look like this--so odd and  poor and almost like a servant.  It made her quite miserable, and she  could do nothing but break into a short hysterical laugh and  exclaim--aimlessly and as if without any meaning, \"Oh, Sara, is that  you?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Sara, and suddenly a strange thought passed through her  mind and made her face flush.  She held the pile of garments in her  arms, and her chin rested upon the top of it to keep it steady.  Something in the look of her straight-gazing eyes made Ermengarde lose  her wits still more.  She felt as if Sara had changed into a new kind  of girl, and she had never known her before. Perhaps it was because she  had suddenly grown poor and had to mend things and work like Becky.    \"Oh,\" she stammered.  \"How--how are you?\"    \"I don't know,\" Sara replied.  \"How are you?\"    \"I'm--I'm quite well,\" said Ermengarde, overwhelmed with shyness. Then  spasmodically she thought of something to say which seemed more  intimate.  \"Are you--are you very unhappy?\" she said in a rush.    Then Sara was guilty of an injustice.  Just at that moment her torn  heart swelled within her, and she felt that if anyone was as stupid as  that, one had better get away from her.    \"What do you think?\" she said.  \"Do you think I am very happy?\" And she  marched past her without another word.    In course of time she realized that if her wretchedness had not made  her forget things, she would have known that poor, dull Ermengarde was  not to be blamed for her unready, awkward ways.  She was always  awkward, and the more she felt, the more stupid she was given to being.    But the sudden thought which had flashed upon her had made her  over-sensitive.    \"She is like the others,\" she had thought.  \"She does not really want  to talk to me.  She knows no one does.\"    So for several weeks a barrier stood between them.  When they met by  chance Sara looked the other way, and Ermengarde felt too stiff and  embarrassed to speak.  Sometimes they nodded to each other in passing,  but there were times when they did not even exchange a greeting.    \"If she would rather not talk to me,\" Sara thought, \"I will keep out of  her way.  Miss Minchin makes that easy enough.\"    Miss Minchin made it so easy that at last they scarcely saw each other  at all.  At that time it was noticed that Ermengarde was more stupid  than ever, and that she looked listless and unhappy.  She used to sit  in the window-seat, huddled in a heap, and stare out of the window  without speaking.  Once Jessie, who was passing, stopped to look at her  curiously.    \"What are you crying for, Ermengarde?\" she asked.    \"I'm not crying,\" answered Ermengarde, in a muffled, unsteady voice.    \"You are,\" said Jessie.  \"A great big tear just rolled down the bridge  of your nose and dropped off at the end of it.  And there goes another.\"    \"Well,\" said Ermengarde, \"I'm miserable--and no one need interfere.\"  And she turned her plump back and took out her handkerchief and boldly  hid her face in it.    That night, when Sara went to her attic, she was later than usual. She  had been kept at work until after the hour at which the pupils went to  bed, and after that she had gone to her lessons in the lonely  schoolroom.  When she reached the top of the stairs, she was surprised  to see a glimmer of light coming from under the attic door.    \"Nobody goes there but myself,\" she thought quickly, \"but someone has  lighted a candle.\"    Someone had, indeed, lighted a candle, and it was not burning in the  kitchen candlestick she was expected to use, but in one of those  belonging to the pupils' bedrooms.  The someone was sitting upon the  battered footstool, and was dressed in her nightgown and wrapped up in  a red shawl.  It was Ermengarde.    \"Ermengarde!\" cried Sara.  She was so startled that she was almost  frightened.  \"You will get into trouble.\"    Ermengarde stumbled up from her footstool.  She shuffled across the  attic in her bedroom slippers, which were too large for her.  Her eyes  and nose were pink with crying.    \"I know I shall--if I'm found out.\"  she said.  \"But I don't care--I  don't care a bit.  Oh, Sara, please tell me.  What is the matter? Why  don't you like me any more?\"    Something in her voice made the familiar lump rise in Sara's throat. It  was so affectionate and simple--so like the old Ermengarde who had  asked her to be \"best friends.\"  It sounded as if she had not meant  what she had seemed to mean during these past weeks.    \"I do like you,\" Sara answered.  \"I thought--you see, everything is  different now.  I thought you--were different.\"    Ermengarde opened her wet eyes wide.    \"Why, it was you who were different!\" she cried.  \"You didn't want to  talk to me.  I didn't know what to do.  It was you who were different  after I came back.\"    Sara thought a moment.  She saw she had made a mistake.    \"I AM different,\" she explained, \"though not in the way you think. Miss  Minchin does not want me to talk to the girls.  Most of them don't want  to talk to me.  I thought--perhaps--you didn't.  So I tried to keep out  of your way.\"    \"Oh, Sara,\" Ermengarde almost wailed in her reproachful dismay.  And  then after one more look they rushed into each other's arms.  It must  be confessed that Sara's small black head lay for some minutes on the  shoulder covered by the red shawl.  When Ermengarde had seemed to  desert her, she had felt horribly lonely.    Afterward they sat down upon the floor together, Sara clasping her  knees with her arms, and Ermengarde rolled up in her shawl.  Ermengarde  looked at the odd, big-eyed little face adoringly.    \"I couldn't bear it any more,\" she said.  \"I dare say you could live  without me, Sara; but I couldn't live without you.  "]]]
