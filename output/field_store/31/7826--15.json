He confided this  information to her and she was very proud of him but gave him a good  spanking for fear he expressed this desire for freedom to his young  master or mistress.    Prayer meetings were very frequent during the days of the war and very  often the slaves were called in from the fields and excused from their  labors so they could hold these prayer meetings, always praying God for  the safe return of their master.    The master did not return after the war and when the soldiers in blue  came through that section the frightened women were greatly dependent  upon their slaves for protection and livelihood. Many of these black man  chose loyalty to their dead masters to freedom and shouldered the burden  of the support of their former mistresses cheerfully.    After the war Willis' father was one of those to remain with his widowed  mistress. Other members of his family left as soon as they were freed,  even his wife. They thus remained separated until her death.    Willis saw his first bedspring about 50 years ago and he still thinks a  feather mattress superior to the store-bought variety. He recalls a  humorous incident which occurred when he was a child and had been  introduced for the first time to the task of picking a goose.    After demonstrating how it was done to a group of slave children, the  person in charge had gone about his way leaving them busily engaged in  picking the goose. They had been told that the one gathering the most  feathers would receive a piece of money. Sometimes later the overseer  returned to find a dozen geese that had been stripped of all the  feathers. They had been told to pick only the pin feathers beneath the  wings and about the bodies of the geese. Need we guess what happened to  the over ambitious children?    He had heard of ice long before he looked upon it and he only thought of  it as another wild experiment. Why buy ice, when watermelons and butter  could be ley down into the well to keep cool?    One of Willis' happiest moments was when he earned enough money to buy  his first pair of patern leather shoes. To possess a paid of store  bought shoes had been his ambition since he was a child, when he had to  shine the shoes of his master and those of the master's children.    He next owned a horse and buggy of which he was very proud. This  increased his popularity with the girls and bye and bye he was married  to Mary, a girl with whom he had been reared. Nobody was surprised but  Mary, explained Mr. Dukes. \"Me and everybody else knowed us ud get  married some day. We didn't jump over no broom neither. We was married  like white folks wid flowers and cake and everything.\"    Willis Dukes has been in Florida for \"Lawd knows how long\" and prefers  this state to his home state. He still has a few relatives there but has  never returned since leaving so long ago.      REFERENCE    1. Personal Interview with Willis Dukes, Valdosta Road, near Jeslamb  Church, Madison, Florida          FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT  American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)    Pearl Randolph, Field Worker  John A. Simms, Editor  Mulberry, Florida  October 8, 1936    SAM AND LOUISA EVERETT      Sam and Louise Everett, 86 and 90 years of age respectively, have  weathered together some of the worst experiences of slavery, and as they  look back over the years, can relate these experiences as clearly as if  they had happened only yesterday.    Both were born near Norfolk, Virginia and sold as slaves several times  on nearby plantations. It was on the plantation of \"Big Jim\" McClain  that they met as slave-children and departed after Emancipation to live  the lives of free people.    Sam was the son of Peter and Betsy Everett, field hands who spent long  back-breaking hours in the cotton fields and came home at nightfall to  cultivate their small garden. They lived in constant fear that their  master would confiscate most of their vegetables; he so often did.    Louisa remembers little about her parents and thinks that she was sold  at an early age to a separate master. Her name as nearly as she could  remember was Norfolk Virginia. Everyone called her \"Nor.\" It was not  until after she was freed and had sent her children to school that she  changed her name to Louisa.    Sam and Norfolk spent part of their childhood on the plantation of \"Big  Jim\" who was very cruel; often he would whip his slaves into  insensibility for minor offences. He sometimes hung them up by their  thumbs whenever they were caught attempting to escape--\"er fer no reason  atall.\"    On this plantation were more than 100 slaves who were mated  indiscriminately and without any regard for family unions. If their  master thought that a certain man and woman might have strong, healthy  offspring, he forced them to have sexual relation, even though they were  married to other slaves. If there seemed to be any slight reluctance on  the part of either of the unfortunate ones \"Big Jim\" would make them  consummate this relationship in his presence. He used the same procedure  if he thought a certain couple was not producing children fast enough.  He enjoyed these orgies very much and often entertained his friends in  this manner; quite often he and his guests would engage in these  debaucheries, choosing for themselves the prettiest of the young women.  Sometimes they forced the unhappy husbands and lovers of their victims  to look on.    Louisa and Sam were married in a very revolting manner. To quote the  woman:    \"Marse Jim called me and Sam ter him and ordered Sam to pull off his  shirt--that was all the McClain niggers wore--and he said to me: 'Nor,  do you think you can stand this big nigger?' He had that old bull whip  flung acrost his shoulder, and Lawd, that man could hit so hard! So I  jes said 'yassur, I guess so,' and tried to hide my face so I couldn't  see Sam's nakedness, but he made me look at him anyhow.\"    \"Well, he told us what we must git busy and do in his presence, and we  had to do it. After that we were considered man and wife. Me and Sam was  a healthy pair and had fine, big babies, so I never had another man  forced on me, thank God. Sam was kind to me and I learnt to love him.\"    Life on the McClain plantation was a steady grind of work from morning  until night. Slaves had to rise in the dark of the morning at the  ringing of the \"Big House\" bell. After eating a hasty breakfast of fried  fat pork and corn pone, they worked in the fields until the bell rang  again at noon; at which time they ate boiled vegetables, roasted sweet  potatoes and black molasses. This food was cooked in iron pots which had  legs attached to their bottoms in order to keep them from resting  directly on the fire. These utensils were either hung over a fire or set  atop a mound of hot coals. Biscuits were a luxury but whenever they had  white bread it was cooked in another thick pan called a \"spider\". This  pan had a top which was covered with hot embers to insure the browning  of the bread on top.    Slave women had no time for their children. These were cared for by an  old woman who called them twice a day and fed them \"pot likker\"  (vegetable broth) and skimmed milk. Each child was provided with a  wooden laddle which he dipped into a wooden trough and fed himself. The  older children fed those who were too young to hold a laddle.    So exacting was \"Big Jim\" that slaves were forced to work even when  sick. Expectant mothers toiled in the fields until they felt their labor  pains. It was not uncommon for babies to be born in the fields.    There was little time for play on his plantation. Even the very small  children were assigned tasks. They hunted hen's eggs, gathered poke  berries for dyeing, shelled corn and drove the cows home in the evening.  Little girls knitted stockings.    There was no church on this plantation and itinerant ministers avoided  going there because of the owner's cruelty. Very seldom were the slaves  allowed to attend neighboring churches and still rarer were the  opportunities to hold meetings among themselves. Often when they were in  the middle of a song or prayer they would be forced to halt and run to  the \"Big House.\" Woe to any slave who ignored the ringing of the bell  that summoned him to work and told him when he might \"knock off\" from  his labors.    Louisa and Sam last heard the ringing of this bell in the fall of 1865.  All the slaves gathered in front of the \"Big House\" to be told that they  were free for the time being. They had heard whisperings of the War but  did not understand the meaning of it all. Now \"Big Jim\" stood weeping on  the piazza and cursing the fate that had been so cruel to him by robbing  him of all his \"niggers.\" He inquired if any wanted to remain until all  the crops were harvested and when no one consented to do so, he flew  into a rage; seizing his pistol, he began firing into the crowd of  frightened Negroes. Some were _killed_ outright and others were maimed  for life. Finally he was prevailed upon to stop. He then attempted to  take his own life. A few frightened slaves promised to remain with him  another year; this placated him. It was necessary for Union soldiers to  make another visit to the plantation before \"Big Jim\" would allow his  former slaves to depart.    Sam and Louisa moved to Boston, Georgia, where they sharecropped for  several years; they later bought a small farm when their two sons became  old enough to help. They continued to live on this homestead until a few  years ago, when their advancing ages made it necessary that they live  with the children. Both of the children had settled in Florida several  years previous and wanted their parents to come to them. They now live  in Mulberry, Florida with the younger son. Both are pitifully infirm but  can still remember the horrors they experienced under very cruel owners."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12299"],[0,"The Mechanical Properties of Wood

In tables of specific gravity or density of wood it should  always be stated whether the dry weight per unit of volume when  green or the dry weight per unit of volume when dry is intended,  since the shrinkage in volume may vary from 6 to 50 per cent,  though in conifers it is usually about 10 per cent, and in  hardwoods nearer 15 per cent. (See Table XIV.)        COLOR      In species which show a distinct difference between heartwood  and sapwood the natural color of heartwood is invariably darker  than that of the sapwood, and very frequently the contrast is  conspicuous. This is produced by deposits in the heartwood of  various materials resulting from the process of growth,  increased possibly by oxidation and other chemical changes,  which usually have little or no appreciable effect on the  mechanical properties of the wood. (See HEARTWOOD AND SAPWOOD,  above.) Some experiments[28] on very resinous longleaf pine  specimens, however, indicate an increase in strength. This is  due to the resin which increases the strength when dry. Spruce  impregnated with crude resin and dried is greatly increased in  strength thereby.    [Footnote 28: Bul. 70, U.S. Forest Service, p. 92; also p. 126,  appendix.]    Since the late wood of a growth ring is usually darker in color  than the early wood, this fact may be used in judging the  density, and therefore the hardness and strength of the  material. This is particularly the case with coniferous woods.  In ring-porous woods the vessels of the early wood not  infrequently appear on a finished surface as darker than the  denser late wood, though on cross sections of heartwood the  reverse is commonly true. Except in the manner just stated the  color of wood is no indication of strength.    Abnormal discoloration of wood often denotes a diseased  condition,"]]]
