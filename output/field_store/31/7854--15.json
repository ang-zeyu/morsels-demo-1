At daylight, an island was seen about three leagues distant, and two  islets, or rather rocks, somewhat nearer, to which the passengers and  part of the crew were sent. There being no fresh water to be found upon  these islands, Pelsert had a deck laid over one of the boats; and, on  June 8, put to sea, in order to make search upon the opposite main land:  his latitude, at noon, was 28 deg. 13' south.    A short time after quitting the Abrolhos, captain Pelsert got sight of  the coast, which, by estimation, bore N. by W. eight leagues from the  place of shipwreck.* He had 25 to 30 fathoms, and stood off till  midnight, when he again steered for the land; and in the morning of the  9th, it was four leagues off. He ran that day from five to seven leagues,  sometimes to the north, sometimes to the west; the direction of the coast  being N. by W.: it appeared to be rocky--without trees--and about the  same height as the coast of Dover. A small, sandy bay was seen, into  which Pelsert desired to enter; but finding too much surf, and the  weather becoming bad, he was obliged to haul further off.    [* Thevenot says _six miles_, and does not explain what kind of miles  they are; but it is most probable that he literally copies his original,  and that they are Dutch miles of fifteen to a degree. Van Keulen, in  speaking of Houtman's Abrolhos, says, page 19, \"This shoal is, as we  believe, 11 or 12 leagues (_8 ae 9 mijlen)_ from the coast.\"]    July 10. He kept in the same parallel, upon a wind; the weather being  bad, and his boat very leaky. Next day, the wind was at W. S. W., and  more moderate. He then steered north; for the sea was too high to  approach the shore in safety. On the 12th, Pelsert observed the latitude  to be 27 deg., and steered along the coast with a fair wind at S. E.; but the  shore was too steep to admit of landing; neither could he find any bay or  island to break off the sea. At a distance, the land seemed fertile and  covered with plants. The latitude, on the 13th, was 25 deg. 40', which showed  a current setting to the northward. Here Pelsert found himself a-breast  of an opening, where the coast trends to the north-east (apparently into  Shark's Bay). The course this day was nearly north; the shore consisted  of reddish rock, of an equal height; and there being no island in front,  the waves, which broke high upon it, prevented landing.    June 14. The wind was at east; and at noon, the latitude was observed to  be 24 deg.. The tides (or rather the current) took the boat further to the  north than was desired; for Pelsert then carried but little sail, in the  hope to find a landing place without going further. Perceiving some  smokes at a distance, he rowed towards them; but the shore proved to be  steep, with many rocks, and the sea broke high against it. At length, six  of his people leaped overboard, and with much labour and risk got through  the surf, whilst the boat remained at anchor, in 25 fathoms. The sailors  employed the rest of the day in seeking for water; and on looking about  on every side, they saw four natives creeping towards them on their hands  and feet. One of \"our people\" having appeared on an eminence, near them,  the natives rose up and took to flight; so that those who were in the  boat could see them distinctly. These men were wild, black, and  altogether naked; not covering even those parts which almost all savages  conceal.    The six sailors, losing all hope of finding water, swam back to the boat,  wounded and bruised by the blows they had received from the waves and  rocks. The anchor was then weighed, and Pelsert continued his course,  under easy sail, along the coast; but keeping without side of the shoals.  The 15th in the morning, they discovered a cape, off which lay a chain of  rocks, running out four miles into the sea; and behind this was another  reef, close to the shore. The water being tolerably still between them,  Pelsert thought to pass through; but the reefs joined round further on,  and obliged him to return. At noon, an opening was seen, where the water  was smooth, and they went into it, but with considerable danger; for the  depth was no more than two feet, and the bottom stony. On landing, the  people dug holes in the sand; but the water which oozed in was salt. At  length, fresh rain water was found in the cavities of the rocks, and  afforded them great relief; for they had, hitherto, been confined to a  pint of water each. They staid on shore that night, and collected full  forty gallons. Ashes and the remains of cray fish were found; which  showed that the natives had been there no long time before.    July 16. They sought to collect more water, but were unsuccessful; and  none could be expected in the sandy, level country behind the coast. This  plain was destitute of both grass and trees, and covered with ant hills  so large, that they might have been taken for the houses of Indians. The  quantity of flies was such, that the people had great difficulty in  keeping them off. Eight savages, with with each a stick (probably a  spear) in his hand, were seen at a distance. They came within musket  shot; but on the Dutch sailors going towards them they took to flight.    Captain Pelsert, being at length convinced of the impossibility of  procuring more water, determined to quit this coast. At noon, he got  withoutside of the reef by a second opening more to the north; for,  having observed the latitude to be 22 deg. 17', his intention was to seek for  the _River of Jacob Remessens_ (near the North-west Cape); but the wind  veering to north-east, he could no longer follow the direction of the  coast. Considering, then, that he was more than four hundred miles from  the place of shipwreck, and that scarcely water enough had been found for  themselves, Pelsert resolved to make the best of his way to Batavia, to  solicit assistance from the governor-general.    In the mean time, some one of the people left upon the islands of the  _Abrolhos_ thought of tasting the water in two holes, which, from its  rising and falling with the tide, was believed to be salt; but, to their  great surprise and joy, it was found good to drink, and never failed them  afterwards.    On Pelsert's return to the Abrolhos in the yacht _Sardam_, he was under  the necessity of executing some atrocious conspirators, and two were set  on shore upon the opposite main land.* Tasman was directed by his  instructions, in 1644, to \"inquire at the continent thereabout, after two  Dutchmen; who, having forfeited their lives, were put on shore by the  commodore Francisco Pelsert, if still alive. In such case, you may make  your inquiries of them about the situation of those countries; and if  they entreat you to that purpose, give them passage hither.\"    [* For an account of the miseries and horrors which took place on the  islands of the Abrolhos during the absence of Pelsert, the English reader  is referred to Vol. I. p. 320 to 325 of _Campbell's_ edition of _Harris'  Voyages_; but the nautical details there given are very incorrect.]    TASMAN. 1644.    It is not from any direct information, that ABEL JANSZ TASMAN is placed  as the next discoverer upon the western coasts of Terra Australis; for,  as has been already observed, no account of his second voyage has ever  been made public, or is any such known to exist. It is, however,  supposed, with great probability of truth, that, after the examination of  the North Coast, he pursued his course westward along the shore to the  North-west Cape, conformably to his instructions; but that he did not go  further southward along the Land of Endragt than to the tropic of  Capricorn, where he quitted his examination, and returned to Batavia.    The chart published by Thevenot, in 1663, gives a form to the Western  Coasts, and joins them to the northern Van Diemen's Land; but it is  evident from Tasman's instructions, that the part between De Witt's Land  and Cape Van Diemen was unknown to the Dutch government at Batavia in  1644. And since there is no account of its having been seen during the  intermediate nineteen years, it may be concluded that the North-west  Coast was first explored by him; and Dampier says (Vol. III. p. 96), that  he had Tasman's chart of it; though none bearing his name can now be  found.*    [* The French editor of the _Voyage de Decouvertes aux Terres Australes_,  published in 1807, Vol. I. p. 128, attributes the formation of the  North-west Coast in the common charts to the expedition of the three  Dutch vessels sent from Timor in 1705. But this is a mistake. It is the  chart of Thevenot, his countryman, _published forty-two years previously_  to that expedition, which has been mostly followed by succeeding  geographers.]    The notes of burgomaster Witsen show, that the North-west Coast was  visited by Tasman; and as they give the earliest information of the  inhabitants, and are curious in themselves, they are here transcribed  from Mr. Dalrymple's Papua.    \"In lat. 13 deg. 8' S. lon. 146 deg. 18'\" (probably about 1291/2 deg. east of  Greenwich), \"the coast is barren. The people are bad and wicked, shooting  at the Dutch with arrows, without provocation, when they were coming on  shore: It is here very populous.\"    \"In 14 deg. 58' S. lon. 138 deg. 59' (about 125 deg. east), the people are savage,  and go naked: none can understand them.\"    \"In HOLLANDIA NOVA,* in 17 deg. 12' S. (lon. 121 deg. or 122 deg. east) _Tasman_  found a naked, black people, with curly hair; malicious and cruel, using  for arms, bows and arrows, hazeygaeys and kalawaeys. They once came to  the number of fifty, double armed, dividing themselves into two parties,  intending to have surprised the Dutch, who had landed twenty-five men;  but the firing of guns frightened them so that they fled.

It is indeed true that the magical element involved in the  discharge of sacrificial duties lingered for a while in the symbolic  worship of Brahman in which He was conceived almost as a deity.  The minds of the Vedic poets so long accustomed to worship  deities of visible manifestation could not easily dispense with the  idea of seeking after a positive and definite content of Brahman.  They tried some of the sublime powers of nature and also many  symbols, but these could not render ultimate satisfaction. They  did not know what the Brahman was like, for they had only a  dim and dreamy vision of it in the deep craving of their souls  which could not be translated into permanent terms. But this  was enough to lead them on to the goal, for they could not be  satisfied with anything short of the highest.    They found that by whatever means they tried to give a  positive and definite content of the ultimate reality, the Brahman,  they failed. Positive definitions were impossible. They could not  point out what the Brahman was like in order to give an utterance  to that which was unutterable, they could only say that it was not  like aught that we find in experience. Yajnavalkya said \"He  the atman is not this, nor this (_neti neti_). He is inconceivable,  for he cannot be conceived, unchangeable, for he is not changed,  untouched, for nothing touches him; he cannot suffer by a stroke    45    of the sword, he cannot suffer any injury [Footnote ref 1].\" He is  _asat_, non-being, for the being which Brahman is, is not to be  understood as such being as is known to us by experience; yet he is  being, for he alone is supremely real, for the universe subsists by  him. We ourselves are but he, and yet we know not what he is. Whatever  we can experience, whatever we can express, is limited, but he is the  unlimited, the basis of all. \"That which is inaudible, intangible,  invisible, indestructible, which cannot be tasted, nor smelt, eternal,  without beginning or end, greater than the great (_mahat_), the fixed.  He who knows it is released from the jaws of death [Footnote ref 2].\"  Space, time and causality do not appertain to him, for he at once forms  their essence and transcends them. He is the infinite and the vast, yet  the smallest of the small, at once here as there, there as here; no  characterisation of him is possible, otherwise than by the denial  to him of all empirical attributes, relations and definitions. He  is independent of all limitations of space, time, and cause which  rules all that is objectively presented, and therefore the empirical  universe. When Bahva was questioned by Va@skali, he expounded  the nature of Brahman to him by maintaining silence--\"Teach  me,\" said Va@skali, \"most reverent sir, the nature of Brahman.\"  Bahva however remained silent. But when the question was put  forth a second or third time he answered, \"I teach you indeed but  you do not understand; the Atman is silence [Footnote ref 3].\" The way  to indicate it is thus by _neti neti_, it is not this, it is not this.  We cannot describe it by any positive content which is always limited  by conceptual thought.      The Atman doctrine.    The sum and substance of the Upani@sad teaching is involved  in the equation Atman=Brahman. We have already seen that the  word Atman was used in the @Rg-Veda to denote on the one hand  the ultimate essence of the universe, and on the other the vital  breath in man. Later on in the Upani@sads we see that the word  Brahman is generally used in the former sense, while the word  Atman is reserved to denote the inmost essence in man, and the    _________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: B@rh. IV. 5. 15. Deussen, Max Muller and Roer have all  misinterpreted this passage; _asito_ has been interpreted as an  adjective or participle, though no evidence has ever been adduced;  it is evidently the ablative of _asi_, a sword.]    [Footnote 2: Ka@tha III. 15.]    [Footnote 3: Sa@nkara on _Brahmasutra_, III. 2. 17, and also Deussen,  _Philosophy of the Upanishads_, p. 156.]    46    Upani@sads are emphatic in their declaration that the two are one  and the same. But what is the inmost essence of man? The self  of man involves an ambiguity, as it is used in a variety of senses.  Thus so far as man consists of the essence of food (i.e. the physical  parts of man) he is called _annamaya_. But behind the sheath of  this body there is the other self consisting of the vital breath  which is called the self as vital breath (_pra@namaya atman_).  Behind this again there is the other self \"consisting of will\" called  the _manomaya atman_. This again contains within it the self  \"consisting of consciousness\" called the _vijnanamaya atman_. But  behind it we come to the final essence the self as pure bliss (the  _anandamaya atman_). The texts say: \"Truly he is the rapture;  for whoever gets this rapture becomes blissful. For who could  live, who could breathe if this space (_akas'a_) was not bliss? For  it is he who behaves as bliss. For whoever in that Invisible,  Self-surpassing, Unspeakable, Supportless finds fearless support, he  really becomes fearless. But whoever finds even a slight difference,  between himself and this Atman there is fear for him [Footnote ref 1].\"    Again in another place we find that Prajapati said: \"The self  (_atman_) which is free from sin, free from old age, from death and  grief, from hunger and thirst, whose desires are true, whose cogitations  are true, that is to be searched for, that is to be enquired;  he gets all his desires and all worlds who knows that self [Footnote  ref 2].\" The gods and the demons on hearing of this sent Indra and  Virocana respectively as their representatives to enquire of this self  from Prajapati. He agreed to teach them, and asked them to look  into a vessel of water and tell him how much of self they could  find. They answered: \"We see, this our whole self, even to the  hair, and to the nails.\" And he said, \"Well, that is the self, that  is the deathless and the fearless, that is the Brahman.\" They went  away pleased, but Prajapati thought, \"There they go away,  without having discovered, without having realized the self.\"  Virocana came away with the conviction that the body was the  self; but Indra did not return back to the gods, he was afraid and  pestered with doubts and came back to Prajapati and said, \"just  as the self becomes decorated when the body is decorated, well-dressed  when the body is well-dressed, well-cleaned when the  body is well-cleaned, even so that image self will be blind when  the body is blind, injured in one eye when the body is injured in  one eye, and mutilated when the body is mutilated, and it perishes    _____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Taitt. II. 7.]    [Footnote 2: Cha. VIII. 7. 1.]    47    when the body perishes, therefore I can see no good in this theory.\"  Prajapati then gave him a higher instruction about the self, and  said, \"He who goes about enjoying dreams, he is the self, this  is the deathless, the fearless, this is Brahman.\" Indra departed  but was again disturbed with doubts, and was afraid and came  back and said \"that though the dream self does not become blind  when the body is blind, or injured in one eye when the body is  so injured and is not affected by its defects, and is not killed by  its destruction, but yet it is as if it was overwhelmed, as if it  suffered and as if it wept--in this I see no good.\" Prajapati gave a  still higher instruction: \"When a man, fast asleep, in total  contentment, does not know any dreams, this is the self, this is the  deathless, the fearless, this is Brahman.\" Indra departed but was  again filled with doubts on the way, and returned again and said \"the  self in deep sleep does not know himself, that I am this, nor does  he know any other existing objects. He is destroyed and lost.  I see no good in this.\" And now Prajapati after having given a  course of successively higher instructions as self as the body, as  the self in dreams and as the self in deep dreamless sleep, and  having found that the enquirer in each case could find out that this  was not the ultimate truth about the self that he was seeking,  ultimately gave him the ultimate and final instruction about the  full truth about the self, and said \"this body is the support of the  deathless and the bodiless self. The self as embodied is affected  by pleasure and pain, the self when associated with the body cannot  get rid of pleasure and pain, but pleasure and pain do not  touch the bodiless self [Footnote ref 1].\"    As the anecdote shows, they sought such a constant and unchangeable  essence in man as was beyond the limits of any change.  This inmost essence has sometimes been described as pure  subject-object-less consciousness, the reality, and the bliss. He is  the seer of all seeing, the hearer of all hearing and the knower of all  knowledge. He sees but is not seen, hears but is not heard, knows  but is not known. He is the light of all lights. He is like a lump  of salt, with no inner or outer, which consists through and through  entirely of savour; as in truth this Atman has no inner or outer,  but consists through and through entirely of knowledge. Bliss is  not an attribute of it but it is bliss itself. The state of Brahman  is thus likened unto the state of dreamless sleep. And he who  has reached this bliss is beyond any fear. It is dearer to us than    ____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Cha. VIII. 7-12.]    48    son, brother, wife, or husband, wealth or prosperity. It is for it  and by it that things appear dear to us. It is the dearest _par  excellence_, our inmost Atman. All limitation is fraught with pain;  it is the infinite alone that is the highest bliss. When a man  receives this rapture, then is he full of bliss; for who"]]]
