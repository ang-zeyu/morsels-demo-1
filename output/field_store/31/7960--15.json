At present there are in the  kingdom, besides the central post at Rome, some fifteen dove cotes,  the principal ones of which are established at Naples, Gaeta,  Alexandria, Bologna, Ancona and Placenza. There are at least two on  the French frontier at Fenestrella and Exilles, and two others in  Sardinia, at Cagliari and Maddalena. The complete system includes  twenty-three; moreover, there are two in operation at Massoua and  Assab.    The cost of each cote amounts to about 1,000 francs. The pigeons are  registered and taken care of by a pigeon breeder (a subofficer)  assisted by a soldier. The head of the service is Commandant of  Engineers Malagoli, one of the most distinguished of pigeon fanciers.    We represent in Fig. 2 one of the baskets used in France for carrying  the birds to where they are to be set free.--_La Nature._           *       *       *       *       *          THE ISLE OF MAN TWIN SCREW STEAMER TYNWALD.      We place on record the details of the first high speed twin screw  steamer built for the service. Of this vessel, named the Tynwald, we  give a profile and an engraving of stern, showing the method of  supporting the brackets for propeller shafting.    [Illustration: Twin screws--rear view]    The Tynwald is 265 feet long, 34 feet 6 inches beam, and 14 feet 6  inches depth moulded, the gross tonnage being 946 tons. The desire of  the owners to put the vessel alternately on two distinct services  required special arrangement of the saloons. Running between Liverpool  and the island there was no necessity for sleeping accommodation, as  the passage is made in about three hours; and the ship had to be  suited to carry immense crowds. But as the owners wished on special  occasions to run the vessel from Glasgow to Manxland it was necessary  to so arrange the saloons as to admit of sleeping accommodation being  provided on these occasions. On the Liverpool run the vessel will  carry from 800 to 900 passengers. A spacious promenade is an  indispensable desideratum, and the upper or shelter deck has been made  flush from stem to stern, the only obstructions in addition to the  engine and boiler casings, and the deck and cargo working machinery,  being a small deck house aft with special state rooms, ticket and post  offices, and the companion way to the saloons below. On the main deck  forward is a sheltered promenade for second class passengers, while on  the lower deck below are dining saloons, the sofas of which may be  improvised for sleeping accommodation. At the extreme after end of the  main deck is the first class saloon, with the ladies' room forward on  the starboard side, and, there being no alley way forward, the ladies'  lavatories are provided on the starboard side of the engine casing. On  the port side are the gentlemen's lavatories, and smoking saloon and  bar. The dining saloon is aft on the lower deck, with ladies' room  forward. In the two saloons and ladies' rooms sofa berths can be  arranged to accommodate 252 passengers. The crew and petty officers  are accommodated in the forward part of the ship. As the profile  shows, the vessel is divided by transverse bulkheads into seven  watertight compartments, and there are double bottoms. She has six  large boats and several rafts.    [Illustration: THE LIVERPOOL AND ISLE OF MAN TWIN SCREW STEAMER  TYNWALD.]    The twin screws are revolved by separate triple expansion engines,  steam being supplied by two double-ended boilers. Each boiler is  placed fore and aft, and each has a separate uptake and funnel. There  are three stokeholds, and to ventilate them and supply sufficient air  for the furnaces there is in each a 6 foot fan driven by an  independent engine running at 250 revolutions. These have been  supplied by Messrs. W.H. Allen & Co., London. The boilers are of steel  and adapted for a working pressure of 160 lb. to the square inch. They  are 16 feet in diameter and 18 feet long, and there are eight furnaces  in each boiler, sixteen in all, the diameter of each furnace being 3  feet 41/2 inches.    The cylinders of the main engines are 22 in., 36 in., and 57 in. in  diameter respectively, with a piston stroke of 3 ft. The high-pressure  cylinders are each fitted with a piston valve, and the intermediate  and low-pressure cylinders with double-ported slide valves, all of  which are worked by the usual double eccentric and link motion valve  gear, by which the cut-off can be varied as required. All the shafting  is forged of Siemens-Martin mild steel of the best quality, each of  the three separate cranks being built up. The condensers are placed at  the outsides of the engine room, and the air, feed, and bilge pumps  are between the engines and the condensers and worked by levers from  the low-pressure engine crosshead. There are two centrifugal pumps,  each worked by a separate engine for circulating water through the  condenser, and these are so arranged that they can be connected to the  bilges in the event of an accident to the ship. In the engine room  there is fitted an auxiliary feed donkey of the duplex type and made  by the Fairfield Company.    This pump has all the usual connections, so that it can be used for  feeding the boilers from the hot well, for filling the fresh water  tanks, for pumping from the bilges, or from the sea as a fire engine.  The engines are arranged in the ship with the starting platform  between them; and the handles for working the throttle valves,  starting valves, reversing gear (Brown's combined steam and  hydraulic), and drain cocks are brought together at one end of the  platform, so that the engineer in charge can readily control both  engines. The two sets of engines are bound together by two beams  bolted to the framing of each engine. This feature was introduced into  the design for steadiness.    The method of supporting the propeller shaft brackets is interesting,  and we reproduce a photograph that indicates the arrangement adopted.  Instead of the A frame forming part of the same forging as the stern  frame, the Fairfield Company have built up the supporting arms of  steel plates riveted together, as is clearly shown. There is an  advantage in cost and with less risk in undiscovered flaws in  material.    An interesting change has been made in the steam pipes. Cases of  copper steam pipes bursting when subjected to high pressure have not  been infrequent, and Mr. A. Laing, the engineering director on the  Fairfield Board, with characteristic desire to advance engineering  practice, has been devoting much attention to this question lately. He  has made very exhaustive tests with lap welded iron steam pipes of all  diameters, but principally of 10 in. diameter and 3/8 in. thickness of  material, made by Messrs. A. & J. Stuart & Clydesdale, Limited, and  the results have been such as to induce him to introduce these into  vessels recently built by the company. It may be stated that the pipes  only burst at a hydraulic pressure of 3,000 lb. to the square inches.    The Tynwald was tried on the Clyde about a month ago, and on two runs  on the mile, the one with and the other against the tide, the mean  speed was 19.38 knots--the maximum was 191/2 knots--and the indicated  horse power developed was 5,200, the steam pressure being 160 lb., and  the vacuum 28 lb. Since that time the vessel has made several runs  from Liverpool and from Glasgow to the Isle of Man, and has maintained  a steady seagoing speed of between 18 and 19 knots.--_Engineering._           *       *       *       *       *          THE TREATMENT OF REFRACTORY ORES.      Mr. Jas. J. Shedlock, with the assistance of Mr. T. Denny, of  Australia, has constructed on behalf of the Metallurgical Syndicate,  of 105 Gresham House, London, an apparatus on a commercial scale,  which, it is said, effects at the smallest expense, and with the best  economical results, the entire separation of metals from their ores.  In treating ores by this process, the stone is crushed in the usual  way, either by rolls or stamps, the crushed ore being conveyed into an  apparatus, where each atom is subjected to the action of gases under  pressure, whereby the whole of the sulphur and other materials which  render the ore refractory are separated. The ore is then conveyed into  a vessel containing an absorbing fluid metal, so constructed that  every particle of the ore is brought into contact with the metal. For  the production of reducing gases, steam and air are passed through  highly heated materials, having an affinity for oxygen, and the gases  so produced are utilized for raising the ore to a high temperature. By  this means the sulphur and other metalloids and base metals are  volatilized and eliminated, and the gold in the ore is then in such a  condition as to alloy itself or become amalgamated with the fluid  metal with which it is brought into close contact. The tailings  passing off, worthless, are conveyed to the dump.    The apparatus in the background is that in which the steam is  generated, and which, in combination with the due proportion of  atmospheric air, is first superheated in passing through the hearth or  bed on which the fire is supported. The superheated steam and air  under pressure are then forced through the fire, which is  automatically maintained at a considerable depth, by which means the  products of combustion are mainly hydrogen and carbonic oxide. These  gases are then conveyed by means of the main and branch pipes to the  cylindrical apparatus in the foreground, into which the ore to be  acted upon is driven under pressure by means of the gases, which,  being ignited, raise the ore to a high temperature. The ore is  maintained in a state of violent agitation. Each particle being kept  separate from its fellows is consequently very rapidly acted upon by  the gases. The ore freed from its refractory constituents is then fed  into a vessel containing the fluid metal, in which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14992"],[0,"The Life of Froude (#15)"],[1,"mon, but \"a large  manuscript collection of copies of letters, minutes of council,  theological tracts, parliamentary petitions, depositions upon trials,  and miscellaneous communications upon the state of the country  furnished by agents of the Government, all relating to the early years  of the English Reformation.\" No historian has ever been more diligent  than Froude was in reading and collating manuscripts. For Henry's  reign alone he read and transcribed six hundred and eighty-seven pages  in his small, close handwriting. That in so doing, and in working  without assistance, he should sometimes fall into error was  unavoidable. But he never spared himself. He was the most laborious of  students, and his History was as difficult to write as it is easy to  read. He had, as this hostile reviewer says, a \"genuine love of  historical research,\" and there is point in the same critic's  complaint that his pages are \"over-loaded with long quotations from  State Papers.\"    What, then, it will be asked, was the real gist of the charges made  against Froude by The Edinburgh Review? The question at issue was  nothing less than the whole policy of Henry's reign, and the motives  of the King. The character of Henry is one of the most puzzling in  historical literature, and Froude had to deal with the most  difficult part of it. To the virtues of his earlier days Erasmus is  an unimpeachable witness. The power of his mind and the excellence  of his education are beyond dispute. He held the Catholic faith, he  was not naturally cruel, and, compared with Francis I., or with  Henry of Navarre, he was not licentious. But he was brought up to  believe that the ordinary rules of morality do not govern kings.  That the king can do no wrong is now a maxim of the Constitution,  and merely means that Ministers are responsible for the acts of the  Crown. Henry could scarcely have been made to understand, even if  there had been any one to tell him, what a constitutional monarch  was. Though forced to admit, and taught by experience, that he could  not safely tax his subjects without the formal sanction of  Parliament, he was in theory absolute, and he held it his duty to  rule as well as to reign. When Charles I. argued, a century later,  that a king was not bound to keep faith with his subjects, it may be  doubted whether he deceived himself. The thoughts of men are widened  with the process of the suns. His duty to God Henry would always  have acknowledged. A historian so widely different from Froude as  Bishop Stubbs has pointed out that, if mere self-indulgence had been  the king's object, the infinite pains he took to obtain a Papal  divorce from Katharine of Aragon would have been thrown away. That  he had a duty to his neighbour, male or female, never entered his  head. His subjects were his own, to deal with as he pleased.  Revolting as this theory may seem now, it was held by most people  then, and there was not a man in England, not Sir Thomas More  himself, who would have told the King that it was untrue.    It is with the divorce of Katharine that the difficulty of  estimating Henry begins. Froude's narrative sets out with the  marriage of Anne Boleyn. Here the reviewer plants his first arrow.  The divorce was a nullity, having no authority  higher than  Cranmer's. Anne Boleyn, as is likely enough from other causes, was  never the King's wife, and Elizabeth was illegitimate, though she  had of course a Parliamentary title to the throne. It seems clear,  however, that inasmuch as Katharine had been his brother Prince  Arthur's wife, the King could not lawfully marry her, according to  the canons of the Catholic Church. Why did he marry Anne Boleyn? The  reviewer says because he was in love with her, and triumphantly  refers to the King's letters, printed in the Appendix of Hearne's  Ayesbury.* They are undoubtedly love-letters, and they contain one  indelicate expression. Compared with Mirabeau's letters to Sophie de  Monnier, they are cold and chaste. Froude says that the King wanted  a male heir, and he gives the same reason for the scandalously  indecent haste with which Jane Seymour was married the day after  Anne's execution. The character of Henry VIII. is only important now  as it bears upon the policy of his reign. That Froude washed him too  white is almost as certain as that Lingard painted him too black.  The notion that lust supplies the key to his marriages and their  consequences is utterly ridiculous. The most dissolute of English  kings was content, and more than content, with one wife. On the  other hand, Froude does at least give a clue when he suggests that  these frequent marriages were political moves. A female sovereign  reigning in her own right had never been known in England, and up to  the birth of Jane Seymour's son Edward the whole kingdom  passionately desired that there should be a Prince of Wales. Edward  himself was but a sickly child, and was not expected to live even  for the short span of his actual career. Credulous indeed must they  be who maintain the innocence either of Anne Boleyn or of Katharine  Howard, and there seems small use in holding with the learned Father  Gasquet that Anne was not guilty of the offences imputed to her, but  had done something too bad to be mentioned on a trial for incest. It  is a question of evidence, and the evidence is lost. But the Grand  Jury which presented Anne was respectable, the Court which convicted  her was distinguished, and neither she nor any of her paramours  denied their guilt on the scaffold. Simple adultery in a queen was  capital then, if indeed it be not capital now. In an ordinary  husband Henry's conduct would have been revolting. It is not  attractive in him. Stubbs pleads that we cannot judge him, and  abandons the attempt in despair.    --  * Oxford, 1720.  --    As he rejects with equal decision both the Roman Catholic picture  and Froude's, he only puts us all to ignorance again. Froude is at  least intelligible.    It is a fact, and not a fancy, that Henry provided from the spoils  of the monasteries for the defence of the realm, that he founded new  bishoprics from the same source, that he disarmed the ecclesiastical  tribunals, and broke the bonds of Rome. The corruption of at least  the smaller monasteries, some of which were suppressed by Wolsey  before the rise of Cromwell, is established by the balance of  evidence, and the disappearance of the Black Book which set forth  their condition was only to be expected in the reign of Mary. The  crime which weighs most upon the memory of the King is the execution  of Fisher and More.    More, though he persecuted heretics, is the saint and philosopher of  the age. Of Fisher Macaulay says that he was worthy to have lived in  a better age, and died in a better cause. But what if these good  men, from purely conscientious motives, would have brought over a  Spanish army to coerce their Protestant fellow-subjects and their  lawful sovereign? That, and not speculative error, is the real  charge against them. Henry did all he could to put himself in the  wrong. His atrocious request that More \"would not use many words on  the scaffold\" makes one hate him after the lapse of well-nigh four  hundred years. The question, however, is not one of personal  feeling. Good men go wrong. Bad men are made by providence to be  instruments for good. It is not More, nor Fisher, it is the  Bluebeard of the children's history-books who gave England Miles  Coverdale's Bible, who freed her from the yoke that oppressed France  till the Revolution, and oppresses Spain to-day. Froude's first four  volumes are an eloquent indictment of Ultramontanism, a plea for the  Reformation, a sustained argument for English liberties and freedom  of thought. No such book can be impartial in the sense of admitting  that there is as much to be said on one side as on the other. Froude  replied to The Edinburgh Review in Fraser's Magazine for September,  1858, and in the following month the reviewer retorted. He did not  really shake the foundation of Froude's case, which was the same as  Luther's. Luther, like Froude, was no democrat. To both of them the  Reformation was a protest against ecclesiastical tyranny, or for  spiritual freedom. \"The comedy has ended in a marriage,\" said  Erasmus of Luther and Luther's wife. It was not a comedy, and it had  not ended.    Froude sometimes goes too far. When he defends the Boiling Act,  under which human beings were actually boiled alive in Smithfield,  he shakes confidence in his judgment. He sets too much value upon  the verdicts of Henry's tribunals, forgetting Macaulay's emphatic  declaration that State trials before 1688 were murder under the  forms of law. Although the subject of his Prize Essay at Oxford was  \"The Influence of the Science of Political Economy upon the Moral  and Social Welfare of a Nation,\" he never to the end of his life  understood what political economy was. Misled by Carlyle, he  conceived it to be a sort of \"Gospel,\" a rival system to the  Christian religion, instead of useful generalisations from the  observed course of trade. He never got rid of the idea that  Governments could fix the rate of wages and the price of goods. A  more serious fault found by The Edinburgh reviewer, the ablest of  all Froude's critics, was the implication rather than the assertion  that Henry VIII.'s Parliaments represented the people. The House of  Commons in the sixteenth century was really chosen through the  Sheriffs by the Crown, and the preambles of the Statutes, upon which  Froude relied as evidence of contemporary opinion, showed the  opinion of the Government rather than the opinion of the people.    They are not of course on that account to be neglected. Although the  House of Commons was no result of popular election, it consisted of  representative Englishmen, who would hardly have acquiesced in  statements notoriously untrue.
