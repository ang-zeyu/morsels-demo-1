[Sidenote: Political geography and history.]    In history, the question of territory,--by which is meant mere area in  contrast to specific geographic conditions--has constantly come to the  front, because a state obviously involved land and boundaries, and  assumed as its chief function the defence and extension of these.  Therefore political geography developed early as an offshoot of history.  Political science has often formulated its principles without regard to  the geographic conditions of states, but as a matter of fact, the most  fruitful political policies of nations have almost invariably had a  geographic core. Witness the colonial policy of Holland, England, France  and Portugal, the free-trade policy of England, the militantism of  Germany, the whole complex question of European balance of power and the  Bosporus, and the Monroe Doctrine of the United States. Dividing lines  between political parties tend to follow approximately geographic lines  of cleavage; and these make themselves apparent at recurring intervals  of national upheaval, perhaps with, centuries between, like a submarine  volcanic rift. In England the southeastern plain and the northwestern  uplands have been repeatedly arrayed against each other, from the Roman  conquest which embraced the lowlands up to about the 500-foot contour  line,[79] through the War of the Roses and the Civil War,[80] to the  struggle for the repeal of the Corn Laws and the great Reform Bill of  1832.[81] Though the boundary lines have been only roughly the same and  each district has contained opponents of the dominant local party,  nevertheless the geographic core has been plain enough.    [Sidenote: Political versus social geography.]    The land is a more conspicuous factor in the history of states than in  the history of society, but not more necessary and potent. Wars, which  constitute so large a part of political history, have usually aimed more  or less directly at acquisition or retention of territory; they have  made every petty quarrel the pretext for mulcting the weaker nation of  part of its land. Political maps are therefore subject to sudden and  radical alterations, as when France's name was wiped off the North  American continent in 1763, or when recently Spain's sovereignty in the  Western Hemisphere was obliterated. But the race stocks, languages,  customs, and institutions of both France and Spain remained after the  flags had departed. The reason is that society is far more deeply rooted  in the land than is a state, does not expand or contract its area so  readily. Society is always, in a sense, _adscripta glebae_; an expanding  state which incorporates a new piece of territory inevitably  incorporates its inhabitants, unless it exterminates or expels them. Yet  because racial and social geography changes slowly, quietly and  imperceptibly, like all those fundamental processes which we call  growth, it is not so easy and obvious a task to formulate a natural law  for the territorial relations of the various hunter, pastoral nomadic,  agricultural, and industrial types of society as for those of the  growing state.    [Sidenote: Land basis of society.]    Most systems of sociology treat man as if he were in some way detached  from the earth's surface; they ignore the land basis of society. The  anthropo-geographer recognizes the various social forces, economic and  psychologic, which sociologists regard as the cement of societies; but  he has something to add. He sees in the land occupied by a primitive  tribe or a highly organized state the underlying material bond holding  society together, the ultimate basis of their fundamental social  activities, which are therefore derivatives from the land. He sees the  common territory exercising an integrating force,--weak in primitive  communities where the group has established only a few slight and  temporary relations with its soil, so that this low social complex  breaks up readily like its organic counterpart, the low animal organism  found in an amoeba; he sees it growing stronger with every advance in  civilization involving more complex relations to the land,--with settled  habitations, with increased density of population, with a discriminating  and highly differentiated use of the soil, with the exploitation of  mineral resources, and finally with that far-reaching exchange of  commodities and ideas which means the establishment of varied  extra-territorial relations. Finally, the modern society or state has  grown into every foot of its own soil, exploited its every geographic  advantage, utilized its geographic location to enrich itself by  international trade, and when possible, to absorb outlying territories  by means of colonies. The broader this geographic base, the richer, more  varied its resources, and the more favorable its climate to their  exploitation, the more numerous and complex are the connections which  the members of a social group can establish with it, and through it with  each other; or in other words, the greater may be its ultimate  historical significance. The polar regions and the subtropical deserts,  on the other hand, permit man to form only few and intermittent  relations with any one spot, restrict economic methods to the lower  stages of development, produce only the small, weak, loosely organized  horde, which never evolves into a state so long as it remains in that  retarding environment.    [Sidenote: Morgan's Societas.]    Man in his larger activities, as opposed to his mere physiological or  psychological processes, cannot be studied apart from the land which he  inhabits. Whether we consider him singly or in a group--family, clan,  tribe or state--we must always consider him or his group in relation to  a piece of land. The ancient Irish sept, Highland clan, Russian mir,  Cherokee hill-town, Bedouin tribe, and the ancient Helvetian canton,  like the political state of history, have meant always a group of people  and a bit of land. The first presupposes the second. In all cases the  form and size of the social group, the nature of its activities, the  trend and limit of its development will be strongly influenced by the  size and nature of its habitat. The land basis is always present, in  spite of Morgan's artificial distinction between a theoretically  landless _societas_, held together only by the bond of common blood, and  the political _civitas_ based upon land.[82] Though primitive society  found its conscious bond in common blood, nevertheless the land bond was  always there, and it gradually asserted its fundamental character with  the evolution of society.    The savage and barbarous groups which in Morgan's classification would  fall under the head of _societas_ have nevertheless a clear conception  of their ownership of the tribal lands which they use in common. This  idea is probably of very primitive origin, arising from the association  of a group with its habitat, whose food supply they regard as a  monopoly.[83] This is true even of migratory hunting tribes. They claim a  certain area whose boundaries, however, are often ill-defined and  subject to fluctuations, because the lands are not held by permanent  occupancy and cultivation. An exceptional case is that of the Shoshone  Indians, inhabiting the barren Utah basin and the upper valleys of the  Snake and Salmon Rivers, who are accredited with no sense of ownership  of the soil. In their natural state they roved about in small, totally  unorganized bands or single families, and changed their locations so  widely, that they seemed to lay no claim to any particular portion. The  hopeless sterility of the region and its poverty of game kept its  destitute inhabitants constantly on the move to gather in the meager  food supply, and often restricted the social group to the family.[84]  Here the bond between land and tribe, and hence between the members of  the tribe, was the weakest possible.    [Sidenote: Land bond in hunter tribes.]    The usual type of tribal ownership was presented by the Comanches,  nomadic horse Indians who occupied the grassy plains of northern Texas.  They held their territory and the game upon it as the common property of  the tribe, and jealously guarded the integrity of their domain.[85] The  chief Algonquin tribes, who occupied the territory between the Ohio  River and the Great Lakes, had each its separate domain, within which it  shifted its villages every few years; but its size depended upon the  power of the tribe to repel encroachment upon its hunting grounds.  Relying mainly on the chase and fishing, little on agriculture, for  their subsistence, their relations to their soil were superficial and  transitory, their tribal organization in a high degree unstable.[86]  Students of American ethnology generally agree that most of the Indian  tribes east of the Mississippi were occupying definite areas at the time  of the discovery, and were to a considerable extent sedentary and  agricultural. Though nomadic within the tribal territory, as they moved  with the season in pursuit of game, they returned to their villages,  which were shifted only at relatively long intervals.[87]    The political organization of the native Australians, low as they were  in the social scale, seems to have been based chiefly on the claim of  each wretched wandering tribe to a definite territory.[88] In north  central Australia, where even a very sparse population has sufficed to  saturate the sterile soil, tribal boundaries have become fixed and  inviolable, so that even war brings no transfer of territory. Land and  people are identified. The bond is cemented by their primitive religion,  for the tribe's spirit ancestors occupied this special territory.[89] In  a like manner a very definite conception of tribal ownership of land  prevails among the Bushmen and Bechuanas of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15299"],[0,"Drake, Nelson and Napoleon (#15)"],[1,"d, his attachment to Hamilton was of an affectionate character,  even when many people believed he was betraying him. Whether Sir  William knew and believed that the association between his wife and  Nelson was pure or not,[6] he evidently desired that no one else  should believe it, for in a codicil to his will he bequeaths \"The copy  of Madam Le Brun's picture of his wife in enamel, and gives to his  dearest friend, Nelson, a very small token of the great regard he has  for his Lordship, the most virtuous, loyal, and truly brave character  I ever met with.\" Then he finishes up with God's blessing to him and  shame to those who do not say \"Amen.\" This is a wonderful testimony of  friendship from a man who had been wronged, and might well have shaken  the belief of those who founded their opinions on the startling  improprieties they had beheld between the man whom he designated \"the  most virtuous, loyal, and truly brave character he had ever met with\"  and his wife. That Sir William connived at what looked uncommonly like  infidelity may or may not be doubtful, but that he saw more than would  have impressed an ordinary man or woman with suspicion is  unquestionable, and the best that can be said for his attitude is that  he was so mentally constituted that he could only see or preferred to  see in Nelson's extravagant attentions to his wife a guileless symbol  of high friendship for her, which he took as a compliment to himself.  On the other hand, if he not only suspected but knew that he was being  betrayed, and bitterly resented the passion which no remonstrances  from him could have controlled, he at any rate determined to let the  world see \"how a Christian could die,\" and refrained from uttering the  unutterable. Napoleon on the rock at St. Helena acted in the same  magnanimous way towards the adulterous Marie Louise, of whose  faithlessness he also unguardedly let slip his opinion.    It is an odious habit, but we are apt to believe, without any reserve,  disparaging stories, that may or may not be true, concerning men of  distinction, and the more prominent the man or woman, the more  viciously the scandal-mongers pursue their contemptible occupation.  These vermin invariably belong to a class of industrious mediocrities  who have been born with a mental kink, and their treachery, falsehood,  and cowardice are incurable. They are merely hurtful creatures who  spoil the earth, and are to be found dolefully chattering about what  they conceive to be other men's and women's lapses from the paths of  stern virtue. Their plan of life is to defame other people, and by  this means proclaim their own superiority over other weak mortals.  Give the unsexed woman a chance, and she will let fly with  unrestrained industry. How many innocent people have had their names  dragged into the public gaze by this vice! The report may arise from  professional or political jealousy, and may grow into incredible  accusations of immorality. Who can estimate the suffering caused to  Lord Melbourne, the then Prime Minister, and to his relatives and  friends, and even to some of his political opponents, and to the Hon.  Mrs. Norton, one of Sheridan's beautiful daughters (who was the wife  of as unscrupulous a scamp as was ever permitted to live), by the  engineering of an accusation of infidelity that forced the Prime  Minister and Mrs. Norton into the Courts to defend themselves against  what was proved to be a malicious and unfounded story? The plaintiff's  case, resting as it did upon a tissue of fabricated evidence, takes a  fine place in history because of the judge's impartiality and  sagacious charge, and the verdict of the jury for the defendants which  was received with tumultuous cheers, characterized by the judge as  \"disgraceful in a court of justice.\" His Lordship's remonstrance was  futile, and again and again the cheers were given, both in the court  and outside, where the wildest enthusiasm prevailed. No one who took  part in this disgraceful action came out of it with a higher  reputation than Sir John Campbell, who acted for Melbourne. His  entrance to the House of Commons that night was the occasion of an  outburst of delirious cheering, the like of which had never been  witnessed in the House. \"The Tories\" are said to have \"affected to  cheer.\" I give this as a notable case whereby two innocent people were  threatened with ruin and disgrace by the poisonous slander circulated  for both private and political ends and fostered by the worthless  husband of a virtuous and amiable woman.    It is common knowledge that Nelson and Sir William Hamilton were  assailed by the same stinging wasps as Melbourne and Mrs. Norton (if  it be proper to make a comparison), but they were different types of  men living in a different atmosphere and under different  circumstances. It is true that Nelson had scruples about the unwisdom  of his unconventional connection with Lady Hamilton, and, big-hearted  fellow that he was, he would have struggled hard to avoid giving pain  to his relations and friends; and who knows that he did not? For  though his actions may belie that impression, his whole attitude was  reckless, silly, and whimsical. To whatever extent he may have had  scruples, he certainly did not possess the faculty of holding his  inclinations in check. Indeed, he made no secret of the idea that  \"every man became a bachelor after passing the Rock of Gibraltar,\" and  in this notion he carried out the orthodoxy of the old-time sailor.    He disliked marriage and loved glory, and being a popular hero, he was  forgiven all his amorous sins, which were by many looked upon as being  part of his heroism. His laughable efforts to obscure the facts might  have satisfied those who wished to rely on Hamilton's benedictory  absolution, had not Nelson and Emma, as I have already said, left  behind them incriminating letters and documents which leave no doubt  as to what they were to each other. The great Admiral industriously  destroyed much of the massive correspondence, but had overlooked some  of the hidden treasures. Lady Hamilton promised to destroy all hers,  but failed to do so. Hence the documentary proof written by his own  hand and that of Emma's cancels Nelson's childish device to throw a  too critical public off the scent.    Nelson was alternately weak, nervous, careless, and defiant in his  attitude in regard to public opinion concerning his private life. He  at one time asserted the right of living in any way he might choose,  and resented the criticism of a few cackling busybodies, even though  it was not in accordance with the views of the late Mr. Edward Cocker.  It was his affair, and if his ideas differed from those of his  critics, it was no business of theirs. His independence in this, as  well as in the practical concerns of his profession, coincided with  the opinions held by Sandy Mackay in \"Alton Locke,\" who declared that  he would \"never bow down to a bit of brains.\" But these independent  views alternated with weaker ones. He was as indiscreetly lavish with  his love as he was with his money; at one time he would contemptuously  defy the poisoned arrows that were darted at him, and when beset by  the sullen storm-cloud of scandal, he let fly with red-hot courage and  audaciously upheld his honour: at another time he was timid,  vacillating, and ridiculous in his attempts to avert the public eye  from his love affair and its consequence. People who knew him  intimately were aware that Horatia was his daughter, and in order to  throw them off their guard he proceeded to invent a cock-and-bull  story of how he came by the child. Here is his letter to Lady Hamilton  written in the middle of 1804: \"I am now going to state a thing to  you and to request your kind assistance which, from my dear Emma's  goodness of heart, I am sure of her acquiescence in. Before we left  Italy, I told you of the extraordinary circumstances of a child being  left to my care and protection. On your first coming to England, I  presented you the child, dear Horatia. You became, to my comfort,  attached to it, so did Sir William, thinking her the finest child he  had ever seen. She is become of that age when it is necessary to  remove her from a mere nurse, and to think of educating her. I am now  anxious for the child's being placed under your protecting wing\"; a  clumsy, transparent piece of foolery, which at once confirms its  intention to mislead! But we are saved the trouble of interpretation,  for the father goes on to write on another piece of note-paper, \"My  beloved, how I feel for your situation and that of our dear Horatia,  our dear child.\" It is almost incredible that Nelson could have  written such a silly fabrication. In the early part of 1804, Emma gave  birth to another child, of which he believed himself to be the father.  He asked the mother to call _him_ what she pleased (evidently he hoped  and expected a boy), but if a girl, it was to be named Emma. It was a  girl, so it was called after the mother, but it did not live long, and  the father never saw it.    As though he thought the letter written about little Miss Thompson  (Horatia, be it understood) were not sufficiently delusive, he sends  an equally absurd production to his niece, Charlotte Nelson, who  lived a good deal at Merton, in which he says that he is \"truly  sensible of her attachment to that dear little orphan, Horatia,\" and  although her parents are lost, yet she is not \"without a fortune; and  that he will cherish her to the last moment of his life, and _curse_  them who _curse_ her, and Heaven bless them who bless her.\" This  solemn enthusiasm for the poor orphan puts Nelson out of court as a  cute letter-writer. The quality of ingenious diplomacy had been left  entirely out of him, and like any one else who dallies with an art for  which they have no gift, he excites suspicions, and more often than  not discloses the very secret he is so"]]]
