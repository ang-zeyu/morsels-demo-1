So to-night it is, and don't you remind me of  my mother!\"    I was thinking of her when he spoke; for the song had swung through a  worthy refrain into another verse, and now I knew it better. It was  Catherine who had introduced me to all my lyrics; it was to Catherine I  had once hymned this one in my unformed heart.    \"But I thought,\" said I, as I forced myself to think, \"that everybody  went up to the _Cabane_ overnight, and started fresh from there in the  morning?\"    \"Most people do, but it's as broad as it's long,\" declared Bob, airily,  rapidly, and with the same unwonted excitement, born as I thought of  his unwonted enterprise. \"You have a ripping moonlight walk instead of a  so-called night's rest in a frowsy hut. We shall get our breakfast there  instead, and I expect to start fresher than if I had slept there and  been knocked up at two o'clock in the morning. That's all settled,  anyhow, and you can look for me on top through the telescope after  breakfast. I shall be back before dark, and then--\"    \"Well, what then?\" I asked, for Bob had made a significant and yet  irresolute pause, as though he could not quite bring himself to tell me  something that was on his mind.    \"Well,\" he echoed nonchalantly at last, as though he had not hesitated  at all, \"as a matter of fact, to-morrow night I am to know my fate. I  have asked Mrs. Lascelles to marry me, and she hasn't said no, but I am  giving her till to-morrow night. That's all, Clephane. I thought it a  fair thing to let you know. If you want to waltz in and try your luck  while I'm gone, there's nothing on earth to prevent you, and it might be  most satisfactory to everybody. As a matter of fact, I'm only going so  as to get over the time and keep out of the way.\"    \"As a matter of fact?\" I queried, waving a little stick toward the  lighted windows. \"Listen a minute, and then tell me!\"    And we listened together to the last and clearest rendering of the  refrain--      \"Then tell me how to woo thee, Love;      O tell me how to woo thee!    For thy dear sake, nae care I'll take,      Tho' ne'er another trow me!\"    \"What tosh!\" shouted Bob (his mother should have heard him) through the  applause. \"Of course I'm going to take care of myself, and of course I  meant to rush the Matterhorn while I'm here, but between ourselves  that's my only reason for rushing it to-night.\"    Yet had he no boyish vision of quick promotion in the lady's heart, no  primitive desire to show his mettle out of hand, to set her trembling  while he did or died? He had, I thought, and he had not; that shining  face could only have reflected a single and candid heart. But it is  these very natures, so simple and sweet-hearted and transparent, that  are least to be trusted on the subject of their own motives and  emotions, for they are the soonest deceived, not only by others but in  themselves. Or so I venture to think, and even then reflected, as I  shook my dear lad's hand by the side parapet of the moonlit terrace, and  watched him run down into the shadows of the fir-trees and so out of my  sight with two dark and stalwart figures that promptly detached  themselves from the shadows of the shoemaker's hut. A third figure  mounted to where I now sat listening to the easy, swinging, confident  steps, as they fell fainter and fainter upon the ear; it was the  shoemaker himself who had shod my two sticks with spikes and my boots  with formidable nails; and we exchanged a few words in a mixture of  languages which I should be very sorry to reproduce.    \"Do you know those two guides?\" is what I first asked in effect.    \"Very well, monsieur.\"    \"Are they good guides?\"    \"The very best, monsieur.\"          CHAPTER X    THE LAST WORD      \"Is that you?\"    It was an hour or so later, but still I sat ruminating upon the parapet,  within a yard or two of the spot where I had first accosted Bob Evers  and Mrs. Lascelles. I had retraced the little sequence of subsequent  events, paltry enough in themselves, yet of a certain symmetry and some  importance as a whole. I had attacked and defended my own conduct down  to that hour, when I ought to have been formulating its logical  conclusion, and during my unprofitable deliberations the night had aged  and altered (as it were) behind my back. There was no more music in the  drawing-room. There were no more people under the drawing-room windows.  The lights in all the lower windows were not what they had been; it was  the bedroom tiers that were illuminated now. But I did not realise that  there was less light outside until I awoke to the fact that Mrs.  Lascelles was peering tentatively toward me, and putting her question in  such an uncertain tone.    \"That depends who I am supposed to be,\" I answered, laughing as I rose  to put my personality beyond doubt.    \"How stupid of me!\" laughed Mrs. Lascelles in her turn, though rather  nervously to my fancy. \"I thought it was Mr. Evers!\"    I had hard work to suppress an exclamation. So he had not told her what  he was going to do, and yet he had not forbidden me to tell her. Poor  Bob was more subtle than I had supposed, but it was a simple subtlety, a  strange chord but still in key with his character as I knew it.    \"I am sorry to disappoint you,\" said I. \"But I am afraid you won't see  any more of Bob Evers to-night.\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Mrs. Lascelles, suspiciously.    \"I wonder he didn't tell you,\" I replied, to gain time in which to  decide how to make the best use of such an unforeseen opportunity.    \"Well, he didn't; so please will you, Captain Clephane?\"    \"Bob Evers,\" said I, with befitting gravity, \"is climbing the Matterhorn  at this moment.\"    \"Never!\"    \"At least he has started.\"    \"When did he start?\"    \"An hour or more ago, with a couple of guides.\"    \"He told you, then?\"    \"Only just as he was starting.\"    \"Was it a sudden idea?\"    \"More or less, I think.\"    I waited for the next question, but that was the last of them. Just then  the interloping cloud floated clear of the moon, and I saw that my  companion was wrapped up as on the earlier night, in the same  unconventional combination of rain-coat and golf-cape; but now the hood  hung down, and the sudden rush of moonlight showed me a face as full of  sheer perplexity and annoyance as I could have hoped to find it, and as  free from deeper feeling.    \"The silly boy!\" exclaimed Mrs. Lascelles at last. \"I suppose it really  is pretty safe, Captain Clephane?\"    \"Safer than most dangerous things, I believe; and they are the safest,  as you know, because you take most care. He has a couple of excellent  guides; the chance of getting them was partly why he went. In all human  probability we shall have him back safe and sound, and fearfully pleased  with himself, long before this time to-morrow. Meanwhile, Mrs.  Lascelles,\" I continued with the courage of my opportunity, \"it is a  very good chance for me to speak to you about our friend Bob. I have  wanted to do so for some little time.\"    \"Have you, indeed?\" said Mrs. Lascelles, coldly.    \"I have,\" I answered imperturbably; \"and if it wasn't so late I should  ask for a hearing now.\"    \"Oh, let us get it over, by all means!\"    But as she spoke Mrs. Lascelles glanced over the shoulder that she  shrugged so contemptuously, toward the lights in the bedroom windows,  most of which were wide open.    \"We could walk toward the zig-zags,\" I suggested. \"There is a seat  within a hundred yards, if you don't think it too cold to sit, but in  any case I needn't keep you many minutes. Bob Evers,\" I continued, as my  suggestion was tacitly accepted, \"paid me the compliment of confiding in  me somewhat freely before he started on this hare-brained expedition of  his.\"    \"So it appears.\"    \"Ah, but he didn't only tell me what he was going to do; he told me why  he was doing it,\" said I, as we sauntered on our way side by side. \"It  was difficult to believe,\" I added, when I had waited long enough for  the question upon which I had reckoned.    \"Indeed?\"    \"He said he had proposed to you.\"    And again I waited, but never a word.    \"That child!\" I added with deliberate scorn.    But a further pause was broken only by my companion's measured steps and  my own awkward shuffle.    \"That baby!\" I insisted.    \"Did you tell him he was one, Captain Clephane?\" asked Mrs. Lascelles,  dryly, but drawn so far at last.    \"I spared his feelings. But can it be true, Mrs. Lascelles?\"    \"It is true.\"    \"Is it a fact that you didn't give him a definite answer?\"    \"I don't know what business it is of yours,\" said Mrs. Lascelles,  bluntly; \"and since he seems to have told you everything, neither do I  know why you should ask me. However, it is quite true that I did not  finally refuse him on the spot.\"    This carefully qualified confirmation should have afforded me abundant  satisfaction. I was over-eager in the matter, however, and I cried out  impetuously:    \"But you will?\"    \"Will what?\"    \"Refuse the boy!\"    We had reached the seat, but neither of us sat down. Mrs. Lascelles  appeared to be surveying me with equal resentment and defiance. I, on  the other hand, having shot my bolt, did my best to look conciliatory.    \"Why should I refuse him?\" she asked at length, with less emotion and  more dignity than her bearing had led me to expect. \"You seem so sure  about it, you know!\"    \"He is such a boy--such an utter child--as I said just now.\" I was  conscious of the weakness of saying it again, and it alone, but my  strongest arguments were too strong for direct statement.    This one, however, was not unfruitful in the end.    \"And I,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, \"how old do you think I am? Thirty-five?\"    \"Of course not,\" I replied, with obvious gallantry. \"But I doubt if Bob  is even twenty.\"    \"Well, then, you won't believe me, but I was married before I was his  age, and I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11204"],[0,"Diseases of the Horse's Foot (#15)"],[1,"in front of the fore-limbs,  and, by placing a hand on the rope passing round the arm, prevent the line  from slipping below the knee.    By this means the hind-limb is pulled forward until the foot projects  beyond the cannon of the front-limb. When that position is reached, the  operator grasps the hock firmly with one hand, and, directing the side-line  to be slackened, gently slides downward the coils of rope round the arm  and thigh until they encircle the cannons of both limbs. The cannon of the  hind-limb is firmly lashed to the cannon of the fore, and the foot firmly  and securely fixed in the best position for operating (see Fig. 44).    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--PHOTOGRAPH SHOWING THE NEAR HIND-FOOT SECURED UPON  THE CANNON OF THE NEAR FORE-LIMB.]    Similarly, with the horse still on his off side, the off hind-limb may be  fixed to the near fore, and the near fore and the off fore to the near  hind.    With the animal on his near side, we may fix the near hind and the off hind  to the off fore, and the off fore and near fore to the near hind.    The points to be remembered in fixing the limbs thus are: (1) The side-line  should always commence upon the cannon of the limb to be operated on; (2)  it should next pass under and over (or over and under, it is immaterial  which) first the arm and then the thigh, or the thigh and the arm, as the  case may be; (3) in every case, whether rounding the thigh and the arm from  above or below, the piece of rope completing the round should always finish  below that portion preceding it, so that traction upon it from behind the  animal's back should tend to keep all portions of it from slipping below  the knee and the hock.    With the uppermost fore-limb secured to the hind-limb in the manner we have  described, we have the underneath fore-limb suitably exposed for both the  higher and lower operations of neurectomy. The position for this operation  will be made better still if the lowermost limb (the one to be operated on)  is removed from the hobbles and drawn forward by an assistant by means of a  piece of rope fastened to the pastern.    Taking what we have described as a general guide, other modifications of  thus securing the foot will suggest themselves to the operator to meet the  special requirements of the case with which he is dealing.    Regarding the administration of chloroform, no description of the method  is needed here, as it will be found fully detailed in most good works on  general surgery. Where great immobility is needed, it is one of the most  valuable means of restraint we have. Apart from that, its use in any  serious operation is always to be advocated, if only on the score of humane  consideration for the dumb animal helpless under our hands.      B. INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED.    In addition to those required for operations on the softer structures--such  as scalpels, forceps, artery forceps, directors, scissors, etc.--the  surgery of the foot demands instruments specially adapted for dealing with  the horn.    A great deal will depend upon the operator as to whether these are few or  many. The average man of resource will deem a smith's rasp and one or two  strong drawing-knives amply sufficient, and on no account should they be  omitted from the list of those ready to hand.    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--THE ORDINARY DRAWING-KNIFE.]    The ordinary smith's drawing-knife (Fig. 45) is well known to almost  everyone, and is well suited for much of the rougher part of the work.  The careful following up of pricks, however, and some of the more special  operations demanding removal of portions of the lateral cartilages call for  instruments of a more delicate character and peculiar construction. These  are to be found in the so-called sage-knife, and the modern (French)  pattern of drawing-knife.    [Illustration: FIG. 46. _a, b_, Modern forms of drawing-knife; _c, d, e_,  sage-knives.]    The modern drawing-knife differs from the smith's instrument in being  attached to a straight, instead of a curved, handle, and in usually being  sharp on both edges instead of only on one. These are made in various sizes  (Fig. 46, _a, b_), and the blades flat, curved on the flat, or curved at an  angle with the edges of the haft.    The sage-knife, as its name indicates, is a knife with a lanceolate-shaped  blade. These also may be obtained in varying forms and sizes (Fig. 46, _c,  d, e_). Fig. 46, _c_, is a single-edged, right-handed sage-knife. Fig.  46, _d_, is a left-handed instrument of the same type. The double-edged  sage-knife is represented in Fig. 46, _e_.    [Illustration: FIG. 47.--SYMES'S ABSCESS-KNIFE.]    It may be mentioned too, in passing, that the ordinary Symes's  abscess-knife (Fig. 47) is a most useful instrument when performing the  operation of partial excision of the lateral cartilages, its peculiar shape  lending itself admirably to the niceties of the operation.    One or two good-shaped firing-irons will also be found useful. They will  lighten the labour of tediously excavating grooves with the knife,  where that procedure is necessary; and, used in certain positions to be  afterwards described, will afford just that necessary degree of stimulus to  the horn-secreting structures of the foot, which the use of the knife alone  will not.    The man in country practice will also be well advised in carrying to every  foot case a compact outfit, such as that carried by the smith. This will  consist of hammer and pincers, drawing-knife and buffer. Much valuable time  is then often saved which would otherwise be wasted in driving round for  the nearest smith.    There are other special operations requiring the use of specially-devised  instruments for their successful carrying out. These we shall mention when  we come to a consideration of the operations in which they are necessary.      C. THE APPLICATION OF DRESSINGS.    One of the most common methods of applying a dressing to the foot is  poulticing. Usually resorted to on account of its warmth-retaining  properties, the poultice may also be medicated. In fact, a poultice,  strongly impregnated with perchloride of mercury or other powerful  antiseptic, is a useful dressing in a case of a punctured foot, or a  wise preliminary to an operation involving the wounding of the deeper  structures. The poultice may consist of any material that serves to retain  heat for the longest time. Meal of any kind that contains a fair percentage  of oil is suitable. Crushed linseed, linseed and bran, or linseed-cake dust  are among the best.    To prepare it, all that is necessary is to partly fill a bucket with the  material and pour upon it boiling water. The hot mass is emptied into a  suitable bag, at the bottom of which it is wise to first place a thin layer  of straw, in order to prevent the bag wearing through, and then secured  round the foot. This is generally done by means of a piece of stout cord,  or by straps and buckles fastened round the pastern and above the fetlock.    An improved method of fastening has been devised by Lieutenant-Colonel  Nunn:    'A thin rope or stout piece of cord about 5 feet long is doubled in two,  and a knot tied at the double end so as to form a loop about 5 or 6 inches  long, this length depending on the size of the foot (as at A, Fig. 48). The  poultice or other dressing is applied to the foot, and the cloth wrapped  round in the ordinary way, the loop of the cord being placed at the back of  the pastern (as in A, Fig. 49); the ends of the cord are passed round, one  on the inside and the other on the outside, towards the front (as in B,  Fig. 49). These ends are then twined together down as far as the toe (see C  in Fig. 49). The foot is now lifted up, and the ends of the cord (CC, Fig.  49), are passed through the loop A (as at D, Fig. 49), and then drawn  tight. The ends of the cord are now separated, and carried up to the  coronet (as at EE, Fig. 49), one on the outside, the other on the inside of  the foot. They are then again twisted round each other once or twice (as at  F, Fig. 50), and are passed round the pastern once or twice on each side.  They are now passed under the cord (E, Fig. 49), and then reversed, so  as to tighten up E, and are finally tied round the pastern in the usual  manner. The arrangement of the cords on the sole is shown in Fig. 51, which  is a view from the posterior part.    [Illustration: FIGS. 48, 49, 50, 51.--ILLUSTRATING LIEUTENANT-COLONEL  NUNN'S METHOD OF APPLYING A POULTICE TO THE FOOT.]    'The advantages of this method of fastening have been found to be: (1) It  does not chafe the skin; (2) if properly applied it has never been known  to come undone; (3) it is the only way we know that a poultice can be  satisfactorily applied to a mule's hind-foot; (4) horses can be exercised  when the poultice is on the foot, which is almost impossible with the  ordinary leather boot; (5) the sacking or canvas does not cut through so  quickly.'    [Illustration: FIGS. 52, 53.--TWO FORMS OF POULTICE-BOOT.]    A further method of applying the poultice is by using one of the  poultice-boots made for that purpose (see Figs. 52 and 53).    These have an objection. They are apt to be allowed to get extremely dirty,  and so, by carrying infective matter from the foot of one animal to that of  another, undo the good that the warmth of the poultice is bringing about.  The advantage of the ordinary sacking or canvas is that it may be cast  aside after the application of each poultice. Where the boot is kept clean,  however, it will save a great deal of time and trouble to the attendant.    While on the subject of poulticing, it is well to remark that in many cases  it may be more advantageous to supply the necessary warmth and moisture to  the foot by keeping it immersed in a narrow tub of water maintained at the  required temperature. By this means the warmth is carried further up the  limb (sometimes an important point), and the water"]]]
