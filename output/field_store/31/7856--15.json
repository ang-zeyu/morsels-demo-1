To determine  was to achieve, in one possessed of his powers of mind and matchless  energy. The singularity of his bearing was very remarkable, and as  he lost no opportunity of rendering it conspicuous, it soon attracted  observation, which was all that was necessary for the discovery of the  extraordinary intellectual powers which he possessed. Thus recommended  by his superior abilities, his advancement was rapid. Before he was  twenty-nine he was a lieutenant-colonel. His reliance on his own  unaided powers was so entire, that he could ill brook the thought of  considering himself bound by obedience to any one. When speaking at a  later period on the subject, he said, \"When my sovereign does me the  honor to give me the command of her armies, she supposes me capable  of guiding them to victory; and how can she pretend to know better  than an old soldier like myself, who am on the spot, the road which  leads to it? So, whenever her orders are in opposition to her true  interests, I take it for granted that they are suggested by the enmity  of her courtiers, and I act in conformity to what appears to me most  conducive to her glory.\" On some occasions he acted in accordance  with this declaration, and on a very remarkable one showed that he  was justified in the dependence which he had on his own judgment; but  whether his acting on it was defensible, must be left to the martinets  to determine. In the year 1771, during the campaign, when he held the  rank of major-general, he found that the Grand Marshal of Lithuania  was assembling the Poles at Halowitz, of which he directly apprised  the commander-in-chief, Marshal Boutourlin, and demanded leave to  attack them. Boutourlin, who was a cautious man, thought such a risk  should not be attempted, as Suwarrow had but a few hundred men under  him, and therefore decidedly forbade any attack. At the same time,  an account reached Suwarrow that the Regiment of Petersburgh had just  been beaten by the Poles, whose numbers amounted to five thousand men,  and were increasing every day. Fired by the intelligence, he at once  determined on action, and advanced at the head of a thousand men to  the attack. Every danger but excited him to additional exertion. In  four days he marched fifty leagues, surprised the Poles at dead of  night, and beat and dispersed them. He took the town of Halowitz  and twelve pieces of cannon. His victory was complete, but he had  disobeyed orders; and according to all rules of military discipline  he deserved punishment. It was thus he announced his success to the  commander of the army:        \"As a soldier I have disobeyed--I ought to be punished--I have      sent you my sword; but as a Russian I have done my duty in      destroying the Confederate forces, which we could not have      resisted had they been left time to unite.\"    Boutourlin was in the utmost astonishment, and quite at a loss what  steps he should take. He laid Suwarrow's extraordinary dispatch before  the Empress, and requested her orders as to the manner in which he  should act. Catharine lost no time in addressing Suwarrow:        \"Your commander, Marshal Boutourlin, ought to put you under      arrest, to punish military insubordination. As your sovereign,      I reserve to myself the pleasure of rewarding a faithful      subject, who by a splendid action has well served his      country.\"    The Order of St. Alexander accompanied this gracious letter. Never was  commander more loved by his soldiers than Suwarrow. Like Napoleon,  he shared their hardships and privations as well as their dangers. He  would often pass the cold winter nights in their bivouac and partake  of their humble fare. In every difficulty he kept up their spirits by  his alacrity and cheerfulness. However tinctured with superstition, he  had deep devotional feelings; and it is stated that he never went to  battle without offering up a prayer, and that it was his first and  last occupation every day. Often when provisions were failing he would  order a fast to be observed by the troops, as a token of humiliation  for their sins: and he always set the example of the prescribed  abstinence himself. The noble self-denial which made him scorn any  care for himself which was beyond the reach of the common soldiers, so  thoroughly identified him with them, that all their tender sympathies  were with him, as much as their respect and veneration. He was never  seen on the long and heavy marches of his infantry but on foot by  their side; and in every advance of his cavalry he was at their head  on horseback. He worked indefatigably with them in the trenches, and  in all their military operations. When the war broke out afresh with  the Turks in the year 1785, he was surprised in the town of Kenburn by  an advance of a great body of Osmanli horse; his troops were scattered  through the adjacent country, and could not be brought together  without great difficulty--a successful attack had been made upon  one his generals. When the news was brought to him he betrayed no  agitation, but instantly repaired to the church, where he directed  that a _Te Deum_ should be chanted as for a victory. This he might  have done to show his firm trust in the prophesied success of the  Russian arms, even under discouragement. He joined in the chant with  animated fervor. As soon as the service was over he placed himself a  the head of a small body of troops which were in waiting, and hastened  to meet the enemy, who were coming on in considerable force. By a  most desperate onset he drove them back, but in the engagement he was  wounded; and his soldiers, no longer animated by his presence, became  disheartened, and fled in confusion. Suwarrow leaped from the litter  in which he was carried--all bleeding and wounded as he was--and  springing on horseback, exclaimed, \"I am still alive, my children!\"  This was the rallying cry--he led them on to victory.    Of all the brilliant achievements of Suwarrow, there was none more  wonderful than the conquest of Ismail. It had stood out against two  sieges, and was considered almost impregnable. The Empress, provoked  at its not having yielded, gave an absolute order that it should  be taken. Potemkin, who was then at the head of the Russian army,  dreaded Catharine's displeasure should she be disappointed the third  time. In his embarrassment he consulted with Suwarrow, who undertook  the conduct of the siege. Notwithstanding the great danger of an  enterprise which had failed twice, he felt confident of success; and  said, with earnest faith in the result, \"The Empress wills it--we must  obey!\"    After a forced march of four days he reached Ismail at the head of  his troops. A few days were spent in the preparations necessary for  an assault. When all was ready, orders were given: the column marched  forward at midnight. At that moment a courier rode up at full speed  with dispatches from Potemkin. Suwarrow was no sooner apprised of his  arrival than he guessed with his usual quickness the nature of the  dispatches, and he determined not to receive them till the fate of  the enterprise was decided. He ordered his horse to be brought round  to the door of his tent; he sprang on it and galloped off, without  seeming to observe the courier. After a desperate resistance the Turks  at length gave way, and Ismail fell into the hands of the Russians.  With his staff gathered eagerly round Suwarrow to offer their  congratulations, the eyes of the Marshal fell upon the officer who  bore the dispatches.    \"Who are you, brother?\" said he.    \"It is I,\" replied the courier, \"who brought dispatches from Prince  Potemkin yesterday evening.\"    \"What!\" exclaimed Suwarrow, with affected passion,--\"what! you bring  me news from my sovereign!--you have been here since yesterday, and  I have not yet received the dispatches!\" Then threatening the officer  for his negligence, he handed the dispatch to one of his generals and  bade him read it aloud.    A more striking scene can scarcely be conceived. There was deep  silence as the dispatch was opened. Suwarrow and his companions in  victory listened with breathless interest. Every danger which they  had braved and surmounted was enumerated one after the other. It was  urged that an enterprise undertaken in the midst of a winter even more  than usually severe, must be disastrous, and that it was absolutely  preposterous to think it possible to make an impression on a fortress  furnished with 230 pieces of cannon and defended by 43,000 men, the  half of whom were Janissaries, with a force that amounted to no more  than 28,000--little more than half their number. The dispatch ended  with a peremptory order for the abandonment of the enterprise.    \"Thank God!\" exclaimed Suwarrow, as soon as the general had ceased  reading, raising his eyes to heaven and crossing himself with  devotion, \"thank God, Ismail is taken, or I should have been undone!\"    There was silence for a moment, as if all participated in the feeling  with which Suwarrow glanced at the different situation which would  have been his had he not succeeded; every eye was fixed on him, and  then a sudden shout of triumph burst through all the ranks. He then  penned the following brief reply: \"The Russian flag flies on the  ramparts of Ismail.\"    It is not to our purpose to follow the victorious steps of Suwarrow  through the campaigns in which he was engaged; they are now a part  of history, and won for him that military glory after which his heart  panted from his early boyhood. Decoration after decoration, honor  after honor: title after title, marked the high estimation in which  the services of this intrepid soldier were held by his sovereign;  and never did ruler dispense favors with a more munificent hand than  Catharine. What most attracted us, and from which we most wished to  make a selection, were those characteristic traits which brought us in  a manner"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12984"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions — Volume 1 (#15)"],[1,"counsels of Mr. Gray, set out to see the world, and they saw  it just as far as Eugene's cash and the balance of that $8,000 would  go.    In his \"Auto-Analysis,\" Field says: \"In 1872 I visited Europe,  spending six months and my patrimony in France, Italy, Ireland, and  England.\" This is as near the sober truth as anything Field ever wrote  about himself. The youthful spendthrift and his companion landed in  Ireland, and by slow, but extravagant, stages reached Italy, taking  the principal cities and sights of England and France en route. About  the only letters that reached America from Field during this European  trip (always excepting those that went by every mail-steamer to a  young lady in St. Jo) were those addressed with business-like brevity  to Mr. Gray, calling for more and still more funds to carry the  travellers onward. Before they had reached Italy the mails were too  slow to convey Field's importunity, and he had recourse to the cable  to impress Mr. Gray with the dire immediateness of his impecuniosity.  In order to relieve this Mr. Gray was forced to discount the notes for  the deferred payments on the sale of the Field land, and when Eugene  and his brother-in-law-to-be reached Naples their soulful appeals for  more currency with which to continue their golden girdle of the earth  were met with the chilling notice \"No funds available.\" Happily, in  their meteoric transit across Europe, they had invested in many  articles of vertu and convertible souvenirs of the places they had  visited. By the sale, or sometimes by the pledge, of these accumulated  impedimenta of travel, Eugene made good his retreat to America, where  he landed with empty pockets and an inexhaustible fund of mirthful  stories and invaluable experience.    On arriving in New York, Field had to seek the Western Union Telegraph  office to secure funds for the necessary transportation to St. Louis.  These Mr. Gray furnished so liberally that Eugene promptly invested  the surplus in a French poodle, which he carried in triumph back to  Missouri as a memento of his sojourn in Paris. This costly pet, the  sole exhibit of his foreign travel, he named McSweeny, in memory, I  suppose, of the pleasant days he had spent in Ireland.    [Illustration: MRS. MELVIN L. GRAY.]    Years afterward I remember to have been with Field when he opened a  package containing a watch, which for more than a decade had been an  unredeemed witness to his triumphant entry into and impecunious exit  from Naples or Florence--I forget which.    Mrs. Below, Field's sister-in-law, in her little brochure, \"Eugene  Field in His Home,\" preserves a letter written by him from Rome to a  friend in Ireland, in which may be traced the bent of his mind to take  a whimsical view of all things coming within the range of his  observation. In this he bids farewell to political discussion:      For since the collapse of the Greeley and Brown movement I have given    over all hope of rescuing my torn and bleeding country from Grant and    his minions, and have resolved to have nothing more to do with    politics. Methinks, my country will groan to hear this declaration!    And there is the following description of how he was enjoying himself  in Italy, with the last remittances of his patrimony growing fewer and  painfully less:      We have been two months in Nice and a month or so travelling in    Italy. Two weeks we passed in Naples, and a most delightful place we    found it. Its natural situation is simply charming, though the    climate is said to be very unhealthy. I climbed Vesuvius and peered    cautiously into the crater. It was a glorious sight--nothing else    like it in the world! Such a glorious smell of brimstone! Such    enlivening whiffs of hot steam and sulphuric fumes! Then too the    grand veil of impenetrable white smoke that hung over the yawning    abyss! No wonder people rave about this crater and no wonder poor    Pliny lost his life coming too near the fascinating monster. The    ascent of Vesuvius is no mean undertaking, and I advise all American    parents to train their children especially for it by drilling them    daily upon their backyard ash-heaps.    His descent of Vesuvius was made \"upon a dead run,\" and he \"astonished  the natives by my [his] celerity and recklessness.\"    This letter was written on Washington's birthday, 1873, and in later  years the omission of any reference to the anniversary would have  thrown suspicion on its genuineness; but Field had not yet begun to  reckon life by anniversaries. Neither is there in it a shadow of the  impending crisis in his finances nor a suggestion of another reason  that robbed his return voyage of all distressing thoughts of retreat.          CHAPTER VII    MARRIAGE AND EARLY DOMESTIC LIFE      And now I come to that event in the life of Eugene Field which has  naturally attracted the widest interest among all who have delighted  in his written tributes to womankind and mother love. In his memorial  to Mrs. Gray, Field has given expression to his special reverence for  the love between parent and child. \"For my dear mother,\" he wrote,  \"went from me so many years ago that when I come to speak of the  blessedness of a mother's love, I hardly know whereof I speak, it is  all so far, so very far away, and withal so precious, so sacred a  thing.\" This note recurs constantly through his writings, and it is  not to be wondered at that the love of a man for a woman should have  come early to a youth whose heart had always felt the yearning for  something more tender and personal than the utmost kindness of those  upon whose affections others had equal or greater claims.    Through his boyhood and school days, Field's affection for the  petticoated sex had been tempered by an irresistible impulse to tease  all the daughters of Eve. It is doubtful if his affections were ever  more seriously engaged by the girls of Amherst or the young ladies of  Williams and Knox than was his attention by the regular studies of  school or college. He came to both in his own way and time; with the  difference that when he once felt the touch of the inevitable maiden's  hand in his, he responded with an immediate ardor far different from  the slow and eccentric manner in which he wooed the love of  scholarship and letters.    It was while a junior at the University of Missouri that Eugene Field  made the acquaintance of Edgar V. Comstock, the sharer of the European  trip and experiences. Now Edgar's parents lived at St. Joseph, and  with them five sisters, the Misses Ida, Carrie, Georgia, Julia  Sutherland, and Gussie Comstock, and the fairest of them all was  Julia, albeit, at the time her brother was in college, she was still  in short dresses. What more natural than that Edgar's elder sisters  should visit him during his college term and there meet and be  attracted by the gaunt, yet already unique and striking, figure of  Eugene Field, the most unscholarly student and most incorrigible wag  in Columbia? Julia was too young at this time, in the estimation of  her sisters, to travel so far from St. Jo. Besides, what interest  would a little girl in short skirts take in the grave and intellectual  life of the brother and his undergraduate friends?    Out of the friendship of Eugene and Edgar and the visit of Edgar's  sisters to Columbia, fate was weaving a web for the unsuspecting  subject of this narrative which was not to be denied or altered by  leaving little Julia to rusticate at home like another pretty little  Cinderella. But this is not a fairy tale. It has no prince or glass  slippers or pumpkin coaches, with which Field's fancy could have  invested it. When the two friends separated on Commencement Day, after  Field had delivered an oration that impressed Miss Ida (Mrs. Below),  because of \"his pale face and deep voice,\" a promise had been extorted  that he would visit the Comstocks in their home in St. Joseph.    In the usual course of human events nothing further of concern to us  would have come from the exchange of these common civilities of  student life. Edgar would have returned to his home and forgotten  Eugene, and Eugene would have gone his way and never known that Edgar  had a younger sister Julia sitting at the gate awaiting the coming of  her prince. But shortly after returning to St. Louis, Field was  inspired by his natural roving restlessness--the French call it  Fate--to run clear across the state of Missouri, some three hundred  miles, to see what kind of a town St. Joseph was and incidentally to  visit his college friend. Nearly twenty years later, in the gathering  gloom of a rented apartment in London, the still-constant lover wrote  of what happened when he first saw \"Saint Jo, Buchanan County,\" in the  early seventies. There he first met \"the brown-eyed maiden\" of his  song, the Julia of numberless valentines that ran the gamut of grave  and gay through the intervening years, the heroine of frequent drives  which they \"snailed along,\" as their proper horse went slow,      _In those leafy aisles, where Cupid smiles      In Lover's Lane, Saint Jo._           *       *       *       *       *      _Ah! sweet the hours of springtime      When the heart inclines to woo,    And it's deemed all right for the callow wight      To do what he wants to do._    In his \"Auto-Analysis\" Field says, \"I favor early marriage.\" Even if  Edgar Comstock's elder sisters had known this, it is doubtful whether  the thought would have crossed their minds that their brother's chum  of twenty-one would overlook their more mature charms (they were all  fair to look upon), to be more than gracious to their fourteen-year-old  sister. Time out of mind sophisticated sisters of sixteen and eighteen  have regarded younger sisters as altogether out of the sphere of those  attentions which find their echo in wedding bells, only to awake some  bright morning to find the child a woman and the attentive friend an"]]]
