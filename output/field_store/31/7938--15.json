The lengths of the wing, tail, and other parts are then laid  down, and the diagram thus exhibits at a glance the comparative  variation of these parts in every specimen as well as the actual amount  of variation in the twenty specimens; and we are thus enabled to arrive  at some important conclusions.    We note, first, that the variations of none of the parts follow the  variations of the body, but are sometimes almost in an opposite  direction. Thus the longest wing corresponds to a rather small body, the  longest tail to a medium body, while the longest leg and toes belong to  only a moderately large body. Again, even related parts do not  constantly vary together but present many instances of independent  variation, as shown by the want of parallelism in their respective  variation-lines. In No. 5 (see Fig. 4) the wing is very long, the tail  moderately so; while in No. 6 the wing is much shorter while the tail is  considerably longer. The tarsus presents comparatively little variation;  and although the three toes may be said to vary in general together,  there are many divergencies; thus, in passing from No. 9 to No. 10, the  outer toe becomes longer, while the hind toe becomes considerably  shorter; while in Nos. 3 and 4 the middle toe varies in an opposite way  to the outer and the hind toes.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Cardinalis virginianus. 31 Males.]    In the next diagram (Fig. 5) we have the variations in forty males of  the Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaeus phoeniceus), and here we see the same  general features. One-fifth of the whole number of specimens offer a  large amount of variation either below or above the mean; while the  wings, tail, and head vary quite independently of the body. The wing and  tail too, though showing some amount of correlated variation, yet in  no less than nine cases vary in opposite directions as compared with the  preceding species.    The next diagram (Fig. 6), showing the variations of thirty-one males of  the Cardinal bird (Cardinalis virginianus), exhibits these features much  more strongly. The amount of variation in proportion to the size of the  bird is very much greater; while the variations of the wing and tail not  only have no correspondence with that of the body but very little with  each other. In no less than twelve or thirteen instances they vary in  opposite directions, while even where they correspond in direction the  amount of the variation is often very disproportionate.    As the proportions of the tarsi and toes of birds have great influence  on their mode of life and habits and are often used as specific or even  generic characters, I have prepared a diagram (Fig. 7) to show the  variation in these parts only, among twenty specimens of each of four  species of birds, four or five of the most variable alone being given.  The extreme divergence of each of the lines in a vertical direction  shows the actual amount of variation; and if we consider the small  length of the toes of these small birds, averaging about three-quarters  of an inch, we shall see that the variation is really very large; while  the diverging curves and angles show that each part varies, to a great  extent, independently. It is evident that if we compared some thousands  of individuals instead of only twenty, we should have an amount of  independent variation occurring each year which would enable almost any  modification of these important organs to be rapidly effected.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Variation of Tarsus and Toes.]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Variation of Birds in Leyden Museum.]    In order to meet the objection that the large amount of variability here  shown depends chiefly on the observations of one person and on the birds  of a single country, I have examined Professor Schlegel's Catalogue of  the Birds in the Leyden Museum, in which he usually gives the range of  variation of the specimens in the museum (which are commonly less than a  dozen and rarely over twenty) as regards some of their more important  dimensions. These fully support the statement of Mr. Allen, since they  show an equal amount of variability when the numbers compared are  sufficient, which, however, is not often the case. The accompanying  diagram exhibits the actual differences of size in five organs which  occur in five species taken almost at random from this catalogue. Here,  again, we perceive that the variation is decidedly large, even among a  very small number of specimens; while the facts all show that there is  no ground whatever for the common assumption that natural species  consist of individuals which are nearly all alike, or that the  variations which occur are \"infinitesimal\" or even \"small.\"      _The proportionate Number of Individuals which present a considerable  amount of Variation._    The notion that variation is a comparatively exceptional phenomenon, and  that in any case considerable variations occur very rarely in proportion  to the number of individuals which do not vary, is so deeply rooted that  it is necessary to show by every possible method of illustration how  completely opposed it is to the facts of nature. I have therefore  prepared some diagrams in which each of the individual birds measured is  represented by a spot, placed at a proportionate distance, right and  left, from the median line accordingly as it varies in excess or defect  of the mean length as regards the particular part compared. As the  object in this set of diagrams is to show the number of individuals  which vary considerably in proportion to those which vary little or not  at all, the scale has been enlarged in order to allow room for placing  the spots without overlapping each other.    In the diagram opposite twenty males of Icterus Baltimore are  registered, so as to exhibit to the eye the proportionate number of  specimens which vary, to a greater or less amount, in the length of the  tail, wing, tarsus, middle toe, hind toe, and bill. It will be noticed  that there is usually no very great accumulation of dots about the  median line which shows the average dimensions, but that a considerable  number are spread at varying distances on each side of it.    In the next diagram (Fig. 10), showing the variation among forty males  of Agelaeeus phoeniceus, this approach to an equable spreading of the  variations is still more apparent; while in Fig. 12, where fifty-eight  specimens of Cardinalis virginianus are registered, we see a remarkable  spreading out of the spots, showing in some of the characters a tendency  to segregation into two or more groups of individuals, each varying  considerably from the mean.    [Illustration: FIG. 9]    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    In order fully to appreciate the teaching of these diagrams, we must  remember, that, whatever kind and amount of variations are exhibited by  the few specimens here compared, would be greatly extended and brought  into symmetrical form if large numbers--thousands or millions--were  subjected to the same process of measurement and registration. We know,  from the general law which governs variations from a mean value, that  with increasing numbers the range of variation of each part would  increase also, at first rather rapidly and then more slowly; while gaps  and irregularities would be gradually filled up, and at length the  distribution of the dots would indicate a tolerably regular curve of  double curvature like those shown in Fig. 11. The great divergence of  the dots, when even a few specimens are compared, shows that the curve,  with high numbers, would be a flat one like the lower curve in the  illustration here given. This being the case it would follow that a very  large proportion of the total number of individuals constituting a  species would diverge considerably from its average condition as regards  each part or organ; and as we know from the previous diagrams of  variation (Figs. 1 to 7) that each part varies to a considerable extent,  _independently_, the materials constantly ready for natural selection to  act upon are abundant in quantity and very varied in kind. Almost any  combination of variations of distinct parts will be available, where  required; and this, as we shall see further on, obviates one of the most  weighty objections which have been urged against the efficiency of  natural selection in producing new species, genera, and higher groups.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]      _Variation in the Mammalia._    Owing to the generally large size of this class of animals, and the  comparatively small number of naturalists who study them, large series  of specimens are only occasionally examined and compared, and thus the  materials for determining the question of their variability in a state  of nature are comparatively scanty. The fact that our domestic animals  belonging to this group, especially dogs, present extreme varieties not  surpassed even by pigeons and poultry among birds, renders it almost  certain that an equal amount of variability exists in the wild state;  and this is confirmed by the example of a species of squirrel (Sciurus  carolinensis), of which sixteen specimens, all males and all taken in  Florida, were measured and tabulated by Mr. Allen. The diagram here  given shows, that, both the general amount of the variation and the  independent variability of the several members of the body, accord  completely with the variations so common in the class of birds; while  their amount and their independence of each other are even greater than  usual.      _Variation in the Internal Organs of Animals._    In case it should be objected that the cases of variation hitherto  adduced are in the external parts only, and that there is no proof that  the internal organs vary in the same manner, it will be advisable to  show that such varieties also occur. It is, however, impossible to  adduce the same amount of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14586"],[0,"The Brain, A Decoded Enigma (#15)"],[1," truth is associated by us to a  symbolic message (generated by a symbolic model); however in order to keep the  terminology simple, in the case of image models, a result obtained by  simulation on the model is also called 'truth', in spite of the fact that it  is used 'as is', without the necessity to explain it.    Example: If an animal builds an image model of the external reality,  predicting a dangerous situation, it is possible to find the solution to the  problem by simulation on the model. This solution (the truth) might be, e.g.  to flee. The truth will activate directly the preexistent action model, which  is in this case to flee.    We'll refer from now on only to symbolic models. If no model is specified, any  truth is nonsense.    Example: The truth is ãa car crashed into a wall\". This truth might be  generated by any of the following models:  -accident  -test  -movie/cartoon  -computer game    In any of the above models, the specified truth is interpreted differently (it  has a different meaning).    The theory underlines thus, that the model which generated a truth needs to be  specified and accepted before the presentation of the truth. This basic  requirement is always met in positive sciences.    In common life, the declaration of the model is not always done, and often the  model does not even exist in an elaborate and coherent form. Emerging from  here a long line of conflicts between individuals, groups or cultural zones,  which all have their own reality associated to the same external reality. This  can be interpreted as a design deficiency of the brain. Some can compensate  this hardware deficiency by software, e.g. the individuals situated on level 3  of consciousness (see the general theory).    There is a fairly common situation in external reality when a person states a  truth, and then builds the model to support it. This happens usually for  persons based on image models only, and when they interact with external  reality, they only translate the image truth to a symbolic truth. Such persons  are recognisable by their rudimentary logic and their tendency to fragment any  discussion to particular sections of the external reality. Such persons can't  discuss a single general subject.    Exercise: Verify yourself and others on the existence and status of the model,  which generated any stated truth.    It is known from the general theory that a basic problem in the construction  of a model associated to the external reality is that we do not know  beforehand the elements of the specific external reality. These elements need  to be discovered, and the discovered elements are the only ones we can operate  with.    Warning: The external reality, as defined in MDT, can't have elements and  relationships. The elements and relations appear only in the model associated  to the external reality. However, in many statements we will use notions like  elements and relationships of the external reality, but these need to be  understood as elements and relations of the model associated to the external  reality. For the external reality, one can use the term 'entity', which  identified by the model will become an element of it. However, we have no word  available to associate to external reality in the case of relations. By  perfectioning the language, such deficiencies will be solved.    A basic requirement for the existence of communication is the existence of a  single common model accepted by both parts who want to communicate. Without a  common symbolic model, there is no communication, as both sides will have  their own list of definition of the terms associated to the words.    Usually, communication is done only on symbolic models. However, there are  more primitive forms of communication using image models (between people,  between humans and animals, between animals).    The reality is defined in the general theory as the sum of all truths  generated, or possibly generated, by a model. As each person has his/her own  collection of models, the reality as understood by each person is different  from one person to another.    It is important to specify that in the domain of positive sciences,  fundamental models generally accepted do exist. One of these models is e.g.  Newton's Mechanics. As this model generates a reality, all physicists consider  that the 'reality' is the one generated by Newton's Mechanics, within its  limits of applicability.    Due to reasons associated to confusions of the science of knowledge, the  reality generated by Newton's model is considered as 'objective'. Thus,  \"objective reality\" is a term generated by a generally accepted model in  specified conditions. From this point of view, the fact that the Sun revolves  around the Earth is an \"objective truth\", at least at the level of the year  1500.    It needs to be stated by all means that without a model, the external reality  cannot be perceived.  After building a model associated to the external  reality, what we perceive is what the model states as perception. If, e.g. we  say that 'snow is white', this is the result generated by a model associated  with external reality, external reality which contains the element 'snow'. One  of the properties of the element 'snow' is that it is white. Under the  microscope (another model) the same snow looks transparent.    As we already mentioned, reality is the one generated by the model associated  to a given external reality. Each time we state a truth, we have to specify  first the model.    Example: There are an A and a B person. A is taller than B, as it results from  measurement. The term 'length' is generated of the model 'space', as Euclid's  Geometry and Newton's Mechanics understand it. These fundamental models  characterize this truth as objective. If we say that \"A is more attractive  than B\", this is a subjective truth. However a model has also generated this  truth, more or less elaborate/ specified and more or less accepted by  different persons.    The conclusion is that the term 'subjective truth' is resulting from a model,  which is not unanimously accepted or insufficiently elaborated. In this case,  it is clear that people should avoid such truths or should declare the model.    With the evolution of thinking, the term 'subjective truth' will be removed  from the thinking system.      ETA 3: Fundamental problems associated to scientific knowledge    Computers are known as devices used to play complex games based on  intelligence, to write texts of different types, to make calculations, to  store and manage data, to send or receive information, to build and operate  symbolic models, etc.    A question occurs however: which is the principle of work of a computer?    If we do not interact with the computer via a primary programming language  (Assembler or machine language), I believe that it is impossible to find the  principle of work of the computer either from in- or outside of it.    The fundamental function of a computer is to do logical and arithmetical  operations with binary numbers with the help of an electronic device  (register) called 'accumulator'.    If we are in a text editor, for instance, and we press a key corresponding to  a letter, that letter will show on the screen. For the unaware, it is  difficult to imagine that by pressing a key associated with a letter, a  register-accumulator will make hundreds or thousands of logical and  arithmetical operations on binary numbers, only to have that letter shown on  the screen.    This example wants to illustrate that, based on the external analysis of what  is happening, it is impossible to figure out the principle of work of a  ridiculously simple device as a computer (ridiculously simple compared to the  brain of a dog, e.g.)    The method used in positive sciences is not the analysis of primary data. The  method of analysis works on extremely simple systems, which can be perceived  on image models as well. The method used in positive sciences is to guess a  symbolic model, based more or less on the interaction with external reality,  and to verify the model.    It results that the method of understanding the brain based on the analysis of  primary data is at least inefficient.    A fundamental problem of knowledge is that primary facts can be understood  only if a model to integrate them already exists. Without a model, we are  forced to build one on the spot. Thus, each fact of the external reality could  be understood based on a local model. The correlation between facts, each  understood in its local model is impossible. This is why a method of guessing  a fundamental model was imposed. Based on the single fundamental model the  facts are interpreted and reinterpreted. Such a method allows the correlation  of the primary facts.    If the model does not make good predictions, it will be modified and the  process restarted from scratch, until we find the model in which all the  primary facts can be understood. The process stops when the predictions are  true with an acceptable rate. In that phase we can talk about knowledge.    As a comment, we need to say that the analytical method is based on short-  range models (can be affected by schizophrenia and XSPC), while the synthetic  method is based on long-range models which allow not only correlation between  facts, but also a cross-check between the local models.    The need for a single fundamental model comes from the fact that any used word  needs to have a unique definition. This is true only in case of the existence  of a single fundamental model.    Example: what would happen if in common language everybody used different  definitions for the words used? The communication would not exist, everyone  talking his/her own language.    The conclusion is that any positive science is based on a single fundamental  model, stated from the very start. This symbolic model can be based on primary  facts, results of the interaction with external "]]]
