Zimmermann could not make himself believe that  a German submarine was responsible and the Government had decided to  disavow all responsibility.  But such convincing reports began to  arrive from the United States and from neutral European countries which  proved beyond a doubt that a German submarine was responsible, that the  Government had to again bring up the submarine issue at Great  Headquarters.  When the von Holtzendorff interview was published in the  United States it caused a sensation because if Germany maintained the  attitude which the Chief of the Admiralty Staff had taken with the  approval of the Foreign Office, a break in diplomatic relations could  not be avoided.  Secretary Lansing telegraphed Ambassador Gerard to  inquire at the Foreign Office whether the statements of von  Holtzendorff represented the opinions of the German Government.  Gerard  called me to the Embassy but before I arrived Dr. Heckscher, of the  Reichstag Foreign Relations Committee, came.  Gerard called me in in  Heckscher's presence to ask if I knew that the von Holtzendorff  interview would bring about a break in diplomatic relations unless it  was immediately disavowed.  He told Dr. Heckscher to inform Zimmermann  that if the Chief of the Admiralty Staff was going to direct Germany's  foreign policies he would ask his government to accredit him to the  naval authorities and not to the Foreign Office.  Heckscher would not  believe my statement that Zimmermann had approved the interview and  assured Gerard that within a very short time the Foreign Office would  disavow von Holtzendorff's statements.  When he arrived at the Foreign  Office, however, Zimmermann not only refused to disavow the Admiral's  statement but informed Heckscher that he had the same opinions.    President Wilson was at the end of his patience.  Probably he began to  doubt whether he could rely upon the reports of Ambassador Gerard that  there was a chance of the democratic forces in Germany coming out ahead  of the military caste.  Wilson showed his attitude plainly in the  _Sussex_ note when he said:      \"The Government of the United States has been very patient.  At every  stage of this distressing experience of tragedy after tragedy it has  sought to be governed by the most thoughtful considerations of the  extraordinary circumstances of an unprecedented war and to be guided by  sentiments of very genuine friendship for the people and the Government  of Germany.  It has accepted the successive explanations and assurances  of the Imperial Government as of course given in entire sincerity and  good faith, and has hoped even against hope that it would prove to be  possible for the Imperial Government so to order and control the acts  of its naval commanders as to square its policy with the recognised  principles of humanity as embodied in the law of nations.  It has made  every allowance for unprecedented conditions and has been willing to  wait until the facts became unmistakable and were susceptible of only  one interpretation.  It now owes it to a just regard, for its own  rights to say to the Imperial Government that that time has come.  It  has become painfully evident to it that the position which it took at  the very outset is inevitable, namely that the use of submarines for  the destruction of enemy commerce is of necessity, because of the very  character of the vessels employed and the very methods, of attack which  their employment of course involves, utterly incompatible with the  principles of humanity, the long established and incontrovertible  rights of neutrals and the sacred immunities of non-combatants.    \"If it is still the purpose of the Imperial Government to prosecute  relentless and indiscriminate warfare against vessels of commerce by  the use of submarines without regard to what the Government of the  United States must consider the sacred and indisputable rules of  international law and the universally recognised dictates of humanity,  the Government of the United States is at last forced to the conclusion  that there is but one course it can pursue.  Unless the Imperial  Government should now immediately declare and effect an abandonment of  its present methods of submarine warfare against passenger and freight  carrying vessels, the Government of the United States can have no  choice but to sever diplomatic relations with the German Government  altogether.  This action the Government of the United States  contemplates with the greatest reluctance but feels constrained to take  in behalf of humanity and the rights of neutral nations.\"      After von Jagow read the note the Foreign Office Telegraph Bureau sent  it to Great Headquarters, which at this time was still located in  Charleville, France, for the information of the Kaiser and General von  Falkenhayn.  It was evident to every one in Berlin that again, not only  the submarine issue was to be debated at Great Headquarters, but that  the Kaiser was to be forced again to decide between the Chancellor and  his democratic supporters and von Falkenhayn and the military party.  Before the Conference convened General Headquarters sent inquiries to  five government departments, the Foreign Office, the Navy, the Ministry  of War, the Treasury, and Interior.  The Ministers at the head of these  departments were asked to state whether in their opinion the  controversy with America should be adjusted, or whether the submarine  warfare should be continued.  Dr. Karl Helfferich, the Vice Chancellor  and Minister of Interior, Secretary of State von Jagow, and Count von  Roedern, Minister of Finance, replied to adjust the difficulty.  The  Army and Navy said in effect: \"If you can adjust it without stopping  the submarine warfare and without breaking with the United States do  so.\"    The latter part of April the Kaiser summoned all of his ministers and  his leading generals to the French chateau which he used as his  headquarters in Charleville.  This city is one of the most picturesque  cities in the occupied districts of northern France.  It is located on  the banks of the Meuse and contains many historic, old ruins.  At one  end of the town is a large stone castle, surrounded by a moat.  This  was made the headquarters of the General Staff after the Germans  invaded this section of France.  Near the railroad station there was a  public park.  Facing it was a French chateau, a beautiful, comfortable  home.  This was the Kaiser's residence.  All streets leading in this  direction were barricaded and guarded by sentries.  No one could pass  without a special written permit from the Chief of the General Staff.  Von Falkenhayn had his home nearby in another of the beautiful chateaux  there.  The chief of every department of the General Staff lived in  princely fashion in houses which in peace time were homes for  distinguished Frenchmen.  There were left in Charleville scarcely a  hundred French citizens, because obviously French people, who were  enemies of Germany, could not he permitted to go back and forth in the  city which was the centre of German militarism.    When the ministers arrived at the Kaiser's headquarters, His Majesty  asked each one to make a complete report on the submarine war as it  affected his department.  Dr. Helfferich was asked to go into the  question of German finance and the relation of America to it.  Dr.  Solf, the Colonial Minister, who had been a very good friend of  Ambassador Gerard, discussed the question of the submarine warfare from  the stand-point of its relation to Germany's position as a world power.  Admiral von Capelle placed before the Kaiser the figures of the number  of ships sunk, their tonnage, the number of submarines operating, the  number under construction and the number lost.  General von Falkenhayn  reported on the military situation and discussed the hypothetical  question as to what effect American intervention would have upon the  European war theatres.    While the conferences were going on, Dr. Heckscher and Under Secretary  Zimmermann, who at that time were anxious to avoid a break with the  United States, sounded Ambassador Gerard as to whether he would be  willing to go to Great Headquarters to confer with the Kaiser.  The  Foreign Office at the same time suggested the matter to the General  Staff and within a few hours Mr. Gerard was invited to go to  Charleville.  Before the ambassador arrived the Kaiser called all of  his ministers together for a joint session and asked them to make a  brief summary of their arguments.  This was not a peace meeting.  Not  only opponents of submarine warfare but its advocates mobilised all  their forces in a final attempt to win the Kaiser's approval.  His  Majesty, at this time, was inclined towards peace with America and was  very much impressed by the arguments which the Chancellor and Dr.  Helfferich presented.  But, at this meeting, while Helfferich was  talking and pointing to the moral effect which the ruthless torpedoing  of ships was having upon neutral countries, von Falkenhayn interrupted  with the succinct statement:    \"Neutrals?  Damn the neutrals!  Win the war!  Our task is to win.  If  we win we will have the neutrals with us; if we lose we lose.\"    \"Falkenhayn, when you are versed in foreign affairs I'll ask you to  speak,\" interrupted the Kaiser.  \"Proceed, Dr. Helfferich.\"    Gentleman that he is, von Falkenhayn accepted the Imperial rebuke, but  not long afterward his resignation was submitted.    As a result of these conferences and the arguments advanced by  Ambassador Gerard, Secretary von Jagow on May 4th handed the Ambassador  the German note in reply to President Wilson's _Sussex_ ultimatum.  In  this communication Germany said:      \"Fully conscious of its strength, the German Government has twice in  the course of the past few months expressed itself before all the world  as prepared to conclude a peace"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15777"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, Volume 1 (#15)"],[1,"thermometer of late, I shall now observe, that, as we  advanced to the north, the mercury gradually rose to 45, and fell again, as  we advanced to the south, to what is above-mentioned; nor did it rise, in  the middle of the day, to above 34 or 35.    In the morning of the 18th, being in the latitude of 57 deg. 54' S., longitude  83 deg. 14' E., the variation was 39 deg. 33' W. In the evening, in latitude 58 deg. 2'  S., longitude 84 deg. 35' E., it was only 37 deg. 8' W., which induced me to  believe it was decreasing. But in the evening of the 20th, in the latitude  of 58 deg. 47' S., longitude 90 deg. 56' E., I took nine azimuths, with Dr Knight's  compass, which gave the variation 40 deg. 7', and nine others, with Gregory's,  which gave 40 deg. 15' W.    This day, at noon, being nearly in the latitude and longitude just  mentioned, we thought we saw land to the S.W. The appearance was so strong  that we doubted not it was there in reality, and tacked to work up to it  accordingly; having a light breeze at south, and clear weather. We were,  however, soon undeceived, by finding that it was only clouds; which, in the  evening, entirely disappeared, and left us a clear horizon, so that we  could see a considerable way round us; in which space nothing was to be  seen but ice islands.    In the night the Aurora Australis made a very brilliant and luminous  appearance. It was seen first in the east, a little above the horizon; and,  in a short time, spread over the whole heavens.    The 21st, in the morning, having little wind and a smooth sea, two  favourable circumstances for taking up ice, I steered for the largest ice  island before us, which we reached by noon. At this time, we were in the  latitude of 59 deg. S., longitude 92 deg. 30' E.; having about two hours before  seen three or four penguins. Finding here a good quantity of loose ice, I  ordered two boats out, and sent them to take some on board. While this was  doing, the island, which was not less than half a mile in circuit, and  three or four hundred feet high above the surface of the sea, turned nearly  bottom up. Its height, by this circumstance, was neither increased nor  diminished apparently. As soon as we had got on board as much ice as we  could dispose of, we hoisted in the boats, and made sail to the S.E., with  a gentle breeze at N. by E., attended with showers of snow, and dark gloomy  weather. At this time we had but few ice islands in sight, but, the next  day, seldom less than twenty or thirty were seen at once.    The wind gradually veered to the east; and, at last, fixing at E. by S.,  blew a fresh gale. With this we stood to the south, till eight o'clock in  the evening of the 23d; at which time we were in the latitude of 61 deg. 52'  S., longitude 95 deg. 2' E. We now tacked and spent the night, which was  exceedingly stormy, thick, and hazy, with sleet and snow, in making short  boards. Surrounded on every side with danger, it was natural for us to wish  for day-light. This, when it came, served only to increase our  apprehensions, by exhibiting to our view those huge mountains of ice, which  in the night we had passed without seeing.    These unfavourable circumstances, together with dark nights, at this  advanced season of the year, quite discouraged me from putting in execution  a resolution I had taken of crossing the Antarctic Circle once more.  Accordingly, at four o'clock in the morning, we stood to the north, with a  very hard gale at E.S.E., accompanied with snow and sleet, and a very high  sea from the same point, which made great destruction among the ice  islands. This circumstance, far from being of any advantage to us, greatly  increased the number of pieces we had to avoid. The large pieces which  break from the ice islands, are much more dangerous than the islands  themselves. The latter are so high out of water, that we can generally see  them, unless the weather be very thick and dark, before we are very near  them. Whereas the others cannot be seen in the night, till they are under  the ship's bows. These dangers were, however, now become so familiar to us,  that the apprehensions they caused were never of long duration; and were,  in some measure, compensated both by the seasonable supplies of fresh water  these ice islands afforded us, (without which we must have been greatly  distressed,) and also by their very romantic appearance, greatly heightened  by the foaming and dashing of the waves into the curious holes and caverns  which are formed in many of them; the whole exhibiting a view which at once  filled the mind with admiration and horror, and can only be described by  the hand of an able painter.    Towards the evening the gale abated, and in the night we had two or three  hours calm. This was succeeded by a light breeze at west, with which we  steered east, under all the sail we could set, meeting with many ice  islands.    This night we saw a Port Egmont hen; and next morning, being the 25th,  another. We had lately seen but few birds; and those were albatrosses,  sheer-waters, and blue peterels. It is remarkable that we did not see one  of either the white or Antarctic peterels, since we came last amongst the  ice. Notwithstanding the wind kept at W. and N.W. all day, we had a very  high sea from the east, by which we concluded that no land could be near in  that direction. In the evening, being in the latitude 60 deg. 51', longitude  95 deg. 41' E., the variation was 43 deg. 6' W., and the next morning, being the  26th, having advanced about a degree and a half more to the east, it was  41 deg. 30', both being determined by several azimuths.    We had fair weather all the afternoon, but the wind was unsettled, veering  round by the north to the east. With this we stood to the S.E. and E., till  three o'clock in the afternoon; when, being in the latitude of 61 deg. 21' S.,  longitude 97 deg. 7', we tacked and stood to the northward and eastward as the  wind kept veering to the south. This, in the evening, increased to a strong  gale, blew in squalls, attended with snow and sleet, and thick hazy  weather, which soon brought us under our close-reefed top-sails.    Between eight in the morning of the 26th, and noon the next day, we fell in  among several islands of ice; from whence such vast quantities had broken  as to cover the sea all round us, and render sailing rather dangerous.  However, by noon, we were clear of it all. In the evening the wind abated,  and veered to S.W. but the weather did not clear up till the next morning,  when we were able to carry all our sails, and met with but very few islands  of ice to impede us. Probably the late gale had destroyed a great number of  them. Such a very large hollow sea had continued to accompany the wind as  it veered from E. to S.W. that I was certain no land of considerable extent  could lie within 100 or 150 leagues of our situation between these two  points.    The mean height of the thermometer at noon, for some days past, was at  about 35, which is something higher than it usually was in the same  latitude about a month or five weeks before, consequently the air was  something warmer. While the weather was really _warm_, the gales were  not only stronger, but more frequent, with almost continual misty, dirty,  wet weather. The very animals we had on board felt its effects. A sow  having in the morning farrowed nine pigs, every one of them was killed by  the cold before four o'clock in the afternoon, notwithstanding all the care  we could take of them. From the same cause, myself as well as several of my  people, had fingers and toes chilblained. Such is the summer weather we  enjoyed!    1773 March    The wind continued unsettled, veering from the south to the west, and blew  a fresh gale till the evening. Then it fell little wind, and soon after a  breeze sprung up at north, which quickly veered to N.E. and N.E. by E.,  attended with a thick fog, snow, sleet, and rain. With this wind and  weather we kept on to the S.E., till four o'clock in the afternoon of the  next day, being the first of March, when it fell calm, which continued for  near twenty-four hours. We were now in the latitude of 60 deg. 36' S.,  longitude 107 deg. 54', and had a prodigious high swell from the S.W., and, at  the same time, another from the S. or S.S.E. The dashing of the one wave  against the other, made the ship both roll and pitch exceedingly; but at  length the N.W. swell prevailed. The calm continued till noon the next day,  when it was succeeded by a gentle breeze from S.E., which afterwards  increased and veered to S.W. With this we steered N.E. by E., and E. by N.,  under all the sail we could set.    In the afternoon of the 3d, being in latitude 60 deg. 13', longitude 110 deg. 18',  the variation was 39 deg. 4' W. But the observations, by which this was  determined, were none of the best, being obliged to make use of such as we  could get, during the very few and short intervals when the sun appeared. A  few penguins were seen this day, but not so many islands of ice as usual.  The weather was also milder, though very changeable; thermometer from 36 to  38. We continued to have a N.W. swell, although the wind was unsettled,  veering to N.W. by the W. and N., attended with hazy sleet and drizzling  rain.    We prosecuted our course to the east, inclining to the south, till three  o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th, when, (being in the latitude of 60 deg.  37', longitude 113 deg. 24') the wind shifting at once to S.W. and S.W. by S.,  I gave orders to steer E. by N. 1/2 N. But in the night we steered E. 1/2  S. in order to have the wind, which was at S.S.W., more upon the beam, the  better to enable us to stand back, in case we fell in with any danger in  the dark. For we had not so much time to spare to allow us to lie-to.    In the morning of the 5th, we steered E. by N., under all the sail we could  set, passing one ice island and many small pieces, and "]]]
