By the ruin ye may mount:  For on the side it slants, and most the height  Rises below.\"  With head bent down awhile  My leader stood, then spake:  \"He warn'd us ill,  Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook.\"       To whom the friar:  At Bologna erst  I many vices of the devil heard,  Among the rest was said, 'He is a liar,  And the father of lies!'\"  When he had spoke,  My leader with large strides proceeded on,  Somewhat disturb'd with anger in his look.       I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,  And following, his beloved footsteps mark'd.        CANTO XXIV    IN the year's early nonage, when the sun  Tempers his tresses in Aquarius' urn,  And now towards equal day the nights recede,  When as the rime upon the earth puts on  Her dazzling sister's image, but not long  Her milder sway endures, then riseth up  The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,  And looking out beholds the plain around  All whiten'd, whence impatiently he smites  His thighs, and to his hut returning in,  There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,  As a discomfited and helpless man;  Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope  Spring in his bosom, finding e'en thus soon  The world hath chang'd its count'nance, grasps his crook,  And forth to pasture drives his little flock:  So me my guide dishearten'd when I saw  His troubled forehead, and so speedily  That ill was cur'd; for at the fallen bridge  Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,  He turn'd him back, as that I first beheld  At the steep mountain's foot.  Regarding well  The ruin, and some counsel first maintain'd  With his own thought, he open'd wide his arm  And took me up.  As one, who, while he works,  Computes his labour's issue, that he seems  Still to foresee the' effect, so lifting me  Up to the summit of one peak, he fix'd  His eye upon another.  \"Grapple that,\"  Said he, \"but first make proof, if it be such  As will sustain thee.\"  For one capp'd with lead  This were no journey.  Scarcely he, though light,  And I, though onward push'd from crag to crag,  Could mount.  And if the precinct of this coast  Were not less ample than the last, for him  I know not, but my strength had surely fail'd.  But Malebolge all toward the mouth  Inclining of the nethermost abyss,  The site of every valley hence requires,  That one side upward slope, the other fall.       At length the point of our descent we reach'd  From the last flag: soon as to that arriv'd,  So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,  I could no further, but did seat me there.       \"Now needs thy best of man;\" so spake my guide:  \"For not on downy plumes, nor under shade  Of canopy reposing, fame is won,  Without which whosoe'er consumes his days  Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,  As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.  Thou therefore rise:  vanish thy weariness  By the mind's effort, in each struggle form'd  To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight  Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.  A longer ladder yet remains to scale.  From these to have escap'd sufficeth not.  If well thou note me, profit by my words.\"       I straightway rose, and show'd myself less spent  Than I in truth did feel me.  \"On,\" I cried,  \"For I am stout and fearless.\"  Up the rock  Our way we held, more rugged than before,  Narrower and steeper far to climb.  From talk  I ceas'd not, as we journey'd, so to seem  Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss  Did issue forth, for utt'rance suited ill.  Though on the arch that crosses there I stood,  What were the words I knew not, but who spake  Seem'd mov'd in anger.  Down I stoop'd to look,  But my quick eye might reach not to the depth  For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:  \"To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,  And from the wall dismount we; for as hence  I hear and understand not, so I see  Beneath, and naught discern.\"--\"I answer not,\"  Said he, \"but by the deed.  To fair request  Silent performance maketh best return.\"       We from the bridge's head descended, where  To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm  Opening to view, I saw a crowd within  Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape  And hideous, that remembrance in my veins  Yet shrinks the vital current.  Of her sands  Let Lybia vaunt no more:  if Jaculus,  Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,  Cenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire  Or in such numbers swarming ne'er she shew'd,  Not with all Ethiopia, and whate'er  Above the Erythraean sea is spawn'd.       Amid this dread exuberance of woe  Ran naked spirits wing'd with horrid fear,  Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,  Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.  With serpents were their hands behind them bound,  Which through their reins infix'd the tail and head  Twisted in folds before.  And lo!  on one  Near to our side, darted an adder up,  And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,  Transpierc'd him.  Far more quickly than e'er pen  Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn'd, and chang'd  To ashes, all pour'd out upon the earth.  When there dissolv'd he lay, the dust again  Uproll'd spontaneous, and the self-same form  Instant resumed.  So mighty sages tell,  The' Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years  Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith  Renascent.  Blade nor herb throughout his life  He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone  And odorous amomum:  swaths of nard  And myrrh his funeral shroud.  As one that falls,  He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg'd  To earth, or through obstruction fettering up  In chains invisible the powers of man,  Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,  Bewilder'd with the monstrous agony  He hath endur'd, and wildly staring sighs;  So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.       Oh!  how severe God's judgment, that deals out  Such blows in stormy vengeance!  Who he was  My teacher next inquir'd, and thus in few  He answer'd:  \"Vanni Fucci am I call'd,  Not long since rained down from Tuscany  To this dire gullet.  Me the beastial life  And not the human pleas'd, mule that I was,  Who in Pistoia found my worthy den.\"       I then to Virgil:  \"Bid him stir not hence,  And ask what crime did thrust him hither:  once  A man I knew him choleric and bloody.\"       The sinner heard and feign'd not, but towards me  His mind directing and his face, wherein  Was dismal shame depictur'd, thus he spake:  \"It grieves me more to have been caught by thee  In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than  When I was taken from the other life.  I have no power permitted to deny  What thou inquirest.\"  I am doom'd thus low  To dwell, for that the sacristy by me  Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,  And with the guilt another falsely charged.  But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,  So as thou e'er shalt 'scape this darksome realm  Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.  Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,  Then Florence changeth citizens and laws.  From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,  A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,  And sharp and eager driveth on the storm  With arrowy hurtling o'er Piceno's field,  Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike  Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.  This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart.\"        CANTO XXV    WHEN he had spoke, the sinner rais'd his hands  Pointed in mockery, and cried:  \"Take them, God!  I level them at thee!\"  From that day forth  The serpents were my friends; for round his neck  One of then rolling twisted, as it said,  \"Be silent, tongue!\"  Another to his arms  Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself  So close, it took from them the power to move.       Pistoia!  Ah Pistoia!  why dost doubt  To turn thee into ashes, cumb'ring earth  No longer, since in evil act so far  Thou hast outdone thy seed?  I did not mark,  Through all the gloomy circles of the' abyss,  Spirit, that swell'd so proudly 'gainst his God,  Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes.  He fled,  Nor utter'd more; and after him there came  A centaur full of fury, shouting, \"Where  Where is the caitiff?\"  On Maremma's marsh  Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch  They swarm'd, to where the human face begins.  Behind his head upon the shoulders lay,  With open wings, a dragon breathing fire  On whomsoe'er he met.  To me my guide:  \"Cacus is this, who underneath the rock  Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.  He, from his brethren parted, here must tread  A different journey, for his fraudful theft  Of the great herd, that near him stall'd; whence found  His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace  Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on  A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt.\"       While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:  And under us three spirits came, of whom  Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim'd;  \"Say who are ye?\"  We then brake off discourse,  Intent on these alone.  I knew them not;  But, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one  Had need to name another.  \"Where,\" said he,  \"Doth Cianfa lurk?\"  I, for a sign my guide  Should stand attentive, plac'd against my lips  The finger lifted.  If, O reader!  now  Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,  No marvel; for myself do scarce allow  The witness of mine eyes.  But as I looked  Toward them, lo!  a serpent with six feet  Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:  His midmost grasp'd the belly, a forefoot  Seiz'd on each arm (while deep in either cheek  He flesh'd his fangs); the hinder on the thighs  Were spread, 'twixt which the tail inserted curl'd  Upon the reins behind.  Ivy ne'er clasp'd  A dodder'd oak, as round the other's limbs  The hideous monster intertwin'd his own.  Then, as they both had been of burning"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10084"],[0,"Kazan (#15)"],[1,"the  smoke with it, and during this breathing spell all the wild creatures in  the triangle between the two rivers waited. This gave the fire time to  sweep completely, across the base of the forest triangle, cutting off  the last trails of escape.    Then the wind shifted again, and the fire swept north. The head of the  triangle became a death-trap. All through the night the southern sky was  filled with a lurid glow, and by morning the heat and smoke and ash were  suffocating.    Panic-striken, Kazan searched vainly for a means of escape. Not for an  instant did he leave Gray Wolf. It would have been easy for him to swim  across either of the two streams, for he was three-quarters dog. But at  the first touch of water on her paws, Gray Wolf drew back, shrinking.  Like all her breed, she would face fire and death before water. Kazan  urged. A dozen times he leaped in, and swam out into the stream. But  Gray Wolf would come no farther than she could wade.    They could hear the distant murmuring roar of the fire now. Ahead of it  came the wild things. Moose, caribou and deer plunged into the water of  the streams and swam to the safety of the opposite side. Out upon a  white finger of sand lumbered a big black bear with two cubs, and even  the cubs took to the water, and swam across easily. Kazan watched them,  and whined to Gray Wolf.    And then out upon that white finger of sand came other things that  dreaded the water as Gray Wolf dreaded it: a big fat porcupine, a sleek  little marten, a fisher-cat that sniffed the air and wailed like a  child. Those things that could not or would not swim outnumbered the  others three to one. Hundreds of little ermine scurried along the shore  like rats, their squeaking little voices sounding incessantly; foxes ran  swiftly along the banks, seeking a tree or a windfall that might bridge  the water for them; the lynx snarled and faced the fire; and Gray  Wolf's own tribe--the wolves--dared take no deeper step than she.    Dripping and panting, and half choked by heat and smoke, Kazan came to  Gray Wolf's side. There was but one refuge left near them, and that was  the sand-bar. It reached out for fifty feet into the stream. Quickly he  led his blind mate toward it. As they came through the low bush to the  river-bed, something stopped them both. To their nostrils had come the  scent of a deadlier enemy than fire. A lynx had taken possession of the  sand-bar, and was crouching at the end of it. Three porcupines had  dragged themselves into the edge of the water, and lay there like balls,  their quills alert and quivering. A fisher-cat was snarling at the lynx.  And the lynx, with ears laid back, watched Kazan and Gray Wolf as they  began the invasion of the sand-bar.    Faithful Gray Wolf was full of fight, and she sprang shoulder to  shoulder with Kazan, her fangs bared. With an angry snap, Kazan drove  her back, and she stood quivering and whining while he advanced.  Light-footed, his pointed ears forward, no menace or threat in his  attitude, he advanced. It was the deadly advance of the husky trained  in battle, skilled in the art of killing. A man from civilization would  have said that the dog was approaching the lynx with friendly  intentions. But the lynx understood. It was the old feud of many  generations--made deadlier now by Kazan's memory of that night at the  top of the Sun Rock.    Instinct told the fisher-cat what was coming, and it crouched low and  flat; the porcupines, scolding like little children at the presence of  enemies and the thickening clouds of smoke, thrust their quills still  more erect. The lynx lay on its belly, like a cat, its hindquarters  twitching, and gathered for the spring. Kazan's feet seemed scarcely to  touch the sand as he circled lightly around it. The lynx pivoted as he  circled, and then it shot in a round snarling ball over the eight feet  of space that separated them.    Kazan did not leap aside. He made no effort to escape the attack, but  met it fairly with the full force of his shoulders, as sledge-dog meets  sledge-dog. He was ten pounds heavier than the lynx, and for a moment  the big loose-jointed cat with its twenty knife-like claws was thrown  on its side. Like a flash Kazan took advantage of the moment, and drove  for the back of the cat's neck.    In that same moment blind Gray Wolf leaped in with a snarling cry, and  fighting under Kazan's belly, she fastened her jaws in one of the cat's  hindlegs. The bone snapped. The lynx, twice outweighed, leaped backward,  dragging both Kazan and Gray Wolf. It fell back down on one of the  porcupines, and a hundred quills drove into its body. Another leap and  it was free--fleeing into the face of the smoke. Kazan did not pursue.  Gray Wolf came to his side and licked his neck, where fresh blood was  crimsoning his tawny hide. The fisher-cat lay as if dead, watching them  with fierce little black eyes. The porcupines continued to chatter, as  if begging for mercy. And then a thick black suffocating pall of smoke  drove low over the sand-bar and with it came air that was furnace-hot.    At the uttermost end of the sand-bar Kazan and Gray Wolf rolled  themselves into balls and thrust their heads under their bodies. The  fire was very near now. The roar of it was like that of a great  cataract, with now and then a louder crash of falling trees. The air  was filled with ash and burning sparks, and twice Kazan drew forth his  head to snap at blazing embers that fell upon and seared him like hot  irons.    Close along the edge of the stream grew thick green bush, and when the  fire reached this, it burned more slowly, and the heat grew less. Still,  it was a long time before Kazan and Gray Wolf could draw forth their  heads and breathe more freely. Then they found that the finger of sand  reaching out into the river had saved them. Everywhere in that triangle  between the two rivers the world had turned black, and was hot  underfoot.    The smoke cleared away. The wind changed again, and swung down cool and  fresh from the west and north. The fisher-cat was the first to move  cautiously back to the forests that had been, but the porcupines were  still rolled into balls when Gray Wolf and Kazan left the sand-bar. They  began to travel up-stream, and before night came, their feet were sore  from hot ash and burning embers.    The moon was strange and foreboding that night, like a spatter of blood  in the sky, and through the long silent hours there was not even the  hoot of an owl to give a sign that life still existed where yesterday  had been a paradise of wild things. Kazan knew that there was nothing to  hunt, and they continued to travel all that night. With dawn they struck  a narrow swamp along the edge of the stream. Here beavers had built a  dam, and they were able to cross over into the green country on the  opposite side. For another day and another night they traveled westward,  and this brought them into the thick country of swamp and timber along  the Waterfound.    And as Kazan and Gray Wolf came from the west, there came from the  Hudson's Bay post to the east a slim dark-faced French half-breed by the  name of Henri Loti, the most famous lynx hunter in all the Hudson's Bay  country. He was prospecting for \"signs,\" and he found them in abundance  along the Waterfound. It was a game paradise, and the snow-shoe rabbit  abounded in thousands. As a consequence, the lynxes were thick, and  Henri built his trapping shack, and then returned to the post to wait  until the first snows fell, when he would come back with his team,  supplies and traps.    And up from the south, at this same time, there was slowly working his  way by canoe and trail a young university zoologist who was gathering  material for a book on _The Reasoning of the Wild_. His name was Paul  Weyman, and he had made arrangements to spend a part of the winter with  Henri Loti, the half-breed. He brought with him plenty of paper, a  camera and the photograph of a girl. His only weapon was a pocket-knife.    And meanwhile Kazan and Gray Wolf found the home they were seeking in a  thick swamp five or six miles from the cabin that Henri Loti had built.          CHAPTER XI    ALWAYS TWO BY TWO      It was January when a guide from the post brought Paul Weyman to Henri  Loti's cabin on the Waterfound. He was a man of thirty-two or three,  full of the red-blooded life that made Henri like him at once. If this  had not been the case, the first few days in the cabin might have been  unpleasant, for Henri was in bad humor. He told Weyman about it their  first night, as they were smoking pipes alongside the redly glowing box  stove.    \"It is damn strange,\" said Henri. \"I have lost seven lynx in the traps,  torn to pieces like they were no more than rabbits that the foxes had  killed. No thing--not even bear--have ever tackled lynx in a trap  before. It is the first time I ever see it. And they are torn up so bad  they are not worth one half dollar at the post. Seven!--that is over two  hundred dollar I have lost! There are two wolves who do it. Two--I know  it by the tracks--always two--an'--never one. They follow my trap-line  an' eat the rabbits I catch. They leave the fisher-cat, an' the mink,  an' the ermine, an' the marten; but the lynx--_sacre_ an' damn!--they  jump on him an' pull the fur from him like you pull the wild cotton  balls from the burn-bush! I have tried strychnine in deer fat, an' I  have set traps and deadfalls, but I can not catch them. They will drive  me out unless I get them, for I have taken only five good lynx, an' they  have destroyed seven.\"    This roused Weyman. He was one of that growing number of thoughtful men  who believe that man's egoism, as a race, blinds him to many of the more  wonderful facts of creation. He had thrown down the gantlet, and with a  logic that had gained him a nation-wide hearing, to those who believed  that man was the only living creature who could"]]]
