The formula of leaving  obstacles behind occurs in the Indian collection, the 'Kathasarit sagara'  (vii. xxxix.).  The 'Battle of the Birds,' in Campbell's 'Tales of the  West Highlands,' is a very copious Gaelic variant.  Russian parallels are  'Vasilissa the Wise and the Water King,' and 'The King Bear.' {93a}  The  incident of the flight and the magical obstacles is found in Japanese  mythology. {93b}  The 'ugly woman of Hades' is sent to pursue the hero.  He casts down his black head-dress, and it is instantly turned into  grapes; he fled while she was eating them.  Again, 'he cast down his  multitudinous and close-toothed comb, and it instantly turned into bamboo  sprouts.'  In the Gaelic version, the pursuer is detained by talkative  objects which the pursued leave at home, and this marvel recurs in  Zululand, and is found among the Bushmen.  The Zulu versions are  numerous. {93c}  Oddly enough, in the last variant, the girl performs no  magic feat, but merely throws sesamum on the ground to delay the  cannibals, for cannibals are very fond of sesamum. {93d}    * * * * *    Here, then, we have the remarkable details of the flight, in Zulu,  Gaelic, Norse, Malagasy, {93e} Russian, Italian, Japanese.  Of all  incidents in the myth, the incidents of the flight are most widely known.  But the whole connected series of events--the coming of the wooer; the  love of the hostile being's daughter; the tasks imposed on the wooer; the  aid rendered by the daughter; the flight of the pair; the defeat or  destruction of the hostile being--all these, or most of these, are  extant, in due sequence, among the following races.  The Greeks have the  tale, the people of Madagascar have it, the Lowland Scotch, the Celts,  the Russians, the Italians, the Algonquins, the Finns, and the Samoans  have it.  Now if the story were confined to the Aryan race, we might  account for its diffusion, by supposing it to be the common heritage of  the Indo-European peoples, carried everywhere with them in their  wanderings.  But when the tale is found in Madagascar, North America,  Samoa, and among the Finns, while many scattered incidents occur in even  more widely severed races, such as Zulus, Bushmen, Japanese, Eskimo,  Samoyeds, the Aryan hypothesis becomes inadequate.    To show how closely, all things considered, the Aryan and non-Aryan  possessors of the tale agree, let us first examine the myth of Jason.    * * * * *    The earliest literary reference to the myth of Jason is in the 'Iliad'  (vii. 467, xxiii. 747).  Here we read of Euneos, a son whom Hypsipyle  bore to Jason in Lemnos.  Already, even in the 'Iliad,' the legend of  Argo's voyage has been fitted into certain well-known geographical  localities.  A reference in the 'Odyssey' (xii. 72) has a more antique  ring: we are told that of all barques Argo alone escaped the jaws of the  Rocks Wandering, which clashed together and destroyed ships.  Argo  escaped, it is said, 'because Jason was dear to Hera.'  It is plain, from  various fragmentary notices, that Hesiod was familiar with several of the  adventures in the legend of Jason.  In the 'Theogony' (993-998) Hesiod  mentions the essential facts of the legend: how Jason carried off from  AEetes his daughter, 'after achieving the adventures, many and grievous,'  which were laid upon him.  At what period the home of AEetes was placed  in Colchis, it is not easy to determine.  Mimnermus, a contemporary of  Solon, makes the home of AEetes lie 'on the brink of ocean,' a very vague  description. {95}  Pindar, on the other hand, in the splendid Fourth  Pythian Ode, already knows Colchis as the scene of the loves and flight  of Jason and Medea.    * * * *    'Long were it for me to go by the beaten track,' says Pindar, 'and I know  a certain short path.'  Like Pindar, we may abridge the tale of Jason.  He  seeks the golden fleece in Colchis: AEetes offers it to him as a prize  for success in certain labours.  By the aid of Medea, the daughter of  AEetes, the wizard-king, Jason tames the fire-breathing oxen, yokes them  to the plough, and drives a furrow.  By Medea's help he conquers the  children of the teeth of the dragon, subdues the snake that guards the  fleece of gold, and escapes, but is pursued by AEetes.  To detain AEetes,  Medea throws behind the mangled remains of her own brother, Apsyrtos, and  the Colchians pursue no further than the scene of this bloody deed.  The  savagery of this act survives even in the work of a poet so late as  Apollonius Rhodius (iv. 477), where we read how Jason performed a rite of  savage magic, mutilating the body of Apsyrtos in a manner which was  believed to appease the avenging ghost of the slain.  'Thrice he tasted  the blood, thrice spat it out between his teeth,' a passage which the  Scholiast says contains the description of an archaic custom popular  among murderers.    Beyond Tomi, where a popular etymology fixed the 'cutting up' of  Apsyrtos, we need not follow the fortunes of Jason and Medea.  We have  already seen the wooer come to the hostile being, win his daughter's  love, achieve the adventures by her aid, and flee in her company,  delaying, by a horrible device, the advance of the pursuers.  To these  incidents in the tale we confine our attention.    Many explanations of the Jason myth have been given by Scholars who  thought they recognised elemental phenomena in the characters.  As usual  these explanations differ widely.  Whenever a myth has to be interpreted,  it is certain that one set of Scholars will discover the sun and the  dawn, where another set will see the thunder-cloud and lightning.  The  moon is thrown in at pleasure.  Sir G. W. Cox determines {96} 'that the  name Jason (Iason) must be classed with the many others, Iasion, Iamus,  Iolaus, Iaso, belonging to the same root.'  Well, what is the root?  Apparently the root is 'the root i, as denoting a crying colour, that is,  a loud colour' (ii. 81).  Seemingly (i. 229) violet is a loud colour,  and, wherever you have the root i, you have 'the violet-tinted morning  from which the sun is born.'  Medea is 'the daughter of the sun,' and  most likely, in her 'beneficent aspect,' is the dawn.  But (ii. 81, note)  ios has another meaning, 'which, as a spear, represents the far-darting  ray of the sun'; so that, in one way or another, Jason is connected with  the violet-tinted morning or with the sun's rays.  This is the gist of  the theory of Sir George Cox.    Preller {97a} is another Scholar, with another set of etymologies.  Jason  is derived, he thinks, from [Greek], to heal, because Jason studied  medicine under the Centaur Chiron.  This is the view of the Scholiast on  Apollonius Rhodius (i. 554).  Jason, to Preller's mind, is a form of  Asclepius, 'a spirit of the spring with its soft suns and fertile rains.'  Medea is the moon.  Medea, on the other hand, is a lightning goddess, in  the opinion of Schwartz. {97b}  No philological reason is offered.  Meanwhile, in Sir George Cox's system, the equivalent of Medea, 'in her  beneficent aspect,' is the dawn.    We must suppose, it seems, that either the soft spring rains and the  moon, or the dawn and the sun, or the lightning and the thunder-cloud, in  one arrangement or another, irresistibly suggested, to early Aryan minds,  the picture of a wooer, arriving in a hostile home, winning a maiden's  love, achieving adventures by her aid, fleeing with her from her angry  father and delaying his pursuit by various devices.  Why the spring, the  moon, the lightning, the dawn--any of them or all of them--should have  suggested such a tale, let Scholars determine when they have reconciled  their own differences.  It is more to our purpose to follow the myth  among Samoans, Algonquins, and Finns.  None of these races speak an Aryan  language, and none can have been beguiled into telling the same sort of  tale by a disease of Aryan speech.    Samoa, where we find our story, is the name of a group of volcanic  islands in Central Polynesia.  They are about 3,000 miles from Sidney,  were first observed by Europeans in 1722, and are as far removed as most  spots from direct Aryan influences.  Our position is, however, that in  the shiftings and migrations of peoples, the Jason tale has somehow been  swept, like a piece of drift-wood, on to the coasts of Samoa.  In the  islands, the tale has an epical form, and is chanted in a poem of twenty-  six stanzas.  There is something Greek in the free and happy life of the  Samoans--something Greek, too, in this myth of theirs.  There was once a  youth, Siati, famous for his singing, a young Thamyris of Samoa.  But as,  according to Homer, 'the Muses met Thamyris the Thracian, and made an end  of his singing, for he boasted and said that he would vanquish even the  Muses if he sang against them,' so did the Samoan god of song envy Siati.  The god and the mortal sang a match: the daughter of the god was to be  the mortal's prize if he proved victorious.  Siati won, and he set off,  riding on a shark, as Arion rode the dolphin, to seek the home of the  defeated deity.  At length he reached the shores divine, and thither  strayed Puapae, daughter of the god, looking for her comb which she had  lost.  'Siati,' said she, 'how camest thou hither?'  'I am come to seek  the song-god, and to wed his daughter.'  'My father,' said the maiden,  'is more a god than a man; eat nothing he hands you, never sit on a high  seat, lest death follow.'  So they were united in marriage.  But the god,  like AEetes, was wroth, and began to set Siati upon perilous tasks:  'Build me a house, and let it be finished this very day, else death and  the oven await thee.' {99a}    Siati wept, but the god's daughter had the house built by the evening.  The other adventures were to fight a fierce dog, and to find a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14091"],[0,"Barkham Burroughs' Encyclopaedia of Astounding Facts and Useful Information, (#15)"],[1,"idea to purchase a few yards of really good washing lace, about an  inch and a half in depth; quill or plait and cut into suitable lengths  to tack around the necks of dresses. This can be easily removed  and cleaned when soiled. A piece of soft black Spanish lace, folded  loosely around the throat close to the frillings, but below it, looks  very pretty; or you may get three yards of scarf lace, trim the ends  with frillings, place it around the neck, leaving nearly all the  length in the right hand, the end lying upon the left shoulder being  about half a yard long. Wind the larger piece twice around the throat,  in loose, soft folds, and festoon the other yard and a half, and  fasten with brooch or flower at the side.--_Philadelphia Times._      DISCOVERY OF GOLD IN CALIFORNIA.    It was on the 19th day of January, 1848, that James W. Marshall, while  engaged in digging a race for a saw-mill at Coloma, about thirty-five  miles eastward from Sutter's Fort, found some pieces of yellow metal,  which he and the half-dozen men working with him at the mill supposed to  be gold. He felt confident that he had made a discovery of great  importance, but he knew nothing of either chemistry or gold-mining, so  he could not prove the nature of the metal nor tell how to obtain it in  paying quantities. Every morning he went down to the race to look for  the bits of metal; but the other men at the mill thought Marshall was  very wild in his ideas, and they continued their labors in building the  mill, and in sowing wheat and planting vegetables. The swift current of  the mill-race washed away a considerable body of earthy matter, leaving  the coarse particles of gold behind; so Marshall's collection of  specimens continued to accumulate, and his associates began to think  there might be something in his gold mines after all. About the middle  of February, a Mr. Bennett, one of the party employed at the mill, went  to San Francisco for the purpose of learning whether this metal was  precious, and there he was introduced to Isaac Humphrey, who had washed  for gold in Georgia. The experienced miner saw at a glance that he  had the true stuff before him, and, after a few inquiries, he was  satisfied that the diggings must be rich. He made immediate preparation  to visit the mill, and tried to persuade some of his friends to go with  him; but they thought it would be only a waste of time and money, so he  went with Bennett for his sole companion.    He arrived at Coloma on the 7th of March, and found the work at the  mill going on as if no gold existed in the neighborhood. The next day  he took a pan and spade, and washed some of the dirt in the bottom of  the mill-race in places where Marshall had found his specimens, and,  in a few hours, Humphrey declared that these mines were far richer  than any in Georgia. He now made a rocker and went to work washing  gold industriously, and every day yielded to him an ounce or two of  metal. The men at the mill made rockers for themselves, and all  were soon busy in search of the yellow metal. Everything else was  abandoned; the rumor of the discovery spread slowly. In the middle of  March Pearson B. Reading, the owner of a large ranch at the head of  the Sacramento valley, happened to visit Sutter's Fort, and hearing  of the mining at Coloma, he went thither to see it. He said that if  similarity of formation could be taken as a proof, there must be gold  mines near his ranch; so, after observing the method of washing, he  posted off, and in a few weeks he was at work on the bars of Clear  Creek, nearly two hundred miles northwestward from Coloma. A few  days after Reading had left, John Bidwell, now representative of the  northern district of the State in the lower House of Congress, came to  Coloma, and the result of his visit was that, in less than a month,  he had a party of Indians from his ranch washing gold on the bars of  Feather River, twenty-five miles northwestward from Coloma. Thus the  mines were opened at far distant points.    The first printed notice of the discovery of gold was given in the  California newspaper published in San Francisco on the 10th of March.  On the 29th of May the same paper, announcing that its publication  would be suspended, says: \"The whole country, from San Francisco to  Los Angeles, and from the seashore to the base of the Sierra Nevada,  resound the sordid cry of _gold! gold! gold!_ while the field is left  half planted, the house half built and everything neglected but the  manufacture of pick and shovels, and the means of transportation to  the spot where one man obtained one hundred and twenty-eight dollars'  worth of the real stuff in one day's washing; and the average for all  concerned, is twenty dollars per diem. The first to commence quartz  mining in California were Capt. Win. Jackson and Mr. Eliason, both  Virginians, and the first machine used was a Chilian mill.    The Reid Mine, in North Carolina, was the first gold mine discovered  and worked in the United States, and the only one in North America  from which, up to 1825, gold was sent to the Mint.      HOW TO MAKE ARTIFICIAL GOLD.    The following oroid or imitation gold is sometimes sold for the  genuine article which it closely resembles. Pure copper, 100 parts by  weight, is melted in a crucible, and then 6 parts of magnesia, 3.6 of  sal-ammoniac, 1.8 of quicklime and 9. of tartar are added separately  and gradually in the form of powder. The whole is then stirred for  about half an hour, and 17 parts of zinc or tin in small grains are  thrown in and thoroughly mixed. The [Transcriber's Note: The original  text reads 'cruicible'] crucible is now covered and the mixture kept  melted for half an hour longer, when it is skimmed and poured out.    Any imitation of gold may be detected by its weight, which is not  one-half of what it should be, and by its dissolving in nitric acid  while pure gold is untouched.      HOW TO TELL ANY PERSON'S AGE.    There is a good deal of amusement in the following magical table of  figures. It will enable you to tell how old the young ladies are. Just  hand this table to a young lady, and request her to tell you in which  column or columns her age is contained, and add together the figures  at the top of the columns in which her age is found, and you have  the great secret. Thus, suppose her age to be 17, you will find that  number in the first and fifth columns; add the first figures of these  two columns.    Here is the magic table:           1     2     4     8    16    32         3     3     5     9    17    33         5     6     6    10    18    34         7     7     7    11    19    35         9    10    12    12    20    36        11    11    13    13    21    37        13    14    14    14    22    38        15    15    15    15    23    39        17    18    20    24    24    40        19    19    21    25    25    41        21    22    22    26    26    42        23    23    23    27    27    43        25    26    28    28    28    44        27    27    29    29    29    45            29    30    30    30    30    46        31    31    31    31    31    47        33    34    36    40    48    48        35    35    37    41    49    49        37    38    38    42    50    50        39    39    39    43    51    51        41    42    44    44    52    52        43    43    45    45    53    53        45    46    46    46    54    54        47    47    47    47    55    55        49    50    52    56    56    56        51    51    53    57    57    57        53    54    54    58    58    58        55    55    55    59    59    59        57    58    60    60    60    60        59    59    61    61    61    61        61    62    62    62    62    62        63    63    63    63    63    63      WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE COSTS.    Salary of President, $50,000; additional appropriations are about  $75,000. A total of $125,000. The President has the following corps  of assistants: Private Secretary, $3,250; Assistant Private Secretary,  $2,250; Stenographer, $1,800; five Messengers, $1,200 each, $6,000;  Steward--; two Doorkeepers, $1,200 each, $2,400; two Ushers, $1,200,  $1,400, $2,600; Night Usher, $1,200; Watchman, $900, and a few other  minor clerks and telegraph operators.    SUNDRIES.--Incidental expenses, $8,000; White House repairs--carpets  and refurnishing, $12,500; fuel, $2,500; green-house, $4,000; gas,  matches and stable, $15,000.    These amounts, with others of minor importance, consume the entire  appropriations.      BUSINESS LAW.    Ignorance of the law excuses no one. It is a fraud to conceal a fraud.  The law compels no one to do impossibilities. An agreement without  consideration is void. Signatures made with a lead pencil are good in  law. A receipt for money paid is not legally conclusive. The acts of one  partner bind all the others. Contracts made on Sunday cannot be  enforced. A contract made with a minor is void. A contract made with a  lunatic is void. Principals are responsible for the acts of their  agents. Agents are responsible to their principals for errors. Each  individual in a partnership is responsible for the whole amount of the  debts of the firm. A note given by a minor is void. Notes bear interest  only when so stated. It is legally necessary to say on a note \"for value  received.\" A note drawn on Sunday is void. A note obtained by fraud, or  from a person in a state of intoxication, cannot be collected. If a note  be lost or stolen, it does not release the maker; he must pay it. An  endorser of a note is exempt from liability if not served with notice of  its dishonor within twenty-four hours of its non-payment.      ITEMS WORTH REMEMBERING.    A sun bath is of more worth than much warming by the fire.    Books exposed to the atmosphere keep in better condition than if  confined in a book-case. Pictures are both for use and ornament. They  serve to recall pleasant memories and scenes; they"]]]
