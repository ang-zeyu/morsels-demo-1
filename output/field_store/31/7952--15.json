But Dick grasped his cousin's hand warmly, giving her a look of grateful  affection, and accepted with delight her offered kiss.    \"Now, I will leave you to rest,\" she said to Molly, \"and when you feel  like seeing your cousins, they will be glad to come in and speak to you.  They are anxious to do all they can for your entertainment while you are  here.\"    \"Yes, but I want to see grandpa and Uncle Horace now, please; they just  kissed me in the car, and that was all.\"    They came in at once, full of tender sympathy for the crippled, suffering  child.    \"They're so kind,\" sobbed Molly, as they left the room.    \"Yes, you can appreciate everybody's kindness but your mother's,\" remarked  Enna in a piqued tone, \"and everybody can be sorry for you, but my  feelings are lost sight of entirely.\"    \"Oh, mother, don't!\" sighed Molly. \"I'm sure I've enough to bear without  your reproaches. I'd appreciate you fast enough, if you were such a mother  as Cousin Elsie.\"    \"Or as Aunt Louise, why don't you say?\" said Mrs. Conly, coming in, going  up to the couch, and kissing her. \"How d'ye do, Enna?\"    \"Yes, even you are sorrier for me than mother is, I do believe!\" returned  Molly, bursting into tears; \"and if it was Isa or Virgy you'd be ever so  good to her, and not scold her as mother does me.\"    \"Why, I'm just worn out and worried half to death about that girl,\" said  Enna, in answer to her sister's query. \"She'll never walk a step  again--all the doctors say that.\" At these words Molly was almost  convulsed with sobs, but Enna went on relentlessly. \"And when they asked  her how it happened, she up and told them her high-heeled shoes threw her  down, and that she didn't want to wear them, but I made her do it.\"    \"And so you did, and I only told it because one of the doctors asked if I  didn't know they were dangerous; and when I said yes, he wanted to know  how I came to be so foolish as to wear them.\"    \"And then he lectured me,\" Enna went on, \"as if it was all my fault, when  of course it was her own carelessness; for if it wasn't, why haven't some  of the rest of us fallen down. Accidents happen when nobody's to blame.\"    \"I came near falling the other day, myself,\" said Mrs. Conly, \"and I'll  never wear a high, narrow heel again, nor let one of my girls do so. Now  I'm going out. You two ought to take a nap; Molly especially, poor child!  I'm very sorry for you; but don't cry any more now. It will only hurt  your eyes.\"    Mrs. Conly was to stay to tea and spend the evening. Stepping into the  parlor she found all the adult members of the family there.    \"I want to have a talk with you, Louise,\" her brother said, seating her  comfortably on a sofa and drawing up a chair beside her.    \"And I think I know what about,\" she returned with heightened color,  glancing toward Elsie, \"but let me tell you beforehand, Horace, that you  may as well spare yourself the trouble. I have already accepted Mrs.  Delaford's offer.\"    \"Louise! how could you be so hasty in so important a matter?\"    \"Permit me to answer that question with another,\" she retorted, drawing  herself up haughtily, \"what right have you to call me to an account for so  doing?\"    \"Only the right of an older brother to take a fraternal interest in your  welfare and that of his nieces.\"    \"What is it, mother?\" asked Calhoun.    She told him in a few words, and he turned to his uncle with the query why  he so seriously objected to her acceptance of what seemed so favorable an  offer.    \"Because I think it would be putting in great jeopardy the welfare of your  sisters, temporal and spiritual\"    \"What nonsense, Horace!\" exclaimed Mrs. Conly angrily. \"Of course I shall  expressly stipulate that their faith is not to be interfered with.\"    \"And just as much of course the promise will be given and systematically  broken without the slightest compunction; because in the creed of Rome the  end sanctifies the means and no end is esteemed higher or holier than that  of adding members to her communion.\"    \"Well,\" said Louise, \"I must say you judge them hardly. I'm sure there are  at least some pious ones among them and of course they wouldn't lie.\"    \"You forget that the more pious they are, the more obedient they will be  to the teachings of their church, and when she tells them it is a pious  act to be false to their word or oath, for her advancement, or to burn,  kill and destroy, or to break any other commandment of the decalogue, they  will obey believing that thus they do God service.    \"Really the folly and credulity of Protestant parents who commit their  children to the care of those who teach and put in practice, too, these  two maxims, so utterly destructive of all truth and honesty, all  confidence between man and man--'The end sanctifies the means,' and 'No  faith with heretics,'--is to me perfectly astounding.\"    \"So you consider me a fool,\" said Mrs. Conly, bridling, \"thanks for the  compliment.\"    \"It is you who make the application, Louise,\" he answered. \"I had no  thought of doing so, and still hope you will prove your wisdom by  reconsidering and letting Mrs. Delaford know that you revoke your  decision.\"    \"Indeed I shall not; I consider that I have no right to throw away  Isadore's fortune.\"    \"Have you then a greater right to imperil her soul's salvation?\" he asked  with solemn earnestness.    \"Pshaw! what a serious thing you make of it,\" she exclaimed, yet with an  uneasy and troubled look.    \"Uncle!\" cried Calhoun in surprise, \"do you not think there have been and  are some real Christians in the Romish Church?\"    \"No doubt of it, Cal; some who, spite of her idolatrous teachings, worship  God alone and put their trust solely in the atoning blood and imputed  righteousness of Christ. Yet who can fail to see in the picture of Babylon  the Great so graphically drawn in Revelation, a faithful portraiture of  Rome? And the command is, 'Come out of her, my people, that ye be not  partaker of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.'\"    Mr. Dinsmore paused, but no one seeming to have anything to say in reply,  went on to give his sister a number of instances which had come to his  knowledge, of the perversion of Protestant girls while being educated in  convents.    \"Well,\" she said at last, \"I'm not going to draw back now, but I shall be  on the watch and if they do begin to tamper with my girls' faith I'll  remove them at once. There now I hope you are satisfied!\"    \"Not quite, Louise,\" he said, \"they are accomplished proselyters and may  have the foundations completely and irremediably undermined ere you  suspect that they have begun.\"          CHAPTER THIRTEENTH.        \"Affliction is the wholesome soil of virtue;       Where patience, honor, sweet humanity,       Calm fortitude, take root, and strongly flourish.\"                          --MALLET AND THOMSON'S ALFRED.      A bath, a nap, and a dainty supper had refreshed Molly somewhat before the  children were admitted to her room, but they found her looking pale and  thin, and oh, so sorrowful! so different from the bright, merry, happy  \"Cousin Molly\" of six months ago.    Their little hearts swelled with sympathetic grief, and tears filled their  eyes as one after another they took her hand and kissed her lovingly.    \"Poor child, I so solly for oo!\" said Herbert, and Molly laughed  hysterically, then put her hands over her face, and sobbed as though her  heart would break. First, it was the oddity of being called \"child\" by  such a mere baby, then the thought that she had become an object of pity  to such an one.    \"Don' ky,\" he said, pulling away her hand to kiss her cheek. \"Herbie  didn't mean to make oo ky.\"    \"Come, Herbie dear, let us go now; we mustn't tease poor sick cousin,\"  whispered his sister Elsie, drawing him gently away.    \"No, no! let him stay; let him love me,\" sobbed Molly. \"He is a dear  little fellow,\" she added, returning his caresses, and wiping away her  tears.    \"Herbie will love oo, poor old sing,\" he said, stroking her face, \"and  mamma and papa, and all de folks will be ever so dood to oo.\"    Molly's laugh was more natural this time, and under its inspiring  influence, the little ones grew quite merry, really amusing her with their  prattle, till their mammy came to take them to bed.    Elsie was beginning to say good-night too, thinking there was danger of  wearying the invalid, but Molly said, \"I don't wonder you want to leave  me; mother says nobody could like to stay with such a----\" she broke off  suddenly, again hid her face in her hands and wept bitterly.    \"Oh, no, no! I was only afraid of tiring you,\" Elsie said, leaning over  her and stroking her hair with soft, gentle touch. \"I should like to stay  and talk if you wish; to tell you all about our visit to the Crags, and  mamma's old governess, and----\"    \"Oh, yes, do; anything to help me to forget, even for a few minutes. Oh, I  wish I was dead! I wish I was dead! I can't bear to live and be a  cripple!\"    \"Dear Molly, don't cry, don't feel so dreadfully about it!\" Elsie said,  weeping with her. \"Jesus will help you to bear it; he loves you, and is  sorrier for you than anybody else is; and he won't let you be sick or in  pain in heaven.\"    \"No, he doesn't love me! I'm not good enough; and if he did, he wouldn't  have let me get such a dreadful fall.\"    Little Elsie was perplexed for the moment, and knew not what to answer.    \"Couldn't he have kept me from falling?\" demanded Molly, almost fiercely.    \"Yes, he can do everything.\"    \"Then I hate him for letting me fall!\"    Elsie was inexpressibly shocked. \"Oh, Molly!\" in an awed, frightened tone,  was all that she could say.    \"I'm awfully wicked, I know I am; but I can't help it. Why did he let me  fall? I couldn't bear to let a dog be so dreadfully hurt, if I could help  it!\"    \"Molly, the Bible says 'God is love.'

But then there was all the  housework to do, and, if she had thoughts, she did not often let them  wander outside of the kitchen door. And just now she was baking some  gingerbread, which was in danger of getting burned in the oven. So she  pinned the shawl around the child's neck again, and left her on the  doorstep, saying to herself, as she returned to her work, \"Queer child! I  wonder what kind of a woman she will be!\"    13. But Margery sat on the doorstep, and wondered, as the sea sounded  louder, and the sunshine grew warmer around her. It was all so strange,  and grand, and beautiful! Her heart danced with joy to the music that went  echoing through the wide world from the roots of the sprouting grass to  the great golden blossom of the sun.    14. And when the round, gray eyes closed that night, at the first peep of  the stars, the angels looked down and wondered over Margery. For the  wisdom of the wisest being God has made, ends in wonder; and there is  nothing on earth so wonderful as the budding soul of a little child.      DEFINITIONS.-l. Trudg'ing, walking sturdily. 2. Hues, colors. Ca'lyx, the  outer covering of a flower. 4. Ho-ri'zon, the line where the sky and earth  seem to meet. 5. War'ble, a trill of the voice. Spears, shoots of grass.  Sheaths, coverings.      EXERCISES.--Name the things about which Margery  wondered. What did she wonder about each? What is still  more wonderful than all that at which Margery wondered?        XXXVI. THE CHILD'S WORLD. (103)    1. \"Great, wide, beautiful, wonderful world,     With the wonderful water round you curled,     And the wonderful grass upon your breast,--     World, you are beautifully drest.\"    2. \"The wonderful air is over me,     And the wonderful wind is shaking the tree;     It walks on the water, and whirls the mills,     And talks to itself on the tops of the hills.\"    3. \"You friendly Earth! how far do you go     With the wheat fields that nod, and the rivers that flow;     With cities and gardens, and cliffs and isles,     And people upon you for thousands of miles?\"    4. \"Ah, you are so great, and I am so small,     I tremble to think of you, World, at all:     And yet, when I said my prayers, to-day,     A whisper inside me seemed to say,     You are more than the Earth, though you are such a dot:     You can love and think, and the Earth can not!'\"        XXXVII. SUSIE'S COMPOSITION. (104)    1. Susie Smith came home from school one day, and had no sooner entered  the sitting room than she burst into tears. \"What is the matter, my dear  child?\" said her mother, drawing her daughter to her side and smiling.    2. \"O mother, matter enough,\" sobbed Susie. \"All our class must bring in  compositions to-morrow morning, and I never, never can write one. We must  write twelve lines at least, and I have written only a few words after  trying nearly all the afternoon. See what work I have made of it!\"    3. Mrs. Smith took the rumpled, tear-stained paper which Susie held in her  hand, and glanced at what she had written. In a careful hand she had tried  to write upon three themes: \"Time,\" \"Temperance,\" and \"Industry.\"    4. \"Time is short. We should all improve our time.\" \"Temperance is a very  useful thing.\" \"We should all be industrious if we wish to do anything in  the world.\" These sentences were all she had written.    5. \"Now,\" said Susie, \"I can't think of another word to say upon any of  these subjects, and I know I shall have to go to school without a  composition, for I won't be so mean as to copy one from a book, or to ask  you or papa to write one for me.\"    6. \"That is right, my dear,\" said her mother. \"You will be far happier  with a poor composition, if it is all your own, than with a fine one  written by somebody else. But cheer up. You have not begun right--you have  been trying to write upon subjects that you know nothing about. Run into  the garden and play. I will call you in half an hour.\"    7. \"But my composition,\" began Susie. \"Don't think about your composition  while you are gone,\" said Mrs. Smith, \"but have as pleasant a time as you  can.\"    8. It seemed but a few minutes to Susie before she heard her mother's  voice calling her. She went into the house at once--her hands full of  sweet flowers, and her cheeks rosy with exercise.    9. \"Now, Susie,\" said her mother, \"I want you to sit by the window with  this nice sheet of paper and a pencil, and write something about what you  can see.\" \"But my composition, mother,\" said Susie; \"when shall I begin  that?\" \"Never mind your composition, my dear; do this to please me, and we  will talk about that by and by.\"    10. Susie thought her mother's request was a strange one; but she knew  that she always had a good reason for everything she did: so she took the  paper and pencil, and sat by the window.    11. \"Do not talk to me at all,\" said her mother. \"Look out of the window,  and then write down your thoughts about everything you see.\"    12. Susie could not help laughing, it seemed such a funny thing to be  doing. As she looked out, she first saw the western sky and some bright,  sunset clouds. \"O mother!\" she exclaimed, \"what a splendid sunset!\" \"Don't  talk,\" said her mother, \"but write.\"    13. \"I'll write about the sunset, then,\" said she, and the pencil began to  move rapidly across the paper. In a few moments she said, \"Mother, shall I  read you what I have written?\" \"No, not now,\" answered her mother; \"I am  going into the dining room. You may sit and write until I return.\"    14. As Susie went on writing, she became very much interested in her  occupation, and for a time forgot all about the dreaded composition. She  wrote about the sunset clouds, the appearance of the distant hills, the  trees, the river, the garden with its gay flowers, and the birds flying  past the window.    15. Just as she had reached the bottom of the page, her mother came in.  \"Well, Susie,\" said she, with a smile, \"how does that composition come  on?\" \"Composition!\" exclaimed Susie; \"you told me not to think about my  composition, and I have not thought of it once; I have had such a nice  time writing about what I could see from the window.\"    16. Mrs. Smith took the paper and read aloud what Susie had written: \"I am  sitting on a low seat at the bay window, one half of which is open, so  that I can smell the sweet flowers in the garden. The sky is all bright  with sunset; I can see purple, and pink, and golden. I do not believe that  anyone on earth has a paint box with such lovely colors in it.\"    17. \"I can see one cloud, far above the rest, that looks like a ship  sailing in the blue sea. I should like to sail on a cloud, if it would not  make me dizzy. Now, while I have been writing, the clouds have changed in  color and form, but they are just as beautiful as they were before.\"    18. \"The green hills are tipped with light, and look as if they were  wearing golden crowns. I can see a river a great way off, and it looks  quite still, although I know it is running as fast as it can to get to the  ocean.\"    19. \"The birds are flying past the window to go home and take care of  their little ones. I am glad the birds are not afraid to live in our  garden, and to build nests in our trees.\"    20. \"Our garden is full of flowers--pinks, lilies, and roses. Mother calls  this the month of roses. My birthday will come in a week, and we can have  all the flowers we wish for wreaths and bouquets.\"    21. \"There, Susie,\" said Mrs. Smith, \"that is a very nice composition,  indeed.\" \"A composition!\" exclaimed Susie, \"is that a composition?\" \"Yes,  my dear, and a very good one, too,\" replied her mother. \"When it hasn't  even a subject?\"    22. \"We can find one for it, and I do not doubt it will please your  teacher, as it does me. You see, my dear,\" continued her mother, \"that it  is easy enough to write if you have anything interesting to write about.\"    23. The next morning Susie copied her composition very neatly, and started  to school with a happy heart, saying, as she gave her mother a kiss, \"Just  think how funny it is, dear mother, that I should have written so long a  composition without knowing it.\"      DEFINITIONS.--Com-po-si'tion, that which is thought out and arranged, a  written or literary work. 3. Rum'pled, wrinkled, creased. Themes, subjects  or topics on which a person writes. 10. Re-quest', that which is asked.  14. Oc-cu-pa'tion, that which employs the time. 20. Bou-quets' (pro.  boo-kas'), bunches of flowers.      EXERCISES.--What is a composition? Why was Susie so troubled? Why could  she not write about \"Time,\" \"Temperance,\" or \"Industry\"? What did her  mother have her do? What did Susie write? Was it a composition? Did she  know, at the time, that it was? What fault did she find with it? Can you  give her composition a proper subject?        XXXVIII. THE SUMMER SHOWER. (109)    The author, Thomas Buchanan Read, was born in Chester Co., Pa., March 12,  1822. His life was devoted to the fine arts, and he attained a high  reputation both as artist and poet. He died in New York, May 11, 1872.    1. Before the stout harvesters falleth the grain,     As when the strong stormwind is reaping the plain,     And loiters the boy in the briery lane;     But yonder aslant comes the silvery rain,  Like a long line of spears brightly burnished and tall.    2. Adown the white highway like cavalry fleet,     It dashes the dust with its numberless feet.     Like a murmurless school, in their leafy retreat,     The wild birds sit listening the drops round them beat;  And the boy crouches close to the blackberry wall.    3. The swallows alone take the storm on the wing,     And, taunting the tree-sheltered laborers, sing.     Like pebbles the rain breaks the face of the spring,     While a bubble darts up from each widening ring;  And the boy in dismay hears the loud shower fall.    4.
