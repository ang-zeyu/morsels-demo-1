[S']AKOONTALA                                        [_Reverently_.    My father, I salute you.    KANWA.    My daughter,      May'st thou be highly honoured by thy lord,    E'en as Yayati [S']armishtha adored[64]!    And, as she bore him Puru, so may'st thou    Bring forth a son to whom the world shall bow!    GAUTAMI.    Most venerable father, she accepts your benediction as if she  already possessed the boon it confers.    KANWA.    Now come this way, my child, and walk reverently  round these sacrificial fires.                                              [_They all walk round_.    KANWA.                    [_Repeats a prayer in the metre of the Rig-veda_.      Holy flames, that gleam around    Every altar's hallowed ground;    Holy flames, whose frequent food    Is the consecrated wood,    And for whose encircling bed,    Sacred Ku[s']a-grass is spread [65];    Holy flames, that waft to heaven    Sweet oblations daily given,    Mortal guilt to purge away,    Hear, oh hear me, when I pray--    Purify my child this day!    Now then, my daughter, set out on thy journey.    [_Looking on one side_.]    Where are thy attendants. [S']arngarava and the others?    YOUNG HERMIT.                                        [_Entering_.    Here we are, most venerable father.    KANWA.    Lead the way for thy sister.    [S']ARNGARAVA.    Come, [S']akoontala, let us proceed.                                                    [_All move away_.    KANWA.      Hear me, ye trees that surround our hermitage!    [S']akoontala ne'er moistened in the stream    Her own parched lips, till she had fondly poured    Its purest water on your thirsty roots;    And oft, when she would fain have decked her hair    With your thick-clustering blossoms, in her love    She robbed you not e'en of a single flower.    Her highest joy was ever to behold    The early glory of your opening buds;    Oh, then, dismiss her with a kind farewell.    This very day she quits her father's home,    To seek the palace of her wedded lord.    [_The note of a Koil[66] is heard_.      Hark! heard'st thou not the answer of the trees,    Our sylvan sisters, warbled in the note    Of the melodious Koil[66]? they dismiss    Their dear [S']akoontala with loving wishes.    VOICES IN THE AIR.      Fare thee well, journey pleasantly on amid streams    Where the lotuses bloom, and the sun's glowing beams    Never pierce the deep shade of the wide-spreading trees,    While gently around thee shall sport the cool breeze;    Then light be thy footsteps and easy thy tread,    Beneath thee shall carpets of lilies be spread;    Journey on to thy lord, let thy spirit be gay,    For the smiles of all Nature shall gladden thy way.                                     [_All listen with astonishment_.    GAUTAMI.    Daughter! the nymphs of the wood, who love thee with the  affection of a sister, dismiss thee with kind wishes for thy  happiness. Take thou leave of them reverentially.    [S']AKOONTALA.    [_Bowing respectfully and walking on. Aside to her friend_.    Eager as I am, dear Priyamvada, to see my husband once more, yet  my feet refuse to move, now that I am quitting for ever the home  of my girlhood.    PRIYAMVADA.    You are not the only one, dearest, to feel the bitterness of  parting. As the time of separation approaches, the whole grove  seems to share your anguish.      In sorrow for thy loss, the herd of deer    Forget to browse; the peacock on the lawn    Ceases its dance[67]; the very trees around    Shed their pale leaves, like tears, upon the ground.    [S']AKOONTALA.                             [_Recollecting herself_.    My father, let me, before I go, bid adieu to my pet jasmine, the  Moonlight of the Grove[68]. I love the plant almost as a sister.    KANWA.    Yes, yes, my child, I remember thy sisterly affection for the  creeper. Here it is on the right.    [S']AKOONTALA.                          [_Approaching the jasmine_.    My beloved jasmine! most brilliant of climbing plants, how sweet  it is to see thee cling thus fondly to thy husband, the  mango-tree; yet, prithee, turn thy twining arms for a moment in  this direction to embrace thy sister; she is going far away, and  may never see thee again.    KANWA.      Daughter, the cherished purpose of my heart    Has ever been to wed thee to a man    That should be worthy of thee; such a spouse    Hast thou thyself, by thine own merits, won.    To him thou goest, and about his neck    Soon shalt thou cling confidingly, as now    Thy favourite jasmine twines its loving arms    Around the sturdy mango. Leave thou it    To its protector--e'en as I consign    Thee to thy lord, and henceforth from my mind    Banish all anxious thought on thy behalf.    Proceed on thy journey, my child.    [S']AKOONTALA.                      [_To_ PRIYAMVADA _and_ ANASUYA.    To you, my sweet companions, I leave it as a keepsake. Take  charge of it when I am gone.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.                   [_Bursting into tears_.    And to whose charge do you leave us, dearest? Who will care for  us when you are gone?    KANWA.    For shame, Anasuya! dry your tears. Is this the way to cheer your  friend at a time when she needs your support and consolation?                                                      [_All move on_.    [S']AKOONTALA.    My father, see you there my pet deer, grazing close to the  hermitage? She expects soon to fawn, and even now the weight of  the little one she carries hinders her movements. Do not forget  to send me word when she becomes a mother.    KANWA.    I will not forget it.    [S']AKOONTALA.                       [_Feeling herself drawn back_.    What can this be, fastened to my dress?                                                      [_Turns round_.    KANWA.    My daughter,      It is the little fawn, thy foster-child,    Poor helpless orphan! it remembers well    How with a mother's tenderness and love    Thou didst protect it, and with grains of rice    From thine own hand didst daily nourish it;    And, ever and anon, when some sharp thorn    Had pierced its mouth, how gently thou didst tend    The bleeding wound, and pour in healing balm.    The grateful nursling clings to its protectress,    Mutely imploring leave to follow her.    [S']AKOONTALA.    My poor little fawn! dost thou ask to follow an ungrateful  wretch who hesitates not to desert her companions! When thy  mother died, soon after thy birth, I supplied her place, and  reared thee with my own hand; and now that thy second mother is  about to leave thee, who will care for thee? My father, be thou a  mother to her. My child, go back, and be a daughter to my father.                                                [_Moves on, weeping_.    KANWA.      Weep not, my daughter, check the gathering tear    That lurks beneath thine eyelid, ere it flow    And weaken thy resolve; be firm and true--    True to thyself and me; the path of life    Will lead o'er hill and plain, o'er rough and smooth,    And all must feel the steepness of the way;    Though rugged be thy course, press boldly on.    [S']ARNGARAVA.    Venerable Sire! the sacred precept is:--'Accompany thy friend as  far as the margin of the first stream.' Here, then, we are  arrived at the border of a lake. It is time for you to give us  your final instructions and return.    KANWA.    Be it so; let us tarry for a moment under the shade of this  fig-tree[69].    [_They do so_.    KANWA                                                   [_Aside_.    I must think of some appropriate message to send to his Majesty  King Dushyanta.    [_Reflects_. .    [S']AKOONTALA.                                 [_Aside to_ ANASUYA.    See, see, dear Anasuya, the poor female Chakravaka-bird[70], whom  cruel fate dooms to nightly separation from her mate, calls to  him in mournful notes from the other side of the stream, though  he is only hidden from her view by the spreading leaves of the  water-lily. Her cry is so piteous that I could almost fancy she  was lamenting her hard lot in intelligible words.    ANASUYA    Say not so, dearest:      Fond bird! though sorrow lengthen out her night    Of widowhood, yet with a cry of joy    She hails the morning light that brings her mate    Back to her side. The agony of parting    Would wound us like a sword, but that its edge    Is blunted by the hope of future meeting.    KANWA.    [S']arngarava! when you have introduced [S']akoontala into the  presence of the King, you must give him this message from me:--    [S']ARNGARAVA    Let me hear it, venerable father.    KANWA.    This is it:--      Most puissant prince! we here present before thee    One thou art bound to cherish and receive    As thine own wife; yea, even to enthrone    As thine own queen--worthy of equal love    With thine imperial consorts. So much, Sire,    We claim of thee as justice due to us,    In virtue of our holy character,    In virtue of thine honourable rank,    In virtue of the pure spontaneous love    That secretly grew up 'twixt thee and her,    Without consent or privity of us.    We ask no more--the rest we freely leave    To thy just feeling and to destiny.    [S']ARNGARAVA.    A most suitable message! I will take care to deliver it  correctly.    KANWA.    And, now, my child, a few words of advice for thee. We hermits,  though we live secluded from the world are not ignorant of  worldly matters.    [S']ARNGARAVA.    No, indeed. Wise men are conversant with all subjects.    KANWA.    Listen, then, my daughter. When thou reachest thy husband's  palace, and art admitted into his family,      Honour thy betters; ever be respectful    To those above thee; and, should others share    Thy husband's love, ne'er yield thyself a prey    to jealousy; but ever be a friend,    A loving friend, to those who rival thee    In his affections. Should thy wedded lord    Treat thee with harshness, thou most never be    Harsh in return, but patient and submissive;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12187"],[0,"The Mystery of 31 New Inn (#15)"],[1,"agree with you, Marchmont. I think that is a perfectly sound  position. You have, I suppose, fully considered the question as to  whether it would be possible to set aside the second will on the ground  that it fails to carry out the evident wishes and intentions of the  testator?\"    \"Yes. My partner, Winwood, and I went into that question very carefully,  and we also took counsel's opinion--Sir Horace Barnaby--and he was of  the same opinion as ourselves; that the court would certainly uphold the  will.\"    \"I think that would be my own view,\" said Thorndyke, \"especially after  what you have told me. Do I understand that John Blackmore was the only  person who knew that Jeffrey was in residence at New Inn?\"    \"The only one of his private friends. His bankers knew and so did the  officials from whom he drew his pension.\"    \"Of course he would have to notify his bankers of his change of  address.\"    \"Yes, of course. And a propos of the bank, I may mention that the  manager tells me that, of late, they had noticed a slight change in the  character of Jeffrey's signature--I think you will see the reason of the  change when you hear the rest of his story. It was very trifling; not  more than commonly occurs when a man begins to grow old, especially if  there is some failure of eyesight.\"    \"Was Mr. Jeffrey's eyesight failing?\" asked Thorndyke.    \"Yes, it was, undoubtedly,\" said Stephen. \"He was practically blind in  one eye and, in the very last letter that I ever had from him, he  mentioned that there were signs of commencing cataract in the other.\"    \"You spoke of his pension. He continued to draw that regularly?\"    \"Yes; he drew his allowance every month, or rather, his bankers drew it  for him. They had been accustomed to do so when he was abroad, and the  authorities seem to have allowed the practice to continue.\"    Thorndyke reflected a while, running his eye over the notes on the slips  of paper in his hand, and Marchmont surveyed him with a malicious smile.  Presently the latter remarked:    \"Methinks the learned counsel is floored.\"    Thorndyke laughed. \"It seems to me,\" he retorted, \"that your proceedings  are rather like those of the amiable individual who offered the bear a  flint pebble, that he might crack it and extract the kernel. Your  confounded will seems to offer no soft spot on which one could commence  an attack. But we won't give up. We seem to have sucked the will dry.  Let us now have a few facts respecting the parties concerned in it; and,  as Jeffrey is the central figure, let us begin with him and the tragedy  at New Inn that formed the starting-point of all this trouble.\"          Chapter VI    Jeffrey Blackmore, Deceased      Having made the above proposition, Thorndyke placed a fresh slip of  paper on the blotting pad on his knee and looked inquiringly at Mr.  Marchmont; who, in his turn, sighed and looked at the bundle of  documents on the table.    \"What do you want to know?\" he asked a little wearily.    \"Everything,\" replied Thorndyke. \"You have hinted at circumstances that  would account for a change in Jeffrey's habits and that would explain an  alteration in the character of his signature. Let us have those  circumstances. And, if I might venture on a suggestion, it would be that  we take the events in the order in which they occurred or in which they  became known.\"    \"That's the worst of you, Thorndyke,\" Marchmont grumbled. \"When a case  has been squeezed out to the last drop, in a legal sense, you want to  begin all over again with the family history of every one concerned and  a list of his effects and household furniture. But I suppose you will  have to be humoured; and I imagine that the best way in which to give  you the information you want will be to recite the circumstances  surrounding the death of Jeffrey Blackmore. Will that suit you?\"    \"Perfectly,\" replied Thorndyke; and thereupon Marchmont began:    \"The death of Jeffrey Blackmore was discovered at about eleven o'clock  in the morning of the fifteenth of March. It seems that a builder's man  was ascending a ladder to examine a gutter on number 31, New Inn, when,  on passing a second-floor window that was open at the top, he looked in  and perceived a gentleman lying on a bed. The gentleman was fully  clothed and had apparently lain down on the bed to rest; at least so the  builder thought at the time, for he was merely passing the window on  his way up, and, very properly, did not make a minute examination. But  when, some ten minutes later, he came down and saw that the gentleman  was still in the same position, he looked at him more attentively; and  this is what he noticed--but perhaps we had better have it in his own  words as he told the story at the inquest.    \"'When I came to look at the gentleman a bit more closely, it struck me  that he looked rather queer. His face looked very white, or rather pale  yellow, like parchment, and his mouth was open. He did not seem to be  breathing. On the bed by his side was a brass object of some kind--I  could not make out what it was--and he seemed to be holding some small  metal object in his hand. I thought it rather a queer affair, so, when I  came down I went across to the lodge and told the porter about it. The  porter came out across the square with me and I showed him the window.  Then he told me to go up the stairs to Mr. Blackmore's chambers on the  second pair and knock and keep on knocking until I got an answer. I went  up and knocked and kept on knocking as loud as I could, but, though I  fetched everybody out of all the other chambers in the house, I couldn't  get any answer from Mr. Blackmore. So I went downstairs again and then  Mr. Walker, the porter, sent me for a policeman.    \"'I went out and met a policeman just by Dane's Inn and told him about  the affair, and he came back with me. He and the porter consulted  together, and then they told me to go up the ladder and get in at the  window and open the door of the chambers from the inside. So I went up;  and as soon as I got in at the window I saw that the gentleman was dead.  I went through the other room and opened the outer door and let in the  porter and the policeman.'    \"That,\" said Mr. Marchmont, laying down the paper containing the  depositions, \"is the way in which poor Jeffrey Blackmore's death came to  be discovered.    \"The constable reported to his inspector and the inspector sent for the  divisional surgeon, whom he accompanied to New Inn. I need not go into  the evidence given by the police officers, as the surgeon saw all that  they saw and his statement covers everything that is known about  Jeffrey's death. This is what he says, after describing how he was sent  for and arrived at the Inn:    \"'In the bedroom I found the body of a man between fifty and sixty years  of age, which has since been identified in my presence as that of Mr.  Jeffrey Blackmore. It was fully dressed and wore boots on which was a  moderate amount of dry mud. It was lying on its back on the bed, which  did not appear to have been slept in, and showed no sign of any struggle  or disturbance. The right hand loosely grasped a hypodermic syringe  containing a few drops of clear liquid which I have since analysed and  found to be a concentrated solution of strophanthin.    \"'On the bed, close to the left side of the body, was a brass opium-pipe  of a pattern which I believe is made in China. The bowl of the pipe  contained a small quantity of charcoal, and a fragment of opium  together with some ash, and there was on the bed a little ash which  appeared to have dropped from the bowl when the pipe fell or was laid  down. On the mantelshelf in the bedroom I found a small glass-stoppered  jar containing about an ounce of solid opium, and another, larger jar  containing wood charcoal broken up into small fragments. Also a bowl  containing a quantity of ash with fragments of half-burned charcoal and  a few minute particles of charred opium. By the side of the bowl were a  knife, a kind of awl or pricker and a very small pair of tongs, which I  believe to have been used for carrying a piece of lighted charcoal to  the pipe.    \"'On the dressing-table were two glass tubes labelled \"Hypodermic  Tabloids: Strophanthin 1/500 grain,\" and a minute glass mortar and  pestle, of which the former contained a few crystals which have since  been analysed by me and found to be strophanthin.    \"'On examining the body, I found that it had been dead about twelve  hours. There were no marks of violence or any abnormal condition  excepting a single puncture in the right thigh, apparently made by the  needle of the hypodermic syringe. The puncture was deep and vertical in  direction as if the needle had been driven in through the clothing.    \"'I made a post-mortem examination of the body and found that death was  due to poisoning by strophanthin, which appeared to have been injected  into the thigh. The two tubes which I found on the dressing-table would  each have contained, if full, twenty tabloids, each tabloid  representing one five-hundredth of a grain of strophanthin. Assuming  that the whole of this quantity was injected the amount taken would be  forty five-hundredths, or about one twelfth of a grain. The ordinary  medicinal dose of strophanthin is one five-hundredth of a grain.    \"'I also found in the body appreciable traces of morphine--the principal  alkaloid of opium--from which I infer that the deceased was a confirmed  opium-smoker. This inference was supported by the general condition of  the body, which was ill-nourished and emaciated and presented all the  appearances usually met with in the bodies of persons addicted to the  habitual use of opium.'    \"That is the evidence of the surgeon. He was recalled later, as we shall  see, but, meanwhile, I think you will agree with me that the facts  testified to by him fully account, not only for the change in Jeffrey's  habits--his solitary and secretive"]]]
