Most sumptuous was the entertainment provided for them. Hunting and  fishing expeditions, picnics and balls went on from morning till  night, and all the night through, so that there was not time even to  think of sleep, only feasting and pleasure the whole week long.    So well, indeed, did the younger sister enjoy this, that by the end of  the week she had begun to think perhaps after all her host's beard was  not so very blue, and that it would be a fine thing to be the mistress  of such a magnificent mansion, and the wife of such a rich husband.    And so, not long afterwards, there was a grand wedding, and the  widow's younger daughter became Mrs. Bluebeard.    About a month later, Bluebeard told his wife that he must leave her  for several weeks, having to travel on business.    \"While I am absent, my dear,\" said he, \"invite your relations and  friends and enjoy yourself just as you please in entertaining them.  See here are my keys, the keys of the rooms and of the chests where I  keep my money, my gold and silver plate, and my jewels. Unlock rooms  and chests and use freely what you will.\"    [Illustration]    \"This small key,\" he added, pointing to quite a little one, \"is the  key of the door at the end of the lower landing, you will not need to  use this at all. In fact, should you open that door, or even put this  key into the lock, I should be dreadfully angry, indeed I should make  you suffer for it in a terrible way.\"    Then Bluebeard bid his wife good-bye, and departed.    As soon as Mrs. Bluebeard's friends and relations knew that her  husband was away, they came flocking to visit her, for they longed to  see all her splendid possessions, but had feared to come before.    They could not enough admire the magnificent apartments, and ran from  one to another praising everything they beheld.    But the young wife heeded nothing they said or did, all she thought  of was that little key which she must not use, wondering more and more  why she ought not to open that one particular door.    At last she could bear it no longer, but slipping away from her  visitors, she ran along the passages and stairs, nearly falling down  them, so great was her haste, until she came to that door at the end  of the corridor.    Not pausing an instant, she thrust the key into the lock, and the door  sprang open.    At first she could distinguish nothing, for the room was dark and  gloomy, but then, all of a sudden, she knew what had become of  Bluebeard's other wives, for there they lay, in a long, straight row,  all dead. She stood horrified for a moment or two, gazing at the  pale faces, and long hair spread out around them, then picking up  the little key which she had taken from the lock but dropped in her  fright, she hastily quitted the room, shut and locked the door, and  ran to her own chamber to calm herself before returning to her guests.  But she was unable to rest for an instant, so dreadful were her  feelings; then with terror she noticed that on the key there was a  stain. She wiped it with her handkerchief, but alas! it was blood that  would not be wiped away. She washed the key and rubbed it, and  scraped it and polished it, but all to no purpose, if she succeeded  in cleansing one side, the mark came out on the other. For the key was  enchanted.    [Illustration: _Painted by Jennie Harbour_  BLUEBEARD]    That same evening Bluebeard returned saying he had met the man whom  he was wanting to see, and so the long journey was unnecessary, and he  was rejoiced to be at home again.    Next morning he called for the keys; his wife brought them to him,  but not the little one; that she left behind. Bluebeard noticed this  directly and sent her to fetch it. Trembling, and white as a sheet,  she was forced to give it into his hand.    \"Ha! what is this?\" he cried, \"what is this stain that I see!\"    His poor wife trembled still more, and could not speak.    \"Wretched woman!\" shouted Bluebeard, \"you have used this key, you have  unlocked the door of that room at the end of the passage. You shall  die!!!\"    In vain did his wife plead with him to spare her, kneeling before him  with tears streaming from her eyes. \"You shall die!\" he cried again,  more savagely than before.    \"Let me have a few moments alone, to prepare for death,\"    \"Half a quarter of an hour, but not a moment longer,\" he replied, and  left her.    The poor young woman hastened to a room at the foot of the turret  stairs where was her Sister Anne, and called to her.    \"Sister Anne, Sister Anne, look from the tower window. Can you see no  one coming?\" And Sister Anne, looking out, answered:    \"Alas! No! Nothing but the green grass, and the sun which shines upon  it.\"    Bluebeard shouted from below that the time was almost up.    \"Sister Anne, Sister Anne, look once again, can you see no one  coming?\" whispered the young wife wringing her hands. Her brothers,  she knew, were to visit her that day--if only they would come in time!    \"Alas, No!\" Sister Anne replied. \"I see a cloud of dust, but it is  only a flock of sheep on the road.\"    But now Bluebeard bawled out so loudly for his wife to come down, that  the whole house shook.    \"Sister Anne, Sister Anne, tell me is no one coming?\"    \"I see two horsemen afar off,\" cried Sister Anne. \"I will beckon to  them to hasten hither.\"    But Bluebeard would wait not a moment longer, and nearly dead with  terror his wife descended, still entreating him to spare her life.    He would not, however, give heed to her prayers, and was just  brandishing his sword, so that it might come down straight and true  upon her slender neck, when the door burst open and two young army  officers came rushing in, whom Bluebeard recognised as the brothers  of his wife. He swiftly fled, but they speedily followed, and for his  many crimes slew him then and there.    All his wealth now belonged to his widow, and she gratefully rewarded  her brothers by purchasing them commissions in the army; she settled  a large sum of money upon her sister, and after a while she married  again, and with a good husband lived a happy life.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          BEAUTY AND THE BEAST      Once upon a time, a long while ago, there was a Beast.    He was a Great Beast, and lived in a Great Castle that stood in the  middle of a Great Park, and everybody in the country held the Beast in  great fear. In fact everything about the Beast was great; his roar was  great and terrific and could be heard for miles around the park, and  when he roared the people trembled.    Nobody ever saw the Beast, which was by no means remarkable, for the  Beast never came out of his Park, and no one, I can assure you, ever  ventured on to his estate.    But matters were not allowed to remain like this for ever, for  something very wonderful happened to the Beast and to somebody else,  and if that something had not happened this story would never have  been written.    About two miles and three quarters from the Castle gates there lived  a rich merchant and his three daughters. The two elder girls were ugly  disagreeable things, and although they had all they could wish for to  make them happy they were always grumbling; but the youngest daughter,  whose name was Beauty, was very pretty, and her nature was happy and  good, her presence was sunshine, and she was the joy of her father's  heart.    Well, one day the two elder sisters had something to grumble about  with a vengeance, for a telegram arrived to say that the merchant was  no longer a rich merchant, for he had lost all his money.    So the horses and carriages had to be sold, and everything that was  of value was got rid of, the servants were sent away, and the merchant  and his daughters had to do their own work.    Dear me, it was shocking, the way those two sisters grumbled, but  Beauty, oh dear no, she was all smiles, for her heart was as sunny as  ever, as she rolled up the sleeves of her print frock, and cooked the  dinner, and scrubbed the floors, and made herself useful, here, there,  and everywhere.    Things had been going on like this for about three months, when one  fine morning another telegram boy came with another telegram to say  that somebody who owed the merchant a great deal of money was ready to  pay the debt, and all the merchant had to do was to go to the city and  get it.    Of course, everybody was delighted at this good news, and the merchant  didn't waste any time, but started off to the city at once.    \"Mind you bring me something back,\" said the eldest daughter as he was  starting.    \"What shall it be?\" asked the merchant.    \"A white satin dress trimmed with lace and pearls,\" said his eldest  daughter.    \"And you must bring me something too, please, father,\" said the second  daughter.    \"And what do you want,\" asked the merchant.    \"A purse full of gold so that I can buy what I want myself,\" said the  second daughter.    \"I will try and do what you both ask,\" he said, \"and what shall I  bring for my Beauty?\"    \"I will wait a little for my dresses and things,\" replied the smiling  Beauty, as she helped her father on with his cloak, \"but I should like  you to bring me home a rose, a lovely red rose, if you can.\"    So her father kissed her, and promised he would bring her the rose,  and went on his way full of hopes.    What a pity it is that our hopes cannot be always realized, and that  we are so often doomed to disappointment! When the merchant arrived at  the city, to his dismay he found that the man who owed him the money  was still unable to pay him, the man had been disappointed himself at  the last moment.    So the unhappy father had to return home without the white satin dress  trimmed with lace and pearls, and without the bag of money, and he  dreaded meeting his two daughters, for he knew they would be terribly  angry.

[In working the following Embroidery Patterns it will be found advisable  to trace the design clearly upon tracing-paper with a sharp-pointed lead  pencil. The pattern thus traced must be perforated with a fine needle in  a succession of tiny holes, at the rate of about twenty to the inch.  Those ladies who possess a sewing-machine will find no difficulty in  accomplishing this. Several thicknesses of paper can be perforated at  the same time, if required, by any ordinary machine. To transfer the  traced and perforated design to the fabric to be embroidered, it is only  necessary to rub a small quantity of powder blue through the holes.]      131.--_Insertion in Embroidery_.
