By this time it was exactly half after seven in the morning: I  was then under the half-deck at the great cabin door; and all at once  I heard the people in the waist cry out, most fearfully--'The Lord  have mercy upon us! We are all lost! The Lord have mercy upon us!' Mr.  Mondle hearing the cries, immediately ran out of his cabin; and we  were instantly struck by the Lynne, a forty-gun ship, Captain Clark,  which nearly ran us down. This ship had just put about, and was by the  wind, but had not got full headway, or we must all have perished; for  the wind was brisk. However, before Mr. Mondle had got four steps from  his cabin-door, she struck our ship with her cutwater right in the  middle of his bed and cabin, and ran it up to the combings of the  quarter-deck hatchway, and above three feet below water, and in a  minute there was not a bit of wood to be seen where Mr. Mondle's cabin  stood; and he was so near being killed that some of the splinters tore  his face. As Mr. Mondle must inevitably have perished from this  accident had he not been alarmed in the very extraordinary way I have  related, I could not help regarding this as an awful interposition of  Providence for his preservation. The two ships for some time swinged  alongside of each other; for ours being a fire-ship, our  grappling-irons caught the Lynne every way, and the yards and rigging  went at an astonishing rate. Our ship was in such a shocking condition  that we all thought she would instantly go down, and every one ran for  their lives, and got as well as they could on board the Lynne; but our  lieutenant being the aggressor, he never quitted the ship. However,  when we found she did not sink immediately, the captain came on board  again, and encouraged our people to return and try to save her. Many  on this came back, but some would not venture. Some of the ships in  the fleet, seeing our situation, immediately sent their boats to our  assistance; but it took us the whole day to save the ship with all  their help. And by using every possible means, particularly frapping  her together with many hawsers, and putting a great quantity of tallow  below water where she was damaged, she was kept together: but it was  well we did not meet with any gales of wind, or we must have gone to  pieces; for we were in such a crazy condition that we had ships to  attend us till we arrived at Belle-Isle, the place of our destination;  and then we had all things taken out of the ship, and she was properly  repaired. This escape of Mr. Mondle, which he, as well as myself,  always considered as a singular act of Providence, I believe had a  great influence on his life and conduct ever afterwards.    Now that I am on this subject I beg leave to relate another instance  or two which strongly raised my belief of the particular interposition  of Heaven, and which might not otherwise have found a place here, from  their insignificance. I belonged for a few days in the year 1758 to  the Jason, of fifty-four guns, at Plymouth; and one night, when I was  on board, a woman, with a child at her breast, fell from the  upper-deck down into the hold, near the keel. Every one thought that  the mother and child must be both dashed to pieces; but, to our great  surprise, neither of them was hurt. I myself one day fell headlong  from the upper-deck of the AEtna down the after-hold, when the ballast  was out; and all who saw me fall cried out I was killed: but I  received not the least injury. And in the same ship a man fell from  the mast-head on the deck without being hurt. In these, and in many  more instances, I thought I could plainly trace the hand of God,  without whose permission a sparrow cannot fall. I began to raise my  fear from man to him alone, and to call daily on his holy name with  fear and reverence: and I trust he heard my supplications, and  graciously condescended to answer me according to his holy word, and  to implant the seeds of piety in me, even one of the meanest of his  creatures.    When we had refitted our ship, and all things were in readiness for  attacking the place, the troops on board the transports were ordered  to disembark; and my master, as a junior captain, had a share in the  command of the landing. This was on the 8th of April. The French were  drawn up on the shore, and had made every disposition to oppose the  landing of our men, only a small part of them this day being able to  effect it; most of them, after fighting with great bravery, were cut  off; and General Crawford, with a number of others, were taken  prisoners. In this day's engagement we had also our lieutenant killed.    On the 21st of April we renewed our efforts to land the men, while all  the men of war were stationed along the shore to cover it, and fired  at the French batteries and breastworks from early in the morning till  about four o'clock in the evening, when our soldiers effected a safe  landing. They immediately attacked the French; and, after a sharp  encounter, forced them from the batteries. Before the enemy retreated  they blew up several of them, lest they should fall into our hands.  Our men now proceeded to besiege the citadel, and my master was  ordered on shore to superintend the landing of all the materials  necessary for carrying on the siege; in which service I mostly  attended him. While I was there I went about to different parts of the  island; and one day, particularly, my curiosity almost cost me my  life. I wanted very much to see the mode of charging the mortars and  letting off the shells, and for that purpose I went to an English  battery that was but a very few yards from the walls of the citadel.  There, indeed, I had an opportunity of completely gratifying myself in  seeing the whole operation, and that not without running a very great  risk, both from the English shells that burst while I was there, but  likewise from those of the French. One of the largest of their shells  bursted within nine or ten yards of me: there was a single rock close  by, about the size of a butt; and I got instant shelter under it in  time to avoid the fury of the shell. Where it burst the earth was torn  in such a manner that two or three butts might easily have gone into  the hole it made, and it threw great quantities of stones and dirt to  a considerable distance. Three shot were also fired at me and another  boy who was along with me, one of them in particular seemed        \"Wing'd with red lightning and impetuous rage;\"    for with a most dreadful sound it hissed close by me, and struck a  rock at a little distance, which it shattered to pieces. When I saw  what perilous circumstances I was in, I attempted to return the  nearest way I could find, and thereby I got between the English and  the French centinels. An English serjeant, who commanded the outposts,  seeing me, and surprised how I came there, (which was by stealth along  the seashore), reprimanded me very severely for it, and instantly took  the centinel off his post into custody, for his negligence in  suffering me to pass the lines. While I was in this situation I  observed at a little distance a French horse, belonging to some  islanders, which I thought I would now mount, for the greater  expedition of getting off. Accordingly I took some cord which I had  about me, and making a kind of bridle of it, I put it round the  horse's head, and the tame beast very quietly suffered me to tie him  thus and mount him. As soon as I was on the horse's back I began to  kick and beat him, and try every means to make him go quick, but all  to very little purpose: I could not drive him out of a slow pace.  While I was creeping along, still within reach of the enemy's shot, I  met with a servant well mounted on an English horse. I immediately  stopped; and, crying, told him my case; and begged of him to help me,  and this he effectually did; for, having a fine large whip, he began  to lash my horse with it so severely, that he set off full speed with  me towards the sea, while I was quite unable to hold or manage him. In  this manner I went along till I came to a craggy precipice. I now  could not stop my horse; and my mind was filled with apprehensions of  my deplorable fate should he go down the precipice, which he appeared  fully disposed to do: I therefore thought I had better throw myself  off him at once, which I did immediately with a great deal of  dexterity, and fortunately escaped unhurt. As soon as I found myself  at liberty I made the best of my way for the ship, determined I would  not be so fool-hardy again in a hurry.    We continued to besiege the citadel till June, when it surrendered.  During the siege I have counted above sixty shells and carcases in the  air at once. When this place was taken I went through the citadel, and  in the bomb-proofs under it, which were cut in the solid rock; and I  thought it a surprising place, both for strength and building:  notwithstanding which our shots and shells had made amazing  devastation, and ruinous heaps all around it.    After the taking of this island our ships, with some others commanded  by Commodore Stanhope in the Swiftsure, went to Basse-road, where we  blocked up a French fleet. Our ships were there from June till  February following; and in that time I saw a great many scenes of war,  and stratagems on both sides to destroy each others fleet. Sometimes  we would attack the French with some ships of the line; at other times  with boats; and frequently we made prizes. Once or twice the French  attacked us by throwing shells with their bomb-vessels: and one day as  a French vessel was throwing shells at our ships she broke from her  springs, behind the isle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15435"],[0,"Object Lessons on the Human Body (#15)"],[1,"you  about when we make up our blackboard outline.    Tobacco, like alcohol, is a narcotic; that is, it soothes pain and produces  sleep. Alcohol acts first upon the nerves; tobacco upon the muscles, which  it weakens and causes to tremble. It often causes palpitation of the heart.    If the skin is scratched or punctured, and tobacco poison put into the  wound, it will do the same harm as if it were taken into the stomach.  Tobacco is so dangerous that physicians do not use it much as a medicine.    _HARM DONE IN THE STOMACH._--You remember that after alcohol has been  swallowed, the little mouths of the stomach take it up and carry it to the  liver, which sends it with the blood to different parts of the body.    Tobacco, as we have already told you, poisons more slowly. People do not  swallow it purposely, yet some of it goes down, accidentally, into the  stomach with the saliva, and makes trouble there, causing nausea and  vomiting when taken for the first time. By and by the stomach seems to take  the poison without being hurt, but it really suffers from dyspepsia or  other diseases, and often loses its appetite for wholesome food.    _HARM DONE IN THE MOUTH, THROAT, AND LUNGS._--The mouth takes in some of  the poison through the pores of the membrane, or skin, which lines it;  those who smoke, sometimes have what is called \"smokers' sore throat\";  besides this, the senses of taste and smell arc more or less injured by  nicotine and the other poisons in tobacco.    The fumes, or smoke, from the weed fills the air with poisonous vapor which  irritates the lungs, not only of the smoker, but of all who are where they  must breathe the same atmosphere. Lungs thus irritated are liable to become  diseased.    Cigarettes are still more injurious than cigars because of the smoke from  their paper coverings; also, because from the way they are made, more of  the tobacco poison goes into the lungs. The cheap cigarette which boys use  is made from cast-away cigar stumps and other filthy things.    _HARM DONE IN THE BRAIN AND NERVES._--The smoker feels so rested and  comfortable, after his cigar, and his brain is so rested, that he does not  think about the mischief that is going on among its blood-vessels and  nerves; perhaps he has never heard that tobacco, snuffed, chewed, or smoked  hurts the brain, and does not learn about it until he finds he is losing  his memory, that his mind is not so strong to think as it should be, and  his will too weak to help him conquer his love for the snuff, tobacco, or  cigar, when he wishes to stop using it. He has become the slave of tobacco,  and it is not easy to get free from his cruel enemy.    The nerves also lose their power, or become more or less paralyzed by  nicotine and the other tobacco poisons.    _MORE ABOUT THE HARM DONE BY TOBACCO._--Some persons who continue to use  tobacco are strong enough to throw off the poison through the lungs, the  skin, and in other ways; but how much better it would be if they were not  obliged to employ their strength in getting rid of that which does them no  good, which only gives a little pleasure to nobody but themselves, and  often makes those suffer who are compelled to remain where they are having  \"a good smoke.\" Beside, their breath and clothing have the tobacco odor,  which not only makes the air impure, but is disagreeable to most people.    If this be true of smoking, what shall we say about the filthy habit of  chewing, and the utterly useless and disgusting practice of taking snuff,  which injures the voice as well as the senses of taste and smell?    And what about spitting tobacco juice on the floors of cars, steamboats,  churches,--any place where it is convenient for the man or boy who has lost  his common politeness in his love for tobacco?    We must not forget that cigars, etc., cost money. No one who smokes, chews,  or snuffs would throw away dollars and cents which might be put into the  savings bank, or used in buying something worth having for himself or  somebody else.    Lastly, we would have you know that tobacco causes thirst, and this often  leads to drinking alcoholic liquors. Some one who has studied this subject,  says that \"nine out of ten of the boys and young men who become drunkards  have first learned to smoke or chew tobacco.\" A New York daily paper gave a  list of 294 cases of insanity caused by drinking, in 246 of which the  whiskey drinking followed tobacco chewing.    Tobacco and alcohol make thousands of wretched homes, and send a great many  people to prison or to the insane asylum; so we entreat you to turn from  beer, wine, and all alcoholic liquors as you would from a serpent, and say  No, when tempted to smoke a cigar or use tobacco in any form.    Do this all the more decidedly because, as we have told you before, alcohol  and tobacco hurt children and young persons in every way more than they  injure any one else. If you have begun to use these poisons, give them up  this very day, before the habit of using them becomes too strong for you to  break.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS ON THE USE OF TOBACCO.

It makes a person feel very pleasant and happy for a little while, then so  horribly wretched that he takes more of the poison to forget his misery. So  he keeps on until mind and body are a complete wreck.
