It is better to be killed  by them than to be bitten by the ducks and pecked by the hens.\"    So he flew into the water and swam towards the beautiful birds. They saw  the duckling and came sailing down toward him. He bowed his head saying,  \"Kill me, oh, kill me.\"    But what was this he saw in the clear water? It was his own image, and  lo! he was no longer a clumsy dark-gray bird, but a--swan, a beautiful  white swan. It matters not if one was born in a duck yard, if one has  only lain in a swan's egg. The other swans swam around him to welcome  him.    [Illustration: The little children see the new swan]    Some little children came into the garden with corn and other grains  which they threw into the water. The smallest one cried, \"Oh, see! there  is a new swan, and it is more beautiful than any of the others.\"    The ugly duckling was shy and at first hid his head under his wing. Then  he felt so happy that he raised his neck and said, \"I never dreamed of  so much happiness when I was an ugly duckling.\"    --HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN.          THE WHITE BLACKBIRD    I      I was born a blackbird in a bushy thicket near a meadow. My father took  good care of his family and would peck about all day for insects. These  he brought home to my mother, holding them by the tail so as not to mash  them. He had a sweet voice, too, and every evening sang beautiful songs.    I should have been happy, but I was not. I ate little and was weak; and  from the first, I was different from my brothers and sisters. They had  glossy, black feathers, while mine were dirty gray. These made my father  angry whenever he looked at them.    When I moulted for the first time, he watched me closely. While the  feathers were falling out and while I was naked, he was kind; but my new  feathers drove him wild with anger. I did not wonder. I was no longer  even gray; I had become snow white. I was a white blackbird! Did such a  thing ever happen in a blackbird family before?    It made me very sad to see my father so vexed over me. But it is hard to  stay sad forever, and one sunshiny spring day I opened my bill and began  to sing. At the first note my father flew up into the air like a  sky-rocket.    \"What do I hear?\" he cried. \"Is that the way a blackbird whistles? Do I  whistle that way?\"    \"I whistle the best I can,\" I replied.    \"That is not the way we whistle in my family,\" my father said. \"We have  whistled for many, many years and know how to do it. It is not enough  for you to be white; you must make that horrible noise. The truth is you  are not a blackbird.\"    \"I will leave home,\" I answered with a sob. \"I will go far away where I  can pick up a living on earthworms and spiders.\"    \"Do as you please,\" my father said. \"You are not a blackbird.\"      II      I flew away early the next morning, and was lucky enough to find shelter  under an old gutter. It rained hard that night. I was just about to go  to bed, when a very wet bird came in and sat down beside me. His  feathers were grayish like mine, but he was much larger than myself.    \"Who are you?\" he asked.    \"I don't know,\" I replied. \"I pass for a blackbird but I am white.\"    \"I am the finest bird in the world,\" he said. \"I am a carrier pigeon and  carry messages.\"    Then I saw that a traveling bag hung from his neck.    \"Maybe I am a pigeon,\" I said, \"since I am not a blackbird.\"    \"No,\" he answered, \"a runt like you could not be a pigeon.\"    The next morning the pigeon sprang from the gutter and flew away as fast  as the wind. As I was lonely, I followed him. He flew faster and faster,  but I kept up for a good while. At last my strength gave out and I fell  down into a meadow.    I was stunned by the fall. When I came to my senses, two birds stood  near by looking at me. One was a dainty little magpie; the other a  soft-eyed turtle dove. The magpie kindly offered me some berries she had  gathered.    \"Who are you?\" she asked.    [Illustration: The three birds meet]    \"A blackbird or a pigeon,\" I said sadly. \"I don't know which.\"    \"Are you joking?\" she cried. \"You are a magpie.\"    \"But magpies are not white,\" I said.    \"Russian magpies are,\" she answered; \"perhaps you belong to that  family.\"    My joy was great for a moment at finding out what I was. Still I was not  sure that I was a magpie and thought I might settle the matter by  singing. I burst into song and warbled and whistled, and whistled and  warbled.    The magpie looked at me in surprise. Then her face grew sad and she  backed off from me. At last she flew away without another word. Whatever  I might be, I was not a magpie--not even a Russian magpie.    I made up my mind not to rest until I found out what bird I was. So I  flew off to a place where birds of all kinds met to talk and enjoy  themselves. There were robins and sparrows and crows and wrens and  martins and every sort of bird. But I was not like any of them and  whenever I began to sing, they all laughed.    \"You are not one of us,\" they said; \"you are a white blackbird. That is  what you are.\"      III      I had now seen all the birds, but none of them were as fine as the  blackbirds. I did not want to be like any of these birds; I longed to be  a blackbird, a real blackbird. That was not possible. So I made up my  mind to be content with my lot, as I had the heart of a blackbird even  if I were not black.    A great flock of blackbirds lived on the edge of a cornfield. I went to  them and asked them to let me be their helper.    \"I am only a white blackbird,\" I said, \"but I have the heart of a true  blackbird.\"    They let me stay. I waited on them early and late, bringing straw to  make nests and tender little worms for the baby blackbirds. The old  birds were kind to me, and I began to be happy.    Hard work did me good. I soon grew strong, and when the crows tried to  drive us away, I led the blackbirds to victory. My sight was keen, and I  was the first to find out that the scarecrow was not a man. I caught  more worms, too, than any of the blackbirds.    By and by a strange thing happened. I saw one day that my white feathers  were speckled with brown dots. They grew larger and larger until the  dots covered me all over; I was no longer white but brown. And now,  little by little, my brown coat turned darker and darker until one  morning it was black--a rich, glossy black! I was a blackbird at last.    Then the other blackbirds hopped around me with joy, crying, \"He is the  largest and bravest of the blackbirds. Let him be king! Long live the  king of the blackbirds!\"    --ALFRED DE MUSSET (_Adapted_).          THE BROWN THRUSH        There's a merry brown thrush sitting up in        the tree,    He's singing to me! He's singing to me!    And what does he say, little girl, little boy?    \"Oh, the world's running over with joy!      Don't you hear? don't you see?      Hush! look! in my tree,    I'm as happy as happy can be!\"      And the brown thrush keeps singing, \"A nest       do you see,    And five eggs hid by me in the juniper tree?    Don't meddle! don't touch! little girl, little boy,    Or the world will lose some of its joy!      Now I'm glad! now I'm free!      And I always shall be,    If you never bring sorrow to me.\"      So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree,    To you and to me, to you and to me.    --LUCY LARCOM.          THE KING AND THE GOOSEHERD    ACT I      (King in plain clothes had gone out for a walk in the park. He sat under  a tree to read a book and fell asleep. When he waked up he walked on,  forgetting his book. He sees a lad looking after a flock of geese and  calls him.)    KING: Boy, I left a book lying under a tree in the park. Will you please  get it for me? If you do, I will give you a gold piece.    BOY: Give me a gold piece to go to the park, indeed! You must have a  pocketful of gold pieces. Or you must think me more stupid than I am.    KING: Stupid! Who thinks you stupid?    BOY: Why, who would be so foolish as to give me a gold piece just for  running half a mile for a book? No, no, you are joking. You couldn't  make me believe that.    KING: Well, you know \"seeing is believing.\" Look! here is the gold piece  for you.    BOY: But it is in _your_ hand. If I saw it in my own hand, that would be  a different matter.    KING (_laughing_): You are certainly not stupid, my boy; but you may  have it in your own hand. Here it is.    (Boy stands still, looking worried,)    KING: Well, why don't you go?    BOY: I only wish I could. But what would become of the geese while I am  away? If they strayed into the meadow over yonder, I should have to pay  trespass-money--more than the gold piece--and lose my place besides.    KING: I'll tell you what we'll do. You go for the book, and I'll herd  the geese.    BOY (_laughing_): You herd the geese--a pretty gooseherd you would make!  You are too fat and too old.    KING (_to himself, shaking with laughter_): Well, Well, \"fat and old.\"  What next, I wonder!    BOY: Why, you couldn't mind the geese. Just look at the \"court gander\"  there--the one with the black head and wings. He is the ringleader  whenever there is any mischief. He would lead you a pretty dance.    KING: Never mind the geese. I'll answer for them, and I promise to pay  all damages if they get away.    BOY (_handing the king his whip_): Well, then, be careful. Watch the  \"court gander.\"    (Boy walks on a few feet, then hurries back.)    KING: What's the matter now?    BOY: Crack the whip!    (King tries but fails.)    BOY: Just as I thought. Here, this way! Can't you see? You are stupid!    KING: Just let me try once more.    (King tries.)    BOY: Well, that did pretty well.    (Moves off muttering.)    He is as big a goose as any in the flock.

But although the present six-day 20 knot boats  are of extreme size and power, and date only from the last two or  three years, still the world of travelers declares itself unsatisfied.  Already we hear that another day must be struck off, and that five-day  steamers have become a necessity of modern requirements, keeping up a  continuous ocean speed of 231/2 knots to 24 knots. Shipbuilders and  engineers are ashamed to mention the word _impossible_; and designers  are already at work, as we saw in the Naval Exhibition, but only so  far in the model stage; as the absence of any of the well known  distinguishing blazons of the foremost lines was sufficient to show  that no order had been placed for the construction of a real vessel.  It will take a very short time to examine the task of the naval  architect required to secure these onerous and magnificent conditions,  five days' continuous ocean steaming at a speed of 24 knots.    The most practical, theory-despising among them must for the nonce  become a theorist, and argue from the known to the unknown; and,  first, the practical man will turn--secretly perhaps, but wisely--to  the invaluable experiments and laws laid down so clearly by the late  Mr. Froude. Although primarily designed to assist the Admiralty in  arguing from the resistance of a model to that of the full size  vessel, the practical man need not thereby despise Froude's laws, as  he is able to choose his mode: to any scale he likes, and he can take  his experiments ready made by practice on a large scale, as Newton  took the phenomena of astronomy for the illustration of the mechanical  laws. Suppose then he takes the City of Paris as his model, 560 ft. by  63 ft., in round numbers 10,000 tons displacement, and 20,000 horse  power, for a speed of 20 knots, with a coal capacity of 2,000 tons,  sufficient, with contingencies, for a voyage of six to eight days. Or  we may take a later 20 knot vessel, the Furst Bismarck, 500 ft. by  50ft., 8,000 tons, and 16,000 horse power, speed 20 knots, and coal  capacity 2,700 tons, to allow for the entire length of voyage to  Germany.    In Froude's method of comparison the laws of mechanical similitude are  preserved if we make the displacements of the model and of its copy in  the ratio of the sixth power of the speeds designed, or the length as  the square of the speed. Our new 24 knot vessel, taking the City of  Paris as a model, would therefore have 10,000 (24 / 20)^{6} = 29,860,  say 30,000 tons displacement, and would be 800 ft. x 90 ft. in  dimensions. The horse power would have to be as the _seventh_ power of  the speed, and our vessel would therefore have 20,000 (24 / 20)^{7},  or say 72,000 horse power. Further applications of Froude's laws of  similitude will show that the steam pressure and piston speed would  have to be raised 20 per cent., while the revolutions were discounted  20 per cent., supposing the engines and propellers to be increased in  size to scale. To provide the requisite enormous boiler power, all  geometrical scale would disappear; but it would carry us too far at  present to follow up this interesting comparison.    Our naval architect is not likely at present to proceed further with  this monstrous design, exceeding even the Great Eastern in size, if  only because no dock is in existence capable of receiving such a ship.  He has however learned something of value, namely, that this vessel,  if the proper similitude is carried out, is capable of keeping up a  speed of 24 knots for five days with ample coal supply, provided the  boilers are not found to occupy all the available space. For it is an  immediate consequence of Froude's laws that in similar vessels run at  corresponding speeds over the same voyage, the coal capacity is  proportionately the same, or that a ton of coal will carry the same  number of tons of displacement over the same distance. Thus our  enlarged City of Paris would require to carry about 4,000 tons of  coal, burning 800 tons a day.    With the Britannic and Germanic as models of 5,000 tons and 5,000  horse power at 16 knot speed, the 24 knot vessel would require to be  of 57,000 tons and 85,000 horse power, to carry sufficient coal for  the voyage of 3,000 miles. These enormous vessels being out of the  question, the designer must reduce the size. But now the City of Paris  will no longer serve as a model, he must look elsewhere for a vessel  of high speed, and smaller scale, and naturally he picks out a torpedo  boat at the other end of the scale. A speed of 24 knots--and it is  claimed even of 25, 26, and 27 knots--has been attained on the mile by  a torpedo boat. But such a performance is useless for our mode of  comparison, as sufficient fuel at this high speed for ten or twelve  hours only at most can be carried--a voyage of, say, 500 miles; while  our steamer is required to carry coal for 3,000 miles. The Russian  torpedo boat Wiborg, for instance, is designed to carry coal for 1,200  miles at 10 knot speed; but at 20 knots this fuel would last only  twenty-seven hours, carrying the vessel 540 miles. It will now be  found that with this limited coal capacity the speed of the ordinary  torpedo boat must be reduced considerably below 10 knots for it to be  able to cross the Atlantic, 3,000 miles under steam. So that, even at  a possible speed of 10 knots for the voyage, the full sized 24 knot  five-day vessel, of which the best torpedo boat is the model, must  have (2.4)^{6}, say 200 times the tonnage, and (2.4)^{7}, or 460 times  the horse power. The enlarged Wiborg would thus not differ much from  the enlarged City of Paris. A better model to select would be one of  the recent dispatch boats, commerce destroyers, or torpedo catchers,  recently designed by Mr. W.H. White, for our navy--the Intrepid or  Endymion, for instance. The Intrepid is 300 ft. by 44 ft., 3,600 tons,  and 9,000 horse power for 20 knot speed, with 800 hours' coal capacity  for 8,000 miles at 10 knot speed; which will reduce to 3,000 miles at  16 knots, and 2,000 miles at 20 knots.    The Endymion is 360 ft. by 60 ft., with coal capacity for 2,800 miles  at 18 knot speed, or for about 144 hours or six days. The enlarged  Endymion for the same voyage of 2,800 miles in five days, or at 211/2  knot speed, would be 44 per cent larger and broader, that is 520 ft.  by 86 ft., and of threefold tonnage, and three and a half times, or  about 30,000 horse power--about the dimensions of the Furst Bismarck,  but much more powerfully engined. This agrees fairly with the estimate  in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN of 19th Sept, 1891., where it is stated  that twenty-two boilers, at a working pressure of 180 lb. on the  square inch, would be required, allowing 11/2 lb. of coal per horse  power hour.    The Intrepid, enlarged to a 24 knot boat, for the same length of  voyage of 3,000 miles, would be 650 ft. by 100 ft., 40,000 tons, and  about 45,000 horse power. So now we are nearing the Messrs. Thomson  design in the Naval Exhibition of the five-day steamer, 231/2 knot  speed, 630 ft. by 73 ft., and 30,000 to 40,000 horse power.    No one doubts the ability of our shipbuilding yards to turn out these  monsters; and on the measured mile, and for a good long distance, we  shall certainly see the contract speeds attained and some excelled.  But the whole difficulty turns on the question of the coal capacity,  and whether it is sufficient to last for even five days or for 3,000  miles. Every effort then must be made to shorten the length of the  voyage from port to port; and we may yet see Galway and Halifax, only  2,200 miles apart, once more mentioned as the starting points of the  voyage as of old, in the earliest days of steam navigation. In those  days the question of fuel supply was a difficulty, even at the then  slow speeds, in consequence of the wasteful character of the engines,  burning from 7 lb. of coal and upward per horse power hour. Dr.  Lardner's calculations, based upon the average performance of those  days, justified him in saying that steam navigation could not pay--as  was really the case until the introduction of the compound engine.    It is recorded in Admiral Preble's \"Origin and Development of Steam  Navigation,\" Philadelphia, 1883, page 160, that the Sirius, 700 tons  and 320 horse power, on her return voyage had to burn up all that old  be spared on board, and took seventeen days to reach Falmouth. An  interesting old book to consult now is Atherton's \"Tables of Steamship  Capacity,\" 1854, based as they are upon the performance of the marine  engine of the day. Atherton calculates that a 10,000 ton vessel could  at 20 knots carry only 204 tons of cargo 1,676 miles, while a 5,000  ton vessel at 18 knots on a voyage of 3,000 miles could carry no cargo  at all. Also that the cost per ton of cargo at 16 knots would be  twenty times the cost at eight knots, implying a coal consumption  reaching to 12 lb. per horse power hour. It is quite possible that  some invention is still latent which will enable us to go considerably  below the present average consumption of 2 lb. to 11/2 lb. per horse  power hour; but at present our rate of progress appears asymptotic to  a definite limit.    To conclude, the whole difficulty is one of fuel supply, and it is  useless to employ a fast torpedo boat as our model, except at the  speed at which the torpedo boat can carry her own fuel to cross the  Atlantic. If the voyage must be reduced in time, let it be reduced  from six days to four, by running between Galway and Halifax, a  problem not too extravagant in its demands for modern engineering  capabilities. A statement has recently gained a certain amount of  circulation to the effect that the Inman Company was about to use  petroleum as fuel, in order to obtain more steam. We have the best  possible authority for saying there is not the least syllable of truth  in this rumor. It has"]]]
