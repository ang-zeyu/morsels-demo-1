[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10201"],[0,"The Desert of Wheat (#15)"],[1," She  seemed calm, and glad to have that first part of the journey almost  ended. Her motive in coming was not now the impelling thing that had  actuated her.    When next the car slowed down she heard her father say, \"Drive in by the  house.\"    Then Lenore, opening her eyes, saw the gate, the trim little orchard  with its scant shade, the gray old weatherbeaten house which she  remembered so well. The big porch looked inviting, as it was shady and  held an old rocking-chair and a bench with blue cushions. A door stood  wide open. No one appeared to be on the premises.    \"Nash, blow your horn an' then hunt around for somebody,\" said Anderson.  \"Come, get out, Lenore. You must be half dead.\"    \"Oh no. Only half dust and half fire,\" replied Lenore, laughing, as she  stepped out. What a relief to get rid of coat, veils, bonnet, and to sit  on a shady porch where a faint breeze blew! Just at that instant she  heard a low, distant rumbling. Thunder! It thrilled her. Jake brought  her a cold, refreshing drink, and she sent him back after another. She  wet her handkerchief and bathed her hot face. It was indeed very  comfortable there after that long hot ride.    \"Miss Lenore, I seen thet Nash pawin' you,\" said the cowboy, \"an' by  Gosh! I couldn't believe my eyes!\"    \"Not so loud! Jake, the young gentleman imagines I'm in love with him,\"  replied Lenore.    \"Wall, I'll remove his imagining',\" declared Jake, coolly.    \"Jake, you will do nothing.\"    \"Ahuh! Then you air in love with _him?_\"    Lenore was compelled to explain to this loyal cowboy just what the  situation meant. Whereupon Jake swore his amaze, and said, \"I'm a-goin'  to lick him, anyhow, fer thet!\" And he caught up the tin cup and  shuffled away.    Footsteps and voices sounded on the path, upon which presently appeared  Anderson and young Dorn.    \"Father's gone to Wheatly,\" he was saying. \"But I'm glad to tell you  we'll pay twenty thousand dollars on the debt as soon as we harvest. If  it rains we'll pay it all and have thirty thousand left.\"    \"Good! I sure hope it rains. An' that thunder sounds hopeful,\" responded  Anderson.    \"It's been hopeful like that for several days, but no rain,\" said Dorn.  And then, espying Lenore, he seemed startled out of his eagerness. He  flushed slightly. \"I--I didn't see--you had brought your daughter.\"    He greeted her somewhat bashfully. And Lenore returned the greeting  calmly, watching him steadily and waiting for the nameless sensations  she had imagined would attend this meeting. But whatever these might be,  they did not come to overwhelm her. The gladness of his voice, as he had  spoken so eagerly to her father about the debt, had made her feel very  kindly toward him. It might have been natural for a young man to resent  this dragging debt. But he was fine. She observed, as he sat down, that,  once the smile and flush left his face, he seemed somewhat thinner and  older than she had pictured him. A shadow lay in his eyes and his lips  were sad. He had evidently been working, upon their arrival. He wore  overalls, dusty and ragged; his arms, bare to the elbow, were brown and  muscular; his thin cotton shirt was wet with sweat and it clung to his  powerful shoulders.    Anderson surveyed the young man with friendly glance.    \"What's your first name?\" he queried, with his blunt frankness.    \"Kurt,\" was the reply.    \"Is that American?\"    \"No. Neither is Dorn. But Kurt Dorn is an American.\"    \"Hum! So I see, an' I'm powerful glad.... An' you've saved the big  section of promisin' wheat?\"    \"Yes. We've been lucky. It's the best and finest wheat father ever  raised. If it rains the yield will go sixty bushels to the acre.\"    \"Sixty? Whew!\" ejaculated Anderson.    Lenore smiled at these wheat men, and said: \"It surely will rain--and  likely storm to-day. I am a prophet who never fails.\"    \"By George! that's true! Lenore has anybody beat when it comes to  figurin' the weather,\" declared Anderson.    Dorn looked at her without speaking, but his smile seemed to say that  she could not help being a prophet of good, of hope, of joy.    \"Say, Lenore, how many bushels in a section at sixty per acre?\" went on  Anderson.    \"Thirty-eight thousand four hundred,\" replied Lenore.    \"An' what'll you sell for?\" asked Anderson of Dorn.    \"Father has sold at two dollars and twenty-five cents a bushel,\" replied  Dorn.    \"Good! But he ought to have waited. The government will set a higher  price.... How much will that come to, Lenore?\"    Dorn's smile, as he watched Lenore do her mental arithmetic, attested to  the fact that he already had figured out the sum.    \"Eighty-six thousand four hundred dollars,\" replied Lenore. \"Is that  right?\"    \"An' you'll have thirty thousand dollars left after all debts are paid?\"  inquired Anderson.    \"Yes, sir. I can hardly realize it. That's a fortune--for one section of  wheat. But we've had four bad seasons.... Oh, if it only rains to-day!\"    Lenore turned her cheek to the faint west wind. And then she looked long  at the slowly spreading clouds, white and beautiful, high up near the  sky-line, and dark and forbidding down along the horizon.    \"I knew a girl who could feel things move when no one else could,\" said  Lenore. \"I'm sensitive like that--at least about wind and rain. Right  now I can feel rain in the air.\"    \"Then you have brought me luck,\" said Dorn, earnestly. \"Indeed I guess  my luck has turned. I hated the idea of going away with that debt  unpaid.\"    \"Are you--going away?\" asked Lenore, in surprise.    \"Yes, rather,\" he replied, with a short, sardonic laugh. He fumbled in a  pocket of his overalls and drew forth a paper which he opened. A flame  burned the fairness from his face; his eyes darkened and shone with  peculiar intensity of pride. \"I was the first man drafted in this Bend  country.... My number was the first called!\"    \"Drafted!\" echoed Lenore, and she seemed to be standing on the threshold  of an amazing and terrible truth.    \"Lass, we forget,\" said her father, rather thickly.    \"Oh, but--why?\" cried Lenore. She had voiced the same poignant appeal to  her brother Jim. Why need he--why must he go to war? What for? And Jim  had called out a bitter curse on the Germans he meant to kill.    \"Why?\" returned Dorn, with the sad, thoughtful shadow returning to his  eyes. \"How many times have I asked myself that?... In one way, I don't  know.... I haven't told father yet!... It's not for his sake.... But  when I think deeply--when I can feel and see--I mean I'm going for my  country.... For you and your sisters.\"    Like a soldier then Lenore received her mortal blow facing him who dealt  it, and it was a sudden overwhelming realization of love. No confusion,  no embarrassment, no shame attended the agony of that revelation.  Outwardly she did not seem to change at all. She felt her father's eyes  upon her; but she had no wish to hide the tumult of her heart. The  moment made her a woman. Where was the fulfilment of those vague,  stingingly sweet dreamy fancies of love? Where was her maiden reserve,  that she so boldly recognized an unsolicited passion? Her eyes met  Dorn's steadily, and she felt some vital and compelling spirit pass from  her to him. She saw him struggle with what he could not understand. It  was his glance that wavered and fell, his hand that trembled, his breast  that heaved. She loved him. There had been no beginning. Always he had  lived in her dreams. And like her brother he was going to kill and to be  killed.    Then Lenore gazed away across the wheat-fields. The shadows came waving  toward her. A stronger breeze fanned her cheeks. The heavens were  darkening and low thunder rolled along the battlements of the great  clouds.    \"Say, Kurt, what do you make of this?\" asked Anderson. Lenore, turning,  saw her father hold out the little gray cake that Jake had found in the  wheat-field.    Young Dorn seized it quickly, felt and smelled and bit it.    \"Where'd you get this?\" he asked, with excitement.    Anderson related the circumstance of its discovery.    \"It's a preparation, mostly phosphorus,\" replied Dorn. \"When the  moisture evaporates it will ignite--set fire to any dry substance....  That is a trick of the I.W.W. to burn the wheat-fields.\"    \"By all that's ----!\" swore Anderson, with his jaw bulging. \"Jake an' I  knew it meant bad. But we didn't know what.\"    \"I've been expecting tricks of all kinds,\" said Dorn. \"I have four men  watching the section.\"    \"Good! Say, that car turned off to the right back here some miles....  But, worse luck, the I.W.W.'s can work at night.\"    \"We'll watch at night, too,\" replied Dorn.    Lenore was conscious of anger encroaching upon the melancholy splendor  of her emotions, and the change was bitter.    \"When the rain comes, won't it counteract the ignition of that  phosphorus?\" she asked, eagerly, for she knew that rain would come.    \"Only for the time being. It 'll be just as dry this time to-morrow as  it is now.\"    \"Then the wheat's goin' to burn,\" declared Anderson, grimly. \"If that  trick has been worked all over this country you're goin' to have worse  'n a prairie fire. The job on hand is to save this one section that has  a fortune tied up in it.\"    \"Mr. Anderson, that job looks almost hopeless, in the light of this  phosphorus trick. What on earth can be done? I've four men. I can't hire  any more, because I can't trust these strangers. And how can four  men--or five, counting me, watch a square mile of wheat day and night?\"    The situation looked hopeless to Lenore and she was sick. What cruel  fates toyed with this young farmer! He seemed to be sinking under this  last crowning blow. There in the sky, rolling up and rumbling, was the  long-deferred rain-storm that meant freedom from debt, and a fortune  besides. But of what avail the rain if it was to rush the wheat to full  bursting measure only for the infernal touch of the foreigner?

Some of my readers may have   been to Ascot races, or to Aldershot camp, and may recollect the   table-land of the sandy moors, perfectly flat atop, dreary enough to   those to whom they are not (as they have long been to me) a home and   a work-field.  Those sands are several hundred feet thick.  They lie   on the London clay.  And they represent--the reader must take   geologists' word for it--a series of beds in some places thousands of   feet thick, in the Isle of Wight, in the Paris basin, in the volcanic   country of the Auvergne, in Switzerland, in Italy; a period during   which the land must at first have swarmed with forms of tropic life,   and then grown--but very gradually--more temperate, and then colder   and colder still; till at last set in that age of ice, which spread   the boulder pebbles over all rocks and soils indiscriminately, from   the Lake mountains to within a few miles of London.    For everywhere about those Ascot moors, the top of the sands has been   ploughed by shore-ice in winter, as they lay a-wash in the shallow   sea; and over them, in many places, is spread a thin sheet of ice   gravel, more ancient, the best geologists think, than the boulder and   the boulder-clay.    If any of my readers ask how long the period was during which those   sands of Ascot Heath and Aldershot have been laid down, I cannot   tell.  But this we can tell.  It was long enough to see such changes   in land and sea, that maps representing Europe during the greater   part of that period (as far as we can guess at it) look no more like   Europe than like America or the South Sea Islands.  And this we can   tell besides:  that that period was long enough for the Swiss Alps to   be lifted up at least 10,000 feet of their present height.  And that   was a work which--though God could, if He willed it, have done it in   a single day--we have proof positive was not done in less than ages,   beside which the mortal life of man is as the life of the gnat which   dances in the sun.    And all this, and more--as may be proved from the geology of foreign   countries--happened between the date of the boulder-clay, and that of   the New Red sandstone on which it rests.        IV.  THE COAL IN THE FIRE        My dear town-dwelling readers, let me tell you now something of a   geological product well known, happily, to all dwellers in towns, and   of late years, thanks to railroad extension, to most dwellers in   country districts:  I mean coal.    Coal, as of course you know, is commonly said to be composed of   vegetable matter, of the leaves and stems of ancient plants and   trees--a startling statement, and one which I do not wish you to take   entirely on trust.  I shall therefore spend a few pages in showing   you how this fact--for fact it is--was discovered.  It is a very good   example of reasoning from the known to the unknown.  You will have a   right to say at first starting, \"Coal is utterly different in look   from leaves and stems.  The only property which they seem to have in   common is that they can both burn.\"  True.  But difference of mere   look may be only owing to a transformation, or series of   transformations.  There are plenty in nature quite as great, and   greater.  What can be more different in look, for instance, than a   green field of wheat and a basket of loaves at the baker's?  And yet   there is, I trust, no doubt whatsoever that the bread has been once   green wheat, and that the green wheat has been transformed into   bread--making due allowance, of course, for the bone-dust, or gypsum,   or alum with which the worthy baker may have found it profitable to   adulterate his bread, in order to improve the digestion of Her   Majesty's subjects.    But you may say, \"Yes, but we can see the wheat growing, flowering,   ripening, reaped, ground, kneaded, baked.  We see, in the case of   bread, the processes of the transformation going on:  but in the case   of coal we do not see the wood and leaves being actually transformed   into coal, or anything like it.\"    Now suppose we laid out the wheat on a table in a regular series,   such as you may see in many exhibitions of manufactures; beginning   with the wheat plant at one end, and ending with the loaf at the   other; and called in to look at them a savage who knew nothing of   agriculture and nothing of cookery--called in, as an extreme case,   the man in the moon, who certainly can know nothing of either; for as   there is neither air nor water round the moon, there can be nothing   to grow there, and therefore nothing to cook--and suppose we asked   him to study the series from end to end.  Do you not think that the   man in the moon, if he were half as shrewd as Crofton Croker makes   him in his conversation with Daniel O'Rourke, would answer after due   meditation, \"How the wheat plant got changed into the loaf I cannot   see from my experience in the moon:  but that it has been changed,   and that the two are the same thing I do see, for I see all the   different stages of the change.\"  And so I think you may say of the   wood and the coal.    The man in the moon would be quite reasonable in his conclusion; for   it is a law, a rule, and one which you will have to apply again and   again in the study of natural objects, that however different two   objects may look in some respects, yet if you can find a regular   series of gradations between them, with all shades of likeness, first   to one of them and then to the other, then you have a fair right to   suppose them to be only varieties of the same species, the same kind   of thing, and that, therefore, they have a common origin.    That sounds rather magniloquent.  Let me give you a simple example.    Suppose you had come into Britain with Brute, the grandson of AEneas,   at that remote epoch when (as all archaeologists know who have duly   read Geoffrey of Monmouth and the Arthuric legends) Britain was   inhabited only by a few giants.  Now if you had met giants with one   head, and also giants with seven heads, and no others, you would have   had a right to say, \"There are two breeds of giants here, one-headed   and seven-headed.\"  But if you had found, as Jack the Giant-Killer   (who belongs to the same old cycle of myths) appears to have found,   two-headed giants also, and three-headed, and giants, indeed, with   any reasonable number of heads, would you not have been justified in   saying, \"They are all of the same breed, after all; only some are   more capitate, or heady, than others!\"    I hope that you agree to that reasoning; for by it I think we arrive   most surely at a belief in the unity of the human race, and that the   Negro is actually a man and a brother.    If the only two types of men in the world were an extreme white type,   like the Norwegians, and an extreme black type, like the Negros, then   there would be fair ground for saying, \"These two types have been   always distinct; they are different races, who have no common   origin.\"  But if you found, as you will find, many types of man   showing endless gradations between the white man and the Negro, and   not only that, but endless gradations between them both and a third   type, whose extreme perhaps is the Chinese--endless gradations, I   say, showing every conceivable shade of resemblance or difference,   till you often cannot say to what type a given individual belongs;   and all of them, however different from each other, more like each   other than they are like any other creature upon earth; then you are   justified in saying, \"All these are mere varieties of one kind.    However distinct they are now, they were probably like each other at   first, and therefore all probably had a common origin.\"  That seems   to me sound reasoning, and advanced natural science is corroborating   it more and more daily.    Now apply the same reasoning to coal.  You may find about the world--  you may see even in England alone--every gradation between coal and   growing forest.  You may see the forest growing in its bed of   vegetable mould; you may see the forest dead and converted into peat,   with stems and roots in it; that, again, into sunken forests, like   those to be seen below high-water mark on many coasts of this island.    You find gradations between them and beds of lignite, or wood coal;   then gradations between lignite and common or bituminous coal; and   then gradations between common coal and culm, or anthracite, such as   is found in South Wales.  Have you not a right to say, \"These are all   but varieties of the same kind of thing--namely, vegetable matter?    They have a common origin--namely, woody fibre.  And coal, or rather   culm, is the last link in a series of transformations from growing   vegetation?\"    This is our first theory.  Let us try to verify it, as scientific men   are in the habit of doing, by saying, If that be true, then something   else is likely to be true too.    If coal has all been vegetable soil, then it is likely that some of   it has not been quite converted into shapeless coal.  It is likely   that there will be vegetable fibre still to be seen here and there;   perhaps leaves, perhaps even stems of trees, as in a peat bog.  Let   us look for them.    You will not need to look far.  The coal, and the sands and shales   which accompany the coal, are so full of plant-remains, that three   hundred species were known to Adolphe Brongniart as early as 1849,   and that number has largely increased since.    Now one point is specially noticeable about these plants of the coal;   namely, that they may at least have grown in swamps.    First, you will be interested if you study the coal flora, with the   abundance, beauty, and variety of the ferns.  Now ferns in these   islands grow principally in rocky woods, because there, beside the   moisture, they get from decaying vegetable or decaying rock,   especially limestone, the carbonic acid which is "]]]
