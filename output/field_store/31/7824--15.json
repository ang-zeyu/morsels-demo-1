I never had to give an order; my boys knew just what  to do. Why, there's men in this outfit right now that couldn't have  greased my wagon that year.    \"Well, the men on the points brought the herd to the water with a good  head on, and before the leaders knew it, they were halfway across  the channel, swimming like fish. The swing-men fed them in, free and  plenty. Most of my outfit took to the water, and kept the cattle  from drifting downstream. The boys from the other herds--good men,  too--kept shooting them into the water, and inside fifteen minutes'  time we were in the big Injun Territory. After crossing the saddle  stock and the wagon, I swam my horse back to the Texas side. I wanted  to eat dinner with Blocker's man, just to see how they fed. Might want  to work for him some time, you see. I pretended that I'd help him over  if he wanted to cross, but he said his dogies could never breast that  water. I remarked to him at dinner, 'You're feeding a mite better this  year, ain't you?' 'Not that I can notice,' he replied, as the cook  handed him a tin plate heaping with navy beans, 'and I'm eating rather  regular with the wagon, too.' I killed time around for a while, and  then we rode down to the river together. The cattle had tramped out  his peg, so after setting a new one, and pow-wowing around, I told him  good-by and said to him, 'Bob, old man, when I hit Dodge, I'll take a  drink and think of you back here on the trail, and regret that you are  not with me, so as to make it two-handed.' We said our 'so-longs' to  each other, and I gave the gray his head and he took the water like a  duck. He could outswim any horse I ever saw, but I drowned him in  the Washita two weeks later. Yes, tangled his feet in some vines in  a sunken treetop, and the poor fellow's light went out. My own candle  came near being snuffed. I never felt so bad over a little thing since  I burned my new red topboots when I was a kid, as in drownding that  horse.    \"There was nothing else worth mentioning until we struck the Cimarron  back here, where we overtook a herd of Chisholm's that had come in  from the east. They had crossed through the Arbuckle Mountains--came  in over the old Whiskey Trail. Here was another herd waterbound, and  the boss-man was as important as a hen with one chicken. He told me  that the river wouldn't be fordable for a week; wanted me to fall back  at least five miles; wanted all this river bottom for his cattle; said  he didn't need any help to cross his herd, though he thanked me for  the offer with an air of contempt. I informed him that our cattle  were sold for delivery on the North Platte, and that we wanted to go  through on time. I assured him if he would drop his cattle a mile down  the river, it would give us plenty of room. I told him plainly that  our cattle, horses, and men could all swim, and that we never let a  little thing like swimming water stop us.    \"No! No! he couldn't do that; we might as well fall back and take our  turn. 'Oh, well,' said I, 'if you want to act contrary about it, I'll  go up to the King-Fisher crossing, only three miles above here. I've  almost got time to cross yet this evening.'    \"Then he wilted and inquired, 'Do you think I can cross if it swims  them any?'    \"'I'm not doing your thinking, sir,' I answered, 'but I'll bring  up eight or nine good men and help you rather than make a six-mile  elbow.' I said this with some spirit and gave him a mean look.    \"'All right,' said he, 'bring up your boys, say eight o'clock, and we  will try the ford. Let me add right here,' he continued, 'and I'm a  stranger to you, young man, but my outfit don't take anybody's slack,  and as I am older than you, let me give you this little bit of advice:  when you bring your men here in the morning, don't let them whirl  too big a loop, or drag their ropes looking for trouble, for I've got  fellows with me that don't turn out of the trail for anybody.'    \"'All right, sir,' I said. 'Really, I'm glad to hear that you have  some good men, still I'm pained to find them on the wrong side of the  river for travelers. But I'll be here in the morning,' I called back  as I rode away. So telling my boys that we were likely to have  some fun in the morning, and what to expect, I gave it no further  attention. When we were catching up our horses next morning for the  day, I ordered two of my lads on herd, which was a surprise to them,  as they were both handy with a gun. I explained it to them all,--that  we wished to avoid trouble, but if it came up unavoidable, to overlook  no bets--to copper every play as it fell.    \"We got to the river too early to suit Chisholm's boss-man. He  seemed to think that his cattle would take the water better about ten  o'clock. To kill time my boys rode across and back several times to  see what the water was like. 'Well, any one that would let as little  swimming water as that stop them must be a heap sight sorry outfit,'  remarked one-eyed Jim Reed, as he rode out of the river, dismounting  to set his saddle forward and tighten his cinches, not noticing that  this foreman heard him. I rode around and gave him a look, and he  looked up at me and muttered, 'Scuse me, boss, I plumb forgot!' Then I  rode back and apologized to this boss-man: 'Don't pay any attention  to my boys; they are just showing off, and are a trifle windy this  morning.'    \"'That's all right,' he retorted, 'but don't forget what I told you  yesterday, and let it be enough said.'    \"'Well, let's put the cattle in,' I urged, seeing that he was getting  hot under the collar. 'We're burning daylight, pardner.'    \"'Well, I'm going to cross my wagon first,' said he.    \"'That's a good idea,' I answered. 'Bring her up.' Their cook seemed  to have a little sense, for he brought up his wagon in good shape. We  tied some guy ropes to the upper side, and taking long ropes from the  end of the tongue to the pommels of our saddles, the ease with which  we set that commissary over didn't trouble any one but the boss-man,  whose orders were not very distinct from the distance between banks.  It was a good hour then before he would bring up his cattle. The main  trouble seemed to be to devise means to keep their guns and cartridges  dry, as though that was more important than getting the whole herd  of nearly thirty-five hundred cattle over. We gave them a clean cloth  until they needed us, but as they came up we divided out and were  ready to give the lead a good push. If a cow changed his mind about  taking a swim that morning, he changed it right back and took it.  For in less than twenty minutes' time they were all over, much to the  surprise of the boss and his men; besides, their weapons were quite  dry; just the splash had wet them.    \"I told the boss that we would not need any help to cross ours, but  to keep well out of our way, as we would try and cross by noon, which  ought to give him a good five-mile start. Well, we crossed and nooned,  lying around on purpose to give them a good lead, and when we hit the  trail back in these sand-hills, there he was, not a mile ahead, and  you can see there was no chance to get around. I intended to take  the Dodge trail, from this creek where we are now, but there we were,  blocked in! I was getting a trifle wolfish over the way they were  acting, so I rode forward to see what the trouble was.    \"'Oh, I'm in no hurry. You're driving too fast. This is your first  trip, isn't it?' he inquired, as he felt of a pair of checked pants  drying on the wagon wheel.    \"'Don't you let any idea like that disturb your Christian spirit, old  man,' I replied with some resentment. 'But if you think I am driving  too fast, you might suggest some creek where I could delude myself  with the idea, for a week or so, that it was not fordable.'    \"Assuming an air of superiority he observed, 'You seem to have forgot  what I said to you yesterday.'    \"'No, I haven't,' I answered, 'but are you going to stay all night  here?'    \"'I certainly am, if that's any satisfaction to you,' he answered.    \"I got off my horse and asked him for a match, though I had plenty  in my pocket, to light a cigarette which I had rolled during the  conversation. I had no gun on, having left mine in our wagon, but  fancied I'd stir him up and see how bad he really was. I thought it  best to stroke him with and against the fur, try and keep on neutral  ground, so I said,--    \"'You ain't figuring none that in case of a run to-night we're a  trifle close together for cow-herds. Besides, my men on a guard last  night heard gray wolves in these sand-hills. They are liable to show  up to-night. Didn't I notice some young calves among your cattle  this morning? Young calves, you know, make larruping fine eating for  grays.'    \"'Now, look here, Shorty,' he said in a patronizing tone, as though he  might let a little of his superior cow-sense shine in on my darkened  intellect, 'I haven't asked you to crowd up here on me. You are  perfectly at liberty to drop back to your heart's content. If wolves  bother us to-night, you stay in your blankets snug and warm, and  pleasant dreams of old sweethearts on the Trinity to you. We won't  need you. We'll try and worry along without you.'    \"Two or three of his men laughed gruffly at these remarks, and threw  leer-eyed looks at me. I asked one who seemed bad, what calibre his  gun was. 'Forty-five ha'r trigger,' he answered. I nosed around over  their plunder purpose. They had things drying around like Bannock  squaws jerking venison.    \"When I got on my horse, I said to the boss, 'I want to pass your  outfit in the morning, as you are in no hurry and I am.'    \"'That will depend,' said he.    \"'Depend on what?' I asked.    \"'Depend on whether we are willing to let you,' he snarled.    \"I gave him as mean a look as I could command and said tauntingly,  'Now, look here, old girl: there's no occasion for you to tear your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12288"],[0,"The Witchcraft Delusion in Colonial Connecticut (1647-1697) (#15)"],[1,"and then I turned to  come away.

ELIZABETH GODMAN    Of all the women who set the communities ablaze with their witcheries,  none in fertility of invention and performance surpassed Elizabeth  Godman of New Haven--a member of the household of Stephen Goodyear, the  Deputy Governor. Reverend John Davenport said, in a sermon of the time,  \"that a froward discontented frame of spirit was a subject fitt for ye  Devill,\" and Elizabeth was accused by Goodwife Larremore and others of  being in \"such a frame of spirit,\" and of practicing the black arts.    She promptly haled her accusers before a court of magistrates, August 4,  1653, with Governor Theophilus Eaton and Deputy Governor Stephen  Goodyear present; and when asked what she charged them with, she desired  that \"a wrighting might be read--wch was taken in way of examination  before ye magistrate,\" in May, 1653. The \"wrighting\" did not prove  helpful to Elizabeth's case. The statements of witnesses and of the  accused are in some respects unique, and of a decided personal quality.      _\"Hobbamocke\"--The \"swonding fitt\"--Lying--Evil communications--The  Indian's statement--\"Ye boyes sickness\"--\"Verey strang fitts\"--\"Figgs\"--  \"Pease porridge\"--\"A sweate\"--Mrs. Goodyeare's opinion--Absorption--  Contradictions--Goodwife Thorp's chickens--\"Water and wormes\"_    \"Mris.

After  sundrie of the passages in ye wrighting were read, she was asked if  these things did not giue just ground of suspition to all that heard  them that she was a witch.
