By the way, what became of that German who made  such a disturbance the day we cast the core?\"    \"Oh, you mean Baudermann?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Why, it's rather queer about him. The foreman of the shop where he was  detailed, saw that he was an experienced man, in spite of his seemingly  stupid ways, and he was going to promote him, only he never came back.\"    \"Never came back? What do you mean?\"    \"I mean the day after the cast of the gun was made he disappeared, and  never came back.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Tom. He said nothing more, but he believed that he  understood the man's actions. Failing to obtain the desired  information, or perhaps failing to spoil the cast, he realized that his  chances were at an end for the present.    With great care the gun was hoisted from the mould. More eyes than  Tom's anxiously regarded it as it came up out of the casting pit.    \"Bless my buttonhook!\" cried Mr. Damon, who had gone with the lads.  \"It's a monster; isn't it?\"    \"Oh, wait until you see it with the jackets on!\" exclaimed Ned, who had  viewed the completed drawings. \"Then you'll open your eyes.\"    The great piece of hollow steel tubing was lifted to the boring lathe.  Then Tom and the manager examined it for superficial flaws.    \"Not one!\" cried the manager in delight.    \"Not that I can see,\" added Tom.. \"It's a success--so far.\"    \"And that was the hardest part of the work,\" went on the manager of the  steel plant. \"I can almost guarantee you success from now on.\"    And, as far as the rifling was concerned, this was true. I will not  weary you with the details of how the great core of Tom Swift's giant  cannon was bored. Sufficient to say that, after some annoying delays,  caused by breaks in the machinery, which had never before been used on  such a gigantic piece of work, the rifling was done. After the jackets  had been shrunk on, it would be rifled again, to make it true in case  of any shrinkage.    Then came the almost Herculean task of shrinking on the great red-hot  steel jackets and wire-windings, that would add strength to the great  cannon. To do this the central core was set up on end, and the jackets,  having been heated in an immense furnace, were hoisted by a great crane  over the core, and lowered on it as one would lower his napkin ring  over the rolled up napkin.    It took weeks of hard work to do this, and Tom and Ned, with Mr. Damon  occasionally for company, remained almost constantly at the plant. But  finally the cannon was completed, the rifling was done over again to  correct any imperfections, and the manager said:    \"Your cannon is completed, Mr. Swift. I want to congratulate you on it.  Never have we done such a stupendous piece of work. Only for your plans  we could not have finished it. It was too big a problem for us. Your  cannon is completed, but, of course, it will have to be mounted. What  about the carriage?\"    \"I have plans for that,\" replied Tom; \"but for the present I am going  to put it on a temporary one. I want to test the gun now.  It looks all  right, but whether it will shoot accurately, and for a greater distance  than any cannon has ever sent a projectile before, is yet to be seen.\"    \"Where will you test it?\"    \"That is what we must decide. I don't want to take it too far from  here. Perhaps you can select a place where it would be safe to fire it,  say with a range of about thirty miles.\"    \"Thirty miles! why, my dear sir--\"    \"Oh, I'm not altogether sure that it will go that distance,\"  interrupted Tom, with a smile; \"but I'm going to try for it, and I want  to be on the safe side. Is there such a place near here?\"    \"Yes, I guess we can pick one out. I'll let you know.\"    \"Then I must get back and arrange for my powder supply,\" went on the  young inventor. \"We'll soon test my giant cannon!\"    \"Bless my ear-drums!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"I hope nothing bursts.  For if  that goes up, Tom Swift--\"    \"I'm not making it to burst,\" put in Tom, with a smile. \"Don't worry.  Now, Ned, back to Shopton to get ready for the test.\"          CHAPTER XVI    A WARNING      \"Whew, how it rains!\" exclaimed Ned, as he looked out of the window.    \"And it doesn't seem to show any signs of letting up,\" remarked Tom.  \"It's been at it nearly a week now, and it is likely to last a week  longer.\"    \"It's beastly,\" declared his chum. \"How can you test your gun in this  weather?\"    \"I can't. I've got to wait for it to clear.\"    \"Bless my rubber boots! it's just got to stop some time,\" declared Mr.  Damon. \"Don't worry, Tom.\"    \"But I don't like this delay. I have heard that General Waller has  perfected a new gun--and it's a fine one, from all accounts.  He has  the proving grounds at Sandy Hook to test his on, and I'm handicapped  here. He may beat me out.\"    \"Oh, I hope not, Tom!\" exclaimed Ned. \"I'm going to see what the  weather reports say,\" and he went to hunt up a paper.    It was several weeks after the completion of Tom's giant cannon. In the  meanwhile the gun had been moved by the steel company to a  little-inhabited part of New York State, some miles from the plant. The  gun had been mounted on an improvised carriage, and now Tom and his  friends were waiting anxiously for a chance to try it.    The work was not complete, for the steel company employees had been  hampered by the rain. Never before, it seemed, had there been so much  water coming down from the clouds. Nearly every day was misty, with  gradations from mere drizzles to heavy downpours.  There were  occasional clear stretches, however, and during them the men worked.    A few more days of clear weather would be needed before the gun could  be fastened securely to the carriage, and then Tom could fire one of  the great projectiles that had been cast for it. Not until then would  he know whether or not his cannon was going to be a success.    Meanwhile nothing more had been heard or seen of the spy. He appeared  to have given up his attempts to steal Tom's secret, or to spoil his  plans, if such was his object.    The place of the test, as I have said, was in a deserted spot.  On one  side of a great valley the gun was being set up. Its muzzle pointed up  the valley, toward the side of a mountain, into which the gigantic  projectile could plow its way without doing any damage. Tom was going  to fire two kinds of cannon balls--a solid one, and one containing an  explosive.    The gun was so mounted that the muzzle could be elevated or depressed,  or swung from side to side. In this way the range could be varied. Tom  estimated that the greatest possible range would be thirty miles. It  could not be more than that, he decided, and he hoped it would not be  much less. This extreme range could be attained by elevating the gun to  exactly the proper pitch. Of course, any shorter range could, within  certain limits, also be reached.    The gun was pointed slantingly up the valley, and there was ample room  to attain the thirty-mile range without doing any damage.    At the head of the valley, some miles from where the giant cannon was  mounted, was an immense dam, built recently by a water company for  impounding a stream and furnishing a supply of drinking water for a  distant city. At the other end of the valley was the thriving village  of Preston. A railroad ran there, and it was to Preston station that  Tom's big gun had been sent, to be transported afterward, on specially  made trucks, drawn by powerful autos, to the place where it was now  mounted.    Tom had been obliged to buy a piece of land on which to build the  temporary carriage, and also contract for a large slice of the opposite  mountain, as a target against which to fire his projectiles.    The valley, as I have said, was desolate. It was thickly wooded in  spots, and in the centre, near the big dam, which held back the waters  of an immense artificial lake, was a great hill, evidently a relic of  some glacial epoch. This hill was a sort of division between two  valleys.    Tom, Ned, Mr. Damon, with Koku, and some of the employees of the steel  company, had hired a deserted farmhouse not far from the place where  the gun was being mounted. In this they lived, while Tom directed  operations.    \"The paper says 'clear' tomorrow,\" read Ned, on his return.  \"'Clear,  with freshening winds.'\"    \"That means rain, with no wind at all,\" declared Tom, with a sigh.  \"Well, it can't be helped. As Mr. Damon says, it will clear some time.\"    \"Bless my overshoes!\" exclaimed the odd gentleman. \"It always has  cleared; hasn't it?\"    No one could deny this.    There came a slackening in the showers, and Tom and Ned, donning  raincoats, went out to see how the work was progressing.  They found  the men from the steel concern busy at the great piece of engineering.    \"How are you coming on?\" asked Tom of the foreman.    \"We could finish it in two days if this rain would only let up,\"  replied the man.    \"Well, let's hope that it will,\" observed Tom.    \"If it doesn't, there's likely to be trouble up above,\" went on the  foreman, nodding in the direction of the great dam.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean that the water is getting too high. The dam is weakening, I  heard.\"    \"Is that so? Why, I thought they had made it to stand any sort of a  flood.\"    \"They evidently didn't count on one like this. They've got the engineer  who built it up there, and they're doing their best to strengthen it. I  also heard that they're preparing to dynamite it to open breeches here  and there in it, in case it is likely to give way suddenly.\"    \"You don't mean it! Say, if it does go out with a rush it will wipe out  the village.\"    \"Yes, but it can't hurt us,\" went on the foreman. \"We're too high up on  the side of the hill. Even if the dam did burst, if the course of the  water could be changed, to send it down that other valley, it would do  no harm, for there are no settlements over there,\" and he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#15)"],[1,"gratification. At Loango, for instance, it would be highly improper to  have intercourse in an exposed spot; it must only be performed inside the  hut, with closed doors, at night, when no one is present.[13]        It is on the sexual factor of modesty, existing in a well-marked      form even among animals, that coquetry is founded. I am glad to      find myself on this point in agreement with Professor Groos, who,      in his elaborate study of the play-instinct, has reached the same      conclusion. So far from being the mere heartless play by which a      woman shows her power over a man, Groos points out that coquetry      possesses \"high biological and psychological significance,\" being      rooted in the antagonism between the sexual instinct and inborn      modesty. He refers to the roe, who runs away from the stag--but      in a circle. (Groos, _Die Spiele der Menschen_, 1899, p. 339;      also the same author's _Die Spiele der Thiere_, pp. 288 _et      seq._) Another example of coquetry is furnished by the female      kingfisher (_Alcedo ispida_), which will spend all the morning in      teasing and flying away from the male, but is careful constantly      to look back, and never to let him out of her sight. (Many      examples are given by Buechner, in _Liebe und Liebesleben in der      Tierwelt_.) Robert Mueller (_Sexualbiologie_, p. 302) emphasizes      the importance of coquetry as a lure to the male.        \"It is quite true,\" a lady writes to me in a private letter,      \"that 'coquetry is a poor thing,' and that every milkmaid can      assume it, but a woman uses it principally in self-defence, while      she is finding out what the man himself is like.\" This is in      accordance with the remark of Marro, that modesty enables a woman      \"to put lovers to the test, in order to select him who is best      able to serve the natural ends of love.\" It is doubtless the      necessity for this probationary period, as a test of masculine      qualities, which usually leads a woman to repel instinctively a      too hasty and impatient suitor, for, as Arthur Macdonald remarks,      \"It seems to be instinctive in young women to reject the      impetuous lover, without the least consideration of his      character, ability, and fitness.\"    This essential element in courtship, this fundamental attitude of pursuer  and pursued, is clearly to be seen even in animals and savages; it is  equally pronounced in the most civilized men and women, manifesting itself  in crude and subtle ways alike. Shakespeare's Angelo, whose virtue had  always resisted the temptations of vice, discovered at last that                \"modesty may more betray our sense      Than woman's lightness.\"    \"What,\" asked the wise Montaigne, \"is the object of that virginal shame,  that sedate coldness, that severe countenance, that pretence of not  knowing things which they understand better than we who teach them, except  to increase in us the desire to conquer and curb, to trample under our  appetite, all that ceremony and those obstacles? For there is not only  matter for pleasure, but for pride also, in ruffling and debauching that  soft sweetness and infantine modesty.\"[14] The masculine attitude in the  face of feminine coyness may easily pass into a kind of sadism, but is  nevertheless in its origin an innocent and instinctive impulse. Restif de  la Bretonne, describing his own shame and timidity as a pretty boy whom  the girls would run after and kiss, adds: \"It is surprising that at the  same time I would imagine the pleasure I should have in embracing a girl  who resisted, in inspiring her with timidity, in making her flee and in  pursuing her; that was a part which I burned to play.\"[15] It is the  instinct of the sophisticated and the unsophisticated alike. The Arabs  have developed an erotic ideal of sensuality, but they emphasize the  importance of feminine modesty, and declare that the best woman is \"she  who sees not men and whom they see not.\"[16] This deep-rooted modesty of  women towards men in courtship is intimately interwoven with the marriage  customs and magic rites of even the most primitive peoples, and has  survived in many civilized practices to-day.[17] The prostitute must be  able to simulate the modesty she may often be far from feeling, and the  immense erotic advantage of the innocent over the vicious woman lies  largely in the fact that in her the exquisite reactions of modesty are  fresh and vigorous. \"I cannot imagine anything that is more sexually  exciting,\" remarks Hans Menjago, \"than to observe a person of the opposite  sex, who, by some external or internal force, is compelled to fight  against her physical modesty. The more modest she is the more sexually  exciting is the picture she presents.\"[18] It is notable that even in  abnormal, as well as in normal, erotic passion the desire is for innocent  and not for vicious women, and, in association with this, the desired  favor to be keenly relished must often be gained by sudden surprise and  not by mutual agreement. A foot fetichist writes to me: \"It is the  _stolen_ glimpse of a pretty foot or ankle which produces the greatest  effect on me.\" A urolagnic symbolist was chiefly excited by the act of  urination when he caught a young woman unawares in the act. A fetichistic  admirer of the nates only desired to see this region in innocent girls,  not in prostitutes. The exhibitionist, almost invariably, only exposes  himself to apparently respectable girls.        A Russian correspondent, who feels this charm of women in a      particularly strong degree, is inclined to think that there is an      element of perversity in it. \"In the erotic action of the idea of      feminine enjoyment,\" he writes, \"I think there are traces of a      certain perversity. In fact, owing to the impressions of early      youth, woman (even if we feel contempt for her in theory) is      placed above us, on a certain pedestal, as an almost sacred      being, and the more so because mysterious. Now sensuality and      sexual desire are considered as rather vulgar, and a little      dirty, even ridiculous and degrading, not to say bestial. The      woman who enjoys it, is, therefore, rather like a profaned altar,      or, at least, like a divinity who has descended on to the earth.      To give enjoyment to a woman is, therefore, like perpetrating a      sacrilege, or at least like taking a liberty with a god. The      feelings bequeathed to us by a long social civilization maintain      themselves in spite of our rational and deliberate opinions.      Reason tells us that there is nothing evil in sexual enjoyment,      whether in man or woman, but an unconscious feeling directs our      emotions, and this feeling (having a germ that was placed in      modern men by Christianity, and perhaps by still older religions)      says that woman _ought_ to be an absolutely pure being, with      ethereal sensations, and that in her sexual enjoyment is out of      place, improper, scandalous. To arouse sexual emotions in a      woman, if not to profane a sacred host, is, at all events, the      staining of an immaculate peplos; if not sacrilege, it is, at      least, irreverence or impertinence. For all men, the chaster a      woman is, the more agreeable it is to bring her to the orgasm.      That is felt as a triumph of the body over the soul, of sin over      virtue, of earth over heaven. There is something diabolic in such      pleasure, especially when it is felt by a man intoxicated with      love, and full of religious respect for the virgin of his      election. This feeling is, from a rational point of view, absurd,      and in its tendencies, immoral; but it is delicious in its      sacredly voluptuous subtlety. Defloration thus has its powerful      fascination in the respect consciously or unconsciously felt for      woman's chastity. In marriage, the feeling is yet more      complicated: in deflowering his bride, the Christian (that is,      any man brought up in a Christian civilization) has the feeling      of committing a sort of sin (for the 'flesh' is, for him, always      connected with sin) which, by a special privilege, has for him      become legitimate. He has received a special permit to corrupt      innocence. Hence, the peculiar prestige for civilized Christians,      of the wedding night, sung by Shelley, in ecstatic  verses:--            \"'Oh, joy! Oh, fear! What will be done          In the absence of the sun!'\"        This feeling has, however, its normal range, and is not, _per      se_, a perversity, though it may doubtless become so when unduly      heightened by Christian sentiment, and especially if it leads, as      to some extent it has led in my Russian correspondent, to an      abnormal feeling of the sexual attraction of girls who have only      or scarcely reached the age of puberty. The sexual charm of this      period of girlhood is well illustrated in many of the poems of      Thomas Ashe, and it is worthy of note, as perhaps supporting the      contention that this attraction is based on Christian feeling,      that Ashe had been a clergyman. An attentiveness to the woman's      pleasure remains, in itself, very far from a perversion, but      increases, as Colin Scott has pointed out, with civilization,      while its absence--the indifference to the partner's pleasure--is      a perversion of the most degraded kind.    There is no such instinctive demand on the woman's part for innocence in  the man.[19] In the nature of things that could not be. Such emotion is  required for properly playing the part of the pursued; it is by no means  an added attraction on the part of the pursuer. There is, however, an  allied and corresponding desire which is very often clearly or latently  present in the woman: a longing for pleasure that is stolen or forbidden.  It is a mistake to suppose that this is an indication of viciousness or"]]]
