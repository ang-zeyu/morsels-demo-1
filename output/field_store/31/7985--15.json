We have a pale reflection of that sort of  antagonism at our own doors in the bitterness between Protestants and  Roman Catholics in Ulster. All over India, Mahomedans and Hindus alike  remember the centuries of Mahomedan domination, the latter with the  bitterness bred of the long oppression that struck down their gods and  mutilated their shrines, the former with the unquenched pride and  unquenchable hope of a fierce faith which will yet, they believe, make  the whole world subject to Allah, the one God, and Mahomed, his one  Prophet.          CHAPTER IV    BRITISH RULE UNDER THE EAST INDIA COMPANY      The basic fact which has governed the whole evolution of British rule in  India is that we went there in the first instance as traders, and not as  conquerors. For trade meant co-operation. There could be no successful  trading for British traders unless they found Indian traders ready to  co-operate with them in trade. That we ever went to India at all was due  to the national instincts of an insular people accustomed to go down to  the sea in ships and to trade with distant lands. When the rise of great  Mahomedan states on the southern and eastern shores of the  Mediterranean, and finally the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks,  blocked the overland trade routes from Christendom into the Orient, our  forefathers determined to emulate the example of the Spaniards and  Portuguese and open up new ocean highways to the remote markets credited  with fabulous wealth which would have been otherwise lost to them  indefinitely. The handful of English merchant-venturers who under Queen  Elizabeth's charter first established three hundred years ago a few  precarious settlements on the far-flung shores of a then almost unknown  continent no more dreamt of ruling India than did the great East India  Company of which they had laid the foundations when it first sought to  extend its trading operations into the interior and sent an embassy to  court the goodwill of the mighty Moghul emperors then at the height of  their power. Throughout those early days co-operation between Indians  and Englishmen, though then for the sole purpose of trade, was the  principle that guided British enterprise in India, and the venturers  would never have grown and thriven as they did had they not laid  themselves out to secure the confidence and co-operation of the Indians  who flocked to their \"factories.\" At home too it was not dominion, but  the profits derived from the Indian trade that occupied the mind of the  nation. Not till the disintegration of the Moghul Empire in the  eighteenth century plunged India into a welter of anarchy which  endangered not only our trade but the safety of our settlements, which,  like the foreign settlements in the Chinese Treaty Ports to-day,  attracted in increasing numbers an indigenous population in search of  security for life and property, did the Directors of the East India  Company consent to depart from their policy of absolute non-intervention  in the internal affairs of India. Nor was it till, in the course of the  great duel between England and France for the mastery of the seas which  only ended at Trafalgar, the genius of Dupleix threatened the very  existence of the East India Company that the British nation began to  face the responsibilities of British dominion in India as the only  alternative to the greater danger of French dominion. It was the French  challenge to Britain's position all over the world far more than any  deliberate policy of conquest in India that drove successive agents of  the East India Company to enlarge the area of British authority, and  successive Governments at home to acquiesce and aid in its enlargement,  until ultimately the whole peninsula was made subject to the paramount  British power from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin.    But even that long period of irresistible expansion was a period of  almost constant co-operation between British and Indians. The East India  Company extended its authority quite as much by a system of alliances  with indigenous rulers, who turned to our growing power to save them  from destruction at the hands of Haidar Ali or of the Mahratta  confederacy, as by mere force of arms, and, when it had to use force,  its most decisive victories in the field were won by armies in which  Indian troops fought shoulder to shoulder with British troops. At  Plassey in 1757 and at Buxar in 1764, when the destinies of India were  still in the balance, the British, though the backbone of the Company's  forces, formed only a tithe numerically of the victorious armies that  fought under Clive and Munro. The traditions of loyal comradeship  between the Indian and the British army, only once and for a short time  seriously broken during the Mutiny of 1857, can be traced back to the  earliest days of British ascendancy, just as the map of India to-day,  with hundreds of native States, covering one-third of the total area and  nearly one-fourth of the total population under the autonomous rulership  of their own ancient dynasties, testifies to the wisdom and moderation  which inspired the policy of the East India Company in preferring,  wherever circumstances made co-operation possible, co-operation based  upon alliances to submission enforced by the sword.    In the same spirit there grew up at home with the extension of British  dominion in India a definite determination on the part of the British  Government and the British people to control the methods by which  British dominion was to be exercised and maintained. So when the British  in India ceased to be mere traders and became administrators and rulers,  they had behind them not only the driving power, but the restraining  force also, of a civilisation which was producing in England new  conceptions of personal rights destined profoundly to affect the  relations between those who govern and those who are governed. Those  conceptions which underlay both the great Cromwellian upheaval and the  more peaceful revolution of 1688 were at first limited in their  application to the free people of Britain, but they began before long to  influence also the attitude of the British people towards the alien  races brought under their sway. The motives which prompted English  colonial enterprise in its earliest stages did not differ materially  from those which prompted the Spanish and the Portuguese, the Dutch and  the French. All were impelled primarily by the desire to attain wealth.  But whilst our competitors never got much beyond that stage, and for the  most part imagined that the only way to attain wealth was by a crude  exploitation of subject countries and peoples, the British were saved  from similar short-sightedness by the very different spirit with which  the development of their own national institutions had imbued their  rulers at home. By the middle of the eighteenth century a British  Government had a very different sense of its responsibilities to the  British people for the welfare of the nation as a whole from that which  any continental ruler had been taught to entertain in regard to his own  people. That sense of responsibility the British Government and the  British people applied in a modified form to the administration of their  Indian possessions.    So long as British settlements were confined to trading factories on the  shores of the Indian Ocean, the problems of administration were simple.  The three \"Presidents\" who with their large and rather unwieldy Councils  carried on at the beginning of the eighteenth century the affairs of the  East India Company on the west coast, at Madras and in Bengal were  chiefly concerned with commercial operations, and they provided in their  own way and out of their own resources for the maintenance of the public  peace within the narrow areas subject to their jurisdiction. But matters  assumed a very different complexion when instead of merely taking  abundant tithe of the wealth acquired by the enterprise and ability of  British traders in a far-away land, the British people had to lend  financial and military assistance in order to rescue the East India  Company from destruction at the hands of their French rivals as well as  from the overwhelming ruin of internecine strife all over India. The  grant of the _Diwani_ to the Company by the titular Emperor of Delhi  gave the Company not only the wealth of Bengal, the richest province in  India, but full rights of government and administration, which were at  first ruthlessly exercised with little or no regard for the interests of  the unfortunate population, who alone gained nothing by the change. The  magnitude of the financial transactions between the Company and the  British Government, which was sometimes heavily subsidised by the  Company's coffers and then in turn compelled to make considerable  advances in order to replenish them, and the splendour of the fortunes  amassed by many of the Company's servants who returned from India to  spend them in ostentatious luxury and in political intrigue at home,  combined with the brilliant achievements of British arms on Indian soil  to focus public attention on Indian affairs. They became one of the live  issues of British party politics.    There was much that was squalid and grossly unjust in the rancorous  campaigns conducted first against Clive and then against Warren  Hastings. But behind all the personal jealousies and the greed of  factions there was a strong and healthy public instinct that the  responsibilities assumed by the East India Company were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15604"],[0,"Piano Mastery: Talks with Master Pianists and Teachers (#15)"],[1,"is to express himself, which he will do  easily and naturally, when his has such a preparation as I have referred  to.      MEMORIZING    \"I am often questioned on the subject of memorizing. Some pupils think  if they play the piece a sufficient number of times they will know it;  then are troubled because they cannot at all times remember the notes.  Such players must know every note of the piece away from the piano, and  be able to recite them. I have students who are able to learn their  music away from the instrument, and can play it to me without having  tried it on the piano. I require the piece so thoroughly memorized that  if I correct a measure or phrase, the pupil can go right on from that  point, without being obliged to start farther back, or at the beginning.  In some cases, however, if the pupil has her own method of committing to  memory, and it is successful, I have no desire to change it.      OCTAVE STUDIES    \"For octave study, form the hand with the 'octave grimace,'--that is  with arched hand, the unemployed fingers slightly curved. In staccato  touch of course use light wrist. Begin with one beat in sixteenths and  finish with the 'wiping off' touch. Build up more and more beats in  notes of the same value, always ending the passage with the same touch,  as above mentioned. This exercise can be played the full length of the  keyboard, in all keys, and also chromatically. It can be played in the  same fashion, using four-voiced chords instead of octaves. When such an  exercise can be prolonged for twenty minutes at a time, octave passages  in pieces have no terrors for the pianist. For the octaves in Chopin's  Polonaise Op. 53, he would merely have to learn the notes, which can be  done away from the piano; there is no need for exhaustive practise of  the passage.      KEEPING UP REPERTOIRE    \"In order to keep repertoire in repair, one should have it arranged so  that old pieces are gone over once a week. Group your repertoire into  sections and programs. It might be well to begin the week with Chopin,  playing through the whole list; after which pick out the weak places,  and practise those. Tuesday, take Schumann, and treat him in the same  way. Then comes Liszt, Russian music, modern composers, concertos, and  chamber music. In this systematic way the whole repertoire is kept up.      DETAILS OF PRACTISE    \"My mornings are given up to practise, my afternoons to teaching. Of  these practise hours, at least one hour is given to technic, scales,  arpeggios, octaves, chords--and Bach! I believe in taking one selection  of Bach, say a Two-voiced Invention, and perfecting it, playing it in  various ways--transposing it into all keys and polishing it to the  highest degree possible. The B flat Invention is a useful one for this  treatment. So with etudes; instead of playing _at_ so many, is it not  better to perfect a few and bring them up to the highest degree of  completeness?    \"I am very susceptible to color, anywhere, in anything--especially in  pictures. Music should express color. Certain compositions seem to  embody certain colors. As you suggest, red is certainly the motif of  Chopin's great Polonaise, Op. 53.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Burnham should certainly look forward to success in his visit to his  native land.

XVI    EDWIN HUGHES    SOME ESSENTIALS OF PIANO PLAYING      When one has read with pleasure and profit the published ideas of a  musical worker and thinker, it is always an interesting experience to  meet such an one personally, and have the opportunity to discuss points  of special import, particularly when the meeting can take place in some  ideal spot in the old world. Such was my thought in visiting Mr. Edwin  Hughes, an American who has made a name and place for himself among the  pianists and teachers of Europe. After years of study in Vienna with  Leschetizky, where he also acted as one of the _Vorbereiters_, he has  established himself in Munich, where he feels he has found a true home  of music and art. Here, amid beautiful and artistic surroundings, he  lives and works, dividing his time between teaching and concert playing.  As a pianist Mr. Hughes has met with gratifying success in the most  important cities of Germany, while as a teacher he has been sought by  students from almost every State in America, from Maine to Texas, and  also from Canada. What has given him special satisfaction is that during  the past year a number of pupils have come to him from the Conservatory  here in Munich. They have been greatly pleased with their progress, only  regretting they had not come to him before.    As to whether he uses the Leschetizky method in its entirety, Mr. Hughes  testified in the affirmative.    \"If you were to ask Leschetizky about the 'Leschetizky Method,' he would  probably laugh and tell you he has no method, or he would tell you his  'method' consists of only two things--firm fingers and pliable wrist.    \"These are the principles upon which I base the technical training of my  pupils. I first establish an arched hand position, and then test the  firmness of the fingers and knuckle joints by tapping them. At first the  joints, particularly the nail joints, are very apt to sink in when  tapped by a lead pencil; but by having the pupil continue the tapping  process at home, it is not long before he acquires the feeling of  conscious firmness in his fingers.    \"Along with this exercise it is most important to begin at once with  wrist exercises, as otherwise, from the effort to acquire firmness of  finger, the wrist may become stiff and unwieldy. The wrist exercises  consist in raising and lowering this joint, with the hand and arm  supported first on each finger separately, then on two, three, four and  five fingers. The wrist should not be so limp as to be incapable of  resistance; but rather it should be like a fine steel spring--a  'spring-wrist,' I call it--capable of every degree of resistance or  non-resistance the quality of tone demands.    \"High finger action is not so necessary for beginners as most piano  teachers imagine. It is much easier to teach pupils to raise their  fingers high, than it is to teach them the acquisition of the _legato_  touch at the piano, which is only to be attained by playing close to the  keys, without raising the fingers. It is difficult to get pupils to play  a perfect _legato_ who have had years of training with high finger  action, something which should be taken up for _non-legato_ and  _staccato_ finger work _after_ the more difficult _legato_ touch has  been mastered.      TONE PRODUCTION    \"The subject of tone production is one which is much neglected by piano  teachers. Viewed from this standpoint the piano is an instrument apart  from every other, except in some respects the organ. A young violinist,  'cellist or flutist has to study for some time before he can produce a  tone of good musical quality on his instrument. Think what the beginner  on the violin has to go through before he can make a respectable middle  C; but anybody, even a totally unmusical person, can play middle C on  the piano without the least trouble. It is just this ease in tone  production at the piano which leads to carelessness as to the _kind_ of  tone produced; and so piano teachers, above all others, complain they  cannot get their pupils to listen to what they are playing. Pupils  should be made to listen, by means of a special course in tone  production, which should go hand in hand with the technical exercises  used at the very beginning. Otherwise they imagine they are making music  when they place the printed page on the rack, and set the correct keys  in motion.    \"There is no other instrument with which it is so easy to 'bluff' a  large part of the audience; for the character of the piano is such that  the general public often think it fine music if the player makes a big  noise. Pianists of considerable reputation often take advantage of this  lack of discrimination on the part of piano-recital audiences, which,  above all the other audiences, seem peculiarly incapable of judging  correctly the musical value of a performance.    \"Of the hundreds of piano recitals which take place yearly in the  musical centers of Europe, only a comparatively small number are of real  musical interest. In many cases it seems as though the players were  merely repeating something learned by rote, in an unknown language; just  as though I should repeat a poem in Italian. The words I might pronounce  after a fashion, but the meaning of most of them would be a blank to  me--so how could I make others understand them.      RHYTHM IN PIANO PLAYING    \"The subject of rhythm is an important one, and more attention should be  given it. Leschetizky once said that tones and rhythm are the only  things which can keep the piano alive as a solo instrument. I find in  pupils who come to me so much deficiency in these two subjects, that I  have organized classes in ear-training and rhythm.    \"If pupils have naturally a poor sense of rhythm, there is no remedy  equal to practising with a metronome, using this instrument of torture  daily until results are evident, when, of course, there must be a  judicious slowing down in its use. The mechanical sense of rhythm, the  ability to count three or four to a measure, and to group the notes of a  piece correctly, can be taught to any person, if one has the patience;  but for those delicate rhythmic _nuances_ required by a Chopin mazurka  or a Viennese waltz, a specific rhythmic gift must be possessed by the  pupil.    \"Leschetizky says little to his pupils on the subject of technic; I  cannot remember his having spoken a dozen words to me on the subject,  during all the time I have known him. His interest, of course, lies "]]]
