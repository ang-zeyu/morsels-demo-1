Thus it is that at a very early stage of the child's life we are brought  face to face with the question how we may most wisely begin his initiation  into the knowledge of the great central facts of sex. It is perhaps a  little late in the day to regard it as a question, but so it is among us,  although three thousand five hundred years ago, the Egyptian father spoke  to his child: \"I have given you a mother who has carried you within her, a  heavy burden, for your sake, and without resting on me. When at last you  were born, she indeed submitted herself to the yoke, for during three  years were her nipples in your mouth. Your excrements never turned her  stomach, nor made her say, 'What am I doing?' When you were sent to school  she went regularly every day to carry the household bread and beer to your  master. When in your turn you marry and have a child, bring up your child  as your mother brought you up.\"[20]    I take it for granted, however, that--whatever doubt there may be as to  the how or the when--no doubt is any longer possible as to the absolute  necessity of taking deliberate and active part in this sexual initiation,  instead of leaving it to the chance revelation of ignorant and perhaps  vicious companions or servants. It is becoming more and more widely felt  that the risks of ignorant innocence are too great.        \"All the love and solicitude parental yearning can bestow,\"      writes Dr. G.F. Butler, of Chicago (_Love and its Affinities_,      1899, p. 83), \"all that the most refined religious influence can      offer, all that the most cultivated associations can accomplish,      in one fatal moment may be obliterated. There is no room for      ethical reasoning, indeed oftentimes no consciousness of wrong,      but only Margaret's 'Es war so suess'.\" The same writer adds (as      had been previously remarked by Mrs. Craik and others) that among      church members it is the finer and more sensitive organizations      that are the most susceptible to sexual emotions. So far as boys      are concerned, we leave instruction in matters of sex, the most      sacred and central fact in the world, as Canon Lyttelton remarks,      to \"dirty-minded school-boys, grooms, garden-boys, anyone, in      short, who at an early age may be sufficiently defiled and      sufficiently reckless to talk of them.\" And, so far as girls are      concerned, as Balzac long ago remarked, \"a mother may bring up      her daughter severely, and cover her beneath her wings for      seventeen years; but a servant-girl can destroy that long work by      a word, even by a gesture.\"        The great part played by servant-girls of the lower class in the      sexual initiation of the children of the middle class has been      illustrated in dealing with \"The Sexual Impulse in Women\" in vol.      iii, of these _Studies_, and need not now be further discussed.      I would only here say a word, in passing, on the other side.      Often as servant-girls take this part, we must not go so far as      to say that it is the case with the majority. As regards Germany,      Dr. Alfred Kind has lately put on record his experience: \"I have      _never_, in youth, heard a bad or improper word on      sex-relationships from a servant-girl, although servant-girls      followed one another in our house like sunshine and showers in      April, and there was always a relation of comradeship between us      children and the servants.\" As regards England, I can add that my      own youthful experiences correspond to Dr. Kind's. This is not      surprising, for one may say that in the ordinary well-conditioned      girl, though her virtue may not be developed to heroic      proportions, there is yet usually a natural respect for the      innocence of children, a natural sexual indifference to them, and      a natural expectation that the male should take the active part      when a sexual situation arises.    It is also beginning to be felt that, especially as regards women,  ignorant innocence is not merely too fragile a possession to be worth  preservation, but that it is positively mischievous, since it involves the  lack of necessary knowledge. \"It is little short of criminal,\" writes Dr.  F.M. Goodchild,[21] \"to send our young people into the midst of the  excitements and temptations of a great city with no more preparation than  if they were going to live in Paradise.\" In the case of women, ignorance  has the further disadvantage that it deprives them of the knowledge  necessary for intelligent sympathy with other women. The unsympathetic  attitude of women towards women is often largely due to sheer ignorance of  the facts of life. \"Why,\" writes in a private letter a married lady who  keenly realizes this, \"are women brought up with such a profound ignorance  of their own and especially other women's natures? They do not know half  as much about other women as a man of the most average capacity learns in  his day's march.\" We try to make up for our failure to educate women in  the essential matters of sex by imposing upon the police and other  guardians of public order the duty of protecting women and morals. But, as  Moll insists, the real problem of chastity lies, not in the multiplication  of laws and policemen, but largely in women's knowledge of the dangers of  sex and in the cultivation of their sense of responsibility.[22] We are  always making laws for the protection of children and setting the police  on guard. But laws and the police, whether their activities are good or  bad, are in either case alike ineffectual. They can for the most part only  be invoked when the damage is already done. We have to learn to go to the  root of the matter. We have to teach children to be a law to themselves.  We have to give them that knowledge which will enable them to guard their  own personalities.[23] There is an authentic story of a lady who had  learned to swim, much to the horror of her clergyman, who thought that  swimming was unfeminine. \"But,\" she said, \"suppose I was drowning.\" \"In  that case,\" he replied, \"you ought to wait until a man comes along and  saves you.\" There we have the two methods of salvation which have been  preached to women, the old method and the new. In no sea have women been  more often in danger of drowning than that of sex. There ought to be no  question as to which is the better method of salvation.        It is difficult nowadays to find any serious arguments against      the desirability of early sexual enlightenment, and it is almost      with amusement that we read how the novelist Alphonse Daudet,      when asked his opinion of such enlightenment, protested--in a      spirit certainly common among the men of his time--that it was      unnecessary, because boys could learn everything from the streets      and the newspapers, while \"as to young girls--no! I would teach      them none of the truths of physiology. I can only see      disadvantages in such a proceeding. These truths are ugly,      disillusioning, sure to shock, to frighten, to disgust the mind,      the nature, of a girl.\" It is as much as to say that there is no      need to supply sources of pure water when there are puddles in      the street that anyone can drink of. A contemporary of Daudet's,      who possessed a far finer spiritual insight, Coventry Patmore,      the poet, in the essay on \"Ancient and Modern Ideas of Purity\" in      his beautiful book, _Religio Poetae_, had already finely protested      against that \"disease of impurity\" which comes of \"our modern      undivine silences\" for which Daudet pleaded. And Metchnikoff,      more recently, from the scientific side, speaking especially as      regards women, declares that knowledge is so indispensable for      moral conduct that \"ignorance must be counted the most immoral of      acts\" (_Essais Optimistes_, p. 420).        The distinguished Belgian novelist, Camille Lemonnier, in his      _L'Homme en Amour_, deals with the question of the sexual      education of the young by presenting the history of a young man,      brought up under the influence of the conventional and      hypocritical views which teach that nudity and sex are shameful      and disgusting things. In this way he passes by the opportunities      of innocent and natural love, to become hopelessly enslaved at      last to a sensual woman who treats him merely as the instrument      of her pleasure, the last of a long succession of lovers. The      book is a powerful plea for a sane, wholesome, and natural      education in matters of sex. It was, however, prosecuted at      Bruges, in 1901, though the trial finally ended in acquittal.      Such a verdict is in harmony with the general tendency of feeling      at the present time.        The old ideas, expressed by Daudet, that the facts of sex are      ugly and disillusioning, and that they shock the mind of the      young, are both alike entirely false. As Canon Lyttelton remarks,      in urging that the laws of the transmission of life should be      taught to children by the mother: \"The way they receive it with      native reverence, truthfulness of understanding and guileless      delicacy, is nothing short of a revelation of the never-ceasing      beauty of nature. People sometimes speak of the indescribable      beauty of children's innocence. But I venture to say that no one      quite knows what it is who has foregone the privilege of being      the first to set before them the true meaning of life and birth      and the mystery of their own being. Not only do we fail to build      up sound knowledge in them, but we put away from ourselves the      chance"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#15)"],[1,"cornice on which the  roof was originally laid, there is now a length of painted wood  containing coats of arms obviously of later date than the ceiling. It is  not possible to pronounce with certainty on the question. But  considering (1), that the whole ceiling was certainly raised in  consequence of the superior height of the tower arch (2), that no  difference can be detected between the centre compartments and those at  the side in the patterns, and (3), that additional height has been  secured by the Decorated boarding above mentioned, the most probable  solution seems to be that the whole is the original Norman work,  practically unaltered, and that it was never flat, but had always  sloping sides as at present. All agree that the style of the painting is  perfectly characteristic of the period. The divisions are of the lozenge  shape; in each lozenge of the central line is a figure, and in each  alternate one of the sides. The middle set has more elongated lozenges  than the others. The borders are black and white, with some coloured  lines, in odd zigzag patterns. The figures, which are mostly seated, are  very quaint and strange. Some are sacred, some grotesque. We can see  S. Peter with the keys, kings, queens, and minstrels; we find also a  head with two faces, a monkey riding backwards on a goat, a human figure  with head and hoofs of an ass, a donkey playing a harp, a winged dragon,  a dancing lion, an eagle, and other curious devices.    [Illustration: The Choir and Nave, looking West.]    =The Font= stands between the first and second piers on the north side  of the nave; the basin is of a local marble of thirteenth century date,  but the lower part is modern. For many years it was used as a flower pot  in one of the prebendal gardens, whence it was rescued by Dean Monk and  ultimately restored to its original use in the south end of the western  transept. It was placed where it is in 1920. Another font had been  erected in 1615, as appears by an entry in the cathedral register of  that date, when the son of one of the prebendaries was baptized \"in the  new font in the bodye of the Cathedral Church here.\"    =The West Transept= extends beyond the aisles. The huge pointed arches  covered with Norman mouldings are very remarkable. The arcading which  goes round the lower part of the aisle walls was continued round the  east sides and the ends of this transept, but it has all been hacked  away, and the walls now are flat. The position of the arcade is very  plainly to be seen. The south end in 1921 was again restored to its  former use as a chapel by the Dean of Winchester, Dr. Hutton. The north  end of this transept is used as a vestry. It is screened off, with the  adjacent bays of the north aisle, by some of the woodwork that has been  removed from Dean Monk's choir. From these specimens the general  character of the whole can be easily gathered.    The west wall has no trace of Norman work. The arcade by the ground  consists of pointed arches, though the great doorway has a round arch;  all have Early English mouldings. The great doors themselves are of the  same date, as shown by the carved capital at the top. The west window,  with its Perpendicular tracery, is set inside an Early English arch,  which has two lofty lancets by the side; and in looking at it from the  east it can hardly be detected that this arch is not the very framework  of the window. The very lofty lancets on the east of the projecting  parts of this transept, as well as the decoration of the arches in the  triforium above the aisles, should be noticed.    The number of =Altars= in the church was considerable. They were of  course all served by members of the foundation. but they had not  separate endowments like chantries in a parish church. Nor does any one  appear to have been associated with any company or guild. There were,  besides the High Altar and that in the Lady Chapel, three in the new  building, one in the little chapel between the choir and Lady Chapel,  one in each choir aisle, two (SS. John and James) in the north transept,  four (SS. Oswald, Benedict, and Kyneburga, and the Holy Trinity) in the  south transept, two (the Ostrie Chapel and that of the Holy Spirit) in  the building west of the south transept, one in the rood-loft, most  likely four against pillars in the nave (a bracket on a pillar on the  north side marks the position of one), and apparently one in the south  part of the west transept. If this enumeration is correct there were not  less than twenty-two. There seems also to have been an altar in the  hearse over Queen Katherine's tomb; and, though no mention of them  occurs, we should suppose there must have been one on each side of the  entrance beneath the rood-loft.    Two altar-stones only have been found. One is marked on a plan made  about 180 years ago as being laid down in the choir a little to the east  of where the eagle lectern now stands. It was subsequently taken up,  sawn into three pieces, and placed beneath the arch leading from the  western transept to the south aisle. Some twenty-five years ago it was  again removed from the pavement and is preserved elsewhere. The five  crosses are large and deeply cut, and are in the form of  cross-crosslets. The other has been taken up from the pavement in the  eastern chapel. It is a very curious example, and one that might well  escape notice. The stone is of the usual size, and uninscribed. It is  much worn by constant treadings, and the five crosses are nearly  obliterated, though quite distinctly to be seen. But instead of there  being, as usual, one in each corner of the stone, or nearly so, all the  five are towards the centre of the stone, within a space of about two  square feet. There is also an extra cross on the front edge. This stone  is now used for the altar in S. Oswald's Chapel, in the south transept,  refitted in 1900.    Of =Stained Glass= the only ancient examples are some fragments that  have been collected from different parts of the church, mostly as it  seems from the cloister, and put together in two central windows in the  apse. These are well worth observing with care. No scenes of course can  be made out, but the faces, when examined closely, are found to be  singularly good. Most of the pieces formed portions of a window or  series of windows representing incidents in the life of S. Peter. This  is apparent from the few words that can still be made out on the labels,  which are all fragments of texts referring to that Saint. The large  west window is in memory of soldiers of Northamptonshire who fell during  the South African War, 1899-1902; the window has five lights in two  tiers; in the upper are representations of King Peada, S. Paul, S.  Peter, S. Andrew, and Bishop Ethelwold; in the lower, S. George, Joshua,  S. Michael, Gideon, and S. Alban. Brass plates below give the roll of  honour.    [Illustration: Head of S. Peter in Ancient Stained Glass.]    Five windows of the eastern chapel have now been refilled with-stained  glass, one facing north to the late Dean Barlow, 1908; another behind  the altar was given by Canon Argles (afterwards Dean) in memory of his  father-in-law, Bishop Davys. In the south-east corner the east window is  to the memory of Dean Butler, 1861, and the south one to Canon Alderson;  the churches pictured are S. Mary's, Lutterworth, All Saints', Holdenby,  and a view of the south-east of this cathedral. The next window is in  memory of Canon Twells, author of several hymns, including \"At even ere  the sun was set.\" In S. Oswald's Chapel is a very beautiful window given  in 1900. In the north choir aisle is a memorial window to Thomas Mills,  Hon. Canon, 1856. In the south transept some in memory of Payne Edwards,  LL.B., 1861; Sir Chapman Marshall, Kt., Alderman of London, whose son  was Precentor here; and James Cattel, cathedral librarian, 1877. In the  north transept are several given by Mr G.W. Johnson, two in memory of  his father and mother, one to the Prince Consort, and some unconnected  with any names; there are also two in memory of George John Gates, 1860,  and John Hewitt Paley \"juvenis desideratissimi,\" 1857.    The architecture of =The Parvise=, over the western porch, has been  already described. It now contains the library, removed to this place  from the new building by Dean Tarrant. The collection was begun by Dean  Duport, who presented books himself, and obtained more from the  Prebendaries and other persons; it was afterwards enriched with the  whole of the valuable library of Bishop Kennett, and part of Dean  Lockier's, and has since had many considerable additions. The  manuscripts are not numerous, the chief being the very important book  known as Swapham. The greater part of this has been printed by Sparkes.  His publication includes Abbot John's Chronicle, The History of Burgh by  Hugo Candidus with its continuation by Swapham, the Chronicle of Walter  of Whittlesey, and two other works. There are also kept here some of  the fabric rolls of the monastery. Bishop Kennett's library contained a  most valuable collection of tracts and pamphlets published in the latter  part of the seventeenth century. There are also some books of much  earlier date, a few of great rarity. A memorandum written in the Book of  Swapham above mentioned tells us that the Precentor, Humphrey Austin,  had hidden it in 1642 in anticipation of coming troubles. But Cromwell's  soldiers found it, and would probably have destroyed it; the Precentor,  however, under pretence of enquiring after an old Latin bible, found out  where it was, and redeemed it for the sum of ten shillings.    =Monuments and Inscriptions=.--We proceed to speak of these, treated as  a single subject, instead of describing them at the various parts of the  building where they are to be found.
