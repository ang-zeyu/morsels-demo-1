LESSON LXXIV.  THE SNOWBIRD'S SONG.    1.  The ground was all covered with snow one day,  And two little sisters were busy at play,  When a snowbird was sitting close by on a tree,  And merrily singing his chick-a-de-dee.     198  ECLECTIC SERIES.    2.  He had not been singing that tune very long  Ere Emily heard him, so loud was his song;  \"O sister, look out of the window!\" said she;  \"Here's a dear little bird singing chick-a-de-dee.        3.  \"Poor fellow! he walks in the snow and the sleet,  And has neither stockings nor shoes on his feet:  I wonder what makes him so full of his glee;  He's all the time singing his chick-a-de-dee.    4.  \"If I were a barefooted snowbird, I know,  I would not stay out in the cold and the snow;  I pity him so! oh, how cold he must be!  And yet he keeps singing his chick-a-de-dee.     THIRD READER.  199    5. \"O mother; do get him some stockings, and shoes,  And a nice little frock, and a hat if he choose:  I wish he'd come into the parlor, and see  How warm we would make him, poor chick-a-de-dee!\"    6. The bird had flown down for some sweet crumbs of bread,  And heard every word little Emily said:  \"What a figure I'd make in that dress\" thought he,  And laughed as he warbled his chick-a-de-dee.    7. \"I am grateful,\" said he, \"for the wish you express,  But have no occasion for such a fine dress;  I rather remain with my little limbs free,  Than to hobble about, singing chick-a-de-dee.    8.  \"There is One, my dear child, though I can not tell who,  Has clothed me already, and warm enough, too.  Good morning! Oh, who are so happy as we?\"  And away he flew, singing his chick-a-de-dee.  F. C. Woodworth.                 200  ECLECTIC SERIES.    LESSON LXXV.  MOUNTAINS.  1. The Himalayas are the highest mountains on our globe,  They are in Asia, and separate India from Thibet. They  extend in a continuous line for more than a thousand miles.  2. If you ever ascend one of these mountains from the  plain below, you will have to cross an unhealthy border,  twenty miles in width. It is, in fact, a swamp caused by the  waters overflowing the river banks.  3. The soil of this swampy border is covered with trees  and shrubs, where the tiger, the elephant, and other animals  find secure retreat. Beyond this border, you will reach  smiling valleys and noble forests.  4. As you advance onward and upward, you will get  among bolder and more rugged scenes. The sides of the  mountains are very steep, sometimes well wooded to quite a  height, but sometimes quite barren.  5. In crossing a river you must be content with three ropes  for a bridge. You will find the streets of the towns to be  simply stairs     THIRD READER.  201  cut out of the rock, and see the houses rising in tiers.  6. The pathways into Thibet, among these mountains, are  mere tracks by the side of    foaming torrents. Often, as you advance, you will find every  trace of the path swept away by the failing of rocks and earth  from above.    202  ECLECTIC SERIES.  7. Sometimes you will find posts driven into the mountain  side, upon which branches of trees and earth are spread. This  forms a trembling foothold for the traveler.  8. In the Andes, in South America, the sure-footed mule is  used to carry travelers. Quite often a chasm must be crossed  that is many feet wide and hundreds of feet deep. The mule  will leap across this chasm, but not until it is sure it can  make a safe jump.  9. \"One day,\" says a traveler, \"I went by the worst pass  over the Andes Mountains. The path for seventy yards was  very narrow, and at one point it was washed entirely away.  On one side the rock brushed my shoulder, and on the other  side my foot overhung the precipice.\"  10. The guide told this man, after he was safely over the  pass, that, to his knowledge, four hundred mules had fallen  over that precipice, and in many instances travelers had lost  their lives at that terrible spot.

God make my life a little flower,  That giveth joy to all,  Content to bloom in native bower,  Although its place be small.    3. God make my life a little song,  That comforteth the sad;  That helpeth others to be strong,  And makes the singer glad.    4. God make my life a little hymn  Of tenderness and praise;  Of faith--that never waxeth dim  In all His wondrous ways.    204  ECLECTIC SERIES,    LESSON LXXVII.  HOLDING THE FORT.  1. While Genie was walking slowly down street one day,  she heard an odd rapping on the pavement behind her.  Looking round, she saw Rob Grey hobbling on crutches.  2. \"Why, what is the matter?\" cried Genie. \"I have n't seen  you for a week, and now you are walking in that way.\"  3. \"I shall have to walk in this way as much as a week  longer, Genie. I sprained my ankle by stopping too quick--  no, not too quick, either, for there was something in my  way.\"  \"What was it?\" asked Genie.  4. \"One of the Commandments,\" replied Rob. \"You  remember how that lecturer talked to us about 'holding the  fort'? Well, I thought I should like to do it; but it's a pretty  long war, you know--all a lifetime, and no vacations--  furloughs, I think they call them.\"  5. \"If there was nothing to fight, we should not need to be  soldiers,\" said Genie.  6. \"Well, I thought I would try; but the     THIRD READER.  205  first day, when we came out of the schoolhouse, Jack Lee  snatched my books out of my hand, and threw them into the  mud.  7. \"I started after him as fast as I could run. I meant to  throw him where he had    thrown the books, when, all of a sudden, I thought of the  Commandment about returning good for evil.  8. \"I stopped short--so short, that, somehow,     206  ECLECTIC SERIES.  my foot twisted under me. So, you see, it was one of the  commandments.\"  9. \"If one must stumble at them, it is a good thing to fall  on the right side,\" said Genie, with a wise nod of her head.  10. \"The whole thing puzzles me, and makes me feel--  well, like giving it up,\" said Rob. \"It might have served me  right when I was chasing Jack; but when I thought of the  Commandment, I really tried to do the right thing.\"  11. \"You did do it, Rob,\" said Genie. \"You 'held the fort'  that time. Why, do n't you see--you are only a wounded  soldier.\"  12. \"I never thought of that,\" said Rob.  \"If I believe that  way--\" He began to whistle, and limped off to school without  finishing the sentence. But Genie knew, by the way he  behaved that day, that he had made up his mind to hold the  fort.       THIRD READER.  207    LESSON LXXVIII.    THE LITTLE PEOPLE.    1. A dreary place would be this earth,  Were there no little people in it;  The song of life would lose its mirth,  Were there no children to begin it;    2. No little forms, like buds to grow,  And make the admiring heart surrender;  No little hands on breast and brow,  To keep the thrilling love chords tender.    3. The sterner souls would grow more stern,  Unfeeling nature more inhuman,  And man to utter coldness turn,  And woman would be less than woman.    4. Life's song, indeed, would lose its charm,  Were there no babies to begin it;  A doleful place this world would be,  Were there no little people in it.    John G. Whittier.         208  THIRD READER.    LESSON LXXIX.    GOOD NIGHT.    1. The sun is hidden from our sight,  The birds are sleeping sound;  'T is time to say to all, \"Good night!\"  And give a kiss all round.    2. Good night, my father, mother, dear!  Now kiss your little son;  Good night, my friends, both far and near!  Good night to every one.    3. Good night, ye merry, merry birds!  Sleep well till morning light;  Perhaps, if you could sing in words,  You would have said, \"Good night!\"    4. To all my pretty flowers, good night!  You blossom while I sleep;  And all the stars, that shine so bright,  With you their watches keep.    5. The moon is lighting up the skies,  The stars are sparkling there;  'T is time to shut our weary eyes,  And say our evening prayer.

You  always did it, and I thought you were winding up the youngster hand over  hand.\"    \"Them winks,\" said Raffles, diplomatically, \"was meant to show that I was  moving--moving slow, but sure. You've observed, Mr. Acting, yourself, as  'ow the young shaver had a head on 'is shoulders.\"    \"Yes, but I didn't bargain for yours being off your shoulders.\"    \"Well, what with bunnies, cartridges, and the Blue Cow, and the other  extras, he is about cleaned out now.\"    \"Cleaned out!\" said Acton, with intense irritation. \"That's not what I  wanted. I told you distinctly that I must have him five pounds deep at  the least. How can I engineer my schemes if my sharpers can't cut? You'll  look blue, Raffles, when I settle your account, take my word for it.\"    \"Not quite so quick off the mark, Mr. Acting. What do you value this  piece of ironmongery at?\"    Raffles fished up the gun which had burst in Jack's hands that afternoon  from behind the corn-chest, and held it up to the light.    \"A burst gun!\" said Acton. \"It's worth throwing away; no more.\"    \"It was worth this morning, say fifteen bob, before Bourne blew its ribs  out.\"    \"Jove!\" said Acton, \"let me handle the thing.\" He looked at the torn  breech, and whistled with involuntary horror. \"Much of a squeak,  Raffles?\"    \"Touch and go, sir. He'll never be nearer pegging out than he was this  afternoon; for he scraped the gates of his family buryin'-place, in a  manner of speakin.' It went clean through his hat--rim and crown.\"    \"Did he know his luck?\"    \"Nobody better.\"    \"He looked more than average queer as we trotted home. I thought he was  digesting your little bill, Raffles.\"    \"No; he only owes me a matter of shillin's. But I could say that I  ticketed the gun at L5 or L6, when the old shooter wasn't worth----\"    \"Fifteen bob,\" said Acton, looking at the worn barrel.    \"See where I have--where you have--the youngster tied neatly up? He owes  me--or you--seven, eight, nine pounds, or any fancy figure I--or you--  like to mention for that old piece of iron there.\"    \"Raffles, we're in luck! Luck has served me better than all your downy  work.\"    \"It has,\" said that bright specimen of humanity, regretfully. \"I can't  pretend that I'd any hand in the blowing out of them blessed barrels.\"    \"All right, Raffles; don't weep. You'd have done it, of course, if you'd  thought about it,\" said Acton, with a curious sneer; \"but this is my  plan--as far as you're concerned. When young Bourne comes, you're to ask  for L7 10s. And you're to be an adamantine Jew; you're to have the money  instanter, or there'll be a rumpus.\"    \"I twig. Make it seven guineas, though,\" said Raffles, generously.    \"Seven guineas! So be it. You can suggest that, unless you get the cash,  you would see Moore.\"    \"Corker, D.D.? I'm on.\"    \"Or Bourne, senior.\"    \"The shaver's brother. I'm tumbling to the dodge.\"    \"Bourne will curl up at this.\"    \"Naturally.\"    \"But you're still the blood-thirsty Jew.\"    \"Moses, and Aaron, and the rest.\"    \"You'll suggest at last that I be tackled for a loan.\"    \"And you'll lend it him!\" said Raffles, with an unspeakable leer.    \"The business wants careful handling, remember. Young Bourne will think  twice about borrowing, and, perhaps, if he could keep me out of it, would  stand your racket, or Corker's either. So drive him lightly.\"    \"You'll see him on the borrowing tack to-morrow, Mr. Acting.\"    \"And the rest is my business.\"    \"Where do I come in?\"    \"You can cleave to the seven guineas--if you earn 'em.\"    \"Seven pounds ten, Mr. Acting.\"    \"Seven pound seven, Mr. Raffles. Your own proposal.\"    \"Orl right,\" said Raffles, resignedly. \"I think I know them ropes.\"    \"Good!\" said Acton. \"Then you can scuttle now to Rotherhithe, or where the  deuce else you like. I'm off.\"    Acton wheeled out his bicycle and melted into the gathering dark, and his  jackal lurched off to the station and reached Rotherhithe to dream of his  seven guineas which he was going to get. Raffles felt sure of those seven  guineas.          CHAPTER XV    GRIM'S SUSPICIONS      As I said before, Jack Bourne, after the first bloom of his forbidden  pleasures had worn off, rather repented of the Raffles' connection, and  would gladly have exchanged it for the old, easy, open, and above-board  society of his chums. Grim, Rogers, Wilson, Poulett, etc., were, on their  side, rather sore at Jack's continual desertion of them and their causes.  They had just seen him pedalling easily after Acton, throwing them a  rather mirthless joke as he ran past, and they had, naturally, held a  council to consider matters.    \"Wherever can the beggar get to is what I want to know,\" said Wilson.    \"Can any one tell me what he wants with Acton?\" said Grim.    \"I think that it's Acton that wants him,\" said Rogers. \"Come to think of  it, Grimmy, you're Acton's man. Why doesn't he lag you?\"    \"Grimmy's not to be trusted. He'd read the _billet-doux_\"    \"I don't believe that there's any notes, Wilson,\" said Grim,  impressively, \"in this business. It's something deeper than that.\"    \"What's the mystery, Mr. Grimmy Sherlock Combs?\"    \"Poachin',\" said Grim, solemnly.    \"What!\" exclaimed the other, with breathless interest.    \"Dunno, quite,\" said Grim; \"but that young ass dropped a cartridge from  his pocket the other day.\"    \"There's nothing to poach here, Grimmy.\"    \"There's Pettigrew's pheasants,\" said Grim, mysteriously.    \"But you don't shoot them in March.\"    \"_We_ don't, Poulett, but poachers do.\"    \"Tisn't likely that Acton----\"    \"Well, don't know,\" said Rogers, reflectively. \"He's lived so long in  France, where they shoot robins and nightingales, that he'll not know.\"    \"But Bourne would.\"    \"That's why he looks so blue. He does know, and it preys on his mind.\"    W.E. Grim's pathetic picture of young Bourne turned out-of-season poacher  against his will by an inexorable Acton didn't seem quite to fill the  bill.    \"Grimmy, you're an absolute idiot. That poachin' dodge won't do. Perhaps,  after all, they only bike round generally.\"    \"What about that cartridge?\" said Grim.    The little knot of cronies discussed the matter for a good half-hour,  Grim holding tenaciously to a poaching theory--pheasants or rabbits--the  others scouting the idea as next door to the absurd.    \"Look here,\" said Wilson, brilliantly, \"we'll track the pair to their  earth to-morrow. If they're after birds or bunnies I'll stand tea all  round at Hooper's.\"    \"All right,\" said Grim. \"I'd like to know about that cartridge.\"    On the morrow the suspicious band quietly trotted out after dinner from  St. Amory's, dressed ostensibly for a run down Westcote way. Once down  the hill they lay well out in the fields, keeping a sharp watch through  the hedges for their quarry. When they saw two well-known figures, feet  on the rest, coasting merrily down and head for Westcote, they all drew a  long breath and girded up their loins for the race.    \"With luck and the short cuts,\" said Grim, stepping out, \"we may just see  'em sneak into Pettigrew's woods.\"    \"And we've got a mile in hand too,\" said Wilson.    The cronies ran tightly together, nursing their wind and keeping well  screened from eyeshot from the road, not that either Acton, or Bourne  dreamed that their afternoon's run was being dogged by anyone. From their  numerous short cuts the scouts were necessarily out of view from the  road, but they marked the two cyclists from point to point and themselves  headed up hill and down dale straight for Westcote. They felt pretty well  winded by now, as they stood panting in a breezy spinney, watching for  the appearance of their quarry on the brown road beneath them.    \"There they are,\" gasped Wilson, pretty blown.    \"There's only one,\" said Rogers, \"and it is that young owl Bourne, too.  He's shed Acton.\"    \"Perhaps he's punctured,\" suggested Grim; \"anyhow, we hang on to Jack.\"    Rather puzzled at the non-appearance of Acton, they kept the first-comer  well in view as he pedalled hard for Westcote.    \"That's Jack right enough,\" said Rogers; \"and we'll have to leg it or  he'll slip us. Jove! he's captured a wheel with a vengeance. Hear it  hum.\"    The quartette strung down the hill full pelt, but when they got to the  bottom the cyclist was a good hundred yards ahead. His pursuers came to a  dead stop.    \"May as well go home now,\" said Grim, in great disgust. \"We can't dog him  now, and anyhow it isn't Pettigrew's pheasants that Jack's after: he's  gone past the woods. What a bone-shaker he's captured. Hear the spokes  rattlin'.\"    \"Not so quick, Grimmy. He's wheeling into that little Westcote inn. We'll  run him down now.\"    The rider had indeed dismounted nearly a quarter mile ahead, and  instantly the Amorians were stringing down the road again. Before the  door of the little inn they found a bicycle propped up drunkenly against  the wall, and the Amorians, pumped though they were, had breath enough  left to explode over Bourne's machine. It was a \"solid\" of  pre-diamond-frame days, guiltless of enamel or plating, and handle-bars  of width generous enough for a Dutch herring-boat's bow.    \"There's no false pride about Jack,\" said Grim, gloating over the weird  mount. \"Whatever is he doing in here?\"    \"Liquid refreshment,\" said Rogers between a gulp and a gasp. \"Oh, Jack,  was it for this and this that you gave us the go-by?\"    \"This place doesn't seem Jack's form somehow,\" said Wilson, looking  doubtfully up and down the little inn.    \"Ring him out, Wilson,\" said Grim. \"His little game's up now, and we can  rag him for an age over this.\"    \"Let's try his mount first, Grimmy.\" Rogers wheeled out the machine and,  after hopping twenty yards, \"found\" the saddle. To mount it was one  thing, to ride it was evidently a matter of liberal education beyond the  attainments of a junior Amorian,"]]]
