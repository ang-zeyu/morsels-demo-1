In so doing Anglesey was held by Ormonde to have censured  his conduct and that of Charles I. in concluding the \"Cessation,\" and  the duke brought the matter before the council. In 1682 he wrote _The  Account of Arthur, Earl of Anglesey ... of the true state of Your  Majesty's Government and Kingdom_, which was addressed to the king  in a tone of censure and remonstrance, but appears not to have been  printed till 1694.[5] In consequence he was dismissed on the 9th of  August 1682 from the office of lord privy seal. In 1683 he appeared  at the Old Bailey as a witness in defence of Lord Russell, and in June  1685 he protested alone against the revision of Stafford's attainder.  He died at his home at Blechingdon in Oxfordshire on the 26th of April  1686, closing a career marked by great ability, statesmanship and  business capacity, and by conspicuous courage and independence of  judgment. He amassed a large fortune in Ireland, in which country he  had been allotted lands by Cromwell.    The unfavourable character drawn of him by Burnet is certainly unjust  and not supported by any evidence. Pepys, a far more trustworthy  judge, speaks of him invariably in terms of respect and approval as a  \"grave, serious man,\" and commends his appointment as treasurer of  the navy as that of \"a very notable man and understanding and will do  things regular and understand them himself.\"[6] He was a learned and  cultivated man and collected a celebrated library, which was dispersed  at his death. Besides the pamphlets already mentioned, he wrote:--_A  True Account of the Whole Proceedings betwixt ... the Duke of Ormond  and ... the Earl of Anglesey_ (1682); _A Letter of Remarks upon  Jovian_ (1683); other works ascribed to him being _The King's Right of  Indulgence in Matters Spiritual ... asserted_ (1688); _Truth Unveiled,  to which is added a short Treatise on ... Transubstantiation_ (1676);  _The Obligation resulting from the Oath of Supremacy_ (1688);  and _England's Confusion_ (1659). _Memoirs_ of Lord Anglesey were  published by Sir P. Pett in 1693, but contain little biographical  information and were repudiated as a mere imposture by Sir John  Thompson (Lord Haversham), his son-in-law, in his preface to Lord  Anglesey's _State of the Government_ in 1694. The author however  of the preface to _The Rights of the Lords asserted_ (1702), while  blaming their publication as \"scattered and unfinished papers,\" admits  their genuineness.    Lord Anglesey married Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of Sir James  Altham of Oxey, Hertfordshire, by whom, besides other children, he had  James, who succeeded him, Altham, created Baron Altham, and Richard,  afterwards 3rd Baron Altham. His descendant Richard, the 6th earl  (d. 1761), left a son Arthur, whose legitimacy was doubted, and the  peerage became extinct. He was summoned to the Irish House of Peers as  Viscount Valentia, but was denied his writ to the parliament of Great  Britain by a majority of one vote. He was created in 1793 earl of  Mountnorris in the peerage of Ireland. All the male descendants of the  1st earl of Anglesey became extinct in the person of George, 2nd earl  of Mountnorris, in 1844, when the titles of Viscount Valentia and  Baron Mountnorris passed to his cousin Arthur Annesley (1785-1863),  who thus became 10th Viscount Valentia, being descended from the  1st Viscount Valentia the father of the 1st earl of Anglesey in the  Annesley family. The 1st viscount was also the ancestor of the Earls  Annesley in the Irish peerage.    [Footnote 1: _Protests of the Lords_, by J.E.

(P.C.Y.)        ANGLESEY, HENRY WILLIAM PAGET, 1st MARQUESS OF (1768-1854), British  field-marshal, was born on the 17th of May 1768. He was the eldest son  of Henry Paget, 1st earl of Uxbridge (d. 1812), and was educated at  Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, afterwards entering  parliament in 1790 as member for Carnarvon, for which he sat for six  years. At the outbreak of the French Revolutionary wars Lord Paget (as  he was then styled), who had already served in the militia, raised on  his father's estate the regiment of Staffordshire volunteers, in which  he was given the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel (1793). The  corps soon became part of the regular army as the 80th Foot, and it  took part, under Lord Paget's command, in the Flanders campaign of  1794. In spite of his youth he held a brigade command for a time, and  gained also, during the campaign, his first experience of the cavalry  arm, with which he was thenceforward associated. His substantive  commission as lieutenant-colonel of the 16th Light Dragoons bore the  date of the 15th of June 1795, and in 1796 he was made a colonel  in the army. In 1795 he married Lady Caroline Elizabeth Villiers,  daughter of the earl of Jersey. In April 1797 Lord Paget was  transferred to a lieut.-colonelcy in the 7th Light Dragoons, of which  regiment he became colonel in 1801. From the first he applied himself  strenuously to the improvement of discipline, and to the perfection of  a new system of cavalry evolutions. In the short campaign of 1799  in Holland, Paget commanded the cavalry brigade, and in spite of the  unsuitable character of the ground, he made, on several occasions,  brilliant and successful charges. After the return of the expedition,  he devoted himself zealously to his regiment, which under his command  became one of the best corps in the service. In 1802 he was promoted  major-general, and six years later lieutenant-general. In command of  the cavalry of Sir John Moore's army during the Corunna campaign, Lord  Paget won the greatest distinction. At Sahagun, Mayorga and Benavente,  the British cavalry behaved so well under his leadership that Moore  wrote:--\"It is impossible for me to say too much in its praise.... Our  cavalry is very superior in quality to any the French have, and the  right spirit has been infused into them by the example and instruction  of their ... leaders....\" At Benavente one of Napoleon's best cavalry  leaders, General Lefebvre Desnoettes, was taken prisoner. Corunna was  Paget's last service in the Peninsula. His _liaison_ with the wife of  Henry Wellesley, afterwards Lord Cowley, made it impossible at  that time for him to serve with Wellington, whose cavalry, on many  occasions during the succeeding campaigns, felt the want of the true  cavalry leader to direct them. His only war service from 1809 to  1815 was in the disastrous Walcheren expedition (1809) in which he  commanded a division. During these years he occupied himself with his  parliamentary duties as member for Milborne Port, which he represented  almost continuously up to his father's death in 1812, when he took  his seat in the House of Lords as earl of Uxbridge. In 1810 he was  divorced and married Mrs Wellesley, who had about the same time been  divorced from her husband. Lady Paget was soon afterwards married  to the duke of Argyll. In 1815 Lord Uxbridge received command of the  British cavalry in Flanders. At a moment of danger such as that of  Napoleon's return from Elba, the services of the best cavalry general  in the British army could not be neglected. Wellington placed the  greatest confidence in him, and on the eve of Waterloo extended his  command so as to include the whole of the allied cavalry and horse  artillery. He covered the retirement of the allies from Quatre Bras  to Waterloo on the 17th of June, and on the 18th gained the crowning  distinction of his military career in leading the great cavalry charge  of the British centre, which checked and in part routed D'Erlon's  _corps d'armee_ (see WATERLOO CAMPAIGN). Freely exposing his own life  throughout, the earl received, by one of the last cannon shots fired,  a severe wound in the leg, necessitating amputation. Five days later  the prince regent created him marquess of Anglesey in recognition of  his brilliant services, which were regarded universally as second only  to those of the duke himself. He was made a G.C.B. and he was also  decorated by many of the allied sovereigns.    [v.02 p.0017]    In 1818 the marquess was made a knight of the Garter, in 1819 he  became full general, and at the coronation of George IV. he acted as  lord high steward of England. His support of the proceedings against  Queen Caroline made him for a time unpopular, and when he was on one  occasion beset by a crowd, who compelled him to shout \"The Queen,\"  he added the wish, \"May all your wives be like her.\" At the close of  April 1827 he became a member of the Canning administration, taking  the post of master-general of the ordnance, previously held by  Wellington. He was at the same time sworn a member of the privy  council. Under the Wellington administration he accepted the  appointment of lord-lieutenant of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13602"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#15)"],[1,"runnin' through the pastur' and fust thing  I knowed, the overseer was roundin' up all the other niggers to git the  cows outen the cornfields! I knowed then my time had done come!\"    James was enjoying the spotlight now, and his audience did not have to  prompt him. Plantation recollections crowded together in his old mind.    \"We had one overseer at a time,\" he said, \"and he allus lived at the big  'ouse. The overseers warn't quality white folkses like our marster and  mistess but we never heard nuffin' 'bout no poor white trash in them  days, and effen we had heard sumpin' like that we'd have knowed better'n  to let Marster hear us make such talk! Marster made us call his overseer  'Mister.' We had one overseer named Mr. Andrew Smith and another time  we had a overseer named Mr. Pope Short. Overseers was jus' there on the  business of gettin' the work done--they seed atter everybody doin' his  wuk 'cordin' to order.    \"My employer--I means, my marster, never 'lowed no overseer to whup none  of his niggers! Marster done all the whuppin' on our plantation hisself.  He never did make no big bruises and he never drawed no blood, but he  sho' could burn 'em up with that lash! Niggers on our plantation was  whupped for laziness mostly. Next to that, whuppings was for stealin'  eggs and chickens. They fed us good and plenty but a nigger is jus'  bound to pick up chickens and eggs effen he kin, no matter how much he  done eat! He jus' can't help it. Effen a nigger ain't busy he gwine to  git into mischief!    \"Now and then slaves 'ud run away and go in the woods and dig dens and  live in 'em. Sometimes they runned away on 'count of cruel treatment,  but most of the time they runned away kazen they jus' didn't want to  wuk, and wanted to laze around for a spell. The marsters allus put the  dogs atter 'em and git 'em back. They had black and brown dogs called  'nigger hounds' what waren't used for nothin' but to track down niggers.    \"They waren't no such place as a jail whar we was. Effen a nigger done  sumpin' disorderly they jus' natcherly tuk a lash to 'im. I ain't never  seed no nigger in chains twel long atter freedom done come when I seed  'em on the chain gangs.    \"The overseer woke us up at sunrise--leas'n they called it sunrise! We  would finish our vittles and be in the fields ready for wuk befo' we  seed any sun! We laid off wuk at sunset and they didn't drive us hard.  Leas'wise, they didn' on our plantation. I done heard they was moughty  hard on 'em on other plantations. My marster never did 'low his niggers  to wuk atter sundown. My employer, I means my marster, didn't have no  bell. He had 'em blow bugles to wake up his hands and to call 'em from  the fields. Sometimes the overseer blowed it. Mistess done larned the  cook to count the clock, but none of the rest of our niggers could count  the clock.    \"I never knowed Marster to sell but one slave and he jus' had bought her  from the market at New Orleans. She say it lonesome off on the  plantation and axed Marster for to sell her to folkses livin' in town.  Atter he done sold her, every time he got to town she beg 'im to buy her  back! But he didn' pay her no more 'tention. When they had sales of  slaves on the plantations they let everybody know what time the sale  gwine to be. When the crowd git togedder they put the niggers on the  block and sell 'em. Leas'wise, they call it 'puttin' on the block'--they  jus' fotch 'em out and show 'em and sell 'em.    \"They waren't no church for niggers on our plantation and we went to  white folkses church and listened to the white preachers. We set behind  a partition. Sometimes on a plantation a nigger claim he done been  called to preach and effen he kin git his marster's cawn-sent he kin  preach round under trees and in cabins when t'aint wuk time. These  nigger preachers in slavery time was called 'chairbackers.' They waren't  no chairbackers 'lowed to baptize none of Marster's niggers. White  preachers done our baptizin' in Long Crick. When we went to be baptized  they allus sang, 'Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound!'\"    The old negro's quavery voice rose in the familiar song. For a moment he  sat thinking of those long-ago Sundays. His eyes brightened again, and  he went on:    \"We never done no wuk on Sundays on our plantation. The church was 'bout  nine miles from the plantation and we all walked there. Anybody too old  and feeble to walk the nine miles jus' stayed home, kazen Marster didn't  'low his mules used none on Sunday. All along the way niggers from other  plantations 'ud jine us and sometimes befo' we git to the church house  they'd be forty or fifty slaves comin' along the road in a crowd!  Preaching generally lasted twel bout three o'clock. In summertime we had  dinner on the ground at the church. Howsomever we didn' have no barbecue  like they does now. Everybody cooked enough on Sadday and fotched it in  baskets.    \"I was thirty years old when I jined the church. Nobody ought to jine no  church twels't he is truly borned of God, and effen he is truly borned  of God he gwine know it. Effen you want a restin' place atter you leaves  this old world you ought to git ready for it now!    \"When folkses on our plantation died Marster allus let many of us as  wanted to go, lay offen wuk twel atter the buryin'. Sometimes it were  two or three months atter the buryin' befo' the funeral sermon was  preached. Right now I can't rekelleck no song we sung at funerals cep'n  'Hark from the tombs a doleful sound.'\"    The reedy old voice carried the funeral hymn for a few minutes and then  trailed off. James was thinking back into the past again.    \"Spring plowin' and hoein' times we wukked all day Saddays, but mos'en  generally we laid off wuk at twelve o'clock Sadday. That was dinnertime.  Sadday nights we played and danced. Sometimes in the cabins, sometimes  in the yards. Effen we didn' have a big stack of fat kindling wood lit  up to dance by, sometimes the mens and 'omans would carry torches of  kindling wood whils't they danced and it sho' was a sight to see! We  danced the 'Turkey Trot' and 'Buzzard Lope', and how we did love to  dance the 'Mary Jane!' We would git in a ring and when the music started  we would begin wukkin' our footses while we sang 'You steal my true love  and I steal your'n!'    \"Atter supper we used to gether round and knock tin buckets and pans, we  beat 'em like drums. Some used they fingers and some used sticks for to  make the drum sounds and somebody allus blowed on quills. Quills was a  row of whistles made outen reeds, or sometimes they made 'em outen bark.  Every whistle in the row was a different tone and you could play any  kind of tune you wants effen you had a good row of quills. They sho' did  sound sweet!    \"'Bout the most fun we had was at corn shuckin's whar they put the corn  in long piles and called in the folkses from the plantations nigh round  to shuck it. Sometimes four or five hunnert head of niggers 'ud be  shuckin' corn at one time. When the corn all done been shucked they'd  drink the likker the marsters give 'em and then frolic and dance from  sundown to sunup. We started shuckin' corn 'bout dinnertime and tried to  finish by sundown so we could have the whole night for frolic. Some  years we 'ud go to ten or twelve corn shuckin's in one year!    \"We would sing and pray Easter Sunday and on Easter Monday we frolicked  and danced all day long! Christmas we allus had plenty good sumpin' to  eat and we all got togedder and had lots of fun. We runned up to the big  'ouse early Christmas mornin' and holler out: 'Mornin', Christmas Gif'!'  Then they'd give us plenty of Sandy Claus and we would go back to our  cabins to have fun twel New Year's day. We knowed Christmas was over and  gone when New Year's day come, kazen we got back to wuk that day atter  frolickin' all Christmas week.    \"We didn' know nuttin' 'bout games to play. We played with the white  folkses chilluns and watched atter 'em but most of the time we played in  the crick what runned through the pastur'. Nigger chilluns was allus  skeered to go in the woods atter dark. Folkses done told us  Raw-Head-and-Bloody Bones lived in the woods and git little chilluns and  eat 'em up effen they got out in the woods atter dark!    \"'Rockabye baby in the tree trops' was the onliest song I heard my maw  sing to git her babies to sleep. Slave folkses sung most all the time  but we didn' think of what we sang much. We jus' got happy and started  singin'. Sometimes we 'ud sing effen we felt sad and lowdown, but soon  as we could, we 'ud go off whar we could go to sleep and forgit all  'bout trouble!\" James nodded his gray head with a wise look in his  bright eyes. \"When you hear a nigger singin' sad songs hit's jus' kazen  he can't stop what he is doin' long enough to go to sleep!\"    The laughter that greeted this sally brought an answering grin to the  wrinkled old face. Asked about marriage customs, James said:    \"Folkses didn' make no big to-do over weddings like they do now. When  slaves got married they jus' laid down the broom on the floor and the  couple jined hands and jumped back-uds over the broomstick. I done seed  'em married that way many a time. Sometimes my marster would fetch  Mistess down to the slave quarters to see a weddin'. Effen the slaves  gittin' married was house servants, sometimes they married on the back  porch or in the back yard at the big 'ouse but plantation niggers what  was field hands married in they own cabins. The bride and groom jus'  wore plain clothes kazen they didn' have no more.    \"When the young marsters and mistesses at the big houses got married  they 'lowed the slaves to gadder on the porch and peep through the  windows at the weddin'. Mos'en generally they 'ud give the young couple  a slave or two to take with them to they new home. My marster's chilluns  was too young to git married befo' the war was over. They was seven of  them chilluns;"]]]
