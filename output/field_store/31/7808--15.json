[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1183"],[0,"The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (#15)"],[1,"do not hear from me, take  it back with you to the River Police Station.\"    \"Right you are, sir,\" said the man, remounting his seat. \"It's the first  time I ever saw a peacock in Limehouse!\"    It was the first time I had seen one, and the incident struck me as  being more than odd; it gave me an idea, and a new, faint hope. I  returned to the head of the steps, at the foot of which I had met with  this singular experience, and gazed up at the dark building beneath  which they led. Three windows were visible, but they were broken and  neglected. One, immediately above the arch, had been pasted up with  brown paper, and this was now peeling off in the rain, a little stream  of which trickled down from the detached corner to drop, drearily, upon  the stone stairs beneath.    Where were the detectives? I could only assume that they had directed  their attention elsewhere, for had the place not been utterly deserted,  surely I had been challenged.    In pursuit of my new idea, I again descended the steps. The persuasion  (shortly to be verified) that I was close upon the secret hold of the  Chinaman, grew stronger, unaccountably. I had descended some eight  steps, and was at the darkest part of the archway or tunnel, when  confirmation of my theories came to me.    A noose settled accurately upon my shoulders, was snatched tightly about  my throat, and with a feeling of insupportable agony at the base of  my skull, and a sudden supreme knowledge that I was being  strangled--hanged--I lost consciousness!    How long I remained unconscious, I was unable to determine at the time,  but I learned later, that it was for no more than half an hour; at any  rate, recovery was slow.    The first sensation to return to me was a sort of repetition of  the asphyxia. The blood seemed to be forcing itself into my eyes--I  choked--I felt that my end was come. And, raising my hands to my throat,  I found it to be swollen and inflamed. Then the floor upon which I lay  seemed to be rocking like the deck of a ship, and I glided back again  into a place of darkness and forgetfulness.    My second awakening was heralded by a returning sense of smell; for I  became conscious of a faint, exquisite perfume.    It brought me to my senses as nothing else could have done, and I sat  upright with a hoarse cry. I could have distinguished that perfume amid  a thousand others, could have marked it apart from the rest in a scent  bazaar. For me it had one meaning, and one meaning only--Karamaneh.    She was near to me, or had been near to me!    And in the first moments of my awakening, I groped about in the darkness  blindly seeking her.    Then my swollen throat and throbbing head, together with my utter  inability to move my neck even slightly, reminded me of the facts as  they were. I knew in that bitter moment that Karamaneh was no longer my  friend; but, for all her beauty and charm, was the most heartless, the  most fiendish creature in the service of Dr. Fu-Manchu. I groaned aloud  in my despair and misery.    Something stirred, near to me in the room, and set my nerves creeping  with a new apprehension. I became fully alive to the possibilities of  the darkness.    To my certain knowledge, Dr. Fu-Manchu at this time had been in England  for fully three months, which meant that by now he must be equipped with  all the instruments of destruction, animate and inanimate, which dread  experience had taught me to associate with him.    Now, as I crouched there in that dark apartment listening for a  repetition of the sound, I scarcely dared to conjecture what might have  occasioned it, but my imagination peopled the place with reptiles which  writhed upon the floor, with tarantulas and other deadly insects which  crept upon the walls, which might drop upon me from the ceiling at any  moment.    Then, since nothing stirred about me, I ventured to move, turning my  shoulders, for I was unable to move my aching head; and I looked in the  direction from which a faint, very faint, light proceeded.    A regular tapping sound now began to attract my attention, and, having  turned about, I perceived that behind me was a broken window, in places  patched with brown paper; the corner of one sheet of paper was detached,  and the rain trickled down upon it with a rhythmical sound.    In a flash I realized that I lay in the room immediately above the  archway; and listening intently, I perceived above the other faint  sounds of the night, or thought that I perceived, the hissing of the gas  from the extinguished lamp-burner.    Unsteadily I rose to my feet, but found myself swaying like a drunken  man. I reached out for support, stumbling in the direction of the wall.  My foot came in contact with something that lay there, and I pitched  forward and fell....    I anticipated a crash which would put an end to my hopes of escape, but  my fall was comparatively noiseless--for I fell upon the body of a man  who lay bound up with rope close against the wall!    A moment I stayed as I fell, the chest of my fellow captive rising and  falling beneath me as he breathed. Knowing that my life depended  upon retaining a firm hold upon myself, I succeeded in overcoming the  dizziness and nausea which threatened to drown my senses, and, moving  back so that I knelt upon the floor, I fumbled in my pocket for the  electric lamp which I had placed there. My raincoat had been removed  whilst I was unconscious, and with it my pistol, but the lamp was  untouched.    I took it out, pressed the button, and directed the ray upon the face of  the man beside me.    It was Nayland Smith!    Trussed up and fastened to a ring in the wall he lay, having a cork gag  strapped so tightly between his teeth that I wondered how he had escaped  suffocation.    But, although a grayish pallor showed through the tan of his skin, his  eyes were feverishly bright, and there, as I knelt beside him, I thanked  heaven, silently but fervently.    Then, in furious haste, I set to work to remove the gag. It was most  ingeniously secured by means of leather straps buckled at the back of  his head, but I unfastened these without much difficulty, and he spat  out the gag, uttering an exclamation of disgust.    \"Thank God, old man!\" he said, huskily. \"Thank God that you are alive! I  saw them drag you in, and I thought...\"    \"I have been thinking the same about you for more than twenty-four  hours,\" I said, reproachfully. \"Why did you start without--\"    \"I did not want you to come, Petrie,\" he replied. \"I had a sort of  premonition. You see it was realized; and instead of being as helpless  as I, Fate has made you the instrument of my release. Quick! You have a  knife? Good!\" The old, feverish energy was by no means extinguished  in him. \"Cut the ropes about my wrists and ankles, but don't otherwise  disturb them--\"    I set to work eagerly.    \"Now,\" Smith continued, \"put that filthy gag in place again--but you  need not strap it so tightly! Directly they find that you are alive,  they will treat you the same--you understand? She has been here three  times--\"    \"Karamaneh?\"...    \"Ssh!\"    I heard a sound like the opening of a distant door.    \"Quick! the straps of the gag!\" whispered Smith, \"and pretend to recover  consciousness just as they enter--\"    Clumsily I followed his directions, for my fingers were none too steady,  replaced the lamp in my pocket, and threw myself upon the floor.    Through half-shut eyes, I saw the door open and obtained a glimpse of  a desolate, empty passage beyond. On the threshold stood Karamaneh. She  held in her hand a common tin oil lamp which smoked and flickered with  every movement, filling the already none too cleanly air with an odor of  burning paraffin. She personified the outre; nothing so incongruous as  her presence in that place could well be imagined. She was dressed as I  remembered once to have seen her two years before, in the gauzy silks of  the harem. There were pearls glittering like great tears amid the cloud  of her wonderful hair. She wore broad gold bangles upon her bare arms,  and her fingers were laden with jewelry. A heavy girdle swung from her  hips, defining the lines of her slim shape, and about one white ankle  was a gold band.    As she appeared in the doorway I almost entirely closed my eyes, but my  gaze rested fascinatedly upon the little red slippers which she wore.    Again I detected the exquisite, elusive perfume, which, like a breath  of musk, spoke of the Orient; and, as always, it played havoc with my  reason, seeming to intoxicate me as though it were the very essence of  her loveliness.    But I had a part to play, and throwing out one clenched hand so that my  fist struck upon the floor, I uttered a loud groan, and made as if to  rise upon my knees.    One quick glimpse I had of her wonderful eyes, widely opened and turned  upon me with such an enigmatical expression as set my heart leaping  wildly--then, stepping back, Karamaneh placed the lamp upon the boards  of the passage and clapped her hands.    As I sank upon the floor in assumed exhaustion, a Chinaman with  a perfectly impassive face, and a Burman, whose pock-marked, evil  countenance was set in an apparently habitual leer, came running into  the room past the girl.    With a hand which trembled violently, she held the lamp whilst the two  yellow ruffians tied me. I groaned and struggled feebly, fixing my gaze  upon the lamp-bearer in a silent reproach which was by no means without  its effect.    She lowered her eyes, and I could see her biting her lip, whilst the  color gradually faded from her cheeks. Then, glancing up again quickly,  and still meeting that reproachful stare, she turned her head aside  altogether, and rested one hand upon the wall, swaying slightly as she  did so.    It was a singular ordeal for more than one of that incongruous group;  but in order that I may not be charged with hypocrisy or with seeking  to hide my own folly, I confess,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],[0,"The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#15)"],[1,"it--I do see it. It's very dim and  broken in places, but I see it all the same, like a faint spectre of  itself. I found it out this morning while they were dressing me. It's like  a hole in this infernal phantom world. Just put your hand by mine. No--not  there. Ah! Yes! I see it. The base of your thumb and a bit of cuff! It  looks like the ghost of a bit of your hand sticking out of the darkling  sky. Just by it there's a group of stars like a cross coming out.\"    From that time Davidson began to mend. His account of the change, like his  account of the vision, was oddly convincing. Over patches of his field of  vision, the phantom world grew fainter, grew transparent, as it were, and  through these translucent gaps he began to see dimly the real world about  him. The patches grew in size and number, ran together and spread until  only here and there were blind spots left upon his eyes. He was able to  get up and steer himself about, feed himself once more, read, smoke, and  behave like an ordinary citizen again. At first it was very confusing to  him to have these two pictures overlapping each other like the changing  views of a lantern, but in a little while he began to distinguish the real  from the illusory.    At first he was unfeignedly glad, and seemed only too anxious to complete  his cure by taking exercise and tonics. But as that odd island of his  began to fade away from him, he became queerly interested in it. He wanted  particularly to go down into the deep sea again, and would spend half his  time wandering about the low-lying parts of London, trying to find the  water-logged wreck he had seen drifting. The glare of real daylight very  soon impressed him so vividly as to blot out everything of his shadowy  world, but of a night-time, in a darkened room, he could still see the  white-splashed rocks of the island, and the clumsy penguins staggering to  and fro. But even these grew fainter and fainter, and, at last, soon after  he married my sister, he saw them for the last time.      V.    And now to tell of the queerest thing of all. About two years after his  cure I dined with the Davidsons, and after dinner a man named Atkins  called in. He is a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and a pleasant, talkative  man. He was on friendly terms with my brother-in-law, and was soon on  friendly terms with me. It came out that he was engaged to Davidson's  cousin, and incidentally he took out a kind of pocket photograph case to  show us a new rendering of his _fiancee_. \"And, by-the-by,\" said he,  \"here's the old _Fulmar_.\"    Davidson looked at it casually. Then suddenly his face lit up. \"Good  heavens!\" said he. \"I could almost swear----\"    \"What?\" said Atkins.    \"That I had seen that ship before.\"    \"Don't see how you can have. She hasn't been out of the South Seas for six  years, and before then----\"    \"But,\" began Davidson, and then, \"Yes--that's the ship I dreamt of; I'm  sure that's the ship I dreamt of. She was standing off an island that  swarmed with penguins, and she fired a gun.\"    \"Good Lord!\" said Atkins, who had now heard the particulars of the  seizure. \"How the deuce could you dream that?\"    And then, bit by bit, it came out that on the very day Davidson was  seized, H.M.S. _Fulmar_ had actually been off a little rock to the  south of Antipodes Island. A boat had landed overnight to get penguins'  eggs, had been delayed, and a thunderstorm drifting up, the boat's crew  had waited until the morning before rejoining the ship. Atkins had been  one of them, and he corroborated, word for word, the descriptions Davidson  had given of the island and the boat. There is not the slightest doubt in  any of our minds that Davidson has really seen the place. In some  unaccountable way, while he moved hither and thither in London, his sight  moved hither and thither in a manner that corresponded, about this distant  island. _How_ is absolutely a mystery.    That completes the remarkable story of Davidson's eyes. It's perhaps the  best authenticated case in existence of real vision at a distance.  Explanation there is none forthcoming, except what Professor Wade has  thrown out. But his explanation invokes the Fourth Dimension, and a  dissertation on theoretical kinds of space. To talk of there being \"a kink  in space\" seems mere nonsense to me; it may be because I am no  mathematician. When I said that nothing would alter the fact that the  place is eight thousand miles away, he answered that two points might be a  yard away on a sheet of paper, and yet be brought together by bending the  paper round. The reader may grasp his argument, but I certainly do not.  His idea seems to be that Davidson, stooping between the poles of the big  electro-magnet, had some extraordinary twist given to his retinal elements  through the sudden change in the field of force due to the lightning.    He thinks, as a consequence of this, that it may be possible to live  visually in one part of the world, while one lives bodily in another. He  has even made some experiments in support of his views; but, so far, he  has simply succeeded in blinding a few dogs. I believe that is the net  result of his work, though I have not seen him for some weeks. Latterly I  have been so busy with my work in connection with the Saint Pancras  installation that I have had little opportunity of calling to see him. But  the whole of his theory seems fantastic to me. The facts concerning  Davidson stand on an altogether different footing, and I can testify  personally to the accuracy of every detail I have given.            VIII.      THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS.      The chief attendant of the three dynamos that buzzed and rattled at  Camberwell, and kept the electric railway going, came out of Yorkshire,  and his name was James Holroyd. He was a practical electrician, but fond  of whisky, a heavy, red-haired brute with irregular teeth. He doubted the  existence of the Deity, but accepted Carnot's cycle, and he had read  Shakespeare and found him weak in chemistry. His helper came out of the  mysterious East, and his name was Azuma-zi. But Holroyd called him  Pooh-bah. Holroyd liked a nigger help because he would stand kicking--a  habit with Holroyd--and did not pry into the machinery and try to learn  the ways of it. Certain odd possibilities of the negro mind brought into  abrupt contact with the crown of our civilisation Holroyd never fully  realised, though just at the end he got some inkling of them.    To define Azuma-zi was beyond ethnology. He was, perhaps, more negroid  than anything else, though his hair was curly rather than frizzy, and his  nose had a bridge. Moreover, his skin was brown rather than black, and the  whites of his eyes were yellow. His broad cheekbones and narrow chin gave  his face something of the viperine V. His head, too, was broad behind, and  low and narrow at the forehead, as if his brain had been twisted round in  the reverse way to a European's. He was short of stature and still shorter  of English. In conversation he made numerous odd noises of no known  marketable value, and his infrequent words were carved and wrought into  heraldic grotesqueness. Holroyd tried to elucidate his religious beliefs,  and--especially after whisky--lectured to him against superstition and  missionaries. Azuma-zi, however, shirked the discussion of his gods, even  though he was kicked for it.    Azuma-zi had come, clad in white but insufficient raiment, out of the  stoke-hole of the _Lord Clive_, from the Straits Settlements and  beyond, into London. He had heard even in his youth of the greatness and  riches of London, where all the women are white and fair, and even the  beggars in the streets are white, and he had arrived, with newly-earned  gold coins in his pocket, to worship at the shrine of civilisation. The  day of his landing was a dismal one; the sky was dun, and a wind-worried  drizzle filtered down to the greasy streets, but he plunged boldly into  the delights of Shadwell, and was presently cast up, shattered in health,  civilised in costume, penniless, and, except in matters of the direst  necessity, practically a dumb animal, to toil for James Holroyd, and to be  bullied by him in the dynamo shed at Camberwell. And to James Holroyd  bullying was a labour of love.    There were three dynamos with their engines at Camberwell. The two that  have been there since the beginning are small machines; the larger one was  new. The smaller machines made a reasonable noise; their straps hummed  over the drums, every now and then the brushes buzzed and fizzled, and the  air churned steadily, whoo! whoo! whoo! between their poles. One was loose  in its foundations and kept the shed vibrating. But the big dynamo drowned  these little noises altogether with the sustained drone of its iron core,  which somehow set part of the ironwork humming. The place made the  visitor's head reel with the throb, throb, throb of the engines, the  rotation of the big wheels, the spinning ball-valves, the occasional  spittings of the steam, and over all the deep, unceasing, surging note of  the big dynamo. This last noise was from an engineering point of view a  defect, but Azuma-zi accounted it unto the monster for mightiness and  pride.    If it were possible we would have the noises of that shed always about the  reader as he reads, we would tell all our story to such an accompaniment.  It was a steady stream of din, from which the ear picked out first one  thread and then another; there was the intermittent snorting, panting, and  seething of the steam engines, the suck and thud of their pistons, the  dull beat on the air as the spokes of the great driving wheels came round,  a note the leather straps made as they ran tighter and looser, and a  fretful tumult from the dynamos; and, over all, sometimes inaudible, as  the ear tired of it, and then creeping back upon the senses again, was  this trombone note of the big machine.
