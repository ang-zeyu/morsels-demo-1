Today we have come up with this:       100% American Fondue    2 cups scalded milk  2 cups stale bread crumbs  1/2 teaspoon dry English mustard  Salt  Dash of nutmeg  Dash of pepper  2 cups American cheese (Cheddar)  2 egg yolks, well beaten  2 egg whites, beaten stiff         Soak crumbs in milk, season and stir in the cheese until melted.       Add the beaten egg yolks and stir until you have a smooth       mixture. Let this cool while beating the whites stiff, leaving       them slightly moist. Fold the whites into the cool, custardy mix       and bake in a buttered dish until firm. (About 50 minutes in a       moderate oven.)    This is more of a baked cheese job than a true Fondue, to our way of  thinking, and the scalded milk doesn't exactly take the place of the  wine or kirsch. It is characteristic of our bland cookery.      OTHER FONDUES PLAIN AND FANCY, BAKED AND NOT       Quickie Catsup Tummy Fondiddy    3/4 pound sharp cheese, diced  1 can condensed tomato soup  1/2 cup catsup  1/2 teaspoon mustard  1 egg, lightly beaten         In double boiler melt cheese in soup. Blend thoroughly by       constant stirring. Remove from heat, lightly whip or fold in the       catsup and mustard mixed with egg. Serve on Melba toast or rusks.    This might be suggested as a novel midnight snack, with a cup of  cocoa, for a change.       Cheese and Rice Fondue    1 cup cooked rice  2 cups milk  4 eggs, separated and well beaten  1/2 cup grated cheese  1/2 teaspoon salt  Cayenne, Worcestershire sauce or tabasco sauce, or all three         Heat rice (instead of bread crumbs) in milk, stir in cheese until       melted, add egg yolks beaten lemon-yellow, season, fold in stiff       egg whites. Serve hot on toast.     Corn and Cheese Fondue    1 cup bread crumbs  1 large can creamed corn  1 small onion, chopped  1/2 green pepper, chopped  2 cups cottage cheese  1/2 teaspoon salt  1/2 cup milk  2 eggs, well beaten         Mix all ingredients together and bake in buttered casserole set       in pan of hot water. Bake about 1 hour in moderate oven, or until       set.       Cheese Fondue    1 cup grated Cheddar  1/2 cup crumbled Roquefort  1 cup pimento cheese  3 tablespoons cream  3 tablespoons butter  1 teaspoon Worcestershire         Stir everything together over hot water until smooth and creamy.       Then whisk until fluffy, moistening with more cream or mayonnaise       if too stiff.         Serve on Melba toast, or assorted thin toasted crackers.       Brick Fondue    1/2 cup butter  2 cups grated Brick cheese  1/2 cup warm milk  1/2 teaspoon salt  2 eggs         Melt butter and cheese together, use wire whisk to whip in the       warm milk. Season. Take from fire and beat in the eggs, one at a       time. Please note that Fondue protocol calls for each egg to be       beaten separately in cases like this.         Serve over hot toast or crackers.     Cheddar Dunk Bowl    3/4 pound sharp Cheddar cheese  3 tablespoons cream  2/3 teaspoon dry mustard  1-1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire         Grate the cheese powdery fine and mash it together with the cream       until fluffy. Season and serve in a beautiful bowl for dunking in       the original style of Savarin, although this is a static       imitation of the real thing.         All kinds of crackers and colorful dips can be used, from celery       stalks and potato chips to thin paddles cut from Bombay duck.          [Illustration]    _Chapter Seven_    Souffles, Puffs and Ramekins      There isn't much difference between Cheese Souffles, Puffs and  Ramekins. The _English Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery_, the oldest,  biggest and best of such works in English, lumps Cheese Puffs and  Ramekins together, giving the same recipes for both, although it  treats each extensively under its own name when not made with cheese.    Cheese was the basis of the original French Ramequin, cheese and bread  crumbs or puff paste, baked in a mold, (with puff again the principal  factor in Souffle, from the French _souffler_, puff up).     Basic Souffle    3 tablespoons butter or margarine  4 tablespoons flour  1-1/4 cups hot milk, scalded  1 teaspoon salt  A dash of cayenne  1/2 cup grated Cheddar cheese, sharp  2 egg yolks, beaten lemon-yellow  2 egg whites, beaten stiff         Melt butter, stir in flour and milk gradually until thick and       smooth. Season and add the cheese, continuing the cooking and       slow stirring until velvety. Remove from heat and let cool       somewhat; then stir in the egg yolks with a light hand and an       upward motion. Fold in the stiff whites and when evenly mixed       pour into a big, round baking dish. (Some butter it and some       don't.) To make sure the top will be even when baked, run a spoon       or knife around the surface, about 1 inch from the edge of the       dish, before baking slowly in a moderate oven until puffed high       and beautifully browned. Serve instantly for fear the Souffle may       fall. The baking takes up to an hour and the egg whites shouldn't       be beaten so stiff they are hard to fold in and contain no air to       expand and puff up the dish.    To perk up the seasonings, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice,  nutmeg and even garlic are often used to taste, especially in England.    While Cheddar is the preferred cheese, Parmesan runs it a close  second. Then comes Swiss. You may use any two or all three of these  together. Sometimes Roquefort is added, as in the Ramekin recipes  below.       Parmesan Souffle         Make the same as Basic Souffle, with these small modifications in       the ingredients:    1 full cup of grated Parmesan  1 extra egg in place of the 1/2 cup of  Cheddar cheese  A little more butter  Black pepper, not cayenne       Swiss Souffle         Make the same as Basic Souffle, with these slight changes:    1-1/4 cups grated Swiss cheese instead of the Cheddar cheese  Nutmeg in place of the cayenne       Parmesan-Swiss Souffle         Make the same as Basic Souffle, with these little differences:    1/2 cup grated Swiss cheese, and 1/2 cup grated Parmesan in place of  the Cheddar cheese  1/4 teaspoon each of sugar and black pepper for seasoning.    Any of these makes a light, lovely luncheon or a proper climax to a  grand dinner.       Cheese-Corn Souffle         Make as Basic Souffle, substituting for the scalded milk 1 cup of       sieved and strained juice from cream-style canned corn.       Cheese-Spinach Souffle         Saute 1-1/2 cups of finely chopped, drained spinach in butter       with 1 teaspoon finely grated onion, and then whip it until light       and fluffy. Mix well into the white sauce of the Basic Souffle       before adding the cheese and following the rest of the recipe.       Cheese-Tomato Souffle         Substitute hot tomato juice for the scalded milk.       Cheese-Sea-food Souffle         Add 1-1/2 cups finely chopped or ground lobster, crab, shrimp,       other sea food or mixture thereof, with any preferred seasoning       added.       Cheese-Mushroom Souffle    1-1/2 cups grated sharp Cheddar  1 cup cream of mushroom soup  Paprika, to taste  Salt  2 egg yolks, well beaten  2 egg whites, beaten stiff  2 tablespoons chopped, cooked bacon  2 tablespoons sliced, blanched almonds         Heat cheese with soup and paprika, adding the cheese gradually       and stirring until smooth. Add salt and thicken the sauce with       egg yolks, still stirring steadily, and finally fold in the       whites. Sprinkle with bacon and almonds and bake until golden       brown and puffed high (about 1 hour).       Cheese-Potato Souffle (Potato Puff)    6 potatoes  2 onions  1 tablespoon butter or margarine  1 cup hot milk  3/4 cup grated Cheddar cheese  1 teaspoon salt  A dash of pepper  2 egg yolks, well beaten  2 egg whites, beaten stiff  1/4 cup grated Cheddar cheese         Cook potatoes and onions together until tender and put through a       ricer. Mix with all the other ingredients except the egg whites       and the Cheddar. Fold in the egg whites, mix thoroughly and pour       into a buttered baking dish. Sprinkle the 1/4 cup of Cheddar on       top and bake in moderate oven about 1/2 hour, until golden-brown       and well puffed. Serve instantly.         Variations of this popular Souffle leave out the onion and       simplify matters by using 2 cups of mashed potatoes. Sometimes 1       tablespoon of catsup and another of minced parsley is added to       the mixture. Or onion juice alone, to take the place of the       cooked onions--about a tablespoon, full or scant.    The English, in concocting such a Potato Puff or Souffle, are inclined  to make it extra peppery, as they do most of their Cheese Souffles,  with not only \"a dust of black pepper\" but \"as much cayenne as may be  stood on the face of a sixpence.\"       Cheese Fritter Souffles         These combine ham with Parmesan cheese and are even more       delicately handled in the making than crepes suzette.      PUFFS       Three-in-One Puffs    1 cup grated Swiss  1 cup grated Parmesan  1 cup cream cheese  5 eggs, lightly beaten  salt and pepper         Mix the cheeses into one mass moistened with the beaten eggs,       splashed on at intervals. When thoroughly incorporated, put in       ramekins, tiny tins, cups, or any sort of little mold of any       shape. Bake in hot oven about 10 minutes, until richly browned.    Such miniature Souffles serve as liaison officers for this entire  section, since they are baked in ramekins, or ramequins, from the  French word for the small baking dish that holds only one portion.  These may be paper boxes, usually round, earthenware, china, Pyrex,  of any attractive shape in which to bake or serve the Puffs.    More commonly, in America at least, Puffs are made without ramekin  dishes, as follows:       Fried Puffs    2 egg whites, beaten stiff"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14297"],[0,"The Congo and Coasts of Africa (#15)"],[1,"the sixty yards. But when we reached the stream there was  nothing visible but the trampled grass and great holes in the mud  and near us in the misty moonlight river something that puffed and  blew slowly and luxuriously, as would any fat gentleman who had been  forced to run for it. Had I followed Anfossi's judgment and gone  along the bank sixty yards ahead, instead of sixty yards astern of  the _Deliverance_, at the exact moment at which I sank into my deck  chair, the hippo would have emerged at my feet. It is even betting  as to which of us would have been the more scared.    The next day, and for days after, we saw nothing but hippos. We saw  them floating singly and in family groups, with generally four or  five cows to one bull, and sometimes in front a baby hippo no larger  than a calf, which the mother with her great bulk would push against  the swift current, as you see a tugboat in the lee of a great liner.  Once, what I thought was a spit of rocks suddenly tumbled apart and  became twenty hippos, piled more or less on top of each other.  During that one day, as they floated with the current, enjoying  their afternoon's nap, we saw thirty-four. They impressed me as the  most idle, and, therefore, the most aristocratic of animals. They  toil not, neither do they spin; they had nothing to do but float in  the warm water and the bright sunshine; their only effort was to  open their enormous jaws and yawn luxuriously, in the pure content  of living, in absolute boredom. They reminded you only of fat gouty  old gentlemen, puffing and blowing in the pool at the Warm Springs.    The next chance we had at one of them on shore came on our first  evening in the Kasai just before sunset. Captain Jensen was steering  for a flat island of sand and grass where he meant to tie up for the  night. About fifty yards from the spot for which we were making, was  the only tree on the island, and under it with his back to us, and  leisurely eating the leaves of the lower branches, exactly as though  he were waiting for us by appointment, was a big gray hippo. His  back being toward us, we could not aim at his head, and he could not  see us. But the _Deliverance_ is not noiseless, and, hearing the  paddle-wheel, the hippo turned, saw us, and bolted for the river.  The hippopotamus is as much at home in the water as the seal. To get  to the water, if he is surprised out of it, and to get under it, if  he is alarmed while in it, is instinct. If he does venture ashore,  he goes only a few rods from the bank and then only to forage. His  home is the river, and he rushes to bury himself in it as naturally  as the squirrel makes for a tree. This particular hippo ran for the  river as fast as a horse coming at a slow trot. He was a very badly  scared hippo. His head was high in the air, his fat sides were  shaking, and the one little eye turned toward us was filled with  concern. Behind him the yellow sun was setting into the lagoons. On  the flat stretch of sand he was the only object, and against the  horizon loomed as large as a freight car. That must be why we both  missed him. I tried to explain that the reason I missed him was  that, never before having seen so large an animal running for his  life, I could not watch him do it and look at the gun sights. No one  believed that was why I missed him. I did not believe it myself. In  any event neither of us hit his head, and he plunged down the bank  to freedom, carrying most of the bank with him. But, while we still  were violently blaming each other, at about two hundred yards below  the boat, he again waddled out of the river and waded knee deep up  the little stream. Keeping the bunches of grass between us, I ran up  the beach, aimed at his eye and this time hit him fairly enough.  With a snort he rose high in the air, and so, for an instant,  balanced his enormous bulk. The action was like that of a horse  that rears on his hind legs, when he is whipped over the nose. And  apparently my bullet hurt him no more than the whip the horse, for  he dropped heavily to all fours, and again disappeared into the  muddy river. Our disappointment and chagrin were intense, and at  once Anfossi and I organized a hunt for that evening. To encourage  us, while we were sitting on the bridge making a hasty dinner,  another hippopotamus had the impertinence to rise, blowing like a  whale, not ten feet from where we sat. We could have thrown our tin  cups and hit him; but he was in the water, and now we were seeking  only those on land.     [Illustration: Mr. Davis and Native \"Boy,\" on the Kasai River.]    Two years ago when the atrocities along the Kasai made the natives  fear the white man and the white man fear the natives, each of the  river boats was furnished with a stand of Albini rifles. Three of  the black soldiers, who were keen sportsmen, were served with these  muskets, and as soon as the moon rose, the soldiers and Anfossi, my  black boy, with an extra gun, and I set forth to clear the island of  hippos. To the stranger it was a most curious hunt. The island was  perfectly flat and bare, and the river had eaten into it and  overflowed it with tiny rivulets and deep, swift-running streams.  Into these rivulets and streams the soldiers plunged, one in front,  feeling the depth of the water with a sounding rod, and as he led we  followed. The black men made a splendid picture. They were naked but  for breech-cloths, and the moonlight flashed on their wet skins and  upon the polished barrels of the muskets. But, as a sporting  proposition, as far as I could see, we had taken on the hippopotamus  at his own game. We were supposed to be on an island, but the water  was up to our belts and running at five miles an hour. I could not  understand why we had not openly and aboveboard walked into the  river. Wading waist high in the water with a salmon rod I could  understand, but not swimming around in a river with a gun. The force  of the shallowest stream was the force of the great river behind it,  and wherever you put your foot, the current, on its race to the sea,  annoyed at the impediment, washed the sand from under the sole of  your foot and tugged at your knees and ankles. To add to the  interest the three soldiers held their muskets at full cock, and as  they staggered for a footing each pointed his gun at me. There also  was a strange fish about the size of an English sole that sprang out  of the water and hurled himself through space. Each had a white  belly, and as they skimmed past us in the moonlight it was as though  some one was throwing dinner plates. After we had swum the length of  the English Channel, we returned to the boat. As to that midnight  hunt I am still uncertain as to whether we were hunting the hippos  or the hippos were hunting us.    The next morning we had our third and last chance at a hippo.    It is distinctly a hard-luck story. We had just gone on the bridge  for breakfast when we saw him walking slowly from us along an island  of white sand as flat as your hand, and on which he loomed large as  a haystack. Captain Jensen was a true sportsman. He jerked the bell  to the engine-room, and at full speed the _Deliverance_ raced for  the shore. The hippo heard us, and, like a baseball player caught  off base, tried to get back to the river. Captain Jensen danced on  the deck plates:    \"Schoot it! schoot it!\" he yelled, \"Gotfurdamn! schoot it!\" When  Anfossi and I fired, the _Deliverance_ was a hundred yards from the  hippo, and the hippo was not five feet from the bank. In another  instant, he would have been over it and safe. But when we fired, he  went down as suddenly as though a safe had dropped on him. Except  that he raised his head, and rolled it from side to side, he  remained perfectly still. From his actions, or lack of actions, it  looked as though one of the bullets had broken his back; and when  the blacks saw he could not move they leaped and danced and  shrieked. To them the death of the big beast promised much chop.    But Captain Jensen was not so confident. \"Schoot it,\" he continued  to shout, \"we lose him yet! Gotfurdamn! schoot it!\"    My gun was an American magazine rifle, holding five cartridges. We  now were very near the hippo, and I shot him in the head twice, and,  once, when he opened them, in the jaws. At each shot his head would  jerk with a quick toss of pain, and at the sight the blacks screamed  with delight that was primitively savage. After the last shot, when  Captain Jensen had brought the _Deliverance_ broadside to the bank,  the hippo ceased to move. The boat had not reached the shore before  the boys with the steel hawser were in the water; the gangplank was  run out, and the black soldiers and wood boys, with their knives,  were dancing about the hippo and hacking at his tail. Their idea was  to make him the more quickly bleed to death. I ran to the cabin for  more cartridges. It seemed an absurd precaution. I was as sure I had  the head of that hippo as I was sure that my own was still on my  neck. My only difficulty was whether to hang the head in the front  hall or in the dining-room. It might be rather too large for the  dining-room. That was all that troubled me. After three minutes,  when I was back on deck, the hippo still lay immovable. Certainly  twenty men were standing about him; three were sawing off his tail,  and the women were chanting triumphantly a song they used to sing in  the days when the men were allowed to hunt, and had returned  successful with food.    On the bridge was Anfossi with his camera. Before the men had  surrounded the hippo he had had time to snap one picture of it. I  had just started after my camera, when from the blacks there was a  yell of alarm, of rage, and amazement. The hippo had opened his  eyes and raised his head. I shoved the boys out of the way, and,  putting the gun close to his head, fired pointblank. I wanted to put  him out of pain. I need not have"]]]
