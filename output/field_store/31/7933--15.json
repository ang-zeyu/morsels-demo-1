To them, therefore,  they addressed themselves in all difficult cases: yet could not all that  desired that dignity, as they esteemed it, obtain familiarity with the  infernal spirits. Nor were all powahs alike successful in their  addresses; but they became such, either by immediate revelation, or in  the use of certain rites and ceremonies, which tradition had left as  conducing to that end. In so much, that parents, out of zeal, often  dedicated their children to the gods, and educated them accordingly,  observing a certain diet, debarring sleep, &c.: yet of the many  designed, but few obtained their desire. Supposing that where the  practice of witchcraft has been highly esteemed, there must be given the  plainest demonstration of mortals having familiarity with infernal  spirits, I am willing to let my reader know, that, not many years since,  here died one of the powahs, who never pretended to astrological  knowledge, yet could precisely inform such who desired his assistance,  from whence goods stolen from them were gone, and whither carried, with  many things of the like nature; nor was he ever known to endeavour to  conceal his knowledge to be immediately _from a god subservient to him  that the English worship_. This powah, being by an Englishman worthy of  credit (who lately informed me of the same), desired to advise him who  had taken certain goods which had been stolen, having formerly been an  eye-witness of his ability, the powah, after a little pausing, demanded  why he requested that from him, since himself served another God? that  therefore he could not help him; but added, '_If you can believe that my  god may help you, I will try what I can do_; which diverted the man from  further enquiry. I must a little digress, and tell my reader, that this  powah's wife was accounted a godly woman, and lived in the practice and  profession of the Christian religion, not only by the approbation, but  encouragement of her husband. She constantly prayed in the family, and  attended the public worship on the Lord's days. He declared that he  could not blame her, for that she served a god that was above his; but  that as to himself, his god's continued kindness obliged him not to  forsake his service.\" It appears, from the above and similar passages,  that Dr. Cotton Mather, an honest and devout, but sufficiently credulous  man, had mistaken the purpose of the tolerant powah. The latter only  desired to elude the necessity of his practices being brought under the  observant eye of an European, while he found an ingenious apology in the  admitted superiority which he naturally conceded to the Deity of a  people, advanced, as he might well conceive, so far above his own in  power and attainments, as might reasonably infer a corresponding  superiority in the nature and objects of their worship.    [Footnote 6: \"On Remarkable Mercies of Divine Providence.\"]    From another narrative we are entitled to infer that the European wizard  was held superior to the native sorcerer of North America. Among the  numberless extravagances of the Scottish Dissenters of the 17th century,  now canonized in a lump by those who view them in the general light of  enemies to Prelacy, was a certain ship-master, called, from his size,  Meikle John Gibb. This man, a person called Jamie, and one or two other  men, besides twenty or thirty females who adhered to them, went the  wildest lengths of enthusiasm. Gibb headed a party, who followed him  into the moorlands, and at the Ford Moss, between Airth and Stirling,  burned their Bibles, as an act of solemn adherence to their new faith.  They were apprehended in consequence, and committed to prison; and the  rest of the Dissenters, however differently they were affected by the  persecution of Government, when it applied to themselves, were  nevertheless much offended that these poor mad people were not brought  to capital punishment for their blasphemous extravagances; and imputed  it as a fresh crime to the Duke of York that, though he could not be  often accused of toleration, he considered the discipline of the house  of correction as more likely to bring the unfortunate Gibbites to their  senses than the more dignified severities of a public trial and the  gallows. The Cameronians, however, did their best to correct this  scandalous lenity. As Meikle John Gibb, who was their comrade in  captivity, used to disturb their worship in jail by his maniac howling,  two of them took turn about to hold him down by force, and silence him  by a napkin thrust into his mouth. This mode of quieting the unlucky  heretic, though sufficiently emphatic, being deemed ineffectual or  inconvenient, George Jackson, a Cameronian, who afterwards suffered at  the gallows, dashed the maniac with his feet and hands against the wall,  and beat him so severely that the rest were afraid that he had killed  him outright. After which specimen of fraternal chastisement, the  lunatic, to avoid the repetition of the discipline, whenever the  prisoners began worship, ran behind the door, and there, with his own  napkin crammed into his mouth, sat howling like a chastised cur. But on  being finally transported to America, John Gibb, we are assured, was  much admired by the heathen for his familiar converse with the devil  bodily, and offering sacrifices to him. \"He died there,\" says Walker,  \"about the year 1720.\"[7] We must necessarily infer that the pretensions  of the natives to supernatural communication could not be of a high  class, since we find them honouring this poor madman as their superior;  and, in general, that the magic, or powahing, of the North American  Indians was not of a nature to be much apprehended by the British  colonists, since the natives themselves gave honour and precedence to  those Europeans who came among them with the character of possessing  intercourse with the spirits whom they themselves professed to worship.    [Footnote 7: See Patrick Walker's \"Biographia Presbyteriana,\" vol. ii.  p. 23; also \"God's Judgment upon Persecutors,\" and Wodrow's \"History,\"  upon the article John Gibb.]    Notwithstanding this inferiority on the part of the powahs, it occurred  to the settlers that the heathen Indians and Roman Catholic Frenchmen  were particularly favoured by the demons, who sometimes adopted their  appearance, and showed themselves in their likeness, to the great  annoyance of the colonists. Thus, in the year 1692, a party of real or  imaginary French and Indians exhibited themselves occasionally to the  colonists of the town of Gloucester, in the county of Essex, New  England, alarmed the country around very greatly, skirmished repeatedly  with the English, and caused the raising of two regiments, and the  dispatching a strong reinforcement to the assistance of the settlement.  But as these visitants, by whom they were plagued more than a fortnight,  though they exchanged fire with the settlers, never killed or scalped  any one, the English became convinced that they were not real Indians  and Frenchmen, but that the devil and his agents had assumed such an  appearance, although seemingly not enabled effectually to support it,  for the molestation of the colony.[8]    [Footnote 8: \"Magnalia,\" book vii. article xviii. The fact is also  alleged in the \"Life of Sir William Phipps.\"]    It appears, then, that the ideas of superstition which the more ignorant  converts to the Christian faith borrowed from the wreck of the classic  mythology, were so rooted in the minds of their successors, that these  found corroboration of their faith in demonology in the practice of  every pagan nation whose destiny it was to encounter them as enemies,  and that as well within the limits of Europe as in every other part of  the globe to which their arms were carried. In a word, it may be safely  laid down, that the commonly received doctrine of demonology, presenting  the same general outlines, though varied according to the fancy of  particular nations, existed through all Europe. It seems to have been  founded originally on feelings incident to the human heart, or diseases  to which the human frame is liable--to have been largely augmented by  what classic superstitions survived the ruins of paganism--and to have  received new contributions from the opinions collected among the  barbarous nations, whether of the east or of the west. It is now  necessary to enter more minutely into the question, and endeavour to  trace from what especial sources the people of the Middle Ages derived  those notions which gradually assumed the shape of a regular system of  demonology.

The only comfort we derived was the reflection that  these lies were too audacious to be aught but inventions made up to  clinch the wavering and timid spirits.    No matter how miserable people in England were then, they will never  realize fully what it meant to pass those black months in the midst of a  Dutch population; one felt oneself indeed alone amongst foes. Smarting  under irritation and annoyance, I decided to go myself to Vryburg--Dutch  town though it had become--and see if I could not ascertain the truth of  these various reports, which I feared might filter into Mafeking and  depress the garrison. Mr. Keeley did not disapprove of my trip, as he  was as anxious as myself to know how the land lay, and he arranged that  Mrs. Keeley's brother, Mr. Coleman, should drive me there in a trap and  pair of ponies. For the benefit of the gossips, I stated as an  ostensible reason for my visit that I had toothache. I was much excited  at the prospect of visiting the Boer headquarters in that part of the  country, and seeing with my own eyes the Transvaal flag flying in the  town of a British colony. Therefore I thought nothing of undertaking a  sixty miles' drive in broiling heat and along a villainous road. The  drive itself was utterly uneventful. We passed several Dutch farmhouses,  many of them untenanted, owing to the so-called loyal colonial owners  having flocked to the Transvaal flag at Vryburg. All these houses,  distinguished by their slovenly and miserable appearance, were built of  rough brick or mud, with tiny windows apparently added as an  afterthought, in any position, regardless of symmetry. Towards sundown  we arrived at a roadside store, where we were kindly entertained for the  night by the proprietors, a respectable Jewish couple.    About five miles from Vryburg a party of thirty horsemen appeared on the  brow of the hill; these were the first Boers I had seen mounted, in  fighting array, and I made sure they would ride up and ask our business;  but apparently we were not interesting enough in appearance, for they  circled away in another direction. The road now descended into a sort of  basin or hollow, wherein lay the snug little town of Vryburg, with its  neat houses and waving trees, and beyond it we could see the white tents  of the Boer laager. A young Dutchman had recently described Vryburg to  me as a town which looked as if it had gone for a walk and got lost, and  as we drove up to it I remembered his words, and saw that his simile was  rather an apt one. There seemed no reason, beyond its site in a  sheltered basin, why Vryburg should have been chosen for the capital of  British Bechuanaland. The railway was at least a mile away on the east,  and so hidden was the town that, till you were close on it, you could  barely see the roofs of the houses. Then suddenly the carriage drove  into the main street, which boasted of some quite respectable shops. The  first thing that attracted our notice was the Court House, almost hidden  in trees, through which glimmered the folds of the gaudy Dutch standard.  Before the court were armed Boers, apparently sentries, whilst others  were passing in and out or lounging outside. Another group were busy  poring over a notice affixed on a tree, which we were told was the  latest war news:         WAR NEWS         LATEST REPORTS         _Price 3d._         VRYBURG, OCT. 31, 1899         MAFEKING SPEECHLESS WITH TERROR         KIMBERLEY TREMBLES         40 ENGLISH SOLDIERS DESERT TO JOIN OUR RANKS         It appears by telegram received this morning that the Burghers       started firing on Mafeking with the big cannon. The town is on       fire and is full of smoke.         The British troops in Natal met the Burghers at Elandslaagte.       The battle-field was kept by the Burghers under General       Prinsloo. Two were killed, four wounded.    We drove down the street, and pulled up at the Central Hotel, where I  got capital rooms and was most civilly received by the manager, an  Englishman. The latter, however, could hardly conceal his surprise at my  visit at this moment. He at once advised me not to mention my name, or  show myself too much, as that very day a new Landrost had arrived to  take charge of the town, and strict regulations respecting the coming  and going of the inhabitants and visitors were being made. He then gave  me some splendid news of the Natal border, the first intelligence of the  victories of Dundee, Elandslaagte, and Glencoe. To hear of those alone  was worth the long drive, and he also showed me the Dutch reports of  these same engagements, which really made one smile. On every occasion  victory had remained with the burghers, while the English dead and  prisoners varied in numbers from 500 to 1,300, according to the mood of  the composer of the despatch. The greatest losses the burghers had  sustained up to then in any one engagement were two killed and three  wounded. The spoils of war taken by the Dutch were of extraordinary  value, and apparently they had but to show themselves for every camp to  be evacuated. They were kind enough to translate these wonderful  despatches into a sort of primitive English, of which printed slips  could be bought for threepence. The hotel manager said if they did not  invent these lies and cook the real account the burghers would desert  _en masse_. So afraid were their leaders of news filtering in from  English sources that all messengers were closely watched and searched.  In the afternoon I drove up to the little hospital to see three of the  occupants of the ill-fated armoured train. They were all convalescent,  and said they were being very kindly treated in every way, but that the  Boer doctoring was of the roughest description, the surgeon's only  assistant being a chemist-boy, and trained nurses were replaced by a few  well-meaning but clumsy Dutch girls, while chloroform or sedatives were  quite unknown.    It was grievous to hear of all the Government military provisions,  police and private properties, being carted off by the \"powers that be,\"  and not a little annoying for the inhabitants to have to put all their  stores at the disposal of the burghers, who had been literally clothed  from head to foot since their arrival. The owners only received a  \"brief\" or note of credit on the Transvaal Government at Pretoria, to be  paid after the war. For fear of exciting curiosity, I did not walk about  much, but observed from the windows of my sitting-room the mounted  burghers patrolling the town, sometimes at a foot's pace, more often at  a smart canter. I felt I never wished to see another Boer. I admitted to  myself they sat their horses well and that their rifle seemed a familiar  friend, but when you have seen one you have seen them all. I never could  have imagined so many men absolutely alike: all had long straggling  beards, old felt hats, shabby clothes, and some evil-looking  countenances. Most of those I saw were men of from forty to fifty years  of age, but there were also a few sickly-looking youths, who certainly  did not look bold warriors. These had not arrived at the dignity of a  beard, but, instead, cultivated feeble whiskers.    After I had seen and heard all I could, came the question of getting  away. The manager told me the Landrost had now forbidden any of the  residents to leave the town, and that he did not think I could get a  pass. However, my Dutch friend was equal to the occasion; he applied for  leave to return to his farm with his sister, having only come in for  provisions. After a long hesitation it was given him, and we decided to  set out at daybreak, fearful lest the permission might be retracted, as  it certainly would have been had my identity and his deception been  discovered, and we should both have been ignominiously lodged in a Boer  gaol. As the sun was rising we left Vryburg. On the outskirts of the  town we were made to halt by eight or ten Boers whose duty it was to  examine the passes of travellers. It can be imagined how my heart beat  as I was made to descend from the cart. I was wearing a shabby old  ulster which had been lent me at the hotel for this purpose; round a  battered sailor hat I had wound a woollen shawl, which with the help of  a veil almost completely concealed my identity. It had been arranged  that Mr. Coleman should tell them I was suffering from toothache and  swollen face. The ordeal of questioning my supposed brother and  examining our passports took some minutes--the longest I have ever  experienced. He contrived to satisfy these inquisitors, and with a  feeling of relief we bundled into the cart again and started on our long  drive to Mosita. On that occasion we accomplished the sixty miles in one  day, so afraid were we of being pursued.    On my return to Mosita I at once despatched old Boaz to Mafeking, giving  them the intelligence of the victories in Natal. This proved to be the  first news that reached them from the more important theatre of the war.  Our life now became uneventful once more. One day an old Irish lady,  wife of a neighbouring farmer, dropped in for a chat. She was a nice old  woman, as true as steel, and terribly worried by these dreadful times.  She had a married daughter in the Transvaal, and a brother also, whose  sons, as well as daughters' husbands, would, she sorely feared, be  commandeered to fight, in which case they might unknowingly be shooting  their own relations over the border. It was the same tale of misery,  anxiety, and wretchedness, everywhere, and the war was but a few weeks  old. The population in that colony, whether Dutch or English, were so  closely mixed together--their real interests so parallel--that it  resolved itself locally into a veritable civil war. It was all the more  dreadful that these poor farmers, after having lost all their cattle by  rinderpest, had just succeeded in getting together fresh herds, and were  hoping for"]]]
