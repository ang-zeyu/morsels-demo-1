The plenary meeting of the Council of State concurred in the decision of  the Department, rejecting only the clause providing for the reward of  the sufferers. The verdict of the Council of State was submitted to the  Tzar and received his endorsement on January 18, 1835. It read as  follows:      The Council of State, having carefully considered all the    circumstances of this complex and involved case, finds that the    depositions of the material female witnesses, Terentyeva, Maximova,    and Koslovska, containing as they do numerous contradictions and    absurdities and lacking all positive evidence and indubitable    conclusions, cannot be admitted as legal proof to convict the Jews    of the grave crimes imputed to them, and, therefore, renders the    following decision:      1. The Jews accused of having killed the soldier boy Yemelyanov and    of other similar deeds, which are implied in the Velizh trial, no    indictment whatsoever having been found against them, shall be freed    from further judgment and inquiry.      2. The material witnesses, the peasant woman Terentyeva, the soldier    woman Maximova, and the Shiakhta woman[1] Kozlovsta, having been    convicted of uttering libels, which they have not in the least been    able to corroborate, shall be exiled to Siberia for permanent    residence.      3. The peasant maid Yeremyeyeva, having posed among the common    people as a soothsayer, shall be turned over to a priest for    admonition.    [Footnote 1: i.e., a member of the Polish nobility; comp. Vol. I, p. 58,  n. 1.]    After attaching his signature to this verdict. Nicholas I. added in his  own handwriting the following characteristic resolution, which was not  to be made public:      While sharing the view of the Council of State that in this case,    owing to the vagueness of the legal deductions, no other decision    than the one embodied in the opinion confirmed by me could have been    reached, I deem it, however, necessary to add that I do not have,    and, indeed, cannot have, the inner conviction that the murder has    not been committed by the Jews. Numerous examples of similar    murders.... go to show that among the Jews there probably exist    fanatics or sectarians who consider Christian blood necessary for    their rites. This appears the more possible, since unfortunately    even among us Christians there sometimes exist such sects which are    no less horrible and incomprehensible. In a word, I do not for a    moment think that this custom is common to all Jews, but I do not    deny the possibility that there may be among them fanatics just as    horrible as among us Christians.    Having taken this idea into his head, Nicholas I. refused to sign the  second decision of the Council of State, which was closely allied with  the verdict: that all governors be instructed to be guided in the future  by the ukase of 1817, forbidding to stir up ritual murder cases \"from  prejudice only.\" While rejecting this prejudice in its full-fledged  shape, the Tzar acknowledged it in part, in a somewhat attenuated form.    Towards the end of January of 1835 an imperial ukase reached the city of  Velizh, ordering the liberation of the exculpated Jews, the reopening of  the synagogues, which had been sealed since 1826, and the handing back  to the Jews of the holy scrolls which had been confiscated by the  police. The dungeon was now ready to give up its inmates, whose strength  had been sapped by the long confinement, while several of them had died  during the imprisonment. The synagogues, which had not been allowed to  resound with the moans of the martyrs, were now opened for the prayers  of the liberated. The state of siege which for nine long years had been  throttling the city was at last taken off; the terror which had haunted  the ostracized community came to an end. A new leaf was added to the  annals of Jewish martyrdom, one of the gloomiest, in spite of its  \"happy\" finale.      7. THE MSTISLAVL AFFAIR    The ritual murder trials did not exhaust the \"extraordinary\" afflictions  of Nicholas' reign. There were cases of wholesale chastisements  inflicted on more tangible grounds, when misdeeds of a few individuals  were puffed up into communal crimes and visited cruelly upon entire  communities. The conscription horrors of that period, when the Kahals  were degraded to police agencies for \"capturing\" recruits, had bred the  \"informing\" disease among the Jewish communities. They produced the type  of professional informer, or _moser_[1], who blackmailed the Kahal  authorities of his town by threatening to disclose their \"abuses,\" the  absconding of candidates for the army and various irregularities in  carrying out the conscription, and in this way extorted \"silence money\"  from them. These scoundrels made life intolerable, and there were  occasions when the people took the law into their own hands and secretly  dispatched the most objectionable among them.    [Footnote 1: The Hebrew and Yiddish equivalent for \"informer.\"]    A case of this kind came to light in the government of Podolia in 1836.  In the town Novaya Ushitza two _mosers_, named Oxman and Schwartz, who  had terrorized the Jews of the whole province, were found dead. Rumor  had it that the one was killed in the synagogue and the other on the  road to the town. The Russian authorities regarded the crime as the  collective work of the local Jewish community, or rather of several  neighboring Jewish communities, \"which had perpetrated this wicked deed  by the verdict of their own tribunal.\"    About eighty Kahal elders and other prominent Jews of Ushitza and  adjacent towns, including two rabbis, were put on trial. The case was  submitted to a court-martial which resolved \"to subject the guilty to an  exemplary punishment.\" Twenty Jews were sentenced to hard labor and to  penal military service, with a preliminary \"punishment by _Spiessruten_  through five hundred men.\" [1] A like number were sentenced to be  deported to Siberia; the rest were either acquitted or had fled from  justice. Many of those who ran the gauntlet died under the strokes, and  are remembered by the Jewish people in Russia as martyrs.    [Footnote 1: Both the word and the penalty were introduced by Peter the  Great from Germany. The culprit was made to run between two lines of  soldiers who whipped his bare shoulders with rods. The penalty was  abolished in 1863.]    The scourge of informers was also responsible for the Mstislavl affair.  In 1844, a Jewish crowd in the market-place of Mstislavl, a town in the  government of Moghilev, came into conflict with a detachment of soldiers  who were searching for contraband goods in a Jewish warehouse. The  results of the fray were a few bruised Jews and several broken rifles.  The local police and military authorities seized this opportunity to  ingratiate themselves with their superiors, and reported to the governor  of Moghilev and the commander of the garrison that the Jews had  organized a \"mutiny.\" The local informer, Arye Briskin, a converted Jew,  found this incident an equally convenient occasion to wreak vengeance on  his former coreligionists for the contempt in which he was held by them,  and allowed himself to be taken into tow by the official Jew-baiters.    In January, 1844, alarming communications concerning a \"Jewish mutiny\"  reached St. Petersburg. The matter was reported to the Tzar, and a swift  and curt resolution followed: \"To court-martial the principal culprits  implicated in this incident, and, in the meantime, as a punishment for  the turbulent demeanor of the Jews of that city, to take from them one  recruit for every ten men.\" Once more the principles of that period were  applied: one for all; first punishment, then trial.    The ukase arrived in Mstislavl on the eve of Purim, and threw the Jews  into consternation. During the Fast of Esther the synagogues resounded  with wailing. The city was in a state of terror: the most prominent  leaders of the community were thrown into jail, and had to submit to  disfigurement by having half of their heads and beards shaved off. The  penal recruits were hunted down, without any regard to age, since,  according to the Tzar's resolution, a tenth of the population had to be  impressed into military service. Pending the termination of the trial,  no Jew was allowed to leave the city, while natives from Mstislavl in  other places were captured and conveyed to their native town. A large  Jewish community was threatened with complete annihilation.    The Jews of Mstislavl, through their spokesmen, petitioned St.  Petersburg to wait with the penal conscription until the conclusion of  the trial, and endeavored to convince the central Government that the  local administration had misrepresented the character of the incident.  To save his brethren, the popular champion of the interests of his  people, the merchant Isaac Zelikin, of Monastyrchina, [1] called  affectionately Rabbi Itzele, journeyed to the capital. He managed to get  the ear of the Chief of the \"Third Section\" [2] and to acquaint him with  the horrors which were being perpetrated by the authorities in  Mstislavl.    [Footnote 1: A townlet in the neighborhood of Mstislavl.]    [Footnote 2: See above, p. 21, n. 1.]    As a result, two commissioners were dispatched from St. Petersburg in  quick succession. On investigating the matter on the spot, they  discovered the machinations of the over-zealous officials and  apostasized informers who had represented a street quarrel as an  organized uprising. The new commission of inquiry, of which one of the  St. Petersburg commissioners, Count Trubetzkoy, was member, disclosed  the fact that the Jewish community as such had had nothing whatsoever to  do with what had occurred.

There was a boy, Fulton, that wild buffalo of a man, whom they  call the Panther, and another who defeated some of your finest plans.\"    Urrea flushed, but controlled his temper.    \"It is true, Ramon,\" he replied. \"The third man I can tell you is called  Obed White, and they are a clever three. I hate them, but it hurts my  pride less to be defeated by them than by any others whom I know.\"    \"Well spoken, Urrea,\" said a third man, \"but since these three are  fighters and will stay to meet us, it is a certainty that our general  will scoop them into his net. Then you can have all the revenge you  wish.\"    \"I count upon it, Ambrosio,\" said Urrea, smiling. \"I also hope that we  shall recapture the man Roylston. He has great sums of money in the  foreign banks in our country, and we need them, but our illustrious  president cannot get them without an order from Roylston. The general  would rather have Roylston than a thousand Texan prisoners.\"    All of them laughed, and the laugh made Ned, lying in the shadow, shiver  once more. Urrea glanced his way presently, but the recumbent figure did  not claim his notice. The attention of his comrades and himself became  absorbed in the dice again. They were throwing the little ivory cubes  upon a blanket, and Ned could hear them click as they struck together.  The sharp little sound began to flick his nerves. Not one to cherish  resentment, he nevertheless began to hate Urrea, and he included in that  hatred the young men with him. The Texans were so few and poor. The  Mexicans were so many, and they had the resources of a nation more than  two centuries old.    Ned rose by and by and walked on. He could imitate the Mexican gait  perfectly, and no one paid any attention to him. They were absorbed,  moreover, in something else, because now the light of torches could be  seen dimly in the south. Officers threw down cards and dice. Men  straightened their uniforms and Cos and Sesma began to form companies in  line. More fuel was thrown on the fires, which sprang up, suffusing all  the night with color and brightness. Ned with his rifle at salute fell  into place at the end of one of the companies, and no one knew that he  did not belong there. In the excitement of the moment he forgot all  about the Panther and Obed.    A thrill seemed to run through the whole Mexican force. It was the most  impressive scene that Ned had ever beheld. A leader, omnipotent in  their eyes, was coming to these men, and he came at midnight out of the  dark into the light.    The torches grew brighter. A trumpet pealed and a trumpet in the camp  replied. The Mexican lines became silent save for a deep murmur. In the  south they heard the rapid beat of hoofs, and then Santa Anna came,  galloping at the head of fifty horsemen. Many of the younger officers  ran forward, holding up torches, and the dictator rode in a blaze of  light.    Ned looked once more upon that dark and singular face, a face daring and  cruel, that might have belonged to one of the old conquistadores. In the  saddle his lack of height was concealed, but on the great white horse  that he rode Ned felt that he was an imposing, even a terrible, figure.  His eyes were blazing with triumph as his army united with torches to do  him honor. It was like Napoleon on the night before Austerlitz, and what  was he but the Napoleon of the New World? His figure swelled and the  gold braid on his cocked hat and gorgeous uniform reflected the beams of  the firelight.    A mighty cheer from thousands of throats ran along the Mexican line, and  the torches were waved until they looked like vast circles of fire.  Santa Anna lifted his hat and bowed three times in salute. Again the  Mexican cheer rolled to right and to left. Santa Anna, still sitting on  his horse, spread out his hands. There was instant silence save for the  deep breathing of the men.    \"My children,\" he said, \"I have come to sweep away these miserable  Texans who have dared to raise the rebel flag against us. We will punish  them all. Houston, Austin, Bowie and the rest of their leaders shall  feel our justice. When we finish our march over their prairies it shall  be as if a great fire had passed. I have said it. I am Santa Anna.\"    The thunderous cheer broke forth again. Ned had never before heard words  so full of conceit and vainglory, yet the strength and menace were  there. He felt it instinctively. Santa Anna believed himself to be the  greatest man in the world, and he was certainly the greatest in Mexico.  His belief in himself was based upon a deep well of energy and daring.  Once more Ned felt a great and terrible fear for Texas, and the thin  line of skin-clad hunters and ranchmen who were its sole defence. But  the feeling passed as he watched Santa Anna. A young officer rushed  forward and held his stirrup as the dictator dismounted. Then the  generals, including those who had come with him, crowded around him. It  was a brilliant company, including Sesma, Cos, Duque, Castrillon, Tolsa,  Gaona and others, among whom Ned noted a man of decidedly Italian  appearance. This was General Vincente Filisola, an Italian officer who  had received a huge grant of land in Texas, and who was now second in  command to Santa Anna.    Ned watched them as they talked together and occasionally the crowd  parted enough for him to see Santa Anna, who spoke and gesticulated with  great energy. The soldiers had been drawn away by the minor officers,  and were now dispersing to their places by the fires where they would  seek sleep.    Ned noticed a trim, slender figure on the outer edge of the group around  Santa Anna. It seemed familiar, and when the man turned he recognized  the face of Almonte, the gallant young Mexican colonel who had been kind  to him. He was sorry to see him there. He was sorry that he should have  to fight against him.    Santa Anna went presently to a great marquee that had been prepared for  him, and the other generals retired also to the tents that had been set  about it. The dictator was tired from his long ride and must not be  disturbed. Strict orders were given that there should be no noise in the  camp, and it quickly sank into silence.    Ned lay down before one of the fires at the western end of the camp  wrapped as before in his serape. He counterfeited sleep, but nothing was  further from his mind. It seemed to him that he had done all he could do  in the Mexican camp. He had seen the arrival of Santa Anna, but there  was no way to learn when the general would order an advance. But he  could infer from Santa Anna's well-known energy and ability that it  would come quickly.    Between the slit left by the brim of his sombrero and his serape he  watched the great fires die slowly. Most of the Mexicans were asleep  now, and their figures were growing indistinct in the shadows. But Ned,  rising, slouched forward, imitating the gait of the laziest of the  Mexicans. Yet his eyes were always watching shrewdly through the slit.  Very little escaped his notice. He went along the entire Mexican line  and then back again. He had a good mathematical mind, and he saw that  the estimate of 7,000 for the Mexican army was not too few. He also saw  many cannon and the horses for a great cavalry force. He knew, too, that  Santa Anna had with him the best regiments in the Mexican service.    On his last trip along the line Ned began to look for the Panther and  Obed, but he saw no figures resembling theirs, although he was quite  sure that he would know the Panther in any disguise owing to his great  size. This circumstance would make it more dangerous for the Panther  than for either Obed or himself, as Urrea, if he should see so large a  man, would suspect that it was none other than the redoubtable  frontiersman.    Ned was thinking of this danger to the Panther when he came face to face  with Urrea himself. The young Mexican captain was not lacking in  vigilance and energy, and even at that late hour he was seeing that all  was well in the camp of Santa Anna. Ned was truly thankful now that  Mexican custom and the coldness of the night permitted him to cover his  face with his serape and the brim of his sombrero.    \"Why are you walking here?\" demanded Urrea.    \"I've just taken a message to General Castrillon,\" replied Ned.    He had learned already that Castrillon commanded the artillery, and as  he was at least a mile away he thought this the safest reply.    \"From whom?\" asked Urrea shortly.    \"Pardon, sir,\" replied Ned, in his best Spanish, disguising his voice as  much as possible, \"but I am not allowed to tell.\"    Ned's tone was courteous and apologetic, and in ninety-nine cases out of  a hundred Urrea would have contented himself with an impatient word or  two. But he was in a most vicious temper. Perhaps he had been rebuked by  Santa Anna for allowing the rescue of Roylston.    \"Why don't you speak up?\" he exclaimed. \"Why do you mumble your words,  and why do you stand in such a slouching manner. Remember that a soldier  should stand up straight.\"    \"Yes, my captain,\" said Ned, but he did not change his attitude. The  tone and manner of Urrea angered him. He forgot where he was and his  danger.    Urrea's swarthy face flushed. He carried in his hand a small riding  whip, which he switched occasionally across the tops of his tall,  military boots.    \"Lout!\" he cried. \"You hear me! Why do you not obey!\"    Ned stood impassive. Certainly Urrea had had a bad half hour somewhere.  His temper leaped beyond control.    \"Idiot!\" he exclaimed.    Then he suddenly lashed Ned across the face with the little riding whip.  The blow fell on serape and sombrero and the flesh was not touched, but  for a few moments Ned went mad. He dropped his rifle, leaped upon the  astonished officer, wrenched the whip from his hands, slashed him across  the cheeks with it until the blood ran in streams,"]]]
