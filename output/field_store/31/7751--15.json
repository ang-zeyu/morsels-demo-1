[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10114"],[0,"The Great Events (#15)"],[1," in its most prosperous times, was chiefly built on the  knob of land which projects into the sea on the eastern coast of Sicily,  between two bays; one of which, to the north, was called the Bay of  Thapsus, while the southern one formed the great harbor of the city of  Syracuse itself. A small island, or peninsula (for such it soon was  rendered), lies at the southeastern extremity of this knob of land,  stretching almost entirely across the mouth of the great harbor, and  rendering it nearly land-locked. This island comprised the original  settlement of the first Greek colonists from Corinth, who founded  Syracuse two thousand five hundred years ago; and the modern city has  shrunk again into these primary limits. But, in the fifth century before  our era, the growing wealth and population of the Syracusans had led  them to occupy and include within their city walls portion after portion  of the mainland lying next to the little isle, so that at the time of  the Athenian expedition the seaward part of the land between the two  bays already spoken of was built over, and fortified from bay to bay,  and constituted the larger part of Syracuse.    The landward wall, therefore, of this district of the city traversed  this knob of land, which continues to slope upward from the sea, and  which, to the west of the old fortifications, that is, toward the  interior of Sicily, rises rapidly for a mile or two, but diminishes in  width, and finally terminates in a long narrow ridge, between which and  Mount Hybla a succession of chasms and uneven low ground extends. On  each flank of this ridge the descent is steep and precipitous from its  summits to the strips of level land that lie immediately below it, both  to the southwest and northwest.    The usual mode of assailing fortified towns in the time of the  Peloponnesian war was to build a double wall round them sufficiently  strong to check any sally of the garrison from within or any attack of a  relieving force from without. The interval within the two walls of the  circumvallation was roofed over, and formed barracks, in which the  besiegers posted themselves, and awaited the effects of want or  treachery among the besieged in producing a surrender; and in every  Greek city of those days, as in every Italian republic of the Middle  Ages, the rage of domestic sedition between aristocrats and democrats  ran high. Rancorous refugees swarmed in the camp of every invading  enemy; and every blockaded city was sure to contain within its walls a  body of intriguing malcontents, who were eager to purchase a party  triumph at the expense of a national disaster. Famine and faction were  the allies on whom besiegers relied. The generals of that time trusted  to the operation of these sure confederates as soon as they could  establish a complete blockade. They rarely ventured on the attempt to  storm any fortified post, for the military engines of antiquity were  feeble in breaching masonry before the improvements which the first  Dionysius effected in the mechanics of destruction; and the lives of  spearmen the boldest and most high-trained would, of course, have been  idly spent in charges against unshattered walls.    A city built close to the sea, like Syracuse, was impregnable save by  the combined operations of a superior hostile fleet and a superior  hostile army; and Syracuse, from her size, her population, and her  military and naval resources, not unnaturally thought herself secure  from finding in another Greek city a foe capable of sending a sufficient  armament to menace her with capture and subjection. But in the spring of  B.C. 414 the Athenian navy was mistress of her harbor and the adjacent  seas; an Athenian army had defeated her troops, and cooped them within  the town; and from bay to bay a blockading wall was being rapidly  carried across the strips of level ground and the high ridge outside the  city (then termed Epipolae), which, if completed, would have cut the  Syracusans off from all succor from the interior of Sicily, and have  left them at the mercy of the Athenian generals. The besiegers' works  were, indeed, unfinished; but every day the unfortified interval in  their lines grew narrower, and with it diminished all apparent hope of  safety for the beleaguered town.    Athens was now staking the flower of her forces, and the accumulated  fruits of seventy years of glory, on one bold throw for the dominion of  the western world. As Napoleon from Mount Coeur de Lion pointed to St.  Jean d'Acre, and told his staff that the capture of that town would  decide his destiny and would change the face of the world, so the  Athenian officers, from the heights of Epipolae, must have looked on  Syracuse, and felt that with its fall all the known powers of the earth  would fall beneath them. They must have felt also that Athens, if  repulsed there, must pause forever from her career of conquest, and sink  from an imperial republic into a ruined and subservient community.    At Marathon, the first in date of the great battles of the world, we  beheld Athens struggling for self-preservation against the invading  armies of the East. At Syracuse she appears as the ambitious and  oppressive invader of others. In her, as in other republics of old and  of modern times, the same energy that had inspired the most heroic  efforts in defence of the national independence soon learned to employ  itself in daring and unscrupulous schemes of self-aggrandizement at the  expense of neighboring nations. In the interval between the Persian and  the Peloponnesian wars she had rapidly grown into a conquering and  dominant state, the chief of a thousand tributary cities, and the  mistress of the largest and best-manned navy that the Mediterranean had  yet beheld. The occupations of her territory by Xerxes and Mardonius, in  the second Persian war, had forced her whole population to become  marines; and the glorious results of that struggle confirmed them in  their zeal for their country's service at sea.    The voluntary suffrage of the Greek cities of the coasts and islands of  the Aegean first placed Athens at the head of the confederation formed  for the further prosecution of the war against Persia. But this titular  ascendency was soon converted by her into practical and arbitrary  dominion. She protected them from piracy and the Persian power, which  soon fell into decrepitude and decay, but she exacted in return implicit  obedience to herself. She claimed and enforced a prerogative of taxing  them at her discretion, and proudly refused to be accountable for her  mode of expending their supplies. Remonstrance against her assessments  was treated as factious disloyalty, and refusal to pay was promptly  punished as revolt. Permitting and encouraging her subject allies to  furnish all their contingents in money, instead of part consisting of  ships and men, the sovereign republic gained the double object of  training her own citizens by constant and well-paid service in her  fleets, and of seeing her confederates lose their skill and discipline  by inaction, and become more and more passive and powerless under her  yoke. Their towns were generally dismantled, while the imperial city  herself was fortified with the greatest care and sumptuousness; the  accumulated revenues from her tributaries serving to strengthen and  adorn to the utmost her havens, her docks, her arsenals, her theatres,  and her shrines, and to array her in that plenitude of architectural  magnificence the ruins of which still attest the intellectual grandeur  of the age and people which produced a Pericles to plan and a Phidias to  execute.    All republics that acquire supremacy over other nations rule them  selfishly and oppressively. There is no exception to this in either  ancient or modern times. Carthage, Rome, Venice, Genoa, Florence, Pisa,  Holland, and republican France, all tyrannized over every province and  subject state where they gained authority. But none of them openly  avowed their system of doing so upon principle with the candor which the  Athenian republicans displayed when any remonstrance was made against  the severe exactions which they imposed upon their vassal allies. They  avowed that their empire was a tyranny, and frankly stated that they  solely trusted to force and terror to uphold it. They appealed to what  they called \"the eternal law of nature, that the weak should be coerced  by the strong.\" Sometimes they stated, and not without some truth, that  the unjust hatred of Sparta against themselves forced them to be unjust  to others in self-defence. To be safe, they must be powerful; and to be  powerful, they must plunder and coerce their neighbors. They never  dreamed of communicating any franchise, or share in office, to their  dependants, but jealously monopolized every post of command and all  political and judicial power; exposing themselves to every risk with  unflinching gallantry; embarking readily in every ambitious scheme; and  never suffering difficulty or disaster to shake their tenacity of  purpose: in the hope of acquiring unbounded empire for their country,  and the means of maintaining each of the thirty thousand citizens who  made up the sovereign republic, in exclusive devotion to military  occupations, and to those brilliant sciences and arts in which Athens  already had reached the meridian of intellectual splendor.    Her great political dramatist speaks of the Athenian empire as  comprehending a thousand states. The language of the stage must not be  taken too literally; but the number of the dependencies of Athens, at  the time when the Peloponnesian confederacy attacked her, was  undoubtedly very great. With a few trifling exceptions, all the islands  of the Aegean, and all the Greek cities which in that age fringed the  coasts of Asia Minor, the Hellespont, and Thrace, paid tribute to  Athens, and implicitly obeyed her orders. The Aegean Sea was an Attic  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10136"],[0,"The Book of Household Management (#15)"],[1,"for the evening are, however, generally considered at liberty to arrive  whenever it will best suit themselves,--usually between nine and twelve,  unless earlier hours are specifically named. By this arrangement, many  fashionable people and others, who have numerous engagements to fulfil,  often contrive to make their appearance at two or three parties in the  course of one evening.    40. THE ETIQUETTE OF THE DINNER-PARTY TABLE being disposed of, let us  now enter slightly into that of an evening party or ball. The  invitations issued and accepted for either of these, will be written in  the same style as those already described for a dinner-party. They  should be sent out _at least_ three weeks before the day fixed for the  event, and should be replied to within a week of their receipt. By  attending to these courtesies, the guests will have time to consider  their engagements and prepare their dresses, and the hostess will, also,  know what will be the number of her party.        If the entertainment is to be simply an evening party, this must      be specified on the card or note of invitation. Short or verbal      invitations, except where persons are exceedingly intimate, or      are very near relations, are very far from proper, although, of      course, in this respect and in many other respects, very much      always depends on the manner in which the invitation is given.      True politeness, however, should be studied even amongst the      nearest friends and relations; for the mechanical forms of good      breeding are of great consequence, and too much familiarity may      have, for its effect, the destruction of friendship.    41. AS THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ARRIVE, each should be shown to a room  exclusively provided for their reception; and in that set apart for the  ladies, attendants should be in waiting to assist in uncloaking, and  helping to arrange the hair and toilet of those who require it. It will  be found convenient, in those cases where the number of guests is large,  to provide numbered tickets, so that they can be attached to the cloaks  and shawls of each lady, a duplicate of which should be handed to the  guest. Coffee is sometimes provided in this, or an ante-room, for those  who would like to partake of it.    42. AS THE VISITORS ARE ANNOUNCED BY THE SERVANT, it is not necessary  for the lady of the house to advance each time towards the door, but  merely to rise from her seat to receive their courtesies and  congratulations. If, indeed, the hostess wishes to show particular  favour to some peculiarly honoured guests, she may introduce them to  others, whose acquaintance she may imagine will be especially suitable  and agreeable. It is very often the practice of the master of the house  to introduce one gentleman to another, but occasionally the lady  performs this office; when it will, of course, be polite for the persons  thus introduced to take their seats together for the time being.        The custom of non-introduction is very much in vogue in many      houses, and guests are thus left to discover for themselves the      position and qualities of the people around them. The servant,      indeed, calls out the names of all the visitors as they arrive,      but, in many instances, mispronounces them; so that it will not      be well to follow this information, as if it were an unerring      guide. In our opinion, it is a cheerless and depressing custom,      although, in thus speaking, we do not allude to the large      assemblies of the aristocracy, but to the smaller parties of the      middle classes.    43. A SEPARATE ROOM OR CONVENIENT BUFFET should be appropriated for  refreshments, and to which the dancers may retire; and cakes and  biscuits, with wine negus, lemonade, and ices, handed round. A supper is  also mostly provided at the private parties of the middle classes; and  this requires, on the part of the hostess, a great deal of attention and  supervision. It usually takes place between the first and second parts  of the programme of the dances, of which there should be several  prettily written or printed copies distributed about the ball-room.        _In private parties_, a lady is not to refuse the invitation of      a gentleman to dance, unless she be previously engaged. The      hostess must be supposed to have asked to her house only those      persons whom she knows to be perfectly respectable and of      unblemished character, as well as pretty equal in position; and      thus, to decline the offer of any gentleman present, would be a      tacit reflection on the master and mistress of the house. It may      be mentioned here, more especially for the young who will read      this book, that introductions at balls or evening parties, cease      with the occasion that calls them forth, no introduction, at      these times, giving a gentleman a right to address, afterwards,      a lady. She is, consequently, free, next morning, to pass her      partner at a ball of the previous evening without the slightest      recognition.    44. THE BALL IS GENERALLY OPENED, that is, the first place in the first  quadrille is occupied, by the lady of the house. When anything prevents  this, the host will usually lead off the dance with the lady who is  either the highest in rank, or the greatest stranger. It will be well  for the hostess, even if she be very partial to the amusement, and a  graceful dancer, not to participate in it to any great extent, lest her  lady guests should have occasion to complain of her monopoly of the  gentlemen, and other causes of neglect. A few dances will suffice to  show her interest in the entertainment, without unduly trenching on the  attention due to her guests. In all its parts a ball should be  perfect,--      \"The music, and the banquet, and the wine;    The garlands, the rose-odours, and the flowers.\"        The hostess or host, during the progress of a ball, will      courteously accost and chat with their friends, and take care      that the ladies are furnished with seats, and that those who      wish to dance are provided with partners. A gentle hint from the      hostess, conveyed in a quiet ladylike manner, that certain      ladies have remained unengaged during several dances, is sure      not to be neglected by any gentleman. Thus will be studied the      comfort and enjoyment of the guests, and no lady, in leaving the      house, will be able to feel the chagrin and disappointment of      not having been invited to \"stand up\" in a dance during the      whole of the evening.    45. WHEN ANY OF THE CARRIAGES OF THE GUESTS ARE ANNOUNCED, or the time  for their departure arrived, they should make a slight intimation to the  hostess, without, however, exciting any observation, that they are about  to depart. If this cannot be done, however, without creating too much  bustle, it will be better for the visitors to retire quietly without  taking their leave. During the course of the week, the hostess will  expect to receive from every guest a call, where it is possible, or  cards expressing the gratification experienced from her entertainment.  This attention is due to every lady for the pains and trouble she has  been at, and tends to promote social, kindly feelings.    46. HAVING THUS DISCOURSED of parties of pleasure, it will be an  interesting change to return to the more domestic business of the house,  although all the details we have been giving of dinner-parties, balls,  and the like, appertain to the department of the mistress. Without a  knowledge of the etiquette to be observed on these occasions, a mistress  would be unable to enjoy and appreciate those friendly pleasant meetings  which give, as it were, a fillip to life, and make the quiet happy home  of an English gentlewoman appear the more delightful and enjoyable. In  their proper places, all that is necessary to be known respecting the  dishes and appearance of the breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper tables,  will be set forth in this work.    47. A FAMILY DINNER AT HOME, compared with either giving or going to a  dinner-party, is, of course, of much more frequent occurrence, and many  will say, of much greater importance. Both, however, have to be  considered with a view to their nicety and enjoyment; and the latter  more particularly with reference to economy. These points will be  especially noted in the following pages on \"Household Cookery.\" Here we  will only say, that for both mistress and servants, as well in large as  small households, it will be found, by far, the better plan, to cook and  serve the dinner, and to lay the tablecloth and the sideboard, with the  same cleanliness, neatness, and scrupulous exactness, whether it be for  the mistress herself alone, a small family, or for \"company.\" If this  rule be strictly adhered to, all will find themselves increase in  managing skill; whilst a knowledge of their daily duties will become  familiar, and enable them to meet difficult occasions with ease, and  overcome any amount of obstacles.    48. OF THE MANNER OF PASSING EVENINGS AT HOME, there is none pleasanter  than in such recreative enjoyments as those which relax the mind from  its severer duties, whilst they stimulate it with a gentle delight.  Where there are young people forming a part of the evening circle,  interesting and agreeable pastime should especially be promoted. It is  of incalculable benefit to them that their homes should possess all the  attractions of healthful amusement, comfort, and happiness; for if they  do not find pleasure there, they will seek it elsewhere. It ought,  therefore, to enter into the domestic policy of every parent, to make  her children feel that home is the happiest place in the world; that to  imbue them with this delicious home-feeling is one of the choicest gifts  a parent can bestow.        Light or fancy needlework often forms a portion of the evening's      recreation for the ladies of the"]]]
