I was  born and raised in Russell County, Ol' Virginny. I was sold out of  Russell County during the war. Ol' Man Menefee refugeed me into  Tennessee near Knoxville. They sold me down there to a man named Jim  Maddison. He carried me down in Virginny near Lynchburg and sold me to  Jim Alec Wright. He was the man I was with in the time of the surrender.  Then I was in a town called Liberty. The last time I was sold, I sold  for $2,300,--more than I'm worth now.    \"Police were for white folks. Patteroles were for niggers. If they  caught niggers out without a pass they would whip them. The patteroles  were for darkies, police for other people.    \"They run me once, and I ran home. I had a dog at home, and there wasn't  no chance them gettin' by that dog. They caught me once in Liberty, and  Mrs. Charlie Crenchaw, Ol' John Crenchaw's daughter, came out and made  them turn me loose. She said, 'They are our darkies; turn them loose.'    \"One of them got after me one night. I ran through a gate and he  couldn't get through. Every time I looked around, I would see through  the trees some bush or other and think it was him gaining on me. God  knows! I ran myself to death and got home and fell down on the floor.    \"The slaves weren't expecting nothing. It got out somehow that they were  going to give us forty acres and a mule. We all went up in town. They  asked me who I belonged to and I told them my master was named Banner.  One man said, 'Young man, I would go by my mama's name if I were you.' I  told him my mother's name was Banner too. Then he opened a book and told  me all the laws. He told me never to go by any name except Banner. That  was all the mule they ever give me.    \"I started home a year after I got free and made a crop. I had my gear  what I had saved on the plantation and went to town to get my mule but  there wasn't any mule.    \"Before the war you belonged to somebody. After the war you weren't  nothin' but a nigger. The laws of the country were made for the white  man. The laws of the North were made for man.    \"Freedom is better than slavery though. I done seed both sides. I seen  darkies chained. If a good nigger killed a white overseer, they wouldn't  do nothin' to him. If he was a bad nigger, they'd sell him. They raised  niggers to sell; they didn't want to lose them. It was just like a mule  killing a man.    \"Yellow niggers didn't sell so well. There weren't so many of them as  there are now. Black niggers stood the climate better. At least,  everybody thought so.    \"If a woman didn't breed well, she was put in a gang and sold. They  married just like they do now but they didn't have no license. Some  people say that they done this and that thing but it's no such a thing.  They married just like they do now, only they didn't have no license.    \"Ol' man came out on April 9, 1865. and said, 'General Lee's whipped now  and dam badly whipped. The war is over. The Yankees done got the  country. It is all over. Just go home and hide everything you got.  General Lee's army is coming this way and stealing everything they can  get their hands on.' But General Lee's army went the other way.    \"I saw a sack of money setting near the store. I looked around and I  didn't see nobody. So I took it and carried it home. Then I hid it. I  heard in town that Jeff Davis was dead and his money was no good. I took  out some of the money and went to the grocery and bought some bread and  handed her five dollar bill. She said, 'My goodness, Henry, that money  is no good; the Yankees have killed it.' And I had done gone all over  the woods and hid that money out. There wasn't no money. Nobody had  anything. I worked for two bits a day. All our money was dead.    \"The Yankees fed the white people with hard tacks (at Liberty,  Virginia). All around the country, them that didn't have nothin' had to  go to the commissary and get hard tacks.    \"I started home. I went to town and rambled all around but there wasn't  nothin' for me.    \"I was set free in April. About nine o'clock in the morning when we went  to see what work we would do, ol' man Wright called us all up and told  us to come together. Then he told us we were free. I couldn't get  nothing to do; so I jus' stayed on and made a crop.\"          Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: John W. H. Barnett, Marianna, Arkansas  Age: 81      \"I was born at Clinton Parish, Louisiana. I'm eighty-one years old. My  parents and four children was sold and left six children behind. They  kept the oldest children. In that way I was sold but never alone. Our  family was divided and that brought grief to my parents. We was sold on  a block at New Orleans. J.J. Gambol (Gamble?) in north Louisiana bought  us. After freedom I seen all but one of our family. I don't recollect  why that was.    \"For three weeks steady after the surrender people was passing from the  War and for two years off and on somebody come along going home. Some  rode and some had a cane or stick walking. Mother was cooking a pot of  shoulder meat. Them blue soldiers come by and et it up. I didn't get any  I know that. They cleaned us out. Father was born at Eastern Shore,  Maryland. He was about half Indian. Mother's mother was a squaw. I'm  more Indian than Negro. Father said it was a white man's war. He didn't  go to war. Mother was very dark. He spoke a broken tongue.    \"We worked on after freedom for the man we was owned by. We worked crops  and patches. I didn't see much difference then. I see a big change come  out of it. We had to work. The work didn't slacken a bit. I never owned  land but my father owned eighty acres in Drew County. I don't know what  become of it. I worked on the railroad section, laid crossties, worked  in stave mills. I farmed a whole lot all along. I hauled and cut wood.    \"I get ten dollars and I sells sassafras and little things along to help  out. My wife died. My two sons left just before the World War. I never  hear from them. I married since then.    \"Present times--I can't figure it out. Seems like a stampede. Not much  work to do. If I was young I reckon I could find something to do.    \"Present generation--Seem like they are more united. The old ones have  to teach the young ones what to do. They don't listen all the time. The  times is strange. People's children don't do them much good now seems  like. They waste most all they make some way. They don't make it regular  like we did farming. The work wasn't regular farming but Saturday was  ration day and we got that.\"          Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: Josephine Ann Barnett,                      R.F.D., De Valls Bluff, Arkansas  Age: 75 or 80      \"I do not knows my exact age. I judge I somewhere between 75 and 80  years old. I was born close to Germantown, Tennessee. We belong, that is  my mother, to Phillip McNeill and Sally McNeill. My mother was a milker.  He had a whole heap of hogs, cattle and stock. That not all my mother  done. She plowed. Children done the churnin'.    \"The way it all come bout I was the onliest chile my mother had. Him and  Miss Sallie left her to help gather the crop and they brought me in the  buggy wid them. I set on a little box in the foot of the buggy. It had a  white umbrella stretched over it. Great big umbrella run in between  them. It was fastened to the buggy seat. When we got to Memphis they  loaded the buggy on the ship. I had a fine time coming. When we got to  Bucks Landing we rode to his place in the buggy. It is 13 miles from  here (De Valls Bluff). In the fall nearly all his slaves come out here.  Then when my mother come on. I never seen my papa after I left back home  [TR: Crossed out: (near Germantown)]. My father belong to Boston Hack.  He wouldn't sell and Mr. McNeill wouldn't sell and that how it come.    \"I muster been five or six years old when I come out here to Arkansas.  My grandma was a midwife. She was already out here. She had to come with  the first crowd cause some women was expecting. I tell you it sho was  squally times. This country was wild. It was different from Tennessee or  close to Germantown where we come from. None of the slaves liked it but  they was brought.    \"The war come on direckly after we got here. Several families had the  slaves drove off to Texas to save them. Keep em from following the  Yankee soldiers right here at the Bluff off. I remember seein' them come  up to the gate. My mother and two aunts went. His son and some more men  drove em. After freedom them what left childern come back. I stayed with  my grandma while they gone. I fed the chickens, shelled corn, churned,  swept. I done any little turns they sent me to do.    \"One thing I remember happened when they had scrimmage close--it mighter  been the one on Long Prairie--they brought a young boy shot through his  lung to Mr. Phillip McNeill's house. He was a stranger. He died. I felt  so sorry for him. He was right young. He belong to the Southern army.  The Southern army nearly made his place their headquarters.    \"Another thing I remember was a agent was going through the country  settin' fire to all the cotton. Mr. McNeill had his cotton--all our crop  we made. That man set it afire. It burned more than a week big. He  burned some left at the gin not Mr. McNeill's. It was fun to us children  but I know my grandma cried and all the balance of the slaves. Cause  they got some Christmas money and clothes too when the cotton was sold.    \"The slaves hated the Yankees. They treated them mean. They was having a  big time. They didn't like the slaves. They steal from the slaves too.  Some poor folks didn't have slaves.    \"After freedom my mother come back after me and we come here to De Valls  Bluff and I been here ever since.

When Horus, the son of Isis, had grown up,    he did battle with Set, who had murdered Horus's father Osiris, and    vanquished him; in many texts these two originally distinct fights are    confused, and the two Horus gods also. The conquest of Set by Horus in    the first conflict typified only the defeat of the night by the day,    but the defeat of Set in the second seems to have been understood as    the victory of life over death, and of good over evil. The symbol of    Set was an animal with a head something like that of a camel, but it    has not yet been satisfactorily identified; figures of the god are    uncommon, for most of them were destroyed by the Egyptians when they    changed their views about him.      9. NEPHTHYS was the sister of Isis and her companion in all her    wanderings and troubles; like her she had a place in the boat of the    Sun at creation, when she probably typified the twilight or very early    night. She was, according to one legend, the mother of Anubis by    Osiris, but in the texts his father is declared to be R[=a]. In    funeral papyri, stelae, etc., she always accompanies Isis in her    ministrations to the dead, and as she assisted Osiris and Isis to    defeat the wickedness of her own husband (Set), so she helped the    deceased to overcome the powers of death and the grave.    Here then we have the nine gods of the divine company of Heliopolis, but  no mention is made of Horus, the son of Isis, who played such an  important part in the history of his father Osiris, and nothing is said  about Thoth; both gods are, however, included in the company in various  passages of the text, and it may be that their omission from it is the  result of an error of the scribe. We have already given the chief  details of the history of the gods Horus and Thoth, and the principal  gods of the other companies may now be briefly named.      NU was the \"father of the gods,\" and progenitor of the \"great company    of the gods\"; he was the primeval watery mass out of which all things    came.      PTAH was one of the most active of the three great gods who carried    out the commands of Thoth, who gave expression in words to the will of    the primeval, creative Power; he was self-created, and was a form of    the Sun-god R[=a] as the \"Opener\" of the day. From certain allusions    in the Book of the Dead he is known to have \"opened the mouth\"    [Footnote: \"May the god Ptah open my mouth\"; \"may the god Shu open my    mouth with his implement of iron wherewith he opened the mouth of the    gods\" (Chap. XXIII.)] of the gods, and it is in this capacity that he    became a god of the cycle of Osiris. His feminine counterpart was the    goddess SEKHET, and the third member of the triad of which he was the    chief was NEFER-TEMU.      PTAH-SEKER is the dual god formed by fusing Seker, the Egyptian name    of the incarnation of the Apis Bull of Memphis, with Ptah.      PTAH-SEKER-AUSAR was a triune god who, in brief, symbolized life,    death, and the resurrection.      KHNEMU was one of the old cosmic gods who assisted Ptah in carrying    out the commands of Thoth, who gave expression in words to the will of    the primeval, creative Power, he is described as \"the maker of things    which are, the creator of things which shall be, the source of created    things, the father of fathers, and the mother of mothers.\" It was he    who, according to one legend, fashioned man upon a potter's wheel.      KHEPERA was an old primeval god, and the type of matter which contains    within itself the germ of life which is about to spring into a new    existence; thus he represented the dead body from which the spiritual    body was about to rise. He is depicted in the form of a man having a    beetle for a head, and this insect became his emblem because it was    supposed to be self-begotten and self-produced. To the present day    certain of the inhabitants of the Sudan, pound the dried scarabaeus or    beetle and drink it in water, believing that it will insure them a    numerous progeny. The name \"Khepera\" means \"he who rolls,\" and when    the insect's habit of rolling along its ball filled with eggs is taken    into consideration, the appropriateness of the name is apparent. As    the ball of eggs rolls along the germs mature and burst into life; and    as the sun rolls across the sky emitting light and heat and with them    life, so earthly things are produced and have their being by virtue    thereof.      R[=A] was probably the oldest of the gods worshipped in Egypt, and his    name belongs to such a remote period that its meaning is unknown. He    was in all periods the visible emblem of God, and was the god of this    earth to whom offerings and sacrifices were made daily; time began    when R[=a] appeared above the horizon at creation in the form of the    Sun, and the life of a man was compared to his daily course at a very    early date. R[=a] was supposed to sail over heaven in two boats, the    [=A]TET or M[=A] TET boat in which he journeyed from sunrise until    noon, and the SEKTET boat in which he journeyed from noon until    sunset. At his rising he was attacked by [=A]pep, a mighty \"dragon\" or    serpent, the type of evil and darkness, and with this monster he did    battle until the fiery darts which he discharged into the body of    =Apep scorched and burnt him up; the fiends that were in attendance    upon this terrible foe were also destroyed by fire, and their bodies    were hacked in pieces. A repetition of this story is given in the    legend of the fight between Horus and Set, and in both forms it    represented originally the fight which was supposed to go on daily    between light and darkness. Later, however, when Osiris had usurped    the position of R[=a], and Horus represented a divine power who was    about to avenge the cruel murder of his father, and the wrong which    had been done to him, the moral conceptions of right and wrong, good    and evil, truth and falsehood were applied to light and darkness, that    is to say, to Horus and Set.    As R[=a] was the \"father of the gods,\" it was natural that every god  should represent some phase of him, and that he should represent every  god. A good illustration of this fact is afforded by a Hymn to R[=a], a  fine copy of which is found inscribed on the walls of the sloping  corridor in the tomb of Seti I., about B.C. 1370, from which we quote  the following:--      11. \"Praise be unto thee, O R[=a], thou exalted Power, who dost enter    into the habitations of Ament, behold [thy] body is Temu.      12. \"Praise be unto thee, O R[=a], thou exalted Power, who dost enter    into the hidden place of Anubis, behold, [thy] body is Khepera.      13. \"Praise be unto thee, O R[=a], thou exalted Power, whose duration    of life is greater than that of the hidden forms, behold [thy] body is    Shu.      14. \"Praise be unto thee, O R[=a], thou exalted Power, .... behold    [thy] body is Tefnut.      15. \"Praise be unto thee, O R[=a], thou exalted Power, who bringest    forth, green things in their season, behold [thy] body is Seb.      16. \"Praise be unto thee, O R[=a], thou exalted Power, thou mighty    being who dost judge,... behold [thy] body is Nut.      17. \"Praise be unto thee, O R[=a], thou exalted Power, the lord....    behold [thy] body is Isis.      18. \"Praise be unto thee, O R[=a], thou exalted Power, whose head    giveth light to that which is in front of thee, behold [thy] body is    Nephthys.      19. \"Praise be unto thee, O R[=a], thou exalted Power, thou source of    the divine members, thou One, who bringest into being that which hath    been begotten, behold [thy] body is Horus.      20. \"Praise be unto thee, O R[=a], thou exalted Power, who dost dwell    in and illumine the celestial deep, behold [thy] body is Nu.\"    [Footnote: For the text see _Annales du Musee Guimet: Le Tombeau de    Seti 1_. (ed. Lefebure), Paris, 1886, pl. v.]    In the paragraphs which follow R[=a] is identified with a large number  of gods and divine personages whose names are not of such common  occurrence in the texts as those given above, and in one way or another  the attributes of all the gods are ascribed to him. At the time when the  hymn was written it is clear that polytheism, not pantheism as some  would have it, was in the ascendant, and notwithstanding the fact that  the Theban god Amen was gradually being forced to the headship of the  companies of the gods of Egypt, we find everywhere the attempt being  made to emphasize the view that every god, whether foreign or native,  was an aspect or form of R[=a].    The god Amen just referred to was originally a local god of Thebes,  whose shrine was either founded or rebuilt as far back as the XIIth  dynasty, about B.C. 2500. This \"hidden\" god, for such is the meaning of  the name Amen, was essentially a god of the south of Egypt, but when the  Theban kings vanquished their foes in the north, and so became masters  of the whole country, Amen became a god of the first importance, and the  kings of the XVIIIth, XIXth, and XXth dynasties endowed his temples on a  lavish scale. The priests of the god called Amen \"the king of the gods,\"  and they endeavoured to make all Egypt accept him as such, but in spite  of their power they saw that they could not bring this result about  unless they identified him with the oldest gods of the land. They  declared that he represented the hidden and mysterious power which  created and sustains the universe, and that the sun was the symbol of  this power; they therefore added his name to that of R[=a], and in"]]]
