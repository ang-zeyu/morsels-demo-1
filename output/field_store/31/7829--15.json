The inquiry into the best constitution is frequently treated as if not  only the theory were an affair of subjective independent conviction,  but as if the introduction of a constitution recognized as the best,  or as superior to others, could be the result of a resolve adopted in  this theoretical manner, as if the form of a constitution were a matter  of free choice, determined by nothing else but reflection. Of this  artless fashion was that deliberation--not indeed of the Persian people,  but of the Persian grandees, who had conspired to overthrow the  pseudo-Smerdis and the Magi, after their undertaking had succeeded  and when there was no scion of the royal family living--as to what  constitution they should introduce into Persia; and Herodotus gives an  equally naive account of this deliberation.    In the present day, the constitution of a country and people is not  represented as so entirely dependent on free and deliberate choice. The  fundamental, but abstractly and therefore imperfectly, entertained  conception of freedom, has resulted in the republic being very generally  regarded--in theory--as the only just and true political constitution.  Even many who occupy elevated official positions under monarchical  constitutions, so far from being opposed to this idea are actually its  supporters; only they see that such a constitution, though the best,  cannot be realized under all circumstances, and that, while men are what  they are, we must be satisfied with less freedom, the monarchical  constitution, under the given circumstances and the present moral  condition of the people, being even regarded as the most advantageous.  In this view also the necessity of a particular constitution is made to  depend on the condition of the people as though the latter were  non-essential and accidental. This representation is founded on the  distinction which the reflective understanding makes between an idea and  the corresponding reality. This reflection holding to an abstract and  consequently untrue idea, not grasping it in its completeness, or--which  is virtually, though not in point of form, the same--not taking a  concrete view of a people and a State. We shall have to show, further,  on, that the constitution adopted by a people makes one substance, one  spirit, with its religion, its art, and its philosophy, or, at least,  with its conceptions, thoughts and culture generally--not to expatiate  upon the additional influences _ab extra_, of climate, of neighbors, of  its place in the world. A State is an individual totality, of which you  cannot select any particular side, although a supremely important one,  such as its political constitution, and deliberate and decide respecting  it in that isolated form. Not only is that constitution most intimately  connected with and dependent on those other spiritual forces, but the  form of the entire moral and intellectual individuality, comprising all  the forces it embodies, is only a step in the development of the grand  whole, with its place pre-appointed in the process--a fact which gives  the highest sanction to the constitution in question and establishes its  absolute necessity. The origin of a State involves imperious lordship on  the one hand, instinctive submission on the other. But even  obedience--lordly power, and the fear inspired by a ruler--in itself  implies some degree of voluntary connection. Even in barbarous states  this is the case; it is not the isolated will of individuals that  prevails; individual pretensions are relinquished, and the general will  is the essential bond of political union. This unity of the general and  the particular is the Idea itself, manifesting itself as a State, and  which subsequently undergoes further development within itself. The  abstract yet necessitated process in the development of truly  independent states is as follows: They begin with regal power, whether  of patriarchal or military origin; in the next phase, particularity and  individuality assert themselves in the form of aristocracy and  democracy; lastly, we have the subjection of these separate interests to  a single power, but one which can be absolutely none other than one  outside of which those spheres have an independent position, viz., the  monarchical. Two phases of royalty, therefore, must be distinguished--a  primary and a secondary. This process is necessitated to the end that  the form of government assigned to a particular stage of development  must present itself; it is therefore no matter of choice, but is the  form adapted to the spirit of the people.    In the constitution the main feature of interest is the self-development  of the rational, that is, the political condition of a people, the  setting free of the successive elements of the Idea, so that the several  powers in the State manifest themselves as separate, attain their  appropriate and special perfection, and yet, in this independent  condition, work together for one object and are held together by  it--i. e., form an organic whole. The State is thus the embodiment of  rational freedom, realizing and recognizing itself in an objective form.  For its objectivity consists in this--that its successive stages are not  merely ideal, but are present in an appropriate reality, and that in  their separate and several workings they are absolutely merged in that  agency by which the totality, the soul, the individuate unity, is  produced, and of which it is the result.    The State is the Idea of Spirit in the external manifestation of human  will and its freedom. It is to the State, therefore, that change in the  aspect of history indissolubly attaches itself; and the successive  phases of the idea manifest themselves in it as distinct political  principles. The constitutions under which world-historical peoples have  reached their culmination, are peculiar to them, and therefore do not  present a generally applicable political basis. Were it otherwise the  differences of similar constitutions would consist only in a peculiar  method of expanding and developing that generic basis, whereas they  really originate in diversity of principle. From the comparison  therefore of the political institutions of the ancient world-historical  peoples, it so happens that, for the most recent principle of a  constitution for the principle of our own times, nothing, so to speak,  can be learned. In science and art it is quite otherwise--that is, the  ancient philosophy is so decidedly the basis of the modern that it is  inevitably contained in the latter and constitutes its basis. In this  case the relation is that of a continuous development of the same  structure, whose foundation-stone, walls, and roof have remained what  they were. In art, the Greek itself, in its original form, furnishes us  the best models, but in regard to political constitution it is quite  otherwise; here the ancient and the modern have not their essential  principle in common. Abstract definitions and dogmas respecting just  government--importing that intelligence and virtue ought to bear  sway--are, indeed, common to both, but nothing is so absurd as to look  to Greeks, Romans, or Orientals, for models for the political  arrangements of our time. From the East may be derived beautiful  pictures of a patriarchal condition, of paternal government, and of  devotion to it on the part of peoples; from Greeks and Romans,  descriptions of popular liberty. Among the latter we find the idea of a  free constitution admitting all the citizens to a share in deliberations  and resolves respecting the affairs and laws of the commonwealth. In our  times, too, this is its general acceptation; only with this  modification, that--since our States are so large, and there are so many  of \"the many,\" the latter (direct action being impossible) should by the  indirect method of elective substitution express their concurrence with  resolves affecting the common weal--that is, that for legislative  purposes generally the people should be represented by deputies. The  so-called representative constitution is that form of government with  which we connect the idea of a free constitution; and this notion has  become a rooted prejudice. On this theory people and government are  separated. But there is a perversity in this antithesis, an  ill-intentioned ruse designed to insinuate that the people are the  totality of the State. Besides, the basis of this view is the principle  of isolated individuality--the absolute validity of the subjective  will--a dogma which we have already investigated. The great point is  that freedom, in its ideal conception, has not subjective will and  caprice for its principle, but the recognition of the universal will,  and that the process by which freedom is realized is the free  development of its successive stages. The subjective will is a merely  formal determination--a _carte blanche_--not including what it is that  is willed. Only the rational will is that universal principle which  independently determines and unfolds its own being and develops its  successive elemental phases as organic members. Of this Gothic-cathedral  architecture the ancients knew nothing.    At an earlier stage of the discussion we established the two elemental  considerations: First, the _idea_ of freedom as the absolute and final  aim; secondly, the _means_ for realizing it, i. e., the subjective side  of knowledge and will, with its life, movement, and activity.

There is no reason to  believe that he had the good of any one at heart; that he had  anything in view but his own material prosperity. He made a  bargain with a printer in Batavia to expose Masonry, and lost his  life in attempting to carry out that bargain. Lost his life!--who  knows? The story is a strange one, as strange as anything in the  Arabian Nights; there are men still living who faintly recollect  the excitement, the fends and controversies which lasted for  years. From Batavia to Canandaigua the name of Morgan calls forth  a flood of reminiscences. A man whose father or grandfather had  anything to do with the affair is a character in the community;  now and then a man is found who knew a man who caught a glimpse of  Morgan during that mysterious midnight ride from the Canandaigua  jail over the Rochester road, and on to the end in the magazine of  the old fort at Lewiston. One cannot spend twenty-four hours in  this country without being drawn into the vortex of this absorbing  mystery; it hangs over the entire section, lingers along the  road-sides, finds outward sign and habitation in old buildings,  monuments, and ruins; it echoes from the past in musty books,  papers, and pamphlets; it once was politics, now is history; the  years have not solved it; time is helpless.    At Le Roy we sought shelter under the friendly roof of an old, old  house. How it did storm; the Rochester papers next day said that  no such storm had ever been known in that part of the State. The  rain fell in torrents; the main street was a stream of water  emptying into the river; the flashes of lightning were followed so  quickly by crashes of thunder that we knew trees and buildings  were struck near by, as in fact they were. It seemed as if the  heavens were laying siege to the little village and bringing to  bear all nature's great guns.    The house was filled with old books and mementoes of the past;  every nook and corner was interesting. In an old secretary in an  upper room was found a complete history of Morgan's disappearance,  together with the affidavits taken at the time and records of such  court proceedings as were had.    These papers had been gathered together in 1829. One by one I  turned the yellow leaves and read the story from beginning to end;  it is in brief as follows:    In the summer of 1826 it was rumored throughout Western New York  that one William Morgan, then living in the village of Batavia,  was writing an exposure of the secrets of Free Masonry, under  contract with David Miller, a printer of the same place, who was  to publish the pamphlet.    Morgan was a man entirely without means; he was said to have  served in the War of 1812, and was known to have been a brewer,  but had not made a success in business; he was rooming with a  family in Batavia with his wife and two small children, one a  child of two years, the other a babe of two months. He was quite  irresponsible, and apparently not overscrupulous in either  contracting debts or the use of the property of others.    There is not the slightest reason to believe that his so-called  exposure of Masonry was prompted by any motives other than the  profits he might realize from the sale of the pamphlet. Nor is  there any evidence that he enjoyed the confidence of the community  where he lived. His monument--as in many another case--awards him  virtues he did not possess. The figure of noble bearing on the top  of the shaft is the idealization of subsequent events, and  probably but illy corresponds with the actual appearance of the  impecunious reality. The man's fate made him a hero.    On August 9 the following notice appeared in a newspaper published  in Canandaigua:    \"Notice and Caution.--If a man calling himself William Morgan  should intrude himself on the community, they should be on their  guard, particularly the Masonic Fraternity. Morgan was in the  village in May last, and his conduct while here and elsewhere  calls forth this notice. Any information in relation to Morgan can  be obtained by calling at the Masonic Hall in this village.  Brethren and Companions are particularly requested to observe,  mark, and govern themselves accordingly.    \"Morgan is considered a swindler and a dangerous man.    \"There are people in the village who would be happy to see this  Captain Morgan.    \"Canandaigua, August 9, 1826.\"    This notice was copied in two newspapers published in Batavia.    About the middle of August a stranger by the name of Daniel Johns  appeared in Batavia and took up his lodgings in one of the public  houses of the village. He made the acquaintance of Miller, offered  to go in business with him, and to furnish whatever money might be  necessary for the publication of the Morgan book. Miller accepted  his proposition and took the man into his confidence. As it  afterwards turned out, Johns's object in seeking the partnership  was to secure possession of the Morgan manuscript, so that Miller  could not publish the work; the man's subsequent connection with  this strange narrative appears from the affidavit of Mrs. Morgan,  referred to farther on.    During the month of August, Morgan with his family boarded at a  house in the heart of the village; but to avoid interruption in  his work he had an upper room in the house of John David, on the  other side of the creek from the town.    August 19 three well-known residents of the village accompanied by  a constable from Pembroke went to David's house, inquired for  David and Towsley, who both lived there with their families, and  on being told they were not at home, rushed up-stairs to the room  where Morgan was writing, seized him and the papers which he was  even then arranging for the printer. He was taken to the county  jail and kept from Saturday afternoon until Monday morning, when  he was bailed out.    On the same Saturday evening the same men went to the house where  Morgan boarded, and saying they had an execution, inquired of Mrs.  Morgan whether her husband had any property. They were told he had  none, but nevertheless two of the men went into Morgan's room and  made a search for papers. On leaving the house one of them said to  Mrs. Morgan, \"We have just conducted your husband to jail, and  shall keep him there until we find his papers.\"    September 8, James Ganson, who kept the tavern at Stafford, was  notified from Batavia that between forty and fifty men would be  there for supper. The men came and late at night departed for  Batavia, where they found a number of men gathered from other  points. From an affidavit taken afterwards it seems the object of  the party was to destroy Miller's office, but they found Miller  and Morgan had been warned. At any rate, the party dispersed  without doing anything. Part of them reassembled at Ganson's, and  charges of cowardice were freely exchanged; certain of the leaders  were afterwards indicted for their part in this affair, but no  trial was had.    To this day the business portion of Batavia stretches along both  sides of a broad main street; instead of cross-streets at regular  intervals there are numerous alleys leading off the main street,  with here and there a wider side street. In those days nearly all  the buildings were of wood and but one or two stories in height.  Miller's printing-offices occupied the second stories of two  wooden buildings; a side alley separating the two buildings,  dividing also, of course, the two parts of the printing  establishment.    On Sunday night, September 10, fire was discovered under the  stairways leading to the printing-offices; on extinguishing the  blaze, straw and cotton balls saturated with turpentine were found  under the stairways, and some distance from the buildings a dark  lantern was found.    On this same Sunday morning, September 10, a man--the coroner of  the county--in the village of Canandaigua, fifty miles east of  Batavia, obtained from a justice of the peace a warrant for the  arrest of Morgan on the charge of stealing a shirt and a cravat in  the month of May from an innkeeper named Kingsley.    Having obtained the warrant, which was directed to him as coroner,  the complainant called a constable, and together with four  well-known residents of Canandaigua they hired a special stage and  started for Batavia.    At Avon, Caledonia, and Le Roy they were joined by others who  seemed to understand that Morgan was to be arrested.    At Stafford they stopped for supper at Ganson's tavern. After  supper they proceeded towards Batavia, but stopped about a mile  and a half east of the village, certain of the party returning  with the stage.    Early the next morning Morgan was arrested, and an extra stage  engaged to take the party back. The driver, becoming uneasy as to  the regularity of the proceedings, at first refused to start, but  was persuaded to go as far as Stafford, where Ganson--whom the  driver knew--said everything was all right and that he would  assume all responsibility.    About sunset of the same day--Monday, September 11--they arrived  at Canandaigua, and Morgan was at once examined by the justice;  the evidence was held insufficient and the prisoner discharged.    The same complainant immediately produced a claim for two dollars  which had been assigned to him. Morgan admitted the debt,  confessed judgment, and pulled off his coat, offering it as  security.    The constable refused to take the coat and took Morgan to jail.    Tuesday noon, September 12, a crowd of strangers appeared in  Batavia, assembling at Donald's tavern. A constable went to  Miller's office, arrested him, and took him to the tavern, where  he was detained in a room for about two hours. He was then put in  an open wagon with some men, all strangers to him. The constable  mounted his horse and the party proceeded to Stafford. Arriving  there Miller was conducted to the third story of the stone  building beside the"]]]
