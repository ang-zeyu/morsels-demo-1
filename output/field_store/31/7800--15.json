To and fro  he walked, before the gleaming cabinet, and presently his expression  underwent a subtle change. His pipe had long since gone out, but he had  failed to observe the fact. His eyes had grown unusually bright--and  suddenly he stepped to the table and stooping made a note upon the  little writing block.    He rang the bell communicating with the outer office. Innes came in.  \"Innes,\" he said, rapidly, \"is there anything of really first-rate  importance with which I should deal personally?\"    \"Well,\" replied the secretary, glancing at some papers which he carried,  \"there is nothing that could not wait until to-morrow at a pinch.\"    \"The pinch has come,\" said Harley. \"I am going to interview the two most  important witnesses in the Abingdon case.\"    \"To whom do you refer, Mr. Harley?\"    Innes stared rather blankly, as he made the inquiry, whereupon:    \"I have no time to explain,\" continued Harley. \"But I have suddenly  realized the importance of a seemingly trivial incident which I  witnessed. It is these trivial incidents, Innes, which so often contain  the hidden clue.\"    \"What! you really think you have a clue at last?\"    \"I do.\" The speaker's face grew grimly serious. \"Innes, if I am right,  I shall probably proceed to one of two places: the apartments of  Ormuz Khan or the chambers of Nicol Brinn. Listen. Remain here until I  phone--whatever the hour.\"    \"Shall I advise Wessex to stand by?\"    Harley nodded. \"Yes--do so. You understand, Innes, I am engaged and not  to be disturbed on any account?\"    \"I understand. You are going out by the private exit?\"    \"Exactly.\"    As Innes retired, quietly closing the door, Harley took up the telephone  and called Sir Charles Abingdon's number. He was answered by a voice  which he recognized.    \"This is Paul Harley speaking,\" he said. \"Is that Benson?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" answered the butler. \"Good morning, sir.\"    \"Good morning, Benson. I have one or two questions to ask you, and there  is something I want you to do for me. Miss Abingdon is out, I presume?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" replied Benson, sadly. \"At the funeral, sir.\"    \"Is Mrs. Howett in?\"    \"She is, sir.\"    \"I shall be around in about a quarter of an hour, Benson. In the  meantime, will you be good enough to lay the dining table exactly as it  was laid on the night of Sir Charles's death?\"    Benson could be heard nervously clearing his throat, then: \"Perhaps,  sir,\" he said, diffidently, \"I didn't quite understand you. Lay the  table, sir, for dinner?\"    \"For dinner--exactly. I want everything to be there that was present on  the night of the tragedy; everything. Naturally you will have to place  different flowers in the vases, but I want to see the same vases. From  the soup tureen to the serviette rings, Benson, I wish you to duplicate  the dinner table as I remember it, paying particular attention to the  exact position of each article. Mrs. Howett will doubtless be able to  assist you in this.\"    \"Very good, sir,\" said Benson--but his voice betokened bewilderment. \"I  will see Mrs. Howett at once, sir.\"    \"Right. Good-bye.\"    \"Good-bye, sir.\"    Replacing the receiver, Harley took a bunch of keys from his pocket and,  crossing the office, locked the door. He then retired to his private  apartments and also locked the communicating door. A few moments later  he came out of \"The Chancery Agency\" and proceeded in the direction  of the Strand. Under cover of the wire-gauze curtain which veiled  the window he had carefully inspected the scene before emerging.  But although his eyes were keen and his sixth sense whispered  \"Danger--danger!\" he had failed to detect anything amiss.    This constant conflict between intuition and tangible evidence was  beginning to tell upon him. Either his sixth sense had begun to  play tricks or he was the object of the most perfectly organized and  efficient system of surveillance with which he had ever come in contact.  Once, in the past, he had found himself pitted against the secret police  of Moscow, and hitherto he had counted their methods incomparable.  Unless he was the victim of an unpleasant hallucination, those Russian  spies had their peers in London.    As he alighted from a cab before the house of the late Sir Charles,  Benson opened the door. \"We have just finished, sir,\" he said, as Harley  ran up the steps. \"But Mrs. Howett would like to see you, sir.\"    \"Very good, Benson,\" replied Harley, handing his hat and cane to the  butler. \"I will see her in the dining room, please.\"    Benson throwing open the door, Paul Harley walked into the room which so  often figured in his vain imaginings. The table was laid for dinner in  accordance with his directions. The chair which he remembered to have  occupied was in place and that in which Sir Charles had died was set at  the head of the table.    Brows contracted, Harley stood just inside the room, looking slowly  about him. And, as he stood so, an interrogatory cough drew his gaze to  the doorway. He turned sharply, and there was Mrs. Howett, a pathetic  little figure in black.    \"Ah, Mrs. Howett,\" said Harley; kindly, \"please try to forgive me for  this unpleasant farce with its painful memories. But I have a good  reason. I think you know this. Now, as I am naturally anxious to have  everything clear before Miss Abingdon returns, will you be good enough  to tell me if the table is at present set exactly as on the night that  Sir Charles and I came in to dinner?\"    \"No, Mr. Harley,\" was the answer, \"that was what I was anxious to  explain. The table is now laid as Benson left it on that dreadful  night.\"    \"Ah, I see. Then you, personally, made some modifications?\"    \"I rearranged the flowers and moved the centre vase so.\" The methodical  old lady illustrated her words. \"I also had the dessert spoons changed.  You remember, Benson?\"    Benson inclined his head. From a sideboard he took out two silver spoons  which he substituted for those already set upon the table.    \"Anything else, Mrs. Howett?\"    \"The table is now as I left it, sir, a few minutes before your  arrival. Just after your arrival I found Jones, the parlourmaid--a most  incompetent, impudent girl--altering the position of the serviettes. At  least, such was my impression.\"    \"Of the serviettes?\" murmured Harley.    \"She denied it,\" continued the housekeeper, speaking with great  animation; \"but she could give no explanation. It was the last straw.  She took too many liberties altogether.\"    As Harley remained silent, the old lady ran on animatedly, but Harley  was no longer listening.    \"This is not the same table linen?\" he asked, suddenly.    \"Why, no, sir,\" replied Benson. \"Last week's linen will be at the  laundry.\"    \"It has not gone yet,\" interrupted Mrs. Howett. \"I was making up the  list when you brought me Mr. Harley's message.\"    Paul Harley turned to her.    \"May I ask you to bring the actual linen used at table on that occasion,  Mrs. Howett?\" he said. \"My request must appear singular, I know, but I  assure you it is no idle one.\"    Benson looked positively stupid, but Mrs. Howett, who had conceived a  sort of reverence for Paul Harley, hurried away excitedly.    \"Finally, Benson,\" said Harley, \"what else did you bring into the room  after Sir Charles and I had entered?\"    \"Soup, sir. Here is the tureen, on the sideboard, and all the soup  plates of the service in use that night. Of course, sir, I can't say  which were the actual plates used.\"    Paul Harley inspected the plates, a set of fine old Derby ware, and  gazed meditatively at the silver ladle. \"Did the maid, Jones, handle any  of these?\" he asked.    \"No, sir\"--emphatically. \"She was preparing to bring the trout from the  kitchen.\"    \"But I saw her in the room.\"    \"She had brought in the fish plates, a sauce boat, and two toast racks,  sir. She put them here, on the sideboard. But they were never brought to  the table.\"    \"H'm. Has Jones left?\"    \"Yes, sir. She was under notice. But after her rudeness, Mrs. Howett  packed her off right away. She left the very next day after poor Sir  Charles died.\"    \"Where has she gone?\"    \"To a married sister, I believe, until she finds a new job. Mrs. Howett  has the address.\"    At this moment Mrs. Howett entered, bearing a tablecloth and a number of  serviettes.    \"This was the cloth,\" she said, spreading it out, \"but which of the  serviettes were used I cannot say.\"    \"Allow me to look,\" replied Paul Harley.    One by one he began to inspect the serviettes, opening each in turn and  examining it critically.    \"What have we here!\" he exclaimed, presently. \"Have blackberries been  served within the week, Mrs. Howett?\"    \"We never had them on the table, Mr. Harley. Sir Charles--God rest  him--said they irritated the stomach. Good gracious!\" She turned to  Benson. \"How is it I never noticed those stains, and what can have  caused them?\"    The serviette which Paul Harley held outstretched was covered all over  with dark purple spots.        CHAPTER XII. THE VEIL IS RAISED    Rising from the writing table in the library, Paul Harley crossed to  the mantelpiece and stared long and hungrily at a photograph in a silver  frame. So closely did he concentrate upon it that he induced a sort of  auto-hypnosis, so that Phil Abingdon seemed to smile at him sadly. Then  a shadow appeared to obscure the piquant face. The soft outline changed,  subtly; the lips grew more full, became voluptuous; the eyes lengthened  and grew languorous. He found himself looking into the face of Ormuz  Khan.    \"Damn it!\" he muttered, awakened from his trance.    He turned aside, conscious of a sudden, unaccountable chill. It might  have been caused by the mental picture which he had conjured up, or it  might be another of those mysterious warnings of which latterly he had  had so many without encountering any positive danger. He stood quite  still, listening.    Afterward he sometimes recalled that moment,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11602"],[0,"The World of Ice (#15)"],[1,"contempt; \"do you  know since I came to this part of the world, I've come to the conclusion  that fairy tales are all stuff, and very inferior stuff too! Why, this  reality is a thousand million times grander than anything that was ever  invented. But what surprises me most is the red snow. What can be the  cause of it?\"    \"I don't know,\" replied Singleton, \"it has long been a matter of dispute  among learned men. But we must examine it for ourselves, so come along.\"    The remarkable colour of the snow referred to, although a matter of  dispute at the period of the _Dolphin's_ visit to the Arctic Seas, is  generally admitted now to be the result of a curious and extremely  minute vegetable growth, which spreads not only over its surface, but  penetrates into it sometimes to a depth of several feet. The earlier  navigators who discovered it, and first told the astonished world that  the substance which they had been accustomed to associate with the idea  of the purest and most radiant whiteness had been seen by them lying  _red_ upon the ground, attributed the phenomenon to innumerable  multitudes of minute creatures belonging to the order _Radiata_; but the  discovery of red snow among the central Alps of Europe, and in the  Pyrenees, and on the mountains of Norway, where _marine_ animalcula  could not exist, effectually overturned this idea. The colouring matter  has now been ascertained to result from plants belonging to the order  called _Algae_, which have a remarkable degree of vitality, and possess  the power, to an amazing extent, of growing and spreading with rapidity  even over such an ungenial soil as the Arctic snow.    While Singleton was examining the red snow, and vainly endeavouring to  ascertain the nature of the minute specks of matter by which it was  coloured, Fred continued to gaze with a look of increasing earnestness  towards the tall column, around which a bank of fog was spreading, and  partially concealing it from view. At length he attracted the attention  of his companion towards it.    \"I say, I'm half inclined to believe that yon is no work of nature, but  a monument set up to attract the attention of ships. Don't you think  so?\"    Singleton regarded the object in question for some time. \"I don't think  so, Fred; it is larger than you suppose, for the fog-bank deceives us.  But let us go and see; it cannot be far off.\"    As they drew near to the tall rock, Fred's hopes began to fade, and soon  were utterly quenched by the fog clearing away, and showing that the  column was indeed of nature's own constructing. It was a single,  solitary shaft of green limestone, which stood on the brink of a deep  ravine, and was marked by the slaty limestone that once encased it. The  length of the column was apparently about five hundred feet, and the  pedestal of sandstone on which it stood was itself upwards of two  hundred feet high.    This magnificent column seemed the flag-staff of a gigantic crystal  fortress, which was suddenly revealed by the clearing away of the  fog-bank to the north. It was the face of the great glacier of the  interior, which here presented an unbroken perpendicular front--a sweep  of solid glassy wall, which rose three hundred feet above the  water-level, with an unknown depth below it. The sun glittered on the  crags and peaks and battlements of this ice fortress, as if the  mysterious inhabitants of the Far North had lit up their fires and  planted their artillery to resist further invasion.    The effect upon the minds of the two youths, who were probably the  first to gaze upon those wondrous visions of the Icy Regions, was  tremendous. For a long time neither of them could utter a word, and it  would be idle to attempt to transcribe the language in which, at length,  their excited feelings sought to escape. It was not until their backs  had been for some time turned on the scene, and the cape near the valley  of red snow had completely shut it out from view, that they could  condescend to converse again in their ordinary tones on ordinary  subjects.    As they hastened back over the ice-belt at the foot of the cliffs, a  loud boom rang out in the distance and rolled in solemn echoes along the  shore.    \"There goes a gun,\" exclaimed Tom Singleton, hastily pulling out his  watch. \"Hallo! do you know what time it is?\"    \"Pretty late, I suppose. It was afternoon, I know, when we started, and  we must have been out a good while now. What time is it?\"    \"Just two o'clock in the morning!\"    \"What! do you mean to say it was _yesterday_ when we started, and that  we've been walking all night, and got into _to-morrow morning_ without  knowing it?\"    \"Even so, Fred. We have overshot our time, and the captain is signalling  us to make haste. He said that he would not fire unless there seemed  some prospect of the ice moving, so we had better run, unless we wish to  be left behind; come along.\"    They had not proceeded more than half-a-mile when a Polar bear walked  leisurely out from behind a lump of ice, where it had been regaling  itself on a dead seal, and sauntered slowly out towards the icebergs  seaward, not a hundred yards in advance of them.    \"Hallo! look there! what a monster!\" shouted Fred, as he cocked his  musket and sprang forward. \"What'll you do, Tom, you've no gun?\"    \"Never mind, I'll do what I can with the hammer. Only make sure you  don't miss. Don't fire till you are quite close to him.\"    They were running after the bear at top speed while they thus conversed  in hasty and broken sentences, when suddenly they came to a yawning  crack in the ice, about thirty feet wide, and a mile long on either  hand, with the rising tide boiling at the bottom of it. Bruin's pursuers  came to an abrupt halt.    \"Now, isn't that disgusting?\"    Probably it was, and the expression of chagrin on Fred's countenance as  he said so evidently showed that he meant it; but there is no doubt that  this interruption to their hunt was extremely fortunate, for to attack a  Polar bear with a musket charged only with small shot, and a geological  hammer, would have been about as safe and successful an operation as  trying to stop a locomotive with one's hand. Neither of them had yet had  experience of the enormous strength of this white monarch of the Frozen  Regions and his tenacity of life, although both were reckless enough to  rush at him with any arms they chanced to have.    \"Give him a long shot--quick!\" cried Singleton.    Fred fired instantly; and the bear stopped, and looked round, as much as  to say, \"Did you speak, gentlemen?\" Then, not receiving a reply, he  walked away with dignified indifference, and disappeared among the  ice-hummocks.    An hour afterwards the two wanderers were seated at a comfortable  breakfast in the cabin of the _Dolphin_, relating their adventures to  the captain and mates, and, although unwittingly, to Mivins, who  generally managed so to place himself, while engaged in the mysterious  operations of his little pantry, that most of the cabin talk reached his  ear, and travelled thence through his mouth to the forecastle. The  captain was fully aware of this fact, but he winked at it, for there was  nothing but friendly feeling on board the ship, and no secrets. When,  however, matters of serious import had to be discussed, the cabin door  was closed, and Mivins turned to expend himself on Davie Summers, who,  in the capacity of a listener, was absolutely necessary to the  comfortable existence of the worthy steward.    Having exhausted their appetites and their information, Fred and Tom  were told that, during their absence, a bear and two seals had been shot  by Meetuck, the Esquimau interpreter, whom they had taken on board at  Upernavik; and they were further informed that the ice was in motion to  the westward, and that there was every probability of their being  released by the falling tide. Having duly and silently weighed these  facts for a few minutes, they simultaneously, and as if by a common  impulse, yawned, and retired to bed.        CHAPTER IX.    _The \"Dolphin\" gets beset in the ice--Preparations for wintering in the  ice--Captain Guy's code of laws_.      An accident now befell the _Dolphin_ which effectually decided the fate  of the ship and her crew, at least for that winter. This was her getting  aground near the ravine of the giant flagstaff before mentioned, and  being finally beset by ice, from which all efforts on the part of the  men to extricate her proved abortive, and in which she was ultimately  frozen in, hard and fast.    The first sight the crew obtained of the red snow filled them with  unbounded amazement, and a few of the more superstitious amongst them  with awe approaching to fear. But soon their attention was attracted  from this by the wonderful column.    \"Och, then! may I niver!\" exclaimed O'Riley, the moment he caught sight  of it, \"if there ben't the north pole at long last--_sure_ enough!\"    The laugh that greeted this remark was almost immediately checked,  partly from the feelings of solemnity inspired by the magnificent view  which opened up to them, and partly from a suspicion on the part of the  more ignorant among the men that there might be some truth in O'Riley's  statement after all.    But their attention and energies were speedily called to the dangerous  position of the ship, which unexpectedly took the ground in a bay where  the water proved to be unusually shallow, and before they could warp her  off the ice closed round her in compact, immovable masses. At first  Captain Guy was not seriously alarmed by this untoward event, although  he felt a little chagrin in consequence of the detention, for the summer  was rapidly advancing, and it behoved him to return to Baffin's Bay and  prosecute the whale-fishing as energetically as possible; but when day  after day passed, and the ice round the ship still remained immovable,  he became alarmed, and sought by every means in his "]]]
