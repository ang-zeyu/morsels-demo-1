They affect Rajput  ways, although the Rajputs would disdain their kinship; and they  give to their chiefs the Rajput title of \"Thakur,\" a name common  to the Deity and to great earthly lords, and now often used to  still lower persons. So much has this practice indeed extended,  that some tribes use the term generically, and speak of  themselves as of the \"Thakur\" race. These, however, are chiefly  pure Rajputs. It is stated, by an excellent authority, that even  now the Jats \"can scarcely be called pure Hindus, for they have  many observances, both domestic and religious, not consonant with  Hindu precepts. There is a disposition also to reject the fables  of the Puranic Mythology, and to acknowledge the unity of the  Godhead.\" (Elliot's Glossary, in voce \"Jat.\") Wherever they are  found, they are stout yeomen; able to cultivate their fields, or  to protect them, and with strong administrative habits of a  somewhat republican cast. Within half a century, they have four  times tried conclusions with the might of Britain. The Jats of  Bhartpur fought Lord Lake with success, and Lord Combermere with  credit; and their \"Sikh\" brethren in the Panjab shook the whole  fabric of British India on the Satlaj, in 1845, and three years  later on the field of Chillianwala. The Sikh kingdom has been  broken up, but the Jat principality of Bhartpur still exists,  though with contracted limits, and in a state of complete  dependence on the British Government. There is also a thriving  little principality  that of Dholpur  between Agra and Gwalior,  under a descendant of the Jat Rana of Gohad, so often met with in  the history of the times we are now reviewing (v. inf. p. 128.)  It is interesting to note further, that some ethnologists have  regarded this fine people as of kin to the ancient Get¾, and to  the Goths of Europe, by whom not only Jutland, but parts of the  south-east of England and Spain were overrun, and to some extent  peopled. It is, therefore, possible that the yeomen of Kent and  Hampshire have blood relations in the natives of Bhartpur and the  Panjab.    The area of the Bhartpur State is at present 2,000 square miles,  and consists of a basin some 700 feet above sea level, crossed by  a belt of red sandstone rocks. It is hot and dry; but in the  skilful hands that till it, not unfertile; and the population has  been estimated at near three-quarters of a million.    At the time at which our history has arrived, the territory  swayed by the chiefs of the Jats was much more extensive, and had  undergone the fate of many another military republic, by falling  into the hands of the most prudent and daring of a number of  competent leaders. It has already been shown (in Part I.) how  Suraj Mal, as Raja of the Bhartpur Jats, joined the Mahrattas in  their resistance to the great Musalman combination of 1760. Had  his prudent counsels been followed, it is possible that this  resistance would have been more successful, and the whole history  of Hindustan far otherwise than what it has since been. But the  haughty leader of the Hindus, Sheodasheo Rao Bhao, regarded Suraj  Mal as a petty landed chief not accustomed to affairs on a grand  scale, and so went headlong on his fate.    Escaping, like his friend Holkar, from the disaster of Panipat   though in a less discreditable way, for he did not profess to  take the field and then fly in the midst of battle, as the other  did  Suraj Mal took an early opportunity of displacing the  Mahratta Governor of the important fort of Agra, and at the same  time, occupied some strong places in the Mewat country. The  sagacious speculator, about the same time, dropped the falling  cause of Ghazi-ud-din, whose method of statesmanship was too  vigorous for his taste, and who, as has been above shown, retired  soon after from a situation which he had aided to render  impracticable. But a criminal of greater promise, about the same  time, joined Suraj Mal. This was none other than the notorious  Sumroo, who had wisely left his late protector the Nawab of Audh,  at the head of a battalion of Sepoys, a detail of artillery, and  some three hundred European ruffians of all countries.    Thus supported, the bucolic sagacity of the Jat Raja began for  the first time to fail him, and he made demands which seemed to  threaten the small remains of the Moghul Empire. Najib-ud-daulah  took his measures with characteristic promptitude and prudence.  Summoning the neighbouring Musalman chiefs to the aid of Islam  and of the empire, he took the field at the head of a small but  well-disciplined Moghul army, and soon found the opportunity to  strike a decisive blow.    In this campaign the premier was so fortunate as to obtain solid  assistance from the Biloch chiefs of Farokhnagar and Bahadurgarh,  who were in those days powerful upon both banks of the Jamna up  to as far north as Saharanpur on the eastern, and Hansi on the  western side. The actual commencement of hostilities between  Suraj Mal and the Moghuls arose from a demand made by the former  for the Faujdarship (military prefecture) of the small district  of Farokhnagar. Unwilling to break abruptly with the Jat chief,  Najib had sent an envoy to him, in the first instance, pointing  out that the office he solicited involved a transfer of the  territory, and referring him to the Biloch occupant for his  consent. The account of the negotiation is so characteristic of  the man and the time, that I have thought it worth preserving.  The Moghul envoy introduced himself  in conformity with Eastern  custom  by means of a gift, which, in this instance, consisted  of a handsome piece of flowered chintz, with which the rural  potentate was so pleased that he ordered its immediate conversion  into a suit of clothes. Since this was the only subject on which  the Jat chief would for the present converse, the Moghul proposed  to take his leave, trusting that he might reintroduce the subject  of the negotiations at a more favourable moment. \"Do nothing  rashly, Thakur Sahib,\" said the departing envoy; \"I will see you  again to-morrow.\" \"See me no more,\" replied the inflated boor,  \"if these negotiations are all that you have to talk of.\" The  disgusted envoy took him at his word, and returned to Najib with  a report of the interview. \"Is it so?\" said the premier. \"Then we  must fight the unbeliever; and if it be the pleasure of the Most  High God, we will assuredly smite him.\"    But before the main body of the Moghuls had got clear of the  capital, Suraj Mal had arrived near Shahdara on the Hindan,  within six miles of Dehli; and, had he retained the caution of  his earlier years, he might have at once shut up the Imperialists  in their walled city. But the place being an old hunting-ground  of the Emperor's the Thakur's motive in coming had been chiefly  the bravado of saying that he had hunted in a royal park, and he  was therefore only attended by his personal staff. While he was  reconnoitring in this reckless fashion, he was suddenly  recognised by a flying squadron of Moghul horse, who surprised  the Jats, and killed the whole party, bringing the body of the  chief to Najib. The minister could not at first believe in this  unhoped-for success, nor was he convinced until the envoy who had  recently returned from the Jat camp identified the body by means  of his own piece of chintz, which formed its raiment. Meanwhile  the Jat army was marching up in fancied security from  Sikandrabad, under Jowahir Singh, the son of their chief, when  they were suddenly charged by the Moghul advanced guard, with the  head of Suraj Mal borne on a horseman's lance as their standard.  In the panic which ensued upon this ghastly spectacle, the Jats  were thoroughly routed and driven back into their own country.  This event occurred towards the end of the year.    Foiled in their unaided attempt, they next made a still more  signal mistake in allying themselves with Malhar Rao Holkar, who,  as we have seen, was secretly allied to the Musalmans. At first  they were very successful, and besieged the premier for three  months in Dehli; but Holkar suddenly deserted them, as was only  to have been expected had they known what we know now; and they  were fain to make the best terms that they could, and return to  their own country, with more respectful views towards the empire  and its protector.    But the young Thakur's thirst of conquest was by no means  appeased, and he proceeded in 1765 to attack Madhu Sing, the  Rajput ruler of Jaipur, son of the Kachwaha Raja Jai Singh, who  had lately founded a fine city there in lieu of the ancestral  site, Amber. Descended from Kusha, the eldest son of the Hindu  demigod Rama, this tribe appears to have been once extensive and  powerful, traces of them being still found in regions as far  distant from each other as; Gwalior and the Northern Doab. (Vide  Elliot, in voc.) In this attempt Jowahir appears to have been but  feebly sustained by Sumroo, who immediately deserted to the  victors, after his employer had been routed at the famous Lake of  Pokar, near Ajmir. Jowahir retreated first upon Alwar, thence he  returned to Bhartpur, and soon after took up his abode at Agra,  where he not long afterwards was murdered, it is said at the  instigation of the Jaipur Raja. A period of very great confusion  ensued in the Jat State; nor was it till two more of the sons of  Suraj Mal had perished  one certainly by violence  that the  supremacy of the remaining son, Ranjit Singh, was secured. In his  time the Jat power was at its height; he swayed a country thick  with strongholds, from Alwar on the N.W. to Agra on the S.W.,  with a revenue of two millions sterling, and an army of 60,000  men.    Meantime the Mahrattas, sickened by their late encounter with  Carnac (p. 73), and occupied with their own domestic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14721"],[0,"Speeches & Letters of Abraham Lincoln, 1832-1865 (#15)"],[1,"\"...they never mention him,       His name is never heard:       Their lips are now forbid to speak       That once familiar word.\"    They have slaughtered one of his most cherished measures, and his ghost  would arise to rebuke them. [Great applause.]    Now, let us harmonize, my friends, and appeal to the moderation and  patriotism of the people: to the sober second thought; to the awakened  public conscience. The repeal of the sacred Missouri Compromise has  installed the weapons of violence: the bludgeon, the incendiary torch,  the death-dealing rifle, the bristling cannon--the weapons of kingcraft,  of the inquisition, of ignorance, of barbarism, of oppression. We see  its fruits in the dying bed of the heroic Sumner; in the ruins of the  \"Free State\" hotel; in the smoking embers of the _Herald of Freedom_; in  the free-State Governor of Kansas chained to a stake on freedom's soil  like a horse-thief, for the crime of freedom. [Applause.] We see it in  Christian statesmen, and Christian newspapers, and Christian pulpits,  applauding _the cowardly act of a low bully_, WHO CRAWLED UPON HIS  VICTIM BEHIND HIS BACK AND DEALT THE DEADLY BLOW. [Sensation and  applause.] We note our political demoralization in the catch-words that  are coming into such common use; on the one hand, \"freedom-shriekers,\"  and sometimes \"freedom-screechers\" [Laughter]; and, on the other hand,  \"border ruffians,\" and that fully deserved. And the significance of  catch-words cannot pass unheeded, for they constitute a sign of the  times. Everything in this world \"jibes\" in with everything else, and all  the fruits of this Nebraska bill are like the poisoned source from which  they come. I will not say that we may not sooner or later be compelled  to meet force by force; but the time has not yet come, and if we are  true to ourselves, may never come. Do not mistake that the ballot is  stronger than the bullet. Therefore let the legions of slavery use  bullets; but let us wait patiently till November, and fire ballots at  them in return; and by that peaceful policy, I believe we shall  ultimately win. [Applause.]    It was by that policy that here in Illinois the early fathers fought the  good fight and gained the victory. In 1824 the free men of our State,  led by Governor Coles (who was a native of Maryland and President  Madison's private secretary), determined that those beautiful groves  should never re-echo the dirge of one who has no title to himself. By  their resolute determination, the winds that sweep across our broad  prairies shall never cool the parched brow, nor shall the unfettered  streams that bring joy and gladness to our free soil water the tired  feet, of a _slave_; but so long as those heavenly breezes and sparkling  streams bless the land, or the groves and their fragrance or their  memory remain, the humanity to which they minister SHALL BE FOR EVER  FREE! [Great applause.] Palmer, Yates, Williams, Browning, and some more  in this convention came from Kentucky to Illinois (instead of going to  Missouri), not only to better their conditions, but also to get away  from slavery. They have said so to me, and it is understood among us  Kentuckians that we don't like it one bit. Now, can we, mindful of the  blessings of liberty which the early men of Illinois left to us, refuse  a like privilege to the free men who seek to plant Freedom's banner on  our Western outposts? [\"No! No!\"] Should we not stand by our neighbours  who seek to better their conditions in Kansas and Nebraska? [\"Yes!  Yes!\"] Can we as Christian men, and strong and free ourselves, wield the  sledge or hold the iron which is to manacle anew an already oppressed  race? [\"No! No!\"] \"Woe unto them,\" it is written, \"that decree  unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have  prescribed.\" Can we afford to sin any more deeply against human liberty?  [\"No! No!\"]    One great trouble in the matter is, that slavery is an insidious and  crafty power, and gains equally by open violence of the brutal as well  as by sly management of the peaceful. Even after the ordinance of 1787,  the settlers in Indiana and Illinois (it was all one government then)  tried to get Congress to allow slavery temporarily, and petitions to  that end were sent from Kaskaskia, and General Harrison, the Governor,  urged it from Vincennes the capital. If that had succeeded, good-bye to  liberty here. But John Randolph of Virginia made a vigorous report  against it; and although they persevered so well as to get three  favourable reports for it, yet the United States Senate, with the aid of  some slave States, finally _squelched_ it for good. [Applause.] And that  is why this hall is to-day a temple for free men instead of a negro  livery stable. [Great applause and laughter.] Once let slavery get  planted in a locality, by ever so weak or doubtful a title, and in ever  so small numbers, and it is like the Canada thistle or Bermuda  grass--you can't root it out. You yourself may detest slavery; but your  neighbour has five or six slaves, and he is an excellent neighbour, or  your son has married his daughter, and they beg you to help save their  property, and you vote against your interest and principles to  accommodate a neighbour, hoping that your vote will be on the losing  side. And others do the same; and in those ways slavery gets a sure  foothold. And when that is done the whole mighty Union--the force of the  nation--is committed to its support. And that very process is working in  Kansas to-day. And you must recollect that the slave property is worth a  billion of dollars ($1,000,000,000); while free-State men must work for  sentiment alone. Then there are \"blue lodges\"--as they call  them--everywhere doing their secret and deadly work.    It is a very strange thing, and not solvable by any moral law that I  know of, that if a man loses his horse, the whole country will turn out  to help hang the thief; but if a man but a shade or two darker than I am  is himself stolen, the same crowd will hang one who aids in restoring  him to liberty. Such are the inconsistencies of slavery, where a horse  is more sacred than a man; and the essence of _squatter_ or popular  sovereignty--I don't care how you call it--is that if one man chooses to  make a slave of another, no third man shall be allowed to object. And if  you can do this in free Kansas, and it is allowed to stand, the next  thing you will see is ship-loads of negroes from Africa at the wharf at  Charleston; for one thing is as truly lawful as the other; and these  are the bastard notions we have got to stamp out, else they will stamp  us out. [Sensation and applause.]    Two years ago, at Springfield, Judge Douglas avowed that Illinois came  into the Union as a slave State, and that slavery was weeded out by the  operation of his great, patent, everlasting principle of \"popular  sovereignty.\" [Laughter.] Well, now, that argument must be answered, for  it has a little grain of truth at the bottom. I do not mean that it is  true in essence, as he would have us believe. It could not be  essentially true if the ordinance of '87 was valid. But, in point of  fact, there were some degraded beings called slaves in Kaskaskia and the  other French settlements when our first State constitution was adopted;  that is a fact, and I don't deny it. Slaves were brought here as early  as 1720, and were kept here in spite of the ordinance of 1787 against  it. But slavery did not thrive here. On the contrary, under the  influence of the ordinance, the number _decreased_ fifty-one from 1810  to 1820; while under the influence of _squatter_ sovereignty, right  across the river in Missouri, they _increased_ seven thousand two  hundred and eleven in the same time; and slavery finally faded out in  Illinois, under the influence of the law of freedom, while it grew  stronger and stronger in Missouri, under the law or practice of \"popular  sovereignty.\" In point of fact there were but one hundred and seventeen  slaves in Illinois one year after its admission, or one to every four  hundred and seventy of its population; or, to state it in another way,  if Illinois was a slave State in 1820, so were New York and New Jersey  much greater slave States from having had greater numbers, slavery  having been established there in very early times. But there is this  vital difference between all these States and the judge's Kansas  experiment: that they sought to disestablish slavery which had been  already established, while the judge seeks, so far as he can, to  disestablish freedom, which had been established there by the Missouri  Compromise. [Voices: \"Good!\"]    The Union is undergoing a fearful strain; but it is a stout old ship,  and has weathered many a hard blow, and \"the stars in their courses,\"  aye, an invisible power, greater than the puny efforts of men, will  fight for us. But we ourselves must not decline the burden of  responsibility, nor take counsel of unworthy passions. Whatever duty  urges us to do or to omit, must be done or omitted; and the recklessness  with which our adversaries break the laws, or counsel their violation,  should afford no example for us. Therefore, let us revere the  Declaration of Independence; let us continue to obey the Constitution  and the laws; let us keep step to the music of the Union. Let us draw a  cordon, so to speak, around the slave States, and the hateful  institution, like a reptile poisoning itself, will perish by its own  infamy. [Applause.]    But we cannot be free men if this is, by our national choice, to be a  land of slavery. Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for  themselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.  [Loud applause.]    Did you ever, my friends, seriously reflect upon the speed with which we  are tending downward? Within the memory of men now present the leading  statesmen of Virginia could make genuine, red-hot abolitionist speeches  "]]]
