See that it is right next time, or we'll stop the      paper.\"        Here my visitor laughed. \"I suppose that's another reason for your      staying here. When we write anything about a person we don't have to      see them again and hear about it.\"        \"But,\" I replied, \"that's the very reason I cling to the small town.      I want to see the people about whom I am writing, and live with      them. That's what brings the rewards in our business. It's the      personal side that makes it worth while, the real living of a      newspaper instead of merely writing to fill its columns.\"        In many small towns women have not heretofore been overly welcome on      the staff of the local paper, for the small town is essentially      conservative and suspicious of change. This war, however, is      changing all that, and many a woman with newspaper ambitions will      now have her chance at home.        For ten years I have been what may be classified as a small town      newspaper woman, serving in every capacity from society reporter to      city and managing editor. During this time I have been tempted many      times to go to fields where national fame and a larger salary      awaited those who won. But it was that latter part that held me      back, that and one other factor: \"Those who won,\" and \"What do they      get out of it more than I?\"        It is generally conceded that for one woman who succeeds in the      metropolitan newspaper field about ten fail before the vicissitudes      of city life, the orders of managing editors, and the merciless      grind of the big city's working world. And with those who succeed,      what have they more than I? They sign their names to articles; they      receive big salaries; they are famous--as such fame goes. Why is a      signed name to an article necessary, when everyone knows when the      paper comes out that I wrote the article? What does national fame      mean compared with the fact that the local laws of the \"Society for      the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\" were not being enforced and      that I wrote stories that remedied this condition?        I began newspaper life as society reporter of a daily paper in a      Middle-Western town of ten thousand inhabitants. That is, I supposed      I was going to be society reporter, but before very long I found      myself doing police assignments, sport, editing telegraph, and      whatever the occasion demanded.        I suppose that the beginnings of everyone's business life always      remain vivid memories. The first morning I reported for work at      seven o'clock. Naturally, no one was in the front office, as the      news department of a small-town newspaper office is sometimes      called. I was embarrassed and nervous, and sat anxiously awaiting      the arrival of the city editor. In five minutes he gave me      sufficient instructions to last a year, but the only one I remember      was, \"Ask all the questions you can think of, and don't let anyone      bluff you out of a story.\"        My first duty, and one that I performed every morning for several      years, was to \"make\" an early morning train connecting with a large      city, forty miles away. It was no easy task to approach strangers      and ask their names and destination; but it was all good experience,      and it taught me how to approach people and to ask personal      questions without being rude.        During my service as society reporter I learned much, so much that I      am convinced there is no work in the smaller towns better suited to      women. Any girl who is bright and quick, who knows the ethics of      being a lady, can hold this position and make better money at it      than by teaching or clerking.        Each trade, they say, has its tricks, and being a society reporter      is no exception. In towns of from one thousand to two thousand      inhabitants, the news that Mrs. X. is going to give a party spreads      rapidly by that system of wireless telegraphy that excels the      Marconi--neighborhood gossip. But in the larger towns it is not so      easy. In \"our town,\" whenever there is a party the ice cream is      ordered from a certain confectioner. Daily he permitted us to see      his order book. If Mrs. Jones ordered a quart of ice cream we knew      that she was only having a treat for the family. If it were two      quarts or more, it was a party, and if it was ice cream in molds, we      knew a big formal function was on foot.        Society reporting is a fertile field, and for a long time I had been      thinking that society columns were too dull. My ideal of a newspaper      is that every department should be edited so that everyone would      read all the paper. I knew that men rarely read the social column.      One day a man said to me that he always called his wife his better      judgment instead of his better half. That appealed to me as      printable, but where to put it in the paper? Why not in my own      department? I did so. That night when the paper came out everyone      clamored to know who the man was, for I had merely written, \"A man      in town calls his wife his better judgment instead of his better      half.\"        Then I decided to make the society department a reflection of our      daily life and sayings. In order to get these in I used the initials      of my title, \"S.R.\" I never used names, but I always managed to      identify my persons.        As one might expect, I brought down a storm about my head. Many      persons took the hints for themselves when they were not so      intended, and there were some amusing results. For instance, when I      said in the paper that \"a certain man in a down-town store has      perfect manners,\" the next day twelve men thanked me, and I received      four boxes of candy as expressions of gratitude.        There were no complaints about the society column being dull after      this; everyone read it and laughed at it, and it was quoted in many      exchanges. Of course, I was careful to hurt no one's feelings, but I      did occasionally have a little good-natured fun at the expense of      people who wouldn't mind it. Little personal paragraphs of this      sort must never be malicious or mean--if the paper is to keep its      friends.        Of all my newspaper experience I like best to dwell on the society      reporting; but if I were to advance I knew that I must take on more      responsibility, so I became city editor of another paper. I was      virtually managing editor, for the editor and owner was a politician      and was away much of the time. It was then that I began to realize      the responsibility of my position, to grapple with the problem of      dealing fairly both with my employer and the public. The daily life      with its varying incidents, the big civic issues, the stories to be      handled, the rights of the advertisers to be considered, the      adjusting of the news to the business department--all these were      brought before me with a powerful clarity.        When a woman starts on a city paper she knows that there are      linotypes, presses and other machinery. Often she has seen them      work; but her knowledge of \"how\" they work is generally vague. It      was on my third day as city editor that I realized my woeful      ignorance of the newspaper business from the mechanical viewpoint. I      had just arrived at the office when the foreman came to my desk.        \"Say,\" he said, \"we didn't get any stuff set last night. Power was      off. Better come out and pick out the plate you want to fill with.\"        What he meant by the power being off I could understand, and      perforce I went out to select the plate. He handed me long slabs of      plate matter to read. Later I learned that printed copies of the      plate are sent for selection, but in my ignorance I took up the      slabs and tried to read the type. To my astonishment it was all      backward, and I found myself wondering if it were a Chinese feature      story. Finally I threw myself on his mercy and told him to select      what he chose. As I left the composing-room I heard him say to one      of the printers: \"That's what comes of the boss hiring a hen      editor.\"        Shortly after noon a linotype operator came to me with his hands      full of copy.        \"If you want any of this dope in the paper,\" he said, \"you'll have      to grab off a paragraph here and there. My machine's got a bad      squirt, and it'll take an hour or more to fix it.\"        Greek, all Greek! A squirt! I was too busy \"grabbing off\" paragraphs      to investigate; but then and there I resolved to penetrate all these      mysteries. I found the linotype operator eager to show me how his      machine works, and the foreman was glad to take me around and      instruct me in his department and also in the pressroom. I have had      trouble with printers since; but in the end they had to admit that      the \"hen editor\" knew what she was talking about.        There is a great cry now for woman's advancement. If the women are      hunting equality as their goal let them not seek out the crowded,      hostile cities, but remain in the smaller places where their work      can stand out distinctly. A trite phrase expresses it that a      newspaper is the \"voice of the people.\" What better than that a      woman should set the tune for that voice?        Equality with men! I sit at my desk looking out over the familiar      home scene. A smell of fresh ink comes to me, and a paper just off  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],[0,"The Hawk of Egypt (#15)"],[1," his hurt.    Shortly after, one day during the noon hours, in the cool shadows of  his great palace in Cairo, there came to Hugh Carden Ali an  overpowering desire to see the girl he loved amongst her own people.    She was his at dawn in the desert, although miles of sand stretched  between them; his in the rush of the wind, the glory of the sky and the  thunder of the horses' hoofs; but to whom did she turn at night; in the  maze of the dance; the hothouse atmosphere of the hotel; the crush of  the winter visitors?    So, giving a twist to the dagger of love in his heart, he tucked the  dogs of Billi in beside him and drove as the sun set to Heliopolis,  and, guessing that the duchess would have a table near the window,  chose one on the opposite side of the dining-room, so that his presence  should not be thrust upon the girl or the old woman who had known his  mother.    He sat there, indifferent to or oblivious of the interest his presence  aroused, unconsciously counting the vertebrae of the lady at the next  table, who had evidently forgotten some essential part of her bodice.    He counted the vertebrae in the back of the lady who was dying to turn  round, until the duchess and Damaris entered the room; then he clenched  his hands under the table with an involuntary shudder of disgust.    It was the first time he had seen the girl he loved in evening dress,  and every instinct of the Oriental in him was outraged at the sight of  the gleaming neck and shoulders and hint of lace-shrouded virgin form.    She was not in full _decolletage_ by any means, but the waiter's sleeve  was but an inch from her satin skin when he bent over her, so that,  although he had long grown accustomed in Europe to the undraping of  woman o' nights, yet, because he loved the beautiful girl, he longed  for the right to walk across the room, pick her up in his arms, and,  smothering her in a _barku_, hide her forever from all male eyes but  his own.    Later, as he sat alone in a far corner of the ball-room, he twisted the  dagger of love this way and that in his tormented heart, whilst the  dogs of Billi worried the life out of the hall-porter as they fretted  and moaned for their master who tarried.  He had never danced, himself,  loathing the idea of the propinquity of a stranger's body so close to  his own; of a stranger's mouth so near his own; of the animal odour of  the naked body, which no perfume can hide, within his nostrils; just as  he loathed the idea of a woman passing from one man's arms to another's  throughout the best part of a night.    He had no desire whatever to dance with Damaris, but all the Eastern in  him longed to make her dance for him; in the desert for preference;  under the light of the moon; with the insistent throbbing of the drum  keeping time to the rhythm of the slender feet upon the warm sand.    And he sat and dreamed under the palms, taking no heed of the sudden  cessation of music, the gathering of the dancers against the walls; the  half-suppressed, laughter and moistening of lip with furtive tongue and  the unusual feeling of expectancy in the heavy, perfumed air.    But he came back to earth when from some corner of the room there came  the faint tapping of a drum.    Three times there fell a single beat, then a gentle roll and a single  beat, bringing him to his feet as he recognised the measure, just as  the lights were switched off, excepting for one great beam which,  striking down from some device in the ceiling, made a silvery pool in  the middle of the floor.    \"No!\" he cried from the shadows, \"this must not be.  It is not seemly  for the eyes of women.\"    But the answer to this protest came in little jeering laughs and quick  remonstrance from those who feared that the whetting of their appetites  should be snatched from them, and a sigh of satisfaction went up when,  from the shadows, there sprang an Arabian youth, beautiful as a god,  supple as a snake, quick upon his feet as any fighting stallion.    He stood for a second with arms outflung to the men and women he knew  were watching his every movement outside the radius of the light, and  then he sprang back with that marvellous leap which is the gift of some  Arabian male dancers.    Ah me! you talk in pharisaic whispers of the Nautch girl; in righteous  anger against the dainty geisha; in horror of the weaving Salomes as  known in Western cities; wait, however, before you pour the last drop  from your vials of wrath and indignation until you have seen an Arab  dance \"_al-fajr_\" which, being translated, means the dawn.  You can put  what interpretation you like upon it: the dawn of day, or love,  anything will do, but you most certainly ought not to watch it.    If, however, you persist in so doing, you should blush to the roots of  your hair--you will not, because it will be the perfect poetry of  motion you will be witnessing; also ought you, after the third  movement, to turn your back or flee the room--you will not, again,  because of the mocking sensuality which will keep you rooted where you  stand; again, you ought to stuff your ears against the throbbing of the  drum--but that will you not do because of the words of love which fall,  seemingly reft from the dancer's lips in the rapture of his movements.  It is the last word in sensual ecstasy, and should be prohibited for  public exhibition to Europeans, yet it is quite impossible to point at  any one movement and label it as the cause of the tumult within you.    But Hugh Carden Ali, standing under a palm, turned quickly when a  little sound of distress caught his ear, and put out his hand and  pulled the girl he had recognised in the dark by her perfume towards  him, so that the back of her head rested against his arm; and sensing  her nausea at the sight from which she had been trying to fly, and  knowing the sheer impossibility of keeping the eyes shut in a theatre,  he pulled his handkerchief from his sleeve and placed it across her  eyes.    Save for the back of her head resting just below his shoulder he did  not touch her, and if he bent his head so that the perfumed riot of her  curls swept his cheek, should it count as a grievous sin against him?    The stone beside each of us is quite likely to lie untouched throughout  our span of three-score plus ten.    At the last beat of the drum and just before the lights were switched  on, Damaris was alone, with a silken handkerchief in her hand, in one  corner of which, as she discovered later, was embroidered the Hawk of  Old Egypt.          CHAPTER XII      \"_. . . Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,    And one by one back in the Closet lays_.\"              OMAR KHAYYAM.      Hugh Carden Ali, with the dogs of Billi crushed in beside him, raced  back to his palace in Cairo and with the shaggy pair at his heels  passed to his side of the great house.  His body-servant, as nimble as  a monkey, as devoted as a dog, and almost dumb by reason of a tongue  split in his youth for misdemeanour, fell on his knees at his feet.    He worshipped his young master, who had one time rescued him from a  savage, baiting crowd in the bazaar and taking him into his service had  made him his own particular servant; he equally loathed his master's  austere bedroom and adjoining dressing-room, with simple furniture  which had lately come from _Bilid el-Ingliz_, a dark, cold country  across the sea, where it rains without ceasing.  And he helped strip  his master of the hateful, tight, hot European clothes and trotted  joyfully after him to the swimming-bath, and watched him dive in and  swim the length and climb out the other end, and disappear between  curtains into the luxurious rooms of the East.    Having robed him, agog with curiosity and at a discreet distance, he  followed the resplendent figure in his satin raiment, snow-white turban  glistening with jewels and hooded falcon on wrist, and cursed the dogs  under his breath when they turned and growled softly.  But his  curiosity was turned to a great amazement when his master passed into  the court of the empty, luxuriant, perfumed harem, where once had loved  and quarrelled, idled and fought, so many beautiful women.    Under the orders of the Ethiopian eunuch, giant twin of Qatim, in the  service of Zulannah the courtesan, the harem was kept swept and  garnished, adorned with flowers, aglow at nights with a myriad soft  lights hanging from the ceiling in jewelled lamps, to which were flung  the fountain's perfumed drops, to fall and break on marble floor and  silken cushion, inlaid table and bright-hued birds in jewelled cage.    There does exist a different kind of harem--dirty, gaudy,  ill-kempt--somewhat like the inmates--over the whole of which 'tis wise  to draw a veil.    The eunuch's bankings-account--which was kept in a certain secret nook  of the harem court--had become sadly depleted on account of his  master's eccentric views as regarded women, but he still lived in hope,  and, delighting in intrigue, as every native does, had welcomed the  advent of his ebony brother primed with gossip and suggestion.    Therefore, upon the beating of the gong which had not been struck for  many weary moons, he hastened to the court and salaamed to the ground  before his master, who sat upon a pile of cushions, guarded by the two  shaggy dogs of Billi, with the amber mouthpiece of the jewel-encrusted  _nargileh_ between his lips and the falcon upon a padded perch beside  him.    \"Bring me a woman--to dance,\" he curtly ordered, and the slave sped to  do his bidding, with visions of a big increase in the banking-account  hidden in a secret place.    And when the dancer drifted in like a flower-petal upon a breeze, Hugh  Carden Ali looked up slowly, letting escape a wisp of smoke from  between his lips.    The dancer wore one single garment of transparent black, hung from the  shoulders by diamond bands and through which her perfectly nude body  shone like an ivory"]]]
