Their food appeared to consist of seal and shell-fish; their  houses, merely shelters of boughs covered with grass and leaves built to  windward of a small fire.    A SNOWSTORM.    On 16th January, Banks, Solander, Buchan, Green, Monkhouse, two seamen,  and Banks's two coloured servants, tried to get up the hills to see  something of the surrounding country, but they found their progress  hampered by the dwarf vegetation. To add to their discomfort a heavy  snowstorm came on. Several of the party experienced that desire to sleep  which is produced by cold, and were warned by Solander of the danger of  giving way to it, yet he was almost the first one to give in, and was  with great difficulty kept awake. Buchan, most unfortunately, had a fit,  so a large fire was made at the first convenient spot, but a sailor and  the two coloured men lagged behind. During the night the sailor was heard  shouting, and was brought in to the fire, but in the morning the two  coloured men were found frozen to death. Cook attributed their death to  overindulgence in spirits, the supply for the party being left in their  charge. Not intending to remain away the night, supplies ran short, so a  vulture was shot and carefully divided amongst them, each man cooking his  own, which amounted to about three mouthfuls. At length the weather  cleared up and a start back was made, and after three hours they struck  the beach, only to find they had never been any great distance away but  had been describing a circle and came back almost to the place whence  they had started. Banks notes the vegetation as more exuberant than he  expected; the dominant colour of the flowers, white; and he collected  wild celery and scurvy grass in large quantities, which was mixed with  the food on board ship as long as it could be preserved in a wholesome  condition. Whilst at the Bay of Success the guns were lowered into the  hold so as to allow more room on deck for working the ship in the bad  weather they expected to encounter when rounding the Horn.    THE BALANCE OF THE GLOBE.    On 27th January Cape Horn was passed, but owing to fog and contrary wind  they did not approach very closely, so they were unable to fix its exact  position, but the description they were able to give of its appearance  (there is a sketch of it by Mr. Pickersgill, Master's mate, in the  Records Office), and twenty-four observations taken in the immediate  neighbourhood, settled any doubts they may have had, and Cook puts it at  55 degrees 53 minutes South, 68 degrees 13 minutes West, and Wharton  gives the corrected position as 55 degrees 58 minutes South, 67 degrees  16 minutes West. Three days after they reached their furthest south,  according to Cook 60 degrees 4 minutes South, 74 degrees 10 West, and the  course was then altered to West by North. The continuous and careful  observations of the state of the sea, and the absence of currents during  the following month, caused Cook to come to the conclusion that the vast  southern continent so long supposed to exist somewhere in that part of  the globe, and by some people esteemed necessary to preserve its balance,  was non-existent. Banks expresses his pleasure in having upset this  theory, and observes: \"Until we know how the globe is fixed in its  position, we need not be anxious about its balance.\"    The weeks following the change of the course to the north were  uneventful, only marked by an occasional success of the naturalists in  obtaining a fresh specimen, some of which were experimented on by the  cook; an albatross, skinned, soaked all night in salt water, was stewed,  served with savoury sauce, and was preferred to salt pork; a cuttle-fish  of large size, freshly killed by the birds, and too much damaged for  classification, was made into soup, of which Banks says: \"Only this I  know that, of it was made one of the best soups I ever ate.\" The water  obtained at Tierra del Fuego turned out very good: a great boon, as one  of their great troubles and a source of great anxiety to Cook was the bad  quality of the water so often obtained.    Towards the end of March a change was noticed in the kinds of birds  flying round the ship, some being recognised as ones that were known to  stay near land, and consequently a sharp look-out was kept. On the night  of the 24th a tree-trunk was reported, but when morning came nothing  further was seen. It has since been ascertained they were then a little  to the north of Pitcairn Island, afterwards the home of the mutineers of  the Bounty; but Cook did not feel himself at liberty to make any  deviation from his course \"to look for what he was not sure to find,\"  although he thought he was \"not far from those islands discovered by  Quiros in 1606.\"    On 26th march one of the marines committed suicide by drowning. It seems  he had misappropriated a piece of sealskin, and his fellow-soldiers,  indignant that such a thing should have been done by one of the cloth,  made his life uncomfortable and threatened that he should be reported for  theft. This was the fifth death since leaving England, and none by  disease.    The 4th April, at 10.30 A.M., Banks's servant, Peter Briscoe, sighted  land, and the course of the ship was altered to give them a chance of  inspecting it. It was found to be one of those peculiar circular reefs  surrounding a lagoon, called atolls, which exist in some quantity in the  Pacific. There was no anchorage, so they made no attempt to land, but  were able to see it was inhabited. Some twenty-four persons were counted  through the glasses, and were described as copper-coloured, with black  hair; they followed the ship as if prepared to oppose a landing. The reef  was covered with trees, amongst which the coconut palm was conspicuous.  Cook gave it the name of Lagoon Island; it is now known as Vahitahi, and  is one of the Low Archipelago. Being now in Wallis's track, islands were  sighted almost every day, and almost all appeared inhabited, but owing to  the want of safe anchorage, no communication could be held with the  natives.    On 10th April Osnaburg Island was passed, and next day King George Land  was sighted; but the wind failed, and they did not get close in till the  12th, when canoes came out to the ship, bringing branches of trees which  were handed up the side, with signs directing they should be placed  conspicuously in the rigging, as a token of friendship offered and  accepted. When this had been done the natives produced a good supply of  trade in the shape of vegetables and fruit; amongst the last Banks  enumerates bread-fruit, bananas, coconuts, and apples (a species of hog  plum). These were very acceptable and beneficial to the crew after such a  lapse of time without vegetable food except the wild plants gathered in  Tierra del Fuego.    AT TAHITI.    At 7 A.M. on the 13th they anchored in the bay described by Wallis, known  as Matavai, in thirteen fathoms, and Cook says of his route from Cape  Horn, \"I Endeavoured to make a direct course, and in part succeeded.\"      CHAPTER 8. 1769. SOCIETY ISLANDS.    PRODIGIOUS EXPERT THIEVES.    Hardly had the anchor reached the bottom, before they were surrounded by  canoes, whose occupants were anxious to sell the supplies of fruits, raw  and cooked fish, and a pig they had brought. The price asked for the pig  was a hatchet, and as these were scarce, it was not purchased. When all  was made safe, a party went ashore and was well received by the natives,  but those who had previously been there with Wallis reported that those  who were at that time said to be chiefs, were keeping in the background.  The next day, however, two men, evidently of rank, came on board, and  being invited into the cabin, went through a ceremony described by Banks:  \"Each singled out his friend; one took the captain, and the other chose  myself. Each took off a part of his clothes and dressed his friend with  what he took off; in return for this we presented them with a hatchet and  some beads.\" They were then invited by their new friends to go ashore. On  landing they were escorted to a building and introduced to an old man  they had not seen before, and he presented Cook with a cock, and Banks  with a hen, and each with a piece of native cloth. Banks gave in return  for his share his large laced silk neckcloth and a linen handkerchief.  After this they were permitted to stroll about, and received many tokens  of amity in the shape of green boughs, and were then entertained at a  banquet, the principal dishes being fish and bread-fruit. Whilst at  dinner, Solander had his pocket picked of an opera glass, and Monkhouse  lost his snuff-box. As soon as this was made known, Lycurgus, as they had  named one of their friends, drove off the people, striking them and  throwing anything he could lay his hand to, at them. He offered pieces of  cloth as compensation, and when these were refused, extended his offer to  everything he possessed. He was, at last, made to understand that all  that was wanted was the return of the stolen articles, and after a time  the snuff-box and the case of the glass were returned, and, by and by,  the glass itself. During the whole of the stay at the island they had the  greatest difficulties with the natives for stealing, an accomplishment at  which, Cook says, they were \"prodigious expert.\"    On the whole, their first visit ashore was satisfactory, and was thought  to augur well for the observations of the Transit. A site was selected  for a camp on the eastern point of the bay, to which the name of Point  Venus was given, the longitude, according to Cook, 149 degrees 31 minutes  West, and to Wharton, 149 degrees 29 minutes West. Lines were traced for  the boundaries, and Banks's largest tent was pitched and a guard mounted,  and then the others went for a walk of inspection. They passed through  some woods that Mr. Hicks had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10843"],[0,"The Mental Life of Monkeys and Apes: A Study of Ideational Behavior (#15)"],[1,"thirty seconds.  Previously, for the greater number of the trials, it had been ten to  fifteen seconds. This increase apparently did not disturb the monkey,  for he continued to work perfectly throughout the series, although  making many mistakes in spite of deliberate choices and the refusal of  certain boxes in each trial.    An interesting and significant incident occurred on May 13 when at the  conclusion of trial 5, Doctor Hamilton came into the experiment room for  a few minutes. Sobke immediately stopped working, and he could not be  induced to make any choices until Doctor Hamilton had left the room.  This well indicates his sensitiveness to his surroundings, and his  inclination to timidity or nervousness even in the presence of  conditions not in themselves startling.    Work was continued thus steadily until May 28 when, because of the  failure of the animal to improve, it seemed wise to increase the period  of confinement as punishment to sixty seconds. In the meantime, it had  sometimes been evident that Sobke was near to the solution of his  problem. He would often make correct choices in three or four trials in  succession and then apparently lose his cue and fail utterly for a  number of trials.    After June 1, in order to hasten the solution of the problem, two series  per day were given. In some instances the second series was given almost  immediately after the first, while in others an interval of an hour or  more intervened. It was further found desirable to give Sobke all of his  food in the apparatus. When the rewards obtained in the several trials  did not satisfy his hunger, additional food was presented, on the  completion of the series of experiments, in one or more of the food  cups. On days marked by unwillingness or refusal to work, very little  food was given. Thus, the eagerness of the monkey to locate the right  box was increased and, as a matter of observation, his deliberateness  and care in choice increased correspondingly. Sixty seconds punishment  was found satisfactory, and it was therefore continued throughout the  work on this problem.    It was evident, on June 9, from the behavior of the monkey as well as  from the score, that the perfect solution of the problem was near at  hand. This fact the experimenter recorded in his daily notes, and sure  enough, on the following day Sobke chose correctly throughout the series  of ten trials. The time for this series was only ten minutes. The  choices were made deliberately and readily.    An analysis of the data of table 5 reveals five methods or reactive  tendencies which appeared more or less definitely in the following  order: (a) Choice of first box at the left, because of experience in  problem 1. This tendency was very quickly suppressed by the requirements  in connection with problem 2. Indeed one of the most significant  differences which I have discovered between the behavior of the primates  and that of other mammals is the time required for the suppression of  such an acquired tendency. The monkey seems to learn almost immediately  that it is not worth while to persist in a tendency which although  previously profitable no longer yields satisfaction, whereas in the  crow, pig, rat, and ring dove, the unprofitable mode of response tends  to persist during a relatively large number of trials. (b) The tendency  to choose, first, a box near the left end of the group, to go from that  to the box at the extreme right end of the group, thence to the one next  in order, which was, of course, the right box. This tendency appears  fairly clearly from May 7th on. (c) The box at the extreme right was  first chosen and then the one next to it. For example, in setting 2, box  4 would be chosen first, then box 3. Or, if this did not occur, the  method previously described under (b) was likely to be employed, as for  example, in setting 8, where such choices as 7.6.5.1.8 appear. (d) In  certain series there appeared a marked preference for a particular box,  usually box 3 (see results for May 24). This was doubtless due in a  measure, if not wholly, to the fact that box 3 was the right box twice  in each series of ten settings. But it should be added that the same is  true of box 7, for which no preference was manifested at any time. (e)  Direct choice of the right box.    The five reactive methods or tendencies enumerated above roughly  appeared in the order named, but there were certain irregularities and  the order as well as the time of appearance varied somewhat from setting  to setting. In general, method c was the most frequently used prior to  the development of method e, the direct choice of the right box.
