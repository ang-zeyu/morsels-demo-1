They had some fire-arms, but made very little  use of them, as they came directly to close fighting with their spears,  lances, and sabres. Many of the invaders were mounted on small horses;  and both parties fought for about half an hour with the fiercest  animosity, exerting much more courage and perseverance than I had ever  before been witness to amongst them. The women and children of the town  clustered together to the water's edge, running shrieking up and down  with terrour, waiting the event of the combat, till their party gave  way and took to the water, to endeavour to swim over to the Barbary  side. They were closely pursued even into the river by the victors, who,  though they came for the purpose of _getting slaves_, gave no  quarter, _their cruelty even prevailing over their avarice_. They  made no prisoners, but put all to the sword without mercy. Horrible  indeed was the carnage of the vanquished on this occasion, and as we  were within two or three hundred yards of them, their cries and shrieks  affected us extremely. We had got up our anchor at the beginning of the  fray, and now stood close in to the spot, where the victors having  followed the vanquished into the water, were continually dragging out  and murdering those, whom by reason of their wounds they easily  overtook. The very children, whom they took in great numbers, did not  escape the massacre. Enraged at their barbarity, we fired our guns  loaden with grape shot, and a volley of small arms among them, which  effectually checked their ardour, and obliged them to retire to a  distance from the shore; from whence a few round cannon shot soon  removed them into the woods. The whole river was black over with the  heads of the fugitives, who were swimming for their lives. These poor  wretches, fearing _us_ as much as their conquerors, dived when we  fired, and cried most lamentably for mercy. Having now effectually  favoured their retreat, we stood backwards and forwards, and took up  several that were wounded and tired. All whose wounds had disabled them  from swimming, were either butchered or drowned, before we got up to  them. With a justice and generosity, _never I believe before heard of  among slavers_, we gave those their liberty whom we had taken up,  setting them on shore on the Barbary side, among the poor residue of  their companions, who had survived the slaughter of the morning.\"    We shall make but two remarks on this horrid instance of African  cruelty. It adds, first, a considerable weight to the statements that  have been made; and confirms, secondly, the conclusions that were drawn  in the preceding chapter. For if we even allow the right of capture to be  just, and the principles of reparation and punishment to be applicable  to the individuals of a community, yet would the former be unjust, and  the latter inapplicable, in the present case. Every African war is a  robbery; and we may add, to our former expression, when we said, \"that  thus have many thousands of men, in the most iniquitous manner, been  sent into servitude,\" that we believe there are few of this order, who  are not as much the examples of injustice, as the people that have been  kidnapped; and who do not additionally convey, when we consider them as  prisoners of war, an idea of the most complicated scene of murder.    The order of _convicts_, as it exists almost solely among those  princes, whose dominions are contiguous to the European factories, is  from this circumstance so inconsiderable, when compared with either of  the preceding, that we should not have mentioned it again, but that we  were unwilling to omit any additional argument that occurred against it.    It has been shewn already, that the punishment of slavery is inflicted  from no other motive, than that of gratifying the _avarice_ of the  prince, a confederation so detestable, as to be sufficient of itself to  prove it to be unjust; and that it is so disproportionate, from its  _nature_, to the offence, as to afford an additional proof of its  injustice. We shall add now, as a second argument, its disproportion  from its _continuance:_ and we shall derive a third from the  consideration, that, in civil society, every violation of the laws of  the community is an offence against the _state_[050].    Let us suppose then an African prince, disdaining for once the idea of  emolument: let us suppose him for once inflamed with the love of his  country, and resolving to punish from this principle alone, \"that by  exhibiting an example of terrour, he may preserve that _happiness of  the publick_, which he is bound to secure and defend by the very  nature of his contract; or, in other words, that he may answer the end  of government.\" If actuated then by this principle, he should adjudge  slavery to an offender, as a just punishment for his offence, for whose  benefit must the convict labour? If it be answered, \"for the benefit of  the state,\" we allow that the punishment, in whatever light it is  considered, will be found to be equitable: but if it be answered, \"for  the benefit of any _individual whom he pleases to appoint_,\" we  deny it to be just. The state[051] alone is considered to have been  injured, and as _injuries cannot possibly be transferred_, the  state alone can justly receive the advantages of his labour. But if the  African prince, when he thus condemns him to labour for the benefit of  an _unoffended individual_, should at the same time sentence him to  become his _property_; that is, if he should make the person and  life of the convict at the absolute disposal of him, for whom he has  sentenced him to labour; it is evident that, in addition to his former  injustice, he is usurping a power, which no ruler or rulers of a state  can possess, and which the great Creator of the universe never yet gave  to any order whatever of created beings.    That this reasoning is true, and that civilized nations have considered  it as such, will be best testified by their practice. We may appeal here  to that _slavery_, which is now adjudged to delinquents, as a  punishment, among many of the states of Europe. These delinquents are  sentenced to labour at the _oar_, to work in _mines_, and on  _fortifications_, to cut and clear _rivers_, to make and  repair _roads_, and to perform other works of national utility.  They are employed, in short, in the _publick_ work; because, as the  crimes they have committed are considered to have been crimes against  the publick, no individual can justly receive the emoluments of their  labour; and they are neither _sold_, nor made capable of being  _transferred_, because no government whatsoever is invested with  such a power.    Thus then may that slavery, in which only the idea of _labour_ is  included, be perfectly equitable, and the delinquent will always receive  his punishment as a man; whereas in that, which additionally includes  the idea of _property_, and to undergo which, the delinquent must  previously change his nature, and become a _brute_; there is an  inconsistency, which no arguments can reconcile, and a contradiction to  every principle of nature, which a man need only to appeal to his own  feelings immediately to evince. And we will venture to assert, from the  united observations that have been made upon the subject, in opposition  to any arguments that may be advanced, that there is scarcely one of  those, who are called African convicts, on whom the prince has a right  to inflict a punishment at all; and that there is no one whatever, whom  he has a power of sentencing to labour for the benefit of an unoffended  individual, and much less whom he has a right to sell.    Having now fully examined the arguments of the _sellers_[052], and  having made such additional remarks as were necessary, we have only to  add, that we cannot sufficiently express our detestation at their  conduct. Were the reader coolly to reflect upon the case of but  _one_ of the unfortunate men, who are annually the victims of  _avarice_, and consider his situation in life, as a father, an  husband, or a friend, we are sure, that even on such a partial  reflection, he must experience considerable pain. What then must be his  feelings, when he is told, that, since the slave-trade began,  [053]_nine millions_ of men have been torn from their dearest  connections, and sold into slavery. If at this recital his indignation  should arise, let him consider it as the genuine production of nature;  that she recoiled at the horrid thought, and that she applied instantly  a torch to his breast to kindle his resentment; and if, during his  indignation, she should awaken the sigh of sympathy, or seduce the tear  of commiseration from his eye, let him consider each as an additional  argument against the iniquity of the _sellers_.             *        *        *        *        *      FOOTNOTES      [Footnote 048: The total annual exportation from Africa, is estimated  here at 100,000 men, two thirds of whom are exported by the British  merchants alone. This estimate is less than that which is usually made,  and has been published. The author has been informed by disinterested  people, who were in most of the West India islands during the late war,  and who conversed with many of the most intelligent of the negroes, for  the purpose of inquiring by what methods they had originally been  reduced to slavery, that they did not find even two in twenty, who had  been reduced to that situation, by any other means than those mentioned  above. The author, desirous of a farther confirmation of this  circumstance, stopped the press till he had written to another friend,  who had resided twenty years in the West-Indies, and whose opinion he  had not yet asked. The following is an extract from the answer. \"I do  not among many hundreds recollect to have seen but one or two slaves, of  those imported "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10633"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#15)"],[1," former, saw him. Suffice it to say, that in process of  time he was cured. During this time Mr. Granville Sharp, pitying his  hard case, supplied him with money, and he afterwards got him a  situation in the family of Mr. Brown, an apothecary, to carry out  medicines.    In this new situation, when Strong had become healthy and robust in his  appearance, his master happened to see him. The latter immediately  formed the design of possessing him again. According, when he had found  out his residence, he procured John Ross, keeper of the Poultry-counter,  and William Miller, an officer under the Lord Mayor, to kidnap him. This  was done by sending for him to a public-house in Fenchurch-street, and  then seizing him. By these he was conveyed, without any warrant, to the  Poultry-counter, where he was sold by his master, to John Kerr, for  thirty pounds.    Strong, in this situation, sent, as was usual, to his godfathers, John  London and Stephen Nail, for their protections. They went, but were  refused admittance to him. At length he sent for Mr. Granville Sharp:  the latter went, but they still refused access to the prisoner. He  insisted, however, upon seeing him, and charged the keeper of the prison  at his peril to deliver him up, till he had been carried before a  magistrate.    Mr. Sharp, immediately upon this, waited upon Sir Robert Kite, the then  lord mayor, and entreated him to send for Strong and to hear his case. A  day was accordingly appointed. Mr. Sharp attended, and also William  McBean, a notary public, and David Laird, captain of the ship Thames,  which was to have conveyed Strong to Jamaica, in behalf of the  purchaser, John Kerr. A long conversation ensued, in which the opinion  of York and Talbot was quoted. Mr. Sharp made his observations. Certain  lawyers who were present seemed to be staggered at the case, but  inclined rather to recommit the prisoner: the lord mayor, however,  discharged Strong, as he had been taken up without a warrant.    As soon as this determination was made known, the parties began to move  off. Captain Laird, however, who kept close to Strong, laid hold of him  before he had quitted the room, and said aloud, \"Then I now seize him as  my slave.\" Upon this Mr. Sharp put his hand upon Laird's shoulder, and  pronounced these words: \"I charge you, in the name of the king, with an  assault upon the person of Jonathan Strong, and all these are my  witnesses.\" Laird was greatly intimidated by this charge, made in the  presence of the lord mayor and others, and, fearing a prosecution, let  his prisoner go, leaving him to be conveyed away by Mr. Sharp.    Mr. Sharp having been greatly affected by this case, and foreseeing how  much he might be engaged in others of a similar nature, thought it time  that the law of the land should be known upon this subject: he applied,  therefore, to Dr. Blackstone, afterwards Judge Blackstone, for his  opinion upon it. He was, however, not satisfied with it when he received  it; nor could he obtain any satisfactory answer from several other  lawyers, to whom he afterwards applied. The truth is that the opinion of  York and Talbot, which had been made public and acted upon by the  planters, merchants, and others, was considered of high authority, and  scarcely any one dared to question the legality of it. In this situation  Mr. Sharp saw no means of help but in his own industry, and he  determined immediately to give up two or three years to the study of the  English law, that he might the better advocate the cause of these  miserable people. The result of these studies was the publication of a  book in the year 1769, which he called, _A Representation of the  Injustice and Dangerous Tendency of Tolerating Slavery in England_. In  this work he refuted, in the clearest manner, the opinion of York and  Talbot: he produced against it the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice  Holt, who, many years before, had determined that every slave coming  into England became free: he attacked and refuted it again by a learned  and laborious inquiry into all the principles of Villenage. He refuted  it again by showing it to be an axiom in the British constitution, \"That  every man in England was free to sue for and defend his rights, and that  force could not be used without a legal process,\" leaving it to the  judges to determine whether an African was a man. He attacked also the  opinion of Judge Blackstone, and showed where his error lay. This  valuable book, containing these and other kinds of arguments on the  subject, he distributed, but particularly among the lawyers, giving them  an opportunity of refuting or acknowledging the doctrines it contained.    While Mr. Sharp was engaged in this work, another case offered, in which  he took a part: this was in the year 1768. Hylas, an African slave,  prosecuted a person of the name of Newton for having kidnapped his wife,  and sent her to the West Indies. The result of the trial was, that  damages to the amount of a shilling were given, and the defendant was  bound to bring back the woman, either by the first ship, or in six  months from this decision of the court.    But soon after the work just mentioned was out, and when Mr. Sharp was  better prepared, a third case occurred: this happened in the year 1770.  Robert Stapylton, who lived at Chelsea, in conjunction with John Malony  and Edward Armstrong, two watermen, seized the person of Thomas Lewis,  an African slave, in a dark night, and dragged him to a boat lying in  the Thames; they then gagged him and tied him with a cord, and rowed him  down to a ship, and put him on board to be sold as a slave in Jamaica.  This base action took place near the garden of Mrs. Banks, the mother of  the late Sir Joseph Banks. Lewis, it appears, on being seized, screamed  violently. The servants of Mrs. Banks, who heard his cries, ran to his  assistance, but the boat was gone. On informing their mistress of what  had happened, she sent for Mr. Sharp, who began now to be known as the  friend of the helpless Africans, and professed her willingness to incur  the expense of bringing the delinquents to justice. Mr. Sharp, with some  difficulty, procured a _habeas corpus_, in consequence of which Lewis  was brought from Gravesend just as the vessel was on the point of  sailing. An action was then commenced against Stapylton, who defended  himself on the plea, \"That Lewis belonged to him as his slave.\" In the  course of the trial, Mr. Dunning, who was counsel for Lewis, paid Mr.  Sharp a handsome compliment; for he held in his hand Mr. Sharp's book,  on the _Injustice and Dangerous Tendency of Tolerating Slavery in  England_, while he was pleading; and in his address to the jury he spoke  and acted thus:--\"I shall submit to you,\" says Mr. Dunning, \"what my  ideas are upon such evidence, reserving to myself an opportunity of  discussing it more particularly, and reserving to myself a right to  insist upon a position, which I will maintain (and here he held up the  book to the notice of those present,) in any place and in any court of  the kingdom, that our laws admit of no such property[A].\" The result of  the trial was, that the jury pronounced the plaintiff not to have been  the property of the defendant, several of them crying out, \"No property,  no property.\"    [Footnote A: It is lamentable to think that the same Mr. Dunning, in a  cause of this kind, which came on afterwards, took the opposite side of  the question.]    After this one or two other trials came on, in which the oppressor was  defeated, and several cases occurred in which poor slaves were liberated  from the holds of vessels and other places of confinement, by the  exertions of Mr. Sharp. One of these cases was singular. The vessels on  board which a poor African had been dragged and confined, had reached  the Downs, and had actually got under weigh for the West Indies: in two  or three hours she would have been out of sight; but just at this  critical moment the writ of _habeas corpus_ was carried on board. The  officer who served it on the captain saw the miserable African chained  to the mainmast, bathed in tears, and casting a last mournful look on  the land of freedom, which was fast receding from his sight. The  captain, on receiving the writ, became outrageous; but knowing the  serious consequences of resisting the law of the land, he gave up his  prisoner, whom the officer carried safe, but now crying for joy, to the  shore.    But though the injured Africans, whose causes had been tried, escaped  slavery, and though many who had been forcibly carried into dungeons,  ready to be transported into the Colonies, had been delivered out of  them, Mr. Sharp was not easy in his mind: not one of the cases had yet  been pleaded on the broad ground, \"Whether an African slave, coming into  England, became free?\" This great question had been hitherto studiously  avoided; it was still, therefore, left in doubt. Mr. Sharp was almost  daily acting as if it had been determined, and as if he had been  following the known law of the land: he wished, therefore, that the next  cause might be argued upon this principle. Lord Mansfield too, who had  been biassed by the opinion of York and Talbot, began to waver in  consequence of the different pleadings he had heard on this subject: he  saw also no end of trials like these, till the law should be  ascertained, and he was anxious for a decision on the same basis as Mr.  Sharp. In this situation the following case offered, which was agreed  upon for the determination of this important question.    James Somerset, an African slave, had been brought to England by his  master, Charles Stewart, in November 1769. Somerset in process of time  left him. Stewart took an opportunity of seizing him, and had him  conveyed on board the Ann and Mary, Captain Knowles, to be carried out  of the kingdom and sold as a slave in Jamaica: the question was,  \"Whether a slave, by coming into"]]]
