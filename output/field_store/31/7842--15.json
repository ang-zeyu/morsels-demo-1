[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#15)"],[1,"sequence: Lord M. would have  to leave her; and the daily, the hourly, presence of Lord M. had become  an integral part of her life. Six months after her accession she had  noted in her diary \"I shall be very sorry to lose him even for one  night;\" and this feeling of personal dependence on her Minister steadily  increased. In these circumstances it was natural that she should have  become a Whig partisan. Of the wider significance of political questions  she knew nothing; all she saw was that her friends were in office and  about her, and that it would be dreadful if they ceased to be so. \"I  cannot say,\" she wrote when a critical division was impending, \"(though  I feel confident of our success) how low, how sad I feel, when I think  of the possibility of this excellent and truly kind man not remaining my  Minister! Yet I trust fervently that He who has so wonderfully protected  me through such manifold difficulties will not now desert me! I should  have liked to have expressed to Lord M. my anxiety, but the tears were  nearer than words throughout the time I saw him, and I felt I should  have choked, had I attempted to say anything.\" Lord Melbourne  realised clearly enough how undesirable was such a state of mind in  a constitutional sovereign who might be called upon at any moment to  receive as her Ministers the leaders of the opposite party; he did what  he could to cool her ardour; but in vain.    With considerable lack of foresight, too, he had himself helped to bring  about this unfortunate condition of affairs. From the moment of her  accession, he had surrounded the Queen with ladies of his own party; the  Mistress of the Robes and all the Ladies of the Bedchamber were Whigs.  In the ordinary course, the Queen never saw a Tory: eventually she took  pains never to see one in any circumstances. She disliked the whole  tribe; and she did not conceal the fact. She particularly disliked Sir  Robert Peel, who would almost certainly be the next Prime Minister.  His manners were detestable, and he wanted to turn out Lord M. His  supporters, without exception, were equally bad; and as for Sir James  Graham, she could not bear the sight of him; he was exactly like Sir  John Conroy.    The affair of Lady Flora intensified these party rumours still further.  The Hastings were Tories, and Lord Melbourne and the Court were attacked  by the Tory press in unmeasured language. The Queen's sectarian  zeal proportionately increased. But the dreaded hour was now fast  approaching. Early in May the Ministers were visibly tottering; on a  vital point of policy they could only secure a majority of five in the  House of Commons; they determined to resign. When Victoria heard the  news she burst into tears. Was it possible, then, that all was over? Was  she, indeed, about to see Lord M. for the last time? Lord M. came; and  it is a curious fact that, even in this crowning moment of misery and  agitation, the precise girl noted, to the minute, the exact time of the  arrival and the departure of her beloved Minister. The conversation was  touching and prolonged; but it could only end in one way--the Queen must  send for the Duke of Wellington. When, next morning, the Duke came, he  advised her Majesty to send for Sir Robert Peel. She was in \"a state of  dreadful grief,\" but she swallowed down her tears, and braced herself,  with royal resolution, for the odious, odious interview.    Peel was by nature reserved, proud, and shy. His manners were not  perfect, and he knew it; he was easily embarrassed, and, at such  moments, he grew even more stiff and formal than before, while his  feet mechanically performed upon the carpet a dancing-master's measure.  Anxious as he now was to win the Queen's good graces, his very anxiety  to do so made the attainment of his object the more difficult. He  entirely failed to make any headway whatever with the haughty hostile  girl before him. She coldly noted that he appeared to be unhappy and  \"put out,\" and, while he stood in painful fixity, with an occasional  uneasy pointing of the toe, her heart sank within her at the sight of  that manner, \"Oh! how different, how dreadfully different, to the  frank, open, natural, and most kind warm manner of Lord Melbourne.\"  Nevertheless, the audience passed without disaster. Only at one point  had there been some slight hint of a disagreement. Peel had decided that  a change would be necessary in the composition of the royal Household:  the Queen must no longer be entirely surrounded by the wives and sisters  of his opponents; some, at any rate, of the Ladies of the Bedchamber  should be friendly to his Government. When this matter was touched  upon, the Queen had intimated that she wished her Household to remain  unchanged; to which Sir Robert had replied that the question could be  settled later, and shortly afterwards withdrew to arrange the details of  his Cabinet. While he was present, Victoria had remained, as she herself  said, \"very much collected, civil and high, and betrayed no agitation;\"  but as soon as she was alone she completely broke down. Then she pulled  herself together to write to Lord Melbourne an account of all that had  happened, and of her own wretchedness. \"She feels,\" she said, \"Lord  Melbourne will understand it, amongst enemies to those she most relied  on and most esteemed; but what is worst of all is the being deprived of  seeing Lord Melbourne as she used to do.\"    Lord Melbourne replied with a very wise letter. He attempted to calm the  Queen and to induce her to accept the new position gracefully; and he  had nothing but good words for the Tory leaders. As for the question of  the Ladies of the Household, the Queen, he said, should strongly urge  what she desired, as it was a matter which concerned her personally,  \"but,\" he added, \"if Sir Robert is unable to concede it, it will not do  to refuse and to put off the negotiation upon it.\" On this point there  can be little doubt that Lord Melbourne was right. The question was  a complicated and subtle one, and it had never arisen before; but  subsequent constitutional practice has determined that a Queen Regnant  must accede to the wishes of her Prime Minister as to the personnel of  the female part of her Household. Lord Melbourne's wisdom, however, was  wasted. The Queen would not be soothed, and still less would she take  advice. It was outrageous of the Tories to want to deprive her of her  Ladies, and that night she made up her mind that, whatever Sir Robert  might say, she would refuse to consent to the removal of a single one  of them. Accordingly, when, next morning, Peel appeared again, she was  ready for action. He began by detailing the Cabinet appointments, and  then he added \"Now, ma'am, about the Ladies-\" when the Queen sharply  interrupted him. \"I cannot give up any of my Ladies,\" she said. \"What,  ma'am!\" said Sir Robert, \"does your Majesty mean to retain them all?\"  \"All,\" said the Queen. Sir Robert's face worked strangely; he could not  conceal his agitation. \"The Mistress of the Robes and the Ladies of  the Bedchamber?\" he brought out at last. \"All,\" replied once more her  Majesty. It was in vain that Peel pleaded and argued; in vain that  he spoke, growing every moment more pompous and uneasy, of the  constitution, and Queens Regnant, and the public interest; in vain that  he danced his pathetic minuet. She was adamant; but he, too, through all  his embarrassment, showed no sign of yielding; and when at last he left  her nothing had been decided--the whole formation of the Government was  hanging in the wind. A frenzy of excitement now seized upon Victoria.  Sir Robert, she believed in her fury, had tried to outwit her, to take  her friends from her, to impose his will upon her own; but that was  not all: she had suddenly perceived, while the poor man was moving so  uneasily before her, the one thing that she was desperately longing  for--a loop-hole of escape. She seized a pen and dashed off a note to  Lord Melbourne.    \"Sir Robert has behaved very ill,\" she wrote, \"he insisted on my giving  up my Ladies, to which I replied that I never would consent, and I never  saw a man so frightened... I was calm but very decided, and I think  you would have been pleased to see my composure and great firmness;  the Queen of England will not submit to such trickery. Keep yourself in  readiness, for you may soon be wanted.\" Hardly had she finished when the  Duke of Wellington was announced. \"Well, Ma'am,\" he said as he entered,  \"I am very sorry to find there is a difficulty.\" \"Oh!\" she instantly  replied, \"he began it, not me.\" She felt that only one thing now was  needed: she must be firm. And firm she was. The venerable conqueror  of Napoleon was outfaced by the relentless equanimity of a girl in her  teens. He could not move the Queen one inch. At last, she even ventured  to rally him. \"Is Sir Robert so weak,\" she asked, \"that even the Ladies  must be of his opinion?\" On which the Duke made a brief and humble  expostulation, bowed low, and departed.    Had she won? Time would show; and in the meantime she scribbled down  another letter. \"Lord Melbourne must not think the Queen rash in her  conduct... The Queen felt this was an attempt to see whether she could  be led and managed like a child.\"(*) The Tories were not only wicked but  ridiculous. Peel, having, as she understood, expressed a wish to remove  only those members of the Household who were in Parliament, now objected  to her Ladies. \"I should like to know,\" she exclaimed in triumphant  scorn, \"if they mean to give the Ladies seats in Parliament?\"         (*) The exclamation \"They wished to treat me like a girl,       but I will show them that I am Queen of England!\" often       quoted as the Queen's, is apocryphal. It is merely part of       Greville's summary of the two letters to Melbourne. It may       be noted that the phrase \"the Queen of England will not       submit to such trickery\" is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12655"],[0,"The Boy Mechanic, Volume 1: 700 Things for Boys to Do (#15)"],[1,"[50]    An electric-light circuit will be found much less expensive than  batteries for performing electrical experiments. The sketch shows  how a small arc light and motor may be connected to the light  socket, A. The light is removed and a plug with wire connections  is put in its place. One wire runs to the switch, B, and the other  connects with the water rheostat, which is used for reducing the  current.    [Illustration: Arc-Light Motor and Water Rheostat]    A tin can, C is filled nearly to the top with salt water, and a  metal rod, D, is passed through a piece of wood fastened at the  top of the can. When the metal rod is lowered the current  increases, and as it is withdrawn the current grows weaker. In  this way the desired amount of current can be obtained.    By connecting the motor, E, and the arc light, F, as shown, either  one may be operated by turning switch B to the corresponding  point. The arc light is easily made by fastening two electric  light carbons in a wooden frame like that shown. To start the  light, turn the current on strong and bring the points of the  carbons together; then separate slightly by twisting the upper  carbon and at the same time drawing it through the hole.        ** How to Make an Interrupter [51]    The Wenult interrupter is an instrument much used on large coils  and is far more efficient than the usual    [Illustration: Details of Interrupter]    form of vibrators. It can also be used with success on small coils  as well as large. Although it is a costly instrument to purchase,  it can be made with practically no expense and the construction is  very simple.    First procure a wide-mouthed bottle about 4 in. high, provided  with a rubber stopper. This stopper should be pierced, making two  holes about 1/4 in. in diameter. From a sheet of lead 1/16 in. in  thickness    [Illustration: The Completed Instrument]    cut a piece shaped like A, Fig. 1. Common tea lead folded several  times will serve the purpose. When in the bottle this lead should  be of such a size that it will only reach half way around, as  shown in B. To insert the lead plate, roll it up so it will pass  through the neck of the bottle, then smooth it out with a small  stick until it fits against the side, leaving the small strip at  the top projecting through the neck of the bottle. Bend this strip  to one side and fit in the stopper, as shown in C. A small  binding-post is fastened at the end of the strip.    Having fixed the lead plate in position, next get a piece of glass  tube having a bore of about 1/32 of an inch in diameter. A piece  of an old thermometer tube will serve this purpose. Insert this  tube in the hole in the stopper farthest from the lead plate. Get  a piece of wire that will fit the tube and about 6 in. long, and  fasten a small binding-post on one end and stick the other into  the tube. This wire should fit the hole in the tube so it can be  easily moved. In the hole nearest the lead plate insert a small  glass funnel.    The interrupter as it is when complete is shown at D, Fig. 1.  Having finished the interrupter, connect it with the  electric-light circuit as shown in Fig. 2. Fill the bottle with  water to about the line as shown in D, Fig. 1. Adjust the wire in  the small glass tube so that it projects about 1/8 in. Add  sulphuric acid until the water level rises about 1/16 in. Turn on  the current and press the button, B. If all adjustments are  correct, there will be a loud crackling noise from the  interrupter, a violet flame will appear at the end of the wire and  a hot spark will pass between the secondary terminals. If the  interrupter does not work at first, add more sulphuric acid  through the funnel and press the wire down a little more into the  liquid. A piece of wood, A, Fig. 2, should be inserted in vibrator  to prevent it from working.  --Contributed by Harold L. Jones, Carthage, N. Y.        ** A Miniature \"Pepper's Ghost\" Illusion [52]    Probably many readers have seen a \"Pepper's Ghost\" illusion at  some amusement place. As there shown, the audience is generally  seated in a dark room at the end of which there is a stage with  black hangings. One of the audience is invited onto the stage,  where he is placed in an upright open    [Illustration: Pepper's Ghost]    coffin. A white shroud is thrown over his body, and his clothes  and flesh gradually fade away till nothing but his skeleton  remains, which immediately begins to dance a horrible rattling  jig. The skeleton then fades away and the man is restored again.    A simple explanation is given in the Model Engineer. Between the  audience and the coffin is a sheet of transparent glass, inclined  at an angle so as to reflect objects located behind the scenes,  but so clear as to be invisible to the audience and the man in the  coffin. At the beginning the stage is lighted only from behind the  glass. Hence the coffin and its occupant are seen through the  glass very plainly. The lights in front of the glass (behind the  scenes) are now raised very gradually as those behind the glass  are turned down, until it is dark there. The perfectly black  surface behind the glass now acts like the silver backing for a  mirror, and the object upon which the light is now turned--in this  case the skeleton--is reflected in the glass, appearing to the  audience as if really occupying the stage.    The model, which requires no special skill except that of  carpentry, is constructed as shown in the drawings.    The box containing the stage should be 14 in. by 7 in. by 7-1/2  in., inside dimensions. The box need not be made of particularly  good wood, as the entire interior, with the exception of the  glass, figures and lights, should be colored a dull black. This  can well be done by painting with a solution of lampblack in  turpentine. If everything is not black, especially the joints and  background near A, the illusion will be spoiled.    The glass should be the clearest possible, and must be thoroughly  cleansed. Its edges should nowhere be visible, and it should be  free from scratches and imperfections. The figure A should be a  doll about 4 in. high, dressed in brilliant, light-colored  garments. The skeleton is made of papier mache, and can be bought  at Japanese stores. It should preferably be one with arms  suspended by small spiral springs, giving a limp, loose-jointed  effect. The method of causing the skeleton to dance is shown in  the front view. The figure is hung from the neck by a blackened  stiff wire attached to the hammer wire of an electric bell, from  which the gong has been removed. When the bell works he will kick  against the rear wall, and wave his arms up and down, thus giving  as realistic a dance as anyone, could expect from a skeleton.    The lights, L and M, should be miniature electric lamps, which can  be run by three dry cells. They need to give a fairly strong  light, especially L, which should have a conical tin reflector to  increase its brilliancy and prevent its being reflected in the  glass.    Since the stage should be some distance from the audience, to aid  the illusion, the angle of the glass and the inclination of the  doll, A, has been so designed that if the stage is placed on a  mantle or other high shelf, the image of A will appear upright to  an observer sitting in a chair some distance away, within the  limits of an ordinary room. If it is desired to place the box  lower down, other angles for the image and glass may be found  necessary, but the proper tilt can be found readily by experiment.    The electric connections are so simple that they are not shown in  the drawings. All that is necessary is a two-point switch, by  which either L or M can be placed in circuit with the battery, and  a press button in circuit with the bell and its cell.    If a gradual transformation is desired, a double-pointed rheostat  could be used, so that as one light dims the other increases in  brilliancy, by the insertion and removal of resistance coils.    With a clear glass and a dark room this model has proved to be  fully as bewildering as its prototype.        ** Experiment with Colored Electric Lamps [53]    To many the following experiment may be much more easily performed  than explained: Place the hand or other object in the light coming  from two incandescent lamps, one red and    [Illustration: Two-Colored Hand]    one white, placed about a foot apart, and allow the shadow to fall  on a white screen such as a table-cloth. Portions of the shadow  will then appear to be a bright green. A similar experiment  consists in first turning on the red light for about a minute and  then turning it off at the same time that the white one is turned  on. The entire screen will then appear to be a vivid green for  about one second, after which it assumes its normal color.        ** To Explode Powder with Electricity [53]    A 1-in. hole was bored in the center of a 2-in. square block. Two  finishing nails were driven in, as shown in the sketch. These were  connected to terminals of an induction coil. After everything was  ready the powder was poured in the hole and a board weighted with  rocks placed over the block. When the button is pressed    [Illustration: Exploding Powder]    or the circuit closed in some other way the discharge occurs. The  distance between the nail points--which must be bright and  clean--should be just enough to give a good, fat spark.  --Contributed by Geo. W.
