[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14473"],[0,"Birds of Guernsey (1879) (#15)"],[1,"I was there, which was some time.    Professor Ansted includes the Crow in his list, but only marks it as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There is no specimen in the Museum.      78. HOODED CROW. _Corvus cornix_, Linnaeus. French, \"Corbeau mantele,\"  \"Corneille mantelee.\"--The Hooded Crow can only be considered an  occasional autumnal and winter visitant. I have never seen it myself in  the Islands, though many of my visits to Guernsey have been in the  autumn. Mr. Couch, however, reports a small flock of Hooded Crows being  in Guernsey in November, 1873, one of which was obtained. Mr. MacCulloch  writes me word that the Hooded Crow is a very rare visitant, and only,  as far as he knows, in very cold weather; and he adds--\"It is strange  that we should see it so rarely, as it is very common about St. Maloes.\"  Colonel l'Estrange, however, informed me that one remained in Sark all  last summer--that of 1877--and paired with a common Crow,[13] but we  could see nothing of the couple this year. I believe it is not at all  uncommon for these birds to pair in Scotland and other places where both  species are numerous in the breeding-season, but this is the only  instance I have heard of in the Channel Islands--in fact, it is the only  time I have heard of the Hooded Crow remaining on till the summer.    The Hooded Crow is included in Professor Ansted's list, and marked as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark; and there are two specimens in the  Museum.      79. ROOK. _Corvus frugilegus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Freux\", \"Corbeau  Freux.\"--I have never seen the Rook in the Islands myself, even as a  stranger, but Mr. Gallienne in his notes to Professor Ansted's list,  says, speaking of Guernsey, \"The Rook has tried two or three times to  colonise, but in vain, having been destroyed or frightened away.\" Mr.  MacCulloch also writes me word much to the same effect, as he says \"I  have known Rooks occasionally attempt to build here (Guernsey), but they  are invariably disturbed by boys and guns, and driven off. They  sometimes arrive here in large flocks in severe winters.\"    The Rook is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list as occurring in  Guernsey only, and there are two specimens in the Museum, both probably  Guernsey killed.      80. MAGPIE. _Pica rustica_, Scopoli. French, \"Pie\", \"Pie  ordinaire.\"--The Magpie is resident and tolerably common in Guernsey,  breeding in several parts of the Island; it is also resident, but I  think not quite so common, in Sark. I do not remember having seen it in  Alderney, and the almost entire absence of trees would probably prevent  it being anything more than an occasional visitant to that Island.    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, but marked as only occurring  in Guernsey; and there are two specimens in the Museum.      81. LESSER SPOTTED WOODPECKER. _Picus minor_, Linnaeus. French, \"Pie  epeichette.\"--As may be expected, the Woodpeckers are not strongly  represented in the Islands, and the present species, the Lesser Spotted  Woodpecker, is the only one as to the occurrence of which I can get any  satisfactory evidence.    Professor Ansted, however, includes the Greater Spotted Woodpecker in  his list, and marks it as occurring in Guernsey only; and there is one  specimen of the Green Woodpecker, _Gecinus viridis_, in the Museum, but  there is no note whatever as to its locality; so under these  circumstances I have not thought it right to include either species. But  as to the occurrence of the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, though I have not  seen it myself, nor have I a Channel Island specimen, I have some more  evidence; for in reply to some questions of mine on the subject, Mr.  Couch wrote to me in April, 1877, \"Respecting the Woodpecker, you may  fully rely on the Lesser Spotted as having been shot here, four examples  having passed through my hands; and writing from memory I will, as near  as possible, tell you when and where they were shot. I took a shop here  in 1866. In the month of August, 1867, there was one brought to me  alive, shot in the water lanes, just under Smith's Nursery by a young  gent at the College; he wounded it in the wing. I wanted too much to  stuff it (2s. 6d.); he took the poor bird out, fixed it somewhere; he  and his companions fired at it so often they blew it to atoms. The same  year, early in September, one was shot at St. Martin's; I stuffed that  for a lady: there were four in the same tree; the day following they  were not to be found. The second week in October, the same year I had  one, and stuffed it for the person who shot it out at St. Saviour's;  there were two besides in the same tree, but I had neither one myself.  In 1868, I stuffed one that was shot at St. Peter's, in December; it was  taken home the Christmas Eve. These were all I have had, but I have  heard of their being seen about since, twice or three times.\" In  addition to this letter, which I have no reason to doubt, Mr. MacCulloch  wrote me word--\"We have in the Museum a Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, shot  near Havilland Hall, in November, 1855; I saw it before it was stuffed.\"  This bird was not in the Museum this year, (1878), as I looked  everywhere for it, so I suppose it was moth-eaten and thrown away, like  many others of the best specimens in the Museum, after the years of  neglect they have been subject to. From these letters, there can be no  doubt whatever that the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker has been occasionally  procured in Guernsey, and that it may be considered either an occasional  autumnal visitant, remaining on into winter, or, what is more probable,  a thinly-scattered resident.    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, and marked as only occurring  in Guernsey. As above stated, the specimen formerly in the Museum no  longer exists.      82. WRYNECK. _Yunx torquilla_, Linnaeus. French, \"Torcol  ordinaire.\"--The Wryneck, or, as it is called in Guernsey-French,  \"Parle\"[14] is generally a numerous summer visitant to the Islands,  arriving in considerable numbers, about the same time as the mackerel,  wherefore it has also obtained the local name of \"Mackerel Bird.\" It is  generally distributed through the Islands, remaining through the summer  to breed, and departing again in early autumn, August, or September. Its  numbers, however, vary considerably in different years, as in some  summers I have seen Wrynecks in almost every garden, hedgerow, or thick  bush in the Island; always when perched, sitting across the branches or  twigs, on which they were perched, and never longways or climbing, as  would be the case with a Woodpecker or Creeper; and the noise made by  the birds during the breeding-season, was, in some years, incessant;  this was particularly the case in the early part of the summer of 1866,  when the birds were very numerous, and the noise made was so great that  on one occasion I was told that the Mackerel Birds seriously interrupted  a scientific game of _Croquet_, which was going on at Fort George, by  the noise they made; I can quite believe it, as, though I was not  playing in the game, I heard the birds very noisy in other parts of the  Island. This last summer, however (1878), I saw very few Wrynecks--only  four or five during the whole of the two months I was in the Islands,  and hardly heard them at all.    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked as occurring  in Guernsey and Sark. There are two specimens in the Museum.      83. HOOPOE. _Upupa Epops_, Linnaeus. French, \"La Huppe,\" \"Huppe  ordinaire.\"--The Hoopoe, as may be supposed from its geographical range  and from its frequent occurrence in various parts of England, is an  occasional visitant to the Channel Islands during the seasons of  migration, occurring both in spring and autumn with sufficient frequency  to have gained the name of \"Tuppe\" in Guernsey-French. Though occurring  in spring and autumn, I am not aware that it ever remains to breed,  though perhaps it might do so if not shot on every possible occasion.  This shooting of every straggler to the Channel Islands is a great pity,  especially with the spring arrivals, as some of them might well be  expected to remain to breed occasionally if left undisturbed; and the  proof of the Hoopoe breeding in the Channel Islands would be much more  interesting than the mere possession of a specimen of so common and  well-known a bird: if a local specimen should be wanted, it could be  obtained equally well in autumn, when there would be no question as to  the breeding. The autumn arrivals seem also to be most numerous, at  least judging from the specimens recorded during the last four or five  years, as Mr. Couch records one, a female, shot near Ronseval, in  Guernsey, on the 26th of September; and another also in Guernsey, shot  on the 23rd of September; I have one, obtained in Alderney in August,  though I have not the exact date; and another picked up in a lane in St.  Martin's parish, in Guernsey, on the 24th of August. During the same  time I only know of one spring occurrence; that was on April the 10th of  this year (1878), when two were seen, and one shot in Herm, as recorded  in the 'Star' newspaper, for April the 13th; this one I saw soon  afterwards at Mr. Jago's, the bird-stuffer. These birds were probably  paired, and would therefore very likely have bred in Herm, had one of  them not been shot, and the other accordingly driven to look for a mate  elsewhere. It would pay, as well as be interesting, as I remarked in a  note to the 'Star' in reference to this occurrence of the pair of  Hoopoe's, to encourage these birds to breed in the Islands whenever they  shewed a disposition to do so, as, though rather a foul-feeder and of  unsavoury habits in its nest, and having no respect for sanitary  arrangements, the Hoopoe is nevertheless one of the most useful birds in  the garden.    The Hoopoe is included in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There are now"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#15)"],[1,"else which you have not yet  examined. We have collected the water, but have allowed the other things  to go into the air. Let us now examine some of these other products.    Here is an experiment which I think will help you in part in this way. We  will put our candle there, and place over it a chimney, thus. I think my  candle will go on burning, because the air-passage is open at the bottom  and the top. In the first place, you see the moisture appearing--that you  know about. It is water produced from the candle by the action of the air  upon its hydrogen. But, besides that, something is going out at the top:  it is not moisture--it is not water--it is not condensible; and yet, after  all, it has very singular properties. You will find that the air coming  out of the top of our chimney is nearly sufficient to blow the light out I  am holding to it; and if I put the light fairly opposed to the current, it  will blow it quite out. You will say that is as it should be; and I am  supposing that you think it ought to do so, because the nitrogen does not  support combustion, and ought to put the candle out, since the candle will  not burn in nitrogen.    [Illustration: Fig. 29.]    But is there nothing else there than nitrogen? I must now anticipate--that  is to say, I must use my own knowledge to supply you with the means that  we adopt for the purpose of ascertaining these things, and examining such  gases as these. I will take an empty bottle--here is one--and if I hold it  over this chimney, I shall get the combustion of the candle below sending  its results into the bottle above; and we shall soon find that this bottle  contains, not merely an air that is bad as regards the combustion of a  taper put into it, but having other properties.    Let me take a little quick-lime and pour some common water on to it--the  commonest water will do. I will stir it a moment, then pour it upon a  piece of filtering paper in a funnel, and we shall very quickly have a  clear water proceeding to the bottle below, as I have here. I have plenty  of this water in another bottle; but, nevertheless, I should like to use  the lime-water that was prepared before you, so that you may see what its  uses are. If I take some of this beautiful clear lime-water, and pour it  into this jar, which has collected the air from the candle, you will see a  change coming about. Do you see that the water has become quite milky?  Observe, that will not happen with air merely. Here is a bottle filled  with air; and if I put a little lime-water into it, neither the oxygen nor  the nitrogen, nor anything else that is in that quantity of air, will make  any change in the lime-water. It remains perfectly clear, and no shaking  of that quantity of lime-water with that quantity of air in its common  state will cause any change; but if I take this bottle with the  lime-water, and hold it so as to get the general products of the candle in  contact with it, in a very short time we shall have it milky. There is the  chalk, consisting of the lime which we used in making the lime-water,  combined with something that came from the candle--that other product  which we are in search of, and which I want to tell you about to-day. This  is a substance made visible to us by its action, which is not the action  of the lime-water either upon the oxygen or upon the nitrogen, nor upon  the water itself, but it is something new to us from the candle. And then  we find this white powder, produced by the lime-water and the vapour from  the candle, appears to us very much like whitening or chalk, and, when  examined, it does prove to be exactly the same substance as whitening or  chalk. So we are led, or have been led, to observe upon the various  circumstances of this experiment, and to trace this production of chalk to  its various causes, to give us the true knowledge of the nature of this  combustion of the candle--to find that this substance, issuing from the  candle, is exactly the same as that substance which would issue from a  retort, if I were to put some chalk into it with a little moisture, and  make it red-hot: you would then find that exactly the same substance would  issue from it as from the candle.    But we have a better means of getting this substance, and in greater  quantity, so as to ascertain what its general characters are. We find this  substance in very great abundance in a multitude of cases where you would  least expect it. All limestones contain a great deal of this gas which  issues from the candle, and which we call _carbonic acid_. All chalks, all  shells, all corals contain a great quantity of this curious air. We find  it fixed in these stones; for which reason Dr. Black called it \"fixed  air\"--finding it in these fixed things like marble and chalk. He called it  fixed air, because it lost its quality of air, and assumed the condition  of a solid body. We can easily get this air from marble.  Here is a jar  containing a little muriatic acid, and here is a taper which, if I put it  into that jar, will shew only the presence of common air. There is, you  see, pure air down to the bottom; the jar is full of it  Here is a  substance--marble[17], a very beautiful and superior marble--and if I put  these pieces of marble into the jar, a great boiling apparently goes on.  That, however, is not steam--it is a gas that is rising up; and if I now  search the jar by a candle, I shall have exactly the same effect produced  upon the taper as I had from the air which issued from the end of the  chimney over the burning candle. It is exactly the same action, and caused  by the very same substance that issued from the candle; and in this way we  can get carbonic acid in great abundance--we have already nearly filled  the jar.  We also find that this gas is not merely contained in marble.  Here is a vessel in which I have put some common whitening--chalk, which  has been washed in water and deprived of its coarser particles, and so  supplied to the plasterer as whitening.  Here is a large jar containing  this whitening and water, and I have here some strong sulphuric acid,  which is the acid you might have to use if you were to make these  experiments (only, in using this acid with limestone, the body that is  produced is an insoluble substance, whereas the muriatic acid produces a  soluble substance that does not so much thicken the water). And you will  seek out a reason why I take this kind of apparatus for the purpose of  shewing this experiment. I do it because you may repeat in a small way  what I am about to do in a large one. You will have here just the same  kind of action; and I am evolving in this large jar carbonic acid, exactly  the same in its nature and properties as the gas which we obtained from  the combustion of the candle in the atmosphere. And no matter how  different the two methods by which we prepare this carbonic acid, you will  see, when we get to the end of our subject, that it is all exactly the  same, whether prepared in the one way or in the other.    We will now proceed to the next experiment with regard to this gas. What  is its nature? Here is one of the vessels full, and we will try it, as we  have done so many other gases, by combustion. You see it is not  combustible, nor does it support combustion. Neither, as we know, does it  dissolve much in water, because we collect it over water very easily.  Then, you know that it has an effect, and becomes white in contact with  lime-water; and when it does become white in that way, it becomes one of  the constituents to make carbonate of lime or limestone.    The next thing I must shew you is, that it really does dissolve a little  in water, and  therefore that it is unlike oxygen and hydrogen in that  respect I have here an apparatus by which we can produce this solution. In  the lower part of this apparatus is marble and acid, and in the upper part  cold water. The valves are so arranged that the gas can get from one to  the other. I will set it in action now, and you can see the gas bubbling  up through the water, as it has been doing all night long, and by this  time we shall find that we have this substance dissolved in the water. If  I take a glass and draw off some of the water, I find that it tastes a  little acid to the mouth: it is impregnated with carbonic acid; and if I  now apply a little lime-water to it, that will give us a test of its  presence. This water will make the lime-water turbid and white, which is  proof of the presence of carbonic acid.    Then it is a very weighty gas--it is heavier than the atmosphere. I have  put their respective weights at the lower part of this table, along with,  for comparison, the weights of the other gases we have been examining:--                           Pint.      Cubic Foot.  Hydrogen, .  .  .  .  3/4 grains. 1/12 ounce.  Oxygen,   .  .  .  .  11-9/10 \"   1-1/2  \"  Nitrogen, .  .  .  .  10-1/10 \"   1-1/4  \"  Air,.  .  .  .  .  .  10-7/16 \"   1-3/8  \"  Carbonic acid,  .  .  16-1/3  \"   1-9/10 \"    A pint of it weighs 16-1/3 grains, and a cubic foot weighs 1-9/10 ounce,  almost two ounces. You can see by many experiments that this is a heavy  gas. Suppose I take a glass containing nothing else but air, and from this  vessel containing the carbonic acid I attempt to pour a little of this gas  into that glass; I wonder whether any has gone in or not. I cannot tell by  the appearance, but I can in this way [introducing the taper]. Yes, there  it is, you see; and if I were to examine it by lime-water, I should find  it by that test also. I will take this little bucket, and put it down into  the well of carbonic acid--indeed, we too often have real wells of  carbonic acid--and now, if there is any carbonic acid, I must have got to  it by this time, and it will be in this bucket, which we will examine with  a taper. There it is, you see; it is full of carbonic acid.    [Illustration: Fig. 30.]    There is another"]]]
