Needless to say the Natives did not see their way to agree  with such a one-sided bargain.  They moved up country, but only to find  the next farmer offering the same terms, however, with a good many more  disturbing details -- and the next farmer and the next --  so that after this native farmer had wandered from farm to farm,  occasionally getting into trouble for travelling with unknown stock,  \"across my ground without my permission\", and at times  escaping arrest for he knew not what, and further, being abused  for the crimes of having a black skin and no master, he sold some of his stock  along the way, beside losing many which died of cold and starvation;  and after thus having lost much of his substance, he eventually worked his way  back to Bloemhof with the remainder, sold them for anything they could fetch,  and went to work for a digger.    The experience of another native sufferer was similar to the above,  except that instead of working for a digger he sold his stock  for a mere bagatelle, and left with his family by the Johannesburg night train  for an unknown destination.  More native families crossed the river  and went inland during the previous week, and as nothing had since  been heard of them, it would seem that they were still wandering somewhere,  and incidentally becoming well versed in the law that was responsible  for their compulsory unsettlement.    Well, we knew that this law was as harsh as its instigators were callous,  and we knew that it would, if passed, render many poor people homeless,  but it must be confessed that we were scarcely prepared  for such a rapid and widespread crash as it caused in the lives of the Natives  in this neighbourhood.  We left our luggage the next morning  with the local Mission School teacher, and crossed the river  to find out some more about this wonderful law of extermination.  It was about 10 a.m. when we landed on the south bank of the Vaal River --  the picturesque Vaal River, upon whose banks a hundred miles farther west  we spent the best and happiest days of our boyhood.  It was interesting  to walk on one portion of the banks of that beautiful river --  a portion which we had never traversed except as an infant in mother's arms  more than thirty years before.  How the subsequent happy days at Barkly West,  so long past, came crowding upon our memory! -- days when  there were no railways, no bridges, and no system of irrigation.  In rainy seasons, which at that time were far more regular and certain,  the river used to overflow its high banks and flood the surrounding valleys  to such an extent, that no punt could carry the wagons across.  Thereby the transport service used to be hung up, and numbers of wagons  would congregate for weeks on both sides of the river  until the floods subsided.  At such times the price of fresh milk  used to mount up to 1s. per pint.  There being next to no competition,  we boys had a monopoly over the milk trade.  We recalled  the number of haversacks full of bottles of milk we youngsters often carried  to those wagons, how we returned with empty bottles and with just  that number of shillings.  Mother and our elder brothers  had leather bags full of gold and did not care for the \"boy's money\";  and unlike the boys of the neighbouring village, having no sisters of our own,  we gave away some of our money to fair cousins, and jingled the rest  in our pockets.  We had been told from boyhood that sweets were injurious  to the teeth, and so spurning these delights we had hardly any use for money,  for all we wanted to eat, drink and wear was at hand in plenty.  We could then get six or eight shillings every morning  from the pastime of washing that number of bottles,  filling them with fresh milk and carrying them down to the wagons;  there was always such an abundance of the liquid that  our shepherd's hunting dog could not possibly miss what we took,  for while the flocks were feeding on the luscious buds of the haak-doorns  and the orange-coloured blossoms of the rich mimosa and other wild vegetation  that abounded on the banks of the Vaal River, the cows, similarly engaged,  were gathering more and more milk.    The gods are cruel, and one of their cruellest acts of omission  was that of giving us no hint that in very much less  than a quarter of a century all those hundreds of heads of cattle,  and sheep and horses belonging to the family would vanish  like a morning mist, and that we ourselves would live  to pay 30s. per month for a daily supply of this same precious fluid,  and in very limited quantities.  They might have warned us  that Englishmen would agree with Dutchmen to make it unlawful  for black men to keep milch cows of their own on the banks of that river,  and gradually have prepared us for the shock.    Crossing the river from the Transvaal side brings one  into the Province of the Orange \"Free\" State, in which,  in the adjoining division of Boshof, we were born thirty-six years back.  We remember the name of the farm, but not having been  in this neighbourhood since infancy, we could not tell its whereabouts,  nor could we say whether the present owner was a Dutchman,  his lawyer, or a Hebrew merchant; one thing we do know, however:  it is that even if we had the money and the owner was willing to sell the spot  upon which we first saw the light of day and breathed the pure air of heaven,  the sale would be followed with a fine of one hundred pounds.  The law of the country forbids the sale of land to a Native.  Russia is one of the most abused countries in the world,  but it is extremely doubtful if the statute book of that Empire contains a law  debarring the peasant from purchasing the land whereon he was born,  or from building a home wherein he might end his days.    At this time we felt something rising from our heels along our back,  gripping us in a spasm, as we were cycling along; a needlelike pang, too,  pierced our heart with a sharp thrill.  What was it?  We remembered  feeling something nearly like it when our father died eighteen years ago;  but at that time our physical organs were fresh and grief was easily  thrown off in tears, but then we lived in a happy South Africa  that was full of pleasant anticipations, and now -- what changes for the worse  have we undergone!  For to crown all our calamities, South Africa has by law  ceased to be the home of any of her native children whose skins are dyed  with a pigment that does not conform with the regulation hue.    We are told to forgive our enemies and not to let the sun go down  upon our wrath, so we breathe the prayer that peace may be to the white races,  and that they, including our present persecutors of the Union Parliament,  may never live to find themselves deprived of all occupation and  property rights in their native country as is now the case with the Native.  History does not tell us of any other continent where the Bantu lived  besides Africa, and if this systematic ill-treatment of the Natives  by the colonists is to be the guiding principle of Europe's scramble  for Africa, slavery is our only alternative; for now it is only as serfs  that the Natives are legally entitled to live here.  Is it to be thought  that God is using the South African Parliament to hound us  out of our ancestral homes in order to quicken our pace heavenward?  But go from where to heaven?  In the beginning, we are told,  God created heaven and earth, and peopled the earth,  for people do not shoot up to heaven from nowhere.  They must have had  an earthly home.  Enoch, Melchizedek, Elijah, and other saints,  came to heaven from earth.  God did not say to the Israelites  in their bondage:  \"Cheer up, boys; bear it all in good part  for I have bright mansions on high awaiting you all.\"  But he said:  \"I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt,  and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters;  for I know their sorrows, and I am come down to bring them  out of the hands of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land  unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.\"  And He used Moses to carry out the promise He made to their ancestor Abraham  in Canaan, that \"unto thy seed will I give this land.\"  It is to be hoped  that in the Boer churches, entrance to which is barred against coloured people  during divine service, they also read the Pentateuch.    It is doubtful if we ever thought so much on a single bicycle ride  as we did on this journey; however, the sight of a policeman ahead of us  disturbed these meditations and gave place to thoughts of quite another kind,  for -- we had no pass.  Dutchmen, Englishmen, Jews, Germans,  and other foreigners may roam the \"Free\" State without permission --  but not Natives.  To us it would mean a fine and imprisonment  to be without a pass.  The \"pass\" law was first instituted  to check the movement of livestock over sparsely populated areas.  In a sense it was a wise provision, in that it served to identify  the livestock which one happened to be driving along the high road,  to prove the bona fides of the driver and his title to the stock.  Although white men still steal large droves of horses in Basutoland  and sell them in Natal or in East Griqualand, they, of course,  are not required to carry any passes.  These white horse-thieves,  to escape the clutches of the police, employ Natives  to go and sell the stolen stock and write the passes for these Natives,  forging the names of Magistrates and Justices of the Peace.

I did  not wonder at the citizen who, seeing a print of Garrison at a shop  window without a name to it, went in and bought it, and framed it as the  most saintlike of countenances.\"    The appearance of such a man on the stage of our history as a nation, at  this hour, was providential. His coming was in the fulness of time. A  rapid review of events anterior to the advent of Garrison will serve to  place this matter more clearly before the general reader. To begin,  then, at the beginning we have two ships off the American coast, the one  casting anchor in Plymouth harbor, the other discharging its cargo at  Jamestown. They were both freighted with human souls. But how different!  Despotism landed at Jamestown, democracy at Plymouth. Here in the germ  was the Southern idea, slave labor, slave institutions; and here also  was the Northern idea, free labor, free institutions. Once planted they  grew, each seed idea multiplying after its kind. In course of time there  arose on one side an industrial system in which the plantation  principle, race-rule and race-slavery, were organic centers; and, on the  other, a social system in which the principle of popular power and  government, the town meeting, and the common school were the ganglia of  social expansion. Contrary ideas beget naturally enough contrary  interests and institutions. So it is no matter for surprise that the  local interests and institutions of the thirteen revolted colonies  lacked homogeneity and identity. What was calculated to promote the  general welfare of the Northern one, it was quite possible might work a  totally opposite result in the Southern. For, indeed, while there were  slaves in them all, the slave system had taken root in Southern soil  only; and while on the other hand the spirit of freedom was existent in  each, free labor had rooted itself in Northern ground solely.    As the war of the Revolution was an uprising against arbitrary power,  and for the establishment of political liberty, it pushed easily into  the foreground the larger subject of human rights. Most of the leading  actors felt the inconsistency of keeping some men in bondage, when they  were fighting to rid themselves of a tyranny which, in comparison to the  other, was a state of honorable freedom. Their humanity condemned  African slavery, and they earnestly desired its extinction. The  Declaration of Independence proves to how high a level the tide of  freedom rose in the colonies. The grand truths by it proclaimed the  signers of that instrument did not restrict in their application to some  men to the exclusion of other men. They wrote \"All men,\" and they meant  exactly what they wrote. Too simply honest and great they were to mean  less than their solemn and deliberate words.    On political as well as on moral grounds they desired emancipation. But  there was a difficulty which at the time proved insuperable. The  nation-making principle, the idea of country, was just emerging out of  the nebulous civil conditions and relations of the ante-Revolutionary  epoch. There was no existent central authority to reach the evil within  the States except the local governments of the States respectively. And  States in revolt against the central authority of the mother country  would hardly be disposed to divest themselves of any part of their newly  asserted right to govern themselves for the purpose of conferring the  same upon any other political body. To each State, then, the question  was necessarily left for settlement.    The war, during its continuance, absorbed the united resources and  energies of the people and their leaders. The anti-slavery movement made  accordingly but small progress. Reforms thrive only when they get a  hearing. Public attention is the food on which they thrive. But precious  little of this food was the Abolition cause able to snatch in those  bitter years. It could not grow. It remained in the gristle--hardly more  than a sentiment. But the sentiment was a seed, the promise and potency  of kindlier times. With the close of the long struggle other questions  arose; got the people's ears; fixed the attention of the leaders. Scant  notice could emancipation extort from men who had to repair the ravages  of an exhausting war, reconstruct shattered fortunes, restore civil  society in parts tumbling into ruinous disorder. The instinct of  self-preservation was altogether too masterful for the moral starveling.  It succumbed to circumstances, content to obtain an occasional sermon,  an annual address, a few scattered societies to keep a human glow in the  bosom of the infant Confederacy.    The Confederation failed. The formation of a more perfect union was  demanded and undertaken. This transcendent task straightway thrust into  the background every other enterprise and interest. The feeble activity  of the freedom-making principle was checked, for the time being, by the  energy of the nation-making power. They were not antagonistic  forces--only in the natural order of things, the earliest stages in the  evolution of the former had to come after the first steps were taken in  the development of the latter. Before there could start a general  movement against American slavery there must needs be an American  nation. An American nation was, in the year 1787, in process of  successful development. With the adoption of the Constitution, the  national principle entered on a period of marvelous expansion and  activity.    Let it not, however, be hastily concluded that freedom meanwhile was in  total eclipse, that the anti-slavery sentiment was absolutely without  influence. For it unquestionably inspired the Ordinance of 1787. The  Northwest Territory, out of which were subsequently organized the States  of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, was thereby,  forever secured to the Northern idea, and free labor. Supplementary to  this grand act was the Constitutional prohibition of the African  slave-trade after the year 1808. Together they were intended to  discourage the growth of slavery--the first by restricting its  territorial extension, the second, by arresting its numerical increase.  And without doubt they would have placed the evil in the way of ultimate  extinction had other and far reaching causes not intervened to produce  adverse social and political conditions.    The first of these causes, in point of time, were certain labor-saving  inventions in England, which vastly enhanced the demand for raw cotton.  Arkwright's invention of the spinning machine about twenty years prior  to the adoption of the Constitution, perfected by the spinning-jenny of  Hargreaves, and the mule of Crompton, \"turned Lancashire,\" the historian  Green says, \"into a hive of industry.\" The then rapid demand for cotton  operated in time as a stimulus to its production in America. Increased  productivity raised the value of slave property and slave soil. But the  slow and tedious hand method of separating the fiber of the cotton bulb  from the seed greatly limited the ability of the Cotton States to meet  and satisfy the fast growing demand of the English manufacturers, until  Eli Whitney, in 1793, by an ingenious invention solved the problem of  supply for these States. The cotton gin was not long in proving itself  the other half--the other hand of the spinning machine.    From that year the slave interests of the South rose in market value,  and its industrial system assumed unexpected importance in the economic  world. The increased production of cotton led directly to increased  demand for slave labor and slave soil. The increased demand for slave  labor the Constitutional provision relating to the African slave trade  operated in part to satisfy. The increased demand for slave soil was  likewise satisfied by the cession to the United States by Georgia and  North Carolina of the Southwest Territory, with provisos practically  securing it to slavery. Out of this new national territory were  subsequently carved the slave States of Tennessee, Mississippi, and  Alabama.    Slave soil unlike free soil, is incapable of sustaining a dense  population. Slave labor calls for large spaces within which to multiply  and prosper. The purchase of Louisiana and the acquisition of Florida  met this agrarian necessity on the part of the South. Immense, unsettled  areas thus fell to the lot of the slave system at the crisis of its  material expansion and prosperity. The domestic slave-trade under the  impetus of settling these vast regions according to the plantation  principle, became an enormous and spreading industry. The crop of slaves  was not less profitable than the crop of cotton. A Southern white man  had but to buy a score of slaves and a few hundred acres to get \"rich  beyond the dreams of avarice.\" So at least calculated the average  Southern man.    This revival of slavery disappointed the humane expectation of its  decline and ultimate extinction entertained by the founders of the  republic. It built up instead a growing and formidable slave class, and  interest in the Union. With the rise of giant slave interests, there  followed the rise of a power devoted to their encouragement and  protection.    Three far-reaching concessions the slave States obtained in the  convention of 1787, viz., the right to import slaves from Africa until  1808; the rendition of fugitive slaves escaping into the free States,  and the three-fifths slave representation clause of the  Constitution--all of which added vastly to the security and value of  this species of property, and as a consequence contributed to the slave  revival.    The equality of the States in the upper branch of the National  Legislature, taken in connection with the right of the slave States to  count five slaves as three freemen in the apportionment of  representatives to the lower House of Congress, gave the Southern  "]]]
