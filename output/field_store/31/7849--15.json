Hames got out a \"black  book,\" and after looking the crowd over concluded to hold the entire  covey, as the descriptions of the \"wanted\" seemed to include most of  them. Some of the rustlers attempted to explain their presence, but  Hames decided to hold the entire party, \"just to learn them to be more  careful of their company the next time,\" as he put it.    The cut had drifted away into the herd again during the arrest, and  about half our outfit took the cattle on to where the wagon camped for  noon. McCann had anticipated an extra crowd for dinner and was  prepared for the emergency. When dinner was over and the Rangers had  packed and were ready to leave, Hames said to Flood,--    \"Well, Flood, I'm powerful glad I met you and your outfit. This has  been one of the biggest round-ups for me in a long time. You don't  know how proud I am over this bunch of beauties. Why, there's liable  to be enough rewards out for this crowd to buy my girl a new pair of  shoes. And say, when your wagon comes into Abilene, if I ain't there,  just drive around to the sheriff's office and leave those captured  guns. I'm sorry to load your wagon down that way, but I'm short on  pack mules and it will be a great favor to me; besides, these fellows  are not liable to need any guns for some little time. I like your  company and your chuck, Flood, but you see how it is; the best of  friends must part; and then I have an invitation to take dinner in  Abilene by to-morrow noon, so I must be a-riding. Adios, everybody.\"        CHAPTER VIII    ON THE BRAZOS AND WICHITA    As we neared Buffalo Gap a few days later, a deputy sheriff of Taylor  County, who resided at the Gap, rode out and met us. He brought an  urgent request from Hames to Flood to appear as a witness against the  rustlers, who were to be given a preliminary trial at Abilene the  following day. Much as he regretted to leave the herd for even a  single night, our foreman finally consented to go. To further his  convenience we made a long evening drive, camping for the night well  above Buffalo Gap, which at that time was little more than a landmark  on the trail. The next day we made an easy drive and passed Abilene  early in the afternoon, where Flood rejoined us, but refused any one  permission to go into town, with the exception of McCann with the  wagon, which was a matter of necessity. It was probably for the best,  for this cow town had the reputation of setting a pace that left the  wayfarer purseless and breathless, to say nothing about headaches.  Though our foreman had not reached those mature years in life when the  pleasures and frivolities of dissipation no longer allure, yet it was  but natural that he should wish to keep his men from the temptation of  the cup that cheers and the wiles of the siren. But when the wagon  returned that evening, it was evident that our foreman was human, for  with a box of cigars which were promised us were several bottles of  Old Crow.    After crossing the Clear Fork of the Brazos a few days later, we  entered a well-watered, open country, through which the herd made  splendid progress. At Abilene, we were surprised to learn that our  herd was the twentieth that had passed that point. The weather so far  on our trip had been exceptionally good; only a few showers had  fallen, and those during the daytime. But we were now nearing a  country in which rain was more frequent, and the swollen condition of  several small streams which have their headwaters in the Staked Plains  was an intimation to us of recent rains to the westward of our route.  Before reaching the main Brazos, we passed two other herds of yearling  cattle, and were warned of the impassable condition of that river for  the past week. Nothing daunted, we made our usual drive; and when the  herd camped that night, Flood, after scouting ahead to the river,  returned with the word that the Brazos had been unfordable for over a  week, five herds being waterbound.    As we were then nearly twenty miles south of the river, the next  morning we threw off the trail and turned the herd to the northeast,  hoping to strike the Brazos a few miles above Round Timber ferry. Once  the herd was started and their course for the day outlined to our  point men by definite landmarks, Flood and Quince Forrest set out to  locate the ferry and look up a crossing. Had it not been for our  wagon, we would have kept the trail, but as there was no ferry on the  Brazos at the crossing of the western trail, it was a question either  of waiting or of making this detour. Then all the grazing for several  miles about the crossing was already taken by the waterbound herds,  and to crowd up and trespass on range already occupied would have been  a violation of an unwritten law. Again, no herd took kindly to another  attempting to pass them when in traveling condition the herds were on  an equality. Our foreman had conceived the scheme of getting past  these waterbound herds, if possible, which would give us a clear field  until the next large watercourse was reached.    Flood and Forrest returned during the noon hour, the former having  found, by swimming, a passable ford near the mouth of Monday Creek,  while the latter reported the ferry in \"apple-pie order.\" No sooner,  then, was dinner over than the wagon set out for the ferry under  Forrest as pilot, though we were to return to the herd once the ferry  was sighted. The mouth of Monday Creek was not over ten miles below  the regular trail crossing on the Brazos, and much nearer our noon  camp than the regular one; but the wagon was compelled to make a  direct elbow, first turning to the eastward, then doubling back after  the river was crossed. We held the cattle off water during the day, so  as to have them thirsty when they reached the river. Flood had swum it  during the morning, and warned us to be prepared for fifty or sixty  yards of swimming water in crossing. When within a mile, we held up  the herd and changed horses, every man picking out one with a tested  ability to swim. Those of us who were expected to take the water as  the herd entered the river divested ourselves of boots and clothing,  which we intrusted to riders in the rear. The approach to crossing was  gradual, but the opposite bank was abrupt, with only a narrow  passageway leading out from the channel. As the current was certain to  carry the swimming cattle downstream, we must, to make due allowance,  take the water nearly a hundred yards above the outlet on the other  shore. All this was planned out in advance by our foreman, who now  took the position of point man on the right hand or down the  riverside; and with our saddle horses in the immediate lead, we  breasted the angry Brazos.    The water was shallow as we entered, and we reached nearly the middle  of the river before the loose saddle horses struck swimming water.  Honeyman was on their lee, and with the cattle crowding in their rear,  there was no alternative but to swim. A loose horse swims easily,  however, and our _remuda_ readily faced the current, though it was  swift enough to carry them below the passageway on the opposite side.  By this time the lead cattle were adrift, and half a dozen of us were  on their lower side, for the footing under the cutbank was narrow, and  should the cattle become congested on landing, some were likely to  drown. For a quarter of an hour it required cool heads to keep the  trail of cattle moving into the water and the passageway clear on the  opposite landing. While they were crossing, the herd represented a  large letter \"U,\" caused by the force of the current drifting the  cattle downstream, or until a foothold was secured on the farther  side. Those of us fortunate enough to have good swimming horses swam  the river a dozen times, and then after the herd was safely over, swam  back to get our clothing. It was a thrilling experience to us younger  lads of the outfit, and rather attractive; but the elder and more  experienced men always dreaded swimming rivers. Their reasons were  made clear enough when, a fortnight later, we crossed Red River, where  a newly made grave was pointed out to us, amongst others of men who  had lost their lives while swimming cattle.    Once the bulk of the cattle were safely over, with no danger of  congestion on the farther bank, they were allowed to loiter along  under the cutbank and drink to their hearts' content. Quite a number  strayed above the passageway, and in order to rout them out, Bob  Blades, Moss Strayhorn, and I rode out through the outlet and up the  river, where we found some of them in a passageway down a dry arroyo.  The steers had found a soft, damp place in the bank, and were so busy  horning the waxy, red mud, that they hardly noticed our approach until  we were within a rod of them. We halted our horses and watched their  antics. The kneeling cattle were cutting the bank viciously with their  horns and matting their heads with the red mud, but on discovering our  presence, they curved their tails and stampeded out as playfully as  young lambs on a hillside.    \"Can you sabe where the fun comes in to a steer, to get down on his  knees in the mud and dirt, and horn the bank and muss up his curls and  enjoy it like that?\" inquired Strayhorn of Blades and me.    \"Because it's healthy and funny besides,\" replied Bob, giving me a  cautious wink. \"Did you never hear of people taking mud baths? You've  seen dogs eat grass, haven't you? Well, it's something on the same  order. Now, if I was a student of the nature of animals, like you are,  I'd get off my horse and imagine I had horns, and scar and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12809"],[0,"Quiet Talks about Jesus (#15)"],[1,"national  council to secure His death. He is declared a fugitive with a price set  upon His head. Anybody knowing of His whereabouts must report the fact to  the authorities. This decides Him not to show Himself openly among them.  In a few weeks the pilgrims are crowding Jerusalem for the Passover.  Jesus' name is on every tongue. The rumor that He was over the hills in  Bethany takes a crowd over there, not simply to see Him, but to see the  resurrected Lazarus. Then it was determined to kill Lazarus off, too.    That tremendous last week now begins. Jesus is seen to be the one masterly  figure in the week's events. In comparison with His calm steady movements,  these leaders run scurrying around, here and there, like headless hens.  The week begins with the most public, formal presentation of Himself in a  kingly fashion to the nation. It is their last chance. How wondrously  patient and considerate is this Jesus! And how sublimely heroic! Into the  midst of those men ravenous for His blood He comes. Seated with fine,  unconscious majesty on a kingly beast, surrounded by ever-increasing  multitudes loudly singing and speaking praises to God, over paths  bestrewed with garments and branches of living green, slowly He mounts the  hill road toward the city. At a turn in the road all of a sudden the city  lies spread out before Him. \"He saw the city and wept over it.\"        \"He sat upon the ass's colt and rode      Toward Jerusalem. Beside Him walked      Closely and silently the faithful twelve,      And on before Him went a multitude      Shouting hosannas, and with eager hands      Strewing their garments thickly in the way.      Th' unbroken foal beneath Him gently stepped,      Tame as its patient dam; and as the song      Of 'Welcome to the Son of David' burst      Forth from a thousand children, and the leaves      Of the waving branches touched its silken ears,      It turned its wild eye for a moment back,      And then, subdued by an invisible hand,      Meekly trod onward with its slender feet.        \"The dew's last sparkle from the grass had gone      As He rode up Mount Olivet. The woods      Threw their cool shadows directly to the west;      And the light foal, with quick and toiling step,      And head bent low, kept up its unslackened way      Till its soft mane was lifted by the wind      Sent o'er the mount from Jordan. As He reached      The summit's breezy pitch, the Saviour raised      His calm blue eye--there stood Jerusalem!      Eagerly He bent forward, and beneath      His mantle's passive folds a bolder line      Than the wont slightness of His perfect limbs      Betrayed the swelling fulness of His heart.      There stood Jerusalem! How fair she looked--      The silver sun on all her palaces,      And her fair daughters 'mid the golden spires      Tending their terrace flowers; and Kedron's stream      Lacing the meadows with its silver band      And wreathing its mist-mantle on the sky      With the morn's exhalation. There she stood,      Jerusalem, the city of His love,      Chosen from all the earth: Jerusalem,      That knew Him not, and had rejected Him;      Jerusalem for whom He came to die!        \"The shouts redoubled from a thousand lips      At the fair sight; the children leaped and sang      Louder hosannas; the clear air was filled      With odor from the trampled olive leaves      But 'Jesus wept!' The loved disciple saw      His Master's tear, and closer to His side      He came with yearning looks, and on his neck      The Saviour leaned with heavenly tenderness,      And mourned, 'How oft, Jerusalem! would I      Have gathered you, as gathereth a hen      Her brood beneath her wings--but ye would not!'        \"He thought not of the death that He should die--      He thought not of the thorns He knew must pierce      His forehead--of the buffet on the cheek--      The scourge, the mocking homage, the foul scorn!        \"Gethsemane stood out beneath His eye      Clear in the morning sun; and there, He knew,      While they who 'could not watch with Him one hour'      Were sleeping, He should sweat great drops of blood,      Praying the cup might pass! And Golgotha      Stood bare and desert by the city wall;      And in its midst, to His prophetic eye      Rose the rough cross, and its keen agonies      Were numbered all--the nails were in His feet--      Th' insulting sponge was pressing on His lips--      The blood and water gushed from His side--      The dizzy faintness swimming in His brain--      And, while His own disciples fled in fear,      A world's death agonies all mixed in His!      Ah!--He forgot all this. He only saw      Jerusalem--the chosen--the loved--the lost!      He only felt that for her sake His life      Was vainly given, and in His pitying love      The sufferings that would clothe the heavens in black      Were quite forgotten.                  \"Was there ever love,      In earth or heaven, equal to this?\"[5]    And so the King entered His capital. It was a royal procession. Mark  keenly the result. Again that utter, ominous, loud silence, that greeted  His ears first, more than three years before. He had come to His own home.  His own kinsfolk received Him not!    Then each day He came to the city, and each night, homeless, slept out in  the open, under the trees of Olivet, and the blue. Now, He rudely shocks  them by clearing the temple areas of the market-place rabble and babble,  and now He is healing the lame and maimed in the temple itself, amid the  reverent praise of the multitude, the songs of the children, and the  scowling, muttered protests of the chief priests. Calmly, day by day, He  moves among them, while their itching fingers vainly clutch for a hold  upon Him, and as surely are held back by some invisible force. By every  subtle device known to cunning, crafty men, they lay question-traps, and  lie in wait to catch His word. He foils them with His marvellous, simple  answers, lashes them with His keen, cutting parables and finally Himself  proposes a question about their own scriptures which they admit themselves  unable to answer, and, utterly defeated, ask no more questions. Then  follows that most terrific arraignment of these leaders, with its  infinitely tender, sad, closing lament over Jerusalem. That is the final  break.    Then occurs that pathetic Greek incident that seems to agitate Jesus so.  This group of earnest seekers, from the outside, non-Jewish world brings  to Jesus a vision of the great hungry heart of the world, and of an  open-mindedness to truth such as was to Him these days as a cool,  refreshing drink to a dusty mouth on a dry hot day. But--no--the Father's  will--simple obedience--only that was right. The harvest can come only  through the grain giving out its life in the cold ground.    Before the final act in the tragedy Jesus retires from sight, probably for  prayer. Some dear friends of Bethany in whose home He had rested many a  time, where He ever found sweet-sympathy, arranged a little home-feast for  Him where a few congenial friends might gather. While seated there in the  quiet atmosphere of love and fellowship so grateful to Him after those  Jerusalem days, one of the friends present, a woman, Mary, takes a box of  exceeding costly ointment, and anoints His head. To the strange protests  made, Jesus quietly explains her thought in the act. She alone understood  what was coming. Alone of all others it was a woman, the simple-hearted  Bethany Mary, who _understood_ Jesus. As none other did she perceive with  her keen love-eyes the coming death, and--more--its meaning.    It is one of the disciples, Judas, who protests indignantly against such  _waste_. This ointment would have brought at least seventy-five dollars,  and how much such a sum would have done for the _poor_! Thoughtless,  improvident woman! Strange the word didn't blister on his canting lips.  John keenly sees that his fingers are clutching the treasure bag as he  speaks the word, and that his thoughts are far from the poor. Jesus gently  rebukes Judas. But Judas is hot tempered, and sullenly watches for the  first chance to withdraw and carry out the damnable purpose that has been  forming within. He hurries over the hill, through the city gate, up to the  palace of the chief priest.    Within there was a company of the inner clique of the leaders, discussing  how to get hold of Jesus most easily. They sit heavily in their seats,  with shut fists, set jaws, and that peculiar yellow-green light spitting  out from under their lowering, knit brows. These bothersome crowds had to  be considered. The feast-day wouldn't do. The crowd would be greatest  then, and hardest to handle. Back and forth they brew their scheme. Then a  knock at the door. Startled, they look alertly up to know who this  intruder may be. The door is opened. In steps a man with a hangdog,  guilty, but determined look. It is one of the men they have seen with  Jesus! What can this mean? He glances furtively from one to another.    Then he speaks: \"How much'll you give if I get Jesus into your hands?\" Of  all things this was probably the last they had thought might happen. Their  eyes gleam. How much indeed--a good snug sum to get their fingers securely  on his person. But they're shrewd bargainers. That's one of their  specialties. How much did he _want_? Poor Judas! He made a bad bargain  that day. Thirty pieces of silver! He could easily have gotten a thousand.  Judas did love money greedily, and doubtless was a good bargainer too, but  anger was in the saddle now, and drove him hard. Without doubt it was in a  hot fit of temper that he made this proposal. His descendants have been  coining money out of Jesus right along: exchanging Him for gold.    Only a little later, and the Master is closeted with His inner circle in  the upper room of a faithful friend's house in one of the Jerusalem  streets, for the Passover supper.
