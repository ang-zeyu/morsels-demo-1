When the heart is oppressed with  suffering, and above all, with the most painful of all suffering,  anxiety, solitude and sleep are the only consolations. But then the  sleep is not the light, happy, joyous slumber, from which we awake  refreshed and strengthened; it is a leaden, sullen, sodden trance,  from which we awake with the sensation that the whole weight of the  atmosphere has been concentrated on our brows. This was the case with  Dumiger: the flickering, dreary light of the lamp kept waving before  his eyes as he lay there. He felt like a man whose limbs have been  paralyzed by some grievous accident. At last be breathed heavily, and  the load of oppression fell from his eyelids. Such was the sleep we  have described.    When he awoke in the morning the light had gone out; but a few  pale, melancholy gleams of morning pierced the prison-bars, which  were so far above him that it was not possible for him to reach  them. He strove to remember where he was; his eyes fell on the  grotesquely-painted figures which covered the walls, and which  had escaped his observation on the preceding night. These were the  handicraft of some man who had evidently endeavored to wile away his  time in prison by caricaturing his persecutors; and certainly he  had succeeded in the attempt. Nothing more absurd than some of these  pictures could be imagined; every possible deformity was ascribed to  the originals, and the sketches were surrounded by pasquinades and  quaint devices. Here and there might be found expressions of deeper  and more fearful import, if indeed anything could be more fearful than  the contrast between the ridiculous and such a dungeon. \"_Non omnis  moriar_,\" wrote one man in a yellow liquid, which too evidently  was discolored blood. \"_Justum et tenacem recti virum_,\" scrawled  another, immediately followed by a portrait of the \"_vultis instantis  tyranni_,\" who had, if we may judge by the chain suspended from his  neck, once been a famous Grand Master. On one part of the wall might  be deciphered a whole romance scrawled with an old nail, in which the  prisoner had arrived at such excellence, that the letters were like  the most admirable type. It was a long, and doubtless melancholy tale;  so much so, that the kind guardians of the place had scratched it with  their knives to prevent its being easily deciphered. In fact, that  little cell had evidently contained an Iliad of romances; and if the  walls could have spoken, or even the scrawls been deciphered, some  strange tales, and perhaps many mysterious events, would have come to  light. Dumiger gazed on these sad records of prior existences with a  melancholy interest. In vain he endeavored to explain to himself the  cause of his being treated with such unparalleled severity. He could  not recall any crime such as might excuse his incarceration in such  an abominable place. He buried his face in his hands. He thought of  Marguerite and the clock, and then, happily for him, he wept, as the  young alone can weep when they are in sorrow, and when their sorrow is  unselfish.    He was roused by an unbolting of bars, the turning of huge, unwieldy  keys, and the lieutenant of the castle stood before him.    Dumiger was in that state of mind when whatever of pride belongs  to the consciousness of innocence loses its strength. Though there  was little to invite confidence in the outward demeanor of the  functionary, he ran toward him, seized him by both hands, and  exclaimed, \"Have pity upon me, sir; tell me why I am here!\"    \"Pooh, pooh,\" replied the bronzed old Cerberus: \"be a man.\"    \"Be a man!\" shrieked Dumiger, \"I am a man: and it is because I am  a man, a free man of Dantzic, that I appeal against this monstrous  treatment. Be a man! why, I appeal to you, sir, to be a man, and  to give up that situation, if it can only be retained by cruelty to  others. I say again, be you a man, and cease to torture me.\"    The lieutenant continued looking at him with the most perfect  indifference. He whistled a tune, took the only two turns in the cell  which its extent permitted, and then, as if a sudden recollection had  struck him, put two letters into Dumiger's hands.    \"Come, you are not very ill treated, young man, when you are allowed  to read.\"    Dumiger felt a glow of delight thrill through his frame. Everything  is by comparison, and after the pain be had endured, the sight of two  letters, the one in the handwriting of Marguerite, the other of Carl,  made his heart leap with joy. They seemed to him to be the guarantees  of immediate safety.    The lieutenant still remained near him. Dumiger would not open the  letters in his presence. At last the officer, after some minutes'  delay, and having sung sundry snatches of martial airs, gave Dumiger  a contemptuous, indignant glance, and stalked out of the cell, taking  care to rattle the bolts and bars as a punishment to Dumiger for not  gratifying his curiosity. Poor devil, it was his only amusement to pry  into the prisoners' secrets.    \"How is the lad?\" asked the second in command when his commander  appeared.    \"Better than he will be when he knows the charges for which he is shut  up. At present he is under the impression it is only for debt; but  when he learns it is for treason, he will whimper and whine even more  than he has been doing.\"    \"What, so young and a traitor!\" exclaimed the subaltern, who was  evidently the kinder spirit of the two. \"It is almost incredible.\"    \"It may be,\" continued the lieutenant. \"I have directions from the  Grand Master and Council to keep a strict watch over him. They say  that he is a most dangerous character. But I never trouble myself much  about these kind of fellows. I do my duty quietly. Meanwhile, I have  given him letters which won't add to his happiness much when he reads  them, if I am to believe what the inspector told me, who of course  read them and sealed them again.\"    The moment the lieutenant had left the cell, Dumiger eagerly tore open  Marguerite's letter, without remarking that it had been opened ere  it reached him. He read it through with that rapidity of glance and  mental discernment which fear and love combined can alone give. It  was with a groan of horror that he allowed the letter to drop from his  hands, for the full extent of the difficulties of his situation now  broke upon him. She told him that the same evening, the moment his  arrest was known in the neighborhood, bills had poured in from all  quarters; that she had seen his friends Carl and Krantz, who called  early on that morning, and who found it impossible to obtain one-tenth  of the sum now required for his release. All they could do, therefore,  was to take charge of the wonderful model, and carry it to the  Court-house, where it would have to remain until the decision of the  Council should be proclaimed. The second letter, which was from Carl,  was still more appalling, for he told Dumiger how essential it was  for him to make any sacrifice in order to put the whole machinery  in order, so that his work might appear to the judges in the most  favorable point of view. He undertook, however, to engage the best  mechanist in Dantzic, in the event of Dumiger not being able to obtain  his release before the appointed day.    What was to be done? Dumiger felt himself driven almost to frenzy. He  thought of Marguerite, of his clock, of his friends; he then began to  think that be had acted very foolishly in refusing the offer of the  Grand Master, who, he felt assured, although the lieutenant would  not admit it to him, was the cause of all his misery. The more he  reflected on the past, the more desperate he became; he rolled on the  ground in agony; the whole day passed in efforts to reach the window,  whence at least he might perceive the situation of his house, or to  shake the bars of the strongly-ironed door. Toward evening a soldier  brought him some refreshment, but preserved an obstinate silence.  Dumiger allowed the refreshment to remain untasted on the ground; he  could not touch it. The evening grew on apace, the merry chimes from  the Dom of the city came across the water; it struck him that they  had never chimed so musically before, or with so much meaning. Another  long, long night of agony was to be passed, and where and how was  suspense to end?    Time swept on, but this night they brought him no lamp, so that he had  no means of measuring its progress; he could only judge how heavily  the hours rolled by the tramp of the guards as they marched over the  drawbridge to the several reliefs. At ten o'clock he heard the bugles  sounding the retreat, and then when he pictured to himself his gentle  young bride, so sweet, so lovely--when he remembered how greatly he  had neglected her for his ambition--he loathed himself for what he  used to consider laudable, but now felt to have been mere selfishness.    It was still very early, for the gray cold streaks of morning had  not pierced the prison-bars, when Dumiger was roused from his uneasy  slumber by the rattling of the lock of his door. He looked up and saw  with surprise a man who was not dressed in uniform.    \"Who are you? What do you want?\" exclaimed Dumiger, \"for there is such  a thing as intrusion even in a prison.\"    The man whom he addressed only replied by taking possession of the  single chair which stood by the bedside; he then very quietly and  coolly took a tinder-box from his pocket, struck a light in the  most deliberate manner, and lit the small lamp which had remained  unreplenished from the preceding evening. Dumiger had then an  opportunity of examining his visitor.    He was a little, jesuitical, sly, crafty, leering person, with a  quick, intelligent, practical eye--a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1298"],[0,"The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains (#15)"],[1,"se, where they saw an object  crawling on the floor with a handful of sulphur matches. He began to  remove the matches, but stopped in alarm at the vociferous result; and  his wife looked in from the kitchen to caution him about humoring little  Christopher.    When she beheld the matches she was aghast but when she saw her baby  grow quiet in the arms of the Virginian, she smiled at that cow-puncher  and returned to her kitchen.    Then the Virginian slowly spoke again: \"How many little strangers have  yu' got, James?\"    \"Only two.\"    \"My! Ain't it most three years since yu' maried? Yu' mustn't let time  creep ahaid o' yu', James.\"    The father once more grinned at his guests, who themselves turned  sheepish and polite; for Mrs. Westfall came in, brisk and hearty, and  set the meat upon the table. After that, it was she who talked. The  guests ate scrupulously, muttering, \"Yes, ma'am,\" and \"No, ma'am,\" in  their plates, while their hostess told them of increasing families upon  Bear Creek, and the expected school-teacher, and little Alfred's early  teething, and how it was time for all of them to become husbands like  James. The bachelors of the saddle listened, always diffident,  but eating heartily to the end; and soon after they rode away in a  thoughtful clump. The wives of Bear Creek were few as yet, and the homes  scattered; the schoolhouse was only a sprig on the vast face of a world  of elk and bear and uncertain Indians; but that night, when the earth  near the fire was littered with the cow-punchers' beds, the Virginian  was heard drawling to himself: \"Alfred and Christopher. Oh, sugar!\"    They found pleasure in the delicately chosen shade of this oath. He also  recited to them a new verse about how he took his Looloo girl to the  schoolhouse for to learn her A B C; and as it was quite original and  unprintable, the camp laughed and swore joyfully, and rolled in its  blankets to sleep under the stars.    Upon a Monday noon likewise (for things will happen so) some tearful  people in petticoats waved handkerchiefs at a train that was just  leaving Bennington, Vermont. A girl's face smiled back at them once, and  withdrew quickly, for they must not see the smile die away.    She had with her a little money, a few clothes, and in her mind a rigid  determination neither to be a burden to her mother nor to give in to  that mother's desires. Absence alone would enable her to carry out  this determination. Beyond these things, she possessed not much except  spelling-books, a colonial miniature, and that craving for the unknown  which has been mentioned. If the ancestors that we carry shut up inside  us take turns in dictating to us our actions and our state of mind,  undoubtedly Grandmother Stark was empress of Molly's spirit upon this  Monday.    At Hoosic Junction, which came soon, she passed the up-train bound back  to her home, and seeing the engineer and the conductor,--faces that she  knew well,--her courage nearly failed her, and she shut her eyes against  this glimpse of the familiar things that she was leaving. To keep  herself steady she gripped tightly a little bunch of flowers in her  hand.    But something caused her eyes to open; and there before her stood Sam  Bannett, asking if he might accompany her so far as Rotterdam Junction.    \"No!\" she told him with a severity born from the struggle she was making  with her grief. \"Not a mile with me. Not to Eagle Bridge. Good-by.\"    And Sam--what did he do? He obeyed her, I should like to be sorry for  him. But obedience was not a lover's part here. He hesitated, the golden  moment hung hovering, the conductor cried \"All aboard!\" the train went,  and there on the platform stood obedient Sam, with his golden moment  gone like a butterfly.    After Rotterdam Junction, which was some forty minutes farther, Molly  Wood sat bravely up in the through car, dwelling upon the unknown. She  thought that she had attained it in Ohio, on Tuesday morning, and wrote  a letter about it to Bennington. On Wednesday afternoon she felt sure,  and wrote a letter much more picturesque. But on the following day,  after breakfast at North Platte, Nebraska, she wrote a very long letter  indeed, and told them that she had seen a black pig on a white pile of  buffalo bones, catching drops of water in the air as they fell from the  railroad tank. She also wrote that trees were extraordinarily scarce.  Each hour westward from the pig confirmed this opinion, and when she  left the train at Rock Creek, late upon that fourth night,--in those  days the trains were slower,--she knew that she had really attained the  unknown, and sent an expensive telegram to say that she was quite well.    At six in the morning the stage drove away into the sage-brush, with her  as its only passenger; and by sundown she had passed through some of the  primitive perils of the world. The second team, virgin to harness, and  displeased with this novelty, tried to take it off, and went down to the  bottom of a gully on its eight hind legs, while Miss Wood sat mute and  unflinching beside the driver. Therefore he, when it was over, and they  on the proper road again, invited her earnestly to be his wife during  many of the next fifteen miles, and told her of his snug cabin and his  horses and his mine. Then she got down and rode inside, Independence and  Grandmother Stark shining in her eye. At Point of Rocks, where they had  supper and his drive ended, her face distracted his heart, and he told  her once more about his cabin, and lamentably hoped she would remember  him. She answered sweetly that she would try, and gave him her hand.  After all, he was a frank-looking boy, who had paid her the highest  compliment that a boy (or a man for that matter) knows; and it is said  that Molly Stark, in her day, was not a New Woman.    The new driver banished the first one from the maiden's mind. He was not  a frank-looking boy, and he had been taking whiskey. All night long he  took it, while his passenger, helpless and sleepless inside the lurching  stage, sat as upright as she possibly could; nor did the voices that she  heard at Drybone reassure her. Sunrise found the white stage lurching  eternally on across the alkali, with a driver and a bottle on the  box, and a pale girl staring out at the plain, and knotting in her  handkerchief some utterly dead flowers. They came to a river where the  man bungled over the ford. Two wheels sank down over an edge, and the  canvas toppled like a descending kite. The ripple came sucking through  the upper spokes, and as she felt the seat careen, she put out her  head and tremulously asked if anything was wrong. But the driver was  addressing his team with much language, and also with the lash.    Then a tall rider appeared close against the buried axles, and took her  out of the stage on his horse so suddenly that she screamed. She felt  splashes, saw a swimming flood, and found herself lifted down upon the  shore. The rider said something to her about cheering up, and its being  all right, but her wits were stock-still, so she did not speak and thank  him. After four days of train and thirty hours of stage, she was having  a little too much of the unknown at once. Then the tall man gently  withdrew leaving her to become herself again. She limply regarded the  river pouring round the slanted stage, and a number of horsemen with  ropes, who righted the vehicle, and got it quickly to dry land, and  disappeared at once with a herd of cattle, uttering lusty yells.    She saw the tall one delaying beside the driver, and speaking. He spoke  so quietly that not a word reached her, until of a sudden the driver  protested loudly. The man had thrown something, which turned out to be  a bottle. This twisted loftily and dived into the stream. He said  something more to the driver, then put his hand on the saddle-horn,  looked half-lingeringly at the passenger on the bank, dropped his  grave eyes from hers, and swinging upon his horse, was gone just as the  passenger opened her mouth and with inefficient voice murmured, \"Oh,  thank you!\" at his departing back.    The driver drove up now, a chastened creature. He helped Miss Wood in,  and inquired after her welfare with a hanging head; then meek as his own  drenched horses, he climbed back to his reins, and nursed the stage on  toward the Bow Leg Mountains much as if it had been a perambulator.    As for Miss Wood, she sat recovering, and she wondered what the man on  the horse must think of her. She knew that she was not ungrateful, and  that if he had given her an opportunity she would have explained to him.  If he supposed that she did not appreciate his act--Here into the midst  of these meditations came an abrupt memory that she had screamed--she  could not be sure when. She rehearsed the adventure from the beginning,  and found one or two further uncertainties--how it had all been while  she was on the horse, for instance. It was confusing to determine  precisely what she had done with her arms. She knew where one of his  arms had been. And the handkerchief with the flowers was gone. She made  a few rapid dives in search of it. Had she, or had she not, seen him  putting something in his pocket? And why had she behaved so unlike  herself? In a few miles Miss Wood entertained sentiments of maidenly  resentment toward her rescuer, and of maidenly hope to see him again.    To that river crossing he came again, alone, when the days were growing  short. The ford was dry sand, and the stream a winding lane of  shingle. He found a pool,--pools always survive the year round in this  stream,--and having watered his pony, he lunched near the spot to  which he had borne the frightened passenger that day. Where the flowing  current had been he sat, regarding the now extremely safe channel.    \"She cert'nly wouldn't need to grip me so close this mawnin',\" he said,  as he pondered over his meal. \"I reckon it will mightily astonish her"]]]
