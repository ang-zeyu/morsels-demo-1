Good Cook, I love thee well, and thou shalt have a good pottle of our  master's best wine every day, for thou art an old and faithful servant.  Also, good Cook, I have ten shillings that I mean to give as a gift to  thee.  But hatest thou not to see a vile upstart like this Reynold  Greenleaf taking it upon him so bravely?\"    \"Ay, marry, that do I,\" quoth the Cook boldly, for he liked the Steward  because of his talk of the wine and of the ten shillings.  \"Get thee  gone straightway to thy room, and I will bring out this knave by his  ears.\" So saying, he laid aside his spit and drew the sword that hung by  his side; whereupon the Steward left as quickly as he could, for he  hated the sight of naked steel.    Then the Cook walked straightway to the broken pantry door, through  which he saw Little John tucking a napkin beneath his chin and preparing  to make himself merry.    \"Why, how now, Reynold Greenleaf?\" said the Cook, \"thou art no better  than a thief, I wot.  Come thou straight forth, man, or I will carve  thee as I would carve a sucking pig.\"    \"Nay, good Cook, bear thou thyself more seemingly, or else I will come  forth to thy dole.  At most times I am as a yearling lamb, but when one  cometh between me and my meat, I am a raging lion, as it were.\"    \"Lion or no lion,\" quoth the valorous Cook, \"come thou straight forth,  else thou art a coward heart as well as a knavish thief.\"    \"Ha!\" cried Little John, \"coward's name have I never had; so, look to  thyself, good Cook, for I come forth straight, the roaring lion I did  speak of but now.\"    Then he, too, drew his sword and came out of the pantry; then, putting  themselves into position, they came slowly together, with grim and angry  looks; but suddenly Little John lowered his point. \"Hold, good Cook!\"  said he.  \"Now, I bethink me it were ill of us to fight with good  victuals standing so nigh, and such a feast as would befit two stout  fellows such as we are.  Marry, good friend, I think we should enjoy  this fair feast ere we fight. What sayest thou, jolly Cook?\"    At this speech the Cook looked up and down, scratching his head in  doubt, for he loved good feasting.  At last he drew a long breath and  said to Little John, \"Well, good friend, I like thy plan right well; so,  pretty boy, say I, let us feast, with all my heart, for one of us may  sup in Paradise before nightfall.\"    So each thrust his sword back into the scabbard and entered the pantry.  Then, after they had seated themselves, Little John drew his dagger and  thrust it into the pie.  \"A hungry man must be fed,\" quoth he, \"so,  sweet chuck, I help myself without leave.\" But the Cook did not lag far  behind, for straightway his hands also were deeply thrust within the  goodly pasty.  After this, neither of them spoke further, but used their  teeth to better purpose. But though neither spoke, they looked at one  another, each thinking within himself that he had never seen a more  lusty fellow than the one across the board.    At last, after a long time had passed, the Cook drew a full, deep  breath, as though of much regret, and wiped his hands upon the napkin,  for he could eat no more. Little John, also, had enough, for he pushed  the pasty aside, as though he would say, \"I want thee by me no more,  good friend.\" Then he took the pottle of sack, and said he, \"Now, good  fellow, I swear by all that is bright, that thou art the stoutest  companion at eating that ever I had.  Lo!  I drink thy health.\" So  saying, he clapped the flask to his lips and cast his eyes aloft, while  the good wine flooded his throat. Then he passed the pottle to the Cook,  who also said, \"Lo, I drink thy health, sweet fellow!\"  Nor was he  behind Little John in drinking any more than in eating.    \"Now,\" quoth Little John, \"thy voice is right round and sweet, jolly  lad. I doubt not thou canst sing a ballad most blithely; canst thou  not?\"    \"Truly, I have trolled one now and then,\" quoth the Cook, \"yet I would  not sing alone.\"    \"Nay, truly,\" said Little John, \"that were but ill courtesy. Strike up  thy ditty, and I will afterward sing one to match it, if I can.    \"So be it, pretty boy,\" quoth the Cook.  \"And hast thou e'er heard the  song of the Deserted Shepherdess?\"    \"Truly, I know not,\" answered Little John, \"but sing thou and let me  hear.\"    Then the Cook took another draught from the pottle, and, clearing his  throat, sang right sweetly:    THE SONG OF THE DESERTED SHEPHERDESS     \"_In Lententime, when leaves wax green,       And pretty birds begin to mate,   When lark cloth sing, and thrush, I ween,       And stockdove cooeth soon and late,   Fair Phillis sat beside a stone,   And thus I heard her make her moan:       'O willow, willow, willow, willow!   I'll take me of thy branches fair   And twine a wreath to deck my hair.     \"'The thrush hath taken him a she,       The robin, too, and eke the dove;   My Robin hath deserted me,       And left me for another love.   So here, by brookside, all alone,   I sit me down and make my moan.       O willow, willow, willow, willow!   I'll take me of thy branches fair   And twine a wreath to deck my hair.'     \"But ne'er came herring from the sea,       But good as he were in the tide;   Young Corydon came o'er the lea,       And sat him Phillis down beside.   So, presently, she changed her tone,   And 'gan to cease her from her moan,       'O willow, willow, willow, willow!   Thou mayst e'en keep thy garlands fair,   I want them not to deck my hair_.'\"    \"Now, by my faith,\" cried Little John, \"that same is a right good song,  and hath truth in it, also.\"    \"Glad am I thou likest it, sweet lad,\" said the Cook.  \"Now sing thou  one also, for ne'er should a man be merry alone, or sing and list not.\"    \"Then I will sing thee a song of a right good knight of Arthur's court,  and how he cured his heart's wound without running upon the dart again,  as did thy Phillis; for I wot she did but cure one smart by giving  herself another. So, list thou while I sing:    THE GOOD KNIGHT AND HIS LOVE     \"_When Arthur, King, did rule this land,       A goodly king was he,   And had he of stout knights a band       Of merry company.     \"Among them all, both great and small,       A good stout knight was there,   A lusty childe, and eke a tall,       That loved a lady fair.     \"But nought would she to do with he,       But turned her face away;   So gat he gone to far countrye,       And left that lady gay.     \"There all alone he made his moan,       And eke did sob and sigh,   And weep till it would move a stone,       And he was like to die.     \"But still his heart did feel the smart,       And eke the dire distress,   And rather grew his pain more sharp       As grew his body less.     \"Then gat he back where was good sack       And merry com panye,   And soon did cease to cry 'Alack!'       When blithe and gay was he.     \"From which I hold, and feel full bold       To say, and eke believe,   That gin the belly go not cold       The heart will cease to grieve_.\"    \"Now, by my faith,\" cried the Cook, as he rattled the pottle against the  sideboard, \"I like that same song hugely, and eke the motive of it,  which lieth like a sweet kernel in a hazelnut\"    \"Now thou art a man of shrewd opinions,\" quoth Little John, \"and I love  thee truly as thou wert my brother.\"    \"And I love thee, too.  But the day draweth on, and I have my cooking to  do ere our master cometh home; so let us e'en go and settle this brave  fight we have in hand.\"    \"Ay, marry,\" quoth Little John, \"and that right speedily. Never have I  been more laggard in fighting than in eating and drinking. So come thou  straight forth into the passageway, where there is good room to swing a  sword, and I will try to serve thee.\"    Then they both stepped forth into the broad passage that led to the  Steward's pantry, where each man drew his sword again and without more  ado fell upon the other as though he would hew his fellow limb from  limb.  Then their swords clashed upon one another with great din, and  sparks flew from each blow in showers. So they fought up and down the  hall for an hour and more, neither striking the other a blow, though  they strove their best to do so; for both were skillful at the fence; so  nothing came of all their labor. Ever and anon they rested, panting;  then, after getting their wind, at it they would go again more fiercely  than ever. At last Little John cried aloud, \"Hold, good Cook!\" whereupon  each rested upon his sword, panting.    \"Now will I make my vow,\" quoth Little John, \"thou art the very best  swordsman that ever mine eyes beheld.  Truly, I had thought to carve  thee ere now.\"    \"And I had thought to do the same by thee,\" quoth the Cook, \"but I have  missed the mark somehow.\"    \"Now I have been thinking within myself,\" quoth Little John, \"what we  are fighting for; but albeit I do not rightly know.\"    \"Why, no more do I,\" said the Cook.  \"I bear no love for that pursy  Steward, but I thought that we had engaged to fight with one another and  that it must be done.\"    \"Now,\" quoth Little John, \"it doth seem to me that instead of striving  to cut one another's throats, it were better for us to be boon  companions.  What sayst thou, jolly Cook, wilt thou go with me to  Sherwood Forest and join with Robin Hood's band? Thou shalt live a merry  life within the woodlands, and sevenscore good companions shalt thou  have, one of whom is mine own self. Thou shalt have three suits of  Lincoln green each year, and forty marks in pay.\"    \"Now, thou art a man after mine own heart!\" cried the Cook right  heartily, \"and, as thou speakest of it, that is the very service for me.  I will go with thee, and that right gladly.  Give me thy palm, sweet  fellow, and I will be thine own companion from henceforth. What may be  thy name, lad?\"    \"Men do call me Little"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1015"],[0,"The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life (#15)"],[1,"about as large as a pumpkin, and fever-and-ague fits had dyed  his face of a corresponding color. He wore an old white hat, tied under  his chin with a handkerchief; his body was short and stout, but his  legs of disproportioned and appalling length. I observed him at sunset,  breasting the hill with gigantic strides, and standing against the sky  on the summit, like a colossal pair of tongs. In a moment after we heard  him screaming frantically behind the ridge, and nothing doubting that  he was in the clutches of Indians or grizzly bears, some of the party  caught up their rifles and ran to the rescue. His outcries, however,  proved but an ebullition of joyous excitement; he had chased two little  wolf pups to their burrow, and he was on his knees, grubbing away like a  dog at the mouth of the hole, to get at them.    Before morning he caused more serious disquiet in the camp. It was his  turn to hold the middle guard; but no sooner was he called up, than he  coolly arranged a pair of saddle-bags under a wagon, laid his head upon  them, closed his eyes, opened his mouth and fell asleep. The guard on  our side of the camp, thinking it no part of his duty to look after the  cattle of the emigrants, contented himself with watching our own horses  and mules; the wolves, he said, were unusually noisy; but still no  mischief was anticipated until the sun rose, and not a hoof or horn was  in sight! The cattle were gone! While Tom was quietly slumbering, the  wolves had driven them away.    Then we reaped the fruits of R.'s precious plan of traveling in company  with emigrants. To leave them in their distress was not to be thought  of, and we felt bound to wait until the cattle could be searched for,  and, if possible, recovered. But the reader may be curious to know  what punishment awaited the faithless Tom. By the wholesome law of  the prairie, he who falls asleep on guard is condemned to walk all  day leading his horse by the bridle, and we found much fault with  our companions for not enforcing such a sentence on the offender.  Nevertheless had he been of our party, I have no doubt he would in like  manner have escaped scot-free. But the emigrants went farther than mere  forebearance; they decreed that since Tom couldn't stand guard without  falling asleep, he shouldn't stand guard at all, and henceforward his  slumbers were unbroken. Establishing such a premium on drowsiness could  have no very beneficial effect upon the vigilance of our sentinels; for  it is far from agreeable, after riding from sunrise to sunset, to feel  your slumbers interrupted by the butt of a rifle nudging your side, and  a sleepy voice growling in your ear that you must get up, to shiver and  freeze for three weary hours at midnight.    \"Buffalo! buffalo!\" It was but a grim old bull, roaming the prairie by  himself in misanthropic seclusion; but there might be more behind the  hills. Dreading the monotony and languor of the camp, Shaw and I saddled  our horses, buckled our holsters in their places, and set out with Henry  Chatillon in search of the game. Henry, not intending to take part in  the chase, but merely conducting us, carried his rifle with him, while  we left ours behind as incumbrances. We rode for some five or six miles,  and saw no living thing but wolves, snakes, and prairie dogs.    \"This won't do at all,\" said Shaw.    \"What won't do?\"    \"There's no wood about here to make a litter for the wounded man; I have  an idea that one of us will need something of the sort before the day is  over.\"    There was some foundation for such an apprehension, for the ground was  none of the best for a race, and grew worse continually as we proceeded;  indeed it soon became desperately bad, consisting of abrupt hills and  deep hollows, cut by frequent ravines not easy to pass. At length, a  mile in advance, we saw a band of bulls. Some were scattered grazing  over a green declivity, while the rest were crowded more densely  together in the wide hollow below. Making a circuit to keep out of  sight, we rode toward them until we ascended a hill within a furlong of  them, beyond which nothing intervened that could possibly screen us from  their view. We dismounted behind the ridge just out of sight, drew our  saddle-girths, examined our pistols, and mounting again rode over  the hill, and descended at a canter toward them, bending close to  our horses' necks. Instantly they took the alarm; those on the hill  descended; those below gathered into a mass, and the whole got in  motion, shouldering each other along at a clumsy gallop. We followed,  spurring our horses to full speed; and as the herd rushed, crowding and  trampling in terror through an opening in the hills, we were close at  their heels, half suffocated by the clouds of dust. But as we drew near,  their alarm and speed increased; our horses showed signs of the utmost  fear, bounding violently aside as we approached, and refusing to  enter among the herd. The buffalo now broke into several small bodies,  scampering over the hills in different directions, and I lost sight of  Shaw; neither of us knew where the other had gone. Old Pontiac ran like  a frantic elephant up hill and down hill, his ponderous hoofs striking  the prairie like sledge-hammers. He showed a curious mixture of  eagerness and terror, straining to overtake the panic-stricken herd, but  constantly recoiling in dismay as we drew near. The fugitives, indeed,  offered no very attractive spectacle, with their enormous size and  weight, their shaggy manes and the tattered remnants of their last  winter's hair covering their backs in irregular shreds and patches, and  flying off in the wind as they ran. At length I urged my horse close  behind a bull, and after trying in vain, by blows and spurring, to  bring him alongside, I shot a bullet into the buffalo from this  disadvantageous position. At the report, Pontiac swerved so much that I  was again thrown a little behind the game. The bullet, entering too much  in the rear, failed to disable the bull, for a buffalo requires to be  shot at particular points, or he will certainly escape. The herd ran up  a hill, and I followed in pursuit. As Pontiac rushed headlong down on  the other side, I saw Shaw and Henry descending the hollow on the right,  at a leisurely gallop; and in front, the buffalo were just disappearing  behind the crest of the next hill, their short tails erect, and their  hoofs twinkling through a cloud of dust.    At that moment, I heard Shaw and Henry shouting to me; but the muscles  of a stronger arm than mine could not have checked at once the furious  course of Pontiac, whose mouth was as insensible as leather. Added to  this, I rode him that morning with a common snaffle, having the day  before, for the benefit of my other horse, unbuckled from my bridle the  curb which I ordinarily used. A stronger and hardier brute never trod  the prairie; but the novel sight of the buffalo filled him with terror,  and when at full speed he was almost incontrollable. Gaining the top of  the ridge, I saw nothing of the buffalo; they had all vanished amid the  intricacies of the hills and hollows. Reloading my pistols, in the best  way I could, I galloped on until I saw them again scuttling along at  the base of the hill, their panic somewhat abated. Down went old Pontiac  among them, scattering them to the right and left, and then we had  another long chase. About a dozen bulls were before us, scouring over  the hills, rushing down the declivities with tremendous weight and  impetuosity, and then laboring with a weary gallop upward. Still  Pontiac, in spite of spurring and beating, would not close with them.  One bull at length fell a little behind the rest, and by dint of much  effort I urged my horse within six or eight yards of his side. His back  was darkened with sweat; he was panting heavily, while his tongue lolled  out a foot from his jaws. Gradually I came up abreast of him, urging  Pontiac with leg and rein nearer to his side, then suddenly he did what  buffalo in such circumstances will always do; he slackened his gallop,  and turning toward us, with an aspect of mingled rage and distress,  lowered his huge shaggy head for a charge. Pontiac with a snort, leaped  aside in terror, nearly throwing me to the ground, as I was wholly  unprepared for such an evolution. I raised my pistol in a passion to  strike him on the head, but thinking better of it fired the bullet after  the bull, who had resumed his flight, then drew rein and determined  to rejoin my companions. It was high time. The breath blew hard from  Pontiac's nostrils, and the sweat rolled in big drops down his sides;  I myself felt as if drenched in warm water. Pledging myself (and I  redeemed the pledge) to take my revenge at a future opportunity, I  looked round for some indications to show me where I was, and what  course I ought to pursue; I might as well have looked for landmarks in  the midst of the ocean. How many miles I had run or in what direction,  I had no idea; and around me the prairie was rolling in steep swells  and pitches, without a single distinctive feature to guide me. I had  a little compass hung at my neck; and ignorant that the Platte at this  point diverged considerably from its easterly course, I thought that by  keeping to the northward I should certainly reach it. So I turned  and rode about two hours in that direction. The prairie changed as I  advanced, softening away into easier undulations, but nothing like the  Platte appeared, nor any sign of a human being; the same wild endless  expanse lay around me still; and to all appearance I was as far from my  object as ever. I began now to consider myself in danger of being  lost; and therefore, reining in my horse, summoned the scanty share of  woodcraft that I possessed (if that term he applicable upon the prairie)  to extricate me. Looking round, it occurred to me that the buffalo might  prove my best guides. I"]]]
