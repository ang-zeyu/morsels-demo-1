Psalm 51:3. Third Part. L. M.  The backslider restored; or, Repentance  and faith in the blood of Christ.    1 O thou that hear'st when sinners cry,  Tho' all my crimes before thee lie,  Behold them not with angry look,  But blot their memory from thy book.    2 Create my nature pure within,  And form my soul averse to sin;  Let thy good Spirit ne'er depart,  Nor hide thy presence from my heart.    3 I cannot live without thy light,  Cast out and banish'd from thy sight:  Thine holy joys, my God, restore,  And guard me that I fall no more.    4 Tho' I have griev'd thy Spirit, Lord,  His help and comfort still afford:  And let a wretch come near thy throne  To plead the merits of thy Son.    5 A broken heart, my God, my King,  Is all the sacrifice I bring;  The God of grace will ne'er despise  A broken heart for sacrifice.    6 My soul lies humbled in the dust,  And owns thy dreadful sentence just;  Look down, O Lord, with pitying eye,  And save the soul condemn'd to die.    7 Then will I teach the world thy ways;  Sinners shall learn thy sovereign grace;  I'll lead them to my Saviour's blood,  And they shall praise a pardoning God.    8 O may thy love inspire my tongue!  Salvation shall be all my song;  And all my powers shall join to bless  The Lord, my strength and righteousness.      Psalm 51:4. 3-13. First Part. C. M.  Original and actual sin confessed and pardoned.    1 Lord, I would spread my sore distress  And guilt before thine eyes;  Against thy laws, against thy grace,  How high my crimes arise.    2 Shouldst thou condemn my soul to hell,  And crush my flesh to dust,  Heaven would approve thy vengeance well,  And earth must own it just.    3 I from the stock of Adam came,  Unholy and unclean;  All my original is shame,  And all my nature sin.    4 Born in a world of guilt, I drew  Contagion with my breath;  And, as my days advanc'd, I grew  A juster prey for death.    5 Cleanse me, O Lord, and cheer my soul  With thy forgiving love;  O, make my broken spirit whole,  And bid my pains remove.    6 Let not thy Spirit quite depart,  Nor drive me from thy face;  Create anew my vicious heart,  And fill it with thy grace.    7 Then will I make thy mercy known  Before the sons of men;  Backsliders shall address thy throne,  And turn to God again.      Psalm 51:5. 14-17. Second Part. C. M.  Repentance and faith in the blood of Christ.    1 O God of mercy! hear my call,  My loads of guilt remove;  Break down this separating wall  That bars me from thy love.    2 Give me the presence of thy grace,  Then my rejoicing tongue  Shall speak aloud thy righteousness,  And make thy praise my song.    3 No blood of goats, nor heifers slain,  For sin could e'er atone;  The death of Christ shall still remain  Sufficient and alone.    4 A soul opprest with sin's desert,  My God will ne'er despise;  A humble groan, a broken heart  Is our best sacrifice.      Psalm 53. 4-6.  Victory and deliverance from persecution.    1 Are all the foes of Sion fools,  Who thus devour her saints?  Do they not know her Saviour rules,  And pities her complaints?    2 They shall be seiz'd with sad surprise;  For God's revenging arm  Scatters the bones of them that rise  To do his children harm.    3 In vain the sons of Satan boast  Of armies in array:  When God has first despis'd their host,  They fall an easy prey.    4 O for a word from Sion's King  Her captives to restore!  Jacob with all his tribes shall sing,  And Judah weep no more.      Psalm 55:1. 1-8 16-18 22. C. M.  Support for the afflicted and tempted soul.    1 O God, my refuge, hear my cries,  Behold my flowing tears,  For earth and hell my hurt devise,  And triumph in my fears.    2 Their rage is levell'd at my life,  My soul with guilt they load,  And fill my thoughts with inward strife  To shake my hope in God.    3 With inward pain my heart-strings sound,  I groan with every breath;  Horror and fear beset me round  Amongst the shades of death,    4 O were I like a feather'd dove,  And innocence had wings,  I'd fly, and make a long remove,  From all these restless things.    5 Let me to some wild desert go,  And find a peaceful home,  Where storms of malice never blow,  Temptations never come.    6 Vain hopes, and vain inventions all  To 'scape the rage of hell!  The mighty God on whom I call  Can save me here as well.    PAUSE.    7 By morning light I'll seek his face,  At noon repeat my cry,  The night shall hear me ask his grace,  Nor will he long deny.    8 God shall preserve my soul from fear,  Or shield me when afraid;  Ten thousand angels must appear  If he command their aid.    9 I cast my burdens on the Lord,  The Lord sustains them all;  My courage rests upon his word  That saints shall never fall.    10 My highest hopes shall not be vain,  My lips shall spread his praise;  While cruel and deceitful men  Scarce live out half their days.      Psalm 55:2. 15-17 19 22. S. M.  Dangerous prosperity; or,  Daily devotions encouraged.    1 Let sinners take their course,  And choose the road to death;  But in the worship of my God  I'll spend my daily breath.    2 My thoughts address his throne  When morning brings the light;  I seek his blessing every noon,  And pay my vows at night.    3 Thou wilt regard my cries,  O my eternal God,  While sinners perish in surprise  Beneath thine angry rod.    4 Because they dwell at ease,  And no sad changes feel,  They neither fear nor trust thy Name,  Nor learn to do thy will.    5 But I with all my cares  Will call upon the Lord,  I'll cast my burdens on his arm,  And rest upon his word,    6 His arm shall well sustain  The children of his love;  The ground on which their safety stands  No earthly power can move.      Psalm 56.  Deliverance from oppression and falsehood; or,  God's care of his people, in answer to faith and prayer.    1 Thou, whose justice reigns on high,  And makes th' oppressor cease,  Behold how envious sinners try  To vex and break my peace!    2 The Sons of violence and lies  Join to devour me, Lord;  But as my hourly dangers rise,  My refuge is thy word.    3 In God most holy, just, and true,  I have repos'd my trust;  Nor will I fear what flesh can do,  The offspring of the dust.    4 They wrest my words to mischief still,  Charge me with unknown faults;  Mischief doth all their councils fill,  And malice all their thoughts.    5 Shall they escape without thy frown?  Must their devices stand?  O cast the haughty sinner down,  And let him know thy hand!    PAUSE.    6 God counts the sorrows of his saints,  Their groans affect his ears;  Thou hast a book for my complaints,  A bottle for my tears.    7 When to thy throne I raise my cry  The wicked fear and flee;  So swift is prayer to reach the sky,  So near is God to me.    8 In thee, most holy, just, and true,  I have repos'd my trust;  Nor will I fear what man can do,  The offspring of the dust.    9 Thy solemn vows are on me, Lord,  Thou shalt receive my praise;  I'll sing, \"how faithful is thy word,  \"How righteous all thy ways!\"    10 Thou hast secur'd my soul from death;  O set thy prisoner free,  That heart and hand, and life and breath  May be employ'd for thee.      Psalm 57.  Praise for protection, grace, and truth.    1 My God, in whom are all the springs  Of boundless love and grace unknown,  Hide me beneath thy spreading wings  Till the dark cloud is overblown.    2 Up to the heavens I send my cry,  The Lord will my desires perform;  He sends his angel from the sky,  And saves me from the threatening storm.    3 Be thou exalted, O my God,  Above the heavens where angels dwell:  Thy power on earth be known abroad,  And land to land thy wonders tell.    4 My heart is fix'd; my song shall raise  Immortal honours to thy Name;  Awake, my tongue, to sound his praise,  My tongue, the glory of my frame.    5 High o'er the earth his mercy reigns,  And reaches to the utmost sky;  His truth to endless years remains,  When lower worlds dissolve and die.    6 Be thou exalted, O my God,  Above the heavens where angels dwell;  Thy power on earth be known abroad,  And land to land thy wonders tell.      Psalm 58. As the 113th Psalm.  Warning to magistrates.    1 Judges, who rule the world by laws,  Will ye despise the righteous cause,  When th' injur'd poor before you stands?  Dare ye condemn the righteous poor,  And let rich sinners 'scape secure,  While gold and greatness bribe your hands?    2 Have ye forgot, or never knew,  That God will judge the judges too?  High in the heavens his justice reigns?  Yet you invade the rights of God,  And send your bold decrees abroad,  To bind the conscience in your chains.    3 A poison'd arrow is your tongue,  The arrow sharp, the poison strong,  And death attends where'er it wounds:  You hear no counsels, cries or tears;  So the deaf adder stops her ears  Against the power of charming sounds.    4 Break out their teeth, eternal God,  Those teeth of lions dy'd in blood;  And crush the serpents in the dust:  As empty chaff when whirlwinds rise,  Before the sweeping tempest flies,  So let their hopes and names be lost.    5 Th' Almighty thunders from the sky,  Their grandeur melts, their titles die,  As hills of snow dissolve and run,  Or snails that perish in their slime,  Or births that come before their time,  Vain births, that never see the sun.    6 Thus shall the vengeance of the Lord  Safety and joy to saints afford;  And all that hear shall join and say,  \"Sure there's a God that rules on high,  \"A God that hears his children cry,  \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13172"],[0,"True Stories of Crime From the District Attorney's Office (#15)"],[1,"tion.  One crook bred another every time he made a victim, and the disease of  crime, the most infectious of all distempers, ate its way unchecked into  the body politic. Broadway was thronged by a prosperous gentry, the  aristocracy and elite of knavery, who dressed resplendently, flourished  like the green bay-tree, and spent their (or rather their victims')  money with the lavish hand of one of Dumas's gentlemen.    But the evil did not stop there. Seeing that their brothers prospered in  New York, and neither being learned in the law nor gifted with the power  of nice discrimination between rogueries, all the other knaves in the  country took it for granted that they had at last found the Elysian  fields and came trooping here by hundreds to ply their various trades.  The McCord case stood out like a cabalistic sign upon a gate-post  telling all the rascals who passed that way that the city was full of  honest folk waiting to be turned into rogues and \"trimmed.\"        \"And presently we did pass a narrow lane, and at the mouth espied a      written stone, telling beggars by a word like a wee pitchfork to go      that way.\"    The tip went abroad that the city was \"good graft\" for everybody, and in  the train of the \"wire-tappers\" thronged the \"flimflammer,\" \"confidence  man,\" \"booster,\" \"capper\" and every sort of affiliated crook, recalling  Charles Reade's account in \"The Cloister and the Hearth\" of Gerard in  Lorraine among their kin of another period:        With them and all they had, 'twas lightly come and lightly go; and      when we left them my master said to me, \"This is thy first lesson,      but to-night we shall be at Hansburgh. Come with me to the 'rotboss'      there, and I'll show thee all our folk and their lays, and      especially 'the lossners,' 'the dutzers,' 'the schleppers,' 'the      gickisses,' 'the schwanfelders,' whom in England we call 'shivering      Jemmies,' 'the suentregers,' 'the schwiegers,' 'the joners,' 'the      sessel-degers,' 'the gennscherers,' in France 'marcandiers a      rifodes,' 'the veranerins,' 'the stabulers,' with a few foreigners      like ourselves, such as 'pietres,' 'francmitoux,' 'polissons,'      'malingreux,' 'traters,' 'rufflers,' 'whipjacks,' 'dommerars,'      'glymmerars,' 'jarkmen,' 'patricos,' 'swadders,' 'autem morts,'      'walking morts,'--\" \"Enow!\" cried I, stopping him, \"art as gleesome      as the evil one a counting of his imps. I'll jot down in my tablet      all these caitiffs and their accursed names: for knowledge is      knowledge. But go among them alive or dead, that will I not with my      good will.\"    And a large part of it was due simply to the fact that seven learned men  upon seven comfortable chairs in the city of Albany had said, many years  ago, that \"neither the law or public policy designs the protection of  rogues in their dealings with each other, or to insure fair dealing and  truthfulness as between each other, in their dishonest practices.\"    The reason that the \"wire-tapping\" game was supposed to come within the  scope of the McCord case was this: it deluded the victim into the  belief that he was going to cheat the pool room by placing a bet upon a  \"sure thing.\" Secondarily it involved, as the dupe supposed, the theft  or disclosure of messages which were being transmitted over the lines of  a telegraph company--a misdemeanor. Hence, it was argued, the victim was  as much a thief as the proposer of the scheme, had parted with his money  for a dishonest purpose, did not come into court with \"clean hands,\" and  no prosecution could be sustained, no matter whether he had been led to  give up his money by means of false pretences or not.    While \"wire-tapping\" differed technically from the precise frauds  committed by McCord and Livingston, it nevertheless closely resembled  those swindlers in general character and came clearly within the  doctrine that the law was not designed to protect \"rogues in their  dealings with each other.\"    No genuine attempt had ever been made to prosecute one of these gentry  until the catastrophe which deprived Felix of his $50,000. The  \"wire-tappers\" rolled in money. Indeed, the fraternity were so liberal  with their \"rolls\" that they became friendly with certain police  officials and intimately affiliated with various politicians of  influence, a friend of one of whom went on Summerfield's bond, when the  latter was being prosecuted for the \"sick-engineer\" frauds to the extent  of $30,000. They regularly went to Europe in the summer season and could  be seen at all the race-courses and gambling resorts of the Continent.  It is amusing to chronicle in this connection that just prior to  McPherson's arrest--that is to say during the summer vacation of  1904--he crossed the Atlantic on the same steamer with an assistant  district attorney of New York county, who failed to recognize his ship  companion and found him an entertaining and agreeable comrade.    The trial came on before Judge Warren W. Foster in Part 3 of the General  Sessions on February 27th, 1906. A special panel quickly supplied a  jury, which, after hearing the evidence, returned in short order a  verdict of guilty. As Judge Foster believed the McCord case to be still  the law of the State, he, of his own motion, and with commendable  independence, immediately arrested judgment. The People thereupon  appealed, the Court of Appeals sustained Judge Foster, and the defendant  was discharged. It is, however, satisfactory to record that the  Legislature at its next session amended the penal code in such a way as  to entirely deprive the wire-tappers and their kind of the erstwhile  protection which they had enjoyed under the law.          V    The Franklin Syndicate      When Robert A. Ammon, a member of the New York bar, was convicted, after  a long trial, on the 17th of June, 1903, of receiving stolen goods, he  had, in the parlance of his class, been \"due\" for a long time. The  stolen property in question was the sum of thirty thousand five hundred  dollars in greenbacks, part of the loot of the notorious \"Franklin  Syndicate,\" devised and engineered by William F. Miller, who later  became the catspaw of his legal adviser, the subject of this history.    Ammon stood at the bar and listened complacently to his sentence of not  less than four years at hard labor in Sing Sing. A sneer curved his lips  as, after nodding curtly to his lawyer, he turned to be led away by the  court attendant. The fortune snatched from his client had procured for  him the most adroit of counsel, the most exhaustive of trials. He knew  that nothing had been left undone to enable him to evade the  consequences of his crime, and he was cynically content.    For years \"Bob\" Ammon had been a familiar figure in the Wall Street  district of New York. Although the legal adviser of swindlers and  confidence men, he was a type of American whose energies, if turned in a  less dubious direction, might well have brought him honorable  distinction. Tall, strong as a bull, bluff, good-natured, reckless and  of iron nerve, he would have given good account of himself as an Indian  fighter or frontiersman. His fine presence, his great vitality, his  coarse humor, his confidence and bravado, had won for him many friends  of a certain kind and engendered a feeling among the public that  somehow, although the associate and adviser of criminals, he was outside  the law, to the circumventing of which his energies were directed.  Unfortunately his experiences with the law had bred in him a contempt  for it which ultimately caused his downfall.    \"The reporters arc bothering you, are they?\" he had said to Miller in  his office. \"Hang them! Send them to me. I'll talk to them!\"    And talk to them he did. He could talk a police inspector or a city  magistrate into a state of vacuous credulity, and needless to say he was  to his clients as a god knowing both good and evil, as well as how to  eschew the one and avoid the other. Miller hated, loathed and feared  him, yet freely entrusted his liberty, and all he had risked his liberty  to gain, to this strange and powerful personality which held him  enthralled by the mere exercise of a physical superiority.    The \"Franklin Syndicate\" had collapsed amid the astonished outcries of  its thousands of victims, on November 24th, 1899, when, under the advice  and with the assistance of Ammon, its organizer, \"520 per cent. Miller,\"  had fled to Canada. It was nearly four years later, in June, 1903, that  Ammon, arraigned at the bar of justice as a criminal, heard Assistant  District Attorney Nott call William F. Miller, convict, to the stand to  testify against him. A curious contrast they presented as they faced one  another; the emaciated youth of twenty-five, the hand of Death already  tightly fastened upon his meagre frame, coughing, hollow-cheeked,  insignificant, flat-nosed, almost repulsive, who dragged himself to the  witness chair, and the swaggering athlete who glared at him from the bar  surrounded by his cordon of able counsel. As Ammon fixed his penetrating  gaze upon his former client, Miller turned pale and dropped his eyes.  Then the prosecutor, realizing the danger of letting the old hypnotic  power return, even for an instant, quickly stepped between them. Miller  raised his eyes and smiled, and those who heard knew that this miserable  creature had been through the fire and come forth to speak true things.    The trial of Ammon involved practically the reproving of the case  against Miller, for which the latter had been convicted and sentenced to  ten years in State's prison, whence he now issued like one from the tomb  to point the skeleton, incriminating finger at his betrayer. But the  case began by the convict-witness testifying that the whole business was  a miserable fraud from start to finish, carried on and guided by the  advice of the defendant. He told how he, a mere boy of twenty-one,  burdened"]]]
