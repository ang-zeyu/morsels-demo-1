You put meat into  jars in the raw state and extend the sterilizing period or you can  cook the meat partially or completely and then sterilize for a shorter  period of time. Of course a reliable method of canning meat must be  used, such as the cold-pack process, where the sterilizing is done in  the tin or jar in either boiling water or steam under pressure. We  usually recommend the partial cooking, roasting or boiling of the meat  before canning especially for beginners. If you are a beginner in the  business of cold-pack canning then by all means cook the meat before  putting it in cans. If you have canned peas, beans and corn  successfully for years then you are ready for all kinds of raw meat  canning.    To save criticism of the cold-pack method of canning meat and to guard  against any danger from eating poorly prepared and improperly  sterilized meat we do not urge beginners to experiment with meat,  although the meat can be safely canned by any one whether new at the  canning game or a veteran in it if directions are carefully followed.  But it is the big \"If\" that we have to watch.    Many farmers and farmerettes are canning meats of all kinds all over  the country and there is never a can lost. We need more meat canning  done at home and you can do it if you will practice cleanliness in all  your work and follow directions.    The fear of getting botulinus bacteria from eating canned meat is just  a \"bug-a-boo.\" It should be clearly understood that botulism is one of  the very rare maladies. The chances for getting it by eating canned  goods, say the experts, is rather less than the chances from dying of  lockjaw every time you scratch your finger. To regard every can as a  source of botulism is worse than regarding every dog as a source of  hydrophobia. Moreover, for the very timid, there is the comforting  certainty that the exceedingly slight danger is completely eliminated  by re-cooking the canned food for a short time before eating it.    There are always a few cases of illness traceable to bad food, not  only to canned food but to spoiled meats, fish, bad milk, oysters and  a number of things. There are also cases of injury and death by street  accidents, but we do not for that reason stop using the streets. If  you put good meat into the can and do your canning right then you will  have good results. Never put into a can meat that is about ready to  spoil, thinking thereby to \"save it.\"    If you want to be absolutely sure, even if the jar of meat seems  perfectly fresh when it is opened, you can re-cook the meat, thus  insuring yourself against any possibility of botulinus poisoning. So  you see, there is nothing at all alarming about that frightful  sounding word \"botulinus.\" Using fresh products, doing the canning  properly and reheating before serving eliminates all danger.    For canning meat, tin cans are in most respects superior to glass, as  they eliminate all danger of breakage, preserve the meat just as well  as glass, and by excluding the light prevent any change of color. If  you use glass jars be sure to get the best brand of jar rubbers on the  market. This is very important.    If, as I have said, you are a beginner--cook the meat first by frying,  roasting, broiling, baking or stewing--just as you would prepare it  for immediate use. The meat is usually seasoned according to taste and  is cooked until thoroughly heated through, before putting in the cans.  Do not cook until tender as that will be too long with the additional  sterilizing. If too tender it will fall apart and be unappetizing  although perfectly good. See that nothing is wasted in the canning. If  you are canning a young steer or a calf you would go about it as  follows:    Select the meat that you would ordinarily want. Slice the meat wanted  for steak. What is not suited for either of these can be used for  stews, or be put through the meat grinder and made into sausage meat,  formed into little cakes, fried and canned. What meat is left clinging  to all bones will be utilized when the bones are boiled for soup  stock. The sinews, the head and the feet, after being cleaned may be  used for soup stock also.    The liver should be soaked in water, the coarse veins cut out and the  liver skinned and prepared any way that is desired before canning it  or it may be made into liver sausage. The heart can be used for  goulash. The kidneys should be soaked in salt water, split open and  the little sack removed; then they can be either stewed or fried and  then canned. The sweetbreads may be prepared in various ways and then  canned.    The brain is soaked in water to remove the blood, and the membrane  enclosing it is removed. It can be fried or prepared in any favorite  way and then canned. The ox tail is used for soup. The tongue is  soaked in water, scrubbed, cleaned, salted, boiled, skinned and packed  in cans with some soup stock added.    If you do not care to use the head for soup stock and if it comes from  a young animal, split it open and soak in cold water. Use a brush and  scrub thoroughly. Remove the eyes and mucous membrane of the nostrils  and then boil it. After it is boiled, remove all meat and make a mock  turtle stew or ragout. Prepare the tripe as for table use and then  can.    After the soup stock is made and the bones are cracked for a second  cooking, the bones need not be thrown away. You can dry them, run them  through a bone"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13789"],[0,"Great Britain and the American Civil War (#15)"],[1,"with slavery was a  weapon for the friends of the South, but it could not wholly still that  issue. Even in the _Times_, through the medium of W.H. Russell's  descriptive letters, there appeared caustic criticisms. He wrote in his  \"Diary,\" \"I declare that to me the more orderly, methodical, and perfect  the arrangements for economizing slave labour ... are, the more hateful  and odious does slavery become[118],\" and in his letter of May 8, from  Montgomery, having witnessed an auction sale of slaves he stated:         \"I am neither sentimentalist nor Black Republican, nor negro       worshipper, but I confess the sight caused a strange thrill       through my heart. I tried in vain to make myself familiar       with the fact that I could, for the sum of $975, become as       absolutely the owner of that mass of blood, bones, sinew,       flesh and brains as of the horse which stood by my side.       There was no sophistry which could persuade me the man was       not a man--he was, indeed, by no means my brother, but       assuredly he was a fellow creature[119].\"    This was hard printing for the _Times_, in its new advocacy of the  South, and Russell's description was made much of by the _Westminster  Review_ and other publications that soon began to sound again the  \"issue\" of slavery[120]. Yet the _Westminster_ itself in the same  article decried the folly of the Northern attempt at reconquest. So also  thought even John Bright at the moment, when expressing himself  privately to friends in America[121].    Slavery, then, still remained an issue before the British public, but of  what use was it to upbraid the South, if a new world State were in fact  born? And if a State in power, why not give it prompt recognition? The  extreme British anti-slavery opponents feared that this was just what  the Government was inclined to do, and with promptness. Here and there  meetings were hurriedly called to protest against recognition[122]. This  fear was unfounded. Neither in London nor at Washington was there any  official inclination to hasten recognition. Lyons had held up to Seward  the logic of such action, if British trade were illegally interfered  with. By April 9 Lyons was aware that the so-called Radical Party in the  Cabinet would probably have its way, that conciliation would no longer  be attempted, and that a coercive policy toward the South was soon to  follow. On that date he wrote to Russell stating that people in  Washington seemed so convinced that Europe would _not_ interfere to  protect its trade that they were willing to venture any act embarrassing  to that trade. He himself was still insisting, but with dwindling  confidence, that the trade must not be interfered with under any  circumstances. And in a second letter of this same date, he repeated to  Russell his advice of treating the Southern Commissioners with  deference. Any rebuff to them, he asserts again, will but increase the  Northern confidence that they may do anything without provoking the  resistance of England[123].    Like a good diplomat Lyons was merely pushing the argument for all it  was worth, hoping to prevent an injury to his country, yet if that  injury did come (provided it were sanctioned by the law of nations) he  did not see in it an injury sufficient to warrant precipitate action by  Great Britain. When indeed the Southern capture of Fort Sumter in  Charleston harbour finally brought the actual clash of arms, Lyons  expressed himself with regard to other elements in the struggle  previously neglected in his correspondence. On April 15 describing to  Russell the fall of Sumter, he stated that civil war had at last begun.  The North he believed to be very much more powerful than the South, the  South more \"eager\" and united as yet, but, he added, \"the taint of  slavery will render the cause of the South loathsome to the civilized  world.\" It was true that \"commercial intercourse with the cotton States  is of vital importance to manufacturing nations[124]....\" but Lyons was  now facing an actual situation rather than a possible one, and as will  be seen later, he soon ceased to insist that an interruption of this  \"commercial intercourse\" gave reasonable ground for recognition of  the South.    With the fall of Fort Sumter and the European recognition that a civil  war was actually under way in America, a large number of new and vexing  problems was presented to Russell. His treatment of them furnishes the  subject matter of later chapters. For the period previous to April,  1861, British official attitude may be summed up in the statement that  the British Minister at Washington hoped against hope that some solution  might be found for the preservation of the Union, but that at the same  time, looking to future British interests and possibly believing also  that his attitude would tend to preserve the Union, he asserted  vehemently the impossibility of any Northern interference with British  trade to Southern ports. Across the water, Russell also hoped faintly  that there might be no separation. Very soon, however, believing that  separation inevitable and the disruption of the Union final, he fixed  his hope on peaceful rather than warlike secession. Even of this,  however, he had little real expectation, but neither he nor anyone else  in England, nor even in America, had any idea that the war would be a  long and severe one. It is evident that he was already considering the  arrival of that day when recognition must be granted to a new,  independent and slave-holding State. But this estimate of the future is  no proof that the Russian Ambassador's accusation of British  governmental pleasure in American disruption was justified[125].  Russell, cautious in refusing to pledge himself to Dallas, was using  exactly such caution as a Foreign Secretary was bound to exercise. He  would have been a rash man who, in view of the uncertainty and  irresolution of Northern statesmen, would have committed Great Britain  in March, 1861, to a definite line of policy.    On April 6, Russell was still instructing Lyons to recommend  reconciliation. April 8, Dallas communicated to Russell an instruction  from Seward dated March 9, arguing on lines of \"traditional friendship\"  against a British recognition of the Confederacy. Russell again refused  to pledge his Government, but on April 12 he wrote to Lyons that British  Ministers were \"in no hurry to recognize the separation as complete and  final[126].\" In the early morning of that same day the armed conflict in  America had begun, and on the day following, April 13, the first  Southern victory had been recorded in the capture of Fort Sumter. The  important question which the man at the head of the British Foreign  Office had now immediately to decide was, what was to be England's  attitude, under international law, toward the two combatants in  America. In deciding this question, neither sentiment nor ideals of  morality, nor humanitarianism need play any part; England's _first_ need  and duty were to determine and announce for the benefit of her citizens  the correct position, under International law, which must be assumed in  the presence of certain definite facts.

In some respects the work is historically  untrustworthy since internal evidence makes clear that the greater part  of it was written before 1846, in which year Grattan retired from his  post in Boston. In general he wrote scathingly of America, and as his  son succeeded to the Boston consulship, Grattan probably thought it  wiser to postpone publication. I have found no review of the work which  treats it otherwise than as an up-to-date description of 1859.
