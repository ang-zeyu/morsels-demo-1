When solution is complete, add 6 cc. of concentrated  sulphuric acid to each casserole, and evaporate on the steam bath  until the solution is nearly colorless (Note 2). Cover the casseroles  and heat over the flame of the burner, holding the casserole in  the hand and rotating it slowly to hasten evaporation and prevent  spattering, until the heavy white fumes of sulphuric anhydride are  freely evolved (Note 3). Cool the casseroles, add 100 cc. of water  (measured), and boil gently until the ferric sulphate is dissolved;  pour the warm solution through the reductor which has been previously  washed; proceed as described under standardization, taking pains  to use the same volume and strength of acid and the same volume of  wash-water as there prescribed, and titrate with the permanganate  solution in the reductor flask, using the ferrous sulphate solution if  the end-point should be overstepped.    From the corrected volume of permanganate solution used, calculate the  percentage of iron (Fe) in the limonite.    [Note 1: The preliminary roasting is usually necessary because, even  though the sulphuric acid would subsequently char the carbonaceous  matter, certain nitrogenous bodies are not thereby rendered insoluble  in the acid, and would be oxidized by the permanganate.]    [Note 2: The temperature of the steam bath is not sufficient to  volatilize sulphuric acid. Solutions may, therefore, be left to  evaporate overnight without danger of evaporation to dryness.]    [Note 3: The hydrochloric acid, both free and combined, is displaced  by the less volatile sulphuric acid at its boiling point. Ferric  sulphate separates at this point, since there is no water to hold  it in solution and care is required to prevent bumping. The ferric  sulphate usually has a silky appearance and is easily distinguished  from the flocculent silica which often remains undissolved.]      !Zimmermann-Reinhardt Procedure!      !Method (B)!    PROCEDURE.--Grind the mineral to a fine powder. Weigh out two portions  of about 0.5 gram each into small porcelain crucibles. Proceed with  the solution of the ore, treat the residue, if necessary, and reduce  the iron by the addition of stannous chloride, followed by mercuric  chloride, as described for the bichromate process on page 56. Dilute  the solution to about 400 cc. with cold water, add 10 cc. of the  manganous sulphate titrating solution (Note 1, page 68) and titrate  with the standard potassium permanganate solution to a faint pink  (Note 1).    From the standardization data already obtained calculate the  percentage of iron (Fe) in the limonite.    [Note 1: It has already been noted that hydrochloric acid reacts  slowly in cold solutions with potassium permanganate. It is, however,  possible to obtain a satisfactory, although somewhat fugitive  end-point in the presence of manganous sulphate and phosphoric acid.  The explanation of the part played by these reagents is somewhat  obscure as yet. It is possible that an intermediate manganic compound  is formed which reacts rapidly with the ferrous compounds--thus in  effect catalyzing the oxidizing process.    While an excess of hydrochloric acid is necessary for the successful  reduction of the iron by stannous chloride, too large an amount  should be avoided in order to lessen the chance of reduction of the  permanganate by the acid during titration.]          DETERMINATION OF THE OXIDIZING POWER OF PYROLUSITE    INDIRECT OXIDATION      Pyrolusite, when pure, consists of manganese dioxide. Its value as an  oxidizing agent, and for the production of chlorine, depends upon the  percentage of MnO_{2} in the sample. This percentage is determined  by an indirect method, in which the manganese dioxide is reduced and  dissolved by an excess of ferrous sulphate or oxalic acid in the  presence of sulphuric acid, and the unused excess determined by  titration with standard permanganate solution.    PROCEDURE.--Grind the mineral in an agate mortar until no grit  whatever can be detected under the pestle (Note 1). Transfer it to a  stoppered weighing-tube, and weigh out two portions of about 0.5 gram  into beakers (400-500 cc.) Read Note 2, and then calculate in each  case the weight of oxalic acid (H_{2}C_{2}O_{4}.2H_{2}O) required to  react with the weights of pyrolusite taken. The reaction involved is    MnO_{2} + H_{2}C_{2}O_{4}(2H_{2}O) + H_{2}SO_{4} --> MnSO_{4} +  2CO_{2} + 4H_{2}O.    Weigh out about 0.2 gram in excess of this quantity of !pure! oxalic  acid into the corresponding beakers, weighing the acid accurately and  recording the weight in the notebook. Pour into each beaker 25 cc. of  water and 50 cc. of dilute sulphuric acid (1:5), cover and warm the  beaker and its contents gently until the evolution of carbon dioxide  ceases (Note 3). If a residue remains which is sufficiently colored to  obscure the end-reaction of the permanganate, it must be removed by  filtration.    Finally, dilute the solution to 200-300 cc., heat the solution to a  temperature just below boiling, add 15 cc. of a manganese sulphate  solution and while hot, titrate for the excess of the oxalic acid with  standard permanganate solution (Notes 4 and 5).    From the corrected volume of the solution required, calculate the  amount of oxalic acid undecomposed by the pyrolusite; subtract this  from the total quantity of acid used, and calculate the weight of  manganese dioxide which would react with the balance of the acid, and  from this the percentage in the sample.    [Note 1: The success of the analysis is largely dependent upon the  fineness of the powdered mineral. If properly ground, solution should  be complete in fifteen minutes or less.]    [Note 2: A moderate excess of oxalic acid above that required to react  with the pyrolusite is necessary to promote solution; otherwise the  residual quantity of oxalic acid would be so small that the last  particles of the mineral would scarcely dissolve. It is also desirable  that a sufficient excess of the acid should be present to react with a  considerable volume of the permanganate solution during the titration,  thus increasing the accuracy of the process. On the other hand, the  excess of oxalic acid should not be so large as to react with more of  the permanganate solution than is contained in a 50 cc. burette. If  the pyrolusite under examination is known to be of high grade, say 80  per cent pure, or above the calculation of the oxalic acid needed may  be based upon an assumption that the mineral is all MnO_{2}. If the  quality of the mineral is unknown, it is better to weigh out three  portions instead of two and to add to one of these the amount of  oxalic prescribed, assuming complete purity of the mineral. Then run  in the permanganate solution from a pipette or burette to determine  roughly the amount required. If the volume exceeds the contents of a  burette, the amount of oxalic acid added to the other two portions is  reduced accordingly.]    [Note 3: Care should be taken that the sides of the beaker are not  overheated, as oxalic acid would be decomposed by heat alone if  crystallization should occur on the sides of the vessel. Strong  sulphuric acid also decomposes the oxalic acid. The dilute acid  should, therefore, be prepared before it is poured into the beaker.]    [Note 4: Ferrous ammonium sulphate, ferrous sulphate, or iron wire  may be substituted for the oxalic acid. The reaction is then the  following:    2 FeSO_{4} + MnO_{2} + 2H_{2}SO_{4} --> Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + 2H_{2}O    The excess of ferrous iron may also be determined by titration with  potassium bichromate, if desired. Care is required to prevent the  oxidation of the iron by the air, if ferrous salts are employed.]    [Note 5: The oxidizing power of pyrolusite may be determined by other  volumetric processes, one of which is outlined in the following  reactions:    MnO_{2} + 4HCl --> MnCl_{2} + Cl_{2} + 2H_{2}O  Cl_{2} + 2KI --> I_{2} + 2KCl  I_{2} + 2Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3} --> Na_{2}S_{4}O_{6} + 2NaI.    The chlorine generated by the pyrolusite is passed into a solution of  potassium iodide. The liberated iodine is then determined by titration  with sodium thiosulphate, as described on page 78. This is a direct  process, although it involves three steps.]          IODIMETRY      The titration of iodine against sodium thiosulphate, with starch as an  indicator, may perhaps be regarded as the most accurate of volumetric  processes. The thiosulphate solution may be used in both acid and  neutral solutions to measure free iodine and the latter may, in turn,  serve as a measure of any substance capable of liberating iodine from  potassium iodide under suitable conditions for titration, as, for  example, in the process outlined in Note 5 on page 74.    The fundamental reaction upon which iodometric processes are based is  the following:    I_{2} + 2 Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3} --> 2 NaI + Na_{2}S_{4}O_{6}.    This reaction between iodine and sodium thiosulphate, resulting in  the formation of the compound Na_{2}S_{4}O_{6}, called sodium  tetrathionate, is quantitatively exact, and differs in that  respect from the action of chlorine or bromine, which oxidize the  thiosulphate, but not quantitatively.    NORMAL SOLUTIONS OF IODINE AND SODIUM THIOSULPHATE    If the formulas of sodium thiosulphate and sodium tetrathionate are  written in a manner to show the atoms of oxygen associated  with sulphur atoms in each, thus, 2(Na_{2}).S_{2}O_{2} and  Na_{2}O.S_{4}O_{5}, it is plain that in the tetrathionate there are  five atoms of oxygen associated with sulphur, instead of the four  in the two molecules of the thiosulphate taken together. Although,  therefore, the iodine contains no oxygen, the two atoms of iodine  have, in effect, brought about the addition of one oxygen atoms to the  sulphur atoms. That is the same thing as saying that 253.84 grams of  iodine (I_{2}) are equivalent to 16 grams of oxygen; hence, since 8  grams of oxygen is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1279"],[0,"Poems and Songs of Robert Burns (#15)"],[1," snout,       His eldritch squeel an' gestures,       O how they fire the heart devout,       Like cantharidian plaisters       On sic a day!

My musie, tir'd wi' mony a sonnet       On gown, an' ban', an' douse black bonnet,       Is grown right eerie now she's done it,       Lest they should blame her,       An' rouse their holy thunder on it       An anathem her.         I own 'twas rash, an' rather hardy,       That I, a simple, country bardie,       Should meddle wi' a pack sae sturdy,       Wha, if they ken me,       Can easy, wi' a single wordie,       Lowse hell upon me.         But I gae mad at their grimaces,       Their sighin, cantin, grace-proud faces,       Their three-mile prayers, an' half-mile graces,       Their raxin conscience,       Whase greed, revenge, an' pride disgraces       Waur nor their nonsense.         There's Gaw'n, misca'd waur than a beast,       Wha has mair honour in his breast       Than mony scores as guid's the priest       Wha sae abus'd him:       And may a bard no crack his jest       What way they've us'd him?         See him, the poor man's friend in need,       The gentleman in word an' deed--       An' shall his fame an' honour bleed       By worthless, skellums,       An' not a muse erect her head       To cowe the blellums?         O Pope, had I thy satire's darts       To gie the rascals their deserts,       I'd rip their rotten, hollow hearts,       An' tell aloud       Their jugglin hocus-pocus arts       To cheat the crowd.         God knows, I'm no the thing I should be,       Nor am I even the thing I could be,       But twenty times I rather would be       An atheist clean,       Than under gospel colours hid be       Just for a screen.         An honest man may like a glass,       An honest man may like a lass,       But mean revenge, an' malice fause       He'll still disdain,       An' then cry zeal for gospel laws,       Like some we ken.         They take religion in their mouth;       They talk o' mercy, grace, an' truth,       For what?--to gie their malice skouth       On some puir wight,       An' hunt him down, owre right and ruth,       To ruin straight.         All hail, Religion! maid divine!       Pardon a muse sae mean as mine,       Who in her rough imperfect line       Thus daurs to name thee;       To stigmatise false friends of thine       Can ne'er defame thee.         Tho' blotch't and foul wi' mony a stain,       An' far unworthy of thy train,       With trembling voice I tune my strain,       To join with those       Who boldly dare thy cause maintain       In spite of foes:         In spite o' crowds, in spite o' mobs,       In spite o' undermining jobs,     "]]]
