The druggist said it could not be paint, but must be some sort of  staining, and he gave Frank a preparation.    Frank went back and tried the stuff on Harry. It removed a certain  amount of the stain, but did not remove it all.    At last, being thoroughly worn out, Rattleton said:    \"I'll give it up for to-night, fellows. Perhaps I'll be able to get the  rest off in the morning. I'll poultice my face and neck. But you'll  have to watch out, Frank. They say they will use you worse than this  when they get hold of you.\"    For the time the sophomores seemed to have the best of the game.          CHAPTER XII.    FRESHMAN AGAINST SOPHOMORE.      On the following morning a large piece of cardboard Swung from the door  of Merriwell and Rattleton's room in Mrs. Harrington's boarding house.  On the cardboard was this inscription:      \"Good-morning!    Have you used    Soap?\"    Harry was up at an early hour industriously scrubbing away. He succeeded  fairly well, but despite his utmost efforts the coloring refused to come  off entirely.    And it was absolutely necessary that he should attend chapel.    On their way to chapel Frank and Harry came face to face with Professor  Such, who peered at them sharply and said:    \"Good-morning, gentlemen.\"    \"Good-morning, professor,\" returned the boys.    Harry tried to keep behind Frank, so that his face would not be noticed.  The professor was nearsighted, but he immediately noted Rattleton's  queer actions, and he placed himself in front of the boys, adjusting  his spectacles.    \"Hang his curiosity!\" muttered Harry in disgust.    \"Eh?\" said the professor, scratching his chin with one finger and  peering keenly at Harry. \"Did you speak, sir?\"    \"Yes, sir--I mean no, sir,\" spluttered Harry, while Frank stepped aside  and stood laughing silently to himself.    \"I thought you did. Er--what's the matter with your face, young man?\"    \"That's the result of my last attack of chilblains,\" said Harry,  desperately. \"They hent to my wed--I mean they went to my head.\"    \"Eh?\"    The professor seemed to doubt if he had heard correctly, while Merriwell  nearly exploded.    Rattleton looked frightened when he came to think what he had said. He  felt like taking to his heels and running for his life.    \"Chilblains, sir?\" came severely from Professor Such. \"Sir--sir, do not  attempt to be facetious with me! You will regret it if you do!\"    Cold sweat started out on Harry's forehead, and he looked appealingly  toward his companion; but Frank had turned away to conceal his  merriment.    \"I--I don't think I--I understood your--your question,\" stammered  Harry. \"I'm a little heard of haring--I mean hard of hearing.\"    \"I asked you what was the matter with your face, sir.\"    \"Oh, my face! Ha! ha! He! he! I thought you said something about my  pace, because I was walking so slowly. That made me fancy you were  interested to know what ails my feet. Excuse me! I beg your pardon,  professor!\"    \"Hum!\" coughed the professor, again scratching his chin with the tip of  his finger, while he peered through his spectacles, plainly still  somewhat suspicious. \"It is rather remarkable that you should get things  mixed in such a manner.\"    \"I am not feeling well, professor, not at all.\"    And it was apparent to Frank that Harry told the truth.    \"You are not looking well,\" came somewhat sarcastically from Professor  Such's lips. \"Your countenance has a strangely mottled hue.\"    \"It comes from Injun jestion,\" explained Merriwell, coming to his  roommate's relief.    \"Eh? From what, sir.\"    \"From indigestion,\" said Frank, very soberly. \"He is much troubled that  way.\"    \"Much troubled! much troubled!\" exclaimed the professor, whose ear had  been offended and who immediately turned his attention on Frank. \"I  advise you to be somewhat more choice and careful of your language,  young man. There is a right and a wrong use of words.\"    Just then the chapel bell clanged, and the professor exclaimed:    \"Bless me! we'll be late if we're not careful!\"    Away he hurried.    Frank and Harry followed him, and as they went along Harry expressed his  feelings forcibly and violently.    \"How dare you howl before me?\" laughed Frank.    \"Excuse me,\" said Rattleton. \"I didn't know you wanted to howl first.\"    At chapel Harry felt that the eyes of everybody were upon him. He kept  one hand up to his face as much as possible, but he saw the sophomores  smiling covertly and winking among themselves. He longed to get even;  that was his one burning ambition and desire.    When the service was over the freshmen stood and bowed to the faculty as  they passed out. They were supposed to keep bowing to the seniors,  juniors and sophomores, but that custom had long been a dead letter at  Yale. The freshmen had become too independent for such a thing.    However, they stood and saw the upper classmen go past, and it seemed  to poor Harry that every fellow stared at him and grinned. The sophs  added to his misery and anger by winking at him, and Tad Horner ventured  to go through a swift pantomime of taking a scalp.    \"Oh, I am liable to have yours yet,\" thought Harry.    On their way back to their rooms Harry and Frank were greeted by all  sorts of calls and persiflage from the sophomores, who had gathered in  knots to watch them pass.    This sort of chaffing gave Rattleton \"that tired feeling,\" as he  expressed it, and by the time they reached their room he was in a  desperate mood.    \"I'll get even!\" he vowed, fiercely. \"I'll do it.\"    \"Go ahead--you can do it,\" laughed Frank. \"You can do anybody.\"    Then Harry flung a book at him, which Frank skillfully caught and  returned with the utmost politeness.    At breakfast Rattleton was chafed by the freshmen, and he boiled more  than ever.    \"Somebody has my coat, vest, hat, shirt and undershirt,\" he said as he  thought the affair over. \"I had to go home in a linen duster which I got  down to Billy's last night. I don't care so much for the clothes I lost,  but I'd like to know who has 'em. I'd sue him!\"    But after breakfast an expressman appeared with a bundle for Rattleton,  and in the bundle were the missing articles.    The sophomores were jubilant, and they taunted the freshmen. They said  the fate that had befallen Rattleton was simply a warning. It was  nothing beside what might happen.    For the time the freshmen were forced to remain silent, but they felt  that the sophomores had not evened up matters by any means. And the  affair would not be dropped.    During the afternoon of that day it rained for at least two hours, and  it did not clear up and let the sun out, so there was plenty of dirt and  mud at nightfall.    Then it was that Rattleton some way found out that a number of  sophomores who dined at a club on York Street were going to attend a  party that evening. It was to be a swell affair on Temple Street, and  the sophs were certain to wear their dress suits.    \"They'll din for dresser--I mean dress for dinner,\" spluttered Harry as  he was telling Frank. \"It's certain they'll go directly from dinner to  the party.\"    \"Well, what has worked its way into your head?\"    \"A scheme.\"    \"Give it to us.\"    \"We'll be ready for 'em when they come from dinner, and we'll give 'em a  rush. They're not likely to be in any condition to attend a party after  we are through with them. What do you say, old man? What do you think  of it?\"    \"We are likely to get enough of rushing in the annual rush, but I'm with  you if you want to carry this job through.\"    \"All right, then, we'll do it. We'll give those sophs a warm time. I  have been grouchy all day, but I begin to feel better now.\"    So Frank and Harry communicated the plan to their friends, and a party  gathered in their room immediately after supper.    Dismal Jones was out as a scout, and he had agreed to let them know when  the sophomores left their club. They were inclined to take much more  time in dining than the freshmen.    Pretty soon Jones came racing up the stairs and burst into the room.    \"Come on, fellows!\" he cried. \"The sophs are leaving their club, and  there's lots of 'em wearing dress suits. We'll have a picnic with 'em!\"    Dismal seldom got excited, but now he was quite aroused.    The freshmen caught up their caps and hurried downstairs. They were soon  on the street, and they hastened to meet their natural enemies.    The sophomores had formed by twos, with Browning and Emery in advance.  It was true that many of them were in dress suits, and they were not a  little disturbed when they saw the solid body of freshmen coming swiftly  to meet them.    To pass on the right the sophomores were entitled to the inside of the  sidewalk, and although they would have given much to avoid the  encounter, they formed solidly and prepared to defend their rights.    The freshmen also formed in a compact mass, and came on with a rush,  keeping hard up against the wall.    \"Turn to the right! Turn to the right!\"    The sophomores uttered the cry as they hugged the wall on the inside.    \"Sweep 'em off! Sweep 'em off!\"    That was the cry that came from the determined freshmen.    \"Hold on! hold on!\" ordered Browning. \"There is a law for this!\"    \"Then you will have to produce officers to enforce it,\" laughed Frank  Merriwell.    \"But there is a regular time for rushing.\"    \"This is not a regular rush, so we don't mind.\"    \"But you fellows have no right to do it!\"    \"Is that so?\" was the derisive retort. \"Hear the sophs squeal fellows!  Oh, my! but this is funny!\"    \"Stop a minute and we will argue this matter, freshies,\" invited  Browning, who was thoroughly disgusted over the prospect.    Then the whole crowd of freshmen roared with laughter.    \"Hear the baby cry!\" they shouted. \"He is begging! Ha! ha! ha!\"    Browning's face was crimson with anger and confusion.    \"You are an insolent lot of young ruffians!\" he snapped, \"and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1112"],[0,"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (#15)"],[1,"        Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.      Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?      Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.      John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,      One of our order, to associate me      Here in this city visiting the sick,      And finding him, the searchers of the town,      Suspecting that we both were in a house      Where the infectious pestilence did reign,      Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,      So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.      Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?      John. I could not send it- here it is again-      Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,      So fearful were they of infection.      Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,      The letter was not nice, but full of charge,      Of dear import; and the neglecting it      May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,      Get me an iron crow and bring it straight      Unto my cell.      John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.      Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.      Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.      She will beshrew me much that Romeo      Hath had no notice of these accidents;      But I will write again to Mantua,      And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-      Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.          Scene III.  Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.    Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].        Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.      Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.      Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,      Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.      So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread      (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)      But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,      As signal that thou hear'st something approach.      Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.      Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone      Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]      Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew      (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)      Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;      Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.      The obsequies that I for thee will keep      Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.                                                      Whistle Boy.      The boy gives warning something doth approach.      What cursed foot wanders this way to-night      To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?      What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]           Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,                      and a crow of iron.        Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.      Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning      See thou deliver it to my lord and father.      Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,      Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof      And do not interrupt me in my course.      Why I descend into this bed of death      Is partly to behold my lady's face,      But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger      A precious ring- a ring that I must use      In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.      But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry      In what I farther shall intend to do,      By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint      And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.      The time and my intents are savage-wild,      More fierce and more inexorable far      Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.      Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.      Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.      Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.      Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.      His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]      Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,      Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,      Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,      And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.                                             Romeo opens the tomb.      Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague      That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief      It is supposed the fair creature died-      And here is come to do some villanous shame      To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.      Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!      Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?      Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.      Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.      Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.      Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.      Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;      Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,      But not another sin upon my head      By urging me to fury. O, be gone!      By heaven, I love thee better than myself,      For I come hither arm'd against myself.      Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say      A madman's mercy bid thee run away.      Par. I do defy thy, conjuration      And apprehend thee for a felon here.      Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!                                                       They fight.

If thou be merciful,      Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]      Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.      Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!      What said my man when my betossed soul      Did not attend him as we rode? I think      He told me Paris should have married Juliet.      Said he not so? or did I dream it so?      Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet      To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,      One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!      I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.      A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,      For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes      This vault a feasting presence full of light.      Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.                                           [Lays him in the tomb.]      How oft when men are at the point of death      Have they been merry! which their keepers call      A lightning before death. O, how may I      Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!      Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,      Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.      Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet      Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,      And death's pale flag is not advanced there.      Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?      O, what more favour can I do to thee      Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain      To sunder his that was thine enemy?      Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,      Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe      That unsubstantial Death is amorous,      And that the lean abhorred monster keeps      Thee here in dark to be his paramour?      For fear of that I still will stay with thee      And never from this palace of dim night      Depart again. Here, here will I remain      With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here      Will I set up my everlasting rest      And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars      From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!      Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you      The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss      A dateless bargain to engrossing death!      Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!      Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on      The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!      Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!      Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.        Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.        Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night      Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?      Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.      Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,      What torch is yond that vainly lends his light      To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,      It burneth in the Capels' monument.      Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,      One that you love.      Friar. Who is it?      Bal. Romeo.      Friar. How long hath he been there?      Bal. Full half an hour.      Friar. Go with me to the vault.      Bal. I dare not, sir.      My master knows not but I am gone hence,      And fearfully did menace me with death      If I did stay to look on his intents.      Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.      O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.      Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,      I dreamt my master and another fought,      And that my master slew him.      Friar. Romeo!      Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains      The stony entrance of this sepulchre?      What mean these masterless and gory swords      To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]      Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?      And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour      Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.                                                     Juliet rises.      Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?      I do remember well where I should be,      And there I am. Where is my Romeo?      Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest      Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.      A greater power than we can contradict      Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.      Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;      And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee      Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.      Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.      Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.      Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
