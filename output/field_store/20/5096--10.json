New localities they abhor, and the greater part of  London is new, in the sense that very many old districts and streets  have been rebuilt, or entirely swept away by the march of improvement  and the increasing desire for wide thoroughfares and open spaces.  What  place more famous once than Little Britain, which during the last twenty  or thirty years has swallowed up Duck Lane--another book-hunting  locality--bodily?  It was here that Thomas Britton, a coal-dealer,  prowled around during his spare moments, pouncing upon anything and  everything that took his fancy; rejoicing especially in works of magic,  witchcraft, and astrology, either printed or in manuscript. The  catalogue of his library is extant, and it is clear that he was a very  far-sighted and keen-scented man, and one, too, who was blessed with a  taste and discrimination most rare among dealers in small coal.  In  Little Britain 'Paradise Lost' went begging.  The stalls must have been  littered with the very first, or 1667, issue, for in that year the Earl  of Dorset had a copy of it thrust under his nose and pressed upon him by  a bookseller who complained most bitterly that he could not get rid of  his stock.  About the year 1760 the whole of the trade had vanished from  Little Britain, though at the present time the once-famous thoroughfare  boasts one bookseller and also one newsagent, the sole representatives  of past times.  As for the rest of the denizens, they follow the more  prosaic occupations of builders, bootmakers, butchers, hairdressers,  restaurant-keepers and publicans, the last-named being especially in  evidence.  In this locality, as in many others, the thirst for knowledge  has been quenched, and the thirst for beer become almighty.    So, too, Moorfields was once classic ground, as also the Poultry, but  both places have been dead to bookish fame this hundred years.  There  are now no booksellers' shops in the Poultry, though Moorfields just  saves itself, for it rejoices in the presence of a music publisher and a  stationer. Speaking generally, the second-hand book trade has been  driven bodily out of the central and eastern parts of London, and has  settled itself in the streets west of Temple Bar and Holborn Viaduct,  always avoiding the Strand, which, for some reason or other, has ever  been regarded as an inhospitable quarter.  There are certainly  booksellers' shops in this important thoroughfare, three, I believe, is  the precise number, but they are hardly sufficient to invest it with the  dignity and title of a 'locality.'    In contrast to this, Holborn and the streets adjoining have always been  a good hunting-ground, and are so to-day.  'The Vision of Piers Plowman'  was printed and sold in Ely Rents so long ago as 1550, and Snow Hill and  Gray's Inn Gate were both world-wide localities, though the glory of all  these places has since departed.  Up to within five years ago there was  a shop on the right-hand side of Gray's Inn Lane, just out of Holborn,  given up chiefly to the sale of newspapers.  It is shut up now, and,  according to all accounts, will never be opened again, which is a pity,  for it is a shop, or more probably the curtailment of much larger  premises, with a notable history.  Here, in 1750 or thereabouts, carried  on business one Thomas Osborne, who, although ignorant to a degree,  brutal in his manners, and surly beyond description, managed to build up  the largest business of its kind in London, or, indeed, anywhere else.  Customers ignored Tom Osborne's curses, and bought his books when they  could, for sometimes, when particularly morose, he would shut himself  up, like a hermit, 'with his lumber,' as a historian of the day termed  the thirty whole libraries which he had amassed, and refuse to treat at  all.  Nevertheless, Osborne prospered exceedingly, and in the latter  years of his life was the owner of a country house and 'dog and duck  shootings,' all purchased and kept up from the profits derived from this  shop in Gray's Inn Lane.  The prices he asked were the most he thought  he had the remotest chance of getting, and were often outrageous and  extortionate, though at other times very much below what he might have  obtained had he known his business properly.  He seems to have taken a  bird's-eye view of his stock, and to have appraised the value of  individual books, not by reference to their rarity, but by means of a  fractional calculation based upon the total cost--a rough-and-ready  method of trading which attracted book-buyers from every part of London,  and reconciled them to his insolence.  Though Osborne was not the first  dealer to issue a catalogue--one T. Green, of Spring Gardens, being  credited with having revived, in 1729, this time-worn method of selling  books--he carried on a more extensive business in this way than anyone  who had preceded him, and in addition had the supreme honour of being  knocked down by Dr. Johnson with a huge folio which the latter wanted to  buy, and he (Osborne) refused to sell at any price.  Either of these  claims to distinction would have made the fortune of any man.  It is  stated by Sir John Hawkins that the book which Dr. Johnson wielded with  such effect was the 'Biblia Greeca Septuaginta,' printed at Frankfort in  1594.  The identical volume was in the possession of Thorpe, a Cambridge  bookseller, in 1812, but what has become of it since I do not know.    Though Osborne's shop, or what remains of it, is now closed, the  neighbourhood is still as largely interested in the sale of books as  ever, or perhaps even more so, for there has been an immigration from  other quarters of London which improvements have converted into  uncongenial ground.    The new Law Courts and their approaches stand upon the sites of  Butchers' Row, Shire Lane, where Elias Ashmole lived, and countless  courts and alleys beside.  Clare Market has vanished within the last two  or three years, and Clement's Inn, with its narrow passages and dingy  chambers, has been entirely rebuilt.  Even Drury Lane, sacred to the  memory of an army of general dealers who, up to within a comparatively  short time ago, bought books by weight, is now past praying for to all  appearances, for hardly a book of any kind is to be met with from one  end of this grimy thoroughfare to the other.  Let us walk into Bozier's  Court, which is further to the west, and we miss the shop which Lord  Lytton has immortalized in 'My Novel'; in fact, the court itself is  plastered all over with advertisement posters, and awaits the wreckers,  for it is doomed. King William Street, Strand, was a booksellers' resort  for a century and more, but the fraternity are leaving one by one, and  only a very few are to be met there now.  Westminster Hall, for  centuries a virtual library, is shut up, and echoes spring from its  stones when any casual stranger, armed with an order, is allowed to  ramble through Rufus's deserted pile.  In fact, wherever we stray,  north, south, east, or west, we are forced to the conclusion that London  has changed so utterly within the last twenty or thirty years that it is  to all intents and purposes a different place.    And the booksellers appear to have changed, too, for there are no  'characters' among them, or, at any rate, very few.  Every now and then  you will meet with some strange mortal, who looks as though he had been  transported bodily from the last century and tumbled unceremoniously  into a brand new shop, with coloured glass above the portal, and fresh  paint about the front; but you have hardly time to ruminate on the  mutability of things under the sun and he is gone, to make way, perhaps,  for a dealer in something superlatively new.  An antiquary of the stamp  of Francis Grose, the 'chiel' who went about taking notes, would stand  aghast, then hasten to depart, could he but see the London of to-day.    It must not, however, be supposed that book-hunting as a pastime is  extinct in modern Babylon. On the contrary, there are yet plenty of  nooks and corners, and pestilential-looking alleys, that Death and the  jerry-builder have apparently forgotten, and these places, we may be  certain, harbour many folios.  As a fact, I know they do; for in my  time, and to some extent even yet, I have been and am a wanderer about  such places, and have, on occasion, picked up many interesting mementos  there.  What I merely wish to insist upon is that the older and  recognised localities, which our fathers would naturally have visited a  couple of decades or more ago in their search for old books, are not  those which would, as a rule, afford much scope for enterprise now.  We  must go further afield, and not expect to find a mass of stalls huddled  together in a single street, as though one locality had tapped and  drained the life-blood of the rest.  Circumstances have changed, and at  the close of the nineteenth century booksellers have, to a great extent,  ceased to be gregarious, except in Holywell Street, or, as it is more  generally called, 'Booksellers' Row,' once the abode of literary hacks  and bailiff-haunted debtors, which even yet has an old-world look with  its overhanging houses and narrow roadway.  Here there certainly is a  long double procession of bookshops, many open to the street, every one  of them crammed from floor to ceiling with great piles of lore.    And Holywell Street, be it said, is such historic and classic ground,  that it is threatened every day by the improver, who longs to lay its  north side open to the Strand, and will, we may be sure, effect his  purpose in the end.  It was here that Lord Macaulay used to take his  walks abroad in search of books.  As a rule he began and ended there;  for a whole day's pilgrimage would not suffice to unearth more than a  fractional part of the immense store of volumes that the labour of years "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46303"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 6 (of 8) (#12)"],[1,"of time  they hoped to make unchallengeable.    On the 10th General Buller's force, marching over the wide veldt, reached  the junction of Gans Vlei, some ten miles north, while General Hildyard's  crossed the pass and concentrated on Klip River, situated some fifteen  miles due west of Laing's Nek, and in face of some rugged country on the  way to Volksrust. The Dutchmen were there congregating, and preparing in  the Almond's Nek region to intercept the passage. The South African Light  Horse, before the arrival of the main column, had captured a useful  kopje, and they, and some squadrons of the Irregulars, made a dashing  attack on the mass of Dutchmen who were barring the main road. A most  animated engagement was fought, which cost the South African Light Horse  six killed and eight wounded. The enemy after the encounter slowly  retired, harassed by the 2nd Cavalry Brigade. The main column,  frost-bitten and weary, bivouacked in the shadow of the captured kopje,  the 11th Brigade immediately below, and further down, the 10th Brigade,  while still lower down came the 2nd Brigade, commanded now by General  Hamilton in place of General Hildyard, who, as we know, was raised to  divisional rank.    On the 11th the advance was continued in the direction of Volksrust, and  General Hildyard (Fifth Division) made a brilliant frontal attack against  the Boers, who were now holding a formidable position with several guns  at the east of Almond's Nek, which place stands about seven miles north  of Gans Vlei. After the artillery had been pounding a dangerous hoop of  ridges for a considerable time, filling the whole atmosphere with  reverberating roars, the 10th Brigade, the Dorsets in the firing line,  the Middlesex in support, advanced on the right of the ridge beyond which  were the Mounted Infantry, while the 2nd Brigade, the East Surreys and  Queen's leading, treading the open, made a bold dash for the foe. These,  concealed among the steep boulders, proceeded to pour a thunderous and  fiery welcome on all who approached. The stertorous rampage continued for  hours. But, fortunately, in their fastnesses our big guns--two 4.7-in.  monsters and six little \"handy\" 12-pounders--eventually searched them  out, and subsequently a gallant charge--one of the most brilliant in the  campaign--the charge of the Dorsets who, in a blizzard of lead, swarmed  upon the position with fixed bayonets, decided the fortunes of the day.  The superb manner in which those seasoned warriors launched themselves at  miles and miles of entrenched positions--a veritable phalanx of church  steeples--was beyond praise. Their great assault cost the valiant  regiment ten killed and forty wounded. Some Boer prisoners were taken,  and five or six Dutchmen bit the dust. But most of them had bolted before  the gleam of the bayonets, and in their flight had set fire to the grass  so as to render pursuit impossible. Simultaneously with the charge of the  Dorsets, the 2nd Brigade was doing identical work, and doing it  splendidly. They succeeded in capturing the whole of the position, in  clearing the enemy entirely off the scene, and in rendering the  formidable galleries of doom, the rows of trenches on Laing's Nek, \"full  of emptiness.\" The Irregulars under Colonel Gough, brave as ever and cool  as cucumbers, had been also vigorously engaged on the right, so  vigorously, so dauntlessly that two officers, Captain Mann  (Thorneycroft's Mounted Infantry), and Captain O'Brien (Composite  Regiment) were mortally wounded. But, losses apart, the day's work was in  every way effective, as the Boers by evacuating Laing's Nek left open the  Volksrust Road, and virtually ceased from defacing British soil.    Thus in two marches Sir Redvers Buller had succeeded in effectively  sweeping Northern Natal, a feat of which his army was very justly proud.  There was no doubt that the Chief had now made himself master both of the  tactics of the enemy and the peculiarities of the country over which he  had to travel. He had bought his experience in a hard school, but in this  march he applied it brilliantly, and exacted from all the applause that  was his due. Through broken country and steep he had made a flank march  of fifty miles with an immense force and tremendous transport, clearing  the way before him with the loss of about 30 killed and 150 wounded. His  strategy had been ingenious as masterly, for while he made a  demonstration on their left and kept the Boers in expectation of attack  in that quarter, he had wheeled his force to their right, and surprised  them before they had time to gather themselves together sufficiently to  frustrate the tactics of the advancing force.    [Illustration: REPAIRING LAING'S NEK TUNNEL BLOWN UP BY THE BOERS.  (Drawing by J. J. Waugh, from a photo by Captain P. U. Vigors.)]    The triumphant issue of the movement was a source of intense satisfaction  to all concerned in it. The Natal Field Force had hitherto scarcely been  fortunate, and there were many among its members who were inclined to  envy those who, to use a popular word, had \"processed\" up the Free State  figuratively to the tune of \"See the Conquering Hero comes.\" The Natal  Force had had a prodigious number of kicks, and knew what hard fighting  meant, and had felt sore to find themselves, so to speak, \"on the  unfashionable side.\" It became a question with these much battered  warriors whether the kicks would be productive of halfpence, and whether,  when honours were ladled out, those who so richly deserved it would come  in for a bare spoonful. The splendid \"little battle that did a big  thing\"--that, on the 11th of June, left Almond's Nek purged of Boers and  enabled General Clery and his Division to occupy Laing's Nek--settled all  misgivings. Sir Redvers Buller's flanking movement was full not only of  political but sentimental importance, for the reconquest of Majuba and  Laing's Nek meant the sponging out of humiliating memories which had  grown more painful with the passage of years.    In these operations the total casualties amounted to 153.    On the 7th Second Lieutenant Andrews, 6th Company Western Division Royal  Garrison Artillery, was severely injured on the head, and on the  following day Second Lieutenant E. F. Grant-Dalton, 2nd West Yorkshire  Regiment, was wounded.    On the 11th, the casualties among officers were: Lieutenant Stafford,  East Surrey Regiment, severely wounded; Captain Mansel, Second Lieutenant  Herbert, 2nd Dorsets, slightly wounded; Lieut.-Colonel Mills, Lieutenant  Seppings, 1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers, slightly wounded; Lieutenant  Johnstone, 11th Hussars, killed; Captain Northey, 2nd Cameronians,  slightly wounded; Captain O'Brien mortally wounded (since dead).      GENERAL BULLER'S ADVANCE FROM LAING'S NEK TO STANDERTON    The next stage in the proceedings was begun on the 20th, when Sir Redvers  Buller moved to Paarde Kop, and from thence proceeded to Standerton, when  he opened up communications with Lord Roberts. On the 15th of the month  Lord Roberts, telegraphing to the War Office, said, \"Buller, I hope, is  at Standerton.\" But this was not the case, the Natal Force being delayed  at Laing's Nek for various reasons connected with transport and the  rearrangement and recuperation of the troops and the repair of the  Laing's Nek tunnel. Doubtless the inability of the General to proceed,  had considerable effect upon the main war programme, and many imagine  that if the force had been able to occupy Standerton, which lies directly  between Machadodorp, where President Kruger had fled, and Reitz, where  President Steyn had located himself, concerted action between the two  Presidents might have been nipped in the bud. As it was, the Dutchmen  continued to use the telegraph till the 22nd of June, when Sir Redvers  Buller's troops threw a formidable barrier between them, and spoilt the  hatching of further elaborate plots for the continuance of organised  warfare. Meanwhile, General Hildyard occupied Wakkerstroom, but marched  thence to join General Buller on the 19th.    [Illustration: A HISTORIC BATTLEFIELD: JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1881, AND MAY  1900    From a Sketch by Major-General Coke, Commanding the 10th Brigade]    On the 20th General Buller's headquarters arrived at Sandspruit Station  beyond Volksrust, and pitched camp two miles further on, to west of the  rail. Many surrenders took place, and some blowing up of culverts by  those who were retreating in disgust at the defeat at Almond's Nek, a  defeat which they considered the worst disaster to their arms that had  yet occurred. The Natal Volunteers were now about to be disbanded, and  left for Dundee. They were highly praised by all, and the Chief issued an  order expressing his keen appreciation of the services rendered by  Brigadier-General Dartnell and his stalwart followers in the arduous  task which has resulted in the expulsion of the enemy from Natal  territory. General Lyttelton now moved from Coetzes Drift to Laing's Nek  to protect the line from Newcastle to Volksrust, while General Coke's  Brigade mounted guard over the latter place.    The next day, the 21st, the advance column reached Paardekop, situated  some thirty miles from their destination. Standerton was neared by Lord  Dundonald's mounted force on the 22nd, while the infantry followed some  eight miles behind, the 10th Brigade only being left at Paardekop. As  Major Gough and a squadron of the Composite Regiment entered Standerton a  party of Boers made off, leaving the place to be occupied without  resistance. The railway bridge was found to be injured, as also were some  engine trucks and engines. The Hollander railway officials, for whose  idle hands the devil had invented this mischief, were imprisoned.    [Illustration: RAILWAY MAP SHOWING LINES FROM PRETORIA TO E. AND S.E.
