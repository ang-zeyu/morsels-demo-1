Of course that doesn't do unless children are HEALTHY:  I quite allow THAT.  Well, the doctor tells me no children are  healthy unless they've got a good colour in their cheeks.  And only  just look at my darlings!  Why, their cheeks bloom like peonies!  Well, now, they tell me that, to keep children in health, you  should never give them more than six hours altogether at lessons  in the day, and at least two half-holidays in the week.  And that's  EXACTLY our plan I can assure you!  We never go beyond six hours,  and every Wednesday and Saturday, as ever is, not one syllable of  lessons do they do after their one o'clock dinner!

In the first place, owing to ``the discovery of the unexpected  relation amongst the various forces of nature, which had  previously been thought to be independent,'' we must lay stress on  this positive deduction, that we cannot find an adequate reason  either for a single crime or for the aggregate criminality of a  nation if we do not take into account each and all of the  different natural factors, which we may isolate in the exigencies  of our studies, but which always act together in an indissoluble  union.    No crime, whoever commits it, and in whatever circumstances, can  be explained except as the outcome of individual free-will, or as  the natural effect of natural causes.  Since the former of these  explanations has no scientific value, it is impossible to give a  scientific explanation of a crime (or indeed of any <p 55>other  action of man or brute) unless it is considered as the product of  a particular organic and psychical constitution, acting in a  particular physical and social environment.    Therefore it is far from being exact to assert that the positive  criminal school reduces crime to a purely and exclusively  anthropological phenomenon.  As a matter of fact, this school has  always from the beginning maintained that crime is the effect of  anthropological, physical, and social conditions, which evolve it  by their simultaneous and inseparable operation.  And if inquiries  into biological conditions have been more abundant and more  conspicuous by their novelty, this in no way contradicts the  fundamental conclusion of criminal sociology.    That being stated, we have still to examine the relative value of  these three classes of conditions in the natural evolution of  crime.    It seems to me that this question is generally stated  inaccurately, and also that it cannot be answered absolutely, and  in a word.    It is generally stated inaccurately; because they who think, for  instance, that crime is nothing else than a purely and exclusively  social phenomenon in the evolution of which the organic and  psychical anomalies of the criminal have had no part, ignore more  or less consciously the universal correlation of natural forces,  and forget that, in regard to any phenomenon whatsoever, it is  impossible to set an absolute limit to the network of its causes,  immediate and remote, direct and indirect.    To put this question in an arbitrary sense would <p 56>be like  asking if a mammal is the product of its lungs, or its heart, or  its stomach, or of vegetable constituents, or of the atmosphere;  whereas each of these conditions, internal and external, is  necessary to the life of the animal.    In fact, if crime were the exclusive product of the social  environment, how could one explain the familiar fact that in the  same social environment, and in identical circumstances of  poverty, abandonment, lack of education, sixty per cent. do not  commit crimes, and, of the other forty, five prefer suicide, five  go mad, five simply become beggars or tramps not dangerous to  society, whilst the remaining twenty-five actually commit crimes?  And amongst the latter, whilst some go no further than theft  without violence, why do others commit theft with violence, and  even kill their victim outright, before he offers resistance, or  threatens them, or calls for help, and this with no other object  than gain?    The secondary differences of social condition, which may be  observed even amongst the members of a single family, rotting in  one of the slums of our great towns, or amongst those who are  surrounded by the temptations of money or power, or the like, are  clearly not enough in themselves to explain the vast differences  in the actions which grow out of them, varying from honesty under  the greatest discouragement to suicide and murder.    The question, therefore, must be asked in a relative sense  altogether, and we must inquire which of the three kinds of  natural causes of crime has a <p 57>greater or less influence in  determining each particular crime at any given moment in the  individual and social life.    No clear answer of general application can be given to this  question, for the relative influence of the anthropological,  physical, and social conditions varies with the psychological and  social characteristics of each offence against the law.    For instance, if we consider the three great classes of crimes  against the person, against property, and against personal purity,  it is evident that each class of determining causes, but  especially the biological and social conditions, have a distinctly  different influence in evolving homicide, theft, or indecent  assaults.  And so it is in every category of crimes.    The undeniable influence of social conditions, and still more of  economic conditions, in leading up to the commission of theft, is  far inferior in the genesis of homicides and indecent assaults.  And similarly, in each category of crimes, the influence of the  determining conditions varies greatly according to the special  forms of crime.    Certain casual homicides are plainly the result of social  conditions (gambling, drink, public opinion, &c.) in a much higher  degree than homicides which for the most part spring from  brutality, from the moral insensibility of individuals, or from  their psycho-pathological conditions, corresponding to abnormal  organic conditions.    In like manner, certain indecent assaults, incests, &c., are  largely the outcome of social environment, which, condemning a  number of persons to live in <p 58>hovels without air or light,  with a promiscuity of sex between parents and children such as  obtains amongst the brutes, effaces or deadens all normal sense of  modesty.  On the other hand, there are cases of rape and the like  which are mostly due to the biological condition of the  individual, either in manifest forms of sexual disease or, less  manifest though none the less actual, of biological anomaly.    For thefts, again, whilst occasional simple thefts are largely the  effect of social and economical conditions, this influence becomes  feebler in comparison with impulses due to the personal  constitution, organic and psychical, as, for instance, in the case  of thefts with violence, and especially of murder for the purpose  of robbery, which scoundrels of the ``swell-mob'' so frequently  commit in cold blood.    The same observation applies to the conditions of physical  environment.  For instance, if the regular increase of crimes  against property in winter (and, as I showed for the first time  from French statistics, in years when the cold is greatest) is  only an indirect result, through the social and economic  influences of temperature, the increase of crimes of passion and  indecent assaults during the months and years when the temperature  is highest is only a direct effect of temperature, even for such  as, by their biological conditions, offer the feeblest resistance  to these influences.    Meanwhile, a last objection has been raised against the  conclusions which I have maintained for many years past.    It has been said that, even if we admit that for <p 59>certain  crimes and criminals the greatest influence must be recognised as  due to the physical and psychical conditions of the individual,  extending from slightly manifested anomalies of an anthropological  character to the most accentuated pathological condition, this  does not exclude the possibility of a crime being due to social  conditions.  In fact, it is said the anomalies of the individual  are in their turn only an effect of a debasing social environment,  which condemns its victims to organic and psychical degeneration.    This objection is sound enough if it be taken in a relative sense,  but groundless if it be insisted on absolutely.    It must be considered, in the first place, that the distinctions  of cause and effect are only relative, for every effect has its  cause, and _vice vers<a^>_; so that if wretchedness, material and  moral, is a cause of degeneration, degeneration itself, like  biological anomaly, is a cause of wretchedness.  And in this sense  the question would be simply metaphysical, like the famous  Byzantine discussions as to whether there was originally an egg  before a hen or a hen before an egg.    And, in fact, when it was said, in regard to criminal geography,  that the extent and quality of crime in such and such a province,  instead of being the effect of biological conditions (race, &c.)  and physical conditions (climate, soil, &c.), were but the effect  of social and economic conditions (of rural and industrial  pursuits, and the like), I was able to make a very simple reply.  For, apart even from statistical proofs, if the <p 60>social  conditions of such and such a province, which have an  unquestionable influence, are really the absolute and exclusive  cause of crime, we may still ask whether these social conditions  of the province are not themselves the effect of the ethnical  qualities of energy, intelligence, and so forth, in its  inhabitants, and of the more or less favourable conditions of the  climate and the soil.    But it may also be observed, more precisely, that even apart from  strongly marked and conspicuous pathological conditions, which  meanwhile assert themselves amongst the biological factors of  crime, there is a very great number of these cases in which it  cannot actually be said that the bio-psychical anomalies of the  criminal are the effect of a physically and morally poisonous  environment.    In every family in which there are several children, we find (in  spite of identical surroundings and conditions of a favourable  kind, and suitable methods of training and education), individuals  who differ intellectually from the"]]]
