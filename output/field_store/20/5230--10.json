In the wars Of Frederick the Great, one  tenth of the population was killed. Even the great Battle of  the Nations at Leipsic in 1813 did not free Germany from wars,  and in 1866 Prussia and the smaller North German States, with  Italy, defeated Austria, assisted by Bavaria, Hesse-Cassel,  Hesse-Darmstadt, Nassau, Saxony, Baden, Württemberg and Hanover.    I am convinced that the fear of war induced by a hereditary instinct,  caused the mass of the Germans to become the tools and dupes of  those who played upon this very fear in order to create a military  autocracy. On the other hand, and, especially, in the noble class,  we have in Germany a great number of people who believe in war for  its own sake. In part, these nobles are the descendants of the  Teutonic Knights who conquered the Slav population of Prussia,  and have ever since bound that population to their will.    The Prussian army was created by the father of Frederick the  Great, who went to the most ridiculous extremes in obtaining tall  men at all costs for his force.    The father of Frederick the Great gave the following written  instructions to the two tutors of his son. \"Above all let both  tutors exert themselves to the utmost to inspire him with a love  of soldiery and carefully impress upon his mind that, as nothing  can confer honour and fame upon a prince except the sword, the  monarch who seeks not his sole satisfaction in it must ever appear  a contemptible character in the eyes of the world.\"    Frederick the Great left, by the death of that father who had  once threatened to execute him, at the head of a marvellous army  with a full treasury, finally decided upon war, as he admits in  his own letters, \"in order to be talked about,\" and his desire  to be talked about led to the Seven Years' War.    The short war against Denmark in 1864, against Austria, Bavaria,  etc., in 1866 and against France in 1870, enormously increased  both the pride and prestige of the Prussian army. It must not  be forgotten that at all periods of history it seems as if some  blind instinct had driven the inhabitants of the inhospitable  plains of North Germany to war and to conquest. The Cimbri and  Teutones--the tribes defeated by Marius; Ariovistus, who was  defeated by Julius Caesar; the Goths and the Visi-Goths; the  Franks and the Saxons; all have poured forth from this infertile  country, for the conquest of other lands. The Germans of to-day  express this longing of the North Germans for pleasanter climes  in the phrase in which they demand \"a place in the sun.\"    The nobles of Prussia are always for war. The business men and  manufacturers and shipowners desire an increasing field for their  activities. The German colonies were uninhabitable by Europeans.  All his life the glittering Emperor and his generals had planned  and thought of war; and the Crown Prince, surrounded by his  remarkable collection of relics and reminders of Napoleon, dreamed  only of taking the lead in a successful war of conquest. Early in  the winter of 1913-14, the Crown Prince showed his collection of  Napoleana to a beautiful American woman of my acquaintance, and  said that he hoped war would occur while his father was alive,  but, if not, he would start a war the moment he came to the throne.    Since writing the above, the American woman who had this conversation  with the Crown Prince wrote out for me the exact conversation  in her own words, as follows: \"I had given him Norman Angell's  book, 'The Great Illusion,' which seeks to prove that war is  unprofitable. He (the Crown Prince) said that whether war was  profitable or not, when he came to the throne there would be war,  if not before, just for the fun of it. On a previous occasion  he had said that the plan was to attack and conquer France, then  England, and after that my country (the United States of America);  Russia was also to be conquered, and Germany would be master of  the world.\"    The extraordinary collection of relics, statues, busts, souvenirs,  etc., of the first Napoleon, collected by the Crown Prince, which  he was showing at the time of the first of these conversations  to this American lady, shows the trend of his mind and that all  his admiration is centred upon Napoleon, the man who sought the  mastery of the world, and who is thought by admirers like the  Crown Prince to have failed only because of slight mistakes which  they feel, in his place, they would not have made.    If the Germans' long preparations for war were to bear any fruit,  countless facts pointed to the summer of 1914 as the time when the  army should strike that great and sudden blow at the liberties  of the world.    It was in June, 1914, that the improved Kiel Canal was reopened,  enabling the greatest warships to pass from the Baltic to the  North Sea.    In the Zeppelins the Germans had arms not possessed by any other  country and with which they undoubtedly believed that they could  do much more damage to England than was the case after the actual  outbreak of hostilities. They had paid great attention to the  development of the submarine. Their aeroplanes were superior to  those of other nations. They believed that in the use of poison  gas, which was prepared before the outbreak of the war, they had  a prize that would absolutely demoralise their enemy. They had  their flame throwers and the heavy artillery and howitzers which  reduced the redoubtable forts of Liege and Namur to fragments  within a few hours, and which made the holding of any fortresses  impossible.    On their side, by the imposition of a heavy tax called the  _Wehrbeitrag_ or supplementary defence tax, they had, in  1913, increased their army by a number of army corps. On the  other hand, the law for three years' military service voted in  France had not yet gone into effect, nor had the law for universal  military service voted by the Belgian Chambers. Undoubtedly the  Germans based great hopes upon the Bagdad railway which was to  carry their influence to the East, and even threatened the rule  of England in Egypt and India. Undoubtedly there was talk, too,  of a Slav railroad to run from the Danube to the Adriatic which  would cut off Germany from access to the Southern Sea. Francis  Deloisi, the Frenchman, in his book published before the great  war, called \"De la Guerre des Balkans à la Guerre Européenne,\"  says, \"In a word, the present war (Balkan) is the work of Russia,  and the Danube Asiatic railway is a Russian project. If it succeeds,  a continuous barrier of Slav peoples will bar the way to the  Mediterranean of the path of Austro-German expansion from the  Black Sea to the Adriatic. But here again the Romanoffs confront  the Hapsburgs, the Austro-Serb conflict becomes the Austro-Russian  conflict, two great groups are formed, and the Balkan conflict  becomes the European conflict.\"    Another reason for an immediate war was the loan by France to  Russia made on condition that additional strategic railways were  to be constructed by the Russians in Poland. Although this money  had been received, the railways had not been constructed at the  time of the opening of the Great War. Speaking of this situation,  the Russian General Kuropatkin, in his report for the year 1900,  said, \"We must cherish no illusions as to the possibility of an  easy victory over the Austrian army,\" and he then went on to say,  \"Austria had eight railways to transport troops to the Russian  frontier while Russia had only four; and, while Germany had seventeen  such railways running to the German-Russian frontier, the Russians  had only five.\" Kuropatkin further said, \"The differences are too  enormous and leave our neighbours a superiority which cannot be  overcome by the numbers of our troops, or their courage.\"    Comparing the two armies, he said, \"The invasion of Russia by  German troops is more probable than the invasion of Germany by  Russian troops\"; and, \"Our Western frontier, in the event of  a European war, would be in such danger as it never has known  in all the history of Russia.\"    Agitation by workmen in Russia was believed in Germany to be  the beginning of a revolution. Illuminating figures may be seen  in the gold purchase of the German Imperial Bank: in 1911,  174,000,000 marks; in 1912, 173,000,000 marks; but in 1913,  317,000,000 marks.    There was a belief in Germany that the French nation was degenerate  and corrupt and unprepared for war. This belief became conviction  when, in the debates of the French Senate, Senator Humbert, early  in 1914, publicly exposed what he claimed to be the weakness  and unpreparedness of France.    Prince Lichnowsky, the German Ambassador in London, certainly  reported to his government that England did not wish to enter  the war. He claims now that he did not mean that England would  not fight at all events, but undoubtedly the German Foreign Office  believed that England would remain out of the war. The raising of  the Ulster army by Sir Edward Carson, one of the most gigantic  political bluffs in all history, which had no more revolutionary  or military significance than a torchlight parade during one of  our presidential campaigns, was reported by the German spies  as a real and serious revolutionary movement; and, of course, it  was believed by the Germans that Ireland would rise in general  rebellion the moment that war was declared. In the summer of  1914 Russia was believed to be on the edge of revolution.    As I have said in a previous chapter, the movement against  militarism, culminating in the extraordinary vote in the Reichstag  against the government at the time of the Zabern Affair, warned  the government and military people that the mass of Germans were  coming to their senses and were preparing to shake off the bogy of  militarism and fear, which had roosted so long on their shoulders  like a Prussian old-man-of-the-sea.

Vestiges are still found of a breach which  was made by the Spaniards for the purpose of draining the lake. The  temple of the sun at Sogamozo being pretty near the northern coasts of  Terra Firma, the notions of the gilded man were soon applied to a  high-priest of the sect of Bochica, or Indacanzas, who every morning,  before he performed his sacrifice, caused powder of gold to be stuck  upon his hands and face, after they had been smeared with grease.  Other accounts, preserved in a letter of Oviedo addressed to the  celebrated cardinal Bembo, say that Gonzalo Pizarro, when he  discovered the province of cinnamon-trees, \"sought at the same time a  great prince, noised in those countries, who was always covered with  powdered gold, so that from head to foot he resembled an image of gold  fashioned by the hand of a skilful workman (a una figura d'oro  lavorato di mano d'un buonissimo orefice). The powdered gold is fixed  to the body by means of an odoriferous resin; but, as this kind of  garment would be uneasy to him while he slept, the prince washes  himself every evening, and is gilded anew in the morning, which proves  that the empire of El Dorado is infinitely rich in mines.\" It seems  probable that there was something in the ceremonies of the worship  introduced by Bochica which gave rise to a tradition so generally  spread. The strangest customs are found in the New World. In Mexico  the sacrificers painted their bodies and wore a kind of cape, with  hanging sleeves of tanned human skin.    On the banks of the Caura, and in other wild parts of Guiana, where  painting the body is used instead of tattooing, the nations anoint  themselves with turtle-fat, and stick spangles of mica with a metallic  lustre, white as silver and red as copper, on their skin, so that at a  distance they seem to wear laced clothes. The fable of the gilded man  is, perhaps, founded on a similar custom; and, as there were two  sovereign princes in New Granada, the lama of Iraca and the secular  chief or zaque of Tunja, we cannot be surprised that the same ceremony  was attributed sometimes to the prince and sometimes to the  high-priest. It is more extraordinary that, as early as the year 1535,  the country of El Dorado was sought for on the east of the Andes.  Robertson is mistaken in admitting that Orellana received the first  notions of it (1540) on the banks of the Amazon. The history of Fray  Piedro Simon, founded on the memoirs of Queseda, the conqueror of  Cundirumarca, proves directly the contrary; and Gonzalo Diaz de  Pineda, as early as 1536, sought for the gilded man beyond the plains  of the province of Quixos. The ambassador of Bogota, whom Daza met  with in the kingdom of Quito, had spoken of a country situate toward  the east. Was this because the table-land of New Granada is not on the  north, but on the north-east of Quito? We may venture to say that the  tradition of a naked man covered with powdered gold must have belonged  originally to a hot region, and not to the cold table-lands of  Cundirumarca, where I often saw the thermometer sink below four or  five degrees; however, on account of the extraordinary configuration  of the country, the climate differs greatly at Guatavita, Tunja,  Iraca, and on the banks of the Sogamozo. Sometimes, also, religious  ceremonies are preserved which took rise in another zone; and the  Muyscas, according to ancient traditions, made Bochica, their first  legislator and the founder of their worship, arrive from the plains  situate to the east of the Cordilleras. I shall not decide whether  these traditions expressed an historical fact, or merely indicated, as  we have already observed in another place, that the first Lama, who  was the offspring and symbol of the sun, must necessarily have come  from the countries of the East. Be it as it may, it is not less  certain that the celebrity which the expeditions of Ordaz, Herrera,  and Speier had already given to the Orinoco, the Meta, and the  province of Papamene, situate between the sources of the Guaviare and  Caqueta, contributed to fix the fable of El Dorado near to the eastern  back of the Cordilleras.    The junction of three bodies of troops on the table-land of New  Granada spread through all that part of America occupied by the  Spaniards the news of an immensely rich and populous country which  remained to be conquered. Sebastian de Belalcazar marched from Quito  by way of Popayan (1536) to Bogota; Nicholas Federmann, coming from  Venezuela, arrived from the east by the plains of Meta. These two  captains found, already settled on the table-land of Cundirumarca, the  famous Adelantado Gonzalo Ximenez de Queseda, one of whose descendants  I saw near Zipaquira, with bare feet, attending cattle. The fortuitous  meeting of the three conquistadores, one of the most extraordinary and  dramatic events of the history of the conquest, took place in 1538.  Belalcazar's narratives inflamed the imagination of warriors eager for  adventurous enterprises; and the notions communicated to Luis Daza by  the Indian of Tacunga were compared with the confused ideas which  Ordaz had collected on the Meta respecting the treasures of a great  king with one eye (Indio tuerto), and a people clothed, who rode upon  llamas. An old soldier, Pedro de Limpias, who had accompanied  Federmann to the table-land of Bogota, carried the first news of El  Dorado to Coro, where the remembrance of the expedition of Speier  (1535 to 1537) to the Rio Papamene was still fresh. It was from this  same town of Coro that Felipe von Huten (Urre, Utre) undertook his  celebrated voyage to the province of the Omaguas, while Pizarro,  Orellana, and Hernan Perez de Quesada, brother of the Adelantado,  sought for the gold country at the Rio Napo, along the river of the  Amazons, and on the eastern chain of the Andes of New Grenada. The  natives, in order to get rid of their troublesome guests, continually  described Dorado as easy to be reached, and situate at no considerable  distance. It was like a phantom that seemed to flee before the  Spaniards, and to call on them unceasingly. It is in the nature of  man, wandering on the earth, to figure to himself happiness beyond the  region which he knows. El Dorado, similar to Atlas and the islands of  the Hesperides, disappeared by degrees from the domain of geography,  and entered that of mythological fictions.    I shall not here relate the numerous enterprises which were undertaken  for the conquest of this imaginary country. Unquestionably we are  indebted to them in great part for our knowledge of the interior of  America; they have been useful to geography, as errors and daring  hypotheses are often to the search of truth: but in the discussion on  which we are employed, it is incumbent on me to rest only upon those  facts which have had the most direct influence on the construction of  ancient and modern maps. Hernan Perez de Quesada, after the departure  of his brother the Adelantado for Europe, sought anew (1539) but this  time in the mountainous land north-east of Bogota, the temple of the  sun (Casa del Sol), of which Geronimo de Ortal had heard spoken in  1536 on the banks of the Meta. The worship of the sun introduced by  Bochica, and the celebrity of the sanctuary of Iraca, or Sogamozo,  gave rise to those confused reports of temples and idols of massy  gold; but on the mountains as in the plains, the traveller believed  himself to be always at a distance from them, because the reality  never corresponded with the chimerical dreams of the imagination.  Francisco de Orellana, after having vainly sought El Dorado with  Pizarro in the Provincia de los Canelos, and on the auriferous banks  of the Napo, went down (1540) the great river of the Amazon. He found  there, between the mouths of the Javari and the Rio de la Trinidad  (Yupura?) a province rich in gold, called Machiparo (Muchifaro), in  the vicinity of that of the Aomaguas, or Omaguas. These notions  contributed to carry El Dorado toward the south-east, for the names  Omaguas (Om-aguas, Aguas), Dit-Aguas, and Papamene, designated the  same country--that which Jorge de Espira had discovered in his  expedition to the Caqueta. The Omaguas, the Manaos or Manoas, and the  Guaypes (Uaupes or Guayupes) live in the plains on the north of the  Amazon. They are three powerful nations, the latter of which,  stretching toward the west along the banks of the Guape or Uaupe, had  been already mentioned in the voyages of Quesada and Huten. These two  conquistadores, alike celebrated in the history of America, reached by  different roads the llanos of San Juan, then called Valle de Nuestra  Senora. Hernan Perez de Quesada (1541) passed the Cordilleras of  Cundirumarca, probably between the Paramos of Chingasa and Suma Paz;  while Felipe de Huten, accompanied by Pedro de Limpias (the same who  had carried to Venezuela the first news of Dorado from the land of  Bogota), directed his course from north to south, by the road which  Speier had taken to the eastern side of the mountains. Huten left  Coro, the principal seat of the German factory or company of Welser,  when Henry Remboldt was its director. After having traversed (1541)  the plains of Casanare, the Meta, and the Caguan, he arrived at the  banks of the Upper Guaviare (Guayuare), a river which was long  believed to be the source of the Orinoco, and the mouth of which I saw  in passing by San Fernando de Atabapo to the Rio Negro. Not far from  the right bank of the Guaviare, Huten entered Macatoa, the city of the  Guapes. The people there were clothed, the fields appeared well  cultivated; everything denoted a degree of civilization unknown in the  hot region of America which extends to the east of the Cordilleras.  Speier, in his expedition to the Rio Caqueta and the province of  Papamene, had probably crossed the Guaviare far above Macatoa, before  the junction of the two branches of"]]]
