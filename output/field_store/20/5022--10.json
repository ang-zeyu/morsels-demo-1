Our Lady of the Bitterness, toward whom  leaned the tender look of St. John, was robed in superb brocade, so  precious that her train, which stood stiffly out behind, was guarded  by a soldier with drawn sword.    This closed the ceremonies of Palm Sunday, and the throng, catching  one from another the blithe, sweet Andalusian melodies, went singing  softly through the darkness on their various ways.    After Palm Sunday a secular quiet fell upon Seville, not broken until  Wednesday. At five o'clock this March afternoon it was still so hot  that few people were rash enough to move about without the shelter of  parasols. Sevillian priests, sombre-robed as they were, sauntered  cheerily across the _plaza_ under sunshades of the gayest hues,  orange, green, azure, red, and usually all at once, but the shamefaced  Englishmen flapped up broad umbrellas of an uncompromising black.  There was a breezy flutter of fans on the grand stand, the  water-sellers had to fill their jars again and again, and the  multitude of smokers, puffing at their paper cigarettes to cool  themselves, really brought on a premature twilight.    It was nearly seven before a score of gendarmes, marching abreast,  cleared the way for the procession. Then appeared, in the usual guise,  some twenty feet apart, two files of those strange shapes, with high,  peaked caps, whose visors descended to the breast, slowly advancing,  with an interval of about six feet from man to man. Their caps and  frocks were black, but the long capes glowed a vivid red. They carried  the customary lighted tapers, so tall that, when rested on the ground,  they reach to the shoulder. Midway between the files walked a  cross-bearer, followed by a Nazarene, who uplifted the standard of  St. Andrew's Cross in red on a black ground. Bearers of other insignia  of the order preceded the great litter, on which, under a golden palm  tree, was represented by life-size effigies the arrest of Christ among  His Disciples, St. Andrew having the foremost place. The second  pageant presented by this brotherhood was accompanied by bevies of  white-robed boys swinging censers and chanting anthems. Then came, in  effulgence of light, the Most Holy Virgin, escorted, as if she were  the earthly Queen of Spain, by a detachment of the Civil Guard, whose  white trimmings and gold belts gleamed in the candle rays.    The remaining three _cofradias_ that had part in the Wednesday  ceremonies exhibited but one pageant each. A troop in black and gold  conducted a Calvary, with Mary Mother and Mary Magdalene both kneeling  at the foot of the cross, robed in the richest velvet. Figures in  white, with stripes of red, came after, with a yet more costly  Calvary. The well-carved crucifix rose from a gilded mound, and Our  Mother of Healing wore a gold crown of exceeding price. But the third  Calvary, all wrought in black and gold, the colors of the brotherhood,  which were repeated in standard and costume, won the plaudits of the  evening. Here Longinus, the Roman centurion, mounted on a spirited  horse, was in the act of piercing with his lance the Saviour's side.  Amid _vivas_ and _bravos_ this Passion picture passed, like its  predecessors, in clouds of incense and peals of solemn music.    On Thursday the wearing of black was almost universal. We rummaged our  shawl straps for some poor equivalent of the Spanish black silks and  black mantillas. The Civil Guard was more superb than ever in  full-dress uniform, with red vests and white trousers. No sound of  wheels was suffered within the city limits, and late arrivals had to  commit their luggage to a porter and follow him on foot.    At three o'clock, in the Sagrario of the cathedral, the archbishop  washed the feet of thirteen old paupers, who sat in two confronting  rows, looking neat as wax and happy as honey, each dressed in a  brand-new suit, with a long-fringed damask towel over his shoulder.  Their old blood had been warmed by the archbishop's own wine, for they  had just come from luncheon in the ecclesiastical palace, where they  had been served by the highest dignitaries of the church and the  proudest nobles of the city. The function of foot washing was not  taken too seriously. The fat canons smiled good-humoredly on their  archbishop, as his group of attendants lowered him to his knees and  lifted him again before every old man in turn, and the acolytes nudged  one another with boyish mirth over the rheumatic, embarrassed efforts  of the beneficiaries to put on their stockings.    A Franciscan friar mounted the pulpit, however, and turned the  congregation, thickly sprinkled with English visitors, serious enough  by a succinct and fiery sermon, saying, in a nutshell, that love is  the glory of the religious life, but is the fruit only of Catholicism,  for nowhere, though one searches the world over, can there be found a  work of mercy--hospital, asylum, endowed school, charity of any sort  or kind--due to Protestantism. And the old paupers, glancing down at  their new suits and feeling the glow of their banquet, were glad to  the tips of their purified toes that their lots had been cast in  Catholic Spain.    By six o'clock the squares and streets along the processional route  were thronged again, although our Spanish friends assured us that the  numbers were less than usual. The war feeling kept the Americans and,  to some extent, the English away, while many of the Spanish of the  provinces, who were accustomed to take their annual outing in Seville  during the _Semana Santa_, were held at home this year by poverty or  mourning.    The first two pageants of the afternoon, those of the bull-fighters  and the cigarette-makers, were awaited with especial eagerness. For  these Seville brotherhoods, more than thirty in all, still maintain  something of the mediaeval structure of the guilds. Just as in England  and France, from the eleventh to the fifteenth century, or  thereabouts, organized companies of craftsmen used to present in  Passion Week successive scenes from the life of Christ, these Spanish  _cofradias_ to-day maintain such general lines of division in  performing a similar function. Yet any Catholic Sevillian may, if he  chooses, secure admission to any of these societies, irrespective of  his occupation. The young _caballero_ who chanced to be our prime  source of information this Thursday afternoon was himself of a  prominent family, a protege of the archbishop, and a student of law,  yet he belonged to the brotherhood of Fruit Venders, although his  devotion seemed a little languid, and he had excused himself on this  occasion from the long march in the breathless Nazarene garb.    Not all the brothers feel bound to perform this penitential service  every Passion Week, and, indeed, not all the brotherhoods. Several of  the most elaborate pageants were missing from the ranks this year.  Such omissions are not as disastrous to the processional effect as  they would have been in England, for example, some six centuries ago.  Then the gilded and tapestried platforms, set on wheels, which the  processions conducted through the streets, were really stages, and at  the halting places the best actors of each guild played upon its  particular platform an appointed scene from the sacred drama. The  sequence of events was duly observed, and the spectator, standing in  market-place or at street corner, while one theatre after another  rolled by him, saw acted out with much finery of wardrobe and  ingenuity of machinery, with tragic dialogue and declamation, relieved  by comic interludes, all the Bible story, from the revolt of Lucifer  to the Day of Judgment. But modern Spain, abandoning the acting and  recitation and substituting puppets for living men, has let slip the  dramatic sequence, so that a few pageants less means only so much  abatement in the general splendor of the spectacle.    The bull-fighters of Andalusia are eminently religious and are said,  likewise, to be remarkable for their domestic virtues. All their manly  fury is launched against the bull, and they have only gentleness left  for wives and children. I have heard no better argument for the bull  ring. At all events, these _toreros_, marching soberly in black, with  yellow belts, escorted with well-ordered solemnity an image of the  crucified Christ, followed by a queenly effigy of Our Lady of Refuge,  erect behind terraced ranks of candles on a flower-strewn litter,  under a costly canopy of black velvet embroidered with gold. The  cigarette-makers came after with their two pageants, Christ fastened  to the pillar, and Our Lady of Victory.    It was, as usual, the second upon which the main expense had been  lavished. A great company of acolytes, richly clad and swinging  censers of pure silver, went in advance of the Virgin, and three bands  of music followed her with continuous acclaim, while a regiment of  soldiers attended as a guard of honor. Immediately in front of the  _paso_ went, surrounded by officers and aides, General Ochando, his  head uncovered and his breast glittering with decorations, for the  young king of Spain is a member of this _cofradia_, and had sent the  distinguished military governor of the Provinces, who has a palace in  Seville, to represent him. Especial enthusiasm was called out by this  image of Mary, for the cigarette-makers had just presented her with a  new mantle at a cost of nine thousand dollars. The brothers were  willingly aided by the seven thousand women who work in the immense  tobacco factory, the average contribution of each donor being two  _centimos_ (two-fifths of a cent) a week during the preceding year. No  wonder that the Virgin seemed to stand proudly upon her silvered  pedestal, her gorgeous new mantle streaming out until it almost  touched the head of a white-vested girl who walked barefoot close  behind the litter, so fulfilling a vow made in extremity of illness.    Black and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#12)"],[1," joyful puppy with a sort of sorrowing  friendliness. He seemed to realize that Wolf, too, was lonely and that  the little dog was helpless.    Tired of biting an unprotesting ear, Wolf dived for Lad's white  forelegs, gnawing happily at them with a playfully unconscious  throwback to his wolf ancestors who sought thus to disable an enemy by  breaking the foreleg bone. For all seemingly aimless puppy-play had  its origin in some ancestral custom.    Lad bore this new bother unflinchingly. Presently Wolf left off the  sport. Lad crossed to the veranda and lay down. The puppy trotted over  to him and stood for a moment with ears cocked and head on one side as  if planning a new attack on his supine victim; then with a little  satisfied whimper, he curled up close against his father's shaggy side  and went to sleep.    Lad gazed down at the slumberer in some perplexity. He seemed even  inclined to resent the familiarity of being used for a pillow. Then,  noting that the fur on the top of the puppy's sleepy head was rumpled,  Lad bent over and began softly to lick back the tousled hair into  shape with his curving tongue--his raspberry-pink tongue with the  single queer blue-black blot midway on its surface. The puppy mumbled  drowsily in his sleep and nestled more snugly to his new protector.    And thus Lad assumed formal guardianship of his obstreperous little  son. It was a guardianship more staunch by far than Lady's had  been of late. For animal mothers early wear out their zealously  self-sacrificing love for their young. By the time the latter are able  to shift for themselves, the maternal care ceases. And, later on, the  once-inseparable relationship drops completely out of mind.    Paternity, among dogs, is, from the very first, no tie at all. Lad,  probably, had no idea of his relationship to his new ward. His  adoption of Wolf was due solely to his own love for Lady and to the  big heart and soul that stirred him into pity for anything helpless.    Lad took his new duties very seriously indeed. He not only accepted  the annoyance of Wolf's undivided teasing, but he assumed charge of  the puppy's education as well--this to the amusement of everyone on  The Place. But everyone's amusement was kept from Lad. The sensitive  dog would rather have been whipped than laughed at. So both the  Mistress and Master watched the educational process with outwardly  straight faces.    A puppy needs an unbelievable amount of educating. It is a task to  wear threadbare the teacher's patience and to do all kinds of things  to the temper. Small wonder that many humans lose patience and temper  during the process and idiotically resort to the whip, to the boot-toe  and to bellowing--in which case the puppy is never decently educated,  but emerges from the process with a cowed and broken spirit or with an  incurable streak of meanness that renders him worthless.    Time, patience, firmness, wisdom, temper-control, gentleness--these be  the six absolute essentials for training a puppy. Happy the human who  is blessed with any three of these qualities. Lad, being only a dog,  was abundantly possessed of all six. And he had need of them.    To begin with, Wolf had a joyous yearning to tear up or bury every  portable thing that could be buried or torn. He had a craze for  destruction. A dropped lace handkerchief, a cushion left on the  grass, a book or a hat lying on a veranda-chair--these and a thousand  other things he looked on as treasure-trove, to be destroyed as  quickly and as delightedly as possible.    He also enjoyed taking a flying leap onto the face or body of any  hammock-sleeper. He would howl long and lamentably, nearly every  night, at the moon. If the night were moonless, he howled on general  principles. He thrilled with bliss at a chance to harry and terrify  the chickens or peacocks or pigeons or any others of The Place's  Little People that were safe prey for him. He tried this form of  bullying once--only once--on the Mistress' temperamental gray cat,  Peter Grimm. For the rest of the day Wolf nursed a scratched nose and  a torn ear--which, for nearly a week, taught him to give all cats a  wide berth; or, at most, to bark harrowingly at them from a safe  distance.    Again, Wolf had an insatiable craving to find out for himself whether  or not everything on earth was good to eat. Kipling writes of puppies'  experiments in trying to eat soap and blacking. Wolf added to this  limited fare a hundred articles, from clothespins to cigars. The  climax came when he found on the veranda-table a two-pound box of  chocolates, from which the wrapping-paper and gilt cord had not yet  been removed. Wolf ate not only all the candy, but the entire box and  the paper and the string--after which he was tumultuously and horribly  ill.    The foregoing were but a small percentage of his gay sins. And on  respectable, middle-aged Lad fell the burden of making him into a  decent canine citizen. Lad himself had been one of those rare puppies  to whom the Law is taught with bewildering ease. A single command or  prohibition had ever been enough to fix a rule in his almost uncannily  human brain. Perhaps if the two little brown pups had lived, one or  both of them might have taken after their sire in character. But Wolf  was the true son of temperamental, wilful Lady, and Lad had his job  cut out for him in educating the puppy.    It was a slow, tedious process. Lad went at it, as he went at  everything--with a gallant dash, behind which was an endless supply of  resource and endurance. Once, for instance, Wolf leaped barkingly upon  a filmy square of handkerchief that had just fallen from the Mistress'  belt. Before the destructive little teeth could rip the fine cambric  into rags, the puppy found himself, to his amazement, lifted gently  from earth by the scruff of his neck and held thus, in midair, until  he dropped the handkerchief.    Lad then deposited him on the grass--whereupon Wolf pounced once more  upon the handkerchief, only to be lifted a second time, painlessly but  terrifyingly, above earth. After this was repeated five times, a gleam  of sense entered the puppy's fluff-brain, and he trotted sulkily away,  leaving the handkerchief untouched.    Again, when he made a wild rush at the friendly covey of peacock  chicks, he found he had hurled himself against an object as immobile  as a stone wall. Lad had darted in between the pup and the chicks,  opposing his own big body to the charge. Wolf was bowled clean over  by the force of the impact, and lay for a minute on his back, the  breath knocked clean out of his bruised body.    It was a longer but easier task to teach him at whom to bark and at  whom not to bark. By a sharp growl or a menacing curl of the lips, Lad  silenced the youngster's clamorous salvo when a guest or tradesman  entered The Place, whether on foot or in a car. By his own thunderously  menacing bark he incited Wolf to a like outburst when some peddler  or tramp sought to slouch down the drive toward the house.    The full tale of Wolf's education would require many profitless pages  in the telling. At times the Mistress and the Master, watching from  the sidelines, would wonder at Lad's persistency and would despair of  his success. Yet bit by bit--and in a surprisingly short time for so  vast an undertaking--Wolf's character was rounded into form. True, he  had the ever-goading spirits of a true puppy. And these spirits  sometimes led him to smash even such sections of the law as he fully  understood. But he was a thoroughbred, and the son of clever  parents. So he learned, on the whole, with gratifying speed--far more  quickly than he could have been taught by the wisest human.    Nor was his education a matter of constant drudgery. Lad varied it by  taking the puppy for long runs in the December woods and relaxed to  the extent of romping laboriously with him at times.    Wolf grew to love his sire as he had never loved Lady. For the  discipline and the firm kindliness of Lad were having their effect on  his heart as well as on his manners. They struck a far deeper note  within him than ever had Lady's alternating affection and crossness.    In truth, Wolf seemed to have forgotten Lady. But Lad had not. Every  morning, the moment he was released from the house, Lad would trot  over to Lady's empty kennel to see if by any chance she had come back  to him during the night. There was eager hope in his big dark eyes as  he hurried over to the vacant kennel. There was dejection in every  line of his body as he turned away from his hopeless quest.    Late gray autumn had emerged overnight into white early winter. The  ground of The Place lay blanketed in snow. The lake at the foot of the  lawn was frozen solid from shore to shore. The trees crouched away  from the whirling north wind as if in shame at their own black  nakedness. Nature, like the birds, had flown south, leaving the  northern world as dead and as empty and as cheerless as a deserted  bird's-nest.    The puppy reveled in the snow. He would roll in it and bite it,  barking all the while in an ecstasy of excitement. His gold-and-white  coat was thicker and shaggier now, to ward off the stinging cold. And  the snow and the roaring winds were his playfellows rather than his  foes.    Most of all, the hard-frozen lake fascinated him. Earlier, when Lad  had taught him to swim, Wolf had at first shrunk back from the chilly  black water. Now, to his astonishment, he could run on that water as  easily--if somewhat sprawlingly--as on land. It was a miracle he never  tired of testing. He spent half his time on the ice, despite an  occasional hard tumble or involuntary slide.    Once and once only--in all her six-week absence and in his own  six-week loneliness--had Lad discovered anything to remind him of his  lost mate; and that discovery caused him for the first time in his  blameless life to break the most sacred of The Place's simple  Laws--"]]]
