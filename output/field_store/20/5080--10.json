Since we have known her, Inez has been under the observation of  several skilled medical specialists.  She all along has been in  good general physical condition.  Having been treated previously  for diabetes, special examinations were repeatedly made, but  never a trace of this trouble was discernible.  Her own story of  having had tuberculosis, and the traces of blood in the sputum,  which she presented on handkerchiefs, etc., led to repeated tests  for tuberculosis.  These also proved absolutely negative.  Before  all this, there was found on the left side of the abdomen a mass  which, from the history the girl gave, was surmised to be a  tubercular abscess.  At this time she was running a little  temperature.  An operation was performed and an encysted hairpin  was removed from the peritoneal cavity.  This had undoubtedly  found entrance through the old appendicitis wound; the hairpin  had evidently been straightened for the purpose.  Both wounds now  speedily closed.  Gynecological examination showed no disease and  established the fact of virginity.  Thorough neurological  examination showed that the girl was not of nervous type and that  there was no evidence whatever of organic disease.  There was  complaint of frequent headaches, but no signs of acute suffering  from these were ever witnessed and by this time no reports of  subjective symptoms could be credited.  No sensory defects of any  importance.  It was always easy to get a little variation upon  visual tests and the like, however.  Weight 130; height 5 ft. 1  in.  Color good.  Head notably well shaped with broad high  forehead.  Strength good.  Very normal development in all ways.    Most important to note as bearing on her social career was the  fact that Inez was possessed of markedly strong, regular,  pleasant features, including a good set of teeth well cared for,  and an unusually firm chin.  In attitude and expression she  seemed to give complete proof of great strength of will and  character.  Her face suggested both frankness and firmness.  When  with quiet force and dignity asserting her desire for education  and a place in the world, Inez presented a most convincing  picture.  Perhaps even more significant is the fact that Inez  possesses a speaking voice of power and charm, well modulated and  of general qualities which could belong apparently to no other  than a highly cultivated person.    During a year there has been no variation in the general  well-being of Inez, although she has been taken to hospitals in  at least two more towns and has figured again as a sufferer from  tuberculosis and appendicitis, and has written several times to  friends that she was about to be operated on.    The diagnoses of several competent medical men are that the girl  is a simulator or is an hysterical, and their findings show that  she has lied tremendously about her past.  (There were never any  positive signs of hysteria, and our own opinion is that the case  is much better called one of extreme simulation and  misrepresentation, as in the diabetes and sputum affairs, etc.,  and of self-mutilation, as with the hairpin.)    We have had ample opportunity to become acquainted with Inez's  mental qualities.  She has repeatedly been given tests for mental  ability.  As judged by the average of those seen in our court  work we are forced to regard her as having ability clearly above  the normal.  Her perceptions are keen and quick.  She works  planfully and rapidly with our concrete problems and shows good  powers of mental representation.  It is notable that she is very  keen to do her best on tests and takes much delight in a good  record.  Her psychomotor control is astonishingly good.  In a  certain tapping test, which we consider well done if the  individual has succeeded in tapping in 90 squares in 30 seconds,  she did 117 and 129 at two successive trials with only one error  in each.  This is next to the best record we have ever seen.  Our  puzzle box, which is seldom opened in less than 2 minutes, she  planfully attacked and conquered in 52 seconds.  She also rapidly  put it together again, which is an unusual performance.  Reaction  times on the antonym test, giving the opposites to words, were  very low; average 1.4 seconds.  Her immediate memory for words  was normal, but nothing extraordinary.  She gave correctly,  although not quite in logical order, 18 out of 20 items on a  passage which she read herself.  On a passage read four times to  her she gave 11 out of 12 items in correct sequence.  The  Kent-Rosanoff association test showed, to our surprise, nothing  peculiar.  Notwithstanding her known social characteristics,  there were very few egocentric or subjective reactions.    Nor did the ``Aussage'' test show great peculiarity.  On free  recital she gave 17 items, two of which were incorrect.  They  were misinterpretations rather than inventions, however.  On  questioning she added 15 items.  She was incorrect on 5 more  details, but all of these were denials of objects actually to be  seen in the picture.  Not one was a fictitious addition.  She  rejected all the 6 suggestions proffered.    Our psychological observations were important beyond the giving  of formal tests.  We found her to be a fluent and remarkably  logical and coherent conversationalist.  Her choice of words was  unusually good.  Questioned about this she said she had always  made it a point to cultivate a vocabulary and was particularly  fond of the use of correct English.  (This was all the more  interesting because we later knew that she had been living  recently with somewhat illiterate people and that her original  home offered her very little in the way of educational  advantages.)  Inez told us that she had earlier carried her  desire for self-expression in language to the point of writing  stories and plays, but we were never able to get her to do  anything of the kind for us.  One of her constant pleas was that  she might get the chance to become a well-trained teacher of  English.  Her letters never showed the same skill with English  that her conversation denoted, but her meagre education probably  accounted for this.    Characteristic of Inez, also, is her intense egoism and her  abundant self-assertion under all circumstances.  It often seemed  to us as if for her the world revolved, with passing show, around  a pivot from which she regarded it as existing only for what it  meant for her career.  These qualities have led to her  statements, and perhaps to the actual feelings, that she was the  aggrieved one, and had been badly treated on many occasions.  This seemed to reach almost paranoidal heights at times, and yet,  before passing judgment on this, one should be in position to  know, what probably will never be known, namely, the actual facts  of her earliest treatment.  Occasionally Inez showed most  unreasonable bad temper and obstinacy.  This only came out when  she was asked to do things which she considered occupationally  beneath her.  In general she felt herself much above the ordinary  run of people.  When she could be patronizing, as with children,  she acted quite the grand lady.  Indeed, in asserting herself on  numerous occasions she has assumed just this attitude, which is  all the more strange because our further information shows that  it was not justified by any social station which her family ever  held.    Going further with psychological considerations it is to be  asserted that Inez showed marked lack of normal apperceptive  ability in not appreciating the necessarily unfavorable results  of her own lying.  For that matter, she also fails to learn by  experience, for very frequently she has suffered from her own  prevarications.  It might, however, be argued that to Inez the  thought of a possible hum-drum future in which there was no  adventure, no roving, and no playing the part of a successful  personality, was a worse choice than that of lying, which might  and, indeed, often did serve the purpose of making friends with  people, who otherwise would not have entertained her.  So one  could hardly judge her deficient even in this particular.  (Of  the character of her lying and the special observations on that  point more later.)    We found Inez, then, neither mentally defective nor insane.  To  even say that she was without moral sense would be beyond the  mark, for in many ways she showed great appreciation of the best  types of behavior.  Her peculiarities verging on the abnormal  are, however, undoubted; they render her a socially pernicious  person.  They are to be summed up in terms of what we have  discussed above, namely, her excessive egoism, her faulty  judgment or apperceptions, her astounding tendency to  falsification.    Inez was next heard from in Iowa where she wrote that two doctors  had pronounced upon her case and said an operation was again  imperative.  She asked her recently made friend for permission to  have this done, and also for $150 to cover expenses.  Neither, of  course, was forthcoming, on the grounds of there being no  guardianship.  (Her age was then unknown.)  Inez wrote, ``I just  thought I was compelled by law to let you know of my whereabouts,  for I understood I could do nothing without your consent.''  In  the same letter, replete with other lies, Inez asks, ``Please  forgive me now for all my willfulness and wrongdoing.  I will do  my best never to do it again, and Oh!  I do so want to be good so  that you may feel proud of me some day in the near future.''    A month or so later this friend was called up by the director of  a religious home for girls in Chicago, who stated that Inez had  just come to them and had been taken seriously ill.  Advice was  given to discount her symptoms, but she was sent once more to a  hospital. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44941"],[0,"The Government of God (#12)"],[1," to your mind his xxxvii. Psalm, where he  repeatedly declares that the meek shall inherit the earth for ever,  after the wicked are cut off from the face thereof. And last of all, to  set the matter for ever at rest, the voice of the Saviour would mildly  fall upon your ear in his Sermon on the Mount, declaring emphatically,  'Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.' To these  things you would answer, I have read these passages, to be sure; but  was always taught to believe that they did not mean so, therefore I  never understood them until now. Let me go and tell the people what  wonders have opened to my view, since my arrival in heaven, merely  from having heard one short song. It is true, I have heard much of the  glories of heaven described, while on earth, but never once thought of  their rejoicing in anticipation of returning to the earth. Says the  Saviour, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; if they will not believe  them, neither would they believe, although one should rise from the  dead.'\"[A]    [Footnote A: Pp. 48-50. Seventh Edition; Liverpool: F. D. Richards.  This is an excellent work, and well worthy of any one's perusal.--J. T.]        Chapter VI.  ------------------    Man's Accountability to God.    This is a subject which it may be necessary for us to inquire into, in  order that we may find out how far man is responsible. For if man be  not a moral agent, he cannot be responsible for the present position of  the world; and it would be unjust in God to punish him for acts that  were not his, and for circumstances over which he had no control.    By a careful examination of the Scriptures, we shall find that man has  had certain powers vested in his hands, which he holds subject to the  control and guidance of the Lord; and that if he has acted without  the counsel, guidance, or instruction of God, he has gone beyond the  limits assigned him by the Lord, and is as much culpable as a minister  plenipotentiary of any nation would be who should exceed the limits of  his instructions; or a man holding a farm, or vineyard, by a certain  lease, if he should disregard the conditions of that lease, and destroy  the farm, or vineyard; for the earth is the Lord's, and man was put  on it by the Lord. It is not man's possession, only as he holds it  from God. Man's body was given him by God, and also his spirit, for  the purpose heretofore mentioned. God had his object in view in the  creation of the world and of man (which it is not necessary here to  investigate); and if man is placed as an agent to act for the Lord, and  also for himself, and then should neglect the Lord, he would certainly  be held responsible to his Creator. That God had an object in view in  regard to the creation of the world, is evident. Or, why was there a  consultation in heaven about it? Why the beautiful regulation of sun,  moon, and stars? Why the provision made for the redemption of man  before he came here? For Christ was \"the Lamb slain from before the  foundation of the world.\" Why the arrangement of the resurrection?  the New Jerusalem, and the reign of Jesus on the earth? Will any one  say that all these things were done, and all nature organized in its  present beauty, and order, without a design? It would be preposterous.  If God has a design in those things, and man by his wilfulness,  wickedness, corruption, and rebellion, should thwart the design of God,  and yield himself to another influence, even that of Satan, will he not  be held responsible? And whether God has a particular design or not,  does not affect the question particularly; for the earth is the Lord's,  and man also, and God has a perfect right to dictate what laws he  pleases. That the Lord looks upon the world in this manner is evident  from the words of our Saviour. \"There was a certain householder which  planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a wine-press  in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into  a far country. And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his  servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.  And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another,  and stoned another. Again, he sent other servants more than the first;  and they did unto them likewise. But last of all he sent unto them his  son, saying, They will reverence my son. But when the husbandmen saw  the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us  kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. And they caught him, and  cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. When the Lord, therefore,  of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? They say  unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out  his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits  in their seasons. Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the  Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become  the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous  in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be  taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits  thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken; but  on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\" Matt. xxi.  33-44. Here, then, the thing is clearly developd: man's agency; the  abuse of that agency; the punishment inflicted for that abuse, together  with the awful consequences of resistance to the proper authority. \"On  whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.\" God never  gave man unlimited control of the affairs of this world; but always  speaks of man as being under his guidance, inhabiting his territory,  and responsible to him for his acts. The world is His vineyard, and  man is the agent. Hence, when God made man, \"God blessed him, and God  said unto him, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and  subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the  fowl of the air, and every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\"  This, then, was man's dominion, _given him by the Lord_. And the word  continues: \"_And God gave them_ every herb bearing seed, and every tree  in which is the fruit of a tree.\" These things were given by God; but  to show his power, and his right to be obeyed, and in order to test  man, he forbid his eating of a certain tree; and when he did eat of it,  and thus broke the commandment of God, he thrust him out of the garden,  and decreed that he \"should eat his bread by the sweat of his brow.\"    Again, God demanded worship and sacrifices, and when Cain and Abel  offered them, he received one and rejected the other; and further, when  Cain was wroth on account of his sacrifice not being accepted, the Lord  said to him, \"Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?  If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not  well, sin lieth at the door.\" Gen. iv. 5-7. After the destruction of  the world, which was in consequence of the people sinning against God,  he blessed Noah, and spake to him, and gave him the same dominion  which had been given before to Adam; and Noah offered sacrifices to  him. The same recognition of the Almighty's power and authority was  manifested by Abraham, Moses, the Children of Israel, and the Prophets;  by Jesus also, and the primitive Christians. Man was left as a free  agent with power to act, and vested with certain powers by his Father,  and responsible to him for his acts, as a son, servant, or agent  would be to his father, master, or employer. Perhaps it would be more  correctly conveyed thus:--a man lets or rents a vineyard or farm, the  man occupying it has a certain agency and discretionary power vested  in his hands, but always subject to certain conditions imposed by the  owner of the property. Hence God made a covenant with Noah, Abraham,  the Children of Israel, and the primitive saints. The making of a  covenant naturally implies two parties: in such cases, God is one,  the people the other. If the people fulfil their covenant, the Lord  is bound to fulfil his; but if man transgresses then the Lord is not  bound to fulfil his engagement. For instance, in speaking to ancient  Israel, he said, \"And it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken  diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all  the commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God  will set thee on high above all nations of the earth.\" Deut. xxviii.  1. He then describes what those blessings are; and further states,  that if they do not observe his statutes they shall be cursed. The  Lord set before them blessings and cursings; blessings if they obeyed,  but cursings if they disobeyed. Man, then, acts as a moral agent, to  improve upon the blessings which God puts within his power, or not, as  he pleases; and it is the abuse of this moral agency, which has filled  the world with misery and distress.[A]    [Footnote A: This part of the subject is fully explained in the remarks  on the Government of Man, chap. ii.]    Man has lost sight of the object of his creation, and his future  destiny; and losing sight of his origin, his relationship to God,  and his future destiny, he has fallen into the mazes of ignorance,  superstition, and iniquity, and is groping in the dark, and knows  not how to conduct himself in this world, or how to prepare for the  world to come. For, instead of being governed by the Spirit, Wisdom,  and Revelations of God, he is governed by the spirit of the Evil One,  \"the god of this world, who rules in the hearts of the children of  disobedience.\" They have left God, and submitted themselves to his evil  sway, and used that agency which God has given to them, not only in  rejecting God, but in obeying Satan; and furthering his designs, which  are in opposition to those of God, the happiness of mankind, and the  salvation of the"]]]
