If  he did, he didn't tell us about it.          CHAPTER 5    BOOKS, FOLKLORE, MEDICINE AND DREAMS    As I said earlier, I got along okay in school.  But throughout  school I was a slow reader.  And this reading slowness has  plagued me all my life.  It even caused me quite a bit of trouble  in college.  As a small boy, when Santa Claus brought me a book,  I was a little disappointed.  I'd much rather have gotten some  kind of a toy, especially one with wheels that would roll.    We kids learned early in life how to do things, purely a matter  of survival.  But learning the \"why\" of things often came through  reading and I was the slowest of readers.  Even in high school I  read very slowly, but I got what I read tolerably thorough.    I never read my history more than one time and I made \"A\"  throughout the course.  The same was true with stories and other  readings.  In college I only read my history once.  And I didn't  even review for the final test and came out with a \"C.\"    There were a few books on the shelves in our house when I was a  boy.  Some had pictures, so I looked at them.  Some didn't have,  so I didn't look at them.  And I certainly didn't read them.    There were two books which stood out in our home, always  available and close at hand.  They were the Bible and the Sears,  Roebuck Catalog.  There were times when these two rivaled each  other in importance.  Yet they were both necessary, the Bible for  living and dying and the catalog for \"What ye shall put on.\"  And  then the catalog, after a new one took its place each year,  became the forerunner of what we now know as bathroom tissue.    Each autumn after the first bale or two of cotton had been sold,  Papa and Mama would get the catalog down and make up an order  that would fill a wooden box half the size of a coffin.  Then we  would wait two or three weeks for the shipment to come from  Dallas.  Finally a postcard would come from the railroad depot in  Hamlin stating that the shipment had arrived.  The next time Papa  was in town in his wagon, he would go by and pick it up.    That night after supper we would all gather around for the grand  opening.  There was something in the box for one and all.    There was a pair of work shoes for each, and that pair would have  to last until the fall of next year.  Last year's would do to  wear to school awhile yet.  The new ones would do to wear for  Sundays until they began to look worn, then we could wear them to  school.  And they would last a long time if we would pull them  off as soon as we got in from school in the afternoons, and wear  our old ones for doing chores.  We could still wear our school  shoes for Sunday by shining them up a bit.  And of course, come  March the weather would be warm enough to go barefooted most of  the time.    There was underwear in the box, winter-weight that is.  We didn't  wear any in summer--just overalls and a shirt, that's all--well,  sometimes a straw hat.  And naturally we wore a cap in winter,  with ear flaps.  Each of us would get two suits of the underwear,  unless some of the smaller kids could wear some hand-me-downs,  and unless the hand-me-downs had already been handed down too  many times and were too far gone.    The winter caps came in the big box too, and two pairs of pants  for each boy, caps and pants all corduroy.  Needless to say, the  pants were the knee length kind, known as knickers, gathered with  elastic above the knees.  There were long pants for boys in their  late teens, and those came down to their shoe tops.  There were  socks too.  Socks were short and worn only by men and the big  boys with long pants.  Most of us boys got stockings which met  the knickers above the knees.  They were held up by garters of  black elastic.  The elastic also came in the box--yards of it.  And the garters were made to individual sizes by our mother whose  hands were never idle.  There might have been shirts in the big  box, though I think Mama made most all our shirts.    The corduroy knickers stood out full above the knees due to the  gathering by the elastic.  That caused the legs of the breeches  to rub together when we walked, and that rubbing caused a  swishing noise each time we took a step.  As we walked to school,  most of the boys went step, step, stepping along, but we Johnsons  went swish, swish, swishing along.  And everyone could hear that  we were wearing our new corduroy breeches.    There were things for the girls in the shipment too, and for  Mama.  But I didn't know what they got, except maybe a bundle of  cloth or two or three, to be made into dresses.  I suppose they  also made what they wore under the dresses.  But that was top  secret as far as we boys were concerned.  However, that didn't  bother me.  I was by women's clothing about like I was by Santa  Claus--not very inquisitive.  My field of research didn't include  girls' clothing.    As I grew older, of course, my attitude changed.  I became  somewhat interested in broadening my knowledge of girls and their  surroundings.  And so, with a feeling of guilt, and in strictest  privacy, I turned to the women's section of the Sear, Roebuck  Catalog for research and knowledge of the innermost secrets about  women's wear.    Now, in that big box from Sears, Roebuck there would be blue  denim for homemade overalls.  There would be pots and pans for  the kitchen, and gingham and calico and elastic and needles and  thread.  And there'd be a side or two of black harness leather  for making new lines and new traces and for repairing the old  ones.  Papa also used the same leather for shoe soles and heels.    There'd be shoe tacks and harness thread; bolts, nuts, and copper  rivets; leather lace for saddles, beeswax, welding flux and axle  grease; ropes for handling cows and horses, carpenter tools and  horse shoes.    And one year, for Frank and Susie, there was a phonograph and  some records.  Only I think the phonograph came in a separate  shipment later in the fall--perhaps for Christmas.    One of the favorite records for us smaller kids was \"The Preacher  and the Bear.\"  After awhile those of us who couldn't read could  pick out that record easily because all the letters were worn off  the label.  Even people who could read couldn't read that one  because there was no reading on it.  We little kids had worn it  all off with our fingers making it go round and round.    In those days research and technology had not advanced to the  point where they could make a spring that wouldn't break.  Watch  springs broke in those days.  Cultivator seat springs broke.  Screen door springs broke.  And when automobiles came along,  their springs broke.    This phonograph had a wind-up spring, so it broke too.  That's  when we kids started putting our fingers on the label part of the  record and turning it ourselves.  Fingers got as good reception  as a spring, so we soon wore the label off playing our favorite  record    Sorry I wandered.  Let's get back to the big box.  In the box I  remember there was a big bolt of cotton-sack ducking.  We started  picking cotton in the fall with last year's old leftover sacks.  But now it was time for new sacks.  The old ones would make good  short sacks for the little kids.  The big new sacks would be for  those who picked the most cotton.    I didn't know it at the time but I learned later that the story  they used to tell us about Santa being overloaded on Christmas  Eve and couldn't bring all the toys was just not true.  The fact  was that Santa had ordered from Sears, Roebuck and they were out  of some of the items and would have to ship them later.  And by  the time those items arrived in Hamlin, Santa had to deliver them  a night or two later.    One year, in the big box, there was a set of shoe lasts and a  stand, for repairing all sizes of shoes.  I don't remember when  we got the set.  I think maybe it came to live with the family  before I did and it was as good as new after I was a grown man.  When Papa put new half soles on our shoes, he would punch holes  with an awl and we little kids always wanted to place the shoe  tacks in the holes.  Our helping didn't delay his work a great  deal--and he was always kind and patient with us as we labored  with him and got in his way.    Many of the items in the big box were surprising to us kids, but  a blue denim jacket was no surprise to Papa, because he was the  one who made out the order in the first place.  He also got  socks-  -a bundle of twelve pairs of gray Rockford work socks, also sock  supporters, suspenders, and sleeve holders.  Somewhere tucked  away among other relics of olden days, I think I still have a  pair of old sleeve holders.    You ask, \"What are sleeve holders?\"  Oh, I thought everybody knew  about sleeve holders.  In those days you didn't buy a shirt with  sleeves the length you wanted.  You just bought a shirt.  All the  sleeves were the same length--long enough for the longest arms.  Then you put on the little elastic holders and let them hold your  sleeves up to the desired length.  They were fancy little  miniature garters to wear over your shirt sleeves above the  elbows.    I have on my shelf a copy of the 1902 Sears, Roebuck Catalog and  I checked up to see if the socks I mentioned really were Rockford  Brand.  They were--and the price was 55 cents for one dozen  pairs.    In the big box there were also such items as safety pins, fruit  jar lids, Kodak film, Daisy fly poison, lamp wicks, and  sometimes, a few views for our stereo-scopes.    I'm sure there were other things in the big box.  I just can't  remember all that was in it.  One thing for sure, if we just had  to have it, it was in there.  If we didn't have to have it, we  didn't order it.    Now, a couple of nonessentials that were left off the order were  bicycle tires.  Papa knew that the old tires wouldn't hold air  and he knew they couldn't "]]]
