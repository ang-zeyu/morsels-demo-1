Because he wanted his wool to rival other things in quality, he  bought rams at Tarentum and sent 'em into his flocks with a slap on the  arse.  He had bees brought from Attica, so he could produce Attic honey  at home, and, as a side issue, so he could improve the native bees by  crossing with the Greek.  He even wrote to India for mushroom seed one  day, and he hasn't a single mule that wasn't sired by a wild ass.  Do you  see all those cushions?  Not a single one but what is stuffed with either  purple or scarlet wool!  He hasn't anything to worry about!  Look out how  you criticise those other fellow-freedmen-friends of his, they're all  well heeled.  See the fellow reclining at the bottom of the end couch?  He's worth his 800,000 any day, and he rose from nothing.  Only a short  while ago he had to carry faggots on his own back.  I don't know how true  it is, but they say that he snatched off an Incubo's hat and found a  treasure!  For my part, I don't envy any man anything that was given him  by a god.  He still carries the marks of his box on the ear, and he isn't  wishing himself any bad luck!  He posted this notice, only the other day:                         CAIUS POMPONIUS DIOGENES HAS                             PURCHASED A HOUSE                        THIS GARRET FOR RENT AFTER                            THE KALENDS OF JULY.    \"What do you think of the fellow in the freedman's place?  He has a good  front, too, hasn't he?  And he has a right to.  He saw his fortune  multiplied tenfold, but he lost heavily through speculation at the last.  I don't think he can call his very hair his own, and it is no fault of  his either, by Hercules, it isn't.  There's no better fellow anywhere; his  rascally freedmen cheated him out of everything.  You know very well how  it is; everybody's business is nobody's business, and once let business  affairs start to go wrong, your friends will stand from under!  Look at  the fix he's in, and think what a fine trade he had!  He used to be an  undertaker.  He dined like a king, boars roasted whole in their shaggy  Bides, bakers' pastries, birds, cooks and bakers!  More wine was spilled  under his table than another has in his wine cellar.  His life was like a  pipe dream, not like an ordinary mortal's.  When his affairs commenced to  go wrong, and he was afraid his creditors would guess that he was  bankrupt, he advertised an auction and this was his placard:                         JULIUS PROCULUS WILL SELL AT                          AUCTION HIS SUPERFLUOUS                                 FURNITURE\"          CHAPTER THE THIRTY-NINTH.    Trimalchio broke in upon this entertaining gossip, for the course had  been removed and the guests, happy with wine, had started a general  conversation: lying back upon his couch, \"You ought to make this wine go  down pleasantly,\" he said, \"the fish must have something to swim in.  But  I say, you didn't think I'd be satisfied with any such dinner as you saw  on the top of that tray?  'Is Ulysses no better known?'  Well, well, we  shouldn't forget our culture, even at dinner.  May the bones of my patron  rest in peace, he wanted me to become a man among men.  No one can show  me anything new, and that little tray has proved it.  This heaven where  the gods live, turns into as many different signs, and sometimes into the  Ram: therefore, whoever is born under that sign will own many flocks and  much wool, a hard head, a shameless brow, and a sharp horn.  A great many  school-teachers and rambunctious butters-in are born under that sign.\"  We applauded the wonderful penetration of our astrologer and he ran on,  \"Then the whole heaven turns into a bull-calf and the kickers and  herdsmen and those who see to it that their own bellies are full, come  into the world.  Teams of horses and oxen are born under the Twins, and  well-hung wenchers and those who bedung both sides of the wall.  I was  born under the Crab and therefore stand on many legs and own much  property on land and sea, for the crab is as much at home on one as he is  in the other.  For that reason, I put nothing on that sign for fear of  weighing down my own destiny.  Bulldozers and gluttons are born under the  Lion, and women and fugitives and chain-gangs are born under the Virgin.  Butchers and perfumers are born under the Balance, and all who think that  it is their business to straighten things out.  Poisoners and assassins  are born under the Scorpion.  Cross-eyed people who look at the  vegetables and sneak away with the bacon, are born under the Archer.  Horny-handed sons of toil are born under Capricorn.  Bartenders and  pumpkin-heads are born under the Water-Carrier.  Caterers and  rhetoricians are born under the Fishes: and so the world turns round,  just like a mill, and something bad always comes to the top, and men are  either being born or else they're dying.  As to the sod and the honeycomb  in the middle, for I never do anything without a reason, Mother Earth is  in the centre, round as an egg, and all that is good is found in her,  just like it is in a honeycomb.\"          CHAPTER THE FORTIETH.    \"Bravo!\"  we yelled, and, with hands uplifted to the ceiling, we swore  that such fellows as Hipparchus and Aratus were not to be compared with  him.  At length some slaves came in who spread upon the couches some  coverlets upon which were embroidered nets and hunters stalking their  game with boar-spears, and all the paraphernalia of the chase.  We knew  not what to look for next, until a hideous uproar commenced, just outside  the dining-room door, and some Spartan hounds commenced to run around the  table all of a sudden.  A tray followed them, upon which was served a  wild boar of immense size, wearing a liberty cap upon its head, and from  its tusks hung two little baskets of woven palm fibre, one of which  contained Syrian dates, the other, Theban.  Around it hung little  suckling pigs made from pastry, signifying that this was a brood-sow with  her pigs at suck.  It turned out that these were souvenirs intended to be  taken home.  When it came to carving the boar, our old friend Carver, who  had carved the capons, did not appear, but in his place a great bearded  giant, with bands around his legs, and wearing a short hunting cape in  which a design was woven.  Drawing his hunting-knife, he plunged it  fiercely into the boar's side, and some thrushes flew out of the gash.  fowlers, ready with their rods, caught them in a moment, as they  fluttered around the room and Trimalchio ordered one to each guest,  remarking, \"Notice what fine acorns this forest-bred boar fed on,\" and as  he spoke, some slaves removed the little baskets from the tusks and  divided the Syrian and Theban dates equally among the diners.          CHAPTER THE FORTY-FIRST.    Getting a moment to myself, in the meantime, I began to speculate as to  why the boar had come with a liberty cap upon his head.  After exhausting  my invention with a thousand foolish guesses, I made bold to put the  riddle which teased me to my old informant.  \"Why, sure,\" he replied,  \"even your slave could explain that; there's no riddle, everything's as  plain as day!  This boar made his first bow as the last course of  yesterday's dinner and was dismissed by the guests, so today he comes  back as a freedman!\"  I damned my stupidity and refrained from asking any  more questions for fear I might leave the impression that I had never  dined among decent people before.  While we were speaking, a handsome  boy, crowned with vine leaves and ivy, passed grapes around, in a little  basket, and impersonated Bacchus-happy, Bacchus-drunk, and  Bacchus-dreaming, reciting, in the meantime, his master's verses, in a  shrill voice.  Trimalchio turned to him and said, \"Dionisus, be thou  Liber,\" whereupon the boy immediately snatched the cap from the boar's  head, and put it upon his own.  At that Trimalchio added, \"You can't  deny that my father's middle name was Liber!\"  We applauded Trimalchio's  conceit heartily, and kissed the boy as he went around.  Trimalchio  retired to the close-stool, after this course, and we, having freedom of  action with the tyrant away, began to draw the other guests out.  After  calling for a bowl of wine, Dama spoke up, \"A day's nothing at all: it's  night before you can turn around, so you can't do better than to go  right to the dining-room from your bed.  It's been so cold that I can  hardly get warm in a bath, but a hot drink's as good as an overcoat:  I've had some long pegs, and between you and me, I'm a bit groggy; the  booze has gone to my head.\"          CHAPTER THE FORTY-SECOND.    Here Seleucus took up the tale.  \"I don't bathe every day,\" he confided,  \"a bath uses you up like a fuller: water's got teeth and your strength  wastes away a little every day; but when I've downed a pot of mead, I  tell the cold to suck my cock!  I couldn't bathe today anyway, because I  was at a funeral; dandy fellow, he was too, good old Chrysanthus slipped  his wind!  Why, only the other day he said good morning' to me, and I  almost think I'm talking to him now!  Gawd's truth, we're only blown-up  bladders strutting around, we're less than flies, for they have some good  in them, but we're only bubbles.  And supposing he had not kept to such a  low diet!  Why, not a drop of water or a crumb of bread so much as passed  his lips for five days; and yet he joined the majority!  Too many doctors  did away with him, or rather, his time had come, for a doctor's not good  for anything except for a consolation to your mind!  He was well carried  out, anyhow, in the very bed he slept in during his lifetime.  And he was  covered with a splendid pall: the mourning was tastefully managed; he had  freed some slaves; even"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],[0,"The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#12)"],[1,"invitations to wedding anniversaries,           congratulations may be extended.        CONVERSATION AT DINNERS. Aim at bright and general         conversation, avoiding all personalities and         any subject that all cannot join in. This         is largely determined by the character of the         company. The guests should accommodate         themselves to their surroundings.        COOKS-TIPS. It is customary for men who have         been guests at a house party when they         leave to remember the cook by sending her         a tip.        CORN ON THE COB is eaten with the fingers of one hand.         A good plan is to cut off the kernels and eat         them with the aid of a fork.        CORNER OF CARD TURNED DOWN. This is no longer         done by persons when calling and leaving         cards.        CORRESPONDENCE. How to address official and social         letters. See under title of person addressed         --as, ARCHBISHOP, etc.        COSTUME BALLS.--INVITATIONS. Invitations are similar         to invitations to balls, except that they have         in place of DANCING in the lower left-hand         corner. COSTUME OF THE XVIIIth CENTURY, BAL         MASQUE, OR BAL POUDRE.        COTILLIONS. Germans are less formal than balls.         Supper precedes the dancing. Those who         do not dance or enjoy it can leave before         that time.           The etiquette is the same as for balls.      DRESS. The regulation evening dress is worn.      HOSTESS. The rules governing a hostess when         giving a ball are the same for a cotillion,         with this addition--that there should be an         even number of men and women, and, failing         this, more men than women.           It is for the hostess to choose the leader         of the cotillion, and to him are entrusted all         its details.           At the conclusion of the cotillion the hostess         stands at the door with the leader at         her side, to receive the greetings and the compliments         of the guests.           See also BALLS--HOSTESS.      INVITATIONS. The invitations are engraved, and the         hour for beginning is placed in the lower         left-hand corner, and are sent out two weeks         in advance. They may be sent in one envelope.           Such invitations should be promptly accepted         or declined.        COTILIONS BY SUBSCRIPTIONS. These are given by leading         society women, who subscribe to a fund         sufficient to pay all expenses of the         entertainment. They are usually held in some         fashionable resort where suitable         accommodations can be had.           Guests are shown to the cloak-room, where         attendants check their wraps.           After the supper, the German, or cotillion,         begins. Those not dancing in this generally         retire. When leaving, guests should take         leave especially of the patroness inviting         them.      DRESS. Full dress is worn by all.      INVITATIONS. The patronesses whose names appear         on the back of the cards are the subscribers.         They send out the invitations to         their friends. A presentation card, to be         shown at the door, is sent with the invitation.      MEN. Men wear evening dress.           The men wait upon their partners and         themselves at the table, the waiters assisting,         unless small tables are used, when the         patronesses sit by themselves, and others form         groups as they like. The guests are served         by the waiters, as at a dinner.           When retiring, guests should take leave         especially of the patroness inviting them.      PATRONESSES. The patronesses stand in line to         receive the guests, bowing or shaking hands         as they prefer.           When supper is announced, the leading         patroness leads the way with her escort, the         others following. If small tables are used,         the patronesses sit by themselves.      WOMEN. Women wear full dress.           When guests depart, they should take         leave especially of the patroness inviting         them.        COUNTESS--HOW ADDRESSED. An official letter begins:         Madam, and ends: I have the honor to         remain your Ladyship's most obedient servant.         The address on the envelope is: To the         Right Honorable The Countess of Kent.           A social letter begins: Dear Lady Kent,         and ends: Believe me, dear Lady Kent,         sincerely yours.           The address is: To the Countess of Kent.        COUNTRY CALLS. The usual rule in calling is for the         residents to call first upon the temporary         cottage people, and between these latter the         early comers call first upon those coming         later.           In the city there is no necessity for         neighbors to call upon each other.        CRACKERS should be broken into small pieces and         eaten with the fingers.        CRESTS. If men and women wish, these may be         stamped in the latest fashionable colors on         their stationery. It is not customary to use         a crest and a stamped address on the same         paper.           The present fashion in crests is that they         should be of small size.           It is not usual to stamp the crest on the         flap of the envelope.           If sealing-wax is used, some dull color         should be chosen.           A person should avoid all individual         eccentricities and oddities in stamping, such         as facsimile autographs, etc.        CRYSTAL WEDDINGS. This anniversary comes after         fifteen years of married life, and the         invitations may bear the words: No presents         received, and on their acceptance or declination,         congratulations may be extended. An         entertainment should be provided for. Any         article of crystal or glass is appropriate as a         gift.        DANCES.      CARRIAGES. A man should secure his carriage-check         when leaving his carriage. It is safer         to take wraps and coats to the house in case         of accidents.           When taking a woman wearing evening         dress to a ball or dance, a man should         provide a carriage.      DEBUTANTE. See DANCES--WOMEN--DEBUTANTE.      DRESS. Evening dress is worn by men and         women.      DINNER INVITATIONS. The hostess issues two         sets of invitations--one for those invited to         both dinner and dance, and one for those         invited to the dance only.           For the former, the hostess should use her         usual engraved dinner cards, with the written         words: Dancing at eleven, and for the latter         her usual engraved At Home cards, with the         written words: Dancing at eleven.           A less formal way is to use, instead of         the At Home card, a Mr. and Mrs. card,         or Mrs. And Miss card, with the following         written in the lower left-hand corner:         Dancing at ten. March the second. R. S. V. P.      INVITATIONS. These should be acknowledged         by an acceptance, or declined, with a note of         regret within one week.      MEN. ASKING A WOMAN TO DANCE. A man         asks for the privilege of a dance, either with         the daughter of the hostess or with any guest         of the latter or any young woman receiving         with her.           On being introduced to a woman, he may         ask her for a dance, and he should be prompt         in keeping his appointment.           It is her privilege to end the dance, and,         when it is ended, he should conduct her to         her chaperone, or, failing that, he should find         her a seat--after which he is at perfect liberty         to go elsewhere.           If for any cause a man has to break his         engagements to dance, he should personally         explain the matter to every woman with         whom he has an engagement and make a         suitable apology.      DEBUTANTE. At a debutante's reception the         first partner is selected by the mother, usually         the nearest and dearest friend, who         dances but once, and the others follow.      INVITATIONS. Invitations to balls or assemblies         should be answered immediately; if declined,         the ticket should be returned. A man should         call or leave cards a few days before the         affair.      SUPPER. At balls and assemblies where small         tables are provided, a man should not sit         alone with his partner, but make up a party         in advance, and keep together.           If a patroness asks a man to sit at her         table, she should provide a partner for him.           At supper the senior patroness leads the         way, escorted by the man honored for the         occasion.           If one large table is provided, the men,         assisted by the waiters, serve the women.         When small tables are used the patronesses         generally sit by themselves, and the         guests group themselves to their own satisfaction.      TRONESSES. Their duties are varied and         responsible--among them, the subscription to         the expenses of the entertainments.           The patronesses should be divided into         various committees to attend to special duties         --as, music, caterers, supper arrangements,         the ball-room, and all other details.           While affairs of this kind could be left in         the hands of those employed to carry out the         details, it is better and safer for each committee         to follow the various matters out to the         smallest details.           Those devising new features and surprises         for such an occasion will give the most successful ball.           The one most active and having the best         business ability should take the lead.           Lists should be compared, in order to avoid         duplicate invitations.         "]]]
