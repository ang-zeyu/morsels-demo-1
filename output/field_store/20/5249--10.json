Happily the task  was finished before the eastern sky grew gray, or the cocks crowed.  While it was yet dark, the music in the air flooded the earth. The  people in their beds listened with rapture.    \"Laus Deo\" (Praise God), devoutly cried the surprised bishop. \"It sounds  like a choir of angels. Surely the cherubim and seraphim are here. Now  is fulfilled the promise of the Psalmist: 'The players on instruments  shall be there.'\"    So, from this beginning, so mysterious to the rough, unwise and stupid  teachers, but, by degrees, clearer to the tactful ones, who were kind  and patient, the carillons spread over all the region between the  forests of Ardennes and the island in the North Sea. The Netherlands  became the land of melodious symphonies and of tinkling bells. No town,  however poor, but in time had its carillon. Every quarter of an hour,  the sweet music of hymn or song, made the air vocal, while at the  striking of the hours, the pious bowed their heads and the workmen heard  the call for rest, or they took cheer, because their day's toil was  over. At sunrise, noon, or sunset, the Angelus, and at night the curfew  sounded their calls.    It grew into a fashion, that, on stated days, great concerts were given,  lasting over an hour, when the grand works of the masters of music were  rendered and famous carillon players came from all over the Netherlands,  to compete for prizes. The Low Countries became a famous school, in  which klokken-spielers (bell players) by scores were trained. Thus no  kingdom, however rich or great, ever equalled the Land of the Carillon,  in making the air sweet with both melody and harmony.    Nobody ever sees a kabouter nowadays, for in the new world, when the  woods are nearly all cut down, the world made by the steam engine, and  telegraph, and wireless message, the automobile, aeroplane and  submarine, cycle and under-sea boat, the little folks in the mines and  forests are forgotten. The chemists, miners, engineers and learned men  possess the secrets which were once those of the fairies only. Yet the  artists and architects, the clockmakers and bellfounders, who love  beauty, remember what their fathers once thought and believed. That is  the reason why, on many a famous clock, either in front of the dial or  near the pendulum, are figures of the gnomes, who thought, and the  kabouters who wrought, to make the carillons. In Teuton lands, where  their cousins are named kobolds, and in France where they are called  f√©e, and in England brownies, they have tolling and ringing of bells,  with peals, chimes and cascades of sweet sound; but the Netherlands,  still, above all others on earth, is the home of the carillon.          THE WOMAN WITH THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SIX CHILDREN      Long, long ago, before the oldest stork was young and big deer and  little fawns were very many in the Dutch forests, there was a pond,  famous for its fish, which lay in the very heart of Holland, with woods  near by. Hunters came with their bows and arrows to hunt the stags. Or,  out of the bright waters, boys and men in the sunshine drew out the fish  with shining scales, or lured the trout, with fly-bait, from their  hiding places. In those days the fish-pond was called the Vijver, and  the woods where the deer ran, Rensselaer, or the Deer's Lair.    So, because the forests of oak, and beech, and alder trees were so fine,  and game on land and in water so plentiful, the lord of the country came  here and built his castle. He made a hedge around his estate, so that  the people called the place the Count's Hedge; or, as we say, The Hague.    Even to-day, within the beautiful city, the forests, with their grand  old trees, still remain, and the fish-pond, called the Vijver, is there  yet, with its swans. On the little island, the fluffy, downy cygnets are  born and grow to be big birds, with long necks, bent like an arch. In  another part of the town, also, with their trees for nesting, and their  pond for wading, are children of the same storks, whose fathers and  mothers lived there before America was discovered.    By and by, many people of rank and fortune came to The Hague, for its  society. They built their grand houses at the slope of the hill, not far  away from the Vijver, and in time a city grew up.    It was a fine sight to see the lords and ladies riding out from the  castle into the country. The cavalcade was very splendid, when they went  hawking. There were pretty women on horseback, and gentlemen in velvet  clothes, with feathers in their hats, and the horses seemed proud to  bear them. The falconers followed on foot, with the hunting birds  perched on a hoop, which the man inside the circle carried round him.  Each falcon had on a little cap or hood, which was fastened over its  head. When this was taken off, it flew high up into the air, on its hunt  for the big and little birds, which it brought down for its masters.  There were also men with dogs, to beat the reeds and bushes, and drive  the smaller birds from shelter. The huntsmen were armed with spears,  lest a wild boar, or bear, should rush out and attack them. It was  always a merry day, when a hawking party, in their fine clothes and gay  trappings, started out.    There were huts, as well as palaces, and poor people, also, at The  Hague. Among these, was a widow, whose twin babies were left without  anything to eat--for her husband and their father had been killed in the  war. Having no money to buy a cradle, and her babies being too young to  be left alone, she put the pair of little folks on her back and went out  to beg.    Now there was a fine lady, a Countess, who lived with her husband, the  Count, near the Vijver. She was childless and very jealous of other  women who were mothers and had children playing around them. On this  day, when the beggar woman, with her two babies on her back, came along,  the grand lady was in an unusually bad temper. For all her pretty  clothes, she was not a person of fine manners. Indeed, she often acted  more like a snarling dog, ready to snap at any one who should speak to  her. Although she had cradles and nurses and lovely baby clothes all  ready, there was no baby. This spoiled her disposition, so that her  husband and the servants could hardly live with her.    One day, after dinner, when there had been everything good to eat and  drink on her table, and plenty of it, the Countess went out to walk in  front of her house. It was the third day of January, but the weather was  mild. The beggar woman, with her two babies on her back and their arms  round her neck, crying with hunger, came trudging along. She went into  the garden and asked the Countess for food or an alms. She expected  surely, at least a slice of bread, a cup of milk, or a small coin.    But the Countess was rude to her and denied her both food and money. She  even burst into a bad temper, and reviled the woman for having two  children, instead of one.    \"Where did you get those brats? They are not yours. You just brought  them here to play on my feelings and excite my jealousy. Begone!\"    But the poor woman kept her temper. She begged piteously and said: \"For  the love of Heaven, feed my babies, even if you will not feed me.\"    \"No! they are not yours. You're a cheat,\" said the fine lady, nursing  her rage.    \"Indeed, Madame, they are both my children and born on one day. They  have one father, but he is dead. He was killed in the war, while serving  his grace, your husband.\"    \"Don't tell me such a story,\" snapped back the Countess, now in a fury.  \"I don't believe that any one, man or woman, could have two children at  once. Away with you,\" and she seized a stick to drive off the poor  woman.    Now, it was the turn of the beggar to answer back. Both had lost their  temper, and the two angry women seemed more like she-bears robbed of  their whelps.    \"Heaven punish you, you wicked, cruel, cold-hearted woman,\" cried the  mother. Her two babies were almost choking her in their eagerness for  food. Yet their cries never moved the rich lady, who had bread and good  things to spare, while their poor parent had not a drop of milk to give  them. The Countess now called her men-servants to drive the beggar away.  This they did, most brutally. They pushed the poor woman outside the  garden gate and closed it behind her. As she turned away, the poor  mother, taking each of her children by its back, one in each hand, held  them up before the grand lady and cried out loudly, so that all heard  her:    \"May you have as many children as there are days in the year.\"    Now with all her wrath burning in her breast, what the beggar woman  really meant was this: It was the third of January, and so there were  but three days in the year, so far. She intended to say that, instead of  having to care for two children, the Countess might have the trouble of  rearing three, and all born on the same day.    But the fine lady, in her mansion, cared nothing for the beggar woman's  words. Why should she? She had her lordly husband, who was a count, and  he owned thousands of acres. Besides, she possessed vast riches. In her  great house, were ten men-servants and thirty-one maid-servants,  together with her rich furniture, and fine clothes and jewels. The lofty  brick church, to which she went on Sundays, was hung with the coats of  arms of her famous ancestors. The stone floor, with its great slabs, was  so grandly carved with the crests and heraldry of her family, that to  walk over these was like climbing a mountain, or tramping across a  ploughed field. Common folks had to be careful, lest they should stumble  over the bosses and knobs of the carved tombs. A long train of her  servants, and tenants on the farms followed her, when she went to  worship. Inside the church, the lord and lady sat, in high seats, on  velvet cushions and under a canopy.

When he comes upon  a marshy spot he lies down and rolls about until he has worn out a large  and shallow excavation into which the water oozes through the damp soil.  Lying down again he rolls and turns until he is plastered from head  to tail with mud. Though it cannot be said that it adds to his  attractiveness, yet the coating no doubt serves well as a protection  against the swarms of insects, which are sometimes terrible enough to  sting animals to death.    Those who have viewed the scraggy specimens in the menageries and  zoological gardens would scarcely suspect the activity and power of  running possessed by them. The body is covered with such an abundance  of hair that it looks larger than it really is, while the legs appear  smaller. But the bison not only can run swiftly, but possesses great  endurance. They will often dash at full speed over ground so rough that  the more graceful horse will stumble.    When wounded by the hunters, a bull will sometimes turn in desperation  on his persecutor. Then, unless the horse is well trained, serious  consequences are likely to follow. The plunging thrust of his stumpy  horns perhaps rips open the steed, sending the rider flying over the  back of the furious bison, who may turn upon him and slay him before he  can escape.    This rarely happens, however, the bison being a huge, cowardly creature  which prefers to run rather than fight, and a hunt of the game in these  days often takes the character of wholesale butchery in which no true  sportsman would engage.

A Strange Occurrence--Arrival of Friends--Carson Joins a Large   Company--Trapping on the Yellowstone--The Blackfeet--A Dreadful   Scourge--In Winter Quarters--The Friendly Crow Indians--Loss of Two   Trappers--On the Head Waters of the Missouri.    A singular occurrence took place a few nights after the return of Carson  and his friends from an extended bison hunt. Their horses and mules were  corralled near the post and a sentinel was on duty at all hours of the  night to prevent the animals being stolen by the Indians who were always  prowling through the neighborhood.    In the dim uncertain light, just beyond midnight, the sentinel saw two  men walk forward from the darkness, and without any appearance of haste,  let down the bars and drive out the stock. Very naturally he concluded  they were his friends who intended to take out the animals to graze. As  there was nothing more for him to do, he sought his quarters, lay down  and went to sleep.    In the morning not a horse or a mule was to be found. The two  individuals who had let down the bars and driven them out, were  Blackfeet Indians, whose complete success was due to their amazing  audacity. Had they shown any hesitation or haste, the suspicions of the  sentinel would have been aroused, but when the truth became known, he  was the most astonished man at the fort.    The hunters were in a most sorry plight, for the Blackfeet having made  a clean sweep, they were without the means of pursuing and recovering  their property. The parties who belonged at the fort had suffered a  somewhat similar trick a short time before from the same tribe, so that  only a few rickety horses remained in their possession.    Under the circumstances, the trappers were compelled to accept their  misfortune with grim philosophy, and await the arrival of the rest  of the party, who had promised to rejoin them after completing their  business at Fort Walla Walla.    Sure enough, a few weeks later, their friends appeared and  providentially indeed they brought with them an extra supply of  excellent horses. The trappers were in overflowing spirits once more and  soon started for the general rendezvous on Green River.    Other trappers continued to arrive for a number of days, until about all  that were expected had come in. Trade and barter then began and lasted  some three weeks. The scene was picturesque and stirring and there was  much hand shaking and pleasant wishes when the time came to separate.    Kit Carson left the employ of the Hudson Bay Company trader and attached  himself to a party numbering fully a hundred who had determined to  trap along the Yellowstone. It will be recalled that Carson once quit a  company of trappers because it was too large, and it may be wondered why  he should join one that was still more numerous. The reason he did  so was because they were going into the very heart of the Blackfoot  country. They had suffered so much from these daring marauders that  they knew there would be no safety unless they went in strong force.  Furthermore, the whites had so many old scores to settle with those  redskins that they meant to invite attack from them. If the Blackfeet  would only offer the opportunity for battle, the trappers meant to give  them their fill.    The formidable company arranged matters according to a system. Dividing  into two equal parties, the duty of one was made to trap beaver, while  the other furnished food and guarded the property. By this means,  they would always be in shape to meet their sworn foes, while the real  business which brought them into the country would not be neglected.    The hunters were confident they would not be left alone very long. The  Blackfeet would resent the invasion of their hunting grounds, and to say  the least, would take measures to prevent the time hanging heavily on  the hands of the pale faces.    But, to the astonishment of the trappers, the days passed without  bringing a glimpse of the savages. No hostile shot awoke the impressive  stillness of the wilderness. Could it be the Blackfeet were seeking to  throw the whites off their guard? Did they expect to induce a degree of  carelessness that would enable the Blackfeet to gather their warriors  and overwhelm them before they could reply?    It was not reasonable to suppose that the sagacious tribe held any such  belief, for they could not have failed to know that any such hope was  idle.    But the explanation came one day by a party of friendly Crow Indians,  who stated that the small pox was raging with such awful virulence among  the Blackfeet that they were dying by hundreds and thousands. Indeed,  the havoc was so dreadful that there was reason to believe the whole  tribe would be swept away.    It would not be the first time that such an annihilation has taken place  among the American Indians. The treatment required by that frightful  disease is precisely the opposite of that which the red man in his  ignorance pursues. When small pox breaks out among them, therefore, the  mortality becomes appalling.    The Crow Indians affiliated with the trappers and guided them to a  secluded valley, where they established themselves for the winter. The  lodges were made strong and substantial, and it was fortunate that such  precautions were taken, for the winter proved one of the severest known  for many years. With their abundance of fuel, they kept enormous fires  going and passed the days and nights in comparative comfort.    But it was far different with their stock. During the severe weather,  the only food that could be obtained was the bark of the cottonwood.  The inner lining of this is quite palatable to animals and in cases of  extremity it affords temporary sustenance to men. With its help actual  starvation was kept away, though it came very close.    Unusual weather always brings unusual experience, and the intense cold  developed an annoyance to the trappers upon which they had not counted.  The difficulty of finding food was felt by the wild animals as well  as domestic, and the bisons became desperate. When they saw the horses  eating their fodder, they rushed forward and with lowered heads drove  them away. If a horse or mule refused, he was likely to be gored to  death.    The beasts finally became so numerous and fierce they would have killed  all the stock of our friends if they had not kindled large fires and  mounted constant guard. When the weather moderated those annoyances  ended.    Had any explorer of the west found his way to the secluded valley  where the trappers were in winter quarters, he would have looked upon  a striking scene. The Crow Indians and white men engaged in numerous  athletic sports in friendly rivalry. They maintained the best of terms,  and when the bisons departed, the strange community enjoyed themselves  far better than would be supposed. In truth where they were favored with  such rugged health and where they had plenty of food and comfortable  quarters, it would have been remarkable had they not been comparatively  happy. They were not disturbed by political discussions or diversity of  views on any public questions and were satisfied that the glorious Union  was safe without any worriment on their part.    When spring came, two of their party were sent to Fort Laramie to  procure needed supplies. They went off well mounted and armed and  were never heard of again. Somewhere in the recesses of the forest or  mountain, the Blackfeet had probably killed them as they had done with  many a brave man before, and as they have done with multitudes since.    When it became certain the messengers had been slain, the company  began the spring hunt without them. After trapping a brief while on the  Yellowstone, they worked their way to the head waters of the Missouri.  They met with fair success and while engaged in that section, learned  that the reports of the ravages of the small pox among the Blackfeet had  been greatly exaggerated. Instead of being decimated, the tribe had  not suffered to any serious extent and were as strong and aggressive as  ever.    The trappers were not displeased to learn that such was the case,  for they desired a settlement of accounts with them. Under such  circumstances it was impossible that hostilities should be long delayed.        CHAPTER XV.       A Fierce Battle with the Blackfeet--Daring Act of"]]]
