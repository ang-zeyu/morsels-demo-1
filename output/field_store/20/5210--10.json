This summary and Captain Kettle-like move had its  effect. There was no more hooting. The fags bethought themselves of  other ways of showing their disapproval of their new head.    One genius suggested that they might kill two birds with one  stone--snub Kennedy and pay a stately compliment to Fenn by applying  to the latter for leave to go out of bounds instead of to the former.  As the giving of leave \"down town\" was the prerogative of the head of  the house, and of no other, there was a suggestiveness about this mode  of procedure which appealed to the junior dayroom.    But the star of the junior dayroom was not in the ascendant. Fenn  might have quarrelled with Kennedy, and be extremely indignant at his  removal from the headship of the house, but he was not the man to  forget to play the game. His policy of non-interference did not  include underhand attempts to sap Kennedy's authority. When Gorrick,  of the Lower Fourth, the first of the fags to put the ingenious scheme  into practice, came to him, still smarting from Kennedy's castigation,  Fenn promptly gave him six more cuts, worse than the first, and kicked  him out into the passage. Gorrick naturally did not want to spoil a  good thing by giving Fenn's game away, so he lay low and said nothing,  with the result that Wren and three others met with the same fate,  only more so, because Fenn's wrath increased with each visit.    Kennedy, of course, heard nothing of this, or he might perhaps have  thought better of Fenn. As for the junior dayroom, it was obliged to  work off its emotion by jeering Jimmy Silver from the safety of the  touchline when the head of Blackburn's was refereeing in a match  between the juniors of his house and those of Kay's. Blackburn's  happened to win by four goals and eight tries, a result which the  patriotic Kay fag attributed solely to favouritism on the part of the  referee.    \"I like the kids in your house,\" said Jimmy to Kennedy, after the  match, when telling the latter of the incident; \"there's no false idea  of politeness about them. If they don't like your decisions, they say  so in a shrill treble.\"    \"Little beasts,\" said Kennedy. \"I wish I knew who they were. It's  hopeless to try and spot them, of course.\"          XI    THE SENIOR DAYROOM OPENS FIRE      Curiously enough, it was shortly after this that the junior dayroom  ceased almost entirely to trouble the head of the house. Not that they  turned over new leaves, and modelled their conduct on that of the hero  of the Sunday-school story. They were still disorderly, but in a  lesser degree; and ragging became a matter of private enterprise among  the fags instead of being, as it had threatened to be, an organised  revolt against the new head. When a Kay's fag rioted now, he did so  with the air of one endeavouring to amuse himself, not as if he were  carrying on a holy war against the oppressor.    Kennedy's difficulties were considerably diminished by this change. A  head of a house expects the juniors of his house to rag. It is what  they are put into the world to do, and there is no difficulty in  keeping the thing within decent limits. A revolution is another case  altogether. Kennedy was grateful for the change, for it gave him more  time to keep an eye on the other members of the house, but he had no  idea what had brought it about. As a matter of fact, he had Billy  Silver to thank for it. The chief organiser of the movement against  Kennedy in the junior dayroom had been the red-haired Wren, who  preached war to his fellow fags, partly because he loved to create a  disturbance, and partly because Walton, who hated Kennedy, had told  him to. Between Wren and Billy Silver a feud had existed since their  first meeting. The unsatisfactory conclusion to their encounter in  camp had given another lease of life to the feud, and Billy had come  back to Kay's with the fixed intention of smiting his auburn-haired  foe hip and thigh at the earliest opportunity. Wren's attitude with  respect to Kennedy gave him a decent excuse. He had no particular  regard for Kennedy. The fact that he was a friend of his brother's was  no recommendation. There existed between the two Silvers that feeling  which generally exists between an elder and a much younger brother at  the same school. Each thought the other a bit of an idiot, and though  equal to tolerating him personally, was hanged if he was going to do  the same by his friends. In Billy's circle of acquaintances, Jimmy's  friends were looked upon with cold suspicion as officious meddlers who  would give them lines if they found them out of bounds. The  aristocrats with whom Jimmy foregathered barely recognised the  existence of Billy's companions. Kennedy's claim to Billy's good  offices rested on the fact that they both objected to Wren.    So that, when Wren lifted up his voice in the junior dayroom, and  exhorted the fags to go and make a row in the passage outside  Kennedy's study, and--from a safe distance, and having previously  ensured a means of rapid escape--to fling boots at his door, Billy  damped the popular enthusiasm which had been excited by the proposal  by kicking Wren with some violence, and begging him not to be an ass.  Whereupon they resumed their battle at the point at which it had been  interrupted at camp. And when, some five minutes later, Billy, from  his seat on his adversary's chest, offered to go through the same  performance with anybody else who wished, the junior dayroom came to  the conclusion that his feelings with regard to the new head of the  house, however foolish and unpatriotic, had better be respected. And  the revolution of the fags had fizzled out from that moment.    In the senior dayroom, however, the flag of battle was still unfurled.  It was so obvious that Kennedy had been put into the house as a  reformer, and the seniors of Kay's had such an objection to being  reformed, that trouble was only to be expected. It was the custom in  most houses for the head of the house, by right of that position, to  be also captain of football. The senior dayroom was aggrieved at  Kennedy's taking this post from Fenn. Fenn was in his second year in  the school fifteen, and he was the three-quarter who scored most  frequently for Eckleton, whereas Kennedy, though practically a  certainty for one of the six vacant places in the school scrum, was at  present entitled to wear only a second fifteen cap. The claims of Fenn  to be captain of Kay's football were strong, Kennedy had begged him to  continue in that position more than once. Fenn's persistent refusal  had helped to increase the coolness between them, and it had also made  things more difficult for Kennedy in the house.    It was on the Monday of the third week of term that Kennedy, at Jimmy  Silver's request, arranged a \"friendly\" between Kay's and Blackburn's.  There could be no doubt as to which was the better team (for  Blackburn's had been runners up for the Cup the season before), but  the better one's opponents the better the practice. Kennedy wrote out  the list and fixed it on the notice board. The match was to be played  on the following afternoon.    A football team must generally be made up of the biggest men at the  captain's disposal, so it happened that Walton, Perry, Callingham, and  the other leaders of dissension in Kay's all figured on the list. The  consequence was that the list came in for a good deal of comment in  the senior dayroom. There were games every Saturday and Wednesday, and  it annoyed Walton and friends that they should have to turn out on an  afternoon that was not a half holiday. It was trouble enough playing  football on the days when it was compulsory. As for patriotism, no  member of the house even pretended to care whether Kay's put a good  team into the field or not. The senior dayroom sat talking over the  matter till lights-out. When Kennedy came down next morning, he found  his list scribbled over with blue pencil, while across it in bold  letters ran the single word,        ROT.    He went to his study, wrote out a fresh copy, and pinned it up in  place of the old one. He had been early in coming down that morning,  and the majority of the Kayites had not seen the defaced notice. The  match was fixed for half-past four. At four a thin rain was falling.  The weather had been bad for some days, but on this particular  afternoon it reached the limit. In addition to being wet, it was also  cold, and Kennedy, as he walked over to the grounds, felt that he  would be glad when the game was over. He hoped that Blackburn's would  be punctual, and congratulated himself on his foresight in securing Mr  Blackburn as referee. Some of the staff, when they consented to hold  the whistle in a scratch game, invariably kept the teams waiting on  the field for half an hour before turning up. Mr Blackburn, an the  other hand, was always punctual. He came out of his house just as  Kennedy turned in at the school gates.    \"Well, Kennedy,\" he said from the depths of his ulster, the collar of  which he had turned up over his ears with a prudence which Kennedy,  having come out with only a blazer on over his football clothes,  distinctly envied, \"I hope your men are not going to be late. I don't  think I ever saw a worse day for football. How long were you thinking  of playing? Two twenty-fives would be enough for a day like this, I  think.\"    Kennedy consulted with Jimmy Silver, who came up at this moment, and  they agreed without argument that twenty-five minutes each way would  be the very thing.    \"Where are your men?\" asked Jimmy. \"I've got all our chaps out here,  bar Challis, who'll be out in a few minutes. I left him almost  changed.\"    Challis appeared a little later, and joined the rest of Blackburn's  team, who were putting in the time and trying to keep warm by running  and passing and dropping "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6879"],[0,"The Gold Bat (#12)"],[1,"in large numbers to watch.    \"Seymour's looking tired of life,\" said Clowes. \"That would seem as if  his fellows weren't doing well.\"    \"What's been happening here?\" asked Trevor of an enthusiast in a  Seymour's house cap whose face was crimson with yelling.    \"One goal all,\" replied the enthusiast huskily. \"Did you beat  Appleby's?\"    \"Yes. Thirty points before half-time. Who's been doing the scoring  here?\"    \"Milton got in for us. He barged through out of touch. We've been  pressing the whole time. Barry got over once, but he was held up.  Hullo, they're beginning again. Buck up, Sey-_mour's_.\"    His voice cracking on the high note, he took an immense slab of vanilla  chocolate as a remedy for hoarseness.    \"Who scored for Day's?\" asked Clowes.    \"Strachan. Rand-Brown let him through from their twenty-five. You never  saw anything so rotten as Rand-Brown. He doesn't take his passes, and  Strachan gets past him every time.\"    \"Is Strachan playing on the wing?\"    Strachan was the first fifteen full-back.    \"Yes. They've put young Bassett back instead of him. Sey-_mour's_.  Buck up, Seymour's. We-ell played! There, did you ever see anything  like it?\" he broke off disgustedly.    The Seymourite playing centre next to Rand-Brown had run through to the  back and passed out to his wing, as a good centre should. It was a  perfect pass, except that it came at his head instead of his chest.  Nobody with any pretensions to decent play should have missed it.  Rand-Brown, however, achieved that feat. The ball struck his hands  and bounded forward. The referee blew his whistle for a scrum, and a  certain try was lost.    From the scrum the Seymour's forwards broke away to the goal-line,  where they were pulled up by Bassett. The next minute the defence had  been pierced, and Drummond was lying on the ball a yard across the  line. The enthusiast standing by Clowes expended the last relics of his  voice in commemorating the fact that his side had the lead.    \"Drummond'll be good next year,\" said Trevor. And he made a mental note  to tell Allardyce, who would succeed him in the command of the school  football, to keep an eye on the player in question.    The triumph of the Seymourites was not long lived. Milton failed to  convert Drummond's try. From the drop-out from the twenty-five line  Barry got the ball, and punted into touch. The throw-out was not  straight, and a scrum was formed. The ball came out to the Day's  halves, and went across to Strachan. Rand-Brown hesitated, and then  made a futile spring at the first fifteen man's neck. Strachan handed  him off easily, and ran. The Seymour's full-back, who was a poor  player, failed to get across in time. Strachan ran round behind the  posts, the kick succeeded, and Day's now led by two points.    After this the game continued in Day's half. Five minutes before time  was up, Drummond got the ball from a scrum nearly on the line, passed  it to Barry on the wing instead of opening up the game by passing to  his centres, and Barry slipped through in the corner. This put  Seymour's just one point ahead, and there they stayed till the whistle  blew for no-side.    Milton walked over to the boarding-houses with Clowes and Trevor. He  was full of the match, particularly of the iniquity of Rand-Brown.  \"I  slanged him on the field,\" he said. \"It's a thing I don't often do, but  what else _can_ you do when a man plays like that? He lost us  three certain tries.\"    \"When did you administer your rebuke?\" inquired Clowes.    \"When he had let Strachan through that second time, in the second half.  I asked him why on earth he tried to play footer at all. I told him a  good kiss-in-the-ring club was about his form. It was rather cheap, but  I felt so frightfully sick about it. It's sickening to be let down like  that when you've been pressing the whole time, and ought to be scoring  every other minute.\"    \"What had he to say on the subject?\" asked Clowes.    \"Oh, he gassed a bit until I told him I'd kick him if he said another  word. That shut him up.\"    \"You ought to have kicked him. You want all the kicking practice you  can get. I never saw anything feebler than that shot of yours after  Drummond's try.\"    \"I'd like to see _you_ take a kick like that. It was nearly on the  touch-line. Still, when we play you, we shan't need to convert any of  our tries. We'll get our thirty points without that. Perhaps you'd like  to scratch?\"    \"As a matter of fact,\" said Clowes confidentially, \"I am going to score  seven tries against you off my own bat. You'll be sorry you ever turned  out when we've finished with you.\"          XII    NEWS OF THE GOLD BAT      Shoeblossom sat disconsolately on the table in the senior day-room. He  was not happy in exile. Brewing in the senior day-room was a mere  vulgar brawl, lacking all the refining influences of the study. You had  to fight for a place at the fire, and when you had got it 'twas not  always easy to keep it, and there was no privacy, and the fellows were  always bear-fighting, so that it was impossible to read a book quietly  for ten consecutive minutes without some ass heaving a cushion at you  or turning out the gas. Altogether Shoeblossom yearned for the peace of  his study, and wished earnestly that Mr Seymour would withdraw the  order of banishment. It was the not being able to read that he objected  to chiefly. In place of brewing, the ex-proprietors of studies five,  six, and seven now made a practice of going to the school shop. It was  more expensive and not nearly so comfortable--there is a romance about  a study brew which you can never get anywhere else--but it served, and  it was not on this score that he grumbled most. What he hated was  having to live in a bear-garden. For Shoeblossom was a man of moods.  Give him two or three congenial spirits to back him up, and he would  lead the revels with the _abandon_ of a Mr Bultitude (after his  return to his original form). But he liked to choose his accomplices,  and the gay sparks of the senior day-room did not appeal to him. They  were not intellectual enough. In his lucid intervals, he was accustomed  to be almost abnormally solemn and respectable. When not promoting some  unholy rag, Shoeblossom resembled an elderly gentleman of studious  habits. He liked to sit in a comfortable chair and read a book. It was  the impossibility of doing this in the senior day-room that led him to  try and think of some other haven where he might rest. Had it been  summer, he would have taken some literature out on to the cricket-field  or the downs, and put in a little steady reading there, with the aid of  a bag of cherries. But with the thermometer low, that was impossible.    He felt very lonely and dismal. He was not a man with many friends. In  fact, Barry and the other three were almost the only members of the  house with whom he was on speaking-terms. And of these four he saw very  little. Drummond and Barry were always out of doors or over at the  gymnasium, and as for M'Todd and De Bertini, it was not worth while  talking to the one, and impossible to talk to the other. No wonder  Shoeblossom felt dull. Once Barry and Drummond had taken him over to  the gymnasium with them, but this had bored him worse than ever. They  had been hard at it all the time--for, unlike a good many of the  school, they went to the gymnasium for business, not to lounge--and he  had had to sit about watching them. And watching gymnastics was one of  the things he most loathed. Since then he had refused to go.    That night matters came to a head. Just as he had settled down to read,  somebody, in flinging a cushion across the room, brought down the gas  apparatus with a run, and before light was once more restored it was  tea-time. After that there was preparation, which lasted for two hours,  and by the time he had to go to bed he had not been able to read a  single page of the enthralling work with which he was at present  occupied.    He had just got into bed when he was struck with a brilliant idea. Why  waste the precious hours in sleep? What was that saying of somebody's,  \"Five hours for a wise man, six for somebody else--he forgot whom--eight  for a fool, nine for an idiot,\" or words to that effect? Five hours  sleep would mean that he need not go to bed till half past two. In the  meanwhile he could be finding out exactly what the hero _did_ do when  he found out (to his horror) that it was his cousin Jasper who had  really killed the old gentleman in the wood. The only question was--how  was he to do his reading? Prefects were allowed to work on after lights  out in their dormitories by the aid of a candle, but to the ordinary  mortal this was forbidden.    Then he was struck with another brilliant idea. It is a curious thing  about ideas. You do not get one for over a month, and then there comes  a rush of them, all brilliant. Why, he thought, should he not go and  read in his study with a dark lantern? He had a dark lantern. It was  one of the things he had found lying about at home on the last day of  the holidays, and had brought with him to school. It was his custom to  go about the house just before the holidays ended, snapping up  unconsidered trifles, which might or might not come in useful. This  term he had brought back a curious metal vase (which looked Indian, but  which had probably been made in Birmingham the year before last), two  old coins (of no mortal use to anybody in the world, including  himself), and the dark lantern. It was reposing now in the cupboard in  his study nearest the window.    He had brought his book up with him on coming to bed, on the chance  that he might have time to read a page or two if he woke up early. (He  had always been doubtful about that man Jasper. For one thing, he had  been seen pawning the old gentleman's watch on the afternoon of the  murder, which was a suspicious circumstance, and then he was not a nice  character at all, and"]]]
