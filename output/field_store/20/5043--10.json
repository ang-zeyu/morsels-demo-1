I say that this poor little poem has three parts. The  first is a prelude. In the second, I speak of her. In the third, I  speak pitifully to the poem. The second begins here, \"Beatrice is gone  up;\" the third here, \"Weep, pitiful Song of mine.\" The first divides  into three. In the first, I say what moves me to speak. In the second,  I say to whom I mean to speak. In the third, I say of whom I mean to  speak. The second begins here, \"And because often, thinking;\" the third  here, \"And I will say.\" Then, when I say, \"Beatrice is gone up,\" I  speak of her; and concerning this I have two parts. First, I tell the  cause why she was taken away from us: afterwards, I say how one weeps  her parting; and this part commences here, \"Wonderfully.\" This part  divides into three. In the first, I say who it is that weeps her not.  In the second, I say who it is that doth weep her. In the third, I  speak of my condition. The second begins here, \"But sighing comes, and  grief;\" the third, \"With sighs.\" Then, when I say, \"Weep, pitiful Song  of mine,\" I speak to this my song, telling it what ladies to go to, and  stay with._        The eyes that weep for pity of the heart        Have wept so long that their grief languisheth,          And they have no more tears to weep withal:      And now, if I would ease me of a part        Of what, little by little, leads to death,          It must be done by speech, or not at all.          And because often, thinking, I recall      How it was pleasant, ere she went afar,        To talk of her with you, kind damozels,        I talk with no one else,      But only with such hearts as women's are.        And I will say,--still sobbing as speech fails,--      That she hath gone to Heaven suddenly,      And hath left Love below, to mourn with me.        Beatrice is gone up into high Heaven,        The kingdom where the angels are at peace;          And lives with them; and to her friends is dead.      Not by the frost of winter was she driven        Away, like others; nor by summer-heats;          But through a perfect gentleness, instead.          For from the lamp of her meek lowlihead      Such an exceeding glory went up hence        That it woke wonder in the Eternal Sire,        Until a sweet desire      Entered Him for that lovely excellence,        So that He bade her to Himself aspire;      Counting this weary and most evil place      Unworthy of a thing so full of grace.        Wonderfully out of the beautiful form        Soared her clear spirit, waxing glad the while;          And is in its first home, there where it is.      Who speaks thereof, and feels not the tears warm        Upon his face, must have become so vile          As to be dead to all sweet sympathies.          Out upon him! an abject wretch like this      May not imagine anything of her,--        He needs no bitter tears for his relief.        But sighing comes, and grief,      And the desire to find no comforter,        (Save only Death, who makes all sorrow brief),      To him who for a while turns in his thought      How she hath been among us, and is not.        With sighs my bosom always laboureth        In thinking, as I do continually,          Of her for whom my heart now breaks apace;      And very often when I think of death,        Such a great inward longing comes to me          That it will change the colour of my face;          And, if the idea settles in its place,      All my limbs shake as with an ague-fit:        Till, starting up in wild bewilderment,        I do become so shent      That I go forth, lest folk misdoubt of it.        Afterward, calling with a sore lament      On Beatrice, I ask, \"Canst thou be dead?\"      And calling on her, I am comforted.        Grief with its tears, and anguish with its sighs,        Come to me now whene'er I am alone;          So that I think the sight of me gives pain.      And what my life hath been, that living dies,        Since for my lady the New Birth's begun,          I have not any language to explain.          And so, dear ladies, though my heart were fain,      I scarce could tell indeed how I am thus.        All joy is with my bitter life at war;        Yea, I am fallen so far      That all men seem to say, \"Go out from us,\"        Eyeing my cold white lips, how dead they are.      But she, though I be bowed unto the dust,      Watches me; and will guerdon me, I trust.      Weep, pitiful Song of mine, upon thy way,        To the dames going and the damozels        For whom and for none else      Thy sisters have made music many a day.      Thou, that art very sad and not as they,        Go dwell thou with them as a mourner dwells.    After I had written this poem, I received the visit of a friend whom  I counted as second unto me in the degrees of friendship, and who,  moreover, had been united by the nearest kindred to that most gracious  creature. And when we had a little spoken together, he began to solicit  me that I would write somewhat in memory of a lady who had died; and he  disguised his speech, so as to seem to be speaking of another who was  but lately dead: wherefore I, perceiving that his speech was of none  other than that blessed one herself, told him that it should be done  as he required. Then afterwards, having thought thereof, I imagined to  give vent in a sonnet to some part of my hidden lamentations; but in  such sort that it might seem to be spoken by this friend of mine, to  whom I was to give it. And the sonnet saith thus: \"Stay now with me,\"  etc.    _This sonnet has two parts. In the first, I call the Faithful of Love  to hear me. In the second, I relate my miserable condition. The second  begins here, \"Mark how they force.\"_        Stay now with me, and listen to my sighs,        Ye piteous hearts, as pity bids ye do.        Mark how they force their way out and press through;      If they be once pent up, the whole life dies.      Seeing that now indeed my weary eyes        Oftener refuse than I can tell to you        (Even though my endless grief is ever new),      To weep and let the smothered anguish rise.      Also in sighing ye shall hear me call        On her whose blessed presence doth enrich          The only home that well befitteth her:      And ye shall hear a bitter scorn of all        Sent from the inmost of my spirit in speech          That mourns its joy and its joy's minister.    But when I had written this sonnet, bethinking me who he was to whom  I was to give it, that it might appear to be his speech, it seemed  to me that this was but a poor and barren gift for one of her so near  kindred. Wherefore, before giving him this sonnet, I wrote two stanzas  of a poem: the first being written in very sooth as though it were  spoken by him, but the other being mine own speech, albeit, unto one  who should not look closely, they would both seem to be said by the  same person. Nevertheless, looking closely, one must perceive that it  is not so, inasmuch as one does not call this most gracious creature  _his lady_, and the other does, as is manifestly apparent. And I gave  the poem and the sonnet unto my friend, saying that I had made them  only for him.    _The poem begins, \"Whatever while,\" and has two parts. In the first,  that is, in the first stanza, this my dear friend, her kinsman,  laments. In the second, I lament; that is, in the other stanza, which  begins, \"For ever.\" And thus it appears that in this poem two persons  lament, of whom one laments as a brother, the other as a servant._        Whatever while the thought comes over me        That I may not again          Behold that lady whom I mourn for now,      About my heart my mind brings constantly        So much of extreme pain          That I say, Soul of mine, why stayest thou?          Truly the anguish, Soul, that we must bow      Beneath, until we win out of this life,        Gives me full oft a fear that trembleth:        So that I call on Death      Even as on Sleep one calleth after strife,        Saying, Come unto me. Life showeth grim        And bare; and if one dies, I envy him.        For ever, among all my sighs which burn,        There is a piteous speech          That clamours upon death continually:      Yea, unto him doth my whole spirit turn        Since first his hand did reach          My lady's life with most foul cruelty.          But from the height of woman's fairness, she,      Going up from us with the joy we had,        Grew perfectly and spiritually fair;        That so she spreads even there      A light of Love which makes the Angels glad,        And even unto their subtle minds can bring        A certain awe of profound marvelling.    On that day which fulfilled the year since my lady had been made of  the citizens of eternal life, remembering me of her as I sat alone, I  betook myself to draw the resemblance of an angel upon certain tablets.  And while I did thus, chancing to turn my head, I perceived that some  were standing beside me to whom I should have given courteous welcome,  and that they were observing what I did: also I learned afterwards that  they had been there a while before I perceived them. Perceiving whom,  I arose for salutation, and said: \"Another was with me.\"[29]      [29] Thus according to some texts. The majority, however, add         the words, \"And therefore was I in thought:\" but the shorter         speech is perhaps the more forcible and pathetic.    Afterwards, when they had left me, I set myself again to mine  occupation, to wit, to the drawing figures of angels: in doing which, I  conceived to write of this matter in rhyme, as for her anniversary, and  to address my rhymes unto those who had just left me. It was then that  I wrote the sonnet which saith, \"That lady;\" and as this sonnet hath  two commencements, it behoveth me to divide it with both of them here."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41087"],[0,"Histoire de la Littérature Anglaise (Volume 2 de 5) (#12)"],[1,"ve,    The less I hope.
