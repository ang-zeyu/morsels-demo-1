The  perspiration consists of about ninety-nine parts water, and one part solid  matter. The amount varies greatly, but on the average is, for an adult,  not far from two pounds per day. Any suppression of this constant drainage  will lead to disagreeable and even dangerous results. If it be entirely  and permanently checked, death will inevitably ensue. [Footnote: Once, on  an occasion of great solemnity at Rome, a child was, it is said,  completely covered with gold leaf, closely applied to the skin, so as to  represent, according to the idea of that age, the golden glory of an angel  or seraph. In a few hours, after contributing to this pageant, the child  died; the cause being suffocation, from stopping the exhalation of the  skin; although, in the ignorance of the common people of those days, the  death was attributed to the anger of the Deity, and looked upon as a  circumstance of evil omen.]    THE ABSORBING POWER OF THE SKIN.--We have already described two uses of  the skin: (1) Its _protective_, (2) its _exhaling_, and now we  come to (3) its _absorbing_ power. This is not so noticeable as the  others, and yet it can be illustrated. Persons frequently poison their  hands with the common wood ivy. Contagious diseases are taken by touching  a patient, or even his clothing, especially if there be a crack in the  cuticle. [Footnote: If one is called upon to handle a dead body, it is  well, especially if the person has died of a contagious disease, to rub  the hand with lard or olive oil. Poisonous matter has been fatally  absorbed through the breaking of the cuticle by a hangnail, or a simple  scratch. There is a story that Bonaparte, when a lieutenant of artillery,  in the heat of battle, seized the rammer and worked the gun of an  artilleryman who had fallen. From the wood which the soldier had used,  Bonaparte absorbed a poison that gave him a skin disease, by which he was  annoyed the remainder of his life.] Painters absorb so much lead through  the pores of their hands that they are attacked with colic. [Footnote:  Cosmetics, hair dyes, etc., are exceedingly injurious, not only because  they tend to fill the pores of the skin, but because they often contain  poisonous matters that may be absorbed into the system, especially if they  are in a solution.] Snuff and lard are frequently rubbed on the chest of a  child suffering with the croup, to produce vomiting. It is said that  seamen in want of water drench their clothing in salt spray, when the skin  will absorb enough moisture to quench thirst (see Lymphatic System).    By carefully conducted experiments, it has been found that the skin acts  in the same way as the lungs (see Respiration) in absorbing oxygen from  the air, and giving off carbonic acid to a small but appreciable amount.  Indeed, the skin has not inaptly been styled the third lung. Hence, the  importance of absolute cleanliness and a frequent ablution of the entire  body.    VI. HYGIENE.    HINTS ABOUT WASHING AND BATHING.--The moment of rising from bed is the  proper time for the full wash or bath with which one should commence the  day. The body is then warm, and can endure moderately cold water better  than at any other time; it is relaxed, and needs bracing; and the nerves,  deadened by the night's repose, require a gentle stimulus. If the system  be strong enough to resist the shock, cold water is the most invigorating;  if not, a tepid bath will answer. [Footnote: Many persons have not the  conveniences for a bath. To them, the following plan, which the author has  daily employed for years, is commended. The necessities are: a basin full  of soft water, a mild soap, a large sponge or a piece of flannel, and two  towels--one soft, the other rough. The temperature of the water should  vary with the season of the year--cold in summer and tepid in winter. Rub  quickly the entire body with the wet sponge or flannel. (If more  agreeable, wash and wipe only a part at a time, protecting the rest in  cold weather with portions of clothing.) Dry the skin gently with a soft  towel, and when quite dry, with the rough towel or flesh brush rub the  body briskly four or five minutes till the skin is all aglow. The chest  and abdomen need the principal rubbing. The roughness of the towel should  be accommodated to the condition of the skin. Enough friction, however,  must be given to produce at least a gentle warmth, indicative of the  reaction necessary to prevent subsequent chill or languor. An invalid will  find it exceedingly beneficial if a stout, vigorous person produce the  reaction by rubbing with the hands.]    Before dressing, the whole body should be thoroughly rubbed with a coarse  towel or flesh brush. At first, the friction may be unpleasant, but this  sensitiveness will soon be overcome, and the keenest pleasure be felt in  the lively glow which follows. A bath should not be taken just before nor  immediately after a meal, as it will interfere with the digestion of the  food. Soap should be employed occasionally, but its frequent use tends to  make the skin dry and hard.    REACTION.--After taking a cold bath, there should be a prompt reaction.  When the surface is chilled by cold water, the blood sets to the heart and  other vital organs, exciting them to more vigorous action, and then, being  thrown back to the surface, it reddens, warms, and stimulates the skin to  an unwonted degree. This is called the reaction, and in it lies the  invigorating influence of the cold bath. When, on the contrary, the skin  is heated by a hot bath, the blood is drawn to the surface, less blood  goes to the heart, the circulation decreases, and languor ensues. A dash  of cold water is both necessary and refreshing at the close of a hot bath.  [Footnote: The Russians are very fond of vapor baths, taken in the  following manner. A large room is heated by stoves. Red-hot stones being  brought in, water is thrown upon them, filling the room with steam. The  bathers sit on benches until they perspire profusely, when they are rubbed  with soapsuds and dashed with cold water. Sometimes, while in this state  of excessive perspiration, they run out of doors and leap into snow  banks.]    If, after a cold bath, there be felt no glow of warmth, but only a  chilliness and depression, we are thereby warned that either proper means  were not taken to bring on this reaction, or that the circulation is not  vigorous enough to make such a bath beneficial. The general effect of a  cool bath is exhilarating, and that of a warm one depressing. [Footnote:  The sudden plunge into a cold bath is good for the strong and healthy, but  too severe for the delicate. One should always wet first the face, neck,  and chest. It is extremely injurious to stand in a bath with only the feet  and the lower limbs covered by the water, for the blood is thus sent from  the extremities to the heart and internal organs, and they become so  burdened that reaction may be out of their power. A brisk walk, or a  thorough rubbing of the skin, before a cold bath or swim, adds greatly to  its value and pleasure.] Hence the latter should not ordinarily be taken  oftener than once a week, while the former may be enjoyed daily. (See p.  289.)    SEA BATHING is exceedingly stimulating, on account of the action of the  salt and the exciting surroundings. Twenty minutes is the utmost limit for  bathing or swimming in salt or fresh water. A chilly sensation should be  the signal for instant removal. It is better to leave while the glow and  buoyancy which follow the first plunge are still felt. Gentle exercise  after a bath is beneficial.    CLOTHING in winter, to keep us warm, should repel the external cold and  retain the heat of the body. In summer, to keep us cool, it should not  absorb the rays of the sun, and should permit the passage of the heat of  the body. At all seasons, it should be porous, to give ready escape to the  perspiration, and a free admission of air to the skin. We can readily  apply these essential conditions to the different kinds of clothing.    _Linen_ is soft to the touch, and is a good conductor of heat. Hence  it is pleasant for summer wear, but, being apt to chill the surface too  rapidly, it should not be worn next the skin.    _Cotton_ is a poorer conductor of heat and absorber of moisture, and  is therefore warmer than linen. It is sufficiently cool for summer wear,  and affords better protection against sudden changes.    _Woolen_ absorbs moisture slowly, and contains much air in its pores.  It is therefore a poor conductor of heat, and guards the wearer against  the vicissitudes of our climate.    The outer clothing may be adapted largely to ornament, and may be varied  to suit our fancy and the requirements of society. The underclothing  should always be sufficient to keep us warm. Woolen should be worn next  the skin at all times; light gossamer garments in the heat of summer, and  warm, porous flannels in midwinter.    Light-colored clothing is not only cooler in summer, but warmer in winter.  As the warmth of clothing depends greatly on the amount of air contained  in its fibers, fine, loose, porous cloth with a plenty of nap is best for  winter wear. Firm and heavy goods are not necessarily the warmest. Furs  are the perfection of winter clothing, since they combine warmth with  lightness. Two light woolen garments are warmer than one heavy one, as  there is between them a layer of nonconducting air.    All the body except the head should be equally protected by clothing.  Whatever fashion may dictate, no part covered to-day can be uncovered  tonight or to-morrow, except at the peril of health. It is a most  barbarous and cruel custom to leave the limbs of little children  unprotected, when adults would shiver at the very thought of exposure.  Equally so is it for children to be thinly clad for the purpose of  hardening them.

They told him all that happened with the Chinese and Cambodians  and of the favorable condition of affairs for continuing them, alleging  that, since the usurper Anacaparan was dead, many Cambodians would  immediately join the Spaniards in defense of the name and fame of  Langara their legitimate king. But, although some of the Cambodians  themselves came to visit the fleet, and assured Gallinato of the same,  of the death of Anacaparan, and of the deeds of the Spaniards in  Sistor, he appeared to give no credit to any of them, and could not  be induced to believe them, or to continue the enterprise, or even  to consider it. On the contrary he rebuked the Spaniards for what had  taken place in his absence, and after depriving them of all that they  had seized from the Chinese and Cambodians, put to sea in order to  return to Manila. Belloso and Blas Ruiz persuaded him to go at least  to Cochinchina, where the galley seized when Governor Gomez Perez was  killed was said to have been taken, and where were the royal standard  and the artillery carried aboard the galley, and for which he should  ask. They promised, while Gallinato was making these negotiations,  to go overland to the kingdom of Lao, where Langara, king of Camboja,  was living, in order to restore him to his kingdom. Captain Gallinato  consented to this, and sailed along the coast, until he entered the  bay of Cochinchina, where, although he was apparently well received  by the natives of the country, he would not disembark from his ships,  but sent Gregorio de Vargas from them to visit the king of Tunquin,  the chief king of that kingdom, and to treat with him concerning the  galley, the standard, and the artillery. While he was thus engaged,  Gallinato allowed Blas Ruyz and Diego Belloso to go ashore to endeavor  to make the journey to Lao, for he agreed easily to their request  because he thus got rid of them and left them busied in this matter,  so that they could not do him any ill turn in Manila in regard to  leaving Camboja.    Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz went to the king of Sinua, son of the king  of Tunquin, and begged him to help them in their journey. From him they  received all that was necessary, and were well treated and served until  they reached the city of Alanchan, [53] capital of the kingdom of Lao,  where they were kindly received by the king of the country. They found  that Prauncar Langara, king of Camboja, and his elder son and daughter  had died, and that only his son Prauncar survived, and the latter's  stepmother, grandmother, and aunts. They related the condition of  affairs in Camboja, the arrival of the Spaniards, and the death of  the usurper Anacaparan. The same news was brought by a Cambodian  from Chordemuco, who also added that since the death of Anacaparan,  his younger son Chupinanu was reigning, that the country was entirely  divided into factions, and that many upon seeing their natural and  lawful king would leave Chupinanu and would join him and obey him.    The few difficulties for the departure having been overcome by the  arrival at this time of the mandarin Ocuña de Chu at Lanchan, in Lao  [54] from Camboja, who had been sent by order of other mandarins and  grandees of Camboja with ten praus well equipped with artillery and  weapons to fetch their lawful king, it was decided to go down to  Camboja. Prauncar, his grandmother, aunt, and stepmother--he wife  of Langara--together with Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz, embarked  and journeyed in the said boats and praus down the rivers flowing  from Lao to Camboja. [55] There they found fresh disturbances in the  provinces. But as soon as Prauncar arrived many went over to his side,  especially two Moro Malays, Acuña La Casamana [56] and Cancona, who  were in the country with a Malay army and a quantity of artillery and  elephants. Prauncar was victorious on various occasions, and Chupinanu  with his brothers and other rebels having died in battle, became master  of almost all the provinces of his kingdom. He made Diego Belloso and  Blas Ruyz chiefs in war affairs, and they managed war matters until  they completely established Prauncar on the throne. When the war was  almost entirely ended, the king made Belloso and Blas Ruyz great chofas  [57] of his kingdom, gave them two provinces, and granted them other  favors, although not so many as they expected, or as he had promised  while still in Lao. The chief reason for this was the stepmother,  grandmother, and aunt of the king, who managed him, on account of  his youth, and of his being addicted to wine, in excess even of his  father Langara. The Moro Malay, Acuña Lacasamana, had great influence  with these women. Being envious of the valor of the Spaniards, he was  continually opposing them, and seeking their destruction, with whom,  on this account, they were always at odds. It must be understood  that this Moro held unlawful relations with the wife of Langara,  the stepmother of King Prauncar.    Captain Gallinato's fleet remained in Cochinchina negotiating with  the king of Tunquin for the royal standard and the artillery of the  galley, as above stated, for the galley was lost upon that coast,  and this king had the rest in his possession. The latter not only did  not restore them, but entertaining Gallinato with flattering speech,  was, on the contrary, planning to take from him his ships and their  contents. Gallinato was secretly warned of this by one of the chief  women of Cochinchina, who came to the fleet to see him, after which  he kept a much more careful watch than before, and allowed no one to  go ashore. But this order was of no avail with Fray Alonso Ximenez,  one of the Dominican religious whom he had with him, and the chief  promoter of the expedition. When the latter went ashore, they seized  and kept him there. The Cochinchinese, imagining that the fleet was  off its guard, sent some fire ships against it, followed by some  galleys and warboats, in order to burn it, while many men armed with  arquebuses annoyed the Spaniards from the neighboring shore. The fleet  succeeded in getting away from the fire and put off from shore, and  resisted the enemy's ships with artillery, musketry, and arquebuses,  thus sinking some of them. After this the Spaniards waited no longer,  but leaving Fray Alonso Ximenez on shore, and two lay companions,  whom he took with him, put to sea and left the bay of Cochinchina,  and ran toward the Filipinas.    While these things were happening in Camboja and Cochinchina, orders  had arrived from España from his Majesty to conclude an agreement  that Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa had made with Gomez Perez  Dasmariñas, under which the former was to pacify and settle the island  of Mindanao at his own expense, and receive the governorship of the  island for two lives [58] and other rewards. The said agreement was  effected, after certain difficulties that arose were settled. Don  Estevan Rodriguez prepared men and ships, and what else was necessary  for the enterprise, and with some galleys, galleots, frigates, vireys,  barangays, and lapis, [59] set out with two hundred and fourteen  Spaniards for the island of Mindanao, in February of the same year,  of ninety-six. He took Captain Juan de la Xara as his master-of-camp,  and some religious of the Society of Jesus to give instruction,  as well as many natives for the service of the camp and fleet.    He reached Mindanao River, after a good voyage, where the first  settlements, named Tancapan and Lumaguan, both hostile to the people  of Buhahayen, received him peacefully and in a friendly manner, and  joined his fleet. They were altogether about six thousand men. Without  delay they advanced about eight leguas farther up the river against  Buhahayen, the principal settlement of the island, where its greatest  chief had fortified himself on many sides. Arrived at the settlement,  the fleet cast anchor, and immediately landed a large proportion of  the troops with their arms. But before reaching the houses and fort,  and while going through some thickets [çacatal] [60] near the shore,  they encountered some of the men of Buhahayen, who were coming to  meet them with their campilans, carazas [61] and other weapons, and  who attacked them on various sides. The latter [i.e., the Spaniards  and their allies], on account of the swampiness of the place and  the denseness of the thickets [çacatal], could not act unitedly as  the occasion demanded, although the master-of-camp and the captains  that led them exerted themselves to keep the troops together and  to encourage them to face the natives. Meanwhile Governor Estevan  Rodriguez de Figueroa was watching events from his flagship, but not  being able to endure the confusion of his men, seized his weapons  and hastened ashore with three or four companions, and a servant who  carried his helmet, in order that he might be less impeded in his  movements. But as he was crossing a part of the thickets [çacatal]  where the fight was waging, a hostile Indian stepped out unseen from  one side, and dealt the governor a blow on the head with his campilan,  that stretched him on the ground badly wounded. [62] The governor's  followers cut the Mindanao to pieces and carried the governor back to  the camp. Shortly after, the master-of-camp, Juan de la Xara, withdrew  his troops to the fleet, leaving behind several Spaniards who had  fallen in the encounter. The governor did not regain consciousness,  for the wound was very severe, and died next day. The fleet after that  loss and failure left that place, and descended the river to Tampacan,  where it anchored among the friendly inhabitants and their settlements.    The master-of-camp, Juan de la Xara, had himself chosen by the fleet  as successor in the government and enterprise. He built a fort with  arigues and palms near Tampacan, and founded a Spanish"]]]
