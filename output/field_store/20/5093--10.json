With Cori we enter on the  examination of a long series of towns, whose main feature is their  primaeval walls, and among these Cori has the merit of showing us the  walls that are the most primaeval of all. None of its fellows can show  such blocks as the mysterious engineers, whose work men love to call  Cyclopean, piled together in the lower town of Cori, just outside  what is now the gate of Ninfa. Blocks indeed of equal size we may see  elsewhere, but surely none of equal rudeness. They are heaped together  as they were hewn or torn away from their place in the natural rock;  huge limestone blocks of every size and shape, with the spaces between  them filled up with similar stones of their own kind. But the whole  range of the wall of Cori is not of this primitive sort. The curious  in such matters distinguish five epochs: Cyclopean, Latin, Old Roman,  Roman of Sulla's day, and--the leap is a great one--mediaeval walls  of the time of King Ladislaus; we hardly venture to give an Angevin  king of the hither Sicily the full Slavonic shape which marks him  as sprung from the other side of Hadria. The stones of the first  four--we have already spoken of the first of all--are all polygonal,  of distinguishing degrees of regularity of work and degrees of size.  The rudest wall, as far as we saw, of all is to be found quite at the  bottom; the others may be seen side by side in the great walls of the  _arx_ which soar high above all, and which shelter the chief ornament  of Cori in quite another department.    According to the nearly invariable rule, the _arx_ of Cora contained  a temple, and the temple, as so often happens, has been turned into  a church. But the change has been less destructive to Cori than in  many other places. The house of St. Peter has been built without  damaging the portico of the house of Hercules--the old Latin Herculus  was hopelessly confused with the Herakles of Greek legend--and still  keeps the columns of his portico, both on its front and its sides;  keeps his entablature, his pediment, the gate-way of his _cella_, the  inscription which records the work of the local _duumvirs_, Manlius  and Turpilius. But what shall we say to the columns themselves? They  profess to be Doric, even to be Greek Doric; but they have bases; they  stand as wide apart as Etruscan tradition planted the columns of the  Capitoline Jupiter; the shafts themselves, instead of being as massive  as Paestum, are slenderer than Nemea. But sin against rule as it may,  the upper temple at Cori is still undoubtedly pretty, to say the least,  and it is really all the more interesting because of its sin against  rule. Far finer in themselves are the Corinthian columns--such as are  left--of the temple of the Greek Twin Brethren lower down the hill;  but we can see good Corinthian columns in a great many places; the  peculiarities of the Hercules temple are special to Cori. Do they not  speak of the Hellenizing mind of the great dictator who made Cora rise  again after it had suffered deeply at the hands of his Marian enemies?  Stern restorer of what he deemed Rome's ancient ways, but votary and  favourite of Hellenic gods, the taste of Sulla might well lead him to  some such forms as we see in the object, yet prominent from many points  of view, that crowns the height of the citadel of Cora.    But we have not gone through the full tale of the antiquities of  this strange little mountain-city. Outside the Ninfa gate, spanning  at a vast height the deep gorge which on that side forms the foss  of Cori, rises a bridge, of days which we call ancient, but which we  are tempted to call modern so near to the Cyclopean wall. Not a few  fragments of columns may be marked here and there in the streets. We  light too on inscriptions. Besides the _duumvirs_--one might call them  the bailiffs--of the Roman Municipium, whose names are carved on the  frieze of Hercules, another commemorates two _Praitors_; surely these,  with their archaic spelling, are the abiding magistrates of the Latin  Commonwealth--as Cicero's Milo was dictator of Lanuvium--dependent on  Rome, but not fully incorporated in her substance. Then, besides the  chief temple, other Pagan buildings and objects have been turned to  Christian uses. In the church where St. Peter has supplanted Hercules,  an altar, if altar it be, bearing rams with horns and the Gorgon's  head, has been hollowed out to make a baptismal font. The church of St.  Oliva bears a dedication dating only from the sixteenth century; but it  is a lovely cloister of that better kind of _Renaissance_ which was in  truth only a falling back on Romanesque. In the church are memorials  of earlier times, classical columns used again, fitted some of them  with capitals of the very rudest Romanesque, whose fellows may be  found in Worcester and at Hildesheim. Altogether Cori is emphatically a  place for a visit. But a word of warning must be given. Cori and Norba  cannot be combined so as to see both worthily in a single day. Let the  traveller either make two distinct outings from Velletri, or let him  take his chance of sleeping at Cori; it may not be a worse chance than  sleeping at Frosinone, where sleep may be had. Then let him rise up  early in the morning and saddle his ass, or, if able-bodied, let him  rather make his way on his own feet along the mountain-path to Norba.          Norba.      We will suppose that, the mutual curiosity of natives and strangers  having been fully gratified at Cori, the strangers have set out on  their way, on mule-back or otherwise. The mountain-track up and down,  skirting the lower heights of the Volscian range, opens noble views  of the higher mountains inland, of the wide flat below, and of the sea  beyond. But these views are perhaps, on the whole, better enjoyed when  the traveller has found a firm foothold within \"Norba's ancient wall\"  than while he has personal experience how         The patient ass, up flinty paths,         Plods with his weary load.    Still worse indeed is it when the flinty paths have to be plodded  down, and when the weary load needs all his theoretical philosophy  to persuade him how thoroughly safe he really is, while the weakness  of the flesh surrounds the descent with terrors which he knows to  be unreal. At last the ancient wall rises immediately before him;  the hill-side, a small height straight above the path, is climbed on  his own feet, and he can presently contemplate at his ease both the  wall itself and the prospect which it commands. The last part of the  ass-track has become so like a lane anywhere else that we are amazed  when we reach the other side of the immediate height of Norba, and find  how far below lies the plain from which the almost perpendicular cliffs  spring to bear up the forsaken city. For at Norba the curiosity will  be almost wholly on the side of the stranger; in cannot be returned in  kind, as at Cori; a lone shepherd or two may come to look at him; he  cannot bring together the least approach to a triumphal procession.  For within the wall all is, we cannot say desolate or forsaken, for  the crops are there, full and green--\"_segetes, ubi Norba fuit_\"--but  the ancient circuit is at least empty of all dwelling-places of man.  We would fain believe that the space has stood as empty as it now  does ever since the people of Norba--less wise, as the event showed,  than their neighbours of Cora--embraced the cause of Marius with such  desperate zeal that they slew themselves and burned their houses rather  than let either themselves or their goods fall into the hands of Sulla.  This inference might possibly be rash; for the ancient wall fences in  at least one ruin which may be later than the days of the fortunate  dictator. But it is clear that Norba, if it recovered from this great  single blow, gradually dwindled away, to the profit, first of Norma  by its side, which still abides, and of Ninfa, at its foot, which has  perished only less utterly than Norba itself.    Cori and Norba are alike cities set on hills, and neither of them has  any fear of being hid. But they are set on hills in different senses.  Cori occupies the upper part of the sloping hill, and the houses spread  down the slope. Norba occupies a large table-land on the edge of the  mountains, and its outer wall is carried along the upper rim of a  steep and lofty cliff. No dwellings could ever have spread themselves  downwards on the side which looks toward the marshes and the sea.  But we should hardly have said the outer wall; for the height was so  carefully fortified that outlying defences were placed at various  points on the side of the cliff wherever the primitive engineers  deemed such defences needful. Within the circuit, again, the _arx_  rose on several terraces; its highest point--crowned, we may believe,  as usual, by a temple--must have formed a proud object indeed from the  vast extent of land and sea which it looks down upon. No other of its  ancient neighbours looks down so immediately on the great Pomptine  flat as Norba does, as none looks down from so great a height. Cori  rather occupies a hill thrown out in front of the mountain; Norba sits  on the edge of the mountain itself, though of course at a much lower  elevation than the huge masses further inland. The towers and temples  of the city must have had a wonderful effect from the lands below; as  it is, there is nothing to mark the place but the line of wall itself,  which does not always stand out in a very marked way from the cliff.  It is then perhaps in some sort well that the later Norma has taken  the place of Norba. On the hill of Norba we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],[0,"\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#12)"],[1," the Jewish and heathen, and the  heathen and Jewish view of life has, too, exerted an influence on  the Christian.  And Christianity, as the living force, has gained  more and more upon the extinct Judaism and heathenism, and has  grown continually clearer and clearer, as it freed itself from the  admixture of falsehood which had overlaid it.  Men went further  and further in the attainment of the meaning of Christianity, and  realized it more and more in life.    The longer mankind lived, the clearer and clearer became the  meaning of Christianity, as must always be the case with every  theory of life.    Succeeding generations corrected the errors of their predecessors,  and grew ever nearer and nearer to a comprehension of the true  meaning.  It was thus from the very earliest times of  Christianity.  And so, too, from the earliest times of  Christianity there were men who began to assert on their own  authority that the meaning they attribute to the doctrine is the  only true one, and as proof bring forward supernatural occurrences  in support of the correctness of their interpretation.    This was the principal cause at first of the misunderstanding of  the doctrine, and afterward of the complete distortion of it.    It was supposed that Christ's teaching was transmitted to men not  like every other truth, but in a special miraculous way.  Thus the  truth of the teaching was not proved by its correspondence with  the needs of the mind and the whole nature of man, but by the  miraculous manner of its transmission, which was advanced as an  irrefutable proof of the truth of the interpretation put on it.  This hypothesis originated from misunderstanding of the teaching,  and its result was to make it impossible to understand it rightly.    And this happened first in the earliest times, when the doctrine  was still not so fully understood and often interpreted wrongly,  as we see by the Gospels and the Acts.  The less the doctrine was  understood, the more obscure it appeared and the more necessary  were external proofs of its truth.  The proposition that we ought  not to do unto others as we would not they should do unto us, did  not need to be proved by miracles and needed no exercise of faith,  because this proposition is in itself convincing and in harmony  with man's mind and nature; but the proposition that Christ was  God had to be proved by miracles completely beyond our  comprehension.    The more the understanding of Christ's teaching was obscured, the  more the miraculous was introduced into it; and the more the  miraculous was introduced into it, the more the doctrine was  strained from its meaning and the more obscure it became; and the  more it was strained from its meaning and the more obscure it  became, the more strongly its infallibility had to be asserted,  and the less comprehensible the doctrine became.    One can see by the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles how from  the earliest times the non-comprehension of the doctrine called  forth the need for proofs through the miraculous and  incomprehensible.    The first example in the book of Acts is the assembly which  gathered together in Jerusalem to decide the question which had  arisen, whether to baptize or not the uncircumcised and those who  had eaten of food sacrificed to idols.    The very fact of this question being raised showed that  those who discussed it did not understand the teaching of Christ,  who rejected all outward observances--ablutions, purifications,  fasts, and sabbaths.  It was plainly said, \"Not that which goeth  into a man's mouth, but that which cometh out of a man's mouth,  defileth him,\" and therefore the question of baptizing the  uncircumcised could only have arisen among men who, though they  loved their Master and dimly felt the grandeur of his teaching,  still did not understand the teaching itself very clearly. And  this was the fact.    Just in proportion to the failure of the members of the assembly  to understand the doctrine was their need of external confirmation  of their incomplete interpretation of it.  And then to settle this  question, the very asking of which proved their misunderstanding  of the doctrine, there was uttered in this assembly, as is  described in the Acts, that strange phrase, which was for the  first time found necessary to give external confirmation to  certain assertions, and which has been productive of so much evil.    That is, it was asserted that the correctness of what they had  decided was guaranteed by the miraculous participation of the Holy  Ghost, that is, of God, in their decision.  But the assertion that  the Holy Ghost, that is, God, spoke through the Apostles, in its  turn wanted proof.  And thus it was necessary, to confirm this,  that the Holy Ghost should descend at Pentecost in tongues of fire  upon those who made this assertion.  (In the account of it, the  descent of the Holy Ghost precedes the assembly, but the book of  Acts was written much later than both events.)  But the descent of  the Holy Ghost too had to be proved for those who had not seen the  tongues of fire (though it is not easy to understand why a tongue  of fire burning above a man's head should prove that what that man  is going to say will be infallibly the truth).  And so arose the  necessity for still more miracles and changes, raisings of the  dead to life, and strikings of the living dead, and all those  marvels which have been a stumbling-block to men, of which the  Acts is full, and which, far from ever convincing one of the truth  of the Christian doctrine, can only repel men from it.  The result  of such a means of confirming the truth was that the more these  confirmations of truth by tales of miracles were heaped up one  after another, the more the doctrine was distorted from its  original meaning, aid the more incomprehensible it became.    Thus it was from the earliest times, and so it went on, constantly  increasing, till it reached in our day the logical climax of the dogmas  of transubstantiation and the infallibility of the Pope, or of the  bishops, or of Scripture, and of requiring a blind faith rendered  incomprehensible and utterly meaningless, not in God, but in Christ, not  in a doctrine, but in a person, as in Catholicism, or in persons, as in  Greek Orthodoxy, or in a book, as in Protestantism. The more widely  Christianity was diffused, and the greater the number of people  unprepared for it who were brought under its sway, the less it was  understood, the more absolutely was its infallibility insisted on, and  the less possible it became to understand the true meaning of the  doctrine. In the times of Constantine the whole interpretation of the  doctrine had been already reduced to a RESUME--supported by the temporal  authority--of the disputes that had taken place in the Council--to a  creed which reckoned off--I believe in so and so, and so and so, and so  and so to the end--to one holy, Apostolic Church, which means the  infallibility of those persons who call themselves the Church. So that  it all amounts to a man no longer believing in God nor Christ, as they  are revealed to him, but believing in what the Church orders him to  believe in.    But the Church is holy; the Church was founded by Christ.  God  could not leave men to interpret his teaching at random--therefore  he founded the Church.  All those statements are so utterly untrue  and unfounded that one is ashamed to refute them.  Nowhere nor in  anything, except in the assertion of the Church, can we find that  God or Christ founded anything like what Churchmen understand by  the Church.  In the Gospels there is a warning against the Church,  as it is an external authority, a warning most clear and obvious  in the passage where it is said that Christ's followers should  \"call no man master.\"  But nowhere is anything said of the  foundation of what Churchmen call the Church.    The word church is used twice in the Gospels--once in the sense of  an assembly of men to decide a dispute, the other time in  connection with the obscure utterance about a stone--Peter, and  the gates of hell.  From these two passages in which the word  church is used, in the signification merely of an assembly, has  been deduced all that we now understand by the Church.    But Christ could not have founded the Church, that is, what we now  understand by that word.  For nothing like the idea of the Church  as we know it now, with its sacraments, miracles, and above all  its claim to infallibility, is to be found either in Christ's  words or in the ideas of the men of that time.    The fact that men called what was formed afterward by the same  word as Christ used for something totally different, does not give  them the right to assert that Christ founded the one, true Church.    Besides, if Christ had really founded such an institution as the  Church for the foundation of all his teaching and the whole faith,  he would certainly have described this institution clearly and  definitely, and would have given the only true Church, besides  tales of miracles, which are used to support every kind of  superstition, some tokens so unmistakable that no doubt of its  genuineness could ever have arisen.  But nothing of the sort was  done by him.  And there have been and still are different  institutions, each calling itself the true Church.    The Catholic catechism says: \"L'Eglise est la societe des fideles  etablie par notre Seigneur Jesus Christ, repandue sur toute la  terre et soumise a l'authorite des pasteurs legitimes,  principalement notre Saint Pere le Pape,\" [see Footnote]  understanding by the words \"pasteurs legitimes\" an association of  men having the Pope at its head, and consisting of certain  individuals bound together by a certain organization.
