The Process for \"Re-Reviewing\" Web Pages  After Their Initial Categorization  Most filtering software companies do not engage in  subsequent reviews of categorized sites or pages on a scheduled  basis.  Priority is placed on reviewing and categorizing new  sites and pages, rather than on re-reviewing already categorized  sites and pages.  Typically, a filtering software vendor's  previous categorization of a Web site is not re-reviewed for  accuracy when new pages are added to the Web site.  To the extent  the Web site was previously categorized as a whole, the new pages  added to the site usually share the categorization assigned by  the blocking product vendor.  This necessarily results in both  over- and underblocking, because, as noted above, the content of  Web pages and Web sites changes relatively rapidly.      In addition to the content on Web sites or pages changing  rapidly, Web sites themselves may disappear and be replaced by  sites with entirely different content.  If an IP address  associated with a particular Web site is blocked under a  particular category and the Web site goes out of existence, then  the IP address likely would be reassigned to a different Web  site, either by an Internet service provider or by a registration  organization, such as the American Registry for Internet Numbers,  see http://www.arin.net.  In that case, the site that received  the reassigned IP address would likely be miscategorized.  Because filtering companies do not engage in systematic re-review  of their category lists, such a site would likely remain  miscategorized unless someone submitted it to the filtering  company for re-review, increasing the incidence of over- and  underblocking.  This failure to re-review Web pages primarily increases a  filtering company's rate of overblocking.  However, if a  filtering company does not re-review Web pages after it  determines that they do not fall into any of its blocking  categories, then that would result in underblocking (because, for  example, a page might add sexually explicit content).  3.        The Inherent Tradeoff Between Overblocking and  Underblocking      There is an inherent tradeoff between any filter's rate of  overblocking (which information scientists also call \"precision\")  and its rate of underblocking (which is also referred to as  \"recall\").  The rate of overblocking or precision is measured by  the proportion of the things a classification system assigns to a  certain category that are appropriately classified.  The  plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Nunberg, provided the hypothetical  example of a classification system that is asked to pick out  pictures of dogs from a database consisting of 1000 pictures of  animals, of which 80 were actually dogs.  If it returned 100  hits, of which 80 were in fact pictures of dogs, and the  remaining 20 were pictures of cats, horses, and deer, we would  say that the system identified dog pictures with a precision of  80%.  This would be analogous to a filter that overblocked at a  rate of 20%.  The recall measure involves determining what proportion of  the actual members of a category the classification system has  been able to identify.  For example, if the hypothetical animal-  picture database contained a total of 200 pictures of dogs, and  the system identified 80 of them and failed to identify 120, it  would have performed with a recall of 40%.  This would be  analogous to a filter that underblocked 60% of the material in a  category.  In automated classification systems, there is always a  tradeoff between precision and recall.  In the animal-picture  example, the recall could be improved by using a looser set of  criteria to identify the dog pictures in the set, such as any  animal with four legs, and all the dogs would be identified, but  cats and other animals would also be included, with a resulting  loss of precision.  The same tradeoff exists between rates of  overblocking and underblocking in filtering systems that use  automated classification systems.  For example, an automated  system that classifies any Web page that contains the word \"sex\"  as sexually explicit will underblock much less, but overblock  much more, than a system that classifies any Web page containing  the phrase \"free pictures of people having sex\" as sexually  explicit.      This tradeoff between overblocking and underblocking also  applies not just to automated classification systems, but also to  filters that use only human review.  Given the approximately two  billion pages that exist on the Web, the 1.5 million new pages  that are added daily, and the rate at which content on existing  pages changes, if a filtering company blocks only those Web pages  that have been reviewed by humans, it will be impossible, as a  practical matter, to avoid vast amounts of underblocking.  Techniques used by human reviewers such as blocking at the IP  address level, domain name level, or directory level reduce the  rates of underblocking, but necessarily increase the rates of  overblocking, as discussed above.  To use a simple example, it would be easy to design a filter  intended to block sexually explicit speech that completely avoids  overblocking.  Such a filter would have only a single sexually  explicit Web site on its control list, which could be re-reviewed  daily to ensure that its content does not change.  While there  would be no overblocking problem with such a filter, such a  filter would have a severe underblocking problem, as it would  fail to block all the sexually explicit speech on the Web other  than the one site on its control list.  Similarly, it would also  be easy to design a filter intended to block sexually explicit  speech that completely avoids underblocking.  Such a filter would  operate by permitting users to view only a single Web site, e.g.,  the Sesame Street Web site.  While there would be no  underblocking problem with such a filter, it would have a severe  overblocking problem, as it would block access to millions of  non-sexually explicit sites on the Web other than the Sesame  Street site.      While it is thus quite simple to design a filter that does  not overblock, and equally simple to design a filter that does  not underblock, it is currently impossible, given the Internet's  size, rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given  the state of the art of automated classification systems, to  develop a filter that neither underblocks nor overblocks a  substantial amount of speech.  The more effective a filter is at  blocking Web sites in a given category, the more the filter will  necessarily overblock.  Any filter that is reasonably effective  in preventing users from accessing sexually explicit content on  the Web will necessarily block substantial amounts of non-  sexually explicit speech.  4.        Attempts to Quantify Filtering Programs' Rates  of Over- and Underblocking  The government presented three studies, two from expert  witnesses, and one from a librarian fact witness who conducted a  study using Internet use logs from his own library, that attempt  to quantify the over- and underblocking rates of five different  filtering programs.  The plaintiffs presented one expert witness  who attempted to quantify the rates of over- and underblocking  for various programs.  Each of these attempts to quantify rates  of over- and underblocking suffers from various methodological  flaws.      The fundamental problem with calculating over- and  underblocking rates is selecting a universe of Web sites or Web  pages to serve as the set to be tested.  The studies that the  parties submitted in this case took two different approaches to  this problem.  Two of the studies, one prepared by the  plaintiffs' expert witness Chris Hunter, a graduate student at  the University of Pennsylvania, and the other prepared by the  defendants' expert, Chris Lemmons of eTesting Laboratories, in  Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, approached this problem  by compiling two separate lists of Web sites, one of URLs that  they deemed should be blocked according to the filters' criteria,  and another of URLs that they deemed should not be blocked  according to the filters' criteria.  They compiled these lists by  choosing Web sites from the results of certain key word  searches.   The problem with this selection method is that it is  neither random, nor does it necessarily approximate the universe  of Web pages that library patrons visit.      The two other studies, one by David Biek, head librarian at  the Tacoma Public Library's main branch, and one by Cory Finnell  of Certus Consulting Group, of Seattle, Washington, chose actual  logs of Web pages visited by library patrons during specific time  periods as the universe of Web pages to analyze.  This method,  while surely not as accurate as a truly random sample of the  indexed Web would be (assuming it would be possible to take such  a sample), has the virtue of using the actual Web sites that  library patrons visited during a specific period.  Because  library patrons selected the universe of Web sites that Biek and  Finnell's studies analyzed, this removes the possibility of bias  resulting from the study author's selection of the universe of  sites to be reviewed.  We find that the Lemmons and Hunter  studies are of little probative value because of the methodology  used to select the sample universe of Web sites to be tested.  We  will therefore focus on the studies conducted by Finnell and Biek  in trying to ascertain estimates of the rates of over- and  underblocking that takes place when filters are used in public  libraries.  The government hired expert witness Cory Finnell to study  the Internet logs compiled by the public libraries systems in  Tacoma, Washington; Westerville, Ohio; and Greenville, South  Carolina.  Each of these libraries uses filtering software that  keeps a log of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5183"],[0,"The Unexpurgated Case Against Woman Suffrage (#12)"],[1,"this outermost fence would be civilised war--for  in civilised war non-combatants and prisoners and wounded are excluded  from the application of violence. In like manner we bring humanity in  general within a more sheltered enclosure than animals--pet animals  within a more sheltered enclosure than other animals. Again, we bring  those who belong to the white race within a narrower protecting circle  than mankind in general, and those of our own nation within a still  narrower one.    Following out the same principle, we include women and children within  a narrower shelter fence than our adult fellow-male; and we use the  weapon of force more reluctantly when we are dealing with our  relatives and friends than when we are dealing with those who are not  personally known to us; and finally, we lay it aside more completely  when we are dealing with the women of our households than when we are  dealing with the males.    The cause of civilisation and of the amenities, and the welfare of the  nation, of the family, and of woman, are all intimately bound up with  a faithful adherence to this compromise.    But this policy imposes upon those whom it shelters from violence  corresponding obligations.    In war non-combatants--not to speak of the wounded on the  battlefield--must desist from hostile action on the pain of being shot  down like wild beasts. And though an individual non-combatant might  think it a patriotic action for him to take part in war, the  thoughtful man would recognise that such action was a violation of a  well-understood covenant made in the interest of civilisation, and  that to break through this covenant was to abrogate a humanitarian  arrangement by which the general body of non-combatants immensely  benefits.    Exactly the same principle finds, as already pointed out, application  when a woman employs direct violence, or aspires to exercise by voting  indirect violence.    One always wonders if the suffragist appreciates all that woman stands  to lose and all that she imperils by resort to physical force. One  ought not to have to tell her that, if she had to fight for her  position, her status would be that which is assigned to her among the  Kaffirs--not that which civilised man concedes to her.    From considering the compromise by which man adapts his dual nature to  violence in the world, we turn to that which the female legislative  reformer would seek to impose by the aid of her vote.    Her proposal, as the reader will have discerned, would be that all  those evils which make appeal to the feminine emotions should be  legally prohibited, and that all those which fail to make this appeal  shall be tolerated.    In the former class would be included those which come directly under  woman's ken, or have been brought vividly before the eyes of her  imagination by emotional description. And the specially intolerable  evils will be those which, owing to the fact that they fall upon woman  or her immediate belongings, induce in the female legislative reformer  pangs of sympathetic discomfort.    In the class of evils which the suffragist is content to tolerate, or  say nothing about, would be those which are incapable of evoking in  her such sympathetic pangs, and she concerns herself very little with  those evils which do not furnish her with a text for recriminations  against man.    Conspicuous in this programme is the absence of any sense of  proportion. One would have imagined that it would have been plain to  everybody that the evils which individual women suffer at the hands of  man are very far from being the most serious ills of humanity. One  would have imagined that the suffering inflicted by disease and by bad  social conditions--suffering which falls upon man and woman  alike--deserved a first place in the thoughts of every reformer. And  one might have expected it to be common knowledge that the wrongs  individual men inflict upon women have a full counterpart in the  wrongs which individual women inflict upon men. It may quite well be  that there are mists which here \"blot and fill the perspective\" of the  female legislative reformer. But to look only upon one's own things,  and not also upon the things of others, is not for that morally  innocent.    There is further to be noted in connexion with the female legislative  reformer that she has never been able to see why she should be  required to put her aspirations into practical shape, or to consider  ways and means, or to submit the practicability of her schemes to  expert opinion. One also recognises that from a purely human point of  view such tactics are judicious. For if the schemes of the female  legislative reformer were once to be reviewed from the point of view  of their practicability, her utility as a legislator would come into  question, and the suffragist could no longer give out that there has  been committed to her from on High a mission to draw water for  man-kind out of the wells of salvation.    Lastly, we have to reflect in connection with the female legislative  reformer that to go about proposing to reform the laws means to  abandon that special field of usefulness which lies open to woman in  alleviating misery and redressing those hard cases which will, under  all laws and regulations of human manufacture and under all social  dispositions, inevitably occur. Now when a woman leaves a social task  which is commensurate with her abilities, and which asks from her  personal effort and self-sacrifice, for a task which is quite beyond  her abilities, but which, she thinks, will bring her personal kudos,  shall we impute it to her for righteousness?      V    ULTERIOR ENDS WHICH THE WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT HAS IN VIEW    We have now sufficiently considered the suffragist's humanitarian  schemes, and we may lead up to the consideration of her further  projects by contrasting woman's suffrage as it presents itself under  colonial conditions--_i.e._ woman's suffrage without the female  legislative reformer and the feminist--with the woman suffrage which  is being agitated for in England--_i.e._ woman suffrage with the  female legislative reformer and the feminist.    In the colonies and undeveloped countries generally where women are in  a minority, and where owing to the fact that practically all have an  opportunity of marrying, there are not for woman any difficult  economic and physiological conditions, there is no woman's question;  and by consequence no female legislative reformer or feminist. The  woman voter follows, as the opportunist politicians who enfranchised  her intended, the lead of her men-folk--serving only a pawn in the  game of politics. Under such conditions woman's suffrage kleaves  things as they are, except only that it undermines the logical  foundations of the law, and still further debases the standard of  public efficiency and public morality.    In countries, such as England, where an excess female population [1]  has made economic difficulties for woman, and where the severe sexual  restrictions, which here obtains, have bred in her sex-hostility, the  suffrage movement has as its avowed ulterior object the abrogation of  all distinctions which depend upon sex; and the achievement of the  economic independence of woman.    [1] In England and Wales there are, in a population of 8,000,000 women  between the ages of twenty and fifty, 3,000,000 unmarried women.    To secure this economic independence every post, occupation, and  Government service is to be thrown open to woman; she is to receive  everywhere the same wages as man; male and female are to work side by  side; and they are indiscriminately to be put in command the one over  the other.  Furthermore, legal rights are to be secured to the wife over  her husband's property and earnings. The programme is, in fact, to give  to woman an economic independence out of the earnings and taxes of man.    Nor does feminist ambition stop short here. It demands that women  shall be included in every advisory committee, every governing board,  every jury, every judicial bench, every electorate, every parliament,  and every ministerial cabinet; further, that every masculine  foundation, university, school of learning, academy, trade union,  professional corporation and scientific society shall be converted  into an epicene institution--until we shall have everywhere one vast  cock-and-hen show.    The proposal to bring man and woman together everywhere into extremely  intimate relationships raises very grave questions. It brings up,  first, the question of sexual complications; secondly, the question as  to whether the tradition of modesty and reticence between the sexes is  to be definitely sacrificed; and, most important of all, the question  as to whether epicene conditions would place obstacles in the way of  intellectual work.    Of these issues the feminist puts the first two quite out of account.  I have already elsewhere said my say upon these matters.[1] With regard  to the third, the feminist either fails to realise that purely  intellectual intercourse--as distinguished from an intercommunion of  mental images--with woman is to a large section of men repugnant; or  else, perceiving this, she makes up her mind that, this  notwithstanding, she will get her way by denouncing the man who does  not welcome her as _selfish_; and by insisting that under feminism  (the quotation is from Mill, the italics which question his sincerity  are mine) \"the mass of mental faculties available for the higher service  of mankind would be _doubled_.\"    [1] _Vide_ Appendix, pp. 169-173.    The matter cannot so lightly be disposed of. It will be necessary for  us to find out whether really intimate association with woman on the  purely intellectual plane is realisable. And if it is, in fact,  unrealisable, it will be necessary to consider whether it is the  exclusion of women from masculine corporations; or the perpetual  attempt of women "]]]
