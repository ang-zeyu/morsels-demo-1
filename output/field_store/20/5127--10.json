If this is a sample of the wilds of  Honduras, give me the tameness of Shopton.\"    \"Oh, we've gone through with worse than this,\" laughed Tom.  \"It's all  in the day's work.  We've only got started.  I guess we're a bit soft,  Ned, though we had hard enough work in that tunnel-digging.\"    After breakfast, while the Indians were making ready the canoes,  Professor Bumper, who, in a previous visit to Central America, had  become interested in the subject, made a brief examination of some of  the dead bats.  They were exceptionally large, some almost as big as  hawks, and were of the sub-family _Desmodidae_, the scientist said.    \"This is a true blood-sucking bat,\" went on the professor.  \"This,\" and  he pointed to the nose-leaves, \"is the sucking apparatus.  The bat  makes an opening in the skin with its sharp teeth and proceeds to  extract the blood.  I can well believe two or three of them, attacking  a steer or mule at once, could soon weaken it so the animal would die.\"    \"And a man, too?\" asked Ned.    \"Well a man has hands with which to use weapons, but a helpless  quadruped has not.  Though if a sufficient number of these bats  attacked a man at the same time, he would have small chance to escape  alive.  Their bites, too, may be poisonous for all I know.\"    The Indians seemed glad to leave the \"place of the bats,\" as they  called the camp site.  Jacinto explained that the Indians believed a  vampire could kill them while they slept, and they were very much  afraid of the blood-sucking bats.  There were many other species in the  tropics, Professor Bumper explained, most of which lived on fruit or on  insects they caught.  The blood-sucking bats were comparatively few,  and the migratory sort fewer still.    \"Well, we're on our way once more,\" remarked Tom as again they were in  the canoes being paddled up the river.  \"How much longer does your  water trip take, Professor?\"    \"I hardly know,\" and Professor Bumper looked to Jacinto to answer.    \"We go two more days in the canoes,\" the guide answered, \"and then we  shall find the mules waiting for us at a place called Hidjio.  From  then on we travel by land until--well until you get to the place where  you are going.    \"I suppose you know where it is?\" he added, nodding toward the  professor.  \"I am leaving that part to you.\"    \"Oh, I have a map, showing where I want to begin some excavations,\" was  the answer.  \"We must first go to Copan and see what arrangements we  can make for laborers.  After that--well, we shall trust to luck for  what we shall find.\"    \"There are said to be many curious things,\" went on Jacinto, speaking  as though he had no interest.  \"You have mentioned buried cities.  Have  you thought what may be in them--great heathen temples, idols, perhaps?\"    For a moment none of the professor's companions spoke.  It was as  though Jacinto had tried to get some information.  Finally the  scientist said:    \"Oh, yes, we may find an idol.  I understand the ancient people, who  were here long before the Spaniards came, worshiped idols.  But we  shall take whatever antiquities we find.\"    \"Huh!\" grunted Jacinto, and then he called to the paddlers to increase  their strokes.    The journey up the river was not very eventful.  Many alligators were  seen, and Tom and Ned shot several with the electric rifle.  Toward the  close of the third day's travel there was a cry from one of the rear  boats, and an alarm of a man having fallen overboard was given.    Tom turned in time to see the poor fellow's struggles, and at the same  time there was a swirl in the water and a black object shot forward.    \"An alligator is after him!\" yelled Ned.    \"I see,\" observed Tom calmly.  \"Hand me the rifle, Ned.\"    Tom took quick aim and pulled the trigger.  The explosive electric  bullet went true to its mark, and the great animal turned over in a  death struggle.  But the river was filled with them, and no sooner had  the one nearest the unfortunate Indian been disposed of than another  made a dash for the man.    There was a wild scream of agony and then a dark arm shot up above the  red foam.  The waters seethed and bubbled as the alligators fought  under it for possession of the paddler.  Tom fired bullet after bullet  from his wonderful rifle into the spot, but though he killed some of  the alligators this did not save the man's life.  His body was not seen  again, though search was made for it.    The accident cast a little damper over the party, and there was a  feeling of gloom among the Indians.  Professor Bumper announced that he  would see to it that the man's family did not want, and this seemed to  give general satisfaction, especially to a brother who was with the  party.    Aside from being caught in a drenching storm and one or two minor  accidents, nothing else of moment marked the remainder of the river  journey, and at the end of the third day the canoes pulled to shore and  a night camp was made.    \"But where are the mules we are to use in traveling to-morrow?\" asked  the professor of Jacinto.    \"In the next village.  We shall march there in the morning.  No use to  go there at night when all is dark.\"    \"I suppose that is so.\"    The Indians made camp as usual, the goods being brought from the canoes  and piled up near the tents.  Then night settled down.    \"Hello!\" cried Tom, awakening the next morning to find the sun  streaming into his tent.  \"We must have overslept, Ned.  We were to  start before old Sol got in his heavy work, but we haven't had  breakfast yet.\"    \"I didn't hear any one call us,\" remarked Ned.    \"Nor I.  Wonder if we're the only lazy birds.\" He looked from the tent  in time to see Mr. Damon and the professor emerging.  Then Tom noticed  something queer.  The canoes were not on the river bank.  There was not  an Indian in sight, and no evidence of Jacinto.    \"What's the matter?\" asked the young inventor.  \"Have the others gone  on ahead?\"    \"I rather think they've gone back,\" was the professor's dry comment.    \"Gone back?\"    \"Yes.  The Indians seem to have deserted us at the ending of this stage  of our journey.\"    \"Bless my time-table!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"You don't say so! What does  it mean?  What has becomes of our friend Jacinto?\"    \"I'm afraid he was rather a false friend,\" was the professor's answer.  \"This is the note he left.  He has gone and taken the canoes and all  the Indians with him,\" and he held out a paper on which was some  scribbled writing.          CHAPTER XIII    FORWARD AGAIN      \"What does it all mean?\" asked Tom, seeing that the note was written in  Spanish, a tongue which he could speak slightly but read indifferently.    \"This is some of Beecher's work,\" was Professor Bumper's grim comment.  \"It seems that Jacinto was in his pay.\"    \"In his pay!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"Do you mean that Beecher deliberately  hired Jacinto to betray us?\"    \"Well, no.  Not that exactly.  Here, I'll translate this note for you,\"  and the professor proceeded to read:      \"Senors: I greatly regret the step I have to take, but I am a  gentleman, and, having given my word, I must keep it.  No harm shall  come to you, I swear it on my honor!\"      \"Queer idea of honor he has!\" commented Tom, grimly.    Professor Bumper read on:      \"Know then, that before I engaged myself to you I had been engaged by  Professor Beecher through a friend to guide him into the Copan valley,  where he wants to make some explorations, for what I know not, save  maybe that it is for gold.  I agreed, in case any rival expeditions  came to lead them astray if I could.    \"So, knowing from what you said that you were going to this place, I  engaged myself to you, planning to do what I have done.  I greatly  regret it, as I have come to like you, but I had given my promise to  Professor Beecher's friend, that I would first lead him to the Copan  valley, and would keep others away until he had had a chance to do his  exploration.    \"So I have led you to this wilderness.  It is far from the Copan, but  you are near an Indian village, and you will be able to get help in a  week or so.  In the meanwhile you will not starve, as you have plenty  of supplies.  If you will travel northeast you will come again to  Puerto Cortes in due season.  As for the money I had from you, I  deposit it to your credit, Professor Beecher having made me an  allowance for steering rival parties on the wrong trail.  So I lose  nothing, and I save my honor.    \"I write this note as I am leaving in the night with the Indians.  I  put some harmless sedative in your tea that you might sleep soundly,  and not awaken until we were well on our way.  Do not try to follow us,  as the river will carry us swiftly away.  And, let me add, there is no  personal animosity on the part of Professor Beecher against you.  I  should have done to any rival expedition the same as I have done with  you.    JACINTO.\"      For a moment there was silence, and then Tom Swift burst out with:    \"Well, of all the mean, contemptible tricks of a human skunk this is  the limit!\"    \"Bless my hairbrush, but he is a scoundrel!\" ejaculated Mr. Damon, with  great warmth.    \"I'd like to start after him the biggest alligator in the river,\" was  Ned's comment.    Professor Bumper said nothing for several seconds.  There was a strange  look on his face, and then he laughed shortly, as though the humor of  the situation appealed to him.    \"Professor Beecher has more gumption than I gave him credit for,\" he  said.  \"It was a clever trick!\"    \"Trick!\" cried Tom.    \"Yes.  I can't exactly agree that it was the right thing to do, but he,  or some friend acting for him, seems to have taken precautions that we  are not to suffer or lose money.  Beecher goes on the theory that all  is fair in love and war, I suppose, and he may call this a sort of  scientific war.\"    Ned wondered, as he looked at his chum, how much love there was in it.  Clearly Beecher"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5000"],[0,"The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (#12)"],[1,"is extended to a spot which is  smaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye; and this second  perspective [= pyramid] results from the first.    90.    SIMPLE PERSPECTIVE.    Simple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical  plane which is equally distant from the eye in every part. Complex  perspective is that which is constructed on a ground-plan in which  none of the parts are equally distant from the eye.    91.    PERSPECTIVE.    No surface can be seen exactly as it is, if the eye that sees it is  not equally remote from all its edges.    92.    WHY WHEN AN OBJECT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE EYE ITS EDGES ARE  INDISTINCT.    When an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it, its  edges must become too confused to be distinguished; as it happens  with objects close to a light, which cast a large and indistinct  shadow, so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it;  in all cases of linear perspective, the eye acts in the same way as  the light. And the reason is that the eye has one leading line (of  vision) which dilates with distance and embraces with true  discernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that  are close. But since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which  surround this chief central one and since these which are farthest  from the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with  accuracy, it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not  at a due distance, but is too near for the central line to be able  to discern the outlines of the object. So the edges fall within the  lines of weaker discerning power, and these are to the function of  the eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot  take it. Thus these cannot take in the objects, but induce the  central line of sight to turn upon them, when they have put them up.  Hence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have  confused outlines.    The relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the  eye (93-98).    93.    PERSPECTIVE.    Small objects close at hand and large ones at a distance, being seen  within equal angles, will appear of the same size.    94.    PERSPECTIVE.    There is no object so large but that at a great distance from the  eye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near.    95.    Among objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye  will look the smallest. [Footnote: This axiom, sufficiently clear in  itself, is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram,  constructed like that here reproduced under No. 108.    The same idea is repeated in C. A. I a; I a, stated as follows:  _Infra le cose d'equal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura  che sara più distante dall' ochio_.--]    96.    Why an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye, and why  with spectacles, or without the naked eye sees badly either close or  far off [as the case may be].    97.    PERSPECTIVE.    Among objects of equal size, that which is most remote from the eye  will look the smallest.    98.    PERSPECTIVE.    No second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye  will not see it higher than the first, if the eye is above the  second.    PERSPECTIVE.    And this second object will never be so much higher than the first  as that the eye, being below them, will not see the second as lower  than the first.    PERSPECTIVE.    If the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one,  that is nearer, the second, larger square will appear to be  surrounded by the smaller one.    PERSPECTIVE--PROPOSITION.    Objects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in  front, though smaller, will conceal or surround them.    DEFINITION.    This proposition can be proved by experiment. For if you look  through a small hole there is nothing so large that it cannot be  seen through it and the object so seen appears surrounded and  enclosed by the outline of the sides of the hole. And if you stop it  up, this small stopping will conceal the view of the largest object.    The apparent size of objects defined by calculation (99-105)    99.    OF LINEAR PERSPECTIVE.    Linear Perspective deals with the action of the lines of sight, in  proving by measurement how much smaller is a second object than the  first, and how much the third is smaller than the second; and so on  by degrees to the end of things visible. I find by experience that  if a second object is as far beyond the first as the first is from  the eye, although they are of the same size, the second will seem  half the size of the first and if the third object is of the same  size as the 2nd, and the 3rd is as far beyond the second as the 2nd  from the first, it will appear of half the size of the second; and  so on by degrees, at equal distances, the next farthest will be half  the size of the former object. So long as the space does not exceed  the length of 20 braccia. But, beyond 20 braccia figures of equal  size will lose 2/4 and at 40 braccia they will lose 9/10, and 19/20  at 60 braccia, and so on diminishing by degrees. This is if the  picture plane is distant from you twice your own height. If it is  only as far off as your own height, there will be a great difference  between the first braccia and the second.    [Footnote: This chapter is included in DUFRESNE'S and MANZI'S  editions of the Treatise on Painting. H. LUDWIG, in his commentary,  calls this chapter \"_eines der wichtigsten im ganzen Tractat_\", but  at the same time he asserts that its substance has been so  completely disfigured in the best MS. copies that we ought not to  regard Leonardo as responsible for it. However, in the case of this  chapter, the old MS. copies agree with the original as it is  reproduced above. From the chapters given later in this edition,  which were written at a subsequent date, it would appear that  Leonardo corrected himself on these points.]    100.    OF THE DIMINUTION OF OBJECTS AT VARIOUS DISTANCES.    A second object as far distant from the first as the first is from  the eye will appear half the size of the first, though they be of  the same size really.    OF THE DEGREES OF DIMINUTION.    If you place the vertical plane at one braccio from the eye, the  first object, being at a distance of 4 braccia from your eye will  diminish to 3/4 of its height at that plane; and if it is 8 braccia  from the eye, to 7/8; and if it is 16 braccia off, it will diminish  to 15/16 of its height and so on by degrees, as the space doubles  the diminution will double.    101.    Begin from the line _m f_ with the eye below; then go up and do the  same with the line _n f_, then with the eye above and close to the 2  gauges on the ground look at _m n_; then as _c m_ is to _m n_ so  will _n m_ be to _n s_.    If _a n_ goes 3 times into _f b, m p_ will do the same into _p g_.  Then go backwards so far as that _c d_ goes twice into _a n_ and _p  g_ will be equal to _g h_. And _m p_ will go into _h p_ as often as  _d c_ into _o p_.    [Footnote: The first three lines are unfortunately very obscure.]    102.    I GIVE THE DEGREES OF THE OBJECTS SEEN BY THE EYE AS THE MUSICIAN  DOES THE NOTES HEARD BY THE EAR.    Although the objects seen by the eye do, in fact, touch each other  as they recede, I will nevertheless found my rule on spaces of 20  braccia each; as a musician does with notes, which, though they can  be carried on one into the next, he divides into degrees from note  to note calling them 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th; and has affixed a name  to each degree in raising or lowering the voice.    103.    PERSPECTIVE.    Let _f_ be the level and distance of the eye; and _a_ the vertical  plane, as high as a man; let _e_ be a man, then I say that on the  plane this will be the distance from the plane to the 2nd man.    104.    The differences in the diminution of objects of equal size in  consequence of their various remoteness from the eye will bear among  themselves the same proportions as those of the spaces between the  eye and the different objects.    Find out how much a man diminishes at a certain distance and what  its length is; and then at twice that distance and at 3 times, and  so make your general rule.    105.    The eye cannot judge where an object high up ought to descend.    106.    PERSPECTIVE.    If two similar and equal objects are placed one beyond the other at  a given distance the difference in their size will appear greater in  proportion as they are nearer to the eye that sees them. And  conversely there will seem to be less difference in their size in  proportion as they are remote from the eve.    This is proved by the proportions of their distances among  themselves; for, if the first of these two objects were as far from  the eye, as the 2nd from the first this would be called the second  proportion: since, if the first is at 1 braccia from the eye and the  2nd at two braccia, two being twice as much as one, the first object  will look twice as large as the second. But if you place the first  at a hundred braccia from you and the second at a hundred and one,  you will find that the first is only so much larger than the second  as 100 is less than 101; and the converse is equally true. And  again, the same thing is proved by the 4th of this book which shows  that among objects that are equal, there is the same proportion in  the diminution of the size as in the increase in the distance from  the eye of the spectator.    On natural perspective (107--109).    107.    OF EQUAL OBJECTS THE MOST REMOTE LOOK THE SMALLEST.    The practice of perspective may be divided into ... parts [Footnote  4: _in_ ... _parte_. The space for the number is left blank in the  original.], of which the first treats of objects seen by the eye at  any distance; and it shows all these objects just as the eye sees  them diminished, without obliging a man to stand in one place rather  than another so"]]]
