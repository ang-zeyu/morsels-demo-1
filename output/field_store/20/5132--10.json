Finally Dave had the paper smoothed out. He didn't glance down at it  right away, though. It was as though he were almost afraid to read  whatever was written on the paper. It was as though he would read there  his death warrant, or something. As a matter of fact, a million wild,  crazy thoughts surged through his brain, and he could feel the little  beads of cold sweat that broke out on his forehead. With an effort he  shrugged the maddening thoughts aside, took a deep breath and glanced  down at the paper in his hands. The scrawl was in French, and almost  impossible to read. Dave had to study it hard for a few seconds before  he could make out the words. When he finally did read the message his  heart did nip-ups in his chest. The message was short and right to the  point.    It read,    _In five minutes' walk through rear door._    The message was unsigned. Just those seven words, but at the moment  they constituted the most exciting seven words Dave Dawson had ever  read in his life. He swallowed hard as a means of pushing his looping  heart back down into place. Then he leaned one elbow on the table, and  reached out under the table with the other hand that held the message.    \"A little love note,\" he murmured to Freddy. \"Take a look. We're  getting action, pal ... maybe!\"    Three minutes later Freddy Farmer had the message in his hands and  had read it. His face didn't change a hair save for a tiny white spot  that appeared in each cheek. Many, many times had Dave seen that sign  in his friend. It meant that Freddy Farmer was well nigh on fire with  curiosity and excitement.    \"It worked, Dave, it worked!\" finally came the faint whisper to  Dawson's ears. \"It's going along just as we hoped it would.\"    \"As far as that door, anyway,\" Dave grunted, as a familiar eerie  tingling sensation came to the back of his neck. \"But what happens on  the other side of that door is in the lap of the gods, if you get what  I mean. I.... Hey! Serrangi isn't around any more!\"    \"No, I know it,\" Freddy said. \"While you were reading the note his nibs  went through the door we're supposed to go through.\"    \"Yeah?\" Dave echoed and scowled down into his coffee cup. \"I sure hope  he didn't go out to sharpen up his knife. I think I would have liked it  better if Serrangi had acted as postman instead of that throat slitting  customer. I never did like a middle man in things; a go-between.  However, there's nothing that can be done about it, now. We follow  through, of course?\"    \"Of course!\" came the English youth's quick reply. \"I wouldn't miss  this for the world!\"    Dave smiled in spite of himself. The remark was typical of Freddy  Farmer. He was the kind who might jump ten feet if a mouse should  suddenly pop out of its hole at him, but he would step right up and  paste Death right on the nose without giving it a second thought.  Yes, indeed, Freddy Farmer was a man in a million to have around when  you got into a tight corner. He was better than a whole regiment of  soldiers on occasion.    \"You would!\" Dave chuckled. \"Well, if a knife comes singing along,  don't forget to step in front of me, mate. Or maybe you'd better step  in back of me. It might come that way. Well, I guess it's five minutes.  Let's go take a look at what's on the other side of that door. Luck,  kid!\"    \"I've got my fingers crossed,\" the English born R.A.F. ace murmured and  pushed his cup of coffee to one side with a dissatisfied motion, and  got up onto his feet. \"Here we go.\"    Slouching and weaving along so as to attract the minimum of attention,  Dave and Freddy made their way past the other coffee drinkers to  the rear door. In front of it Dave paused and glanced back over his  shoulder at Freddy. The English youth acted as though he were more  or less walking in his sleep. That is, save for a tiny spark of wild  excitement that burned deep in each eye. Dave winked, half grinned, and  then turned front and pushed open the door.    He stepped into a room that was pitch dark save for the faint shaft of  light that cut through from the coffee shop. But in a split second or  even less it really was pitch dark. Dave sensed swift movement, and the  door was closed quickly in back of Freddy Farmer. Almost at the same  time Dave felt a tiny prick of pain in the left side of his neck. And a  voice hissed softly in his ear.    \"You will stand still while you are searched! Move one muscle and my  knife will plunge in deep. Do not move!\"    The instructions were quite unnecessary as far as Dave was concerned.  The instant he had felt the pin prick of pain in his neck he had frozen  stiff. Even his heart seemed to stop beating. Like a man carved out of  stone he stood there in the darkness while fingers seemed to ripple  all over his body from head to toe. And not for a single instant did  the needle point tip of the knife leave the side of his neck. He sensed  rather than saw or heard the second figure there in the pitch darkness  who was searching Freddy Farmer.    Then suddenly the pin prick of the knife point was gone and steel  fingers closed over his right arm at the elbow.    \"Come with me!\" the hissing French voice said. \"It is but a short  distance.\"    It was at that. Dave didn't take more than a dozen steps before his  \"guide\" halted him, turned him to face the right, and pushed open a  door. Before Dave could blink, and focus his eyes to the sudden change  of light, he found himself in a dimly lit room that at least smelled a  little less obnoxious than the coffee room up front. It was furnished  as a sort of combination sleeping quarters and business office. There  was a bed in the corner, a table, a desk and a few chairs. Posters  quoting market spices and coffee prices hung on the wall. And scattered  about here and there were empty packing boxes and cartons that had the  names of shipping ports on them from all over the world.    Dave gave all the trimmings but a fleeting glance. What caught and  riveted his attention was Serrangi seated in a grease-smeared  over-stuffed chair. The Sumatran looked more hideous than ever in the  pale light, and the brown paper wrapped cigarette he was smoking was  all of five inches long. He stared at the youths out of eyes that were  expressionless as those of a dead fish. He made no move, nor sign, nor  said anything. He seemed not to hear the rapid jumble of a Far Eastern  tongue that hissed over Dave's shoulder. Nor did his eyes follow two  figures as they glided out of the room, and softly closed the door.    He simply stared unseeing at Dave and Freddy, and Dave could feel the  cold sweat begin to form in his armpits and trickle down his ribs. It  was as though he and Freddy had been left standing like a couple of  wooden Indians staring unspeaking at a dead man with a live cigarette  in his long claw-like fingers. It was an awful feeling. Dave wanted to  yell, or jump up and down. Anything to shake the evil looking Serrangi  out of his trance, or whatever it was.    Suddenly an idea came to Dave. For a moment he was afraid to try it,  but when Serrangi continued to stare at them out of almost sightless  eyes he did so out of sheer desperation. He clicked his heels together,  stiffened rigid, and flung up his right arm to the horizontal, and  shouted,    \"_Heil Hitler!_\"    He heard the gasp of startled amazement from Freddy Farmer's lips, but  he didn't waste time looking at his friend. He kept his eyes riveted  on Serrangi's face, and in the next second he received his reward. The  owner of the Devil's Den relaxed outwardly. Most of the fishy look left  his eyes. He nodded his head slightly, and what probably was meant for  a smile caused one corner of his mouth to twitch.    \"You took long enough, comrade,\" he said in a voice that sounded like  ashes sliding down a tin roof. \"_Heil Hitler!_ And what brings you two  here to the Devil's Den? I have received no word that you were to be  expected!\"    The man spoke perfect German, and Dave had the sudden feeling that  Serrangi had spent a long time in Berlin, as well as in a lot of other  places. The Sumatran was hideous to behold, and his clothes looked not  one bit cleaner nor more costly than those of any one of his coffee  shop's customers. Yet, somehow, the certain something that lurked  deep in the one good eye gave one the impression that the shaven, sun  blackened, egg shaped head contained a brain that was as quick as a  steel trap. And as deadly, too. Yes, Serrangi, of the Devil's Den,  might look like the dope filled fool, but he was undoubtedly the  direct opposite.    \"Well?\" he suddenly snarled like a Prussian officer when neither of the  boys spoke. \"Have you tongues? Or is it perhaps the look of my face you  do not like, _hein_?\"    \"The fortunes of war, is the answer to your question, _mein Herr_,\"  Freddy Farmer spoke up. \"We were traveling by boat for service to _Der  Fuehrer_ in Australia. However, the boat was torpedoed and sunk. We  were two of the few saved. By a fishing boat. It put us ashore here at  Singapore. We had no choice in the matter. Our first task was to avoid  the police. We....\"    \"You fools!\" Serrangi rasped and thumped one clenched fist on the arm  of his chair. \"So you came here, to the Devil's Den? To the place the  swine police inspect nightly, and raid at least twice a week! Have you  no brains in your heads? What brand of stupid swine is _Herr Himmler_  enlisting in his precious Gestapo these days. _Gott!_\"    \"We are sorry, _Herr_ Serrangi,\" Dave began.    \"You mean you are _lucky_!\" Serrangi cut in. \"Lucky that those  policemen tonight were searching for a pair of petty thieves. Had it  been one of their regular raids you would now be behind bars, and your  hides not worth a Reich mark!\"    The Devil's Den owner made a savage little gesture with one hand for  emphasis. Then he leaned forward"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5067"],[0,"The Rainbow Trail (#12)"],[1,"gray mare and, warned by a yell from Withers, he jumped back just in  time to avoid her vicious heels. Then Shefford turned his attention to  Nack-yal and chased him all over the flat in a futile effort to catch  him. Nas Ta Bega came to Shefford's assistance and put a rope over  Nack-yal's head.    \"Don't ever get behind one of these mustangs,\" said Withers, warningly,  as Shefford came up. \"You might be killed.... Eat your bite now. We'll  soon be out of here.\"    Shefford had been late in awakening. The others had breakfasted. He  found eating somewhat difficult in the excitement that ensued. Nas Ta  Bega held ropes which were round the necks of Red and Dynamite. The mule  showed his cunning and always appeared to present his heels to Withers,  who tried to approach him with a pack-saddle. The patience of the trader  was a revelation to Shefford. And at length Red was cornered by the  three men, the pack-saddle was strapped on, and then the packs. Red  promptly bucked the packs off, and the work had to be done over again.  Then Red dropped his long ears and seemed ready to be tractable.    When Shefford turned his attention to Dynamite he decided that this  was his first sight of a wild horse. The gray mare had fiery eyes that  rolled and showed the white. She jumped straight up, screamed, pawed,  bit, and then plunged down to shoot her hind hoofs into the air as high  as her head had been. She was amazingly agile and she seemed mad to kill  something. She dragged the Indian about, and when Joe Lake got a rope  on her hind foot she dragged them both. They lashed her with the ends  of the lassoes, which action only made her kick harder. She plunged  into camp, drove Shefford flying for his life, knocked down two of the  burros, and played havoc with the unstrapped packs. Withers ran to  the assistance of Lake, and the two of them hauled back with all their  strength and weight. They were both powerful and heavy men. Dynamite  circled round and finally, after kicking the camp-fire to bits, fell  down on her haunches in the hot embers. \"Let--her--set--there!\" panted  Withers. And Joe Lake shouted, \"Burn up, you durn coyote!\" Both men  appeared delighted that she had brought upon herself just punishment.  Dynamite sat in the remains of the fire long enough to get burnt, and  then she got up and meekly allowed Withers to throw a tarpaulin and a  roll of blankets over her and tie them fast.    Lake and Withers were sweating freely when this job was finished.    \"Say, is that a usual morning's task with the pack-animals?\" asked  Shefford.    \"They're all pretty decent to-day, except Dynamite,\" replied Withers.  \"She's got to be worked out.\"    Shefford felt both amusement and consternation. The sun was just rising  over the ramparts of the canyon, and he had already seen more difficult  and dangerous work accomplished than half a dozen men of his type could  do in a whole day. He liked the outlook of his new duty as Withers's  assistant, but he felt helplessly inefficient. Still, all he needed  was experience. He passed over what he anticipated would be pain and  peril--the cost was of no moment.    Soon the pack-train was on the move, with the Indian leading. This  morning Nack-yal began his strange swinging off to the left, precisely  as he had done the day before. It got to be annoying to Shefford, and  he lost patience with the mustang and jerked him sharply round. This,  however, had no great effect upon Nack-yal.    As the train headed straight up the canyon Joe Lake dropped back to ride  beside Shefford. The Mormon had been amiable and friendly.    \"Flock of deer up that draw,\" he said, pointing up a narrow side canyon.    Shefford gazed to see a half-dozen small, brown, long-eared objects,  very like burros, watching the pack-train pass.    \"Are they deer?\" he asked, delightedly.    \"Sure are,\" replied Joe, sincerely. \"Get down and shoot one. There's a  rifle in your saddle-sheath.\"    Shefford had already discovered that he had been armed this morning, a  matter which had caused him reflection. These animals certainly looked  like deer; he had seen a few deer, though not in their native wild  haunts; and he experienced the thrill of the hunter. Dismounting, he  drew the rifle out of the sheath and started toward the little canyon.    \"Hyar! Where you going with that gun?\" yelled Withers. \"That's a bunch  of burros.... Joe's up to his old tricks. Shefford, look out for Joe!\"    Rather sheepishly Shefford returned to his mustang and sheathed the  rifle, and then took a long look at the animals up the draw. They,  resembled deer, but upon second glance they surely were burros.    \"Durn me! Now if I didn't think they sure were deer!\" exclaimed Joe. He  appeared absolutely sincere and innocent. Shefford hardly knew how to  take this likable Mormon, but vowed he would be on his guard in the  future.    Nas Ta Bega soon led the pack-train toward the left wall of the canyon,  and evidently intended to scale it. Shefford could not see any trail,  and the wall appeared steep and insurmountable. But upon nearing the  cliff he saw a narrow broken trail leading zigzag up over smooth rock,  weathered slope, and through cracks.    \"Spread out, and careful now!\" yelled Withers.    The need of both advices soon became manifest to Shefford. The burros  started stones rolling, making danger for those below. Shefford  dismounted and led Nack-yal and turned aside many a rolling rock. The  Indian and the burros, with the red mule leading, climbed steadily. But  the mustangs had trouble. Joe's spirited bay had to be coaxed to face  the ascent; Nack-yal balked at every difficult step; and Dynamite  slipped on a flat slant of rock and slid down forty feet. Withers and  Lake with ropes hauled the mare out of the dangerous position. Shefford,  who brought up the rear, saw all the action, and it was exciting, but  his pleasure in the climb was spoiled by sight of blood and hair on  the stones. The ascent was crooked, steep, and long, and when Shefford  reached the top of the wall he was glad to rest. It made him gasp to  look down and see what he had surmounted. The canyon floor, green and  level, lay a thousand feet below; and the wild burros which had followed  on the trail looked like rabbits.    Shefford mounted presently, and rode out upon a wide, smooth trail  leading into a cedar forest. There were bunches of gray sage in the open  places. The air was cool and crisp, laden with a sweet fragrance. He saw  Lake and Withers bobbing along, now on one side of the trail, now on the  other, and they kept to a steady trot. Occasionally the Indian and his  bright-red saddle-blanket showed in an opening of the cedars.    It was level country, and there was nothing for Shefford to see except  cedar and sage, an outcropping of red rock in places, and the winding  trail. Mocking-birds made melody everywhere. Shefford seemed full of  a strange pleasure, and the hours flew by. Nack-yal still wanted to be  everlastingly turning off the trail, and, moreover, now he wanted to go  faster. He was eager, restless, dissatisfied.    At noon the pack-train descended into a deep draw, well covered with  cedar and sage. There was plenty of grass and shade, but no water.  Shefford was surprised to see that every pack was removed; however, the  roll of blankets was left on Dynamite.    The men made a fire and began to cook a noonday meal. Shefford, tired  and warm, sat in a shady spot and watched. He had become all eyes. He  had almost forgotten Fay Larkin; he had forgotten his trouble; and  the present seemed sweet and full. Presently his ears were filled by a  pattering roar and, looking up the draw, he saw two streams of sheep  and goats coming down. Soon an Indian shepherd appeared, riding a fine  mustang. A cream-colored colt bounded along behind, and presently a  shaggy dog came in sight. The Indian dismounted at the camp, and his  flock spread by in two white and black streams. The dog went with them.  Withers and Joe shook hands with the Indian, whom Joe called \"Navvy,\"  and Shefford lost no time in doing likewise. Then Nas Ta Bega came in,  and he and the Navajo talked. When the meal was ready all of them sat  down round the canvas. The shepherd did not tie his horse.    Presently Shefford noticed that Nack-yal had returned to camp and was  acting strangely. Evidently he was attracted by the Indian's mustang or  the cream-colored colt. At any rate, Nack-yal hung around, tossed his  head, whinnied in a low, nervous manner, and looked strangely eager and  wild. Shefford was at first amused, then curious. Nack-yal approached  too close to the mother of the colt, and she gave him a sounding kick in  the ribs. Nack-yal uttered a plaintive snort and backed away, to stand,  crestfallen, with all his eagerness and fire vanished.    Nas Ta Bega pointed to the mustang and said something in his own tongue.  Then Withers addressed the visiting Indian, and they exchanged some  words, whereupon the trader turned to Shefford:    \"I bought Nack-yal from this Indian three years ago. This mare is  Nack-yal's mother. He was born over here to the south. That's why he  always swung left off the trail. He wanted to go home. Just now he  recognized his mother and she whaled away and gave him a whack for his  pains. She's got a colt now and probably didn't recognize Nack-yal. But  he's broken-hearted.\"    The trader laughed, and Joe said, \"You can't tell what these durn  mustangs will do.\" Shefford felt sorry for Nack-yal, and when it came  time to saddle him again found him easier to handle than ever before.  Nack-yal stood with head down, broken-spirited.    Shefford was the first to ride up out of the draw, and once upon the  top of the ridge he halted to gaze, wide-eyed and entranced. A rolling,  endless plain sloped down beneath him, and led him on to a distant  round-topped mountain. To the right a red canyon opened its jagged jaws,  and away to the north"]]]
