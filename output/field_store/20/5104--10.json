He saw that while  the brutes have all the useful things, the things that are truly human  are the useless ones.  He saw the falsehood of that almost universal  notion of to-day, the notion that rites and forms are something  artificial, additional, and corrupt. Ritual is really much older than  thought; it is much simpler and much wilder than thought.  A feeling  touching the nature of things does not only make men feel that there  are certain proper things to say; it makes them feel that there are  certain proper things to do. The more agreeable of these consist of  dancing, building temples, and shouting very loud; the less agreeable,  of wearing green carnations and burning other philosophers alive. But  everywhere the religious dance came before the religious hymn, and man  was a ritualist before he could speak.  If Comtism had spread the world  would have been converted, not by the Comtist philosophy, but by the  Comtist calendar.  By discouraging what they conceive to be the  weakness of their master, the English Positivists have broken the  strength of their religion.  A man who has faith must be prepared not  only to be a martyr, but to be a fool. It is absurd to say that a man  is ready to toil and die for his convictions when he is not even ready  to wear a wreath round his head for them. I myself, to take a corpus  vile, am very certain that I would not read the works of Comte through  for any consideration whatever. But I can easily imagine myself with  the greatest enthusiasm lighting a bonfire on Darwin Day.    That splendid effort failed, and nothing in the style of it has  succeeded. There has been no rationalist festival, no rationalist  ecstasy. Men are still in black for the death of God.  When  Christianity was heavily bombarded in the last century upon no point  was it more persistently and brilliantly attacked than upon that of its  alleged enmity to human joy. Shelley and Swinburne and all their armies  have passed again and again over the ground, but they have not altered  it.  They have not set up a single new trophy or ensign for the world's  merriment to rally to. They have not given a name or a new occasion of  gaiety. Mr. Swinburne does not hang up his stocking on the eve of the  birthday of Victor Hugo.  Mr. William Archer does not sing carols  descriptive of the infancy of Ibsen outside people's doors in the snow.  In the round of our rational and mournful year one festival remains out  of all those ancient gaieties that once covered the whole earth.  Christmas remains to remind us of those ages, whether Pagan or  Christian, when the many acted poetry instead of the few writing it. In  all the winter in our woods there is no tree in glow but the holly.    The strange truth about the matter is told in the very word \"holiday.\"  A bank holiday means presumably a day which bankers regard as holy. A  half-holiday means, I suppose, a day on which a schoolboy is only  partially holy.  It is hard to see at first sight why so human a thing  as leisure and larkiness should always have a religious origin.  Rationally there appears no reason why we should not sing and give each  other presents in honour of anything--the birth of Michael Angelo or  the opening of Euston Station.  But it does not work. As a fact, men  only become greedily and gloriously material about something  spiritualistic.  Take away the Nicene Creed and similar things, and you  do some strange wrong to the sellers of sausages. Take away the strange  beauty of the saints, and what has remained to us is the far stranger  ugliness of Wandsworth. Take away the supernatural, and what remains is  the unnatural.    And now I have to touch upon a very sad matter.  There are in the  modern world an admirable class of persons who really make protest on  behalf of that antiqua pulchritudo of which Augustine spoke, who do  long for the old feasts and formalities of the childhood of the world.  William Morris and his followers showed how much brighter were the dark  ages than the age of Manchester.  Mr. W. B. Yeats frames his steps in  prehistoric dances, but no man knows and joins his voice to forgotten  choruses that no one but he can hear.  Mr. George Moore collects every  fragment of Irish paganism that the forgetfulness of the Catholic  Church has left or possibly her wisdom preserved. There are innumerable  persons with eye-glasses and green garments who pray for the return of  the maypole or the Olympian games. But there is about these people a  haunting and alarming something which suggests that it is just possible  that they do not keep Christmas. It is painful to regard human nature  in such a light, but it seems somehow possible that Mr. George Moore  does not wave his spoon and shout when the pudding is set alight. It is  even possible that Mr. W. B. Yeats never pulls crackers. If so, where  is the sense of all their dreams of festive traditions? Here is a solid  and ancient festive tradition still plying a roaring trade in the  streets, and they think it vulgar. if this is so, let them be very  certain of this, that they are the kind of people who in the time of  the maypole would have thought the maypole vulgar; who in the time of  the Canterbury pilgrimage would have thought the Canterbury pilgrimage  vulgar; who in the time of the Olympian games would have thought the  Olympian games vulgar. Nor can there be any reasonable doubt that they  were vulgar. Let no man deceive himself; if by vulgarity we mean  coarseness of speech, rowdiness of behaviour, gossip, horseplay, and  some heavy drinking, vulgarity there always was wherever there was joy,  wherever there was faith in the gods.  Wherever you have belief you  will have hilarity, wherever you have hilarity you will have some  dangers.  And as creed and mythology produce this gross and vigorous  life, so in its turn this gross and vigorous life will always produce  creed and mythology. If we ever get the English back on to the English  land they will become again a religious people, if all goes well, a  superstitious people. The absence from modern life of both the higher  and lower forms of faith is largely due to a divorce from nature and  the trees and clouds. If we have no more turnip ghosts it is chiefly  from the lack of turnips.        VII.  Omar and the Sacred Vine    A new morality has burst upon us with some violence in connection with  the problem of strong drink; and enthusiasts in the matter range from  the man who is violently thrown out at 12.30, to the lady who smashes  American bars with an axe.  In these discussions it is almost always  felt that one very wise and moderate position is to say that wine or  such stuff should only be drunk as a medicine. With this I should  venture to disagree with a peculiar ferocity. The one genuinely  dangerous and immoral way of drinking wine is to drink it as a  medicine.  And for this reason, If a man drinks wine in order to obtain  pleasure, he is trying to obtain something exceptional, something he  does not expect every hour of the day, something which, unless he is a  little insane, he will not try to get every hour of the day.  But if a  man drinks wine in order to obtain health, he is trying to get  something natural; something, that is, that he ought not to be without;  something that he may find it difficult to reconcile himself to being  without.  The man may not be seduced who has seen the ecstasy of being  ecstatic; it is more dazzling to catch a glimpse of the ecstasy of  being ordinary. If there were a magic ointment, and we took it to a  strong man, and said, \"This will enable you to jump off the Monument,\"  doubtless he would jump off the Monument, but he would not jump off the  Monument all day long to the delight of the City. But if we took it to  a blind man, saying, \"This will enable you to see,\" he would be under a  heavier temptation.  It would be hard for him not to rub it on his eyes  whenever he heard the hoof of a noble horse or the birds singing at  daybreak.  It is easy to deny one's self festivity; it is difficult to  deny one's self normality. Hence comes the fact which every doctor  knows, that it is often perilous to give alcohol to the sick even when  they need it. I need hardly say that I do not mean that I think the  giving of alcohol to the sick for stimulus is necessarily  unjustifiable. But I do mean that giving it to the healthy for fun is  the proper use of it, and a great deal more consistent with health.    The sound rule in the matter would appear to be like many other sound  rules--a paradox.  Drink because you are happy, but never because you  are miserable.  Never drink when you are wretched without it, or you  will be like the grey-faced gin-drinker in the slum; but drink when you  would be happy without it, and you will be like the laughing peasant of  Italy.  Never drink because you need it, for this is rational drinking,  and the way to death and hell. But drink because you do not need it,  for this is irrational drinking, and the ancient health of the world.    For more than thirty years the shadow and glory of a great Eastern  figure has lain upon our English literature. Fitzgerald's translation  of Omar Khayyam concentrated into an immortal poignancy all the dark  and drifting hedonism of our time. Of the literary splendour of that  work it would be merely banal to speak; in few other of the books of  men has there been anything so combining the gay pugnacity of an  epigram with the vague sadness of a song. But of its philosophical,  ethical, and religious influence which has been almost as great as its  brilliancy, I should like to say a word, and that word, I confess, one  of uncompromising hostility. There are a great many things which might  be said against the spirit of the Rubaiyat, and against its prodigious  influence. But one matter of indictment towers ominously above the  rest--a genuine"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47109"],[0,"Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F. Smith (#12)"],[1,"deal that is yet to be taught in the spirit of  instruction, and there is a great deal that has been revealed through  the Prophet Joseph and his associates that the people have not yet  received in their hearts, and have not yet become converted to as they  should. When we obey and are capable of observing the precepts of the  gospel and the laws of God and the requirements of heaven, which have  already been revealed, we will be far better off and nearer the goal  of perfection in wisdom, knowledge and power than we are today. When  that time comes, then there are other things still greater yet to be  revealed to the people of God. Until we do our duty, however, in that  which we have received, until we are faithful over the things that are  now committed into our hands, until we live our religion as we have it  now, as the Lord has given it to us, to add commandments, to add light  and intelligence to us over that which we have already received, which  we have not yet fully obeyed, would be to add condemnation upon our  heads. It is enough for us to live in the light of present inspiration  and present revelation and for each individual member of the Church  to keep the commandments of the Lord and labor in the Church as the  Spirit may give him and her guidance in the {45} performance of duty.  Every soul of us is entitled to inspiration from God to know what is  our duty and how we are to do it. We have not learned it yet, not all  of us, but we are in a fair way to learn. The Lord is still patient; he  is long-suffering; he is full of love and graciousness towards all, and  we are doing a little better all the time. I believe we are a little  more faithful in the performance of our duties than we have been in the  past; yet there is great room for improvement.--_Oct. C. R.,_ 1917, p.  5.    HOW THE LORD REVEALS HIS PURPOSES CONCERNING THE CHURCH. And I know  this, that God has organized his Church in the earth, and I know  that when he designs or purposes to make any change in the matter of  governing or controlling or presiding over the affairs of his Church,  that he will make the change, and he will make it in such a way that  the whole people of the Church, who are doing right, will understand  and accept it. I know that the Lord will not raise up \"Tom, Dick, or  Harry,\" here, there and everywhere, claiming to be Christ, or \"one  mighty and strong,\" claiming to be inspired and called to do some  wonderful thing. The Lord will not deal with men in that way; that  while the organization of the Church exists, while quorums and councils  of the Priesthood are intact in the Church, the Lord will reveal his  purposes through them, and not through \"Tom, Dick, or Harry.\" Put that  in your little note books now, and remember it; it is true.--_Apr. C.  R.,_ 1912, p. 10.    MODERN REVELATION IS NECESSARY. We are to understand, then, that God  does not, and will not further make known his will to men; that what he  has said suffices? His will to Moses and Isaiah and John is abundant  for modern followers of Christ? The Latter-day Saints take issue with  this doctrine, and pronounce it illogical inconsistent, and untrue, and  bear testimony to all the world that God lives and that he reveals his  will to men who believe in him and who obey his commandments, as much  in our day as at any {46} time in the history of nations. The canon of  scripture is not full. God has never revealed at any time that he would  cease to speak forever to men. If we are permitted to believe that he  has spoken, we must and do believe that he continues to speak, because  he is unchangeable.    His will to Abraham did not suffice for Moses, neither did his will  to Moses suffice for Isaiah. Why? Because their different missions  required different instructions; and logically, that is also true  of the prophets and people of today. A progressive world will never  discover all truth until its inhabitants become familiar with all the  knowledge of the Perfect One. How shall men become acquainted with the  knowledge of the Father? Only as he reveals it to them. Now if we are  permitted to believe that the Lord revealed himself to the ancients of  whose deeds we read in the Holy Scriptures, it seems to me that there  is no good reason for believing that it is not necessary that he should  reveal himself in this day to others who desire to be guided by his  Spirit and inspiration. Every new truth which grows into living action  in the lives of men is a revelation in itself from God, and without the  revelation of additional truth, men would not progress in this world,  but, left to themselves, would retrograde, being cut off from the light  and life of the great fountain of all intelligence, the Father of all.    What is revelation but the uncovering of new truths, by him who is the  Fountain of all Truth? To say that there is no need of new revelation,  is equivalent to saying that we have no need of new truths--a  ridiculous assertion.    Now, as to the usefulness of modern revelation, that has been referred  to above, in the brief treatment of its need, and it is no sign  that revelation is useless because it is not proper that it should  be accepted in the courts. \"Render unto Caesar the things that are  Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.\" Revelation given  for the personal knowledge or guidance of any person should not be  given {47} to the public, either in a civil or religious capacity; but  because it might be (and in such cases is) considered improper for  public use, it is no sign that even such revelation is useless to the  person for whom it is intended. It might be said in passing, however,  that the revelation which the ministers were so troubled about, turned  out to be correct and in conformity with the evidence, and the decision  of the court and jury.    Our testimony is that God lives, and that he speaks by his power to men  who seek him and believe in him, thus making known his will to them in  matters that pertain, not only to his true Church, but in matters that  pertain to each individual who seeks him.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol. 5,  p. 805.    THEORY AND DIVINE REVELATION. Our young people are diligent students.  They reach out after truth and knowledge with commendable zeal, and in  so doing they must necessarily adopt for temporary use, many theories  of men. As long, however, as they recognize them as scaffolding useful  for research purposes, there can be no special harm in them. It is when  these theories are settled upon as basic truth that trouble appears,  and the searcher then stands in grave danger of being led hopelessly  from the right way.    There are so many demonstrated, practical, material truths, so many  spiritual certainties, with which the youth of Zion should become  familiar, that it appears a waste of time and means, and detrimental  to faith and religion to enter too extensively into the undemonstrated  theories of men on philosophies relating to the origin of life, or  the methods adopted by an Allwise Creator in peopling the earth with  the bodies of men, birds and beasts. Let us rather turn our abilities  to the practical analysis of the soil, the study of the elements, the  productions of the earth, the invention of useful machinery, the social  welfare of the race, and its material amelioration; and for the rest  cultivate an abiding {48} faith in the revealed word of God and the  saving principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which give joy in this  world and in the world to come eternal life and salvation.    Philosophic theories of life have their place and use, but it is not  in the classes of the Church schools, and particularly are they out of  place here or anywhere else, when they seek to supplant the revelations  of God. The ordinary student cannot delve into these subjects deep  enough to make them of any practical use to him, and a smattering of  knowledge in this line only tends to upset his simple faith in the  gospel, which is of more value to him in life than all the learning of  the world without it.    The religion of the Latter-day Saints is not hostile to any truth, nor  to scientific search for truth. \"That which is demonstrated, we accept  with joy,\" said the First Presidency in their Christmas greeting to  the Saints, \"but vain philosophy, human theory and mere speculations  of men we do not accept, nor do we adopt anything contrary to divine  revelation or to good common sense, but everything that tends to right  conduct, that harmonizes with sound morality and increases faith in  Deity, finds favor with us, no matter where it may be found.\"    A good motto for young people to adopt, who are determined to delve  into philosophic theories, is to search all things, but be careful  to hold on only to that which is true. The truth persists, but the  theories of philosophers change and are overthrown. What men use today  as a scaffolding for scientific purposes from which to reach out into  the unknown for truth, may be torn down tomorrow, having served its  purpose; but faith is an eternal principle through which the humble  believer may secure everlasting solace. It is the only way to find God.    Science and philosophy through all the ages have undergone change  after change. Scarcely a century has passed but they have introduced  new theories of science and philosophy, {49} that supersede the old  traditions and the old faith and the old doctrines entertained by  philosophers and scientists. These things may undergo continuous  changes, but the word of God is always true, is always right. The  principles of the gospel are always true, the principles of faith  in God, repentance from sin, baptism for the remission of sins by  authority of God, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy  Ghost--these principles are always true, and are always absolutely  necessary for the salvation of the children of men, no matter who  they are and where"]]]
