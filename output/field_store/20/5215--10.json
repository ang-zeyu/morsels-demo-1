We pray you to allow us to bring our  captain, who has been sorely wounded by the Spaniards, on shore.\"    \"What has been the firing we have heard? We could see the flashes  across the water.\"    \"We have been twice engaged,\" Peters shouted; \"first with two  Spanish galleys, and then with a large ship of war, which we beat  off with heavy loss.\"    \"Well done, Englishmen!\" the voice exclaimed, and the boat at once  rowed out to the brig. \"You cannot come in tonight,\" the Dutch  official said, \"for the chain is up across the harbour, and the  rule is imperative and without exception; but I will gladly take  your captain on shore, and he shall have, I promise you, the best  surgical aid the town can give him. Is he the only one hurt?\"    \"One of the men has been injured with a splinter, but he needs but  bandaging and laying up for a few days. We have had a shot or two  through our bulwarks, and the sails are riddled. The captain's son  is below with him; he acts as second mate, and will tell you all  about this affair into which we were forced.\"    \"Very well; we will take him ashore with us then. There is quite  an excitement there. The news that a sea fight was going on brought  all the citizens to the walls.\"    The mattress upon which Captain Martin was lying was brought out  and lowered carefully into the stern of the boat. Ned took his  seat beside it, and the boat pushed off. Having passed the forts  they entered the port and rowed to the landing place. A number of  citizens, many of them carrying torches, were assembled here.    \"What is the news?\" a voice asked as the boat approached.    \"It is an English ship, burgomaster. She has been hotly engaged;  first with Spanish galleys, and then with a warship, which was  doubtless the one seen beating up this afternoon. She sank one of  the galleys and beat off the ship.\" A loud cheer broke from the  crowd. When it subsided the official went on: \"I have the English  captain and his son on board. The captain is sorely wounded, and  I have promised him the best medical aid the town can give him.\"    \"That he shall have,\" the burgomaster said. \"Let him be carried to  my house at once. Hans Leipart, do you hurry on and tell my wife  to get a chamber prepared instantly. You have heard who it is, and  why he is coming, and I warrant me she will do her best to make the  brave Englishman comfortable. Do two others of you run to Doctors  Zobel and Harreng, and pray them to hasten to my house. Let a  stretcher be fetched instantly from the town hall.\"    As soon as the stretcher was brought the mattress was placed on it,  and six of the sailors carried it on shore. The crowd had by this  time greatly increased, for the news had rapidly spread. Every  head was bared in token of sympathy and respect as the litter was  brought up. The crowd fell back and formed a lane, and, led by the  burgomaster, the sailors carried the wounded man into the town. He  was taken upstairs to the room prepared for him, and the surgeons  were speedily in attendance. Medicine in those days was but a  primitive science, but the surgery, though rough and rude, was far  ahead of the sister art. Wars were of such constant occurrence that  surgeons had ample opportunity for practice; and simple operations  such as the amputation of limbs, were matters of very common  occurrence. It needed but a very short examination by the two surgeons  to enable them to declare that the leg must at once be amputated.    \"The bone appears to be completely smashed,\" one of them said.  \"Doubtless the ball was fired at a very short distance.\" A groan  burst from Ned when he heard the decision.    \"I knew that it would be so, Ned,\" his father said. \"I never doubted  it for a moment. It is well that I have been able to obtain aid so  speedily. Better a limb than life, my boy. I did not wince when I  was hit, and with God's help I can stand the pain now. Do you go  away and tell the burgomaster how it all came about, and leave me  with these gentlemen.\"    As soon as Ned had left the room, sobbing in spite of his efforts  to appear manly, the captain said: \"Now, gentlemen, since this must  be done, I pray you to do it without loss of time. I will bear it  as best I can, I promise you; and as three or four and twenty years  at sea makes a man pretty hard and accustomed to rough usage, I  expect I shall stand it as well as another.\"    The surgeons agreed that there was no advantage in delay, and  indeed that it was far better to amputate it before fever set in.  They therefore returned home at once for their instruments, the  knives and saws, the irons that were to be heated white hot to stop  the bleeding, and the other appliances in use at the time. Had Ned  been aware that the operation would have taken place so soon, he  would have been unable to satisfy the curiosity of the burgomaster  and citizens to know how it had happened that an English trader had  come to blows with the Spaniards; but he had no idea that it would  take place that night, and thought that probably some days would  elapse before the surgeons finally decided that it was necessary  to amputate it.    One of the surgeons had, at the captain's request, called the  burgomaster aside as he left the house, and begged him to keep the  lad engaged in conversation until he heard from him that all was  over. This the burgomaster willingly promised to do; and as many  of the leading citizens were assembled in the parlour to hear the  news, there was no chance of Ned's slipping away.    \"Before you begin to tell us your story, young sir, we should be  glad to know how it is that you speak our language so well; for  indeed we could not tell by your accent that you are not a native  of these parts, which is of course impossible, seeing that your  father is an Englishman and captain of the ship lying off there.\"    \"My mother comes from near here,\" Ned said. \"She is the daughter of  Mynheer Plomaert, who lived at Vordwyk, two miles from Amsterdam.  She went over to England when she married my father, but when he  was away on his voyages she always spoke her own language to us  children, so that we grew to speak it naturally as we did English.\"    Ned then related the news that met them on their arrival at his  grandfather's home, and the exclamation of fury on the part of his  father.    \"It is a common enough story with us here,\" the burgomaster said,  \"for few of us but have lost friends or relatives at the hands  of these murderous tyrants of ours. But to you, living in a free  land, truly it must have been a dreadful shock; and I wonder not  that your father's indignation betrayed him into words which, if  overheard, might well cost a man his life in this country.\"    \"They were overheard and reported,\" Ned said; and then proceeded to  relate the warning they had received, the measures they had taken  to get off unperceived, the accidental meeting with the guard boat  and the way in which it had been sunk, the pursuit by the galleys  and the fight with them, and then the encounter with the Spanish  ship of war.    \"And you say your father never relaxed his hold of the tiller when  struck!\" the burgomaster said in surprise. \"I should have thought  he must needs have fallen headlong to the ground.\"    \"He told me,\" Ned replied, \"that at the moment he was hit he was  pushing over the tiller, and had his weight partly on that and  partly on his other leg. Had it been otherwise he would of course  have gone down, for he said that for a moment he thought his leg  had been shot off.\"    When Ned finished his narrative the burgomaster and magistrates  were loud in their exclamations of admiration at the manner in  which the little trader had both fought and deceived her powerful  opponent.    \"It was gallantly done indeed,\" the burgomaster said. \"Truly it  seems marvellous that a little ship with but twenty hands should  have fought and got safely away from the Don Pedro, for that was  the ship we saw pass this afternoon. We know her well, for she has  often been in port here before we declared for the Prince of Orange  a month ago. The beggars of the sea themselves could not have done  better,--could they, my friends? though we Dutchmen and Zeelanders  believe that there are no sailors that can match our own.\"    The story had taken nearly an hour to tell, and Ned now said:    \"With your permission, sir, I will now go up to my father again.\"    \"You had best not go for the present,\" the burgomaster said. \"The  doctor asked me to keep you with me for awhile, for that he wished  his patient to be entirely undisturbed. He is by his bedside now,  and will let me know at once if your father wishes to have you with  him.\"    A quarter of an hour later a servant called the burgomaster out.  The surgeon was waiting outside.    \"It is finished,\" he said, \"and he has borne it well. Scarce a  groan escaped him, even when we applied the hot irons; but he is  utterly exhausted now, and we have given him an opiate, and hope  that he will soon drop off to sleep. My colleague will remain with  him for four hours, and then I will return and take his place. You  had best say nothing to the lad about it. He would naturally want  to see his father; we would much rather that he should not. Therefore  tell him, please, that his father is dropping off to sleep, and  must not on any account be disturbed; and that we are sitting up  with him by turns, and will let him know at once should there be  any occasion for his presence.\"    Ned was glad to hear that his father was likely to get off to  sleep; and although he would gladly have sat up with him, he knew  that it was much better that he should have the surgeon beside him.  The burgomaster's wife, a kind and motherly woman, took him aside  into a little parlour, where a table was laid with a cold capon,  some manchets of bread, and a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#12)"],[1," do please ask them as a  favor to me to get a move on. It's no good saying that I'm walking on a  volcano. I'm from Missouri. I want to be shown. Let's see this volcano.  Bring it out and make it trot around.\"    \"You may jest--\"    \"Who's jesting? I'm not. It's a mighty serious thing for me. I want to  get away. The only thing that's keeping me in this forsaken place is  this delay. These people are obviously going to fire me sooner or  later. Why on earth can't they do it at once?\"    \"What say?\" said the walrus.    \"You may well ask, Colonel,\" said Mr. Pugh, staring amazed at John.  \"His Highness appears completely to have lost his senses.\"    The walrus looked at John as if expecting some demonstration of  practical insanity, but, finding him outwardly calm, closed his eyes  and nodded heavily again.    \"I must say, don't you know,\" said Mr. Archer-Cleeve, \"it beats me,  what?\"    The entire deputation seemed to consider that John's last speech needed  footnotes.    John was in no mood to supply them. His patience was exhausted.    \"I guess we'll call this conference finished,\" he said. \"You've been  told all you came to find out,--my reason for closing the Casino. If it  doesn't strike you as a satisfactory reason, that's up to you. Do what  you like about it. The one thing you may take as a solid fact--and you  can spread it around the town as much as ever you please--is that it is  closed, and is not going to be reopened while I'm ruler here.\"    The deputation then withdrew, reluctantly.           *       *       *       *       *    On the following morning there came a note from Mr. Scobell. It was  brief. \"Come on down before the shooting begins,\" it ran. John tore it  up.    It was on the same evening that definite hostilities may be said to  have begun.    Between the Palace and the market-place there was a narrow street of  flagged stone, which was busy during the early part of the day but  deserted after sundown. Along this street, at about seven o'clock, John  was strolling with a cigarette, when he was aware of a man crouching,  with his back toward him. So absorbed was the man in something which he  was writing on the stones that he did not hear John's approach, and the  latter, coming up from behind was enabled to see over his shoulder. In  large letters of chalk he read the words: _\"Conspuez le Prince.\"_    John's knowledge of French was not profound, but he could understand  this, and it annoyed him.    As he looked, the man, squatting on his heels, bent forward to touch  up one of the letters. If he had been deliberately posing, he could  not have assumed a more convenient attitude.    John had been a footballer before he was a prince. The temptation was  too much for him. He drew back his foot--    There was a howl and a thud, and John resumed his stroll. The first gun  from Fort Sumter had been fired.           *       *       *       *       *    Early next morning a window at the rear of the palace was broken by a  stone, and toward noon one of the soldiers on guard in front of the  Casino was narrowly missed by an anonymous orange. For Mervo this was  practically equivalent to the attack on the Bastille, and John, when  the report of the atrocities was brought to him, became hopeful.    But the effort seemed temporarily to have exhausted the fury of the  mob. The rest of that day and the whole of the next passed without  sensation.    After breakfast on the following morning Mr. Crump paid a visit to the  Palace. John was glad to see him. The staff of the Palace were loyal,  but considered as cheery companions, they were handicapped by the fact  that they spoke no English, while John spoke no French.    Mr. Crump was the bearer of another note from Mr. Scobell. This time  John tore it up unread, and, turning to the secretary, invited him to  sit down and make himself at home.    Sipping a cocktail and smoking one of John's cigars, Mr. Crump became  confidential.    \"This is a queer business,\" he said. \"Old Ben is chewing pieces out of  the furniture up there. He's mad clean through. He's losing money all  the while the people are making up their minds about this thing, and it  beats him why they're so slow.\"    \"It beats me, too. I don't believe these hook-worm victims ever turned  my father out. Or, if they did, somebody must have injected radium into  them first. I'll give them another couple of days, and, if they haven't  fixed it by then, I'll go, and leave them to do what they like about  it.\"    \"Go! Do you want to go?\"    \"Of course I want to go! Do you think I like stringing along in this  musical comedy island? I'm crazy to get back to America. I don't blame  you, Crump, because it was not your fault, but, by George! if I had  known what you were letting me in for when you carried me off here, I'd  have called up the police reserves. Hello! What's this?\"    He rose to his feet as the sound of agitated voices came from the other  side of the door. The next moment it flew open, revealing General  Poineau and an assorted group of footmen and other domestics.  Excitement seemed to be in the air.    General Poineau rushed forward into the room, and flung his arms above  his head. Then he dropped them to his side, and shrugged his shoulders,  finishing in an attitude reminiscent of Plate 6 (\"Despair\") in \"The  Home Reciter.\"    \"_Mon Prince!\"_ he moaned.    A perfect avalanche of French burst from the group outside the door.    \"Crump!\" cried John. \"Stand by me, Crump! Get busy! This is where you  make your big play. Never mind the chorus gentlemen in the passage.  Concentrate yourself on Poineau. What's he talking about? I believe  he's come to tell me the people have wakened up. Offer him a cocktail.  What's the French for corpse-reviver? Get busy, Crump.\"    The general had begun to speak rapidly, with a wealth of gestures. It  astonished John that Mr. Crump could follow the harangue as apparently  he did.    \"Well?\" said John.    Mr. Crump looked grave.    \"He says there is a large mob in the market-place. They are talking--\"    \"They would be!\"    \"--of moving in force on the Palace. The Palace Guards have gone over  to the people. General Poineau urges you to disguise yourself and  escape while there is time. You will be safe at his villa till the  excitement subsides, when you can be smuggled over to France during the  night--\"    \"Not for mine,\" said John, shaking his head. \"It's mighty good of you,  General, and I appreciate it, but I can't wait till night. The boat  leaves for Marseilles in another hour. I'll catch that. I can manage it  comfortably. I'll go up and pack my grip. Crump, entertain the General  while I'm gone, will you? I won't be a moment.\"    But as he left the room there came through the open window the mutter  of a crowd. He stopped. General Poineau whipped out his sword, and  brought it to the salute. John patted him on the shoulder.    \"You're a sport, General,\" he said, \"but we sha'n't want it. Come  along, Crump. Come and help me address the multitude.\"    The window of the room looked out on to a square. There was a small  balcony with a stone parapet. As John stepped out, a howl of rage burst  from the mob.    John walked on to the balcony, and stood looking down on them, resting  his arms on the parapet. The howl was repeated, and from somewhere at  the back of the crowd came the sharp crack of a rifle, and a shot, the  first and last of the campaign, clipped a strip of flannel from the  collar of his coat and splashed against the wall.    A broad smile spread over his face.    If he had studied for a year, he could not have hit on a swifter or  more effective method of quieting the mob. There was something so  engaging and friendly in his smile that the howling died away and fists  that has been shaken unclenched themselves and fell. There was an  expectant silence in the square.    John beckoned to Crump, who came on to the balcony with some  reluctance, being mistrustful of the unseen sportsman with the rifle.    \"Tell 'em it's all right, Crump, and that there's no call for any fuss.  From their manner I gather that I am no longer needed on this throne.  Ask them if that's right?\"    A small man, who appeared to be in command of the crowd, stepped  forward as the secretary finished speaking, and shouted some words  which drew a murmur of approval from his followers.    \"He wants to know,\" interpreted Mr. Crump, \"if you will allow the  Casino to open again.\"    \"Tell him no, but add that I shall be tickled to death to abdicate, if  that's what they want. Speed them up, old man. Tell them to make up  their minds on the jump, because I want to catch that boat. Don't let  them get to discussing it, or they'll stand there talking till sunset.  Yes or no. That's the idea.\"    There was a moment's surprised silence when Mr. Crump had spoken. The  Mervian mind was unused to being hustled in this way. Then a voice  shouted, as it were tentatively, \"_Vive la Republique!\"_ and at  once the cry was taken up on all sides.    John beamed down on them.    \"That's right,\" he said. \"Bully! I knew you could get a move on as  quick as anyone else, if you gave your minds to it. This is what I call  something like a revolution. It's a model to every country in the  world. But I guess we must close down the entertainment now, or I shall  be missing the boat. Will you tell them, Crump, that any citizen who  cares for a drink and a cigar will find it in the Palace. Tell the  household staff to stand by to pull corks. It's dry work  revolutionizing. And now I really must be going. I've run it mighty  fine. Slip one of these fellows down there half a dollar and send him  to fetch a cab. I must step lively.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Five minutes later the revolutionists, obviously embarrassed and ill at  ease, were sheepishly gulping down their refreshment beneath the stony  eye of the majordomo and his assistants, while upstairs in the state"]]]
