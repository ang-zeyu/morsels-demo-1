It is never wanting to the diadem of the Pharaohs.]    raised its head crowned with a disk of rubies. From her left temple a  large tress, plaited with gold thread, hung down to her waist, the sign  of her royal birth. She wore a purple dress of fine, almost transparent  stuff, that was confined with a gold belt and straps. Round her throat  was fastened a necklace like a collar, made of pearls and costly stones,  and hanging low down on her well-formed bosom.    Behind the princess stood her charioteer, an old officer of noble birth.    Three litters followed the chariot of the princess, and in each sat  two officers of the court; then came a dozen of slaves ready for any  service, and lastly a crowd of wand-bearers to drive off the idle  populace, and of lightly-armed soldiers, who--dressed only in the apron  and head-cloth--each bore a dagger-shaped sword in his girdle, an axe  in his right hand, and in his left; in token of his peaceful service, a  palm-branch.    Like dolphins round a ship, little girls in long shirt-shaped garments  swarmed round the whole length of the advancing procession, bearing  water-jars on their steady heads, and at a sign from any one who was  thirsty were ready to give him a drink. With steps as light as the  gazelle they often outran the horses, and nothing could be more graceful  than the action with which the taller ones bent over with the water-jars  held in both arms to the drinker.    The courtiers, cooled and shaded by waving fans, and hardly perceiving  the noontide heat, conversed at their ease about indifferent matters,  and the princess pitied the poor horses, who were tormented as they ran,  by annoying gadflies; while the runners and soldiers, the litter-bearers  and fan-bearers, the girls with their jars and the panting slaves, were  compelled to exert themselves under the rays of the mid-day sun in the  service of their masters, till their sinews threatened to crack and  their lungs to burst their bodies.    At a spot where the road widened, and where, to the right, lay the steep  cross-valley where the last kings of the dethroned race were interred,  the procession stopped at a sign from Paaker, who preceded the princess,  and who drove his fiery black Syrian horses with so heavy a hand that  the bloody foam fell from their bits.    When the Mohar had given the reins into the hand of a servant, he sprang  from his chariot, and after the usual form of obeisance said to the  princess:    \"In this valley lies the loathsome den of the people, to whom thou, O  princess, dost deign to do such high honor. Permit me to go forward as  guide to thy party.\"    \"We will go on foot,\" said the princess, \"and leave our followers behind  here.\"    Paaker bowed, Bent-Anat threw the reins to her charioteer and sprang to  the ground, the wife of Mena and the courtiers left their litters, and  the fan-bearers and chamberlains were about to accompany their mistress  on foot into the little valley, when she turned round and ordered,  \"Remain behind, all of you. Only Paaker and Nefert need go with me.\"    The princess hastened forward into the gorge, which was oppressive with  the noon-tide heat; but she moderated her steps as soon as she observed  that the frailer Nefert found it difficult to follow her.    At a bend in the road Paaker stood still, and with him Bent-Anat and  Nefert. Neither of them had spoken a word during their walk. The valley  was perfectly still and deserted; on the highest pinnacles of the cliff,  which rose perpendicularly to the right, sat a long row of vultures, as  motionless as if the mid-day heat had taken all strength out of their  wings.    Paaker bowed before them as being the sacred animals of the Great  Goddess of Thebes,       [She formed a triad with Anion and Chunsu under the name of Muth.     The great \"Sanctuary of the kingdom\"--the temple of Karnak--was     dedicated to them.]    and the two women silently followed his example.    \"There,\" said the Mohar, pointing to two huts close to the left cliff of  the valley, built of bricks made of dried Nile-mud, \"there, the neatest,  next the cave in the rock.\"    Bent-Anat went towards the solitary hovel with a beating heart; Paaker  let the ladies go first. A few steps brought them to an ill-constructed  fence of canestalks, palm-branches, briars and straw, roughly thrown  together. A heart-rending cry of pain from within the hut trembled in  the air and arrested the steps of the two women. Nefert staggered and  clung to her stronger companion, whose beating heart she seemed to hear.  Both stood a few minutes as if spellbound, then the princess called  Paaker, and said:    \"You go first into the house.\"    Paaker bowed to the ground.    \"I will call the man out,\" he said, \"but how dare we step over his  threshold. Thou knowest such a proceeding will defile us.\"    Nefert looked pleadingly at Bent-Anat, but the princess repeated her  command.    \"Go before me; I have no fear of defilement.\" The Mohar still hesitated.    \"Wilt thou provoke the Gods?--and defile thyself?\" But the princess let  him say no more; she signed to Nefert, who raised her hands in horror  and aversion; so, with a shrug of her shoulders, she left her companion  behind with the Mohar, and stepped through an opening in the hedge into  a little court, where lay two brown goats; a donkey with his forelegs  tied together stood by, and a few hens were scattering the dust about in  a vain search for food.    Soon she stood, alone, before the door of the paraschites' hovel. No one  perceived her, but she could not take her eyes-accustomed only to scenes  of order and splendor--from the gloomy but wonderfully strange picture,  which riveted her attention and her sympathy. At last she went up to  the doorway, which was too low for her tall figure. Her heart shrunk  painfully within her, and she would have wished to grow smaller, and,  instead of shining in splendor, to have found herself wrapped in a  beggar's robe.    Could she step into this hovel decked with gold and jewels as if in  mockery?--like a tyrant who should feast at a groaning table and compel  the starving to look on at the banquet. Her delicate perception made  her feel what trenchant discord her appearance offered to all that  surrounded her, and the discord pained her; for she could not conceal  from herself that misery and external meanness were here entitled to  give the key-note and that her magnificence derived no especial grandeur  from contrast with all these modest accessories, amid dust, gloom, and  suffering, but rather became disproportionate and hideous, like a giant  among pigmies.    She had already gone too far to turn back, or she would willingly have  done so. The longer she gazed into the but, the more deeply she felt the  impotence of her princely power, the nothingness of the splendid gifts  with which she approached it, and that she might not tread the dusty  floor of this wretched hovel but in all humility, and to crave a pardon.    The room into which she looked was low but not very small, and obtained  from two cross lights a strange and unequal illumination; on one side  the light came through the door, and on the other through an opening in  the time-worn ceiling of the room, which had never before harbored so  many and such different guests.    All attention was concentrated on a group, which was clearly lighted up  from the doorway.    On the dusty floor of the room cowered an old woman, with dark  weather-beaten features and tangled hair that had long been grey. Her  black-blue cotton shirt was open over her withered bosom, and showed a  blue star tattooed upon it.    In her lap she supported with her hands the head of a girl, whose  slender body lay motionless on a narrow, ragged mat. The little white  feet of the sick girl almost touched the threshold. Near to them  squatted a benevolent-looking old man, who wore only a coarse apron, and  sitting all in a heap, bent forward now and then, rubbing the child's  feet with his lean hands and muttering a few words to himself.    The sufferer wore nothing but a short petticoat of coarse light-blue  stuff. Her face, half resting on the lap of the old woman, was graceful  and regular in form, her eyes were half shut-like those of a child,  whose soul is wrapped in some sweet dream-but from her finely chiselled  lips there escaped from time to time a painful, almost convulsive sob.    An abundance of soft, but disordered reddish fair hair, in which clung  a few withered flowers, fell over the lap of the old woman and on to  the mat where she lay. Her cheeks were white and rosy-red, and when  the young surgeon Nebsecht--who sat by her side, near his blind, stupid  companion, the litany-singer--lifted the ragged cloth that had been  thrown over her bosom, which had been crushed by the chariot wheel, or  when she lifted her slender arm, it was seen that she had the shining  fairness of those daughters of the north who not unfrequently came to  Thebes among the king's prisoners of war.    The two physicians sent hither from the House of Seti sat on the left  side of the maiden on a little carpet. From time to time one or the  other laid his hand over the heart of the sufferer, or listened to her  breathing, or opened his case of medicaments, and moistened the compress  on her wounded breast with a white ointment.    In a wide circle close to the wall of the room crouched several women,  young and old, friends of the paraschites, who from time to time gave  expression to their deep sympathy by a piercing cry of lamentation. One  of them rose at regular intervals to fill the earthen bowl by the side  of the physician with fresh water. As often as the sudden coolness of a  fresh compress on her hot bosom startled the sick girl, she opened  her eyes, but always soon to close them again for longer interval,  and turned them at first in surprise, and then with gentle reverence,  towards a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],[0,"An Egyptian Princess â€” Complete (#12)"],[1," at once  be involved in a hundred others, and we should not be the last to rise  up against our tyrants in the hour of their weakness!\"    \"Whatever the intentions of the envoys may be,\" continued Kallias, \"my  information remains unaltered; they will be here at the latest in three  days.\"    \"And so your oracle will be fulfilled, fortunate Aristomachus!\"  exclaimed Rhodopis, \"for see, the warrior hosts can only be the  Persians. When they descend to the shores of the Nile, then the powerful  Five,' your Ephori, will change their decision, and you, the father of  two Olympian victors, will be recalled to your native land.       [The five Ephori of Sparta were appointed to represent the absent     kings during the Messenian war. In later days the nobles made use     of the Ephori as a power, which, springing immediately from their     own body, they could oppose to the kingly authority. Being the     highest magistrates in all judicial and educational matters, and in     everything relating to the moral police of the country, the Ephori     soon found means to assert their superiority, and on most occasions     over that of the kings themselves. Every patrician who was past the     age of thirty, had the right to become a candidate yearly for the     office. Aristot. Potit, II. and IV. Laert. Diog. I. 68.]    \"Fill the goblets again, Knakias. Let us devote this last cup to the  manes of the glorious Lysander; and then I advise you to depart, for it  is long past midnight, and our pleasure has reached its highest point.  The true host puts an end to the banquet when his guests are feeling  at their best. Serene and agreeable recollections will soon bring you  hither again; whereas there would be little joy in returning to a house  where the remembrance of hours of weakness, the result of pleasure,  would mingle with your future enjoyment.\" In this her guests agreed,  and Ibykus named her a thorough disciple of Pythagoras, in praise of the  joyous, festive evening.    Every one prepared for departure. The Sybarite, who had been drinking  deeply in order to counteract the very inconvenient amount of feeling  excited by the conversation, rose also, assisted by his slaves, who had  to be called in for this purpose.    While he was being moved from his former comfortable position, he  stammered something about a \"breach of hospitality;\" but, when  Rhodopis was about to give him her hand at parting, the wine gained the  ascendancy and he exclaimed, \"By Hercules, Rhodopis, you get rid of  us as if we were troublesome creditors. It is not my custom to leave a  supper so long as I can stand, still less to be turned out of doors like  a miserable parasite!\"    \"Hear reason, you immoderate Sybarite,\" began Rhodopis, endeavoring  with a smile to excuse her proceeding. But these words, in Philoinus'  half-intoxicated mood, only increased his irritation; he burst into a  mocking laugh, and staggering towards the door, shouted: \"Immoderate  Sybarite, you call me? good! here you have your answer: Shameless  slave! one can still perceive the traces of what you were in your youth.  Farewell then, slave of Iadmon and Xanthus, freedwoman of Charaxus!\"  He had not however finished his sentence, when Aristomachus rushed upon  him, stunned him with a blow of his fist, and carried him off like  a child down to the boat in which his slaves were waiting at the  garden-gate.          CHAPTER III.    The guests were all gone. Their departing mirth and joy had been smitten  down by the drunkard's abusive words, like fresh young corn beneath  a hail storm. Rhodopis was left standing alone in the empty, brightly  decorated (supper-room). Knakias extinguished the colored lamps on  the walls, and a dull, mysterious half-light took the place of their  brilliant rays, falling scantily and gloomily on the piled-up plates and  dishes, the remnants of the meal, and the seats and cushions, pushed out  of their places by the retiring guests. A cold breeze came through the  open door, for the dawn was at hand, and just before sunrise, the air is  generally unpleasantly cool in Egypt. A cold chill struck the limbs of  the aged woman through her light garments. She stood gazing tearlessly  and fixedly into the desolate room, whose walls but a few minutes before  had been echoing with joy and gladness, and it seemed to her that the  deserted guest-chamber must be like her own heart. She felt as if a worm  were gnawing there, and the warm blood congealing into ice.    Lost in these thoughts, she remained standing till at last her old  female slave appeared to light her to her sleeping apartment.    Silently Rhodopis allowed herself to be undressed, and then, as  silently, lifted the curtain which separated a second sleeping apartment  from her own. In the middle of this second room stood a bedstead of  maplewood, and there, on white sheets spread over a mattress of fine  sheep's wool, and protected from the cold by bright blue coverlets's,  lay a graceful, lovely girl asleep; this was Rhodopis' granddaughter,  Sappho. The rounded form and delicate figure seemed to denote one  already in opening maidenhood, but the peaceful, blissful smile could  only belong to a harmless, happy child.    One hand lay under her head, hidden among the thick dark brown hair, the  other clasped unconsciously a little amulet of green stone, which hung  round her neck. Over her closed eyes the long lashes trembled almost  imperceptibly, and a delicate pink flush came and went on the cheek of  the slumberer. The finely-cut nostrils rose and fell with her regular  breathing, and she lay there, a picture of innocence, of peace, smiling  in dreams, and of the slumber that the gods bestow on early youth, when  care has not yet come.    Softly and carefully, crossing the thick carpets on tiptoe, the  grey-haired woman approached, looked with unutterable tenderness into  the smiling, childish face, and, kneeling down silently by the side of  the bed, buried her face in its soft coverings, so that the girl's  hand just came in contact with her hair. Then she wept, and without  intermission; as though she hoped with this flood of tears to wash away  not only her recent humiliation, but with it all other sorrow from her  mind.    At length she rose, breathed a light kiss on the sleeping girl's  forehead, raised her hands in prayer towards heaven, and returned to her  own room, gently and carefully as she had come.    At her own bedside she found the old slave-woman, still waiting for her.    \"What do you want so late, Melitta?\" said Rhodopis, kindly, under her  breath. \"Go to bed; at your age it is not good to remain up late, and  you know that I do not require you any longer. Good night! and do not  come to-morrow until I send for you. I shall not be able to sleep  much to-night, and shall be thankful if the morning brings me a short  repose.\"    The woman hesitated; it seemed that she had some thing on her mind which  she feared to utter.    \"There is something you want to ask me?\" said Rhodopis.    Still the old slave hesitated.    \"Speak!\" said Rhodopis, \"speak at once, and quickly.\"    \"I saw you weeping,\" said the slave-woman, \"you seem ill or sad; let me  watch this night by your bedside. Will you not tell me what ails you?  You have often found that to tell a sorrow lightens the heart and  lessens the pain. Then tell me your grief to-day too; it will do you  good, it will bring back peace to your mind.\"    \"No,\" answered the other, \"I cannot utter it.\" And then she continued,  smiling bitterly: \"I have once more experienced that no one, not even a  god, has power to cancel the past of any human being, and that, in this  world, misfortune and disgrace are one and the same. Good night, leave  me; Melitta!\"    At noon on the following day, the same boat, which, the evening before,  had carried the Athenian and the Spartan, stopped once more before  Rhodopis' garden.    The sun was shining so brightly, so warmly and genially in the dark blue  Egyptian sky, the air was so pure and light, the beetles were humming so  merrily, the boatmen singing so lustily and happily, the shores of  the Nile bloomed in such gay, variegated beauty, and were so thickly  peopled, the palm-trees, sycamores, bananas and acacias were so  luxuriant in foliage and blossom, and over the whole landscape the  rarest and most glorious gifts seemed to have been poured out with such  divine munificence, that a passer-by must have pronounced it the very  home of joy and gladness, a place from which sadness and sorrow had been  forever banished.    How often we fancy, in passing a quiet village hidden among its  orchards, that this at least must be the abode of peace, and unambitious  contentment! But alas! when we enter the cottages, what do we find?  there, as everywhere else, distress and need, passion and unsatisfied  longing, fear and remorse, pain and misery; and by the side of these,  Ah! how few joys! Who would have imagined on coming to Egypt, that this  luxuriant, laughing sunny land, whose sky is always unclouded, could  possibly produce and nourish men given to bitterness and severity? that  within the charming, hospitable house of the fortunate Rhodopis, covered  and surrounded, as it was, with sweet flowers, a heart could have been  beating in the deepest sadness? And, still more, who among all the  guests of that honored, admired Thracian woman, would have believed  that this sad heart belonged to her? to the gracious, smiling matron,  Rhodopis herself?    She was sitting with Phanes in a shady arbor near the cooling spray of  a fountain. One could see that she had been weeping again, but her face  was beautiful and kind as ever. The Athenian was holding her hand and  trying to comfort her.    Rhodopis listened patiently, and smiled the while; at times her smile  was bitter, at others it gave assent to his words. At last however she  interrupted her well-intentioned friend, by saying:    \"Phanes, I"]]]
