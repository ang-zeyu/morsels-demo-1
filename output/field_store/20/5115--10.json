That was sufficient--the  would-be outlaws abandoned their evil designs for fear of signal  punishment; but the supposed pistol which caused their alarm and my  protection, was my pocket Bible, a precious gift to me from the dearly  beloved Patriarch, Father Joseph Smith.    On another occasion, while addressing a congregation in a dwelling  house, in fulfilment of a previous arrangement by a lawless set, to  throw a rope over my head and then drag me to the river and duck me  through a hole in the ice, one of the fellows who was in front of me  was in the act of throwing his lariat, when he was discovered by the  mistress of the house, who instantly gave the alarm, and he sneaked out  of the congregation like a whipped dog.        CHAPTER VII.    Leaves Kentucky.--Travels on foot five hundred miles.--Reaches his  friends in Ohio.--Through fatigue and exposure, is very sick.--Receives  kind attention.--Traveled and preached.--Taught school.--Great effort,  and great success.--A thrilling narrative.--Arrives in Nauvoo.--The  Father and Family in LaHarpe.    On the last of February, 1839, I left the State of Kentucky with one  dollar and twenty-five cents in my pocket, to visit my former home in  Ohio, and to settle up some unfinished business, having received, by  letter from my sister Eliza, the news of the expulsion of our people  from Missouri. The distance of the journey before me was about five  hundred miles, and in the worst season of the year for traveling,  and at a time when very little interest was felt by the people for  Gospel truths, and few opportunities afforded for public preaching.  The trip was a tedious one--on foot and in the midst of snow and rain  storms--sometimes hard, frozen ground--sometimes mud and water soaking  through my boots until my socks were wringing wet at night, and of  course, hard and stiff in the morning when I was fortunate enough to  get them dry. It was a hard pull, but I accomplished the feat, and worn  out by fatigue and exposure, I arrived among my friends in Ohio.    The first place I reached was a Brother Smith's, where one year before  I had performed missionary labors--preached and baptized, and, at his  house, made my home. Fatigue and its consequences had so changed my  appearance, that at first Brother Smith and family did not recognize  me. As soon as recognized, and my condition known, every attention  was extended that kindness could suggest, and everything done for my  comfort that warm hearts and willing hands could bestow. Then came a  reaction of the overstraining of my physical powers, and with a burning  fever, I was confined to my bed, and for days remained in a prostrate  condition, when, through the kind ministrations of my friends and the  blessing of God in the manifestations of His power, I soon recovered,  and resumed my missionary labors.    The summer and fall I spent principally traveling and preaching in the  northern part of Ohio. In the winter of 1839 and 1840, I was employed  in teaching a district school in the township of Shalersville, Portage  County, Ohio. The school was large, and its patrons all Gentiles with  the exception of one family. Previous to this time, the directors had  been very unfortunate in the selection of teachers; consequently the  scholars were, in their studies, far behind adjacent schools. Here  an opportunity presented for me to make a mark, and I determined to  do it, and set myself to the arduous task of arousing and instilling  intellectual life into the mentally dormant brain. I labored day  and night to accomplish my purpose, _i. e_., to elevate my students  to a higher standard of intellectual improvement. I succeeded, and  before its close, my school had attained to such celebrity, that it  was everywhere spoken of for its wonderful progress, and as having  outstripped all of the neighboring schools.    But my extra exertions told seriously on my physical system, as the  following little incident will illustrate: One evening I was in company  with a gentleman who was with Napoleon Bonaparte's army in its retreat  from Moscow. He possessed peculiar descriptive powers, and portrayed so  lifelike the terrible scenes of suffering and death he had witnessed  in that memorable defeat, that my mind was entirely absorbed, and my  feelings and sympathies so aroused and carried along with him in his  thrilling narrative, that my bodily strength was completely overcome,  and I suddenly fainted and fell from my chair. This circumstance  admonished me of the necessity of rest, of which I availed myself, and  soon regained my usual health.    After having arranged my secular affairs, I took leave of my friends  and kindred in Ohio, and started for Nauvoo, where I arrived about the  first of May, 1840. I found my parents, brothers and sisters, whom I  had left about eighteen months before, in Adam-ondi-Ahman, living in  LaHarpe, about thirty miles from Nauvoo. O, what changes, privation,  hardship and suffering, the cruel hand of persecution had produced in  those eventful months! But God was with His people, and they knew in  whom they trusted, and in the midst of severe trials, rejoiced that  they were counted worthy to suffer for the truth's sake.        CHAPTER VIII.    In Di-Ahman.--Our father's purchases.--Friendliness of the \"old  settlers.\"--A spirit of hostility prevalent.--Millers would not grind  our wheat.--Grating corn for our bread.--How we cooked the grated  meal.--A strange move; the old settlers abscond.--Their reports in the  surrounding country.--The Military quells the uprising.--A horse mill  in operation.--Mobs arouse with increased force.--Government sends  Militia.--They are set to guard the Saints, who are ordered to leave  the county within ten days.--The halfway house.--Food frozen.--How we  ate supper.--Sleepless and jolly.--Arrive in Far West.--Seven miles  out.--Move to Illinois.--To Warren County.--To LaHarpe.--To Nauvoo.    We will now leave Lorenzo in LaHarpe, preparing for a visit to  Nauvoo, and return to Adam-ondi-Ahman, where he left us. In Di-Ahman,  Daviess County, Missouri, our father purchased and paid in full for  two homesteads, including the farm crops. The \"old settlers,\" as the  inhabitants were called, were very anxious to sell to the Latter-day  Saints, who, at the time, did not comprehend nor suspect their  villainy. They were obsequiously kind and friendly in their manner  towards us as strangers, and we did not, for the time being, suspect  their sincerity; but the sequel proved that they had made arrangements  for mobbing and driving us, previous to selling, and then, according to  their programme, re-take possession of the purchased premises.    Before Lorenzo started on his southern mission, as reported in his  journal, a spirit of mobocracy was boldly manifested by leading  citizens in the county opposing the Latter-day Saints, and at the  August election preventing their vote--also putting them to great  inconvenience by laying an embargo on all of the flouring mills in  that section, and preventing our people from obtaining breadstuff.  Our father had abundance of wheat, but could get no grinding. In this  dilemma we had to resort to graters, made by perforating tin pails  and stovepipes, on which we grated corn for bread material. We tried  boiled wheat, but found that it did not retain much nourishment; and  our grated corn meal, when cooked by the usual process of bread making,  was not quite so solid as lead, but bore a more than satisfactory  resemblance to it. \"Necessity, the mother of invention,\" prompted  experimenting, and we set our wits to work to make our meal not only  _eatable_, but palatable.    We had a fine crop of \"Missouri pumpkins\" (which, being interpreted,  means the choicest kind), produced from the soil our father bought;  these we stewed with a good supply of moisture, and when boiling hot,  stirred it into our grated meal, which, when seasoned with salt and  nicely baked--well buttered or in milk, was really very delicious; the  main thing was to get enough, especially after the mob had driven in  the scattered settlers, by which the number of our family was increased  to twenty-five.    Elder Abel Butterfield, Lorenzo's traveling companion, was stopping  with us, while waiting for my brother to regain his strength sufficient  for travel, and as he required clothing made, previous to departure,  my sister proposed to join me in doing his needle work, tailoring,  etc., if he would give his time in grating meal for the family, which  he gladly accepted. It was hard work, and after he left, we took it by  turns, soaking the corn when it became so dry as to shell from the cob.    Not long after our young missionaries left us, very early one morning,  we were utterly astonished with the announcement that all of our  neighbors, the \"old settlers,\" including those of whom our father  had purchased, had fled the country. On entering some of the vacated  houses, clocks were seen ticking the time, coffee-pots boiling the  coffee, and everything indicating a precipitate and compulsory flight.  What could be the cause, and what the meaning of this unprecedented and  really ominous movement was veiled in the deepest mystery, until the  reaction solved it by bringing to light the most cruel perfidy. We soon  learned that those unscrupulous hypocrites had scattered abroad through  the settlements, arousing a mob feeling against the Latter-day Saints,  by reporting that the \"Mormons\" had driven them from their homes, they  having barely escaped with their lives at the expense of all they  possessed.    This unprecedented move was sufficient pretext for an onslaught, and a  general uprising of the people threatened an immediate extermination  of the Latter-day Saints, which was prevented by an appeal to, and the  intervention of, the military authority of the State. A posse was sent,  which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47730"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 1 of 2) (#12)"],[1,"Mountain Meadows massacre, that he  may die--according to orthodox dramatic canons--at the place where  his awful crime was committed. He is followed by Prudence and young  Follett, who come up to him at the cross erected by Gentile hands on  the site of the massacre, where, in company with two Indians, they  watched him peacefully pass away in a rather protracted death scene,  to the accompaniment of an Indian tom-tom drum, and notwithstanding  one of the redmen waves before his eyes the yellow scalp-lock which  years before he had seen reeking with blood snatched from the head  of the woman he loved. Young Follett and Prudence, as soon as the  \"little man of sorrows\" is buried, leave for the east with a passing  wagon train, and having been married by Rae a few minutes before his  death, the reader is left to infer that they \"lived happily ever  after,\" in some eastern city, far, far away from fanatical Mormons,  and their wickedness, where only monogamous marriages obtain, and  conjugal happiness is never disturbed by the haunting fears of marital  infidelities, or polygamy, simultaneous or consecutive.    I have been at the pains to give this rather full synopsis of the  story, that my readers may be witnesses of the fact that Mr. Wilson has  certainly massed enough of gruesome materials to furnish to repletion  several chambers of horrors. Far be it from me to suggest that so  prominent an author has stooped to the methods of yellow-backed,  ten-cent novelists of a quarter of a century ago, in the matter at  least of the quality and mass of incidents to be woven into story.  This glance at the incidents of the story also reveals the opportunity  they will afford the author for gathering into one view the bigotry,  ignorance, weakness, fanaticism, and wickedness of individual Mormons,  all to be interwoven with the mockery, sarcasm, ridicule, ribaldry,  innuendo and insults of their enemies.    And now, as to the treatment of the theme. The author of the \"Lions of  the Lord\" in his opening chapter--the prettiest piece of descriptive  writing in the book--has drawn heavily upon, if he has not actually  plagiarized from, the lecture of the late General Thomas L. Kane, of  Philadelphia, delivered before the Historical Society of Pennsylvania,  on March 26, 1850. Mr. Wilson heads his first chapter \"The Dead City,\"  meaning Nauvoo after the departure of the last of the Mormons. Mr.  Kane opens his Lecture under the caption \"The Deserted City,\" meaning  Nauvoo after the departure of the last of the Mormons. Mr. Wilson makes  his hero, Joel Rae, enter the \"dead city\" in \"September.\" Mr. Kane  enters \"the deserted city\" late in the \"autumn.\" Mr. Wilson's hero  \"from a skiff in mid-river\" views the temple on the hill top; presently  \"landing at the wharf, he was stunned by the hush of the streets.\" Mr.  Kane \"procured a skiff,\" and rowing across the river, \"landed at the  chief wharf of the city. No one met me there. I looked and saw no one.  I could hear no one move, though the quiet everywhere was such that I  could hear the flies buzz.\"    The closeness with which Mr. Wilson follows Mr. Kane's beautifully  descriptive passages, however, will best be seen and appreciated when  placed in parallel paragraphs, as follows:    [Left column:] Mr. Wilson. \"The Dead City.\"    [Right column:] Mr. Kane. \"The Deserted City.\"    [Wilson] \"The city without life lay handsomely along a river in the  early sunlight of a September morning.....From the half-circle around  which the broad river bent its moody current, the neat houses, set in  cool green gardens, were terraced up the high hill, and from the summit  of this a stately marble temple, glittering of newness, towered far  above them in placid benediction.\"    [Kane] \"Half encircled by the bend of the river, a beautiful city lay  glittering in the fresh [autumn] morning sun; its bright new dwellings,  set in cool green gardens, ranging up around a stately dome shaped hill  which was crowned by a noble marble edifice, whose high tapering spire  was radiant with white and gold.\"    [Wilson] \"Mile after mile the streets lay silent, along the river  front, up to the hilltop, and beyond into the level....And when they  had run their length, and the outlying fields were reached, there, too,  the same brooding spell-and the land stretched away in the hush and  haze.\"    [Kane] \"The city appeared to cover several miles; and beyond it, in the  background, there rolled off a fair country, checquered by the careful  lines of fruitful husbandry.\"    [Wilson] \"The yellow grain, heavy-headed with richness, lay beaten down  and rotting, for there were no reapers. The city, it seemed, had died  calmly, painlessly, drowsily, as if overcome by sleep.\"    [Kane] \"Fields upon fields of heavy headed yellow grain lay rotting  ungathered upon the ground. No one was at hand to take in their rich  harvest. As far as the eye could reach, they stretched away, they  sleeping, too, in the hazy air of autumn.\"    [Wilson]: \"He started wonderingly up a street that led from the i  waterside. . . . He was now passing empty workshops, hesitating door  after door with ever mounting alarm. . . . . Growing bolder, he tried  some of the doors and found them to yield. . . . . He passed an  empty rode walk, the hemp strewn about, as if the workers had left  hurriedly. He peered curiously at idle looms and deserted spinning  wheels--deserted apparently but the instant before he came. . . He  entered a carpenter's shop. On the bench was an unfinished door, a  plane where it had been shoved half the length of its edge, the fresh  pine shaving still curling over the side. . . . . He turned into a  baker's shop and saw freshly chopped kindling piled against the oven,  and dough actually on the kneading tray. In a tanner's vat he found  fresh bark. In a blacksmith's shod he entered next the fire was out,  but there was coal headed beside the forge, with the ladling pool and  the crooked water horn, and on the anvil was a horseshoe that had  cooled before it was finished.\"    [Kane] \"I walked through the solitary streets. . . . I went about  unchecked. I went into empty workshops, ropewalks and smithies.    [Kane] The spinner's wheel was idle; the carpenter had gone from his  work bench and shavings, his unfinished sash and casing.    [Kane] Fresh bark was in the tanner's vat, and the fresh chopped  lightwood stood piled against the baker's oven.    [Kane] The blacksmith shop was cold, but his coal heap, and lading  pool, and crooked water horn were all there as if he had just gone off  for a holiday.\"    [Wilson] \"He entered one of the gardens, clinking the gate-latch loudly  after him, but no one challenged. He drew a drink from the Well with  its loud rattling chain and clumsy water-bucket, but no one called.  At the door of the house he pounded, and at last flung it open with  all the noise he could make. Still his hungry ears fed on nothing but  sinister echoes, and barren husks of his clamour. There was no curt  voice of a man, no quick questioning tread of a woman. There were dead  white ashes on the hearth, and the silence was grimly kept by the dumb  household gods.\"    [Kane] \"If I went into the gardens, linking the wicket latch after me,  to pull the marigolds, heart's ease and lady slippers and draw a drink  with the water-sodden bucket and its noisy chain, or knocked off with  my stick the tall headed dahlias and sunflowers, hunting over the beds  for cucumbers and love-apples; no one called out to me from any open  window, or dog sprang forward to bark alarm. I could have supposed  the people hidden in their houses, but the doors were unfastened; and  when at last I timidly entered them, I found dead ashes white upon the  hearth, and had to tread a-tip-toe as if walking down the aisles of a  country church.\"    Mr. Wilson certainly has a remarkably similar taste to that of  Colonel Kane for flowers and gardens. Young Rae meets Prudence in the  gardens--now observe:    [Left column:] Mr. Wilson.    [Right column:] Mr. Kane.    [Wilson] \"He ran to her--over beds of marigolds, heart's ease and lady  slippers, through a row of drowsy looking heavy headed dahlias, and  passed other withering flowers, all but choked out by the rank garden  growths of late summer.\"    [Kane] \"If I went into the gardens. . . to pull the marigolds, heart's  ease and lady slippers, . . . or knock off the tall, heavy headed  dahlias and the sunflowers, hunting over the beds for cucumbers and  love-apples--no one called out to me.\"    After Mr. Wilson had followed General Kane in the matter of flowers  so closely, one marvels that he did not go with him as far as the  \"sunflowers and love-apples;\" but General Kane was hunting \"over beds  of cucumbers,\" and perhaps the author of the \"Lions of the Lord\" found  that his taste for vegetables did not run so closely with the General's  in the vegetable line as in the matter of flowers. But seriously, does  not the code of ethics in literature require that our rising young  author should either have the grace to put these descriptive passages  in quotation marks, or else frankly give the source whence he draws  the prettiest bits of description in his much-vaunted book? In the  event of the work reaching a second edition, I suggest that he adopt  the whole of General Kane's description of \"The Deserted City,\" for  his opening chapter; for beautiful as his own is, it but shines with  a borrowed light, and when compared with the General's it appears to  great disadvantage.    A word as to the purpose of the \"Lions of the Lord;\" for Mr. Wilson's  performance must be classified with the \"purpose novel.\" Undoubtedly  there is such a thing as instructive fiction, and the \"purpose  novel\" has its place as one of the agencies which contribute to the  enlightenment of humanity. But if it takes hold of our respect it must  be, in harmony with the truth--though fiction, it must speak truly; and  "]]]
