[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4386"],[0,"Life of Chopin (#12)"],[1," woman  they loved, is one of the most original traditions of the enthusiastic  gallantry if the Poles.] Through the secrets of these \"divine  coquetries\" those adorable beings are formed, who are alone capable  of fulfilling the impassioned ideals of poets who, like M. de  Chateaubriand, in the feverish sleeplessness of their adolescence,  create for themselves visions \"of an Eve, innocent, yet fallen; ignorant  of all, yet knowing all; mistress, yet virgin.\" [Footnote: Memoires  d'Outre Tombe. 1st vol. Incantation.] The only being which was ever  found to resemble this dream, was a Polish girl of seventeen--\"a mixture  of the Odalisque and Valkyria... realization of the ancient sylph--new  Flora--freed from the chain of the seasons\" [Footnote: Idem. 3d vol.  Atala.]--and whom M. de Chateaubriand feared to meet again. \"Divine  coquetries\" at once generous and avaricious; impressing the floating,  wavy, rocking, undecided motion of a boat without rigging or oars upon  the charmed and intoxicated heart!    Through his peculiar style of performance, Chopin imparted this constant  rocking with the most fascinating effect; thus making the melody  undulate to and fro, like a skiff driven on over the bosom of tossing  waves. This manner of execution, which set a seal so peculiar upon his  own style of playing, was at first indicated by the term 'tempo rubato',  affixed to his writings: a Tempo agitated, broken, interrupted, a  movement flexible, yet at the same time abrupt and languishing, and  vacillating as the flame under the fluctuating breath by which it is  agitated. In his later productions we no longer find this mark. He was  convinced that if the performer understood them, he would divine this  rule of irregularity. All his compositions should be played with this  accentuated and measured swaying and balancing. It is difficult for  those who have not frequently heard him play to catch this secret of  their proper execution. He seemed desirous of imparting this style  to his numerous pupils, particularly those of his own country. His  countrymen, or rather his countrywomen, seized it with the facility  with which they understand every thing relating to poetry or feeling; an  innate, intuitive comprehension of his meaning aided them in following  all the fluctuations of his depths of aerial and spiritual blue.        CHAPTER IV.    Chopin's Mode of Playing--Concerts--The Elite--Fading Bouquets and  Immortal Crowns--Hospitality--Heine--Meyerbeer--Adolphe Nourrit--Eugene  Delacroix--Niemcevicz--Mickiewicz--George Sand.        AFTER having described the compositions palpitating with emotion in  which genius struggles with grief, (grief, that terrible reality which  Art must strive to reconcile with Heaven), confronting it sometimes  as conqueror, sometimes as conquered; compositions in which all the  memories of his youth, the affections of his heart, the mysteries of his  desires, the secrets of his untold passions, are collected like tears  in a lachrymatory; compositions in which, passing the limits of human  sensations--too dull for his eager fancy, too obtuse for his keen  perceptions--he makes incursions into the realms of Dryads, Oreads, and  Oceanides;--we would naturally be expected to speak of his talent  for execution. But this task we cannot assume. We cannot command the  melancholy courage to exhume emotions linked with our fondest memories,  our dearest personal recollections; we cannot force ourselves to make  the mournful effort to color the gloomy shrouds, veiling the skill we  once loved, with the brilliant hues they would exact at our hands. We  feel our loss too bitterly to attempt such an analysis. And what result  would it be possible to attain with all our efforts! We could not hope  to convey to those who have never heard him, any just conception of that  fascination so ineffably poetic, that charm subtle and penetrating  as the delicate perfume of the vervain or the Ethiopian calla, which,  shrinking and exclusive, refuses to diffuse its exquisite aroma in the  noisome breath of crowds, whose heavy air can only retain the stronger  odor of the tuberose, the incense of burning resin.    By the purity of its handling, by its relation with LA FEE AUX MIETTES  and LES LUTINS D'ARGAIL, by its rencounters with the SERAPHINS and  DIANES, who murmur in his ear their most confidential complaints, their  most secret dreams, the style and the manner of conception of Chopin  remind us of Nodier. He knew that he did not act upon the masses, that  he could not warm the multitude, which is like a sea of lead, and as  heavy to set in motion, and which, though its waves may be melted and  rendered malleable by heat, requires the powerful arm of an athletic  Cyclops to manipulate, fuse, and pour into moulds, where the dull  metal, glowing and seething under the electric fire, becomes thought and  feeling under the new form into which it has been forced. He knew he was  only perfectly appreciated in those meetings, unfortunately too few,  in which ALL his hearers were prepared to follow him into those spheres  which the ancients imagined to be entered only through a gate of ivory,  to be surrounded by pilasters of diamond, and surmounted by a dome  arched with fawn-colored crystal, upon which played the various dyes of  the prism; spheres, like the Mexican opal, whose kaleidoscopical foci  are dimmed by olive-colored mists veiling and unveiling the inner  glories; spheres, in which all is magical and supernatural, reminding  us of the marvellous worlds of realized dreams. In such spheres Chopin  delighted. He once remarked to a friend, an artist who has since been  frequently heard: \"I am not suited for concert giving; the public  intimidate me; their looks, only stimulated by curiosity, paralyze me;  their strange faces oppress me; their breath stifles me: but you--you  are destined for it, for when you do not gain your public, you have the  force to assault, to overwhelm, to control, to compel them.\"    Conscious of how much was necessary for the comprehension of his  peculiar talent, he played but rarely in public. With the exception of  some concerts given at his debut in 1831, in Vienna and Munich, he gave  no more, except in Paris, being indeed not able to travel on account of  his health, which was so precarious, that during entire months, he would  appear to be in an almost dying state. During the only excursion which  he made with a hope that the mildness of a Southern climate would be  more conducive to his health, his condition was frequently so alarming,  that more than once the hotel keepers demanded payment for the bed and  mattress he occupied, in order to have them burned, deeming him already  arrived at that stage of consumption in which it becomes so highly  contagious We believe, however, if we may be permitted to say it, that  his concerts were less fatiguing to his physical constitution, than to  his artistic susceptibility. We think that his voluntary abnegation of  popular applause veiled an internal wound. He was perfectly aware of his  own superiority; perhaps it did not receive sufficient reverberation  and echo from without to give him the tranquil assurance that he was  perfectly appreciated. No doubt, in the absence of popular acclamation,  he asked himself how far a chosen audience, through the enthusiasm  of its applause, was able to replace the great public which he  relinquished. Few understood him:--did those few indeed understand him  aright? A gnawing feeling of discontent, of which he himself scarcely  comprehended the cause, secretly undermined him. We have seen him  almost shocked by eulogy. The praise to which he was justly entitled not  reaching him EN MASSE, he looked upon isolated commendation as almost  wounding. That he felt himself not only slightly, but badly applauded,  was sufficiently evident by the polished phrases with which, like  troublesome dust, he shook such praises off, making it quite evident  that he preferred to be left undisturbed in the enjoyment of his  solitary feelings to injudicious commendation.    Too fine a connoisseur in raillery, too ingenious satirist ever to  expose himself to sarcasm, he never assumed the role of a \"genius  misunderstood.\" With a good grace and under an apparent satisfaction, he  concealed so entirely the wound given to his just pride, that its very  existence was scarcely suspected. But not without reason, might the  gradually increasing rarity [Footnote: Sometimes he passed years without  giving a single concert. We believe the one given by him in Pleyel's  room, in 1844, was after an interval of nearly ten years] of his  concerts be attributed rather to the wish he felt to avoid occasions  which did not bring him the tribute he merited, than to physical  debility. Indeed, he put his strength to rude proofs in the many lessons  which he always gave, and the many hours he spent at his own Piano.    It is to be regretted that the indubitable advantage for the artist  resulting from the cultivation of only a select audience, should be so  sensibly diminished by the rare and cold expression of its sympathies.  The GLACE which covers the grace of the ELITE, as it does the fruit of  their desserts; the imperturbable calm of their most earnest enthusiasm,  could not be satisfactory to Chopin. The poet, torn from his solitary  inspiration, can only find it again in the interest, more than  attentive, vivid and animated of his audience. He can never hope to  regain it in the cold looks of an Areopagus assembled to judge him. He  must FEEL that he moves, that he agitates those who hear him, that his  emotions find in them the responsive sympathies of the same intuitions,  that he draws them on with him in his flight towards the infinite: as  when the leader of a winged train gives the signal of departure, he is  immediately followed by the whole flock in search of milder shores.    But had it been otherwise--had Chopin"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4389"],[0,"Roughing It in the Bush (#12)"],[1,"and disappointment, and my  laziness, will end in the same thing, and we shall both return  like bad pennies to our native shores. But, as I have neither  wife nor child to involve in my failure, I think, without much  self-flattery, that my prospects are better than yours.\"    This was the longest speech I ever heard Tom utter; and, evidently  astonished at himself, he sprang abruptly from the table, overset a  cup of coffee into my lap, and wishing us _good day_ (it was eleven  o'clock at night), he ran out of the house.    There was more truth in poor Tom's words than at that moment we  were willing to allow; for youth and hope were on our side in those  days, and we were most ready to believe the suggestions of the  latter.    My husband finally determined to emigrate to Canada, and in the  hurry and bustle of a sudden preparation to depart, Tom and his  affairs for a while were forgotten.    How dark and heavily did that frightful anticipation weigh upon my  heart! As the time for our departure drew near, the thought of  leaving my friends and native land became so intensely painful that  it haunted me even in sleep. I seldom awoke without finding my  pillow wet with tears. The glory of May was upon the earth--of an  English May. The woods were bursting into leaf, the meadows and  hedge-rows were flushed with flowers, and every grove and copsewood  echoed to the warblings of birds and the humming of bees. To leave  England at all was dreadful--to leave her at such a season was  doubly so. I went to take a last look at the old Hall, the beloved  home of my childhood and youth; to wander once more beneath the  shade of its venerable oaks--to rest once more upon the velvet  sward that carpeted their roots. It was while reposing beneath  those noble trees that I had first indulged in those delicious  dreams which are a foretaste of the enjoyments of the spirit-land.  In them the soul breathes forth its aspirations in a language  unknown to common minds; and that language is Poetry. Here  annually, from year to year, I had renewed my friendship with the  first primroses and violets, and listened with the untiring ear of  love to the spring roundelay of the blackbird, whistled from among  his bower of May blossoms. Here, I had discoursed sweet words to  the tinkling brook, and learned from the melody of waters the music  of natural sounds. In these beloved solitudes all the holy emotions  which stir the human heart in its depths had been freely poured  forth, and found a response in the harmonious voice of Nature,  bearing aloft the choral song of earth to the throne of the Creator.    How hard it was to tear myself from scenes endeared to me by the  most beautiful and sorrowful recollections, let those who have  loved and suffered as I did, say. However the world had frowned  upon me, Nature, arrayed in her green loveliness, had ever smiled  upon me like an indulgent mother, holding out her loving arms to  enfold to her bosom her erring but devoted child.    Dear, dear England! why was I forced by a stern necessity to leave  you? What heinous crime had I committed, that I, who adored you,  should be torn from your sacred bosom, to pine out my joyless  existence in a foreign clime? Oh, that I might be permitted to  return and die upon your wave-encircled shores, and rest my weary  head and heart beneath your daisy-covered sod at last! Ah, these  are vain outbursts of feeling--melancholy relapses of the spring  home-sickness! Canada! thou art a noble, free, and rising  country--the great fostering mother of the orphans of civilisation.  The offspring of Britain, thou must be great, and I will and do  love thee, land of my adoption, and of my children's birth; and,  oh, dearer still to a mother's heart-land of their graves!                                * * * * * *      Whilst talking over our coming separation with my sister C----, we  observed Tom Wilson walking slowly up the path that led to the  house. He was dressed in a new shooting-jacket, with his gun lying  carelessly across his shoulder, and an ugly pointer dog following  at a little distance.    \"Well, Mrs. Moodie, I am off,\" said Tom, shaking hands with my  sister instead of me. \"I suppose I shall see Moodie in London. What  do you think of my dog?\" patting him affectionately.    \"I think him an ugly beast,\" said C----. \"Do you mean to take him  with you?\"    \"An ugly beast!--Duchess a beast? Why she is a perfect  beauty!--Beauty and the beast! Ha, ha, ha! I gave two guineas for  her last night.\" (I thought of the old adage.) \"Mrs. Moodie, your  sister is no judge of a dog.\"    \"Very likely,\" returned C----, laughing. \"And you go to town  to-night, Mr. Wilson? I thought as you came up to the house that  you were equipped for shooting.\"    \"To be sure; there is capital shooting in Canada.\"    \"So I have heard--plenty of bears and wolves. I suppose you take  out your dog and gun in anticipation?\"    \"True,\" said Tom.    \"But you surely are not going to take that dog with you?\"    \"Indeed I am. She is a most valuable brute. The very best venture I  could take. My brother Charles has engaged our passage in the same  vessel.\"    \"It would be a pity to part you,\" said I. \"May you prove as lucky a  pair as Whittington and his cat.\"    \"Whittington! Whittington!\" said Tom, staring at my sister, and  beginning to dream, which he invariably did in the company of  women. \"Who was the gentleman?\"    \"A very old friend of mine, one whom I have known since I was a  very little girl,\" said my sister; \"but I have not time to tell you  more about him now. If you so to St. Paul's Churchyard, and inquire  for Sir Richard Whittington and his cat, you will get his history  for a mere trifle.\"    \"Do not mind her, Mr. Wilson, she is quizzing you,\" quoth I; \"I  wish you a safe voyage across the Atlantic; I wish I could add a  happy meeting with your friends. But where shall we find friends  in a strange land?\"    \"All in good time,\" said Tom. \"I hope to have the pleasure of  meeting you in the backwoods of Canada before three months are  over. What adventures we shall have to tell one another! It will  be capital. Good-bye.\"                                * * * * * *      \"Tom has sailed,\" said Captain Charles Wilson, stepping into my  little parlour a few days after his eccentric brother's last visit.  \"I saw him and Duchess safe on board. Odd as he is, I parted with  him with a full heart; I felt as if we never should meet again.  Poor Tom! he is the only brother left me now that I can love.  Robert and I never agreed very well, and there is little chance of  our meeting in this world. He is married, and settled down for life  in New South Wales; and the rest--John, Richard, George, are all  gone--all!\"    \"Was Tom in good spirits when you parted?\"    \"Yes. He is a perfect contradiction. He always laughs and cries in the  wrong place. 'Charles,' he said, with a loud laugh, 'tell the girls to  get some new music against I return: and, hark ye! if I never come  back, I leave them my Kangaroo Waltz as a legacy.'\"    \"What a strange creature!\"    \"Strange, indeed; you don't know half his oddities. He has very little  money to take out with him, but he actually paid for two berths in the  ship, that he might not chance to have a person who snored sleep near  him. Thirty pounds thrown away upon the mere chance of a snoring  companion! 'Besides, Charles,' quoth he, 'I cannot endure to share  my little cabin with others; they will use my towels, and combs,  and brushes, like that confounded rascal who slept in the same berth  with me coming from New South Wales, who had the impudence to clean  his teeth with my toothbrush. Here I shall be all alone, happy and  comfortable as a prince, and Duchess shall sleep in the after-berth,  and be my queen.' And so we parted,\" continued Captain Charles.  \"May God take care of him, for he never could take care of himself.\"    \"That puts me in mind of the reason he gave for not going with us.  He was afraid that my baby would keep him awake of a night. He  hates children, and says that he never will marry on that account.\"                                * * * * * *      We left the British shores on the 1st of July, and cast anchor,  as I have already shown, under the Castle of St. Louis, at Quebec,  on the 2nd of September, 1832. Tom Wilson sailed the 1st of May,  and had a speedy passage, and was, as we heard from his friends,  comfortably settled in the bush, had bought a farm, and meant to  commence operations in the fall. All this was good news, and as he  was settled near my brother's location, we congratulated ourselves  that our eccentric friend had found a home in the wilderness at  last, and that we should soon see him again.    On the 9th of September, the steam-boat William IV. landed us at  the then small but rising town of ----, on Lake Ontario. The night  was dark and rainy; the boat was crowded with emigrants; and when  we arrived at the inn, we learnt that there was no room for us--not  a bed to be had; nor was it likely, owing to the number of  strangers that had arrived for several weeks, that we could obtain  one by searching farther. Moodie requested the use of a sofa for me  during the night; but even that produced a demur from the landlord.  Whilst I awaited the result in a passage, crowded with strange  faces, a pair of eyes glanced upon me through the throng. Was it  possible?--could it be Tom Wilson? Did any other human being  possess such eyes, or use them in such an eccentric manner?  In another second he had pushed his way to my side, whispering  in my ear, \"We met, 'twas in a crowd.\"    \"Tom Wilson, is that you?\"    \"Do you doubt it? I flatter myself that there is no likeness  of such a handsome fellow to be found in the world. It is I,  I swear!--although very little of me is left to swear by. The  best part of me I have left to fatten the mosquitoes and black  flies in that infernal bush. But where is"]]]
