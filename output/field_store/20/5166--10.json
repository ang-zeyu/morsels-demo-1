To the left, above the easternmost \"Mombang\" and the  network of islands behind it, opens the gape of the Malela River,  a short cut to French Point, found useful when a dangerous tide-  rip is caused by the strong sea-breeze meeting the violent  current of the Thalweg. Above it lies a curious formation like  concentric rings of trees inclosing grass: it is visible only  from the north-east. Several slave factories now appear on either  shore, single-storied huts of wood and thatch, in holes cut out  of the densest bush, an impenetrable forest whose sloppy soil and  miry puddles seem never to dry. The tenements serve as videttes  and outposts, enabling cargoes to ship without the difficulties  of passing Palm Point, and thus to make a straight run down  stream. There are three on the north bank, viz. M. Rágis (aîné),  now deserted, Sr. Lima Viana, and Sr. Antonio Fernandez; and  three on the left side, Sr. Alessandro Ferreira, Sr. Guilherme,  and Sr. Fonseca. Those on the southern or left bank facilitate  overland transit to Mangue, Ambrizette, and other dépôts. At  present it is \"tiempo seco\" (dull time), and the gérants keep  their hands in by buying ground-nuts and palm oil. The slave  trade, however, makes 500, not 50, per cent., and the agents are  naturally fond of it, their mere salaries being only some 150  francs a month.    Landing at the factory of Sr. Fernandez, we were received by his  agent, Sr. Silva, in a little bungalow of bamboo and matting,  paved with tamped earth and old white ostreoid shells, a kind of  Mya, relished by the natives but not eaten by Europeans. To  these, doubtless, Mr. W. Winwood Reacle refers (\"Savage Africa,\"  chap, xxxvii.), \"The traders say that in Congo there are great  heaps of oyster-shells, but no oysters. These shells the negroes  also burn for lime.\" I did not hear of any of these \"ostreiras,\"  which, if they exist, must reflect the Sambaquis of the opposite  Brazilian shore. The house was guarded by three wooden figures,  \"clouterly carved,\" and powdered with ochre or red wood; two of  them, representing warriors in studded coatings of spike nails,  with a looking-glass fixed in the stomach, raised their hands as  if to stab each other. These figures are sometimes found large as  life: according to the agents, the spikes are driven in before  the wars begin, and every one promises the hoped-for death of an  enemy. Behind them the house was guarded by a sentinel with drawn  sword. The unfortunate tenant, who looked a martyr to ague, sat  \"in palaver\" with a petty island \"king,\" and at times the tap of  a war-drum roused my experienced ear. The monarch, habited in a  shabby cloth coat, occupied a settee, with a \"minister\" on either  side; he was a fat senior of light complexion, with a vicious  expression upon features, which were not those of the  \"tobacconist nigger,\" nor had he the effeminate aspect of the  Congoese.    I looked curiously at these specimens of the Musulungu or  Musurungu, a wilder race than that of Shark Point: the English,  of course, call them Missolonghi, because Lord Byron died there.  Here the people say \"le\" for \"re,\" and \"rua\" for \"lua,\"  confounding both liquids, which may also be found in the Kibundo  tongue. In Loango, according to the Abbé Proyart, the national  organ does not admit the roughness of the r, which is changed to  l. Monteiro and Gamitto assert (xxii.) that the \"Cazembes or  Lundas do not pronounce the letter r, in whose place they use l.\"  The \"Ibos\" of the lower Congo, dwelling on the southern shore  between the mouth and the Porto da Lenha, above which they are  harmless, these men have ever been dangerous to strangers, and  the effect of the slave-trade has been to make them more  formidable. Lieutenant Boteler (1835) was attacked by twenty-  eight canoes, carrying some 140 men, who came on boldly,  \"ducking\" at the flash, and who were driven off only by a volley  of musketry and a charge of grape. In 1860 a whaler and crew were  attacked by their war-canoes sallying out from behind Scotchman's  Head. These craft are of two kinds, one shaped like a horse-  trough, the other with a lean and snaky head. The \"Wrangler\" lost  two of her men near Zungá chyá Kampenzi, and the \"Griffon\"  escaped by firing an Armstrong conical shell. They have  frequently surprised and kept for ransom the white agents, whom  \"o negocio\" deterred from reprisals. M. Pissot, our companion,  was amarré by them for some weeks, and the most unpleasant part  of his captivity was the stunning concert of songs and  instruments kept up during the day to prevent his escaping by  night. The more sensible traders at Boma pay them black mail by  employing them as boats' crews, upon our Anglo-Indian principle  of the \"Paggi\" and the \"Ramosi.\"    Merolla calls these men Musilongo or Sonhese. The word appears to  me opprobrious, as if each tribe termed itself Mushi-Congo (Congo  people), and its neighbours Musulungus: Barbot writes as a  Frenchman Moutsie, the Portuguese Muxi (Mushi). Mushi-Longo would  perhaps mean Loango-people; but my ear could not detect any  approach to \"Loango\" in \"Musulungu.\" The first syllable, Mu, in  Fiote or Congoese, would be a contraction of Muntu (plural  Wántú). They inhabit the islands, own a part of the north bank,  and extend southwards to Ambriz: eastward they are bounded by the  Fiote or Congo-speaking peoples, to whom their tongue is  intelligible. They have no tattoo, but they pierce the nose  septum and extract the two central and upper incisors; the Muxi-  Congoes or Lower Congoese chip or file out a chevron in the near  sides of the same teeth-- an ornament possibly suggested by the  weight of the native pipe. The chipping and extracting seem to be  very arbitrary and liable to change: sometimes the upper, at  other times the lower teeth are operated upon. The fashionable  mutilation is frequently seen in Eastern Africa, and perhaps it  is nothing but a fashion. They are the \"kallistoi\" and \"megistoi\"  of the Congoese bodies, taller and darker, fiercer and braver  than their neighbours, nor will they cease to be river pirates  till the illicit trade dies.    After taking leave of Sr. Silva we resumed our way, the  thermometer (F.) showing at 1.45 P.M. 95° in the air when the sun  was obscured, and the mirage played the usual fantastic tricks.  The mangrove, which Tuckey's introduction prolongs to fifty miles  from the mouth, now disappears; in fact, it does not extend much  above Bullock Island, nineteen direct miles on the chart from  Shark Point and, as usual, it enables us to measure the extreme  limit where the salt-tide ascends. The palhabote went gallantly,                   \"The water round her bows            Dancing as round a drinking cup.\"    Small trembling waves poppled and frothed in mid-stream, where  the fresh water met wind and tide; and by the \"boiling\" of the  surface we saw that there was still a strong under-current  flowing against the upper layer. A little beyond the factory we  were shown on the northern bank Mariquita Nook, where the slaver  of that name, commanded by a Captain Bowen, had shipped some 520  men. She was captured by H.M. Steamship \"Zebra,\" Commander  Hoskins, after being reported by a chief, whom her captain had  kicked, to a trader at the river mouth, and by him to the  cruizer. Slavers used to show their sense by starting on Sundays,  when the squadron kept a careless look-out; but their inevitable  danger was the general \"drunk\" of the officers and crew to  celebrate the event, and this libation often caused delays which  led to seizure. It was an admirable site, a bit of golden sand  fronting the cleared bush, commanding an unbroken sweep of vision  to the embouchure, and masked by forest from Porto da Lenha. It  is easily known by its two tall trees, and that nearest the sea,  when viewed from the east, appears surmounted by what resemble  the \"Kangaroo's Head:\" they are cones of regular shape, covered  to the topmost twig with the lightest green Flagellaria. The  \"bush\" now becomes beautiful, rolling in bulging masses of  verdure to the very edge of the clear brown stream. As in the  rivers of Guinea, the llianas form fibrous chains, varying in  size from a packthread to a cable; now straight, then twisted;  investing the trees with an endless variety of folds and  embraces, and connecting neighbours by graceful arches like the  sag of an acrobat's rope. Here and there a grotesque calabash  contrasted with the graceful palms towering in air for warmth and  light, or bending over water like Prince of Wales's feathers. The  unvarying green was enlivened by yew-like trees with scarlet  flowers, the \"Burning Bush\" of Sierra Leone, setting off the  white boles of the cotton-trees; and the whole was edged by the  yellow green of the quaint pandanus hung with heavy fruit.    A little beyond \"Mariquita Nook\" the right bank becomes a net-  work of creeks, \"obscure channels,\" tortuous, slimy with mud,  banked with the snake-like branches of trees, and much resembling  the lower course of the Benin, or any other north equatorial  African river; the forest is also full of large villages,  invisible like the streams till entered. A single tree,  apparently growing out of the great stream-bed, showed shallow  water as we passed the Ponte de tres Palmeiras; the three oil-  palms are still there, but the easternmost is decaying. At 2 P.M.  we were in sight of the chief slaving settlement on the Congo,  the Whydah of the river, Porto da Lenha. Our charts have \"Ponta  de Linha,\" three mistakes in as many words. Some authorities,  however, prefer Ponta da Lenha, \"Woody Point,\" from the piles  flanking the houses; others, Ponte da Lenha, from a bridge built  by the agent of Messrs. Tobin's house over the single influent  that divides the settlement. Cruizers have often ascended thus  far; the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5762"],[0,"Grammar and Vocabulary of the Lau Language, Solomon Islands (#12)"],[1,".    _ngasi_ v. i., to be firm, hard; _bae ngasi_, to speak sternly.
