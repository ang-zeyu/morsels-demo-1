It was hardly to be  expected, however, that Herbert would feel thus. Upon him the show and  glitter of the city shops and streets produced their natural effect, and  he walked on buoyantly, seeing three times as much as a city boy would  have done.    He turned down School Street, passing the Parker House, where he was to  meet Mr. Melville. Just before he reached it he saw Eben Graham emerge  from the hotel and walk towards Washington Street. Eben did not look  behind him, and therefore did not see Herbert.    \"I wonder where he is going?\" thought our hero, as he followed a few  steps behind Eben.          CHAPTER XV. AN OBLIGING GUIDE.        On Washington Street, not far from Old South Church, is an office for  the sale of railroad tickets to western points. It was this office which  Eben entered.    \"He is going to inquire the price of a ticket to some western city,\"  thought Herbert. \"I heard him say one day that he wanted to go West.\"    Our hero's curiosity was naturally aroused, and he stood at the  entrance, where he could not only see but hear what passed within.    \"What do you charge for a ticket to Chicago?\" he heard Eben ask.    \"Twenty-two dollars,\" was the answer of the young man behind the  counter.    \"You may give me one,\" said Eben.    As he spoke he drew from his vest pocket a roll of bills, and began to  count off the requisite sum.    Herbert was surprised. He had supposed that Eben was merely making  inquiries about the price of tickets. He had not imagined that he was  really going.    \"Can Mr. Graham have given him money to go?\" he asked himself.    \"When can I start?\" asked Eben, as he received a string of tickets from  the clerk.    \"At three this afternoon.\"    Eben seemed well pleased with this reply. He carefully deposited the  tickets in an inside vest pocket, and turned to go out of the office. As  he emerged from it he caught sight of Herbert, who had not yet started  to go. He looked surprised and annoyed.    \"Herbert Carr!\" he exclaimed. \"How came you here?\"    Mingled with his surprise there was a certain nervousness of manner, as  Herbert thought.    \"I came to Boston with Mr. Melville,\" said Herbert, coldly.    \"Oh!\" ejaculated Eben, with an air of perceptible relief. \"Where is Mr.  Melville?\"    \"He has gone to the office of his physician, on Tremont Street.\"    \"Leaving you to your own devices, eh?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Look out you don't get lost!\" said Eben, with affected gayety. \"I am  here on a little business for the old man.\"    Herbert did not believe this, in view of what he had seen, but he did  not think it necessary to say so.    \"Good-morning!\" said Herbert, in a tone polite but not cordial.    \"Good-morning! Oh, by the way, I have just been inquiring the cost of a  ticket to St. Louis,\" said Eben, carelessly.    \"Indeed! Do you think of going out there?\"    \"Yes, if the old man will let me,\" said Eben.    \"Do you prefer St. Louis to Chicago?\" asked Herbert, watching the face  of Eben attentively.    Eben's face changed, and he looked searchingly at our hero, but could  read nothing in his face.    \"Oh, decidedly!\" he answered, after a slight pause. \"I don't think I  would care for Chicago.\"    \"And all the while you have a ticket for Chicago in your pocket!\"  thought Herbert, suspiciously, \"Well, that's your own affair entirely,  not mine.\"    \"What train do you take back to Wayneboro?\" asked Eben, not without  anxiety.    \"We shall not go before four o'clock.\"    \"I may be on the train with you,\" said Eben, \"though possibly I shall  get through in time to take an earlier one.\"    \"He is trying to deceive me,\" thought Herbert.    \"Good-morning,\" he said, formally, and walked away.    \"I wish I hadn't met him,\" muttered Eben to himself. \"He may give the  old man a clew. However, I shall be safe out of the way before anything  can be done.\"    Herbert kept on his way, and found the bank without difficulty.    He entered and looked about him. Though unaccustomed to banks, he  watched to see where others went to get checks cashed, and presented  himself in turn.    \"How will you have it?\" asked the paying teller.    \"Fives and tens, and a few small bills,\" answered Herbert, promptly.    The teller selected the requisite number of bank bills quickly, and  passed them out to Herbert. Our hero counted them, to make sure that  they were correct, and then put them away in his inside pocket. It gave  him a feeling of responsibility to be carrying about so much money, and  he felt that it was incumbent on him to be very careful.    \"Where shall I go now?\" he asked himself.    He would have liked to go to Charlestown, and ascend Bunker Hill  Monument, but did not know how to go. Besides, he feared he would not  get back to the Parker House at the time fixed by Mr. Melville. Still,  he might be able to do it. He addressed himself to a rather sprucely  dressed man of thirty-five whom he met at the door of the bank.    \"I beg your pardon, sir, but can you tell me how far it is to Bunker  Hill Monument?\"    \"About a mile and a half,\" answered the stranger.    \"Could I go there and get back to the Parker House before one o'clock.\"    \"Could you?\" repeated the man, briskly. \"Why, to be sure you could!\"    \"But I don't know the way.\"    \"You have only to take one of the Charlestown horse cars, and it will  land you only a couple of minutes' walk from the monument.\"    \"Can you tell me what time it is, sir?\"    \"Only a little past eleven. So you have never been to Bunker Hill  Monument, my lad?\"    \"No sir; I live in the country, forty miles away and seldom come to  Boston.\"    \"I see, I see,\" said the stranger, his eyes snapping in a very peculiar  way. \"Every patriotic young American ought to see the place where Warren  fell.\"    \"I should like to if you could tell me where to take the cars.\"    \"Why, certainly I will,\" said the other, quickly. \"In fact--let me see,\"  and he pulled out a silver watch from his vest pocket, \"I've a great  mind to go over with you myself.\"    \"I shouldn't like to trouble you, sir,\" said Herbert.    \"Oh, it will be no trouble. Business isn't pressing this morning, and  I haven't been over for a long time myself. If you don't object to my  company, I will accompany you.\"    \"You are very kind,\" said Herbert. \"If you are quite sure that you are  not inconveniencing yourself, I shall be very glad to go with you--that  is, if you think I can get back to the Parker House by one o'clock.\"    \"I will guarantee that you do,\" said the stranger, confidently. \"My  young friend, I am glad to see that you are particular to keep your  business engagements. In a varied business experience, I have observed  that it is precisely that class who are destined to win the favor of  their employer and attain solid success.\"    \"He seems a very sensible man,\" thought Herbert; \"and his advice is  certainly good.\"    \"Come this way,\" said the stranger, crossing Washington Street.  \"Scollay's Square is close at hand, and there we shall find a  Charlestown horse car.\"    Of course Herbert yielded himself to the guidance of his new friend, and  they walked up Court Street together.    \"That,\" said the stranger, pointing out a large, somber building to the  left, \"is the courthouse. The last time I entered it was to be present  at the trial of a young man of my acquaintance who had fallen into evil  courses, and, yielding to temptation, had stolen from his employer. It  was a sad sight,\" said the stranger, shaking his head.    \"I should think it must have been,\" said Herbert.    \"Oh, why, why will young men yield to the seductions of pleasure?\"  exclaimed the stranger, feelingly.    \"Was he convicted?\" asked Herbert.    \"Yes, and sentenced to a three years term in the State prison,\" answered  his companion. \"It always makes me feel sad when I think of the fate of  that young man.\"    \"I should think it would, sir.\"    \"I have mentioned it as a warning to one who is just beginning life,\"  continued the stranger. \"But here is our car.\"    A Charlestown car, with an outside sign, Bunker Hill, in large letters,  came by, and the two got on board.    They rode down Cornhill, and presently the stranger pointed out Faneuil  Hall.    \"Behold the Cradle of Liberty,\" he said. \"Of course, you have heard of  Faneuil Hall?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" and Herbert gazed with interest at the building of which he  had heard so much.    It was but a short ride to Charlestown. They got out at the foot of a  steep street, at the head of which the tall, granite column which crowns  the summit of Bunker Hill stood like a giant sentinel ever on guard.          CHAPTER XVI. A NEW BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL.        Just opposite the monument is a small, one-story structure, where views  of the shaft may be purchased and tickets obtained.    \"There is a small admission fee,\" said Herbert's companion.    \"How much is it?\" asked our hero.    \"Twenty cents.\"    As Herbert thrust his hand into his pocket for the necessary money, his  companion said:    \"You had better let me pay for both tickets.\"    Though he said this, he didn't make any motion to do so.    \"No, I will pay for both,\" said Herbert.    \"But I really cannot permit you to pay for mine.\"    And still the speaker made no movement to purchase his ticket.    Herbert settled the matter by laying half a dollar on the desk,  and asking for two tickets. He began to see that, in spite of his  disclaimer, his guide intended him to do so. On the whole, this didn't  please him. He would rather have had his offer frankly accepted.    \"I didn't mean to have you pay,\" said the young man, as they passed  through the door admitting them to an inner apartment, from which there  was an exit into a small, inclosed yard, through which they were to  reach the entrance to a spiral staircase by which the ascent was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5760"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"us, whilst the  underlying idea, \"the more the merrier,\" especially in lands  where free service is unknown, seems to stifle envy and jealousy.  Everywhere, moreover, amongst polygamists, the husband is  strictly forbidden by popular opinion to show preference for a  favourite wife; if he do so, he is a bad man.    But polygamy here has not rendered the women, as theoretically it  should, a down-trodden moiety of society; on the contrary, their  position is comparatively high. The marriage connection is not  \"one of master and slave,\" a link between freedom and serfdom;  the \"weaker vessel\" does not suffer from collision with the pot  de fer; generally the fair but frail ones appear to be, as  amongst the Israelites generally, the better halves. Despite the  Okosunguu or cow-hide \"peacemaker,\" they have conquered a  considerable latitude of conducting their own affairs. When poor  and slaveless and, naturally, when no longer young, they must  work in the house and in the field, but this lot is not singular;  in journeys they carry the load, yet it is rarely heavier than  the weapons borne by the man. On the other hand, after feeding  their husbands, what remains out of the fruits of their labours  is their own, wholly out of his reach--a boon not always granted  by civilization. As in Unyamwezi, they guard their rights with a  truly feminine touchiness and jealousy. There is always, in the  African mind, a preference for descent and inheritance through  the mother, \"the surer side,\"--an unmistakable sign, by the by,  of barbarism. The so-called royal races in the eight great  despotisms of Pagan Africa--Ashanti, Dahome, and Benin; Karagwah,  Uganda, and Unyoro; the MwÃ¡tÃ¡ yÃ¡ Nvo, and the MwÃ¡tÃ¡ Cazembe--  allow the greatest liberty even to the king's sisters; they are  expected only to choose handsome lovers, that the race may  maintain its physical superiority; and hence, doubtless, the  stalwart forms and the good looks remarked by every traveller. As  a rule, the husband cannot sell his wife's children whilst her  brother may dispose of them as he pleases--the vox populi  exclaims, \"What! is the man to go hungry when he can trade off  his sister's brats?\"    The strong-minded of London and New York have not yet succeeded  in thoroughly organizing and popularizing their clubs; the belles  sauvages of the Gaboon have. There is a secret order, called  \"Njembe,\" a Rights of Woman Association, intended mainly to  counterbalance the Nda of the lords of creation, which will  presently be described. Dropped a few years ago by the men, it  was taken up by their wives, and it now numbers a host of  initiated, limited only by heavy entrance fees. This form of  freemasonry deals largely in processions, whose preliminaries and  proceedings are kept profoundly secret. At certain times an old  woman strikes a stick upon an \"Orega\" or crescent-shaped drum,  hollowed out of a block of wood; hearing this signal, the  worshipful sisterhood, bedaubed, by way of insignia, with red and  white chalk or clay, follow her from the village to some remote  nook in the jungle, where the lodge is tiled. Sentinels are  stationed around whilst business is transacted before a vestal  fire, which must burn for a fortnight or three weeks, in the awe-  compelling presence of a brass pipkin filled with herbs, and a  basin, both zebra'd like the human limbs. The Rev. William Walker  was once detected playing \"Peeping Tom\" by sixty or seventy  viragos, who attempted to exact a fine of forty dollars, and who  would have handled him severely had he not managed to escape. The  French officers, never standing upon ceremony in such matters,  have often insisted upon being present.    Circumcision, between the fourth and eighth year, is universal in  Pongo-land, and without it a youth could not be married. The  operation is performed generally by the chief, often by some old  man, who receives a fee from the parents: the thumb nails are  long, and are used after the Jewish fashion:[FN#10] neat rum with  red pepper is spirted from the mouth to \"kill wound.\" It is  purely hygienic, and not balanced by the excisio Judaica, Some  physiologists consider the latter a necessary complement of the  male rite; such, however, is not the case. The Hebrews, who  almost everywhere retained circumcision, have, in Europe at  least, long abandoned excision. I regret that the delicacy of the  age does not allow me to be more explicit.    The Mpongwe practise a rite so resembling infant baptism that the  missionaries have derived it from a corruption of Abyssinian  Christianity which, like the flora of the Camarones and  Fernandian Highlands, might have travelled across the Dark  Continent, where it has now been superseded by El Islam. I  purpose at some period of more leisure to prove an ancient  intercourse and rapprochement of all the African tribes ranging  between the parallels of north latitude 20Â° and south latitude  30Â°. It will best be established, not by the single great family  of language, but by the similarity of manners, customs, and  belief; of arts and crafts; of utensils and industry. The baptism  of Pongo-land is as follows. When the babe is born, a crier,  announcing the event, promises to it in the people's name  participation in the rights of the living. It is placed upon a  banana leaf, for which reason the plantain is never used to stop  the water-pots; and the chief or the nearest of kin sprinkles it  from a basin, gives it a name, and pronounces a benediction, his  example being followed by all present. The man-child is exhorted  to be truthful, and the girl to \"tell plenty lie,\" in order to  lead a happy life. Truly a new form of the regenerative rite!    A curious prepossession of the African mind, curious and yet  general, in a land where population is the one want, and where  issue is held the greatest blessing, is the imaginary necessity  of limiting the family. Perhaps this form of infanticide is a  policy derived from ancestors who found it necessary. In the  kingdom of Apollonia (Guinea) the tenth child was always buried  alive; never a Decimus was allowed to stand in the way of the  nine seniors. The birth of twins is an evil portent to the  Mpongwes, as it is in many parts of Central Africa, and even in  the New World; it also involves the idea of moral turpitude, as  if the woman were one of the lower animals, capable of  superfetation. There is no greater insult to a man, than to point  at him with two fingers, meaning that he is a twin; of course he  is not one, or he would have been killed at birth. Albinos are  allowed to live, as in Dahome, in Ashanti, and among some East  African tribes, where I have been \"chaffed\" about a brother  white, who proved to be an exceptional negro without pigmentum  nigrum.    There is no novelty in the Mpongwe funeral rites; the same system  prevails from the Oil Rivers to Congo-land, and extends even to  the wild races of the interior. The corpse, being still sentient,  is accompanied by stores of raiment, pots, and goats' flesh; a  bottle is placed in one hand and a glass in the other, and, if  the deceased has been fond of play, his draught-board and other  materials are buried with him. The system has been well defined  as one in which the \"ghost of a man eats the ghost of a yam,  boiled in the ghost of a pot, over the ghost of a fire.\" The  body, after being stretched out in a box, is carried to a lonely  place; some are buried deep, others close to the surface. There  is an immense show of grief, with keening and crocodiles' tears,  perhaps to benefit the living by averting a charge of witchcraft,  which would inevitably lead to \"Sassy\" or poison-water. The wake  continues for five days, when they \"pull the cry,\" that is to  say, end mourning. If these pious rites be neglected, the  children incur the terrible reproach, \"Your father he be hungry.\"  The widow may re-marry immediately after \"living for cry,\" and,  if young and lusty, she looks out for another consort within the  week. The slave is thrown out into the bush--no one will take the  trouble to dig a hole for him.    The industry of the Mpongwe is that of the African generally;  every man is a host in himself; he builds and furnishes his  house, he makes his weapons and pipes, and he ignores division of  labour, except in the smith and the carpenter; in the potter, who  works without a wheel, and in the dyer, who knows barks, and who  fixes his colours with clay. The men especially pride themselves  upon canoe-making; the favourite wood is the buoyant Okumeh or  bombax, that monarch of the African forest. I have seen a boat,  45 feet 10 inches by 5 feet 11 inches in beam, cut out of a  single tree, with the MpÃ¡no or little adze, a lineal descendant  of the Silex implement, and I have heard of others measuring 70  feet. These craft easily carry 10 tons, and travel 200 to 300  miles, which, as Mr. Wilson remarks, would land them, under  favourable circumstances, in South America. Captain Boteler found  that the Mpongwe boat combined symmetry of form, strength, and  solidity, with safeness and swiftness either in pulling or  sailing. And of late years the people have succeeded in launching  large and fast craft built after European models.    The favourite pleasures of the Mpongwe are gross and gorging  \"feeds,\" drinking and smoking. They recall to mind the old woman  who told \"Monk Lewis\" that if a glass of gin were at one end of  the table, and her immortal soul at the other, she would choose  the gin. They soak with palm-wine every day; they indulge in rum  and absinthe, and the wealthy affect so-called Cognac, with  Champagne and Bordeaux, which, however, they pronounce to be  \"cold.\" I have seen Master Boro, a boy five years old, drain  without winking a wineglassful of brandy. It is not wonderful  that the adults can \"stand\" but little, and that a few mouthfuls  of well-watered spirit make their voices thick, and paralyze  their"]]]
