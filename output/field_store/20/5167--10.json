It will put the public utility operating industry on a sound basis  for the future, both in its public relations and in its internal  relations.    This legislation will not only in the long run result in providing  lower electric and gas rates to the consumer, but it will protect  the actual value and earning power of properties now owned by  thousands of investors who have little protection under the old  laws against what used to be called frenzied finance.  It will not  destroy values.    Not only business recovery, but the general economic recovery of  the nation will be greatly stimulated by the enactment of  legislation designed to improve the status of our transportation  agencies.  There is need for legislation providing for the  regulation of interstate transportation by buses and trucks, for  the regulation of transportation by water, for the strengthening of  our Merchant Marine and Air Transport, for the strengthening of the  Interstate Commerce Commission to enable it to carry out a rounded  conception of the national transportation system in which the  benefits of private ownership are retained while the public stake  in these important services is protected by the public's  government.    Finally, the reestablishment of public confidence in the banks of  the nation is one of the most hopeful results of our efforts as a  Nation to reestablish public confidence in private banking.  We all  know that private banking actually exists by virtue of the  permission of and regulation by the people as a whole, speaking  through their government.  Wise public policy, however, requires not  only that banking be safe but that its resources be most fully  utilized in the economic life of the country.  To this end it was  decided more than twenty years ago that the government should  assume the responsibility of providing a means by which the credit  of the nation might be controlled, not by a few private banking  institutions, but by a body with public prestige and authority.  The  answer to this demand was the Federal Reserve System.  Twenty years  of experience with this system have justified the efforts made to  create it, but these twenty years have shown by experience definite  possibilities for improvement.  Certain proposals made to amend the  Federal Reserve Act deserve prompt and favorable action by the  Congress.  They are a minimum of wise readjustments of our Federal  Reserve System in the light of past experience and present needs.    These measures I have mentioned are, in large part, the program  which under my constitutional duty I have recommended to the  Congress.  They are essential factors in a rounded program for  national recovery.  They contemplate the enrichment of our national  life by a sound and rational ordering of its various elements and  wise provisions for the protection of the weak against the strong.    Never since my inauguration in March, 1933, have I felt so  unmistakably the atmosphere of recovery.  But it is more than the  recovery of the material basis of our individual lives.  It is the  recovery of confidence in our democratic processes and  institutions.  We have survived all of the arduous burdens and the  threatening dangers of a great economic calamity.  We have in the  darkest moments of our national trials retained our faith in our  own ability to master our destiny.  Fear is vanishing and confidence  is growing on every side, renewed faith in the vast possibilities  of human beings to improve their material and spiritual status  through the instrumentality of the democratic form of government.  That faith is receiving its just reward.  For that we can be  thankful to the God who watches over America.        September 6, 1936.      I have been on a journey of husbandry.  I went primarily to see at  first hand conditions in the drought states; to see how effectively  federal and local authorities are taking care of pressing problems  of relief and also how they are to work together to defend the  people of this country against the effects of future droughts.    I saw drought devastation in nine states.    I talked with families who had lost their wheat crop, lost their  corn crop, lost their livestock, lost the water in their well, lost  their garden and come through to the end of the summer without one  dollar of cash resources, facing a winter without feed or food--  facing a planting season without seed to put in the ground.    That was the extreme case, but there are thousands and thousands of  families on Western farms who share the same difficulties.    I saw cattlemen who because of lack of grass or lack of winter feed  have been completely compelled to sell all but their breeding stock  and will need help to carry even these through the coming winter.  I  saw livestock kept alive only because water had been brought to  them long distances in tank cars.  I saw other farm families who  have not lost everything but who, because they have made only  partial crops, must have some form of help if they are to continue  farming next spring.    I shall never forget the fields of wheat so blasted by heat that  they cannot be harvested.  I shall never forget field after field of  corn stunted, earless and stripped of leaves, for what the sun left  the grasshoppers took.  I saw brown pastures which would not keep a  cow on fifty acres.    Yet I would not have you think for a single minute that there is  permanent disaster in these drought regions, or that the picture I  saw meant depopulating these areas.  No cracked earth, no blistering  sun, no burning wind, no grasshoppers, are a permanent match for  the indomitable American farmers and stockmen and their wives and  children who have carried on through desperate days, and inspire us  with their self-reliance, their tenacity and their courage.  It was  their fathers' task to make homes; it is their task to keep those  homes; it is our task to help them win their fight.    First let me talk for a minute about this autumn and the coming  winter.  We have the option, in the case of families who need actual  subsistence, of putting them on the dole or putting them to work.  They do not want to go on the dole and they are one thousand  percent right.  We agree, therefore, that we must put them to work  for a decent wage; and when we reach that decision we kill two  birds with one stone, because these families will earn enough by  working, not only to subsist themselves, but to buy food for their  stock, and seed for next year's planting.  Into this scheme of  things there fit of course the government lending agencies which  next year, as in the past, will help with production loans.    Every governor with whom I have talked is in full accord with this  program of doing work for these farm families, just as every  governor agrees that the individual states will take care of their  unemployables but that the cost of employing those who are entirely  able and willing to work must be borne by the federal government.    If then we know, as we do today, the approximate number of farm  families who will require some form of work relief from now on  through the winter, we face the question of what kind of work they  should do.  Let me make it clear that this is not a new question  because it has already been answered to a greater or less extent in  every one of the drought communities.  Beginning in 1934, when we  also had serious drought conditions, the state and federal  governments cooperated in planning a large number of projects--many  of them directly aimed at the alleviation of future drought  conditions.  In accordance with that program literally thousands of  ponds or small reservoirs have been built in order to supply water  for stock and to lift the level of the underground water to protect  wells from going dry.  Thousands of wells have been drilled or  deepened; community lakes have been created and irrigation projects  are being pushed.    Water conservation by means such as these is being expanded as a  result of this new drought all through the Great Plains area, the  Western corn belt and in the states that lie further south.  In the  Middle West water conservation is not so pressing a problem.  Here  the work projects run more to soil erosion control and the building  of farm-to-market roads.    Spending like this is not waste.  It would spell future waste if we  did not spend for such things now.  These emergency work projects  provide money to buy food and clothing for the winter; they keep  the livestock on the farm; they provide seed for a new crop, and,  best of all, they will conserve soil and water in the future in  those areas most frequently hit by drought.    If, for example, in some local area the water table continues to  drop and the topsoil to blow away, the land values will disappear  with the water and the soil.  People on the farms will drift into  the nearby cities; the cities will have no farm trade and the  workers in the city factories and stores will have no jobs.  Property values in the cities will decline.  If, on the other hand,  the farms within that area remain as farms with better water supply  and no erosion, the farm population will stay on the land and  prosper and the nearby cities will prosper too.  Property values  will increase instead of disappearing.  That is why it is worth our  while as a nation to spend money in order to save money.    I have used the argument in relation only to a small area.  It holds  good in its effect on the nation as a whole.  Every state in the  drought area is now doing and always will do business with every  state outside it.  The very existence of the men and women working  in the clothing factories of New York, making clothes worn by  farmers and their families; of the workers in the steel mills in  Pittsburgh, in the automobile factories of Detroit, and in the  harvester factories of Illinois, depend upon the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],[0,"The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#12)"],[1," Yet what was  served tasted very good to those who were hungry.    \"I believe we'll go to the bottom before we are done,\" began Sam,  when a loud shout from the deck reached the ears of all of the  Rovers and made Tom and Dick leap to their feet.    \"What's that?\" cried Dick.  \"They are calling to somebody!\"    Above the wind they could hear a yell from a distance, and then  came more cries from the deck, followed by a bump on the side of  the steamer.    \"We've struck something!\" ejaculated Tom.    \"But I guess it wasn't hard enough to do much damage.\"    \"That remains to be seen,\" answered Dick.  \"Storm or no storm, I'm  gong on deck to learn what it means,\" and he hurried up the  companionway.          CHAPTER XIII    A RESCUE IN MID-OCEAN      Dick found that he could remain on the deck only with the greatest  of difficulty.  Several life lines had been stretched around and  he clung to one of these.    \"What has happened?\" he asked of one of the sailors.  \"What did we  strike?\"    \"Struck a small boat,\" was the answer.  \"It had a colored man in  it.  We've just hauled the fellow on deck.\"    \"Is he all right?\"    \"No; he's about half dead.  But the captain thinks he may get over  it, with care,\" and the sailor hurried away.    Dick now saw several men approaching, carrying the form of the  rescued one between them.  He looked at the unconscious man and  gave a cry of amazement.    \"Alexander Pop!  What a strange happening!\"    \"Do you know the man?\" questioned Captain Cambion.    \"I know him very well,\" answered Dick.  \"He used to work at the  military academy where my brothers and I were cadets.\"  And the  boy told Captain Cambion the particulars of Alexander Pop's  disappearance from Putnam Hall.  \"I am glad that I will be able to  tell him that his innocence is established,\" he concluded.    \"All providing we are able to bring him around to himself, Master  Rover,\" returned the captain gravely.    \"You think, then, that he is in bad shape?\"    \"I hardly know what to think.  We will take him below and do all  we can for him.\"    It was no easy matter to transfer Pop to one of the lower  staterooms, but once placed on a soft berth the Rovers did all  they could for him.    \"It is like a romance,\" said Sam, while Randolph Rover was  administering some medicine to the unconscious man.  \"How thin he  looks.\"    \"He's been suffering from starvation,\" put in Dick.  \"I suppose he  gave that yell we heard with his last breath.\"    All of the party watched over the colored man with tender care,  and feeling that he could be in no better hands the captain left  him entirely in his friends' charge.  \"When he comes to his senses  you can let me know,\" he said.    Dick was watching by Pop's side, and Tom was at the foot of the  berth, when the colored man opened his eyes.  As they rested on  first one Rover and then the other he stared in utter astonishment.    \"My gracious sakes alive!\" he gasped.  \"Am I dreamin', or am I  back to Putnam Hall again?\"    \"Neither, Aleck,\" replied Dick.  \"You are safe on board an ocean  steamer.\"    \"An' yo'--whar yo' dun come from?\"    \"We are passengers on the steamer,\" said Tom.  \"You were picked up  several hours ago.\"    \"Yes, but--but I can't undersand dis nohow!\" persisted the  colored man, and tried to sit up, only to fall back exhausted.    \"Don't try to understand it, Aleck, until you are stronger,\" said  Dick.  \"Would you like some hot soup?\"    \"Anyt'ing, sah, anyt'ing!  Why, I aint had, no reg'lar meal in  most a week!\" moaned the sufferer.  \"Glory to Heaben dat I am  sabed!\"    And then he said no more for quite a long, while.    The soup was already at hand, and it was Dick who fed it slowly  and carefully, seeing to it that Pop should have no more than his  enfeebled stomach could take care of, for overfeeding, so Mr.  Rover had said, might kill the man.    The next day Pop was able to sit up, although still too weak to  stand on his legs.  He was continually praising Heaven for his  safety.    \"I dun Vink I was a goner more dan once,\" he said.  \"I was on de  ocean all alone about a week, I reckon, although I lost time ob  days after I'd been out two or Vree nights.  I Vink I was most  crazy.\"    \"Perhaps you were, Aleck,\" said Sam.  \"But tell us how you got in  that position.\"    \"Dat am de queerest part ob it, Master Rober--de queerest part  of it.  I got into de small boat fo' a sleep, and de fust Ving I  knowed I was miles an' miles away from eberyt'ing; yes, sah-miles  an' miles away on de boundless ocean, an' not so much as a fishin'  smack sail in sight.  Golly, but wasn't I scared--I reckon I dun  most turn white!\"  And Aleck rolled his eyes around impressively.    \"You were in a small boat attached to some steamer?\"    \"Dat's it.  Da had been usin' de small boat fo' surnt'ing, and  left her overboard.\"    \"Were you cut adrift?\"    \"I don't tink I was--but I aint shuah nohow.\"    \"What boat was it?\"    \"De Harrison, from Brooklyn, bound to Cuba.\"    \"Did you ship on her after you left Putnam Hall in such a hurry?    \"I did, cos I didn't want de police to coted me.  But, say, as  true as I stand heah--mean sit heah--I aint guilty of stealin'  dem watches an' t'ings, no I aint!\"    And Aleck raised both hands earnestly.  \"Captain Putnam made a  great mistake when he dun suspect me.\"    \"We know it,\" answered Dick quietly.  \"We thought you innocent all  along, Aleck.\"    \"T'ank yo' fo' dat, Master Rober--I'se glad to see dat I'se got  one friend--\"    \"Three friends, Aleck--we all stood up for you,\" interrupted  Tom.    \"T'ank yo', t'ank yo'!\"    \"And we discovered who the real thief was,\" added Sam.    \"Wot, yo' dun found, dat out!\" burst out Pop.  \"An' who was de  black-hearted rascal?\"    \"Jim Caven.\"    \"Dat cadet wot tried to be funny wid me an' I had to show him his  place?  Hol' on--I dun see him comin' from de attic one day.\"    \"When he must have put those stolen articles in your trunk,\" said  Tom.  \"Yes, he was guilty, Captain Putnam was going to have him  arrested, but he got away.\"    Nothing would do for Alexander Pop after this but that the boys  give him the full particulars of the affair, to which he listened  with the closest attention. But at the conclusion his face fell.    \"Ise mighty glad I am cleared,\" he said.  \"But I'd give a good  deal to face de cap'n--jest to see wot he would say, eh?\"    \"He said he was sorry he had suspected you,\" said Dick.    \"What a big fool dis darkey was to run away!\" murmured Aleck  meditatively.  \"I wasn't cut out fo' no sailer man.  Ise been sick  most ebery day since I left shoah.  By de way, whar is dis ship  bound?\" he went on.    \"To Africa.\"    \"Africa!  Shuah yo' is foolin', Massah Dick?\"    \"No, I am not.  We and our uncle are bound for the Congo River.\"    \"De Congo!  Dat's whar my great gran' fadder dun come from--so I  heard my mammy tell, years ago.  I don't want to go dar, not me!\"    \"I don't see how you are going to help yourself, Aleck.  The first  stop this steamer will make will be at Boma on the Congo River.\"    \"'Wot am I to do when I gits dar? answer me dat, chile.\"    \"I'm sure I don't know.  Perhaps the captain will let you remain  on the Republique.\"    \"What wid dern Frenchmen?  I don't t'ink I could stand dat.  An'  what am yo' going to do in Africa?\"    \"We are going on a hunt for my father, who has been missing for  years.\"    Again Aleck had to be told the particulars and again he was  tremendously interested.  When the boys had finished he sat in  silence for several minutes.    \"I've got it-jest de t'ing!\" he cried suddenly.    \"Got what?\" asked Tom.    \"De right idea, Massah Tom.  Foah gen'men like yo' don't want to  go to Africa widout a valet nohow.  Let me be de workin' man fe de  crowd.  I'll take de job, cheap,--an' glad ob de chance.\"    \"Hullo, that's an idea!\" mused Dick.    \"Will yo' do it, Massah Dick?\"    \"We'll have to speak to my uncle about it first.\"    \"Well, yo' put in a good word fo' me.  Yo know I always stood by  yo' in de school,\" pleaded the colored man.  \"I don't want to be  driftin' around jess nowhar, wid nuffin to do, an' no money comin'  in--not but what I'll work cheap, as I dun said I would,\" he  added hastily.    A little later Randolph Rover joined the group and Aleck's  proposition was laid before him.  Strange to say he accepted the  colored man's offer immediately, greatly to the wonder of the  boys, and from that minute on Pop be came a member of the  searching party.    \"I will tell you why I did it,\" explained Randolph Rover to the  boys in private. \"When we get into the jungle we will need a man  we can trust and one who is used to American ways.  Moreover, if  there is any spying to be done among the natives the chances are  that a black man can do it better than a white man.\"    \"Uncle Randolph, you've got a long head,\" remarked Tom.  \"No doubt  Aleck will prove just the fellow desired.\"  And Tom was right, as  later events proved.          CHAPTER XIV    A STRANGE MEETING IN BOMA      The storm delayed the passage of the Republique nearly a week, in  a manner that was totally unexpected by the captain.  The fierce  waves, running mountain high, wrenched the screw and it was found  next to impossible to repair the accident.  Consequently the  steamer had to proceed under a decreased rate of speed.    This was tantalizing to the boys, and also to Randolph Rover, for  everyone wished to get ashore, to start up the Congo as early as  possible.  But all the chafing in the world could not help  matters, and they were forced to take things as they came.    A place was found among the sailors for Aleck, and soon he began  to feel like himself once more.  But the sea did not suit the  colored man, and he was as anxious as his masters to reach shore  once more.    \"It's a pity da can't build a mighty bridge over de ocean, an' run  kyars,\" he said.  \"Den nobody would git seasick.\"    \"Perhaps they'll have a bridge some day resting on boats, Aleck,\""]]]
