See here!\"  He  dashed to the river bank and told the killdeers, and then visited the  underbrush and informed the thrushes and wood robins.  Father-tender,  he grew so delirious with joy that he forgot his habitual aloofness,  and fraternized with every bird beside the shining river.  He even laid  aside his customary caution, went chipping into the sumac, and caressed  his mate so boisterously she gazed at him severely and gave his wing a  savage pull to recall him to his sober senses.    That night the Cardinal slept in the sumac, very close to his mate, and  he shut only one eye at a time.  Early in the morning, when he carried  her the first food, he found that she was on the edge of the nest,  dropping bits of shell outside; and creeping to peep, he saw the  tiniest coral baby, with closed eyes, and little patches of soft silky  down.  Its beak was wide open, and though his heart was even fuller  than on the previous day, the Cardinal knew what that meant; and  instead of indulging in another celebration, he assumed the duties of  paternity, and began searching for food, for now there were two empty  crops in his family.  On the following day there were four.  Then he  really worked.  How eagerly he searched, and how gladly he flew to the  sumac with every rare morsel!  The babies were too small for the mother  to leave; and for the first few days the Cardinal was constantly on  wing.    If he could not find sufficiently dainty food for them in the trees and  bushes, or among the offerings of the farmer, he descended to earth and  searched like a wood robin.  He forgot he needed a bath or owned a sun  parlour; but everywhere he went, from his full heart there constantly  burst the cry:    \"See here! See here!\"    His mate made never a sound.  Her eyes were bigger and softer than  ever, and in them glowed a steady lovelight.  She hovered over those  three red mites of nestlings so tenderly!  She was so absorbed in  feeding, stroking, and coddling them she neglected herself until she  became quite lean.    When the Cardinal came every few minutes with food, she was a picture  of love and gratitude for his devoted attention, and once she reached  over and softly kissed his wing.  \"See here! See here!\" shrilled the  Cardinal; and in his ecstasy he again forgot himself and sang in the  sumac.  Then he carried food with greater activity than ever to cover  his lapse.    The farmer knew that it lacked an hour of noon, but he was so anxious  to tell Maria the news that he could not endure the suspense another  minute.  There was a new song from the sumac.  He had heard it as he  turned the first corner with the shovel plow. He had listened eagerly,  and had caught the meaning almost at once--\"See here! See here!\"  He  tied the old gray mare to the fence to prevent her eating the young  corn, and went immediately.  By leaning a rail against the thorn tree  he was able to peer into the sumac, and take a good look at the nest of  handsome birdlings, now well screened with the umbrella-like foliage.  It seemed to Abram that he never could wait until noon.  He critically  examined the harness, in the hope that he would find a buckle missing,  and tried to discover a flaw in the plow that would send him to the  barn for a file; but he could not invent an excuse for going.  So, when  he had waited until an hour of noon, he could endure it no longer.    \"Got news for you, Maria,\" he called from the well, where he was making  a pretense of thirst.    \"Oh I don't know,\" answered Maria, with a superior smile.  \"If it's  about the redbirds, he's been up to the garden three times this morning  yellin', 'See here!' fit to split; an' I jest figured that their little  ones had hatched.  Is that your news?\"    \"Well I be durned!\" gasped the astonished Abram.    Mid-afternoon Abram turned Nancy and started the plow down a row that  led straight to the sumac.  He intended to stop there, tie to the  fence, and go to the river bank, in the shade, for a visit with the  Cardinal.  It was very warm, and he was feeling the heat so much, that  in his heart he knew he would be glad to reach the end of the row and  the rest he had promised himself.    The quick nervous strokes of the dinner bell, \"Clang! Clang!\" came  cutting the air clearly and sharply.  Abram stopped Nancy with a jerk.  It was the warning Maria had promised to send him if she saw prowlers  with guns.  He shaded his eyes with his hand and scanned the points of  the compass through narrowed lids with concentrated vision.  He first  caught a gleam of light playing on a gun-barrel, and then he could  discern the figure of a man clad in hunter's outfit leisurely walking  down the lane, toward the river.    Abram hastily hitched Nancy to the fence.  By making the best time he  could, he reached the opposite corner, and was nibbling the midrib of a  young corn blade and placidly viewing the landscape when the hunter  passed.    \"Howdy!\" he said in an even cordial voice.    The hunter walked on without lifting his eyes or making audible reply.  To Abram's friendly oldfashioned heart this seemed the rankest  discourtesy; and there was a flash in his eye and a certain quality in  his voice he lifted a hand for parley.    \"Hold a minute, my friend,\" he said.  \"Since you are on my premises,  might I be privileged to ask if you have seen a few signs 'at I have  posted pertainin' to the use of a gun?\"    \"I am not blind,\" replied the hunter; \"and my education has been looked  after to the extent that I can make out your notices.  From the number  and size of them, I think I could do it, old man, if I had no eyes.\"    The scarcely suppressed sneer, and the \"old man\" grated on Abram's  nerves amazingly, for a man of sixty years of peace.  The gleam in his  eyes grew stronger, and there was a perceptible lift of his shoulders  as he answered:    \"I meant 'em to be read an' understood!  From the main road passin'  that cabin up there on the bank, straight to the river, an' from the  furthermost line o' this field to the same, is my premises, an' on  every foot of 'em the signs are in full force.  They're in a little  fuller force in June, when half the bushes an' tufts o' grass are  housin' a young bird family, 'an at any other time.  They're sort o'  upholdin' the legislature's act, providing for the protection o' game  an' singin' birds; an' maybe it 'ud be well for you to notice 'at I'm  not so old but I'm able to stand up for my right to any livin' man.\"    There certainly was an added tinge of respect in the hunter's tones as  he asked:  \"Would you consider it trespass if a man simply crossed your  land, following the line of the fences to reach the farm of a friend?\"    \"Certainly not!\" cried Abram, cordial in his relief.  \"To be sure not!  Glad to have you convenience yourself.  I only wanted to jest call to  your notice 'at the BIRDS are protected on this farm.\"    \"I have no intention of interfering with your precious birds, I assure  you,\" replied the hunter.  \"And if you require an explanation of the  gun in June, I confess I did hope to be able to pick off a squirrel for  a very sick friend.  But I suppose for even such cause it would not be  allowed on your premises.\"    \"Oh pshaw now!\" said Abram.  \"Man alive! I'm not onreasonable.  O'  course in case o' sickness I'd be glad if you could run across a  squirrel.  All I wanted was to have a clear understandin' about the  birds.  Good luck, an' good day to you!\"    Abram started across the field to Nancy, but he repeatedly turned to  watch the gleam of the gun-barrel, as the hunter rounded the corner and  started down the river bank.  He saw him leave the line of the fence  and disappear in the thicket.    \"Goin' straight for the sumac,\" muttered Abram.  \"It's likely I'm a  fool for not stayin' right beside him past that point.  An' yet--I made  it fair an' plain, an' he passed his word 'at he wouldn't touch the  birds.\"    He untied Nancy, and for the second time started toward the sumac.  He  had been plowing carefully, his attention divided between the mare and  the corn; but he uprooted half that row, for his eyes wandered to the  Cardinal's home as if he were fascinated, and his hands were shaking  with undue excitement as he gripped the plow handles.  At last he  stopped Nancy, and stood gazing eagerly toward the river.    \"Must be jest about the sumac,\" he whispered.  \"Lord! but I'll be glad  to see the old gun-barrel gleamin' safe t'other side o' it.\"    There was a thin puff of smoke, and a screaming echo went rolling and  reverberating down the Wabash.  Abram's eyes widened, and a curious  whiteness settled on his lips.  He stood as if incapable of moving.  \"Clang! Clang!\" came Maria's second warning.    The trembling slid from him, and his muscles hardened.  There was no  trace of rheumatic stiffness in his movements.  With a bound he struck  the chain-traces from the singletree at Nancy's heels.  He caught the  hames, leaped on her back, and digging his heels into her sides, he  stretched along her neck like an Indian and raced across the corn  field.  Nancy's twenty years slipped from her as her master's sixty had  from him.  Without understanding the emergency, she knew that he  required all the speed there was in her; and with trace-chains rattling  and beating on her heels, she stretched out until she fairly swept the  young corn, as she raced for the sumac.  Once Abram straightened, and  slipping a hand into his pocket, drew out a formidable jack-knife,  opening it as he rode.  When he reached the fence, he almost flew over  Nancy's head.  He went into a fence corner, and with a few slashes  severed a stout hickory withe, stripping the leaves and topping it as  he leaped the fence.    He grasped this ugly weapon, his eyes dark with anger as he appeared  before the hunter, who supposed him at the other side of the field.    \"Did you shoot at that redbird?\" he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53356"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 2 (of 3) (#12)"],[1,"into a small parlour, furnished with a most  obdurate looking horse-hair sofa, six horse hair chairs, ranged round  the walls, an impracticable arm chair, and a small round table,  covered with a bright red cloth; a diminutive looking glass over the  mantel-piece, on which were displayed a few cheap ornaments, and  a chiffonnier of mock rose-wood, with warped doors, completed the  inventory.    \"Tea, I think, Kate, will be the most acceptable refreshment. If you  will be so good as to let us have some tea, Mrs. Mrs. ----.\"    The Colonel paused.    \"Crooks,\" said the amiable lady.    \"Ah, yes, Mrs. Crooks.\"    \"Certainly, sir,\" and she retired, as the servant entered, with two  tall candles, unsteadily thrust into very short candlesticks.    It is unnecessary to describe the wretchedness of such an arrival, the  total derangement of all established comforts, and London lodging-house  tea and milk! and the professional rapidity, with which the servant  clatters down the plates, and deals out the knives, the ill-cleaned  Britannia metal tea-pot, the pale, market looking butter, all, all so  unlike home.    Nurse, who had taken Miss Vernon's _sac de nuit_, to her room, now came  to the rescue.    \"Ah, don't be breakin yer heart sthrivin to make tay, an' the wather  not half biled.

Sure I put a dust iv the rale sort into me  ban-box the last thing, an it's well them villains at that moiderin  Station, didn't lose it an' me box' an all, have a taste iv buthered  toast, here, me good girl, just bile up that kittle, an when it's bilin  mad, run up wid it; stay, I'll go down meself.\"    And Mrs. O'Toole prepared them a very refreshing cup of tea, which they  insisted on her sharing; and largely did she contribute to enliven  their first repast in the mighty metropolis, by her shrewd, caustic  remarks on the various little events of their journey.    \"Sure it's so quiet, we might think ourselves in the Priory,\" she said,  after a pause. \"Another bit of toast, Miss Kate, ye'r white wid the  journey, and the scrimmage, alanah.\"    \"Yes,\" replied the Colonel, \"it is singularly quiet here.\"    \"But listen to that distant, continuous roar,\" said Kate, \"what is it?\"  she asked of the girl, who was removing the tea things.    \"Plase ma'am it's the 'busses.\"    They were located in one of the numerous \"Albert Groves,\" or \"Victoria  Terraces,\" which congregate near, and diverge from the main Bayswater  Road.    After some more desultory conversation, the little party retired to  the rest they so much needed. Kate and nurse first carefully arranging  the Colonel's room; but long after she had laid her head on the hard  and diminutive lodging-house pillow, Kate's busy fancy kept sleep  aloof--the fact that she was actually in London, was almost incredible,  that the dreaded parting with the Winters, and the Priory--the terrible  exchange of all the sweet sanctities of home, for the uncertainties  and insecurity of lodgings--that all this so long anticipated, was  absolutely accomplished; and that from this time forward, a new world  of action--of reality--of sober, stern existence, lay before her. Such  thoughts as these were potent enemies to sleep. Then her last visit to  the great city, and its gaieties, and studies presented themselves;  and Lady Desmond's probable return--followed by a natural chain of  associations; and finally, the Priory, with its pretty garden; and the  neighbouring woods, in all their glories of autumn--as they looked the  day she found Fred Egerton seated with her grandfather, rose before her  mind's eye; and all the pleasant incidents of that happy time, unrolled  themselves before her--clearly at first, but, at length strangely  mingled with memories of Dungar, and older days still. Once or twice  she strove to reunite the broken chain of thought; but slowly they all  faded, and the hours of a short summer's night sped on their way; and  gradually her spirit woke from the first, deep sleep that fell upon it;  and wearied by the heaviness that had of late weighed it down, fled  joyously to the scenes of its early childhood; and summoned to its  side, the friends it loved--until a flood of morning sunshine pouring  into her room, woke her; and her eyes fell upon the broad comely  countenance of Mrs. O'Toole.    \"Athen, the blessin' iv Christ on ye, jewel; sure the angels was  whisperin' to ye in Heaven--ye wor smilin' so swate in your sleep.\"    \"Oh, nurse, why did you awake me? so soon I mean.\"    \"Soon,\" ejaculated Mrs. O'Toole, \"sure it's nine o'clock, so it is, an'  you that was always up at seven--\"    \"Nine! is it possible? But, nurse, are morning dreams always true?\"    \"Sure, I told ye so a hundred times, an' ye always laughed at me, was  it dreamin' ye wor, alanah?\"    \"Yes; of Dungar, and of such strange--but go, dear nurse--I will ring  soon for you. Have you seen grandpapa this morning? How did you sleep  yourself?\"    \"He's not rung his bell yet; an' I was as snug as any duchess.\"    To Kate's infinite delight, morning displayed a garden, some ten feet  square, in front of their new abode, sufficient to satisfy the elastic  conscience of the builder, in calling the row of houses, in which it  was situated, \"Victoria Gardens.\" True, it was not in that perfection  of keeping, so grateful to eyes susceptible of the beautiful; but still  the green of a few ragged lilacs, and laburnums, with the perfume of a  mignionette bed, was most refreshing; and so much better than anything  she had ventured to hope for--that she felt inexpressibly cheered.    The Colonel too, had slept well--at least, till daylight, when he had  been rather disturbed by the screams of a parrot, a great pet, Mrs.  O'Toole informed them, of their landlady. Breakfast over, and the  _Times_, secured for her grandfather, Kate was soon immersed in a long,  confidential letter to Winter and his wife.    Their late breakfast had encroached, more than she thought, upon the  morning, and she felt surprise when the landlady announced Mr. Langley;  and Winter's old friend entered. He was a long, pale man, with lightish  hair, and whey coloured whiskers; his manners, cold and shy, impressed  Kate with an uneasy feeling, that it would be impossible to set him at  ease.    \"Very much obliged by your early visit,\" said the Colonel, rising, with  his usual suave cordiality. \"We have to thank you for procuring for  us, such comfortable apartments--my granddaughter, Miss Vernon.\"    Mr. Langley bowed, and in so doing, upset a ricketty chair, whereupon,  he endeavoured to restore it to its former position, and in the  struggle, dropped his hat and gloves; at last his composure a little  restored, by the graciousness of his new acquaintances, he gathered  courage to ask, coldly, after Winter, and still more slightly for his  wife, to which the Colonel replied, by giving very copious details,  of their friends, and Kate thought he listened with more interest  than he ventured to express in words; some general conversation then  ensued--their journey, and the old city of A----, were discussed. Mr.  Langley glanced once or twice at his hat, which had unfortunately got  into an inaccessible corner, and Kate began to fear that this first  interview, to which she had looked, as to a mine of information,  whereby to form her plans, and guide her future proceedings, would pass  away in the vain repetition of polite nothings; while the Colonel, in  his high-bred anxiety to entertain his visitor, seemed to forget there  was any more serious subject to discuss, beyond the decline of the  drama, or the prospects of the ministry.    It was always with extreme reluctance that Kate, ever broached any  subject, connected with the realities of their position, in the  presence of her grandfather, now that all the necessary changes had  been made; and to this natural difficulty, was added the awkwardness  of introducing important queries, apropos to nothing. At last, taking  advantage of a pause in the Colonel's eloquence, of which Mr. Langley  seemed inclined to avail himself, to depart, she plunged boldly,  because desperately, into the subject uppermost in her thoughts.    \"I am most anxious to lose no time in endeavouring to get pupils. Mr.  Winter mentioned to you, I suppose?\"    \"Yes;\" said Langley, turning to her with more of complacency, than his  manner had hitherto exhibited, his painter's eye, probably caught by  her expressive countenance, and graceful figure. \"Yes, he mentioned  your intention--and I--that is, I hope you will not disapprove; I told  some friends of mine, professors of music, and they wish to hear you  play; and then they will be able to judge how far they can forward your  views.\"    \"Thank you,\" cried Kate, glancing nervously at the Colonel, to whose  high and usually pale forehead the color rose at this proposed  exhibition of his refined, noble, and graceful grandchild; \"you are  most kind to have anticipated my arrival; but,\" she added, covering her  face playfully with her hands, \"I never shall have courage for such an  exhibition, such an ordeal!\"    \"But if they never hear you perform, how can they recommend you?\" asked  Langley, in a matter-of-fact tone.    \"I did but jest,\" replied Kate, \"and am ready to do whatever you may  recommend.\"    \"Of course, if it is repugnant to Miss Vernon, however friendly and  judicious your suggestion, Mr. Langley, I cannot permit her,\" began the  Colonel, in disturbed accents.    \"Dearest grandpapa, this matter is between Mr. Langley and myself--you  may listen--but are not to interfere. Am I not right, Mr. Langley?\"    He bowed, startled into silent admiration, by the extreme beauty of her  smile.    \"I am silenced,\" said the Colonel.    \"Winter mentioned,\" resumed Langley, after a moment's pause, \"that  you were a pupil of Hermann's; I"]]]
