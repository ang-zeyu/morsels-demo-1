To this piteous appeal from one who had wandered far from the fold,  and who had been torn by the thorns, the Prophet wrote a most worthy  reply--a reply which clearly indicates that the spirit of the Master  burned brightly in the breast of the servant.                    JOSEPH SMITH'S LETTER TO W. W. PHELPS.                                 NAUVOO, HANCOCK CO., ILLINOIS, July 22, 1840.        DEAR BROTHER PHELPS--I must say that it is with no ordinary      feelings I endeavor to write a few lines to you in answer to yours      of the 29th ultimo; at the same time I am rejoiced at the privilege      granted me.        You may in some measure realize what my feelings, as well as      Elder Rigdon's and Brother Hyrum's were, when we read your      letter--truly our hearts were melted into tenderness and compassion      when we ascertained your resolves, etc. I can assure you I feel      a disposition to act on your case in a manner that will meet the      approbation of Jehovah, (whose servant I am) and agreeably to the      principles of truth and righteousness which have been revealed;      and inasmuch as longsuffering, patience and mercy have ever      characterized the dealings of our Heavenly Father towards the      humble and penitent, I feel disposed to copy the example, cherish      the same principles, and by so doing be a savior of my fellow men.        It is true, that we have suffered much in consequence of your      behavior--_the cup of gall, already full enough_ for mortals to      drink, was indeed _filled to overflowing_ when _you_ turned against      us. One with whom we had oft taken sweet counsel together, and      enjoyed many refreshing seasons from the Lord--\"had it been an      enemy, we could have borne it.\" \"In the day that thou stoodest on      the other side, in the day when strangers carried away captive his      forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon      Far West, even thou wast as one of them; but thou shouldest not      have looked on the day of thy brother, in the day that he became a      stranger, neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of      distress.\"        However, the cup has been drunk, the will of our Father has been      done, and we are yet alive, for which we thank the Lord. And having      been delivered from the hands of wicked men by the mercy of our      God, we say it is your privilege to be delivered from the powers of      the adversary, be brought into the liberty of God's dear children,      and again take your stand among the Saints of the Most High, and by      diligence, humility, and love unfeigned, commend yourself to our      God, and your God, and to The Church of Jesus Christ.        Believing your confession to be real, and your repentance genuine,      I shall be happy once again to give you the right hand of      fellowship, and rejoice over the returning prodigal.        Your letter was read to the Saints last Sunday, and an expression      was taken, when it was unanimously--        _Resolved_, That W. W. Phelps should be received into fellowship.             \"Come on, dear brother, since the war is past,           For friends at first are friends again at last.\"                                         Yours as ever,                                                    JOSEPH SMITH, JR.    Some time after this, when laying out work for the brethren to do, in a  sudden burst of kindness he said to his secretary:        Write Oliver Cowdery, and ask him if he has not eaten husks long      enough. If he is not almost ready to return, be clothed with robes      of righteousness, and go up to Jerusalem. Orson Hyde hath need of      him.    A letter was written accordingly, but the Prophet's generous tender  of forgiveness and fellowship called forth no response from Oliver  Cowdery, once the second Elder of The Church, and the first to make  public proclamation of the Gospel to the world. Subsequently, however,  he did return, namely in 1848.    It may not be amiss here to call the attention of the reader to a  peculiarity of Mormonism, which is illustrated, not only by this case  of Phelps, but by a multitude of other cases of the same character; and  that is: whenever the religion of the Latter-day Saints--the Gospel  of Jesus Christ--takes hold of men, and conviction of its truth has  struck deep into the human soul, they may through transgression lose  the fellowship of the Saints and of The Church; they may wander out  upon the hills and through the deserts, away from the fold, but they  can never forget the sweet communion of the Spirit of God, which they  enjoyed before their fall; nor can they forget the fact that they once  knew that Mormonism was true. The recollection of those things operates  upon the mind, and not infrequently leads to a sincere repentance; and  it has often happened, in the experience of The Church, that men who  through transgression turned away from the truth, after thorns have  torn their flesh, and the wild briar stripped them of their covering,  they return and humbly beg to be re-admitted into their Father's house.  Lucifer-like, they cannot forget the heights from which they fell, they  cannot all forget the splendor of that glory and the happiness of that  peace they enjoyed in God's Kingdom, and wicked indeed must that heart  become, that these recollections will not lead to repentance. May not  they have so far transgressed that they cannot repent, and are beyond  even the desire for forgiveness? Are they not the sons of perdition?  Thank God, their numbers are few!    Again, those who fall away from Mormonism carry with them the evidences  of that fall. Unbelievers say to Mormons, \"Come out of the darkness  of your superstitions into God's sunlight of freedom\"--but when one  looks upon the fate, the condition and experience of those who have  denied the faith, he receives small encouragement to obey the summons.  Seldom indeed are they prospered even in the affairs of this world, and  the canker-worm gnawing within, writes upon their faces the anguish  of heart which their lying lips deny. They smile, but smiling suffer;  the heart still beats, but brokenly lives on; and who so blind that he  would exchange the peace, the joy, the holy aspirations and assurances  which the Gospel brings, for the unrest, the gloom, darkness,  uncertainty and fearfulness, which forever haunt the mind of the  apostate? Only those who would exchange the glorious light of heaven  for the murky blackness of hell.        CHAPTER XII.    JOHN C. BENNETT.    ABOUT this time, there were other characters which had become attracted  to The Church, and who became prominent in the events which occurred  at Nauvoo. Among them was Dr. John C. Bennett, described as \"a man  of enterprise, extensive acquirements, and of independent mind, one  calculated to be of great benefit to The Church.\" His attention had  been attracted to the Mormon people during their persecutions in  Missouri. At that time he was brigadier-general of the \"Invincible  Dragoons\" of Illinois, and wrote to the leaders of The Church in the  hours of their deepest distress, proffering to go to their assistance  with all the forces he could raise in Illinois, as his bosom swelled  with indignation at the treatment the Saints received at the hands of  the cruel but cowardly Missourians. That proffered service, however,  was not accepted; doubtless because the Saints depended for vindication  of their reputation, and redress of their wrongs, upon the officers of  the State and Nation, rather than upon adventurers who offered their  service to wage war upon their enemies. But after the Saints began  gathering at Commerce, he again expressed a desire to connect his  fortunes with theirs.    As this man may properly be regarded as the \"Benedict Arnold\" of  The Church at Nauvoo, I shall take the liberty of now noting a few  expressions in his first letters to Joseph the Prophet, which, if they  fail to adorn a tale, they will at least point a moral.    When he contemplated joining his fortunes with The Church at Commerce,  he held the position of quartermaster-general in the militia of the  State of Illinois, a position he did not wish to resign. Indeed he  expressed a desire to hold the position for a number of years. He was  also a physician with an extensive practice, and sent extracts from the  Louisville _Courier-Journal_ which gave evidence of high standing in  his profession. Writing of these things to Joseph, he said:        I do not expect to resign my office of quartermaster-general of      the State of Illinois, in the event of my removal to Commerce,      unless you advise otherwise. I shall likewise expect to practice      my profession, but at the same time your people shall have all the      benefit of my speaking power, and my untiring energies in behalf of      the good and holy faith.    In a communication following the one from which I make the above  quotation he said:        You are aware that at the time of your most bitter persecution, I      was with you in feeling, and proffered you my military knowledge      and powers.    The egotism of the man plainly appears in these expressions, and  manifests a spirit that is altogether at variance with the humility  required by the Gospel, and doubtless that self-importance laid the  foundation of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],[0,"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#12)"],[1,"acon.\"    \"Beaver Island, July 18th, 1851.    \"Mr. Briggs:    \"Sir: Some time since I received a letter from you in which you claim  to take the liberty to write to me, on the ground that our acquaintance  had been such as to forbid personal enmities; and, therefore, you would  carry out the precept: 'Do unto others as you would have others do unto  you;' and that I was less orthodox in the pretenses of Strang, etc.,  than some others. * * * * * I will not notice the argument, powerful as  it may be, which you assert you have found upon examination, touching  the letter of appointment. But what examination can this be, in which  you have found out that you spoke that which was not true? _When you  declared in public congregations, at your own fireside, and at the  fireside of your neighbors_, that Joseph Smith wrote with his own  hand the 'Letter of Appointment' (for you saw him in vision) and your  surprise and faith in the 'knocking spirits' of New York, from the fact  that they (the spirits) asserted the same?\"    He represented the Beloit and Prairie branches of Strang's church at  the conference held in October, 1848, (Voree Record) and traveled quite  extensively for that cult from 1846 to 1850. When he joined William  B. Smith he acknowledged him as Prophet and leader, was ordained by  William B. Smith, an \"Apostle.\" After he left William B. Smith and  joined Zenas H. Gurley he claimed to have a revelation embodying the  very things he repudiated when he withdrew from the \"Reorganization.\"    To Mathias F. Cowley, in the presence of others, Mr. Briggs, a  short time before his death in answer to the question whether the  \"revelation\" he received in 1851 was true or not, said: \"You know we  learn by experience. I would not like to claim it to be a revelation  now, but it is just as good as any revelation that was given to Joseph  Smith.\"    Although he remained with the \"Reorganized\" Church for thirty years,  if this record does not show that he was unstable of character at the  beginning all the way through and \"to the end,\" pray tell, what does  instability mean!    9. The members of the \"Reorganized\" Church in the beginning laid great  stress on the statement that the Prophet Joseph Smith was smitten by  the shaft of death (D. & C. 85th sec.) for putting forth his hand to  steady the ark of God, and that his successor should be the \"one mighty  and strong,\" the Lord should send, \"holding the sceptre of power in his  hand, clothed with light for a covering, whose mouth shall utter words,  eternal words; while his bowels shall be a fountain of truth, to set in  order the house of God, and to arrange by lot the inheritances of the  Saints, whose names are found, and the names of their fathers, and of  their children, enrolled in the book of the law of God.\"    Mr. Briggs in his \"revelation\" says the Prophet's successor should be  one mighty and strong and one of his seed, and for years the claim  was made that Joseph Smith the present head of the \"Reorganization,\"  was that personage. This is emphatically declared in the \"Successor,\"  (revised edition) and in various numbers of the \"Saints' Herald\" and  other of their publications. This is from page 66, Vol. 17, True L.  D. S. Herald: \"God foreknew the character of sister Emma--that she  would be faithful and true to him who had called her--and he _elected_  her to be the mother of the successor of the Martyr--the \"one mighty  and strong,\" who is \"to set in order the _house_ of God, (i. e., the  church; see I. Tim. iii. 15; I. Pet. iv. 17; Heb. iii. 6), and arrange  by lot the inheritances of the Saints; the man who shall lead them (the  Saints) like as Moses led the children of Israel, (which was by direct  revelation from God), and who, when sent of God, would find the Saints  in 'bondage,' from which they should be 'led out' by power, (of God)  'and with a stretched out arm.'\"    That's the way they formerly gave it; but they have been forced to  recede because their president has not come up to this standard of the  one spoken of in the Prophet's revelation. Therefore they have, since  1900, resolved:    \"Whereas, we have received no divine communication authorizing any  particular interpretation of the revelation before us; and as the  Reorganized Church has never taken action upon the matter;    \"Resolved, that we leave it an open question, to be decided as God  may develop His purposes among us, while we acknowledge the leading  features in it to be prominently characteristic of Jesus Christ.\" (From  a letter by Joseph Smith of the \"Reorganization\" in my possession--J.  F. S., Jr.)    This is rather a hard jolt to Mr. Briggs' \"revelation.\"    10. The Reorganite \"defender\" says, \"Also, we wish Mr. Smith to note,  that the Lord in the same connection says, 'If my people will hearken  to my voice,' they shall not be moved out of their place. Were they  moved? Yes, they were cannonaded from Nauvoo, their enemies scattered  them, some of them went to Utah. Was it because they \"hearkened,\" or  because they had not hearkened?\"    He misinterprets the Scriptures. Thus do they read:    \"And if my people will hearken unto my voice, _and unto the voice of  my servants whom I have appointed to lead my people_, behold, verily I  say unto you, they shall not be moved out of their place\" (verse 45).  Who these _servants_ were that the Saints should _\"hearken\"_ to, the  Lord informs us in verses 124 to 129 of this same section. \"First, I  give unto you Hyrum Smith, to be a Patriarch unto you, * * * I give  unto you Joseph Smith, to be a presiding elder over all my Church. *  * * I give unto him for counselors my servant Sidney Rigdon, and my  servant William Law. * * * * I give unto you my servant Brigham Young,  to be a President over the Twelve traveling council, which Twelve hold  the keys to open up the authority of my kingdom upon the four corners  of the earth, and after that to send my word to every creature; They  are--Heber C. Kimball, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, Orson Hyde,  William Smith, John Taylor, John E. Page, Wilford Woodruff, Willard  Richards, George A. Smith.\" These were the general authorities who  were to be _\"hearkened\"_ to. And the people hearkened to the Prophets  Joseph and Hyrum Smith until their death, then the right of presidency  fell on the shoulders of the Twelve. The faithful Saints \"hearkened\" to  them and helped them to build the Temple. But the unfaithful rejected  these servants whom the Lord in this revelation gave to the Church  for the Saints to hearken to, departed from Nauvoo, refused to comply  with the command of the Lord to build His house, and were consequently  _moved out of their place_ in the Church into the \"Reorganization.\" The  moving \"out of their place\" did not refer to the location (Nauvoo) but  to their place in the Kingdom of God; or, the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints. And all who refused to obey this commandment  and hearken to these _servants_ were removed from the Church. \"But if  they will not hearken to my voice, _nor unto the voice of these men  whom I have appointed_, they shall not be blest, because they pollute  mine holy grounds, and mine holy ordinances, and charters, and my holy  words which I give unto them. And it shall come to pass, That if you  build a house unto my name, and _do not do the things that I say_, (i.  e., hearken to \"the voice of these men whom I have appointed\") I will  not perform the oath which I make unto you, neither fulfil the promise  which ye expect at my hands, saith the Lord.\" (verses 46-7).    11. The Reorganite response to this is as follows: \"Not by any means,  no such an indication. We have seen that they were diligent _in_ May  1842--not _up to_. The corner-stone of the edifice had been laid April  6, 1841, over a year from the date of the quotation. Room for a great  deal of lagging between those two periods of time.\"    \"The next quotation is from Hyrum Smith (no reference) at the April  Conference, 1844, who speaks of, as Joseph F. Smith [Jr.], puts it, the  'willingness of the Saints to do the work as late as 1844.' Yes, but he  does not say they had been willing afforded time _up to_ 1844. From May  1842, to April, 1844, (nearly two years), afforded time to be guilty of  lethargy and to falter enough to incur the penalty the fiat of the Lord  had fixed.\"    Such miserable, puerile, balderdash set forth as argument, is  disgusting. Nevertheless it is characteristic of the \"defense\"  writer who, throughout, argues in this fashion, failing to present  the quotations he attacks for fear his readers will discover his  dishonorable methods. He was afraid to present to his readers the  quotation from the remarks of Patriarch Hyrum Smith and the quotation  from the Prophet wherein he said:    \"Never since the formation of this Church was laid have we seen  manifest a greater willingness to comply with the requisitions of  Jehovah, a more ardent desire to do the will of God; more strenuous  exertions used or greater sacrifices made, than have been SINCE _the  Lord said_, LET THE TEMPLE BE BUILT BY THE TITHING OF MY PEOPLE!\"    The reasons he did not give these quotations is, that he knew his  readers would see his trickery and deception. Then he goes on to argue  that the Saints were not _diligent_ in September 1841, because the Lord  said at that time: \"Let the work of my Temple, and _all the works which  I have appointed unto you_, be continued on and not cease, let _your  diligence_ and _your perseverance_, and _patience_, and _your works be  redoubled_, and you shall in no wise lose your reward.\" (My italics).  Therefore, he argues, \"they were not sufficiently diligent at that  time,\" because they were commanded to _redouble_ their works. \"That at  least makes one positive break in Mr. Smith's chain of diligence.\"    Let us see: their works that were to be redoubled were not confined to  the building of the Temple, and the context of this"]]]
