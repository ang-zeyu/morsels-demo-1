And this would not  be--circulus vitiosus deus?    57. The distance, and as it were the space around man, grows with the  strength of his intellectual vision and insight: his world becomes  profounder; new stars, new enigmas, and notions are ever coming into  view. Perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised  its acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercise,  something of a game, something for children and childish minds. Perhaps  the most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting and  suffering, the conceptions \"God\" and \"sin,\" will one day seem to us of  no more importance than a child's plaything or a child's pain seems to  an old man;--and perhaps another plaything and another pain will then  be necessary once more for \"the old man\"--always childish enough, an  eternal child!    58. Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or  semi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for its  favourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for its soft  placidity called \"prayer,\" the state of perpetual readiness for the  \"coming of God\"), I mean the idleness with a good conscience, the  idleness of olden times and of blood, to which the aristocratic  sentiment that work is DISHONOURING--that it vulgarizes body and  soul--is not quite unfamiliar? And that consequently the modern, noisy,  time-engrossing, conceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates  and prepares for \"unbelief\" more than anything else? Among these, for  instance, who are at present living apart from religion in Germany, I  find \"free-thinkers\" of diversified species and origin, but above all  a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation  has dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know what  purpose religions serve, and only note their existence in the world  with a kind of dull astonishment. They feel themselves already fully  occupied, these good people, be it by their business or by their  pleasures, not to mention the \"Fatherland,\" and the newspapers, and  their \"family duties\"; it seems that they have no time whatever left  for religion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a  question of a new business or a new pleasure--for it is impossible, they  say to themselves, that people should go to church merely to spoil  their tempers. They are by no means enemies of religious customs;  should certain circumstances, State affairs perhaps, require their  participation in such customs, they do what is required, as so many  things are done--with a patient and unassuming seriousness, and without  much curiosity or discomfort;--they live too much apart and outside  to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matters. Among  those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of  German Protestants of the middle classes, especially in the great  laborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laborious  scholars, and the entire University personnel (with the exception of  the theologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives  psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). On the part of  pious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea of HOW  MUCH good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a  German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his whole  profession (and as I have said, his whole workmanlike laboriousness, to  which he is compelled by his modern conscience) inclines him to a  lofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion, with which is  occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the \"uncleanliness\" of spirit  which he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong  to the Church. It is only with the help of history (NOT through his own  personal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing  himself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain timid deference  in presence of religions; but even when his sentiments have reached the  stage of gratitude towards them, he has not personally advanced one  step nearer to that which still maintains itself as Church or as piety;  perhaps even the contrary. The practical indifference to religious  matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up, usually  sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness, which  shuns contact with religious men and things; and it may be just the  depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the  delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it.--Every age has  its own divine type of naivete, for the discovery of which other ages  may envy it: and how much naivete--adorable, childlike, and boundlessly  foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in  his superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the  unsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the  religious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and  ABOVE which he himself has developed--he, the little arrogant dwarf  and mob-man, the sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of \"ideas,\" of  \"modern ideas\"!    59. Whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what  wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. It is their  preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty, lightsome, and  false. Here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration  of \"pure forms\" in philosophers as well as in artists: it is not to be  doubted that whoever has NEED of the cult of the superficial to that  extent, has at one time or another made an unlucky dive BENEATH it.  Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt  children, the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying  to FALSIFY its image (as if taking wearisome revenge on it), one might  guess to what degree life has disgusted them, by the extent to which  they wish to see its image falsified, attenuated, ultrified, and  deified,--one might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists, as  their HIGHEST rank. It is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable  pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a  religious interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct which  divines that truth might be attained TOO soon, before man has become  strong enough, hard enough, artist enough.... Piety, the \"Life in God,\"  regarded in this light, would appear as the most elaborate and  ultimate product of the FEAR of truth, as artist-adoration  and artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of all  falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth at  any price. Perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means of  beautifying man than piety, by means of it man can become so artful, so  superficial, so iridescent, and so good, that his appearance no longer  offends.    60. To love mankind FOR GOD'S SAKE--this has so far been the noblest and  remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained. That love to mankind,  without any redeeming intention in the background, is only an ADDITIONAL  folly and brutishness, that the inclination to this love has first to  get its proportion, its delicacy, its gram of salt and sprinkling  of ambergris from a higher inclination--whoever first perceived  and \"experienced\" this, however his tongue may have stammered as it  attempted to express such a delicate matter, let him for all time be  holy and respected, as the man who has so far flown highest and gone  astray in the finest fashion!    61. The philosopher, as WE free spirits understand him--as the man of  the greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for the general  development of mankind,--will use religion for his disciplining and  educating work, just as he will use the contemporary political  and economic conditions. The selecting and disciplining  influence--destructive, as well as creative and fashioning--which can be  exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied, according to the  sort of people placed under its spell and protection. For those who are  strong and independent, destined and trained to command, in whom the  judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion is  an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of  authority--as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common,  betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter,  their inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience. And in the  case of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue of superior  spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative  life, reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government  (over chosen disciples or members of an order), religion itself may  be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of  managing GROSSER affairs, and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE  filth of all political agitation. The Brahmins, for instance, understood  this fact. With the help of a religious organization, they secured to  themselves the power of nominating kings for the people, while their  sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside, as men with a higher  and super-regal mission. At the same time religion gives inducement and  opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future  ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes, in which,  through fortunate marriage customs,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4367"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete (#12)"],[1,"that borders the bank of the Rio  Grande is reached.  This river, like the Mississippi, flows through a  rich alluvial valley in the most meandering manner, running towards all  points of the compass at times within a few miles.  Formerly the river  ran by Resaca de la Palma, some four or five miles east of the present  channel.  The old bed of the river at Resaca had become filled at  places, leaving a succession of little lakes.  The timber that had  formerly grown upon both banks, and for a considerable distance out, was  still standing.  This timber was struck six or eight miles out from the  besieged garrison, at a point known as Palo Alto--\"Tall trees\" or  \"woods.\"    Early in the forenoon of the 8th of May as Palo Alto was approached, an  army, certainly outnumbering our little force, was seen, drawn up in  line of battle just in front of the timber.  Their bayonets and  spearheads glistened in the sunlight formidably.  The force was composed  largely of cavalry armed with lances.  Where we were the grass was tall,  reaching nearly to the shoulders of the men, very stiff, and each stock  was pointed at the top, and hard and almost as sharp as a  darning-needle. General Taylor halted his army before the head of column  came in range of the artillery of the Mexicans.  He then formed a line  of battle, facing the enemy.  His artillery, two batteries and two  eighteen-pounder iron guns, drawn by oxen, were placed in position at  intervals along the line.  A battalion was thrown to the rear, commanded  by Lieutenant-Colonel Childs, of the artillery, as reserves.  These  preparations completed, orders were given for a platoon of each company  to stack arms and go to a stream off to the right of the command, to  fill their canteens and also those of the rest of their respective  companies.  When the men were all back in their places in line, the  command to advance was given.  As I looked down that long line of about  three thousand armed men, advancing towards a larger force also armed,  I thought what a fearful responsibility General Taylor must feel,  commanding such a host and so far away from friends.  The Mexicans  immediately opened fire upon us, first with artillery and then with  infantry.  At first their shots did not reach us, and the advance was  continued.  As we got nearer, the cannon balls commenced going through  the ranks.  They hurt no one, however, during this advance, because they  would strike the ground long before they reached our line, and  ricochetted through the tall grass so slowly that the men would see them  and open ranks and let them pass.  When we got to a point where the  artillery could be used with effect, a halt was called, and the battle  opened on both sides.    The infantry under General Taylor was armed with flint-lock muskets, and  paper cartridges charged with powder, buck-shot and ball.  At the  distance of a few hundred yards a man might fire at you all day without  your finding it out.  The artillery was generally six-pounder brass guns  throwing only solid shot; but General Taylor had with him three or four  twelve-pounder howitzers throwing shell, besides his eighteen-pounders  before spoken of, that had a long range.  This made a powerful armament.  The Mexicans were armed about as we were so far as their infantry was  concerned, but their artillery only fired solid shot.  We had greatly  the advantage in this arm.    The artillery was advanced a rod or two in front of the line, and opened  fire.  The infantry stood at order arms as spectators, watching the  effect of our shots upon the enemy, and watching his shots so as to step  out of their way.  It could be seen that the eighteen-pounders and the  howitzers did a great deal of execution.  On our side there was little  or no loss while we occupied this position.  During the battle Major  Ringgold, an accomplished and brave artillery officer, was mortally  wounded, and Lieutenant Luther, also of the artillery, was struck.  During the day several advances were made, and just at dusk it became  evident that the Mexicans were falling back. We again advanced, and  occupied at the close of the battle substantially the ground held by the  enemy at the beginning.  In this last move there was a brisk fire upon  our troops, and some execution was done.  One cannon-ball passed through  our ranks, not far from me.  It took off the head of an enlisted man,  and the under jaw of Captain Page of my regiment, while the splinters  from the musket of the killed soldier, and his brains and bones, knocked  down two or three others, including one officer, Lieutenant Wallen,  --hurting them more or less.  Our casualties for the day were nine killed  and forty-seven wounded.    At the break of day on the 9th, the army under Taylor was ready to renew  the battle; but an advance showed that the enemy had entirely left our  front during the night.  The chaparral before us was impenetrable except  where there were roads or trails, with occasionally clear or bare spots  of small dimensions.  A body of men penetrating it might easily be  ambushed.  It was better to have a few men caught in this way than the  whole army, yet it was necessary that the garrison at the river should  be relieved.  To get to them the chaparral had to be passed.  Thus I  assume General Taylor reasoned.  He halted the army not far in advance  of the ground occupied by the Mexicans the day before, and selected  Captain C. F. Smith, of the artillery, and Captain McCall, of my  company, to take one hundred and fifty picked men each and find where  the enemy had gone.  This left me in command of the company, an honor  and responsibility I thought very great.    Smith and McCall found no obstruction in the way of their advance until  they came up to the succession of ponds, before described, at Resaca.  The Mexicans had passed them and formed their lines on the opposite  bank.  This position they had strengthened a little by throwing up dead  trees and brush in their front, and by placing artillery to cover the  approaches and open places.  Smith and McCall deployed on each side of  the road as well as they could, and engaged the enemy at long range.  Word was sent back, and the advance of the whole army was at once  commenced.  As we came up we were deployed in like manner.  I was with  the right wing, and led my company through the thicket wherever a  penetrable place could be found, taking advantage of any clear spot that  would carry me towards the enemy.  At last I got pretty close up without  knowing it.  The balls commenced to whistle very thick overhead, cutting  the limbs of the chaparral right and left.  We could not see the enemy,  so I ordered my men to lie down, an order that did not have to be  enforced.  We kept our position until it became evident that the enemy  were not firing at us, and then withdrew to find better ground to  advance upon.    By this time some progress had been made on our left.  A section of  artillery had been captured by the cavalry, and some prisoners had been  taken.  The Mexicans were giving way all along the line, and many of  them had, no doubt, left early.  I at last found a clear space  separating two ponds.  There seemed to be a few men in front and I  charged upon them with my company.    There was no resistance, and we captured a Mexican colonel, who had been  wounded, and a few men.  Just as I was sending them to the rear with a  guard of two or three men, a private came from the front bringing back  one of our officers, who had been badly wounded in advance of where I  was.  The ground had been charged over before.  My exploit was equal to  that of the soldier who boasted that he had cut off the leg of one of  the enemy.  When asked why he did not cut off his head, he replied:  \"Some one had done that before.\"  This left no doubt in my mind but that  the battle of Resaca de la Palma would have been won, just as it was, if  I had not been there.  There was no further resistance. The evening of  the 9th the army was encamped on its old ground near the Fort, and the  garrison was relieved.  The siege had lasted a number of days, but the  casualties were few in number.  Major Jacob Brown, of the 7th infantry,  the commanding officer, had been killed, and in his honor the fort was  named. Since then a town of considerable importance has sprung up on the  ground occupied by the fort and troops, which has also taken his name.    The battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma seemed to us engaged, as  pretty important affairs; but we had only a faint conception of their  magnitude until they were fought over in the North by the Press and the  reports came back to us.  At the same time, or about the same time, we  learned that war existed between the United States and Mexico, by the  acts of the latter country.  On learning this fact General Taylor  transferred our camps to the south or west bank of the river, and  Matamoras was occupied.  We then became the \"Army of Invasion.\"    Up to this time Taylor had none but regular troops in his command; but  now that invasion had already taken place, volunteers for one year  commenced arriving.  The army remained at Matamoras until sufficiently  reinforced to warrant a movement into the interior.  General Taylor was  not an officer to trouble the administration much with his demands, but  was inclined to do the best he could with the means given him.  He felt  his responsibility as going no further.  If he had thought that he was  sent to perform an impossibility with the means given him, he would  probably have informed the authorities of his opinion and left them to  determine what should be done.  If the judgment was against him he would  have gone on and done the best he could with the means at hand without  parading his grievance before the public.  No soldier could face either  danger or responsibility more calmly than he.  These are qualities more  rarely found than"]]]
