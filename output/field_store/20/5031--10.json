In this blind way the meat is portioned off; strongly  reminding one of the game of \"button, button, who has the button?\" In  this chance game of the meat, the Booshway fares no better than his men;  unless, in rare instances, the little Booshway should indicate to the  man who calls off, that a certain choice piece is designed for the mess  of the leader or the second man.    A gun is never allowed to be fired in camp under any provocation, short  of an Indian raid; but the guns are frequently inspected, to see if they  are in order; and woe to the careless camp-keeper who neglects this or  any other duty. When the second man comes around, and finds a piece of  work imperfectly done, whether it be cleaning the firearms, making a  hair rope, or a skin lodge, or washing a horse's back, he does not  threaten the offender with personal chastisement, but calls up another  man and asks him, \"Can _you_ do this properly?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I will give you ten dollars to do it;\" and the ten dollars is set down  to the account of the inefficient camp-keeper. But he does not risk  forfeiting another ten dollars in the same manner.    In the spring, when the camp breaks up, the skins which have been used  all winter for lodges are cut up to make moccasins: because from their  having been thoroughly smoked by the lodge fires they do not shrink in  wetting, like raw skins. This is an important quality in a moccasin, as  a trapper is almost constantly in the water, and should not his  moccasins be smoked they will close upon his feet, in drying, like a  vice. Sometimes after trapping all day, the tired and soaked trapper  lies down in his blankets at night, still wet. But by-and-by he is  wakened by the pinching of his moccasins, and is obliged to rise and  seek the water again to relieve himself of the pain. For the same  reason, when spring comes, the trapper is forced to cut off the lower  half of his buckskin breeches, and piece them down with blanket leggins,  which he wears all through the trapping season.    Such were a few of the peculiarities, and the hardships also, of a life  in the Rocky Mountains. If the camp discipline, and the dangers and  hardships to which a raw recruit was exposed, failed to harden him to  the service in one year, he was rejected as a \"trifling fellow,\" and  sent back to the settlement the next year. It was not probable,  therefore, that the mountain-man often was detected in complaining at  his lot. If he was miserable, he was laughed at; and he soon learned to  laugh at his own miseries, as well as to laugh back at his comrades.          CHAPTER II.      The business of the rendezvous occupied about a month. In this period  the men, Indian allies, and other Indian parties who usually visited the  camp at this time, were all supplied with goods. The remaining  merchandise was adjusted for the convenience of the different traders  who should be sent out through all the country traversed by the company.  Sublette then decided upon their routes, dividing up his forces into  camps, which took each its appointed course, detaching as it proceeded  small parties of trappers to all the hunting grounds in the  neighborhood. These smaller camps were ordered to meet at certain times  and places, to report progress, collect and cache their furs, and \"count  noses.\" If certain parties failed to arrive, others were sent out in  search for them.    This year, in the absence of Smith and Jackson, a considerable party was  dispatched, under Milton Sublette, brother of the Captain, and two other  free trappers and traders, Frapp and Jervais, to traverse the country  down along the Bighorn River. Captain Sublette took a large party, among  whom was Joe Meek, across the mountains to trap on the Snake River, in  opposition to the Hudson's Bay Company. The Rocky Mountain Fur Company  had hitherto avoided this country, except when Smith had once crossed to  the head-waters of the Snake with a small party of five trappers. But  Smith and Sublette had determined to oppose themselves to the British  traders who occupied so large an extent of territory presumed to be  American; and it had been agreed between them to meet this year on Snake  River on Sublette's return from St. Louis, and Smith's from his  California tour. What befel Smith's party before reaching the Columbia,  has already been related; also his reception by the Hudson's Bay  Company, and his departure from Vancouver.    Sublette led his company up the valley of the Wind River, across the  mountains, and on to the very head-waters of the Lewis or Snake River.  Here he fell in with Jackson, in the valley of Lewis Lake, called  Jackson's Hole, and remained on the borders of this lake for some time,  waiting for Smith, whose non-appearance began to create a good deal of  uneasiness. At length runners were dispatched in all directions looking  for the lost Booshway.    The detachment to which Meek was assigned had the pleasure and honor of  discovering the hiding place of the missing partner, which was in  Pierre's Hole, a mountain valley about thirty miles long and of half  that width, which subsequently was much frequented by the camps of the  various fur companies. He was found trapping and exploring, in company  with four men only, one of whom was Black, who with him escaped from the  Umpqua Indians, as before related.    Notwithstanding the excitement and elation attendant upon the success of  his party, Meek found time to admire the magnificent scenery of the  valley, which is bounded on two sides by broken and picturesque ranges,  and overlooked by that magnificent group of mountains, called the Three  Tetons, towering to a height of fourteen thousand feet. This emerald cup  set in its rim of amethystine mountains, was so pleasant a sight to the  mountain-men that camp was moved to it without delay, where it remained  until some time in September, recruiting its animals and preparing for  the fall hunt.    Here again the trappers indulged in their noisy sports and rejoicing,  ostensibly on account of the return of the long-absent Booshway. There  was little said of the men who had perished in that unfortunate  expedition. \"Poor fellow! out of luck;\" was the usual burial rite which  the memory of a dead comrade received. So much and no more. They could  indulge in noisy rejoicings over a lost comrade restored; but the dead  one was not mentioned. Nor was this apparently heartless and heedless  manner so irrational or unfeeling as it seemed. Everybody understood one  thing in the mountains--that he must keep his life by his own courage  and valor, or at the least by his own prudence. Unseen dangers always  lay in wait for him. The arrow or tomahawk of the Indian, the blow of  the grizzly bear, the mis-step on the dizzy or slippery height, the rush  of boiling and foaming floods, freezing cold, famine--these were the  most common forms of peril, yet did not embrace even then all the forms  in which Death sought his victims in the wilderness. The avoidance of  painful reminders, such as the loss of a party of men, was a natural  instinct, involving also a principle of self defence--since to have weak  hearts would be the surest road to defeat in the next dangerous  encounter. To keep their hearts \"big,\" they must be gay, they must not  remember the miserable fate of many of their one-time comrades. Think of  that, stern moralist and martinet in propriety! Your fur collar hangs in  the gas-lighted hall. In your luxurious dressing gown and slippers, by  the warmth of a glowing grate, you muse upon the depravity of your  fellow men. But imagine yourself, if you can, in the heart of an  interminable wilderness. Let the snow be three or four feet deep, game  scarce, Indians on your track: escaped from these dangers, once more  beside a camp fire, with a roast of buffalo meat on a stick before it,  and several of your companions similarly escaped, and destined for the  same chances to-morrow, around you. Do you fancy you should give much  time to lamenting the less lucky fellows who were left behind frozen,  starved, or scalped? Not you. You would be fortifying yourself against  to-morrow, when the same terrors might lay in wait for you. Jedediah  Smith was a pious man; one of the few that ever resided in the Rocky  Mountains, and led a band of reckless trappers; but he did not turn back  to his camp when he saw it attacked on the Umpqua, nor stop to lament  his murdered men. The law of self-preservation is strong in the  wilderness. \"Keep up your heart to-day, for to-morrow you may die,\" is  the motto of the trapper.    In the conference which took place between Smith and Sublette, the  former insisted that on account of the kind services of the Hudson's Bay  Company toward himself and the three other survivors of his party, they  should withdraw their trappers and traders from the western side of the  mountains for the present, so as not to have them come in conflict with  those of that company. To this proposition Sublette reluctantly  consented, and orders were issued for moving once more to the east,  before going into winter camp, which was appointed for the Wind River  Valley.    In the meantime Joe Meek was sent out with a party to take his first  hunt for beaver as a hired trapper. The detachment to which he belonged  traveled down Pierre's fork, the stream which watered the valley of  Pierre's Hole, to its junction with Lewis' and Henry's forks where they  unite to form the great Snake River. While trapping in this locality the  party became aware of the vicinity of a roving band of Blackfeet, and in  consequence, redoubled their usual precautions while on the march.    The Blackfeet were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39471"],[0,"Zoological Illustrations, Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"when unaccompanied  by others more important and connected with the formation of shells. I have  therefore not hesitated in making this a distinct species, from having had  the means of examining at different times near twenty specimens, all of  which presented the following characters. Spire of five whorls, the last or  terminal one very small and flattened; the apex obtuse; the suture  depressed, as if flattened on the shell, and margined by one or sometimes  two indented lines, parallel, and at the top of each whorl. In the colour  of its mouth it varies in sometimes having a tinge of rose-colour at the  base and top of the spire, but the mouth is more generally white. The body  whorl is more or less ventricose; the outer lip is a little reflected, and  the whole shell, when full grown, much thicker and heavier than any of the  other species. The epidermis is yellowish-brown, beneath which the shell is  nearly white, beautifully marked with broad remote stripes of chesnut, with  others more slender (and sometimes broken into spots) between. I have  another specimen which agrees tolerably with Lister's figure in being more  than usually ventricose, and which I think is accidental. The only constant  variety appears to be that figured by Knorr, ii. tab. 3. fig. 1. having the  spire entirely rose-colour.    The marginal line and the correct number of whorls in the spire are well  expressed in the figures of Lister, Gualtieri and Knorr. The first of these  figures is accidentally more ventricose; the second, like all the other  figures of Gualtieri, is defective at the apex; and Knorr's I suspect has  been outrageously coloured from the real pink-mouthed _Achatina_.    It inhabits the coast of Guinea; and I am informed the animal is eaten by  the natives.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 31    [Illustration]    PHIBALURA cristata.    _Crested Shortbill._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.

Head crested, the feathers rufous, varied with      black. Wings, and elongated forked tail raven-black, immaculate.           *       *       *       *       *    For this beautiful and extraordinary bird I am indebted to Miss E. Yeates,  of the Dingle near Liverpool, who received it from South America. Its  general habit clearly points it out as belonging to the _Baccavorae_ or  Berryeaters, apparently connecting the genera _Procnias_ and _Pipra_, where  Temminck with much judgement has also placed it, in the new edition of his  _Manuel d'Ornithologie_ just received, and before reading which I had  considered the genus as unpublished.    The total length is nine inches, of which the tail occupies four and a  half. The bill is whitish, and is remarkably short, measuring only three  lines from the nostrils to the tip, but three quarters of an inch from the  angle of the mouth, which opens just under the eye: the plumage is  singularly variegated: the crown of the head is furnished with a crest,  which, when not elevated, is scarcely seen, and appears a deep glossy black  mixed with grey and rufous; but when erected it is very conspicuous, and  all the feathers are bright rufous tipt more or less with black; the upper  sides of the head grey, the lower part and ears deep-black; the neck above  is greyish-white, with blackish transverse lines: the back, scapulars, rump  and tail-covers are varied transversely with olive, shining black, and  bright yellow, each feather being olive at the base, black in the middle,  and yellow at the tip. Beneath the feathers of the chin and part of the  throat are somewhat lengthened, semi-setaceous, and of a bright yellow; the  neck and breast are white, with two transverse lines of deep black on each  feather; these lines diminish, and are broken into spots on the body, and  nearly disappear on the vent: the edges of the breast-feathers are tipt  with yellow, which colour increases downwards on the vent and tail-covers,  which latter are entirely yellow. The wings are four inches long, uniform  deep black with a blue gloss, much pointed, and calculated for rapid  flight. Tail the same colour, the exterior basal margins olive: all the  feathers are narrow, pointed, and gradually lengthening, the middle pair  being two inches three quarters longer than the outer pair, which exceed  those next them by an inch. The feet are very pale yellow, and  three-quarters of an inch from the knee to the claws, the three foremost of  which are equally connected together (though slightly) nearly as far as the  first joint; the outer and inner toes equal, and rather shorter than the  hind-toe: claws slender and much compressed.    Whether this species is the same as the one mentioned by Temminck as  existing in the French Museum under the name of _P. flavirostris_, it is  quite impossible to say, as the description of that bird has never been  published. This leads me to notice a custom several naturalists of the  present day have lately adopted, of publishing names, and names only, of  new or undescribed animals, which they then wish to be considered as  permanently fixed, and as having thus secured to themselves all the merit  of first describing. Now this at best is but a surreptitious path to fame,  and in many instances bears the appearance of originating in a petty  vanity, quite beneath the dignity of true science: it is easily fixing a  name to an object which we have not before seen, or suspect may be new,  without the trouble of investigating authors and comparing synonyms: the  name may remain, but if it should afterwards be discovered as hasty and  erroneous, its author is in no way amenable to the opinions and criticisms  of others, for they cannot discover such mistakes when no clue is given  them beyond a name, which may frequently be applicable to half a dozen  species. If, on the other hand, the object is really new, the scientific  world is still in the dark, for without a description the name conveys  nothing. Besides this, it has a tendency to deprive those writers of their  well-earned merit, who undergo the laborious but necessary investigation of  books, the examining and comparing of specimens, and the construction of  sound characters previous to their publishing a new addition to the great  volume of Nature. Against this _scientific monopoly_ a stand should be  made, and all names either of families, genera, or species should be  totally rejected, unless their meaning is clearly defined. Let those who  run the race, receive the wreath; and not let it be snatched from the  winning-post by another, who jumps from behind and claims it as his own.    On a careful examination of my specimen, I find the nostrils are not  covered by a membrane, as observed by Temminck, but are open, obliquely and  ovately round, and a narrow rim round the margin. That excellent  ornithologist likewise remarks that the first and second quill-feathers are  the longest; but my bird (which, however, is in full plumage) has the first  and third of equal length and shorter than the second, which is longest.  These nice distinctions lead me to suppose the species from which his  generic character was taken, is distinct from this.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 32    [Illustration]    PSARIS Cuvierii.    _Cuvier's Psaris._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum validum, crassum, conicum, basi rotundatum, versus apicem      leviter compressum, culmine convexo non carinato; mandibulis      emarginatis, superiore apice adunco.
