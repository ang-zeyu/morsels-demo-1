And there's Dunbog has warned the  Red Rotten and John Young aff his grunds--black be his cast! he's nae  gentleman, nor drap's bluid o' gentleman, wad grudge twa gangrel puir  bodies the shelter o' a waste house, and the thristles by the roadside  for a bit cuddy, and the bits o' rotten birk to boil their drap parritch  wi'. Weel, there's Ane abune a'; but we'll see if the red cock craw not  in his bonnie barn-yard ae morning before day-dawing.'    'Hush! Meg, hush! hush! that's not safe talk.'    'What does she mean?' said Mannering to Sampson, in an undertone.    'Fire-raising,' answered the laconic Dominie.    'Who, or what is she, in the name of wonder?'    'Harlot, thief, witch, and gipsy,' answered Sampson again.    'O troth, Laird,' continued Meg, during this by-talk, 'it's but to the  like o' you ane can open their heart; ye see, they say Dunbog is nae mair  a gentleman than the blunker that's biggit the bonnie house down in the  howm. But the like o' you, Laird, that's a real gentleman for sae mony  hundred years, and never hunds puir fowk aff your grund as if they were  mad tykes, nane o' our fowk wad stir your gear if ye had as mony capons  as there's leaves on the trysting-tree. And now some o' ye maun lay down  your watch, and tell me the very minute o' the hour the wean's born, an  I'll spae its fortune.'    'Ay, but, Meg, we shall not want your assistance, for here's a   student  from Oxford that kens much better than you how to spae its fortune; he  does it by the stars.'    'Certainly, sir,' said Mannering, entering into the simple humour of his  landlord, 'I will calculate his nativity according to the rule of the  \"triplicities,\" as recommended by Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Diocles, and  Avicenna. Or I will begin ab hora questionis, as Haly, Messahala,  Ganwehis, and Guido Bonatus have recommended.'    One of Sampson's great recommendations to the favour of Mr. Bertram was,  that he never detected the most gross attempt at imposition, so that the  Laird, whose humble efforts at jocularity were chiefly confined to what  were then called bites and bams, since denominated hoaxes and quizzes,  had the fairest possible subject of wit in the unsuspecting Dominie. It  is true, he never laughed, or joined in the laugh which his own  simplicity afforded--nay, it is said, he never laughed but once in his  life, and on that memorable occasion his landlady miscarried, partly  through surprise at the event itself, and partly from terror at the  hideous grimaces which attended this unusual cachinnation. The only  effect which the discovery of such impositions produced upon this  saturnine personage was, to extort an ejaculation of 'Prodigious!' or  'Very facetious!' pronounced syllabically, but without moving a muscle of  his own countenance.    On the present occasion, he turned a gaunt and ghastly stare upon the  youthful astrologer, and seemed to doubt if he had rightly understood his  answer to his patron.    'I am afraid, sir,' said Mannering, turning towards him, 'you may be one  of those unhappy persons who, their dim eyes being unable to penetrate  the starry spheres, and to discern therein the decrees of heaven at a  distance, have their hearts barred against conviction by prejudice and  misprision.'    'Truly,' said Sampson, 'I opine with Sir Isaac Newton, Knight, and  umwhile master of his Majesty's mint, that the (pretended) science of  astrology is altogether vain, frivolous, and unsatisfactory.' And here he  reposed his oracular jaws.    'Really,' resumed the traveller, 'I am sorry to see a gentleman of your  learning and gravity labouring under such strange blindness and delusion.  Will you place the brief, the modern, and, as I may say, the vernacular  name of Isaac Newton in opposition to the grave and sonorous authorities  of Dariot, Bonatus, Ptolemy, Haly, Eztler, Dieterick, Naibob, Harfurt,  Zael, Taustettor, Agrippa, Duretus, Maginus, Origen, and Argol? Do not  Christians and Heathens, and Jews and Gentiles, and poets and  philosophers, unite in allowing the starry influences?'    'Communis error--it is a general mistake,' answered the inflexible  Dominie Sampson.    'Not so,' replied the young Englishman; 'it is a general and  well-grounded belief.'    'It is the resource of cheaters, knaves, and cozeners,' said Sampson.    'Abusus non tollit usum.--The abuse of anything doth not abrogate the  lawful use thereof.'    During this discussion Ellangowan was somewhat like a woodcock caught in  his own springe. He turned his face alternately from the one spokesman to  the other, and began, from the gravity with which Mannering plied his  adversary, and the learning which he displayed in the controversy, to  give him credit for being half serious. As for Meg, she fixed her  bewildered eyes upon the astrologer, overpowered by a jargon more  mysterious than her own.    Mannering pressed his advantage, and ran over all the hard terms of art  which a tenacious memory supplied, and which, from circumstances  hereafter to be noticed, had been familiar to him in early youth.    Signs and planets, in aspects sextile, quartile, trine, conjoined, or  opposite; houses of heaven, with their cusps, hours, and minutes;  almuten, almochoden, anabibazon, catabibazon; a thousand terms of equal  sound and significance, poured thick and threefold upon the unshrinking  Dominie, whose stubborn incredulity bore him out against the pelting of  this pitiless storm.    At length the joyful annunciation that the lady had presented her husband  with a fine boy, and was (of course) as well as could be expected, broke  off this intercourse. Mr. Bertram hastened to the lady's apartment, Meg  Merrilies descended to the kitchen to secure her share of the groaning  malt and the 'ken-no,' [Footnote: See Note i.] and Mannering, after  looking at his watch, and noting with great exactness the hour and minute  of the birth, requested, with becoming gravity, that the Dominie would  conduct him to some place where he might have a view of the heavenly  bodies.    The schoolmaster, without further answer, rose and threw open a door half  sashed with glass, which led to an old-fashioned terrace-walk behind the  modern house, communicating with the platform on which the ruins of the  ancient castle were situated. The wind had arisen, and swept before it  the clouds which had formerly obscured the sky. The moon was high, and at  the full, and all the lesser satellites of heaven shone forth in  cloudless effulgence. The scene which their light presented to Mannering  was in the highest degree unexpected and striking.    We have observed, that in the latter part of his journey our traveller  approached the sea-shore, without being aware how nearly. He now  perceived that the ruins of Ellangowan Castle were situated upon a  promontory, or projection of rock, which formed one side of a small and  placid bay on the sea-shore. The modern mansion was placed lower, though  closely adjoining, and the ground behind it descended to the sea by a  small swelling green bank, divided into levels by natural terraces, on  which grew some old trees, and terminating upon the white sand. The other  side of the bay, opposite to the old castle, was a sloping and varied  promontory, covered chiefly with copsewood, which on that favoured coast  grows almost within water-mark. A fisherman's cottage peeped from among  the trees. Even at this dead hour of night there were lights moving upon  the shore, probably occasioned by the unloading a smuggling lugger from  the Isle of Man which was lying in the bay. On the light from the sashed  door of the house being observed, a halloo from the vessel of 'Ware hawk!  Douse the glim!' alarmed those who were on shore, and the lights  instantly disappeared.    It was one hour after midnight, and the prospect around was lovely. The  grey old towers of the ruin, partly entire, partly broken, here bearing  the rusty weather-stains of ages, and there partially mantled with ivy,  stretched along the verge of the dark rock which rose on Mannering's  right hand. In his front was the quiet bay, whose little waves, crisping  and sparkling to the moonbeams, rolled successively along its surface,  and dashed with a soft and murmuring ripple against the silvery beach. To  the left the woods advanced far into the ocean, waving in the moonlight  along ground of an undulating and varied form, and presenting those  varieties of light and shade, and that interesting combination of glade  and thicket, upon which the eye delights to rest, charmed with what it  sees, yet curious to pierce still deeper into the intricacies of the  woodland scenery. Above rolled the planets, each, by its own liquid orbit  of light, distinguished from the inferior or more distant stars. So  strangely can imagination deceive even those by whose volition it has  been excited, that Mannering, while gazing upon these brilliant bodies,  was half inclined to believe in the influence ascribed to them by  superstition over human events. But Mannering was a youthful lover, and  might perhaps be influenced by the feelings so exquisitely expressed by a  modern poet:--         For fable is Love's world, his home, his birthplace:       Delightedly dwells he 'mong fays, and talismans,       And spirits, and delightedly believes       Divinities, being himself divine       The intelligible forms of ancient poets,       The fair humanities of old religion,       The power,the beauty, and the majesty,       That had their haunts in dale, or piny mountain,       Or forest, by slow stream, or pebbly spring,       Or chasms and wat'ry depths--all these have vanish'd;       They live no longer in the faith of reason!       But still the heart doth need a language, still       Doth the old instinct bring back the old names.       And to yon starry world they now are gone,       Spirits or gods,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60235"],[0,"The Seventy's Course in Theology, First Year (#12)"],[1,"                      p. 9; also other Bible                                                                             Helps.

The order given is that in  which they stand in the English version. I. Esdras. II. Esdras. Tobit.  Judith. The rest of the chapters of the Book of Esther, which are found  neither in the Hebrew nor in the Chaldee. The Wisdom of Solomon. The  Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach, or Ecclesiasticus. Baruch. The Song  of the Three Holy Children. The History of Susanna. The History of the  Destruction of Bel and the Dragon. The Prayer of Manasseh, King of  Judah. I. Maccabees. II. Maccabees.\"[3]    A brief treatise on each of the foregoing books of the Apocrypha will  be found in the Seventy's Bible Dictionary, Art. Apocrypha, also in  \"Bible Treasury,\" pp. 351, 353; Tobias, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus,  Baruch, I and II Macabees will be found in the Roman Catholic English  version, known as the Douay Bible, the Roman Church regarding them as  of equal authority with other books of the Old Testament.    2. _Definition of Apocrypha:_ \"The word Apocrypha means \"secret\"  or \"hidden,\" and is applied to a class of writings which have been  definitely rejected from the books of the Old and New Testaments; but  the reason why they were called secret books, rather than private  or secondary books, is not clear. * * * * Probably every attempt to  define the limits of canonical or inspired books will result in the  distinction of three classes of books: (1) the Canonical Scriptures,  about which every one is agreed; (2) the disputed books, about which  there is no general agreement; (3) the books which are universally  rejected. It is to the third class that the term Apocrypha properly  applies, the intermediate class being more correctly known as  Antilegomena, or disputed books. * * * * * It is commonly stated that  the reason for the rejection of the books referred to from the Old  Testament [the Apocrypha] was that they were not found current in  Hebrew, but only in Greek. It is quite possible that in some cases  the reason why the books were not extant in Hebrew was that they had  been previously judged uncanonical. A book soon disappears when it has  been condemned. Even the Greek text of some parts of the Apocrypha has  perished--(e. g. II Esdras). We must not be surprised, therefore, if  some of the apocryphal books should turn out to have been at one time  extant in Hebrew.\" (Bible Treasury, p. 351.)    3. _Attitude of the Roman Catholic Church Respecting the Apocrypha:_  Some Catholic theologians previous to the Council of Trent, 1545-1563,  were in doubt as to the inspiration of some of the books of the  Apocrypha admitted into the Catholic Canon; but Dr. Smith, in his Bible  Dictionary, says: \"The Council of Trent closed the question which had  been left open, and deprived its theologians of the liberty they had  hitherto enjoyed--extending the Canon of Scripture so as to include all  the hitherto doubtful or deutero-canonical books, with the exception  of the two books of Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh, the evidence  against which seemed too strong to be resisted (Sess. IV. de Can.  Script). In accordance with this decree, the editions of the Vulgate,  published by authority, contained the books which the Council had  pronounced canonical, as standing on the same footing as those which  had never been questioned, while the three which had been rejected were  printed commonly in smaller type and stood after the New Testament.\"  (Dictionary p, 122.)    Catholics, however, insisted that the list of canonical books agreeing  \"in substance with the list of divinely inspired books, held by  Catholics to the present day,\" was authorized by the twenty-sixth  statute of the Council of Hippo, held in Africa in the year 393, and  the third Council of Carthage 397, A.. D., and the sixth Council of  Carthage 419, A. D., give the same list or canon of books as the  Council of Hippo. \"Although the inspiration of some of these books  was held to be doubtful by a few of the Fathers, previous to these  two Councils, the same Fathers ceased to have any doubt upon it after  the decision of these Councils; so that, while some of the Apocrypha  have been considered uninspired, as the third and fourth of Esdras,  and third and fourth of Macabees, some other of these books have been  recognized as inspired, and are called by Catholics Deutero-canonical.  These have, therefore, the very same sanction and authority that all  the books of the New Testament have, in addition to the long-standing  veneration of the Jewish Church for them.\" (Catholic Belief, Bruno, pp.  13-14.)    Catholics will be compelled, however, to admit that several books of  the Apocrypha now accepted by them and published in the Douay Bible,  are not in the list given by the three Councils above mentioned.  Moreover, in the list of General Councils published in Bruno's work,  in enumerating the achievement of the Council of Trent, he says: \"The  Catholic doctrine regarding _the Holy Scripture_, Tradition, Original  Sin, Justification, and the Seven Sacraments, was clearly explained.\"  (Catholic Belief, Bruno, p. 130.) So that it was not until the Council  of Trent, 1545-1563, that the final word respecting the Catholic canon  was spoken.    4. _The Protestant Attitude Toward the Apocrypha:_ \"The Reformers of  Germany and England * * * influenced in part by the revival of the  study of Hebrew and the consequent recognition of the authority of the  Hebrew canon, and subsequently by the reaction against this stretch of  authority, [exercised by the Council of Trent], maintained the opinion  of Jerome and pushed it to its legitimate results [which led to the  rejection of the books of the Apocrypha as scripture]. \"Luther spoke  of individual books among those in question with a freedom as great  as that of Jerome, judging each on its own merits, praising Tobit  as a \"pleasant comedy\" and the Prayer of Manasseh as a \"good model  for penitents,\" and rejecting the two books of Esdras as containing  worthless fables. The example of collecting the doubtful books in a  separate group had been set in the Strasburg edition of the Septuagint,  1526. In Luther's complete edition of the German Bible * * * (1534) the  books (Judith, Wisdom, Tobias, Sirach, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Additions to  Esther and Daniel, and the Prayer of Manasseh) were grouped together  under the general title of \"Apocrypha, i. e. 'Books which are not of  like worth with Holy Scripture,' yet are good and useful to be read. In  the history of the English Church, Wicliffe showed himself in this as  in other points the forerunner of the Reformation, and applied the term  'Apocrypha' to all but the 'twenty-five' Canonical books of the Old  Testament. The judgment of Jerome was formally asserted in the sixth  Article. The disputed books were collected and described in the same"]]]
