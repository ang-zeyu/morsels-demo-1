Indeed, the more obtrusive they are,  the better the purpose of the bedroom is believed to be served. If it  could be only understood how these unnecessarily occupy the air space  of the room, and interfere with its ventilation, this sort of thing  would never be tolerated for a moment.    And while on the subject of the accumulation of useless articles in a  bedroom, it seems fitting here to devote a few words to another kindred  matter, namely, the hoarding up throughout the house of what may  literally be designated as lumber. It is astonishing what a number of  utterly valueless things are allowed to remain in nearly every  household, and it is well remarked that no one ever knows what a  collection of rubbish he possesses till he has occasion to remove.  There may not be much to be ashamed of in the first load or two of  furniture, but at the latter end there is a strong feeling that a dark  night would be more adapted for moving--the darker the better. At  least every twelve months there should be a regular clearance of worn-out  articles, and that miscellaneous collection of odds and ends which  can be of no earthly value to anybody, unless he be an antiquary.    Let us now go on to consider what ill effects result from the breathing  of vitiated air. In his work, A Manual of Practical Hygiene, Professor  Edmund A. Parkes has pointed out: \"When air moderately vitiated by  respiration is breathed for any period and continuously, its effects  become complicated with those of other conditions. But allowing the  fullest effect to all other agencies, there is no doubt that the  breathing of the vitiated atmosphere of respiration has a most  injurious result on the health. The aeration and nutrition of the blood  seems to be interfered with, and the general tone of the system falls  below par. Of special diseases it appears pretty clear that affections  of the lungs are more common.\" The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by  the adult in the twenty-four hours averages 360 cubic feet, or 2,000  gallons, while the amount we take in the shape of liquid or solid food  does not amount probably to more than 5 1/2 pints, which is equal to  only 1-3000th part of the volume of air passed through the lungs. From  this it will be seen how necessary it is that such a large amount of  air should be perfectly fresh and wholesome, for the lungs act as a  pair of immense sponges or absorbers. When the ventilation does not  allow of a continuous supply of fresh air it smells close, and is  surcharged with an increased amount of carbonic acid, while the noxious  exhalations from the breath and lungs deposit themselves throughout the  room. Nor are the ill-effects of impure air confined to man alone, for  it is well known that cows, horses, sheep, and other animals, when  penned up in close quarters, show an increased death-rate from many  diseases.    But though it is perfectly plain that badly ventilated sleeping  apartments tend greatly to the production of diseases of the lungs, it  is not generally understood by the greater number of persons that  diseases of the heart are brought on by similar conditions, and there  is without doubt a great increase of heart diseases at the present  time. It is estimated that upwards of 10,000 people in England alone  die yearly from affections of the heart; yet, taking into consideration  the ceaseless work of that organ (in the words of the motto upon  Goethe's ring, \"Ohne Rast\"--without rest), it is wonderful that it is  not more frequently diseased. It is said that \"the heart is a small  muscular organ weighing only a few ounces, beating perpetually day and  night, morning and evening, summer and winter; and yet often an old  man's heart nearly a hundred years of age is as perfect and complete as  when he was a young man of twenty\" (Haughton).    The effect of impure air in its action on the heart is thus spoken of  by Dr. Cornelius Black: \"I showed the effect of impure air in promoting  the degenerative tendency in the structures of the heart, and  especially those of the right side of the heart, after the age of  forty. I was then led to a passing consideration of the baneful  influence produced upon the heart by badly-ventilated houses, schools,  manufactories, pits, theatres, underground railways, and all places of  a similar character.\" \"The impure atmosphere of the bedrooms of the  poor, and indeed of many of the middle class, caused by deficient  ventilation, proves a sharp spur to the degenerative tendency  manifested by the heart, and especially by the right side of the heart,  after the age of forty.\" \"I hold that the breathing of impure air is a  fruitful source of disease of the right side of the heart occurring  after middle age. How many people ignorantly favour its occurrence by  confining themselves to closely shut, non-ventilated, stuffy, sitting  rooms, in which the carbonic acid has accumulated to a poisonous degree  in the air they respire! How are these evil results to be prevented?  The simple answer is, let the rooms in which you live be effectively  ventilated by an incoming current of fresh air, and so arranged that no  draught shall be felt.\"    Sanitarians who have devoted a good deal of time and study to the  working out of questions relating to the amount of fresh air in  bedrooms have decided that each person should, if possible, have at  least 1,000 cubic feet of space, or in other words, the same amount  contained in a room 10 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet high. It is  also estimated that the amount of fresh air entering into a room of  this size should be 3,000 cubic feet per hour, that is, the air in each  room should be completely changed three times every hour. These  observations of course apply only to the least amount of air which  every sleeper is strictly entitled to. As a matter of fact, however,  any more than this is simply of distinct advantage as far as health is  concerned. The bedroom, instead of being the smallest room in the  house, as it too often is, should be really the very largest. Now it  has been previously stated that foul or vitiated air collects in a  sleeping apartment unless there be a continuous circulation of fresh  air; and that the noxious exhalations from the breath and skin  constitute the chief sources of air pollution. The practical point to  discover is how to have this continuous circulation of fresh air  throughout the room without causing a draught. Before considering this,  a few words on the position of the bed itself will possibly be  appropriate. It is always better to have it standing more in the centre  of the room with its head against the wall, than to have it jammed  alongside the latter. And it certainly should have placed north and  south if the shape of the room admits of it. The wire-wove mattress is  of great advantage both for comfort and for coolness; and here in  Australia, during the summer months, proper mosquito nettings are as  necessary as the bed itself. If the bed is provided with a head-piece,  as it should be, there is no difficulty in fitting on the netting.    Every bedroom window should be made to open freely, and what other  defects exist--such as the smallness of the apartment, or the absence  of a fireplace--can be remedied to a great extent by means of the  window. In many instances the bed is placed so near the latter that  when it is open there is a strong draught playing directly on the bed,  and this is an evil which must be avoided. In such case, to rectify  matters, raise the bottom window a few inches, and have a piece of  board made to fit in under it, so as to support the sash and fill in  the space between it and the sill. The air freely enters the room  between the two sashes, because the top of the lower sash is by this  contrivance raised above the lower part of the upper one. Another great  advantage is that the air is directed upwards to the ceiling by having  to come in over the lower sash, and thus a gentle current of fresh air  is constantly being circulated throughout the room without creating any  draught. There are other devices to attain the same end, such as having  apertures cut in the glass of the windows, but they are not so  effective, so inexpensive, nor so simple as the preceding. In  bedrooms there are the long French windows leading on to a balcony, and  where such is the case the air current can be regulated to a nicety by  having only one of the window-doors open, and directing the ventilation  away from the bed. Many people prefer to sleep with the door itself  open, and by having a PORTIERE or certain suspended outside, privacy  can be ensured, while an upright screen standing at the head of the bed  will effectually ward off any cold currents of air. In our summer  weather there is but little difficulty experienced in regulating the  air supply, for there is generally a desire to have as much fresh air  as possible. Far too many people, however, look upon the bedroom in the  light of an oven, where they are to be baked during the hours of  repose, and this is the case even during the summer. In the cooler  parts of the year they are apt to forget there is just as much  necessity for fresh air as in the warm months.    Soiled or dirty clothes should not on any account be allowed to remain  in the sleeping apartments, as they are a constant source of foulness  to the air. All unclean linen ready for the wash had better be kept  away from the bedroom in one of those long baskets which stand upright  and are furnished with a lid. They are admirably adapted for the  purpose, and may be obtained for a few shillings from any of the  institutions for the blind, where they are made by the inmates.

[115] Exo. xx, 3.    =30.= It has been stated that man possesses an instinct for worship,  that he craves and will find some object of adoration. When man fell  into the darkness of continued transgression, and forgot the Author of  his being, and the God of his fathers, he sought for other deities.  Some among men came to regard the sun as the type of the supreme, and  before that luminary they prostrated themselves in supplication.  Others selected for adoration earthly phenomena; they marvelled over  the mystery of fire, and, recognizing the beneficent effects of that  phenomenon, they worshiped the flame. Some saw, or thought they saw,  in water the emblem of the pure and the good, and they rendered their  devotions by running streams. Others, awed into reverence by the  grandeur of towering mountains, repaired to these natural temples, and  worshiped the altar instead of Him in whose honor and by whose power  it had been raised. Another class, more strongly imbued with a  reverence for the emblematic, sought to create for themselves  artificial objects of adoration. They made images and worshiped them;  they hewed uncouth figures from tree trunks, and chiseled strange  forms in stone, and to these they bowed.[116]        \"Nations, ignorant of God,      Contrive a wooden one.\"    =31.= Idolatrous practices in some of their phases came to be  associated with rites of horrible cruelties, as in the custom of  sacrificing children to Moloch, and, among the Hindoos, to the Ganges;  as also in the wholesale slaughtering of human beings, under Druidical  tyranny. The gods that human-kind have set up for themselves are  heartless, pitiless, cruel.[117]      [116] See Note 7.      [117] See Note 8.    =32.= Atheism, as before stated, is the denial of the existence of  God; in a milder form it may consist in the mere ignoring of Deity.  But the professed atheist, in common with his believing  fellow-mortals, is subject to man's universal passion for worship;  though he refuse to acknowledge the true and the living God, he  consciously or unconsciously deifies some law, some principle, some  passion of the human soul, or perchance some material creation; and to  this he turns, to seek, in contemplation of the unworthy object, a  semblance of the comfort which the believer finds in rich abundance  before the throne of his Father and God. I doubt the existence of a  thorough atheist,--one who with the sincerity of a settled conviction  denies in his heart the existence of an intelligent Supreme Power. The  idea of God is an essential characteristic of the human soul. The  philosopher recognizes the necessity of such an element in his  theories of being. He may shrink from the open acknowledgment of a  personal Deity, yet he assumes the existence of a \"governing power,\"  of a \"great unknown,\" of the \"unknowable,\" the \"illimitable,\" the  \"unconscious.\" Oh, man of learning though not of wisdom! why reject  the privileges extended to you by the omnipotent, omniscient Being to  whom you owe your life, yet whose name you will not acknowledge? No  mortal can approach Him while contemplating His perfections and might  with aught but awe and speechless reverence; regarding Him only as  Creator and God, we are abashed in thought of Him; but He has given us  the right to approach Him as His children, to call upon Him by the  endearing name of Father! And even the atheist feels, in the more  solemn moments of his life, a yearning of the soul toward a spiritual  Parent, as naturally as his human affections turn toward the father  who gave him mortal life. The atheism of to-day is but a species of  idolatry after all.    =33. Sectarian View of the Godhead.=--The consistent, simple, and  authentic doctrine respecting the character and attributes of God,  such as was taught by Christ and the apostles, gave way as revelation  ceased, and as the darkness incident to the absence of authority fell  upon the world, after the apostles and their priesthood had been  driven from the earth; and in its place there appeared numerous  theories and dogmas of men, many of which are utterly incomprehensible  in their mysticism and inconsistency. In the year 325 A.D., the  Council of Nice was convened by the emperor Constantine, who sought  through this body to secure a declaration of Christian belief which  would be received as authoritative, and be the means of arresting the  increasing dissension incident to the general disagreement regarding  the nature of the Godhead, and other theological subjects. The Council  condemned some of the theories then current; among them that of Arius,  which asserted a separate individuality for each member of the  Trinity; and promulgated a new code of belief known as the Nicene  Creed. A statement of this doctrine, supposedly as announced by  Athanasius, is as follows:--\"We worship one God in trinity, and  trinity in unity; neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the  substance. For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son,  and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, Son, and  Holy Ghost, is all one; the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal. Such  as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost. The  Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Ghost uncreate. The  Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Ghost  incomprehensible. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy  Ghost eternal. And yet there are not three eternals, but one eternal.  As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated;  but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible. So likewise the Father  is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Ghost almighty, and yet  there are not three Almighties, but one Almighty. So the Father is  God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, and yet there are not  three Gods, but one God.\" It would be difficult to conceive of a  greater number of inconsistencies and contradictions, expressed in  words as few.    =34.= The Church of England teaches the present orthodox view of God  as follows:--\"There is but one living and true God, everlasting,  without body, parts, or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and  goodness.\" The immateriality of God as asserted in these declarations  of sectarian faith is entirely at variance with the scriptures, and  absolutely contradicted by the revelations of God's person and  attributes, as shown by the citations already made.    =35.= We affirm that to deny the materiality of God's person is to  deny God; for a thing without parts has no whole, and an immaterial  body cannot exist.[118] The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints proclaims against the incomprehensible God, devoid of \"body,  parts, and passions,\" as a thing impossible of existence, and asserts  its belief in and allegiance to the true and living God of scripture  and revelation.      [118] See Note 9.         NOTES.         =1. Natural to Believe in a God.=--\"The great and primary truth       'that there is a God' has obtained among men almost universally       and in all ages; so that the holy scriptures, which speak of God       in every page, and which advert to the sentiments of mankind for       the period of about four thousand years, always assume this truth       as admitted. In the early ages of the world, indeed, there is no       positive evidence that speculative theism had any advocates; and       if, at a subsequent period, the 'fool said in his heart, There is       no God,' the sentiment appears more prominent in his affections       than in his judgment; and, withal, had so feeble an influence       over the minds of men, that the sacred writers never deemed it       necessary to combat the error, either by formal arguments, or by       an appeal to miraculous operations. Polytheism, not atheism, was       the prevailing sin; and therefore the aim of inspired men was not       so much to prove the existence of one God, as the non-existence       of others,--to maintain His authority, to enforce His laws, to       the exclusion of all rival pretenders.\"...         \"So clear, full, and overpowering is the evidence of God's       existence, that it has commanded general belief in all ages and       countries,--the only exceptions being a few savage tribes of a       most degraded type, among whom the idea of God has faded and       disappeared with every vestige of civilization; and a few       eccentric would-be philosophers who affect to doubt everything       which others believe, and question the truth of their own       intuitions, so that the general assent to the being of a God       might be added as a testimony of no small weight in this       argument.\"--_Cassell's Bible Dictionary; article \"God.\"_         =2. Importance of Belief in God.=--\"The existence of a Supreme       Being is, without doubt, the sublimest conception that can enter       the human mind, and, even as a scientific question, can have no       equal, for it assumes to furnish the cause of causes, the great       ultimate fact in philosophy, the last and sublimest       generalization of scientific truth. Yet this is the lowest demand       it presents for our study; for it lies at the very foundation of       morality, virtue, and religion; it supports the social fabric,       and gives cohesion to all its parts; it involves the momentous       question of man's immortality and responsibility to supreme       authority, and is inseparably connected with his brightest hopes       and highest enjoyments. It is, indeed, not only a fundamental       truth, but the grand central truth of all other truths. All other       truths in science, ethics, and religion radiate from this. It is       the source from which they all flow, the center to which they all       converge, and the one sublime proposition to which they all bear       witness.
