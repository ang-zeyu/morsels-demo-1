Or they may be compared to  the commanders of armies, whose forces usually increase in proportion  to their victories, and who need greater prudence to keep together the  residue of their troops after a defeat than after a victory to take  towns and provinces.  For he truly engages in battle who endeavors to  surmount all the difficulties and errors which prevent him from  reaching the knowledge of truth, and he is overcome in fight who admits  a false opinion touching a matter of any generality and importance, and  he requires thereafter much more skill to recover his former position  than to make great advances when once in possession of thoroughly  ascertained principles.  As for myself, if I have succeeded in  discovering any truths in the sciences (and I trust that what is  contained in this volume I will show that I have found some), I can  declare that they are but the consequences and results of five or six  principal difficulties which I have surmounted, and my encounters with  which I reckoned as battles in which victory declared for me.  I will  not hesitate even to avow my belief that nothing further is wanting to  enable me fully to realize my designs than to gain two or three similar  victories; and that I am not so far advanced in years but that,  according to the ordinary course of nature, I may still have sufficient  leisure for this end.  But I conceive myself the more bound to husband  the time that remains the greater my expectation of being able to  employ it aright, and I should doubtless have much to rob me of it,  were I to publish the principles of my physics:  for although they are  almost all so evident that to assent to them no more is needed than  simply to understand them, and although there is not one of them of  which I do not expect to be able to give demonstration, yet, as it is  impossible that they can be in accordance with all the diverse opinions  of others, I foresee that I should frequently be turned aside from my  grand design, on occasion of the opposition which they would be sure to  awaken.    It may be said, that these oppositions would be useful both in making  me aware of my errors, and, if my speculations contain anything of  value, in bringing others to a fuller understanding of it; and still  farther, as many can see better than one, in leading others who are now  beginning to avail themselves of my principles, to assist me in turn  with their discoveries.  But though I recognize my extreme liability to  error, and scarce ever trust to the first thoughts which occur to me,  yet-the experience I have had of possible objections to my views  prevents me from anticipating any profit from them.  For I have already  had frequent proof of the judgments, as well of those I esteemed  friends, as of some others to whom I thought I was an object of  indifference, and even of some whose malignancy and envy would, I knew,  determine them to endeavor to discover what partiality concealed from  the eyes of my friends.  But it has rarely happened that anything has  been objected to me which I had myself altogether overlooked, unless it  were something far removed from the subject:  so that I have never met  with a single critic of my opinions who did not appear to me either  less rigorous or less equitable than myself.  And further, I have never  observed that any truth before unknown has been brought to light by the  disputations that are practised in the schools; for while each strives  for the victory, each is much more occupied in making the best of mere  verisimilitude, than in weighing the reasons on both sides of the  question; and those who have been long good advocates are not  afterwards on that account the better judges.    As for the advantage that others would derive from the communication of  my thoughts, it could not be very great; because I have not yet so far  prosecuted them as that much does not remain to be added before they  can be applied to practice.  And I think I may say without vanity, that  if there is any one who can carry them out that length, it must be  myself rather than another:  not that there may not be in the world  many minds incomparably superior to mine, but because one cannot so  well seize a thing and make it one's own, when it has been learned from  another, as when one has himself discovered it.  And so true is this of  the present subject that, though I have often explained some of my  opinions to persons of much acuteness, who, whilst I was speaking,  appeared to understand them very distinctly, yet, when they repeated  them, I have observed that they almost always changed them to such an  extent that I could no longer acknowledge them as mine.  I am glad, by  the way, to take this opportunity of requesting posterity never to  believe on hearsay that anything has proceeded from me which has not  been published by myself; and I am not at all astonished at the  extravagances attributed to those ancient philosophers whose own  writings we do not possess; whose thoughts, however, I do not on that  account suppose to have been really absurd, seeing they were among the  ablest men of their times, but only that these have been falsely  represented to us.  It is observable, accordingly, that scarcely in a  single instance has any one of their disciples surpassed them; and I am  quite sure that the most devoted of the present followers of Aristotle  would think themselves happy if they had as much knowledge of nature as  he possessed, were it even under the condition that they should never  afterwards attain to higher.  In this respect they are like the ivy  which never strives to rise above the tree that sustains it, and which  frequently even returns downwards when it has reached the top; for it  seems to me that they also sink, in other words, render themselves less  wise than they would be if they gave up study, who, not contented with  knowing all that is intelligibly explained in their author, desire in  addition to find in him the solution of many difficulties of which he  says not a word, and never perhaps so much as thought.  Their fashion  of philosophizing, however, is well suited to persons whose abilities  fall below mediocrity; for the obscurity of the distinctions and  principles of which they make use enables them to speak of all things  with as much confidence as if they really knew them, and to defend all  that they say on any subject against the most subtle and skillful,  without its being possible for any one to convict them of error.  In  this they seem to me to be like a blind man, who, in order to fight on  equal terms with a person that sees, should have made him descend to  the bottom of an intensely dark cave:  and I may say that such persons  have an interest in my refraining from publishing the principles of the  philosophy of which I make use; for, since these are of a kind the  simplest and most evident, I should, by publishing them, do much the  same as if I were to throw open the windows, and allow the light of day  to enter the cave into which the combatants had descended.  But even  superior men have no reason for any great anxiety to know these  principles, for if what they desire is to be able to speak of all  things, and to acquire a reputation for learning, they will gain their  end more easily by remaining satisfied with the appearance of truth,  which can be found without much difficulty in all sorts of matters,  than by seeking the truth itself which unfolds itself but slowly and  that only in some departments, while it obliges us, when we have to  speak of others, freely to confess our ignorance.  If, however, they  prefer the knowledge of some few truths to the vanity of appearing  ignorant of none, as such knowledge is undoubtedly much to be  preferred, and, if they choose to follow a course similar to mine, they  do not require for this that I should say anything more than I have  already said in this discourse.  For if they are capable of making  greater advancement than I have made, they will much more be able of  themselves to discover all that I believe myself to have found; since  as I have never examined aught except in order, it is certain that what  yet remains to be discovered is in itself more difficult and recondite,  than that which I have already been enabled to find, and the  gratification would be much less in learning it from me than in  discovering it for themselves.  Besides this, the habit which they will  acquire, by seeking first what is easy, and then passing onward slowly  and step by step to the more difficult, will benefit them more than all  my instructions.  Thus, in my own case, I am persuaded that if I had  been taught from my youth all the truths of which I have since sought  out demonstrations, and had thus learned them without labour, I should  never, perhaps, have known any beyond these; at least, I should never  have acquired the habit and the facility which I think I possess in  always discovering new truths in proportion as I give myself to the  search.  And, in a single word, if there is any work in the world which  cannot be so well finished by another as by him who has commenced it,  it is that at which I labour.    It is true, indeed, as regards the experiments which may conduce to  this end, that one man is not equal to the task of making them all; but  yet he can advantageously avail himself, in this work, of no hands  besides his own, unless those of artisans, or parties of the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],[0,"Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#12)"],[1," \"You are all aware in some degree of what has happened.  You know     those chiefs to have been prisoners; you perhaps know that during the     term of their confinement I had it in my power to do them certain     favours.  One thing some of you cannot know, that they were     immediately repaid by answering attentions.  They were liberated by     the new Administration. . . .  As soon as they were free men--owing no     man anything--instead of going home to their own places and families,     they came to me.  They offered to do this work (to make this road) for     me as a free gift, without hire, without supplies, and I was tempted     at first to refuse their offer.  I knew the country to be poor; I knew     famine threatening; I knew their families long disorganised for want     of supervision.  Yet I accepted, because I thought the lesson of that     road might be more useful to Samoa than a thousand bread-fruit trees,     and because to myself it was an exquisite pleasure to receive that     which was so handsomely offered.  It is now done; you have trod it to-     day in coming hither.  It has been made for me by chiefs; some of them     old, some sick, all newly delivered from a harassing confinement, and     in spite of weather unusually hot and insalubrious.  I have seen these     chiefs labour valiantly with their own hands upon the work, and I have     set up over it, now that it is finished the name of 'The Road of     Gratitude' (the road of loving hearts), and the names of those that     built it.  'In perpetuam memoriam,' we say, and speak idly.  At least,     as long as my own life shall be spared it shall be here perpetuated;     partly for my pleasure and in my gratitude; partly for others     continually to publish the lesson of this road.\"    And turning to the chiefs, Mr Stevenson said:       \"I will tell you, chiefs, that when I saw you working on that road, my     heart grew warm; not with gratitude only, but with hope.  It seemed to     me that I read the promise of something good for Samoa; it seemed to     me as I looked at you that you were a company of warriors in a battle,     fighting for the defence of our common country against all aggression.     For there is a time to fight and a time to dig.  You Samoans may     fight, you may conquer twenty times, and thirty times, and all will be     in vain.  There is but one way to defend Samoa.  Hear it, before it is     too late.  It is to make roads and gardens, and care for your trees,     and sell their produce wisely; and, in one word, to occupy and use     your country.  If you do not, others will. . . .       \"I love Samoa and her people.  I love the land.  I have chosen it to     be my home while I live, and my grave after I am dead, and I love the     people, and have chosen them to be my people, to live and die with.     And I see that the day is come now of the great battle; of the great     and the last opportunity by which it shall be decided whether you are     to pass away like those other races of which I have been speaking, or     to stand fast and have your children living on and honouring your     memory in the land you received of your fathers.\"    Mr James H. Mulligan, U.S. Consul, told of the feast of Thanksgiving Day  on the 29th November prior to Mr Stevenson's death, and how at great  pains he had procured for it the necessary turkey, and how Mrs Stevenson  had found a fair substitute for the pudding.  In the course of his speech  in reply to an unexpected proposal of \"The Host,\" Mr Stevenson said:       \"There on my right sits she who has but lately from our own loved     native land come back to me--she to whom, with no lessening of     affection to those others to whom I cling, I love better than all the     world besides--my mother.  From the opposite end of the table, my     wife, who has been all in all to me, when the days were very dark,     looks to-night into my eyes--while we have both grown a bit older--with     undiminished and undiminishing affection.       \"Childless, yet on either side of me sits that good woman, my     daughter, and the stalwart man, my son, and both have been and are     more than son and daughter to me, and have brought into my life mirth     and beauty.  Nor is this all.  There sits the bright boy dear to my     heart, full of the flow and the spirits of boyhood, so that I can even     know that for a time at least we have still the voice of a child in     the house.\"    Mr A. W. Mackay gives an account of the funeral and a description of the  burial-place, ending:       \"Tofa Tusitala!  Sleep peacefully! on thy mountain-top, alone in     Nature's sanctity, where the wooddove's note, the moaning of the waves     as they break unceasingly on the distant reef, and the sighing of the     winds in the distant tavai trees chant their requiem.\"    The Rev. Mr Clarke tells of the constant and active interest Mr Stevenson  took in the missionaries and their work, often aiding them by his advice  and fine insight into the character of the natives; and a translation  follows of a dirge by one of the chiefs, so fine that we must give it:       I.       \"Listen, O this world, as I tell of the disaster     That befell in the late afternoon;     That broke like a wave of the sea     Suddenly and swiftly, blinding our eyes.     Alas for Loia who speaks tears in his voice!       _Refrain_--Groan and weep, O my heart, in its sorrow.     Alas for Tusitala, who rests in the forest!     Aimlessly we wait, and sorrowing.  Will he again return?     Lament, O Vailima, waiting and ever waiting!     Let us search and inquire of the captain of ships,     'Be not angry, but has not Tusitala come?'       II.       \"Teuila, sorrowing one, come thou hither!     Prepare me a letter, and I will carry it.     Let her Majesty Victoria be told     That Tusitala, the loving one, has been taken hence.       _Refrain_--Groan and weep, O my heart, etc., etc.       III.       \"Alas! my heart weeps with anxious grief     As I think of the days before us:     Of the white men gathering for the Christmas assembly!     Alas for Aolele! left in her loneliness,     And the men of Vailima, who weep together     Their leader--their leader being taken.       _Refrain_--Groan and weep, O my heart, etc., etc.       IV.       \"Alas! O my heart! it weeps unceasingly     When I think of his illness     Coming upon him with fatal swiftness.     Would that it waited a glance or a word from him,     Or some token, some token from us of our love.       _Refrain_--Groan and weep, O my heart, etc., etc.       V.       \"Grieve, O my heart!  I cannot bear to look on     All the chiefs who are there now assembling:     Alas, Tusitala! Thou art not here!     I look hither and thither in vain for thee.       _Refrain_--Groan and weep, O my heart, etc., etc.\"    And the little booklet closes with Mr Stevenson's own lines:       \"REQUIEM.       Under the wide and starry sky,     Dig the grave and let me lie;     Glad did I live and gladly die,     And I laid me down with a will.     This be the verse you grave for me:     'Here he lies where he longed to be;     Home is the sailor, home from sea;     And the hunter home from the hill.'\"    Every touch tells here was a man, with heart and head, with soul and mind  intent on the loftiest things; simple, great,       \"Like one of the simple great ones gone     For ever and ever by.    His character towered after all far above his books; great and beautiful  though they were.  Ready for friendship; from all meanness free.  So,  too, the Samoans felt.  This, surely, was what Goethe meant when he  wrote:       \"The clear head and stout heart,     However far they roam,     Yet in every truth have part,     Are everywhere at home.\"    His manliness, his width of sympathy, his practicality, his range of  interests were in nothing more seen than in his contributions to the  history of Samoa, as specially exhibited in _A Footnote to History_ and  his letters to the _Times_.  He was, on this side, in no sense a dreamer,  but a man of acute observation and quick eye for passing events and the  characters that were in them with sympathy equal to his discernments.  His  portraits of certain Germans and others in these writings, and his power  of tracing effects to remote and underlying causes, show sufficiently  what he might have done in the field of history, had not higher voices  called him.  His adaptation to the life in Samoa, and his assumption of  the semi-patriarchal character in his own sphere there, were only tokens  of the presence of the same traits as have just been dwelt on.          CHAPTER XI--MISS STUBBS' RECORD OF A PILGRIMAGE      Mrs Strong, in her chapter of _Table Talk in Memories of Vailima_, tells  a story of the natives' love for Stevenson.  \"The other day the cook was  away,\" she writes, \"and Louis, who was busy writing, took his meals in  his room.  Knowing there was no one to cook his lunch, he told Sosimo to  bring him some bread and cheese.  To his surprise he was served with an  excellent meal--an omelette, a good salad, and perfect coffee.  'Who  cooked this?' asked Louis in Samoan.  'I did,' said Sosimo.  'Well,' said  Louis, 'great is your wisdom.'  Sosimo bowed and corrected him--'Great is  my love!'\"    Miss Stubbs, in her _Stevenson's Shrine_; _the Record of a Pilgrimage_,  illustrates the same devotion.  On the top of Mount Vaea, she writes, is  the massive sarcophagus, \"not an ideal structure by any means, not even  beautiful, and yet in its massive ruggedness it somehow suited the man  and the place.\"    \"The wind sighed softly in the branches of the 'Tavau' trees, from out  the green recesses of the 'Toi' came the plaintive coo of the  wood-pigeon.  In and out of the branches of the magnificent 'Fau' tree,  which overhangs the grave, a king-fisher, sea-blue, iridescent, flitted  to and fro, whilst a scarlet hibiscus, in full flower, showed up royally  against"]]]
