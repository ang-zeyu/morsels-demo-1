Here Orson Pratt says  his conversion is due to certain information \"derived independent of  what can be learned naturally by the natural man.\" See also supplement  14, _Millennial Star,_ 49.]    [Footnote 128: _Millennial Star,_ 169, 682.]        \"Just before my husband's return, as Joseph was about commencing      a discourse one Sunday morning, Parley P. Pratt came in very much      fatigued. He had _heard of us_ at some considerable distance, and      had traveled very fast in order to get there by meeting time, as      he wished to hear what we had to say, that he might be prepared to      show us our error. But when Joseph had finished his discourse, Mr.      Pratt arose and expressed his hearty concurrence in every sentiment      advanced. The following day he was baptized and ordained.\" [129]    [Footnote 129: \"Joseph Smith, the Prophet,\" 157, by Lucy Smith.]    This conversion is quite as miraculous and sudden as the one Pratt  tells us about as having occurred at Deacon Hamblin's. The prophet's  mother, Lucy Smith, who wrote this account, and the prophet himself,  under whose supervision it was written, must have been both present,  and in this account related only what they pretended they themselves  saw. In contradiction of this, Pratt, in two different places, tells  us that while at the Whitmers in Seneca County he was baptized and  ordained an elder by Oliver Cowdery, and that then he preached a  Mormon sermon, after which he went to visit his friends in Columbia  County. On his return from Columbia County, over a month after he had  been baptized, he for the first time saw Joseph Smith. [130] These  discrepancies can be best accounted for by the explanation that they  are different accounts of an event that never happened, and told to  conceal one that did happen.    [Footnote 130: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 43 and 46. 45 _Saints'  Herald_, 61. \"Myth of the Manuscript Found,\" 33.]    I understand that the Utah Mormon sect, after publishing \"Mother  Lucy's\" book, condemned it as containing errors, but never pointed out  any. The \"Josephite\" sect of Mormons, however, republished it. It still  remains that in telling what she pretended to have seen, she told the  story as at some time it had been agreed upon. Further, Lucy Smith  could not have written the book, bad as it was from a literary point of  view. The statement that it was written under the direct supervision  of the prophet, I, therefore, consider as literally true. That it  was published in 1853 by Orson Pratt and S. W. Richards, who had  undoubtedly heard the stories corroborated many times and saw nothing  erroneous in the book, is also significant, as is the further fact that  it had been read by Saints four years before any errors were discovered.    RIGDON'S MIRACULOUS CONVERSION.    Pratt having been converted, the next act of importance must, of  course, be the conversion of Rigdon, and, so far as possible, the  congregation whose members he had so carefully prepared for the  reception of Mormonism.    Pratt is still in New York State with Smith, it being October, 1830. He  has already converted his relatives. The Lord, by a revelation through  Joseph Smith, [131] directs Pratt to go with Oliver Cowdery, Peter  Whitmer, and Ziba Peterson \"unto the wilderness among the Lamanites\"  (meaning the American Indians). Pratt, it will be remembered, had  sold part of his clothing for passage money with which to travel in  his quest for the Book of Mormon. He was, therefore, ill prepared  for a winter trip to Ohio and Missouri. \"As soon as the revelation  was received, Emma Smith and several other sisters began to make  arrangements to furnish those who were set apart for the mission  with the necessary clothing, which was no easy task, as the most of  it had to be manufactured out of the raw material.\" Pratt's wife was  taken to the Whitmers, [133] that she might not want while he was away  Converting Indians and Rigdon. Thus situated, Pratt took leave of  his friends \"late in October and started on foot.\" [134] According to  his autobiography it was a hundred miles from Buffalo to Newark, ten  miles from Newark to Macedon, where lived the Wells family, [135] and  twenty-five miles from Palmyra to the Whitmers in Seneca County. [136]  The distance from Buffalo to Cleveland is given as two hundred  miles; [137] from Cleveland to Kirtland as thirty miles. [138] These  distances were no doubt given as they were believed to be according to  the roads as then traveled.    [Footnote 131: Doctrine and Covenants, section 32. Supplement 14,  _Millennial Star,_ 42. The date of this revelation was probably October  17, 1830. Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 212.]    [Footnote 132: \"Joseph Smith, the Prophet,\" by Lucy Smith, 169.]    [Footnote 133: \"Autobiography of P.P.

Pratt,\" 37.]    [Footnote 136: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 42.]    [Footnote 137: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 36.]    [Footnote 138: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 36.]    Adding fifteen miles from the distance from Macedon to Palmyra, we find  the total distance to be traveled, all on foot, going from Whitmer's  home in Seneca County, N.Y., to Kirtland, O., is three hundred and  seventy miles, \"preaching by the way,\" [139] even to Indians. [140] When  we remember the time of year and the almost certainty of inclement  weather and the unimproved condition of the roads in that then wild  west, it could hardly be expected that Pratt, \"traveling on foot\"  and preaching by the way, could reach Kirtland before the middle of  November. Rigdon must have been converted in great haste, because, by  the end of November, he is already a Mormon visitor at Smith's home in  New York, and on December 7 is the recipient of a special revelation  from God. [141] These conclusions accord with the diary of Lyman Wight,  who, being baptized on the same day as Rigdon, entered the fact as  on November 14, 1830. [142] These facts also confirm Howe's statement  that Rigdon was baptized on the second day after Pratt's arrival. [143]  Another authority conversant with the occurrence, and desiring to  be very exact, fixes the time as thirty-six hours after Pratt's  arrival. [144]    [Footnote 139: \"Joseph Smith, the Prophet,\" 169, by Lucy Smith.]    [Footnote 140: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 49. 1 \"History of the  Church,\" 154.]    [Footnote 141: \"Gleanings by the Way,\" 317. Howe's \"Mormonism  Unveiled,\" 107. Doctrine and Covenants, Section 32.]    [Footnote 142: 1 \"History of the Church,\" 154; see also Pratt's  Autobiography, 50.]    [Footnote 143: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 104. \"Gleanings by the  Way,\" 312.]    [Footnote 144: H.H. Clapp in a letter to James T. Cobb.]    The Mormons are not all dull, and their cunning leaders readily saw  that it would be unwise to advertise the suddenness of this conversion,  since it might serve to identify the guilty conspirators. Therefore it  is now represented that Pratt and Rigdon were at first in a state of  great antagonism to Mormonism, which it took weeks to overcome. [145]  This cannot be, unless Pratt could walk three hundred and seventy miles  in less than no time at all.    [Footnote 145: Life of Sidney Rigdon in manuscript by his son, John  Rigdon. 1 \"History of the Church,\" 141. Supplement 14 _Millennial  Star,_ 47-48. 4 _Times and Seasons,_ 290. 45 _Saints' Herald._ 61.]    The facts of this sudden conversion and the subsequent concealment of  its precipitate character all reveal a guilt on the part of those who  are conscious of having done some thing they wish to keep from the  knowledge of others. Had this conversion been honestly miraculous,  there would have been no thought of concealment.    November 14, 1830, the date of Rigdon's baptism, was Sunday, and of  course the first Sunday after the arrival of Pratt. At their first  interview during this visit, Pratt requested and \"readily\" received  permission to preach Mormonism in Rigdon's church. The prophet's  account says: [146]    [Footnote 146: Supplement 14 _Millennial Star_, 47.]        \"At the conclusion [of Pratt's sermon] Elder Rigdon arose and      stated to the congregation that the information that they had      received was of an extraordinary character, and certainly demanded      their most serious consideration, and as the Apostle advised his      brethren to 'prove all things, and hold fast that which is good,'      so he would exhort his brethren to do likewise, and give the      matter a careful investigation, and not turn against it without      being fully convinced of its being an imposition, lest they should      possibly resist the truth. This was indeed generous on the part      of Elder Rigdon, and gave evidence of his entire freedom from any      sectarian bias.\"    But according to Elder Lyman Wight's diary and the other evidence  here adduced, Rigdon was already a convert. Why, then, all this false  suggestion and hypocritical cant about Rigdon's generosity and freedom  from prejudice? There is but one answer, and that is, the authors of it  are thereby attempting to conceal the real facts.    On December 7, 1830, and with due promptness, be it observed, Rigdon,  through Smith, received a revelation making him (Rigdon) scribe to the  prophet, and informing Rigdon how, all unconsciously to himself, he had  been preparing the way for Mormonism. [147] This is speedily followed  by another revelation, [148] in which Rigdon's Ohio home, where he so  carefully prepared the people for the reception of his new faith, is  designated as the gathering place of the faithful, the promised land of  the \"Saints.\"    [Footnote 147: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 107.

FILIPPINO LIPPI    The little curly-haired Filippino, left in the charge of good Fra  Diamante, soon showed that he meant to be a painter like his father.  When, as a little boy, he drew his pictures and showed them proudly to  his mother, he told her that he, too, would learn some day to be a  great artist. And she, half smiling, would pat his curly head and tell  him that he could at least try his best.    Then, after that sad day when Lucrezia heard of Filippo's death, and  the happy little home was broken up, Fra Diamante began in earnest to  train the boy who had been left under his care. He had plenty of money,  for Filippo had been well paid for the work at Spoleto, and so it was  decided that the boy should be placed in some studio where he could be  taught all that was necessary.    There was no fear of Filippino ever wandering about the Florentine  streets cold and hungry as his father had done. And his training was  very different too. Instead of the convent and the kind monks, he was  placed under the care of a great painter, and worked in the master's  studio with other boys as well off as himself.    The name of Filippino's master was Sandro Botticelli, a Florentine  artist, who had been one of Filippo's pupils and had worked with him in  Prato. Fra Diamante knew that he was the greatest artist now in  Florence, and that he would be able to teach the child better than any  one else.    Filippino was a good, industrious boy, and had none of the faults which  had so often led his father into so much mischief and so many strange  adventures. His boyhood passed quietly by and he learned all that his  master could teach him, and then began to paint his own pictures.    Strangely enough, his first work was to paint the walls of the Carmille  Chapel--that same chapel where Filippo and Diamante had learned their  lessons, and had gazed with such awe and reverence on Masaccio's work.    The great painter, Ugly Tom, was dead, and there were still parts of  the chapel unfinished, so Filippino was invited to fill the empty  spaces with his work. No need for the new prior to warn this young  painter against the sin of painting earthly pictures. The frescoes  which daily grew beneath Filippino's hands were saintly and beautiful.  The tall angel in flowing white robes who so gently leads St. Peter out  of the prison door, shines with a pure fair light that speaks of  Heaven. The sleeping soldier looks in contrast all the more dull and  heavy, while St. Peter turns his eyes towards his gentle guide and  folds his hands in reverence, wrapped in the soft reflected light of  that fair face. And on the opposite wall, the sad face of St. Peter  looks out through the prison bars, while a brother saint stands  outside, and with uplifted hand speaks comforting words to the poor  prisoner.    By slow degrees the chapel walls were finished, and after that there  was much work ready for the young painter's hand. It is said that he  was very fond of studying old Roman ornaments and painted them into his  pictures whenever it was possible, and became very famous for this kind  of work. But it is the beauty of his Madonnas and angels that makes us  love his pictures, and we like to think that the memory of his gentle  mother taught him how to paint those lovely faces.    Perhaps of all his pictures the most beautiful is one in the church of  the Badia in Florence. It tells the story of the blessed St. Bernard,  and shows the saint in his desert home, as he sat among the rocks  writing the history of the Madonna. He had not been able to write that  day; perhaps he felt dull, and none of his books, scattered around,  were of any help. Then, as he sat lost in thought, with his pen in his  hand, the Virgin herself stood before him, an angel on either side, and  little angel faces pressed close behind her. Laying a gentle hand upon  his book, she seems to tell St. Bernard all those golden words which  his poor earthly pen had not been able yet to write.    It used to be the custom long ago in Italy to place in the streets  sacred pictures or figures, that passers-by might be reminded of holy  things and say a prayer in passing. And still in many towns you will  find in some old dusty corner a beautiful picture, painted by a master  hand. A gleam of colour will catch your eye, and looking up you see a  picture or little shrine of exquisite blue-and-white glazed pottery,  where the Madonna kneels and worships the Infant Christ lying amongst  the lilies at her feet. The old battered lamp which hangs in front of  these shrines is still kept lighted by some faithful hand, and in  spring-time the children will often come and lay little bunches of  wild-flowers on the ledge below.    'It is for the Jesu Bambino,' they will say, and their little faces  grow solemn and reverent as they kneel and say a prayer. Then off again  they go to their play.    In a little side-street of Prato, not far from the convent where  Filippino's father first saw Lucrezia's lovely face in the sunny  garden, there is one of these wayside shrines. It is painted by  Filippino, and is one of his most beautiful pictures. The sweet face of  the Madonna looks down upon the busy street below, and the Holy Child  lifts His little hand in blessing, amid the saints which stand on  either side.    The glass that covers the picture is thick with dust, and few who pass  ever stop to look up. The world is all too busy nowadays. The hurrying  feet pass by, the unseeing eyes grow more and more careless. But  Filippino's beautiful Madonna looks on with calm, sad eyes, and the  Christ Child, surrounded by the cloud of little angel faces, still  holds in His uplifted hand a blessing for those who seek it.    Like all the great Florentine artists, Filippino, as soon as he grew  famous, was invited to Rome, and he painted many pictures there. On his  way he stopped for a while at Spoleto, and there he designed a  beautiful marble monument for his father's tomb.    Unlike that father, Filippino was never fond of travel or adventure,  and was always glad to return to Florence and live his quiet life  there. Not even an invitation from the King of Hungary could tempt him  to leave home.    It was in the great church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence that  Filippino painted his last frescoes. They are very real and lifelike,  as one of the great painter's pupils once learned to his cost.  Filippino had, of course, many pupils who worked under him. They ground  his colours and watched him work, and would sometimes be allowed to  prepare the less important parts of the picture.    Now it happened that one day when the master had finished his work and  had left the chapel, that one of the pupils lingered behind. His sharp  eye had caught sight of a netted purse which lay in a dark corner,  dropped there by some careless visitor, or perhaps by the master  himself. The boy darted back and caught up the treasure; but at that  moment the master turned back to fetch something he had forgotten. The  boy looked quickly round. Where could he hide his prize? In a moment  his eye fell on a hole in the wall, underneath a step which Filippino  had been painting in the fresco. That was the very place, and he ran  forward to thrust the purse inside. But, alas! the hole was only a  painted one, and the boy was fairly caught, and was obliged with shame  and confusion to give up his prize.    Scarcely were these frescoes finished when Filippino was seized with a  terrible fever, and he died almost as suddenly as his father had done.    In those days when there was a funeral of a prince in Florence, the  Florentines used to shut their shops, and this was considered a great  mark of respect, and was paid only to those of royal blood. But on the  day that Filippino's funeral passed along the Via dei Servi, every shop  there was closed and all Florence mourned for him.    'Some men,' they said, 'are born princes, and some raise themselves by  their talents to be kings among men. Our Filippino was a prince in Art,  and so do we do honour to his title.'        PIETRO PERUGINO    It was early morning, and the rays of the rising sun had scarcely yet  caught the roofs of the city of Perugia, when along the winding road  which led across the plain a man and a boy walked with steady,  purposelike steps towards the town which crowned the hill in front.    The man was poorly dressed in the common rough clothes of an Umbrian  peasant. Hard work and poverty had bent his shoulders and drawn stern  lines upon his face, but there was a dignity about him which marked him  as something above the common working man.    The little boy who trotted barefoot along by the side of his father had  a sweet, serious little face, but he looked tired and hungry, and  scarcely fit for such a long rough walk. They had started from their  home at Castello delle Pieve very early that morning, and the piece of  black bread which had served them for breakfast had been but small.  Away in front stretched that long, white, never-ending road; and the  little dusty feet that pattered so bravely along had to take hurried  runs now and again to keep up with the long strides of the man, while  the wistful eyes, which were fixed on that distant town, seemed to  wonder if they would really ever reach their journey's end.    'Art tired already, Pietro?' asked the father at length, hearing a  panting little sigh at his side. 'Why, we are not yet half-way there!  Thou must step bravely out and be a man, for to-day thou shalt begin to  work for thy living, and no longer live the life of an idle child.'    The boy squared his shoulders, and his eyes shone.    'It is not I who am tired, my father,' he said. 'It is only that my  legs cannot take such good long steps as thine; and walk as we will the  road ever seems"]]]
