Kalamoun was hopeless; yet twenty-four hours earlier Fielding had  fancied there was a little light in the darkness. That night Fielding's  music gave him but two hours' sleep, and he had to begin the day on  a brandy-and-soda. Wherever he went open resistance blocked his way,  hisses and mutterings followed him, the sick were hid in all sorts of  places, and two of his assistants deserted before noon. Things looked  ominous enough, and at five o'clock he made up his mind that Egypt would  be overrun with cholera, and that he should probably have to defend  himself and the Amenhotep from rioters, for the native police would be  useless.    But at five o'clock Dicky Donovan came in a boat, and with him Mustapha  Kali under a native guard of four men. The Mudir's sense of humour had  been touched, and this sense of humour probably saved the Mudir from  trouble, for it played Dicky's game for him.    Mustapha Kali had been sentenced to serve in the Cholera Hospital of  Kalamoun, that he might be cured of his unbelief. At first he had taken  his fate hardly, but Dicky had taunted him and then had suggested that  a man whose conscience was clear and convictions good would carry a high  head in trouble. Dicky challenged him to prove his libels by probing the  business to the bottom, like a true scientist. All the way from Abdallah  Dicky talked to him so, and at last the only answer Mustapha Kali would  make was, \"Malaish no matter!\"    Mustapha Kali pricked up his ears with hope as he saw the sullen crowds  from Kalamoun gathering on the shore to watch his deportation to the  Cholera Hospital; and, as he stepped from the khiassa, he called out  loudly:    \"They are all dogs and sons of dogs, and dogs were their grandsires. No  good is in a dog the offspring of a dog. Whenever these dogs scratch the  ground the dust of poison is in the air, and we die.\"    \"You are impolite, Mustapha Kali,\" said Dicky coolly, and offered him a  cigarette.    The next three days were the darkest in Dicky Donovan's career. On the  first day there came word that Norman, overwrought, had shot himself. On  the next, Mustapha Kali in a fit of anger threw a native policeman into  the river, and when his head appeared struck it with a barge-pole, and  the man sank to rise no more. The three remaining policemen, two of whom  were Soudanese, and true to Dicky, bound him and shut him up in a hut.  When that evening Fielding refused to play, Dicky knew that Norman's  fate had taken hold of him, and that he must watch his friend every  minute--that awful vigilance which kills the watcher in the end. Dicky  said to himself more than once that day:           \"Christ save us all from a death like this,          On the reef of Norman's woe!\"    But it was not Dicky who saved Fielding. On the third day the  long-deferred riot broke out. The Copt and the Arab had spread the  report that Fielding brought death to the villages by moving the little  flags on his map. The populace rose.    Fielding was busy with the map at the dreaded moment that hundreds of  the villagers appeared upon the bank and rushed the Amenhotep. Fielding  and Dicky were both armed, but Fielding would not fire until he saw that  his own crew had joined the rioters on the bank. Then, amid a shower of  missiles, he shot the Arab who had first spread the report about the map  and the flags.    Now Dicky and he were joined by Holgate, the Yorkshire engineer of the  Amenhotep, and together the three tried to hold the boat. Every native  had left them. They were obliged to retreat aft to the deckcabin.  Placing their backs against it, they prepared to die hard. No one could  reach them from behind, at least.    It was an unequal fight. All three had received slight wounds, but the  blood-letting did them all good. Fielding was once more himself; nervous  anxiety, unrest, had gone from him. He was as cool as a cucumber. He  would not go shipwreck now \"on the reef of Norman's woe.\" Here was a  better sort of death. No men ever faced it with quieter minds than did  the three. Every instant brought it nearer.    All at once there was a cry and a stampede in the rear of the attacking  natives. The crowd suddenly parted like two waves, and retreated; and  Mustapha Kali, almost naked, and supported by a stolid Soudanese, stood  before the three. He was pallid, his hands and brow were dripping sweat,  and there was a look of death in his eyes.    \"I have cholera, effendi!\" he cried. \"Take me to Abdallah to die, that I  may be buried with my people and from mine own house.\"    \"Is it not poison?\" asked Fielding grimly, yet seeing now a ray of hope  in the sickening business.    \"It is cholera, effendi. Take me home to die.\"    \"Very well. Tell the people so, and I will take you home, and I will  bury you with your fathers,\" said Fielding.    Mustapha Kali turned slowly. \"I am sick of cholera,\" he said as  loudly as he could to the awe-stricken crowd. \"May God not cool my  resting-place if it be not so!\"    \"Tell the people to go to their homes and obey us,\" said Dicky, putting  away his pistol.    \"These be good men, I have seen with mine own eyes,\" said Mustapha  hoarsely to the crowd. \"It is for your good they do all. Have I not  seen? Let God fill both my hands with dust if it be not so! God hath  stricken me, and behold I give myself into the hands of the Inglesi, for  I believe!\"    He would have fallen to the ground, but Dicky and the Soudanese caught  him and carried him down to the bank, while the crowd scuttled from the  boat, and Fielding made ready to bear the dying man to Abdallah--a race  against death.    Fielding brought Mustapha Kali to Abdallah in time to die there, and  buried him with his fathers; and Dicky stayed behind to cleanse Kalamoun  with perchloride and limewash.    The story went abroad and travelled fast, and the words of Mustapha  Kali, oft repeated, became as the speech of a holy man; and the people  no longer hid their dead, but brought them to the Amenhotep.    This was the beginning of better things; the disease was stayed.    And for all the things that these men did--Fielding Bey and Donovan  Pasha--they got naught but an Egyptian ribbon to wear on the breast and  a laboured censure from the Administration for overrunning the budget  allowance.    Dicky, however, seemed satisfied, for Fielding's little barque of life  had not gone down \"On the reef of Norman's woe.\" Mrs. Henshaw felt so  also when she was told all, and she disconcerted Dicky by bursting into  tears.    \"Why those tears?\" said Dicky to Fielding afterwards; \"I wasn't  eloquent.\"          FIELDING HAD AN ORDERLY    His legs were like pipe-stems, his body was like a board, but he was  straight enough, not unsoldierly, nor so bad to look at when his back  was on you; but when he showed his face you had little pleasure in him.  It seemed made of brown putty, the nose was like india-rubber, and the  eyes had that dull, sullen look of a mongrel got of a fox-terrier and a  bull-dog. Like this sort of mongrel also his eyes turned a brownish-red  when he was excited.    You could always tell when something had gone wrong with Ibrahim the  Orderly, by that curious dull glare in his eyes. Selamlik Pasha said  to Fielding that it was hashish; Fielding said it was a cross breed of  Soudanese and fellah. But little Dicky Donovan said it was something  else, and he kept his eye upon Ibrahim. And Dicky, with all his faults,  could screw his way from the front of a thing to the back thereof like  no other civilised man you ever knew. But he did not press his opinions  upon Fielding, who was an able administrator and a very clever fellow  also, with a genial habit of believing in people who served him: and  that is bad in the Orient.    As an orderly Ibrahim was like a clock: stiff in his gait as a pendulum,  regular as a minute. He had no tongue for gossip either, so far as  Fielding knew. Also, five times a day he said his prayers--an unusual  thing for a Gippy soldier-servant; for as the Gippy's rank increases he  soils his knees and puts his forehead in the dust with discretion. This  was another reason why Dicky suspected him.    It was supposed that Ibrahim could not speak a word of English; and  he seemed so stupid, he looked so blank, when English was spoken, that  Fielding had no doubt the English language was a Tablet of Abydos to  him. But Dicky was more wary, and waited. He could be very patient and  simple, and his delicate face seemed as innocent as a girl's when he  said to Ibrahim one morning: \"Ibrahim, brother of scorpions, I'm going  to teach you English!\" and, squatting like a Turk on the deck of the  Amenhotep, the stern-wheeled tub which Fielding called a steamer, he  began to teach Ibrahim.    \"Say 'Good-morning, kind sir,'\" he drawled.    No tongue was ever so thick, no throat so guttural, as Ibrahim's when he  obeyed this command. That was why suspicion grew the more in the mind  of Dicky. But he made the Gippy say: \"Good-morning, kind sir,\" over and  over again. Now, it was a peculiar thing that Ibrahim's pronunciation  grew worse every time; which goes to show that a combination of  Soudanese and fellah doesn't make a really clever villain. Twice, three  times, Dicky gave him other words and phrases to say, and practice made  Ibrahim more perfect in error.    Dicky suddenly enlarged the vocabulary thus: \"An old man had three  sons: one was a thief, another a rogue, and the worst of them all was a  soldier. But the soldier died first!\"    As he said these words he kept his eyes fixed on Ibrahim in a  smiling, juvenile sort of way; and he saw the colour--the brownish-red  colour--creep slowly into Ibrahim's eyes. For Ibrahim's father had three  sons: and certainly one was a thief, for he had been a tax-gatherer; and  one was a rogue, for he had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6267"],[0,"The Weavers: a tale of England and Egypt of fifty years ago - Complete (#12)"],[1,"says, and buries his face in his yelek.\"    \"Life is beautiful and so difficult--to save,\" observed Nahoum, in  a tone meant to tempt David on one hand and to reach the ears of the  notorious Achmet Pasha, whose extortions, cruelties, and taxations had  built his master's palaces, bribed his harem, given him money to pay  the interest on his European loans, and made himself the richest man in  Egypt, whose spies were everywhere, whose shadow was across every man's  path. Kaid might slay, might toss a pasha or a slave into the Nile now  and then, might invite a Bey to visit him, and stroke his beard and call  him brother and put diamond-dust in the coffee he drank, so that he  died before two suns came and went again, \"of inflammation and a natural  death\"; but he, Achmet Pasha, was the dark Inquisitor who tortured every  day, for whose death all men prayed, and whom some would have slain, but  that another worse than himself might succeed him.    At Nahoum's words the dusky brown of Achmet's face turned as black as  the sudden dilation of the pupil of an eye deepens its hue, and he said  with a guttural accent:    \"Every man hath a time to die.\"    \"But not his own time,\" answered Nahoum maliciously.    \"It would appear that in Egypt he hath not always the choice of the  fashion or the time,\" remarked David calmly. He had read the malice  behind their words, and there had flashed into his own mind tales told  him, with every circumstance of accuracy, of deaths within and without  the Palace. Also he was now aware that Nahoum had mocked him. He was  concerned to make it clear that he was not wholly beguiled.    \"Is there, then, for a man choice of fashion or time in England,  effendi?\" asked Nahoum, with assumed innocence.    \"In England it is a matter between the Giver and Taker of life and  himself--save where murder does its work,\" said David.    \"And here it is between man and man--is it that you would say?\" asked  Nahoum.    \"There seem wider privileges here,\" answered David drily.    \"Accidents will happen, privileges or no,\" rejoined Nahoum, with  lowering eyelids.    The Prince intervened. \"Thy own faith forbids the sword, forbids war,  or--punishment.\"    \"The Prophet I follow was called the Prince of Peace, friend,\" answered  David, bowing gravely across the table.    \"Hast thou never killed a man?\" asked Kaid, with interest in his eyes.  He asked the question as a man might ask another if he had never visited  Paris.    \"Never, by the goodness of God, never,\" answered David.    \"Neither in punishment nor in battle?\"    \"I am neither judge nor soldier, friend.\"    \"Inshallah, thou hast yet far to go! Thou art young yet. Who can tell?\"    \"I have never so far to go as that, friend,\" said David, in a voice that  rang a little.    \"To-morrow is no man's gift.\"    David was about to answer, but chancing to raise his eyes above the  Prince Pasha's head, his glance was arrested and startled by seeing a  face--the face of a woman-looking out of a panel in a mooshrabieh screen  in a gallery above. He would not have dwelt upon the incident, he would  have set it down to the curiosity of a woman of the harem, but that  the face looking out was that of an English girl, and peering over her  shoulder was the dark, handsome face of an Egyptian or a Turk.    Self-control was the habit of his life, the training of his faith,  and, as a rule, his face gave little evidence of inner excitement.  Demonstration was discouraged, if not forbidden, among the Quakers, and  if, to others, it gave a cold and austere manner, in David it tempered  to a warm stillness the powerful impulses in him, the rivers of feeling  which sometimes roared through his veins.    Only Nahoum Pasha had noticed his arrested look, so motionless did he  sit; and now, without replying, he bowed gravely and deferentially to  Kaid, who rose from the table. He followed with the rest. Presently the  Prince sent Higli Pasha to ask his nearer presence.    The Prince made a motion of his hand, and the circle withdrew. He waved  David to a seat.    \"To-morrow thy business shall be settled,\" said the Prince suavely, \"and  on such terms as will not startle. Death-tribute is no new thing in the  East. It is fortunate for thee that the tribute is from thy hand to my  hand, and not through many others to mine.\"    \"I am conscious I have been treated with favour, friend,\" said David.  \"I would that I might show thee kindness. Though how may a man of no  account make return to a great Prince?\"    \"By the beard of my father, it is easily done, if thy kindness is a  real thing, and not that which makes me poorer the more I have of it--as  though one should be given a herd of horses which must not be sold but  still must be fed.\"    \"I have given thee truth. Is not truth cheaper than falsehood?\"    \"It is the most expensive thing in Egypt; so that I despair of buying  thee. Yet I would buy thee to remain here--here at my court; here by my  hand which will give thee the labour thou lovest, and will defend thee  if defence be needed. Thou hast not greed, thou hast no thirst for  honour, yet thou hast wisdom beyond thy years. Kaid has never besought  men, but he beseeches thee. Once there was in Egypt, Joseph, a wise  youth, who served a Pharaoh, and was his chief counsellor, and it was  well with the land. Thy name is a good name; well-being may follow thee.  The ages have gone, and the rest of the world has changed, but Egypt is  the same Egypt, the Nile rises and falls, and the old lean years and fat  years come and go. Though I am in truth a Turk, and those who serve  and rob me here are Turks, yet the fellah is the same as he was five  thousand years ago. What Joseph the Israelite did, thou canst do; for  I am no more unjust than was that Rameses whom Joseph served. Wilt thou  stay with me?\"    David looked at Kaid as though he would read in his face the reply that  he must make, but he did not see Kaid; he saw, rather, the face of  one he had loved more than Jonathan had been loved by the young  shepherd-prince of Israel. In his ears he heard the voice that had  called him in his sleep-the voice of Benn Claridge; and, at the same  instant, there flashed into his mind a picture of himself fighting  outside the tavern beyond Hamley and bidding farewell to the girl at the  crossroads.    \"Friend, I cannot answer thee now,\" he said, in a troubled voice.    Kaid rose. \"I will give thee an hour to think upon it. Come with me.\" He  stepped forward. \"To-morrow I will answer thee, Kaid.\"    \"To-morrow there is work for thee to do. Come.\" David followed him.    The eyes that followed the Prince and the Quaker were not friendly.  What Kaid had long foreshadowed seemed at hand: the coming of a European  counsellor and confidant. They realised that in the man who had just  left the room with Kaid there were characteristics unlike those they had  ever met before in Europeans.    \"A madman,\" whispered High Pasha to Achmet the Ropemaker.    \"Then his will be the fate of the swine of Gadarene,\" said Nahoum Pasha,  who had heard.    \"At least one need not argue with a madman.\" The face of Achmet the  Ropemaker was not more pleasant than his dark words.    \"It is not the madman with whom you have to deal, but his keeper,\"  rejoined Nahoum.    Nahoum's face was heavier than usual. Going to weight, he was still  muscular and well groomed. His light brown beard and hair and blue eyes  gave him a look almost Saxon, and bland power spoke in his face and in  every gesture.    He was seldom without the string of beads so many Orientals love  to carry, and, Armenian Christian as he was, the act seemed almost  religious. It was to him, however, like a ground-wire in telegraphy--it  carried off the nervous force tingling in him and driving him to  impulsive action, while his reputation called for a constant outward  urbanity, a philosophical apathy. He had had his great fight for place  and power, alien as he was in religion, though he had lived in Egypt  since a child. Bar to progress as his religion had been at first, it had  been an advantage afterwards; for, through it, he could exclude himself  from complications with the Wakfs, the religious court of the Muslim  creed, which had lands to administer, and controlled the laws of  marriage and inheritance. He could shrug his shoulders and play with his  beads, and urbanely explain his own helplessness and ineligibility when  his influence was summoned, or it was sought to entangle him in warring  interests. Oriental through and through, the basis of his creed was  similar to that of a Muslim: Mahomet was a prophet and Christ was a  prophet. It was a case of rival prophets--all else was obscured into a  legend, and he saw the strife of race in the difference of creed. For  the rest, he flourished the salutations and language of the Arab as  though they were his own, and he spoke Arabic as perfectly as he did  French and English.    He was the second son of his father. The first son, who was but a year  older, and was as dark as he was fair, had inherited--had seized--all  his father's wealth. He had lived abroad for some years in France and  England. In the latter place he had been one of the Turkish Embassy,  and, having none of the outward characteristics of the Turk, and being  in appearance more of a Spaniard than an Oriental, he had, by his gifts,  his address and personal appearance, won the good-will of the Duchess of  Middlesex, and had had that success all too flattering to the soul of a  libertine. It had, however, been the means of his premature retirement  from England, for his chief at the Embassy had a preference for an  Oriental entourage. He was called Foorgat Bey.    Sitting at table, Nahoum alone of all present had caught David's  arrested look, and, glancing up, had seen the girl's face at the panel  of mooshrabieh, and had seen also over her shoulder the face of his  brother, Foorgat Bey. He had been even more astonished "]]]
