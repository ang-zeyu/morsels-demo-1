He found him  in the great hall of the castello, awaiting the trial of certain causes,  which, as coming immediately under the ducal jurisdiction, it was  Galeazzo's sport often to preside over in person.  Here he saw the boy,  standing at his brother's shoulder by the judgment-seat--the comeliest  figure, between Cupid and angel, he had ever beheld; frank, sweet,  child-eyed--in every feature and quality, it would seem, the antithesis  of himself.  Messer Ludovico came up arm in arm, very condescendingly,  with his excellency the Ser Simonetta, Secretary of State, a gentleman  whom he was always at pains to flatter, since he intended by and by to  destroy him.  Not that he had any personal spite against this minister,  however much he might suspect him of misrepresenting his motives and  character to the Duchess Bona, his sister-in-law, to whom he, Ludovico,  was in reality, he assured himself, quite attached.  His policy, on the  contrary, was always a passionless one; and the point here was simply  that the man, in his humble opinion, affected too much reason and  temperance for a despotic government.    As he approached the tribune he uncapped, a thought on the near side of  self-abasement, to his brother, whose cavalier acknowledgment of the  salute halted him, however, affable and smiling, on the lowest step of  the dais. He was studious, while there, to inform with the right touch  of pleasant condescension (at least while Galeazzo's regard was fixed on  him) his attitude towards Simonetta, lest the ever-suspicious mind of  the tyrant should discover in it some sign of a corruptive intimacy.  With heirs-possibly-presumptive in Milan, sufficient for the day's life  must be the sleepless diplomacy thereof; and better than any man  Ludovico knew on what small juggleries of the moment the continuance of  his depended.  His complexion being of a swarthiness to have earned him  the surname of The Moor, he had acquired a habit of drooping his lids in  company, lest the contrastive effect of white eyeballs moving in a dark,  motionless face should betray him to the subjects of those covert  side-long glances by which he was wont to observe unobserved. Even to  his shoulders, which were slightly rounded by nature, he managed, when  in his brother's presence, to give the suggestion of a self-deprecatory  hump, as though the slight burden of State which they already endured  were too much for them.  His voice was low-toned; his expression  generally of a soft and rather apologetic benignity.  His manner towards  all was calculated on a graduated scale of propitiation.  Paying every  disputant the compliment of deferring outwardly to his opinions, he  would not whip so little as a swineherd without apologising for the  inconvenience to which he was putting him.  His dress was rich, but  while always conceived on the subdominant note, so to speak, as implying  the higher ducal standard, was in excellent taste, a quality which he  could afford to indulge with impunity, since it excited no suspicion but  of his simplicity in Galeazzo's crude mind. In point of fact Messer  Ludovico was a born connoisseur, and, equally in his choice of men,  methods, and tools, a first exemplar of the faculty of selection.    Presently, seeing the Duke's gaze withdrawn from him, he spoke to Messer  Simonetta more intimately, but still out of the twisted corner of his  mouth, while his eyes remained slewed under their lids towards the  throne:--    'Indeed, my lord, indeed yes; 'tis a veritable Castalidis, fresh from  Parnassus and the spring.  Tell me, now--'tis no uncommon choice of my  brother to favour a fair boy--what differentiates this case from many?'    The secretary, long caged in office, and worn and toothless from  friction on its bars, had yet his ideals of Government, personal as well  as political.    'Your Highness,' said he, in his hoarse, thin voice, 'what  differentiates sacramental wine from Malvasia?'    'Why,' answered Ludovico, 'perhaps a degree or two of headiness.'    'Nay,' said the secretary, 'is it not rather a degree or two of  holiness?'    'Ebbene!' said the other, 'I stand excellently corrected.  (Your  servant, Messer Tassino,' he said, in parenthesis, to a pert and  confident young exquisite, who held himself arrogantly forward of the  group of spectators.  The jay responded to the attention with a  condescending nod.  Ludovico readdressed himself to the secretary.)  'How neatly you put things!  It is a degree or two, as you say--between  the intoxication of the spirit and the intoxication of the senses.  And  is this pretty stranger sacramental wine, and hath Heaven vouchsafed us  the Grael without the Quest?  It is a sign of its high favour, Messer  Slmonetta, of which I hope and trust we shall prove ourselves worthy.'    'And I hope so, Highness,' said the grave secretary.    'Hush!' whispered Ludovico.  'The court opens.'    There was a little stir and buzz among the spectators who, thronging the  hall, left a semi-circle of clear space about the dais; and into this,  at the moment, a fellow in a ragged gabardine was haled by a guard of  city officers. The Duke, seated above, stroked his chin with a glance at  the prisoner of sinister relish, which, on the thought, he smoothed,  with a little apologetic cough, into an expression of mild benignancy.  Messer Lanti, planted near at hand amid a very parterre of nobles,  envoys, ecclesiastics, bedizened _cheres amies_ and great officers of  the court who supported their lord on the dais, sniggered under his  breath till his huge shoulders shook.    The Jew was charged with a very heinous offence--sweating coins, no  less.  He was voluble and nasal over his innocence, until one of the  officers flicked him bloodily on the mouth with his mailed hand.    'Nay,' said Bembo, shrinking; 'that is to give the poor man a dumb  advocate, methinks.'    The Duke applauded--eliciting some louder applause from Ludovico--and  forbade the fellow sternly to strike again without orders.  A sudden  sigh and movement seemed to ripple the congregated faces and to subside.  The prisoner, however, was convicted, on sound enough evidence, and  stood sullen and desperate to hear his sentence.  Galeazzo eyed him  covetously a moment; then turning to a clerk of the court who knelt  beside him with his tablets ready, bade that obsequious functionary  proclaim the penalty which by statute obtained against all coiners or  defacers of the ducal image.  It was bad enough--breaking on the  wheel--to pass without deadlier revision; yet to such, and to the high  will or caprice of his lord, Master Scrivener humbly submitted it.    Then, to the dumfoundering of all, did his Magnificence appeal, with a  smile, to the little Parablist at his shoulder:--    'Mi' amico; thou hearest?  What say'st?'    'Lord,' answered Bernardo, in the soft, clear young voice that all might  hear like a bird's song in the stillness after rain, 'this wretch hath  defaced thy graven image.'    'It is true.'    'What if, in a more impious mood, he had dared to raise his hand against  thyself?'    'Ha!  He would be made to die--not pleasantly.'    'Is to be broken on the wheel pleasant?'    'Well, the dog shall hang.'    'Still for so little?  Why, were he Cain he could pay no higher.  Valuest thy life, then, at a pinch of gold dust?  This is to put a  premium on regicide.'    The Duke bit his lip, and frowned, and laughed vexedly.    'How now, Bernardino?'    'Lord, I am young--a child, and without comparative experience.  I pray  thee put this rogue aside, while we consider.'    Galeazzo waved his hand, and the Jew, staring and stumbling, was  removed.  Another, a creature gaunt and wolfish, took his place.  What  had he done?  He had trodden on a hare in her form, and, half-killing,  had despatched her.  Why? asked Bembo.  To still her telltale cries,  intimated the wretched creature.  Galeazzo's eyes gleamed; but still he  called upon Heaven to sentence.  In such a case?  Men glanced at one  another half terrified.  Any portent, even of good, is fearful in its  rising.  Bembo turned to the kneeling clerk.    'Come, Master Scrivener!  A little offence, in any case, and with  humanity to condone it.'    The frightened servant shook his head, with a glance at his master.  He  murmured the worst he dared--that the law exacted the extremest penalty  from the unauthorised killer of game.  Bembo stared a moment  incredulous, then pounced in mock fury at the prisoner:--    'Wretch! what didst thou with this hare?'    The hind had to be goaded to an answer.    'Master, I ate it.'    'What!' cried the other--'a monster, to devour thy prince's flesh!'    'God knows I did not!'    'Nay, God is nothing to the law, which says you did. Else why should it  draw no distinction between the crimes of harecide and regicide?  Thou  hast eaten of thy prince.'    'Well, if I have I have.'    'Thou art anthropophagous.'    'Mercy!'    'No shame to thee--a lover of thy kind' (the Saint chuckled).  'And no  cannibal neither, since we have made game of thy prince.'  He chuckled  again, and turned merrily on the Duke.  'Is the hare to be prince, or  the prince hare?  And yet, in either case, O Galeazzo, I see no way for  thee out of this thy loving subject's belly!'    The tyrant, half captivated, half furious, started forward.    'Give him,' he roared--and stopped.  'Give him,' he repeated, 'a kick on  his breach and send him flying. Nay!' he snarled, 'even that were too  much honour. Give him a scudo with which to buy an emetic.'    Bembo smiled and sighed: 'I begin to see daylight'; and Ludovico, after  laughing enjoyingly over his brother's pleasantry, exclaimed audibly to  Simonetta: 'This is the very wedding of human wit and divine.  I seem to  see the air full of laughing cherubs having my brother's features.'    Now there brake into the arena one clad like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44235"],[0,"Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino, Volume 2 (of 3) (#12)"],[1,"much apparent  inconsistency in the Pontiff's treatment of him, which, if our  authorities are to be trusted, showed nothing of that choleric  temperament and energetic firmness which habitually characterised  him. Within two days of his election, when speaking of Valentino  to the Venetian envoy, he said, \"We shall let him get off with all  he has robbed from the Church in his evil hour, but would that  the towns of Romagna were taken from him.\" Yet a change appears  to have supervened, induced perhaps by Cesare's representations,  which had formerly been successful with Pius III., that, under his  sway, the influence of the Church in that province of her patrimony  would be far better maintained than by handing it again to the old  dynasties, whom he had with difficulty eradicated, and who had ever  been turbulent vassals of the Apostolic Chamber. The now manifest  intention of the Venetians to obtain a footing in that quarter, upon  various pretexts founded on claims of the Manfredi and others of the  dispossessed lords, gave cogency to this reasoning in the eyes of  Julius, whose paramount policy of at all hazards aggrandising the  keys, rendered Valentino's sovereignty preferable to such extension  of their dominion, and may have somewhat extenuated the Borgian  policy in his eyes. He therefore brought the usurper from St. Angelo  to lodge in the Vatican, and entered with seeming cordiality into  his views. But the lapse of a few days found his Holiness in another  mood, declaring that his guest should not hold a single battlement  throughout Italy, but might be thankful if spared his life and the  treasures he had plundered, most of which were however already  dissipated. From that moment the prestige of his position was at an  end, and he remained at the palace \"in small repute.\"    The crisis soon became urgent, for the Venetian troops were pouring  upon Romagna, whilst the few fortresses that still owned Borgia as  their master were gradually falling to the confederate chiefs, led  by Guidobaldo. On the 9th of November, letters, demanding these  captured castles in the name of the Signory, found the latter ill  of gout; but in reply he expressed surprise at the summons, seeing  that he had wrested them from the usurper, and hoped to hold them  for the pope elect, and in security for the valuables of which he  had been pillaged. In consideration, perhaps, of his being then  actually in pay of the Republic, he agreed to deliver up Verucchio  and Cesenatico, whereupon the messenger reported him to the Doge as  \"a good Christian, but in want of some one to counsel him.\"    In this exigency, Cesare proposed to surrender to the Pope the  citadels of Cesena, Bertinoro, Forli, and Forlimpopoli, as a means  of immediately arresting the progress of their assailants, and of  cutting short the schemes of Venice, offering to serve the Church  during the rest of his life in any capacity that was thought  expedient. This offer Julius declined, but gave him liberty to  repair to the scene of action, and act for the best with what  troops he could raise. He accordingly went to Ostia on the 19th  of November, meaning to take shipping for Upper Italy; but on the  21st the Pontiff, alarmed at the progress of the Venetians, and  influenced by Guidobaldo, who, arriving on that day, had demanded  justice upon Borgia, thought better of it, and sent to get from  him the countersigns of his citadels. These Valentino refusing,  he was brought back to Rome under arrest on the 29th, and, after  much temporising, ultimately gave the necessary passwords for the  surrender of his last hold upon his recent dominions.    Such seem the admitted facts of the Pope's treatment of Borgia.  His change of conduct may have been dictated by new circumstances  coming to his knowledge, or it may have been part of a systematic  deception, in order to turn Valentino's influence to his own  purposes. The opinions of Giovio and De Thou show that such treachery  as Guicciardini charges upon Julius, and as Cesare met soon after  from Gonsalvo di Cordova, was regarded by the lax public and private  morality of the age as justified by his own infamous perfidies. On  the other hand, it is admitted that the Cardinal della Rovere's high  reputation for good faith was one of his recommendations to the  conclave. Bossi, in an additional note to vol. IV. of his translation  of _Leo X._, considers this dark passage of history to be cleared up  by the narrative of Baldi, regarding Guidobaldo's generous treatment  of the enemy of his house, to which he attributes the moderation of  his Holiness; but this view does not seem borne out either by dates  or by Baldi's words.[*16]    [Footnote *16: Cf. the latter, in which an account of the interview  between Cesare and Guidobaldo is given, UGOLINI, _op. cit._, vol. II.,  p. 523. It does not bear out Giustiniani's account (q.v. ii., 326) of  what Guidobaldo said to him, and is probably mere rhetoric.]    Thus terminated Duke Valentino's connection with the immediate  subject of this narrative. A few words will suffice to trace the  remainder of his fluctuating fortunes. Having been again transmitted  to Ostia, he remained there a sort of prisoner at large until  April, 1504, when his escape to Naples was connived at. There he  was received with distinction by Gonsalvo di Cordova, viceroy of  Ferdinand II.; but soon after, an order arrived from that king to  send him prisoner to Spain. With this command, suggested probably by  a brief from Julius, which Raynaldus has printed, the Great Captain  at once complied, although Borgia held his safe-conduct,--a breach of  faith which the Spanish historians justify by the alleged detection  of schemes and intrigues, originated by Cesare and perilous to the  ascendancy of his Catholic Majesty. Yet we learn that the Viceroy's  last hour seemed troubled by repentance for this stain upon his  conscience, which even in his day of pride one chivalrous spirit had  dared thus to question. Baldassare Scipio of Siena, a free captain  long in Cesare's service, publicly placarded a challenge to any  Spaniard who should venture to maintain \"that the Duke Valentino had  not been arrested at Naples, in direct violation of a safe-conduct  granted in the names of Ferdinand and Isabella, to the great infamy  and infinite faithlessness of all their crowns.\" On reaching the land  of his fathers, this incarnate spirit of a blood-stained age was  confined in the castle of Medina del Campo, and the interest used for  his release by the Spanish cardinals, and by his brothers-in-law the  King of Navarre and the Duke of Ferrara, who offered their guarantee  for his good behaviour, was, during three years, unavailing on the  ground of his dangerous character. At length he made his escape by  a rope-ladder or cord, under circumstances so fool-hardy as to be  ascribed by the country people to supernatural aid, and reached the  King of Navarre, who gave him the command of an expedition against  the Count de Lerin. On the 10th of March, 1507, he fell into an  ambuscade near Viane, and was cut to pieces fighting desperately. By  a singular coincidence, his stripped and plundered body, having been  recognised by a servant, was interred in the church of Pampeluna, the  archbishopric of which had been his earliest promotion. Short as was  his life (for he seems to have died under thirty) he had survived all  his dignities and distinctions, realising the distich of Sannazaro,         \"CAESAR, he aimed at all, he vanquished all;         In all he fails, a CYPHER in his fall.\"[17]    [Footnote 17:         \"Omnia vincebas, sperabas omnia Caesar;         Omnia deficiunt, incipis esse nihil.\"]    Valentino's was a character peculiar to Spain, with which Pizarro  alone seems to have matched. His boundless ambition was profoundly  selfish and utterly unscrupulous; his energy of purpose owned no  impulse but egotism; his capacity was marred by meanness; his  splendid tastes served but as incentives to spoliation. The demands  of honour, the compunctions of conscience, the value of human  life availed nothing in his eyes. In him foresight became fraud,  calculation cunning, prudence perfidy, courage cruelty. His daring,  his constancy, his talent were devoted to murder, rapine, and  treachery. His campaigns were massacres, his justice vengeance, his  diplomacy a trick. Generosity was a stranger to his impulses, remorse  to his crimes.           *       *       *       *       *    Fortune, so long adverse to Guidobaldo, at length smiled upon him.  The election to the tiara of his relative and confidential friend,  Cardinal della Rovere, freed him from anxiety as to the restoration  of his duchy, and promised him a long career of prosperity and  honour. His policy of supporting the Venetians in their views upon  Romagna thus not only became superfluous as a check upon Borgia,  but seemed not unlikely to place him in a dilemma with the Camera.  The new Pontiff, therefore, lost no time in removing him from a  position of such delicacy, by summoning him to Rome. The invitation  found him encamped before Verucchio, whence he immediately set out;  and, after devoting two days at Urbino to public thanksgivings and  festivities for his own restoration and for the election of Julius,  he performed the journey in a litter, his gout preventing him from  riding. On the eleventh day, being the 20th of November, he was met  at the Ponte Molle by a superbly caparisoned mule, and on it was  painfully but honourably escorted by an imposing cortege to his  apartment in the Vatican, under a salute from the artillery of St.  Angelo. Notwithstanding his fatigue, he was bidden by the impatient  Pontiff to supper that evening, and was received by his Holiness on  the landing-place with equal favour and distinction.    In the explanations which followed, their mutual views were frankly  stated. The claim which the Venetians had upon"]]]
