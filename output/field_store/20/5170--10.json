[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5817"],[0,"The Clockmaker â€” or, the Sayings and Doings of Samuel Slick, of Slickville (#12)"],[1,"said the old minister,  quite shocked, when you said you growed up, dear, for  you have grown up in great ignorance. Then I guess you  had better get a lady that knows more than me, says she,  that's flat. I reckon I am every bit and grain as good  as you be--If I don't understand a bum-byx (silk worm)  both feedin, breedin, and rearin, then I want to know  who does, that's all; church platform indeed, says she,  I guess you were raised under a glass frame in March,  and transplanted on Independence day, warnt you? And off  she sot, lookin as scorney as a London lady, and leavin  the poor minister standin starin like a stuck pig. Well,  well, says he, a liftin up both hands, and turnin up the  whites of his eyes like a duck in thunder, if that don't  bang the bush!! It fearly beats sheap shearin arter the  blackberry bushes have got the wool. It does, I vow; them  are the tares them Unitarians sow in our grain fields at  night; I guess they'll ruinate the crops yet, and make  the grounds so everlastin foul; we'll have to pare the  sod and burn it, to kill the roots. Our fathers sowed  the right seed here in the wilderness, and watered it  with their tears, and watched over it with fastin and  prayer, and now its fairly run out, that's a fact, I  snore. Its got choaked up with all sorts of trash in,  natur, I declare. Dear, dear, I vow I never seed the  beat o' that in all my born days.    Now the Blue Noses are like that are gall; they have  grown up, and grown up in ignorance of many things they  had'nt ought not to know; and its as hard to teach grown  up folks as it is to break a six year old horse; and they  do ryle one's temper so--they act so ugly that it tempts  one sometimes to break their confounded necks--its near  about as much trouble as its worth. What remedy is there  for all this supineness, said I; how can these people be  awakened out of their ignorant slothfulness, into active  exertion? The remedy, said Mr, Slick, is at hand--it is  already workin its own cure. They must recede before our  free and enlightened citizens like the Indians; our folks  will buy them out, and they must give place to a more  intelligent and ac-TIVE people. They must go to the lands  of Labrador, or be located back of Canada; they can hold  on there a few years, until the wave of civilization  reaches them, and then they must move again, as the  savages do. It is decreed; I hear the bugle of destiny  a soundin of their retreat, as plain as any thing. Congress  will give them a concession of land, if they petition,  away to Alleghany backside territory, and grant them  relief for a few years; for we are out of debt, and don't  know what to do with our surplus revenue. The only way  to shame them, that I know, would be to sarve them as  Uncle Enoch sarved a neighbor of his in Varginey.    There was a lady that had a plantation near hand to hisn,  and there was only a small river atwixt the two houses,  So that folks could hear each other talk across it. Well,  she was a dreadful cross grained woman, a real catamount,  as savage as a she bear that has cubs, an old farrow  critter, as ugly as sin, and one that both hooked and  kicked too--a most particular onmarciful she devil, that's  a fact. She used to have some of her niggers tied up  every day, and flogged uncommon severe, and their screams  and screeches were horrid--no soul could stand it; nothin  was heerd all day, but OH LORD MISSUS! OH LORD MISSUS!  Enoch was fairly sick of the sound, for he was a tender  hearted man, and says he to her one day, 'Now do marm  find out some other place to give your cattle the cowskin,  for it worries me to hear em take on so dreadful bad--I  cant stand it, I vow; they are flesh and blood as well  as we be, though the meat is a different color' but It  was no good--she jist up and told him to mind his own  business, and she guessed she'd mind hern. He was determined  to shame her out of it; so one mornin after breakfast he  goes into the cane field, and says he to Lavender, one  of the black overseers, 'Muster up the whole gang of  slaves, every soul, and bring 'em down to the whippin  post, the whole stock of them, bulls, cows and calves.  Well, away goes Lavender, and drives up all the niggers.  Now you catch it, says he, you lazy villains; I tole you  so many a time--I tole you Massa he lose all patience  wid you, you good for nothin rascals. I grad, upon my  soul, I werry grad; you mind now what old Lavender say  anoder time. (The black overseers are always the most  cruel, said the Clockmaker; they have no sort of feeling  for their own people.)    Well, when they were gathered there according to orders,  they looked streaked enough you may depend, thinkin they  were going to get it all round, and the wenches they fell  to a cryin, wringin their hands, and boo-hooing like mad.  Lavender was there with his cowskin, grinnin like a chessy  cat, and crackin it about, ready for business. Pick me  out, says Enoch, four that have the loudest voices; hard  matter dat, says Lavender, hard matter dat, Massa, dey  all talk loud, dey all lub talk more better nor work--de  idle villians; better gib 'em all a little tickle, jist  to teach em larf on tother side of de mouth; dat side  bran new, they never use it yet. Do as I order you, Sir,  said Uncle, or I'll have you triced up, you cruel old  rascal you. When they were picked out and sot by themselves,  they hanged their heads, and looked like sheep goin to  the shambles. Now, says Uncle Enoch, my Pickininnies, do  you sing out as loud as Niagara, at the very tip eend of  your voice--        Dont kill a nigger, pray,      Let him lib anoder day.          Oh Lord Missus--oh Lord Missus.        My back be very sore,      No stand it any more,          Oh Lord Missus--oh Lord Missus.    And all the rest of you join chorus, as loud as you can  bawl, 'Oh Lord Missus.' The black rascals understood the  joke real well. They larfed ready to split their sides;  they fairly lay down on the ground, and rolled over and  over with lafter. Well, when they came to the chorus  'Oh Lord Missus,' if they did'nt let go, its a pity. They  made the river ring agin--they were heerd clean out to  sea. All the folks ran out of the Lady's House, to see  what on airth was the matter on Uncle Enoch's plantation  --they thought there was actilly a rebellion there; but  when they listened awhile, and heerd it over and over  again, they took the hint, and returned a larfin in their  sleeves. Says they, Master Enoch Slick, he upsides with  Missus this hitch any how. Uncle never heerd any thing  more of 'Oh Lord Missus' arter that Yes, they ought to  be shamed out of it, those Blue Noses. When reason fails  to convince, there is nothin left but ridicule. If they  have no ambition, apply to their feelings, slap a blister  on their pride, and it will do the business. Its like a  puttin ginger under a horse's tail; it makes him carry  up real handSUM, I tell you. When I was a boy, I was  always late to school: well father's preachin I didn't  mind much, but I never could bear to hear mother say,  'Why Sam, are you actilly up for all day? Well, I hope  your airly risin wont hurt you, I declare. What on airth  is agoin to happen now?' Well, wonders will never cease.  It raised my dander; at last says I, 'Now, mother, don't  say that are any more for gracious sake, for it makes me  feel ugly, and I'll get up as airly as any on you,' and  so I did, and I soon found what's worth knowin in this  life, 'An airly start makes easy stages.'          No. XIII    The Clockmaker's Opinion of Halifax.    The next morning was warmer than several that had preceded  it. It was one of those uncommonly fine days that  distinguish an American autumn. I guess, said Mr. Slick,  the heat to-day is like a glass of Mint Julip, with a  lump of ice in it, it tastes cool and feels warm--its  real good, I tell you; I love such a day as this dearly.  Its generally allowed the finest weather in the world is  in America--there ant the beat of it to be found anywhere.  He then lighted a cigar, and throwing himself back on  his chair, put both feet out of the window, and sat with  his arms folded, a perfect picture of happiness. You  appear, said I, to have travelled over the whole of this  Province, and to have observed the country and the people  with much attention, pray what is your opinion of the  present state and future prospects of Halifax? If you  will tell me, said he, when the folks there will wake  up, then I can answer you, but they are fast asleep; as  to the Province, its a splendid province, and calculated  to go ahead, it will grow as fast as a Varginey gall,  and they grow so amazin fast, if you put your arm round  one of their necks to kiss them, by the time you're done,  they've grown up into women. It's a pretty Province I  tell you, good above and better below; surface covered  with pastures, meadows, woods, and a nation sight of  water privileges, and under the ground full of mines--it  puts me in mind of the soup at the TREE-mont House. One  day I was a walkin in the Mall, and who should I meet  but Major Bradford, a gentleman from Connecticut, that  traded in calves and pumpkins for the Boston market. Says  he, Slick, where do you get your grub to-day? At General  Peep's tavern, says I; only fit for niggers, says he,  why don't you come to the TREE-mont house, that's the  most splendid thing its generally allowed in all the  world. Why, says I, that's a notch above my mark, I guess  it's too plagy dear for me, I cant afford it no how.  Well, says he, its dear in one sense, but its dog cheap  in another--its a grand place for speculation--there's  so many rich southerners and strangers there that have  more money than wit, that you might do a pretty good  business there, without goin out of the street door. I  made two hundred dollars this mornin in little less than  half no time.

Give me  the herbs for the omelette. Be sharp!\"    He was rather abrupt. Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like  that.    She felt surprised, and uncomfortable.    WHILE she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the  shed. Some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and  then locked it.    Jemima became much alarmed.    A MOMENT afterwards there were most awful noises--barking, baying,  growls and howls, squealing and groans.    And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.    PRESENTLY Kep opened the door of the shed, and let out Jemima  Puddle-duck.    Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before  he could stop them.    He had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping.    JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.    SHE laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself:  but only four of them hatched.    Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had  always been a bad sitter.    THE END          THE TALE OF PIGLING BLAND    FOR CECILY AND CHARLIE, A TALE OF THE CHRISTMAS PIG.    THE TALE OF PIGLING BLAND      ONCE upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes. She had  eight of a family: four little girl pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck,  Yock-yock and Spot;    and four little boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling Bland, Chin-chin and  Stumpy. Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.    The eight little pigs had very fine appetites. \"Yus, yus, yus! they eat  and indeed they DO eat!\" said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with  pride. Suddenly there were fearful squeals; Alexander had squeezed  inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck.    Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him out by the hind legs.    Chin-chin was already in disgrace; it was washing day, and he had eaten  a piece of soap. And presently in a basket of clean clothes, we found  another dirty little pig. \"Tchut, tut, tut! whichever is this?\" grunted  Aunt Pettitoes.    Now all the pig family are pink, or pink with black spots, but this pig  child was smutty black all over; when it had been popped into a tub, it  proved to be Yock-yock.    I went into the garden; there I found Cross-patch and Suck-suck rooting  up carrots. I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears.  Cross-patch tried to bite me.    \"Aunt Pettitoes, Aunt Pettitoes! you are a worthy person, but your  family is not well brought up. Every one of them has been in mischief  except Spot and Pigling Bland.\"    \"Yus, yus!\" sighed Aunt Pettitoes. \"And they drink bucketfuls of milk; I  shall have to get another cow! Good little Spot shall stay at home to do  the housework; but the others must go. Four little boy pigs and four  little girl pigs are too many altogether.\" \"Yus, yus, yus,\" said Aunt  Pettitoes, \"there will be more to eat without them.\"    So Chin-chin and Suck-suck went away in a wheel-barrow, and Stumpy,  Yock-yock and Cross-patch rode away in a cart.    And the other two little boy pigs, Pigling Bland and Alexander, went to  market. We brushed their coats, we curled their tails and washed their  little faces, and wished them good-bye in the yard.    Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief, then she  wiped Pigling Bland's nose and shed tears; then she wiped Alexander's  nose and shed tears; then she passed the handkerchief to Spot. Aunt  Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as  follows:    \"Now Pigling Bland, son Pigling Bland, you must go to market. Take your  brother Alexander by the hand. Mind your Sunday clothes, and remember to  blow your nose\"--    (Aunt Pettitoes passed round the handkerchief again)--\"beware of traps,  hen roosts, bacon and eggs; always walk upon your hind legs.\" Pigling  Bland, who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a  tear trickled down his cheek.    Aunt Pettitoes turned to the other--\"Now son Alexander take the  hand\"--\"Wee, wee, wee!\" giggled Alexander--\"take the hand of your  brother Pigling Bland, you must go to market. Mind--\" \"Wee, wee, wee!\"  interrupted Alexander again. \"You put me out,\" said Aunt Pettitoes.    \"Observe sign-posts and milestones; do not gobble herring bones--\" \"And  remember,\" said I impressively, \"if you once cross the county boundary  you cannot come back.    Alexander, you are not attending. Here are two licences permitting two  pigs to go to market in Lancashire. Attend, Alexander. I have had no end  of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman.\"    Pigling Bland listened gravely; Alexander was hopelessly volatile.    I pinned the papers, for safety, inside their waistcoat pockets;    Aunt Pettitoes gave to each a little bundle, and eight conversation  peppermints with appropriate moral sentiments in screws of paper. Then  they started.    Pigling Bland and Alexander trotted along steadily for a mile; at least  Pigling Bland did. Alexander made the road half as long again by  skipping from side to side. He danced about and pinched his brother,  singing--        \"This pig went to market, this pig           stayed at home,      \"This pig had a bit of meat--    let's see what they have given US for dinner, Pigling?\"    Pigling Bland and Alexander sat down and untied their bundles. Alexander  gobbled up his dinner in no time; he had already eaten all his own  peppermints. \"Give me one of yours, please, Pigling.\"    \"But I wish to preserve them for emergencies,\" said Pigling Bland  doubtfully. Alexander went into squeals of laughter. Then he pricked  Pigling with the pin that had fastened his pig paper; and when Pigling  slapped him he dropped the pin, and tried to take Pigling's pin, and the  papers got mixed up. Pigling Bland reproved Alexander.    But presently they made it up again, and trotted away together,  singing--        \"Tom, Tom, the piper's son, stole a pig           and away he ran!      \"But all the tune that he could play,           was 'Over the hills and far away!'\"    \"What's that, young sirs? Stole a pig? Where are your licences?\" said  the policeman. They had nearly run against him round a corner. Pigling  Bland pulled out his paper; Alexander, after fumbling, handed over  something scrumply--    \"To 2 1/2 oz. conversation sweeties at three farthings\"--\"What's this?  This ain't a licence.\" Alexander's nose lengthened visibly, he had lost  it. \"I had one, indeed I had, Mr. Policeman!\"    \"It's not likely they let you start without. I am passing the farm. You  may walk with me.\" \"Can I come back too?\" inquired Pigling Bland. \"I see  no reason, young sir; your paper is all right.\" Pigling Bland did not  like going on alone, and it was beginning to rain. But it is unwise to  argue with the police; he gave his brother a peppermint, and watched him  out of sight.    To conclude the adventures of Alexander--the policeman sauntered up to  the house about tea time, followed by a damp subdued little pig. I  disposed of Alexander in the neighbourhood; he did fairly well when he  had settled down.    Pigling Bland went on alone dejectedly; he came to cross-roads and a  sign-post--\"To Market Town, 5 miles,\" \"Over the Hills, 4 miles,\" \"To  Pettitoes Farm, 3 miles.\"    Pigling Bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in Market  Town, and to-morrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how  much time had been wasted by the frivolity of Alexander.    He glanced wistfully along the road towards the hills, and then set off  walking obediently the other way, buttoning up his coat against the  rain. He had never wanted to go; and the idea of standing all by himself  in a crowded market, to be stared at, pushed, and hired by some big  strange farmer was very disagreeable--    \"I wish I could have a little garden and grow potatoes,\" said Pigling  Bland.    He put his cold hand in his pocket and felt his paper, he put his other  hand in his other pocket and felt another paper--Alexander's! Pigling  squealed; then ran back frantically, hoping to overtake Alexander and  the policeman.    He took a wrong turn--several wrong turns, and was quite lost.    It grew dark, the wind whistled, the trees creaked and groaned.    Pigling Bland became frightened and cried \"Wee, wee, wee! I can't find  my way home!\"    After an hour's wandering he got out of the wood; the moon shone through  the clouds, and Pigling Bland saw a country that was new to him.    The road crossed a moor; below was a wide valley with a river twinkling  in the moonlight, and beyond, in misty distance, lay the hills.    He saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside--\"I am  afraid it IS a hen house, but what can I do?\" said Pigling Bland, wet  and cold and quite tired out.    \"Bacon and eggs, bacon and eggs!\" clucked a hen on a perch.    \"Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle!\" scolded the disturbed  cockerel. \"To market, to market! jiggetty jig!\" clucked a broody white  hen roosting next to him. Pigling Bland, much alarmed, determined to  leave at daybreak. In the meantime, he and the hens fell asleep.    In less than an hour they were all awakened. The owner, Mr. Peter Thomas  Piperson, came with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowls to take to  market in the morning.    He grabbed the white hen roosting next to the cock; then his eye fell  upon Pigling Bland, squeezed up in a corner. He made a singular  remark--\"Hallo, here's another!\"--seized Pigling by the scruff of the  neck, and dropped him into the hamper. Then he dropped in five more  dirty, kicking, cackling hens upon the top of Pigling Bland.    The hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight; it  was taken down hill, unsteadily, with jerks. Pigling, although nearly  scratched to pieces, contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside  his clothes.    At last the hamper was bumped down upon a kitchen floor, the lid was  opened, and"]]]
