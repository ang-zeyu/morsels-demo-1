[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/690"],[0,"Proposed Roads to Freedom (#12)"],[1," the work has been done under trade-  union conditions, have played a considerable part  in American labor struggles.    Sabotage is the practice of doing bad work, or  spoiling machinery or work which has already been  done, as a method of dealing with employers in a  dispute when a strike appears for some reason  undesirable or impossible. It has many forms, some  clearly innocent, some open to grave objections. One  form of sabotage which has been adopted by shop  assistants is to tell customers the truth about the  articles they are buying; this form, however it may  damage the shopkeeper's business, is not easy to  object to on moral grounds. A form which has been  adopted on railways, particularly in Italian strikes,  is that of obeying all rules literally and exactly, in  such a way as to make the running of trains practically  impossible. Another form is to do all the  work with minute care, so that in the end it is better  done, but the output is small. From these innocent  forms there is a continual progression, until we come  to such acts as all ordinary morality would consider  criminal; for example, causing railway accidents.  Advocates of sabotage justify it as part of  war, but in its more violent forms (in which it is  seldom defended) it is cruel and probably inexpedient,  while even in its milder forms it must tend to encourage  slovenly habits of work, which might easily persist  under the new regime that the Syndicalists wish  to introduce. At the same time, when capitalists  express a moral horror of this method, it is worth  while to observe that they themselves are the first  to practice it when the occasion seems to them appropriate.  If report speaks truly, an example of this  on a very large scale has been seen during the Russian  Revolution.    By far the most important of the Syndicalist  methods is the strike. Ordinary strikes, for specific  objects, are regarded as rehearsals, as a means of  perfecting organization and promoting enthusiasm,  but even when they are victorious so far as concerns  the specific point in dispute, they are not regarded  by Syndicalists as affording any ground for industrial  peace. Syndicalists aim at using the strike,  not to secure such improvements of detail as employers  may grant, but to destroy the whole system of  employer and employed and win the complete emancipation  of the worker. For this purpose what is  wanted is the General Strike, the complete cessation  of work by a sufficient proportion of the wage-earners  to secure the paralysis of capitalism. Sorel, who  represents Syndicalism too much in the minds of the  reading public, suggests that the General Strike is to  be regarded as a myth, like the Second Coming in  Christian doctrine. But this view by no means suits  the active Syndicalists. If they were brought to  believe that the General Strike is a mere myth, their  energy would flag, and their whole outlook would  become disillusioned. It is the actual, vivid belief  in its possibility which inspires them. They are much  criticised for this belief by the political Socialists  who consider that the battle is to be won by obtaining  a Parliamentary majority. But Syndicalists have  too little faith in the honesty of politicians to place  any reliance on such a method or to believe in the  value of any revolution which leaves the power of the  State intact.    Syndicalist aims are somewhat less definite than  Syndicalist methods. The intellectuals who endeavor  to interpret them--not always very faithfully--  represent them as a party of movement and change,  following a Bergsonian elan vital, without needing  any very clear prevision of the goal to which it is to  take them. Nevertheless, the negative part, at any  rate, of their objects is sufficiently clear.    They wish to destroy the State, which they  regard as a capitalist institution, designed essentially  to terrorize the workers. They refuse to  believe that it would be any better under State Socialism.  They desire to see each industry self-governing,  but as to the means of adjusting the relations between  different industries, they are not very clear. They  are anti-militarist because they are anti-State, and  because French troops have often been employed  against them in strikes; also because they are  internationalists, who believe that the sole interest of the  working man everywhere is to free himself from the  tyranny of the capitalist. Their outlook on life is  the very reverse of pacifist, but they oppose wars  between States on the ground that these are not  fought for objects that in any way concern the  workers. Their anti-militarism, more than anything  else, brought them into conflict with the authorities  in the years preceding the war. But, as was to be  expected, it did not survive the actual invasion of  France.    The doctrines of Syndicalism may be illustrated  by an article introducing it to English readers in  the first number of ``The Syndicalist Railwayman,''  September, 1911, from which the following is quoted:--      ``All Syndicalism, Collectivism, Anarchism aims at  abolishing the present economic status and existing private  ownership of most things; but while Collectivism  would substitute ownership by everybody, and Anarchism  ownership by nobody, Syndicalism aims at ownership by  Organized Labor. It is thus a purely Trade Union  reading of the economic doctrine and the class war  preached by Socialism. It vehemently repudiates Parliamentary  action on which Collectivism relies; and it is,  in this respect, much more closely allied to Anarchism,  from which, indeed, it differs in practice only in being  more limited in range of action.'' (Times, Aug. 25, 1911).    In truth, so thin is the partition between Syndicalism  and Anarchism that the newer and less familiar ``ism''  has been shrewdly defined as ``Organized Anarchy.'' It  has been created by the Trade Unions of France; but it  is obviously an international plant, whose roots have  already found the soil of Britain most congenial to its  growth and fructification.    Collectivist or Marxian Socialism would have us believe  that it is distinctly a LABOR Movement; but it is  not so. Neither is Anarchism. The one is substantially  bourgeois; the other aristocratic, plus an abundant output  of book-learning, in either case. Syndicalism, on the contrary,  is indubitably laborist in origin and aim, owing  next to nothing to the ``Classes,'' and, indeed,, resolute to  uproot them. The Times (Oct. 13, 1910), which almost  single-handed in the British Press has kept creditably  abreast of Continental Syndicalism, thus clearly set forth  the significance of the General Strike:      ``To understand what it means, we must remember  that there is in France a powerful Labor Organization  which has for its open and avowed object a Revolution,  in which not only the present order of Society, but the  State itself, is to be swept away. This movement is called  Syndicalism. It is not Socialism, but, on the contrary,  radically opposed to Socialism, because the Syndicalists  hold that the State is the great enemy and that the  Socialists' ideal of State or Collectivist Ownership would  make the lot of the Workers much worse than it is now  under private employers. The means by which they hope  to attain their end is the General Strike, an idea which  was invented by a French workman about twenty years  ago,[27] and was adopted by the French Labor Congress in  1894, after a furious battle with the Socialists, in which  the latter were worsted. Since then the General Strike  has been the avowed policy of the Syndicalists, whose  organization is the Confederation Generale du Travail.''      [27] In fact the General Strike was invented by a Londoner  William Benbow, an Owenite, in 1831.      Or, to put it otherwise, the intelligent French worker  has awakened, as he believes, to the fact that Society  (Societas) and the State (Civitas) connote two separable  spheres of human activity, between which there is no  connection, necessary or desirable. Without the one, man,  being a gregarious animal, cannot subsist: while without  the other he would simply be in clover. The ``statesman''  whom office does not render positively nefarious  is at best an expensive superfluity.      Syndicalists have had many violent encounters  with the forces of government. In 1907 and 1908,  protesting against bloodshed which had occurred in  the suppression of strikes, the Committee of the C.  G. T. issued manifestoes speaking of the Government  as ``a Government of assassins'' and alluding  to the Prime Minister as ``Clemenceau the murderer.''  Similar events in the strike at Villeneuve St. Georges  in 1908 led to the arrest of all the leading members  of the Committee. In the railway strike of October,  1910, Monsieur Briand arrested the Strike Committee,  mobilized the railway men and sent soldiers  to replace strikers. As a result of these vigorous  measures the strike was completely defeated, and  after this the chief energy of the C. G. T. was directed  against militarism and nationalism.    The attitude of Anarchism to the Syndicalist  movement is sympathetic, with the reservation that  such methods as the General Strike are not to be  regarded as substitutes for the violent revolution  which most Anarchists consider necessary. Their  attitude in this matter was defined at the International  Anarchist Congress held in Amsterdam in  August, 1907. This Congress recommended ``comrades  of all countries to actively participate in autonomous  movements of the working class, and to  develop in Syndicalist organizations the ideas of  revolt, individual initiative and solidarity, which are  the essence of Anarchism.'' Comrades were to  ``propagate and support only those forms and manifestations  of direct action which carry, in themselves,  a revolutionary character and lead to the  transformation of society.'' It was resolved that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6927"],[0,"The White Feather (#12)"],[1,"'ve seen the way you stand up to  Francis, and I'll eat--I'll eat the medicine-ball if you're not as  plucky as anyone. It's simply a question of keeping your head. You  wouldn't do a thing like that again, not you. Don't you worry yourself,  sir. We're all alike when we get bustled. We don't know what we're  doing, and by the time we've put our hands up and got into shape, why,  it's all over, and there you are. Don't you worry yourself, sir.\"    \"You're an awfully good sort, Joe,\" said Sheen gratefully.          XI    A SMALL INCIDENT      Failing a gentleman friend, Mr Bevan was obliged to do what he could by  means of local talent. On Sheen's next visit he was introduced to a  burly youth of his own age, very taciturn, and apparently ferocious.  He, it seemed, was the knife and boot boy at the \"Blue Boar\", \"did a  bit\" with the gloves, and was willing to spar with Sheen provided Mr  Bevan made it all right with the guv'nor; saw, that is so say, that he  did not get into trouble for passing in unprofessional frivolity  moments which should have been sacred to knives and boots. These terms  having been agreed to, he put on the gloves.    For the first time since he had begun his lessons, Sheen experienced an  attack of his old shyness and dislike of hurting other people's  feelings. He could not resist the thought that he had no grudge against  the warden of the knives and boots. He hardly liked to hit him.    The other, however, did not share this prejudice. He rushed at Sheen  with such determination, that almost the first warning the latter had  that the contest had begun was the collision of the back of his head  with the wall. Out in the middle of the room he did better, and was  beginning to hold his own, in spite of a rousing thump on his left eye,  when Joe Bevan called \"Time!\" A second round went off in much the same  way. His guard was more often in the right place, and his leads less  wild. At the conclusion of the round, pressure of business forced his  opponent to depart, and Sheen wound up his lesson with a couple of  minutes at the punching-ball. On the whole, he was pleased with his  first spar with someone who was really doing his best and trying to  hurt him. With Joe Bevan and Francis there was always the feeling that  they were playing down to him. Joe Bevan's gentle taps, in particular,  were a little humiliating. But with his late opponent all had been  serious. It had been a real test, and he had come through it very  fairly. On the whole, he had taken more than he had given--his eye  would look curious tomorrow--but already he had thought out a way of  foiling the burly youth's rushes. Next time he would really show his  true form.    The morrow, on which Sheen expected his eye to look curious, was the  day he had promised to play fives with Mr Spence. He hoped that at the  early hour at which they had arranged to play it would not have reached  its worst stage; but when he looked in the glass at a quarter to seven,  he beheld a small ridge of purple beneath it. It was not large, nor did  it interfere with his sight, but it was very visible. Mr Spence,  however, was a sportsman, and had boxed himself in his time, so there  was a chance that nothing would be said.    It was a raw, drizzly morning. There would probably be few  fives-players before breakfast, and the capture of the second court  should be easy. So it turned out. Nobody was about when Sheen arrived.  He pinned his slip of paper to the door, and, after waiting for a short  while for Mr Spence and finding the process chilly, went for a trot  round the gymnasium to pass the time.    Mr Spence had not arrived during his absence, but somebody else had. At  the door of the second court, gleaming in first-fifteen blazer,  sweater, stockings, and honour-cap, stood Attell.    Sheen looked at Attell, and Attell looked through Sheen.    It was curious, thought Sheen, that Attell should be standing in the  very doorway of court two. It seemed to suggest that he claimed some  sort of ownership. On the other hand, there was his, Sheen's, paper on  the.... His eye happened to light on the cement flooring in front of the  court. There was a crumpled ball of paper there.    When he had started for his run, there had been no such ball of paper.    Sheen picked it up and straightened it out. On it was written \"R. D.  Sheen\".    He looked up quickly. In addition to the far-away look, Attell's face  now wore a faint smile, as if he had seen something rather funny on the  horizon. But he spake no word.    A curiously calm and contented feeling came upon Sheen. Here was  something definite at last. He could do nothing, however much he might  resent it, when fellows passed him by as if he did not exist; but when  it came to removing his landmark....    \"Would you mind shifting a bit?\" he said very politely. \"I want to pin  my paper on the door again. It seems to have fallen down.\"    Attell's gaze shifted slowly from the horizon and gradually embraced  Sheen.    \"I've got this court,\" he said.    \"I think not,\" said Sheen silkily. \"I was here at ten to seven, and  there was no paper on the door then. So I put mine up. If you move a  little, I'll put it up again.\"    \"Go and find another court, if you want to play,\" said Attell, \"and if  you've got anybody to play with,\" he added with a sneer. \"This is  mine.\"    \"I think not,\" said Sheen.    Attell resumed his inspection of the horizon.    \"Attell,\" said Sheen.    Attell did not answer.    Sheen pushed him gently out of the way, and tore down the paper from  the door.    Their eyes met. Attell, after a moment's pause, came forward,  half-menacing, half irresolute; and as he came Sheen hit him under the  chin in the manner recommended by Mr Bevan.    \"When you upper-cut,\" Mr Bevan was wont to say, \"don't make it a swing.  Just a half-arm jolt's all you want.\"    It was certainly all Attell wanted. He was more than surprised. He was  petrified. The sudden shock of the blow, coming as it did from so  unexpected a quarter, deprived him of speech: which was, perhaps,  fortunate for him, for what he would have said would hardly have  commended itself to Mr Spence, who came up at this moment.    \"Well, Sheen,\" said Mr Spence, \"here you are. I hope I haven't kept you  waiting. What a morning! You've got the court, I hope?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Sheen.    He wondered if the master had seen the little episode which had taken  place immediately before his arrival. Then he remembered that it had  happened inside the court. It must have been over by the time Mr Spence  had come upon the scene.    \"Are you waiting for somebody, Attell?\" asked Mr Spence. \"Stanning? He  will be here directly. I passed him on the way.\"    Attell left the court, and they began their game.    \"You've hurt your eye, Sheen,\" said Mr Spence, at the end of the first  game. \"How did that happen?\"    \"Boxing, sir,\" said Sheen.    \"Oh,\" replied Mr Spence, and to Sheen's relief he did not pursue his  inquiries.    Attell had wandered out across the gravel to meet Stanning.    \"Got that court?\" inquired Stanning.    \"No.\"    \"You idiot, why on earth didn't you? It's the only court worth playing  in. Who's got it?\"    \"Sheen.\"    \"Sheen!\" Stanning stopped dead. \"Do you mean to say you let a fool like  Sheen take it from you! Why didn't you turn him out?\"    \"I couldn't,\" said Attell. \"I was just going to when Spence came up.  He's playing Sheen this morning. I couldn't very well bag the court  when a master wanted it.\"    \"I suppose not,\" said Stanning. \"What did Sheen say when you told him  you wanted the court?\"    This was getting near a phase of the subject which Attell was not eager  to discuss.    \"Oh, he didn't say much,\" he said.    \"Did you do anything?\" persisted Stanning.    Attell suddenly remembered having noticed that Sheen was wearing a  black eye. This was obviously a thing to be turned to account.    \"I hit him in the eye,\" he said. \"I'll bet it's coloured by  school-time.\"    And sure enough, when school-tune arrived, there was Sheen with his  face in the condition described, and Stanning hastened to spread abroad  this sequel to the story of Sheen's failings in the town battle. By the  end of preparation it had got about the school that Sheen had cheeked  Attell, that Attell had hit Sheen, and that Sheen had been afraid to  hit him back. At the precise moment when Sheen was in the middle of a  warm two-minute round with Francis at the \"Blue Boar,\" an indignation  meeting was being held in the senior day-room at Seymour's to discuss  this latest disgrace to the house.    \"This is getting a bit too thick,\" was the general opinion. Moreover,  it was universally agreed that something ought to be done. The feeling  in the house against Sheen had been stirred to a dangerous pitch by  this last episode. Seymour's thought more of their reputation than any  house in the school. For years past the house had led on the cricket  and football field and off it. Sometimes other houses would actually  win one of the cups, but, when this happened, Seymour's was always  their most dangerous rival. Other houses had their ups and downs, were  very good one year and very bad the next; but Seymour's had always  managed to maintain a steady level of excellence. It always had a man  or two in the School eleven and fifteen, generally supplied one of the  School Racquets pair for Queen's Club in the Easter vac., and when this  did not happen always had one of two of the Gym. Six or Shooting Eight,  or a few men who had won scholarships at the 'Varsities. The pride of a  house is almost keener than the pride of a school. From the first  minute he entered the house a new boy was made to feel that, in coming  to Seymour's, he had accepted a responsibility that his reputation was  not his own, but belonged to the house. If he did well, the glory would  be Seymour's glory. If he did badly, he would be sinning against the  house.    This second story"]]]
