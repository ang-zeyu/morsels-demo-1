The following year the amount extracted was 4,247,657 oz., value  L14,866,799.    The crowd of gold-seekers and adventurers, attracted by the discovery, was  something tremendous. From the commencement of Sept. 1851, when 29 men  were engaged in washing at Anderson's Creek, to the end of December, only  four months, the population of the diggings reached 20,300; in 1852 they  numbered 53,500, in 1853 75,626.    Shortly after the discovery of the gold-fields, the Colonial Government  appointed special officers, the well-known \"Gold Commission,\" to watch  over these improvised settlements. They published \"Regulations for the  management of the gold-fields,\" and sold licenses, at 20_s._ or 40_s._  according to yield, for the privilege of digging within certain limits;  the localities most in favour being Ballarat, Mount Alexander, Castlemain,  Sandhurst, Beechworth, and Heathcote.    The gold obtained in 1852 was valued at from 58_s._ to 60_s._ per ounce.  The banks made advances at the rate of from 40_s._ to 55_s._ per oz., or  exchanged the gold-dust at from 8-1/2 to 10 per cent. discount for coined  money. The freight was 4-1/2_d._ per oz. In 1858 the value of the ounce  had risen at the \"diggings\" to from 70_s._ to 77_s._, and the discount had  fallen to 1 per cent., and the Insurance Company charged for gold  transport a premium of from 1-3/4 to 2-1/2 per cent.    Since that period gold has repeatedly been discovered in fresh localities  of the adjoining colony of Victoria, the \"yield\" and the number of  diggers being also steadily increasing. Many thousands at present leave  New South Wales annually to try their fortune in other fields than those  of agriculture. In 1857 upwards of 26,000 persons left this colony for  Victoria. Consequently, the price of labour has risen throughout  Australia, and while it has thus increased in expense it has become more  uncertain and unreliable. A large number of buildings, especially in the  country, have been left unfinished, and the clearing and cultivation of  numerous tracts of land have been abandoned. These temporary evils,  however, cannot be permitted to outweigh the enormous advantages derivable  from the discovery of the gold-fields of Australia. It has attracted the  attention of universal mankind to a distant British colony, hitherto  almost unnoticed, it has peopled the country with magic celerity,  centupled the value of the land, made its results appreciable in the  remotest districts of the globe, and raised the colony of Victoria within  a few years, in national prosperity, increased trade, and extended  cultivation, to a degree of importance usually the slow growth of  centuries of industry.    The discovery of the gold-fields had at the same time important scientific  consequences, chiefly in the way of geological researches, which resulted  in proving that the widespread popular opinion, that the Australian  continent belongs to the latest geological era, and had comparatively  recently emerged from the sea, is entirely erroneous. Rich palaeontological  collections confirm the opinion that Australia is not the latest, but  rather the earliest, continent. In several parts of the colony the fossil  remains of various colossal animals have been discovered, which, as since  measured, must have stood from 10 to 16 feet in height, and correspond to  our diluvial Pachydermata in Europe. In like manner, with the exception of  some quite insignificant tertiary strata of small extent, only crystalline  rocks and primary formations (from the Silurian upwards) form the chief  bulk of the continent. The entire series of secondary strata seems to be  absent. From this fact it necessarily results that Australia has been a  continent since the end of the primary epoch, that it never has been  covered by the sea, but remained ever since the beginning of the secondary  formations, through all those countless ages during which Europe was being  convulsed by the most tremendous geological revolutions, a habitable soil,  on which plants and beasts, undisturbed by change in the inorganic world,  might have continued to flourish down to our own times. Viewed in this  light the fauna and flora of Australia would be the most ancient and  primitive in the world.    Another Austrian naturalist, the well-known botanist Professor Unger of  Vienna, has come to the same conclusions from the fossil remains of some  Australian plants, accompanied by the further singular deduction, that  Europe must have been at one period in much closer accordance with this  remote region. Many forms of plants, especially _Proteaceae_, which at  present form such a peculiar feature of its vegetation, seem to have been  similarly prevalent in Europe at that remote age of the globe. But if  even it be accepted that during the Eocene or earliest tertiary period  there existed in Europe under similar climatic conditions flora of  _Coniferae_, _Proteaceae_, _Myrtaceae_, and _Casurinae_, such as Australia now  possesses, the question still arises as to how the vegetation of a  locality so remote should have been transferred to antipodean Europe?  Making all due allowance for the astonishing influence exercised by winds,  waves, and the migration of animals over the diffusion of vegetable  species, yet the means of transport by the ocean or by currents of water  is confined within narrow limits, and under the most favourable conditions  is limited to the very few plants which can maintain their powers of  reproduction uninjured by immersion in water, and those on the other hand  which, on being transported to a strange shore, find there the means of  existence and increase. As, moreover, the observations which Professor  Unger has made upon the diffusion of species of plants at that remote  period, and their very accurately circumscribed limits, run directly  counter to the opinion of those naturalists who hold to a variety of  centres of development, (instancing a case where one species of plants is  found in two widely separated regions,) have never been satisfactorily  refuted, the learned botanist thereupon proceeds to the conclusion, that  during the Eocene period Australia was united to the mainland through the  Moluccas. This land route has been followed at one period by _Araucarias_,  _Proteaceae_, sandal wood, and a hundred other varieties of tree and  shrub, which till that connection was made could not diffuse themselves,  so as thus to reach the European continent, where they are even now found,  despite the lapse of myriads of years, in the shape of well-preserved  fossils. Thus too, for similar reasons, the geologist to our Expedition,  like Professor Unger, regarded Australia as not a youthful, lately-born  continent, but a country decaying with antiquity, which had played its  part in the physical history of the globe, and had spread its scions far  and wide. Some alteration of level is not merely indicated by the numerous  coral reefs encircling Australia and its island groups, pointing to a  similar sinking among them as that already noticed among the smaller  Polynesian islands:--The whole characteristics of the soil, the wastes of  the interior, the innumerable salt lakes, the rivers which lose themselves  in these, &c. &c., tell of a coming geological transformation, which  however--we mention this for the consolation of the settlers--may yet be  postponed for myriads of years.    The system of transportation, concerning which so loud an outcry has  recently been made, has so materially assisted in developing the resources  of the country, that it would hardly be right to quit Botany Bay without a  few remarks on the penal colony which was in existence there till 1840.  For there is no spot on the globe better adapted than New South Wales to  serve as a stand-point, whence any one might accurately study the  advantages and drawbacks of the English transportation system, as also its  influence upon a strongly recalcitrant society. In brief, we purpose to  subject the system as it subsisted for half a century in Australia to a  thorough analysis, inasmuch as it seems to us that, in our present  unnatural social conditions, transportation, i. e. the sudden transference  of the criminal to totally new conditions of external life, seems to  furnish the much-desired turning point whence we may expect a lasting  moral improvement of the individual. Our Austrian prisons, especially  those in which the cell system has not been introduced, are simply houses  of detention, not penitentiaries, still less reformatories. The  incarcerated criminal is a burden to himself and to society, to which he  is only in the most exceptional cases restored improved by confinement.  The charge of maintaining him increases year by year, without any return  being made by utilizing the labour of the prisoner. In penal colonies, on  the other hand, the convict works as much for his own benefit as for that  of society. He throws open new immeasurable tracts of land to  civilization, trade, and industry. The evil effects of certain climates  upon the health of the convict can be corrected by proper ordinances, till  it is reduced to a barely appreciable minimum. The free settler is also  exposed in unsettled countries to dangerous illnesses, but as his  circumstances improve these disappear before the cleared forest, the  cultivated patch, the drained swamp.    We do not believe that were the option left them there is one solitary  individual in our Austrian prisons, condemned to periods of imprisonment  of ten years and upwards, who would not willingly exchange his sojourn at  home for one in even the insalubrious islands of the Indian Ocean, if the  prospect were held out to him after a series of years of steady labour and  honest activity, that he might make his new-found activity available to  secure his liberty.

This invention relates to apparatus for  sweeping up and collecting dirt, dust, and other refuse from floors,  carpets, streets, and other places. The dust box is to be rolled over  the floor and the brush revolved by a winch. The speed of the brush is  independent of the motion of the machine along the floor.    Mr. D. A.

It is a well known fact to medical men that there exists a great  prejudice among a large number of people against taking quinine, the  idea being very prevalent that a prolonged use of it not only affects  the hearing, but (to use the common expression) that it \"gets into  the bones.\" As regards the former belief, Dr. Roosa, of New York,  has recently been collecting and examining the evidence as far as  possible, and has come to the conclusion that in some cases there  really is a permanent nervous affection of the ear produced which  justifies the opinion held by the laity. Hitherto physicians have  generally disbelieved this, and ascribed the notion to prejudice.           *       *       *       *       *          THE MICROPHONE AS A THIEF CATCHER.      The microphone as a thief catcher has proved very useful to an English  resident in India, who found his store of oil rapidly and mysteriously  diminishing. He fixed a microphone to the oil cans, carried the wire  up to his bedroom, and, after the house had been closed for the night,  sat up to await the result. Very shortly he heard the clinking of  bottles, followed by the gurgling sound of liquid being poured out,  and running downstairs he caught his bearer in the act of filling  small bottles with oil for easy conveyance from the premises.           *       *       *       *       *          THE TALLEST TREE IN THE WORLD.      The tallest accurately measured _Sequoia_ standing in the Calaveras  Grove, near Stockton, California, measures 325 feet, and there is  no positive evidence that any trees of this genus ever exceeded that  height. Of late years, explorations in Gippsland, Victoria, have  brought to light some marvelous specimens of _Eucalyptus_, and the  State Surveyor of Forests measured a fallen tree on the banks of the  Watts River, and found it to be 435 feet from the roots to the top of  the trunk. The crest of this tree was broken off, but the trunk at the  fracture was 9 feet in circumference, and the height of the tree when  growing was estimated to have been more than 500 feet. This tree,  however, was dead, though there is no doubt that it was far loftier  than the tallest Sequoia. Near Fernshaw, in the Dandenong district,  Victoria, there has recently been discovered a specimen of the \"Almond  Leaf Gum\" (_Eucalyptus amygdalesia_), measuring 380 feet from the  ground to the first branch, and 450 feet to the topmost wing. This  tree would overtop the tallest living _Sequoia_ by 125 feet. Its girth  is 80 feet, which is less than that of many Sequoias, but as far as  height is concerned it must be considered the tallest living tree in  the world.           *       *       *       *       *          THE ARGONAUT, OR PAPER NAUTILUS.      [Illustration: ARGONAUT, OR PAPER NAUTILUS.]    This mollusk received the first title in allusion to the pretty fable  which was formerly narrated of its sailing powers, and the latter  title is given on account of the extreme thinness and fragility of the  shell. It is remarkable that the shell of the argonaut is, during the  life of its owner, elastic and yielding, almost as if it were made of  thin horn.    The two arms of the argonaut are greatly dilated at their extremities;  and it was formerly asserted, and generally believed, that the  creature was accustomed to employ these arms as sails, raising them  high above the shell, and allowing itself to be driven over the  surface by the breeze, while it directed its course by the remaining  arms, which were suffered to hang over the edge of the shell into the  water and acted like so many oars. In consequence of this belief the  creature was named the argonaut, in allusion to the old classical  fable of the ship Argo and her golden freight.    The animal, or \"poulp,\" as it is technically called, is a lovely  creature despite its unattractive form. It is a mass of silver with a  cloud of spots of the most beautiful rose color, and a fine dotting  of the same, which heighten its beauty. A large membrane, which is  the expanded velation of the arms, covers all. It has been definitely  proved that the use of the expanded arms which cover the exterior of  the shell is to build up its delicate texture, and to repair damages,  the substance being secreted by these arms, and by their broad  expansions moulded into shape. The larger figure in the engraving  represents the argonaut while thus within its shell. While crawling  the creature turns itself so as to rest on its head, withdraws its  body as far as possible into its shell, and, using its arms like legs,  creeps slowly but securely along the ground, sometimes affixing its  disks to stones or projecting points of rocks for the purpose of  hauling itself along. When, however, it wishes to attain greater  speed, and to pass through the waters, it makes use of a totally  different principle. Respiration is achieved by the passage of water  over double gills or branchiae; the water, after it has completed its  purpose, being ejected through a moderately long tube, technically  called a siphon. The orifice of the siphon is directed toward the  head of the animal, and it is by means of this simple apparatus that  progression is effected. When the creature desires to dart rapidly  through the water, it gathers its six arms into a straight line, so  as to afford little resistance to the water, keeps its velated arms  stretched tightly over the shell, and then, by violently ejecting  the water from the siphon, drives itself by reaction in the opposite  direction. The uppermost figure shows the argonaut in the act of  swimming.           *       *       *       *       *          THE TRAP DOOR SPIDER OF JAMAICA.      This spider digs a burrow in the earth and lines it with a silken web.  The burrow is closed by a trap door, having a hinge that permits it  to be opened and closed with admirable accuracy. The door is circular,  and is made of alternate layers of earth and web, and is hinged to  the lining of the tube that leads to the burrow by a band of the same  silken secretion. The door exactly fits the entrance to the burrow,  and when closed, so precisely corresponds with the surrounding earth  that it can hardly be distinguished, even when its position is known.  It is a strange sight to see the earth open, a little lid raised, some  hairy legs protrude, and gradually the whole form of the spider show  itself.    [Illustration: TRAP DOOR SPIDER.]    The mode in which these spiders procure food seems to be by hunting at  night, and in some cases by catching insects that are entangled in the  threads that the creature spins by the side of its house.    In the day time they are very chary of opening the door of their  domicile, and if the trap be raised from the outside, they run to the  spot, hitch the claws of their fore feet in the silken webbing of the  door, and those of the hind feet in the lining of the burrow, and so  resist with all their might. The strength of the spider is wonderfully  great in proportion to its size.           *       *       *       *       *          TO MAKE A HOLE IN GLASS.      _New Remedies_ describes the following easy method of making a hole  in plate glass: Make a circle of clay or cement rather larger than the  intended hole; pour some kerosene into the cell thus made, ignite  it, place the plate upon a moderately hard support, and with a stick  rather smaller than the hole required, and a hammer, strike a rather  smart blow. This will leave a rough-edged hole, which may be smoothed  with a file. Cold water is said to answer even better than a blow.           *       *       *       *       *          THE PRESERVATION OF EGGS.      As science advances, the processes proposed for the preservation  of organic substances are being brought to greater and greater  perfection. No subject perhaps in this connection has received  greater attention, and been the subject of more processes, patent and  otherwise, than that of the preservation of eggs. In fact this is a  question of considerable importance, not only from a culinary, but  also from an industrial standpoint--that of the manufacture of albumen  for photographic purposes. In the _Moniteur de la Photographie_ Dr.  Phipson calls attention to a new process, which may be briefly stated  as follows:    On taking the eggs from the nest they are covered over, by means of a  bit of wool, with butter in which has been dissolved 2 or 3 per cent  of salicylic acid. Each egg, after receiving this coat, is placed in  a box filled with very fine and absolutely dry saw dust. If care  be taken that the eggs do not touch each other, and that they be  perfectly covered with the saw dust, they will keep fresh for several  months--perhaps for more than a year. Dr. Phipson states that he has  experimented with this process for two years, with most excellent  results. So much for the preservation of the entire egg; but there  is also a process for the preservation of the albumen of the egg  for photographic uses, due to M. Berg. In this process, the white,  separated from the yolk, is evaporated in zinc pans or porcelain cups,  at a temperature of 45 deg. C. The solidified albumen thus obtained is  pulverized by means of a mill. The yolk, by means of machinery, is  whipped up into a light mass, and then spread out on zinc plates and  evaporated to dryness at a"]]]
