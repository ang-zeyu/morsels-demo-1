Let loose the reins to all your watery store;    Bear down the dams and open every door.\"      The floods, by nature enemies to land,    And proudly swelling with their new command,    Remove the living stones that stopped their way,    And, gushing from their source, augment the sea.    Then with his mace their monarch struck the ground:    With inward trembling Earth received the wound,    And rising stream a ready passage found.    The expanded waters gather on the plain,    They float the fields and overtop the grain;    Then, rushing onward, with a sweepy sway,    Bear flocks and folds and laboring hinds away.    Nor safe their dwellings were; for, sapped by floods,    Their houses fell upon their household gods.    The solid hills, too strongly built to fall,    High o'er their heads behold a watery wall.    Now seas and earth were in confusion lost--    A world of waters, and without a coast.      One climbs a cliff; one in his boat is borne,    And ploughs above where late he sowed his corn.    Others o'er chimney-tops and turrets row,    And drop their anchors on the meads below;    Or, downward driven, they bruise the tender vine,    Or, tossed aloft, are hurled against a pine.    And where of late the kids had cropped the grass,    The monsters of the deep now take their place.    Insulting Ner'e-ids on the cities ride,    And wondering dolphins o'er the palace glide.    On leaves and masts of mighty oaks they browse,    And their broad fins entangle in the boughs.      The frighted wolf now swims among the sheep,    The yellow lion wanders in the deep;    His rapid force no longer helps the boar,    The stag swims faster than he ran before.    The fowls, long beating on their wings in vain,    Despair of land, and drop into the main.    Now hills and vales no more distinction know,    And levelled nature lies oppressed below.    The most of mortals perished in the flood,    The small remainder dies for want of food.    Deucalion and Pyrrha were conveyed to the summit of Mount Parnassus,  the highest mountain in Central Greece. According to Ovid, Deucalion  now consulted the ancient oracle of Themis respecting the restoration  of mankind, and received the following response:  \"Depart from the temple, veil your heads, loosen your girded  vestments, and cast behind you the great bones of your parent.\" At  length Deucalion discovered the meaning of the oracle--the bones  being, by a very natural figure, the stones, or rocky heights, of  the earth. The poet then gives the following account of the  abatement of the waters, and of the appearance of the earth:      \"When Jupiter, surveying earth from high,    Beheld it in a lake of water lie--    That, where so many millions lately lived,    But two, the best of either sex, survived--    He loosed the northern wind: fierce Boreas flies    To puff away the clouds and purge the skies:    Serenely, while he blows, the vapors driven    Discover heaven to earth and earth to heaven;    The billows fall while Neptune lays his mace    On the rough sea, and smooths its furrowed face.    Already Triton [Footnote: Son of Neptune.] at his call appears    Above the waves: a Tyrian robe he wears,    And in his hands a crooked trumpet bears.    The sovereign bids him peaceful sounds inspire,    And give the waves the signal to retire.    The waters, listening to the trumpet's roar,    Obey the summons, and forsake the shore.    A thin circumference of land appears,    And Earth, but not at once, her visage rears,    And peeps upon the seas from upper grounds:    The streams, but just contained within their bounds,    By slow degrees into their channels crawl,    And earth increases as the waters fall:    In longer time the tops of trees appear,    Which mud on their dishonored branches bear.      At length the world was all restored to view,    But desolate, and of a sickly hue:    Nature beheld herself, and stood aghast,    A dismal desert and a silent waste.    When the waters had abated Deucalion left the rocky heights behind  him, in obedience to the direction of the oracle, and went to  dwell in the plains below.      MORAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GODS, AND OF THEIR RULE OVER MANKIND.    It is a prominent feature of the polytheistic system of the Greeks  that the gods are represented as subject to all the passions and  frailties of human nature. There were, indeed, among them  personifications of good and of evil, as we see in A'te, the  goddess of revenge or punishment, and in the Erin'nys (or Furies),  who avenge violations of filial duty, punish perjury, and are the  maintainers of order both in the moral and the natural world; yet  while these moral ideas restrained and checked men, the gods seem  to have been almost wholly free from such control. \"The society  of Olympus, therefore,\" says MAHAFFY, \"is only an ideal Greek  society in the lowest sense--the ideal of the school-boy who  thinks all control irksome, and its absence the greatest good--the  ideal of a voluptuous man, who has strong passions, and longs for  the power to indulge them without unpleasant consequences. It  appears, therefore, that the Homeric picture of Olympus is very  valuable, as disclosing to us the poet's notion of a society freed  from the restraints of religion; for the rhapsodists [Footnote:  Rhapsodist, a term applied to the reciters of Greek verse.] were  dealing a death-blow (perhaps unconsciously) to the received  religious belief by these very pictures of sin and crime among  the gods. Their idea is a sort of semi-monarchical aristocracy,  where a number of persons have the power to help favorites, and  thwart the general progress of affairs; where love of faction  overpowers every other consideration, and justifies violence or  deceit. [Footnote: \"Social Life in Greece,\" by J. P. Mahaffy.]    MR. GLADSTONE has given us, in the following extract, his views  of what he calls the \"intense humanity\" of the Olympian system,  drawn from what its great expounder has set forth in the Iliad  and the Odyssey. \"That system,\" he says, \"exhibits a kind of royal  or palace life of man, but on the one hand more splendid and  powerful, on the other more intense and free. It is a wonderful  and a gorgeous creation. It is eminently in accordance with the  signification of the English epithet--rather a favorite, apparently,  with our old writers--the epithet jovial, which is derived from  the Latin name of its head. It is a life of all the pleasures of  mind and body, of banquet and of revel, of music and of song; a  life in which solemn grandeur alternates with jest and gibe; a  life of childish willfulness and of fretfulness, combined with  serious, manly, and imperial cares; for the Olympus of Homer has  at least this one recommendation to esteem--that it is not peopled  with the merely lazy and selfish gods of Epicurus, but its  inhabitants busily deliberate on the government of man, and in  their debates the cause of justice wins.    \"I do not now discuss the moral titles of the Olympian scheme;  what I dwell upon is its intense humanity, alike in its greatness  and its littleness, its glory and its shame. As the cares and  joys of human life, so the structure of society below is reflected,  by the wayward wit of man, on heaven above. Though the names and  fundamental traditions of the several deities were wholly or in  great part imported from abroad, their characters, relations, and  attributes passed under a Hellenizing process, which gradually  marked off for them special provinces and functions, according to  laws which appear to have been mainly original and indigenous,  and to have been taken by analogy from the division of labor in  political society. The Olympian society has its complement of  officers and servants, with their proper functions. He-phaes'tus  (or Vulcan) moulds the twenty golden thrones which move  automatically to form the circle of the council of the gods, and  builds for each of his brother deities a separate palace in the  deep-folded recesses of the mighty mountain. Music and song are  supplied by Apollo and the Muses; Gan-y-me'de and He'be are the  cup-bearers, Hermes and Iris are the messengers; but Themis, in  whom is impersonated the idea of deliberation and of relative  rights, is the summoner of the Great Assembly of the gods in the  Twentieth Iliad, when the great issue of the Trojan war is to be  determined.\" [Footnote: Address to the Edinburgh University,  November 3, 1865.]    But, however prone the gods were to evil passions, and subject  to human frailties, they were not believed to approve (in men)  of the vices in which they themselves indulged, but were, on  the contrary, supposed to punish violations of justice and  humanity, and to reward the brave and virtuous. We learn that  they were to be appeased by libations and sacrifice; and their  aid, not only in great undertakings, but in the common affairs  of life, was to be obtained by prayer and supplication. For  instance, in the Ninth Book of HOMER'S Iliad the aged  Phoe'nix--warrior and sage--in a beautiful allegory personifying  \"Offence\" and \"Prayers,\" represents the former as robust and fleet  of limb, outstripping the latter, and hence roaming over the earth  and doing immense injury to mankind; but the Prayers, following  after, intercede with Jupiter, and, if we avail ourselves of them,  repair the evil; but if we neglect them we are told that the  vengeance of the wrong shall overtake us. Thus, Phoenix says of  the gods,                         \"If a mortal man    Offend them by transgression of their laws,    Libation, incense, sacrifice, and prayer,    In meekness offered, turn their wrath away.                     Prayers are Jove's daughters,    Which,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#12)"],[1," wild animal, but he went his way gloomily  without paying attention to any one. He was accompanied by two  servants, one a negro, completely dressed in red satin, and the other  a Circassian in his full gleaming uniform. Suddenly he saw Wanda, and  fixed his cold piercing look upon her; he even turned his head after  her, and when she had passed, he stood still and followed her with  his eyes.    And she--she veritably devoured him with her radiant green eyes--and  did everything possible to meet him again.    The cunning coquetry with which she walked, moved, and looked at  him, almost stifled me. On the way home I remarked about it. She knit  her brows.    \"What do you want,\" she said, \"the prince is a man whom I might  like, who even dazzles me, and I am free. I can do what I please--\"    \"Don't you love me any longer--\" I stammered, frightened.    \"I love only you,\" she replied, \"but I shall have the prince pay  court to me.\"    \"Wanda!\"    \"Aren't you my slave?\" she said calmly. \"Am I not Venus, the cruel  northern Venus in Furs?\"    I was silent. I felt literally crushed by her words; her cold look  entered my heart like a dagger.    \"You will find out immediately the prince's name, residence, and  circumstances,\" she continued. \"Do you understand?\"    \"But--\"    \"No argument, obey!\" exclaimed Wanda, more sternly than I would have  thought possible for her, \"and don't dare to enter my sight until you  can answer my questions.\"    It was not till afternoon that I could obtain the desired  information for Wanda. She let me stand before her like a servant,  while she leaned back in her arm-chair and listened to me, smiling.  Then she nodded; she seemed to be satisfied.    \"Bring me my footstool,\" she commanded shortly.    I obeyed, and after having put it before her and having put her feet  on it, I remained kneeling.    \"How will this end?\" I asked sadly after a short pause.    She broke into playful laughter. \"Why things haven't even begun yet.\"    \"You are more heartless than I imagined,\" I replied, hurt.    \"Severin,\" Wanda began earnestly. \"I haven't done anything yet, not  the slightest thing, and you are already calling me heartless. What  will happen when I begin to carry your dreams to their realization,  when I shall lead a gay, free life and have a circle of admirers  about me, when I shall actually fulfil your ideal, tread you  underfoot and apply the lash?\"    \"You take my dreams too seriously.\"    \"Too seriously? I can't stop at make-believe, when once I begin,\"  she replied. \"You know I hate all play-acting and comedy. You have  wished it. Was it my idea or yours? Did I persuade you or did you  inflame my imagination? I am taking things seriously now.\"    \"Wanda,\" I replied, caressingly, \"listen quietly to me. We love each  other infinitely, we are very happy, will you sacrifice our entire  future to a whim?\"    \"It is no longer a whim,\" she exclaimed.    \"What is it?\" I asked frightened.    \"Something that was probably latent in me,\" she said quietly and  thoughtfully. \"Perhaps it would never have come to light, if you had  not called it to life, and made it grow. Now that it has become a  powerful impulse, fills my whole being, now that I enjoy it, now that  I cannot and do not want to do otherwise, now you want to back out--  you--are you a man?\"    \"Dear, sweet Wanda!\" I began to caress her, kiss her.    \"Don't--you are not a man--\"    \"And you,\" I flared up.    \"I am stubborn,\" she said, \"you know that. I haven't a strong  imagination, and like you I am weak in execution. But when I make up  my mind to do something, I carry it through, and the more certainly,  the more opposition I meet. Leave me alone!\"    She pushed me away, and got up.    \"Wanda!\" I likewise rose, and stood facing her.    \"Now you know what I am,\" she continued. \"Once more I warn you. You  still have the choice. I am not compelling you to be my slave.\"    \"Wanda,\" I replied with emotion and tears filling my eyes, \"don't  you know how I love you?\"    Her lips quivered contemptuously.    \"You are mistaken, you make yourself out worse than you are; you are  good and noble by nature--\"    \"What do you know about my nature,\" she interrupted vehemently, \"you  will get to know me as I am.\"    \"Wanda!\"    \"Decide, will you submit, unconditionally?\"    \"And if I say no.\"    \"Then--\"    She stepped close up to me, cold and contemptuous. As she stood  before me now, the arms folded across her breast, with an evil smile  about her lips, she was in fact the despotic woman of my dreams. Her  expression seemed hard, and nothing lay in her eyes that promised  kindness or mercy.    \"Well--\" she said at last.    \"You are angry,\" I cried, \"you will punish me.\"    \"Oh no!\" she replied, \"I shall let you go. You are free. I am not  holding you.\"    \"Wanda--I, who love you so--\"    \"Yes, you, my dear sir, you who adore me,\" she exclaimed  contemptuously, \"but who are a coward, a liar, and a breaker of  promises. Leave me instantly--\"    \"Wanda I--\"    \"Wretch!\"    My blood rose in my heart. I threw myself down at her feet and began  to cry.    \"Tears, too!\" She began to laugh. Oh, this laughter was frightful.  \"Leave me--I don't want to see you again.\"    \"Oh my God!\" I cried, beside myself. \"I will do whatever you  command, be your slave, a mere object with which you can do what you  will--only don't send me away--I can't bear it--I cannot live without  you.\" I embraced her knees, and covered her hand with kisses.    \"Yes, you must be a slave, and feel the lash, for you are not a  man,\" she said calmly. She said this to me with perfect composure,  not angrily, not even excitedly, and it was what hurt most. \"Now I  know you, your dog-like nature, that adores where it is kicked, and  the more, the more it is maltreated. Now I know you, and now you  shall come to know me.\"    She walked up and down with long strides, while I remained crushed  on my knees; my head was hanging supine, tears flowed from my eyes.    \"Come here,\" Wanda commanded harshly, sitting down on the ottoman.  I obeyed her command, and sat down beside her. She looked at me  sombrely, and then a light suddenly seemed to illuminate the interior  of her eye. Smiling, she drew me toward her breast, and began to kiss  the tears out of my eyes.           *       *       *       *       *    The odd part of my situation is that I am like the bear in Lily's  park. I can escape and don't want to; I am ready to endure everything  as soon as she threatens to set me free.           *       *       *       *       *    If only she would use the whip again. There is something uncanny in  the kindness with which she treats me. I seem like a little captive  mouse with which a beautiful cat prettily plays. She is ready at any  moment to tear it to pieces, and my heart of a mouse threatens to  burst.    What are her intentions? What does she purpose to do with me?           *       *       *       *       *    It seems she has completely forgotten the contract, my slavehood. Or  was it actually only stubbornness? And she gave up her whole plan as  soon as I no longer opposed her and submitted to her imperial whim?    How kind she is to me, how tender, how loving! We are spending  marvellously happy days.    To-day she had me read to her the scene between Faust and  Mephistopheles, in which the latter appears as a wandering scholar.  Her glance hung on me with strange pleasure.    \"I don't understand,\" she said when I had finished, \"how a man who  can read such great and beautiful thoughts with such expression, and  interpret them so clearly, concisely, and intelligently, can at the  same time be such a visionary and supersensual ninny as you are.\"    \"Were you pleased,\" said I, and kissed her forehead.    She gently stroked my brow. \"I love you, Severin,\" she whispered. \"I  don't believe I could ever love any one more than you. Let us be  sensible, what do you say?\"    Instead of replying I folded her in my arms; a deep inward, yet  vaguely sad happiness filled my breast, my eyes grew moist, and a  tear fell upon her hand.    \"How can you cry!\" she exclaimed, \"you are a child!\"           *       *       *       *       *    On a pleasure drive we met the Russian prince in his carriage. He  seemed to be unpleasantly surprised to see me by Wanda's side, and  looked as if he wanted to pierce her through and through with his  electric gray eyes. She, however, did not seem to notice him. I felt  at that moment like kneeling down before her and kissing her feet.  She let her glance glide over him indifferently as though he were an  inanimate object, a tree, for instance, and turned to me with her  gracious smile.           *       *       *       *       *    When I said good-night to her to-day she seemed suddenly  unaccountably distracted and moody. What was occupying her?    \"I am sorry you are going,\" she said when I was already standing on  the threshold.    \"It is entirely in your hands to shorten the hard period of my  trial, to cease tormenting me--\" I pleaded.    \"Do you imagine that this compulsion isn't a torment for me, too,\"  Wanda interjected.    \"Then end it,\" I exclaimed, embracing her, \"be my wife.\"    \"_Never, Severin_,\" she said gently, but with great firmness.    \"What do you mean?\"    I was frightened in my innermost soul.    \"_You are not the man for me._\"    I looked at her, and slowly withdrew my arm which was still about  her waist; then I left the room, and she--she did not call me back.           *       *       *       *       *    A sleepless night; I made countless decisions, only to toss them  aside again. In the morning I wrote her a letter in which I declared  our relationship dissolved. My hand trembled when I put on the seal,  and I burned my fingers.    As I went upstairs to hand it to the maid, my knees threatened to  give way.    The door opened, and Wanda thrust forth her head full of curling-papers.    \"I haven't had my hair dressed yet,\" she said,"]]]
