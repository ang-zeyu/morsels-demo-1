I never wear rubber boots to wade in. An old pair of heavy-soled shoes  with spikes in their bottoms, and small slits cut in the sides to let  the water in and out, and a pair of heavy woolen socks comprise my  wading footwear. The slits must not be large enough to let in coarse  sand and pebbles, but I find it absolutely necessary to have a slight  opening, for if there be no means for the water to run freely in and  out, the shoes fill from the tops and become heavy. Rubber boots are  too hot for my feet and legs, while the water is never too cold. I  have often had wet feet all day, and have never yet experienced any  ill effects from it.    I never use a staff in wading, but I should, for here in some places  it is very hard to wade. I have often fallen down in water up to my  waist, overbalanced by the heavy current, where the bottoms were  rough, with sharp, slimy stones. If you carry a staff, follow the  custom of the old Anglers and tie it to your body with a string to  keep it out of the way and allow your hands to be as free as possible  for a strike. Your landing-net should be a small one, minus any metal,  with a foot and a half handle, and a string tied to a front button on  your garment should allow it to be slung over your shoulder onto your  back when not in use.    Of course, these little points about the use of different things are  all familiar to the Angler with but the slightest experience, and will  appear to him neither instructive nor interesting, but we must, as  gentle Anglers, give a thought or two to the earnest tyro, for we were  young once ourselves.    I always carry two fly-books with me; one big fellow with the general  fly stock in, which is kept at the farmhouse, and a little one holding  two dozen flies and a dozen leaders, which I carry on the stream. A  string tied to this, too, will prevent the unpleasantness of having it  fall in the water and glide away from you. I even tie a string to my  pipe and knife. The outing hat is an important thing to me. Mine is  always a soft brown or gray felt, and I use it to sit on in damp and  hard places fifty times a day.          CHAPTER X    TROUTING IN CANADENSIS VALLEY      The Canadensis Valley in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, is a  _fontinalis_ paradise. With my friend George Blake I creeled the  little heroes by the dozen every day for a week. We each could have  easily caught fifty in an afternoon had we cared to do so, but there  were other rural pleasures to attend to, and we were not dealing in  fish, and saw more beauty in just enough to eat than in wasteful  quantity. Fishermen are generally known as exaggerators, and I do not  deny that they do sometimes resort to an innocent little fib when a  yarn may amuse many and injure no one, but I must say that this  region's beauties are too numerous to overpraise by all the  exaggeration of all the fabricators in the world. No word of mouth or  pen could do justice to nature in these mountains. And I need not  elaborate on the fish; the truth is bold enough.    Brook trout weighing a quarter of a pound to a pound and a half are  taken every day by Anglers, who more than fill their creels. Two  gentlemen took in one day sixty-five beauties on the stream known as  Stony Run, and two Philadelphia Anglers took half a hundred the day  before above the Buckhill Falls. Another great stream in this region  is the Bushkill, and still another is Brodhead's Creek. The latter  flows past our camp, and is famous for big trout. My favorite is  Spruce Cabin Stream, above and below the beautiful Spruce Cabin Falls.  There are big trout in this water, especially at the bottom of the  falls, and I can--if I will--take fifty trout in an afternoon, and  they'll weigh from a quarter of a pound to one pound and a half. I  like something besides fish about a stream, and this is why I am fond  of the Spruce Cabin water.    There are not many Anglers in love with the place. Though beautiful,  it is very hard to fish. I have to creep under great trees that have  fallen over the water and then wade up to my waist to gain certain  points in order to get along down the stream. The banks are lined with  trees and shrubbery, and my line is ever getting tangled. One does not  need to be a fly-casting tournament Angler to fish any of the  Canadensis waters. Distance in the cast is not required as much as  accuracy at more than one or two places on each stream. The rest of  the fishing is done by short, low casts, and by creeping under  branches and letting the line float with the ripples into the eddies.  Every step or two there are little falls, and in the white, bubbling  water at their bottom a trout may be taken. Under the big fall, and in  the still waters above and below, the big trout hide.    Artificial flies are the popular bait with the gentle Angler, though  all sizes of trout will take worms, and the big, educated trout like  minnows. Both small, medium, and large trout like flies if the flies  are the right kind. We have had great trouble in getting good flies. I  brought four dozen with me, and not over a half dozen of them are  worth the snell tied to them; they are too clumsy in size, of coarse  material, and bad in color. The six decent ones are the work of an  artist. I could give his name, but it might look like an advertisement  and spoil my story. Trout like choice food just as much as human  beings favor savory dishes. You may stick an oyster shell on a reed,  and decoy a summer yellowleg, but you can't hook a trout on any kind  of a fly. They know a thing or two.    Tyros who angle in a trout country without success go home and say  there are no trout. They don't think about conditions of water and  weather; about their line lighting in the water before their bait;  about their coarse line and poor flies.    Trout are philosophers, not only the educated ones, those which have  been hooked and seen others hooked, but trout in general. They're born  that way. A young man came up here the other day with an old cane  pole, weighing fully three pounds, and a big salt water sinker, and he  went away saying there were few trout in these waters. I think he had  a float with him, too, but am not sure.    A word or two about appropriate tackle for mountain streams, and I'll  put up the pen and joint the rod again. In the city a few weeks ago I  proudly displayed a four-ounce, nine-foot lancewood rod, and my  friends laughed at me, saying it was too frail for any service. Now, I  find this rod, shortened two feet, just the thing for this country  where trout run small and where there's no long casting. I frequently  run across good Anglers here with five-ounce rods, and have seen two  four-ounce rods. There is no use for a rod above four ounces in weight  and seven feet in length. When I come again I shall use a three-ounce  rod. The reel should be the lightest and smallest common click, and  the line the finest enameled silk,tapered if you like. The  flies--here's the main thing--should be the best, and of the smallest  brook trout pattern. Next year, when I make up my supply, I'll pack  fully two hundred, and they'll be the dearest-priced flies, for they  are none too good.    [Illustration: THE TROUT BROOK]    Oh, I must say a word about cooking and eating trout before I close.  I've tried them in all styles, and the best way, I think, is when  they're roasted over a camp fire on a little crotch stick, one prong  in the head and the other in the tail. And the worst way, I think, is  when they're fried in a pan with bad butter or poor lard.    Blake and I are in our glory. Our only displeasure is in knowing that  our perspiring city friends are not as comfortable. The days here are  warm and bright--not hot and close--and the nights cool and clear, so  that we live merrily all the time.    I went a few hundred yards down the stream in front of the camp to two  great bowlders, one morning, and there, during a little sun shower,  took a _Salvelinus fontinalis_ that weighed just a little over two  pounds and a quarter. He rose to a pinkish, cream-colored fly, with  little brown spots on the wings. I forget its name, but it's one of  the six really good ones I referred to. I decided to keep the large  captive alive, so I took off one of the cords tied about my trousers  at the bottoms (I never wear wading boots in warm weather), put it  through his gill, and tied the other end to a submerged tree-root.  Later, Mr. Trout was lodged in a small box, with bars tacked over the  top, and placed under a spout running from an old mill race. He was a  big specimen--large enough to saddle and ride to town, the cook said.  And pretty--as pretty as a gathering of lilacs and giant ferns decked  with wintergreen berries.          CHAPTER XI    THE TROUTER'S OUTFIT      The rod for stream fishing should weigh from three to six ounces and  measure in length from seven to nine feet. Split bamboo and lancewood  are two of the best rod materials. If you cannot afford a good split  bamboo do not buy a cheap one; choose a lancewood.    The line should be a small-sized waterproofed silk one. The reel, a  small common light rubber click, holding twenty-five or thirty-five  yards.    The landing net, used to take the fish from the water after being  hooked, should be made of cane with linen netting, and have no metal  about it. The handle should be about a foot long. Tie a string to the  handle, tie the string to a button on your coat under your chin, and  then toss the net over your back out of the way.    The creel, or fish basket, should be a willow one about the size of a  small hand satchel. This should have a leather strap, to be slung over  the right shoulder, allowing the creel to rest on the left hip.    The hat should be a soft brown or gray felt with two-inch brim.

After all the experiments, and all that has been written upon the  subject, we are confident that the direction of a balloon is quite  impossible, except by a process which we have never yet seen suggested;  that is, by the rapid decomposition of the air in its way, so that a  tube extended in the direction in which it is desired to move, shall  open continually a vacuum into which the pressure of the common  atmosphere shall impel the carriage.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Journal des Debats_ announces for publication two works from the  pen of Guizot. The hero of the first is General Monk. Its title is _The  Downfall of the Republic in England in 1660, and the Reestablishment of  the Monarchy: A Historic Study_. It may be regarded as new, though part  has been published before in the form of articles in the _Revue  Francaise_. These articles appeared in 1837. M. Guizot has carefully  revised them, and added a great deal of new matter. The work is also to  be enriched with a number of curious documents never before published,  such as a letter from Richard Cromwell to General Monk, and seventy  dispatches from M. de Bordeaux, then French Ambassador at London, to  Cardinal Mazarin. These dispatches have been found in the archives of  the Foreign Office at Paris. The work has a new preface, which the  _Debats_ says will prove to be no less important in a political than a  historical point of view. The second book is that so well known in this  country upon Washington. We do not understand that anything new is added  to it. It was in the first place issued as the introduction of the  translation into French of Sparks's _Life of Washington_, which the  French journalist says is the most exact and complete work yet published  on the war of independence and the foundation of the United States.  \"Monk and Washington,\" adds the _Debats_: \"on the one side a republic  falling and a monarchy rising again into existence, on the other a  monarchy giving birth to a republic; and M. Guizot, formerly the prime  minister of our monarchy, now amid the perplexities of our own republic  the historian of these two great men and these two great events! Were  contrasts ever seen more striking, and more likely to excite a powerful  interest?\"    This is very well for the _Debats_. But the omissions by Mr.  Sparks--sometimes from carelessness, sometimes from ignorance, and  sometimes from an indisposition to revive memories of old feuds, or to  cover with disgrace names which should be dishonored; and his occasional  verbal alterations of Washington's letters prevent that general  satisfaction with which his edition of Washington would otherwise be  regarded. We are soon to have histories of the Revolution, from both  Sparks and Bancroft, in proper form. The best documentary history is  not, as the _Debats_ fancies, this collection of Washington's letters,  but Mr. Force's \"Archives,\"--of which, with its usual want of sagacity  or regard for duty, Congress is publishing but one tenth of the edition  necessary, since every statesman in our own country, and every writer on  American history at home or abroad, needs a copy of it, and from its  extent and costliness it will never be reprinted.           *       *       *       *       *    The Rabbi Cahen has published at Paris the Book of Job, which concludes  his learned version of the Hebrew Bible.           *       *       *       *       *    Works on the German Revolution and German Politics.--An excellent book  on the Prussian revolution is now being published at Oldenburg. It is  from the pen of Adolf Stahr, a writer of remarkable force and clearness.  He belongs to the party most bitterly disappointed by the turn affairs  have taken in Germany. We mean the democratic monarchists, who labored  under the illusion that they might see Prussia converted into a sort of  republic with a hereditary chief, like Belgium. They desired a monarchy,  with a parliament elected by universal suffrage, and democratic  institutions of every kind. Stahr's book breathes all the bitterness of  their rage at the success of absolutism in snatching from them every  slightest vestige of hope. His book is published serially, four parts  having already been issued. As a record of facts it deserves the praise  of great industry and lucidity in collection and arrangement, while on  every page there glows in suppressed eloquence the indignation of a  generous and manly heart. Of course Stahr cannot be called a historian  in the usual sense of the term. He is rather a political pamphleteer,  maintaining at length the ideas and chastising the foes of his party.    Another and a more permanently valuable work on this subject is the  _Revolutions-Chronik_ (Revolutionary Chronicle) of Dr. Adolf Wolff,  published by Hempel of Berlin. This is a collection of authentic  documents, such as proclamations, placards, letters, legislative acts,  &c., connected with the revolution. They are not only arranged in due  order, but are combined with a clear and succinct narrative of the  events and circumstances to which they relate. We know of no man more  competent than Dr. Wolff to the successful execution of so important an  undertaking. Without being a partisan, his sympathies are decidedly on  the popular side, and the clearness of his judgment cannot be blinded by  any of the feints and stratagems in which the period abounded. He is now  engaged upon the revolution in Prussia, but intends to treat all the  manifestations of the time throughout Germany in the same thorough and  reliable manner. His work will be invaluable to future historians of  this eventful period; at the same time it reads like a romance, not only  from the nature of the events, but from the spirit and keenness of the  style.    Two other striking contributions to the history of this stormy epoch  have been made by Bruno Bauer, the well known rationalist. Bauer treats  the political and religious parties of modern Germany with the same  scornful satire and destructive analysis which appear in his theological  writings. He delights in pitting one side against the other and making  them consume each other. His first book is called the _Buergerliche  Revolution in Deutschland_, (the Burghers' Revolution in Germany); it  was published above a year ago, and attracted a great deal of attention  from the fact that it took neither side, but with a sort of  Mephistophelian superiority, showed that every party had been alike  weak, timid, hesitating, short-sighted, and useless. The New-Catholics  of Ronge's school were especially treated with unsparing severity. Bauer  has now just brought out his second book, which is particularly devoted  to the Frankfort Parliament. In this also the Hegelian Logic is applied  with the same result. The author proves that all that was done in that  body was worth nothing and produced nothing. There is not a particle of  sympathetic feeling in the whole book; but only cold and contemptuous  analysis. It has not made very much of an impression in Germany. Both  these works, and, indeed, the whole school of ultra-Hegelian skeptics  generally, are a singular reaction upon the usual warmth and  sentimentality of German character and literature. They are the very  opposite extreme, and so a very natural product of the times. For our  part we like them quite as well as the other side of the contrast.           *       *       *       *       *    Germany is the richest of all countries in historical literature.  Nowhere have all the events of human experience been so variously,  profoundly, or industriously investigated. Ancient history especially  has been most exhaustively treated by the Germans. One of the best and  most comprehensive works in this category is that of Dr. Zimmer, the  seventh edition of which, revised and enlarged, has just been published  at Leipzic. Dr. Zimmer does not proceed upon the hypotheses of Niebuhr  and others, but conceives that the writing of history and romance ought  to be essentially different. The whole work is in one volume of some 450  pages, and of course greatly condensed. It discusses the history of  India, China, and Japan; the western Asiatic States, Assyria, Babylonia,  Syria, Phoenicia, India, down to the fall of Jerusalem; the other  parts of Asia; Egypt to the battle of Actium, with a dissertation on  Egyptian culture; Carthage; Greece to the fall of Corinth; Rome under  the emperors down to the year 476; and concludes with an account of the  literature of classical antiquity.    As we have no manual of this sort in English, that is written up to the  latest results of scholarship, we hope to see some American undertaking  a version of Dr. Zimmer's book. There is considerable learning and  talent in the two octavos on the same subject by Dr. Hebbe, and  published last year by Dewitt & Davenport; but we strongly dislike some  of the doctrines of the work, which are _not_ derived from a thorough  study.           *       *       *       *       *    The seventh volume of Professor Schlosser's History of the Eighteenth  Century, and of the Nineteenth till the overthrow of the French Empire,  appeared, in translation, in London, on the first of November. Volume  eighth, completing the work, with a copious index, is preparing for  early publication.           *       *       *       *       *    The Discovery of a lost MS. of Jean Le Bel is mentioned in the Paris  papers, as having been made by M.

It is on the eve of publication, and will be comprised in an octavo  volume, in black letter. This work was supposed to be irretrievably  lost. It was found by M. Polain, transcribed and incorporated into a  prose _Chronicle de Liege_, by Jean des Pres, dit _d'Ontremeuse_. It  comprises a period between 1325 and 1340, which are embraced in one  hundred and"]]]
