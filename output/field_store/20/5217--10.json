By Jove, that reminds me.' He felt in  his pocket for the pill-boxes. Could they have survived the stormy  times through which they had been passing? He heaved a sigh of relief  as he saw that the eggs were uninjured. He was so intent on examining  them that he missed the stranger's next remark.    'Sorry. What? I didn't hear.'    'Asked if I was going right for St Austin's School.'    'College!' said Barrett with a convulsive shudder. The most deadly  error mortal man can make, with the exception of calling a school a  college, is to call a college a school.    'College!' said the man. 'Is this the road?'    'Yes. You can't miss it. I'm going there myself. It's only about a  mile.'    'Ah,' said the man, with a touch of satisfaction in his voice. 'Going  there yourself, are you? Perhaps you're one of the scholars?'    'Not much,' said Barrett, 'ask our form-beak if I'm a scholar. Oh. I  see. Yes, I'm there all right.'    Barrett was a little puzzled as to how to class his companion. No old  public school man would talk of scholars. And yet he was emphatically  not a bargee. Barrett set him down as a sort of superior tourist, a  Henry as opposed to an 'Arry.    'Been bit of a disturbance there, hasn't there? Cricket pavilion.  Cups.'    'Rather. But how on earth--'    'How on earth did I get to hear of it, you were going to say. Well, no  need to conceal anything. Fact is, down here to look into the matter.  Detective. Name, Roberts, Scotland Yard. Now we know each other, and if  you can tell me one or two things about this burglary, it would be a  great help to me, and I should be very much obliged.'    Barrett had heard that a detective was coming down to look into the  affair of the cups. His position was rather a difficult one. In a sense  it was simple enough. He had found the cups. He could (keepers  permitting) go and fetch them now, and there would--No. There would  _not_ be an end of the matter. It would be very pleasant,  exceedingly pleasant, to go to the Headmaster and the detective, and  present the cups to them with a 'Bless you, my children' air. The  Headmaster would say, 'Barrett, you're a marvel. How can I thank you  sufficiently?' while the detective would observe that he had been in  the profession over twenty years, but never had he seen so remarkable  an exhibition of sagacity and acumen as this. That, at least, was what  ought to take place. But Barrett's experience of life, short as it was,  had taught him the difference between the ideal and the real. The real,  he suspected, would in this case be painful. Certain facts would come  to light. When had he found the cups? About four in the afternoon? Oh.  Roll-call took place at four in the afternoon. How came it that he was  not at roll-call? Furthermore, how came it that he was marked on the  list as having answered his name at that ceremony? Where had he found  the cups? In a hollow tree? Just so. Where was the hollow tree? In Sir  Alfred Venner's woods. Did he know that Sir Alfred Venner's woods were  out of bounds? Did he know that, in consequence of complaints from Sir  Alfred Venner, Sir Alfred Venner's woods were more out of bounds than  any other out of bounds woods in the entire county that did _not_  belong to Sir Alfred Venner? He did? Ah! No, the word for his guidance  in this emergency, he felt instinctively, was 'mum'. Time might provide  him with a solution. He might, for instance, abstract the cups secretly  from their resting-place, place them in the middle of the football  field, and find them there dramatically after morning school. Or he  might reveal his secret from the carriage window as his train moved out  of the station on the first day of the holidays. There was certain to  be some way out of the difficulty. But for the present, silence.    He answered his companion's questions freely, however. Of the actual  burglary he knew no more than any other member of the School,  considerably less, indeed, than Jim Thomson, of Merevale's, at present  staggering under the weight of a secret even more gigantic than  Barrett's own. In return for his information he extracted sundry  reminiscences. The scar on the detective's cheekbone, barely visible  now, was the mark of a bullet, which a certain burglar, named,  singularly enough, Roberts, had fired at him from a distance of five  yards. The gentleman in question, who, the detective hastened to inform  Barrett, was no relation of his, though owning the same name, happened  to be a poor marksman and only scored a bad outer, assuming the  detective's face to have been the bull. He also turned up his cuff to  show a larger scar. This was another testimonial from the burglar  world. A Kensington practitioner had had the bad taste to bite off a  piece of that part of the detective. In short, Barrett enlarged his  knowledge of the seamy side of things considerably in the mile of road  which had to be traversed before St Austin's appeared in sight. The two  parted at the big gates, Barrett going in the direction of Philpott's,  the detective wheeling his machine towards the porter's lodge.    Barrett's condition when he turned in at Philpott's door was critical.  He was so inflated with news that any attempt to keep it in might have  serious results. Certainly he could not sleep that night in such a  bomb-like state.    It was thus that he broke in upon Reade. Reade had passed an absurdly  useless afternoon. He had not stirred from the study. For all that it  would have mattered to him, it might have been raining hard the whole  afternoon, instead of being, as it had been, the finest afternoon of  the whole term. In a word, and not to put too fine a point on the  matter, he had been frousting, and consequently was feeling dull and  sleepy, and generally under-vitalized and futile. Barrett entered the  study with a rush, and was carried away by excitement to such an extent  that he addressed Reade as if the deadly feud between them not only did  not exist, but never had existed.    'I say, Reade. Heave that beastly book away. My aunt, I have had an  afternoon of it.'    'Oh?' said Reade, politely, 'where did you go?'    'After eggs in the Dingle.'    Reade was fairly startled out of his dignified reserve. For the first  time since they had had their little difference, he addressed Barrett  in a sensible manner.    'You idiot!' he said.    'Don't see it. The Dingle's just the place to spend a happy day. Like  Rosherville. Jove, it's worth going there. You should see the birds.  Place is black with 'em.'    'How about keepers? See any?'    'Did I not! Three of them chased me like good 'uns all over the place.'    'You got away all right, though.'    'Only just. I say, do you know what happened? You know that rotter  Plunkett. Used to be a day boy. Head of Ward's now. Wears specs.'    'Yes?'    'Well, just as I was almost out of the wood, I jumped a bush and landed  right on top of him. The man was asleep or something. Fancy choosing  the Dingle of all places to sleep in, where you can't go a couple of  yards without running into a keeper! He hadn't even the sense to run. I  yelled to him to look out, and then I hooked it myself. And then the  nearest keeper, who'd just come down a buster over a rabbit-hole,  sailed in and had him. I couldn't do anything, of course.'    'Jove, there'll be a fair-sized row about this. The Old Man's on to  trespassing like tar. I say, think Plunkett'll say anything about you  being there too?'    'Shouldn't think so. For one thing I don't think he recognized me.  Probably doesn't know me by sight, and he was fast asleep, too. No, I  fancy I'm all right.'    'Well, it was a jolly narrow shave. Anything else happen?'    'Anything else! Just a bit. That's to say, no, nothing much else. No.'    'Now then,' said Reade, briskly. 'None of your beastly mysteries. Out  with it.'    'Look here, swear you'll keep it dark?'    'Of course I will.'    'On your word of honour?'    'If you think--' began Reade in an offended voice.    'No, it's all right. Don't get shirty. The thing is, though, it's so  frightfully important to keep it dark.'    'Well? Buck up.'    'Well, you needn't believe me, of course, but I've found the pots.'    Reade gasped.    'What!' he cried. 'The pot for the quarter?'    'And the one for the hundred yards. Both of them. It's a fact.'    'But where? How? What have you done with them?'    Barrett unfolded his tale concisely.    'You see,' he concluded, 'what a hole I'm in. I can't tell the Old Man  anything about it, or I get booked for cutting roll-call, and going out  of bounds. And then, while I'm waiting and wondering what to do, and  all that, the thief, whoever he is, will most likely go off with the  pots. What do you think I ought to do?'    Reade perpended.    'Well,' he said, 'all you can do is to lie low and trust to luck, as  far as I can see. Besides, there's one consolation. This Plunkett  business'll make every keeper in the Dingle twice as keen after  trespassers. So the pot man won't get a chance of getting the things  away.'    'Yes, there's something in that,' admitted Barrett.    'It's all you can do,' said Reade.    'Yes. Unless I wrote an anonymous letter to the Old Man explaining  things. How would that do?'    'Do for you, probably. Anonymous letters always get traced to the  person who wrote them. Or pretty nearly always. No, you simply lie  low.'    'Right,' said Barrett, 'I will.'    The process of concealing one's superior knowledge is very irritating.  So irritating, indeed, that very few people do it. Barrett, however,  was obliged to by necessity. He had a good chance of displaying his  abilities in that direction when he met Grey the next morning.    'Hullo,' said Grey, 'have a good time yesterday?'    'Not bad. I've got an egg for you.'    'Good man. What sort?'    'Hanged if I know."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6985"],[0,"A Prefect's Uncle (#12)"],[1," Dash it! What? I can't underst--. Most curious thing I  ever--dash it all, you know.'    He drifted off in the direction of the Pavilion, stopping on the way to  ask short leg his opinion of the matter.    'Bowled, Sammy,' said Reece, putting on the bails.    'Well bowled, Gosling,' growled Norris from the slips.    'Sammy the marvel, by Jove,' said Marriott. 'Switch it on, Samuel, more  and more.'    'I wish Norris would give me a rest. Where on earth is that man  Gethryn?'    'Rum, isn't it? There's going to be something of a row about it. Norris  seems to be getting rather shirty. Hullo! here comes the Deathless  Author.'    The author referred to was the new batsman, a distinguished novelist,  who played a good deal for the M.C.C. He broke his journey to the  wicket to speak to the conversationalist, who was still engaged with  short leg.    'Bates, old man,' he said, 'if you're going to the Pavilion you might  wait for me. I shall be out in an hour or two.'    Upon which Bates, awaking suddenly to the position of affairs, went on  his way.    With the arrival of the Deathless Author an unwelcome change came over  the game. His cricket style resembled his literary style. Both were  straightforward and vigorous. The first two balls he received from  Gosling he drove hard past cover point to the ropes. Gosling, who had  been bowling unchanged since the innings began, was naturally feeling a  little tired. He was losing his length, and bowling more slowly than  was his wont. Norris now gave him a rest for a few overs, Bruce going  on with rather innocuous medium left-hand bowling. The professional  continued to jog along slowly. The novelist hit. Everything seemed to  come alike to him. Gosling resumed, but without effect, while at the  other end bowler after bowler was tried. From a hundred and ten the  score rose and rose, and still the two remained together. A hundred and  ninety went up, and Norris in despair threw the ball to Marriott.    'Here you are, Marriott,' he said, 'I'm afraid we shall have to try  you.'    'That's what I call really nicely expressed,' said Marriott to the  umpire. 'Yes, over the wicket.'    Marriott was a slow, 'House-match' sort of bowler. That is to say, in a  House match he was quite likely to get wickets, but in a First Eleven  match such an event was highly improbable. His bowling looked very  subtle, and if the ball was allowed to touch the ground it occasionally  broke quite a remarkable distance.    The forlorn hope succeeded. The professional for the first time in his  innings took a risk. He slashed at a very mild ball almost a wide on  the off side. The ball touched the corner of the bat, and soared up in  the direction of cover-point, where Pringle held it comfortably.    'There you are,' said Marriott, 'when you put a really scientific  bowler on you're bound to get a wicket. Why on earth didn't I go on  before, Norris?'    'You wait,' said Norris, 'there are five more balls of the over to  come.'    'Bad job for the batsman,' said Marriott.    There had been time for a run before the ball reached Pringle, so that  the novelist was now at the batting end. Marriott's next ball was not  unlike his first, but it was straighter, and consequently easier to get  at. The novelist hit it into the road. When it had been brought back he  hit it into the road again. Marriott suggested that he had better have  a man there.    The fourth ball of the over was too wide to hit with any comfort, and  the batsman let it alone. The fifth went for four to square leg, almost  killing the umpire on its way, and the sixth soared in the old familiar  manner into the road again. Marriott's over had yielded exactly  twenty-two runs. Four to win and two wickets to fall.    'I'll never read another of that man's books as long as I live,' said  Marriott to Gosling, giving him the ball. 'You're our only hope, Sammy.  Do go in and win.'    The new batsman had the bowling. He snicked his first ball for a  single, bringing the novelist to the fore again, and Samuel Wilberforce  Gosling vowed a vow that he would dismiss that distinguished novelist.    But the best intentions go for nothing when one's arm is feeling like  lead. Of all the miserable balls sent down that afternoon that one of  Gosling's was the worst. It was worse than anything of Marriott's. It  flew sluggishly down the pitch well outside the leg stump. The novelist  watched it come, and his eye gleamed. It was about to bounce for the  second time when, with a pleased smile, the batsman stepped out. There  was a loud, musical report, the note of a bat when it strikes the ball  fairly on the driving spot.    The man of letters shaded his eyes with his hand, and watched the ball  diminish in the distance.    'I rather think,' said he cheerfully, as a crash of glass told of its  arrival at the Pavilion, 'that that does it.'    He was perfectly right. It did.          [9]    THE BISHOP FINISHES HIS RIDE      Gethryn had started on his ride handicapped by two things. He did not  know his way after the first two miles, and the hedges at the roadside  had just been clipped, leaving the roads covered with small thorns.    It was the former of these circumstances that first made itself  apparent. For two miles the road ran straight, but after that it was  unexplored country. The Bishop, being in both cricket and football  teams, had few opportunities for cycling. He always brought his machine  to School, but he very seldom used it.    At the beginning of the unexplored country, an irresponsible person  recommended him to go straight on. He couldn't miss the road, said he.  It was straight all the way. Gethryn thanked him, rode on, and having  gone a mile came upon three roads, each of which might quite well have  been considered a continuation of the road on which he was already. One  curved gently off to the right, the other two equally gently to the  left. He dismounted and the feelings of gratitude which he had borne  towards his informant for his lucid directions vanished suddenly. He  gazed searchingly at the three roads, but to single out one of them as  straighter than the other two was a task that baffled him completely. A  sign-post informed him of three things. By following road one he might  get to Brindleham, and ultimately, if he persevered, to Corden. Road  number two would lead him to Old Inns, whatever they might be, with the  further inducement of Little Benbury, while if he cast in his lot with  road three he might hope sooner or later to arrive at Much  Middlefold-on-the-Hill, and Lesser Middlefold-in-the-Vale. But on the  subject of Anfield and Anfield Junction the board was silent.    Two courses lay open to him. Should he select a route at random, or  wait for somebody to come and direct him? He waited. He went on  waiting. He waited a considerable time, and at last, just as he was  about to trust to luck, and make for Much Middlefold-on-the-Hill, a  figure loomed in sight, a slow-moving man, who strolled down the Old  Inns road at a pace which seemed to argue that he had plenty of time on  his hands.    'I say, can you tell me the way to Anfield, please?' said the Bishop as  he came up.    The man stopped, apparently rooted to the spot. He surveyed the Bishop  with a glassy but determined stare from head to foot. Then he looked  earnestly at the bicycle, and finally, in perfect silence, began to  inspect the Bishop again.    'Eh?' he said at length.    'Can you tell me the way to Anfield?'    'Anfield?'    'Yes. How do I get there?'    The man perpended, and when he replied did so after the style of the  late and great Ollendorf.    'Old Inns,' he said dreamily, waving a hand down the road by which he  had come, 'be over there.'    'Yes, yes, I know,' said Gethryn.    'Was born at Old Inns, I was,' continued the man, warming to his  subject. 'Lived there fifty-five years, I have. Yeou go straight down  the road an' yeou cam t' Old Inns. Yes, that be the way t' Old Inns.'    Gethryn nobly refrained from rending the speaker limb from limb.    'I don't want to know the way to Old Inns,' he said desperately. 'Where  I want to get is Anfield. Anfield, you know. Which way do I go?'    'Anfield?' said the man. Then a brilliant flash of intelligence  illumined his countenance. 'Whoy, Anfield be same road as Old Inns.  Yeou go straight down the road, an'--'    'Thanks very much,' said Gethryn, and without waiting for further  revelations shot off in the direction indicated. A quarter of a mile  farther he looked over his shoulder. The man was still there, gazing  after him in a kind of trance.    The Bishop passed through Old Inns with some way on his machine. He had  much lost time to make up. A signpost bearing the legend 'Anfield four  miles' told him that he was nearing his destination. The notice had  changed to three miles and again to two, when suddenly he felt that  jarring sensation which every cyclist knows. His back tyre was  punctured. It was impossible to ride on. He got off and walked. He was  still in his cricket clothes, and the fact that he had on spiked boots  did not make walking any the easier. His progress was not rapid.    Half an hour before his one wish had been to catch sight of a  fellow-being. Now, when he would have preferred to have avoided his  species, men seemed to spring up from nowhere, and every man of them  had a remark to make or a question to ask about the punctured tyre.  Reserve is not the leading characteristic of the average yokel.    Gethryn, however, refused to be drawn into conversation on the subject.  At last one, more determined than the rest, brought him to bay.    'Hoy, mister, stop,' called a voice. Gethryn turned. A man was running  up the road towards him.    He arrived panting.    'What's up?' said the Bishop.    'You've got a puncture,' said the man, pointing an accusing finger at  the flattened tyre.    It was not worth while killing the brute. Probably he was acting from "]]]
