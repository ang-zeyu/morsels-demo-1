[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5173"],[0,"The Religion of the Samurai (#12)"],[1,"are not merely  unique in the history of Japan, but perhaps in the history of man.  The tragic tale about his parting with his beloved son, and his  bravery shown at his last battle, never fail to inspire the Japanese  with heroism.  He is the best specimen of the Samurai class.  According to an old document,[FN#91] this Masa-shige was the  practiser of Zen, and just before his last battle he called on Chu  Tsun (So-shun) to receive the final instruction.  \"What have I to do  when death takes the place of life?\" asked Masa-shige.  The teacher  replied:    \"Be bold, at once cut off both ties,  The drawn sword gleams against the skies.\"    Thus becoming, as it were, an indispensable discipline for the  Samurai, Zen never came to an end with the Ho-jo period, but grew  more prosperous than before during the reign[FN#92] of the Emperor  Go-dai-go, one of the most enthusiastic patrons of the faith.      [FN#91]  The event is detailed at length in a life of So-shun, but  some historians suspect it to be fictitious. This awaits a further  research.    [FN#92]  As we have already mentioned, Do-gen, the founder of the  Japanese So To Sect, shunned the society of the rich and the  powerful, and led a secluded life.  In consequence his sect did not  make any rapid progress until the Fourth Patriarch of his line,  Kei-zan (1268-1325) who, being of energetic spirit, spread his faith  with remarkable activity, building many large monasteries, of which  Yo-ko-ji, in the province of No-to, So-ji-ji (near Yokohama), one of  the head temples of the sect, are well known.  One of his disciples,  Mei ho (1277-1350), propagated the faith in the northern provinces;  while another disciple, Ga-san (1275-1365), being a greater  character, brought up more than thirty distinguished disciples, of  whom Tai-gen, Tsu-gen, Mu-tan, Dai-tetsu, and Jip-po, are best known.   Tai-gen (died 1370) and big successors propagated the faith over the  middle provinces, while Tsu-gen (1332-1391) and his successors spread  the sect all over the north-eastern and south-western provinces.  Thus it is worthy of our notice that most of the Rin Zai teachers  confined their activities within Kamakura and Kyo-to, while the So To  masters spread the faith all over the country.      The Shoguns of the Ashi-kaga period (1338-1573) were not less devoted  to the faith than the Emperors who succeeded the Emperor Go-dai-go.  And even Taka-uji (1338-1357), the notorious founder of the  Shogunate, built a monastery and invited So-seki,[FN#93] better known  as Mu-So-Koku-Shi, who was respected as the tutor by the three  successive Emperors after Go-dai-go.  Taka-uji's example was followed  by all succeeding Shoguns, and Shogun's example was followed by the  feudal lords and their vassals.  This resulted in the propagation of  Zen throughout the country.  We can easily imagine how Zen was  prosperous in these days from the splendid monasteries[FN#94] built  at this period, such as the Golden Hall Temple and the Silver Hall  Temple that still adorn the fair city of Kyo-to.    [FN#93]  So-seki (1276-1351) was perhaps the greatest Zen master of  the period.  Of numerous monasteries built for him, E-rin-ji, in the  province of Kae, and Ten-ryu-ji, the head temple of a sub-sect of the  Rin Zai under the same name, are of importance.  Out of over seventy  eminent disciples of his, Gi-do (1365-1388), the author of Ku-ge-shu;  Shun-oku (1331-1338), the founder of the monastery of So-koku-ji, the  head temple of a sub-sect of the Rin Zai under the same name; and  Zek-kai (1337-1405), author of Sho-ken-shu, are best known.      [FN#94]  Myo-shin-ji was built in 1337 by the Emperor Hana-zono;  Ten-ryu-ji was erected by Taka-uji, the first Shogun of the period,  in 1344; So-koku-ji by Yosh-imitsu, the third Shogun, in 1385;  Kin-Kaku-ji, or Golden Hall Temple, by the same Shogun, in 1397;  Gin-kaku-ji, or Silver Hall Temple, by Yoshi-masa, the eighth Shogun,  in 1480.        11. Zen in the Dark Age.    The latter half of the Ashikaga period was the age of arms and  bloodshed.  Every day the sun shone on the glittering armour of  marching soldiers.  Every wind sighed over the lifeless remains of  the brave.  Everywhere the din of battle resounded.  Out of these  fighting feudal lords stood two champions.  Each of them  distinguished himself as a veteran soldier and tactician.  Each of  them was known as an experienced practiser of Zen.  One was  Haru-nobu[FN#95] (Take-da, died in 1573), better known by his  Buddhist name, Shin-gen.  The other was Teru-tora[FN#96] (Uye-sugi,  died in 1578), better known by his Buddhist name, Ken-shin.  The  character of Shin-gen can be imagined from the fact that he never  built any castle or citadel or fortress to guard himself against his  enemy, but relied on his faithful vassals and people; while that of  Ken-shin, from the fact that he provided his enemy, Shin-gen, with  salt when the latter suffered from want of it, owing to the cowardly  stratagem of a rival lord.  The heroic battles waged by these two  great generals against each other are the flowers of the Japanese  war-history.  Tradition has it that when Shin-gen's army was put to  rout by the furious attacks of Ken-shin's troops, and a single  warrior mounted on a huge charger rode swiftly as a sweeping wind  into Shin-gen's head-quarters, down came a blow of the heavy sword  aimed at Shin-gen's forehead, with a question expressed in the  technical terms of Zen: \"What shalt thou do in such a state at such a  moment?\"  Having no time to draw his sword, Shin-gen parried it with  his war-fan, answering simultaneously in Zen words: \"A flake of snow  on the red-hot furnace!\"  Had not his attendants come to the rescue  Shin-gen's life might have gone as 'a flake of snow on the red-hot  furnace.'  Afterwards the horseman was known to have been Ken-shin  himself.  This tradition shows us how Zen was practically lived by  the Samurais of the Dark Age.      [FN#95]  Shin-gen practised Zen under the instruction of Kwai-sen,  who was burned to death by Nobu-naga (O-da) in 1582.  See  Hon-cho-ko-so-den.    [FN#96]  Ken-shin learned Zen under Shu-ken, a So Ta master. See  To-jo-ren-to-roku.      Although the priests of other Buddhist sects had their share in these  bloody affairs, as was natural at such a time, yet Zen monks stood  aloof and simply cultivated their literature.  Consequently, when all  the people grew entirely ignorant at the end of the Dark Age, the Zen  monks were the only men of letters.  None can deny this merit of  their having preserved learning and prepared for its revival in the  following period.[FN#97]      [FN#97]  After the introduction of Zen into Japan many important  books were written, and the following are chief doctrinal works:  Ko-zen-go-koku-ron, by Ei-sai; Sho bo-gen-zo; Gaku-do-yo-zin-shu;  Fu-kwan-za-zen-gi; Ei-hei-ko-roku, by Do-gen; Za-zen-yo-zin-ki; and  Den-ko-roku, by Kei-zan.        12. Zen under the Toku-gana Shogunate.    Peace was at last restored by Iye-yasu, the founder of the Toku-gana  Shogunate (1603-1867).  During this period the Shogunate gave  countenance to Buddhism on one hand, acknowledging it as the state  religion, bestowing rich property to large monasteries, making  priests take rank over common people, ordering every householder to  build a Buddhist altar in his house; while, on the other hand, it did  everything to extirpate Christianity, introduced in the previous  period (1544).  All this paralyzed the missionary spirit of the  Buddhists, and put all the sects in dormant state. As for Zen[FN#98]  it was still favoured by feudal lords and their vassals, and almost  all provincial lords embraced the faith.      [FN#98]  The So To Sect was not wanting in competent teachers, for it  might take pride in its Ten-kei (1648-1699), whose religious insight  was unsurpassed by any other master of the age; in its Shi getsu, who  was a commentator of various Zen books, and died 1764; in its Men-zan  (1683-1769), whose indefatigable works on the exposition of So To Zen  are invaluable indeed; and its Getsu-shu (1618-1696) and Man-zan  (1635-1714), to whose labours the reformation of the faith is  ascribed.  Similarly, the Rin Zai Sect, in its Gu-do (1579-1661); in  its Isshi (1608-1646); in its Taku-an (1573-1645), the favourite  tutor of the third Shogun, Iye-mitsu; in its Haku-in (1667-1751), the  greatest of the Rin Zai masters of the day, to whose extraordinary  personality and labour the revival of the sect is due; and its To-rei  (1721-1792), a learned disciple of Haku-in.  Of the important Zen  books written by these masters, Ro-ji-tan-kin, by Ten-kei;  Men-zan-ko-roku, by Men-zan; Ya-sen-kwan-wa, Soku-ko-roku,  Kwai-an-koku-go, Kei-so-doku-zui, by Haku-in; Shu-mon-mu-jin-to-ron,  by To-rei, are well known.      It was about the middle of this period that the forty-seven vassals  of Ako displayed the spirit of the Samurai by their perseverance,  self-sacrifice, and loyalty, taking vengeance on the enemy of their  deceased lord.  The leader of these men, the tragic tales of whom can  never be told or heard without tears, was Yoshi-o (O-ishi died 1702),  a believer of Zen,[FN#99] and his tomb in the cemetery of the temple  of Sen-gaku-ji, Tokyo, is daily visited by hundreds of his admirers.  Most of the professional swordsmen forming a class in these days  practised Zen. Mune-nori[FN#100](Ya-gyu), for instance, established  his reputation by the combination of Zen and the fencing art.      [FN#99]  See \"Zen Shu,\" No. 151.    [FN#100]  He is known as Ta-jima, who practised Zen under Taku-an.      The following story about Boku-den (Tsuka-hara), a great swordsman,  fully illustrates this tendency:    \"On a certain occasion Boku-den took a ferry to cross over the Yabase  in the province of Omi.  There was among the passengers a Samurai,  tall and square-shouldered, apparently an experienced fencer.  He  behaved rudely toward the fellow-passen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/518"],[0,"The Enchanted Island of Yew (#12)"],[1,"an  opening.  For either it will come to an end or there will prove to be a  way through it to the other side.\"    So they rode alongside the hedge for hour after hour; yet it did not  end, nor could they espy any way to get through the thickly matted  briers.  By and by night fell, and they tethered their horses to some  shrubs, where there were a few scanty blades of grass for them to crop,  and then laid themselves down upon the ground, with bare rocks for  pillows, where they managed to sleep soundly until morning.    They had brought a supply of food in their pouches, and on this they  breakfasted, afterward continuing their journey beside the hedge.    At noon Prince Marvel uttered an exclamation of surprise and stopped  his horse.    \"What is it?\" asked Nerle.    \"I have found the handkerchief with which you wiped the blood from your  hands yesterday morning, and then carelessly dropped,\" replied the  prince.  \"This proves that we have made a complete circle around this  hedge without finding a way to pass through it.\"    \"In that case,\" said Nerle, \"we had better leave the hedge and go in  another direction.\"    \"Not so,\" declared Marvel.  \"The hedge incloses some unknown country,  and I am curious to find out what it is.\"    \"But there is no opening,\" remonstrated Nerle.    \"Then we must make one.  Wouldn't you like to enjoy a little more pain?\"    \"Thank you,\" answered Nerle, \"my hands are still smarting very  comfortably from the pricks of yesterday.\"    \"Therefore I must make the attempt myself,\" said the prince, and  drawing his sword he whispered a queer word to it, and straightway  began slashing at the hedge.    The brambles fell fast before his blade, and when he had cut a big heap  of branches from the hedge Nerle dragged them to one side, and the  prince began again.    It was marvelous how thick the hedge proved.  Only a magic sword could  have done this work and remained sharp, and only a fairy arm could have  proved strong enough to hew through the tough wood.  But the magic  sword and fairy arm were at work, and naught could resist them.    After a time the last branches were severed and dragged from the path,  and then the travelers rode their horses through the gap into the  unknown country beyond.    They saw at first glance that it was a land of great beauty; but after  that one look both Prince Marvel and Nerle paused and rubbed their  eyes, to assure themselves that their vision was not blurred.    Before them were two trees, exactly alike.  And underneath the trees  two cows were grazing--each a perfect likeness of the other.  At their  left were two cottages, with every door and window and chimney the  exact counterpart of another.  Before these houses two little boys were  playing, evidently twins, for they not only looked alike and dressed  alike, but every motion one made was also made by the other at the same  time and in precisely the same way.  When one laughed the other  laughed, and when one stubbed his toe and fell down, the other did  likewise, and then they both sat up and cried lustily at the same time.    At this two women--it was impossible to tell one from the other--rushed  out of the two houses, caught up the two boys, shook and dusted them in  precisely the same way, and led them by their ears back into the houses.    Again the astonished travelers rubbed their eyes, and then Prince  Marvel looked at Nerle and said:    \"I thought at first that I saw everything double, but there seems to be  only one of YOU.\"    \"And of you,\" answered the boy.  \"But see! there are two hills ahead of  us, and two paths lead from the houses over the hills!  How strange it  all is!\"    Just then two birds flew by, close together and perfect mates; and the  cows raised their heads and \"mooed\" at the same time; and two men--also  twins--came over the two hills along the two paths with two  dinner-pails in their hands and entered the two houses.  They were met  at the doors by the two women, who kissed them exactly at the same time  and helped them off with their coats with the same motions, and closed  the two doors with two slams at the same instant.    Nerle laughed.  \"What sort of country have we got into?\" he asked.    \"Let us find out,\" replied the prince, and riding up to one of the  houses he knocked on the door with the hilt of his sword.    Instantly the doors of both houses flew open, and both men appeared in  the doorways.  Both started back in amazement at sight of the  strangers, and both women shrieked and both little boys began to cry.  Both mothers boxed the children's ears, and both men gasped out:    \"Who--who are you?\"    Their voices were exactly alike, and their words were spoken in unison.  Prince Marvel replied, courteously:    \"We are two strangers who have strayed into your country.  But I do not  understand why our appearance should so terrify you.\"    \"Why--you are singular!  There is only half of each of you!\" exclaimed  the two men, together.    \"Not so,\" said the prince, trying hard not to laugh in their faces.  \"We may be single, while you appear to be double; but each of us is  perfect, nevertheless.\"    \"Perfect!  And only half of you!\" cried the men.  And again the two  women, who were looking over their husbands' shoulders, screamed at  sight of the strangers; and again the two boys, who were clinging to  their mothers' dresses in the same positions, began to cry.    \"We did not know such strange people existed!\" said the two men, both  staring at the strangers and then wiping the beads of perspiration from  their two brows with two faded yellow handkerchiefs.    \"Nor did we!\" retorted the prince.  \"I assure you we are as much  surprised as you are.\"    Nerle laughed again at this, and to hear only one of the strangers  speak and the other only laugh seemed to terrify the double people  anew.  So Prince Marvel quickly asked:    \"Please tell us what country this is?\"    \"The Land of Twi,\" answered both men, together.    \"Oh! the Land of Twi.  And why is the light here so dim?\" continued the  prince.    \"Dim?\" repeated the men, as if surprised; \"why, this is twilight, of  course.\"    \"Of course,\" said Nerle.  \"I hadn't thought of that.  We are in the  long hidden Land of Twi, which all men have heard of, but no man has  found before.\"    \"And who may you be?\" questioned the prince, looking from one man to  the other, curiously.    \"We are Twis,\" they answered.    \"Twice?\"    \"Twis--inhabitants of Twi.\"    \"It's the same thing,\" laughed Nerle.  \"You see everything twice in  this land.\"    \"Are none of your people single?\" asked Prince Marvel.    \"Single,\" returned the men, as if perplexed.  \"We don't understand.\"    \"Are you all double?--or are some of you just one?\" said the prince,  who found it difficult to put his question plainly.    \"What does 'one' mean?\" asked the men.  \"There is no such word as 'one'  in our language.\"    \"They have no need of such a word,\" declared Nerle.    \"We are only poor laborers,\" explained the men.  \"But over the hills  lie the cities of Twi, where the Ki and the Ki-Ki dwell, and also the  High Ki.\"    \"Ah!\" said Marvel, \"I've heard of your High Ki.  Who is he?\"    The men shook their heads, together and with the same motion.    \"We have never seen the glorious High Ki,\" they answered.  \"The sight  of their faces is forbidden.  None but the Ki and the Ki-Ki has seen  the Supreme Rulers and High Ki.\"    \"I'm getting mixed,\" said Nerle.  \"All this about the Ki and the Ki-Ki  and the High Ki makes me dizzy.  Let's go on to the city and explore  it.\"    \"That is a good suggestion,\" replied the prince.  \"Good by, my  friends,\" he added, addressing the men.    They both bowed, and although they still seemed somewhat frightened  they answered him civilly and in the same words, and closed their doors  at the same time.    So Prince Marvel and Nerle rode up the double path to the hills, and  the two cows became frightened and ran away with the same swinging  step, keeping an exact space apart.  And when they were a safe distance  they both stopped, looked over their right shoulders, and \"mooed\" at  the same instant.        14.  The Ki and the Ki-Ki    From the tops of the hills the travelers caught their first glimpse of  the wonderful cities of Twi.  Two walls surrounded the cities, and in  the walls were two gates just alike.  Within the inclosures stood many  houses, but all were built in pairs, from the poorest huts to the most  splendid palaces.  Every street was double, the pavements running side  by side.  There were two lamp-posts on every corner, and in the dim  twilight that existed these lamp-posts were quite necessary.  If there  were trees or bushes anywhere, they invariably grew in pairs, and if a  branch was broken on one it was sure to be broken on the other, and  dead leaves fell from both trees at identically the same moment.    Much of this Marvel and Nerle learned after they had entered the  cities, but the view from the hills showed plainly enough that the  \"double\" plan existed everywhere and in every way in this strange land.    They followed the paths down to the gates of the walls, where two pairs  of soldiers rushed out and seized their horses by the bridles.  These  soldiers all seemed to be twins, or at least mates, and each one of  each pair was as like the other as are two peas growing in the same  pod.  If one had a red nose the other's was red in the same degree, and  the soldiers that held the bridles of Nerle's horse both had their left  eyes bruised and blackened, as from a blow of the same force.    These soldiers, as they looked upon Nerle and the prince, seemed fully  as much astonished and certainly more frightened than their prisoners.  They were dressed in bright yellow uniforms with green buttons, and the  soldiers who had arrested the prince had both torn their left  coat-sleeves and had patches of the same shape upon the seats of their  trousers.    \"How dare you stop us, fellows?\" "]]]
