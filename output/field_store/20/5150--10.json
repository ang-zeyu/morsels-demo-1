Mrs. Wheeler's face, except for eyes, was as  expressionless as it usually was.  Unlike the tall, fair, fat  Miss Rosetta, Mrs. Wheeler was small and dark and thin, with an  eager, careworn face.    \"How is Jane?\" she said abruptly, breaking the silence of ten  years in saying it.    \"Jane is dead and buried, poor thing,\" said Miss Rosetta calmly.  \"I am taking her baby, little Camilla Jane, home with me.\"    \"The baby belongs to me,\" cried Mrs. Wheeler passionately.  \"Jane  wrote to me about her.  Jane meant that I should have her.  I've  come for her.\"    \"You'll go back without her then,\" said Miss Rosetta, serene in  the possession that is nine points of the law.  \"The child is  mine, and she is going to stay mine.  You can make up your mind  to that, Charlotte Wheeler.  A woman who eloped to get married  isn't fit to be trusted with a baby, anyhow.  Jacob Wheeler--\"    But Mrs. Wheeler had rushed past into the house.  Miss Rosetta  composedly stepped into the cab and drove to the station.  She  fairly bridled with triumph; and underneath the triumph ran a  queer undercurrent of satisfaction over the fact that Charlotte  had spoken to her at last.  Miss Rosetta would not look at this  satisfaction, or give it a name, but it was there.    Miss Rosetta arrived safely back in Avonlea with Camilla Jane and  within ten hours everybody in the settlement knew the whole  story, and every woman who could stand on her feet had been up to  the Ellis cottage to see the baby.  Mrs. Wheeler arrived home  twenty-four hours later, and silently betook herself to her farm.  When her Avonlea neighbors sympathized with her in her  disappointment, she said nothing, but looked all the more darkly  determined.  Also, a week later, Mr. William J. Blair, the  Carmody storekeeper, had an odd tale to tell.  Mrs. Wheeler had  come to the store and bought a lot of fine flannel and muslin and  valenciennes.  Now, what in the name of time, did Mrs. Wheeler  want with such stuff?  Mr. William J. Blair couldn't make head or  tail of it, and it worried him.  Mr. Blair was so accustomed to  know what everybody bought anything for that such a mystery quite  upset him.      Miss Rosetta had exulted in the possession of little Camilla Jane  for a month, and had been so happy that she had almost given up  inveighing against Charlotte.  Her conversations, instead of  tending always to Jacob Wheeler, now ran Camilla Janeward; and  this, folks thought, was an improvement.    One afternoon, Miss Rosetta, leaving Camilla Jane snugly sleeping  in her cradle in the kitchen, had slipped down to the bottom of  the garden to pick her currants.  The house was hidden from her  sight by the copse of cherry trees, but she had left the kitchen  window open, so that she could hear the baby if it awakened and  cried.  Miss Rosetta sang happily as she picked her currants.  For the first time since Charlotte had married Jacob Wheeler Miss  Rosetta felt really happy--so happy that there was no room in  her heart for bitterness.  In fancy she looked forward to the  coming years, and saw Camilla Jane growing up into girlhood, fair  and lovable.    \"She'll be a beauty,\" reflected Miss Rosetta complacently.  \"Jane  was a handsome girl.  She shall always be dressed as nice as I  can manage it, and I'll get her an organ, and have her take  painting and music lessons.  Parties, too!  I'll give her a real  coming-out party when she's eighteen and the very prettiest dress  that's to be had.  Dear me, I can hardly wait for her to grow up,  though she's sweet enough now to make one wish she could stay a  baby forever.\"    When Miss Rosetta returned to the kitchen, her eyes fell on an  empty cradle.  Camilla Jane was gone!    Miss Rosetta promptly screamed.  She understood at a glance what  had happened.  Six months' old babies do not get out of their  cradles and disappear through closed doors without any  assistance.    \"Charlotte has been here,\" gasped Miss Rosetta.  \"Charlotte has  stolen Camilla Jane!  I might have expected it.  I might have  known when I heard that story about her buying muslin and  flannel.  It's just like Charlotte to do such an underhand trick.  But I'll go after her!  I'll show her!  She'll find out she has  got Rosetta Ellis to deal with and no Wheeler!\"    Like a frantic creature and wholly forgetting that her hair was  in curl-papers, Miss Rosetta hurried up the hill and down the  shore road to the Wheeler Farm--a place she had never visited in  her life before.    The wind was off-shore and only broke the bay's surface into long  silvery ripples, and sent sheeny shadows flying out across it  from every point and headland, like transparent wings.    The little gray house, so close to the purring waves that in  storms their spray splashed over its very doorstep, seemed  deserted.  Miss Rosetta pounded lustily on the front door.  This  producing no result, she marched around to the back door and  knocked.  No answer.  Miss Rosetta tried the door.  It was  locked.    \"Guilty conscience,\" sniffed Miss Rosetta.  \"Well, I shall stay  here until I see that perfidious Charlotte, if I have to camp in  the yard all night.\"    Miss Rosetta was quite capable of doing this, but she was spared  the necessity; walking boldly up to the kitchen window, and  peering through it, she felt her heart swell with anger as she  beheld Charlotte sitting calmly by the table with Camilla Jane on  her knee.  Beside her was a befrilled and bemuslined cradle, and  on a chair lay the garments in which Miss Rosetta had dressed the  baby.  It was clad in an entirely new outfit, and seemed quite at  home with its new possessor.  It was laughing and cooing, and  making little dabs at her with its dimpled hands.    \"Charlotte Wheeler,\" cried Miss Rosetta, rapping sharply on the  window-pane.  \"I've come for that child!  Bring her out to me at  once--at once, I say!  How dare you come to my house and steal a  baby?  You're no better than a common burglar.  Give me Camilla  Jane, I say!\"    Charlotte came over to the window with the baby in her arms and  triumph glittering in her eyes.    \"There is no such child as Camilla Jane here,\" she said.  \"This  is Barbara Jane.  She belongs to me.\"    With that Mrs. Wheeler pulled down the shade.    Miss Rosetta had to go home.  There was nothing else for her to  do.  On her way she met Mr. Patterson and told him in full the  story of her wrongs.  It was all over Avonlea by night, and  created quite a sensation.  Avonlea had not had such a toothsome  bit of gossip for a long time.    Mrs. Wheeler exulted in the possession of Barbara Jane for six  weeks, during which Miss Rosetta broke her heart with loneliness  and longing, and meditated futile plots for the recovery of the  baby.  It was hopeless to think of stealing it back or she would  have tried to.  The hired man at the Wheeler place reported that  Mrs. Wheeler never left it night or day for a single moment.  She  even carried it with her when she went to milk the cows.    \"But my turn will come,\" said Miss Rosetta grimly.  \"Camilla Jane  is mine, and if she was called Barbara for a century it wouldn't  alter that fact!  Barbara, indeed!  Why not have called her  Methusaleh and have done with it?\"    One afternoon in October, when Miss Rosetta was picking her  apples and thinking drearily about lost Camilla Jane, a woman  came running breathlessly down the hill and into the yard.  Miss  Rosetta gave an exclamation of amazement and dropped her basket  of apples.  Of all incredible things!  The woman was  Charlotte--Charlotte who had never set foot on the grounds of the Ellis  cottage since her marriage ten years ago, Charlotte, bare-headed,  wild-eyed, distraught, wringing her hands and sobbing.    Miss Rosetta flew to meet her.    \"You've scalded Camilla Jane to death!\" she exclaimed.  \"I always  knew you would--always expected it!\"    \"Oh, for heaven's sake, come quick, Rosetta!\" gasped Charlotte.  \"Barbara Jane is in convulsions and I don't know what to do.  The  hired man has gone for the doctor.  You were the nearest, so I  came to you.  Jenny White was there when they came on, so I left  her and ran.  Oh, Rosetta, come, come, if you have a spark of  humanity in you!  You know what to do for convulsions--you  saved the Ellis baby when it had them.  Oh, come and save Barbara  Jane!\"    \"You mean Camilla Jane, I presume?\" said Miss Rosetta firmly, in  spite of her agitation.    For a second Charlotte Wheeler hesitated.  Then she said  passionately: \"Yes, yes, Camilla Jane--any name you like!  Only  come.\"    Miss Rosetta went, and not a moment too soon, either.  The doctor  lived eight miles away and the baby was very bad.  The two women  and Jenny White worked over her for hours.  It was not until  dark, when the baby was sleeping soundly and the doctor had gone,  after telling Miss Rosetta that she had saved the child's life,  that a realization of the situation came home to them.    \"Well,\" said Miss Rosetta, dropping into an armchair with a long  sigh of weariness, \"I guess you'll admit now, Charlotte Wheeler,  that you are hardly a fit person to have charge of a baby, even  if you had to go and steal it from me.  I should think your  conscience would reproach you--that is, if any woman who would  marry Jacob Wheeler in such an underhanded fashion has a--\"    \"I--I wanted the baby,\" sobbed Charlotte, tremulously.  \"I was so  lonely here.  I didn't think it was any harm to take her, because  Jane gave her to me in her letter.  But you have saved her life,  Rosetta, and you--you can have her back, although it will break  my heart to give her up.  But, oh, Rosetta, won't you let me come  and see her sometimes?  I love her so I can't bear to give her up  entirely.\"    \"Charlotte,\" said Miss Rosetta firmly, \"the most sensible thing  for you to do is just to come back with the baby.  You are  worried to death trying to run this farm with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5341"],[0,"Kilmeny of the Orchard (#12)"],[1,"Eric. He was on the point of going off into a  peal of laughter at the idea when a glimpse of her half averted face  sobered him. On it was a hurt, bitter look, such as he remembered seeing  once before, when he had asked her if she would not like to see the  world for herself.    \"Kilmeny,\" he said in astonishment, \"you don't really think yourself  ugly, do you?\"    She nodded, without looking at him, and then wrote,    \"Oh, yes, I know that I am. I have known it for a long time. Mother told  me that I was very ugly and that nobody would ever like to look at me. I  am sorry. It hurts me much worse to know I am ugly than it does to know  I cannot speak. I suppose you will think that is very foolish of me, but  it is true. That was why I did not come back to the orchard for such a  long time, even after I had got over my fright. I hated to think that  YOU would think me ugly. And that is why I do not want to go out into  the world and meet people. They would look at me as the egg peddler did  one day when I went out with Aunt Janet to his wagon the spring after  mother died. He stared at me so. I knew it was because he thought me so  ugly, and I have always hidden when he came ever since.\"    Eric's lips twitched. In spite of his pity for the real suffering  displayed in her eyes, he could not help feeling amused over the absurd  idea of this beautiful girl believing herself in all seriousness to be  ugly.    \"But, Kilmeny, do you think yourself ugly when you look in a mirror?\" he  asked smiling.    \"I have never looked in a mirror,\" she wrote. \"I never knew there was  such a thing until after mother died, and I read about it in a book.  Then I asked Aunt Janet and she said mother had broken all the looking  glasses in the house when I was a baby. But I have seen my face  reflected in the spoons, and in a little silver sugar bowl Aunt Janet  has. And it IS ugly--very ugly.\"    Eric's face went down into the grass. For his life he could not help  laughing; and for his life he would not let Kilmeny see him laughing.  A certain little whimsical wish took possession of him and he did not  hasten to tell her the truth, as had been his first impulse. Instead,  when he dared to look up he said slowly,    \"I don't think you are ugly, Kilmeny.\"    \"Oh, but I am sure you must,\" she wrote protestingly. \"Even Neil does.  He tells me I am kind and nice, but one day I asked him if he thought  me very ugly, and he looked away and would not speak, so I knew what he  thought about it, too. Do not let us speak of this again. It makes me  feel sorry and spoils everything. I forget it at other times. Let me  play you some good-bye music, and do not feel vexed because I would not  take your book. It would only make me unhappy to read it.\"    \"I am not vexed,\" said Eric, \"and I think you will take it some day  yet--after I have shown you something I want you to see. Never mind  about your looks, Kilmeny. Beauty isn't everything.\"    \"Oh, it is a great deal,\" she wrote naively. \"But you do like me, even  though I am so ugly, don't you? You like me because of my beautiful  music, don't you?\"    \"I like you very much, Kilmeny,\" answered Eric, laughing a little;  but there was in his voice a tender note of which he was unconscious.  Kilmeny was aware of it, however, and she picked up her violin with a  pleased smile.    He left her playing there, and all the way through the dim resinous  spruce wood her music followed him like an invisible guardian spirit.    \"Kilmeny the Beautiful!\" he murmured, \"and yet, good heavens, the child  thinks she is ugly--she with a face more lovely than ever an artist  dreamed of! A girl of eighteen who has never looked in a mirror! I  wonder if there is another such in any civilized country in the world.  What could have possessed her mother to tell her such a falsehood? I  wonder if Margaret Gordon could have been quite sane. It is strange that  Neil has never told her the truth. Perhaps he doesn't want her to find  out.\"    Eric had met Neil Gordon a few evenings before this, at a country  dance where Neil had played the violin for the dancers. Influenced by  curiosity he had sought the lad's acquaintance. Neil was friendly and  talkative at first; but at the first hint concerning the Gordons  which Eric threw out skilfully his face and manner changed. He looked  secretive and suspicious, almost sinister. A sullen look crept into  his big black eyes and he drew his bow across the violin strings with a  discordant screech, as if to terminate the conversation. Plainly nothing  was to be found out from him about Kilmeny and her grim guardians.        CHAPTER X. A TROUBLING OF THE WATERS    One evening in late June Mrs. Williamson was sitting by her kitchen  window. Her knitting lay unheeded in her lap, and Timothy, though he  nestled ingratiatingly against her foot as he lay on the rug and purred  his loudest, was unregarded. She rested her face on her hand and looked  out of the window, across the distant harbour, with troubled eyes.    \"I guess I must speak,\" she thought wistfully. \"I hate to do it. I  always did hate meddling. My mother always used to say that ninety-nine  times out of a hundred the last state of a meddler and them she  meddled with was worse than the first. But I guess it's my duty. I was  Margaret's friend, and it is my duty to protect her child any way I can.  If the Master does go back across there to meet her I must tell him what  I think about it.\"    Overhead in his room, Eric was walking about whistling. Presently he  came downstairs, thinking of the orchard, and the girl who would be  waiting for him there.    As he crossed the little front entry he heard Mrs. Williamson's voice  calling to him.    \"Mr. Marshall, will you please come here a moment?\"    He went out to the kitchen. Mrs. Williamson looked at him deprecatingly.  There was a flush on her faded cheek and her voice trembled.    \"Mr. Marshall, I want to ask you a question. Perhaps you will think it  isn't any of my business. But it isn't because I want to meddle. No, no.  It is only because I think I ought to speak. I have thought it over for  a long time, and it seems to me that I ought to speak. I hope you won't  be angry, but even if you are I must say what I have to say. Are you  going back to the old Connors orchard to meet Kilmeny Gordon?\"    For a moment an angry flush burned in Eric's face. It was more Mrs.  Williamson's tone than her words which startled and annoyed him.    \"Yes, I am, Mrs. Williamson,\" he said coldly. \"What of it?\"    \"Then, sir,\" said Mrs. Williamson with more firmness, \"I have got to  tell you that I don't think you are doing right. I have been suspecting  all along that that was where you went every evening, but I haven't said  a word to any one about it. Even my husband doesn't know. But tell me  this, Master. Do Kilmeny's uncle and aunt know that you are meeting her  there?\"    \"Why,\" said Eric, in some confusion, \"I--I do not know whether they do  or not. But Mrs. Williamson, surely you do not suspect me of meaning any  harm or wrong to Kilmeny Gordon?\"    \"No, I don't, Master. I might think it of some men, but never of you. I  don't for a minute think that you would do her or any woman any wilful  wrong. But you may do her great harm for all that. I want you to stop  and think about it. I guess you haven't thought. Kilmeny can't know  anything about the world or about men, and she may get to thinking too  much of you. That might break her heart, because you couldn't ever marry  a dumb girl like her. So I don't think you ought to be meeting her so  often in this fashion. It isn't right, Master. Don't go to the orchard  again.\"    Without a word Eric turned away, and went upstairs to his room. Mrs.  Williamson picked up her knitting with a sigh.    \"That's done, Timothy, and I'm real thankful,\" she said. \"I guess  there'll be no need of saying anything more. Mr. Marshall is a fine  young man, only a little thoughtless. Now that he's got his eyes opened  I'm sure he'll do what is right. I don't want Margaret's child made  unhappy.\"    Her husband came to the kitchen door and sat down on the steps to enjoy  his evening smoke, talking between whiffs to his wife of Elder Tracy's  church row, and Mary Alice Martin's beau, the price Jake Crosby was  giving for eggs, the quantity of hay yielded by the hill meadow, the  trouble he was having with old Molly's calf, and the respective merits  of Plymouth Rock and Brahma roosters. Mrs. Williamson answered at  random, and heard not one word in ten.    \"What's got the Master, Mother?\" inquired old Robert, presently. \"I hear  him striding up and down in his room 'sif he was caged. Sure you didn't  lock him in by mistake?\"    \"Maybe he's worried over the way Seth Tracy's acting in school,\"  suggested Mrs. Williamson, who did not choose that her gossipy husband  should suspect the truth about Eric and Kilmeny Gordon.    \"Shucks, he needn't worry a morsel over that. Seth'll quiet down as soon  as he finds he can't run the Master. He's a rare good teacher--better'n  Mr. West was even, and that's saying something. The trustees are hoping  he'll stay for another term. They're going to ask him at the school  meeting to-morrow, and offer him a raise of supplement.\"    Upstairs, in his little room under the eaves, Eric Marshall was in  the grip of the most intense and overwhelming emotion he had ever  experienced.    Up and down, to and fro, he walked, with set lips and clenched hands.  When he was wearied out he flung himself on a chair by the window and  wrestled with the flood of feeling.    Mrs. Williamson's words had torn away the delusive veil with which he  had bound his eyes. He was face to face with the knowledge that he loved  Kilmeny Gordon with the love that comes but once, and is for all time.  He wondered how he could have been so long blind to it. He knew that he  must have loved her ever since their first meeting that May evening in  the old "]]]
