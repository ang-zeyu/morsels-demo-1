FAUSTUS, the knight was not present during Faustus's  \"conference\" with the Emperor; nor did he offer the doctor any  insult by doubting his skill in magic.  We are there told that  Faustus happening to see the knight asleep, \"leaning out of a  window of the great hall,\" fixed a huge pair of hart's horns on  his head; \"and, as the knight awaked, thinking to pull in his head,  he hit his hornes against the glasse, that the panes thereof flew  about his eares:  thinke here how this good gentleman was vexed,  for he could neither get backward nor forward.\"  After the emperor  and the courtiers, to their great amusement, had beheld the poor  knight in this condition, Faustus removed the horns.  When Faustus,  having taken leave of the emperor, was a league and a half from  the city, he was attacked in a wood by the knight and some of his  companions:  they were in armour, and mounted on fair palfreys;  but the doctor quickly overcame them by turning all the bushes  into horsemen, and \"so charmed them, that every one, knight and  other, for the space of a whole moneth, did weare a paire of  goates hornes on their browes, and every palfry a paire of oxe  hornes on his head; and this was their penance appointed by  Faustus.\"  A second attempt of the knight to revenge himself on  Faustus proved equally unsuccessful.

HOW DOCTOR  FAUSTUS PLAYED A MERRY JEST WITH THE DUKE OF ANHOLT IN HIS COURT.  Doctor Faustus on a time went to the Duke of Anholt, who welcommed  him very courteously; this was the moneth of January; where sitting  at the table, he perceived the dutchess to be with child; and  forbearing himselfe untill the meat was taken from the table,  and that they brought in the banqueting dishes [i.e. the dessert--,  Doctor Faustus said to the dutchesse, Gratious lady, I have alwayes  heard that great-bellied women doe alwayes long for some dainties;  I beseech therefore your grace, hide not your minde from me, but  tell me what you desire to eat.  She answered him, Doctor Faustus,  now truly I will not hide from you what my heart doth most desire;  namely, that, if it were now harvest, I would eat my bellyfull of  grapes and other dainty fruit.  Doctor Faustus answered hereupon,  Gracious lady, this is a small thing for me to doe, for I can doe  more than this.  Wherefore he tooke a plate, and set open one of  the casements of the window, holding it forth; where incontinent  he had his dish full of all manner of fruit, as red and white  grapes, peares, and apples, the which came from out of strange  countries:  all these he presented the dutchesse, saying, Madam,  I pray you vouchsafe to taste of this dainty fruit, the which  came from a farre countrey, for there the summer is not yet ended.  The dutchesse thanked Faustus highly, and she fell to her fruit  with full appetite.  The Duke of Anholt notwithstanding could not  withhold to ask Faustus with what reason there were such young  fruit to be had at that time of the yeare.  Doctor Faustus told  him, May it please your grace to understand that the year is  divided into two circles of the whole world, that when with us it  is winter, in the contrary circle it is notwithstanding summer;  for in India and Saba there falleth or setteth the sunne, so that  it is so warm that they have twice a yeare fruit; and, gracious  lord, I have a swift spirit, the which can in the twinkling of  an eye fulfill my desire in any thing; wherefore I sent him into  those countries, who hath brought this fruit as you see:  whereat  the duke was in great admiration.\"]    [Footnote 149: Saba-- i.e. Sabaea.]    [Footnote 150: beholding-- i.e. beholden.]    [Footnote 151: Enter WAGNER-- Scene, a room in the house of Faustus.]    [Footnote 152: he hath given to me all his goods-- Compare chap. lvi. of  THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS,--\"How Doctor Faustus made his will,  in which he named his servant Wagner to be his heire.\"]    [Footnote 153: HELEN passeth over the stage-- In THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR  FAUSTUS we have the following description of Helen.  \"This lady  appeared before them in a most rich gowne of purple velvet, costly  imbrodered; her haire hanged downe loose, as faire as the beaten  gold, and of such length that it reached downe to her hammes;  having most amorous cole-black eyes, a sweet and pleasant round  face, with lips as red as a cherry; her cheekes of a rose colour,  her mouth small, her neck white like a swan; tall and slender of  personage; in summe, there was no imperfect place in her:  she  looked round about with a rolling hawkes eye, a smiling and  wanton countenance, which neere-hand inflamed the hearts of all  the students; but that they perswaded themselves she was a spirit,  which made them lightly passe away such fancies.\"  Sig.

The childe told Doctor Faustus many things which  were don in forraign countrys; but in the end, when Faustus lost  his life, the mother and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/781"],[0,"Sinking of the Titanic and Great Sea Disasters (#12)"],[1,"down. I found myself not many feet from the ship, but  on the other side of it. The ship had turned around while I was under  the water.    \"I came up near a collapsible life-boat and grabbed it. Many men were  in the water near me. They had jumped at the last minute. A funnel fell  within four inches of me and killed one of the swimmers. Thirty clung to  the capsized boat, and a life-boat, with forty survivors in it already,  finally took them off.    \"George D. Widener and Harry Elkins Widener were among those who jumped  at the last minute. So did Robert Williams Daniel. The three of them  went down together. Daniel struck out, lashing the water with his arms  until he had made a point far distant from the sinking monster of the  sea. Later he was picked up by one of the passing life-boats.    \"The Wideners were not seen again, nor was John B. Thayer, who went down  on the boat. 'Jack' Thayer, who was literally thrown off the Titanic  by an explosion, after he had refused to leave the men to go with his  mother, floated around on a raft for an hour before he was picked up.\"      AFLOAT WITH JACK THAYER    Graphic accounts of the final plunge of the Titanic were related by two  Englishmen, survivors by the merest chance. One of them struggled for  hours to hold himself afloat on an overturned collapsible life-boat,  to one end of which John B. Thayer, Jr., of Philadelphia, whose father  perished, hung until rescued.    The men gave their names as A. H. Barkworth, justice of the peace of  East Riding, Yorkshire, England, and W. J. Mellers, of Christ Church  Terrace, Chelsea, London. The latter, a young man, had started for this  country with his savings to seek his fortune, and lost all but his life.    Mellers, like Quartermaster Moody, said Captain Smith did not commit  suicide. The captain jumped from the bridge, Mellers declares, and he  heard him say to his officers and crew: \"You have done your duty, boys.  Now every man for himself.\" Mellers and Barkworth, who say their names  have been spelled incorrectly in most of the lists of survivors, both  declare there were three distinct explosions before the Titanic broke in  two, and bow section first, and stern part last, settled with her human  cargo into the sea.    Her four whistles kept up a deafening blast until the explosions,  declare the men. The death cries from the shrill throats of the  blatant steam screechers beside the smokestacks so rent the air that  conversation among the passengers was possible only when one yelled into  the ear of a fellow-unfortunate.    \"I did not know the Thayer family well,\" declared Mr. Barkworth, \"but I  had met young Thayer, a clear-cut chap, and his father on the trip. The  lad and I struggled in the water for several hours endeavoring to hold  afloat by grabbing to the sides and end of an overturned life-boat.  Now and again we lost our grip and fell back into the water. I did not  recognize young Thayer in the darkness, as we struggled for our lives,  but I did recall having met him before when we were picked up by a  life-boat. We were saved by the merest chance, because the survivors on  a life-boat that rescued us hesitated in doing so, it seemed, fearing  perhaps that additional burdens would swamp the frail craft.    \"I considered my fur overcoat helped to keep me afloat. I had a life  preserver over it, under my arms, but it would not have held me up so  well out of the water but for the coat. The fur of the coat seemed not  to get wet through, and retained a certain amount of air that added to  buoyance. I shall never part with it.    \"The testimony of J. Bruce Ismay, managing director of the White Star  Line, that he had not heard explosions before the Titanic settled,  indicates that he must have gotten some distance from her in his  life-boat. There were three distinct explosions and the ship broke in  the center. The bow settled headlong first, and the stern last. I was  looking toward her from the raft to which young Thayer and I had clung.\"      HOW CAPTAIN SMITH DIED    Barkworth jumped, just before the Titanic went down. He said there were  enough life-preservers for all the passengers, but in the confusion many  may not have known where to look for them. Mellers, who had donned a  life-preserver, was hurled into the air, from the bow of the ship by the  force of the explosion, which he believed caused the Titanic to part in  the center.    \"I was not far from where Captain Smith stood on the bridge, giving full  orders to his men,\" said Mellers. \"The brave old seaman was crying, but  he had stuck heroically to the last. He did not shoot himself. He  jumped from the bridge when he had done all he could. I heard his final  instructions to his crew, and recall that his last words were: 'You have  done your duty, boys. Now every man for himself.'    \"I thought I was doomed to go down with the rest. I stood on the deck,  awaiting my fate, fearing to jump from the ship. Then came a grinding  noise, followed by two others, and I was hurled into the deep. Great  waves engulfed me, but I was not drawn toward the ship, so that I  believe there was little suction. I swam about for more than one hour  before I was picked up by a boat.\"      A FAITHFUL OFFICER    Charles Herbert Lightoller, previously mentioned, stood by the ship  until the last, working to get the passengers away, and when it appeared  that he had made his last trip he went up high on the officers' quarters  and made the best dive he knew how to make just as the ship plunged down  to the depths. This is an excerpt from his testimony before the Senate  investigating committee:    \"What time did you leave the ship?\"    \"I didn't leave it.\"    \"Did it leave you?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    Children shall hear that episode sung in after years and his own  descendants shall recite it to their bairns. Mr. Lightoller acted as an  officer and gentleman should, and he was not the only one.      A MESSAGE FROM A NOTORIOUS GAMBLER    That Jay Yates, gambler, confidence man and fugitive from justice, known  to the police and in sporting circles as J. H. Rogers, went down with  the Titanic after assisting many women aboard life-boats, became known  when a note, written on a blank page torn from a diary: was delivered to  his sister. Here is a fac-simile of the note:      {illust.}        This note was given by Rogers to a woman he was helping into a  life-boat. The woman, who signed herself \"Survivor,\" inclosed the note  with the following letter.    \"You will find note that was handed to me as I was leaving the Titanic.  Am stranger to this man, but think he was a card player. He helped me  aboard a life-boat and I saw him help others. Before we were lowered I  saw him jump into the sea. If picked up I did not recognize him on the  Carpathia. I don't think he was registered on the ship under his right  name.\"    Rogers' mother, Mrs. Mary A. Yates, an old woman, broke down when she  learned son had perished.    \"Thank God I know where he is now,\" she sobbed. \"I have not heard from  him for two years. The last news I had from him he was in London.\"      FIFTY LADS MET DEATH    Among the many hundreds of heroic souls who went bravely and quietly to  their end were fifty happy-go-lucky youngsters shipped as bell boys  or messengers to serve the first cabin passengers. James Humphreys, a  quartermaster, who commanded life-boat No. 11, told a li{t}tle story  that shows how these fifty lads met death.    Humphreys said the boys were called to their regular posts in the main  cabin entry and taken in charge by their captain, a steward. They were  ordered to remain in the cabin and not get in the way. Throughout the  first hour of confusion and terror these lads sat quietly on their  benches in various parts of the first cabin.    Then, just toward the end when the order was passed around that the ship  was going down and every man was free to save himself, if he kept away  from the life-boats in which the women    {illust. caption = \"WHO HATH MEASURED THE WATERS IN THE HOLLOW OF  HIS HAND.\"--Isaiah XL:xii}      were being taken, the bell boys scattered to all parts of the ship.    Humphreys said he saw numbers of them smoking cigarettes and joking with  the passengers. They seemed to think that their violation of the rule  against smoking while on duty was a sufficient breach of discipline.    Not one of them attempted to enter a life-boat. Not one of them was  saved.      THE HEROES WHO REMAINED    The women who left the ship; the men who remained--there is little to  choose between them for heroism. Many of the women compelled to take to  the boats would have stayed, had it been possible, to share the fate of  their nearest and dearest, without whom their lives are crippled, broken  and disconsolate.    The heroes who remained would have said, with Grenville. \"We have only  done our duty, as a man is bound to do.\" They sought no palms or crowns  of martyrdom. \"They also serve who only stand and wait,\" and their first  action was merely to step aside and give places in the boats to women  and children, some of whom were too young to comprehend or to remember.    There was no debate as to whether the life of a financier, a master  of business, was rated higher in the scale of values than that of an  ignorant peasant mother. A woman was a woman, whether she wore rags  or pearls. A life was given for a life, with no assertion that one was  priceless and the other comparatively valueless.    Many of those who elected to remain might have escaped. \"Chivalry\" is a  mild appellation for their conduct. Some of the vaunted knights of old  were desperate cowards by comparison. A fight in the open field, or  jousting in the tournament, did not call out the manhood in a man as did  the waiting till the great ship took the final plunge, in the knowledge  that the seas round about were covered with loving and yearning  witnesses whose own salvation was not assured.
