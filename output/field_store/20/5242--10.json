An expedition was equipped and everything was ready.  But Alcibiades got mixed up in a street brawl and was forced to flee.  The general who succeeded him was a bungler. First he lost his ships and  then he lost his army, and the few surviving Athenians were thrown into  the stone-quarries of Syracuse, where they died from hunger and thirst.    The expedition had killed all the young men of Athens. The city was  doomed. After a long siege the town surrendered in April of the year  404. The high walls were demolished. The navy was taken away by the  Spartans. Athens ceased to exist as the center of the great colonial  empire which it had conquered during the days of its prosperity. But  that wonderful desire to learn and to know and to investigate which  had distinguished her free citizens during the days of greatness and  prosperity did not perish with the walls and the ships. It continued to  live. It became even more brilliant.    Athens no longer shaped the destinies of the land of Greece. But now, as  the home of the first great university the city began to influence the  minds of intelligent people far beyond the narrow frontiers of Hellas.          ALEXANDER THE GREAT    ALEXANDER THE MACEDONIAN ESTABLISHES A GREEK WORLD-EMPIRE, AND WHAT  BECAME OF THIS HIGH AMBITION      WHEN the Achaeans had left their homes along the banks of the Danube to  look for pastures new, they had spent some time among the mountains of  Macedonia. Ever since, the Greeks had maintained certain more or  less formal relations with the people of this northern country. The  Macedonians from their side had kept themselves well informed about  conditions in Greece.    Now it happened, just when Sparta and Athens had finished their  disastrous war for the leadership of Hellas, that Macedonia was ruled  by an extraordinarily clever man by the name of Philip. He admired  the Greek spirit in letters and art but he despised the Greek lack of  self-control in political affairs. It irritated him to see a perfectly  good people waste its men and money upon fruitless quarrels. So he  settled the difficulty by making himself the master of all Greece and  then he asked his new subjects to join him on a voyage which he meant to  pay to Persia in return for the visit which Xerxes had paid the Greeks  one hundred and fifty years before.    Unfortunately Philip was murdered before he could start upon this  well-prepared expedition. The task of avenging the destruction of Athens  was left to Philip's son Alexander, the beloved pupil of Aristotle,  wisest of all Greek teachers.    Alexander bade farewell to Europe in the spring of the year 334 B.C.  Seven years later he reached India. In the meantime he had destroyed  Phoenicia, the old rival of the Greek merchants. He had conquered Egypt  and had been worshipped by the people of the Nile valley as the son  and heir of the Pharaohs. He had defeated the last Persian king--he had  overthrown the Persian empire he had given orders to rebuild Babylon--he  had led his troops into the heart of the Himalayan mountains and had  made the entire world a Macedonian province and dependency. Then he  stopped and announced even more ambitious plans.    The newly formed Empire must be brought under the influence of the Greek  mind. The people must be taught the Greek language--they must live in  cities built after a Greek model. The Alexandrian soldier now turned  school-master. The military camps of yesterday became the peaceful  centres of the newly imported Greek civilisation. Higher and higher  did the flood of Greek manners and Greek customs rise, when suddenly  Alexander was stricken with a fever and died in the old palace of King  Hammurabi of Babylon in the year 323.    Then the waters receded. But they left behind the fertile clay of a  higher civilisation and Alexander, with all his childish ambitions and  his silly vanities, had performed a most valuable service. His Empire  did not long survive him. A number of ambitious generals divided the  territory among themselves. But they too remained faithful to the dream  of a great world brotherhood of Greek and Asiatic ideas and knowledge.    They maintained their independence until the Romans added western  Asia and Egypt to their other domains. The strange inheritance of this  Hellenistic civilisation (part Greek, part Persian, part Egyptian  and Babylonian) fell to the Roman conquerors. During the following  centuries, it got such a firm hold upon the Roman world, that we feel  its influence in our own lives this very day.      A SUMMARY    A SHORT SUMMARY OF CHAPTERS 1 to 20      THUS far, from the top of our high tower we have been looking eastward.  But from this time on, the history of Egypt and Mesopotamia is going  to grow less interesting and I must take you to study the western  landscape.    Before we do this, let us stop a moment and make clear to ourselves what  we have seen.    First of all I showed you prehistoric man--a creature very simple in his  habits and very unattractive in his manners. I told you how he was  the most defenceless of the many animals that roamed through the early  wilderness of the five continents, but being possessed of a larger and  better brain, he managed to hold his own.    Then came the glaciers and the many centuries of cold weather, and life  on this planet became so difficult that man was obliged to think three  times as hard as ever before if he wished to survive. Since, however,  that \"wish to survive\" was (and is) the mainspring which keeps every  living being going full tilt to the last gasp of its breath, the brain  of glacial man was set to work in all earnestness. Not only did these  hardy people manage to exist through the long cold spells which killed  many ferocious animals, but when the earth became warm and comfortable  once more, prehistoric man had learned a number of things which gave  him such great advantages over his less intelligent neighbors that the  danger of extinction (a very serious one during the first half million  years of man's residence upon this planet) became a very remote one.    I told you how these earliest ancestors of ours were slowly plodding  along when suddenly (and for reasons that are not well understood) the  people who lived in the valley of the Nile rushed ahead and almost over  night, created the first centre of civilisation.    Then I showed you Mesopotamia, \"the land between the rivers,\" which was  the second great school of the human race. And I made you a map of the  little island bridges of the AEgean Sea, which carried the knowledge and  the science of the old east to the young west, where lived the Greeks.    Next I told you of an Indo-European tribe, called the Hellenes, who  thousands of years before had left the heart of Asia and who had in  the eleventh century before our era pushed their way into the rocky  peninsula of Greece and who, since then, have been known to us as the  Greeks. And I told you the story of the little Greek cities that  were really states, where the civilisation of old Egypt and Asia was  transfigured (that is a big word, but you can \"figure out\" what it  means) into something quite new, something that was much nobler and  finer than anything that had gone before.    When you look at the map you will see how by this time civilisation has  described a semi-circle. It begins in Egypt, and by way of Mesopotamia  and the AEgean Islands it moves westward until it reaches the European  continent. The first four thousand years, Egyptians and Babylonians and  Phoenicians and a large number of Semitic tribes (please remember that  the Jews were but one of a large number of Semitic peoples) have carried  the torch that was to illuminate the world. They now hand it over to the  Indo-European Greeks, who become the teachers of another Indo-European  tribe, called the Romans. But meanwhile the Semites have pushed westward  along the northern coast of Africa and have made themselves the rulers  of the western half of the Mediterranean just when the eastern half has  become a Greek (or Indo-European) possession.    This, as you shall see in a moment, leads to a terrible conflict between  the two rival races, and out of their struggle arises the victorious  Roman Empire, which is to take this Egyptian-Mesopotamian-Greek  civilisation to the furthermost corners of the European continent, where  it serves as the foundation upon which our modern society is based.    I know all this sounds very complicated, but if you get hold of these  few principles, the rest of our history will become a great deal  simpler. The maps will make clear what the words fail to tell. And after  this short intermission, we go back to our story and give you an account  of the famous war between Carthage and Rome.          ROME AND CARTHAGE    THE SEMITIC COLONY OF CARTHAGE ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF AFRICA AND THE  INDO-EUROPEAN CITY OF ROME ON THE WEST COAST OF ITALY FOUGHT EACH  OTHER FOR THE POSSESSION OF THE WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN AND CARTHAGE WAS  DESTROYED      THE little Phoenician trading post of Kart-hadshat stood on a low hill  which overlooked the African Sea, a stretch of water ninety miles  wide which separates Africa from Europe. It was an ideal spot for a  commercial centre. Almost too ideal. It grew too fast and became too  rich. When in the sixth century before our era, Nebuchadnezzar of  Babylon destroyed Tyre, Carthage broke off all further relations with  the Mother Country and became an independent state--the great western  advance-post of the Semitic races.    Unfortunately the city had inherited many of the traits which for a  thousand years had been characteristic of the Phoenicians. It was a vast  business-house, protected by a strong navy, indifferent to most of the  finer aspects of life.

As well as I could make out, she had come for good, and had no intention  of ever going again. She began to 'help' my mother next morning, and was  in and out of the store-closet all day, putting things to rights, and  making havoc in the old arrangements. Almost the first remarkable thing  I observed in Miss Murdstone was, her being constantly haunted by  a suspicion that the servants had a man secreted somewhere on the  premises. Under the influence of this delusion, she dived into the  coal-cellar at the most untimely hours, and scarcely ever opened the  door of a dark cupboard without clapping it to again, in the belief that  she had got him.    Though there was nothing very airy about Miss Murdstone, she was a  perfect Lark in point of getting up. She was up (and, as I believe  to this hour, looking for that man) before anybody in the house was  stirring. Peggotty gave it as her opinion that she even slept with one  eye open; but I could not concur in this idea; for I tried it myself  after hearing the suggestion thrown out, and found it couldn't be done.    On the very first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing her  bell at cock-crow. When my mother came down to breakfast and was going  to make the tea, Miss Murdstone gave her a kind of peck on the cheek,  which was her nearest approach to a kiss, and said:    'Now, Clara, my dear, I am come here, you know, to relieve you of all  the trouble I can. You're much too pretty and thoughtless'--my mother  blushed but laughed, and seemed not to dislike this character--'to have  any duties imposed upon you that can be undertaken by me. If you'll be  so good as give me your keys, my dear, I'll attend to all this sort of  thing in future.'    From that time, Miss Murdstone kept the keys in her own little jail all  day, and under her pillow all night, and my mother had no more to do  with them than I had.    My mother did not suffer her authority to pass from her without a shadow  of protest. One night when Miss Murdstone had been developing certain  household plans to her brother, of which he signified his approbation,  my mother suddenly began to cry, and said she thought she might have  been consulted.    'Clara!' said Mr. Murdstone sternly. 'Clara! I wonder at you.'    'Oh, it's very well to say you wonder, Edward!' cried my mother, 'and  it's very well for you to talk about firmness, but you wouldn't like it  yourself.'    Firmness, I may observe, was the grand quality on which both Mr. and  Miss Murdstone took their stand. However I might have expressed  my comprehension of it at that time, if I had been called upon, I  nevertheless did clearly comprehend in my own way, that it was another  name for tyranny; and for a certain gloomy, arrogant, devil's humour,  that was in them both. The creed, as I should state it now, was this.  Mr. Murdstone was firm; nobody in his world was to be so firm as Mr.  Murdstone; nobody else in his world was to be firm at all, for everybody  was to be bent to his firmness. Miss Murdstone was an exception.  She might be firm, but only by relationship, and in an inferior and  tributary degree. My mother was another exception. She might be firm,  and must be; but only in bearing their firmness, and firmly believing  there was no other firmness upon earth.    'It's very hard,' said my mother, 'that in my own house--'    'My own house?' repeated Mr. Murdstone. 'Clara!'    'OUR own house, I mean,' faltered my mother, evidently frightened--'I  hope you must know what I mean, Edward--it's very hard that in YOUR own  house I may not have a word to say about domestic matters. I am sure  I managed very well before we were married. There's evidence,' said my  mother, sobbing; 'ask Peggotty if I didn't do very well when I wasn't  interfered with!'    'Edward,' said Miss Murdstone, 'let there be an end of this. I go  tomorrow.'    'Jane Murdstone,' said her brother, 'be silent! How dare you to  insinuate that you don't know my character better than your words  imply?'    'I am sure,' my poor mother went on, at a grievous disadvantage, and  with many tears, 'I don't want anybody to go. I should be very  miserable and unhappy if anybody was to go. I don't ask much. I am not  unreasonable. I only want to be consulted sometimes. I am very much  obliged to anybody who assists me, and I only want to be consulted as a  mere form, sometimes. I thought you were pleased, once, with my being a  little inexperienced and girlish, Edward--I am sure you said so--but you  seem to hate me for it now, you are so severe.'    'Edward,' said Miss Murdstone, again, 'let there be an end of this. I go  tomorrow.'    'Jane Murdstone,' thundered Mr. Murdstone. 'Will you be silent? How dare  you?'    Miss Murdstone made a jail-delivery of her pocket-handkerchief, and held  it before her eyes.    'Clara,' he continued, looking at my mother, 'you surprise me! You  astound me! Yes, I had a satisfaction in the thought of marrying  an inexperienced and artless person, and forming her character, and  infusing into it some amount of that firmness and decision of which  it stood in need. But when Jane Murdstone is kind enough to come to my  assistance in this endeavour, and to assume, for my sake, a condition  something like a housekeeper's, and when she meets with a base return--'    'Oh, pray, pray, Edward,' cried my mother, 'don't accuse me of being  ungrateful. I am sure I am not ungrateful. No one ever said I was  before. I have many faults, but not that. Oh, don't, my dear!'    'When Jane Murdstone meets, I say,' he went on, after waiting until my  mother was silent, 'with a base return, that feeling of mine is chilled  and altered.'    'Don't, my love, say that!' implored my mother very piteously.  'Oh, don't, Edward! I can't bear to hear it. Whatever I am, I am  affectionate. I know I am affectionate. I wouldn't say it, if I  wasn't sure that I am. Ask Peggotty. I am sure she'll tell you I'm  affectionate.'    'There is no extent of mere weakness, Clara,' said Mr. Murdstone in  reply, 'that can have the least weight with me. You lose breath.'    'Pray let us be friends,' said my mother, 'I couldn't live under  coldness or unkindness. I am so sorry. I have a great many defects, I  know, and it's very good of you, Edward, with your strength of mind, to  endeavour to correct them for me. Jane, I don't object to anything. I  should be quite broken-hearted if you thought of leaving--' My mother  was too much overcome to go on.    'Jane Murdstone,' said Mr. Murdstone to his sister, 'any harsh words  between us are, I hope, uncommon. It is not my fault that so unusual an  occurrence has taken place tonight. I was betrayed into it by another.  Nor is it your fault. You were betrayed into it by another. Let us both  try to forget it. And as this,' he added, after these magnanimous words,  'is not a fit scene for the boy--David, go to bed!'    I could hardly find the door, through the tears that stood in my eyes.  I was so sorry for my mother's distress; but I groped my way out, and  groped my way up to my room in the dark, without even having the heart  to say good night to Peggotty, or to get a candle from her. When her  coming up to look for me, an hour or so afterwards, awoke me, she said  that my mother had gone to bed poorly, and that Mr. and Miss Murdstone  were sitting alone.    Going down next morning rather earlier than usual, I paused outside the  parlour door, on hearing my mother's voice. She was very earnestly and  humbly entreating Miss Murdstone's pardon, which that lady granted, and  a perfect reconciliation took place. I never knew my mother afterwards  to give an opinion on any matter, without first appealing to Miss  Murdstone, or without having first ascertained by some sure means, what  Miss Murdstone's opinion was; and I never saw Miss Murdstone, when out  of temper (she was infirm that way), move her hand towards her bag as  if she were going to take out the keys and offer to resign them to my  mother, without seeing that my mother was in a terrible fright.    The gloomy taint that was in the Murdstone blood, darkened the Murdstone  religion, which was austere and wrathful. I have thought, since,  that its assuming that character was a necessary consequence of Mr.  Murdstone's firmness, which wouldn't allow him to let anybody off from  the utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find any excuse  for. Be this as it may, I well remember the tremendous visages with  which we used to go to church, and the changed air of the place. Again,  the dreaded Sunday comes round, and I file into the old pew first, like  a guarded captive brought to a condemned service. Again, Miss Murdstone,  in a black velvet gown, that looks as if it had been made out of a pall,  follows close upon me; then my mother; then her husband. There is no  Peggotty now, as in the old time. Again, I listen to Miss Murdstone  mumbling the responses, and emphasizing all the dread words with a cruel  relish. Again, I see her dark eyes roll round the church when she says  'miserable sinners', as if she were calling all the congregation names.  Again, I catch rare glimpses of my mother, moving her lips timidly  between the two, with one of them muttering at each ear like low  thunder. Again, I wonder with a sudden fear whether it is likely that  our good old clergyman can be wrong, and Mr. and Miss Murdstone right,  and that all the angels in Heaven can be destroying angels. Again, if I  move a finger or relax a muscle of my face, Miss Murdstone pokes me with  her prayer-book, and makes my side ache.    Yes, and again, as we walk home, I note some neighbours looking at my  mother and at me, and whispering. Again, as the three go on arm-in-arm,  and I linger behind alone, I follow some of those looks, and wonder if  my mother's step be really not so light as I have seen it, and if the  gaiety of her beauty be really almost worried away. Again, I wonder"]]]
