The altar tomb of Sir Edward  Ferrers, Knight, the founder of the family at Baddesley, his wife Dame  Constance, and son who predeceased him, has above shields of the  alliances with the Bromes, Hampdens, etc. He was the son of Sir Henry  Ferrers, Knight, of Tamworth Castle, and grandson of William, Lord  Ferrers of Groby. Marmion was the thirteenth in descent from this Sir  Edward, not many links between the fifteenth and end of the nineteenth  century. The day of the good old squire's burial on August 25, 1884,  fell upon the three hundred and forty-ninth anniversary of the death of  the first Ferrers of Baddesley.    FOOTNOTES:    [16] There is an engraving of this room in Nash's _Mansions_.    [17] The description was written more than twenty years ago.          SOME NOOKS IN WORCESTERSHIRE  AND GLOUCESTERSHIRE      [Illustration: THE WHITE HOUSE, PIXHAM.]    Not far from Powick Bridge, where after two hours' hard fighting the  Royalists were defeated by General Fleetwood, stands a quaint old house  of timber and plaster, with nine gables facing three sides of the  compass, and a high three-gabled oaken porch in front. It is called  Priors Court, or the White House of Pixham, and since \"the battle of  Powick Bridge\" it has been occupied by the same family, though the name  by inter-marriage has changed from time to time. A branch of the Lanes  of Bentley were the representatives in the seventeenth century, and  according to tradition the famous Jane Lane lived here for a time.  Though the house belongs to the Tudor period, many alterations were made  early in the eighteenth century, but the little interior quadrangle  remains much in its original condition. One expects to find within, the  usual comfortable chimney corners and cosy panelled rooms, and perhaps  some ancient furniture; but it comes as a surprise to find a museum of  relics and heirlooms taking us back to the days of the Tudors and  Stuarts.    From the hall, we pass up the great oak staircase to bedrooms and  corridors containing chests and cabinets full of ancient deeds and  manuscripts, not the least remarkable of which is a parchment roll upon  which is painted a series of mysterious astrological and other pictures,  supposed once upon a time to have been the property of the necromancer  Dr. John Dee, who lived for some time in the neighbouring town of  Upton-on-Severn. If this is really a document of Dr. Dee's, one would  like to see it preserved with the famous crystal in the British Museum.  The old presses and cupboards are full of the richly embroidered  bed-hangings and homespun sheets wrought by the ladies of the house in  the days when their energies were devoted to domestic purposes, and the  idea of hockey or ladies' clubs would have made their hair to stand  erect. There are piles of arras carefully packed away when wall-paper  came in fashion. There are chairs and tables dating back three centuries  or more, and mirrors which have reflected fair faces patched, with  head-gear piled up mountain high.    In a corner stands a spinning-wheel, distaff, and reel complete, as if  some dainty damsel at work had fled at the approach of footsteps; and  there beyond is a dusty pillion which conjures up a picture of Mistress  Lane seated behind \"Will Jackson\" upon their way to Bristol. The ancient  glass and china, too, would whet the appetite of the most exacting  connoisseur. But we must not linger longer, or we shall envy these  choice possessions.    [Illustration: PIRTON COURT.]    [Illustration: SEVERN END.]    [Illustration: SEVERN END.]    Pirton Court, not far away, has not been plastered over like many houses  with elaborate wooden \"magpie\" work beneath, and the ornamental timber  in circular design is unimpaired. But the quaintest timber gables were  those at Severn End, the ancient seat of the Lechmeres, some five miles  to the south-west. Alas! that this ancient mansion should have been  destroyed by fire,--a loss as great as that of Clevedon or Ingestre,  greater, perhaps, as its architecture was so quaint: a delightful  mixture of the Tudor and Stuart periods to which it was no easy matter  to fix a date, for the timber portions looked much older than the  seventeenth century, when they were built by Sir Nicholas Lechmere, a  nephew of Sir Thomas Overbury, a worthy and learned judge whose  manuscripts give a very realistic peep into the domestic life of the  times and the orderly way in which his establishment was conducted. Both  front and back of the house were strikingly picturesque, but the front  was the most curious, half black and white angular gables and half  curved and rounded red-brick Jacobean gables. On either side of the  entrance porch were two great chimney-stacks, and in the corners where  the wings abutted, small square towers, one of which was sharpened to a  point like a lead pencil. At the back, facing smooth lawns (where the  judge used to sit and study), attached to the main building was what  looked like a distinct structure, the sort of overhanging half-timbered  house with carved barge-boards, pendants, and hip-knobs that are  familiar objects at Shrewsbury or Tewkesbury. The lower part of this was  of red-brick, and beside it on the right was a smaller abutting  half-timber gable. The great oak staircases had fantastic newels and  balusters, and around the panelled hall was a fixed oak settle, and  armour on the walls: carved oak cabinets and chairs, and tables. The  room in which Charles I. slept was pointed out, and that of  Major-General Massey, for Severn End was that great soldier's  headquarters before the battle of Worcester.    A few miles to the south-west, within the boundary of the once wild  district, Malvern Chase, is another remarkable old house, Birtsmorton  Court, a moated and fortified manor-house in a singularly good state of  preservation. Though quiet and peaceful enough, its embattled gateway  has a formidable look, showing the teeth of its portcullis, like a  bull-dog on the alert for intruders. The drawbridge is also there, and  walls of immense thickness, both speaking of the insecurity of the days  when it was built. The \"parlour,\" with windows looking out upon the  moat, is richly panelled with the various quarterings of the ancient  lords, the Nanfans, executed in colours around the cornice. The arms and  crest also occur upon the elaborately carved oak fireplace. On the  left-hand side of this fireplace there was formerly the entrance to a  hiding-place concealed in the wainscoting, but there is nothing now but  a very visible cupboard which leads nowhere. Tradition asserts that  Henry V.'s old associate, Sir John Oldcastle, sought refuge here before  he was captured and burned as a Lollard. But as that happened in 1417,  the date does not tally with the period to which the room belongs,  namely, a century later. But the original apartments have been divided  (some are dilapidated chambers, now used as a storeroom for Gloucester  cheeses), so that it is difficult to trace how they were placed. There  is also a story of a passage running beneath the moat into the adjacent  woods; but whether Sir John got so far, or whether after his escape from  the Tower he even got farther than his own castle of Cowling in Kent,  when he was hunted down by orders of his former boon companions, we  cannot say. By local report Edward IV. and Margaret of Anjou as well as  the little Lancastrian Prince of Wales sought shelter at Birtsmorton.  But for Margaret another house nearer Tewkesbury claims the honour of  offering a refuge from the battlefield. This is an old timber-framed  building with carved barge-boards, near the village of Bushley, called  Payne's Place, or Yew Tree Farm, which once belonged to Thomas Payne and  Ursula his wife, whose brasses may be seen in the church. In the eastern  wing of this old house Queen Margaret's bedroom is pointed out. The hall  with open timber roof is still intact but divided, and upon the oak  beams a century after the battle of Tewkesbury the following lines were  painted on a frieze:      \"To lyve as wee shoulde alwayes dye it were a goodly trade,    To change lowe Death for Lyfe so hye, no better change is made;    For all our worldly thynges are vayne, in them is there no truste,    Wee see all states awhyle remayne, and then they turn to duste.\"    Had the lines existed then, would the poor queen have derived comfort  when the news reached her of her son's death on the battlefield?    Birtsmorton is associated with the early career of Cardinal Wolsey, for  here he acted as chaplain during the retirement of Sir Richard Nanfan  from service to the State. Through Sir Richard's Court influence Wolsey  was promoted to the service of Henry VIII.    The \"Bloody Meadow\" near Birtsmorton must not be confused with that near  Tewkesbury, the scene of the last battle between the Houses of York and  Lancaster. This one was the scene of a single combat between a Nanfan  and his sister's lover, in which the latter was slain. The heart-broken  lady left a sum of money that a sermon should be annually preached at  Berrow church (the burial-place of the Nanfans) against duelling; and  this we believe is done to this day. The cruciform church has been  painfully restored, but contains a fine altar-tomb to Sir John, Sir  Richard Nanfan's grandfather, Squire of the Body to King Henry VI.; but  beyond a leper's window and a queer old alms-box there is nothing else  remarkable.    [Illustration: RIPPLE.]    Two of the prettiest villages hereabouts are Ripple and Strensham, the  former on the Severn, the latter on the Avon. At Ripple, in a cosy  corner backed by creeper-grown timber cottages, is the lofty stone shaft  of the cross, and by the steps at the base the stocks and whipping-post.  Strensham is famous as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/398"],[0,"The First Book of Adam and Eve (#12)"],[1,"it.    14 But God in His mercy, drove him from among us to this dark earth;  for he had become darkness itself and a worker of unrighteousness.    15 And he has continued, O Adam, to make war against you, until he  tricked you and made you come out of the garden, to this strange land,  where all these trials have come to you.  And death, which God brought  to him, he has also brought to you, O Adam, because you obeyed him, and  trespassed against God.\"    16 Then all the angels rejoiced and praised God, and asked Him not to  destroy Adam this time, for his having sought to enter the garden; but  to bear with him until the fulfillment of the promise; and to help him  in this world until he was free from Satan's hand.          Chapter LVI - A chapter of divine comfort.    1 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him:--    2 \"O Adam, look at that garden of joy and at this earth of toil, and  behold the garden is full of angels, but look at yourself alone on this  earth with Satan whom you obeyed.    3 Yet, if you had submitted, and been obedient to Me, and had kept My  Word, you would be with My angels in My garden.    4 But when you transgressed and obeyed Satan, you became his guests  among his angels, that are full of wickedness; and you came to this  earth, that brings forth to you thorns and thistles.    5 O Adam, ask him who deceived you, to give you the divine nature he  promised you, or to make you a garden as I had made for you; or to fill  you with that same bright nature with which I had filled you.    6 Ask him to make you a body like the one I made you, or to give you a  day of rest as I gave you; or to create within you a reasonable soul,  as I created for you; or to take you from here to some other earth than  this one which I gave you.  But, O Adam, he will not fulfil even one of  the things he told you.    7 Acknowledge, then, My favor towards you, and My mercy on you, My  creature; that I have not avenged you for your transgression against  Me, but in My pity for you I have promised you that at the end of the  great five and a half days I will come and save you.\"    8 Then God said again to Adam and Eve, \"Get up, go down from here,  before the cherub with a sword of fire in his hand destroys you.\"    9 But Adam's heart was comforted by God's words to him, and he  worshipped before Him.    10 And God commanded His angels to escort Adam and Eve to the cave with  joy, instead of the fear that had come over them.    11 Then the angels took up Adam and Eve, and brought them down from the  mountain by the garden, with songs and psalms, until they arrived at  the cave.  There the angels began to comfort and to strengthen them,  and then departed from them towards heaven, to their Creator, who had  sent them.    12 But after the angels had departed from Adam and Eve, Satan came with  shamefacedness, and stood at the entrance of the cave in which were  Adam and Eve.  He then called to Adam, and said, \"O Adam, come, let me  speak to you.\"    13 Then Adam came out of the cave, thinking he was one of God's angels  that was come to give him some good counsel.          Chapter LVII - \"Therefore I fell. . . . \"    1 But when Adam came out and saw his hideous figure, he was afraid of  him, and said to him, \"Who are you?\"    2 Then Satan answered and said to him, \"It is I, who hid myself within  the serpent, and who spoke to Eve, and who enticed her until she obeyed  my command.  I am he who sent her, using my deceitful speech, to  deceive you,  until you both ate of the fruit of the tree and abandoned  the command of God.\"    3 But when Adam heard these words from him, he said to him, \"Can you  make me a garden as God made for me?  Or can you clothe me in the same  bright nature in which God had clothed me?    4 Where is the divine nature you promised to give me?  Where is that  slick speech of yours that you had with us at first, when we were in  the garden?\"    5 Then Satan said to Adam, \"Do you think that when I have promised one  something that I would actually deliver it to him or fulfil my word?  Of course not.  For I myself have never even thought of obtaining what  I promised.    6 Therefore I fell, and I made you fall by that for which I myself  fell; and with you also, whosoever accepts my counsel, falls thereby.    7 But now, O Adam, because you fell you are under my rule, and I am  king over you; because you have obeyed me and have transgressed against  your God.  Neither will there be any deliverance from my hands until  the day promised you by your God.\"    8 Again he said, \"Because we do not know the day agreed on with you by  your God, nor the hour in which you shall be delivered, for that reason  we will multiply war and murder on you and your descendants after you.    9 This is our will and our good pleasure, that we may not leave one of  the sons of men to inherit our orders in heaven.    10 For as to our home, O Adam, it is in burning fire; and we will not  stop our evil doing, no, not one day nor one hour.  And I, O Adam,  shall set you on fire when you come into the cave to live there.\"    11 When Adam heard these words he cried and mourned, and said to Eve,  \"Hear what he said; that he won't fulfil any of what he told you in the  garden.  Did he really then become king over us?    12 But we will ask God, who created us, to deliver us out of his hands.\"          Chapter LVIII - \"About sunset on the 53rd day. . .\"    1 Then Adam and Eve spread their hands before God, praying and begging  Him to drive Satan away from them so that he can't harm them or force  them to deny God.    2 Then God sent to them at once, His angel, who drove away Satan from  them.  This happened about sunset, on the fifty-third day after they  had come out of the garden.    3 Then Adam and Eve went into the cave, and stood up and turned their  faces to the ground, to pray to God.    4 But before they prayed Adam said to Eve, \"Look, you have seen what  temptations have befallen us in this land.  Come, let us get up, and  ask God to forgive us the sins we have committed; and we will not come  out until the end of the day next to the fortieth.  And if we die in  here, He will save us.\"    5 Then Adam and Eve got up, and joined together in entreating God.    6 They continued praying like this in the cave; neither did they come  out of it, by night or by day, until their prayers went up out of their  mouths, like a flame of fire.          Chapter LIX - Eighth apparition of Satan of Satan to Adam and Eve.    1 But Satan, the hater of all good, did not allow them to finish their  prayers.  For he called to his hosts, and they came, all of them.  Then  he said to them, \"Since Adam and Eve, whom we deceived, have agreed  together to pray to God night and day, and to beg Him to deliver them,  and since they will not come out of the cave until the end of the  fortieth day.    2 And since they will continue their prayers as they have both agreed  to do, that He will deliver them out of our hands, and restore them to  their former state, see what we shall do to them.\"  And his hosts said  to him, \"Power is thine, O our lord, to do what you list.\"    3 Then Satan, great in wickedness, took his hosts and came into the  cave, in the thirtieth night of the forty days and one; and he beat  Adam and Eve, until he left them dead.    4 Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, who raised them from their  suffering, and God said to Adam, \"Be strong, and be not afraid of him  who has just come to you.\"    5 But Adam cried and said, \"Where were you, O my God, that they should  punish me with such blows, and that this suffering should come over us;  over me and over Eve, Your handmaiden?\"    6 Then God said to him, \"O Adam, see, he is lord and master of all you  have, he who said, he would give you divinity.  Where is this love for  you?  And where is the gift he promised?    7 Did it please him just once, O Adam, to come to you, comfort you,  strengthen you, rejoice with you, or send his hosts to protect you;  because you have obeyed him, and have yielded to his counsel; and have  followed his commandment and transgressed Mine?\"    8 Then Adam cried before the Lord, and said, \"O Lord because I  transgressed a little, You have severely punished me in return for it,  I ask You to deliver me out of his hands; or else have pity on me, and  take my soul out of my body now in this strange land.\"    9 Then God said to Adam, \"If only there had been this sighing and  praying before, before you transgressed!  Then would you have rest from  the trouble in which you are now.\"    10 But God had patience with Adam, and let him and Eve remain in the  cave until they had fulfilled the forty days.    11 But as to Adam and Eve, their strength and flesh withered from  fasting and praying, from hunger and thirst; for they had not tasted  either food or drink since they left the garden; nor were the functions  of their bodies yet settled; and they had no strength left to continue  in prayer from hunger, until the end of the next day to the fortieth.  They were fallen down in the cave; yet what speech escaped from their  mouths, was only in praises.          Chapter LX - The Devil appears like an old man.  He offers \"a place of  rest.\"    1 Then on the eighty-ninth day, Satan came to the cave, clad in a  garment of light, and girt about with a bright girdle.    2 In his hands was a staff of light, and he looked most awful; but his  face was pleasant and his speech was sweet.    3 He thus transformed himself in order to deceive Adam and Eve, and to  make them come out of the cave, before they had fulfilled the forty  days.    4 For he said within himself, \"Now that when they had fulfilled the  forty days' fasting and praying, God would restore them to their former  state; but if He did not do so, He would still be favorable to them;  and even if He had not mercy on them, would He yet give them something  from the garden to comfort them; as already"]]]
