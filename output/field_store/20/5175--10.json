Gunnar was there half a month.  The king  made himself sport by letting Gunnar prove himself in divers  feats of strength against his men, and there were none that were  his match even in one feat.    Then the king said to Gunnar, \"It seems to me as though thy peer  is not to be found far or near,\" and the king offered to get  Gunnar a wife, and to raise him to great power if he would settle  down there.    Gunnar thanked the king for his offer and said, \"I will first of  all sail back to Iceland to see my friends and kinsfolk.\"    \"Then thou wilt never come back to us,\" says the king.    \"Fate will settle that, lord,\" says Gunnar.    Gunnar gave the king a good long-ship, and much goods besides,  and the king gave him a robe of honour, and golden-seamed gloves,  and a fillet with a knot of gold on it, and a Russian hat.    Then Gunnar fared north to Hisingen.  Oliver welcomed him with  both hands, and he gave back to Oliver his ships, with their  lading, and said that was his share of the spoil.  Oliver took  the goods, and said Gunnar was a good man and true, and bade him  stay with him some while.  Hallvard asked Gunnar if he had a mind  to go to see Earl Hacon.  Gunnar said that was near his heart,  \"for now I am somewhat proved, but then I was not tried at all  when thou badest me do this before.\"    After that they fared north to Drontheim to see Earl Hacon, and  he gave Gunnar a hearty welcome, and bade him stay with him that  winter, and Gunnar took that offer, and every man thought him a  man of great worth.  At Yule the Earl gave him a gold ring.    Gunnar set his heart on Bergliota, the Earl's kinswoman, and it  was often to be seen from the Earl's way, that he would have  given her to him to wife if Gunnar had said anything about that.        32. GUNNAR COMES OUT TO ICELAND    When the spring came, the Earl asks Gunnar what course he meant  to take.  He said he would go to Iceland.  The Earl said that had  been a bad year for grain, \"and there will be little sailing out  to Iceland, but still thou shalt have meal and timber both in thy  ship.\"    Gunnar fitted out his ship as early as he could, and Hallvard  fared out with him and Kolskegg.  They came out early in the  summer, and made Arnbael's Oyce before the Thing met.    Gunnar rode home from the ship, but got men to strip her and lay  her up.  But when they came home all men were glad to see them.  They were blithe and merry to their household, nor had their  haughtiness grown while they were away.    Gunnar asks if Njal were at home; and he was told that he was at  home; then he let them saddle his horse, and those brothers rode  over to Bergthorsknoll.    Njal was glad at their coming, and begged them to stay there that  night, and Gunnar told him of his voyages.    Njal said he was a man of the greatest mark, \"and thou hast been  much proved; but still thou wilt be more tried hereafter; for  many will envy thee.\"    \"With all men I would wish to stand well,\" says Gunnar.    \"Much bad will happen,\" said Njal, \"and thou wilt always have  some quarrel to ward off.\"    \"So be it, then,\" says Gunnar, \"so that I have a good ground on  my side.\"    \"So will it be too,\" says Njal, \"if thou hast not to smart for  others.\"    Njal asked Gunnar if he would ride to the Thing.  Gunnar said he  was going to ride thither, and asks Njal whether he were going to  ride; but he said he would not ride thither, \"and if I had my  will thou wouldst do the like.\"    Gunnar rode home, and gave Njal good gifts, and thanked him for  the care he had taken of his goods.  Kolskegg urged him on much  to ride to the Thing, saying, \"There thy honour will grow, for  many will flock to see thee there.\"    \"That has been little to my mind,\" says Gunnar, \"to make a show  of myself; but I think it good and right to meet good and worthy  men.\"    Hallvard by this time was also come thither, and offered to ride  to the Thing with them.        33. GUNNAR'S WOOING    So Gunnar rode, and they all rode.  But when they came to the  Thing they were so well arrayed that none could match them in  bravery; and men came out of every booth to wonder at them.  Gunnar rode to the booths of the men of Rangriver, and was there  with his kinsmen.  Many men came to see Gunnar, and ask tidings  of him; and he was easy and merry to all men, and told them all  they wished to hear.    It happened one day that Gunnar went away from the Hill of Laws,  and passed by the booths of the men from Mossfell; then he saw a  woman coming to meet him, and she was in goodly attire; but when  they met she spoke to Gunnar at once.  He took her greeting well,  and asks what woman she might be.  She told him her name was  Hallgerda, and said she was Hauskuld's daughter, Dalakoll's son.  She spoke up boldly to him, and bade him tell her of his voyages;  but he said he would not gainsay her a talk.  Then they sat them  down and talked.  She was so clad that she had on a red kirtle,  and had thrown over her a scarlet cloak trimmed with needlework  down to the waist.  Her hair came down to her bosom, and was both  fair and full.  Gunnar was clad in the scarlet clothes which King  Harold Gorm's son had given him; he had also the gold ring on his  arm which Earl Hacon had given him.    So they talked long out loud, and at last it came about that he  asked whether she were unmarried.  She said, so it was, \"and  there are not many who would run the risk of that.\"    \"Thinkest thou none good enough for thee?\"    \"Not that,\" she says, \"but I am said to be hard to please in  husbands.\"    \"How wouldst thou answer, were I to ask for thee?\"    \"That cannot be in thy mind,\" she says.    \"It is though,\" says he.    \"If thou hast any mind that way, go and see my father.\"    After that they broke off their talk.    Gunnar went straightway to the Dalesmen's booths, and met a man  outside the doorway, and asks whether Hauskuld were inside the  booth?    The man says that he was.  Then Gunnar went in, and Hauskuld and  Hrut made him welcome.  He sat down between them, and no one  could find out from their talk that there had ever been any  misunderstanding between them.  At last Gunnar's speech turned  thither; how these brothers would answer if he asked for  Hallgerda?    \"Well,\" says Hauskuld, \"if that is indeed thy mind.\"    Gunnar says that he is in earnest, \"but we so parted last time,  that many would think it unlikely that we should ever be bound  together.\"    \"How thinkest thou, kinsman Hrut?\" says Hauskuld.    Hrut answered, \"Methinks this is no even match.\"    \"How dost thou make that out?\" says Gunnar.    Hrut spoke, \"In this wise will I answer thee about this matter,  as is the very truth.  Thou art a brisk brave man well to do, and  unblemished; but she is much mixed up with ill report, and I will  not cheat thee in anything.\"    \"Good go with thee for thy words,\" says Gunnar, \"but still I  shall hold that for true, that the old feud weighs with ye, if ye  will not let me make this match.\"    \"Not so,\" says Hrut, \"'t is more because I see that thou art  unable to help thyself; but though we make no bargain, we would  still be thy friends.\"    \"I have talked to her about it,\" says Gunnar, \"and it is not far  from her mind.\"    Hrut says, \"I know that you have both set your hearts on this  match; and, besides, ye two are those who run the most risk as to  how it turns out.\"    Hrut told Gunnar unasked all about Hallgerda's temper, and Gunnar  at first thought that there was more than enough that was  wanting; but at last it came about that they struck a bargain.    Then Hallgerda was sent for, and they talked over the business  when she was by, and now, as before, they made her betroth  herself.  The bridal feast was to be at Lithend, and at first  they were to set about it secretly; but the end after all was  that every one knew of it.    Gunnar rode home from the Thing, and came to Bergthorsknoll, and  told Njal of the bargain he had made.  He took it heavily.    Gunnar asks Njal why he thought this so unwise?    \"Because from her,\" says Njal, \"will arise all kind of ill if  she comes hither east.\"    \"Never shall she spoil our friendship,\" says Gunnar.    \"Ah!  but yet that may come very near,\" says Njal; \"and, besides,  thou wilt have always to make atonement for her.\"    Gunnar asked Njal to the wedding, and all those as well whom he  wished should be at it from Njal's house.    Njal promised to go; and after that Gunnar rode home, and then  rode about the district to bid men to his wedding.        34. OF THRAIN SIGFUS' SON    There was a man named Thrain, he was the son of Sigfus, the son  of Sighvat the Red.  He kept house at Gritwater on Fleetlithe.  He was Gunnar's kinsman, and a man of great mark.  He had to wife  Thorhillda Skaldwife; she had a sharp tongue of her own, and was  given to jeering.  Thrain loved her little.  He and his wife were  bidden to the wedding, and she and Bergthora, Skarphedinn's  daughter, Njal's wife, waited on the guests with meat and drink.    Kettle was the name of the second son of Sigfus; he kept house in  the Mark, east of Markfleet.  He had to wife Thorgerda, Njal's  daughter.  Thorkell was the name of the third son of Sigfus; the  fourth's name was Mord; the fifth's Lambi; the sixth's Sigmund;  the seventh's Sigurd.  These were all Gunnar's kinsmen, and great  champions.  Gunnar bade them all to the wedding.    Gunnar had also bidden Valgard the Guileful, and Wolf Aurpriest,  and their sons Runolf and Mord.    Hauskuld and Hrut came to the wedding with a very great company,  and the sons of Hauskuld, Thorleik, and Olof, were there; the  bride, too, came along with them, and her daughter Thorgerda came  also, and she was one of the fairest of women; she was then  fourteen winters old.  Many other women were with her, and  besides"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],[0,"Vanity Fair (#12)"],[1," possessor of every perfection, to be the handsomest, the bravest, the  most active, the cleverest, the most generous of created boys.  He  shared his money with him: bought him uncountable presents of knives,  pencil-cases, gold seals, toffee, Little Warblers, and romantic books,  with large coloured pictures of knights and robbers, in many of which  latter you might read inscriptions to George Sedley Osborne, Esquire,  from his attached friend William Dobbin--the which tokens of homage  George received very graciously, as became his superior merit.    So that Lieutenant Osborne, when coming to Russell Square on the day of  the Vauxhall party, said to the ladies, \"Mrs. Sedley, Ma'am, I hope you  have room; I've asked Dobbin of ours to come and dine here, and go with  us to Vauxhall.  He's almost as modest as Jos.\"    \"Modesty! pooh,\" said the stout gentleman, casting a vainqueur look at  Miss Sharp.    \"He is--but you are incomparably more graceful, Sedley,\" Osborne added,  laughing.  \"I met him at the Bedford, when I went to look for you; and  I told him that Miss Amelia was come home, and that we were all bent on  going out for a night's pleasuring; and that Mrs. Sedley had forgiven  his breaking the punch-bowl at the child's party. Don't you remember  the catastrophe, Ma'am, seven years ago?\"    \"Over Mrs. Flamingo's crimson silk gown,\" said good-natured Mrs.  Sedley.  \"What a gawky it was! And his sisters are not much more  graceful.  Lady Dobbin was at Highbury last night with three of them.  Such figures! my dears.\"    \"The Alderman's very rich, isn't he?\" Osborne said archly.  \"Don't you  think one of the daughters would be a good spec for me, Ma'am?\"    \"You foolish creature! Who would take you, I should like to know, with  your yellow face?\"    \"Mine a yellow face? Stop till you see Dobbin.  Why, he had the yellow  fever three times; twice at Nassau, and once at St. Kitts.\"    \"Well, well; yours is quite yellow enough for us.  Isn't it, Emmy?\"  Mrs. Sedley said: at which speech Miss Amelia only made a smile and a  blush; and looking at Mr. George Osborne's pale interesting  countenance, and those beautiful black, curling, shining whiskers,  which the young gentleman himself regarded with no ordinary  complacency, she thought in her little heart that in His Majesty's  army, or in the wide world, there never was such a face or such a hero.  \"I don't care about Captain Dobbin's complexion,\" she said, \"or about  his awkwardness. I shall always like him, I know,\" her little reason  being, that he was the friend and champion of George.    \"There's not a finer fellow in the service,\" Osborne said, \"nor a  better officer, though he is not an Adonis, certainly.\" And he looked  towards the glass himself with much naivete; and in so doing, caught  Miss Sharp's eye fixed keenly upon him, at which he blushed a little,  and Rebecca thought in her heart, \"Ah, mon beau Monsieur! I think I  have YOUR gauge\"--the little artful minx!    That evening, when Amelia came tripping into the drawing-room in a  white muslin frock, prepared for conquest at Vauxhall, singing like a  lark, and as fresh as a rose--a very tall ungainly gentleman, with  large hands and feet, and large ears, set off by a closely cropped head  of black hair, and in the hideous military frogged coat and cocked hat  of those times, advanced to meet her, and made her one of the clumsiest  bows that was ever performed by a mortal.    This was no other than Captain William Dobbin, of His Majesty's  Regiment of Foot, returned from yellow fever, in the West Indies, to  which the fortune of the service had ordered his regiment, whilst so  many of his gallant comrades were reaping glory in the Peninsula.    He had arrived with a knock so very timid and quiet that it was  inaudible to the ladies upstairs: otherwise, you may be sure Miss  Amelia would never have been so bold as to come singing into the room.  As it was, the sweet fresh little voice went right into the Captain's  heart, and nestled there.  When she held out her hand for him to shake,  before he enveloped it in his own, he paused, and thought--\"Well, is it  possible--are you the little maid I remember in the pink frock, such a  short time ago--the night I upset the punch-bowl, just after I was  gazetted? Are you the little girl that George Osborne said should marry  him?  What a blooming young creature you seem, and what a prize the  rogue has got!\" All this he thought, before he took Amelia's hand into  his own, and as he let his cocked hat fall.    His history since he left school, until the very moment when we have  the pleasure of meeting him again, although not fully narrated, has  yet, I think, been indicated sufficiently for an ingenious reader by  the conversation in the last page.  Dobbin, the despised grocer, was  Alderman Dobbin--Alderman Dobbin was Colonel of the City Light Horse,  then burning with military ardour to resist the French Invasion.  Colonel Dobbin's corps, in which old Mr. Osborne himself was but an  indifferent corporal, had been reviewed by the Sovereign and the Duke  of York; and the colonel and alderman had been knighted.  His son had  entered the army: and young Osborne followed presently in the same  regiment.  They had served in the West Indies and in Canada.  Their  regiment had just come home, and the attachment of Dobbin to George  Osborne was as warm and generous now as it had been when the two were  schoolboys.    So these worthy people sat down to dinner presently. They talked about  war and glory, and Boney and Lord Wellington, and the last Gazette.  In  those famous days every gazette had a victory in it, and the two  gallant young men longed to see their own names in the glorious list,  and cursed their unlucky fate to belong to a regiment which had been  away from the chances of honour.  Miss Sharp kindled with this exciting  talk, but Miss Sedley trembled and grew quite faint as she heard it.  Mr. Jos told several of his tiger-hunting stories, finished the one  about Miss Cutler and Lance the surgeon; helped Rebecca to everything  on the table, and himself gobbled and drank a great deal.    He sprang to open the door for the ladies, when they retired, with the  most killing grace--and coming back to the table, filled himself bumper  after bumper of claret, which he swallowed with nervous rapidity.    \"He's priming himself,\" Osborne whispered to Dobbin, and at length the  hour and the carriage arrived for Vauxhall.        CHAPTER VI    Vauxhall    I know that the tune I am piping is a very mild one (although there are  some terrific chapters coming presently), and must beg the good-natured  reader to remember that we are only discoursing at present about a  stockbroker's family in Russell Square, who are taking walks, or  luncheon, or dinner, or talking and making love as people do in common  life, and without a single passionate and wonderful incident to mark  the progress of their loves.  The argument stands thus--Osborne, in  love with Amelia, has asked an old friend to dinner and to  Vauxhall--Jos Sedley is in love with Rebecca.  Will he marry her? That  is the great subject now in hand.    We might have treated this subject in the genteel, or in the romantic,  or in the facetious manner.  Suppose we had laid the scene in Grosvenor  Square, with the very same adventures--would not some people have  listened? Suppose we had shown how Lord Joseph Sedley fell in love, and  the Marquis of Osborne became attached to Lady Amelia, with the full  consent of the Duke, her noble father: or instead of the supremely  genteel, suppose we had resorted to the entirely low, and described  what was going on in Mr. Sedley's kitchen--how black Sambo was in love  with the cook (as indeed he was), and how he fought a battle with the  coachman in her behalf; how the knife-boy was caught stealing a cold  shoulder of mutton, and Miss Sedley's new femme de chambre refused to  go to bed without a wax candle; such incidents might be made to provoke  much delightful laughter, and be supposed to represent scenes of  \"life.\" Or if, on the contrary, we had taken a fancy for the terrible,  and made the lover of the new femme de chambre a professional burglar,  who bursts into the house with his band, slaughters black Sambo at the  feet of his master, and carries off Amelia in her night-dress, not to  be let loose again till the third volume, we should easily have  constructed a tale of thrilling interest, through the fiery chapters of  which the reader should hurry, panting.  But my readers must hope for  no such romance, only a homely story, and must be content with a  chapter about Vauxhall, which is so short that it scarce deserves to be  called a chapter at all.  And yet it is a chapter, and a very important  one too.  Are not there little chapters in everybody's life, that seem  to be nothing, and yet affect all the rest of the history?    Let us then step into the coach with the Russell Square party, and be  off to the Gardens.  There is barely room between Jos and Miss Sharp,  who are on the front seat.  Mr. Osborne sitting bodkin opposite,  between Captain Dobbin and Amelia.    Every soul in the coach agreed that on that night Jos would propose to  make Rebecca Sharp Mrs. Sedley.  The parents at home had acquiesced in  the arrangement, though, between ourselves, old Mr. Sedley had a  feeling very much akin to contempt for his son.  He said he was vain,  selfish, lazy, and effeminate.  He could not endure his airs as a man  of fashion, and laughed heartily at his pompous braggadocio stories.  \"I shall leave the fellow half my property,\" he said; \"and he will  have, besides, plenty of his own; but as I am perfectly sure that if  you, and I, and his sister were to die to-morrow, he would say 'Good  Gad!' and eat his dinner just as well as usual, I am not going to make  myself anxious about him. Let him marry whom he likes.  It's no affair  of mine.\"    Amelia, on the other"]]]
