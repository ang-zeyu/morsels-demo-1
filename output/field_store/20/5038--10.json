What, me, too?\"    \"Sure. You're my link with--I don't want to have you remembering  that address in the second month of a ten-year stretch at Dartmoor  Prison. I'm going to look after you, Spike, my son, like a lynx.  We'll go out together, and see life. Brace up, Spike. Be cheerful.  Grin!\"    After a moment's reflection, the other grinned, albeit faintly.    \"That's right,\" said Jimmy. \"We'll go into society, Spike, hand in  hand. You'll be a terrific success in society. All you have to do is  to look cheerful, brush your hair, and keep your hands off the  spoons. For in the best circles they invariably count them after the  departure of the last guest.\"    \"Sure,\" said Spike, as one who thoroughly understood this sensible  precaution.    \"And, now,\" said Jimmy, \"we'll be turning in. Can you manage  sleeping on the sofa one night? Some fellows would give their bed up  to you. Not me, however. I'll have a bed made up for you tomorrow.\"    \"Me!\" said Spike. \"Gee! I've been sleepin' in de Park all de last  week. Dis is to de good, boss.\"          CHAPTER XI    AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD      Next morning, when Jimmy, having sent Spike off to the tailor's,  with instructions to get a haircut en route, was dealing with a  combination of breakfast and luncheon at his flat, Lord Dreever  called.    \"Thought I should find you in,\" observed his lordship. \"Well,  laddie, how goes it? Having breakfast? Eggs and bacon! Great Scott!  I couldn't touch a thing.\"    The statement was borne out by his looks. The son of a hundred earls  was pale, and his eyes were markedly fish-like.    \"A fellow I've got stopping with me--taking him down to Dreever with  me to-day--man I met at the club--fellow named Hargate. Don't know  if you know him? No? Well, he was still up when I got back last  night, and we stayed up playing billiards--he's rotten at billiards;  something frightful: I give him twenty--till five this morning. I  feel fearfully cheap. Wouldn't have got up at all, only I'm due to  catch the two-fifteen down to Dreever. It's the only good train.\" He  dropped into a chair.    \"Sorry you don't feel up to breakfast,\" said Jimmy, helping himself  to marmalade. \"I am generally to be found among those lining up when  the gong goes. I've breakfasted on a glass of water and a bag of  bird-seed in my time. That sort of thing makes you ready to take  whatever you can get. Seen the paper?\"    \"Thanks.\"    Jimmy finished his breakfast, and lighted a pipe. Lord Dreever laid  down the paper.    \"I say,\" he said, \"what I came round about was this. What have you  got on just now?\"    Jimmy had imagined that his friend had dropped in to return the  five-pound note he had borrowed, but his lordship maintained a  complete reserve on the subject. Jimmy was to discover later that  this weakness of memory where financial obligations were concerned  was a leading trait in Lord Dreever's character.    \"To-day, do you mean?\" said Jimmy.    \"Well, in the near future. What I mean is, why not put off that  Japan trip you spoke about, and come down to Dreever with me?\"    Jimmy reflected. After all, Japan or Dreever, it made very little  difference. And it would be interesting to see a place about which  he had read so much.    \"That's very good of you,\" he said. \"You're sure it will be all  right? It won't be upsetting your arrangements?\"    \"Not a bit. The more the merrier. Can you catch the two-fifteen?  It's fearfully short notice.\"    \"Heavens, yes. I can pack in ten minutes. Thanks very much.\"    \"Good business. There'll be shooting and all that sort of rot. Oh,  and by the way, are you any good at acting? I mean, there are going  to be private theatricals of sorts. A man called Charteris insisted  on getting them up--always getting up theatricals. Rot, I call it;  but you can't stop him. Do you do anything in that line?\"    \"Put me down for what you like, from Emperor of Morocco to Confused  Noise Without. I was on the stage once. I'm particularly good at  shifting scenery.\"    \"Good for you. Well, so long. Two-fifteen from Paddington, remember.  I'll meet you there. I've got to go and see a fellow now.\"    \"I'll look out for you.\"    A sudden thought occurred to Jimmy. Spike! He had forgotten Spike  for the moment. It was vital that the Bowery boy should not be lost  sight of again. He was the one link with the little house somewhere  beyond One Hundred and Fiftieth Street. He could not leave the  Bowery boy at the flat. A vision rose in his mind of Spike alone in  London, with Savoy Mansions as a base for his operations. No, Spike  must be transplanted to the country. But Jimmy could not seem to see  Spike in the country. His boredom would probably be pathetic. But it  was the only way.    Lord Dreever facilitated matters.    \"By the way, Pitt,\" he said, \"you've got a man of sorts, of course?  One of those frightful fellows who forgot to pack your collars?  Bring him along, of course.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Jimmy. \"I will.\"    The matter had scarcely been settled when the door opened, and  revealed the subject of discussion. Wearing a broad grin of mingled  pride and bashfulness, and looking very stiff and awkward in one of  the brightest tweed suits ever seen off the stage, Spike stood for a  moment in the doorway to let his appearance sink into the spectator,  then advanced into the room.    \"How do dese strike you, boss?\" he inquired genially, as Lord  Dreever gaped in astonishment at this bright being.    \"Pretty nearly blind, Spike,\" said Jimmy. \"What made you get those?  We use electric light here.\"    Spike was full of news.    \"Say, boss, dat clothin'-store's a willy wonder, sure. De old mug  what showed me round give me de frozen face when I come in foist.  'What's doin'?' he says. 'To de woods wit' you. Git de hook!' But I  hauls out de plunks you give me, an' tells him how I'm here to get a  dude suit, an', gee! if he don't haul out suits by de mile. Give me  a toist, it did, watching him. 'It's up to youse,' says de mug.  'Choose somet'in'. You pays de money, an' we does de rest.' So, I  says dis is de one, an' I put down de plunks, an' here I am, boss.\"    \"I noticed that, Spike,\" said Jimmy. \"I could see you in the dark.\"    \"Don't you like de duds, boss?\" inquired Spike, anxiously.    \"They're great,\" said Jimmy. \"You'd make Solomon in all his glory  look like a tramp 'cyclist.\"    \"Dat's right,\" agreed Spike. \"Dey'se de limit.\"    And, apparently oblivious to the presence of Lord Dreever, who had  been watching him in blank silence since his entrance, the Bowery  boy proceeded to execute a mysterious shuffling dance on the carpet.    This was too much for the overwrought brain of his lordship.    \"Good-bye, Pitt,\" he said, \"I'm off. Got to see a man.\"    Jimmy saw his guest to the door.    Outside, Lord Dreever placed the palm of his right hand on his  forehead.    \"I say, Pitt,\" he said.    \"Hullo?\"    \"Who the devil's that?\"    \"Who? Spike? Oh, that's my man.\"    \"Your man! Is he always like that? I mean, going on like a frightful  music-hall comedian? Dancing, you know! And, I say, what on earth  language was that he was talking? I couldn't understand one word in  ten.\"    \"Oh, that's American, the Bowery variety.\"    \"Oh, well, I suppose it's all right if you understand it. I  can't. By gad,\" he broke off, with a chuckle, \"I'd give something to  see him talking to old Saunders, our butler at home. He's got the  manners of a duke.\"    \"Spike should revise those,\" said Jimmy.    \"What do you call him?\"    \"Spike.\"    \"Rummy name, isn't it?\"    \"Oh, I don't know. Short for Algernon.\"    \"He seemed pretty chummy.\"    \"That's his independent bringing-up. We're all like that in  America.\"    \"Well, so long.\"    \"So long.\"    On the bottom step, Lord Dreever halted.    \"I say. I've got it!\"    \"Good for you. Got what?\"    \"Why, I knew I'd seen that chap's face somewhere before, only I  couldn't place him. I've got him now. He's the Johnny who came into  the shelter last night. Chap you gave a quid to.\"    Spike's was one of those faces that, without being essentially  beautiful, stamp themselves on the memory.    \"You're quite right,\" said Jimmy. \"I was wondering if you would  recognize him. The fact is, he's a man I once employed over in New  York, and, when I came across him over here, he was so evidently  wanting a bit of help that I took him on again. As a matter of fact,  I needed somebody to look after my things, and Spike can do it as  well as anybody else.\"    \"I see. Not bad my spotting him, was it? Well, I must be off. Good-bye.  Two-fifteen at Paddington. Meet you there. Take a ticket for  Dreever if you're there before me.\"    \"Eight. Good-bye.\"    Jimmy returned to the dining-room. Spike, who was examining as much  as he could of himself in the glass, turned round with his wonted  grin.    \"Say, who's de gazebo, boss? Ain't he de mug youse was wit' last  night?\"    \"That's the man. We're going down with him to the country to-day,  Spike, so be ready.\"    \"On your way, boss. What's dat?\"    \"He has invited us to his country house, and we're going.\"    \"What? Bot'of us?\"    \"Yes. I told him you were my servant. I hope you aren't offended.\"    \"Nit. What's dere to be raw about, boss?\"    \"That's all right. Well, we'd better be packing. We have to be at  the station at two.\"    \"Sure.\"    \"And, Spike!\"    \"Yes, boss?\"    \"Did you get any other clothes besides what you've got on?\"    \"Nit. What do I want wit more dan one dude suit?\"    \"I approve of your rugged simplicity,\" said Jimmy, \"but what you're  wearing is a town suit. Excellent for the Park or the Marchioness's  Thursday crush, but essentially metropolitan. You must get something  else for the country, something dark and quiet. I'll come and help  you choose it, now.\"    \"Why, won't dis go in de country?\"    \"Not on your life, Spike. It would unsettle the rustic mind."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40780"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#12)"],[1,"attendance or  enforcing their orders, except by outlawing the offender, that is,  putting him outside the protection of the law, so that anyone might  kill him with impunity. In grave cases, a special expedition could be  called against an offender.    The individual wronged had his choice of payment in money or engaging  in a blood feud. The sums of money of the system of bot, wer, and wite  were enormous, and often could not be paid. Then a man could be  declared outlaw or sold as a slave. If a person was outlawed, he also  forfeited all his goods to the king.            Cases of general importance concerned mayslaying, wounding, and  cattle-stealing.            A person convicted of murder, i.e. killing by stealth or  robbery [taking from a person's robe, that is, his person or breaking  into his home to steal] could be hung and his possessions confiscated.    A man had a self-help right to arrest a thief hand-habbende [a thief  found with the stolen goods in his hands] and a thief back-berend [a  thief found with the stolen goods on his back or about his person].            Any inanimate or animate object or personal chattel which was  found by a court to be the immediate cause of death was forfeited as  \"deodand\", for instance, a tree from which a man fell to his death, a  beast which killed a man, a sword of a third party not the slayer that  was used to kill a man. The deodand was to go to the dead man's kin so  they could wreak their vengeance on it, which in turn would cause the  dead man to lie in peace.            This is a lawsuit regarding rights to feed pigs in a certain  woodland: \"In the year 825 which had passed since the birth of Christ,  and in the course of the second Indiction, and during the reign of  Beornwulf, King of Mercia, a council meeting was held in the famous  place called Clofesho, and there the said King Beornwulf and his  bishops and his earls and all the councilors of this nation were  assembled. Then there was a very noteworthy suit about wood pasture at  Sinton, towards the west in Scirhylte. The reeves in charge of the  pigherds wished to extend the pasture farther, and take in more of the  wood than the ancient rights permitted. Then the bishop and the  advisors of the community said that they would not admit liability for  more than had been appointed in AEthelbald's day, namely mast for 300  swine, and that the bishop and the community should have two thirds of  the wood and of the mast. The Archbishop Wulfred and all the councilors  determined that the bishop and the community might declare on oath that  it was so appointed in AEthelbald's time and that they were not trying  to obtain more, and the bishop immediately gave security to Earl  Eadwulf to furnish the oath before all the councilors, and it was  produced in 30 days at the bishop's see at Worcester. At that time Hama  was the reeve in charge of the pigherds at Sinton, and he rode until he  reached Worcester, and watched and observed the oath, as Earl Eadwulf  bade him, but did not challenge it. Here are the names and designations  of those who were assembled at the council meeting ...\"                           Chapter 3                     The Times: 900-1066            There were many large landholders such as the King, earls, and  bishops. Earls were noblemen by birth, and often relatives of the King.  They were his army commanders and the highest civil officials, each  responsible for a shire. A breach of the public peace of an earl would  occasion a fine. Lower in social status were freemen: sokemen, and  then, in decreasing order, villani [villeins], bordarii, and cottarii.  The servi were the slaves. Probably all who were not slaves were  freemen.            Kings typically granted land in exchange for services of  military duties, maintaining fortresses, and repairing bridges. Less  common services required by landlords include equipping a guard ship  and guarding the coast, guarding the lord, military watch, maintaining  the deer fence at the King's residence, alms giving, and church dues.  Since this land was granted in return for service, there were  limitations on its heritability and often an heir had to pay a heriot  to the landlord to obtain the land. A heriot was originally the weapons  and armor of a man killed, which went to the King. The heriot of a  thegn who had soken [or jurisdiction over their own lands] came to be  about 80s.; of a kings' thegn about four lances, two coats of mail, two  swords, and 125s.; of an earl about eight horses, four saddled and four  unsaddled, eight lances, four coats of mail, four swords, and 500s.            There were several thousand thegns, rich and poor, who held  land directly of the King. Some thegns had soken and others did not.  Free farmers who had sought protection from thegns in time of war now  took them as their lords. A freeman could chose his lord, following him  in war and working his land in peace. All able-bodied freemen were  liable to military service in the fyrd [national militia], but not in a  lord's private wars. In return, the lord would protect him against  encroaching neighbors, back him in the courts of law, and feed him in  times of famine. But often, lords raided each other's farmers, who fled  into the hills or woods for safety. Often a lord's fighting men stayed  with him at his large house, but later were given land with inhabitants  on it, who became his tenants. The lords were the ruling class and the  greatest of them sat in the King's council along with bishops, abbots,  and officers of the King's household. The lesser lords were local  magnates, who officiated at the shire and hundred courts.            Staghunting, foxhunting, and hawking were reserved for lords  who did not work with their hands. Every free born person had the right  to hunt other game.            There was a great expansion of arable land. Some land had been  specifically allocated to certain individuals. Some was common land,  held by communities. If a family came to pay the dues and fines on  certain common land, it could become personal to that family and was  then known as heirland. Most land came to be privately held from  community-witnessed allotments or inheritance. Bookland was those  holdings written down in books. This land was usually land that had  been given to the church or monasteries because church clerics could  write. So many thegns gave land to the church, usually a hide, that the  church held 1/3 of the land of the realm. Folkland was that land that  was left over after allotments had been made to the freemen and which  was not common land. It was public land and a national asset and could  be converted to heirland or bookland only by action of the king and  witan. It could also be rented by services to the state via charter. A  holder of folkland might express a wish, e.g. by testamentary action,  for a certain disposition of it, such as an estate for life or lives  for a certain individual. But a distinct act by the king and witan was  necessary for this wish to take effect. Small private transactions of  land could be done by \"livery of seisin\" in the presence of neighbors.  \"Seisin\" is rightful possession. A man in possession of land is  presumed to have \"seisin\", unless and until someone else can establish  a better title by legal process. All estates in land could be let,  lent, or leased by its holders, and was then known as \"loenland\".            Ploughs and wagons could be drawn by four or more oxen or  horses in sets of two behind each other. Oxenshoes and horseshoes  prevented lameness due to cracked hooves. Horse collars especially  fitted for horses, replaced oxen yoke that had been used on horses. The  horse collar did not restrict breathing and enabled horses to use the  same strength of oxen. Also, horses had better endurance and faster  speed.            A free holder's house was wood, perhaps with a stone  foundation, and roofed with thatch or tiles. There was a main room or  hall, with bed chambers around it. Beyond was the kitchen, perhaps  outside under a lean-to. These buildings were surrounded by a bank or  stiff hedge.            Simple people lived in huts made from wood and mud, with one  door and no windows. They slept around a wood-burning fire in the  middle of the earthen floor. They wore shapeless clothes of goat hair  and unprocessed wool from their sheep. They ate rough brown bread,  vegetable and grain broth, ale from barley, bacon, beans, milk,  cabbage, onion, apples, plums, cherries, and honey for sweetening or  mead. Vegetables grown in the country included onions, leeks, celery,  lettuce, radish, carrots, garlic, shallots, parsnip, dill, chervil,  marigold, coriander, and poppy. In the summer, they ate boiled or raw  veal and wild fowl such as ducks, geese, or pigeons, and game snared in  the forest. Poultry was a luxury food, but recognized as therapeutic  for invalids, especially in broth form [chicken soup]. Venison was  highly prized. There were still some wild boar, which were hunted with  long spears, a greyhound dog, and hunting horns. They sometimes mated  with the domestic pigs which roamed the woodlands. In September, the  old and infirm pigs were slaughtered and their sides of bacon smoked in  the rafters for about a month. Their intestines provided skin for  sausages. In the fall, cattle were slaughtered and salted for food  during the winter because there was no more pasture for them. However,  some cows and breed animals were kept through the winter.            For their meals, people used wooden platters, sometimes  earthenware plates, drinking horns, drinking cups from ash or alderwood  turned on a foot-peddled pole lathe, and bottles made of leather. Their  bowls, pans, and pitchers were made by the potter's wheel. Water could  be boiled in pots made of iron, brass, lead, or clay. Water could be  carried in leather bags because leather working preservative techniques "]]]
