A rare specimen of the  clustered sea-polyp, twelve gigantic polyps, each with eight long fringed  arms, terminating in a close cluster on a stalk or stem three feet high,  was obtained. \"Two specimens of this fine species were brought from the  coast of Greenland early in the last century; somehow these were lost, and  for a century the animal was never seen.\" Two were brought home by one of  the Swedish Arctic expeditions, and these are the only specimens ever  obtained. One of the lions of the expedition was not \"a rare sea-fowl,\"  but a transparent lobster, while a new crustacean, perfectly blind, which  feels its way with most beautifully delicate claws, was one of the  greatest curiosities obtained. Of these wonders, and of some geological  points determined, more anon. But they did not even sight the sea-serpent,  much less attempt to catch it. Jules Verne's twenty miles of inexhaustible  pearl-meadows were evidently missed, nor did they even catch a glimpse of  his gigantic oyster, with the pearl as big as a cocoa-nut, and worth  10,000,000 francs. They could not, with Captain Nemo, dive to the bottom  and land amid submarine forests, where tigers and cobras have their  counterparts in enormous sharks and vicious cephalopods. Victor Hugo's  \"devil-fish\" did not attack a single sailor, nor did, indeed, any  formidable cuttle-fish take even a passing peep at the _Challenger_, much  less attempt to stop its progress. Does the reader remember the story  recited both by Figuier and Moquin Tandon,(28) concerning one of these  gigantic sea-monsters, which should have a strong basis of truth in it, as  it was laid before the French Academie des Sciences by a lieutenant of  their navy and a French consul?

(_From __\"__The Voyage of the Challenger,__\"__ by permission of Messrs.                              Macmillan & Co._)]    The steam-corvette _Alecton_, when between Teneriffe and Madeira, fell in  with a gigantic cuttle-fish, fifty feet long in the body, without counting  its eight formidable arms covered with suckers. The head was of enormous  size, out of all proportion to the body, and had eyes as large as plates.  The other extremity terminated in two fleshy lobes or fins of great size.  The estimated weight of the whole creature was 4,000 lbs., and the flesh  was soft, glutinous, and of a reddish-brick colour. \"The commandant,  wishing, in the interests of science, to secure the monster, actually  engaged it in battle. Numerous shots were aimed at it, but the balls  traversed its flaccid and glutinous mass without causing it any vital  injury. But after one of these attacks, the waves were observed to be  covered with foam and blood, and--singular thing--a strong odour of musk was  inhaled by the spectators.... The musket-shots not having produced the  desired results, harpoons were employed, but they took no hold on the  soft, impalpable flesh of the marine monster. When it escaped from the  harpoon, it dived under the ship and came up again at the other side. They  succeeded, at last, in getting the harpoon to bite, and in passing a  bowling-hitch round the posterior part of the animal. But when they  attempted to hoist it out of the water, the rope penetrated deeply into  the flesh, and separated it into two parts, the head, with the arms and  tentacles, dropping into the sea and making off, while the fins and  posterior parts were brought on board; they weighed about forty pounds.  The crew were eager to pursue, and would have launched a boat, but the  commander refused, fearing that the animal might capsize it. The object  was not, in his opinion, one in which he could risk the lives of his  crew.\" M. Moquin Tandon, commenting on M. Berthelot's recital, considers  \"that this colossal mollusc was sick and exhausted at the time by some  recent struggle with some other monster of the deep, which would account  for its having quitted its native rocks in the depths of the ocean.  Otherwise it would have been more active in its movements, or it would  have obscured the waves with the inky liquid which all the cephalopods  have at command. Judging from its size, it would carry at least a barrel  of this black liquid.\"    The _Challenger_ afterwards visited Juan Fernandez, the real Robinson  Crusoe island where Alexander Selkirk passed his enforced residence of  four years. Thanks to Defoe, he lived to find himself so famous, that he  could hardly have grudged the time spent in his solitary sojourn with his  dumb companions and man Friday. Alas! the romance which enveloped Juan  Fernandez has somewhat dimmed. For a brief time it was a Chilian penal  colony, and after sundry vicissitudes, was a few years ago leased to a  merchant, who kept cattle to sell to whalers and passing ships, and also  went seal-hunting on a neighbouring islet. He was \"monarch of all he  surveyed\"--lord of an island over a dozen miles long and five or six broad,  with cattle, and herds of wild goats, and capital fishing all round--all  for two hundred a year! Fancy this, ye sportsmen, who pay as much or more  for the privileges of a barren moor! Yet the merchant was not satisfied  with his venture, and, at the time of the _Challenger's_ visit, was on the  point of abandoning it: by this time it is probably to let. Excepting the  cattle dotted about the foot of the hills and a civilised house or two,  the appearance of the island must be precisely the same now as when the  piratical buccaneers of olden time made it their rendezvous and haunt  wherefrom to dash out and harry the Spaniards; the same to-day as when  Alexander Selkirk lived in it as its involuntary monarch; the same to-day  as when Commodore Anson arrived with his scurvy-stricken \"crazy ship, a  great scarcity of water, and a crew so universally diseased that there  were not above ten foremast-men in a watch capable of doing duty,\" and  recruited them with fresh meat, vegetables, and wild fruits.               [Illustration: THE \"CHALLENGER\" AT JUAN FERNANDEZ.]    \"The scenery,\" writes Lord George Campbell, \"is grand: gloomy and wild  enough on the dull, stormy day on which we arrived, clouds driving past  and enveloping the highest ridge of the mountain, a dark-coloured sea  pelting against the steep cliffs and shores, and clouds of sea-birds  swaying in great flocks to and fro over the water; but cheerful and  beautiful on the bright sunny morning which followed--so beautiful that I  thought, 'This beats Tahiti!'\" The anchorage of the _Challenger_ was in  Cumberland Bay, a deep-water inlet from which rises a semi-circle of high  land, with two bold headlands, \"sweeping brokenly up thence to the highest  ridge--a square-shaped, craggy, precipitous mass of rock, with trees  clinging to its sides to near the summit. The spurs of these hills are  covered with coarse grass or moss.... Down the beds of the small ravines  run burns, overgrown by dock-leaves of enormous size, and the banks are  clothed with a rich vegetation of dark-leaved myrtle, bignonia, and  winter-bark, tree-shrubs, with tall grass, ferns, and flowering plants.  And as you lie there, humming-birds come darting and thrumming within  reach of your stick, flitting from flower to flower, which dot blue and  white the foliage of bignonias and myrtles. And on the steep grassy slopes  above the sea-cliffs herds of wild goats are seen quietly  browsing--quietly, that is, till they scent you, when they are off--as wild  as chamois.\" This is indeed a description of a rugged paradise!    Near the ship they found splendid, but laborious, cod-fishing; laborious  on account of sharks playing with the bait, and treating the stoutest  lines as though made of single gut; also on account of the forty-fathom  depth these cod-fish lived in. Cray-fish and conger-eels were hauled up in  lobster-pots by dozens, while round the ship's sides flashed shoals of  cavalli, fish that are caught by a hook with a piece of worsted tied  roughly on, swished over the surface, giving splendid play with a rod.  \"And on shore, too, there was something to be seen and done. There was  Selkirk's 'look-out' to clamber up the hill-side to--the spot where  tradition says he watched day after day for a passing sail, and from  whence he could look down on both sides of his island home, over the  wooded slopes, down to the cliff-fringed shore, on to the deserted ocean's  expanse.\"    The _Challenger_, in its cruise of over three years, naturally visited  many oft-described ports and settlements with which we shall have nought  to do. After a visit to Kerguelen's Land--\"the Land of Desolation,\" as  Captain Cook called it--in the Southern Indian Ocean, for the purpose of  selecting a spot for the erection of an observatory, from whence the  transit of Venus should be later observed, they proceeded to Heard Island,  the position of which required determining with more accuracy. They  anchored, in the evening, in a bay of this most gloomy and utterly  desolate place, where they found half-a-dozen wretched sealers living in  two miserable huts near the beach, which were sunk into the ground for  warmth and protection against the fierce winds. Their work is to kill and  boil down sea-elephants. One of the men had been there for two years, and  was going to stay another. They are left on the island every year by the  schooners, which go sealing or whaling elsewhere. Some forty men were on  the island, unable to communicate with each other by land, as the interior  is entirely covered with glacier, like Greenland. They have barrels of  salt pork, beef, and a small store of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39372"],[0,"The Recent Mammals of Tamaulipas, México (#12)"],[1,"anus_, Miller, N. Amer.

Specimens examined are intermediate in color and measurements between  _Pipistrellus subflavus subflavus_ and _P. s. veraecrucis_, but the  color resembles that of individuals of _subflavus_ from Kansas more  than that of specimens of _veraecrucis_ from Las Vigas, Veracruz.    The two males from eight kilometers west and 10 kilometers north of El  Encino represent the southernmost record of the subspecies.         _Measurements._--External measurements of two males (58849,       58848) from 8 km. west and 10 km. north of El Encino and a       male (60296) from Rancho Pano Ayuctle are, respectively, as       follows: 78, 81, 83; 36, 38, 36; 10, 10, 9; 11, 11, 11;       length of forearm, 33.1, 32.0, --; length of tibia, 14.6,       13.4, 13.0.

Washington, 64:105, August 24, type from Presa de       Guadalupe, San Luis Potosi.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Probably occurs throughout       southwest part, but presently known only from Joya Verde.    The specimens reported herein were shot in July in a canyon that  contained some standing water. According to the field notes of the  collector (Schaldach), individuals of this bat in Tamaulipas flew  later, in his experience, than bats of the same species in Sonora,  Arizona and Coahuila, not emerging until it was almost fully dark.    _Pipistrellus hesperus_ from Tamaulipas is identified as _P. h.  potosinus_ owing to the dark color, but the averages of some  measurements differ slightly from those given by Dalquest (1951:106)  for _potosinus_ as follows: tail and ear shorter; foot larger;  condylobasal length and cranial breadth less.         _Measurements._--Average and extreme external and cranial       measurements of five males from Joya Verde are: 73.2       (70-75); 27 (26-28); 7 (7); 12.4 (12-13); length of forearm,       31.0 (29.5-31.5); greatest length of skull, 12.4       (12.2-12.8); condylobasal length, 11.8 (11.4-12.3); breadth       of braincase, 6.3 (6.0-6.5). Corresponding measurements of       three females (60204, 60209, 60210) from the same locality       are: 72, 78, 76; 27, 33, 35; 7, 7, 7; 12, 12, 12; 31, 31,       32; 12.3, 12.9, 13.5; 11.7, 12.2, --; 6.0, 6.6, 6.1.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 8, from Joya       Verde, 35 km.

Philadelphia, 18:287, type from Mirador, Veracruz.         1812. _Eptesicus fuscus miradorensis_, Miller, Bull. U. S.       Nat. Mus., 79:62, December 31.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Southern part of state, north       at least to Miquihuana.    Specimens from Miquihuana, Palmillas, and Nicolas were shot in flight  at dusk; those from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were collected in a mist  net. Five females, all taken in June, were lactating.    Judging from Hall and Kelson's (1959:185) distribution map for the  species, two subspecies, _E. f. fuscus_ and _E. f. miradorensis_,  possibly occur in Tamaulipas, the former in the north and the latter in  the south. Comparison of specimens presently available from the state  (all from the southern part) with typical individuals of the two  subspecies mentioned reveal that they resemble _miradorensis_ to a  greater degree than _fuscus_ and they accordingly are assigned to the  former. In measurements, the Tamaulipan specimens agree closely with  _miradorensis_; in color, some resemble _miradorensis_ but others  approach _fuscus_, possibly indicating intergradation between the two  subspecies in the material at hand. Probably _E. f. fuscus_ will be  found in the northern part of the state.         _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of nine       females from the Sierra de Tamaulipas and three males, two       from Miquihuana (55137, 55138) and one from Palmillas       (55139), are respectively: 121.3 (111-127), 115, 107, 115;       51.9 (50-56), 50, 45, 52; 10.9 (9.5-11.0), 10, 10, 11; 17.8       (17-18), 18, 18, 18; length of forearm, 49.6 (48-52.6),       48.9, 49.1, 49.1; length of tibia, 18.8 (18.2-19.3), 20.5,       17.3, 18.0; condylobasal length, 18.9 (18.5-19.3), 19.3, --,       18.8; zygomatic breadth, 13.1 (12.7-13.5), --, 13.0, 13.3;       interorbital constriction, 4.2 (3.7-4.4), 4.0, 4.3, 4.1;       length of maxillary tooth-row, 7.3 (7.1-7.5), --, 7.2, 7.2.       Five lactating females weighed 20 (17-23) grams, and three       males 17.5 (17-8) grams.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 17:       Miquihuana, 6200 ft., 2; 14 mi. N, 6 mi.

One, _L. b. borealis_, is known only from Matamoros,  whereas the other, _L. b. teliotis_, is widely distributed in the  central and southern parts.    A young animal from Ciudad Victoria was captured inside a house. All  specimens taken in the Sierra de Tamaulipas were caught in mist nets,  in which _Centurio senex_, _Pteronotus parnelli_, and _Mormoops  megalophyla_ also were taken.      =Lasiurus borealis borealis= (Mueller)         1776. _Vespertilio borealis_ Mueller, Des Ritters Carl von       Linne ... vollstaendiges Natursystem ..., Suppl., p. 20, type       from New York.         1897. _Lasiurus borealis_, Miller, N.

Fauna,       13:110, October 16.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Generally distributed in       higher parts of state.    Eight June-taken females, all lactating, from the Sierra de Tamaulipas  averaged 10.0 (8-12) grams; five males from there weighed 9.2 (8-10)  grams. According to Hall and Kelson (1959:188), males of this species  usually are more brightly colored than females but this phenomenon is  not evident in the Tamaulipan specimens. Males do, however, average  slightly smaller than females.    The name _Lasiurus borealis teliotis_ is employed following Handley  (1960:472); formerly _L. b. ornatus_ Hall was applied (Hall and Kelson,  1959:190) to bats here referred to as _teliotis_.         _Records of"]]]
