The water in  her jug, and even the handkerchief she took up were warm. To an Egyptian  all this would have been a matter of course; but the native of Damascus  had always passed the summer in her father's country house on the  heights of Lebanon, in cool and lucent shade, and the all-pervading heat  of the past day had been to her intolerable.    Outside it was pleasant now; so without much reflection she pushed open  the shutter, wrapped a long, dark-hued kerchief about her head and  stole down the steep steps and out through a little side door into the  court-yard.    There she drew a deep breath and spread out her arms longingly, as  though she would fain fly far, far from thence; but then she dropped  them again and looked about her. It was not the want of fresh air alone  that had brought her out; no, what she most craved for was to open her  oppressed and rebellious heart to another; and here, in the servants'  quarters, there were two souls, one of which knew, understood and loved  her, while the other was as devoted to her as a faithful dog, and did  errands for her which were to be kept hidden from the governor's house  and its inhabitants.    The first was her nurse who had accompanied her to Egypt; the other was  a freed slave, her father's head groom, who had escorted the women with  his son, a lad, giving them shelter when, after the massacre of Abyla,  they had ventured out of their hiding-place, and after lurking for some  time in the valley of Lebanon, had found no better issue than to fly  to Egypt and put themselves under the protection of the Mukaukas, whose  sister had been Paula's father's first wife. She herself was the child  of his second marriage with a Syrian of high rank, a relation of the  Emperor Heraclius, who had died, quite young, shortly after Paula's  birth.    Both these servants had been parted from her. Perpetua, the nurse, had  been found useful by the governor's wife, who soon discovered that size  was particularly skilled in weaving and who had made her superintendent  of the slave-girls employed at the loom; the old woman had willingly  undertaken the duties though she herself was free-born, for her first  point in life was to remain near her beloved foster-child. Hiram  too, the groom, and his son had found their place among the Mukaukas'  household; in the first instance to take charge of the five horses  from her father's stable which had brought the fugitives to Egypt, but  afterwards--for the governor was not slow to discern his skill in  such matters--as a leech for all sorts of beasts, and as an adviser is  purchasing horses.    Paula wanted to speak with them both, and she knew exactly where to find  them; but she could not get to them without exposing herself to much  that was unpleasant, for the governor's free retainers and their  friends, not to mention the guard of soldiers who, now that the gates  were closed, were still sitting in parties to gossip; they would  certainly not break up for some time yet, since the slaves were only now  bringing out the soldiers' supper.    The clatter in the court-yard was unceasing, for every one who was free  to come out was enjoying the coolness of the night. Among them there  were no slaves; these had been sent to their quarters when the gates  were shut; but even in their dwellings voices were still audible.    With a beating heart Paula tried to see and hear all that came within  the ken of her keen eyes and ears. The growing moon lighted up half the  enclosure, the rest, so far as the shadow fell, lay in darkness. But in  the middle of a large semi-circle of free servants a fire was blazing,  throwing a fitful light on their brown faces; and now and again, as  fresh pine-cones were thrown in, it flared up and illuminated even the  darker half of the space before her. This added to her trepidation;  she had to cross the court-yard, as she hoped, unseen; for innocent and  natural as her proceedings were, she knew that her uncle's wife would  put a wrong construction on her nocturnal expedition.    At first Neforis had begged her husband to assist Paula in her search  for her father, of whose death no one had any positive assurance. But  his wife's urgency had not been needed: the Mukaukas, of his own free  will, had for a whole year done everything in his power to learn the  truth as to the lost man's end, from Christian or Moslem, till, many  months since, Neforis had declared that any further exertions in the  matter were mere folly, and her weak-willed husband had soon been  brought to share her views and give up the search for the missing hero.  He had secured for Paula, not without some personal sacrifice, much  of her father's property, had sold the landed estates to advantage,  collected outstanding debts wherever it was still possible, and was  anxious to lay before her a statement of what he had recovered for her.  But she knew that her interests were safe in his hands and was satisfied  to learn that, though she was not rich in the eyes of this Egyptian  Croesus, she was possessed of a considerable fortune. When once and  again she had asked for a portion of it to prosecute her search, the  Mukaukas at once caused it to be paid to her; but the third time he  refused, with the best intentions but quite firmly, to yield to her  wishes. He said he was her Kyrios and natural guardian, and explained  that it was his duty to hinder her from dissipating a fortune which  she might some day find a boon or indeed indispensable, in pursuit of a  phantom--for that was what this search had long since become.       [Kyrios: The woman's legal proxy, who represented her in courts of     justice. His presence gave her equal rights with a man in the eyes     of the Law.]    The money she had already spent he had replaced out of his own coffers.    This, she felt, was a noble action; still she urged him again and  again to grant her wish, but always in vain. He laid his hand with  firm determination on the wealth in his charge and would not allow her  another solidus for the sole and dearest aim of her life.    She seemed to submit; but her purpose of spending her all to recover any  trace of her lost parent never wavered in her determined soul. She had  sold a string of pearls, and for the price, her faithful Hiram had been  able first to make a long journey himself and then to send out a number  of messengers into various lands. By this time one at least might very  well have reached home with some news, and she must see the freed-man.    But how could she get to him undetected? For some minutes she stood  watching and listening for a favorable moment for crossing the  court-yard. Suddenly a blaze lighted up a face--it was Hiram's.    At this moment the merry semi-circle laughed loudly as with one voice;  she hastily made up her mind--drew her kerchief closer over her face,  ran quickly along the darker half of the quadrangle and, stooping low,  hurried across the moonlight towards the slaves' quarters.    At the entrance she paused; her heart throbbed violently. Had she been  observed? No.--There was not a cry, not a following footstep--every dog  knew her; the soldiers who were commonly on guard here had quitted their  posts and were sitting with their comrades round the fire.    The long building to the left was the weaving shop and her nurse  Perpetua lived there, in the upper story. But even here she must be  cautious, for the governor's wife often came out to give her orders to  the workwomen, and to see and criticise the produce of the hundred looms  which were always in motion, early and late. If she should be seen, one  of the weavers might only too probably betray the fact of her nocturnal  visit. They had not yet gone to rest, for loud laughter fell upon her  ear from the large sheds, open on all sides, which stood over the dyers'  vats. This class of the governor's people were also enjoying the cool  night after the fierce heat of the day, and the girls too had lighted a  fire.    Paula must pass them in full moonshine--but not just yet; and she  crouched close to the straw thatch which stretched over the huge clay  water-jars placed here for the slave-girls to get drink from. It cast  a dark triangular shadow on the dusty ground that gleamed in the  moonlight, and thus screened her from the gaze of the girls, while she  could hear and see what was going on in the sheds.    The dreadful day of torture ending in a harsh discord was at end; and  behind it she looked back on a few blissful hours full of the promise  of new happiness;--beyond these lay a long period of humiliation, the  sequel of a terrible disaster. How bright and sunny had her childhood  been, how delightful her early youth! For long years of her life she  had waked every morning to new joys, and gone to rest every evening  with sincere and fervent thanksgivings, that had welled from her soul  as freely and naturally as perfume from a rose. How often had she shaken  her head in perplexed unbelief when she heard life spoken of as a vale  of sorrows, and the lot of man bewailed as lamentable. Now she knew  better; and in many a lonely hour, in many a sleepless night, she had  asked herself whether He could, indeed, be a kind and fatherly-loving  God who could let a child be born and grow up, and fill its soul  with every hope, and then bereave it of everything that was dear and  desirable--even of hope.    But the hapless girl had been piously brought up; she could still  believe and pray; and lately it had seemed as though Heaven would grant  that for which her tender heart most longed: the love of a beloved and  love-worthy man. And now--now?    There she stood with an inconsolable sense of  bereavement--empty-hearted; and if she had been miserable before Orion's  return, now she was far more so; for whereas she had then been lonely  she was now defrauded--she, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/560"],[0,"Mr. Standfast (#12)"],[1,"Jimmy was troubled wi' a bowel  complaint. That's surely no justice!\". ...'    He broke off and lit a match by drawing it across the seat of his  trousers. 'It's time I got the gas lichtit. There's some men coming  here at half-ten.'    As the gas squealed and flickered in the lighting, he sketched for me  the coming guests. 'There's Macnab and Niven, two o' my colleagues. And  there's Gilkison of the Boiler-fitters, and a lad Wilkie--he's got  consumption, and writes wee bits in the papers. And there's a queer  chap o' the name o' Tombs--they tell me he comes frae Cambridge, and is  a kind of a professor there--anyway he's more stuffed wi' havers than  an egg wi' meat. He telled me he was here to get at the heart o' the  workingman, and I said to him that he would hae to look a bit further  than the sleeve o' the workin'-man's jaicket. There's no muckle in his  head, poor soul. Then there'll be Tam Norie, him that edits our weekly  paper--_Justice for All_. Tam's a humorist and great on Robert Burns,  but he hasna the balance o' a dwinin' teetotum ... Ye'll understand, Mr  Brand, that I keep my mouth shut in such company, and don't express my  own views more than is absolutely necessary. I criticize whiles, and  that gives me a name of whunstane common-sense, but I never let my  tongue wag. The feck o' the lads comin' the night are not the real  workingman--they're just the froth on the pot, but it's the froth that  will be useful to you. Remember they've heard tell o' ye already, and  ye've some sort o' reputation to keep up.'    'Will Mr Abel Gresson be here?' I asked.    'No,' he said. 'Not yet. Him and me havena yet got to the point o'  payin' visits. But the men that come will be Gresson's friends and  they'll speak of ye to him. It's the best kind of introduction ye could  seek.'    The knocker sounded, and Mr Amos hastened to admit the first comers.  These were Macnab and Wilkie: the one a decent middle-aged man with a  fresh-washed face and a celluloid collar, the other a round-shouldered  youth, with lank hair and the large eyes and luminous skin which are  the marks of phthisis. 'This is Mr Brand boys, from South Africa,' was  Amos's presentation. Presently came Niven, a bearded giant, and Mr  Norie, the editor, a fat dirty fellow smoking a rank cigar. Gilkison of  the Boiler-fitters, when he arrived, proved to be a pleasant young man  in spectacles who spoke with an educated voice and clearly belonged to  a slightly different social scale. Last came Tombs, the Cambridge  professor, a lean youth with a sour mouth and eyes that reminded me of  Launcelot Wake.    'Ye'll no be a mawgnate, Mr Brand, though ye come from South Africa,'  said Mr Norie with a great guffaw.    'Not me. I'm a working engineer,' I said. 'My father was from Scotland,  and this is my first visit to my native country, as my friend Mr Amos  was telling you.'    The consumptive looked at me suspiciously. 'We've got two--three of the  comrades here that the cawpitalist Government expelled from the  Transvaal. If ye're our way of thinking, ye will maybe ken them.'    I said I would be overjoyed to meet them, but that at the time of the  outrage in question I had been working on a mine a thousand miles  further north.    Then ensued an hour of extraordinary talk. Tombs in his sing-song  namby-pamby University voice was concerned to get information. He asked  endless questions, chiefly of Gilkison, who was the only one who really  understood his language. I thought I had never seen anyone quite so  fluent and so futile, and yet there was a kind of feeble violence in  him like a demented sheep. He was engaged in venting some private  academic spite against society, and I thought that in a revolution he  would be the class of lad I would personally conduct to the nearest  lamp-post. And all the while Amos and Macnab and Niven carried on their  own conversation about the affairs of their society, wholly impervious  to the tornado raging around them.    It was Mr Norie, the editor, who brought me into the discussion.    'Our South African friend is very blate,' he said in his boisterous  way. 'Andra, if this place of yours wasn't so damned teetotal and we  had a dram apiece, we might get his tongue loosened. I want to hear  what he's got to say about the war. You told me this morning he was  sound in the faith.'    'I said no such thing,' said Mr Amos. 'As ye ken well, Tam Norie, I  don't judge soundness on that matter as you judge it. I'm for the war  myself, subject to certain conditions that I've often stated. I know  nothing of Mr Brand's opinions, except that he's a good democrat, which  is more than I can say of some o' your friends.'    'Hear to Andra,' laughed Mr Norie. 'He's thinkin' the inspector in the  Socialist State would be a waur kind of awristocrat then the Duke of  Buccleuch. Weel, there's maybe something in that. But about the war  he's wrong. Ye ken my views, boys. This war was made by the  cawpitalists, and it has been fought by the workers, and it's the  workers that maun have the ending of it. That day's comin' very near.  There are those that want to spin it out till Labour is that weak it  can be pit in chains for the rest o' time. That's the manoeuvre we're  out to prevent. We've got to beat the Germans, but it's the workers  that has the right to judge when the enemy's beaten and not the  cawpitalists. What do you say, Mr Brand?'    Mr Norie had obviously pinned his colours to the fence, but he gave me  the chance I had been looking for. I let them have my views with a  vengeance, and these views were that for the sake of democracy the war  must be ended. I flatter myself I put my case well, for I had got up  every rotten argument and I borrowed largely from Launcelot Wake's  armoury. But I didn't put it too well, for I had a very exact notion of  the impression I wanted to produce. I must seem to be honest and in  earnest, just a bit of a fanatic, but principally a hard-headed  businessman who knew when the time had come to make a deal. Tombs kept  interrupting me with imbecile questions, and I had to sit on him. At  the end Mr Norie hammered with his pipe on the table.    'That'll sort ye, Andra. Ye're entertain' an angel unawares. What do ye  say to that, my man?'    Mr Amos shook his head. 'I'll no deny there's something in it, but I'm  not convinced that the Germans have got enough of a wheepin'.' Macnab  agreed with him; the others were with me. Norie was for getting me to  write an article for his paper, and the consumptive wanted me to  address a meeting.    'Wull ye say a' that over again the morn's night down at our hall in  Newmilns Street? We've got a lodge meeting o' the I.W.B., and I'll make  them pit ye in the programme.' He kept his luminous eyes, like a sick  dog's, fixed on me, and I saw that I had made one ally. I told him I  had come to Glasgow to learn and not to teach, but I would miss no  chance of testifying to my faith.    'Now, boys, I'm for my bed,' said Amos, shaking the dottle from his  pipe. 'Mr Tombs, I'll conduct ye the morn over the Brigend works, but  I've had enough clavers for one evening. I'm a man that wants his eight  hours' sleep.'    The old fellow saw them to the door, and came back to me with the ghost  of a grin in his face.    'A queer crowd, Mr Brand! Macnab didna like what ye said. He had a  laddie killed in Gallypoly, and he's no lookin' for peace this side the  grave. He's my best friend in Glasgow. He's an elder in the Gaelic kirk  in the Cowcaddens, and I'm what ye call a free-thinker, but we're  wonderful agreed on the fundamentals. Ye spoke your bit verra well, I  must admit. Gresson will hear tell of ye as a promising recruit.'    'It's a rotten job,' I said.    'Ay, it's a rotten job. I often feel like vomiting over it mysel'. But  it's no for us to complain. There's waur jobs oot in France for better  men ... A word in your ear, Mr Brand. Could ye not look a bit more  sheepish? Ye stare folk ower straight in the een, like a Hieland  sergeant-major up at Maryhill Barracks.' And he winked slowly and  grotesquely with his left eye.    He marched to a cupboard and produced a black bottle and glass. 'I'm  blue-ribbon myself, but ye'll be the better of something to tak the  taste out of your mouth. There's Loch Katrine water at the pipe there  ... As I was saying, there's not much ill in that lot. Tombs is a black  offence, but a dominie's a dominie all the world over. They may crack  about their Industrial Workers and the braw things they're going to do,  but there's a wholesome dampness about the tinder on Clydeside. They  should try Ireland.'    'Supposing,' I said, 'there was a really clever man who wanted to help  the enemy. You think he could do little good by stirring up trouble in  the shops here?'    'I'm positive.'    'And if he were a shrewd fellow, he'd soon tumble to that?'    'Ay.'    'Then if he still stayed on here he would be after bigger  game--something really dangerous and damnable?'    Amos drew down his brows and looked me in the face. 'I see what ye're  ettlin' at. Ay! That would be my conclusion. I came to it weeks syne  about the man ye'll maybe meet the morn's night.'    Then from below the bed he pulled a box from which he drew a handsome  flute. 'Ye'll forgive me, Mr Brand, but I aye like a tune before I go  to my bed. Macnab says his prayers, and I have a tune on the flute, and  the principle is just the same.'    So that singular evening closed with music--very sweet and true  renderings of old Border melodies like 'My Peggy is a young thing', and  'When the kye come hame'. I fell asleep with a vision of Amos, his face  all puckered up at the mouth and a wandering sentiment in his eye,  recapturing in his dingy world the emotions of a boy.                *       *       *       *       *    The widow-woman from next door, who acted as house-keeper, cook, and  general factotum to the establishment, brought me shaving water next"]]]
