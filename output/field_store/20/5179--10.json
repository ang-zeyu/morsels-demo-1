Getting between the two lines he sailed out across the slope to  the elk carcasses, feasted sumptuously, and then meandered out  the way he came, without having disturbed a soul.    All this was done at night, and in darkness; and presumably that  bear is there to this day, alive and well. No wonder Mr. Wright  has a high opinion of the grizzly bear as a thinking animal.    In hiding their homes and young, either in burrows or in nests on  the ground, wild rabbits and hares are wonderfully skilful, even  under new conditions. Being quite unable to fight, or even to dig  deeply, they are wholly dependent upon their wits in keeping their  young alive by hiding them. Thanks to their keenness in  concealment, the gray rabbit is plentiful throughout the eastern  United States in spite of its millions of enemies. Is it not  wonderful? The number killed by hunters last year in Pennsylvania  was about 3,500,000!    The most amazing risk that I ever saw taken by a rabbit was made  by a gray rabbit that nested in a shallow hole in the middle of a  lawn-mower lawn east of the old National Museum building in  Washington. The hollow was like that of a small wash-basin, and  when at rest in it with her young ones the neutral gray back of  the mother came just level with the top of the ground. At the  last, when her young were almost large enough to get out and go  under their own steam, a lawn-mower artist chanced to look down  at the wrong moment and saw the family. Evidently that mother  believed that the boldest ventures are those most likely to win.    Among the hoofed and horned animals of North America the white-  tailed deer is the shrewdest in the recognition of its enemies,  the wisest in the choice of cover, and in measures for self-  preservation. It seems at first glance that the buck is more keen-  witted than the doe; but this is a debatable question. Throughout  the year the buck thinks only of himself. During fully one-half  the year the doe is burdened by the cares of motherhood, and the  paramount duty of saving her fawns from their numerous enemies.  This, I am quite sure, is the handicap which makes it so much  easier to kill a doe in the autumn hunting season than to bag a  fully antlered and sophisticated buck who has only himself to  consider.    The white-tailed deer saves its life by skulking low in timber and  thick brush. This is why it so successfully resists the  extermination that has almost swept the mule deer, antelope,  white goat, moose and elk from all the hunting-grounds of the  United States. Thanks to its alertness in seeing its enemies  first, its skill and quickness in hiding, _and its mental  keenness in recognizing and using deer sanctuaries,_ the white-  tailed or \"Virginia\" deer will outlive all the other hoofed  animals of North America. In Pennsylvania they know enough to rush  for the wire-bounded protected area whenever the hunters appear.  That state has twenty-six such deer sanctuaries,--well filled  with deer.    The moose and caribou dwell upon open or half-open ground, and are  at the mercy of the merciless long-range rifles. Their keenness  does not count much against rifles that can shoot and kill at a  quarter of a mile. In the rutting season the bull moose of Maine  or New Brunswick is easily deceived by the \"call\" of a birch-bark  megaphone in the hands of a moose hunter who imitates the love  call of the cow moose so skilfully that neither moose nor man can  detect the falsity of the lure.    The mountain sheep is wide-eyed, alert and ready to run, but he  dwells in exposed places from the high foothills up to the  mountain summits, and now even the most bungling hunter can find  him and kill him at long range. In the days of black powder and  short ranges the sheep had a chance to escape; but now he has none  whatever. He has keener vision and more alertness than the goat,  but as a real life-saving factor that amounts to nothing! Wild  sheep are easily and quickly exterminated.    The mountain goat has no protection except elevation and  precipitous rocks, and to the hunter who has the energy to climb  up to him he, too, is easy prey. Usually his biped enemy finds him  and attacks him in precipitous mountains, where running and hiding  are utterly impossible. When discovered on a ledge two feet wide  leading across the face of a precipice, poor Billy has nothing to  do but to take the bullets as they come until he reels and falls  far down to the cruel slide-rock. He has a wonderful mind, but its  qualities and its usefulness belong in Chapter XIII.    Warm-Coated Animals Avoid \"Fresh Air.\" On this subject there is a  strange divergence of reasoning power between the wild animals of  cold countries and the sleeping-porch advocates of today.    Even the most warm-coated of the fur-bearing animals, such as the  bears, foxes, beavers, martens and mink, and also the burrowing  rodents, take great pains to den up in winter just as far from the  \"fresh air\" of the cold outdoors as they can attain by deep  denning or burrowing. The prairie-dog not only ensconces himself  in a cul-de-sac at the end of a hole fourteen feet deep and long,  but as winter sets in he also tightly plugs up the mouth of his  den with moist earth. When sealed up in his winter den the black  bear of the north draws his supply of fresh air through a hole  about one inch in diameter, or less.    But the human devotees of fresh air reason in the opposite  direction. It is now the regular thing for mothers to open wide to  the freezing air of out-doors either one or all the windows of the  rooms in which their children sleep, giving to each child enough  fresh air to supply ten full-grown elephants, or twenty head of  horses. And the final word is the \"sleeping-porch!\" It matters not  how deadly damp is the air along with its 33 degrees of cold, or  the velocity of the wind, the fresh air must be delivered. The  example of the fat and heavily furred wild beast is ignored; and I  just wonder how many people in the United States, old and young,  have been killed, or permanently injured, by fresh air, during the  last fifteen years.    And furthermore. Excepting the hoofed species, it is the universal  rule of the wild animals of the cold-winter zones of the earth  that the mother shall keep her helpless young close beside her in  the home nest and keep them warm partly by the warmth of her own  body. The wild fur-clad mother does not maroon her helpless  offspring in an isolated cot in a room apart, upon a thin mattress  and in an atmosphere so cold that it is utterly impossible for the  poor little body and limbs to warm it and keep it warm. Yet many  human mothers do just that, and some take good care to provide a  warmer atmosphere for themselves than they joyously force upon  their helpless infants.    No dangerous fads should be forced upon defenseless children or  animals.    A proper amount of fresh air is very desirable, but the intake of  a child is much less than that of an elephant. Besides, if Nature  had intended that men should sleep outdoors in winter, with the  moose and caribou, we would have been furnished with ruminant  pelage and fat.          VII    KEEN BIRDS AND DULL MEN      If all men could know how greatly the human species varies from  highest to lowest, and how the minds and emotions of the lowest  men parallel and dove-tail with those of the highest quadrupeds  and birds, we might be less obsessed with our own human ego, and  more appreciative of the intelligence of animals.    A thousand times in my life my blood has been brought to the  boiling point by seeing or reading of the cruel practices of  ignorant and vicious men toward animals whom they despised because  of their alleged standing \"below man.\" By his vicious and cruel  nature, many a man is totally unfitted to own, or even to  associate with, dogs, horses and monkeys. Many persons are born  into the belief that every man is necessarily a \"lord of  creation,\" and that all animals per se are man's lawful prey. In  the vicious mind that impression increases with age. Minds of the  better classes can readily learn by precept or by reasoning from  cause to effect the duty of man to observe and defend the God-  given rights of animals.    It was very recently that I saw on the street a group that  represented man's attitude toward wild animals. It consisted of  an unclean and vicious-looking man in tramp's clothing, grinding  an offensive hand-organ and domineering over a poor little  terrorized \"ringtail\" monkey. The wretched mite from the jungle  was encased in a heavy woolen straight-jacket, and there was a  strap around its loins to which a stout cord was attached, running  to the Root of All Evil. The pavement was hot, but there with its  bare and tender feet on the hot concrete, the sad-eyed little waif  painfully moved about, peering far up into the faces of passers-by  for sympathy, but all the time furtively and shrinkingly watching  its tormentor. Every now and then the hairy old tramp would jerk  the monkey's cord, each time giving the frail creature a violent  bodily wrench from head to foot. I think that string was jerked  about forty times every hour.    And that exhibition of monkey torture in a monkey hell continues  in summer throughout many states of our country,--because \"it  pleases the children!\" The use of monkeys with hand-organs is a  cruel outrage upon the monkey tribe, and no civilized state or  municipality should tolerate it. I call upon all humane persons to  put an end to it.    As an antidote to our vaulting human egotism, we should think  often upon the closeness of mental contact between the highest  animals and the lowest men. In drawing a parallel between those  two groups, there are no single factors more valuable than the  home, and the family food supply.

Duel's, who {10} lived in a small cabin  near the railway between Commerce and Warsaw. They were so feeble as to  be unable to carry their trunks into the house without the assistance  of Sister Duel, who received them kindly, prepared a bed for them to  lie on, and made them a cup of tea.    _Thursday, 19_.--I Returned this evening from Burlington.    Brother Duel carried Elders Young and Kimball in his wagon to Lima,  sixteen miles, where another brother received them and carried them to  Father Mikesell's near Quincy, about twenty miles; the fatigue of this  day was too much for their feeble health; they were prostrated, and  obliged to tarry a few days to recruit.    _Friday and Saturday, 20 and 21_.--At home attending to domestic and  Church business.    Elders George A. Smith, Reuben Hedlock, and Theodore Turley started  for England, and upset their wagon on the bank of the river, before  they got out of sight of Commerce. Elders Smith and Turley were so weak  they could not get up, and Brother Hedlock had to lift them in again.  Soon after, some gentlemen met them and asked who had been robbing the  burying ground--so miserable was their appearance through sickness.    _Sunday, 22_.--I presided at the meeting, and spoke concerning the  \"other Comforter,\" as I had previously taught the Twelve. [8]    {11} This week I spent in transacting various business at home, except  when visiting the sick, who are in general recovering, though some of  them but slowly.    _Wednesday, 25_.--President Young went to Charles C. Rich's; 26th, to  Brother Wilber's; 27th, Brother Wilber carried Elders Young and Kimball  to Pittsfield.    [Sidenote: Items of Doctrine--the Prophet.]    _Sunday, 29_.--Held meeting at my own house. After others had spoken  I spoke and explained concerning the uselessness of preaching to the  world about great judgments, but rather to preach the simple Gospel.  Explained concerning the coming of the Son of Man; also that it is a  false idea that the Saints will escape all the judgments, whilst the  wicked suffer; for all flesh is subject to suffer, and \"the righteous  shall hardly escape;\" still many of the Saints will escape, for the  just shall live by faith; yet many of the righteous shall fall a  prey to disease, to pestilence, etc., by reason of the weakness of  the flesh, and yet be saved in the Kingdom of God. So that it is an  unhallowed principle to say that such and such have transgressed  because they have been preyed upon by disease or death, for all flesh  is subject to death; and the Savior has said, \"Judge not, lest ye be  judged.\"    _Monday, 30_.--The fore part of this week I was at home preparing for  Conference. Elders Young and Kimball went to Brother Decker's and Mr.  Murray's, Sister Kimball's father.    _Tuesday, October 1_.--Elders Young and Kimball went to Brother Lorenzo  Young's.    _Thursday, 3_.--I was in counsel with the brethren.    _Friday, 4_.--Lorenzo Young carried Elders Young and Kimball to  Jacksonville.    _Saturday, 5_.--The friends and brethren conveyed the Elders of the  British Mission to Springfield, where they were kindly treated and  nursed, for they were yet very feeble.    I attended a general conference of the Church of Jesus {12} Christ of  Latter-day Saints at Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois, of which the  following are the minutes:        _Minutes of Conference at Commerce, Illinois, October 6th, 7th and      8th, 1839_.        The meeting was opened by prayer by President Joseph Smith, Jun.,      after which he was appointed President, and James Sloan Clerk of      the conference, by a unanimous voice of the meeting. The President      then spoke at some length upon the situation of the Church; the      difficulties they have had to contend with; and the manner in which      they had been led to this place; and wanted to know the views of      the brethren, whether they wished to appoint this a stake of Zion      or not; stating that he believed it to be a good place, and suited      for the Saints. It was then unanimously agreed upon that it should      be appointed a stake and a place of gathering for the Saints.        The following officers were then appointed--namely, William Marks      to be President; Bishop Whitney to be Bishop of middle ward; Bishop      Partridge to be Bishop of upper ward; Bishop Knight to be Bishop of      lower ward; George W. Harris, Samuel Bent, Henry G. Sherwood, David      Fullmer, Alpheus Cutler, William Huntington, Thomas Grover, Newel      Knight, Charles C. Rich, David Dort, Seymour Brunson, Lewis D.      Wilson, to be the High Council; who being respectfully called upon      accepted their appointment.        It was then voted that a stake of the Church be established on the      west side of the river, in Iowa Territory; over which Elder John      Smith was appointed President; Alanson Ripley, Bishop; and Asahel      Smith, John M. Burk, Abraham O. Smoot, Richard Howard, Willard      Snow, Erastus Snow, David Pettigrew, Elijah Fordham, Edward Fisher,      Elias Smith, John Patten, Stephen Chase, were elected High Council.      Don C. Smith was elected to be continued as President of the High      Priesthood [High Priest's quorum]. Orson Hyde to stand in his      former office, [an Apostle] and William Smith to be continued in      his standing, [in the quorum of the Twelve.]        Letters were then read respecting the absence of members on account      of ill health. It was voted that Harlow Redfield be suspended until      he can have a trial; and in the meantime that he should not act as      president of a branch, or preach.        Voted that John Daley, James Daley, and Milo Andrus retain their      station in the Church. Voted that Ephraim Owen's confession for      disobeying the Word of Wisdom be accepted.        Brothers Edward Johnston, Benjamin Johnston, Samuel Musick, John      S. Fullmer, Jabez Lake, Benjamin Jones, Henry Our Bough, Reddin      A. Allred, George W. Gee, Jesse McIntyre, James {13} Brown, Henry      Miller, Artemas Johnson, Joseph G. Hovey, Robert D. Foster, Fields      B. Jacaway, Zadok Bethers, William Allred, William B. Simmons,      William W. Edwards, Sen., William H. Edwards, Jun., Hosea Stout,      Thomas Rich, Allen J. Stout, Esaias Edwards, John Adams, Daniel      Miller, Simeon J. Comfort, Graham Coltrin, William Hyde, Andrew      Henry, Reddick N. Allred, Eli Lee, Hiram W. Mikesell and Thomas S.      Edwards were appointed Elders of the Church, who all accepted of      their appointment, with the exception of Thomas S. Edwards.        John Gaylord was admitted into the Church upon his confession. Abel      Casto was confirmed by the laying on of hands.        The meeting then adjourned until Sunday morning; after which six      were baptized by Joseph Smith, Jun. The assembly was very large.        The conference met on Sunday morning, the 6th, pursuant to      adjournment at eight o'clock a. m., when Samuel Williams, Reuben      Foot, Orlando D. Hovey, Tunis Rappleyee, Sheffield Daniels, Albert      Milner, David B. Smith, Ebenezer Richardson, Pleasant Ewell, and      William Helm were appointed Elders of the Church, and were ordained      under the hands of Reynolds Cahoon, Seymour Brunson, Samuel Bent      and Alpheus Cutler.        After some remarks from the President respecting order, and decorum      during conference, Elder Lyman Wight spoke concerning the duties of      Priests and Teachers. President Joseph Smith, Jun., then addressed      the conference, in relation to appointing a Patriarch, and other      matters connected with the well being of the Church.        Having now got through the business matters, the President      proceeded to give instruction to the Elders respecting preaching      the Gospel, and pressed upon them the necessity of getting the      Spirit, so that they might preach with the Holy Ghost sent down      from heaven; to be careful in speaking on those subjects which      are not clearly pointed out in the word of God, which lead to      speculation and strife.        Those persons who had been baptized, were then confirmed, and      several children received blessings by Elders Cutler, Bent, and      Brunson. Elder Lyman Wight then addressed the meeting on the      subject of raising funds by contribution, towards paying for the      lands which had been contracted for as a settlement for the Church,      after which contributions were received for that purpose.        Judge Elias Higbee was appointed to accompany Presidents Joseph      Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon to the city of Washington.        The meeting then adjourned until Monday morning.        Conference met on Monday morning, October 7th, pursuant to      adjournment.        The President spoke at some length to the Elders, and explained      {14} many passages of Scripture. Elder Lyman Wight spoke on the      subject of the resurrection, and other important subjects; when he      offered the following resolution, which passed unanimously;        Resolved: That a new edition of Hymn Books be printed immediately,      and that the one published by D. W. Rogers be utterly discarded by      the Church.        Elder Ezra Hayes was then put upon trial for teaching doctrine      injurious to the Church, and for falsehoods, which were proven      against him; his license was taken from him, and he required to      give satisfaction to those whom he had offended.        Charges having been preferred against Brother Rogers, it was agreed      that the case be handed over to the High Council.        Asahel Perry made application to be received into fellowship, and      was voted into his former standing.        After having referred the business not gone into, to the High      Council, the President then returned thanks to the conference for      their good attention"]]]
