Thousands of  dozens are thus annually despatched; but this number is as nothing  compared with that consumed on the spot. In France Bird Protection has  done much to stop this cruel traffic. In the schools there the boys  and girls are now being taught to know and to care for the wild life  about them more than in our English Council Schools.        THE BLACK REDSTART     RUTICILLA TITYS        Upper plumage bluish grey; bill, cheeks, throat, and breast,      black, passing into bluish beneath; tail as in the last;      greater wing-coverts edged with pure white; second primary      equal to the seventh. _Female_--upper plumage duller; lower      bright ash, passing into white; wings dusky, edged with grey;      red of the tail less bright. Length, five inches and three      quarters. Eggs pure shining white.    A much less frequent visitor to this country than the preceding, but  by no means ranking among our rarest birds, specimens occurring in the  winter of every year in some part of England or another, especially in  Devon and Cornwall. Its habits are much the same as those of its  congener; but it generally chooses a loftier situation for its nest,  which is placed in the walls of buildings, at an elevation varying  from a few feet to eighty or ninety. Its plumage differs in being much  darker in the fore part of the body, while the tail is of a brighter  red. The eggs are white. It generally arrives in England about the  first week in November, and remains with us all the winter. Its nest  has never been found in this country.        THE REDBREAST, OR ROBIN     ERATHACUS RUBA%CULA        Upper parts brownish grey tinged with olive; forehead, lore,      and breast red, the red edged with ash-grey; abdomen white.      _Female_ like the _male_, except that the upper parts are      ash-brown, the red less bright, and the grey surrounding it      less conspicuous. Length, five inches and three quarters. Eggs      yellowish white, spotted with light reddish brown.    The Redbreast is everywhere invested with a kind of sanctity beyond  all other birds. Its wonted habit of making its appearance, no one  knows whence, to greet the resting traveller in places the most  lonely--its evident predilection for the society of the out-of-door  labourer, whatever his occupation--the constancy with which it affects  human habitations--and the readiness with which, without coaxing, or  taming, or training, it throws itself on human hospitality--engender  an idea that there must be some mysterious connexion between the  two--that if there were no men, there would be no Redbreasts. Trust on  one side engenders confidence on the other, and mutual attachment is  the natural result. There is something, too, beyond the power of  explanation in the fact that the Robin is the only bird which  frequents from choice the homes of men.    The habits of the Redbreast are so well known, that to describe them  would be simply to write down what every one has seen or may see.    It generally builds its nest in a hole, near the bottom of a hedge or  under the stump of a tree, in an ivy-clad wall, or amidst the creepers  trained round the veranda of a cottage. I have seen it also placed in  a niche in a wall intended for the reception of a vase, in a bee-hive  stored away on the rafters of an outhouse, and under a wisp of straw  accidentally left on the ground in a garden. It is usually composed of  dry leaves, roots, bents, and moss, lined with hair and wool, and  contains five or six eggs. The young birds are of a brown tint, and  have the feathers tipped with yellow, which gives them a spotted  appearance. Until they acquire the red breast, they are very unlike  the parents, and might be mistaken for young Thrushes, except that  they are much smaller. They may be often observed in gardens for many  days after they have left the nest, keeping together, perching in the  bushes, and clamorous for food, which the old birds bring to them from  time to time. It is said, that only one brood is reared in a year, but  this I am inclined to doubt, having observed in the same locality  families of young birds early in the spring, and late in the summer of  the same year. Towards the end of August, the young birds acquire the  distinctive plumage of their species, and are solitary in their habits  until the succeeding spring. The call-notes of the Redbreast are  numerous, and vary beyond the power of description in written words;  the song is loud, and it is needless to say, pleasing, and possesses  the charm of being continued when all our other feathered songsters  are mute. The red of the breast often has a brighter tint, it is  occasionally almost a carmine red. The late Lord Lilford told the  editor such were often birds that had been bred on the Continent.  Numbers of young birds come across the sea to us each autumn.         [Illustration:         Wheatear [F] [M]         Nightingale       Hedge-sparrow Robin                                  [_p. 16._]]         [Illustration:       Whitethroat [M] [M] Garden Warbler [F]         Lesser Whitethroat [M]            Blackcap [M]]          THE NIGHTINGALE     DAULIAS LUSCANIA        Upper plumage russet brown; tail bright rust-red; under      plumage buffish white; flanks pale ash colour. Length six and      a quarter inches; breadth nine and a half inches. Eggs uniform      olive-brown.    The southern, eastern, and some of the midland counties of England,  enjoy a privilege which is denied to the northern and western--an  annual visit, namely, from the Nightingale. It is easy enough to  understand why a southern bird should bound its travels northwards by  a certain parallel, but why it should keep aloof from Devon and  Cornwall, the climate of which approaches more closely to that of its  favourite continental haunts than many of the districts to which it  unfailingly resorts, is not so clear. Several reasons have been  assigned--one, that cowslips do not grow in these counties; this may  be dismissed at once as purely fanciful; another is, that the soil is  too rocky; this is not founded on fact, for both Devon and Cornwall  abound in localities which would be to Nightingales a perfect  Paradise, if they would only come; a third is, that the proper food is  not to be found there: but this reason cannot be admitted until it is  proved that the portions of the island to which the Nightingale does  resort abound in some kind of insect food which is not to be found in  the extreme southern counties, and that the Nightingale, instead of  being, as it is supposed, a general insect-eater, confines itself to  that one; and this is a view of the question which no one has ventured  to take. My own theory--and I only throw it out for consideration--is  that the Nightingale is not found in these two counties on account of  their peculiar geographical position. The continental Nightingales are  observed to take their departure in autumn, either eastward through  Hungary, Dalmatia, Greece, and the islands of the Archipelago; or  southwards across the Straits of Gibraltar, but none by the broad part  of the Mediterranean. Hence we may infer that the bird dislikes a long  sea voyage, and that when in spring it migrates northward and  westward, it crosses the English Channel at the narrowest parts  only,[3] spreads itself over the nearest counties in the direction of  its migration, but is instinctively prevented from turning so far back  again to the south as the south-west peninsula of England. From  Scotland it would be naturally excluded by its northern position, and  from Ireland by the Welsh mountains and the broad sea.    For the dwellers in these unfavoured districts alone is my description  of the Nightingale intended; for, where it abounds, its habits are too  well known to need any description. Twenty-four hours of genial May  weather spent in the country with a good use of the eyes and ears,  will reveal more of the life and habits of the bird than is contained  in all the ornithological treatises that have been written on the  subject, and they are not a few.    No great amount of caution is necessary in approaching the Nightingale  while singing at night. One may walk unrestrainedly across the fields,  talking in an ordinary tone of voice, and not even find it necessary  to suppress conversation when close to a singing bird. Either he is  too intent on his occupation to detect the presence of strangers, or  he is aware of the security in which he is wrapped by the shades of  night, or he is actually proud of having listeners. In the  neighbourhood of my present residence in Hertfordshire, Nightingales  are numerous. They arrive about the seventeenth of April, and for the  first few days assemble year after year in the bushes and hedges of a  certain hillside, the position of which it would be unsafe to indicate  particularly, and taking their station two or three hundred yards  apart from each other, set up a rivalry of song which is surpassingly  beautiful. At this season, one may hear five or six chanting at once;  every break in the song of the nearest being filled up by the pipings  or wailings of the more distant ones. The male birds arrive several  days before the female, and employ the interval, it is fancifully  said, in contending for the prize in a musical contest. This period is  anxiously watched for by bird-catchers, who have learnt by experience  that birds entrapped before they have paired will bear confinement in  a cage, but that those captured after the arrival of their mates pine  to death. The Nightingale being a fearless bird and of an inquisitive  nature is easily snared; hence, in the neighbourhood of cities, the  earliest and therefore strongest birds fall ready victims to the  fowler's art.    It must not be supposed that this bird sings by night only. Every day  and all day long,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3810"],[0,"The Man-Eaters of Tsavo, and Other East African Adventures (#12)"],[1," advanced. In a moment or two a sudden  stop, followed by an angry growl, told me that my presence had been  noticed; and I began to fear that disappointment awaited me once more.    But no; matters quickly took an unexpected turn. The hunter became the  hunted; and instead of either making off or coming for the bait  prepared for him, the lion began stealthily to stalk me! For about two  hours he horrified me by slowly creeping round and round my crazy  structure, gradually edging his way nearer and nearer. Every moment I  expected him to rush it; and the staging had not been constructed with  an eye to such a possibility. If one of the rather flimsy poles should  break, or if the lion could spring the twelve feet which separated me  from the ground ... the thought was scarcely a pleasant one. I began  to feel distinctly \"creepy,\" and heartily repented my folly in having  placed myself in such a dangerous position. I kept perfectly still,  however, hardly daring even to blink my eyes: but the long-continued  strain was telling on my nerves, and my feelings may be better imagined  than described when about midnight suddenly something came flop and  struck me on the back of the head. For a moment I was so terrified that  I nearly fell off the plank, as I thought that the lion had sprung on  me from behind. Regaining my senses in a second or two, I realised that  I had been hit by nothing more formidable than an owl, which had  doubtless mistaken me for the branch of a tree--not a very alarming  thing to happen in ordinary circumstances, I admit, but coming at the  time it did, it almost paralysed me. The involuntary start which I  could not help giving was immediately answered by a sinister growl from  below.    After this I again kept as still as I could, though absolutely  trembling with excitement; and in a short while I heard the lion begin  to creep stealthily towards me. I could barely make out his form as he  crouched among the whitish undergrowth; but I saw enough for my  purpose, and before he could come any nearer, I took careful aim and  pulled the trigger. The sound of the shot was at once followed by a  most terrific roar, and then I could hear him leaping about in all  directions. I was no longer able to see him, however, as his first  bound had taken him into the thick bush; but to make assurance doubly  sure, I kept blazing away in the direction in which I heard him  plunging about. At length came a series of mighty groans, gradually  subsiding into deep sighs, and finally ceasing altogether; and I felt  convinced that one of the \"devils\" who had so long harried us would  trouble us no more.    As soon as I ceased firing, a tumult of inquiring voices was borne  across the dark jungle from the men in camp about a quarter of a mile  away. I shouted back that I was safe and sound, and that one of the  lions was dead: whereupon such a mighty cheer went up from all the  camps as must have astonished the denizens of the jungle for miles  around. Shortly I saw scores of lights twinkling through the bushes:  every man in camp turned out, and with tom-toms beating and horns  blowing came running to the scene. They surrounded my eyrie, and to my  amazement prostrated themselves on the ground before me, saluting me  with cries of \"Mabarak! Mabarak!\" which I believe means \"blessed one\"  or \"saviour.\" All the same, I refused to allow any search to be made  that night for the body of the lion, in case his companion might be  close by; besides, it was possible that he might be still alive, and  capable of making a last spring. Accordingly we all returned in triumph  to the camp, where great rejoicings were kept up for the remainder of  the night, the Swahili and other African natives celebrating the  occasion by an especially wild and savage dance.    For my part, I anxiously awaited the dawn; and even before it was  thoroughly light I was on my way to the eventful spot, as I could not  completely persuade myself that even yet the \"devil\" might not have  eluded me in some uncanny and mysterious way. Happily my fears proved  groundless, and I was relieved to find that my luck--after playing me  so many exasperating tricks--had really turned at last. I had scarcely  traced the blood for more than a few paces when, on rounding a bush, I  was startled to see a huge lion right in front of me, seemingly alive  and crouching for a spring. On looking closer, however, I satisfied  myself that he was really and truly stone-dead, whereupon my followers  crowded round, laughed and danced and shouted with joy like children,  and bore me in triumph shoulder-high round the dead body. These  thanksgiving ceremonies being over, I examined the body and found that  two bullets had taken effect--one close behind the left shoulder,  evidently penetrating the heart, and the other in the off hind leg. The  prize was indeed one to be proud of; his length from tip of nose to tip  of tail was nine feet eight inches, he stood three feet nine inches  high, and it took eight men to carry him back to camp. The only blemish  was that the skin was much scored by the boma thorns through which he  had so often forced his way in carrying off his victims.    The news of the death of one of the notorious man-eaters soon spread  far and wide over the country: telegrams of congratulation came pouring  in, and scores of people flocked from up and down the railway to see  the skin for themselves.          CHAPTER IX    THE DEATH OF THE SECOND MAN-EATER      It must not be imagined that with the death of this lion our troubles  at Tsavo were at an end; his companion was still at large, and very  soon began to make us unpleasantly aware of the fact. Only a few nights  elapsed before he made an attempt to get at the Permanent Way  Inspector, climbing up the steps of his bungalow and prowling round the  verandah. The Inspector, hearing the noise and thinking it was a  drunken coolie, shouted angrily \"Go away!\" but, fortunately for him,  did not attempt to come out or to open the door. Thus disappointed in  his attempt to obtain a meal of human flesh, the lion seized a couple  of the Inspector's goats and devoured them there and then.    On hearing of this occurrence, I determined to sit up the next night  near the Inspector's bungalow. Fortunately there was a vacant iron  shanty close at hand, with a convenient loophole in it for firing from;  and outside this I placed three full-grown goats as bait, tying them to  a half-length of rail, weighing about 250 lbs. The night passed  uneventfully until just before daybreak, when at last the lion turned  up, pounced on one of the goats and made off with it, at the same time  dragging away the others, rail and all. I fired several shots in his  direction, but it was pitch dark and quite impossible to see anything,  so I only succeeded in hitting one of the goats. I often longed for a  flash-light on such occasions.    Next morning I started off in pursuit and was joined by some others  from the camp. I found that the trail of the goats and rail was easily  followed, and we soon came up, about a quarter of a mile away, to where  the lion was still busy at his meal. He was concealed in some thick  bush and growled angrily on hearing our approach; finally, as we got  closer, he suddenly made a charge, rushing through the bushes at a  great pace. In an instant, every man of the party scrambled hastily up  the nearest tree, with the exception of one of my assistants, Mr.  Winkler, who stood steadily by me throughout. The brute, however, did  not press his charge home: and on throwing stones into the bushes where  we had last seen him, we guessed by the silence that he had slunk off.  We therefore advanced cautiously, and on getting up to the place  discovered that he had indeed escaped us, leaving two off the goats  scarcely touched.    Thinking that in all probability the lion would return as usual to  finish his meal, I had a very strong scaffolding put up a few feet away  from the dead goats, and took up my position on it before dark. On this  occasion I brought my gun-bearer, Mahina, to take a turn at watching,  as I was by this time worn out for want of sleep, having spent so many  nights on the look-out. I was just dozing off comfortably when suddenly  I felt my arm seized, and on looking up saw Mahina pointing in the  direction of the goats. \"Sher!\" (\"Lion!\") was all he whispered. I  grasped my double smooth-bore, which, I had charged with slug, and  waited patiently. In a few moments I was rewarded, for as I watched the  spot where I expected the lion to appear, there was a rustling among  the bushes and I saw him stealthily emerge into the open and pass  almost directly beneath us. I fired both barrels practically together  into his shoulder, and to my joy could see him go down under the force  of the blow. Quickly I reached for the magazine rifle, but before I  could use it, he was out of sight among the bushes, and I had to fire  after him quite at random. Nevertheless I was confident of getting him  in the morning, and accordingly set out as soon as it was light. For  over a mile there was no difficulty in following the blood-trail, and  as he had rested several times I felt sure that he had been badly  wounded. In the end, however, my hunt proved fruitless, for after a  time the traces of blood ceased and the surface of the ground became  rocky, so that I was no longer able to follow the spoor.    About this time Sir Guilford Molesworth, K.C.I.E., late Consulting  Engineer to the Government of India for State Railways, passed through  Tsavo on a tour of inspection on behalf of the Foreign Office. After  examining the bridge and other works and expressing his satisfaction,  he took a number of photographs, one or two of which he has kindly  allowed me to reproduce in this book. He thoroughly sympathised with us  in all the trials we had endured from the man-eaters, and was delighted  that one at least"]]]
