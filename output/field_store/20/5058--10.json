So important were these Christmas celebrations deemed by our ancestors,  and such was the earnestness bestowed upon their preparation, that a  special officer was appointed for that purpose, and to preside over the  festival with large privileges, very considerable appointments, and a  retinue which in course of time came to be no insignificant imitation  of a prince's. We are of course speaking at present of the officer who  was appointed to the superintendence of the Christmas ceremonials _at  court_. The title by which this potentate was usually distinguished in  England was that of \"Lord of Misrule,\" \"Abbot of Misrule,\" or \"Master of  Merry Disports;\" and his office was, in fact, that of a temporary  \"Master of the Revels\" (which latter title was formerly that of a  permanent and distinguished officer attached to the household of our  kings). Accordingly we find that amongst those of the more powerful  nobles who affected an imitation of the royal arrangements in their  Christmas establishments, this Christmas officer (when they appointed  one to preside over their private Christmas celebrations) was  occasionally nominated as _their_ \"Master of the Revels.\" In the  Household-Book of the Northumberland family, amongst the directions  given for the order of the establishment, it is stated that \"My lorde  useth and accustomyth yerly to gyf hym which is ordynede to be the  MASTER OF THE REVELLS yerly in my lordis hous in cristmas for the  overseyinge and orderinge of his lordschips Playes, Interludes, and  Dresinge that is plaid befor his lordship in his hous in the xijth dayes  of Cristenmas, and they to have in rewarde for that caus yerly, xx_s_.\"  In the Inns of Court, where this officer formed no part of a household,  but was a member elected out of their own body for his ingenuity, he was  commonly dignified by a title more appropriate to the extensive  authority with which he was invested, and the state with which he was  furnished for its due maintenance; namely, that of \"Christmas Prince,\"  or sometimes \"King of Christmas.\" He is the same officer who was known  in Scotland as the \"Abbot of Unreason,\" and bears a close resemblance to  the \"Abbas Stultorum,\" who presided over the Feast of Fools in France,  and the \"Abbe de la Malgourverne,\" who ruled the sports in certain  provinces of that kingdom. In a note to Ellis's edition of Brand's  \"Popular Antiquities,\" we find a quotation from Mr. Warton (whose  \"History of English Poetry\" we have not at hand) in which mention is  made of an \"Abbe de Liesse,\" and a reference given to Carpentier's  Supplement to Du Cange, for the title \"Abbas Laetitiae.\" We mention these,  to enable the antiquarian portion of our readers to make the reference  for themselves. Writing in the country, we have not access to the works  in question, and could not, in these pages, go farther into the matter  if we had.    We have already stated that the \"Lord of Misrule\" appears to bear a  considerable resemblance to that ruler or king who was anciently  appointed to preside over the sports of the Roman Saturnalia; and we  find on looking farther into the subject, that we are corroborated in  this view by one who, of course, asserts the resemblance for the purpose  of making it a matter of reproach. The notorious Prynne, in his  \"Histrio-Mastix,\" affirms (and quotes Polydore Virgil to the same  effect) that \"our Christmas lords of Misrule, together with dancing,  masques, mummeries, stage-players, and such other Christmas disorders,  now in use with Christians, were derived from these Roman Saturnalia and  Bacchanalian festivals; which,\" adds he, \"should cause all pious  Christians eternally to abominate them.\" We should not, however, omit to  mention that by some this officer has been derived from the ancient  ceremony of the Boy-Bishop. Faber speaks of him as originating in an old  Persico-Gothic festival in honor of Buddha: and Purchas, in his  \"Pilgrimage,\" as quoted in the Aubrey manuscripts, says, that the custom  is deduced from the \"Feast in Babylon, kept in honour of the goddess  Dorcetha, for five dayes together; during which time the masters were  under the dominion of their servants, one of which is usually sett over  the rest, and royally cloathed, and was called Sogan, that is, Great  Prince.\"    The title, however, by which this officer is most generally known is  that of Lord of Misrule. \"There was,\" says Stow, \"in the feast of  Christmas, in the king's house, wheresoever he was lodged, a Lord of  Misrule, or Master of merry Disports; and the like had ye for the house  of every nobleman of honour or good worship, were he spiritual or  temporal. Among the which the Mayor of London and either of the Sheriffs  had their several Lords of Misrule ever contending, without quarrel or  offence, which should make the rarest pastimes to delight the  beholders.\"    Of the antiquity of this officer in England, we have not been able to  find any satisfactory account; but we discover traces of him almost as  early as we have any positive records of the various sports by which the  festival of this season was supported. Polydore Virgil speaks of the  splendid spectacles, the masques, dancings, etc., by which it was  illustrated as far back as the close of the twelfth century; and it is  reasonable to suppose that something in the shape of a master of these  public ceremonies must have existed then, to preserve order as well as  furnish devices, particularly as the hints for the one and the other  seem to have been taken from the celebrations of the heathens. As early  as the year 1489 Leland speaks of an Abbot of Misrule \"that made much  sport, and did right well his office.\" Henry the Seventh's \"boke of  paymentis,\" preserved in the Chapter House, is stated by Sandys to  contain several items of disbursement to the Lord of Misrule (or Abbot,  as he is therein sometimes called) for different years \"in rewarde for  his besynes in Christenmes holydays,\" none of which exceeded the sum of  L6. 13_s._ 4_d._ This sum--multiplied as we imagine it ought to be by  something like fifteen, to give the value thereof in our days--certainly  affords no very liberal remuneration to an officer whose duties were of  any extent; and we mention it that our readers may contrast it with the  lavish appointments of the same functionary in after times. Henry,  however, was a frugal monarch, though it was a part of his policy to  promote the amusements of the people; and from the treasures which that  frugality created, his immediate successors felt themselves at liberty  to assume a greater show. In the subsequent reign, the yearly payments  to the Lord of Misrule had already been raised as high as L15 6_s._  8_d._; and the entertainments over which he presided were furnished at a  proportionably increased cost.    It is not, however, until the reign of the young monarch, Edward the  Sixth, that this officer appears to have attained his highest dignities;  and during the subsequent reign we find him playing just such a part as  might be expected from one whose business it was to take the lead in  revels such as we have had occasion to describe; namely, that of  arch-buffoon.    In Hollinshed's Chronicle, honorable mention is made of a certain George  Ferrers, therein described as a \"lawyer, a poet, and an historian,\" who  supplied the office well in the fifth year of Edward the Sixth, and who  was rewarded by the young king with princely liberality. This George  Ferrers was the principal author of that well-known work, the \"Mirrour  for Magistrates;\" and Mr. Kempe, the editor of the recently published  \"Loseley Manuscripts,\" mentions his having been likewise distinguished  by military services, in the reign of Henry the Eighth. It appears that  the young king having fallen into a state of melancholy after the  condemnation of his uncle, the Protector, it was determined to celebrate  the approaching Christmas festival with more than usual splendor, for  the purpose of diverting his mind; and this distinguished individual was  selected to preside over the arrangements.    The publication of the \"Loseley Manuscripts\" enables us to present our  readers with some very curious particulars, illustrative at once of the  nature of those arrangements, and of the heavy cost at which they were  furnished. By an order in council,--dated the 31st of September, 1552,  and addressed to Sir Thomas Cawarden, at that time Master of the King's  Revels,--after reciting the appointment of the said George Ferrers, the  said Sir Thomas is informed that it is his Majesty's pleasure \"that you  se hym furneshed for hym and his bande, as well in apparell as all other  necessaries, of such stuff as remayneth in your office. And whatsoever  wanteth in the same, to take order that it be provided accordinglie by  yo^{r} discretion.\"    For the manner in which the Lord of Misrule availed himself of this  unlimited order, we recommend to such of our readers as the subject may  interest a perusal of the various estimates and accounts published by  Mr. Kempe from the manuscripts in question. Were it not that they would  occupy too much of our space, we should have been glad to introduce some  of them here, for the purpose of conveying to the reader a lively notion  of the gorgeousness of apparel and appointment exhibited on this  occasion. We must, however, present them with some idea of the train for  whom these costly preparations were made, and of the kind of mock court  with which the Lord of Misrule surrounded himself.    Amongst these we find mention made of a chancellor, treasurer,  comptroller, vice-chamberlain, lords-councillors, divine, philosopher,  astronomer, poet, physician, apothecary, master of requests, civilian,  disard (an"]]]
