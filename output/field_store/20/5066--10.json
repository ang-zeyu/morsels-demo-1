But this order of men are uninterested in the plain, palpable  ends of government; they do not prize them; they do not in the least  comprehend how they should be attained. It is very natural, therefore,  that the most useful parts of the structure of government should by no  means be those which excite the most reverence. The elements which  excite the most easy reverence will be the THEATRICAL elements--those  which appeal to the senses, which claim to be embodiments of the  greatest human ideas, which boast in some cases of far more than human  origin. That which is mystic in its claims; that which is occult in its  mode of action; that which is brilliant to the eye; that which is seen  vividly for a moment, and then is seen no more; that which is hidden  and unhidden; that which is specious, and yet interesting, palpable in  its seeming, and yet professing to be more than palpable in its  results; this, howsoever its form may change, or however we may define  it or describe it, is the sort of thing--the only sort--which yet comes  home to the mass of men. So far from the dignified parts of a  constitution being necessarily the most useful, they are likely,  according to outside presumption, to be the least so; for they are  likely to be adjusted to the lowest orders--those likely to care least  and judge worst about what IS useful.    There is another reason which, in an old constitution like that of  England, is hardly less important. The most intellectual of men are  moved quite as much by the circumstances which they are used to as by  their own will. The active voluntary part of a man is very small, and  if it were not economised by a sleepy kind of habit, its results would  be null. We could not do every day out of our own heads all we have to  do. We should accomplish nothing, for all our energies would be  frittered away in minor attempts at petty improvement. One man, too,  would go off from the known track in one direction, and one in another;  so that when a crisis came requiring massed combination, no two men  would be near enough to act together. It is the dull traditional habit  of mankind that guides most men's actions, and is the steady frame in  which each new artist must set the picture that he paints. And all this  traditional part of human nature is, ex vi termini, most easily  impressed and acted on by that which is handed down. Other things being  equal, yesterday's institutions are by far the best for to-day; they  are the most ready, the most influential, the most easy to get obeyed,  the most likely to retain the reverence which they alone inherit, and  which every other must win. The most imposing institutions of mankind  are the oldest; and yet so changing is the world, so fluctuating are  its needs, so apt to lose inward force, though retaining out ward  strength, are its best instruments, that we must not expect the oldest  institutions to be now the most efficient. We must expect what is  venerable to acquire influence because of its inherent dignity; but we  must not expect it to use that influence so well as new creations apt  for the modern world, instinct with its spirit, and fitting closely to  its life.    The brief description of the characteristic merit of the English  Constitution is, that its dignified parts are very complicated and  somewhat imposing, very old and rather venerable; while its efficient  part, at least when in great and critical action, is decidedly simple  and rather modern. We have made, or rather stumbled on, a constitution  which--though full of every species of incidental defect, though of the  worst workmanship in all out-of-the-way matters of any constitution in  the world--yet has two capital merits: it contains a simple efficient  part which, on occasion, and when wanted, can work more simply and  easily, and better, than any instrument of government that has yet been  tried; and it contains likewise historical, complex, august, theatrical  parts, which it has inherited from a long past--which take the  multitude--which guide by an insensible but an omnipotent influence the  associations of its subjects. Its essence is strong with the strength  of modern simplicity; its exterior is august with the Gothic grandeur  of a more imposing age. Its simple essence may, mutatis mutandis, be  transplanted to many very various countries, but its august  outside--what most men think it is--is narrowly confined to nations  with an analogous history and similar political materials.    The efficient secret of the English Constitution may be described as  the close union, the nearly complete fusion, of the executive and  legislative powers. No doubt by the traditional theory, as it exists in  all the books, the goodness of our constitution consists in the entire  separation of the legislative and executive authorities, but in truth  its merit consists in their singular approximation. The connecting link  is the Cabinet. By that new word we mean a committee of the legislative  body selected to be the executive body. The legislature has many  committees, but this is its greatest. It chooses for this, its main  committee, the men in whom it has most confidence. It does not, it is  true, choose them directly; but it is nearly omnipotent in choosing  them indirectly. A century ago the Crown had a real choice of  Ministers, though it had no longer a choice in policy. During the long  reign of Sir R. Walpole he was obliged not only to manage Parliament  but to manage the palace. He was obliged to take care that some court  intrigue did not expel him from his place. The nation then selected the  English policy, but the Crown chose the English Ministers. They were  not only in name, as now, but in fact, the Queen's servants. Remnants,  important remnants, of this great prerogative still remain. The  discriminating favour of William IV. made Lord Melbourne head of the  Whig party when he was only one of several rivals. At the death of Lord  Palmerston it is very likely that the Queen may have the opportunity of  fairly choosing between two, if not three statesmen. But, as a rule,  the nominal Prime Minister is chosen by the legislature, and the real  Prime Minister for most purposes--the leader of the House of  Commons--almost without exception is so. There is nearly always some  one man plainly selected by the voice of the predominant party in the  predominant house of the legislature to head that party, and  consequently to rule the nation. We have in England an elective first  magistrate as truly as the Americans have an elective first magistrate.  The Queen is only at the head of the dignified part of the  Constitution. The Prime Minister is at the head of the efficient part.  The Crown is, according to the saying, the \"fountain of honour\"; but  the Treasury is the spring of business. Nevertheless, our first  magistrate differs from the American. He is not elected directly by the  people; he is elected by the representatives of the people. He is an  example of \"double election\". The legislature chosen, in name, to make  laws, in fact finds its principal business in making and in keeping an  executive.    The leading Minister so selected has to choose his associates, but he  only chooses among a charmed circle. The position of most men in  Parliament forbids their being invited to the Cabinet; the position of  a few men ensures their being invited. Between the compulsory list whom  he must take, and the impossible list whom he cannot take, a Prime  Minister's independent choice in the formation of a Cabinet is not very  large; it extends rather to the division of the Cabinet offices than to  the choice of Cabinet Ministers. Parliament and the nation have pretty  well settled who shall have the first places; but they have not  discriminated with the same accuracy which man shall have which place.  The highest patronage of a Prime Minister is, of course, a considerable  power, though it is exercised under close and imperative  restrictions--though it is far less than it seems to be when stated in  theory, or looked at from a distance.    The Cabinet, in a word, is a board of control chosen by the  legislature, out of persons whom it trusts and knows, to rule the  nation. The particular mode in which the English Ministers are  selected; the fiction that they are, in any political sense, the  Queen's servants; the rule which limits the choice of the Cabinet to  the members of the legislature--are accidents unessential to its  definition--historical incidents separable from its nature. Its  characteristic is that it should be chosen by the legislature out of  persons agreeable to and trusted by the legislature. Naturally these  are principally its own members--but they need not be exclusively so. A  Cabinet which included persons not members of the legislative assembly  might still perform all useful duties. Indeed the peers, who constitute  a large element in modern Cabinets, are members, now-a-days, only of a  subordinate assembly. The House of Lords still exercises several useful  functions; but the ruling influence--the deciding faculty--has passed  to what, using the language of old times, we still call the lower  house--to an assembly which, though inferior as a dignified  institution, is superior as an efficient institution. A principal  advantage of the House of Lords in the present age indeed consists in  its thus acting as a reservoir of Cabinet Ministers. Unless the  composition of the House of Commons were improved, or unless the rules  requiring Cabinet Ministers to be members of the legislature were  relaxed, it would undoubtedly be difficult to find, without the lords,  a sufficient supply of chief Ministers. But the detail of the  composition of a Cabinet, and the precise method of its choice, are not  to the purpose now. The first and cardinal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#12)"],[1,"belongs to this  class. [Footnote: Labiche, \"Le Voyage de M. Perrichon.\"] There is no  necessity, however, for both the identical scenes to be played before  us. We may be shown only one, provided the other is really in our  minds. Thus, we laugh at the prisoner at the bar lecturing the  magistrate; at a child presuming to teach its parents; in a word, at  everything that comes under the heading of \"topsyturvydom.\" Not  infrequently comedy sets before us a character who lays a trap in which  he is the first to be caught. The plot of the villain who is the victim  of his own villainy, or the cheat cheated, forms the stock-in-trade of  a good many plays. We find this even in primitive farce. Lawyer  Pathelin tells his client of a trick to outwit the magistrate; the  client employs the self-same trick to avoid paying the lawyer. A  termagant of a wife insists upon her husband doing all the housework;  she has put down each separate item on a \"rota.\" Now let her fall into  a copper, her husband will refuse to drag her out, for \"that is not  down on his 'rota.'\" In modern literature we meet with hundreds of  variations on the theme of the robber robbed. In every case the root  idea involves an inversion of roles, and a situation which recoils on  the head of its author.    Here we apparently find the confirmation of a law, some illustrations  of which we have already pointed out. When a comic scene has been  reproduced a number of times, it reaches the stage of being a classical  type or model. It becomes amusing in itself, quite apart from the  causes which render it amusing. Henceforth, new scenes, which are not  comic de jure, may become amusing de facto, on account of their partial  resemblance to this model. They call up in our mind a more or less  confused image which we know to be comical. They range themselves in a  category representing an officially recognised type of the comic. The  scene of the \"robber robbed\" belongs to this class. It casts over a  host of other scenes a reflection of the comic element it contains. In  the end it renders comic any mishap that befalls one through one's own  fault, no matter what the fault or mishap may be,--nay, an allusion to  this mishap, a single word that recalls it, is sufficient. There would  be nothing amusing in the saying, \"It serves you right, George Dandin,\"  were it not for the comic overtones that take up and re-echo it.    3. We have dwelt at considerable length on repetition and inversion; we  now come to the reciprocal interference [Footnote: The word  \"interference\" has here the meaning given to it in Optics, where it  indicates the partial superposition and neutralisation, by each other,  of two series of light-waves.] of series. This is a comic effect, the  precise formula of which is very difficult to disentangle, by reason of  the extraordinary variety of forms in which it appears on the stage.  Perhaps it might be defined as follows: A situation is invariably comic  when it belongs simultaneously to two altogether independent series of  events and is capable of being interpreted in two entirely different  meanings at the same time.    You will at once think of an equivocal situation. And the equivocal  situation is indeed one which permits of two different meanings at the  same time, the one merely plausible, which is put forward by the  actors, the other a real one, which is given by the public. We see the  real meaning of the situation, because care has been taken to show us  every aspect of it; but each of the actors knows only one of these  aspects: hence the mistakes they make and the erroneous judgments they  pass both on what is going on around them and on what they are doing  themselves. We proceed from this erroneous judgment to the correct one,  we waver between the possible meaning and the real, and it is this  mental seesaw between two contrary interpretations which is at first  apparent in the enjoyment we derive from an equivocal situation. It is  natural that certain philosophers should have been specially struck by  this mental instability, and that some of them should regard the very  essence of the ludicrous as consisting in the collision or coincidence  of two judgments that contradict each other. Their definition, however,  is far from meeting every case, and even when it does, it defines--not  the principle of the ludicrous, but only one of its more or less  distant consequences. Indeed, it is easy to see that the stage-made  misunderstanding is nothing but a particular instance of a far more  general phenomenon,--the reciprocal interference of independent series,  and that, moreover, it is not laughable in itself, but only as a sign  of such an interference.    As a matter of fact, each of the characters in every stage-made  misunderstanding has his setting in an appropriate series of events  which he correctly interprets as far as he is concerned, and which give  the key-note to his words and actions. Each of the series peculiar to  the several characters develop independently, but at a certain moment  they meet under such conditions that the actions and words that belong  to one might just as well belong to another. Hence arise the  misunderstandings and the equivocal nature of the situation. But this  latter is not laughable in itself, it is so only because it reveals the  coincidence of the two independent series. The proof of this lies in  the fact that the author must be continually taxing his ingenuity to  recall our attention to the double fact of independence and  coincidence. This he generally succeeds in doing by constantly renewing  the vain threat of dissolving partnership between the two coinciding  series. Every moment the whole thing threatens to break down, but  manages to get patched up again; it is this diversion that excites  laughter, far more than the oscillation of the mind between two  contradictory ideas. It makes us laugh because it reveals to us the  reciprocal interference of two independent series, the real source of  the comic effect.    And so the stage-made misunderstanding is nothing more than one  particular instance, one means--perhaps the most artificial--of  illustrating the reciprocal interference of series, but it is not the  only one. Instead of two contemporary series, you might take one series  of events belonging to the past and another belonging to the present:  if the two series happen to coincide in our imagination, there will be  no resulting cross-purposes, and yet the same comic effect will  continue to take place. Think of Bonivard, captive in the Castle of  Chillon: one series of facts. Now picture to yourself Tartarin,  travelling in Switzerland, arrested and imprisoned: second series,  independent of the former. Now let Tartarin be manacled to Bonivard's  chain, thus making the two stories seem for a moment to coincide, and  you will get a very amusing scene, one of the most amusing that  Daudet's imagination has pictured. [Tartarin sur les Alpes, by Daudet.]  Numerous incidents of the mock-heroic style, if analysed, would reveal  the same elements. The transposition from the ancient to the  modern--always a laughable one--draws its inspiration from the same  idea. Labiche has made use of this method in every shape and form.  Sometimes he begins by building up the series separately, and then  delights in making them interfere with one another: he takes an  independent group--a wedding-party, for instance--and throws them into  altogether unconnected surroundings, into which certain coincidences  allow of their being foisted for the time being. Sometimes he keeps one  and the same set of characters right through the play, but contrives  that certain of these characters have something to conceal--have, in  fact, a secret understanding on the point--in short, play a smaller  comedy within the principal one: at one moment, one of the two comedies  is on the point of upsetting the other; the next, everything comes  right and the coincidence between the two series is restored.  Sometimes, even, he introduces into the actual series a purely  immaterial series of events, an inconvenient past, for instance, that  some one has an interest in concealing, but which is continually  cropping up in the present, and on each occasion is successfully  brought into line with situations with which it seemed destined to play  havoc. But in every case we find the two independent series, and also  their partial coincidence.    We will not carry any further this analysis of the methods of light  comedy. Whether we find reciprocal interference of series, inversion,  or repetition, we see that the objective is always the same--to obtain  what we have called a MECHANISATION of life. You take a set of actions  and relations and repeat it as it is, or turn it upside down, or  transfer it bodily to another set with which it partially  coincides--all these being processes that consist in looking upon life  as a repeating mechanism, with reversible action and interchangeable  parts. Actual life is comedy just so far as it produces, in a natural  fashion, actions of the same kind,--consequently, just so far as it  forgets itself, for were it always on the alert, it would be  ever-changing continuity, irrevertible progress, undivided unity. And  so the ludicrous in events may be defined as absentmindedness in  things, just as the ludicrous in an individual character always results  from some fundamental absentmindedness in the person, as we have  already intimated and shall prove later on. This absentmindedness in  events, however, is exceptional. Its results are slight. At any rate it  is incurable, so that it is useless to laugh at it. Therefore the idea  would never have occurred to any one of exaggerating that  absentmindedness, of converting it into a system and creating an art  for it, if laughter were not always a pleasure and mankind did not  pounce upon the slightest excuse for indulging"]]]
