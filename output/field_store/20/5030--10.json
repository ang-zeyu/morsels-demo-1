The deer mice seemed  to prefer a sparser vegetation and did not approach so closely to the  forest edge as did the voles. It may have been, in part, the presence of  _P. leucopus_ in the ecotonal region which made it unsuitable for _P.  maniculatus_.    Other mammals noted on the study areas were the following: _Didelphis  marsupialis_, _Blarina brevicauda_, _Scalopus aquaticus_, _Canis  familiaris_, _Canis latrans_, _Procyon lotor_, _Felis domesticus_,  _Sylvilagus floridanus_, _Microtus pinetorum_, _Mus musculus_ and _Zapus  hudsonius_.          SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS      In the 23-month period from October, 1950, to August, 1952, the ecology  of the prairie vole, _Microtus ochrogaster_, was investigated on the  Natural History Reservation of the University of Kansas. In all, 817  voles were captured 2941 times in 13,880 \"live-trap days.\" For some  aspects of this study, Dr. Henry S. Fitch, resident investigator on the  Reservation, permitted the use of his trapping records. He had captured  1416 voles 5098 times. The total number of live voles used in the study  was thus 2233, and they were captured 8039 times. In addition to the  voles, I caught 96 cotton rats, 108 harvest mice, 29 wood mice, 2 pine  voles and 6 deer mice in live traps. When Fitch's records were used, the  live-trapping data covered a thirty-month period and general field data  were available from July, 1949, to August, 1952.    Hall and Cockrum (1953:406) stated that probably all microtine rodents  fluctuate markedly in numbers. Certainly the populations I studied did  so, but the fluctuations were not regularly recurring for _M.  ochrogaster_ as they seem to be for some species of the genus in more  northern life zones. The changes in the density of populations described  in this paper can be explained without recourse to cycles of long  time-span and literature dealing specifically with _M. ochrogaster_  makes no references to such cycles. There is, however, an annual cycle  of abundance: greatest density of population occurs in autumn, and the  least density in January.    This annual pattern is often, perhaps usually, obscured because of the  extreme sensitivity of voles to a variety of changes in their  environment. These changes are reflected as variations in reproductive  success. In this study, some of these changes were accentuated by the  great range in annual precipitation. Annual rainfall was approximately  average in 1950 (36.32 inches, 0.92 inches above normal), notably high  in 1951 (50.68 inches, 15.28 inches above normal) and notably low in  1952 (23.80 inches, 11.60 inches below normal).    Among the types of environmental modification to which the populations  of voles reacted were plant succession, an increase in competition with  _Sigmodon_, abnormal rainfall and concentration of predators. In the  overgrazed disclimax existing in 1948 when the study areas were  reserved, no voles were found because cover was insufficient. After the  area was protected a succession of good growing years hastened the  recovery of the grasses and the populations of voles reached high  levels. In areas where the vegetation approached the climax community,  the densities of voles decreased from the levels supported by the  immediately preceding seral stages. The higher carrying capacity of  these earlier seral stages was probably due to the greater variety of  herbaceous vegetation which tended to maintain a more constant supply of  young and growing parts of plants which were the preferred food of  voles. Later in the period of study the succession from grasses to woody  plants on parts of the study areas also affected the population of  voles. Not only did the voles withdraw from the advancing edge of the  forest, but their density decreased in the meadows as the number of  shrubs and other woody plants increased. These influences of the  succession of plants on the population density of voles were exerted  through changes in cover and in the quality, as well as the quantity, of  the food supply.    Whenever voles were in competition with cotton rats, there was a  depression in the population levels of voles. Primarily, the competition  between the two species is the result of an extensive coincidence of  food habits, but competition for space, cover and nesting material is  also present. There was one direct coaction between these two species  observed. Cotton rats, at least occasionally, ate voles, especially  young individuals. In extremely wet weather, as in the summer of 1951,  the high survival rate of newborn cotton rats resulted in an increase in  their detrimental effect on the population of voles. However, cotton  rats proved to be less well adapted to severe cold or drought than were  voles.    Heavy rainfall reduced the densities of populations of voles by killing  a large percentage of juveniles. During the summer of 1951 the  competition of cotton rats further depressed the population level of the  voles, but the relative importance of competition with cotton rats and  superabundant moisture in effecting the observed reduction in population  density is difficult to judge. Perhaps most of the decrease in  population which followed the heavy rains was due to competition rather  than to weather. Subnormal rainfall, as in 1952, reduced the population  of voles by inhibiting reproduction. Presumably because of an altered  food supply, reproduction almost ceased during the drought. Utilization  of the habitat was further reduced in the summer of 1952 because the  voles did not grow so large as they otherwise did.    Predation, as a general rule, does not significantly affect densities of  populations, but large numbers of predators concentrating on small areas  may rapidly reduce the numbers of prey animals. In the course of my  study, such a situation occurred but once, when a group of long-eared  owls roosted in the woods adjacent to Quarry Field. The population of  voles in that area was probably reduced somewhat as a result of  predation by owls.    Population trends in either direction may be reversed suddenly by  changes in the factors discussed above. In the fall of 1951, a downward  trend in the density of the voles was evident. At this time, populations  of cotton rats were increasing rapidly and competition between cotton  rats and voles was intensified. In February, 1952, the population of  cotton rats was decimated suddenly by a short period of unusually cold  weather. The voles were suddenly freed from the stress of competition  and the population immediately began to rise. The upward trend began  prior to the annual spring increase and was subsequently reinforced by  it. In the last part of May, 1952, the upward trend of the population  was reversed, as the drought became severe, and the density of the  population decreased rapidly. This drop was too sudden and too extreme  to be only the normal summer slump. The relatively rapid response of  voles to a heavy rain after a dry period, first by increased breeding  and later by increases in density, is one more example of abrupt changes  in population trends caused by altered environmental conditions.    In the population changes that I observed, no evident \"die-off\" of  adults accompanied even the most drastic reductions in population  density. The causative factor directly influences the population either  by inhibiting reproduction or by increasing infant and prenatal  mortality. The net reduction is due to an inadequate replacement of  those voles lost by normal attrition.    Most voles, under natural conditions, live less than one year. Those  individuals born in the autumn live longer, as a group, than those born  at any other time. Since the heaviest mortality is in young voles,  adults which become established in an area may live more than 18 months  and, if they are females, may produce more than a dozen litters. No  decrease in vigor and fertility was found to accompany aging. A  relationship between the condylobasilar length of the skull and the age  of a vole was discovered and, with further study, may yield a method of  aging voles more accurately than has been possible heretofore. Other  characteristics, varying with age, were described. The most reliable  indicator of age seemed to be the prominence of the temporal ridges.    Runway systems and burrows are used by groups of voles rather than by  individuals. Most of the activity of voles is confined to these runways  and an exposed individual is seldom seen. A home range may include  several runway systems, and the ranges of individuals overlap  extensively. Both home ranges and patterns of runway systems change  constantly. Runways seem to be primarily feeding trails, and are  extended or abandoned as the voles change their feeding habits. Groups  of adult voles using a system of runways seem to have no special  relationship. Juveniles tend to stay near their mothers, but as they  mature, they shift their ranges and are replaced by other individuals.  Males wander more than females, and shift their ranges more often. No  intolerance of other voles exists and, in laboratory cages, groups of  voles lived together peaceably from the time they are placed together.  Crowding does not seem to be harmful directly, therefore, and high  densities will develop if food and cover resources permit.    As a prey item, the prairie vole proved to be an important part of the  biota of the Reservation. It was eaten frequently by almost all of the  larger vertebrate predators on the Reservation and was, seemingly, the  most important food item of the long-eared owl. The ability of the  prairie vole to maintain high levels of population over relatively broad  areas enhances its value as a prey species.          LITERATURE CITED      ALBERTSON, F. W.         1937.

There were numbers of blue hares, however, and some ram  chakor, the Himalayan snow cock. But beyond this the hillsides were very  bare of game. There were pin-cushions of a beautiful little blue sedum  growing at a height of over 17,000 feet, also there was a big red  stonecrop. Khe is now only a small and dirty village with practically no  water except a half-dried muddy pond, but at one time it must have been  a place of some importance, as ruins and buildings of considerable size  extend over an area of more than a mile. The Kala-tso evidently at one  time came right up to this ruined town of Khetam, and the fact that it  is deserted now is probably due to the shrinkage of the lake. This was  only one of the many signs of desiccation that we saw in our travels in  Tibet. There were some curious ruins which looked like old crenellated  walls, but these walls were only places on which barley dough used to be  exposed to feed the crows as a sign of prosperity. It was a curious  custom and could only have prevailed in a very fertile valley, which  this place is no longer. The age of the city I could not find out, but  the few survivors told me that the holy shrine at Tashilumpo, which now  is at Shigatse, ought to have been built here. According to a local  legend, there was a certain stone in Khetam shaped like a ewe's-womb,  and one day a donkey driver finding that his loads were unequal in  weight, picked up this stone and put it on the light load to balance the  other, quite unaware of the importance of the stone. This stone was then  carried from Gyantse to Shigatse, where a high and important Lama saw  it, and recognising that this was a very holy stone, had it kept there.  The powerful monastery of Tashilumpo was built over this stone. We  passed two small nunneries called Doto and Shidag in snug little valleys  to the North of the plain, and on asking why there should be so many  nunneries in these parts when in the greater part of Tibet men  predominated, I was told that this was due to the fact that it was close  to the Nepalese frontier where there had always been much fighting, so  that most of the men had been killed and only women had survived. After  a short and easy march we came to a small pocket in the hills called  Kheru. Here were encamped some people belonging to a nomad tribe who  always lived in tents. They were very friendly, put tents at our  disposal, and did their best to make us comfortable. They told us that  they came here every year in the twelfth month, about January, and left  again in the fifth month of the Tibetan year (June) for a place near  Tuna, where they disposed of their wool, butter and cheese at the Phari  market. There were altogether about twenty families here owning some 200  yaks and 3,000 sheep. Dr. Kellas was slightly better, but Raeburn was  not feeling at all well, and Wheeler was suffering from indigestion, so  that we were rather a sick party. Kheru lies at a height of 15,700 feet,  but it had been very hot all day in the brilliant sunshine, and on the  way we had passed lizards and a number of common peacock butterflies.  Next morning our march was to Tatsang (Falcon's Nest), a distance of 15  or 16 miles, and over two passes 16,450 and 17,100 feet. The going was  easy all the way, as the gradients both up and down the passes were very  gentle. Between the two passes was a broad valley, filled with huge  flocks of sheep and herds of yaks, and after crossing the second pass,  we descended into a great barren and stony plain, more than 10 miles  across which was Tatsang and over which the wind blew very keenly. To  the South of us appeared the snowy crests of Pawhunri, Kanchenjhow and  Chomiomo and the Lhonak peaks. Again I did not keep with the transport,  but followed the crests of the hills, where I had lovely views; on the  way I saw plenty of gazelle, and was lucky enough to shoot one of them,  as they are very good eating. Our camp at Tatsang was pitched just below  the nunnery there, which is on the top of a rock and where there are  about thirty nuns. Our camp was on a pleasant grassy spot where some  excellent springs bubble up out of the ground. These within a few yards  formed quite a big stream full of small snow trout. They do not really  belong to the trout family, although they have somewhat similar spots,  and are very good to eat. Bullock, with his butterfly net, and the  coolies with their hands, managed to catch quite a number of fish, and  we had them for dinner that night. The ground round our tents was full  of holes out of which the marmot rats kept appearing. They were very  tame, and did not seem to be in the least afraid of us. Dr. Kellas had  had a very trying day. He had been rather better, and had started  riding a yak, but he found this too exhausting and coolies had to be  sent back from Tatsang to bring him on in a litter, so that he did not  arrive at Tatsang till late in the evening. Tatsang is 16,000 feet, so  the night was cold, the thermometer inside the tent registering 7 deg. of  frost, though it was June 4; outside there must have been quite 15 deg. as  the running streams were all frozen over, but once the sun had risen  everything warmed up and we had a beautiful warm day. Dr. Kellas started  off in his litter at 7 a.m. in quite good spirits. I did not start till  an hour later, as I had wanted to see everything off, and then went up  to visit the nunnery, over which the lady abbess showed me. There were  thirty nuns living there, all with shorn heads and wearing a curious  wool head-dress. The place where they worshipped was full of prayer  wheels, both large and small. They sat down behind these, and each nun  turned one or two of them if they could manage it. The room was very  dark, with a low ceiling, and at the end were several statues of Buddha  covered over with gauze veils. In another room there was a large prayer  wheel which they said contained half a million prayers.    After leaving the nunnery we jogged along a dry and barren valley which  gradually rose in about 12 miles to a pass 17,200 feet. On the way we  passed Dr. Kellas in his litter, who then seemed to me to be still quite  cheerful. I then rode on and at the top of the pass saw three ovis  ammon, and after a chase of about a mile I shot one, which afforded  plenty of food for the coolies for some days. It was a full grown ram  about five years old and we had great trouble in getting the carcass on  to a mule, as it was enormous and very heavy. After this I rode on down  the valley for another 10 miles to Khamba Dzong. There were actually a  few bushes in this valley, which was carpeted with the pretty pink  trumpet-shaped flower mentioned above, also with light and dark blue  iris. Suddenly the valley narrowed into a fine limestone gorge, and all  at once the fort of Khamba Dzong appeared towering above us on the  cliffs. It was really a very impressive sight and some of the  architecture of the round towers was very fine. I found that Morshead  had been waiting here for about nine days, but had employed his time in  fixing the old triangulation points. Soon after I arrived the Jongpen  came down to pay us a visit. He was quite a young fellow, only about  twenty-four, but very pleasant and polite.    While we were talking, a man came running up to us very excitedly to say  that Dr. Kellas had suddenly died on the way. We could hardly believe  this, as he was apparently gradually getting better; but Wollaston at  once rode off to see if it was true, and unfortunately found that there  was no doubt about it. It was a case of sudden failure of the heart, due  to his weak condition, while being carried over the high pass. His death  meant a very great loss to the Expedition in every way, as he alone was  qualified to carry out the experiments in oxygen and blood pressure  which would have been so valuable to the Expedition, and on which  subject he was so great an expert. His very keenness had been the cause  of his illness, for he had tried his constitution too severely in the  early months of that year by expeditions into the heart of the Himalayas  to see if he could get fresh photographs from other angles of Mount  Everest. The following day we buried him on the slopes of the hill to  the South of Khamba Dzong, in a site unsurpassed for beauty that looks  across the broad plains of Tibet to the mighty chain of the Himalayas  out of which rise up the three great peaks of Pawhunri, Kanchenjhow and  Chomiomo, which he alone had climbed. From the same spot, far away to  the West--more than a hundred miles away--could be seen the snowy crest  of Mount Everest towering far above all the other mountains. He lies,  therefore, within sight of his greatest feats in climbing and within  view of the mountain that he had longed for so many years to approach--a  fitting resting-place for a great mountaineer.

They called this enclosure a Bagichah, or garden, because it once  boasted of three willow trees. Only one of these three is alive to-day,  the other two being merely dead stumps of wood. The Jongpen here, who  was under the direct orders of Shigatse, was very friendly, and after  our arrival presented us with five live sheep, a hundred eggs, and a  small carpet which he had had made in his own factory in the fort. Next  afternoon Morshead, Wollaston and myself went up to pay the Jongpen a  visit in his fort. It was a steep climb from our camp, past long  Mendongs or Mani walls covered with inscribed prayers. The Jongpen was  at the entrance waiting to receive us. He then showed us over his  stables, where he had several nice Tibetan "]]]
