But when the man found that he could not catch the hare, he gave up  the chase, and went home disconsolate; and so the hare went back,  searching for his friend, and shouting his name. But when he found him  and demanded his share of the spoil, the monkey offered only the skins  of the plantains, and the hare, in his rage, said that he would have  his revenge. So, first of all, he went and sat very quietly under  some kachu plants. Then the monkey climbed down from the tree and  began crying \"My friend! my friend!\" and the hare replied \"Who are you  calling friend? I am watching the king's sugarcane field. What do you  want?\" Then the monkey came forth and said \"Ah, my friend, give me  a little of the cane to suck.\" But the hare said \"I cannot give you  any. If the Raja were to hear, he would beat me.\" But as the monkey  grew importunate, he said \"Eat, then, if you will, and don't blame  me.\" But when he ate, the acrid juice of the kachu caught his tongue,  and he rolled on the ground howling. But the hare only said \"It's your  own fault. I told you not to.\" Then he went and sat beneath a wasps'  nest. And the monkey, moaning and complaining, followed him and asked  him what he was doing there, and the hare replied that he was watching  the king's cymbals. \"Let me play on them, only a little!\" entreated  the monkey. But the hare said \"I daren't do it. The Raja would kill  me.\" \"I will only play very gently,\" said the monkey, and, prevailing  by means of his importunity, clapped his hands on the wasps' nest and  broke it, and straightway the wasps stung his mouth and face and body  all over, so that he rolled on the ground crying out in agony. But  the hare only said \"I told you not to, and you would not listen, what  could I do?\" And then he went away to where a gowal snake lay. And  again the monkey followed him, and asked what he was doing there. And  the hare said that he was watching the king's sceptre. \"Ah! let me  brandish it, do,\" said the monkey, and for all the hare's warnings  would seize the sceptre. Whereby he got bitten, and was in greater  pain than ever. Then the rabbit went away and sat down on a marsh,  and the monkey followed him once more, crying as he went, and when  he again questioned his friend, the hare said: \"This is what they  call the king's litter.\" \"Let me sit on it for a moment,\" said the  monkey. \"I can't do it,\" said the hare, \"what would the king say? I  think you are a fool, my friend. I tell you not to do things and you  will persist.\" But the monkey did not listen to him and jumped on  to the marsh and stuck miserably in the mud. And then the hare said  \"Now, my friend, you give me plantain skins to eat, do you? You can  stay where you are. I wish you good-day. I am off.\" And, so saying,  he left the monkey and went his ways.    And first of all a rhinoceros came. But when the monkey begged for  help, he said that he was hungry and thirsty, and really could not  stop; he was very sorry; and, so saying, he too went away.    And when a buffalo presently came, the monkey addressed him, but he,  too, had other business, and went away. Last of all there came a tiger,  who was extremely hungry, and to him the monkey said, \"My father, if  you do not help me out of this scrape, I have no help left,\" and with  such and such like words the monkey entreated him. But the tiger said  \"What good will it do me if I help you?\" and was going away, when the  monkey cried out \"Father, father, take me out of the dreadful marsh,  and then, if you like, clean me and eat me.\" And the tiger was so  hungry that he said: \"It is not so much that I want to eat you, but  if I rescue one fallen into such calamity, it will be well with me  hereafter. However, as you yourself have offered yourself to be eaten,  I see no harm.\" So saying, he stretched out his tail into the marsh,  and the monkey, grasping it, was drawn out. Then the monkey said:  \"Let me get dry in the sun, and when I am a bit cleaner, you can  eat me.\" And so saying he sat him down in the sun and waited. But  presently the tiger looked another way, and the monkey slipped up a  tall tree. But the tiger, being in a great rage, waited two or three  days at the foot of the tree. But, as the monkey would not descend,  he lay at the tree's root as one dead, and opened his mouth with  his teeth grinning, and the flies came and buzzed in his mouth,  so that at last the monkey thought that of a verity he was dead. So  finally he crawled down, and slowly inserted his tail in the tiger's  mouth. But the tiger never stirred. Then he felt one of the tiger's  great paws. But the tiger never stirred. Then the monkey said \"Ah, you  would scrunch my bones to make your bread, would you?\" and danced about  gaily, and cried \"See if you can eat my head now,\" and, so saying,  he put his head in the tiger's jaws. And then the jaws closed with  a scrunch, and that was the end of the monkey. And that's all!            THE TORTOISE AND MONKEY.    A tortoise and a monkey were great friends, and as they were on the  road one day, a man passed laden with plantains. And the monkey, seeing  him, said \"You go and wait on the road, and when the man pursues you,  run away. And so the man put down his load (the monkey having hid in  the jungle), and ran after the tortoise. Then the monkey came out of  the jungle and took the plantains and molasses that the man bare,  and climbed with them into a tree. Then the man, not being able  to catch the tortoise, returned, and, not getting his things, went  home. Then the tortoise returned and asked his friend for his share  of the plantains and molasses. And the monkey offered him for molasses  potsherds, and for plantains their skins only; and, when the tortoise  insisted, the monkey got angry and hoisted his friend into the tree,  saying \"See for yourself, if any plantains or molasses be left.\" And  so he went away and left him. And he could not get down, and one by  one various animals came under the tree, but could not help him. And  last of these came a very aged rhinoceros, and the tortoise begged  leave to jump down on his back. And to this the rhinoceros consented,  and so the tortoise leapt down, with such force that he broke the  old rhinoceros' back. Then he covered up the corpse with leaves, and  going to the king's court, sat him down under the king's throne; and,  when the royal council was assembled, the tortoise sneezed loudly,  \"Who dared to sneeze?\" said the king. \"Cut off his nose!\" But they all  with one accord declared that they had not sneezed, and, after he had  sneezed once or twice again, some one saw the tortoise under the king's  throne. So he said respectfully \"If your Majesty wishes, you can kill  me, but I have something to say: There is some living thing under your  Majesty's throne. Without doubt, it was that which sneezed.\" On which  the king, looking under his throne, saw the tortoise, and ordered them  to cut off his nose. But the tortoise said \"Do not cut off my nose,  and in return I will give your Majesty a rhinoceros.\" And at first  the king was angry, but for his entreating gave him men with him to  fetch his rhinoceros, and when the men returned with the body of the  rhinoceros, the king was very pleased, and gave the tortoise a horse.    And as he was riding off, he met the monkey and told him that the  king had given him the horse. And when the monkey asked him why,  he said that he had jumped on to a common lizard from the tree, on  which the monkey had left him and had killed it. And that then he had  covered it up with leaves and told the king it was a rhinoceros. And  the king was pleased and gave him a horse. So the monkey killed a  lizard, and went and told the king it was a rhinoceros, and got his  nose cut off for his pains. And that's all!            THE BRAHMIN AND HIS SERVANT.    There was once a Brahmin who had a servant. And one day when they  were going to the house of the Brahmin's mother-in-law, the Brahmin  gave his servant a bunch of plantains and other things to carry, and  said to him \"Now, mind you don't eat those plantains, for I can see  just as well behind as I can in front.\" And, so saying, he marched  ahead. And presently the servant, getting hungry, plucked one of the  plantains from the bunch, and, holding it out to his master's back,  ate it. And this he did again and again till all the plantains were  gone. And when the Brahmin presently asked what had become of the  load, the servant said \"You told me you could see behind as well  as in front. So I showed you each plantain before I ate it. And you  never said anything.\"    So the Brahmin went his ways speechless. Presently they stopped  to cook their midday meal, and they had got with them a few khawai  fish. But the Brahmin gave only one to his servant, and kept the rest  himself. And when he was about to eat, the servant asked innocently:  \"Oh! Brahmin, do khawai fish swim about singly or in shoals?\" To which  the Brahmin said: \"Why, in shoals, of course.\" So the servant said  \"Then my fish had better go with yours.\" And, so saying, he threw his  fish on the Brahmin's mess, which was defiled. So the Brahmin got no  dinner, and the servant ate the whole.    A little later they came across a number of simul trees. Seeing them,  the servant asked his master \"And what do they call these trees,  master?\" And the Brahmin (being an educated man) said \"These are  sirmolu.\" But the servant said \"Not so, not so! These are himulu,\" and  offered to bet five blows that it was so. And, meeting some cowherd  boys, he asked them what the trees were. And when they said \"himulu\"  he gave the Brahmin five blows without further question.    Next they met a drove of goats. \"And what may these be, Brahmin,  these animals that are grazing?\" And the Brahmin said \"These be called  châg.\" But the servant cried \"Not so, not so! These are châgali.\" And  the result, as before, was that the Brahmin was worsted and got  five blows."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53526"],[0,"Cardinal Wolsey (#12)"],[1," satisfaction before anything else could be considered. Wolsey  commissioned Tunstal to adopt a lofty tone. \"It would be great folly,\"  he says, \"for this young prince, not being more surely settled in his  dominions, and so ill-provided with treasure and good councillors, the  Pope also being so brittle and variable, to be led into war for the  pleasure of his ministers.\" Truly Wolsey thought he had taken the  measure of those with whom he dealt, and spoke with sufficient plainness  when occasion needed. But Charles's chancellor, Gattinara, a  Piedmontese, who was rising into power, was as obstinate as Wolsey, and  rejected the English proposals with equal scorn. \"Your master,\" he said  to Tunstal, \"would have the Emperor break with France, but would keep  himself free; he behaves like a man with two horses, one of which he  rides, and leads the other by the hand.\" It was clear that nothing could  be done, and Wolsey with some delight recalled Tunstal from his embassy.  The closer alliance with the Emperor was at an end for the present; he  had shown again that England would only forego her mediating position on  her own terms.    At the same time he dealt an equal measure of rebuff to France. Before  the conference at Guisnes Francis had done some work towards rebuilding  the ruined walls of Ardres on the French frontier. After the conference  the work was continued till England resented it as an unfriendly act.  Francis was obliged to give way, and order the building to be stopped.  Neither Francis nor Charles were allowed to presume on the complacency  of England, nor use their alliance with her to further their own  purposes.    The general aspect of affairs was so dubious that it was necessary for  England to be prepared for any emergency, and first of all Scotland must  be secured as far as possible. Since the fall of James IV. at Flodden  Field, Scotland had been internally unquiet. Queen Margaret gave birth  to a son a few months after her husband's death, and, to secure her  position, took the unwise step of marrying the Earl of Angus. The  enemies of Angus and the national party in Scotland joined together to  demand that the Regency should be placed in firmer hands, and they  summoned from France the Duke of Albany, a son of the second son of  James III., who had been born in exile, and was French in all the  traditions of his education. When Albany came to Scotland as Regent,  Queen Margaret and Angus were so assailed that Margaret had to flee to  England for refuge in 1515, leaving her son in Albany's care. She stayed  in England till the middle of 1517, when she was allowed to return to  Scotland on condition that she took no part in public affairs. About the  same time Albany returned to France, somewhat weary of his Scottish  charge. By his alliance with Francis Henry contrived that Albany should  not return to Scotland; but he could not contrive to give his sister  Margaret the political wisdom which was needed to draw England and  Scotland nearer together. Margaret quarrelled with her husband Angus,  and only added another element of discord to those which previously  existed. The safest way for England to keep Scotland helpless was to  encourage forays on the Border. The Warden of the Western Marches, Lord  Dacre of Naworth, was admirably adapted to work with Wolsey for this  purpose. Without breaking the formal peace which existed between the two  nations, he developed a savage and systematic warfare, waged in the  shape of Border raids, which was purposely meant to devastate the  Scottish frontier, so as to prevent a serious invasion from the Scottish  side. Still Henry VIII. was most desirous to keep Scotland separate from  France; but the truce with Scotland expired in November 1520. Wolsey  would gladly have turned the truce into a perpetual peace; but Scotland  still clung to its French alliance, and all that Wolsey could achieve  was a prolongation of the truce till 1522. He did so, however, with the  air of one who would have preferred war; and Francis I. was induced to  urge the Scots to sue for peace, and accept as a favour what England was  only too glad to grant.    At the same time an event occurred in England which showed in an  unmistakable way the determination of Henry to go his own way and allow  no man to question it. In April 1520 the Duke of Buckingham, one of the  wealthiest of the English nobles, was imprisoned on an accusation of  high treason. In May he was brought to trial before his peers, was found  guilty, and was executed. The charges against him were trivial if true;  the witnesses were members of his household who bore him a grudge. But  the king heard their testimony in his Council, and committed the duke to  the Tower. None of the nobles of England dared differ from their  imperious master. If the king thought fit that Buckingham should die,  they would not run the risk of putting any obstacle in the way of the  royal will. Trials for treason under Henry VIII. were mere formal acts  of registration of a decision already formed.    The Duke of Buckingham, no doubt, was a weak and foolish man, and may  have done and said many foolish things. He was in some sense justified  in regarding himself as the nearest heir to the English throne if Henry  left no children to succeed him. Henry had been married for many years,  and as yet there was no surviving child save the Princess Mary. It was  unwise to talk about the succession to the Crown after Henry's death; it  was criminal to disturb the minds of Englishmen who had only so lately  won the blessings of internal peace. If the Duke of Buckingham had  really done so, he would not be undeserving of punishment; but the  evidence against him was slight, and its source was suspicious. No doubt  Buckingham was incautious, and made himself a mouthpiece of the  discontent felt by the nobles at the French alliance and their own  exclusion from affairs. No doubt he denounced Wolsey, who sent him a  message that he might say what he liked against himself, but warned him  to beware what he said against the king. It does not seem that Wolsey  took any active part in the proceedings against the Duke, but he did not  do anything to save him. The matter was the king's matter, and as such  it was regarded by all. The nobles, who probably agreed with  Buckingham's opinions, were unanimous in pronouncing his guilt; and the  Duke of Norfolk, with tears streaming down his cheeks, condemned him to  his doom. The mass of the people were indifferent to his fate, and were  willing that the king should be sole judge of the precautions necessary  for his safety, with which the internal peace and outward glory of  England was entirely identified. Charles and Francis stood aghast at  Henry's strong measures, and were surprised that he could do things in  such a high-handed manner with impunity. If Henry intended to let the  statesmen of Europe know that he was not to be diverted from his course  by fear of causing disorders at home he thoroughly succeeded. The death  of Buckingham was a warning that those who crossed the king's path and  hoped to thwart his plans by petulant opposition were playing a game  which would only end in their own ruin.    Free from any fear of opposition at home, Wolsey could now give his  attention to his difficult task abroad. Charles V. had been crowned at  Aachen, and talked of an expedition to Rome to receive the imperial  crown. Francis I. was preparing for a campaign to assert the French  claims on Milan. Meanwhile he wished to hamper Charles without openly  breaking the peace. He stirred up a band of discontented barons to  attack Luxembourg, and aided the claimant to the crown of Navarre to  enter his inheritance. War seemed now inevitable; but Wolsey remained  true to his principles, and urged upon both kings that they should  submit their differences to the mediation of England. Charles was busied  with the revolt of the Spanish towns, and was not unwilling to gain  time. After a show of reluctance he submitted to the English proposals;  but Francis, rejoicing in the prospect of success in Luxembourg and  Navarre, refused on the ground that Charles was not in earnest. Still  Francis was afraid of incurring England's hostility, and quailed before  Wolsey's threat that if France refused mediation, England would be  driven to side with the Emperor. In June 1521 he reluctantly assented to  a conference to be held at Calais, over which Wolsey should preside, and  decide between the pleas urged by representatives of the two hostile  monarchs.    If Wolsey triumphed at having reached his goal, his triumph was of short  duration. He might display himself as a mediator seeking to establish  peace, but he knew that peace was well-nigh impossible. While the  negotiations were in progress for the conference which was to resolve  differences, events were tending to make war inevitable. When Wolsey  began to broach his project, Francis was desirous of war and Charles was  anxious to defer it; but Charles met with some success in obtaining  promises of help from Germany in the Diet of Worms, and when that was  over, he heard welcome news which reached him gradually from all sides.  The revolt of the Spanish towns was dying away; the aggressors in  Luxembourg had been repulsed; the troops of Spain had won signal  successes in Navarre. His embarrassments were certainly disappearing on  all sides. More than this, Pope Leo X., after long wavering, made up his  mind to take a definite course. No doubt he was sorely vexed to find  that the position which he hankered after was occupied by England; and  if he were to step back into the politics of Europe, he could not defer  a decision much longer. He had wavered between an alliance with France  and Venice on the one side, or with the Emperor on the other. The  movement of Luther in Germany had been one of the questions for  settlement in the Diet of Worms, and Luther had"]]]
