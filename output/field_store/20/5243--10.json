Nobody  shall learn anything they don't want to. And sometimes instead of having  masters and mistresses we will have cats, and we will dress up in cat  skins and learn purring. 'Now, my dears,' the old cat will say, 'one,  two, three all purr together,' and we shall purr like anything.    She won't teach us to mew, but we shall know how without teaching.  Children do know some things without being taught.--ALICE.                 ------------             POETRY        (Translated into French by Dora)         Quand j'etais jeune et j'etais fou       J'achetai un violon pour dix-huit sous       Et tous les airs que je jouai       Etait over the hills and far away.

I often try to get a cat  to play with me, and she never seems to care about the game, no matter  how little it hurts.--H. O.    Making pots and pans with clay is fun, but do not tell the grown-ups. It  is better to surprise them; and then you must say at once how easily it  washes off--much easier than ink.--DICKY.                 ------------    SAM REDFERN, OR THE BUSH RANGER'S BURIAL                 By Dicky    'Well, Annie, I have bad news for you,' said Mr Ridgway, as he entered  the comfortable dining-room of his cabin in the Bush. 'Sam Redfern the  Bushranger is about this part of the Bush just now. I hope he will not  attack us with his gang.'    'I hope not,' responded Annie, a gentle maiden of some sixteen summers.    Just then came a knock at the door of the hut, and a gruff voice asked  them to open the door.    'It is Sam Redfern the Bushranger, father,' said the girl.    'The same,' responded the voice, and the next moment the hall door was  smashed in, and Sam Redfern sprang in, followed by his gang.                 ------------             CHAPTER II    Annie's Father was at once overpowered, and Annie herself lay bound with  cords on the drawing-room sofa. Sam Redfern set a guard round the lonely  hut, and all human aid was despaired of. But you never know. Far away in  the Bush a different scene was being enacted.    'Must be Injuns,' said a tall man to himself as he pushed his way  through the brushwood. It was Jim Carlton, the celebrated detective. 'I  know them,' he added; 'they are Apaches.' just then ten Indians in full  war-paint appeared. Carlton raised his rifle and fired, and slinging  their scalps on his arm he hastened towards the humble log hut where  resided his affianced bride, Annie Ridgway, sometimes known as the  Flower of the Bush.                 ------------             CHAPTER III    The moon was low on the horizon, and Sam Redfern was seated at a  drinking bout with some of his boon companions.    They had rifled the cellars of the hut, and the rich wines flowed like  water in the golden goblets of Mr Ridgway.    But Annie had made friends with one of the gang, a noble, good-hearted  man who had joined Sam Redfern by mistake, and she had told him to go  and get the police as quickly as possible.    'Ha! ha!' cried Redfern, 'now I am enjoying myself!' He little knew that  his doom was near upon him.    Just then Annie gave a piercing scream, and Sam Redfern got up, seizing  his revolver. 'Who are you?' he cried, as a man entered.    'I am Jim Carlton, the celebrated detective,' said the new arrival.    Sam Redfern's revolver dropped from his nerveless fingers, but the next  moment he had sprung upon the detective with the well-known activity of  the mountain sheep, and Annie shrieked, for she had grown to love the  rough Bushranger.    (To be continued at the end of the paper if there is room.)                 ------------             SCHOLASTIC    A new slate is horrid till it is washed in milk. I like the green spots  on them to draw patterns round. I know a good way to make a slate-pencil  squeak, but I won't put it in because I don't want to make it  common.--SUB-EDITOR.    Peppermint is a great help with arithmetic. The boy who was second in  the Oxford Local always did it. He gave me two. The examiner said to  him, 'Are you eating peppermints?' And he said, 'No, Sir.'    He told me afterwards it was quite true, because he was only sucking  one. I'm glad I wasn't asked. I should never have thought of that, and I  could have had to say 'Yes.'--OSWALD.                 ------------        THE WRECK OF THE 'MALABAR'                 By Noel    (Author of 'A Dream of Ancient Ancestors.') He isn't really--but he put  it in to make it seem more real.        Hark! what is that noise of rolling         Waves and thunder in the air?      'Tis the death-knell of the sailors         And officers and passengers of the good ship Malabar.        It was a fair and lovely noon         When the good ship put out of port      And people said 'ah little we think         How soon she will be the elements' sport.'        She was indeed a lovely sight         Upon the billows with sails spread.      But the captain folded his gloomy arms,         Ah--if she had been a life-boat instead!        See the captain stern yet gloomy         Flings his son upon a rock,      Hoping that there his darling boy         May escape the wreck.        Alas in vain the loud winds roared         And nobody was saved.      That was the wreck of the Malabar,         Then let us toll for the brave.                                      NOEL.                 ------------            GARDENING NOTES    It is useless to plant cherry-stones in the hope of eating the fruit,  because they don't!    Alice won't lend her gardening tools again, because the last time Noel  left them out in the rain, and I don't like it. He said he didn't.                 ------------            SEEDS AND BULBS    These are useful to play at shop with, until you are ready. Not at  dinner-parties, for they will not grow unless uncooked. Potatoes are  not grown with seed, but with chopped-up potatoes. Apple trees are grown  from twigs, which is less wasteful.    Oak trees come from acorns. Every one knows this. When Noel says he  could grow one from a peach stone wrapped up in oak leaves, he shows  that he knows nothing about gardening but marigolds, and when I passed  by his garden I thought they seemed just like weeds now the flowers have  been picked.    A boy once dared me to eat a bulb.    Dogs are very industrious and fond of gardening. Pincher is always  planting bones, but they never grow up. There couldn't be a bone tree.  I think this is what makes him bark so unhappily at night. He has never  tried planting dog-biscuit, but he is fonder of bones, and perhaps he  wants to be quite sure about them first.                 ------------     SAM REDFERN, OR THE BUSHRANGER'S BURIAL                    By Dicky                 ------------         CHAPTER IV AND LAST    This would have been a jolly good story if they had let me finish it at  the beginning of the paper as I wanted to. But now I have forgotten how  I meant it to end, and I have lost my book about Red Indians, and all my  Boys of England have been sneaked. The girls say 'Good riddance!' so I  expect they did it. They want me just to put in which Annie married, but  I shan't, so they will never know.    We have now put everything we can think of into the paper. It takes a  lot of thinking about. I don't know how grown-ups manage to write all  they do. It must make their heads ache, especially lesson books.    Albert-next-door only wrote one chapter of the serial story, but he  could have done some more if he had wanted to. He could not write out  any of the things because he cannot spell. He says he can, but it takes  him such a long time he might just as well not be able. There are one or  two things more. I am sick of it, but Dora says she will write them in.    LEGAL ANSWER WANTED. A quantity of excellent string is offered if you  know whether there really is a law passed about not buying gunpowder  under thirteen.--DICKY.    The price of this paper is one shilling each, and sixpence extra for the  picture of the Malabar going down with all hands. If we sell one hundred  copies we will write another paper.                      *   *   *    And so we would have done, but we never did. Albert-next-door's uncle  gave us two shillings, that was all. You can't restore fallen fortunes  with two shillings!        CHAPTER 9. THE G. B.    Being editors is not the best way to wealth. We all feel this now, and  highwaymen are not respected any more like they used to be.    I am sure we had tried our best to restore our fallen fortunes. We felt  their fall very much, because we knew the Bastables had been rich once.  Dora and Oswald can remember when Father was always bringing nice things  home from London, and there used to be turkeys and geese and wine and  cigars come by the carrier at Christmas-time, and boxes of candied fruit  and French plums in ornamental boxes with silk and velvet and gilding  on them. They were called prunes, but the prunes you buy at the grocer's  are quite different. But now there is seldom anything nice brought from  London, and the turkey and the prune people have forgotten Father's  address.    'How _can_ we restore those beastly fallen fortunes?' said Oswald.  'We've tried digging and writing and princesses and being editors.'    'And being bandits,' said H. O.    'When did you try that?' asked Dora quickly. 'You know I told you it was  wrong.'    'It wasn't wrong the way we did it,' said Alice, quicker still, before  Oswald could say, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/775"],[0,"When the Sleeper Wakes (#12)"],[1," ventilator twisted his head round so that his profile was  towards Graham. He appeared to be listening. Suddenly there was a hasty  exclamation, and the intruder sprang back just in time to escape the  sweep of the released fan. And when Graham peered up there was nothing  visible but the slowly falling snow.    It was perhaps a quarter of an hour before anything returned to the  ventilator. But at last came the same metallic interference again; the  fans stopped and the face reappeared. Graham had remained all this time  in the same place, alert and tremulously excited.    \"Who are you? What do you want?\" he said.    \"We want to speak to you, Sire,\" said the intruder.    \"We want--I can't hold the thing. We have been trying to find a way to  you these three days.\"    \"Is it rescue?\" whispered Graham. \"Escape?\"    \"Yes, Sire. If you will.\"    \"You are my party--the party of the Sleeper?\"    \"Yes, Sire.\"    \"What am I to do?\" said Graham.    There was a struggle. The stranger's arm appeared, and his hand was  bleeding. His knees came into view over the edge of the funnel. \"Stand  away from me,\" he said, and he dropped rather heavily on his hands and  one shoulder at Graham's feet. The released ventilator whirled noisily.  The stranger rolled over, sprang up nimbly and stood panting, hand to a  bruised shoulder, and with his bright eyes on Graham.    \"You are indeed the Sleeper,\" he said. \"I saw you asleep. When it was  the law that anyone might see you.\"    \"I am the man who was in the trance,\" said Graham. \"They have imprisoned  me here. I have been here since I awoke--at least three days.\"    The intruder seemed about to speak, heard something, glanced swiftly at  the door, and suddenly left Graham and ran towards it, shouting quick  incoherent words. A bright wedge of steel flashed in his hand, and he  began tap, tap, a quick succession of blows upon the hinges. \"Mind!\"  cried a voice. \"Oh!\" The voice came from above.    Graham glanced up, saw the soles of two feet, ducked, was struck on the  shoulder by one of them, and a heavy weight bore him to the earth. He  fell on his knees and forward, and the weight went over his head. He  knelt up and saw a second man from above seated before him.    \"I did not see you, Sire,\" panted the man. He rose and assisted Graham  to arise. \"Are you hurt, Sire?\" he panted. A succession of heavy blows  on the ventilator began, something fell close to Graham's face, and a  shivering edge of white metal danced, fell over, and lay flat upon the  floor.    \"What is this?\" cried Graham, confused and looking at the ventilator.  \"Who are you? What are you going to do? Remember, I understand nothing.\"    \"Stand back,\" said the stranger, and drew him from under the ventilator  as another fragment of metal fell heavily.    \"We want you to come, Sire,\" panted the newcomer, and Graham glancing  at his face again, saw a new cut had changed from white to red on his  forehead, and a couple of little trickles of blood starting therefrom.  \"Your people call for you.\"    \"Come where? My people?\"    \"To the hall about the markets. Your life is in danger here. We have  spies. We learned but just in time. The Council has decided--this very  day--either to drug or kill you. And everything is ready. The people are  drilled, the wind-vane police, the engineers, and half the way-gearers  are with us. We have the halls crowded--shouting. The whole city shouts  against the Council. We have arms.\" He wiped the blood with his hand.  \"Your life here is not worth--\" \"But why arms?\"    \"The people have risen to protect you, Sire. What?\"    He turned quickly as the man who had first come down made a hissing  with his teeth. Graham saw the latter start back, gesticulate to them to  conceal themselves, and move as if to hide behind the opening door.    As he did so Howard appeared, a little tray in one hand and his heavy  face downcast. He started, looked up, the door slammed behind him, the  tray tilted sideways, and the steel wedge struck him behind the ear. He  went down like a felled tree, and lay as he fell athwart the floor of  the outer room. The man who had struck him bent hastily, studied his  face for a moment, rose, and returned to his work at the door.    \"Your poison!\" said a voice in Graham's ear.    Then abruptly they were in darkness. The innumerable cornice lights  had been extinguished. Graham saw the aperture of the ventilator with  ghostly snow whirling above it and dark figures moving hastily. Three  knelt on the fan. Some dim thing--a ladder was being lowered through the  opening, and a hand appeared holding a fitful yellow light.    He had a moment of hesitation. But the manner of these men, their swift  alacrity, their words, marched so completely with his own fears of  the Council, with his idea and hope of a rescue, that it lasted not a  moment. And his people awaited him!    \"I do not understand,\" he said, \"I trust. Tell me what to do.\"    The man with the cut brow gripped Graham's arm.    \"Clamber up the ladder,\" he whispered. \"Quick. They will have heard--\"    Graham felt for the ladder with extended hands, put his foot on the  lower rung, and, turning his head, saw over the shoulder of the nearest  man, in the yellow flicker of the light, the first-comer astride over  Howard and still working at the door. Graham turned to the ladder again,  and was thrust by his conductor and helped up by those above, and then  he was standing on something hard and cold and slippery outside the  ventilating funnel.    He shivered. He was aware of a great difference in the temperature. Half  a dozen men stood about him, and light flakes of snow touched hands and  face and melted. For a moment it was dark, then for a flash a ghastly  violet white, and then everything was dark again.    He saw he had come out upon the roof of the vast city structure which  had replaced the miscellaneous houses, streets and open spaces of  Victorian London. The place upon which he stood was level, with huge  serpentine cables lying athwart it in every direction. The circular  wheels of a number of windmills loomed indistinct and gigantic through  the darkness and snowfall, and roared with a varying loudness as the  fitful white light smote up from below, touched the snow eddies with a  transient glitter, and made an evanescent spectre in the night; and  here and there, low down! some vaguely outlined wind-driven mechanism  flickered with livid sparks.    All this he appreciated in a fragmentary manner as his rescuers stood  about him. Someone threw a thick soft cloak of fur-like texture about  him, and fastened it by buckled straps at waist and shoulders. Things  were said briefly, decisively. Someone thrust him forward.    Before his mind was yet clear a dark shape gripped his arm. \"This way,\"  said this shape, urging him along, and pointed Graham across the flat  roof in the direction of a dim semicircular haze of light. Graham  obeyed.    \"Mind!\" said a voice, as Graham stumbled against a cable. \"Between them  and not across them,\" said the voice. And, \"We must hurry.\"    \"Where are the people?\" said Graham. \"The people you said awaited me?\"    The stranger did not answer. He left Graham's arm as the path grew  narrower, and led the way with rapid strides. Graham followed blindly.  In a minute he found himself running. \"Are the others coming?\" he  panted, but received no reply. His companion glanced back and ran on.  They came to a sort of pathway of open metal-work, transverse to the  direction they had come, and they turned aside to follow this. Graham  looked back, but the snowstorm had hidden the others.    \"Come on!\" said his guide. Running now, they drew near a little windmill  spinning high in the air. \"Stoop,\" said Graham's guide, and they avoided  an endless band running roaring up to the shaft of the vane. \"This  way!\" and they were ankle deep in a gutter full of drifted thawing snow,  between two low walls of metal that presently rose waist high. \"I will  go first,\" said the guide. Graham drew his cloak about him and followed.  Then suddenly came a narrow abyss across which the gutter leapt to the  snowy darkness of the further side. Graham peeped over the side once and  the gulf was black. For a moment he regretted his flight. He dared not  look again, and his brain spun as he waded through the half liquid snow.    Then out of the gutter they clambered and hurried across a wide flat  space damp with thawing snow, and for half its extent dimly translucent  to lights that went to and fro underneath. He hesitated at this unstable  looking substance, but his guide ran on unheeding, and so they came to  and clambered up slippery steps to the rim of a great dome of glass.  Round this they went. Far below a number of people seemed to be dancing,  and music filtered through the dome.... Graham fancied he heard a  shouting through the snowstorm, and his guide hurried him on with a new  spurt of haste. They clambered panting to a space of huge windmills, one  so vast that only the lower edge of its vans came rushing into sight and  rushed up again and was lost in the night and the snow. They hurried for  a time through the colossal metallic tracery of its supports, and came  at last above a place of moving platforms like the place into which  Graham had looked from the balcony. They crawled across the sloping  transparency that covered this street of platforms, crawling on hands  and knees because of the slipperiness of the snowfall.    For the most part the glass was bedewed, and Graham saw only hazy  suggestions of the forms below, but near the pitch of the transparent  roof the glass was clear, and he found himself looking sheerly down upon  it all. For awhile, in spite of the urgency of his guide, he gave way  to vertigo and lay spread-eagled on the glass, sick and paralysed. Far  below, mere stirring specks and dots, went the people of the unsleeping  city in their perpetual daylight, and the moving"]]]
