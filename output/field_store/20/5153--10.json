It was not long ago,\" he added reflectively, \"when you and I met  in the Planters' House, and you declared that every drop of Northern  blood spilled in Kansas was in a holy cause. Do you remember it, sir?\"    Mr. Cluyme and Mr. Cluyme's wife alone knew whether he trembled.    \"And I repeat that, sir,\" he cried, with far too much zeal. \"I repeat  it here and now. And yet I was for the Omnibus Bill, and I am with Mr.  Douglas in his local sovereignty. I am willing to bury my abhorrence of  a relic of barbarism, for the sake of union and peace.\"    \"Well, sir, I am not,\" retorted the Judge, like lightning. He rubbed the  red spat on his nose, and pointed a bony finger at Mr. Cluyme. Many a  criminal had grovelled before that finger. \"I, too, am for the Union.  And the Union will never be safe until the greatest crime of modern  times is wiped out in blood. Mind what I say, Mr. Cluyme, in blood,  sir,\" he thundered.    Poor Mrs. Cluyme gasped.    \"But the slave, sir? Did I not understand you to approve of Mr. Brice's  ownership?\"    \"As I never approved of any other. Good night, sir. Good night, madam.\"  But to Mrs. Brice he crossed over and took her hand. It has been further  claimed that he bowed. This is not certain.    \"Good night, madam,\" he said. \"I shall call again to pay my respects  when you are not occupied.\"          Volume 2.          CHAPTER VIII. BELLEGARDE    Miss Virginia Carvel came down the steps in her riding-habit. And Ned,  who had been waiting in the street with the horses, obsequiously held  his hand while his young mistress leaped into Vixen's saddle. Leaving  the darkey to follow upon black Calhoun, she cantered off up the street,  greatly to the admiration of the neighbor. They threw open their windows  to wave at her, but Virginia pressed her lips and stared straight ahead.  She was going out to see the Russell girls at their father's country  place on Bellefontaine Road, especially to proclaim her detestation  for a certain young Yankee upstart. She had unbosomed herself to Anne  Brinsmade and timid Eugenie Renault the day before.    It was Indian summer, the gold and purple season of the year. Frost  had come and gone. Wasps were buzzing confusedly about the eaves again,  marvelling at the balmy air, and the two Misses Russell, Puss and  Emily, were seated within the wide doorway at needlework when Virginia  dismounted at the horseblock.    \"Oh, Jinny, I'm so glad to see you,\" said Miss Russell. \"Here's Elise  Saint Simon from New Orleans. You must stay all day and to-night.\"    \"I can't, Puss,\" said Virginia, submitting impatiently to Miss Russell's  warm embrace. She was disappointed at finding the stranger. \"I only  came--to say that I am going to have a birthday party in a few weeks.  You must be sure to come, and bring your guest.\"    Virginia took her bridle from Ned, and Miss Russell's hospitable face  fell.    \"You're not going?\" she said.    \"To Bellegarde for dinner,\" answered Virginia.    \"But it's only ten o'clock,\" said Puss. \"And, Jinny?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"There's a new young man in town, and they do say his appearance is very  striking--not exactly handsome, you know, but strong-looking.\"    \"He's horrid!\" said Virginia. \"He's a Yankee.\"    \"How do you know?\" demanded Puss and Emily in chorus.    \"And he's no gentleman,\" said Virginia.    \"But how do you know, Jinny?\"    \"He's an upstart.\"    \"Oh. But he belongs to a very good Boston family, they say.\"    \"There are no good Boston families,\" replied Virginia, with conviction,  as she separated her reins. \"He has proved that. Who ever heard of a  good Yankee family?\"    \"What has he done to you, Virginia?\" asked Puss, who had brains.    Virginia glanced at the guest. But her grievance was too hot within her  for suppression.    \"Do you remember Mr. Benbow's Hester, girls? The one I always said I  wanted. She was sold at auction yesterday. Pa and I were passing the  Court House, with Clarence, when she was put up for sale. We crossed  the street to see what was going on, and there was your strong-looking  Yankee standing at the edge of the crowd. I am quite sure that he saw me  as plainly as I see you, Puss Russell.\"    \"How could he help it?\" said Puss, slyly.    Virginia took no notice of the remark.    \"He heard me ask Pa to buy her. He heard Clarence say that he would bid  her in for me. I know he did. And yet he goes in and outbids Clarence,  and buys her himself. Do you think any gentleman would do that, Puss  Russell?\"    \"He bought her himself!\" cried the astonished Miss Russell. \"Why I  thought that all Bostonians were Abolitionists.\"    \"Then he set her free,\" said Miss Carvel, contemptuously, \"Judge Whipple  went on her bond to-day.\"    \"Oh, I'm just crazy to see him now,\" said Miss Russell.    \"Ask him to your party, Virginia,\" she added mischievously.    \"Do you think I would have him in my house?\" cried Virginia.    Miss Russell was likewise courageous--\"I don't see why not. You have  Judge Whipple every Sunday dinner, and he's an Abolitionist.\"    Virginia drew herself up.    \"Judge Whipple has never insulted me,\" she said, with dignity.    Puss gave way to laughter. Whereupon, despite her protests and prayers  for forgiveness, Virginia took to her mare again and galloped off. They  saw her turn northward on the Bellefontaine Road.    Presently the woodland hid from her sight the noble river shining far  below, and Virginia pulled Vixen between the gateposts which marked the  entrance to her aunt's place, Bellegarde. Half a mile through the cool  forest, the black dirt of the driveway flying from Vixen's hoofs, and  there was the Colfax house on the edge of the gentle slope; and beyond  it the orchard, and the blue grapes withering on the vines,--and  beyond that fields and fields of yellow stubble. The silver smoke of  a steamboat hung in wisps above the water. A young negro was busily  washing the broad veranda, but he stopped and straightened at sight of  the young horsewoman.    \"Sambo, where's your mistress?\"    \"Clar t' goodness, Miss Jinny, she was heah leetle while ago.\"    \"Yo' git atter Miss Lilly, yo' good-fo'-nuthin' niggah,\" said Ned,  warmly. \"Ain't yo' be'n raised better'n to stan' theh wif yo'mouf open?\"    Sambo was taking the hint, when Miss Virginia called him back.    \"Where's Mr. Clarence?    \"Young Masr? I'll fotch him, Miss Jinny. He jes come home f'um seein'  that thar trottin' hose he's gwine to race nex' week.\"    Ned, who had tied Calhoun and was holding his mistress's bridle,  sniffed. He had been Colonel Carvel's jockey in his younger days.    \"Shucks!\" he said contemptuously. \"I hoped to die befo' the day a  gemman'd own er trottah, Jinny. On'y runnin' hosses is fit fo' gemmen.\"    \"Ned,\" said Virginia, \"I shall be eighteen in two weeks and a young  lady. On that day you must call me Miss Jinny.\"    Ned's face showed both astonishment and inquiry.    \"Jinny, ain't I nussed you always? Ain't I come upstairs to quiet you  when yo' mammy ain't had no power ovah yo'? Ain't I cooked fo' yo', and  ain't I followed you everywheres since I quit ridin' yo' pa's bosses to  vict'ry? Ain't I one of de fambly? An' yit yo' ax me to call yo' Miss  Jinny?\"    \"Then you've had privileges enough,\" Virginia answered. \"One week from  to-morrow you are to say 'Miss Jinny.'\"    \"I'se tell you what, Jinny,\" he answered mischievously, with an emphasis  on the word, \"I'se call you Miss Jinny ef you'll call me Mistah Johnson.  Mistah Johnson. You aint gwinter forget? Mistah Johnson.\"    \"I'll remember,\" she said. \"Ned,\" she demanded suddenly, \"would you like  to be free?\"    The negro started.    \"Why you ax me dat, Jinny?\"    \"Mr. Benbow's Hester is free,\" she said.    \"Who done freed her?\"    Miss Virginia flushed. \"A detestable young Yankee, who has come out here  to meddle with what doesn't concern him. I wanted Hester, Ned. And you  should have married her, if you behaved yourself.\"    Ned laughed uneasily.    \"I reckon I'se too ol' fo' Heste'.\" And added with privileged impudence,  \"There ain't no cause why I can't marry her now.\"    Virginia suddenly leaped to the ground without his assistance.    \"That's enough, Ned,\" she said, and started toward the house.    \"Jinny! Miss Jinny!\" The call was plaintive.    \"Well, what?\"    \"Miss Jinny, I seed that than young gemman. Lan' sakes, he ain' look  like er Yankee.\"    \"Ned,\" said Virginia, sternly, \"do you want to go back to cooking?\"    He quailed. \"Oh, no'm--Lan' sakes, no'm. I didn't mean nuthin'.\"    She turned, frowned, and bit her lip. Around the corner of the veranda  she ran into her cousin. He, too, was booted and spurred. He reached  out, boyishly, to catch her in his arms. But she drew back from his  grasp.    \"Why, Jinny,\" he cried, \"what's the matter?\"    \"Nothing, Max.\" She often called him so, his middle name being Maxwell.  \"But you have no right to do that.\"    \"To do what?\" said Clarence, making a face.    \"You know,\" answered Virginia, curtly. \"Where's Aunt Lillian?\"    \"Why haven't I the right?\" he asked, ignoring the inquiry.    \"Because you have not, unless I choose. And I don't choose.\"    \"Are you angry with me still? It wasn't my fault. Uncle Comyn made me  come away. You should have had the girl, Jinny, if it took my fortune.\"    \"You have been drinking this morning, Max,\" said Virginia.    \"Only a julep or so,\" he replied apologetically. \"I rode over to the  race track to see the new trotter. I've called him Halcyon, Jinny,\" he  continued, with enthusiasm. \"And he'll win the handicap sure.\"    She sat down on the veranda steps, with her knees crossed and her chin  resting on her hands. The air was heavy with the perfume of the grapes  and the smell of late flowers from the sunken garden near by. A blue  haze hung over the Illinois shore.    \"Max, you promised me you wouldn't drink so much.\"    \"And I haven't been, Jinny, 'pon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54"],[0,"The Marvelous Land of Oz (#12)"],[1,"Journey  to the emerald City, the Tin Woodman bearing upon his shoulder a gleaming  axe and leading the way, while the Pumpkinhead rode upon the Saw-Horse and  Tip and the Scarecrow walked upon either side to make sure that he didn't  fall off or become damaged.                     Line-Art Drawing        134               Full page line-art drawing.        135               Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.      Now, General Jinjur--who, you will remember, commanded the Army of Revolt--was  rendered very uneasy by the escape of the Scarecrow from the Emerald  City. She feared, and with good reason, that if his Majesty and the Tin  Woodman Joined forces, it would mean danger to her and her entire army; for  the people of Oz had not yet forgotten the deeds of these famous heroes, who  had passed successfully through so many startling adventures.    So Jinjur sent post-haste for old Mombi, the witch, and promised her large  rewards if she would come to the assistance of the rebel army.    Mombi was furious at the trick Tip had played upon her as well as at his  escape and the theft of the precious Powder of Life; so she needed no urging        136  to induce her to travel to the Emerald City to assist Jinjur in defeating  the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, who had made Tip one of their friends.    Mombi had no sooner arrived at the royal palace than she discovered, by  means of her secret magic, that the adventurers were starting upon their  Journey to the Emerald City; so she retired to a small room high up in a  tower and locked herself in while she practised such arts as she could  command to prevent the return of the Scarecrow and his companions.    That was why the Tin Woodman presently stopped and said:    \"Something very curious has happened. I ought to know by heart and every  step of this Journey, yet I fear we have already lost our way.\"    \"That is quite impossible!\" protested the Scarecrow. \"Why do you think, my  dear friend, that we have gone astray?\"    \"Why, here before us is a great field of sunflowers--and I never saw this  field before in all my life.\"    At these words they all looked around, only to find that they were indeed  surrounded by a field of tall stalks, every stalk bearing at its top a  gigantic sunflower. And not only were these flowers almost        137  blinding in their vivid hues of red and gold, but each one whirled around  upon its stalk like a miniature wind-mill, completely dazzling the vision of  the beholders and so mystifying them that they knew not which way to turn.    \"It's witchcraft!\" exclaimed Tip.    While they paused, hesitating and wondering, the Tin Woodman uttered a cry  of impatience and advanced with swinging axe to cut down the stalks before  him. But now the sunflowers suddenly stopped their rapid whirling, and the  travelers plainly saw a girl's face appear in the center of each flower.  These lovely faces looked upon the astonished band with mocking smiles, and  then burst into a chorus of merry laughter at the dismay their appearance  caused.    \"Stop! stop!\" cried Tip, seizing the Woodman's arm; \"they're alive! they're  girls!\"    At that moment the flowers began whirling again, and the faces faded away  and were lost in the rapid revolutions.    The Tin Woodman dropped his axe and sat down upon the ground.    \"It would be heartless to chop down those pretty creatures,\" said he,  despondently. \"and yet I do not know how else we can proceed upon our way\"    \"They looked to me strangely like the faces of        138  the Army of Revolt,\" mused the Scarecrow. \"But I cannot conceive how the  girls could have followed us here so quickly.\"    \"I believe it's magic,\" said Tip, positively, \"and that someone is playing a  trick upon us. I've known old Mombi do things like that before. Probably  it's nothing more than an illusion, and there are no sunflowers here at  all.\"    \"Then let us shut our eyes and walk forward,\" suggested the Woodman.    \"Excuse me,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"My eyes are not painted to shut.  Because you happen to have tin eyelids, you must not imagine we are all  built in the same way.\"    \"And the eyes of the Saw-Horse are knot eyes,\" said Jack, leaning forward to  examine them.    \"Nevertheless, you must ride quickly forward,\" commanded Tip, \"and we will  follow after you and so try to escape. My eyes are already so dazzled that I  can scarcely see.\"    So the Pumpkinhead rode boldly forward, and Tip grasped the stub tail of the  Saw-Horse and followed with closed eyes. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman  brought up the rear, and before they had gone many yards a Joyful shout from  Jack announced that the way was clear before them.        139    Then all paused to look backward, but not a trace of the field of sunflowers  remained.    More cheerfully, now they proceeded upon their Journey; but old Mombi had so  changed the appearance of the landscape that they would surely have been  lost had not the Scarecrow wisely concluded to take their direction from the  sun. For no witch-craft could change the course of the sun, and it was  therefore a safe guide.    However, other difficulties lay before them. The Saw-Horse stepped into a  rabbit hole and fell to the ground. The Pumpkinhead was pitched high into  the air, and his history would probably have ended at that exact moment had  not the Tin Woodman skillfully caught the pumpkin as it descended and saved  it from injury.    Tip soon had it fitted to the neck again and replaced Jack upon his feet.  But the Saw-Horse did not escape so easily. For when his leg was pulled from  the rabbit hole it was found to be broken short off, and must be replaced or  repaired before he could go a step farther.    \"This is quite serious,\" said the Tin Woodman.\" If there were trees near by  I might soon manufacture another leg for this animal; but I cannot see even  a shrub for miles around.\"        140               Full page line-art drawing.                   THE TIN WOODMAN SKILLFULLY CAUGHT THE PUMPKIN        141    \"And there are neither fences nor houses in this part of the land of Oz,\"  added the Scarecrow, disconsolately.    \"Then what shall we do?\" enquired the boy.    \"I suppose I must start my brains working,\" replied his Majesty the  Scarecrow; \"for experience has, taught me that I can do anything if I but  take time to think it out.\"    \"Let us all think,\" said Tip; \"and perhaps we shall find a way to repair the  Saw-Horse.\"    So they sat in a row upon the grass and began to think, while the Saw-Horse  occupied itself by gazing curiously upon its broken limb.    \"Does it hurt?\" asked the Tin Woodman, in a soft, sympathetic voice.    \"Not in the least,\" returned the Saw-Horse; \"but my pride is injured to find  that my anatomy is so brittle.\"    For a time the little group remained in silent thought. Presently the Tin  Woodman raised his head and looked over the fields.    \"What sort of creature is that which approaches us?\" he asked, wonderingly.    The others followed his gaze, and discovered coming toward them the most  extraordinary object they had ever beheld. It advanced quickly and        142  noiselessly over the soft grass and in a few minutes stood before the  adventurers and regarded them with an astonishment equal to their own.    The Scarecrow was calm under all circumstances.    \"Good morning!\" he said, politely.    The stranger removed his hat with a flourish, bowed very low, and then  responded:                     Line-Art Drawing        \"Good morning, one and all. I hope you are, as an aggregation, enjoying  excellent health. Permit me to present my card.\"    With this courteous speech it extended a card toward the Scarecrow, who  accepted it, turned it over and over, and handed it with a shake of his head  to Tip.    The boy read aloud:      \"MR. H. M. WOGGLE-BUG, T. E.\"        143    \"Dear me!\" ejaculated the Pumpkinhead, staring somewhat intently.    \"How very peculiar!\" said the Tin Woodman.    Tip's eyes were round and wondering, and the Saw-Horse uttered a sigh and  turned away its head.    \"Are you really a Woggle-Bug?\" enquired the Scarecrow.    \"Most certainly, my dear sir!\" answered the stranger, briskly. \"Is not my  name upon the card?\"    \"It is,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But may I ask what 'H. M.' stands for?\"    \"'H. M.' means Highly Magnified,\" returned the Woggle-Bug, proudly.    \"Oh, I see.\" The Scarecrow viewed the stranger critically. \"And are you, in  truth, highly magnified?\"    \"Sir,\" said the Woggle-Bug, \"I take you for a gentleman of judgment and  discernment. Does it not occur to you that I am several thousand times  greater than any Woggle-Bug you ever saw before? Therefore it is plainly  evident that I am Highly Magnified, and there is no good reason why you  should doubt the fact.\"    \"Pardon me,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"My brains are slightly mixed since I  was last laundered. Would it be improper for me to ask, also, what the  'T.E.' at the end of your name stands for?\"        144    \"Those letters express my degree,\" answered the Woggle-Bug, with a  condescending smile. \"To be more explicit, the initials mean that I am  Thoroughly Educated.\"    \"Oh!\" said the Scarecrow, much relieved.    Tip had not yet taken his eyes off this wonderful personage. What he saw was  a great, round, buglike body supported upon two slender legs which ended in  delicate feet--the toes curling upward. The body of the Woggle-Bug was  rather flat, and judging from what could be seen of it was of a glistening  dark brown color upon the back, while the front was striped with alternate  bands of light brown and white, blending together at the edges. Its arms  were fully as slender as its legs, and upon a rather long neck was perched  its head--not unlike the head of a man, except that its nose ended in a  curling antenna, or \"feeler,\" and its ears from the upper points bore  antennae that decorated the sides of its head like two miniature, curling  pig tails.
