Bird waved them back.    \"There's nothing after us, men,\" he panted. \"We got chased a little way,  but I tossed our pursuer a handful of phosphorus and it must have burned  his fingers a little, judging from the racket he made. At any rate, it  stopped the pursuit.\"    The major hurried up.    \"Did you see it, Doctor?\" he asked.    \"No, I didn't. No one has ever seen it or anything like it. I heard it  and, from its voice, I think it has a bad cold. At least, it sounded  hoarse, so I gave it a little white phosphorus to make a poultice for  its throat, but I didn't get a glimpse of it.\"    \"For God's sake, Doctor, what is it?\"    \"I can't tell you yet, Major. So far I can tell, it is something new to  science and I am not sure just what it looks like. However, I hope to be  able to show it to you shortly. Is there a telegraph office here?\"    \"No, but we have a Signal Corps detachment with us, and they have a  portable radio set which will put us in touch with the army net.\"    \"Good! Can you place a tent at my disposal?\"    \"Certainly, Doctor.\"    \"All right, I'll go there, and I would appreciate it if you would send  the radio operator to me. I want to send a message to the Bureau of  Standards to forward me some apparatus which I need.\"    \"I'll attend to it, Doctor. Have you any special advice to give me about  the guarding?\"    \"Yes. Have you, or can you get, any live stock?\"    \"Live stock?\"    \"Yes. Cattle preferred, although hogs or sheep will do at a pinch. Sheep  will do quite well.\"    \"I'll see what I can do, Doctor.\"    \"Get them by all means, if it is possible to do so. Don't worry about  paying for them: secret service funds are not subject to the same audit  that army funds get. If you can locate them, drive a couple of cattle or  half a dozen sheep well into the cave and tether them there. If you  don't get them, have your sentries posted well away from the cave mouth,  and if any disturbance occurs during the night, tell them to break and  run. I hope it won't come out, but I can't tell.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A herd of cattle was soon located and two of the beasts driven into the  cave. Two hours later a series of horrible screams and bellowings were  heard in the cave. Following their orders the sentries abandoned their  posts and scattered, but the noise came no nearer the mouth, and in a  few minutes silence again reigned.    \"I hope that will be all that will be needed for a couple of days,\" said  the doctor to the commanding officer, \"but you had better have a couple  more cattle driven in in the morning. We want to keep the brute well  fed. Is there a tank stationed at Fort Thomas?\"    \"No, there isn't.\"    \"Then radio Washington that I want the fastest three-man tank that the  army has sent here at once. Don't bother with military channels, radio  direct to the Adjutant General, quoting the Secretary of the Treasury as  authority. Tell him that it's a rush matter, and sign the message 'Bird'  if you are afraid of getting your tail twisted.\"    Twice more before the apparatus which the doctor had ordered from  Washington arrived cattle were driven into the depths of the cave, and  twice were the screams and bellowings from the cave repeated. Each time  searching parties found the cattle gone in the morning. A week after the  doctor's arrival, a special train came up, carrying four mechanics from  the Bureau of Standards, together with a dozen huge packing cases. Under  the direction of the doctor the cases were unpacked and the apparatus  put together. Before the assembly had been completed the tank which had  been requested arrived from Camp Meade, and the Bureau mechanics began  to install some of the assembled units in it.    The first apparatus which was installed in the tank consisted of an  electric generator of peculiar design which was geared to the tank  motor. The electromotive force thus generated was led across a spark gap  with points of a metallic substance. The light produced was concentrated  by a series of parabolic reflectors, directed against a large quartz  prism, and thence through a lens which was designed to throw a slightly  divergent beam.    \"This apparatus,\" Dr. Bird explained to the Signal Corps officer, who  was an interested observer, \"is one which was designed at the Bureau for  the large scale production of ultra-violet light. There is nothing  special about the generator except that it is highly efficient and gives  an almost constant electromotive force. The current thus produced is  led across these points, which are composed of magnalloy, a development  of the Bureau. We found on investigation that a spark gave out a light  which was peculiarly rich in ultra-violet rays when it was passed  between magnesium points. However, such points could not be used for the  handling of a steady current because of lack of durability and ease of  fusion, so a mixture of graphite, alundum and metallic magnesium was  pressed together with a binder which will stand the heat. Thus we get  the triple advantages of ultra-violet light production, durability, and  high resistance.           *       *       *       *       *    \"The system of reflectors catches all of the light thus produced except  the relatively small portion which goes initially in the right  direction, and directs it on this quartz prism where, due to the  refractive powers of the prism, the light is broken up into its  component parts. The infra-red rays and that portion of the spectrum  which lies in the visible range, that is, from red to violet inclusive,  are absorbed by a black body, leaving only the ultra-violet portion free  to send a beam through this quartz lens.\"    \"I thought that a lens would absorb ultra-violet light,\" objected the  signal officer.    \"A lens made of glass will, but this lens is made of rock crystal, which  is readily permeable to ultra-violet. The net result of this apparatus  is that we can direct before us as we move in the tank a beam of light  which is composed solely of the ultra-violet portion of the spectrum.\"    \"In other words, an invisible light?\"    \"Yes. That is, invisible to the human eye. The effect of this beam of  ultra-violet light in the form of severe sunburn would be readily  apparent if you exposed your skin to it for any length of time, and the  effects on your eyesight of continued gazing would be apt to be  disastrous. It would produce a severe opthalmia and temporary  impairment of the vision, somewhat the same symptoms as are observed in  snow blindness.\"    \"I see. May I ask what is the object of the whole thing?\"    \"Surely. Before we can successfully combat this peculiar visitant from  another world, it is necessary that we gain some idea of the size and  appearance of it. Nothing of the sort has before made its appearance, so  far as the annals of science go, and so I am forced to make some rather  wild guesses at the nature of the animal. You are probably aware of the  fact that the property of penetration possessed by all waves is a  function of their frequency, or, perhaps I should say, of their  wave-length?\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Certainly.\"    \"The longer rays of visible light will not penetrate as deeply into a  given substance as the shorter ultra-violet rays. This visitor is  evidently from some unexplored and, indeed, unknown cavern in the depths  of the earth where visible light has never penetrated. Apparently in  this cavern the color of the inhabitants is ultra-violet, and hence  invisible to us.\"    \"You are beyond my depth, Doctor.\"    \"Pardon me. You understand, of course, what color is? When sunlight,  which is a mixture of all colors from infra-red to ultra-violet  inclusive, falls on an object, certain rays are reflected and certain  others are absorbed. If the red rays are reflected and all others  absorbed, the object appears red to our eyes. If all the rays are  reflected, the object appears white, and if all are absorbed, it appears  black.\"    \"I understand that.\"    \"The human eye cannot detect ultra-violet. Suppose then, that we have an  object, either animate or inanimate, the surface of which reflects only  ultra-violet light, what will be the result? The object will be  invisible.\"    \"I should think it would be black if all the rays except the  ultra-violet were absorbed.\"    \"It would, but mark, I did not say the others were absorbed. Are you  familiar with fluorescein?\"    \"No.\"    \"I think you are. It is the dye used in making changeable silk. If we  fill a glass container with a fluorescein solution and look at it by  reflected light it appears green. If we look at it by transmitted light,  that is, light which has traversed the solution, it appears red. In  other words, this is a substance which reflects green light, allows a  free passage to red light, and absorbs all other light. This creature we  are after, if my theory is correct, is composed of a substance which  allows free passage to all of the visible light rays and at the same  time reflects ultra-violet light. Do I make this clear?\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Perfectly.\"    \"Very well, then. My apparatus will project forward a beam of  ultra-violet light which will be in much greater concentration than  exists in an incandescent electric light. It is my hope that this light  will be reflected by the body of the creature to a sufficient to allow  me to make a photograph of it.\"    \"But won't your lens prevent the ultra-violet light from reaching your  plate?\"    \"An ordinary lens made of optical glass would do so, but I have a camera  here equipped with a rock crystal lens, which will allow ultra-violet  light to pass through it practically unhindered, and with very slight  distortion. When I add that I will have my camera charged with X-ray  film, a film which is peculiarly sensitive to the shorter wave-lengths,  you will see that I will have a fair chance of success.\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41533"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 6 (of 6) (#12)"],[1,"zio, brother of Flaminio, flourished from 1540 up to 1560.  _Avvocato Passeri._ _ib._    ---- Salvatore, a Venetian, painted at Rome in the chapel of Sixtus V.  _Guida di Roma._ ii. 159.
