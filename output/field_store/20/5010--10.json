I, therefore, conceive, that  their manufactures are competing with the manufactures of this  country, and, consequently, they would not come to us to receive a  supply of those articles which they can purchase from their own  manufacturers at home.\" In 1825, at the earnest and obviously  well-founded representations of the manufacturers, Mr Huskisson  reverted to the old system: and it was then wisely enacted, that all  foreign wool imported for home consumption, of the value of 1s.  a-pound and upwards, should pay a duty of 1d. a-pound, but when the  value of foreign wool was under 1s., the duty was reduced to a  halfpenny per pound. A boon was at the same time conferred upon the  agriculturists, by the introduction of a new system with respect to  the exportation of British wool, the growers of which were allowed,  for the first time, to send it to foreign markets, on payment of a  penny per pound.    (59.) _Removal of the Restrictions on Foreign Wool._--The importation  of wool was, by these reductions, speedily increased, and with it the  consumption of our woollens by foreign nations. The wool of our own  gradually augmented flocks being inadequate to the demand, and that of  Spain having been absorbed by our manufactories, large quantities were  imported from Prussia, Saxony, and many parts of the continent of  Europe, from which, antecedent to this run, little had been drawn. The  average annual import of wool during 1765-66-67 was 4,241,364  pounds--the average annual export of woollens during the same period  was L4,630,384; while the average annual import of wool for the years  1822-23-24 was 18,884,876 pounds, and the average annual export of  woollens during the same time, amounted to L6,200,548, showing that  the importation of foreign wool was absolutely necessary for the  well-being of our manufactures. The importation of forty-four millions  of pounds weight, in the year ending 5th January, 1826, must be  ascribed as much to the spirit of over-trading, which then affected  every branch of industry, as to the reduction of the duty; but the  large importations during 1827, afforded an additional proof of the  necessity of foreign wool to the successful formation of a most  important article of commerce. Mr Gott of Leeds, in his evidence  before the Lords' Committee, on being asked if he could carry on to  the same extent as at present, if he manufactured his cloth of British  wool, replied, that, in certain descriptions of cloth, \"_he could not  make an article that would be merchantable at all for the foreign  market, or even for the home market, except of foreign wool_.\" He  then proceeds to state, that though the competition is very strong  in every department of the manufacture, yet that foreigners are  decidedly superior to us in some description of low cloths. The  following question was then put, and plainly and emphatically  answered:--\"Speaking of the finer cloths, is the competition such as  to render an additional duty on the importation of foreign wool likely  to injure the export trade? _I have no doubt, speaking on my oath,  that it would be fatal to the foreign cloth trade of the country. I  would further say, that it would be equally injurious to coarse  manufactures of all kinds made of English wool._ The competition now  with foreigners is as nearly balanced as possible, and the disturbing  operation of attacks of that description would necessarily enable the  foreigner to buy his wool cheaper than we should do it in this  country; the result would be, that foreigners would, by such a  premium, be enabled to extend their manufactures to the exclusion of  British manufactures of all descriptions.\" In another part of his  evidence Mr Gott says, \"If two pieces of cloth at 10s. a-yard were put  before a customer, one made of British wool, the other of foreign  wool; one would be sold, and the other would remain on hand; I could  not execute an order with it. If any person sent to me for cloth at  7s. or 8s. a-yard, and if it were made of English wool it would be  sent back to me, and I must resort to foreign wool, or foreign mixed  with British, to execute that order.\" In fine, the British wool could  not be got rid of without a copious importation of foreign wool to aid  the manufacturer in his disposal of it, as fine cloths are so much  better and more durable in their wear than coarse cloths, that they  are coming more and more into demand, to the almost total exclusion of  the latter. Moreover, the good old custom of making home-spun cloth is  reviving among our farmers, and as it is excellently suited for  work-day wear, though necessarily of an inferior gloss, coarse cloths  will, to a considerable extent, cease to be the concern of our  manufacturers. The only cloth, indeed, which the bulk of the people  will require, will be a finer material to form the garb for Sunday and  holiday recreation.    (60.) _Countries from which we derive our Wool._--Our markets are  supplied with foreign wool principally from the following  places:--Australia, Van Dieman's Land, Cape of Good Hope, Peru,  Germany, Spain, and Russia. The Tasmanian fleeces are preferred to the  Australian, and fetch, in general, higher prices, owing to their being  fit for combing, while the latter, though making considerable advances  in fineness, are still of short staple. Both are favourites with our  manufacturers, from their being firm in the pile, a quality resulting  from the constant good health of the animal in those countries. The  German wool takes precedence of the Spanish, and has done so since  1819 or 1820. The King of Spain, about the year 1800, presented the  Elector of Saxony with a small merino flock, and, from that period,  our importations from Spain have diminished, as those from Germany  have increased. From the period of its first introduction into  Germany, till 1814, when peace once more fell to the lot of Europe,  these sheep were gradually spread over the kingdom of Saxony, and  when, by the events of 1815, the continental trade was thrown  completely open, the Saxon dealers, perceiving the value of this new  commercial article, commenced a regular trade in it with England. By  this new supply, the Spanish wool, as here shown, was slowly beaten  from its hold on the British manufacturers.      _Importations into England of Wool from Spain and Germany, at three    separate periods._                       1800.           1814.              1827.      Germany,      421,850 lbs.    3,595,146 lbs.    22,007,198 lbs.      Spain and    Portugal,    7,794,758 lbs.    9,234,991 lbs.    4,349,643 lbs.    At these periods the ports of these countries were open to British  merchandize, so that we have here a convincing proof, that the wool  growers of Spain do not owe their losses, as supposed by some, to the  hostile incursions of the French, but to the friendly competition of a  neighbouring state.    Wool, both of coarse and fine quality, is daily becoming a more and  more important export from the Black Sea, owing to the great range of  pasturage in Southern Russia. The ordinary wools are very coarse, and  the fleeces dirty and full of grass seeds. Though not subject to  export duty, it is not supposed that it will ever turn out a lucrative  article for the British manufacturer.    (61.) _Wool Trade from 1800 to 1830._--The latest tabular accounts on  which much reliance can be placed, are to be found in _M'Culloch's  Commercial Dictionary_, but of these I am compelled to offer only an  abridgment, and in general nothing but the sum total of his detailed  statements. The number of short-woolled sheep in England in 1800 was  14,854,299; the number of long-woolled sheep in England in the same  year was 4,153,308. The quantity of British wool in 1800 amounted to  325,269 packs; while in 1808 it had increased to 414,502 packs. The  sheep and lambs' wool imported into Great Britain from foreign parts  in 1810 was 10,914,137 lbs.; in 1815, 13,640,375 lbs.; in 1820,  9,789,020 lbs.; in 1825, 43,795,281 lbs.; in 1830, 32,313,059 lbs. The  increase here observable in 1825 is accounted for above in our notice  of the state of the taxes before and at that period. The exports of  British sheep and lambs' wool in 1830 amounted to 2,951,100 lbs.;  those of woollen and worsted yarn to 1,108,023 lbs. By far the  larger proportion of these exports was intended for France and the  Netherlands. The number of persons employed in the manufacture is  estimated at from 480,000 to 500,000, and their wages at L9,600,000.  The value of the raw material is calculated at L6,000,000; the total  value of the manufactured articles at L18,000,000 (as wool is supposed  in general to be trebled in value by passing through the hands of the  manufacturer); and the interest on capital, sum to replace wear and  tear, and manufacturers' profits at L2,400,000.    (62.) _Wool Trade in 1832 and 1835._--\"The total number of pounds  of sheep and lambs' wool imported into the United Kingdom, in 1832,  was--foreign, 28,128,973; produce of the Isle of Man, 13,516; quantity  retained for home consumption, charged 1d. per lb. duty, 23,619,901;  ditto 1/2d., 1,571,328; ditto 6d. (red wool), 1,130; duty free  (produce of British possessions), 2,473,991; total retained for home  consumption, 27,666,350; total quantity re-exported, 555,014.

What seems to me a somewhat peculiar ceremony is the reception a coming  baby holds before its birth.    The baby is presumably about to be born. Its grandmother is there  naturally, but the black baby declines to appear at the request of its  grandmother, and, moreover, declines to come if even the voice of its  grandmother is heard; so grannie has to be a silent spectator while  some other woman tempts the baby into the world by descanting on the  glories of it. First, perhaps, she will say:    'Come now, here's your auntie waiting to see you.'    'Here's your sister.'    'Here's your father's sister,' and so on through a whole list. Then she  will say, as the relatives and friends do not seem a draw:    'Make haste, the bumble fruit is ripe. The guiebet flowers are  blooming. The grass is waving high. The birds are all talking. And it  is a beautiful place, hurry up and see for yourself.'    But it generally happens that the baby is too cute to be tempted, and  an old woman has to produce what she calls a wi-mouyan--a clever  stick--which she waves over the expectant mother, crooning a charm which  brings forth the baby.    If any one nurses a patient and the patient dies, the nurse wears an  armlet of opossum's hair called goomil, and a sort of fur boa called  gurroo.    If blacks go visiting, when they leave they make a smoke fire and smoke  themselves, so that they may not carry home any disease.    As a rule blacks do not have small feet, but their hands are almost  invariably small and well shaped, having tapering fingers.          CHAPTER VI    OUR WITCH WOMAN      Our witch woman was rather a remarkable old person. When she was, I  suppose, considerably over sixty, her favourite granddaughter died.    Old Bootha was in a terrible state of grief, and chopped herself in a  most merciless manner at the burial, especially about the head. She  would speak to no one, used to spend her time about the grave, round  which she fixed upright posts which she painted white, red, and black.  All round the grave she used to sweep continually.    More and more she isolated herself, and at last discarded all her  clothes and roamed the bush A LA Eve before the Fall, as she had  probably done as a young girl.    She dug herself an underground camp, roofed it over, and painted  enormous posts which she erected in front of her 'Muddy wine,' as she  called her camp. She never came near the house, though we had been  great friends before.    She used to prowl round the outhouses and pick up all sorts of things,  rubbish for the most part, but often good utensils too; all used to be  secreted in the underground camp. She never talked to any one, but used  to mutter continually to herself and her dogs in an unknown tongue  which only her dogs seemed to understand.    We thought she was quite mad.    One day, while we were playing tennis, she suddenly, muttering her  strange language and dancing new corroboree steps, clad only in her  black skin, came up. Matah told her to go away, but she only  corroboreed round him and said she wanted to see me. I have the most  morbid horror of lunacy in any form. I was once induced to go over a  lunatic asylum--the horror of it haunts me still. However, I thought it  would never do to show the coward I was, so though I felt as if I had  been scooped out and filled up with ice, I went to her. She danced  round me for a little time, then sidled up to me and said:    'Wahl you frightened, wahl me hurt you. I only womba--mad--all  yowee--spirits--in me tell me gubbah--good--I lib 'long a youee; bimeby  I come back big feller wirreenun; wahl you frightened? I not hurt you.'    And after crooning an accompaniment to her steps off she went, a  strange enough figure, dancing and crooning as she went towards her  camp; and not until the spirits gave up possession of her did she come  near the house again.    One day she gave us a start. We were schooling a new team of four  horses. The off-side leader had only been in once before, and was a  brumby (horse run in from a wild mob). We had to pass Bootha's camp. I  looked about as we neared it but saw nothing of her. Suddenly from the  ground, as it seemed, out dashed the weird old figure, arms full of  things, jabbering away at a great rate. Whiz came a tin plate past the  leaders' heads; the offside horse reared and plunged and took some  holding. Whiz came an old bill; then, one after another, a regular  fusilade of various utensils.    It did not take us long to get past, but for as long as we could see  the attack was kept up. Coming back we saw nothing of Bootha, and all  the utensils had been picked up.    I used to tell the other blacks to see that Bootha had plenty of food.  They said she was all right, the spirits were looking after her.  Lunatics, from their point of view, are only persons spirit-possessed.    Gradually old Bootha, clothed as usual, came back about the place.    Strange stories came through the house blacks to me of old Bootha. She  was very ill for a long time, then suddenly she recovered; not only  recovered but seemed rejuvenated. We heard of wonderful cures she made;  how she always consulted the spirits about any illness; how there were  said to be spirits in some of her dogs; how she was now a rainmaker  and, in fact, a fully fledged witch.    I was curious to see some of these wonders, so used to get the old  woman to come up when any one was ill, consult her, and generally make  much of her. There is no doubt she could diagnose a case well enough.  Matah suffered a good deal with a constant pain in one knee, he was  quite lame from it. He showed it to Bootha one day. She sang a song to  her spirits, then said:    'Too muchee water there; you steam him, put him on hot rag; you drink  plenty cold water, all lite dat go.'    As it happened a medical man was passing a few days afterwards with an  insurance agent. Matah consulted him.    'Hum! Yes, yes. Hot fomentations to the place affected, poultices, a  cooling draught. There's a stoppage of fluid at the knee-joint which  must be dispersed.'    I thought Bootha ought to have been called in consultation.    A girl I had staying with me was taken suddenly and, to us,  unaccountably ill. She was just able to get out of her room into the  drawing-room, where she would lie back on the cushions of a lounge  looking dreadfully limp and utterly washed out. Hearing of her illness  old Bootha came up. I thought it might amuse Adelaide to see an old  witch; she agreed, so I brought her in.    Bootha went straight up to the sick girl, expressed a few sympathetic  sentences, then she said she would ask the spirits what had made  Adelaide ill and what would cure her.    She moved my furniture until she left the centre of the room clear; she  squatted down, and hanging her head began muttering in an  unintelligible dialect. Presently her voice ceased and we heard from  beside her a most peculiar whistling sort of voice, to which she  responded, evidently interrogating. Again the whistling voice from  further away. Bootha then told me she had asked a dead black fellow,  Big Joe, to tell her what she wanted to know; but he could not, so now  she was going to ask her dead granddaughter. Again she said a sort of  incantation, and again, after a while, came the whistling voice  reply--this time from another direction, not quite so loud. The same  sort of thing was gone through with the same result.    Then Bootha said she would ask Guadgee, a black girl who had been one  of my first favourites in the camp, and who had died a few years  previously.    The whistling voice came from a third direction, though all the time I  could see Bootha's lips moving.    Guadgee answered all she was asked. She said Adelaide was made ill  because she had offended the spirits by bathing in the creek under the  shade of a Minggah, or spirit-tree, a place tabooed to all but  wirreenuns, or such as hold communion with spirits.    Of course, according to the blacks, to disturb a shadow is to hurt the  original.    In this Minggah, Guadgee said, were swarms of bees invisible to all  but wirreenuns, and they are ready always to resent any insult to the  Minggah or its shadow. These spirit-bees had entered Adelaide and  secreted some wax on her liver; their bites, Guadgee said, were on her  back.    Well, that can't be it, I said, I for you never did bathe in the shade  of a Minggah; for, going as you always do with the house-girls, you are  bound to be kept from such sacrilege; they would never dare such  desecration.'    'Which is their Minggah? Is it a big Coolabah between the Bend and the  garden?'    'Yes.'    'Then I did bathe there the last time I went down. I was up too late to  go with the Black-but-Comelys, and as the sun was hot I went further  round the point and bathed in the shade. And the bee-bites must be  those horribly irritating pimples I have across my back.'    The cause of illness settled to her satisfaction, Bootha asked how to  cure it. The patient was to drink nothing hot nor heating but as much  cold water as she liked, especially a long drink before going to bed.  Guadgee said she would come in the night when the patient was asleep  and take the wax from her liver; she would sleep well and wake better  in the morning.    Bootha got up then, came over to the patient, took her hand, rubbed it  round the wrist several times, muttering an incantation; then saying  she would see her again next day, off she went, taking, she told us,  all the spirits away inside her, whence at desire they could be  returned to such Minggah in their own Noorunbah, or hereditary  hunting-grounds, as wirreenuns had placed them in, or to roam at their  pleasure when not required by those in authority over spirits. Our old  spiritualist denies us freedom even in the after-life she promises us."]]]
