Soft iron cores are not used  in oscillation inductance coils and oscillation transformers for the  reason that the frequency of the current is so high the iron would not  have time to magnetize and demagnetize and so would not help along the  mutual induction to any appreciable extent.    High-Frequency Currents.--High frequency currents, or electric  oscillations as they are called, are currents of electricity that  surge to and fro in a circuit a million times, more or less, per  second. Currents of such high frequencies will _oscillate_, that is,  surge to and fro, in an _open circuit_, such as an aerial wire system,  as well as in a _closed circuit_.    Now there is only one method by which currents of high frequency, or  _radio-frequency_, as they are termed, can be set up by spark  transmitters, and this is by discharging a charged condenser through a  circuit having a small resistance. To charge a condenser a spark coil  or a transformer is used and the ends of the secondary coil, which  delivers the high potential alternating current, are connected with  the condenser. To discharge the condenser automatically a _spark,_ or  an _arc,_ or the _flow of electrons_ in a vacuum tube, is employed.    Constants of an Oscillation Circuit.--An oscillation circuit, as  pointed out before, is one in which high frequency currents surge or  oscillate. Now the number of times a high frequency current will surge  forth and back in a circuit depends upon three factors of the latter  and these are called the constants of the circuit, namely: (1) its  _capacitance,_ (2) its _inductance_ and (3) its _resistance._    What Capacitance Is.--The word _capacitance_ means the _electrostatic  capacity_ of a condenser or a circuit. The capacitance of a condenser  or a circuit is the quantity of electricity which will raise its  pressure, or potential, to a given amount. The capacitance of a  condenser or a circuit depends on its size and form and the voltage of  the current that is charging it.    The capacitance of a condenser or a circuit is directly proportional  to the quantity of electricity that will keep the charge at a given  potential. The _farad,_ whose symbol is _M,_ is the unit of  capacitance and a condenser or a circuit to have a capacitance of one  farad must be of such size that one _coulomb,_ which is the unit of  electrical quantity, will raise its charge to a potential of one volt.  Since the farad is far too large for practical purposes a millionth of  a farad, or _microfarad_, whose symbol is _mfd._, is used.    What Inductance Is.--Under the sub-caption of _Self-induction_ and  _Inductance_ in the beginning of this chapter it was shown that it was  the inductance of a coil that makes a current flowing through it  produce a strong magnetic field, and here, as one of the constants of  an oscillation circuit, it makes a high-frequency current act as  though it possessed _inertia_.    Inertia is that property of a material body that requires time and  energy to set in motion, or stop. Inductance is that property of an  oscillation circuit that makes an electric current take time to start  and time to stop. Because of the inductance, when a current flows  through a circuit it causes the electric energy to be absorbed and  changes a large part of it into magnetic lines of force. Where high  frequency currents surge in a circuit the inductance of it becomes a  powerful factor. The practical unit of inductance is the _henry_ and  it is represented by the symbol _L_.    What Resistance Is.--The resistance of a circuit to high-frequency  currents is different from that for low voltage direct or alternating  currents, as the former do not sink into the conductor to nearly so  great an extent; in fact, they stick practically to the surface of it,  and hence their flow is opposed to a very much greater extent. The  resistance of a circuit to high frequency currents is generally found  in the spark gap, arc gap, or the space between the electrodes of a  vacuum tube. The unit of resistance is, as stated, the _ohm_, and its  symbol is _R_.    The Effect of Capacitance, Inductance and Resistance on Electric  Oscillations.--If an oscillation circuit in which high frequency  currents surge has a large resistance, it will so oppose the flow of  the currents that they will be damped out and reach zero gradually, as  shown at A in Fig. 33. But if the resistance of the circuit is small,  and in wireless circuits it is usually so small as to be negligible,  the currents will oscillate, until their energy is damped out by  radiation and other losses, as shown at B.    [Illustration: Fig. 33.--The Effect of Resistance on the Discharge of  an Electric Current.]    As the capacitance and the inductance of the circuit, which may be  made of any value, that is amount, you wish, determines the _time  period_, that is, the length of time for a current to make one  complete oscillation, it must be clear that by varying the values of  the condenser and the inductance coil you can make the high frequency  current oscillate as fast or as slow as you wish within certain  limits. Where the electric oscillations that are set up are very fast,  the waves sent out by the aerial will be short, and, conversely, where  the oscillations are slow the waves emitted will be long.          CHAPTER VI    HOW THE TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING SETS WORK      The easiest way to get a clear conception of how a wireless  transmitter sends out electric waves and how a wireless receptor  receives them is to take each one separately and follow: (1) in the  case of the transmitter, the transformation of the low voltage direct,  or alternating current into high potential alternating currents; then  find out how these charge the condenser, how this is discharged by the  spark gap and sets up high-frequency currents in the oscillation  circuits; then (2) in the case of the receptor, to follow the high  frequency currents that are set up in the aerial wire and learn how  they are transformed into oscillations of lower potential when they  have a larger current strength, how these are converted into  intermittent direct currents by the detector and which then flow into  and operate the telephone receiver.    How Transmitting Set No. 1 Works. The Battery and Spark Coil  Circuit.--When you press down on the knob of the key the silver points  of it make contact and this closes the circuit; the low voltage direct  current from the battery now flows through the primary coil of the  spark coil and this magnetizes the soft iron core. The instant it  becomes magnetic it pulls the spring of the vibrator over to it and  this breaks the circuit; when this takes place the current stops  flowing through the primary coil; this causes the core to lose its  magnetism when the vibrator spring flies back and again makes contact  with the adjusting screw; then the cycle of operations is repeated.    A condenser is connected across the contact points of the vibrator  since this gives a much higher voltage at the ends of the secondary  coil than where the coil is used without it; this is because: (1) the  self-induction of the primary coil makes the pressure of the current  rise and when the contact points close the circuit again it discharges  through the primary coil, and (2) when the break takes place the  current flows into the condenser instead of arcing across the contact  points.    Changing the Primary Spark Coil Current Into Secondary Currents.--Now  every time the vibrator contact points close the primary circuit the  electric current in the primary coil is changed into closed magnetic  lines of force and as these cut through the secondary coil they set up  in it a _momentary current_ in one direction. Then the instant the  vibrator points break apart the primary circuit is opened and the  closed magnetic lines of force contract and as they do so they cut the  turns of wire in the secondary coil in the opposite direction and this  sets up another momentary current in the secondary coil in the other  direction. The result is that the low voltage direct current of the  battery is changed into alternating currents whose frequency is  precisely that of the spring vibrator, but while the frequency of the  currents is low their potential, or voltage, is enormously increased.    What Ratio of Transformation Means.--To make a spark coil step up the  low voltage direct current into high potential alternating current the  primary coil is wound with a couple of layers of thick insulated  copper wire and the secondary is wound with a thousand, more or less,  number of turns with very fine insulated copper wire. If the primary  and secondary coils were wound with the same number of turns of wire  then the pressure, or voltage, of the secondary coil at its terminals  would be the same as that of the current which flowed through the  primary coil. Under these conditions the _ratio of transformation_, as  it is called, would be unity.    The ratio of transformation is directly proportional to the number of  turns of wire on the primary and secondary coils and, since this is  the case, if you wind 10 turns of wire on the primary coil and 1,000  turns of wire on the secondary coil then you will get 100 times as  high a pressure, or voltage, at the terminals of the secondary as that  which you caused to flow through the primary coil, but, naturally, the  current strength, or amperage, will be proportionately decreased.    The Secondary Spark Coil Circuit.--This includes the secondary coil  and the spark gap which are connected together.

The matter  briefly is this.  I have been approached by the Grand Duke of  Mecklenburg-Schwerein to assist him in the solving of a rather  delicate private affair.  It is outside the usual routine but we find  it advisable to comply.  The mission is delicate and leads into  England, for which reasons I have decided to let you undertake the  affair if willing.  In case of acceptance, all necessary leave of  absence will be arranged.  This is not a command but let me again  point out the advisability of your showing compliance.    Truly yours, V. Wedel.    Three weeks in the pine forests had been better than all the  physicians in Berlin.  Besides, I was tired of the monotonous country  life and was hungry for the fleshpots of Egypt.  Between the lines of  Wedel's letter I could read the opportunities for earning a handsome  fee.  I wrote Wedel that I had no objections, providing the mission  was something I could accomplish, for I was still in the dark as to  its nature.  I knew that intruding into the private affairs of ducal  and princely houses is often a most unthankful business.  I have ever  found it more satisfactory and less nerve racking to undertake a  mission into some foreign country than to become involved with some  petty local affair of royalty.  For some such affair I judged to be  the dilemma of the house of Mecklenburg-Schwerein.    Within two days there came another communication from Wedel asking me  to be at Mecklenburg-Schwerein on a certain immediate day.  Taking  leave of my friends, and thanking them for their hospitality, I left  for Schwerein.  Upon my arrival at the seat of the dukedom I was met  by a quiet landau of the Grand Ducal stables.  Two flunkies in the  Grand Duke's livery took my luggage, escorted me to the carriage and I  was driven up to the old castle.  The landau took me to a side  entrance and I was promptly shown into an austere and unpretentious  chamber.  Scarcely had I entered when a quiet, elderly,  benevolent-looking gentleman dressed in a shooting jacket appeared in  another doorway, evidently much perturbed.  I at once recognized him  as the old Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerein.  He appraised me for  fully a minute; then as if to himself he said:    \"You're only a boy, but I suppose they know,\" shaking his great gray  head.  \"Strange times.  Strange times.\"  Then suddenly realizing his  inhospitality, he urged me to be seated.  \"Take a seat, take a seat.\"    Unlike the gentlemen of the Wilhelmstrasse, he did not plunge  immediately into the subject at hand.  He began a chat with me about  purely personal affairs.  Finally the conversation drifting around to  the cause of my visit, he said:    \"Can you fulfill this mission?\"    I told him I could not say until I had learned what it was.  I  requested that he give me the privilege of refusal should I find  myself unable to negotiate it successfully.  He agreed that it was  fair and when he looked at me again he seemed to suggest that he did  not believe me so young after all.    \"There's rather an unhappy and most inconvenient entanglement in my  household,\" he began.  \"My nephew, the young Grand Duke, is tangled up  and ensnarled with a certain lady in England whom he wishes to marry.  It is unfortunate that she is of too high a social status to be  entirely ignored or roughly bought off.  Still, she is not eligible  for admission into our house.  For more than political reasons, it is  impossible that she enter into an alliance with us.\"  His eyes  flashed.  \"This lady has lately threatened to make trouble through my  persistent refusal to countenance her desired relationship.\"  He  frowned.  \"She has in her possession compromising letters and  documents which my nephew was foolish enough to give her.  These must  be returned to my hands.  Monetary questions need not be considered  for a moment.  Pressure and influence have been tried on both my  nephew and the lady.  But of no avail.  The means I leave to you.  But  force and publicity must at all cost be avoided.  I can give you very  little help as to procedure and information.  What do you think of the  chances?\"    It has ever been my way to he conservative in making promises and I  said:    \"I hope your Highness will pardon me, but I find it often undesirable  to voice my thoughts until I have reached a certain stage of my  investigations.\"    This appeared to impress him and he rose saying:    \"I am entirely in your hands.  Communicate direct with my chamberlain,  or if necessary to use cable, I shall arrange with your chief in  Berlin for forwarding facilities.  Be good enough to wait and I shall  send you my secretary.\"  Slapping me on the shoulder, \"You'll not  regret it, helping us out of this quandary.\"    Neither did I.  The Grand Duke stalked out.  A flunky appeared and  conducted me to a private little dining-room where cold game and wine  were served and at the end of which the secretary came in and handed  me an envelope with the Grand Duke's compliments and a request to  start at once on my mission.  Assuring him I would be on the road that  same night, I returned to Berlin.  I got Stammer of the Wilhelmstrasse  on the telephone and requested a preliminary two months' leave of  absence.  I then caught the Hook of Holland Express en route for  London.    Upon opening the Grand Duke's letter I had found it contained three  bank notes of 1000 marks each and a draft for 500 pounds on the  English, Scottish and Colonial Bank, with a note saying that any  future request would be honored at three days' notice to the same  bank.  Thus I would have all the money I wanted in London.    On the way over, I followed my usual custom and considered the  situation in detail.  The lady in question was in society and the  first thing to do was to try to get in touch with the little circle or  clique in which she moved.  This might have been difficult in any  other city but London.  But a man of appearance, culture and money,  setting his stage right, can with tact and persistence force an entry  into any clique of London society.    The only thing I had to worry about was a setting of my stage.  I was  undecided about it.  One often has to leave things to circumstances,  being guided by any momentary points that may arise.  My first task  was to create an impression, something that would get people talking  about me.  I did not want to show any sensational parvenuism; London  is not impressed by that.    Rather, I must become known for some eccentricity that would arouse  legitimate curiosity.  Your Britisher, the women included, are always  interested in a man of travel, a hunter, a desultory globe-trotter;  and nothing attracts the English mind so quickly as a well-bred  eccentricity in manner or habit.  The broad lines of my plan  determined upon, I left the precise setting of the stage until the  last minute.    I quartered myself at first at the Russel Square Hotel, in a few days  transferring to the patrician Langham.  I began by making tentative  inquiries.  I purchased all society papers which I read from cover to  cover, and then carefully feeling my way put further questions that  would locate the set in which my lady was a central figure.  From  acquaintances I made around the hotel, from the society reporters of  newspapers, I began to get little scraps of information.  Fortunately  it was the season in London and everybody was coming into town.  I  soon knew who the Lady's intimates were and their favorite rendezvous.  The next step was to become familiar with the personality of the lady  and to gain some idea as to her habits, her likes and dislikes.  I  heard that the lady was in the habit of going horseback riding in Hyde  Park.  Every day I made it my business to take a two-hour canter along  the bridle path.  My patience was rewarded on the fifth morning, for I  saw her galloping by with a party of friends.    The next morning I was on the bridle path at the same hour.  Finally  she came galloping along with the same group, and after they had  almost gone from sight, I galloped after them.  I found out where they  kept their horses and after they had dismounted I sauntered up to the  stable and made inquiries.  I learned that they always went out at the  same time of day.  Thereafter I made it my business to pass the lady  on the bridle path day after day.  I pride myself on few things, but  my horsemanship is one of them.  Many a hard tussle and bleeding nose  I got riding Brumbies across the wild tracks of Australia.  I also  learned a trick or two among my Tuareg friends which I exhibited for  the lady's benefit on various occasions.  I did not hope to gain an  introduction, but only to attract attention and familiarize her party  with my appearance, applying one of the test points of human  psychology.  I employed the theory of the subconscious attraction of  an often-seen, though unknown face.    I soon ascertained that my lady and her friends followed all the whims  of London society.  One in particular interested me.  They were in the  habit of frequenting Carlton Terrace between three and four every  afternoon and eating strawberries.  I also went to eat strawberries.    Carlton Terrace during the strawberry season is an exquisitely colored  fashion plate of life's butterflies and drones.  This throng of  fashion and beauty, marked with its air of distinction carelessly  abandoned to pleasure, ever murmuring pleasant nothings and tossing  light persiflage from table to table, is truly an interesting study of  the lighter sides of life.  One sits on a magnificent markee-covered,  glass-enclosed terrace, overlooking the Thames with its ever-changing  scenes of fussy tugs and squat barges.    At Carlton Terrace one pays well for the subtleties of eating.  By  courteous consideration of the waitresses I managed to secure a  much-covet"]]]
