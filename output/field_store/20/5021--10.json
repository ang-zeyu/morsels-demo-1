Moreover, we find the same lunar horn again in  the city of _Cringaveram_, where first the solar hero Ramas, and  afterwards his brother Bharatas, are hospitably received when the sun is  darkened,[182] by _Guhas_, king of the black _Wishadas_, who also is of  the colour of a black cloud;[183] and Ramas and Bharatas take their  departure in the morning from Guhas, who is said to wander always in the  forests.[184] Now, this Guhas, who, though always hidden, yet wishes to  entertain the solar hero during the night with presents of the town of  Cringaveram, appears to me to be just another form of the solar hero  himself, who enters and hides himself in the night, hospitably received  in the lunar habitation, another form of the god Indras, whom we have  seen in the _Rigvedas_ united during the night to Indus or Somas--that  is, to the moon--and who, in the _Ramayanam_[185], when Sita is in the  power of the monster, comes down during the night to console her, lulls  her keepers to sleep, and nourishes her with the ambrosial milk (with  Soma, the moon, the same moon which, in the _Rigvedas_, the dawn, the  girl beloved of Indras, and whom therefore he does good to, brings him  as a present), encouraging her with the prospect of the near advent of  Ramas, the deliverer.    But it remains to us to adduce clearer evidence to show that in the  _Ramayanam_ Ramas is the sun, and Sita the dawn, or aurora.    Without taking into account that Ramas is the most popular  personification of Vishnus, and that Vishnus is often the solar hero  (although he is not seldom identified with the moon), let us see how  Ramas manifests himself, and what he does in the _Ramayanam_ to  vindicate especially his solar nature.    It is my opinion that the best way to prove this is to show how Ramas  performs the very same miracles that Indras does. Ramas, like Indras,  gives, while still young, extraordinary proofs of his strength; Ramas,  like Indras, achieves his greatest enterprises while he is himself  hidden; Ramas, like Indras, vanquishes the monster, reconquers Sita, and  enjoys of right the company of his wife. Till Ramas goes into the  forests, as Indras into the clouds and shadows, his great epopee  does not begin. Indras has for assistants the winds (the Marutas);  Ramas has for his greatest help Hanumant, the son of the wind  (_Marutatmagah_);[186] Hanumant amuses himself with the monsters, as the  wind with the archer-clouds of the thousand-eyed Indras;[187] and it is  said that Ramas gets on Hanumant's back, as Indras does on the elephant  _Airavatas_. The elephant with a proboscis is not unfrequently  substituted, in the brahmanic tradition, for the horned bull of the  Vedas.[188] But the bull Indras is reproduced in the bull Ramas, and the  monkeys who assist Ramas have kept at least the tail of the Vedic cows,  the helpers of Indras, whence their generic name of _golangulas_ (who  have cows' tails).[189] The bow with which Ramas shoots the monsters is  made of a horn, whence his name of _Carngadhanvant_ (he who shoots with  the horn);[190] Ramas receives the shower of hostile darts, as a bull  upon its horns the abundant rains of autumn.[191] Sita herself calls  both her Ramas and his brother Lakshmanas by the name of  _sinharshabhau_,[192] or the lion and the bull, which are conjoined so  frequently in the mythology, on account of equal strength; hence the  terror of the lion when he hears the bull bellow in the first book of  the _Pancatantram_, and in all the numerous Eastern and Western  variations of that book. Indras has his conflicts in the cloudy, rainy,  and gloomy sky; these are also the battle-fields of Ramas. The names of  the monsters of the _Ramayanam_, as, for instance, _Vidyuggivas_ (he who  lives upon thunderbolts), _Vagrodari_ (she who has thunderbolts in her  stomach), _Indragit_ (who vanquishes Indras with magical arts),  _Meghanadas_ (thundering cloud),[193] and others, show us the nature of  the battle. In the battle-field of Ramas, instead, the assisting hero is  now a bull (_rishabhas_), now an ox's eye (_gavakshas_), now _gavayas_  (_bos gavoeus_), and beings of similar appellations, which remind us of  the Vedic deities. Indras strikes with lightning the celestial ocean;  Ramas, an Indian Xerxes, chastises the sea with burning arrows.[194]  Indras, in the _Rigvedas_, crosses the sea and passes ninety-nine  rivers; Ramas crosses the ocean upon a bridge of mountains, in carrying  which Hanumant, the son of the wind, shows himself peculiarly skilful;  the winds carry the clouds, which we have seen, in the language of the  Vedas, represented as mountains. And that clouds, and not real  mountains, are here spoken of, we deduce from observing, as we read,  that while the animal army of Ramas carries the bridge on to the ocean,  or the winds carry the clouds into the sky, the sun cannot burn the  weary monkey-workers, because that clouds arise and cover it, rain  falls, and the wind expires.[195] The field of this epic battle is  evidently the same as that of the mythical battle of Indras. And in the  _Ramayanam_ we find at every step the similarity of the combatants to  the dark clouds, the bellowing clouds, the clouds carried by the wind.  The forest which Ramas goes through is compared to a group of  clouds.[196] The name of wanderer by night (_raganicaras_), afterwards  given frequently in the _Ramayanam_, to the monster whom Ramas combats,  implies, of course, that the battle is fought by night. The fact that,  as we read, the witch _Curpanakha_ comes in winter to seduce Ramas  whilst he is in the forest,[197] and the monster _Kumbhakarnas_ awakens  after six months' sleep, like a rainy cloud which increases towards the  end of summer (_tapante_),[198] shows us that the epic poem of Ramas  embraces, besides the nightly battle of the sun over darkness, also the  great annual battle of the sun in winter to recover and rejoin the  spring. Anyhow, it is always a battle of the sun against the monster of  darkness. Ramas, in the very beginning of the great poem, says to his  brother Lakshmanas:--\"See, O Lakshmanas, Maricas is come here with his  followers, making a noise like thunder, and with him the wanderer by  night Subahus; thou wilt see them to-day, like a mass of dark clouds,  dispersed by me in a moment, like clouds by the wind.\"[199] Here we find  almost the whole battle of Indras.    And similar battles in the clouds are found in several other episodes of  the _Ramayanam_. The dart of Ramas falls upon the monster _Kharas_ (the  monster ass), as upon a great tree falls the thunderbolt hurled by  Indras.[200] Heroes and monsters combat with stones and rocks from the  great mountain, and fall, overthrown on the earth, like mountains. The  monster Ravanas carries off Sita with the magic of the wind and the  tempest.[201] Heroes and monsters fight with trunks of trees from the  great forest; moreover, the trunks themselves, having become monsters,  join the fray, stretch out their strange arms, and devour the hero in  their cavities. And here we come upon the interesting legend of  _Kabandhas_, in which we find again the forests and trees combating,  and the barrel of the Vedas carried by the divine bull. The _Danavas_ or  demons also appear, in the _Mahabharatam_,[202] in the forms of sounding  barrels. In the _Ramayanam_, the highest of the demons (_danavottamah_)  is called by the name of _Kabandhas_ (barrel and trunk), compared to a  black thundering cloud, and represented as an enormous trunk, having one  large yellowish eye, and an enormous devouring mouth in his chest.[203]  In Tuscany, we say of water that gushes copiously out of a reservoir,  that it pours as from a barrel's mouth. The monster Kabandhas draws  towards himself, with his long arms, the two brothers Ramas and  Lakshmanas (compared several times in the _Ramayanam_[204] to the two  Acvinau, who resemble each other in everything). Ramas and Lakshmanas,  _i.e._, the two Acvinau, the morning and evening, the spring and autumn  suns, the two twilights, who, in a passage of the _Ramayanam_, are  called the two ears of Ramas, cut off the two extremities, the two long  arms, of the monster _Kabandhas_; upon which the trunk, able no longer  to support itself, falls to the ground. The fallen monster then relates  to the two brothers that he was once a beautiful demon; but that, by a  malediction, Indras one day made his head and legs enter his body; his  arms having been lacerated by the two brothers, the monster is  disenchanted from this malediction, and having resumed his form of a  splendid demon, he ascends to heaven in a luminous form. Here we have  the all-radiant sun shut up in the cloud, he being the yellow eye, the  burning mouth, of Kabandhas, and, in union with the cloud, forming a  hideous monster; the hero comes to destroy his monstrous form, and the  monster thanks him, for thus he becomes the glorious god, the splendid  being, the handsome prince he was before. Ramas who delivers Kabandhas  from his monstrous form by cutting off his two arms, is the sun Ramas  coming forth from the gloomy forest, and uncovering the sky in the east  and in the west. Ramas delivering Kabandhas is simply the sun delivering  himself from the monster of gloom and cloud that envelops him. And,  indeed, the greater part of the myths have their origin in the plurality  of appellations given to the same phenomenon. Each appellation grows  into a distinct personality, and the various personalities fight with  each other. Hence the hero who delivers himself becomes the deliverer of  the hero, viewed as a different person from the hero; the monstrous form  which envelops the hero is often his own malediction; the hero who comes  to kill this monstrous form is his benefactor.[205]    This theory of the monster who thanks the hero that kills him, agrees  with what we find on several other occasions in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38750"],[0,"Current History: A Monthly Magazine of the New York Times, May 1918 (#12)"],[1," although before then there  had been a steady slogging of guns and howling of shells, at that time  this volume of dreadful noise increased tremendously, and drumfire broke  out in fury, so that the sky and earth trembled with it. It was like the  beating of all the drums of the world in muffled tattoo, above which and  through which there were enormous clangoring hammer strokes from the  British and German heavies.    It went on till evening, with a few pale gleams of sun through storm  clouds and the smoke of guns, and for miles all this panorama of battle  was boiling and seething with bursting shells and curling wreaths of  smoke from the batteries in action.    When darkness came each battery was revealed by its flashes, and all the  fields around were filled with red winkings and sharp stabs of flame.  There was no real darkness of night, for every second the sky was  crossed by rushes of light and burning beacons in many places, and gun  flashes etched outlines of trees and cottages.    The general situation today is in our favor for the time being by the  recapture of Wytschaete and Meteren and the repulse of many German  attacks, but it is with natural regret one hears of the withdrawal from  the heights east of Ypres in order to straighten the line and economize  men. There was one other regret today, though only sentimental. The  enemy knocked down the Albert church tower, the tower of the golden  Virgin, who had bent head downward over that ruined city with her babe  outstretched. It was a great landmark bound up with all our memories.          How General Carey Saved Amiens    A Pivotal Episode in the Great Battle      One of the most dramatic episodes of the battle of Picardy was the  disaster which befell the 5th British Army, under General Gough, and the  brilliant way in which it was retrieved by Brig. Gen. Sandeman Carey,  who was warmly complimented by Premier Lloyd George in his man-power  speech, (Page 263.)    Sir Hubert Gough's army was sent down in January to take over from the  French a sector forty to fifty miles long. Clearly such a line as this  could be held only if it were strongly located and cunningly  constructed, and there is no doubt that it was. Three lines were  designed: First, an outpost line, then a \"line of resistance,\" and then  a \"battleline.\" The outpost line was designed with special care. It  consisted of a number of separate posts so located as to provide for a  cross-fire on any enemy that penetrated them. It was intended to be held  until the last gasp, and it was presumed that the Germans might pass  through it, but that they would be terribly punished by the garrisons of  the isolated posts.    In one way the attack was not a surprise. General Gough had known for  days that it was imminent, and had moved his men up to their positions  and made every preparation possible. But one thing he could not foresee  or guard against--the mist and fog. Under cover of the mist, which  prevented sight for more than thirty yards, the Germans crept forward,  and the outpost line was overrun before the alarm could be given. It was  simply swamped, and the cross-fire on which so much depended was never  delivered.    Consequently the fight began at the line of resistance instead, and  before many hours had passed by sheer weight of numbers the Germans had  forced the British back on the battleline. Then the fewness of numbers  began to tell, and, as always at points of junction between divisions,  the Germans got through between the 7th and 19th, the 19th and 18th, and  the 3d and 18th. The whole line was broken up, and it seemed as if the  road was open to Amiens.    Meanwhile it was impossible for the French reinforcements to come up as  quickly as was necessary, and the retreat began. Bridges were not blown  up for the simple reason that the parties of engineers were all killed.  Every kind of soldier that could be collected was hastily thrown into  action to fill the gap--including a strong contingent of American  engineers.    Close to where the gap occurred was a training school for machine  gunners. Of course, the men in training had long since been hurried into  action, but a large supply of machine guns remained. It is not every  soldier, however, who understands how to use these weapons, and the  officer found himself with a large supply of them which at all costs he  must prevent from being captured, and very few men able to handle them.  Those who could were put in charge of squads, and whenever they had a  moment's respite from turning them on the Germans they set to work to  give hurried instructions.    Orders came to General Carey at 2 A. M., March 26, to hold the gap. He  went to work at once to develop the plans that had been hurriedly laid  out. He organized a scratch force by telephone, messengers, and flag  signals. Every available man--laborer, raw recruit, sapper,  engineer--was rounded up. By the middle of the next morning Carey had  found a considerable number of men, and by the early part of the  afternoon he had organized them into some sort of force and had selected  and marked out the position it must hold.    For a time he had some guns, but these were hurried away to another  point that was even more seriously threatened. He had fifty cavalrymen  to do a little scouting, but in the main he had to depend entirely on  the sheer grit of his scratch force, who lay in their shallow trenches,  firing almost point blank at the gray hordes of Germans, and at every  moment of respite seized their shovels to improve their shelters.    For nearly six days they stuck to it, and, as Lloyd George said, \"they  held the German Army and closed that gap on the way to Amiens.\"    After a time they got some artillery behind them and things were easier,  but at first it was just a ding-dong fight, with soldiers taking orders  from strange officers, officers learning the ground by having to defend  it, and every man from enlisted man to Brigadier jumping at each job as  it came along and putting it through with all his might.    During all that six days General Carey was the life and inspiration of  the entire force. Careless of danger, he rode along the hastily  intrenched line, giving an order here and shouting words of  encouragement there to his weary and hard-pressed men.    His staff was as hastily recruited as his men. He had no knowledge of  how long he must hold out. He was not even certain of getting supplies  of ammunition and provisions.    All he had to do was to hang on, and hang on he did against an almost  endless series of formidable attacks. He never lost heart or wavered.  The gap to Amiens was closed and held.    Three companies of an engineering regiment were caught in the early  bombardment and ordered to fall back. To one of the American companies,  which had been consolidated with the British Royal Engineers, was  delegated the task of guaranteeing the destruction of an engineers'  dump, which it had been decided to abandon. This detachment destroyed  all the material, made a rapid retreat, caught up with the larger group,  and immediately resumed work, laying out trenches. These operations  lasted from March 22 to 27. As the German attack became more intense,  the engineers were joined by cooks, orderlies, and railway men as a part  of General Carey's forces. The commanding officer of an American  regiment took charge of an infantry sub-sector and directed the action  of his troops for one week, until the emergency passed at that point. To  this officer General Rawlinson, commanding the British Army engaged in  that sector, sent the following letter:        The army commander wishes to record officially his appreciation      of the excellent work your regiment has done in assisting the      British Army to resist the enemy's powerful offensive during the      last ten days. I fully realize that it has been largely due to      your assistance that the enemy has been checked, and I rely on      you to assist us still further during the few days which are      still to come before I shall be able to relieve you in the line.        I consider your work in the line to be greatly enhanced by the      fact that, for six weeks previous to taking your place in the      front line, your men had been working at such high pressure      erecting heavy bridges on the Somme. My best congratulations and      warm thanks to all.        RAWLINSON.    [Illustration: Gen. Sir H. S. Horne]    [Illustration: Gen. Sir Julian Byng  (_Underwood_)]    [Illustration: Gen. Sir H. C.
