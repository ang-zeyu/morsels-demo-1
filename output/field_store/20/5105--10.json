How much farther  the work might have proved successful had it not been for the  negotiations between Botha and the Commander-in-Chief which took place  during the movement, cannot be stated. Certain it is that General  French was much hampered by the palaver which ended in air, for  Botha's ruse or so-called negotiations enabled the Boers to slip  northwards unmolested. As the pacific nature of the negotiations has  been the subject of much comment, it is as well to append the origin  and substance of them.    On February 23 a telegram was received by Sir Alfred Milner from the  Commander-in-Chief, Pretoria, which stated, under date of the 22nd  February, that Mrs. Botha had come back from meeting her husband,  bringing from him an answer to a verbal message from the  Commander-in-Chief, that if he desired it, he (General Botha) would  meet him as to the means of bringing the war to an end, but on the  express understanding that the question of the independence of the  Transvaal and Orange River Colony should not be discussed in any way.  The meeting would probably take place at Middelburg.    This telegram was sent to Mr. Chamberlain, who replied, February 23:--         \"I am glad to hear of Botha's desire to treat, and I hope that       it is genuine. He will find us most anxious, in that case, to       meet him on all points affecting individual position. We have       already made clear the policy we intend to pursue as to future       government.\"    On March 1 Lord Kitchener telegraphed:--         \"I have had a long interview with Botha, who showed very good       feeling, and seemed anxious to bring about peace. He asked for       information on a number of subjects which he said that he       should submit to his Government and people, and if they agreed       he should visit Orange River Colony and get them to agree. They       should all then hand in their arms and finish the war. He told       me that they could go on for some time, and that he was not       sure of being able to bring about peace without independence.       He tried very hard for some kind of independence, but I       declined to discuss such a point, and said that a modified form       of independence would be most dangerous and likely to lead to       war in the future.\"    Lord Kitchener then detailed the points upon which Botha required  information. These points were noted by the Commander-in-Chief, and  his suggestions were embodied in a telegram of March 3 from Sir Alfred  Milner to Mr. Chamberlain. The Colonial Secretary replied on March 6,  suggesting modifications which his Majesty's Government desired should  be made in the letter to Botha. A telegram from Sir Alfred Milner of  March 9 reported that he and Lord Kitchener were both opposed to the  assistance to burghers being limited to loans, but that the amended  message was sent to the Commandant on March 7.    Lord Kitchener, in a telegram to Mr. Brodrick on March 20, detailed  the terms of his letter to Commandant Botha:--         \"With reference to our conversation at Middelburg on 28th       February, I have the honour to inform you that in the event of       a general and complete cessation of hostilities and the       surrender of all rifles, ammunition, cannon, and other       munitions of war in the hands of the burghers or in Government       depots or elsewhere, his Majesty's Government is prepared to       adopt the following measures:--         \"His Majesty's Government will at once grant an amnesty in the       Transvaal and Orange River Colonies for all _bona fide_ acts of       war committed during the recent hostilities. British subjects       belonging to Natal and Cape Colony, while they will not be       compelled to return to those colonies, will, if they do so, be       liable to be dealt with by the law of those colonies, specially       passed to meet the circumstances arising out of the present       war. As you are doubtless aware, the special law in the Cape       Colony has greatly mitigated the ordinary penalties for high       treason in the present cases.         \"All prisoners of war now in St. Helena, Ceylon, or elsewhere       will, on the completion of the surrender, be brought back to       their country as quickly as arrangements can be made for their       transport.         \"At the earliest practicable date military administration will       cease and will be replaced by civil administration in the form       of Crown Colony Government. There will therefore be, in the       first instance, in each of the new Colonies a Governor and an       Executive Council, consisting of a certain number of official       members, to whom a nominated unofficial element will be added.       But it is the desire of his Majesty's Government, as soon as       circumstances permit, to introduce a representative element,       and ultimately to concede to the new Colonies the privilege of       self-government. Moreover, on the cessation of hostilities a       High Court will be established in each of the new Colonies to       administer the law of the land, and this court will be       independent of the Executive.         \"Church property, public trusts, and orphans' funds will be       respected. Both the English and Dutch languages will be used       and taught in public schools where parents of the children       desire it, and allowed in Courts of Law.         \"As regards the debts of the late Republican Governments, his       Majesty's Government cannot undertake any liability. It is,       however, prepared, as an act of grace, to set aside a sum not       exceeding L1,000,000 to repay inhabitants of the Transvaal and       Orange River Colonies for goods requisitioned from them by the       late Republican Governments or, subsequent to annexation, by       commandants in the field being in a position to enforce such       requisitions. But such claims will have to be established to       the satisfaction of a Judge or Judicial Commission appointed by       the Government to investigate and assess them, and if exceeding       in the aggregate L1,000,000, they will be liable to reduction       _pro rata_.         \"I also beg to inform your Honour that the new Government will       take into immediate consideration the possibility of assisting       by loan the occupants of farms who will take the oath of       allegiance to repair any injury sustained by destruction of       buildings or loss of stock during the war, and that no special       war tax will be imposed on farmers to defray the expense of the       war.         \"When burghers require the protection of firearms such will be       allowed to them by licence and on due registration, provided       they take the oath of allegiance. Licences also will be issued       for sporting rifles, guns, &c., but military firearms will only       be allowed for means of protection.         \"As regards the extension of the franchise to Kaffirs in the       Transvaal and Orange River Colony, it is not the intention of       his Majesty's Government to give such franchise before       representative government is granted to these Colonies, and if       then given, it will be so limited as to secure the just       predominance of the white races. The legal position of coloured       persons will, however, be similar to that which they hold in       Cape Colony.         \"In conclusion, I must inform your Honour that if the terms now       offered are not accepted after a reasonable delay for       consideration, they must be regarded as cancelled.\"    To this Botha replied:--         \"I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Excellency's       letter stating what steps your Excellency's Government is       prepared to take in the event of a general and total cessation       of hostilities. I have advised my Government of your       Excellency's said letter; but, after the mutual exchange of       views at our interview at Middelburg on 28th February last, it       will certainly not surprise your Excellency to know that I do       not feel disposed to recommend that the terms of the said       letter shall have the earnest consideration of my Government. I       may add, also, that my Government and my chief officers here       entirely agree with my views.\"    Botha's private opinions are to be found in an address to the  burghers, which was subsequently discovered among papers captured by  Sir Bindon Blood at Roos Senekal. He said:--         \"The spirit of Lord Kitchener's letter makes it very plain to       you all that the British Government desires nothing else but       the destruction of our Afrikander people, and acceptance of the       terms contained therein is absolutely out of the question.       Virtually, the letter contains nothing more, but rather less,       than what the British Government will be obliged to do should       our cause go wrong. Notice that they will give us a Legislative       Council consisting of their own officials and members nominated       by themselves. The voice of the people is thus totally       unrecognised.... The more we are aggrieved by the enemy the       more steadfastly we ought to stand for our good and lawful       rights. Let us, as Daniel in the lions' den, place our trust in       God alone, for in His time and in His way He will certainly       give us deliverance.\"    On April 19th Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the High Commissioner as  follows:--         \"As our terms have been refused by Botha, they are of course       withdrawn, and his Majesty's Government do not think it       advisable that you or Kitchener should reopen negotiations.       Should Botha or other leaders make any further suggestions of       their own accord Kitchener will, of course, forward them to us       without expressing any opinion upon them to those who make"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4715"],[0,"An African Millionaire: Episodes in the Life of the Illustrious Colonel Clay (#12)"],[1,"us understand. We were impressed by the singular urbanity  and benignity of the nobleman's demeanour towards this sullen  dependant. He evidently explained to the fellow what sort of  people we were, and remonstrated with him in a very gentle way for  interrupting us. The steward understood, and clearly regretted his  insolent air; for after a few sentences he went out, and as he did  so he bowed and made protestations of polite regard in his own  language. The Count turned to us and smiled. \"Our people,\" he said,  \"are like your own Scotch peasants--kind-hearted, picturesque, free,  musical, poetic, but wanting, helas, in polish to strangers.\" He  was certainly an exception, if he described them aright; for he made  us feel at home from the moment we entered.    He named his price in frank terms. His lawyers at Meran held the  needful documents, and would arrange the negotiations in detail with  us. It was a stiff sum, I must say--an extremely stiff sum; but no  doubt he was charging us a fancy price for a fancy castle. \"He will  come down in time,\" Charles said. \"The sum first named in all these  transactions is invariably a feeler. They know I'm a millionaire;  and people always imagine millionaires are positively made of  money.\"    I may add that people always imagine it must be easier to squeeze  money out of millionaires than out of other people--which is the  reverse of the truth, or how could they ever have amassed their  millions? Instead of oozing gold as a tree oozes gum, they mop it  up like blotting-paper, and seldom give it out again.    We drove back from this first interview none the less very well  satisfied. The price was too high; but preliminaries were arranged,  and for the rest, the Count desired us to discuss all details with  his lawyers in the chief street, Unter den Lauben. We inquired about  these lawyers, and found they were most respectable and respected  men; they had done the family business on either side for seven  generations.    They showed us plans and title-deeds. Everything quite en regle.  Till we came to the price there was no hitch of any sort.    As to price, however, the lawyers were obdurate. They stuck out for  the Count's first sum to the uttermost florin. It was a very big  estimate. We talked and shilly-shallied till Sir Charles grew angry.  He lost his temper at last.    \"They know I'm a millionaire, Sey,\" he said, \"and they're playing  the old game of trying to diddle me. But I won't be diddled. Except  Colonel Clay, no man has ever yet succeeded in bleeding me. And  shall I let myself be bled as if I were a chamois among these  innocent mountains? Perish the thought!\" Then he reflected a little  in silence. \"Sey,\" he mused on, at last, \"the question is, _are_  they innocent? Do you know, I begin to believe there is no such  thing left as pristine innocence anywhere. This Tyrolese Count knows  the value of a pound as distinctly as if he hung out in Capel Court  or Kimberley.\"    Things dragged on in this way, inconclusively, for a week or two.  _We_ bid down; the lawyers stuck to it. Sir Charles grew half sick  of the whole silly business. For my own part, I felt sure if the  high well-born Count didn't quicken his pace, my respected relative  would shortly have had enough of the Tyrol altogether, and be proof  against the most lovely of crag-crowning castles. But the Count  didn't see it. He came to call on us at our hotel--a rare honour for  a stranger with these haughty and exclusive Tyrolese nobles--and  even entered unannounced in the most friendly manner. But when it  came to L. s. d., he was absolute adamant. Not one kreutzer would  he abate from his original proposal.    \"You misunderstand,\" he said, with pride. \"We Tyrolese gentlemen are  not shopkeepers or merchants. We do not higgle. If we say a thing we  stick to it. Were you an Austrian, I should feel insulted by your  ill-advised attempt to beat down my price. But as you belong to a  great commercial nation--\" he broke off with a snort and shrugged  his shoulders compassionately.    We saw him several times driving in and out of the schloss, and  every time he waved his hand at us gracefully. But when we tried to  bargain, it was always the same thing: he retired behind the shelter  of his Tyrolese nobility. We might take it or leave it. 'Twas still  Schloss Lebenstein.    The lawyers were as bad. We tried all we knew, and got no forrarder.    At last Charles gave up the attempt in disgust. He was tiring, as I  expected. \"It's the prettiest place I ever saw in my life,\" he said;  \"but, hang it all, Sey, I _won't_ be imposed upon.\"    So he made up his mind, it being now December, to return to London.  We met the Count next day, and stopped his carriage, and told him  so. Charles thought this would have the immediate effect of bringing  the man to reason. But he only lifted his hat, with the blackcock's  feather, and smiled a bland smile. \"The Archduke Karl is inquiring  about it,\" he answered, and drove on without parley.    Charles used some strong words, which I will not transcribe (I am a  family man), and returned to England.    For the next two months we heard little from Amelia save her regret  that the Count wouldn't sell us Schloss Lebenstein. Its pinnacles  had fairly pierced her heart. Strange to say, she was absolutely  infatuated about the castle. She rather wanted the place while  she was there, and thought she could get it; now she thought  she couldn't, her soul (if she has one) was wildly set upon it.  Moreover, Cesarine further inflamed her desire by gently hinting  a fact which she had picked up at the courier's table d'hote at  the hotel--that the Count had been far from anxious to sell his  ancestral and historical estate to a South African diamond king.  He thought the honour of the family demanded, at least, that he  should secure a wealthy buyer of good ancient lineage.    One morning in February, however, Amelia returned from the Row all  smiles and tremors. (She had been ordered horse-exercise to correct  the increasing excessiveness of her figure.)    \"Who do you think I saw riding in the Park?\" she inquired. \"Why,  the Count of Lebenstein.\"    \"No!\" Charles exclaimed, incredulous.    \"Yes,\" Amelia answered.    \"Must be mistaken,\" Charles cried.    But Amelia stuck to it. More than that, she sent out emissaries to  inquire diligently from the London lawyers, whose name had been  mentioned to us by the ancestral firm in Unter den Lauben as  their English agents, as to the whereabouts of our friend; and  her emissaries learned in effect that the Count was in town and  stopping at Morley's.    \"I see through it,\" Charles exclaimed. \"He finds he's made a  mistake; and now he's come over here to reopen negotiations.\"    I was all for waiting prudently till the Count made the first move.  \"Don't let him see your eagerness,\" I said. But Amelia's ardour  could not now be restrained. She insisted that Charles should  call on the Graf as a mere return of his politeness in the Tyrol.    He was as charming as ever. He talked to us with delight about the  quaintness of London. He would be ravished to dine next evening with  Sir Charles. He desired his respectful salutations meanwhile to  Miladi Vandrift and Madame Ventvorth.    He dined with us, almost en famille. Amelia's cook did wonders. In  the billiard-room, about midnight, Charles reopened the subject.  The Count was really touched. It pleased him that still, amid the  distractions of the City of Five Million Souls, we should remember  with affection his beloved Lebenstein.    \"Come to my lawyers,\" he said, \"to-morrow, and I will talk it all  over with you.\"    We went--a most respectable firm in Southampton Row; old family  solicitors. They had done business for years for the late Count, who  had inherited from his grandmother estates in Ireland; and they were  glad to be honoured with the confidence of his successor. Glad, too,  to make the acquaintance of a prince of finance like Sir Charles  Vandrift. Anxious (rubbing their hands) to arrange matters  satisfactorily all round for everybody. (Two capital families with  which to be mixed up, you see.)    Sir Charles named a price, and referred them to his solicitors.  The Count named a higher, but still a little come-down, and left  the matter to be settled between the lawyers. He was a soldier and  a gentleman, he said, with a Tyrolese toss of his high-born head;  he would abandon details to men of business.    As I was really anxious to oblige Amelia, I met the Count  accidentally next day on the steps of Morley's. (Accidentally,  that is to say, so far as he was concerned, though I had been  hanging about in Trafalgar Square for half an hour to see him.)  I explained, in guarded terms, that I had a great deal of influence  in my way with Sir Charles; and that a word from me-- I broke  off. He stared at me blankly.    \"Commission?\" he inquired, at last, with a queer little smile.    \"Well, not exactly commission,\" I answered, wincing. \"Still, a  friendly word, you know. One good turn deserves another.\"    He looked at me from head to foot with a curious scrutiny. For one  moment I feared the Tyrolese nobleman in him was going to raise its  foot and take active measures. But the next, I saw that Sir Charles  was right after all, and that pristine innocence has removed from  this planet to other quarters.    He named his lowest price. \"M. Ventvorth,\" he said, \"I am a Tyrolese  seigneur; I do not dabble, myself, in commissions and percentages.  But if your influence with Sir Charles--we understand each other, do  we not?--as between gentlemen--a little friendly present--no money,  of course--but the equivalent of say 5 per cent in jewellery, on  whatever sum above his bid to-day you induce him to  offer--eh?--c'est convenu?\"    \"Ten per cent is more usual,\" I murmured.    He was the Austrian hussar again. \"Five, monsieur--or nothing!\"    I bowed and withdrew. \"Well, five"]]]
