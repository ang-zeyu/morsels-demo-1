Hard upon the thought came the memory of  his boy, and of the telephone message which the episodes of the night  had prevented him from sending.    He remembered, too, something which his fearless nature had prompted him  to forget: he remembered how, just as he had arisen from beside the body  of the murdered man, oblique eyes had regarded him swiftly out of the  fog. He had lashed out with a boxer's instinct, but his knuckles had  encountered nothing but empty air. No sound had come to tell him that  the thing had not been an illusion. Only, once again, as he groped his  way through the shuttered streets of Chinatown and the silence of  the yellow mist, something had prompted him to turn; and again he had  detected the glint of oblique eyes, and faintly had discerned the form  of one who followed him.    Kerry chewed viciously, then:    \"I think I'll 'phone the wife,\" he said abruptly. \"She'll be expecting  me.\"    Almost before he had finished speaking the 'phone bell rang, and a few  moments later:    \"Someone to speak to you, Chief Inspector,\" cried the officer in charge.    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Kerry, his fierce eyes lighting up. \"That will be from  home.\"    \"I don't think so,\" was the reply. \"But see who it is.\"    \"Hello!\" he called.    He was answered by an unfamiliar voice, a voice which had a queer,  guttural intonation. It was the sort of voice he had learned to loathe.    \"Is that Chief Inspector Kerry?\"    \"Yes,\" he snapped.    \"May I take it that what I have to say will be treated in confidence?\"    \"Certainly not.\"    \"Think again, Chief Inspector,\" the voice continued. \"You are a man  within sight of the ambition of years, and although you may be unaware  of the fact, you stand upon the edge of a disaster. I appreciate your  sense of duty and respect it. But there are times when diplomacy is a  more potent weapon than force.\"    Kerry, listening, became aware that the speaker was a man of cultured  intellect. He wondered greatly, but:    \"My time is valuable,\" he said rapidly. \"Come to the point. What do you  want and who are you?\"    \"One moment, Chief Inspector. An opportunity to make your fortune  without interfering with your career has come in your way. You have  obtained possession of what you believe to be a clue to a murder.\"    The voice ceased, and Kerry remaining silent, immediately continued:    \"Knowing your personal character, I doubt if you have communicated the  fact of your possessing this evidence to anyone else. I suggest, in your  own interests, that before doing so you interview me.\"    Kerry thought rapidly, and then:    \"I don't say you're right,\" he rapped back. \"But if I come to see you,  I shall leave a sealed statement in possession of the officer in charge  here.\"    \"To this I have no objection,\" the guttural voice replied, \"but I beg of  you to bring the evidence with you.\"    \"I'm not to be bought,\" warned Kerry. \"Don't think it and don't suggest  it, or when I get to you I'll break you in half.\"    His red moustache positively bristled, and he clutched the receiver so  tightly that it quivered against his ear.    \"You mistake me,\" replied the speaker. \"My name is Zani Chada. You know  where I live. I shall not detain you more than five minutes if you will  do me the honour of calling upon me.\"    Kerry chewed furiously for ten momentous seconds, then:    \"I'll come!\" he said.    He replaced the receiver on the hook, and, walking across to the charge  desk, took an official form and a pen. On the back of the form he  scribbled rapidly, watched with curiosity by the officer in charge.    \"Give me an envelope,\" he directed.    An envelope was found and handed to him. He placed the paper in the  envelope, gummed down the lapel, and addressed it in large, bold writing  to the Assistant Commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Department,  who was his chief. Finally:    \"I'm going out,\" he explained.    \"After what I've said?\"    \"After what you've said. I'm going out. If I don't come back or don't  telephone within the next hour, you will know what to do with this.\"    The Limehouse official stared perplexedly.    \"But meanwhile,\" he protested, \"what steps am I to take about the  murder? Durham will be back with the body at any moment now, and you say  you've got a clue to the murderer.\"    \"I have,\" said Kerry, \"but I'm going to get definite evidence. Do  nothing until you hear from me.\"    \"Very good,\" answered the other, and Kerry, tucking his malacca cane  under his arm, strode out into the fog.    His knowledge of the Limehouse area was extensive and peculiar, so that  twenty minutes later, having made only one mistake in the darkness, he  was pressing an electric bell set beside a door which alone broke the  expanse of a long and dreary brick wall, lining a street which neither  by day nor night would have seemed inviting to the casual visitor.    The door was opened by a Chinaman wearing national dress, revealing  a small, square lobby, warmly lighted and furnished Orientally. Kerry  stepped in briskly.    \"I want to see Mr. Zani Chada. Tell him I am here. Chief Inspector Kerry  is my name.\"    The Chinaman bowed, crossed the lobby, and, drawing some curtains aside,  walked up four carpeted stairs and disappeared into a short passage  revealed by the raising of the tapestry. As he did so Kerry stared about  him curiously.    He had never before entered the mystery house of Zani Chada, nor had he  personally encountered the Eurasian, reputed to be a millionaire,  but who chose, for some obscure reason, to make his abode in this old  rambling building, once a country mansion, which to-day was closely  invested by dockland and the narrow alleys of Chinatown. It was  curiously still in the lobby, and, as he determined, curiously Eastern.  He was conscious of a sense of exhilaration. That Zani Chada controlled  powerful influences, he knew well. But, reviewing the precautions  which he had taken, Kerry determined that the trump card was in his  possession.    The Chinese servant descended the stairs again and intimated that the  visitor should follow him. Kerry, carrying his hat and cane, mounted the  stairs, walked along the carpeted passage, and was ushered into a queer,  low room furnished as a library.    It was lined with shelves containing strange-looking books, none of  which appeared to be English. Upon the top of the shelves were grotesque  figures of gods, pieces of Chinese pottery and other Oriental ornaments.  Arms there were in the room, and rich carpets, carven furniture, and an  air of luxury peculiarly exotic. Furthermore, he detected a faint smell  of opium from which fact he divined that Zani Chada was addicted to the  national vice of China.    Seated before a long narrow table was the notorious Eurasian. The table  contained a number of strange and unfamiliar objects, as well as a small  rack of books. An opium pipe rested in a porcelain bowl.    Zani Chada, wearing a blue robe, sat in a cushioned chair, staring  toward the Chief Inspector. With one slender yellow hand he brushed his  untidy gray hair. His long magnetic eyes were half closed.    \"Good evening, Chief Inspector Kerry,\" he said. \"Won't you be seated?\"    \"Thanks, I'm not staying. I can hear what you've got to say standing.\"    The long eyes grew a little more narrow--the only change of expression  that Zani Chada allowed himself.    \"As you wish. I have no occasion to detain you long.\"    In that queer, perfumed room, with the suggestion of something sinister  underlying its exotic luxury, arose a kind of astral clash as the  powerful personality of the Eurasian came in contact with that of Kerry.  In a sense it was a contest of rapier and battle-axe; an insidious but  powerful will enlisted against the bulldog force of the Chief Inspector.    Still through half-closed eyes Zani Chada watched his visitor, who  stood, feet apart and chin thrust forward aggressively, staring with  wide open, fierce blue eyes at the other.    \"I'm going to say one thing,\" declared Kerry, snapping out the words  in a manner little short of ferocious. He laid his hat and cane upon a  chair and took a step in the direction of the narrow, laden table. \"Make  me any kind of offer to buy back the evidence you think I've got, and  I'll bash your face as flat as a frying-pan.\"    The yellow hands of Zani Chada clutched the metal knobs which ornamented  the arms of the chair in which he was seated. The long eyes now  presented the appearance of being entirely closed; otherwise he remained  immovable.    Following a short, portentous silence:    \"How grossly you misunderstood me, Chief Inspector,\" Chada replied,  speaking very softly. \"You are shortly to be promoted to a post which no  one is better fitted to occupy. You enjoy great domestic happiness, and  you possess a son in whom you repose great hopes. In this respect Chief  Inspector, I resemble you.\"    Kerry's nostrils were widely dilated, but he did not speak.    \"You see,\" continued the Eurasian, \"I know many things about you.  Indeed, I have watched your career with interest. Now, to be brief, a  great scandal may be averted and a woman's reputation preserved if you  and I, as men of the world, can succeed in understanding one another.\"    \"I don't want to understand you,\" said Kerry bluntly. \"But you've said  enough already to justify me in blowing this whistle.\" He drew a police  whistle from his overcoat pocket. \"This house is being watched.\"    \"I am aware of the fact,\" murmured Zani Chada.    \"There are two people in it I want for two different reasons. If you say  much more there may be three.\"    Chada raised his hand slowly.    \"Put back your whistle, Chief Inspector.\"    There was a curious restraint in the Eurasian's manner which Kerry  distrusted, but for which at the time he was at a loss to account.
