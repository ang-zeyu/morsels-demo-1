[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#12)"],[1,"my thoughts that I, too, must have been gentler than  usual, and the morning passed like a honeymoon, till I went across to  dinner.    I was just sitting down when I remembered that I had left my watch in  my waistcoat behind the counter, and started to go back for it.  But at  the door I stopped short.  For two horsemen had drawn up before the  store.    One was a native with what I took to be saddle-bags; the other was a  small slim man with a sun helmet, who was slowly dismounting.  Something in the cut of his jib struck me as familiar.  I slipped into  the empty schoolroom and stared hard. Then, as he half-turned in  handing his bridle to the Kaffir, I got a sight of his face.  It was my  former shipmate, Henriques. He said something to his companion, and  entered the store.    You may imagine that my curiosity ran to fever-heat.  My first impulse  was to march over for my waistcoat, and make a third with Japp at the  interview.  Happily I reflected in time that Henriques knew my face,  for I had grown no beard, having a great dislike to needless hair.  If  he was one of the villains in the drama, he would mark me down for his  vengeance once he knew I was here, whereas at present he had probably  forgotten all about me.  Besides, if I walked in boldly I would get no  news.  If Japp and he had a secret, they would not blab it in my  presence.    My next idea was to slip in by the back to the room I had once lived  in.  But how was I to cross the road?  It ran white and dry some  distance each way in full view of the Kaffir with the horses.  Further,  the store stood on a bare patch, and it would be a hard job to get in  by the back, assuming, as I believed, that the neighbourhood was thick  with spies.    The upshot was that I got my glasses and turned them on the store.  The  door was open, and so was the window.  In the gloom of the interior I  made out Henriques' legs.  He was standing by the counter, and  apparently talking to Japp.  He moved to shut the door, and came back  inside my focus opposite the window.  There he stayed for maybe ten  minutes, while I hugged my impatience.  I would have given a hundred  pounds to be snug in my old room with Japp thinking me out of the store.    Suddenly the legs twitched up, and his boots appeared above the  counter.  Japp had invited him to his bedroom, and the game was now to  be played beyond my ken.  This was more than I could stand, so I stole  out at the back door and took to the thickest bush on the hillside.  My  notion was to cross the road half a mile down, when it had dropped into  the defile of the stream, and then to come swiftly up the edge of the  water so as to effect a back entrance into the store.    As fast as I dared I tore through the bush, and in about a quarter of  an hour had reached the point I was making for. Then I bore down to the  road, and was in the scrub about ten yards off it, when the clatter of  horses pulled me up again. Peeping out I saw that it was my friend and  his Kaffir follower, who were riding at a very good pace for the  plains.  Toilfully and crossly I returned on my tracks to my  long-delayed dinner. Whatever the purport of their talk, Japp and the  Portuguese had not taken long over it.    In the store that afternoon I said casually to Japp that I had noticed  visitors at the door during my dinner hour.  The old man looked me  frankly enough in the face.  'Yes, it was Mr Hendricks,' he said, and  explained that the man was a Portuguese trader from Delagoa way, who  had a lot of Kaffir stores east of the Lebombo Hills.  I asked his  business, and was told that he always gave Japp a call in when he was  passing.    'Do you take every man that calls into your bedroom, and shut the  door?' I asked.    Japp lost colour and his lip trembled.  'I swear to God, Mr Crawfurd,  I've been doing nothing wrong.  I've kept the promise I gave you like  an oath to my mother.  I see you suspect me, and maybe you've cause,  but I'll be quite honest with you.  I have dealt in diamonds before  this with Hendricks. But to-day, when he asked me, I told him that that  business was off.  I only took him to my room to give him a drink.  He  likes brandy, and there's no supply in the shop.'    I distrusted Japp wholeheartedly enough, but I was convinced that in  this case he spoke the truth. 'Had the man any news?' I asked.    'He had and he hadn't,' said Japp.  'He was always a sullen beggar, and  never spoke much.  But he said one queer thing. He asked me if I was  going to retire, and when I told him \"yes,\" he said I had put it off  rather long.  I told him I was as healthy as I ever was, and he laughed  in his dirty Portugoose way.  \"Yes, Mr Japp,\" he says, \"but the country  is not so healthy.\" I wonder what the chap meant.  He'll be dead of  blackwater before many months, to judge by his eyes.'    This talk satisfied me about Japp, who was clearly in desperate fear of  offending me, and disinclined to return for the present to his old  ways.  But I think the rest of the afternoon was the most wretched time  in my existence.  It was as plain as daylight that we were in for some  grave trouble, trouble to which I believed that I alone held any kind  of clue.  I had a pile of evidence--the visit of Henriques was the last  bit--which pointed to some great secret approaching its disclosure. I  thought that that disclosure meant blood and ruin.  But I knew nothing  definite.  If the commander of a British army had come to me then and  there and offered help, I could have done nothing, only asked him to  wait like me.  The peril, whatever it was, did not threaten me only,  though I and Wardlaw and Japp might be the first to suffer; but I had a  terrible feeling that I alone could do something to ward it off, and  just what that something was I could not tell.  I was horribly afraid,  not only of unknown death, but of my impotence to play any manly part.  I was alone, knowing too much and yet too little, and there was no  chance of help under the broad sky.  I cursed myself for not writing to  Aitken at Lourenco Marques weeks before.  He had promised to come up,  and he was the kind of man who kept his word.    In the late afternoon I dragged Wardlaw out for a walk.  In his  presence I had to keep up a forced cheerfulness, and I believe the  pretence did me good.  We took a path up the Berg among groves of  stinkwood and essenwood, where a failing stream made an easy route.  It  may have been fancy, but it seemed to me that the wood was emptier and  that we were followed less closely.  I remember it was a lovely  evening, and in the clear fragrant gloaming every foreland of the Berg  stood out like a great ship above the dark green sea of the bush. When  we reached the edge of the plateau we saw the sun sinking between two  far blue peaks in Makapan's country, and away to the south the great  roll of the high veld.  I longed miserably for the places where white  men were thronged together in dorps and cities. As we gazed a curious  sound struck our ears.  It seemed to begin far up in the north--a low  roll like the combing of breakers on the sand.  Then it grew louder and  travelled nearer--a roll, with sudden spasms of harsher sound in it;  reminding me of the churning in one of the pot-holes of Kirkcaple  cliffs.  Presently it grew softer again as the sound passed south, but  new notes were always emerging.  The echo came sometimes, as it were,  from stark rock, and sometimes from the deep gloom of the forests.  I  have never heard an eerier sound.  Neither natural nor human it seemed,  but the voice of that world between which is hid from man's sight and  hearing.    Mr Wardlaw clutched my arm, and in that moment I guessed the  explanation.  The native drums were beating, passing some message from  the far north down the line of the Berg, where the locations were  thickest, to the great black population of the south.    'But that means war,' Mr Wardlaw cried.    'It means nothing of the kind,' I said shortly.  'It's their way of  sending news.  It's as likely to be some change in the weather or an  outbreak of cattle disease.'    When we got home I found Japp with a face like grey paper. 'Did you  hear the drums?'he asked.    'Yes,' I said shortly.  'What about them?'    'God forgive you for an ignorant Britisher,' he almost shouted.  'You  may hear drums any night, but a drumming like that I only once heard  before.  It was in '79 in the 'Zeti valley. Do you know what happened  next day?  Cetewayo's impis came over the hills, and in an hour there  wasn't a living white soul in the glen.  Two men escaped, and one of  them was called Peter Japp.'    'We are in God's hands then, and must wait on His will,' I said  solemnly.    There was no more sleep for Wardlaw and myself that night. We made the  best barricade we could of the windows, loaded all our weapons, and  trusted to Colin to give us early news. Before supper I went over to  get Japp to join us, but found that that worthy had sought help from  his old protector, the bottle, and was already sound asleep with both  door and window open.    I had made up my mind that death was certain, and yet my heart belied  my conviction, and I could not feel the appropriate mood.  If anything  I was more cheerful since I had heard the drums.  It was clearly now  beyond the power of me or any man to stop the march of events.  My  thoughts ran on a native rising, and I kept telling myself how little  that was probable. Where were the arms, the leader, the discipline?  At  any rate such arguments put me to sleep before dawn, and I wakened at  eight to find that nothing had happened.  The clear morning sunlight,  as of old, made Blaauwildebeestefontein the place of a dream.  Zeeta  brought in my cup of coffee as if this day were just like all others,  my pipe tasted as sweet, the fresh air from the Berg blew as fragrantly  on my brow.  I went over to the store in reasonably good spirits,  leaving"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6112"],[0,"Nature and Human Nature (#12)"],[1," break a trace, I know.\"    Cutler and I had been talking horse when he came in; a sort of talk I  rather like myself, for I consait I know a considerable some about it,  and ain't above getting a wrinkle from others when I can. \"Well,\" sais  I, \"Capting, we was a talking about horses when the doctor came in.\"    \"Captain,\" said the doctor, turning round to Cutler, \"Captain, excuse  me, Sir, how did you reach the shore?\"    \"In the boat,\" said Cutler.    \"Ah!\" said the other with animation, \"was all the crew saved?\"    \"We were in no danger whatever, Sir; my vessel is at anchor in the  harbour.\"    \"Ah,\" replied the doctor, \"that's fortunate, very fortunate;\" and  turned again to the fire, with an air, as I thought, of  disappointment, as if he had expected a tale of horror to excite him.    \"'Well, Mr Slick,\" said the captain, \"let us hear your story about the  horse that had a thousand virtues and only one vice.\"    At the sound of my name, the stranger gave a sudden start and gazed  steadily at me, his eyebrows raised in the extraordinary manner that I  have described, something like the festoon of a curtain, and a smile  playing on his face as if expecting a joke and ready to enter into it,  and enjoy it. All this I observed out of the corner of my eye, without  appearing to regard him or notice his scrutiny.    Sais I, \"when I had my tea-store in Boston, I owned the fastest  trotting horse in the United States; he was a sneezer, I tell you. I  called him Mandarin--a very appropriate name, you see, for my  business. It was very important for me to attract attention. Indeed,  you must do it, you know, in our great cities, or you are run right  over, and crushed by engines of more power. Whose horse is that? Mr  Slick's the great tea-merchant. That's the great Mandarin, the fastest  beast in all creation--refused five thousand dollars for him, and so  on. Every wrapper I had for my tea had a print of him on it. It was  action and reaction, you see. Well, this horse had a very serious  fault that diminished his value in my eyes down to a hundred dollars,  as far as use and comfort went. Nothing in the world could ever induce  him to cross a bridge. He had fallen through one when he was a colt,  and got so all-fired frightened he never forgot it afterwards. He  would stop, rear, run back, plunge, and finally kick if you punished  him too hard, and smash your waggon to pieces, but cross he never  would. Nobody knew this but me, and of course I warn't such a fool as  to blow upon my own beast. At last I grew tired of him and determined  to sell him; but as I am a man that always adheres to the truth in my  horse trades, the difficulty was, how to sell him and not lose by him.  Well, I had to go to Charleston, South Carolina, on business, and I  took the chance to get rid of Mr Mandarin, and advertised him for  sale. I worded the notice this way:    \"'A gentleman, being desirous of quitting Boston on urgent business  for a time, will dispose of a first-rate horse, that he is obliged to  leave behind him. None need apply but those willing to give a long  price. The animal may be seen at Deacon Seth's livery stables.'    \"Well, it was soon known that Mandarin was for sale, and several  persons came to know the lowest figure. 'Four thousand dollars,' said  I, 'and if I didn't want to leave Boston in a hurry, six would be the  price.'    \"At last young Mr Parker, the banker's son from Bethany, called and  said he wouldn't stand for the price, seeing that a hundred dollars  was no more than a cord of wood in his pocket (good gracious, how the  doctor laughed at that phrase!), but would like to inquire a little  about the critter, confidential like.    \"'I will answer any questions you ask,' I said, candidly.    \"'Is he sound?'    \"'Sound as a new hackmetack trenail. Drive it all day, and you can't  broom it one mite or morsel.'    \"'Good in harness?'    \"'Excellent.'    \"'Can he do his mile in two fifteen?'    \"'He has done it.'    \"'Now between man and man,' sais he, 'what is your reason for selling  the horse, Slick? for you are not so soft as to be tempted by price  out of a first chop article like that.'    \"'Well, candidly,' sais I, 'for I am like a cow's tail, straight up  and down in my dealing, and ambition the clean thing.'\"    \"Straight up and down!\" said the doctor aloud to himself; 'straight up  and down like a cow's tail.' Oh Jupiter! what a simile! and yet it  ain't bad, for one end is sure to be in the dirt. A man may be the  straight thing, that is right up and down, like a cow's tail, but hang  me if he can be the clean thing anyhow he can fix it.\" And he  stretched out his feet to their full length, put his hands in his  trowsers pocket, held down his head, and clucked like a hen that is  calling her chickens. I vow I could hardly help bustin' out a larfin  myself, for it warn't a slow remark of hisn, and showed fun; in fact,  I was sure at first he was a droll boy.    \"Well, as I was a sayin', sais I to Mr Parker, 'Candidly, now, my only  reason for partin' with that are horse is, that I want to go away in a  hurry out of Boston clear down to Charleston, South Carolina, and as I  can't take him with me, I prefer to sell him.\"    \"'Well,' sais he, 'the beast is mine, and here is a cheque for your  money.'    \"'Well,' sais I, 'Parker, take care of him, for you have got a  fust-rate critter. He is all sorts of a horse, and one that is all I  have told you, and more too, and no mistake.'    \"Every man that buys a new horse, in a general way, is in a great  hurry to try him. There is sumthin' very takin' in a new thing. A new  watch, a new coat, no, I reckon it's best to except a new spic and  span coat (for it's too glossy, and it don't set easy, till it's worn  awhile, and perhaps I might say a new saddle, for it looks as if you  warn't used to ridin', except when you went to Meetin' of a Sabbaday,  and kept it covered all the week, as a gall does her bonnet, to save  it from the flies); but a new waggon, a new sleigh, a new house, and  above all a new wife, has great attractions. Still you get tired of  them all in a short while; you soon guess the hour instead of pullin'  out the watch for everlastin'. The waggon loses its novelty, and so  does the sleigh, and the house is surpassed next month by a larger and  finer one, and as you can't carry it about to show folks, you soon  find it is too expensive to invite them to come and admire it. But the  wife; oh, Lord! In a general way, there ain't more difference between  a grub and a butterfly, than between a sweetheart and wife. Yet the  grub and the butterfly is the same thing, only, differently rigged  out, and so is the sweetheart and wife. Both critters crawl about the  house, and ain't very attractive to look at, and both turn out so fine  and so painted when they go abroad, you don't scarcely know them agin.  Both, too, when they get out of doors, seem to have no other airthly  object but to show themselves. They don't go straight there and back  again, as if there was an end in view, but they first flaunt to the  right, and then to the left, and then everywhere in general, and yet  nowhere in particular. To be seen and admired is the object of both.  They are all finery, and that is so in their way they can neither sit,  walk, nor stand conveniently in it. They are never happy, but when on  the wing.\"    \"Oh, Lord!\" said the doctor to himself, who seemed to think aloud; \"I  wonder if that is a picture or a caricature?\"    Thinks I, \"old boy, you are sold. I said that a purpose to find you  out, for I am too fond of feminine gender to make fun of them. You are  a single man. If you was married, I guess you wouldn't ask that are  question.\"    But I went on. \"Now a horse is different, you never get tired of a  good one. He don't fizzle out1 like the rest. You like him better and  better every day. He seems a part of yourself; he is your better half,  your 'halter hego' as I heard a cockney once call his fancy gall.      1 Fizzle out. To prove a failure.      \"This bein' the case, as I was a sayin', as soon as a man gits a new  one, he wants to try him. So Parker puts Mandarin into harness, and  drives away like wink for Salem, but when he came to the bridge, the  old coon stopt, put forward his ears, snorted, champed his bit, and  stamped his fore feet. First Parker coaxed him, but that did no good,  and then he gave him the whip, and he reared straight up on eend, and  nearly fell over into his waggon. A man that was crossing over at the  time took him by the head to lead him, when he suddenly wheeled half  round, threw him in the mud, and dragged him in the gutter, as he  backed up agin the side walk all standin'. Parker then laid on the  whip, hot and heavy; he gave him a most righteous lickin'. Mandarin  returned blow for blow, until he kicked the waggon all to flinders.    \"Well, I must say that for his new owner, he was a plucky fellow, as  well as Mandarin, and warn't agoin' to cave in that way. So he takes  him back to the livery stables, and puts him into another carriage,  and off he starts agin, and thinkin' that the horse had seen or smelt  sumthen at that bridge to scare him, he tries another, when the same  scene was acted over again, only he was throwed out, and had his  clothes nearly tore off. Well, that afternoon, up comes Parker to me,  choking with rage.    \"'Slick,' said he, 'that is the greatest devil of a horse I ever see.  He has dashed two carriages all to shivereens, and nearly tuckard the  innerds out of me and another man. I don't think you have acted  honestly by me.'    \"'Parker,' said I, 'don't you use words that you don't know the  meanin' of, and for goodness gracious sake don't come to me to teach  you manners, I beseech you, for I am a rough schoolmaster, I tell you.  I answered every question you asked me, candidly, fair and square, and  above board.'    \"'Didn't you know,' said he, 'that no living man could"]]]
