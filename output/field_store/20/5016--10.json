And if the said      river be likely to be of any utility, take possession of it on      behalf of the Hudson's Bay Company, by cutting your {xxxix} name      on some of the rocks, as also the date of the year, month,      &c.[L]        \"When you attempt to trace this or any other river, be careful      that the Indians are furnished with a sufficient number of      canoes for trying the depth of water, the strength of the      current, &c. If by any unforeseen accident or disaster you      should not be able to reach the before-mentioned river, it is      earnestly recommended to you, if possible, to know the event of      Wager Strait;[M] for it is represented by the last discoverers      to terminate in small rivers and lakes. See how far the woods      are from the navigable parts of it; and whether a settlement      could with any propriety be made there. If this should prove      unworthy of notice, you are to take the same method with Baker's      Lake, which is the head of {xl} Bowden's or Chesterfield's      Inlet;[N] as also with any other rivers you may meet with; and      if likely to be of any utility, you are to take possession of      them, as before mentioned, on the behalf of the Honourable      Hudson's Bay Company. The draft of Bowden's Inlet and Wager      Strait I send with you, that you may have a better idea of those      places, in case of your visiting them.        \"4thly, Another material point which is recommended to you, is      to find out, if you can, either by your own travels, or by      information from the Indians, whether there is a passage through      this continent.[O] It will be {xli} very useful to clear up this      point, if possible, in order to prevent farther doubts from      arising hereafter respecting a passage out of Hudson's Bay[P]      into the Western Ocean, as hath lately been represented by the      American Traveller. The particulars of those remarks you are to      insert in your Journal, to be remitted home to the Company.        \"If you should want any supplies of ammunition, or other      necessaries, dispatch some trusty Indians to the Fort with a      letter, specifying the quantity of each article, and appoint a      place for the said Indians to meet you again.        \"When on your return, if at a proper time of the year, and you      should be near any of the harbours that are frequented by the      brigantine _Charlotte_, or the sloop _Churchill_, during their      voyage to the Northward, and you should chuse to return in one      of them, you are desired to make frequent smokes as you approach      those harbours, and they will endeavour to receive you by making      smokes in answer to yours; and as one thousand seven hundred and      seventy-one will probably be the year in which you will return,      the Masters of those vessels at that period shall have      particular orders on that head.        {xlii} \"It will be pleasing to hear by the first opportunity, in      what latitude and longitude you meet the Leader Matonabbee, and      how far he thinks it is to the Coppermine River, as also the      probable time it may take before you can return. But in case any      thing should prevent the said Leader from joining you, according      to expectation, you are then to procure the best Indians you can      for your guides, and either add to, or diminish, your number, as      you may from time to time think most necessary for the good of      the expedition.        \"So I conclude, wishing you and your companions a continuance of      health, together with a prosperous Journey, and a happy return      in safety. Amen.        \"MOSES NORTON, Governor.        \"Dated at Prince of Wales's Fort, Churchill River, Hudson's      \"Bay, North America, November 6th, 1769.\"    Isbester and Merriman, mentioned in my Instructions, actually  accompanied me during my first short attempt; but the Indians knowing  them to be but common men, used them so indifferently, particularly in  scarce times, that I was under some apprehensions of their being starved  to death, and I thought myself exceedingly happy when I got them safe  back to the Factory. This extraordinary behaviour of the Indians made me  determine not to take any Europeans with me on my two last expeditions.    {xliii} With regard to that part of my Instructions which directs me to  observe the nature of the soil, the productions thereof, &c., it must be  observed, that during the whole time of my absence from the Fort, I was  invariably confined to stony hills and barren plains all the Summer, and  before we approached the woods in the Fall of the year, the ground was  always covered with snow to a considerable depth; so that I never had an  opportunity of seeing any of the small plants and shrubs to the  Westward. But from appearances, and the slow and dwarfy growth of the  woods, &c. (except in the Athapuscow country), there is undoubtedly a  greater scarcity of vegetable productions than at the Company's most  Northern Settlement; and to the Eastward of the woods, on the barren  grounds, whether hills or vallies, there is a total want of herbage  except moss, on which the deer feed; a few dwarf willows creep among the  moss; some wish-a-capucca and a little grass may be seen here and there,  but the latter is scarcely sufficient to serve the geese and other birds  of passage during their short stay in those parts, though they are  always in a state of migration, except when they are breeding and in a  moulting state.    In consequence of my complying with the Company's request, and  undertaking this Journey, it is natural to suppose that every necessary  arrangement was made for the easier keeping of my reckoning, &c., under  the many inconveniences I must be unavoidably obliged to labour in such  an expedition. I drew a Map on a large skin of parchment, that contained  twelve degrees of latitude {xliv} North, and thirty degrees of longitude  West, of Churchill Factory, and sketched all the West coast of the Bay  on it, but left the interior parts blank, to be filled up during my  Journey. I also prepared detached pieces on a much larger scale for  every degree of latitude and longitude contained in the large Map. On  those detached pieces I pricked off my daily courses and distance, and  entered all lakes and rivers, &c., that I met with; endeavouring, by a  strict enquiry of the natives, to find out the communication of one  river with another, as also their connections with the many lakes with  which that country abounds: and when opportunity offered, having  corrected them by observations, I entered them in the general Map. These  and several other necessary preparations, for the easier, readier, and  more correctly keeping my Journal and Chart, were also adopted; but as  to myself, little was required to be done, as the nature of travelling  long journies in those countries will never admit of carrying even the  most common article of clothing; so that the traveller is obliged to  depend on the country he passes through, for that article, as well as  for provisions. Ammunition, useful iron-work, some tobacco, a few  knives, and other indispensable articles, make a sufficient load for any  one to carry that is going a journey likely to last twenty months, or  two years. As that was the case, I only took the shirt and clothes I  then had on, one spare coat, a pair of drawers, and as much cloth as  would make me two or three pair of Indian stockings, which, together  with a blanket for bedding, composed the whole of my stock of clothing.
