All you need do is fumble it and I or one of the  girls will witness it and the bank will clear it and you'll get the  dough.\"    I thought that one over. \"You've got something in your head besides  those big blue eyes,\" I admitted. \"Now if you only have some iodine and  bandages we'll see if I can stave off lock-jaw.\"    She giggled. \"Lock-jaw's the last thing _you'll_ get,\" she said. \"There  ought to be something in the medicine cabinet. Gee,\" she added. \"I  suppose I'll have to get you undressed and dress you in the morning  just like a baby. Ain't that something?\"    \"How about some food?\" I demanded. \"You said something about a steak  back at the office and all you've given me is Scotch and razor-blades.  You get on with your cooking and let me try to fix my hand.\"    I went into the bathroom, located some mercurochrome and a box of band  aids. Once the flow of blood had slacked, I managed to incapacitate  myself sufficiently for the purpose of forging Winnie Tompkins'  signature.    \"Say, Winnie!\" Arthurjean suddenly appeared at the bathroom door, with  an aroma of steak behind her. \"I've just figured out something. If you  aren't Winnie but a ringer from the Aleutians, it's not decent for you  to see me in my pyjamas. We're strangers!\"    \"Oh, keep 'em on till after dinner,\" I said. \"I won't stand on  ceremony. I'm hungry.\"    She laughed. \"You sure can make like Winnie,\" she admired. \"Jesus, the  steak's burning!\"          CHAPTER 9      \"Say, old man, what happened to your hand?\" Graham Wasson, plump, dark  and fortyish, but very clean-cut and with a Dewey dab on his upper  lip, was my questioner. He sat across the glass-topped desk in my Wall  Street Office, while Arthurjean Briggs typed demurely in the adjoining  office.    \"Changing razor-blades,\" I confessed. \"The damn thing slipped and  before I knew it I made a grab for it. Lucky it didn't go deep. Hence  the surgical gauze and the lousy signature. Do you think you can get my  check cleared through the bank or should I write Winnie 'X' Tompkins,  his mark?\"    Wasson chuckled like a well-fed broker. \"We'll get enough witnesses to  your John Hancock to make it legal,\" he promised. \"Now what you've got  to do is to ease old lady Fynch into the trustee's delight and take a  gander at her former investments. I've brought the list with me. As you  know, she insisted that you okay the deal.\"    I glanced at the typed list. \"This stuff looks pretty good to me,  Graham,\" I said. \"Detroit Edison's safe as the Washington Monument,  A.T.&T. is solid, and G.E. ought to do all right with this new  electronic stuff.\"    \"And how!\" My partner agreed. \"Boy! what a windfall! Stuff like that is  scarcer than hen's teeth on the open market. With close to a million  bucks to turn over, we ought to do pretty well on this. Here's what  we're buying for her.\"    Wasson passed me a slip of paper. \"The trustee's delight,\" he said.  \"G-Bonds. You buy 'em, we should worry. No money back for ten years.  Morgenthau's dream-child.\"    The slip was attached to a printed Treasury form. \"See here,\" I  pointed out. \"These damn bonds depreciate 2.2% a year for the first  five years and then start climbing up the ladder again, and they're  non-transferable.\"    \"That's it, Winnie. The trustee's delight,\" Wasson agreed. \"They pay  2-1/2% a year if you hold them but if you try to sell them within  five years the discount means you only get about .03% on your money.  Once a trustee has put you aboard this roller-coaster, he can't  conscientiously advise you to get out.\"    \"Who dreamed up that swindle?\"    \"Oh, a couple of dollar-a-year bankers we sent down to help the  Treasury win the war. It's a natural. It's patriotic to invest in  war-bonds. The yield's conservative as hell and you get it all back if  you wait long enough.\"    \"But what if the old girl dies within the next five years? Won't the  estate be liquidated? How will the heirs feel when they have to take a  loss of $60,000?\"    \"That's their worry, Winnie,\" Wasson pointed out. \"All we have to do is  sign the papers and la Fynch gets about $25,000 a year for the rest of  her life.\"    \"Instead of the $40,000 a year she's getting out of her present  investments now.\"    \"Sure, Winnie. We're not in business for our health. Industrials are  risky and Miss Fynch is awful set on beating Hitler. We take over her  present portfolio and take our chances on the market. If values shift  we're in a position to unload--but fast. She isn't. She only gets to  town twice a year, once between Bar Harbor and Long Island, and then  next time from Palm Beach to Long Island. Come on, Winnie, stick your  fist on these papers and I'll handle the transfers.\"    I shook my head. \"I'd like to think this over,\" I said. \"If I was an  old woman and expected only five or ten more years of life, I'd be  hanged if I'd tie myself down to these financial mustard-plasters. It  sounds okay to be patriotic, but I think I'd stick to the greater risks  and higher yields and get a run for my money. Tell you what, Graham,  you phone and tell her I'd like to have a talk with her before she  makes up her mind.\"    Wasson shoved back his chair and faced me, bristling. \"I'll be damned  if I will. This is a natural and, handled right, is worth $100,000 to  the firm. You talked her into it and now if you're getting cold feet  you can talk her out of it. All I know is that you've gone nuts.\"    \"We aren't so hard up that we have to swindle old ladies.\"    \"Swindle my eye! What's wrong about $25,000 a year guaranteed by your  Uncle Sam?\"    \"Less income tax,\" I reminded him.    \"Oh, sure--that--\"    \"Well, it's about $15,000 a year less than she's getting now. If she  sold out and invested in an annuity she could get about $70,000 a year,  tax-free. No, I don't want to rush her into this.\"    \"Then you've forgotten how we made our pile in the first place,\" my  partner growled. \"Phil Cone and I will have to talk this over. This is  a fine time to go soft on us.\"    I grinned at him. \"Go on, talk it over. If you want out, you're  welcome. I'd rather like you to stick around, as I'm on to something  really big and I don't want the Street to say we fleeced our clients.\"    \"I resent that, Winnie,\" Wasson snapped.    \"What else would you call it? Reinvesting?\"    \"Listen,\" he exploded. \"You built up this business. You invented the  methods. I'm damned if I let you call me a swindler for following your  lead!\" And he stormed out, slamming the door. A moment later, he stuck  his head in again. \"Forget it, Winnie. If you're working on a big  operation, count me in!\"    I studied the list of the Fynch investments again and the more I saw  it the more I wondered how anybody but a fool would fall for the  proposition of putting money in the government bonds for ten years,  when you could clean up outside government.    There was a tap on the edge of my desk. I looked up to see Arthurjean.  \"Mr. Harcourt is back to see you,\" she said. \"I'll get set with the  stenotype. And don't worry about that Fynch dame. I'll give you a  fill-in later. She knows what she's doing.\"    \"Fine!\" I told her. \"Now you show Mr. Harcourt in and make with the  stenotype. Did you finish copying what we said yesterday?\"    Her mouth dropped open and her sweater quivered eloquently. \"Omigawd!  baby! I clean forgot.\"    Mr. Harcourt seemed much more vital and self-possessed than on the  previous afternoon--perhaps because he had obviously had a sleep, a  shower and a hearty breakfast, presumably prefaced by ten minutes of  vigorous push-ups and toe-touching in bathroom calisthenics. At any  rate he looked fit.    \"Morning, Harcourt,\" I said casually. \"Sorry to tell you that Miss  Briggs was home with a bad headache last night and wasn't able to make  that copy of our talk yesterday.\"    G-Men on duty are not supposed to smile without written permission from  their immediate superior but Harcourt must have had an extra helping of  Wheaties for breakfast. \"Call yourself a headache, Mr. Tompkins?\" he  asked. \"That's who our man reported Miss Briggs had last night at 157  East 51st Street, third floor front. Can I get her some aspirin?\"    \"There are no secrets from the Gestapo,\" I observed, \"and I have no  comment to offer except to say next time come on up and have a drink  with us instead of doing the G-Man in a cold and drafty doorway across  the street.\"    The Special Agent gave an entirely unofficial wink at Arthurjean.  \"Oh, hell,\" he remarked. \"What's the use of all this coy stuff? The  Bureau isn't interested in your private life. What I wanted to say, Mr.  Tompkins, is that I reported our talk to my chief and he teletyped my  report down to Washington. We're not going to fool around with Church  Street on this one. The Director's going to take it up direct with  Admiral Ballister at the Navy Department. For my part, I told him I  thought it was all a pipe-dream but like I said the F.B.I. doesn't  believe in dreams that come true.\"    Arthurjean crossed the room and stood behind him, pressing a little  unregenerately against the back of his chair, until Harcourt remarked  conversationally to U. S. Grant in the engraving, \"I'm a married man,  baby, with a wife and kids in Brooklyn.\"    My secretary smiled and gave him a smart tap on the top of his head.  \"You're a good boy, junior,\" she told him, \"and I'm all for you. But  don't you go making trouble for this dumb boss of mine or I'll call on  your wife, personal, and Tell All.\"    Harcourt murmured to the engraving that unconditional surrender was  _his_ name, too, but that Tompkins was making so much trouble for  himself that he was damned if he could see how the F.B.I. could make it  any worse. In any case, he added more directly, he would keep in touch  with me and let me know whether I was wanted up at the Federal Court  House.    \"See here, Harcourt,\" I replied. \"One good turn doesn't make a spring.  This is the screwiest case you'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/520"],[0,"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (#12)"],[1," hazards, and the gray streak in the sky was growing brighter every  moment.    Finally the sledge came to a sudden stop and Claus, who was taken  unawares, tumbled from his seat into a snowdrift.  As he picked himself  up he heard the deer crying:    \"Quick, friend, quick!  Cut away our harness!\"    He drew his knife and rapidly severed the cords, and then he wiped the  moisture from his eyes and looked around him.    The sledge had come to a stop in the Laughing Valley, only a few feet,  he found, from his own door.  In the East the day was breaking, and  turning to the edge of Burzee he saw Glossie and Flossie just  disappearing in the Forest.        9.  \"Santa Claus!\"    Claus thought that none of the children would ever know where the toys  came from which they found by their bedsides when they wakened the  following morning.  But kindly deeds are sure to bring fame, and fame  has many wings to carry its tidings into far lands; so for miles and  miles in every direction people were talking of Claus and his wonderful  gifts to children.  The sweet generousness of his work caused a few  selfish folk to sneer, but even these were forced to admit their  respect for a man so gentle-natured that he loved to devote his life to  pleasing the helpless little ones of his race.    Therefore the inhabitants of every city and village had been eagerly  watching the coming of Claus, and remarkable stories of his beautiful  playthings were told the children to keep them patient and contented.    When, on the morning following the first trip of Claus with his deer,  the little ones came running to their parents with the pretty toys they  had found, and asked from whence they came, they was but one reply to  the question.    \"The good Claus must have been here, my darlings; for his are the only  toys in all the world!\"    \"But how did he get in?\" asked the children.    At this the fathers shook their heads, being themselves unable to  understand how Claus had gained admittance to their homes; but the  mothers, watching the glad faces of their dear ones, whispered that the  good Claus was no mortal man but assuredly a Saint, and they piously  blessed his name for the happiness he had bestowed upon their children.    \"A Saint,\" said one, with bowed head, \"has no need to unlock doors if  it pleases him to enter our homes.\"    And, afterward, when a child was naughty or disobedient, its mother  would say:    \"You must pray to the good Santa Claus for forgiveness.  He does not  like naughty children, and, unless you repent, he will bring you no  more pretty toys.\"    But Santa Claus himself would not have approved this speech.  He  brought toys to the children because they were little and helpless, and  because he loved them.  He knew that the best of children were  sometimes naughty, and that the naughty ones were often good.  It is  the way with children, the world over, and he would not have changed  their natures had he possessed the power to do so.    And that is how our Claus became Santa Claus.  It is possible for any  man, by good deeds, to enshrine himself as a Saint in the hearts of the  people.        10.  Christmas Eve    The day that broke as Claus returned from his night ride with Glossie  and Flossie brought to him a new trouble.  Will Knook, the chief  guardian of the deer, came to him, surly and ill-tempered, to complain  that he had kept Glossie and Flossie beyond daybreak, in opposition to  his orders.    \"Yet it could not have been very long after daybreak,\" said Claus.    \"It was one minute after,\" answered Will Knook, \"and that is as bad as  one hour.  I shall set the stinging gnats on Glossie and Flossie, and  they will thus suffer terribly for their disobedience.\"    \"Don't do that!\" begged Claus.  \"It was my fault.\"    But Will Knook would listen to no excuses, and went away grumbling and  growling in his ill-natured way.    For this reason Claus entered the Forest to consult Necile about  rescuing the good deer from punishment.  To his delight he found his  old friend, the Master Woodsman, seated in the circle of Nymphs.    Ak listened to the story of the night journey to the children and of  the great assistance the deer had been to Claus by drawing his sledge  over the frozen snow.    \"I do not wish my friends to be punished if I can save them,\" said the  toy-maker, when he had finished the relation.  \"They were only one  minute late, and they ran swifter than a bird flies to get home before  daybreak.\"    Ak stroked his beard thoughtfully a moment, and then sent for the  Prince of the Knooks, who rules all his people in Burzee, and also for  the Queen of the Fairies and the Prince of the Ryls.    When all had assembled Claus told his story again, at Ak's command, and  then the Master addressed the Prince of the Knooks, saying:    \"The good work that Claus is doing among mankind deserves the support  of every honest immortal.  Already he is called a Saint in some of the  towns, and before long the name of Santa Claus will be lovingly known  in every home that is blessed with children.  Moreover, he is a son of  our Forest, so we owe him our encouragement.  You, Ruler of the Knooks,  have known him these many years; am I not right in saying he deserves  our friendship?\"    The Prince, crooked and sour of visage as all Knooks are, looked only  upon the dead leaves at his feet and muttered: \"You are the Master  Woodsman of the World!\"    Ak smiled, but continued, in soft tones: \"It seems that the deer which  are guarded by your people can be of great assistance to Claus, and as  they seem willing to draw his sledge I beg that you will permit him to  use their services whenever he pleases.\"    The Prince did not reply, but tapped the curled point of his sandal  with the tip of his spear, as if in thought.    Then the Fairy Queen spoke to him in this way: \"If you consent to Ak's  request I will see that no harm comes to your deer while they are away  from the Forest.\"    And the Prince of the Ryls added: \"For my part I will allow to every  deer that assists Claus the privilege of eating my casa plants, which  give strength, and my grawle plants, which give fleetness of foot, and  my marbon plants, which give long life.\"    And the Queen of the Nymphs said: \"The deer which draw the sledge of  Claus will be permitted to bathe in the Forest pool of Nares, which  will give them sleek coats and wonderful beauty.\"    The Prince of the Knooks, hearing these promises, shifted uneasily on  his seat, for in his heart he hated to refuse a request of his fellow  immortals, although they were asking an unusual favor at his hands, and  the Knooks are unaccustomed to granting favors of any kind.  Finally he  turned to his servants and said:    \"Call Will Knook.\"    When surly Will came and heard the demands of the immortals he  protested loudly against granting them.    \"Deer are deer,\" said he, \"and nothing but deer.  Were they horses it  would be right to harness them like horses.  But no one harnesses deer  because they are free, wild creatures, owing no service of any sort to  mankind.  It would degrade my deer to labor for Claus, who is only a  man in spite of the friendship lavished on him by the immortals.\"    \"You have heard,\" said the Prince to Ak.  \"There is truth in what Will  says.\"    \"Call Glossie and Flossie,\" returned the Master.    The deer were brought to the conference and Ak asked them if they  objected to drawing the sledge for Claus.    \"No, indeed!\" replied Glossie; \"we enjoyed the trip very much.\"    \"And we tried to get home by daybreak,\" added Flossie, \"but were  unfortunately a minute too late.\"    \"A minute lost at daybreak doesn't matter,\" said Ak.  \"You are forgiven  for that delay.\"    \"Provided it does not happen again,\" said the Prince of the Knooks,  sternly.    \"And will you permit them to make another journey with me?\" asked  Claus, eagerly.    The Prince reflected while he gazed at Will, who was scowling, and at  the Master Woodsman, who was smiling.    Then he stood up and addressed the company as follows:    \"Since you all urge me to grant the favor I will permit the deer to go  with Claus once every year, on Christmas Eve, provided they always  return to the Forest by daybreak.  He may select any number he pleases,  up to ten, to draw his sledge, and those shall be known among us as  Reindeer, to distinguish them from the others.  And they shall bathe in  the Pool of Nares, and eat the casa and grawle and marbon plants and  shall be under the especial protection of the Fairy Queen.  And now  cease scowling, Will Knook, for my words shall be obeyed!\"    He hobbled quickly away through the trees, to avoid the thanks of Claus  and the approval of the other immortals, and Will, looking as cross as  ever, followed him.    But Ak was satisfied, knowing that he could rely on the promise of the  Prince, however grudgingly given; and Glossie and Flossie ran home,  kicking up their heels delightedly at every step.    \"When is Christmas Eve?\" Claus asked the Master.    \"In about ten days,\" he replied.    \"Then I can not use the deer this year,\" said Claus, thoughtfully, \"for  I shall not have time enough to make my sackful of toys.\"    \"The shrewd Prince foresaw that,\" responded Ak, \"and therefore named  Christmas Eve as the day you might use the deer, knowing it would cause  you to lose an entire year.\"    \"If I only had the toys the Awgwas stole from me,\" said Claus, sadly,  \"I could easily fill my sack for the children.\"    \"Where are they?\" asked the Master.    \"I do not know,\" replied Claus, \"but the wicked Awgwas probably hid  them in the mountains.\"    Ak turned to the Fairy Queen.    \"Can you find them?\" he asked.    \"I will try,\" she replied, brightly.    Then Claus went back to the Laughing Valley, to work as hard as he  could, and a band of Fairies immediately flew to the mountain that had  been haunted by the Awgwas and began a search for the stolen toys.
