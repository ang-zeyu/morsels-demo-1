But the temptation of a discovery so  singular and profound, at last overcame the suggestions of alarm.  I had long since prepared my tincture; I purchased at once, from  a firm of wholesale chemists, a large quantity of a particular  salt which I knew, from my experiments, to be the last ingredient  required; and late one accursed night, I compounded the elements,  watched them boil and smoke together in the glass, and when the  ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of courage, drank off  the potion.    The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly  nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the  hour of birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to  subside, and I came to myself as if out of a great sickness.  There was something strange in my sensations, something  indescribably new and, from its very novelty, incredibly sweet. I  felt younger, lighter, happier in body; within I was conscious of  a heady recklessness, a current of disordered sensual images  running like a mill-race in my fancy, a solution of the bonds of  obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul. I  knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more  wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil;  and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me like  wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of  these    87)    sensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost  in stature.    There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands  beside me as I write, was brought there later on and for the very  purpose of these transformations. The night, however, was far  gone into the morning--the morning, black as it was, was nearly  ripe for the conception of the day--the inmates of my house  were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber; and I  determined, flushed as I was with hope and triumph, to venture in  my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I crossed the yard, wherein  the constellations looked down upon me, I could have thought,  with wonder, the first creature of that sort that their  unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through  the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room,  I saw for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.    I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know,  but that which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my  nature, to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was  less robust and less developed than the good which I had just  deposed. Again, in the course of my life, which had been, after  all, nine-tenths a life of effort, virtue, and control, it had  been much less exercised and much less exhausted. And hence, as I  think, it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller,    88)    slighter, and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as good shone upon  the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly  on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still  believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an  imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that  ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather  of a leap of welcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural  and human. In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it  seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided  countenance I had been hitherto accustomed to call mine. And in  so far I was doubtless right. I have observed that when I wore  the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come near to me at first  without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as I take it, was  because all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of  good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind,  was pure evil.    I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive  experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if  I had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before  daylight from a house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back  to my cabinet, I once more prepared and drank the cup, once more  suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to myself once more  with the character, the stature, and the face of Henry Jekyll.    89)    That night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached  my discovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment  while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must  have been otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I  had come forth an angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no  discriminating action; it was neither diabolical nor divine; it  but shook the doors of the prison-house of my disposition; and  like the captives of Philippi, that which stood within ran forth.  At that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by  ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the  thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence, although I had  now two characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly  evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that  incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had  already learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward  the worse.    Even at that time, I had not yet conquered my aversion to the  dryness of a life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at  times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least) undignified,  and I was not only well known and highly considered, but growing  toward the elderly man, this incoherency of my life was daily  growing more unwelcome. It was on this side that my new power  tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to drink the cup,  to doff at once the body    90)    of the noted professor, and to assume, like a thick cloak, that  of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the notion; it seemed to me at the  time to be humorous; and I made my preparations with the most  studious care. I took and furnished that house in Soho, to which  Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as housekeeper a  creature whom I well knew to be silent and unscrupulous. On the  other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr. Hyde (whom I  described) was to have full liberty and power about my house in  the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made myself a  familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that will  to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in  the person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde  without pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on  every side, I began to profit by the strange immunities of my  position.    Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while  their own person and reputation sat under shelter. I was the  first that ever did so for his pleasures. I was the first that  could thus plod in the public eye with a load of genial  respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off  these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty. But  for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was complete. Think  of it--I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my  laboratory door, give me but a second or    91)    two to mix and swallow the draught that I had always standing  ready; and whatever he had done, Edward Hyde would pass away like  the stain of breath upon a mirror; and there in his stead,  quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his study, a man  who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry Jekyll.    The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as  I have said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But  in the hands of Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the  monstrous. When I would come back from these excursions, I was  often plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity.  This familiar that I called out of my own soul, and sent forth  alone to do his good pleasure, was a being inherently malign and  villainous; his every act and thought centred on self; drinking  pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to  another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at  times aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation  was apart from ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp  of conscience. It was Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was  guilty. Jekyll was no worse; he woke again to his good qualities  seemingly unimpaired; he would even make haste, where it was  possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And thus his conscience  slumbered.    Into the details of the infamy at which I thus    92)    connived (for even now I can scarce grant that I committed it) I  have no design of entering; I mean but to point out the warnings  and the successive steps with which my chastisement approached. I  met with one accident which, as it brought on no consequence, I  shall no more than mention. An act of cruelty to a child aroused  against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I recognised the other  day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and the child's  family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my life;  and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward  Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque  drawn in the name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily  eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank  in the name of Edward Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own  hand backward, I had supplied my double with a signature, I  thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.    Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out  for one of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke  the next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain  I looked about me; in vain I saw "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#12)"],[1," both  light and air.  Looking through this opening they could see the Valley  of Voe lying far below them, the cottages seeming like toy houses from  that distance.    After resting a few moments they resumed their climb, and still the  stairs were broad and low enough for Jim to draw the buggy easily after  him.  The old horse panted a little, and had to stop often to get his  breath.  At such times they were all glad to wait for him, for  continually climbing up stairs is sure to make one's legs ache.    They wound about, always going upward, for some time.  The lights from  the lanterns dimly showed the way, but it was a gloomy journey, and  they were pleased when a broad streak of light ahead assured them they  were coming to a second landing.    Here one side of the mountain had a great hole in it, like the mouth of  a cavern, and the stairs stopped at the near edge of the floor and  commenced ascending again at the opposite edge.    The opening in the mountain was on the side opposite to the Valley of  Voe, and our travellers looked out upon a strange scene.  Below them  was a vast space, at the bottom of which was a black sea with rolling  billows, through which little tongues of flame constantly shot up.  Just above them, and almost on a level with their platform, were banks  of rolling clouds which constantly shifted position and changed color.  The blues and greys were very beautiful, and Dorothy noticed that on  the cloud banks sat or reclined fleecy, shadowy forms of beautiful  beings who must have been the Cloud Fairies.  Mortals who stand upon  the earth and look up at the sky cannot often distinguish these forms,  but our friends were now so near to the clouds that they observed the  dainty fairies very clearly.    \"Are they real?\" asked Zeb, in an awed voice.    \"Of course,\" replied Dorothy, softly.  \"They are the Cloud Fairies.\"    \"They seem like open-work,\" remarked the boy, gazing intently.  \"If I  should squeeze one, there wouldn't be anything left of it.\"    In the open space between the clouds and the black, bubbling sea far  beneath, could be seen an occasional strange bird winging its way  swiftly through the air.  These birds were of enormous size, and  reminded Zeb of the rocs he had read about in the Arabian Nights.  They  had fierce eyes and sharp talons and beaks, and the children hoped none  of them would venture into the cavern.    \"Well, I declare!\" suddenly exclaimed the little Wizard.  \"What in the  world is this?\"    They turned around and found a man standing on the floor in the center  of the cave, who bowed very politely when he saw he had attracted their  attention.  He was a very old man, bent nearly double; but the queerest  thing about him was his white hair and beard.  These were so long that  they reached to his feet, and both the hair and the beard were  carefully plaited into many braids, and the end of each braid fastened  with a bow of colored ribbon.    \"Where did you come from?\" asked Dorothy, wonderingly.    \"No place at all,\" answered the man with the braids; \"that is, not  recently.  Once I lived on top the earth, but for many years I have had  my factory in this spot--half way up Pyramid Mountain.\"    \"Are we only half way up?\" enquired the boy, in a discouraged tone.    \"I believe so, my lad,\" replied the braided man.  \"But as I have never  been in either direction, down or up, since I arrived, I cannot be  positive whether it is exactly half way or not.\"    \"Have you a factory in this place?\" asked the Wizard, who had been  examining the strange personage carefully.    \"To be sure,\" said the other.  \"I am a great inventor, you must know,  and I manufacture my products in this lonely spot.\"    \"What are your products?\" enquired the Wizard.    \"Well, I make Assorted Flutters for flags and bunting, and a superior  grade of Rustles for ladies' silk gowns.\"    \"I thought so,\" said the Wizard, with a sigh.  \"May we examine some of  these articles?\"    \"Yes, indeed; come into my shop, please,\" and the braided man turned  and led the way into a smaller cave, where he evidently lived.  Here,  on a broad shelf, were several card-board boxes of various sizes, each  tied with cotton cord.    \"This,\" said the man, taking up a box and handling it gently, \"contains  twelve dozen rustles--enough to last any lady a year.  Will you buy  it, my dear?\" he asked, addressing Dorothy.    \"My gown isn't silk,\" she said, smiling.    \"Never mind.  When you open the box the rustles will escape, whether  you are wearing a silk dress or not,\" said the man, seriously.  Then he  picked up another box.  \"In this,\" he continued, \"are many assorted  flutters.  They are invaluable to make flags flutter on a still day,  when there is no wind.  You, sir,\" turning to the Wizard, \"ought to  have this assortment.  Once you have tried my goods I am sure you will  never be without them.\"    \"I have no money with me,\" said the Wizard, evasively.    \"I do not want money,\" returned the braided man, \"for I could not spend  it in this deserted place if I had it.  But I would like very much a  blue hair-ribbon.  You will notice my braids are tied with yellow,  pink, brown, red, green, white and black; but I have no blue ribbons.\"    \"I'll get you one!\" cried Dorothy, who was sorry for the poor man; so  she ran back to the buggy and took from her suit-case a pretty blue  ribbon.  It did her good to see how the braided man's eyes sparkled  when he received this treasure.    \"You have made me very, very happy, my dear!\" he exclaimed; and then he  insisted on the Wizard taking the box of flutters and the little girl  accepting the box of rustles.    \"You may need them, some time,\" he said, \"and there is really no use in  my manufacturing these things unless somebody uses them.\"    \"Why did you leave the surface of the earth?\" enquired the Wizard.    \"I could not help it.  It is a sad story, but if you will try to  restrain your tears I will tell you about it.  On earth I was a  manufacturer of Imported Holes for American Swiss Cheese, and I will  acknowledge that I supplied a superior article, which was in great  demand.  Also I made pores for porous plasters and high-grade holes for  doughnuts and buttons.  Finally I invented a new Adjustable Post-hole,  which I thought would make my fortune.  I manufactured a large quantity  of these post-holes, and having no room in which to store them I set  them all end to end and put the top one in the ground.  That made an  extraordinary long hole, as you may imagine, and reached far down into  the earth; and, as I leaned over it to try to see to the bottom, I lost  my balance and tumbled in.  Unfortunately, the hole led directly into  the vast space you see outside this mountain; but I managed to catch a  point of rock that projected from this cavern, and so saved myself from  tumbling headlong into the black waves beneath, where the tongues of  flame that dart out would certainly have consumed me.  Here, then, I  made my home; and although it is a lonely place I amuse myself making  rustles and flutters, and so get along very nicely.\"    When the braided man had completed this strange tale Dorothy nearly  laughed, because it was all so absurd; but the Wizard tapped his  forehead significantly, to indicate that he thought the poor man was  crazy.  So they politely bade him good day, and went back to the outer  cavern to resume their journey.          11.  They Meet the Wooden Gargoyles      Another breathless climb brought our adventurers to a third landing  where there was a rift in the mountain.  On peering out all they could  see was rolling banks of clouds, so thick that they obscured all else.    But the travellers were obliged to rest, and while they were sitting on  the rocky floor the Wizard felt in his pocket and brought out the nine  tiny piglets.  To his delight they were now plainly visible, which  proved that they had passed beyond the influence of the magical Valley  of Voe.    \"Why, we can see each other again!\" cried one, joyfully.    \"Yes,\" sighed Eureka; \"and I also can see you again, and the sight  makes me dreadfully hungry.  Please, Mr. Wizard, may I eat just one of  the fat little piglets?  You'd never miss ONE of them, I'm sure!\"    \"What a horrid, savage beast!\" exclaimed a piglet; \"and after we've  been such good friends, too, and played with one another!\"    \"When I'm not hungry, I love to play with you all,\" said the kitten,  demurely; \"but when my stomach is empty it seems that nothing would  fill it so nicely as a fat piglet.\"    \"And we trusted you so!\" said another of the nine, reproachfully.    \"And thought you were respectable!\" said another.    \"It seems we were mistaken,\" declared a third, looking at the kitten  timorously, \"no one with such murderous desires should belong to our  party, I'm sure.\"    \"You see, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy, reprovingly, \"you are making  yourself disliked.  There are certain things proper for a kitten to  eat; but I never heard of a kitten eating a pig, under ANY cir'stances.\"    \"Did you ever see such little pigs before?\" asked the kitten.  \"They  are no bigger than mice, and I'm sure mice are proper for me to eat.\"    \"It isn't the bigness, dear; its the variety,\" replied the girl.  \"These are Mr. Wizard's pets, just as you are my pet, and it wouldn't  be any more proper for you to eat them than it would be for Jim to eat  you.\"    \"And that's just what I shall do if you don't let those little balls of  pork alone,\" said Jim, glaring at the kitten with his round, big eyes.  \"If you injure any one of them I'll chew you up instantly.\"    The kitten looked at the horse thoughtfully, as if trying to decide  whether he meant it or not.    \"In that case,\" she said, \"I'll leave them alone.  You haven't many  teeth left, Jim, but the few you have are sharp enough to make me  shudder.  So the piglets will be perfectly safe, hereafter, as far as I  am concerned.\"    \"That is right, Eureka,\" remarked the"]]]
