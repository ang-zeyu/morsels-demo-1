Meantime the best room of the inn had been \"tidied up\"--I suppose in our  honour, for next day our meals were served there instead of in the  kitchen as at first. It resembled the \"best room\" of most Canadian  farmhouses. A four-post bedstead stood in one corner, covered with a  patchwork quilt, generally the work of the wife when a girl; a bureau was  decorated with the few books possessed by the family--usually a Bible,  almanac, and photograph album--the best cups and saucers, a looking-glass  and a pin-cushion; an old-fashioned roomy sofa filled another corner. The  dining-table in the centre had extension leaves, very far from level; the  wall was decorated with a big clock, a couple of bright-coloured prints,  a portrait or two and a sampler; and the floor was covered in patches  with rag mats.    If we flattered ourselves that promotion into the \"best room\" would  ensure privacy, we were doomed to disappointment. The whole family, from  the doleful mamma to the youngest olive-branch, favoured us with their  presence, sat on the sofa, and, looking through the album, were kind  enough to discuss their relations and friends _pro bono publico_.  The youngest child, aged five, having an occasional inclination to lay  violent hands upon portions of our dinner, was pounced upon by one or  other of her family, roughly shaken or thumped, and banged down upon a  hard wooden chair; while from some other loving relative came the remark,  made between set teeth, \"I'd slap her, I would!\" Poor little thing! she  did not seem \"a' there,\" as the Scotch say; the frequent boxing and  banging her poor head underwent probably increasing, if it did not  occasion, her stupidity.    Early on Friday morning we set out again, under more favourable auspices,  though the day was cold and cloudy. One of the division superintendents,  or \"walking bosses\" as they are called, employed by the contractors, had  arrived at our resting-place the day before, _en route_ for the  \"Angle,\" and he offered to exchange teams with us, if we would allow him  to accompany his good horses. This proposal was gladly accepted, and with  the utmost satisfaction we saw our French-Indian Jehu depart with his  ill-conditioned brutes.    After leaving Pointe du Chêne, the road for some distance lies up a long  rocky hill, and then passes through a comparatively well-wooded country.  But we thought little of surrounding scenery. The wind was so cold, and  the frequent snow-storms during the day were so disagreeable, that we had  quite enough to do to keep ourselves and the children warm.    We had our dinner near a dismantled log-house on the bank of a narrow  creek, and reaching Whitemouth River about seven, put up at a shanty  built by Government to shelter travellers on the Dawson road. It is kept  by a Norwegian named Nord and his wife, and can only boast of three small  rooms and a kitchen. It was too cold to camp out, so, spreading our rugs  and blankets on the floor, we lay down and slept, too tired to heed the  hardness of the boards.    On Saturday the air was warmer, and the road comparatively good, and we  were sufficiently at ease to look out for and admire the wild-flowers  that grew on every side (Mr. R---- good-naturedly stopping to gather some  for us), and watch for the young rabbits started by the dogs, who yelped  loudly when in full chase after them. We had two dogs when we left  Winnipeg, but now our pack numbered eight, some joining us at every  halting-place. But in the same proportion that the dogs increased, the  cats decreased, a kitten being begged at every house, as they were  overrun with mice; and our cats were received with almost as much delight  as Dick Whittington's historical speculation. Unfortunately, however, the  recipients were too poor to make our fortunes in return. At noon we  passed our teamsters, and Mr. R----'s gang of navvies, rather  picturesquely grouped round their camp fire, where tea was boiling and  pork frying. The untethered horses were feeding by the roadside, and  \"Stick-in-the-Mud,\" for once superior to his name, was alone plodding  steadily on. This was our easiest day's journey, and it was scarcely four  o'clock when we reached Birch river, a dry sandy hill round which a tiny  creek wound. We were glad of a few hours' respite to run about and  stretch our weary limbs. One of our party discovering that the banking of  the shanty was full of mushrooms, we gathered a great many, and took them  to the kitchen to be cooked.    This way-house is kept by two brothers, who have literally nothing to do  but cook, eat, and sleep, bare shelter being all that the Government  supplies to travellers. One of the brothers was making dough-nuts and  boiling them in a pot of fat, and although they did not look tempting I  had the greatest curiosity to taste them. However, as he did not give me  any encouragement to ask for one, my curiosity remained unsatisfied, and  I had to content myself with the mushrooms, which had full justice done  to them. As night came on, the mosquitoes were terrible; smoke was of no  avail to keep them away. The cook told me that the season for them was  only just beginning, and that they were nothing to what they would be in  a month. The previous summer their cow had literally been tortured to  death, between the mosquitoes and deer-flies. Mr. C---- had a mosquito  netting tent which was put up in the room we slept in, so that we had  comparative exemption from their torments; but it was too hot to sleep,  and all night long I heard the men outside fighting with and swearing at  their winged enemies.    We set out early on Sunday, as we had a long day's drive before us, and  were to have our first experience of a corduroy road. The one in question  was a very bad specimen, a succession of deep mud-holes, round some of  which we skirted cautiously, wondering how \"Stick-in-the-Mud\" would get  through, and plunging into some swamps, which seemed to tax all the  strength our team could exert to lug us out again. We soon arrived at the  great Cariboo muskeg, on the smooth squared-timber road. This muskeg  must, at some earlier stage of the world's existence, have been a great  lake full of islands; now it is a grassy swamp, the water clear as spring  water, studded with groups of high rocks of varied size and shape,  overgrown by tall pines, birch, scrubby underbrush, ferns, and moss. We  had been getting on with such comparative ease that we began to think our  fears of the \"corduroy road\" had been groundless; but before night we  experienced the wisdom of the warning not to \"halloo before we were out  of the bush.\" We took our lunch on some flat rocks, near a place known on  the road as \"six-mile shanty;\" not without difficulty, as the dogs, like  ourselves, were hungry, and, while we were in chase of a refractory  umbrella carried away by the wind, one dog demolished the butter and  another ran off with our roast beef; and when we reflected that it was  the last fresh meat we were likely to taste for months, we saw it depart  with regret, even though the ham had been left us.    If the roads were bad in the morning, they were ten times worse in the  afternoon; and nothing, I think, will ever make me forget the last five  miles of real corduroy road we traversed before reaching the \"Angle.\" It  consisted of round logs, loosely bound together, and thrown down upon a  marsh, no two consecutive logs being of the same size. There had  originally been some foundation, and there were still deep drains dug on  each side; but the logs had given way at different ends in some parts,  and altogether in others. It was bump, bump, bang, and swash; swash,  bang, and bump; now up, now down, now all on one side, now all on the  other. Cushions, rugs, everything that could slide, slid off the seats;  the children were frightened and fretting; the bird fluttered itself  almost to death in vain attempts to escape; the kittens were restless;  and all our hair-pins, slipping down our backs, added a cold shiver to  our other miseries.    One longed to cry out and beg to be allowed to stop, if only for a  moment. But of what use would that have been? We had to endure it, so it  was best to get it over quickly. In many places the old road was  completely gone, and we had to drive through such dreadful holes that we  wondered the waggon, came out entire. [Footnote: Much of this part of the  road is now under water and well-nigh impassable, the prospect of soon  having the Canada Pacific Railway in working order making it seem waste  of time and money to repair it.] Never was smooth road greeted with  greater pleasure than we hailed the last mile from the \"Angle;\" and never  did more stiff and weary travellers arrive at any bourn than our party  when alighting at the \"Angle\" that night.

The \"Nor'-west Angle\" is a little village at the north-west corner of  the Lake of the Woods, and at the mouth of a nameless river, or narrow  arm of the lake. The banks on one side are high and wooded, on the other  high also, but completely bare of shrubs or trees; while between them the  river wanders hither and thither through marshy ground, looking somewhat  as one fancies the fens at home must do.    The company's house is a long, low white building, with narrow windows  and doors, neat fences and grass plots in front, and a very fair kitchen  garden, showing signs of care and attention. The houses near are all  one-storied, log-built, and plastered with mud inside and out.

I shall never forget this day, when I  regained my life through your kind hands. In return for this kind  assistance I pledge my oath to stand by you in all calamities.  Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me. I am there with  you ready to oblige you by all the means that I can. To tell you  briefly how I came in here: Three days ago I was roaming in yonder  forest, when I saw a goldsmith passing through it. I chased him. He,  finding it impossible to escape my claws, jumped into this well, and  is living to this moment in the very bottom of it. I also jumped in,  but found myself on the first ledge of the well; he is on the last and  fourth ledge. In the second lives a serpent half-famished with hunger.  On the third lies a rat, also half-famished, and when you again begin  to draw water these may request you first to release them. In the same  way the goldsmith also may ask you. I beg you, as your bosom friend,  never assist that wretched man, though he is your relation as a human  being. Goldsmiths are never to be trusted. You can place more faith in  me, a tiger, though I feast sometimes upon men, in a serpent, whose  sting makes your blood cold the very next moment, or in a rat, which  does a thousand pieces of mischief in your house. But never trust a  goldsmith. Do not release him; and if you do, you shall surely repent  of it one day or other.\" Thus advising, the hungry tiger went away  without waiting for an answer.    [Illustration:]    Gangazara thought several times of the eloquent way in which the tiger  spoke, and admired his fluency of speech. But still his thirst was not  quenched. So he let down his vessel again, which was now caught hold  of by the serpent, who addressed him thus: \"Oh, my protector! Lift me  up. I am the king of serpents, and the son of Adisesha, who is now  pining away in agony for my disappearance. Release me now. I shall  ever remain your servant, remember your assistance, and help you  throughout life in all possible ways. Oblige me: I am dying.\"  Gangazara, calling again to mind the \"DEATH ON THE SEA-SHORE\" of the  prophecy lifted him up. He, like the tiger-king, walked round him  thrice, and prostrating himself before him spoke thus: \"Oh, my  life-giver, my father, for so I must call you, as you have given me  another birth. I was three days ago basking myself in the morning sun,  when I saw a rat running before me. I chased him. He fell into this  well. I followed him, but instead of falling on the third storey where  he is now lying, I fell into the second. I am going away now to see my  father. Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me. I will be  there by your side to assist you by all possible means.\" So saying,  the Nagaraja glided away in zigzag movements, and was out of sight in  a moment.    The poor son of the Soothsayer, who was now almost dying of thirst,  let down his vessel for a third time. The rat caught hold of it, and  without discussing he lifted up the poor animal at once. But it would  not go away without showing its gratitude: \"Oh, life of my life! My  benefactor! I am the king of rats. Whenever you are in any calamity  just think of me. I will come to you, and assist you. My keen ears  overheard all that the tiger-king told you about the goldsmith, who is  in the fourth storey. It is nothing but a sad truth that goldsmiths  ought never to be trusted. Therefore, never assist him as you have  done to us all. And if you do, you will suffer for it. I am hungry;  let me go for the present.\" Thus taking leave of his benefactor, the  rat, too, ran away.    Gangazara for a while thought upon the repeated advice given by the  three animals about releasing the goldsmith: \"What wrong would there  be in my assisting him? Why should I not release him also?\" So  thinking to himself, Gangazara let down the vessel again. The  goldsmith caught hold of it, and demanded help. The Soothsayer's son  had no time to lose; he was himself dying of thirst. Therefore he  lifted the goldsmith up, who now began his story. \"Stop for a while,\"  said Gangazara, and after quenching his thirst by letting down his  vessel for the fifth time, still fearing that some one might remain in  the well and demand his assistance, he listened to the goldsmith, who  began as follows: \"My dear friend, my protector, what a deal of  nonsense these brutes have been talking to you about me; I am glad you  have not followed their advice. I am just now dying of hunger. Permit  me to go away. My name is Manikkasari. I live in the East main street  of Ujjaini, which is twenty kas to the south of this place, and so  lies on your way when you return from Benares. Do not forget to come  to me and receive my kind remembrances of your assistance, on your way  back to your country.\" So saying, the goldsmith took his leave, and  Gangazara also pursued his way north after the above adventures.    He reached Benares, and lived there for more than ten years, and quite  forgot the tiger, serpent, rat, and goldsmith. After ten years of  religious life, thoughts of home and of his brother rushed into his  mind. \"I have secured enough merit now by my religious observances.  Let me return home.\" Thus thought Gangazara within himself, and very  soon he was on his way back to his country. Remembering the prophecy  of his father he returned by the same way by which he went to Benares  ten years before. While thus retracing his steps he reached the ruined  well where he had released the three brute kings and the goldsmith. At  once the old recollections rushed into his mind, and he thought of the  tiger to test his fidelity. Only a moment passed, and the tiger-king  came running before him carrying a large crown in his mouth, the  glitter of the diamonds of which for a time outshone even the bright  rays of the sun. He dropped the crown at his life-giver's feet, and,  putting aside all his pride, humbled himself like a pet cat to the  strokes of his protector, and began in the following words: \"My  life-giver! How is it that you have forgotten me, your poor servant,  for such a long time? I am glad to find that I still occupy a corner  in your mind. I can never forget the day when I owed my life to your  lotus hands. I have several jewels with me of little value. This  crown, being the best of all, I have brought here as a single ornament  of great value, which you can carry with you and dispose of in your  own country.\" Gangazara looked at the crown, examined it over and  over, counted and recounted the gems, and thought within himself that  he would become the richest of men by separating the diamonds and  gold, and selling them in his own country. He took leave of the  tiger-king, and after his disappearance thought of the kings of  serpents and rats, who came in their turn with their presents, and  after the usual greetings and exchange of words took their leave.  Gangazara was extremely delighted at the faithfulness with which the  brute beasts behaved, and went on his way to the south. While going  along he spoke to himself thus: \"These beasts have been very faithful  in their assistance. Much more, therefore, must Manikkasari be  faithful. I do not want anything from him now. If I take this crown  with me as it is, it occupies much space in my bundle. It may also  excite the curiosity of some robbers on the way. I will go now to  Ujjaini on my way. Manikkasari requested me to see him without failure  on my return journey. I shall do so, and request him to have the crown  melted, the diamonds and gold separated. He must do that kindness at  least for me. I shall then roll up these diamonds and gold ball in my  rags, and wend my way homewards.\" Thus thinking and thinking, he  reached Ujjaini. At once he inquired for the house of his goldsmith  friend, and found him without difficulty. Manikkasari was extremely  delighted to find on his threshold him who ten years before,  notwithstanding the advice repeatedly given him by the sage-looking  tiger, serpent, and rat, had relieved him from the pit of death.  Gangazara at once showed him the crown that he received from the  tiger-king, told him how he got it, and requested his kind assistance  to separate the gold and diamonds. Manikkasari agreed to do so, and  meanwhile asked his friend to rest himself for a while to have his  bath and meals; and Gangazara, who was very observant of his religious  ceremonies, went direct to the river to bathe.    How came the crown in the jaws of the tiger? The king of Ujjaini had a  week before gone with all his hunters on a hunting expedition. All of  a sudden the tiger-king started from the wood, seized the king, and  vanished.    When the king's attendants informed the prince about the death of his  father he wept and wailed, and gave notice that he would give half of  his kingdom to any one who should bring him news about the murderer of  his father. The goldsmith knew full well that it was a tiger that  killed the king, and not any hunter's hands, since he had heard from  Gangazara how he obtained the crown. Still, he resolved to denounce  Gangazara as the king's murderer, so, hiding the crown under his  garments, he flew to the palace. He went before the prince and  informed him that the assassin was caught, and placed the crown before  him. The prince took it into his hands, examined it, and at once gave  half the kingdom to Manikkasari, and then inquired about the murderer.  \"He is bathing in the river, and is of such and such appearance,\" was  the reply. At once four armed soldiers flew to the river, and bound  the poor Brahman hand and foot, while he, sitting in meditation, was  without any knowledge of the fate that hung over him. They brought  Gangazara to the presence of the prince, who turned his face away from  the supposed murderer, and asked his soldiers to throw him into a  dungeon. In a minute, without knowing the cause, the poor Brahman  found himself "]]]
