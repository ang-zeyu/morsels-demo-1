But though this is true without qualification,  it is equally true that the philosophers of the Middle Ages tried to  remove all materialistic notions from the Messianic idea. It is very  difficult to assert nowadays whether Judaism does or does not expect  a personal Messiah. A very marked change has undoubtedly come over the  spirit of the dream.    On the one hand the neo-Nationalists deny any Messianic hopes. When that  great leader, Theodor Herzl, started a Zionistic movement without claiming  to be the Jewish Messiah, he was putting the seal on a far-reaching change  in Jewish sentiment. Dr. J. H. Greenstone, who has just published an  interesting volume on the _Messianic Idea in Jewish History_, writes  (p. 276): 'After the first Basle Congress (1897), when Zionism assumed  its present political aspect, Dr. Max Nordau, the vice-president of the  Congress, found it necessary to address an article to the Hebrew-reading  public, in which he disclaimed all pretensions of Messiahship for himself  or for his colleague Dr. Theodor Herzl.' We have thus this extraordinary  situation. Many orthodox Jews stood aloof from the Zionistic movement  because it was not Messianic, while many unorthodox Jews joined it just  because of the movement's detachment from Messianic ideas.    It may be well to cite Dr. Greenstone's verdict on the whole question,  as the reader may care to have the opinion of so competent an authority  whose view differs from that of the present writer. 'Sacred as Zionism  is to many of its adherents, it cannot and will not take the place of the  Messianic hope. Zionism aims at the establishment of a Jewish State in  Palestine under the protection of the powers of Europe. The Messianic hope  promises the establishment, by the Jews, of a world-power in Palestine  to which all the nations of the earth will pay homage. Zionism, even  in its political aspect, will fulfil only one phase of the Jewish  Messianic hope. As such, if successful, it may contribute toward the  full realisation of the hope. If not successful, it will not deprive  the Jews of the hope. The Messianic hope is wider than the emancipation  of the Jews, it is more comprehensive than the establishment of a  Jewish, politically independent State. It participates in the larger  ideals of humanity, the ideals of perfection for the human race, but it  remains on Jewish soil, and retains its peculiarly Jewish significance.  It promises universal peace, an age of justice and of righteousness, an  age in which all men will recognise that God is One and His name One.  But this glorious age will come about through the regeneration of the  Jewish people, which in turn be effected by a man, a scion of the house  of David, sent by God to guide them on the road to righteousness. The  people chosen by God to be His messengers to the world will then be  able to accomplish their mission of regenerating the world. This was  the Messianic hope proclaimed by the prophets and sages, and this is  the Messianic hope of most Jews to-day, the difference between the  various sections being only a difference in the details of the hope'  (_op. cit._, p. 278).    Dr. Greenstone surely cannot mean that the question of a 'personal  Messiah' is a mere detail of the belief. Yet it is on that point that  opinion is most divided among Jews. The older belief undeniably was what  Dr. Greenstone enunciates. But for this belief, none of what Mr. Zangwill  aptly terms the 'Dreamers of the Ghetto' would have found the ready  acceptance that several of them did when they presented themselves as  Messiah or his forerunners. And no doubt there are many Jews who still  cling to this form of the belief.    On the other hand, there has been a slow but widespread tendency to  reinterpret the whole intention of the Messianic hope of Judaism. In  1869, and again in 1885, American Conferences of liberal Rabbis adopted  resolutions to the following effect: 'The Messianic aim of Israel is not  the restoration of the old Jewish State under a descendant of David,  involving a second separation from the nations of the earth, but the  union of all children of God in the confession of the unity of God,  so as to realise the unity of all rational creatures and their call to  moral sanctification.' This view sees in the destruction of the Temple  and the dispersal of Israel not a punishment but a stage in the fulfilment  of Israel's destiny as revealed to Abraham. Israel is High-Priest, and  can only fulfil his mission in the close neighbourhood of those to whom  he is elected to minister.    This, no less than the non-Messianic Zionism, is a considerable change  from older beliefs. As a Messianic hope it transcends the visions of  Isaiah. The prophet looks forward to an ideal future, a reign of peace  and felicity, but the nations are to flow to Zion. The significance of  the change lies in this. The Messianic idea now means to many Jews a  belief in human development and progress, with the Jews filling the role  of the Messianic people, but only as _primus inter pares_. It is  the expression of a genuine optimism. 'Character, no less than Career,'  said George Eliot, 'is a process and an unfolding.' So with the Character  of mankind as a whole. But this idea of development, unfolding, is quite  modern in the real sense of the terms; it is something outside the range  even of the second Isaiah. Judaism was never quite sure whether to join  the ranks of the '_laudatores temporis acti_,' or to believe that man  never is but always to be blest. On the one hand, the person of Adam was  endowed with perfections such as none of his successors matched. On the  other hand, the Golden Age of Judaism, as Kenan said, was thrown forward  into the future. That on the whole Judaism has taken the prospective  rather than the retrospective view, is the sole justification for the  modern conception of the Messianic Age which is fast becoming predominant  in the Synagogue. The Synagogue does not share the Roman poet's sentiment:      'A race of men baser than their sires    Gave birth to us, a progeny more vile,    Who dower the world with offspring viler still';    but the English poet's trust:      'Yet I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs,    And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.'    Denouncing the 'Calculators of the End,' a Rabbi said (Sanh. 97 b):  'All the computed terms have passed, and the matter dependeth now on  repentance and good deeds' (cf. S. Singer, The Messianic Idea in Judaism,  pp. 1 and 18)    If, however, Israel is not destined to a Restoration, if the  Jewish Mission is the propagation of an idea, on what ground is the  continued existence of Israel as a separate organisation defensible or  justified? Israel is indestructible, said Jehuda Halevi in the twelfth  century; certainly Israel is undestroyed. When Frederick the Great  asked what should make him believe in God, he received in answer,  'the survival of the Jews.' Dr. Guttmann of Breslau not long since put  forward a similar plea in vindication of the continued significance of  Judaism. In nature all forms die when their utility is over; in history,  peoples succumb when their work in and for the world is complete. Shall,  he asks, we recognise Judaism as the solitary exception, as the unique  instance of the survival of the unfit and the unnecessary?    The modern apologists for all religions rarely belong to the rank  and file. Whether it be Harnack for Christianity or Mr. Montefiore  for Judaism, the vindicators stand far above the average of the  believers whose faith they are vindicating. The average man needs  no defence for a religion which enables him to live and thrive,  materially and spiritually. The importance of this consideration is very  great. Restricting our attention to Judaism, it is clear that it still  offers ideals to many, prescribes and enforces a moral law, teaches a  satisfying doctrine of God. If so, then it is futile to discuss whether  Judaism is still necessary. Can the world afford to surrender a single  one of its forces for good? If there are ten millions of men, women, and  children who live, and live not ignobly, by Judaism, can it be contended  that Judaism is obsolete? The first, the main justification of Judaism is  its continued efficiency, its proved power still to control and inspire  many millions of human lives. There are more people living as Jews to-day,  than there were at any previous moment in the world's history.    But, like many answers to questions, this reply does not satisfy those  who raise the question. I refer exclusively to the doubters among the Jews  themselves, for if Jews were themselves convinced of the justification of  the Jewish separateness, the rest of the world would be convinced. Now,  the Jews who ask this question are those who are not so completely given  over to Judaism, that they are blind to the claims of other religions.  To them the question is one not of absolute, but of comparative  truth. Judaism may still be a power, but it may not be a desirable  power. The further question therefore arises as to the mission of Israel  in history to come as well as in history past. History seems contradicted  by the claim made by Judaism. Jews are quick enough to see the weakness  of the pretension made by certain sects of dogmatic Christianity that  it is the last word of religion, that all saving truth was once for  all revealed some nineteen centuries ago. History, says the Jewish  controversialist, teaches no such lessons of finality. Forces appear,  work their destined course, and then make way for other forces. The world  does not stand still; it moves on. Then how can Judaism claim for itself  a permanence, a finality, which it must deny to every other system,  to every other influence which has in its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6980"],[0,"Tales of St. Austin's (#12)"],[1," he was  worried, but he undoubtedly was. Welch had a very grave and serious  mind. He shared a study with Charteris--for Charteris, though not yet a  School-prefect, was part owner of a study--and close observation had  convinced him that the latter was not responsible for his actions, and  that he wanted somebody to look after him. He had therefore elected  himself to the post of a species of modified and unofficial guardian  angel to him. The duties were heavy, and the remuneration exceedingly  light.    'Really, you know,' said MacArthur, 'I don't see what the point of all  your lunacy is. I don't know if you're aware of it, but the Old Man's  getting jolly sick with you.'    'I didn't know,' said Charteris, 'but I'm very glad to hear it. For  hist! I have a ger-rudge against the person. Beneath my ban that mystic  man shall suffer, _coute que coute_, Matilda. He sat upon  me--publicly, and the resultant blot on my scutcheon can only be wiped  out with blood, or broken rules,' he added.    This was true. To listen to Charteris on the subject, one might have  thought that he considered the matter rather amusing than otherwise.  This, however, was simply due to the fact that he treated everything  flippantly in conversation. But, like the parrot, he thought the more.  The actual _casus belli_ had been trivial. At least the mere  spectator would have considered it trivial. It had happened after this  fashion. Charteris was a member of the School corps. The orderly-room  of the School corps was in the junior part of the School buildings.  Charteris had been to replace his rifle in that shrine of Mars after a  mid-day drill, and on coming out into the passage had found himself in  the middle of a junior school 'rag' of the conventional type.  Somebody's cap had fallen off, and two hastily picked teams were  playing football with it (Association rules). Now, Charteris was not a  prefect (that, it may be observed in passing, was another source of  bitterness in him towards the Powers, for he was fairly high up in the  Sixth, and others of his set, Welch, Thomson, and Tony Graham, who were  also in the Sixth--the two last below him in form order--had already  received their prefects' caps). Not being a prefect, it would have been  officious in him to have stopped the game. So he was passing on with  what Mr Hurry Bungsho Jabberjee, B.A., would have termed a beaming  simper of indescribable suavity, when a member of one of the opposing  teams, in effecting a G. O. Smithian dribble, cannoned into him. To  preserve his balance--this will probably seem a very thin line of  defence, but 'I state but the facts'--he grabbed at the disciple of  Smith amidst applause, and at that precise moment a new actor appeared  on the scene--the Headmaster. Now, of all the things that lay in his  province, the Headmaster most disliked to see a senior 'ragging' with a  junior. He had a great idea of the dignity of the senior school, and  did all that in him lay to see that it was kept up. The greater number  of the juniors with whom the senior was found ragging, the more heinous  the offence. Circumstantial evidence was dead against Charteris. To all  outward appearances he was one of the players in the impromptu football  match. The soft and fascinating beams of the simper, to quote Mr  Jabberjee once more, had not yet faded from the act. A well-chosen word  or two from the Headmagisterial lips put a premature end to the  football match, and Charteris was proceeding on his way when the  Headmaster called him. He stopped. The Headmaster was angry. So angry,  indeed, that he did what in a more lucid interval he would not have  done. He hauled a senior over the coals in the hearing of a number of  juniors, one of whom (unidentified) giggled loudly. As Charteris had on  previous occasions observed, the Old Man, when he did start to take a  person's measure, didn't leave out much. The address was not long, but  it covered a great deal of ground. The section of it which chiefly  rankled in Charteris's mind, and which had continued to rankle ever  since, was that in which the use of the word 'buffoon' had occurred.  Everybody who has a gift of humour and (very naturally) enjoys  exercising it, hates to be called a buffoon. It was Charteris's one  weak spot. Every other abusive epithet in the language slid off him  without penetrating or causing him the least discomfort. The word  'buffoon' went home, right up to the hilt. And, to borrow from Mr  Jabberjee for positively the very last time, he had observed  (mentally): 'Henceforward I will perpetrate heaps of the lowest dregs  of vice.' He had, in fact, started a perfect bout of breaking rules,  simply because they were rules. The injustice of the thing rankled. No  one so dislikes being punished unjustly as the person who might have  been punished justly on scores of previous occasions, if he had only  been found out. To a certain extent, Charteris ran amok. He broke  bounds and did little work, and--he was beginning gradually to find  this out--got thoroughly tired of it all. Offended dignity, however,  still kept him at it, and much as he would have preferred to have  resumed a less feverish type of existence, he did not do so.    'I have a ger-rudge against the man,' he said.    'You _are_ an idiot, really,' said Welch.    'Welch,' said Charteris, by way of explanation to MacArthur, 'is a lad  of coarse fibre. He doesn't understand the finer feelings. He can't see  that I am doing this simply for the Old Man's good. Spare the rod,  spile the choild. Let's go and have a look at Tony when we're changed.  He'll be in the sick-room if he's anywhere.'    'All right,' said the Babe, as he went into his study. 'Buck up. I'll  toss you for first bath in a second.'    Charteris walked on with Welch to their sanctum.    'You know,' said Welch seriously, stooping to unlace his boots,  'rotting apart, you really are a most awful ass. I wish I could get you  to see it.'    'Never you mind, ducky,' said Charteris, 'I'm all right. I'll look  after myself.'        _Chapter 2_    It was about a week after the Bargees' match that the rules respecting  bounds were made stricter, much to the popular indignation. The penalty  for visiting Stapleton without leave was increased from two hundred  lines to two extra lessons. The venomous characteristic of extra lesson  was that it cut into one's football, for the criminal was turned into a  form-room from two till four on half-holidays, and so had to scratch  all athletic engagements for the day, unless he chose to go for a  solitary run afterwards. In the cricket term the effect of this was not  so deadly. It was just possible that you might get an innings somewhere  after four o'clock, even if only at the nets. But during the football  season--it was now February--to be in extra lesson meant a total loss  of everything that makes life endurable, and the School protested (to  one another, in the privacy of their studies) with no uncertain voice  against this barbarous innovation.    The reason for the change had been simple. At the corner of the High  Street at Stapleton was a tobacconist's shop, and Mr Prater, strolling  in one evening to renew his stock of Pioneer, was interested to observe  P. St H. Harrison, of Merevale's, purchasing a consignment of 'Girl of  my Heart' cigarettes (at twopence-halfpenny the packet of twenty,  including a coloured picture of Lord Kitchener). Now, Mr Prater was one  of the most sportsmanlike of masters. If he had merely met Harrison out  of bounds, and it had been possible to have overlooked him, he would  have done so. But such a proceeding in the interior of a small shop was  impossible. There was nothing to palliate the crime. The tobacconist  also kept the wolf from the door, and lured the juvenile population of  the neighbourhood to it, by selling various weird brands of sweets, but  it was only too obvious that Harrison was not after these. Guilt was in  his eye, and the packet of cigarettes in his hand. Also Harrison's  House cap was fixed firmly at the back of his head. Mr Prater finished  buying his Pioneer, and went out without a word. That night it was  announced to Harrison that the Headmaster wished to see him. The  Headmaster saw him, though for a certain period of the interview he did  not see the Headmaster, having turned his back on him by request. On  the following day Stapleton was placed doubly out of bounds.    Tony, who was still in bed, had not heard the news when Charteris came  to see him on the evening of the day on which the edict had gone forth.    'How are you getting on?' asked Charteris.    'Oh, fairly well. It's rather slow.'    'The grub seems all right.' Charteris absently reached out for a slice  of cake.    'Not bad.'    'And you don't have to do any work.'    'No.'    'Well, then, it seems to me you're having a jolly good time. What don't  you like about it?'    'It's so slow, being alone all day.'    'Makes you appreciate intellectual conversation all the more when you  get it. Mine, for instance.'    'I want something to read.'    'I'll bring you a Sidgwick's _Greek Prose Composition_, if you  like. Full of racy stories.'    'I've read 'em, thanks.'    'How about Jebb's _Homer_? You'd like that. Awfully interesting.  Proves that there never was such a man as Homer, you know, and that the  _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ were produced by evolution. General  style, quietly funny. Make you roar.'    'Don't be an idiot. I'm simply starving for something to read. Haven't  you got anything?'    'You've read all mine.'    'Hasn't Welch got any books?'    'Not one. He bags mine when he wants to read. I'll tell you what I will  do if you like.'    'What?'    'Go into Stapleton, and borrow something from Adamson.' Adamson was the  College doctor.    'By Jove, that's not a bad idea.'    'It's a dashed good idea, which wouldn't have occurred to anybody but a  genius. I've been quite a pal of Adamson's"]]]
