Sometimes when a father has an ugly,  loutish son, the love he bears him so blindfolds his eyes that he does  not see his defects, or, rather, takes them for gifts and charms of mind  and body, and talks of them to his friends as wit and grace. I,  however--for though I pass for the father, I am but the stepfather to  \"Don Quixote\"--have no desire to go with the current of custom, or to  implore thee, dearest reader, almost with tears in my eyes, as others do,  to pardon or excuse the defects thou wilt perceive in this child of mine.  Thou art neither its kinsman nor its friend, thy soul is thine own and  thy will as free as any man's, whate'er he be, thou art in thine own  house and master of it as much as the king of his taxes and thou knowest  the common saying, \"Under my cloak I kill the king;\" all which exempts  and frees thee from every consideration and obligation, and thou canst  say what thou wilt of the story without fear of being abused for any ill  or rewarded for any good thou mayest say of it.    My wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned,  without any embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of customary  sonnets, epigrams, and eulogies, such as are commonly put at the  beginning of books. For I can tell thee, though composing it cost me some  labour, I found none greater than the making of this Preface thou art now  reading. Many times did I take up my pen to write it, and many did I lay  it down again, not knowing what to write. One of these times, as I was  pondering with the paper before me, a pen in my ear, my elbow on the  desk, and my cheek in my hand, thinking of what I should say, there came  in unexpectedly a certain lively, clever friend of mine, who, seeing me  so deep in thought, asked the reason; to which I, making no mystery of  it, answered that I was thinking of the Preface I had to make for the  story of \"Don Quixote,\" which so troubled me that I had a mind not to  make any at all, nor even publish the achievements of so noble a knight.    \"For, how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what that ancient  lawgiver they call the Public will say when it sees me, after slumbering  so many years in the silence of oblivion, coming out now with all my  years upon my back, and with a book as dry as a rush, devoid of  invention, meagre in style, poor in thoughts, wholly wanting in learning  and wisdom, without quotations in the margin or annotations at the end,  after the fashion of other books I see, which, though all fables and  profanity, are so full of maxims from Aristotle, and Plato, and the whole  herd of philosophers, that they fill the readers with amazement and  convince them that the authors are men of learning, erudition, and  eloquence. And then, when they quote the Holy Scriptures!--anyone would  say they are St. Thomases or other doctors of the Church, observing as  they do a decorum so ingenious that in one sentence they describe a  distracted lover and in the next deliver a devout little sermon that it  is a pleasure and a treat to hear and read. Of all this there will be  nothing in my book, for I have nothing to quote in the margin or to note  at the end, and still less do I know what authors I follow in it, to  place them at the beginning, as all do, under the letters A, B, C,  beginning with Aristotle and ending with Xenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis,  though one was a slanderer and the other a painter. Also my book must do  without sonnets at the beginning, at least sonnets whose authors are  dukes, marquises, counts, bishops, ladies, or famous poets. Though if I  were to ask two or three obliging friends, I know they would give me  them, and such as the productions of those that have the highest  reputation in our Spain could not equal.    \"In short, my friend,\" I continued, \"I am determined that Senor Don  Quixote shall remain buried in the archives of his own La Mancha until  Heaven provide some one to garnish him with all those things he stands in  need of; because I find myself, through my shallowness and want of  learning, unequal to supplying them, and because I am by nature shy and  careless about hunting for authors to say what I myself can say without  them. Hence the cogitation and abstraction you found me in, and reason  enough, what you have heard from me.\"    Hearing this, my friend, giving himself a slap on the forehead and  breaking into a hearty laugh, exclaimed, \"Before God, Brother, now am I  disabused of an error in which I have been living all this long time I  have known you, all through which I have taken you to be shrewd and  sensible in all you do; but now I see you are as far from that as the  heaven is from the earth. It is possible that things of so little moment  and so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit like yours,  fit to break through and crush far greater obstacles? By my faith, this  comes, not of any want of ability, but of too much indolence and too  little knowledge of life. Do you want to know if I am telling the truth?  Well, then, attend to me, and you will see how, in the opening and  shutting of an eye, I sweep away all your difficulties, and supply all  those deficiencies which you say check and discourage you from bringing  before the world the story of your famous Don Quixote, the light and  mirror of all knight-errantry.\"    \"Say on,\" said I, listening to his talk; \"how do you propose to make up  for my diffidence, and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity I am in?\"    To which he made answer, \"Your first difficulty about the sonnets,  epigrams, or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning, and  which ought to be by persons of importance and rank, can be removed if  you yourself take a little trouble to make them; you can afterwards  baptise them, and put any name you like to them, fathering them on  Prester John of the Indies or the Emperor of Trebizond, who, to my  knowledge, were said to have been famous poets: and even if they were  not, and any pedants or bachelors should attack you and question the  fact, never care two maravedis for that, for even if they prove a lie  against you they cannot cut off the hand you wrote it with.    \"As to references in the margin to the books and authors from whom you  take the aphorisms and sayings you put into your story, it is only  contriving to fit in nicely any sentences or scraps of Latin you may  happen to have by heart, or at any rate that will not give you much  trouble to look up; so as, when you speak of freedom and captivity, to  insert    _Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro;_    and then refer in the margin to Horace, or whoever said it; or, if you  allude to the power of death, to come in with--    _Pallida mors Aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas,  Regumque turres._    \"If it be friendship and the love God bids us bear to our enemy, go at  once to the Holy Scriptures, which you can do with a very small amount of  research, and quote no less than the words of God himself: Ego autem dico  vobis: diligite inimicos vestros. If you speak of evil thoughts, turn to  the Gospel: De corde exeunt cogitationes malae. If of the fickleness of  friends, there is Cato, who will give you his distich:    _Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos,  Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris._    \"With these and such like bits of Latin they will take you for a  grammarian at all events, and that now-a-days is no small honour and  profit.    \"With regard to adding annotations at the end of the book, you may safely  do it in this way. If you mention any giant in your book contrive that it  shall be the giant Goliath, and with this alone, which will cost you  almost nothing, you have a grand note, for you can put--The giant Golias  or Goliath was a Philistine whom the shepherd David slew by a mighty  stone-cast in the Terebinth valley, as is related in the Book of  Kings--in the chapter where you find it written.    \"Next, to prove yourself a man of erudition in polite literature and  cosmography, manage that the river Tagus shall be named in your story,  and there you are at once with another famous annotation, setting  forth--The river Tagus was so called after a King of Spain: it has its  source in such and such a place and falls into the ocean, kissing the  walls of the famous city of Lisbon, and it is a common belief that it has  golden sands, etc. If you should have anything to do with robbers, I will  give you the story of Cacus, for I have it by heart; if with loose women,  there is the Bishop of Mondonedo, who will give you the loan of Lamia,  Laida, and Flora, any reference to whom will bring you great credit; if  with hard-hearted ones, Ovid will furnish you with Medea; if with witches  or enchantresses, Homer has Calypso, and Virgil Circe; if with valiant  captains, Julius Caesar himself will lend you himself in his own  'Commentaries,' and Plutarch will give you a thousand Alexanders. If you  should deal with love, with two ounces you may know of Tuscan you can go  to Leon the Hebrew, who will supply you to your heart's content; or if  you should not care to go to foreign countries you have at home Fonseca's  'Of the Love of God,' in which is condensed all that you or the most  imaginative mind can want on the subject. In short, all you have to do is  to manage to quote these names, or refer to these stories I have  mentioned, and leave it to me to insert the annotations and quotations,  and I swear by all that's good to fill your margins and use up four  sheets at the end of the book.    \"Now let us come to those references to authors which other books have,  and you want for yours. The remedy for this is very simple: You have only  to look out for some book that quotes them all, from A to Z as you say  yourself, and then insert the very same alphabet in your book, and though  the imposition may be plain to see, because you have so little need to  borrow from them,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5946"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 2, Complete (#12)"],[1,"what he calls  ventures, though I can't make out why he gives them that name. The first  time he was brought back to us slung across the back of an ass, and  belaboured all over; and the second time he came in an ox-cart, shut up  in a cage, in which he persuaded himself he was enchanted, and the poor  creature was in such a state that the mother that bore him would not have  known him; lean, yellow, with his eyes sunk deep in the cells of his  skull; so that to bring him round again, ever so little, cost me more  than six hundred eggs, as God knows, and all the world, and my hens too,  that won't let me tell a lie.\"    \"That I can well believe,\" replied the bachelor, \"for they are so good  and so fat, and so well-bred, that they would not say one thing for  another, though they were to burst for it. In short then, mistress  housekeeper, that is all, and there is nothing the matter, except what it  is feared Don Quixote may do?\"    \"No, senor,\" said she.    \"Well then,\" returned the bachelor, \"don't be uneasy, but go home in  peace; get me ready something hot for breakfast, and while you are on the  way say the prayer of Santa Apollonia, that is if you know it; for I will  come presently and you will see miracles.\"    \"Woe is me,\" cried the housekeeper, \"is it the prayer of Santa Apollonia  you would have me say? That would do if it was the toothache my master  had; but it is in the brains, what he has got.\"    \"I know what I am saying, mistress housekeeper; go, and don't set  yourself to argue with me, for you know I am a bachelor of Salamanca, and  one can't be more of a bachelor than that,\" replied Carrasco; and with  this the housekeeper retired, and the bachelor went to look for the  curate, and arrange with him what will be told in its proper place.    While Don Quixote and Sancho were shut up together, they had a discussion  which the history records with great precision and scrupulous exactness.  Sancho said to his master, \"Senor, I have educed my wife to let me go  with your worship wherever you choose to take me.\"    \"Induced, you should say, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"not educed.\"    \"Once or twice, as well as I remember,\" replied Sancho, \"I have begged of  your worship not to mend my words, if so be as you understand what I mean  by them; and if you don't understand them to say 'Sancho,' or 'devil,' 'I  don't understand thee; and if I don't make my meaning plain, then you may  correct me, for I am so focile-\"    \"I don't understand thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote at once; \"for I know  not what 'I am so focile' means.\"    \"'So focile' means I am so much that way,\" replied Sancho.    \"I understand thee still less now,\" said Don Quixote.    \"Well, if you can't understand me,\" said Sancho, \"I don't know how to put  it; I know no more, God help me.\"    \"Oh, now I have hit it,\" said Don Quixote; \"thou wouldst say thou art so  docile, tractable, and gentle that thou wilt take what I say to thee, and  submit to what I teach thee.\"    \"I would bet,\" said Sancho, \"that from the very first you understood me,  and knew what I meant, but you wanted to put me out that you might hear  me make another couple of dozen blunders.\"    \"May be so,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but to come to the point, what does  Teresa say?\"    \"Teresa says,\" replied Sancho, \"that I should make sure with your  worship, and 'let papers speak and beards be still,' for 'he who binds  does not wrangle,' since one 'take' is better than two 'I'll give  thee's;' and I say a woman's advice is no great thing, and he who won't  take it is a fool.\"    \"And so say I,\" said Don Quixote; \"continue, Sancho my friend; go on; you  talk pearls to-day.\"    \"The fact is,\" continued Sancho, \"that, as your worship knows better than  I do, we are all of us liable to death, and to-day we are, and to-morrow  we are not, and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep, and nobody can  promise himself more hours of life in this world than God may be pleased  to give him; for death is deaf, and when it comes to knock at our life's  door, it is always urgent, and neither prayers, nor struggles, nor  sceptres, nor mitres, can keep it back, as common talk and report say,  and as they tell us from the pulpits every day.\"    \"All that is very true,\" said Don Quixote; \"but I cannot make out what  thou art driving at.\"    \"What I am driving at,\" said Sancho, \"is that your worship settle some  fixed wages for me, to be paid monthly while I am in your service, and  that the same be paid me out of your estate; for I don't care to stand on  rewards which either come late, or ill, or never at all; God help me with  my own. In short, I would like to know what I am to get, be it much or  little; for the hen will lay on one egg, and many littles make a much,  and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost. To be sure, if  it should happen (what I neither believe nor expect) that your worship  were to give me that island you have promised me, I am not so ungrateful  nor so grasping but that I would be willing to have the revenue of such  island valued and stopped out of my wages in due promotion.\"    \"Sancho, my friend,\" replied Don Quixote, \"sometimes proportion may be as  good as promotion.\"    \"I see,\" said Sancho; \"I'll bet I ought to have said proportion, and not  promotion; but it is no matter, as your worship has understood me.\"    \"And so well understood,\" returned Don Quixote, \"that I have seen into  the depths of thy thoughts, and know the mark thou art shooting at with  the countless shafts of thy proverbs. Look here, Sancho, I would readily  fix thy wages if I had ever found any instance in the histories of the  knights-errant to show or indicate, by the slightest hint, what their  squires used to get monthly or yearly; but I have read all or the best  part of their histories, and I cannot remember reading of any  knight-errant having assigned fixed wages to his squire; I only know that  they all served on reward, and that when they least expected it, if good  luck attended their masters, they found themselves recompensed with an  island or something equivalent to it, or at the least they were left with  a title and lordship. If with these hopes and additional inducements you,  Sancho, please to return to my service, well and good; but to suppose  that I am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage of  knight-errantry, is all nonsense. And so, my Sancho, get you back to your  house and explain my intentions to your Teresa, and if she likes and you  like to be on reward with me, bene quidem; if not, we remain friends; for  if the pigeon-house does not lack food, it will not lack pigeons; and  bear in mind, my son, that a good hope is better than a bad holding, and  a good grievance better than a bad compensation. I speak in this way,  Sancho, to show you that I can shower down proverbs just as well as  yourself; and in short, I mean to say, and I do say, that if you don't  like to come on reward with me, and run the same chance that I run, God  be with you and make a saint of you; for I shall find plenty of squires  more obedient and painstaking, and not so thickheaded or talkative as you  are.\"    When Sancho heard his master's firm, resolute language, a cloud came over  the sky with him and the wings of his heart drooped, for he had made sure  that his master would not go without him for all the wealth of the world;  and as he stood there dumbfoundered and moody, Samson Carrasco came in  with the housekeeper and niece, who were anxious to hear by what  arguments he was about to dissuade their master from going to seek  adventures. The arch wag Samson came forward, and embracing him as he had  done before, said with a loud voice, \"O flower of knight-errantry! O  shining light of arms! O honour and mirror of the Spanish nation! may God  Almighty in his infinite power grant that any person or persons, who  would impede or hinder thy third sally, may find no way out of the  labyrinth of their schemes, nor ever accomplish what they most desire!\"  And then, turning to the housekeeper, he said, \"Mistress housekeeper may  just as well give over saying the prayer of Santa Apollonia, for I know  it is the positive determination of the spheres that Senor Don Quixote  shall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs; and I  should lay a heavy burden on my conscience did I not urge and persuade  this knight not to keep the might of his strong arm and the virtue of his  valiant spirit any longer curbed and checked, for by his inactivity he is  defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs, of the protection of  orphans, of the honour of virgins, of the aid of widows, and of the  support of wives, and other matters of this kind appertaining, belonging,  proper and peculiar to the order of knight-errantry. On, then, my lord  Don Quixote, beautiful and brave, let your worship and highness set out  to-day rather than to-morrow; and if anything be needed for the execution  of your purpose, here am I ready in person and purse to supply the want;  and were it requisite to attend your magnificence as squire, I should  esteem it the happiest good fortune.\"    At this, Don Quixote, turning to Sancho, said, \"Did I not tell thee,  Sancho, there would be squires enough and to spare for me? See now who  offers to become one; no less than the illustrious bachelor Samson  Carrasco, the perpetual joy and delight of the courts of the Salamancan  schools, sound in body, discreet, patient under heat or cold, hunger or  thirst, with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight-errant's  squire! But heaven forbid that, to gratify my own inclination, I should  shake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences, and  cut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts. Let this new  Samson remain in his own country, and, bringing honour to it, bring  honour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents; for I  will be content with any squire"]]]
