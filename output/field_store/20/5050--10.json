It is too soon to attempt to guess the pedestal that posterity will  allot Gabriele D'Annunzio in the gallery of fame. The committee that  will do it will estimate his qualifications of lyric poet and Hellenic  dramatist--perhaps as warrior.    D'Annunzio is a poet who abounds in lyrical ecstacies. His style is the  most remarkable thing about him. He describes armor, architecture,  archaeology like an expert. He knows the dynamic point of view. He knows  how to depict dramatic situations. His personages are all living  personages. He is concerned with the neurotic, decadent, hectic,  temperamental type of human beings. All his characters have a love of  beauty. He is the true decadent of the nineteenth-century literature, to  whom the decadent French symbolists cannot hold a candle.    After he had sucked the luscious orange of Italy dry and eaten of its  pomegranates to satiety; after he had exhausted sensation in the search  for sensation and he could no longer hope for stimulation from vision,  from image, from sound, from color; when the nets of Eros were so  lacerated and worn from having been dragged upon the rocks and crags of  life; when Italian food, though appetizingly spiced and washed down with  rare vintage of the Castelli Romani, would no longer nourish him, he  abandoned his native land and went to France. His writings while in  France were like those of a man who is dominated by a dementia following  a protracted delirium, and as he emerged from this dementia he published  a pietistic piece called \"The Contemplation of Death.\" It seems to have  been suggested to him by the death of the poet Pascoli, for whom he  professed an admiration, but more particularly by Adolfo Bermond, whom  he had met after he went to France and who apparently had been able to  depict the beauties of humility so that they were recognizable to  D'Annunzio. In his fatigued, emotional, and enfeebled mental state he  asked himself whether humility was not more desirable than pride, love  not stronger than hate, spiritual aristocracy more ennobling than  aristocracy of blood, of money, of brain, of privilege. In this state of  mock humility he wrote: \"I always feel above me the presence of the  sacrifice of Christ. I see now that the glory of my life is not in the  beauty of my possessions. I have never felt so miserable and at the same  time so powerful. Never since I lived have I had within me an instinct,  a need so deep and so storming. I am aware that a part of my being,  maybe the best part, is deeply asleep within me.\" But soon this  spiritual awakening was throttled by the influence of Nietzsche. \"What  will become of me if I surrender wholly to the Saviour? Surely I want  the world to know if in my life, filled with base instincts, there comes  the moment of changing. Even if my glory be destroyed I will not be a  prisoner to the worse that speaks within me.\" It was from that hour that  he decided to be the Garibaldi of the third Italy. He would then be  another Gabriel standing in the presence of God and sent to speak to  them and show them glad tidings.    It was a strange awakement that D'Annunzio had when he went to Rome in  the early '90's. Perhaps it was before that time that he encountered  \"L'Ornement des Noces Spirituelles de Ruysbroeck l'Admirable,\" and later  \"La Sagesse et la Destinee,\" and he absorbed some of its aesthetic  mysticism. He realized that it was another variety of search for wisdom  because it is happiness, and he began to portray it in his poetry and  tragedies. From the day he began to write he accustomed himself to take  as it pleased him from others' writings, and not only lines and  paragraphs but subjects, movements, cadences, thoughts, and images which  determined the character and decided the nature of the production.  Italian critics have taken the trouble to return to the original  creators the borrowed constituents of some of his productions,  \"L'Asiatico,\" for instance; and that which then remained was the  caressing modulation of the verses. When his romances appeared in French  many of the passages taken bodily from Dostoievsky, Tolstoy, de  Maupassant, Peladan, de Goncourt, Huysmans, and many others were  prudently suppressed. But no one can fail to recognize that he read  these authors with a keen eye, a note-book by his side. But he has known  how to use what he borrowed. The day came when the conduct of a corrupt  people in a decadent fictitious world no longer sufficed to divert him;  having drunk from the poisoned springs of lust not only to satiety but  to disgust, he, like his prototype of Huysmans's creation, \"Des  Esseintes,\" the Thebaide raffinee of \"A Rebours,\" must hide himself away  far from the world, in some retreat where he might deaden the discordant  sounds of the rumblings of inflexible life, as one deadens the street  with straw where an important or beloved one is sick. This retreat was  Paris and there we must leave him making scenic plays and erudite verse  for a Russian ballerina, and working out his destiny in contemplation of  death and in planning the selection of warriors for Valhalla.    We are not concerned with his conduct or with his morals. We are  concerned with his activities to divert and instruct us, and the  influence that his efforts had upon the people of his time. He wrote  artistically perfect novels; his poetry is the highest form of lyric  expression; he made his dramas the revivification of the elements of  Greek tragedy; and he strove to prove that Eros was unconquerable by  priest, sage, or warrior. Now, with the world in ferment, they are the  only earnest for our acceptation of his assurance that he can shape the  fate of Italy more acceptably than its statesmen.    Before the Great War he had practically passed from the stage of  letters. That epochal occurrence resurrected him. We can wait to hear  what posterity will say of him.          CHAPTER IV    THE FUTURIST SCHOOL OF ITALIAN WRITERS      The Italians are a people of great emotional complexity, displaying a  strange mixture of idealism and realism. They are at present engaged in  constructing an edifice which shall be the admiration of the world for  all time, to wit, a third Italy. Naturally the designers, the  architects, the builders and the prospective inhabitants hope that it  will be more ideal, more commodious, more adapted to its purposes than  its predecessors. To the sympathetic observer, however, they appear to  limit themselves narrowly to old building material.    There is nothing which mirrors the individual and composite mind of a  country so illuminatingly as its literature. The man craving for power  prefers the allegiance of a country's song-writers to that of its  lawgivers. That a tremendous change has taken place to-day, not only in  the songs of Italy but in all her literature, must be admitted. This  change has been in process for a generation and is going on with  increasing rapidity.    Italian literature is now going through a phase quite as distinct as  that which characterized the romanticism initiated by Manzoni and which  ended with the advent of Carducci. It would be difficult to find a word  which would adequately express the spirit of it--perhaps the most  descriptive one is _protest_. The new writers protest against the  social, political, and religious acceptances of the past fifty years.  They object to the acceptance of alleged facts substantiated only by  tradition; they refuse adherence to teachings, doctrines, modes of  thought and expression merely because they are old; they reject dogma  originating in self-constituted authority, no matter how long or by whom  it has been sanctioned and privileged, no matter how securely rooted.  They will have none of the conventionalism which is out of harmony with  the present conditions of life and with the present yearning for  liberty. They stand against the teaching that the flesh must be punished  in order that the soul may be purified, as they do against all slavish  stereotypy, moss-covered convention, and archaic laws.    They claim instead that the best of life is to be found in purposeful  action; that life should be speeded up, and that every one should be  encouraged to live fully for the advantage that may come to himself, to  those to whom he is beholden, and to the world. They advocate the  strenuous life and invite the new and unforeseen, while urging  exploration of untrodden fields and especially determination of things  called inaccessible and unrealizable. They advocate equal life for men  and women, and seek to give to such words as \"patriotism\" and \"idealism\"  a fuller significance, so that the former shall not mean the heroic  idealization of commercial, industrial, and artistic solidarity of a  people but a love of liberty and a knowledge, recognition, and  appreciation of what other people and other countries are attempting and  accomplishing; and that the latter may be applied to the affairs of life  and not to the affairs of the imagination.    This movement, in Italy, was begun by a group of men who called  themselves Futurists and, if that name can be dissociated from the  connotation that is given to it when applied to art, I see no objection  to it. It has been influenced by the French Symbolists of the preceding  generation, Baudelaire, de Goncourt, Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, Mallarme,  Verlaine, Huysmans, Rimbaud, whose work so profoundly influenced the  course of French literature. Like this school the self-styled futuristic  writers of Italy revolt against rhetoric and against tradition.  Therefore they reject equally the ardent classicism of Carducci and  D'Annunzio's decadent blend of idealism and realism, the crass, slavish  Gallicism of Brocchi, the Scandinavian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41990"],[0,"The Cid Campeador: A Historical Romance (#12)"],[1,"losing sight of her, thus filling up her soul with her, if  we may so express ourselves; and it may be said indeed that the maiden  formed part of her being. Thus it was that she wept or smiled when  Ximena wept or smiled, and almost hated or loved according as Ximena did  the one or the other.    \"Do not weep, my darling,\" she said to the young girl, affecting a  calmness which she did not feel; \"do not think any more of your  unfortunate love affairs, for if you keep brooding over them you will be  in your grave before three days are past, and that would be neither good  nor Christian on your part. Let God, who created us, kill us, and let us  not kill ourselves.\"    \"But of what use is life to me?\" replied Ximena, rousing herself from  her meditations.    \"Ave Maria! what a mad question! For what do we preserve our lives but  to be happy?\"    \"Alas, Lambra, you cannot understand that my happiness is now impossible  in this world. How can I be happy without Rodrigo?\"    \"Have you then lost him?\"    \"I have lost him, Lambra. If I feared that I had lost his love, when no  really serious matter justified the hostility between my father and his,  how much stronger are now my reasons for fearing it, when my father, the  Count of Gormaz, has imprinted on the face of his father a stain which  only can be washed off with blood? The hand of my father has opened an  abyss between both our houses.\"    Lambra knew that what Ximena said was only too true, and felt almost  dismayed by the task that was imposed on her--that of consoling and  cheering up the maiden; notwithstanding, she did her best to conceal her  inquietude, and asked--    \"Do you feel confident that Rodrigo loves you?\"    \"I have never doubted it.\"    \"And have you not often heard it said that love conquers all things?\"    \"Yes, Lambra.\"    \"Then do not be disquieted, and trust that the love of Rodrigo may be  able to throw a bridge over the abyss of which you have just spoken, in  order that your house and his may be reconciled and form again but one  family.\"    This reflection, although it was rather sophistical, shed a drop of  balsam on the wound which was torturing the soul of Ximena, into whose  mind flashed, at that moment, a ray of light: \"I shall throw myself on  my knees at the feet of my father,\" thought to herself the daughter of  Don Gome, \"and I shall beseech him to repair the offence which he has  committed against Rodrigo, and if he loves me, he will comply with my  wish.\"    Whilst Ximena was still formulating this request, her father entered the  chamber. By the appearance of his daughter, whose face was still stained  by tears, Don Gome divined her feelings. Such were the marks that grief  had imprinted, in two days, on the visage of Ximena, that the count  could not prevent himself from being deeply moved; for he loved his  child very much, notwithstanding the fact that the evil passions which  had taken possession of his heart were causing her the deepest misery.    \"My daughter!\" he exclaimed, pressing her tenderly in his arms, \"you  weep, and do not try to find consolation and alleviation of your  troubles in me. Do you perchance doubt of the love of your father?\"    \"Ah no, my father!\" answered Ximena, bathed in tears.    \"Do you not know,\" continued the count, with endearing accents,--\"do you  not know, daughter, that, from the time I lost your mother, you have  been the sole being in this world that I have loved? Do you think that I  have no care for your happiness because I have sworn that you never  shall be the bride of the son of De Vivar?\"    \"But, father,\" said the young girl timidly, \"you know that such an oath  destroys my happiness during my entire life.\"    \"It will destroy it, if you do not forget Rodrigo.\"    \"And do you believe that I can forget him? Do you believe that a love  can be forgotten that had its birth almost at the same time that we had  ours? Do you believe that it is possible for a woman to forget a man  like Rodrigo?\"    \"Nothing resists time and injuries received. Those which Diego Lainez  has inflicted on your father are such that your union with his son would  be an unbearable humiliation, not alone to a race like that of De  Gormaz, but even to that of a low-born peasant. He who has so vilely  calumniated me at the Court; he who, for his own aggrandisement, has  lowered me so much in the eyes of the king; he who has robbed me of the  favour of Don Fernando; he who has been so treacherous to his most loyal  friend, deserved that your father should refuse to his son your hand,  and even should strike him in the face before those in whose eyes he had  so humiliated me.\"    \"Consider, my father, that a fatal error may have blinded you. If you do  not wish to commit an unjust act, if you do not desire to enter into a  contest in which both of us may die, you by a lance or sword wound, and  I by the grief which your loss would cause me, make good the insult  which you offered to Diego Lainez in the saloons of the Alcazar, and  forget for ever those which you imagine that you have received from  him\"--    \"Ximena!\" exclaimed the count in a severe tone, \"what advice is this you  dare to give me? If it were another who so counselled me, I would tear  out his tongue. Do you value so little the honour of your father, and do  you consider him such a coward, as to think that he should ask pardon of  him in whose face he would rather spit?\"    The anger which the count exhibited whilst speaking those words  discouraged Ximena, and deprived her of her last hope. The daughter of  Don Gome answered her father with tears alone. He, feeling compassion  for her grief, repented of his sudden burst of indignation, and clasped  her again to his heart, pressing with his lips her pale brow. He felt,  doubtless, that his pride was yielding in presence of his child's grief,  and in order not to desist from his intention of responding with fresh  insults to the reparation which he felt would soon be demanded from him  by De Vivar, he went off from Ximena, who followed him with her eyes to  the door of the chamber as sadly as if it were the last time she should  ever see him.    The king, who desired to bring about the reconciliation of the count  with Diego Lainez, fearful of the fierce strife which otherwise would  blaze up between the partisans of the two noble families, summoned Don  Gome to the Alcazar. At the moment when the count left his house in  order to obey the order of the king, there rode into the square a body  of knights who, apparently, were also proceeding to the Alcazar. Amongst  them was Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, who, as soon as he perceived the count,  separated himself from his companions, and made his way hastily towards  him.    \"Listen, traitrous count, ignoble cavalier!\" he said to him. \"I, Rodrigo  Diaz de Vivar, son of Diego Lainez, whom you wounded on the face, as he  is old and cannot wash away with your blood the stain you put on his  honour, do now challenge you to single combat, in which you will fight  against me; and five knights from amongst my friends shall sustain my  rights against five chosen from your friends, in case either you or I  should fall in the battle. I am about to demand permission for this from  the king.\"    \"Be off, then,\" answered the count, turning his shoulder on the young  man with haughty disdain; \"the Count of Gormaz fights with giants, and  not with boys like you.\"    \"Infamous count! boys have conquered giants,\" responded Rodrigo, with  much difficulty keeping down his anger. \"Remember that David was very  young when he overcame Goliath. If I am a youth in years, I am a giant  in the valour which my outraged honour and your cowardice instil into  me.\"    The count gazed on him with contempt, and proceeded a few steps on his  way. The youth, however, intercepted him, becoming more and more  enraged.    \"Leave me,\" exclaimed at last Don Gome, also filled with anger, \"leave  me at once; for if I wounded your father's face with a blow of my hand,  I shall chastise your insolence with kicks.\"    Those words, and the tone in which they were spoken, exasperated  Rodrigo to the highest pitch, and he exclaimed, placing his hand on his  sword--    \"Defend yourself, villain, defend yourself, or I shall kill you behind  your back, like a traitor and coward as you are!\"    \"You shall not do so, but you shall pay dearly for your audacity,\"  replied the count, unsheathing his sword, and rushing on Rodrigo with  such fury that the young man had scarcely time to place himself on his  guard.    The count was robust and of enormous strength, so great that on account  of it he had gained the name of _Lozano_,[1] by which he was commonly  known, and which both history and tradition have brought down to us.  Rodrigo was of high stature, but very thin, and his strength was not yet  developed. Thus it was that, the physical powers of the two combatants  not being equalised by defensive and offensive arms,--as was usual in  solemn combats, when there was great disproportion in the strength of  the two parties,--the spectators considered the victory of the count as  certain. Those present consisted not only of the retinue which had  accompanied Rodrigo, but also of a large number of persons whom the  clashing of the swords had attracted to the windows and balconies of the  buildings which surrounded the square, or who had flowed in through the  streets that led to it. Amongst those spectators was the king, Don  Fernando himself, who appeared on a balcony of the Alcazar just as the  fate of the combatants was about to be decided. They were fighting with  a fury not often seen; the strokes of the count were terrible from the  force with which they were dealt, but Rodrigo avoided them with an  agility and dexterity that could scarcely be expected from him,  considering the limited practice he had had in warlike exercises, which  only consisted in his having broken a few lances at"]]]
