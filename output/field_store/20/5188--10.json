This man, who appeared to his contemporaries a visionary, and elixir  of moonbeams, no doubt led the most real life of any man then in the  world: and now, when the royal and ducal Frederics, Cristierns, and  Brunswicks, of that day, have slid into oblivion, he begins to spread  himself into the minds of thousands. As happens in great men, he seemed,  by the variety and amount of his powers, to be a composition of several  persons,--like the giant fruits which are matured in gardens by the  union of four or five single blossoms. His frame is on a larger scale,  and possesses the advantage of size. As it is easier to see the  reflection of the great sphere in large globes, though defaced by some  crack or blemish, than in drops of water, so men of large calibre,  though with some eccentricity or madness, like Pascal or Newton, help  us more than balanced mediocre minds.    His youth and training could not fail to be extraordinary. Such a boy  could not whistle or dance, but goes grubbing into mines and mountains,  prying into chemistry and optics, physiology, mathematics, and  astronomy, to find images fit for the measure of his versatile and  capacious brain. He was a scholar from a child, and was educated at  Upsala. At the age of twenty-eight, he was made Assessor of the Board  of Mines, by Charles XII. In 1716, he left home for four years, and  visited the universities of England, Holland, France, and Germany. He  performed a notable feat of engineering in 1718, at the siege of  Fredericshall, by hauling two galleys, five boats, and a sloop, some  fourteen English miles overland, for the royal service. In 1721 he  journeyed over Europe, to examine mines and smelting works. He  published, in 1716, his Daedalus Hyperboreus, and, from this time, for  the next thirty years, was employed in the composition and publication  of his scientific works. With the like force, he threw himself into  theology. In 1743, when he was fifty-four years old, what is called  his illumination began. All his metallurgy, and transportation of ships  overland, was absorbed into this ecstasy. He ceased to publish any  more scientific books, withdrew from his practical labors, and devoted  himself to the writing and publication of his voluminous theological  works, which were printed at his own expense, or at that of the Duke  of Brunswick, or other prince, at Dresden, Liepsic, London, or  Amsterdam. Later, he resigned his office of Assessor: the salary  attached to this office continued to be paid to him during his life.  His duties had brought him into intimate acquaintance with King Charles  XII., by whom he was much consulted and honored. The like favor was  continued to him by his successor. At the Diet of 1751, Count Hopken  says, the most solid memorials on finance were from his pen. In Sweden,  he appears to have attracted a marked regard. His rare science and  practical skill, and the added fame of second sight and extraordinary  religious knowledge and gifts, drew to him queens, nobles, clergy,  shipmasters, and people about the ports through which he was wont to  pass in his many voyages. The clergy interfered a little with the  importation and publication of his religious works; but he seems to  have kept the friendship of men in power. He was never married. He had  great modesty and gentleness of bearing. His habits were simple; he  lived on bread, milk, and vegetables; and he lived in a house situated  in a large garden; he went several times to England, where he does not  seem to have attracted any attention whatever from the learned or the  eminent; and died at London, March 29, 1772, of apoplexy, in his  eighty-fifth year. He is described, when in London, as a man of quiet,  clerical habit, not averse to tea and coffee, and kind to children.  He wore a sword when in full velvet dress, and, whenever he walked  out, carried a gold-headed cane. There is a common portrait of him in  antique coat and wig, but the face has a wandering or vacant air.    The genius which was to penetrate the science of the age with a far  more subtle science; to pass the bounds of space and time; venture  into the dim spirit-realm, and attempt to establish a new religion in  the world,--began its lessons in quarries and forges, in the  smelting-pot and crucible, in ship-yards and dissecting-rooms. No one  man is perhaps able to judge of the merits of his works on so many  subjects. One is glad to learn that his books on mines and metals are  held in the highest esteem by those who understand these matters. It  seems that he anticipated much science of the nineteenth century;  anticipated, in astronomy, the discovery of the seventh planet,--but,  unhappily, not also of the eighth; anticipated the views of modern  astronomy in regard to the generation of earth by the sun; in magnetism,  some important experiments and conclusions of later students; in  chemistry, the atomic theory; in anatomy, the discoveries of  Schlichting, Monro, and Wilson; and first demonstrated the office of  the lungs. His excellent English editor magnanimously lays no stress  on his discoveries, since he was too great to care to be original; and  we are to judge, by what he can spare, of what remains.    A colossal soul, he lies vast abroad on his times, uncomprehended by  them, and requires a long local distance to be seen; suggest, as  Aristotle, Bacon, Selden, Humboldt, that a certain vastness of learning,  or _quasi_ omnipresence of the human soul in nature, is possible.  His superb speculations, as from a tower, over nature and arts, without  ever losing sight of the texture and sequence of things, almost realizes  his own picture, in the \"Principia,\" of the original integrity of man.  Over and above the merit of his particular discoveries, is the capital  merit of his self-equality. A drop of water has the properties of the  sea, but cannot exhibit a storm. There is beauty of a concert, as well  as of a flute; strength of a host, as well as of a hero; and, in  Swedenborg, those who are best acquainted with modern books, will most  admire the merit of mass. One of the missouriums and mastodons of  literature, he is not to be measured by whole colleges of ordinary  scholars. His stalwart presence would flutter the gowns of an  university. Our books are false by being fragmentary; their sentences  are _bon mots_, and not parts of natural discourse; childish expressions  of surprise or pleasure in nature; or, worse, owing a brief notoriety to  their petulance, or aversion from the order of nature,--being some  curiosity or oddity, designedly not in harmony with nature, and  purposely framed to excite a surprise, as jugglers do by concealing  their means. But Swedenborg is systematic, and respective of the world  in every sentence; all the means are orderly given; his faculties work  with astronomic punctuality, and this admirable writing is pure from all  pertness or egotism.    Swedenborg was born into an atmosphere of great ideas. 'Tis hard to  say what was his own: yet his life was dignified by noblest pictures  of the universe. The robust Aristotelian method, with its breadth and  adequateness, shaming our sterile and linear logic by its genial  radiation, conversant with series and degree, with effects and ends,  skilful to discriminate power from form, essence from accident, and  opening by its terminology and definition, high roads into nature, had  trained a race of athletic philosophers. Harvey had shown the  circulation of the blood; Gilbert had shown that the earth was a magnet;  Descartes, taught by Gilbert's magnet, with its vortex, spiral, and  polarity, had filled Europe with the leading thought of vortical motion,  as the secret of nature. Newton, in the year in which Swedenborg was  born, published the \"Principia,\" and established the universal gravity.  Malpighi, following the high doctrines of Hippocrates, Leucippus, and  Lucretius, had given emphasis to the dogma that nature works in  leasts,--\"_tota in minimis existit natura_.\" Unrivalled dissectors,  Swammerdam, Leeuwenhoek, Winslow, Eustachius, Heister, Vesalius,  Boerhaave, had left nothing for scalpel or microscope to reveal in  human or comparative anatomy; Linnaeus, his contemporary, was affirming,  in his beautiful science, that \"Nature is always like herself;\" and,  lastly, the nobility of method, the largest application of principles,  had been exhibited by Leibnitz and Christian Wolff, in cosmology;  whilst Locke and Grotius had drawn the moral argument. What was left  for a genius of the largest calibre, but to go over their ground, and  verify and unite? It is easy to see, in these minds, the original of  Swedenborg's studies, and the suggestion of his problems. He had a  capacity to entertain and vivify these volumes of thought. Yet the  proximity of these geniuses, one or other of whom had introduced all  his leading ideas, makes Swedenborg another example of the difficulty,  even in a highly fertile genius, of proving originality, the first  birth and annunciation of one of the laws of nature.    He named his favorite views, the doctrine of Forms, the doctrine of  Series and Degrees, the doctrine of Influx, the doctrine of  Correspondence. His statement of these doctrines deserves to be studied  in his books. Not every man can read them, but they will reward him  who can. His theologic works are valuable to illustrate these. His  writings would be a sufficient library to a lonely and athletic student;  and the \"Economy of the Animal Kingdom\" is one of those books which,  by the sustained dignity of thinking, is an honor to the human race.  He had studied spars and metals to some purpose. His varied and solid  knowledge makes his style lustrous with points and shooting spicula  of thought, and resembling one of those winter mornings when the air  sparkles with crystals. The grandeur of the topics makes the grandeur  of the style. He was apt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6317"],[0,"Sailing Alone Around the World (#12)"],[1,"in a strong current, with other difficult and  unusual conditions. Captain Howard took all this into account.    In all the years away from his native home Howard had not forgotten  the art of making fish chowders; and to prove this he brought along  some fine rockfish and prepared a mess fit for kings. When the savory  chowder was done, chocking the pot securely between two boxes on the  cabin floor, so that it could not roll over, we helped ourselves and  swapped yarns over it while the _Spray_ made her own way through the  darkness on the river. Howard told me stories about the Fuegian  cannibals as she reeled along, and I told him about the pilot of the  _Pinta_ steering my vessel through the storm off the coast of the  Azores, and that I looked for him at the helm in a gale such as this.  I do not charge Howard with superstition,--we are none of us  superstitious,--but when I spoke about his returning to Montevideo on  the _Spray_ he shook his head and took a steam-packet instead.    I had not been in Buenos Aires for a number of years. The place where  I had once landed from packets, in a cart, was now built up with  magnificent docks. Vast fortunes had been spent in remodeling the  harbor; London bankers could tell you that. The port captain, after  assigning the _Spray_ a safe berth, with his compliments, sent me word  to call on him for anything I might want while in port, and I felt  quite sure that his friendship was sincere. The sloop was well cared  for at Buenos Aires; her dockage and tonnage dues were all free, and  the yachting fraternity of the city welcomed her with a good will. In  town I found things not so greatly changed as about the docks, and I  soon felt myself more at home.    From Montevideo I had forwarded a letter from Sir Edward Hairby to the  owner of the \"Standard,\" Mr. Mulhall, and in reply to it was assured  of a warm welcome to the warmest heart, I think, outside of Ireland.  Mr. Mulhall, with a prancing team, came down to the docks as soon as  the _Spray_ was berthed, and would have me go to his house at once,  where a room was waiting. And it was New Year's day, 1896. The course  of the Spray had been followed in the columns of the \"Standard.\"    Mr. Mulhall kindly drove me to see many improvements about the city,  and we went in search of some of the old landmarks. The man who sold  \"lemonade\" on the plaza when first I visited this wonderful city I  found selling lemonade still at two cents a glass; he had made a  fortune by it. His stock in trade was a wash-tub and a neighboring  hydrant, a moderate supply of brown sugar, and about six lemons that  floated on the sweetened water. The water from time to time was  renewed from the friendly pump, but the lemon \"went on forever,\" and  all at two cents a glass.    [Illustration: At the sign of the comet.]    But we looked in vain for the man who once sold whisky and coffins in  Buenos Aires; the march of civilization had crushed him--memory only  clung to his name. Enterprising man that he was, I fain would have  looked him up. I remember the tiers of whisky-barrels, ranged on end,  on one side of the store, while on the other side, and divided by a  thin partition, were the coffins in the same order, of all sizes and  in great numbers. The unique arrangement seemed in order, for as a  cask was emptied a coffin might be filled. Besides cheap whisky and  many other liquors, he sold \"cider,\" which he manufactured from  damaged Malaga raisins. Within the scope of his enterprise was also  the sale of mineral waters, not entirely blameless of the germs of  disease. This man surely catered to all the tastes, wants, and  conditions of his customers.    Farther along in the city, however, survived the good man who wrote on  the side of his store, where thoughtful men might read and learn:  \"This wicked world will be destroyed by a comet! The owner of this  store is therefore bound to sell out at any price and avoid the  catastrophe.\" My friend Mr. Mulhall drove me round to view the fearful  comet with streaming tail pictured large on the trembling merchant's  walls.    I unshipped the sloop's mast at Buenos Aires and shortened it by seven  feet. I reduced the length of the bowsprit by about five feet, and  even then I found it reaching far enough from home; and more than  once, when on the end of it reefing the jib, I regretted that I had  not shortened it another foot.

On January 26, 1896, the _Spray_, being refitted and well provisioned  in every way, sailed from Buenos Aires. There was little wind at the  start; the surface of the great river was like a silver disk, and I  was glad of a tow from a harbor tug to clear the port entrance. But a  gale came up soon after, and caused an ugly sea, and instead of being  all silver, as before, the river was now all mud. The Plate is a  treacherous place for storms. One sailing there should always be on  the alert for squalls. I cast anchor before dark in the best lee I  could find near the land, but was tossed miserably all night,  heartsore of choppy seas. On the following morning I got the sloop  under way, and with reefed sails worked her down the river against a  head wind. Standing in that night to the place where pilot Howard  joined me for the up-river sail, I took a departure, shaping my course  to clear Point Indio on the one hand, and the English Bank on the  other.    [Illustration: A great wave off the Patagonian coast]    I had not for many years been south of these regions. I will not say  that I expected all fine sailing on the course for Cape Horn direct,  but while I worked at the sails and rigging I thought only of onward  and forward. It was when I anchored in the lonely places that a  feeling of awe crept over me. At the last anchorage on the monotonous  and muddy river, weak as it may seem, I gave way to my feelings. I  resolved then that I would anchor no more north of the Strait of  Magellan.    On the 28th of January the _Spray_ was clear of Point Indio, English  Bank, and all the other dangers of the River Plate. With a fair wind  she then bore away for the Strait of Magellan, under all sail,  pressing farther and farther toward the wonderland of the South, till  I forgot the blessings of our milder North.    My ship passed in safety Bahia Blanca, also the Gulf of St. Matias and  the mighty Gulf of St. George. Hoping that she might go clear of the  destructive tide-races, the dread of big craft or little along this  coast, I gave all the capes a berth of about fifty miles, for these  dangers extend many miles from the land. But where the sloop avoided  one danger she encountered another. For, one day, well off the  Patagonian coast, while the sloop was reaching under short sail, a  tremendous wave, the culmination, it seemed, of many waves, rolled  down upon her in a storm, roaring as it came. I had only a moment to  get all sail down and myself up on the peak halliards, out of danger,  when I saw the mighty crest towering masthead-high above me. The  mountain of water submerged my vessel. She shook in every timber and  reeled under the weight of the sea, but rose quickly out of it, and  rode grandly over the rollers that followed. It may have been a minute  that from my hold in the rigging I could see no part of the _Spray's_  hull. Perhaps it was even less time than that, but it seemed a long  while, for under great excitement one lives fast, and in a few seconds  one may think a great deal of one's past life. Not only did the past,  with electric speed, flash before me, but I had time while in my  hazardous position for resolutions for the future that would take a  long time to fulfil. The first one was, I remember, that if the  _Spray_ came through this danger I would dedicate my best energies  to building a larger ship on her lines, which I hope yet to do. Other  promises, less easily kept, I should have made under protest. However,  the incident, which filled me with fear, was only one more test of the  _Spray's_ seaworthiness. It reassured me against rude Cape Horn.    From the time the great wave swept over the _Spray_ until she reached  Cape Virgins nothing occurred to move a pulse and set blood in motion.  On the contrary, the weather became fine and the sea smooth and life  tranquil. The phenomenon of mirage frequently occurred. An albatross  sitting on the water one day loomed up like a large ship; two  fur-seals asleep on the surface of the sea appeared like great whales,  and a bank of haze I could have sworn was high land. The kaleidescope  then changed, and on the following day I sailed in a world peopled by  dwarfs.    [Illustration: Entrance to the Strait of Magellan.]    On February 11 the _Spray_ rounded Cape Virgins and entered the Strait  of Magellan. The scene was again real and gloomy; the wind, northeast,  and blowing a gale, sent feather-white spume along the coast; such a  sea ran as would swamp an ill-appointed ship. As the sloop neared the  entrance to the strait I observed that two great tide-races made  ahead, one very close to the point of the land and one farther  offshore. Between the two, in a sort of channel, through combers, went  the _Spray_ with close-reefed sails. But a rolling sea followed her a  long way in, and a fierce current swept around the cape against her;  but this she stemmed, and was soon chirruping under the lee of Cape  Virgins and running every minute into smoother water. However, long  trailing kelp from sunken rocks waved forebodingly under her keel, and  the wreck of a great steamship smashed on the beach abreast gave"]]]
