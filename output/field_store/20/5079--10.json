They were the  first to declare, with Petion, that the vanquished parties  should perish.  They also, according to M. Aulard, attempted to  justify the massacres of September.  The Terror must not be  considered simply as a means of defence, but as the general  process of destruction to which triumphant believers have always  treated their detested enemies.  Men who can put up with the  greatest divergence of ideas cannot tolerate differences of  belief.    In religious or political warfare the vanquished can hope for no  quarter.  From Sulla, who cut the throats of two hundred senators  and five or six thousand Romans, to the men who suppressed the  Commune, and shot down more than twenty thousand after  their victory, this bloody law has never failed.  Proved over and  over again in the past, it will doubtless be so in the future.    The hatreds of the Revolution did not arise entirely from  divergence of belief.  Other sentiments--envy, ambition, and  self-love--also engendered them.  The rivalry of individuals  aspiring to power led the chiefs of the various groups in  succession to the scaffold.    We must remember, moreover, that the need of division and the  hatred resulting therefrom seem to be constituent elements of the  Latin mind.  They cost our Gaulish ancestors their independence,  and had already struck Caesar.    ``No city,'' he said, ``but was divided into two factions; no  canton, no village, no house in which the spirit of party did not  breathe.  It was very rarely that a year went by without a city  taking up arms to attack or repulse its neighbours.''    As man has only recently entered upon the age of knowledge, and  has always hitherto been guided by sentiments and beliefs, we may  conceive the vast importance of hatred as a factor of his  history.    Commandant Colin, professor at the College of War, remarks in the  following terms on the importance of this feeling during certain  wars:--    ``In war more than at any other time there is no better inspiring  force than hatred; it was hatred that made Blucher victorious  over Napoleon.  Analyse the most wonderful manoeuvres, the most  decisive operations, and if they are not the work of an  exceptional man, a Frederick or a Napoleon, you will find they  are inspired by passion more than by calculation.  What  would the war of 1870 have been without the hatred which we bore  the Germans?''    The writer might have added that the intense hatred of the  Japanese for the Russians, who had so humiliated them, might be  classed among the causes of their success.  The Russian soldiers,  ignorant of the very existence of the Japanese, had no animosity  against them, which was one of the reasons of their failure.    There was assuredly a good deal of talk of fraternity at the time  of the Revolution, and there is even more to-day.  Pacificism,  humanitarianism, and solidarity have become catchwords of the  advanced parties, but we know how profound are the hatreds  concealed beneath these terms, and what dangers overhang our  modern society.    Fear.--Fear plays almost as large a part in revolutions as  hatred.  During the French Revolution there were many examples of  great individual courage and many exhibitions of collective  cowardice.    Facing the scaffold, the men of the Convention were always brave  in the extreme; but before the threats of the rioters who invaded  the Assembly they constantly exhibited an excessive  pusillanimity, obeying the most absurd injunctions, as we shall  see if we re-read the history of the revolutionary Assemblies.    All the forms of fear were observed at this period.  One of the  most widespread was the fear of appearing moderate.  Members of  the Assemblies, public prosecutors, representatives ``on  mission,'' judges of the revolutionary tribunals, &c., all sought  to appear more advanced than their rivals.  Fear was one of the  principal elements of the crimes committed at this period.  If by some miracle it could have been eliminated from the  revolutionary Assemblies, their conduct would have been quite  other than it was, and the Revolution itself would have taken a  very different direction.    Ambition, Envy, Vanity, &c.--In normal times the influence of  these various affective elements is forcibly contained by social  necessities.  Ambition, for instance, is necessarily limited in a  hierarchical form of society.  Although the soldier does  sometimes become a general, it is only after a long term of  service.  In time of revolution, on the other hand, there is no  need to wait.  Every one may reach the upper ranks almost  immediately, so that all ambitions are violently aroused.  The  humblest man believes himself fitted for the highest employments,  and by this very fact his vanity grows out of all measure.    All the passions being more or less aroused, including ambition  and vanity, we see the development of jealousy and envy of those  who have succeeded more quickly than others.    The effect of jealousy, always important in times of revolution,  was especially so during the great French Revolution.  Jealousy  of the nobility constituted one of its most important factors.  The middle classes had increased in capacity and wealth, to the  point of surpassing the nobility.  Although they mingled with the  nobles more and more, they felt, none the less, that they were  held at a distance, and this they keenly resented.  This frame of  mind had unconsciously made the bourgeoisie keen supporters of  the philosophic doctrine of equality.    Wounded self-love and jealousy were thus the causes of  hatreds that we can scarcely conceive today, when the social  influence of the nobility is so small.  Many members of the  Convention--Carrier, Marat, and others--remembered with anger  that they had once occupied subordinate positions in the  establishments of great nobles.  Mme. Roland was never able to  forget that, when she and her mother were invited to the house of  a great lady under the ancien regime, they had been sent to  dine in the servants' quarters.    The philosopher Rivarol has very well described in the following  passage, already cited by Taine, the influence of wounded self-  love and jealousy upon the revolutionary hatreds:--    ``It is not,'' he writes, ``the taxes, nor the lettres de  cachet, nor any of the other abuses of authority; it is not the  sins of the intendants, nor the long and ruinous delays of  justice, that has most angered the nation; it is the prejudices  of the nobility for which it has exhibited the greatest hatred.  What proves this clearly is the fact that it is the bourgeois,  the men of letters, the men of money, in fact all those who are  jealous of the nobility, who have raised the poorer inhabitants  of the cities against them, and the peasants in the country  districts.''    This very true statement partly justifies the saying of Napoleon:    ``Vanity made the Revolution; liberty was only the pretext.''    Enthusiasm.--The enthusiasm of the founders of the Revolution  equalled that of the apostles of the faith of Mohammed.  And it  was really a religion that the bourgeois of the first Assembly  thought to found.  They thought to have destroyed an old  world, and to have built a new one upon its ruins.  Never  did illusion more seductive fire the hearts of men.  Equality and  fraternity, proclaimed by the new dogmas, were to bring the reign  of eternal happiness to all the peoples.  Man had broken for ever  with a past of barbarity and darkness.  The regenerated world  would in future be illuminated by the lucid radiance of pure  reason.  On all hands the most brilliant oratorical formulae  saluted the expected dawn.    That this enthusiasm was so soon replaced by violence was due to  the fact that the awakening was speedy and terrible.  One can  readily conceive the indignant fury with which the apostles of  the Revolution attacked the daily obstacles opposed to the  realisation of their dreams.  They had sought to reject the past,  to forget tradition, to make man over again.  But the past  reappeared incessantly, and men refused to change.  The  reformers, checked in their onward march, would not give in.  They sought to impose by force a dictatorship which speedily made  men regret the system abolished, and finally led to its return.    It is to be remarked that although the enthusiasm of the first  days did not last in the revolutionary Assemblies, it survived  very much longer in the armies, and constituted their chief  strength.  To tell the truth, the armies of the Revolution were  republican long before France became so, and remained republican  long after France had ceased to be so.    The variations of character considered in this chapter, being  conditioned by certain common aspirations and identical changes  of environment, finally became concrete in a small number  of fairly homogeneous mentalities.  Speaking only of the more  characteristic, we may refer them to four types: the Jacobin,  mystic, revolutionary, and criminal mentalities.        CHAPTER II    THE MYSTIC MENTALITY AND THE JACOBIN MENTALITY    1.  Classification of Mentalities predominant in Time of  Revolution.    The classifications without which the study of the sciences is  impossible must necessarily establish the discontinuous in the  continuous, and for that reason are to a certain extent  artificial.  But they are necessary, since the continuous is only  accessible in the form of the discontinuous.    To create broad distinctions between the various mentalities  observable in time of revolution, as we are about to do, is  obviously to separate elements which encroach upon one another,  which are fused or superimposed.  We must resign ourselves to  losing a little in exactitude in order to gain in lucidity.  The  fundamental types enumerated at the end of the preceding chapter,  and which we are about to describe, synthetise groups which would  escape "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44896"],[0,"The Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt (#12)"],[1,"from my Church, for the same are  overcome of the world; wherefore, let every man beware, lest he do  that which is not in truth and righteousness before me.    \"And now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit, unto the Elders of  His Church, and let us reason together, that ye may understand: Let  us reason--even as a man reasoneth--one with another, face to face;  now, when a man reasoneth, he is understood of man, because he  reasoneth as a man; even so will I, the Lord, reason with you, that  you may understand: wherefore, I, the Lord, asketh you this  question, unto what were ye ordained? To preach my gospel by the  Spirit, even the Comforter which was sent forth to teach the truth;  and then received ye spirits which ye could not understand, and  received them to be of God, and in this are ye justified? Behold,  ye shall answer this question yourselves; nevertheless, I will be  merciful unto you; he that is weak among you, hereafter, shall be  made strong.    \"Verily, I say unto you, he that is ordained of me and sent  forth to preach the word of truth by the Comforter, in the spirit  of truth, doth he preach it by the spirit of truth, or some other  way? And if it be by some other way, it be not of God. And, again,  he that receiveth the word of truth, doth he receive it by the  spirit of truth, or some other way? If it be some other way, it be  not of God; therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand, and  know that he that receiveth the word by the spirit of truth,  receiveth it as it is preached by the spirit of truth?    \"Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth,  understandeth one another, and both are edified and rejoice  together; and that which doth not edify, is not of God, and is  darkness; that which is of God is light, and he that receiveth  light and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light  groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day. And, again,  verily I say unto you, and I say it that you may know the truth,  that you may chase darkness from among you; for he that is ordained  of God and sent forth, the same is appointed to be the greatest,  notwithstanding he is least, and the servant of all; wherefore, he  is possessor of all things, for all things are subject unto him,  both in Heaven and on the earth; the life and the light, the spirit  and the power sent forth by the will of the Father through Jesus  Christ, His Son; but no man is possessor of all things, except he  be purified and cleansed from all sin; and if ye are purified and  cleansed from all sin, ye shall ask whatsoever you will in the name  of Jesus, and it shall be done; but, know this, it shall be given  you what you shall ask, and as ye are appointed to the head, the  spirits shall be subject unto you.    \"Wherefore, it shall come to pass, that if you behold a spirit  manifested that you cannot understand, and you receive not that  spirit, ye shall ask of the Father in the name of Jesus, and if he  give not unto you that spirit, that you may know that it is not of  God; and it shall be given unto you power over that spirit, and you  shall proclaim against that spirit with a loud voice, that it is  not of God; not with railing accusation, that ye be not overcome;  neither with boasting, nor rejoicing, lest you be seized therewith;  he that receiveth of God, let him account it of God, and let him  rejoice that he is accounted of God worthy to receive, and by  giving heed and doing these things which ye have received, and  which ye shall hereafter receive, and the kingdom is given you of  the Father, and power to overcome all things which is not ordained  of Him; and, behold, verily I say unto you, blessed are you who are  now hearing these words of mine from the mouth of my servant, for  your sins are forgiven you.    \"Let my servant, Joseph Wakefield, in whom I am pleased, and my  servant, Parley P. Pratt, go forth among the churches and  strengthen them by the word of exhortation; and also my servant,  John Corrill, or as many of my servants as are ordained unto this  office, and let them labor in the vineyard; and let no man hinder  them of doing that which I have appointed unto them; wherefore, in  this thing, my servant, Edward Partridge, is not justified;  nevertheless, let him repent and he shall be forgiven. Behold, ye  are little children, and ye cannot bear all things now; ye must  grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth. Fear not, little  children, for you are mine, and I have overcome the world, and you  are of them that my Father hath given me; and none of them that my  Father hath given me shall be lost; and the Father and I are one. I  am in the Father and the Father in me; and, inasmuch as ye have  received me, ye are in me and I in you; wherefore, I am in your  midst, and I am the good Shepherd (and the stone of Israel; he that  buildeth upon this rock shall never fall), and the day cometh that  you shall hear my voice and see me, and know that I am. Watch,  therefore, that ye may be ready; even so. Amen.\"    In obedience to the foregoing, Joseph Wakefield and myself  visited the several branches of the Church, rebuking the wrong  spirits which had crept in among them, setting in order things that  were wanting; ordaining Elders and other officers; baptizing such  as believed and repented of their sins; administering the gift of  the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, in the name of Jesus  Christ; laying hands on little children and blessing them; praying  for the sick, and comforting the afflicted, etc. On some occasions  we assembled fifty or sixty little children in one circle, in the  midst of the assembly of the saints, and laid our hands upon them  all, and prayed for them, and blessed them in the name of Jesus.    Thus my time passed sweetly and swiftly away for some weeks. I  was sometimes in the society of President Smith, in Kirtland, and  of the saints in that place, and sometimes in the branches abroad.    About this time a young lady, by the name of Chloe Smith, being  a member of the Church, was lying very low with a lingering fever,  with a family who occupied one of the houses on the farm of Isaac  Morley, in Kirtland. Many of the Church had visited and prayed with  her, but all to no effect; she seemed at the point of death, but  would not consent to have a physician. This greatly enraged her  relatives, who had cast her out because she belonged to the Church,  and who, together with many of the people of the neighborhood, were  greatly stirred up to anger, saying, \"these wicked deceivers will  let her lie and die without a physician, because of their  superstitions; and if they do, we will prosecute them for so  doing.\" Now these were daily watching for her last breath, with  many threats.    Under these circumstances, President Smith and myself, with  several other Elders called to see her. She was so low that no one  had been allowed for some days previous to speak above a whisper,  and even the door of the log dwelling was muffled with cloths to  prevent a noise.    We kneeled down and prayed vocally all around, each in turn;  after which President Smith arose, went to the bedside, took her by  the hand, and said unto her with a loud voice, \"in the name of  Jesus Christ arise and walk!\" She immediately arose, was dressed by  a woman in attendance, when she walked to a chair before the fire,  and was seated and joined in singing a hymn. The house was thronged  with people in a few moments, and the young lady arose and shook  hands with each as they came in; and from that minute she was  perfectly restored to health.    Some time in May, 1831, the Church arrived with their families  from the State of New York, to settle in Kirtland; but, to my  inexpressible disappointment, my wife had not come with them, but  had gone to spend the summer in the East with her friends. It was  now too late to go to her, as the time was near when I was in duty  bound to return to my fellow laborers in Missouri. To be so long  absent from her, and then undertake a second journey without seeing  her, was a severe trial, but God gave me grace to overcome my  feelings, for his sake and the gospel's.      CHAPTER X.  ------------------------    Conference at Kirtland:--Revelation of the High  Priesthood:--Ordinations to the Same:--Appointment of  Missions through the Western States:--Return Westward,  Accompanied by my Brother Orson:--Our Success by the  Way:--Arrival at the Frontiers:--Sickness:--Remarkable  Conversion of Newel Knight:--A Dream.    On the sixth of June, 1831, a general conference was convened at  Kirtland, consisting of all the Elders, far and near, who could be  got together. In this conference much instruction was given by  President Smith, who spake in great power, as he was moved by the  Holy Ghost; and the spirit of power and of testimony rested down  upon the Elders in a marvelous manner. Here also were some strange  manifestations of false spirits, which were immediately rebuked.    Several were then selected by revelation, through President  Smith, and ordained to the High Priesthood after the order of the  Son of God, which is after the order of Melchizedek. This was the  first occasion in which this priesthood had been revealed and  conferred upon the Elders in this dispensation, although the office  of an Elder is the same in a certain degree, but not in the  fullness. On this occasion I was ordained to this holy ordinance  and calling by President Smith.    After these things, and the business of the conference was over,  myself and Orson Pratt were appointed by revelation to perform a  mission together, through the Western States, and to meet the  brethren I had left in Jackson County, Missouri; and many others  also who were sent in a similar manner, two and two through the  Western States, and who were all appointed to meet in Jackson  County, Missouri, and hold the next conference.*    [Footnote] *See revelation, Book of Doctrine"]]]
