For this reason, the word 'innate' would not now be  employed to describe our knowledge of logical principles. The phrase  '_a priori_' is less objectionable, and is more usual in modern writers.  Thus, while admitting that all knowledge is elicited and caused by  experience, we shall nevertheless hold that some knowledge is _a  priori_, in the sense that the experience which makes us think of it  does not suffice to prove it, but merely so directs our attention that  we see its truth without requiring any proof from experience.    There is another point of great importance, in which the empiricists  were in the right as against the rationalists. Nothing can be known to  _exist_ except by the help of experience. That is to say, if we wish to  prove that something of which we have no direct experience exists, we  must have among our premisses the existence of one or more things of  which we have direct experience. Our belief that the Emperor of China  exists, for example, rests upon testimony, and testimony consists,  in the last analysis, of sense-data seen or heard in reading or being  spoken to. Rationalists believed that, from general consideration as  to what must be, they could deduce the existence of this or that in the  actual world. In this belief they seem to have been mistaken. All the  knowledge that we can acquire _a priori_ concerning existence seems  to be hypothetical: it tells us that if one thing exists, another must  exist, or, more generally, that if one proposition is true, another must  be true. This is exemplified by the principles we have already dealt  with, such as '_if_ this is true, and this implies that, then that is  true', or '_if_ this and that have been repeatedly found connected, they  will probably be connected in the next instance in which one of them is  found'. Thus the scope and power of _a priori_ principles is strictly  limited. All knowledge that something exists must be in part dependent  on experience. When anything is known immediately, its existence is  known by experience alone; when anything is proved to exist, without  being known immediately, both experience and _a priori_ principles must  be required in the proof. Knowledge is called _empirical_ when it rests  wholly or partly upon experience. Thus all knowledge which asserts  existence is empirical, and the only _a priori_ knowledge concerning  existence is hypothetical, giving connexions among things that exist or  may exist, but not giving actual existence.    _A priori_ knowledge is not all of the logical kind we have been  hitherto considering. Perhaps the most important example of non-logical  _a priori_ knowledge is knowledge as to ethical value. I am not speaking  of judgements as to what is useful or as to what is virtuous, for such  judgements do require empirical premisses; I am speaking of judgements  as to the intrinsic desirability of things. If something is useful, it  must be useful because it secures some end; the end must, if we have  gone far enough, be valuable on its own account, and not merely because  it is useful for some further end. Thus all judgements as to what is  useful depend upon judgements as to what has value on its own account.    We judge, for example, that happiness is more desirable than misery,  knowledge than ignorance, goodwill than hatred, and so on. Such  judgements must, in part at least, be immediate and _a priori_. Like our  previous _a priori_ judgements, they may be elicited by experience, and  indeed they must be; for it seems not possible to judge whether anything  is intrinsically valuable unless we have experienced something of  the same kind. But it is fairly obvious that they cannot be proved by  experience; for the fact that a thing exists or does not exist cannot  prove either that it is good that it should exist or that it is bad. The  pursuit of this subject belongs to ethics, where the impossibility of  deducing what ought to be from what is has to be established. In the  present connexion, it is only important to realize that knowledge as to  what is intrinsically of value is _a priori_ in the same sense in  which logic is _a priori_, namely in the sense that the truth of such  knowledge can be neither proved nor disproved by experience.    All pure mathematics is _a priori_, like logic. This was strenuously  denied by the empirical philosophers, who maintained that experience was  as much the source of our knowledge of arithmetic as of our knowledge of  geography. They maintained that by the repeated experience of seeing two  things and two other things, and finding that altogether they made four  things, we were led by induction to the conclusion that two things  and two other things would _always_ make four things altogether. If,  however, this were the source of our knowledge that two and two are  four, we should proceed differently, in persuading ourselves of its  truth, from the way in which we do actually proceed. In fact, a certain  number of instances are needed to make us think of two abstractly,  rather than of two coins or two books or two people, or two of any other  specified kind. But as soon as we are able to divest our thoughts of  irrelevant particularity, we become able to see the general principle  that two and two are four; any one instance is seen to be _typical_, and  the examination of other instances becomes unnecessary.(1)    (1) Cf. A. N. Whitehead, _Introduction to Mathematics_ (Home University  Library).    The same thing is exemplified in geometry. If we want to prove some  property of _all_ triangles, we draw some one triangle and reason about  it; but we can avoid making use of any property which it does not share  with all other triangles, and thus, from our particular case, we obtain  a general result. We do not, in fact, feel our certainty that two and  two are four increased by fresh instances, because, as soon as we have  seen the truth of this proposition, our certainty becomes so great as  to be incapable of growing greater. Moreover, we feel some quality of  necessity about the proposition 'two and two are four', which is  absent from even the best attested empirical generalizations. Such  generalizations always remain mere facts: we feel that there might be a  world in which they were false, though in the actual world they happen  to be true. In any possible world, on the contrary, we feel that two  and two would be four: this is not a mere fact, but a necessity to which  everything actual and possible must conform.    The case may be made clearer by considering a genuinely-empirical  generalization, such as 'All men are mortal.' It is plain that we  believe this proposition, in the first place, because there is no known  instance of men living beyond a certain age, and in the second place  because there seem to be physiological grounds for thinking that an  organism such as a man's body must sooner or later wear out. Neglecting  the second ground, and considering merely our experience of men's  mortality, it is plain that we should not be content with one quite  clearly understood instance of a man dying, whereas, in the case of 'two  and two are four', one instance does suffice, when carefully considered,  to persuade us that the same must happen in any other instance. Also  we can be forced to admit, on reflection, that there may be some doubt,  however slight, as to whether _all_ men are mortal. This may be made  plain by the attempt to imagine two different worlds, in one of which  there are men who are not mortal, while in the other two and two make  five. When Swift invites us to consider the race of Struldbugs who never  die, we are able to acquiesce in imagination. But a world where two  and two make five seems quite on a different level. We feel that such a  world, if there were one, would upset the whole fabric of our knowledge  and reduce us to utter doubt.    The fact is that, in simple mathematical judgements such as 'two and two  are four', and also in many judgements of logic, we can know the general  proposition without inferring it from instances, although some instance  is usually necessary to make clear to us what the general proposition  means. This is why there is real utility in the process of _deduction_,  which goes from the general to the general, or from the general to the  particular, as well as in the process of _induction_, which goes from  the particular to the particular, or from the particular to the general.  It is an old debate among philosophers whether deduction ever gives  _new_ knowledge. We can now see that in certain cases, at least, it does  do so. If we already know that two and two always make four, and we  know that Brown and Jones are two, and so are Robinson and Smith, we can  deduce that Brown and Jones and Robinson and Smith are four. This is  new knowledge, not contained in our premisses, because the general  proposition, 'two and two are four', never told us there were such  people as Brown and Jones and Robinson and Smith, and the particular  premisses do not tell us that there were four of them, whereas the  particular proposition deduced does tell us both these things.    But the newness of the knowledge is much less certain if we take the  stock instance of deduction that is always given in books on logic,  namely, 'All men are mortal; Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is  mortal.' In this case, what we really know beyond reasonable doubt is  that certain men, A, B, C, were mortal, since, in fact, they have died.  If Socrates is one of these men, it is foolish to go the roundabout way  through 'all men are mortal' to arrive at the conclusion that _probably_  Socrates is mortal. If Socrates is not one of the men on whom our  induction is based, we shall still do better to argue straight from our  A, B, C, to Socrates, than to go round by the general proposition, 'all  men are mortal'. For the probability that Socrates is mortal is greater,  on our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583"],[0,"The Woman in White (#12)"],[1," enough to resist the temptation of sitting  in solitary grandeur among bottles of my own choosing, and sensible  enough to ask the ladies' permission to leave the table with them  habitually, on the civilised foreign plan, during the period of my  residence at Limmeridge House.    The drawing-room, to which we had now withdrawn for the rest of the  evening, was on the ground-floor, and was of the same shape and size as  the breakfast-room.  Large glass doors at the lower end opened on to a  terrace, beautifully ornamented along its whole length with a profusion  of flowers.  The soft, hazy twilight was just shading leaf and blossom  alike into harmony with its own sober hues as we entered the room, and  the sweet evening scent of the flowers met us with its fragrant welcome  through the open glass doors.  Good Mrs. Vesey (always the first of the  party to sit down) took possession of an arm-chair in a corner, and  dozed off comfortably to sleep.  At my request Miss Fairlie placed  herself at the piano.  As I followed her to a seat near the instrument,  I saw Miss Halcombe retire into a recess of one of the side windows, to  proceed with the search through her mother's letters by the last quiet  rays of the evening light.    How vividly that peaceful home-picture of the drawing-room comes back  to me while I write! From the place where I sat I could see Miss  Halcombe's graceful figure, half of it in soft light, half in  mysterious shadow, bending intently over the letters in her lap; while,  nearer to me, the fair profile of the player at the piano was just  delicately defined against the faintly-deepening background of the  inner wall of the room.  Outside, on the terrace, the clustering  flowers and long grasses and creepers waved so gently in the light  evening air, that the sound of their rustling never reached us.  The  sky was without a cloud, and the dawning mystery of moonlight began to  tremble already in the region of the eastern heaven.  The sense of  peace and seclusion soothed all thought and feeling into a rapt,  unearthly repose; and the balmy quiet, that deepened ever with the  deepening light, seemed to hover over us with a gentler influence  still, when there stole upon it from the piano the heavenly tenderness  of the music of Mozart.  It was an evening of sights and sounds never  to forget.    We all sat silent in the places we had chosen--Mrs. Vesey still  sleeping, Miss Fairlie still playing, Miss Halcombe still reading--till  the light failed us.  By this time the moon had stolen round to the  terrace, and soft, mysterious rays of light were slanting already  across the lower end of the room.  The change from the twilight  obscurity was so beautiful that we banished the lamps, by common  consent, when the servant brought them in, and kept the large room  unlighted, except by the glimmer of the two candles at the piano.    For half an hour more the music still went on.  After that the beauty  of the moonlight view on the terrace tempted Miss Fairlie out to look  at it, and I followed her.  When the candles at the piano had been  lighted Miss Halcombe had changed her place, so as to continue her  examination of the letters by their assistance. We left her, on a low  chair, at one side of the instrument, so absorbed over her reading that  she did not seem to notice when we moved.    We had been out on the terrace together, just in front of the glass  doors, hardly so long as five minutes, I should think; and Miss Fairlie  was, by my advice, just tying her white handkerchief over her head as a  precaution against the night air--when I heard Miss Halcombe's  voice--low, eager, and altered from its natural lively tone--pronounce  my name.    \"Mr. Hartright,\" she said, \"will you come here for a minute? I want to  speak to you.\"    I entered the room again immediately.  The piano stood about half-way  down along the inner wall.  On the side of the instrument farthest from  the terrace Miss Halcombe was sitting with the letters scattered on her  lap, and with one in her hand selected from them, and held close to the  candle.  On the side nearest to the terrace there stood a low ottoman,  on which I took my place. In this position I was not far from the glass  doors, and I could see Miss Fairlie plainly, as she passed and repassed  the opening on to the terrace, walking slowly from end to end of it in  the full radiance of the moon.    \"I want you to listen while I read the concluding passages in this  letter,\" said Miss Halcombe.  \"Tell me if you think they throw any  light upon your strange adventure on the road to London.  The letter is  addressed by my mother to her second husband, Mr. Fairlie, and the date  refers to a period of between eleven and twelve years since.  At that  time Mr. and Mrs. Fairlie, and my half-sister Laura, had been living  for years in this house; and I was away from them completing my  education at a school in Paris.\"    She looked and spoke earnestly, and, as I thought, a little uneasily as  well.  At the moment when she raised the letter to the candle before  beginning to read it, Miss Fairlie passed us on the terrace, looked in  for a moment, and seeing that we were engaged, slowly walked on.    Miss Halcombe began to read as follows:--      \"'You will be tired, my dear Philip, of hearing perpetually about my  schools and my scholars.  Lay the blame, pray, on the dull uniformity  of life at Limmeridge, and not on me.  Besides, this time I have  something really interesting to tell you about a new scholar.    \"'You know old Mrs. Kempe at the village shop.  Well, after years of  ailing, the doctor has at last given her up, and she is dying slowly  day by day.  Her only living relation, a sister, arrived last week to  take care of her.  This sister comes all the way from Hampshire--her  name is Mrs. Catherick.  Four days ago Mrs. Catherick came here to see  me, and brought her only child with her, a sweet little girl about a  year older than our darling Laura----'\"      As the last sentence fell from the reader's lips, Miss Fairlie passed  us on the terrace once more.  She was softly singing to herself one of  the melodies which she had been playing earlier in the evening.  Miss  Halcombe waited till she had passed out of sight again, and then went  on with the letter--      \"'Mrs. Catherick is a decent, well-behaved, respectable woman;  middle-aged, and with the remains of having been moderately, only  moderately, nice-looking.  There is something in her manner and in her  appearance, however, which I can't make out.  She is reserved about  herself to the point of downright secrecy, and there is a look in her  face--I can't describe it--which suggests to me that she has something  on her mind.  She is altogether what you would call a walking mystery.  Her errand at Limmeridge House, however, was simple enough.  When she  left Hampshire to nurse her sister, Mrs. Kempe, through her last  illness, she had been obliged to bring her daughter with her, through  having no one at home to take care of the little girl.  Mrs. Kempe may  die in a week's time, or may linger on for months; and Mrs. Catherick's  object was to ask me to let her daughter, Anne, have the benefit of  attending my school, subject to the condition of her being removed from  it to go home again with her mother, after Mrs. Kempe's death.  I  consented at once, and when Laura and I went out for our walk, we took  the little girl (who is just eleven years old) to the school that very  day.'\"      Once more Miss Fairlie's figure, bright and soft in its snowy muslin  dress--her face prettily framed by the white folds of the handkerchief  which she had tied under her chin--passed by us in the moonlight.  Once  more Miss Halcombe waited till she was out of sight, and then went on--      \"'I have taken a violent fancy, Philip, to my new scholar, for a reason  which I mean to keep till the last for the sake of surprising you.  Her  mother having told me as little about the child as she told me of  herself, I was left to discover (which I did on the first day when we  tried her at lessons) that the poor little thing's intellect is not  developed as it ought to be at her age.  Seeing this I had her up to  the house the next day, and privately arranged with the doctor to come  and watch her and question her, and tell me what he thought.  His  opinion is that she will grow out of it.  But he says her careful  bringing-up at school is a matter of great importance just now, because  her unusual slowness in acquiring ideas implies an unusual tenacity in  keeping them, when they are once received into her mind.  Now, my love,  you must not imagine, in your off-hand way, that I have been attaching  myself to an idiot.  This poor little Anne Catherick is a sweet,  affectionate, grateful girl, and says the quaintest, prettiest things  (as you shall judge by an instance), in the most oddly sudden,  surprised, half-frightened way.  Although she is dressed very neatly,  her clothes show a sad want of taste in colour and pattern.  So I  arranged, yesterday, that some of our darling Laura's old white frocks  and white hats should be altered for Anne Catherick, explaining to her  that little girls of her complexion looked neater and better all in  white than in anything else.  She hesitated and seemed puzzled for a  minute, then flushed up, and appeared to understand.  Her little hand  clasped mine suddenly.  She kissed it, Philip, and said (oh, so  earnestly!), \"I will always wear white as long as I live.  It will help  me to remember you, ma'am, and to think that I am pleasing you still,  when I go away and see you no more.\" This is only one specimen of the  quaint things she says so prettily.  Poor little soul! She shall have a  stock of white frocks, made with good deep tucks, to let out for her as  she grows----'\"      Miss Halcombe paused, and looked at me across the piano.    \"Did the forlorn woman whom you met in the"]]]
