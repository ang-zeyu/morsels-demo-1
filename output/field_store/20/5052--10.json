With a few explainable  exceptions the valleys of tributaries join that of the trunk  stream at a level; there is no sudden descent or break in the bed  at the point of juncture. These are the natural consequences which  must follow if the land has long been worked upon by streams, and  no other process has ever been suggested which is competent to  produce them. We must conclude that valley systems have been  formed by the river systems which drain them, aided by the work of  the weather; they are not gaping fissures in the earth's crust, as  early observers imagined, but are the furrows which running water  has drawn upon the land.    As valleys are made by the slow wear of streams and the action of  the weather, they pass in their development through successive  stages, each of which has its own characteristic features. We may  therefore classify rivers and valleys according to the stage which  they have reached in their life history from infancy to old age.    YOUNG RIVER VALLEYS    INFANCY. The Red River of the North. A region in northwestern  Minnesota and the adjacent portions of North Dakota and Manitoba  was so recently covered by the waters of an extinct lake, known as  Lake Agassiz, that the surface remains much as it was left when  the lake was drained away. The flat floor, spread smooth with  lake-laid silts, is still a plain, to the eye as level as the sea.  Across it the Red River of the North and its branches run in  narrow, ditch-like channels, steep-sided and shallow, not  exceeding sixty feet in depth, their gradients differing little  from the general slopes of the region. The trunk streams have but  few tributaries; the river system, like a sapling with few limbs,  is still undeveloped. Along the banks of the trunk streams short  gullies are slowly lengthening headwards, like growing twigs which  are sometime to become large branches.    The flat interstream areas are as yet but little scored by  drainage lines, and in wet weather water lingers in ponds in any  initial depressions on the plain.    CONTOURS. In order to read the topographic maps of the text-book  and the laboratory the student should know that contours are lines  drawn on maps to represent relief, all points on any given contour  being of equal height above sea level. The CONTOUR INTERVAL is the  uniform vertical distance between two adjacent contours and varies  on different maps.    To express regions of faint relief a contour interval of ten or  twenty feet is commonly selected; while in mountainous regions a  contour interval of two hundred and fifty, five hundred, or even  one thousand feet may be necessary in order that the contours may  not be too crowded for easy reading.    Whether a river begins its life on a lake plain, as in the example  just cited, or upon a coastal plain lifted from beneath the sea or  on a spread of glacial drift left by the retreat of continental  ice sheets, such as covers much of Canada and the northeastern  parts of the United States, its infantile stage presents the same  characteristic features,--a narrow and shallow valley, with  undeveloped tributaries and undrained interstream areas. Ground  water stands high, and, exuding in the undrained initial  depressions, forms marshes and lakes.    LAKES. Lakes are perhaps the most obvious of these fleeting  features of infancy. They are short-lived, for their destruction  is soon accomplished by several means. As a river system advances  toward maturity the deepening and extending valleys of the  tributaries lower the ground-water surface and invade the  undrained depressions of the region. Lakes having outlets are  drained away as their basin rims are cut down by the outflowing  streams,--a slow process where the rim is of hard rock, but a  rapid one where it is of soft material such as glacial drift.    Lakes are effaced also by the filling of their basins. Inflowing  streams and the wash of rains bring in waste. Waves abrade the  shore and strew the debris worn from it over the lake bed. Shallow  lakes are often filled with organic matter from decaying  vegetation.    Does the outflowing stream, from a lake carry sediment? How does  this fact affect its erosive power on hard rock? on loose  material?    Lake Geneva is a well-known example of a lake in process of  obliteration. The inflowing Rhone has already displaced the waters  of the lake for a length of twenty miles with the waste brought  down from the high Alps. For this distance there extends up the  Rhone Valley an alluvial plain, which has grown lakeward at the  rate of a mile and a half since Roman times, as proved by the  distance inland at which a Roman port now stands.    How rapidly a lake may be silted up under exceptionally favorable  conditions is illustrated by the fact that over the bottom of the  artificial lake, of thirty-five square miles, formed behind the  great dam across the Colorado River at Austin, Texas, sediments  thirty-nine feet deep gathered in seven years.    Lake Mendota, one of the many beautiful lakes of southern  Wisconsin, is rapidly cutting back the soft glacial drift of its  shores by means of the abrasion of its waves. While the shallow  basin is thus broadened, it is also being filled with the waste;  and the time is brought nearer when it will be so shoaled that  vegetation can complete the work of its effacement.    Along the margin of a shallow lake mosses, water lilies, grasses,  and other water-loving plants grow luxuriantly. As their decaying  remains accumulate on the bottom, the ring of marsh broadens  inwards, the lake narrows gradually to a small pond set in the  midst of a wide bog, and finally disappears. All stages in this  process of extinction may be seen among the countless lakelets  which occupy sags in the recent sheets of glacial drift in the  northern states; and more numerous than the lakes which still  remain are those already thus filled with carbonaceous matter  derived from the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere. Such fossil  lakes are marked by swamps or level meadows underlain with muck.    THE ADVANCE TO MATURITY. The infantile stage is brief. As a river  advances toward maturity the initial depressions, the lake basins  of its area, are gradually effaced. By the furrowing action of the  rain wash and the head ward lengthening, of tributaries a  branchwork of drainage channels grows until it covers the entire  area, and not an acre is left on which the fallen raindrop does  not find already cut for it an uninterrupted downward path which  leads it on by way of gully, brook, and river to the sea. The  initial surface of the land, by whatever agency it was modeled, is  now wholly destroyed; the region is all reduced to valley slopes.    THE LONGITUDINAL PROFILE OF A STREAM. This at first corresponds  with the initial surface of the region on which the stream begins  to flow, although its way may lead through basins and down steep  descents. The successive profiles to which it reduces its bed are  illustrated in Figure 51. As the gradient, or rate of descent of  its bed, is lowered, the velocity of the river is decreased until  its lessening energy is wholly consumed in carrying its load and  it can no longer erode its bed. The river is now AT GRADE, and its  capacity is just equal to its load. If now its load is increased  the stream deposits, and thus builds up, or AGGRADES, its bed. On  the other hand, if its load is diminished it has energy to spare,  and resuming its work of erosion, DEGRADES its bed. In either case  the stream continues aggrading or degrading until a new gradient  is found where the velocity is just sufficient to move the load,  and here again it reaches grade.    V-VALLEYS. Vigorous rivers well armed with waste make short work  of cutting their beds to grade, and thus erode narrow, steep-sided  gorges only wide enough at the base to accommodate the stream. The  steepness of the valley slopes depends on the relative rates at  which the bed is cut down by the stream and the sides are worn  back by the weather. In resistant rock a swift, well-laden stream  may saw out a gorge whose sides are nearly or even quite vertical,  but as a rule young valleys whose streams have not yet reached  grade are V-shaped; their sides flare at the top because here the  rocks have longest been opened up to the action of the weather.  Some of the deepest canyons may be found where a rising land mass,  either mountain range or plateau, has long maintained by its  continued uplift the rivers of the region above grade.    In the northern hemisphere the north sides of river valleys are  sometimes of more gentle slope than the south sides. Can you  suggest a reason?    THE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO RIVER IN ARIZONA. The Colorado  River trenches the high plateau of northern Arizona with a  colossal canyon two hundred and eighteen miles long and more than  a mile in greatest depth. The rocks in which the canyon is cut are  for the most part flat-lying, massive beds of limestones and  sandstones, with some shales, beneath which in places harder  crystalline rocks are disclosed. Where the canyon is deepest its  walls have been profoundly dissected. Lateral ravines have widened  into immense amphitheaters, leaving between them long ridges of  mountain height, buttressed and rebuttressed with flanking spurs  and carved into majestic architectural forms. From the extremity  of one of these promontories it is two miles or more across the  gulf to the point of the one opposite, and the heads of the  amphitheaters are thirteen miles apart.    The lower portion of the canyon is much narrower (Fig. 54) and its  walls of dark crystalline rock sink steeply to the edge of the  river, a swift, powerful stream a few hundred feet wide, turbid  with reddish silt, by means of which it continually rasps its  rocky bed as it hurries on. The Colorado is still deepening its  gorge. In the Grand Canyon its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/421"],[0,"Kidnapped (#12)"],[1,"mely. Altogether I thought of him, at the first sight,  that here was a man I would rather call my friend than my enemy.    The captain, too, was taking his observations, but rather of the man's  clothes than his person. And to be sure, as soon as he had taken off  the great-coat, he showed forth mighty fine for the round-house of a  merchant brig: having a hat with feathers, a red waistcoat, breeches  of black plush, and a blue coat with silver buttons and handsome silver  lace; costly clothes, though somewhat spoiled with the fog and being  slept in.    \"I'm vexed, sir, about the boat,\" says the captain.    \"There are some pretty men gone to the bottom,\" said the stranger, \"that  I would rather see on the dry land again than half a score of boats.\"    \"Friends of yours?\" said Hoseason.    \"You have none such friends in your country,\" was the reply. \"They would  have died for me like dogs.\"    \"Well, sir,\" said the captain, still watching him, \"there are more men  in the world than boats to put them in.\"    \"And that's true, too,\" cried the other, \"and ye seem to be a gentleman  of great penetration.\"    \"I have been in France, sir,\" says the captain, so that it was plain he  meant more by the words than showed upon the face of them.    \"Well, sir,\" says the other, \"and so has many a pretty man, for the  matter of that.\"    \"No doubt, sir,\" says the captain, \"and fine coats.\"    \"Oho!\" says the stranger, \"is that how the wind sets?\" And he laid his  hand quickly on his pistols.    \"Don't be hasty,\" said the captain. \"Don't do a mischief before ye  see the need of it. Ye've a French soldier's coat upon your back and a  Scotch tongue in your head, to be sure; but so has many an honest fellow  in these days, and I dare say none the worse of it.\"    \"So?\" said the gentleman in the fine coat: \"are ye of the honest party?\"  (meaning, Was he a Jacobite? for each side, in these sort of civil  broils, takes the name of honesty for its own).    \"Why, sir,\" replied the captain, \"I am a true-blue Protestant, and I  thank God for it.\" (It was the first word of any religion I had ever  heard from him, but I learnt afterwards he was a great church-goer while  on shore.) \"But, for all that,\" says he, \"I can be sorry to see another  man with his back to the wall.\"    \"Can ye so, indeed?\" asked the Jacobite. \"Well, sir, to be quite plain  with ye, I am one of those honest gentlemen that were in trouble about  the years forty-five and six; and (to be still quite plain with ye) if  I got into the hands of any of the red-coated gentry, it's like it would  go hard with me. Now, sir, I was for France; and there was a French ship  cruising here to pick me up; but she gave us the go-by in the fog--as I  wish from the heart that ye had done yoursel'! And the best that I can  say is this: If ye can set me ashore where I was going, I have that upon  me will reward you highly for your trouble.\"    \"In France?\" says the captain. \"No, sir; that I cannot do. But where ye  come from--we might talk of that.\"    And then, unhappily, he observed me standing in my corner, and packed  me off to the galley to get supper for the gentleman. I lost no time,  I promise you; and when I came back into the round-house, I found the  gentleman had taken a money-belt from about his waist, and poured out  a guinea or two upon the table. The captain was looking at the guineas,  and then at the belt, and then at the gentleman's face; and I thought he  seemed excited.    \"Half of it,\" he cried, \"and I'm your man!\"    The other swept back the guineas into the belt, and put it on again  under his waistcoat. \"I have told ye sir,\" said he, \"that not one doit  of it belongs to me. It belongs to my chieftain,\" and here he touched  his hat, \"and while I would be but a silly messenger to grudge some of  it that the rest might come safe, I should show myself a hound indeed if  I bought my own carcase any too dear. Thirty guineas on the sea-side, or  sixty if ye set me on the Linnhe Loch. Take it, if ye will; if not, ye  can do your worst.\"    \"Ay,\" said Hoseason. \"And if I give ye over to the soldiers?\"    \"Ye would make a fool's bargain,\" said the other. \"My chief, let me tell  you, sir, is forfeited, like every honest man in Scotland. His estate  is in the hands of the man they call King George; and it is his officers  that collect the rents, or try to collect them. But for the honour of  Scotland, the poor tenant bodies take a thought upon their chief lying  in exile; and this money is a part of that very rent for which King  George is looking. Now, sir, ye seem to me to be a man that understands  things: bring this money within the reach of Government, and how much of  it'll come to you?\"    \"Little enough, to be sure,\" said Hoseason; and then, \"if they knew,\" he  added, drily. \"But I think, if I was to try, that I could hold my tongue  about it.\"    \"Ah, but I'll begowk* ye there!\" cried the gentleman. \"Play me false,  and I'll play you cunning. If a hand is laid upon me, they shall ken  what money it is.\"         *Befool.    \"Well,\" returned the captain, \"what must be must. Sixty guineas, and  done. Here's my hand upon it.\"    \"And here's mine,\" said the other.    And thereupon the captain went out (rather hurriedly, I thought), and  left me alone in the round-house with the stranger.    At that period (so soon after the forty-five) there were many exiled  gentlemen coming back at the peril of their lives, either to see their  friends or to collect a little money; and as for the Highland chiefs  that had been forfeited, it was a common matter of talk how their  tenants would stint themselves to send them money, and their clansmen  outface the soldiery to get it in, and run the gauntlet of our great  navy to carry it across. All this I had, of course, heard tell of; and  now I had a man under my eyes whose life was forfeit on all these counts  and upon one more, for he was not only a rebel and a smuggler of rents,  but had taken service with King Louis of France. And as if all this  were not enough, he had a belt full of golden guineas round his loins.  Whatever my opinions, I could not look on such a man without a lively  interest.    \"And so you're a Jacobite?\" said I, as I set meat before him.    \"Ay,\" said he, beginning to eat. \"And you, by your long face, should be  a Whig?\"*         * Whig or Whigamore was the cant name for those who were       loyal to King George.    \"Betwixt and between,\" said I, not to annoy him; for indeed I was as  good a Whig as Mr. Campbell could make me.    \"And that's naething,\" said he. \"But I'm saying, Mr.  Betwixt-and-Between,\" he added, \"this bottle of yours is dry; and it's  hard if I'm to pay sixty guineas and be grudged a dram upon the back of  it.\"    \"I'll go and ask for the key,\" said I, and stepped on deck.    The fog was as close as ever, but the swell almost down. They had laid  the brig to, not knowing precisely where they were, and the wind (what  little there was of it) not serving well for their true course. Some of  the hands were still hearkening for breakers; but the captain and the  two officers were in the waist with their heads together. It struck me  (I don't know why) that they were after no good; and the first word I  heard, as I drew softly near, more than confirmed me.    It was Mr. Riach, crying out as if upon a sudden thought: \"Couldn't we  wile him out of the round-house?\"    \"He's better where he is,\" returned Hoseason; \"he hasn't room to use his  sword.\"    \"Well, that's true,\" said Riach; \"but he's hard to come at.\"    \"Hut!\" said Hoseason. \"We can get the man in talk, one upon each side,  and pin him by the two arms; or if that'll not hold, sir, we can make a  run by both the doors and get him under hand before he has the time to  draw.\"    At this hearing, I was seized with both fear and anger at these  treacherous, greedy, bloody men that I sailed with. My first mind was to  run away; my second was bolder.    \"Captain,\" said I, \"the gentleman is seeking a dram, and the bottle's  out. Will you give me the key?\"    They all started and turned about.    \"Why, here's our chance to get the firearms!\"    Riach cried; and then to me: \"Hark ye, David,\" he said, \"do ye ken where  the pistols are?\"    \"Ay, ay,\" put in Hoseason. \"David kens; David's a good lad. Ye see,  David my man, yon wild Hielandman is a danger to the ship, besides being  a rank foe to King George, God bless him!\"    I had never been so be-Davided since I came on board: but I said Yes, as  if all I heard were quite natural.    \"The trouble is,\" resumed the captain, \"that all our firelocks, great  and little, are in the round-house under this man's nose; likewise the  powder. Now, if I, or one of the officers, was to go in and take them,  he would fall to thinking. But a lad like you, David, might snap up a  horn and a pistol or two without remark. And if ye can do it cleverly,  I'll bear it in mind when it'll be good for you to have friends; and  that's when we come to Carolina.\"    Here Mr. Riach whispered him a little.    \"Very right, sir,\" said the captain; and then to myself: \"And see here,  David, yon man has a beltful of gold, and I give you my word that you  shall have your fingers in it.\"    I told him I would do as he wished, though indeed I had scarce breath to  speak with; and upon that he gave me the key of the spirit locker, and I  began to go slowly back to the round-house. What was I to do? They  were dogs and thieves; they had stolen me from my own country; they had  killed poor Ransome; and was I to hold the candle to another murder? But  then, upon the other hand, there was the fear of death very plain before  me; for what could a boy and a man, if they were as brave as lions,  against a whole ship's company?    I was still arguing it back and forth, and getting no great clearness,  when I came into the round-house and saw the Jacobite eating his supper  under the lamp; and at that my mind was made up all in a moment."]]]
