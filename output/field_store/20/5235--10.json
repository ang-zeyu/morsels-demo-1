[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423"],[0,"Mike (#12)"],[1,"   CHAPTER XI    THE CONCLUSION OF THE PICNIC      If the form-rooms had been lonely, the Great Hall was doubly, trebly,  so. It was a vast room, stretching from side to side of the middle  block, and its ceiling soared up into a distant dome. At one end was a  dais and an organ, and at intervals down the room stood long tables.  The panels were covered with the names of Wrykynians who had won  scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge, and of Old Wrykynians who had  taken first in Mods or Greats, or achieved any other recognised  success, such as a place in the Indian Civil Service list. A silent  testimony, these panels, to the work the school had done in the world.    Nobody knew exactly how many the Hall could hold, when packed to its  fullest capacity. The six hundred odd boys at the school seemed to  leave large gaps unfilled.    This morning there was a mere handful, and the place looked worse than  empty.    The Sixth Form were there, and the school prefects. The Great Picnic  had not affected their numbers. The Sixth stood by their table in a  solid group. The other tables were occupied by ones and twos. A buzz  of conversation was going on, which did not cease when the masters  filed into the room and took their places. Every one realised by this  time that the biggest row in Wrykyn history was well under way; and  the thing had to be discussed.    In the Masters' library Mr. Wain and Mr. Shields, the spokesmen of the  Common Room, were breaking the news to the headmaster.    The headmaster was a man who rarely betrayed emotion in his public  capacity. He heard Mr. Shields's rambling remarks, punctuated by Mr.  Wain's \"Exceedinglys,\" to an end. Then he gathered up his cap and  gown.    \"You say that the whole school is absent?\" he remarked quietly.    Mr. Shields, in a long-winded flow of words, replied that that was  what he did say.    \"Ah!\" said the headmaster.    There was a silence.    \"'M!\" said the headmaster.    There was another silence.    \"Ye--e--s!\" said the headmaster.    He then led the way into the Hall.    Conversation ceased abruptly as he entered. The school, like an  audience at a theatre when the hero has just appeared on the stage,  felt that the serious interest of the drama had begun. There was a  dead silence at every table as he strode up the room and on to the  dais.    There was something Titanic in his calmness. Every eye was on his face  as he passed up the Hall, but not a sign of perturbation could the  school read. To judge from his expression, he might have been unaware  of the emptiness around him.    The master who looked after the music of the school, and incidentally  accompanied the hymn with which prayers at Wrykyn opened, was waiting,  puzzled, at the foot of the dais. It seemed improbable that things  would go on as usual, and he did not know whether he was expected to  be at the organ, or not. The headmaster's placid face reassured him.  He went to his post.    The hymn began. It was a long hymn, and one which the school liked for  its swing and noise. As a rule, when it was sung, the Hall re-echoed.  To-day, the thin sound of the voices had quite an uncanny effect. The  organ boomed through the deserted room.    The school, or the remnants of it, waited impatiently while the  prefect whose turn it was to read stammered nervously through the  lesson. They were anxious to get on to what the Head was going to say  at the end of prayers. At last it was over. The school waited, all  ears.    The headmaster bent down from the dais and called to Firby-Smith, who  was standing in his place with the Sixth.    The Gazeka, blushing warmly, stepped forward.    \"Bring me a school list, Firby-Smith,\" said the headmaster.    The Gazeka was wearing a pair of very squeaky boots that morning. They  sounded deafening as he walked out of the room.    The school waited.    Presently a distant squeaking was heard, and Firby-Smith returned,  bearing a large sheet of paper.    The headmaster thanked him, and spread it out on the reading-desk.    Then, calmly, as if it were an occurrence of every day, he began to  call the roll.    \"Abney.\"    No answer.    \"Adams.\"    No answer.    \"Allenby.\"    \"Here, sir,\" from a table at the end of the room. Allenby was a  prefect, in the Science Sixth.    The headmaster made a mark against his name with a pencil.    \"Arkwright.\"    No answer.    He began to call the names more rapidly.    \"Arlington. Arthur. Ashe. Aston.\"    \"Here, sir,\" in a shrill treble from the rider in motorcars.    The headmaster made another tick.    The list came to an end after what seemed to the school an  unconscionable time, and he rolled up the paper again, and stepped to  the edge of the dais.    \"All boys not in the Sixth Form,\" he said, \"will go to their  form-rooms and get their books and writing-materials, and return  to the Hall.\"    (\"Good work,\" murmured Mr. Seymour to himself. \"Looks as if we  should get that holiday after all.\")    \"The Sixth Form will go to their form-room as usual. I should like  to speak to the masters for a moment.\"    He nodded dismissal to the school.    The masters collected on the dais.    \"I find that I shall not require your services to-day,\" said the  headmaster. \"If you will kindly set the boys in your forms some work  that will keep them occupied, I will look after them here. It is a  lovely day,\" he added, with a smile, \"and I am sure you will all enjoy  yourselves a great deal more in the open air.\"    \"That,\" said Mr. Seymour to Mr. Spence, as they went downstairs, \"is  what I call a genuine sportsman.\"    \"My opinion neatly expressed,\" said Mr. Spence. \"Come on the river. Or  shall we put up a net, and have a knock?\"    \"River, I think. Meet you at the boat-house.\"    \"All right. Don't be long.\"    \"If every day were run on these lines, school-mastering wouldn't be  such a bad profession. I wonder if one could persuade one's form to  run amuck as a regular thing.\"    \"Pity one can't. It seems to me the ideal state of things. Ensures the  greatest happiness of the greatest number.\"    \"I say! Suppose the school has gone up the river, too, and we meet  them! What shall we do?\"    \"Thank them,\" said Mr. Spence, \"most kindly. They've done us well.\"    The school had not gone up the river. They had marched in a solid  body, with the school band at their head playing Sousa, in the  direction of Worfield, a market town of some importance, distant about  five miles. Of what they did and what the natives thought of it all,  no very distinct records remain. The thing is a tradition on the  countryside now, an event colossal and heroic, to be talked about in  the tap-room of the village inn during the long winter evenings. The  papers got hold of it, but were curiously misled as to the nature of  the demonstration. This was the fault of the reporter on the staff of  the _Worfield Intelligencer and Farmers' Guide_, who saw in the  thing a legitimate \"march-out,\" and, questioning a straggler as to the  reason for the expedition and gathering foggily that the restoration  to health of the Eminent Person was at the bottom of it, said so in  his paper. And two days later, at about the time when Retribution had  got seriously to work, the _Daily Mail_ reprinted the account,  with comments and elaborations, and headed it \"Loyal Schoolboys.\" The  writer said that great credit was due to the headmaster of Wrykyn for  his ingenuity in devising and organising so novel a thanksgiving  celebration. And there was the usual conversation between \"a  rosy-cheeked lad of some sixteen summers\" and \"our representative,\"  in which the rosy-cheeked one spoke most kindly of the head-master,  who seemed to be a warm personal friend of his.    The remarkable thing about the Great Picnic was its orderliness.  Considering that five hundred and fifty boys were ranging the country  in a compact mass, there was wonderfully little damage done to  property. Wyatt's genius did not stop short at organising the march.  In addition, he arranged a system of officers which effectually  controlled the animal spirits of the rank and file. The prompt and  decisive way in which rioters were dealt with during the earlier  stages of the business proved a wholesome lesson to others who would  have wished to have gone and done likewise. A spirit of martial law  reigned over the Great Picnic. And towards the end of the day fatigue  kept the rowdy-minded quiet.    At Worfield the expedition lunched. It was not a market-day,  fortunately, or the confusion in the narrow streets would have been  hopeless. On ordinary days Worfield was more or less deserted. It is  astonishing that the resources of the little town were equal to  satisfying the needs of the picnickers. They descended on the place  like an army of locusts.    Wyatt, as generalissimo of the expedition, walked into the  \"Grasshopper and Ant,\" the leading inn of the town.    \"Anything I can do for you, sir?\" inquired the landlord politely.    \"Yes, please,\" said Wyatt, \"I want lunch for five hundred and fifty.\"    That was the supreme moment in mine host's life. It was his big  subject of conversation ever afterwards. He always told that as his  best story, and he always ended with the words, \"You could ha' knocked  me down with a feather!\"    The first shock over, the staff of the \"Grasshopper and Ant\" bustled  about. Other inns were called upon for help. Private citizens rallied  round with bread, jam, and apples. And the army lunched sumptuously.    In the early afternoon they rested, and as evening began to fall, the  march home was started.           *       *       *       *       *    At the school, net practice was just coming to an end when, faintly,  as the garrison of Lucknow heard the first skirl of the pipes of the  relieving force, those on the grounds heard the strains of the school  band and a murmur of many voices. Presently the sounds grew more  distinct, and up the Wrykyn road came marching the vanguard of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7425"],[0,"The Louisa Alcott Reader: a Supplementary Reader for the Fourth Year of School (#12)"],[1,"steered him like the rudder of a ship.    Rosy liked it, and looked down into the deep sea, where all sorts of  queer and lovely things were to be seen. Great fishes came and looked at  her; dolphins played near to amuse her; the pretty nautilus sailed by  in its transparent boat; and porpoises made her laugh with their rough  play. Mermaids brought her pearls and red coral to wear, sea-apples to  eat, and at night sung her to sleep with their sweet lullabies.    So she had a very pleasant voyage, and ran on shore with many thanks to  the good whale, who gave a splendid spout, and swam away.    Then Rosy travelled along till she came to a desert. Hundreds of miles  of hot sand, with no trees or brooks or houses.    \"I never can go that way,\" she said; \"I should starve, and soon be worn  out walking in that hot sand. What _shall_ I do?\"      \"Quee, quee!    Wait and see:    You were good to me;    So here I come,    From my little home,    To help you willingly,\"    said a friendly voice; and there was the mouse, looking at her with its  bright eyes full of gratitude.    \"Why, you dear little thing, I'm very glad to see you; but I'm sure you  can't help me across this desert,\" said Rosy, stroking its soft back.    \"That's easy enough,\" answered the mouse, rubbing its paws briskly.  \"I'll just call my friend the lion; he lives here, and he'll take you  across with pleasure.\"    \"Oh, I'm afraid he'd rather eat me. How dare you call that fierce  beast?\" cried Rosy, much surprised.    \"I gnawed him out of a net once, and he promised to help me. He is a  noble animal, and he will keep his word.\"    Then the mouse sang, in its shrill little voice,--        \"O lion, grand,      Come over the sand,    And help me now, I pray!      Here's a little lass,      Who wants to pass;    Please carry her on her way.\"    In a moment a loud roar was heard, and a splendid yellow lion, with  fiery eyes and a long mane, came bounding over the sand to meet them.    \"What can I do for you, tiny friend?\" he said, looking at the mouse, who  was not a bit frightened, though Rosy hid behind a rock, expecting every  moment to be eaten.    Mousie told him, and the good lion said pleasantly,--    \"I'll take the child along. Come on, my dear; sit on my back and hold  fast to my mane, for I'm a swift horse, and you might fall off.\"    Then he crouched down like a great cat, and Rosy climbed up, for he was  so kind she could not fear him; and away they went, racing over the sand  till her hair whistled in the wind. As soon as she got her breath, she  thought it great fun to go flying along, while other lions and tigers  rolled their fierce eyes at her, but dared not touch her; for this lion  was king of all, and she was quite safe. They met a train of camels with  loads on their backs; and the people travelling with them wondered  what queer thing was riding that fine lion. It looked like a very large  monkey in a red cloak, but went so fast they never saw that it was a  little girl.    \"How glad I am that I was kind to the mouse; for if the good little  creature had not helped me, I never could have crossed this desert,\"  said Rosy, as the lion walked awhile to rest himself.    \"And if the mouse had not gnawed me out of the net I never should have  come at her call. You see, little people can conquer big ones, and make  them gentle and friendly by kindness,\" answered the lion.    Then away they went again, faster than ever, till they came to the green  country. Rosy thanked the good beast, and he ran back, for if any one  saw him, they would try to catch him.    \"Now I have only to climb up these mountains and find father,\" thought  Rosy, as she saw the great hills before her, with many steep roads  winding up to the top, and far, far away rose the smoke from the huts  where the men lived and dug for gold. She started off bravely, but took  the wrong road, and after climbing a long while found the path ended in  rocks over which she could not go. She was very tired and hungry; for  her food was gone, and there were no houses in this wild place. Night  was coming on, and it was so cold she was afraid she would freeze before  morning, but dared not go on lest she should fall down some steep hole  and be killed. Much discouraged, she lay down on the moss and cried a  little; then she tried to sleep, but something kept buzzing in her ear,  and looking carefully she saw a fly prancing about on the moss, as if  anxious to make her listen to his song,--        \"Rosy, my dear,      Don't cry,--I'm here    To help you all I can.      I'm only a fly,      But you'll see that I    Will keep my word like a man.\"    Rosy couldn't help laughing to hear the brisk little fellow talk as if  he could do great things; but she was very glad to see him and hear his  cheerful song, so she held out her finger, and while he sat there told  him all her troubles.    \"Bless your heart! my friend the eagle will carry you right up the  mountains and leave you at your father's door,\" cried the fly; and he  was off with a flirt of his gauzy wings, for he meant what he said.    Rosy was ready for her new horse, and not at all afraid after the whale  and the lion; so when a great eagle swooped down and alighted near her,  she just looked at his sharp claws, big eyes, and crooked beak as coolly  as if he had been a cock-robin.    He liked her courage, and said kindly in his rough voice,--    \"Hop up, little girl, and sit among my feathers. Hold me fast round the  neck, or you may grow dizzy and get a fall.\"    Rosy nestled down among the thick gray feathers, and put both arms round  his neck; and whiz they went, up, up, up, higher and higher, till the  trees looked like grass, they were so far below. At first it was very  cold, and Rosy cuddled deeper into her feather bed; then, as they came  nearer to the sun, it grew warm, and she peeped out to see the huts  standing in a green spot on the top of the mountain.    \"Here we are. You'll find all the men are down in the mine at this  time. They won't come up till morning; so you will have to wait for your  father. Good-by; good luck, my dear.\" And the eagle soared away, higher  still, to his nest among the clouds.    It was night now, but fires were burning in all the houses; so Rosy went  from hut to hut trying to find her father's, that she might rest while  she waited: at last in one the picture of a pretty little girl hung on  the wall, and under it was written, \"My Rosy.\" Then she knew that this  was the right place; and she ate some supper, put on more wood, and went  to bed, for she wanted to be fresh when her father came in the morning.    While she slept a storm came on,--thunder rolled and lightning flashed,  the wind blew a gale, and rain poured,--but Rosy never waked till dawn,  when she heard men shouting outside,--    \"Run, run! The river is rising! We shall all be drowned!\"    Rosy ran out to see what was the matter, though the wind nearly blew her  away; she found that so much rain had made the river overflow till it  began to wash the banks away.    \"What shall I do? what shall I do?\" cried Rosy, watching the men rush  about like ants, getting their bags of gold ready to carry off before  the water swept them away, if it became a flood.    As if in answer to her cry, Rosy heard a voice say close by,--        \"Splash, dash!      Rumble and crash!    Here come the beavers gay;      See what they do,      Rosy, for you,    Because you helped _me_ one day.\"    And there in the water was the little fish swimming about, while an army  of beavers began to pile up earth and stones in a high bank to keep the  river back. How they worked, digging and heaping with teeth and claws,  and beating the earth hard with their queer tails like shovels! Rosy and  the men watched them work, glad to be safe, while the storm cleared up;  and by the time the dam was made, all danger was over. Rosy looked into  the faces of the rough men, hoping her father was there, and was just  going to ask about him, when a great shouting rose again, and all began  to run to the pit hole, saying,--    \"The sand has fallen in! The poor fellows will be smothered! How can we  get them out? how can we get them out?\"    Rosy ran too, feeling as if her heart would break; for her father was  down in the mine, and would die soon if air did not come to him. The men  dug as hard as they could; but it was a long job, and they feared they  would not be in time.    Suddenly hundreds of moles came scampering along, and began to burrow  down through the earth, making many holes for air to go in; for they  know how to build galleries through the ground better than men can.  Every one was so surprised they stopped to look on; for the dirt flew  like rain as the busy little fellows scratched and bored as if making an  underground railway.    \"What does it mean?\" said the men. \"They work faster than we can, and  better; but who sent them? Is this strange little girl a fairy?\"    Before Rosy could speak, all heard a shrill, small voice singing,--        \"They come at my call;      And though they are small,    They'll dig the passage clear:      I never forget;      We'll save them yet,    For love of Rosy dear.\"    Then all saw a little gray mouse sitting on a stone, waving her tail  about, and pointing with her tiny paw to show the moles where to dig.    The men laughed; and Rosy was telling them who she was, when a cry came  from the pit, and they saw that the way was clear so they could pull the  buried men up. In a minute they got ropes, and soon had ten poor fellows  safe on the ground; pale and dirty, but all alive, and all shouting as  if they were crazy,--    \"Tom's got it! Tom's got it! Hooray for Tom!\"    \"What is it?\" cried the others; and then they saw Tom come up with the  biggest lump of gold ever found in the mountains.    Every one was glad of Tom's luck; for he was a good man, and had worked  a long time, and been sick, and couldn't go back to"]]]
