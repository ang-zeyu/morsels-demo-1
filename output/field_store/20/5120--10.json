In addition, these missions would have  been put in the hands of a general officer who had an experienced  staff to assist him. Neither of the desired regiments, however,  could be made available for the Leyte operation because of shortage  of troops and previous commitments. [94]    While the Rangers were seizing the small islands, the mine sweepers  and underwater demolition teams were to start clearing the gulf of  natural and man-made obstacles. The fire support units were to move in  and start softening up the beaches. The completion of these missions  would conclude the first phase of the operation.    The second phase comprised \"a major amphibious assault to attack and  destroy hostile forces in the coastal strip Tacloban-Dulag inclusive,  and to seize airdromes and base sites therein; a rapid advance through  Leyte Valley to seize and occupy the Capoocan-Carigara-Barugo area;  [and finally] open San Juanico and Panaon Straits....\" [95]    In the very early hours of 20 October the Northern and Southern Attack  Forces were to move to their appointed beach areas and be prepared  to disembark their assault troops. The reinforced 21st Infantry  Regiment was to go ashore at 0930 in the vicinity of Panaon Strait  at the extreme southeast tip of Leyte and secure control of that  entrance to Sogod Bay. To the north at 1000, the X Corps was to land  with two divisions abreast in the Marasbaras and Palo areas. About  fifteen miles farther south, in the Dulag area, the XXIV Corps was to  go ashore simultaneously with two divisions abreast. The two corps  would be so widely separated and their objectives so divergent that  initially they could not be mutually supporting. Even within the zones  of action of the two corps, the missions assigned the divisions would  limit the ability of the divisions to support each other. [96]    As General Krueger felt that the Japanese would offer the greatest  resistance in the north, the initial objectives of the X Corps were  limited to the seizure of Palo and the capture of Tacloban and its  airfield. The northernmost unit, the 1st Cavalry Division, actually  an infantry square division, was to land with brigades abreast in  the Marasbaras area, advance to the north, and seize Tacloban and  its airstrip, the most important objective for A Day. Thereafter,  the division was to secure control over San Juanico Strait. To the  left of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 24th Division was to go ashore  with regiments abreast in the Palo area, seize Palo, and then advance  northwest through the Leyte Valley. The two divisions were to converge  on Carigara, at the northern end of Leyte Valley on Carigara Bay. [97]    In the XXIV Corps zone, the 96th Division with regiments abreast  was to land in the area between Dulag and San Roque, and to secure  that portion of Highway 1 in its zone, Catmon Hill, and, finally,  the Dagami-Tanauan area. On its left the 7th Division with regiments  abreast was to go ashore in the Dulag area. One element was to go  south and seize the Highway 1 bridge and crossings of the Daguitan  (Marabang) River at Dao while the main force of the division was  to advance along the axis of the Dulag-Burauen road and capture  Burauen. The 7th Division would then be in a position to move north  toward Dagami. All hostile airfields in its zone of action were to  be seized and occupied. The division was to be prepared, on corps  order, to seize Abuyog, to the south, and Baybay, on the west coast,  destroying enemy forces on the west coast and in the southern portion  of Leyte. [98]    Completion of these missions of the X and XXIV Corps would bring  to an end the second phase of the Leyte operation. By this time,  General Krueger hoped, the back of the Japanese resistance would be  broken. With Leyte Valley and its airfields and base sites firmly  in the hands of the Sixth Army, General Krueger's forces would be in  a position to apply firmly the pincers on the remaining Japanese on  the island. The X Corps was to drive south down the Ormoc Valley to  Ormoc while the XXIV Corps was to move north from Baybay along the  shores of Ormoc Bay and make juncture with the X Corps. The remnants  of the Japanese forces, driven into the mountains of western Leyte,  would be unable to continue an organized resistance. [99]    The eastern shores of Leyte were chosen for the initial landing,  since the beaches on this side were the best on the island, and  were the logical entrance to the important airfields, base sites,  and roads in Leyte Valley.    Since the large number of naval vessels required considerable room  for landing the assault troops and for maneuvering, the landing beach  areas of the two corps were widely separated. In addition, the value of  the road net which connected Dulag with the Burauen airfields formed  an important consideration in the determination of the landing beach  sites of the XXIV Corps. \"This latter factor--which took precedence  over the potentiality of strong enemy resistance from Catmon Hill--had  determined the selection of beaches in the Dulag area.\" [100]    Although it was recognized as necessary for elements of the XXIV Corps  to advance south to Abuyog and then overland to Baybay in order to  destroy the enemy forces on the west coast, these maneuvers would  leave great gaps in the battle line if only four divisions were at  first employed. General Krueger therefore asked General Headquarters  of the Southwest Pacific for additional combat troops, and during the  progress of the campaign General MacArthur made them available. [101]    The Sixth Army was also troubled about its reserve force. Although the  32d Division at Morotai and Hollandia and the 77th Division at Guam had  been designated as Sixth Army Reserve, it would be impossible for these  units to arrive at Leyte before the middle of November. The shortage  of amphibious shipping made it necessary to mount these divisions on  the turnaround of assault shipping. Since the floating reserve would  have to come from one of the assault divisions, it was difficult to  determine from which division to take it. It was decided that the  96th Division, considering its mission, could best spare such a unit,  and the 381st Infantry of that division was therefore selected. [102]    To summarize the mission of the Sixth Army: on 17 October, the 6th  Ranger Infantry Battalion would seize Suluan, Dinagat, and Homonhon  Islands, in the entrance to Leyte Bay. At 0930 on 20 October, the 21st  Infantry Regiment was to land in the vicinity of Panaon Strait and  secure control of that entrance to Sogod Bay. At 1000 on the same day  the Sixth Army with the X and XXIV Corps abreast would make a major  amphibious landing on Leyte. In the north the X Corps, with the 1st  Cavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division abreast, after moving  ashore in the Marasbaras and the Palo areas, would capture Tacloban,  its airfield, and Palo. In the south the XXIV Corps with the 96th and  7th Infantry Divisions abreast would go ashore to secure control in  the Dulag area. [103]          The Logistical Plan    Construction    The decision to land on Leyte at the beginning of the rainy season  and to construct a major supply and air base thereon presented a  serious problem to the engineers. The poor soil, inadequate roads,  and heavy rains were obstacles that had to be met and in some way  overcome if the operation was to be a logistical success. General  MacArthur recognized the need for making use of Leyte as a logistical  base by creating for the first time in the Southwest Pacific an army  service command and by detailing his chief engineer, Maj. Gen. Hugh  J. Casey, to be its commander. ASCOM, as it was called, was to provide  the logistical services required for the operation and to build and  operate the Army base facilities until the United States Army Services  of Supply (SWPA) could take over. This transfer was expected to take  place about thirty days after the assault troops first landed on the  shores of Leyte. [104]    General Mac Arthur directed the Sixth Army to establish the following  air facilities in the Leyte area: by A plus 5, facilities for two  fighter groups, one night fighter squadron, one photo squadron, one  medium bomber group plus one squadron, three patrol bomber squadrons,  and one Marine reconnaissance squadron; by A plus 30, additional  facilities for two light bomber groups, one air-sea rescue squadron,  one tactical reconnaissance squadron, and one fighter squadron;  additional facilities by A plus 45 for one fighter group, one patrol  bomber squadron, two heavy bomber groups, and one laboratory squadron;  and by A plus 60, further facilities for one photo squadron, one  patrol bomber squadron, two troop carrier groups, and one combat  mapping squadron. [105]    The final Sixth Army plan for the Leyte operation directed ASCOM  to establish naval facilities in the Leyte area as well as the  aforementioned air facilities; to make topographic and hydrographic  surveys, followed by suitable changes in the plans for the construction  of bases, docks, roads, and airdromes; to unload all units, supplies,  and mat√©riel arriving in the area and to store and issue supplies to  ground and air units; and, in co-operation with the Philippine Civil  Affairs Units, recruit and direct native labor. [106]    The construction program as planned for Leyte brought strong  remonstrances from the Sixth Army engineers. On 10 August Col. William  J. Ely, the executive officer, protested against the employment  of Leyte as a major supply and air force base. The reasons for his  objections were prophetic. The operation was to be launched during  the season of heavy rains in an area where high winds and typhoons  occurred. The harbor was so shallow and so obstructed by patches  of coral that the approaches would have to be as much as 800 feet  long. The fact that the flat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4907"],[0,"Moths of the Limberlost: A Book About Limberlost Cabin (#12)"],[1," and left her until the lights were out, and then removed the  lid.  Every opening was tightly screened, and as she had mated, I did  not think she would fly.  I hoped in the freedom of the Cabin she  would not break her wings, and ruin herself for a study.    There was much comfort in the thought that I could secure her  likeness; her eggs would be fertile, and I could raise a brood  the coming season, in which would be both male and female.  When  life was over I could add her to my specimen case, for these are  of the moths that do not eat, and live only a few days after  depositing their eggs.  So I went out and explained to Mr. Pettis  what efforts I had made to secure this yellow moth, comforted him  for allowing the male to escape by telling him I could raise all I  wanted from the eggs of the female, showed him my entire collection,  and sent him from the Cabin such a friend to my work, that it was he  who brought me an oil-coated lark a few days later.    On rising early the next morning, I found my moth had deposited  some eggs on the dining-room floor, before the conservatory doors,  more on the heavy tapestry that covered them, and she was clinging  to a velvet curtain at a library window, liberally dotting it with  eggs, almost as yellow as her body.  I turned a tumbler over those  on the floor, pinned folds in the curtains, and as soon as the light  was good, set up a camera and focused on a suitable location.    She climbed on my finger when it was held before her, and was carried,  with no effort to fly, to the place I had selected, though Molly-Cotton  walked close with a spread net, ready for the slightest impulse toward  movement.  But female moths seldom fly until they have finished egg  depositing, and this one was transferred with no trouble to the spot  on which I had focused.  On the back wall of the Cabin, among some  wild roses, she was placed on a log, and immediately raised her wings,  and started for the shade of the vines.  The picture made of her as  she walked is beautiful.  After I had secured several studies she was  returned to the library curtain, where she resumed egg placing.  These were not counted, but there, were at least three hundred at a  rough guess.    I had thought her lovely in gas light, but day brought forth marvels  and wonders.  When a child, I used to gather cowslips in a bed of  lush swale, beside a little creek at the foot of a big hill on our farm.  At the summit was an old orchard, and in a brush-heap a brown thrush  nested.  From a red winter pearmain the singer poured out his own heart  in song, and then reproduced the love ecstasy of every other bird of  the orchard.  That moth's wings were so exactly the warm though  delicate yellow of the flowers I loved, that as I looked at it I could  feel my bare feet sinking in the damp ooze, smell the fragrance of the  buttercups, and hear again the ripple of the water and the mating  exultation of the brown thrush.    In the name--Eacles Imperialis--there is no meaning or appropriateness  to \"Eacles\"; \"Imperialis\"--of course, translates imperial--which seems  most fitting, for the moth is close the size of Cecropia, and of truly  royal beauty.  We called it the Yellow Emperor.  Her Imperial Golden  Majesty had a wing sweep of six and a quarter inches.  From the  shoulders spreading in an irregular patch over front and back wings,  most on the front, were markings of heliotrope, quite dark in colour:  Near the costa of the front wings were two almost circular dots of  slightly paler heliotrope, the one nearest the edge about half the size  of the other.  On the back wings, halfway from each edge, and half an  inch from the marking at the base, was one round spot of the same colour.  Beginning at the apex of the front pair, and running to half an inch  from the lower edge, was a band of escalloped heliotrope.  On the  back pair this band began half an inch from the edge and ran straight  across, so that at the outer curve of the wing it was an inch higher.  The front wing surface and the space above this marking on the back  were liberally sprinkled with little oblong touches of heliotrope;  but from the curved line to the bases of the back pair, the colouring  was pure canary yellow.    The top of the head was covered with long, silken hairs of heliotrope,  then a band of yellow; the upper abdomen was strongly shaded with  heliotrope almost to the extreme tip.  The lower sides of the wings  were yellow at the base, the spots showing through, but not the  bands, and only the faintest touches of the mottling. The thorax  and abdomen were yellow, and the legs heliotrope.  The antennae  were heliotrope, fine, threadlike, and closely pressed to the head.  The eyes were smaller than those of Cecropia, and very close together.    Compared with Cecropia these moths were very easy to paint.  Their  markings were elaborate, but they could be followed accurately,  and the ground work of colour was warm cowslip yellow. The only  difficulty was to make the almost threadlike antennae show,  and to blend the faint touches of heliotrope on the upper wings  with the yellow.    The eggs on the floor and curtains were guarded with care.  They  were dotted around promiscuously, and at first were clear and of  amber colour, but as the little caterpillars grew in them, they  showed a red line three fourths of the way around the rim, and  became slightly depressed in the middle.  The young emerged in  thirteen days.  They were nearly half an inch long, and were  yellow with black lines.  They began the task of eating until  they reached the pupa state, by turning on their shells and  devouring all of them to the glue by which they were fastened.    They were given their choice of oak, alder, sumac, elm, cherry,  and hickory.  The majority of them seemed to prefer the hickory.  They moulted on the fifth day for the first time, and changed to  a brown colour.  Every five or six days they repeated the process,  growing larger and of stronger colour with each moult, and developing  a covering of long white hairs.  Part of these moulted four times,  others five.    At past six weeks of age they were exactly as Mr. Eisen had described  them to me.  Those I kept in confinement pupated on a bed of baked  gravel, in a tin bucket.  It is imperative to bake any earth or sand  used for them to kill pests invisible to the eye, that might bore into  the pupa cases and destroy the moths.    I watched the transformation with intense interest.  After the  caterpillars had finished eating they travelled in search of a  place to burrow for a day or two.  Then they gave up, and lay  quietly  on the sand.  The colour darkened hourly, the feet and  claspers seemed to draw inside, and one morning on going to look  there were some greenish brown pupae.  They shone as if freshly  varnished, as indeed they were, for the substance provided to  facilitate the emergence of the pupae from the caterpillar skins  dries in a coating, that helps to harden the cases and protect them.  These pupae had burst the skins at the thorax, and escaped by  working the abdomen until they lay an inch or so from the skins.    What a \"cast off garment\" those skins were!  Only the frailest  outside covering, complete in all parts, and rapidly turning to  a dirty brown.  The pupae were laid away in a large box having a  glass lid.  It was filled with baked sand, covered with sphagnum  moss, slightly dampened occasionally, and placed where it was  cool, but never at actual freezing point.  The following spring  after the delight of seeing them emerge, they were released, for  I secured a male to complete my collection a few days later, and  only grew the caterpillars to prove it possible.    There was a carnival in the village, and, for three nights the  streets were illuminated brightly from end to end, to the height  of Ferris wheels and diving towers.  The lights must have shone  against the sky for miles around, for they  drew from the Limberlost,  from the Canoper, from Rainbow Bottom, and the Valley of the Wood Robin,  their winged creatures of night.    I know Emperors appear in these places in my  locality, for the  caterpillars feed on leaves found there, and enter the ground to  pupate; so of course the moth of June begins its life in the same  location.  Mr. Pettis found the mated pair he brought to me, on a  bush at the edge of a swamp.  They also emerge in cities under any  tree on which their caterpillars feed.  Once late in May, in the  corner of a lichen-covered, old snake fence beside the Wabash on  the Shimp farm, I made a series of studies of the home life of a pair  of ground sparrows.  They had chosen for a location a slight  depression covered with a rank growth of meadow grass.  Overhead  wild plum and thorn in full bloom lay white-sheeted against the  blue sky; red bud spread its purple haze, and at a curve, the  breast of the river gleamed white as ever woman's; while underfoot  the grass was obscured with masses of wild flowers.    An unusually fine cluster of white violets attracted me as I  worked around the birds, so on packing at the close of the day I  lifted the plant to carry home for my wild flower bed.  Below a  few inches of rotting leaves and black mould I found a lively  pupa of the Yellow Emperor.    So these moths emerge and deposit their eggs in the swamps,  forests, beside the river and wherever the trees on which they  feed grow.  When the serious business of life is over, attracted by  strong lights, they go with other pleasure seeking company, and  grace society by their royal presence.    I could have had half a dozen fine Imperialis moths during the  three nights of the carnival, and fluttering above buildings many  more could be seen that did not descend to our reach.  Raymond had  such a busy time capturing moths he missed most of the joys of  the carnival, but I truly think he liked the chase better.  One he  brought me, a female,"]]]
