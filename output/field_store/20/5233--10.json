We  have done a very satisfactory night's work, and I think we see our way  now to getting rid of most of those piratical craft, which will not  only be a benefit to traders on the coast of the river, but will greatly  please all the other chiefs, and will enable them to hold their own  against Sehi.\"    Five minutes were added to the promised quarter, and then the pipes were  laid down, and the boat proceeded at a steady stroke until they reached  the spot where they had fished.    \"Somewhere about here, lad?\"    \"Yes, sir, I think that this is just the place. I noticed that tall tree  rising above the general line just opposite where we were anchored.\"    \"Then lower the grapnel; in oars.\"    Another bottle was produced from the hamper; the lieutenant filled a  wine glass full and drank it off, and then passed the glass over to  Dick.    \"What is it, sir?\"    \"It is some grog, with a large dose of quinine. The doctor begged me to  give it an hour or two before daylight. Now, lads, you are each to take  a glass of this; it will protect you against the effect of the mist on  the river. You can show the lantern now; it is just as well that they  should see it if they are on the lookout.\"    Every man took his glass of the mixture.    \"Now wrap yourselves in your blankets, lads, and lie down for a couple  of hours' sleep.\"    After a minute or two's scuffling while each found a plank to suit  him, all was quiet in the boat. Dick, who felt far too excited over the  events of the night to be sleepy, had volunteered to keep watch, and,  lighting another pipe at the lantern, smoked till it was broad daylight.  Then he roused the crew, and in less than two hours afterwards they  rowed alongside the Serpent. The captain was greatly pleased with Mr.  Ferguson's report.    \"It is unlucky about that bar in the creek, otherwise we might have  taken the ship right into the pool, and fought it out with them there.  Still, it may be that this will be the best in the end, for we could  hardly have counted upon sinking the whole of them, and once past  us they would have been off like the wind; and though we might have  followed some of them, the others would have made off, some one way  and some another, whereas, by laying the vessel across the mouth of the  creek, we have a good chance of catching them all as they come down.  There is no doubt a lot more fellows have arrived to help the rajah; we  can see that there are a great many more about on the shore than there  have been before. I think things will come to a crisis before many hours  have passed. We have made out that men keep coming and going behind that  row of six huts facing the river, and I should not be surprised if they  are not hard at work establishing a battery there.\"    Presently two Malays, whom they recognized as belonging to the rajah's  council, advanced to the edge of the shore, which was but some fifty  yards away. One of them held a pole to which a white cloth was attached.    \"I have a message from the rajah,\" he shouted out. The captain sent for  the interpreter, and went to the side of the quarterdeck.    \"The rajah says that he does not want to have any more to say to you.  You want to take his country; he will not let you have it, and if you do  not go away in an hour, he will sink your ship.\"    \"Tell him,\" the captain said, \"that it will be the worse for him if he  tries it. I came up here at his invitation, and shall stay just as long  as I please.\"    The two Malays retired, walking in a quiet and dignified way.    The news soon ran through the ship of the defiance that had been given,  and excited the liveliest satisfaction. The men were shaking hands,  cutting capers, and indulging in much joking and laughter. Half an hour  later there was a sudden uproar in the town, drums were beaten, horns  sounded, and the Malays by the river bank speedily retired behind the  huts.    \"You had better get the magazine opened, Mr. Ferguson, and everything in  readiness, but we won't beat to quarters till they begin.\"    The tumult on shore increased, and soon a few shots were fired from  behind houses and walls, the balls whistling overhead.    \"There won't be much of that,\" the captain said, as he walked up and  down the quarterdeck with the first lieutenant; \"we have seen very few  guns among them. I should doubt if there are a hundred in the town. What  there are were, no doubt, captured from trading vessels the scoundrels  have plundered and burned.\"    A few minutes later the bamboos forming the wall of the six houses where  a bustle had been observed fell outward, the lashings having been cut  by a swarm of Malays, who, as soon as the last fell, ran back, showing  eight brass cannon.    \"Beat to quarters, Mr. Ferguson,\" the Captain said quietly, and at the  first tap of the drum the sailors, who had been expecting the order,  ran to their stations. As they gained them the little battery on shore  opened fire. Although the distance was but a hundred yards, only three  of the balls hit the hull, the others passing through the masts.    \"Load with grape,\" the captain ordered.    \"Captain Hugeson,\" he said to the Marine officer, \"will you place your  men on the poop, and tell them to open fire as soon as the guns send the  Malays flying from their battery? I can see that there are large numbers  gathered round it. Mr. Ferguson, will you see that the guns are all laid  on that battery? When they are ready, fire a broadside that will clear  the place out at once.\"    Two minutes later there was a crash as the whole of the guns on the  starboard side were discharged at the same moment. The effect was  tremendous, and the storm of grape swept away the whole of the buildings  beneath which the guns were standing. Three of these were dismounted,  and not one of the men who had been crowded round them remained on his  feet. Numbers were seen running away in all directions, and a volley  from the marines brought several of these down.    \"There is an end to the attack,\" the captain said quietly. \"Order the  men to load with shell, and to direct their aim in the first place at  the rajah's palace; there is no occasion for rapid firing.\"    Gun after gun sent its messenger into the palace, and in three or four  minutes flames were seen rising from it. The order was then given to  fire with grape at all the houses facing the water. In the meantime the  men were called from their guns on the port side, and the boats lowered.  The marines and all the sailors, save those serving the starboard guns,  took their places in them, the first lieutenant taking the command, and  on the word being given they dashed with a cheer towards the shore, and,  leaping out, formed up, and led by their officers ran forward, not a  shot being fired by the Malays as they did so.    The fire of the ship's guns was now directed towards the portion of the  town facing the forest, as it was here that the Malays would probably  be gathered. Port fires had been distributed among the landing party. As  these were lost to sight as they entered the town, those on board ship  watched eagerly for the sound of combat. Nothing, however, was heard for  a minute or two; then came a single shot, and then a rattle of musketry.    \"They are making a stand now,\" the captain said.    \"Mr. Hopkins, will you please go round and tell the gunners to be very  careful in their aim? Let them watch the smoke rising among the houses,  and aim a short distance beyond it. Impress upon them that it is better  to fire too far than to risk hurting our own men.\"    The order was obeyed; soon flames were seen to rise beyond the spot  where the fighting was going on, the resistance to the advance speedily  ceased, and a dropping fire took the place of the sustained roll of  musketry which, five minutes later, broke out again at the edge of the  town facing the wood, and the fire of the guns was now directed against  the edge of the forest, to which the Malays had evidently fled. In a few  minutes smoke began to rise all round the place, showing that the  men with port fires were at work, and in a quarter of an hour the  bluejackets and marines were seen issuing from the houses and coming  down to the shore. The place was by this time a sheet of fire, the  lightly built huts, dried in the heat of the sun, catching like tinder,  and blazing up in a fierce flame, that in a few minutes left no vestige  behind it.    The ship's fire had by this time ceased, and the sailors, as they looked  out of the portholes, cheered as the boats came up. Their appearance was  far less orderly than it had been when they put off from the ship, every  man having carted off some sort of loot--sarongs, spears, krises, and  other articles, some obtained from the huts, others thrown away by  the Malays in their flight. There were, too, some articles of European  manufacture, which had been carried off from the palace before the  flames had obtained entire possession. These were in themselves strong  proofs that the rajah's prahus had been engaged in piratical attacks  upon European craft, for they consisted of bales of silk, chronometers,  watches, double barreled guns, mirrors, and other articles which had  evidently formed a portion of a ship's fittings.    \"Any casualties, Mr. Ferguson?\" the captain asked, as the lieutenant  stepped on board.    \"Half a dozen spear wounds, sir, but only one of a serious nature; our  fire was too hot for them to face.\"    \"What do you suppose their loss has been?\"    \"As far as I can judge, sir, some eighty or ninety were killed by our  fire, and at least as many must have fallen in the battery; the place  was choked up with dead. I have brought the eight guns off; they are  only four pounders.\"    \"They may be useful for the boats. I see the men have brought off a good  deal of rubbish. You had better give orders that whatever there is is to  be fairly divided among all hands.

Thus, when the cuckoo starts  calling, you will see other small birds fly straight to the tree and  perch near him, apparently to listen. And among the listeners you will  find the sparrow and tits of various species--birds which are never  victimized by the cuckoo, and do not take him for a hawk since they take  no notice of him until the calling begins. The reason that the double  fluting call of the cuckoo is not mimicked by other birds is that they  can't; because that peculiar sound is not in their register. The  bubbling cry is reproduced by both the marsh warbler and the starling.  Again, it is my experience that when a nightingale starts singing, the  small birds near immediately become attentive, often suspending their  own songs and some flying to perch near him, and listen, just as they  listen to the cuckoo. Birds imitate the note or phrase that strikes them  most, and is easiest to imitate, as when the thrush copies the piping  and trilling of the redshank and the easy song of the ring-ouzel, which,  when incorporated into his own music, harmonizes with it perfectly. But  he cannot flute, and so never mimics the blackbird's song, although he  can and does, as we have seen, imitate its chuckling cry.    There is another thing to be considered. I believe that the bird, like  creatures in other classes, has his receptive period, his time to learn,  and that, like some mammals, he learns everything he needs to know in  his first year or two; and that, having acquired his proper song, he  adds little or nothing to it thereafter, although the song may increase  in power and brilliance when the bird comes to full maturity. This, I  think, holds true of all birds, like the nightingale, which have a  singing period of two or three months and are songless for the rest of  the year. That long, silent period cannot, so far as sounds go, be a  receptive one; the song early in life has become crystallized in the  form it will keep through life, and is like an intuitive act. This is  not the case with birds like the starling, that sing all the year  round--birds that are naturally loquacious and sing instead of screaming  and chirping like others. They are always borrowing new sounds and  always forgetting.    The most curious example of mimicry I have yet met with is that of a  true mocking-bird, Mimus patachonicus, a common resident species in  northern Patagonia, on the Atlantic side, very abundant in places. He is  a true mocking-bird because he belongs to the genus Mimus, a branch of  the thrush family, and not because he mocks or mimics the songs of other  species, like others of his kindred. He does not, in fact, mimic the set  songs of others, although he often introduces notes and phrases borrowed  from other species into his own performance. He sings in a sketchy way  all the year round, but in spring has a fuller unbroken song, emitted  with more power and passion. For the rest of the time he sings to amuse  himself, as it seems, in a peculiarly leisurely, and one may say,  indolent manner, perched on a bush, from time to time emitting a note or  two, then a phrase which, if it pleases him, he will repeat two or  three, or half a dozen times. Then, after a pause, other notes and  phrases, and so on, pretty well all day long. This manner of singing is  irritating, like the staccato song of our throstle, to a listener who  wants a continuous stream of song; but it becomes exceedingly  interesting when one discovers that the bird is thinking very much about  his own music, if one can use such an expression about a bird; that he  is all the time experimenting, trying to get a new phrase, a new  combination of the notes he knows and new notes. Also, that when sitting  on his bush and uttering these careless chance sounds, he is, at the  same time, intently listening to the others, all engaged in the same  way, singing and listening. You will see them all about the place, each  bird sitting motionless, like a grey and white image of a bird, on the  summit of his own bush. For, although he is not gregarious as a rule, a  number of pairs live near each other, and form a sort of loose  community. The bond that unites them is their music, for not only do  they sit within hearing distance, but they are perpetually mimicking  each other. One may say that they are accomplished mimics but prefer  mimicking their own to other species. But they only imitate the notes  that take their fancy, so to speak. Thus, occasionally, one strikes out  a phrase, a new expression, which appears to please him, and after a few  moments he repeats it again, then again, and so on and on, and if you  remain an hour within hearing he will perhaps be still repeating it at  short intervals. Now, if by chance there is something in the new phrase  which pleases the listeners too, you will note that they instantly  suspend their own singing, and for some little time they do nothing but  listen. By and by the new note or phrase will be exactly reproduced from  a bird on another bush; and he, too, will begin repeating it at short  intervals. Then a second one will get it, then a third, and eventually  all the birds in that thicket will have it. The constant repeating of  the new note may then go on for hours, and it may last longer. You may  return to the spot on the second day and sit for an hour or longer,  listening, and still hear that same note constantly repeated until you  are sick and tired of it, or it may even get on your nerves. I remember  that on one occasion I avoided a certain thicket, one of my favourite  daily haunts for three whole days, not to hear that one everlasting  sound; then I returned and to my great relief the birds were all at  their old game of composing, and not one uttered--perhaps he didn't  dare--the too hackneyed phrase. I was sharply reminded one day by an  incident in the village of this old Patagonian experience, and of the  strange human-like weakness or passion for something new and arresting  in music or song, something \"tuney\" or \"catchy.\"    It chanced that when I left London a new popular song had come out and  was \"all the rage,\" a tune and words invented or first produced in the  music-halls by a woman named Lottie Collins, with a chorus to  it--_Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay_, repeated several times. First caught up in  the music-halls it spread to the streets, and in ever-widening circles  over all London, and over all the land. In London people were getting  tired of hearing it, but when I arrived at my village \"in a hole,\" and  settled down among the Badgers, I heard it on every hand--in cottages,  in the streets, in the fields, men, women and children were singing,  whistling, and humming it, and in the evening at the inn roaring it out  with as much zest as if they had been singing _Rule Britannia._    This state of things lasted from May to the middle of June; then, one  very hot, still day, about three o'clock, I was sitting at my cottage  window when I caught the sound of a rumbling cart and a man singing. As  the noise grew louder my interest in the approaching man and cart was  excited to an extraordinary degree; never had I heard such a noise! And  no wonder, since the man was driving a heavy, springless farm cart in  the most reckless manner, urging his two huge horses to a fast trot,  then a gallop, up and down hill along those rough gully-like roads, he  standing up in his cart and roaring out \"Auld Lang Syne,\" at the top of  a voice of tremendous power. He was probably tipsy, but it was not a bad  voice, and the old familiar tune and words had an extraordinary effect  in that still atmosphere. He passed my cottage, standing up, his legs  wide apart, his cap on the back of his head, a big broad-chested young  man, lashing his horses, and then for about two minutes or longer the  thunder of the cart and the roaring song came back fainter, until it  faded away in the distance. At that still hour of the day the children  were all at school on the further side of the village; the men away in  the fields; the women shut up in their cottages, perhaps sleeping. It  seemed to me that I was the only person in the village who had witnessed  and heard the passing of the big-voiced man and cart. But it was not so.  At all events, next day, the whole village, men, women and children,  were singing, humming and whistling \"Auld Lang Syne,\" and \"Auld Lang  Syne\" lasted for several days, and from that day \"Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay\"  was heard no more. It had lost its charm.          VIII      Just out of hearing of the grasshopper warblers, there was a good-sized  pool of water on the common, probably an old gravel-pit, its bottom now  overgrown with rushes. A sedge warbler, the only one on the common,  lived in the masses of bramble and gorse on its banks; and birds of so  many kinds came to it to drink and bathe that the pool became a  favourite spot with me. One evening, just before sunset, as I lingered  near it, a pied wagtail darted out of some low scrub at my feet and  fluttered, as if wounded, over the turf for a space of ten or twelve  yards before flying away. Not many minutes after seeing the wagtail, a  reed-bunting--a bird which I had not previously observed on the  common--flew down and alighted on a bush a few yards from me, holding a  white crescent-shaped grub in its beak. I stood still to watch it,  certainly not expecting to see its nest and young; for, as a rule, a  bird with food in its beak will sit quietly until the watcher loses  patience and moves away; but on this occasion I had not been standing  more than ten seconds before the bunting flew down to a small tuft of  furze and was there greeted by the shrill, welcoming cries of its young.  I went up softly to the spot, when out sprang the old bird I had seen,  but only to drop to the ground just as the wagtail had done, to beat the"]]]
