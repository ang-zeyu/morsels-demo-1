He was then upstairs and she was expecting every moment that he would  come down and complete the bloody work he had begun. While the conversation  was going on the fiend made his appearance. A fiend he looked. He  brandished the knife, still wet with the blood of his wife.    \"The missionary, like the man among the tombs, had himself belonged to  the desperate classes. He was converted at the mouth of a coal pit. He  knew the disease and the remedy--knew how to handle a man on the borders  of delirium tremens.    \"Subdued by the tender tones, the mad man calmed down, and took a seat  on a box. But the talk was interrupted by the little girl, who approached  the missionary, and said: 'Don't talk to father; it won't do any good.  If talking would have saved him, he would have been saved long ago.  Mother has talked to him so much and so good. You must ask Jesus, who  saves to the uttermost, to save my poor father.'    \"Rebuked by the faith of the little girl, the missionary and the miserable  sinner knelt down together. He prayed as he never prayed before; he  entreated and interceded, in tones so tender and fervent that it melted  the desperate man, who cried for mercy. And mercy came. He bowed in  penitence before the Lord and lay down that night on his pallet of straw  a pardoned soul.    \"Relief came to that dwelling. The wife was lifted from her dirty couch,  and her home was made comfortable. On Sunday, the reformed man took the  hand of his little girl and entered the infant class to learn something  about the Savior 'who saves to the uttermost.' He entered upon a new  life. His reform was thorough. He found good employment, for when sober  he was an excellent workman; and next to his Savior, he blesses God for  the faith of his little girl, who believed in a Savior able to save to  the uttermost all that come unto God by him.\"        A WONDERFUL CHILDREN'S MEETING    [Illustration: She had not talked long until nearly every child in the  room was in tears.]    Several years ago, when residing at G----, we became acquainted with  Sister W---- who was especially fond of children. Her own were grown,  and desiring to make a home for some homeless child, she went to the  county farm, where there were several, in search of one. Among the  children there she found a beautiful, little, bright-eyed girl, about  nine years old, named Ida. Her heart went out to her at once and she  expressed to the lady in charge her desire to take Ida, and her willingness  to care for her as she would if she were her own child.    But the matron said \"Oh, you have no idea what a terrible child she is!  We can do nothing with her, she is stubborn and has an awful temper and  it is impossible to control her. We are intending to send her to the  Girl's Reform School.\"    Sister W---- who was an earnest Christian, was surprised but not  discouraged. She could not bear the thought of such a little child being  sent to such a place and so she said to the matron: \"Well, I'd like to  take her with me and see if I cannot help her to be good.\"    \"Well,\" said the matron, \"you can try her if you want to, but you will  be glad to bring her back again.\"    Acting upon this permission, Sister W---- talked with Ida and easily  gained her consent to go with her. Not many days had passed before she  found that there was considerable reason for what the matron had said.  Ida was hard to control and at times became terribly angry without cause;  but Sister W---- prayed for her and dealt patiently and tenderly with  her and told her how Jesus loved her, and would help her to be good if  she would only give him her heart. Her prayers and loving labor were not  in vain and it was not very long until little Ida was converted. The  change was so great that all who were with her could plainly see that  Jesus had indeed given her a new heart.    Soon after this we had charge of a children's meeting held in a mission  hall in G----. Among the children gathered there were many of the worst  boys in town. Little Ida was present. We knew how much Jesus had done  for her and felt led of the Spirit to ask her to lead the meeting. She  looked up at us much surprised but her little heart was full of the love  of God and she consented to do the best she could. Words cannot describe  what followed. In tears, Ida told, in her own touching way, how Jesus  had saved her--just what a naughty girl she had been before she was  converted but how Jesus had \"taken the angry all away\" and given her a  new heart so that she loved everybody and loved to do what was right.  Then she pled with them to give their hearts to God, and told them how  Jesus died on the cross for them, and how He loved them and wanted to  save them.    She had not talked long until nearly every child in the room was in  tears, and how shall we describe that touching scene? We had an altar  service. Ida knelt with those who were seeking and prayed for them and  told them how to find Jesus; and right there many were converted and  gave bright, clear testimonies that their sins were forgiven and Jesus  had given them new hearts. Thus did God that day honor a little girl's  testimony and exhortation and fulfill His own work, \"A little child shall  lead them.\"    Very often do we call to mind that scene, and we find it one of the  sweetest of the memories of years of evangelistic work.    --Editor.        \"THEY ARE NOT STRANGERS, MAMA\"    Not long ago I stood by the death-bed of a little girl. From her birth  she had been afraid of death. Every fiber of her body and soul recoiled  from the thought of it, \"Don't let me die,\" she said; \"don't let me die.  Hold me fast Oh, I can't go!\"    \"Jennie\" I said, \"You have two little brothers in the other world, and  there are thousands of tenderhearted people over there, who will love  you and take care of you.\"    But she cried out again despairingly: \"Don't let me go; they are strangers  over there.\" She was a little country girl, strong limbed, fleet of foot,  tanned in the face; she was raised on the frontier, the fields were her  home. In vain we tried to reconcile her to the death that was inevitable.  \"Hold me fast,\" she cried; \"don't let me go.\" But even as she was pleading,  her little hands relaxed their clinging hold from my waist, and lifted  themselves eagerly aloft; lifted themselves with such straining effort,  that they lifted the wasted little body from its reclining position among  the pillows. Her face was turned upward, but it was her eyes that told  the story. They were filled with the light of Divine recognition. They  saw something plainly that we could not see; and they grew brighter and  brighter, and her little hand quivered in eagerness to go, where strange  portals had opened upon her astonished vision. But even in that supreme  moment she did not forget to leave a word of comfort for those who would  gladly have died in her place: \"Mama,\" she was saying, \"Mama, they are  not strangers. I'm not afraid.\" And every instant the light burned more  gloriously in her blue eyes till at last it seemed as if her soul leaped  forth upon its radiant waves; and in that moment her trembling form  relapsed among its pillows and she was gone.    --_Chicago Woman's World_        JESSIE FINDING JESUS    A little girl in a wretched tenement in New York stood by her mother's  death-bed, and heard her last words: \"Jessie, find Jesus.\"    When her mother was buried, her father took to drink, and Jessie was  left to such care as a poor neighbor could give her. One day she wandered  off unnoticed, with a little basket in her hand, and tugged through one  street after another, not knowing where she went. She had started out  to find Jesus. At last she stopped from utter weariness, in front of a  saloon. A young man staggered out of the door, and almost stumbled over  her. He uttered passionately the name of Him whom she was seeking. \"Where  is He?\" she inquired eagerly. He looked at her in amazement.    \"What did you say?\" he asked.    \"Will you please tell me where Jesus Christ is? for I _must_ find  Him\"--this time with great earnestness.    The young man looked at her curiously for a minute without speaking, and  then his face sobered; and he said in a broken, husky voice, hopelessly:  \"I don't know, child; I don't know where he is.\"    [Illustration]    At length the little girl's wanderings brought her to the park. A woman  evidently a Jewess, was leaning against the railing, looking disconsolately  at the green grass and the trees.    Jessie went up to her timidly. \"Perhaps she can tell me where He is,\"  was the child's thought. In a low, hesitating voice, she asked the woman:  \"Do you know Jesus Christ?\"    The Jewess turned fiercely to face her questioner and in a tone of  suppressed passion, exclaimed: \"Jesus Christ is dead!\" Poor Jessie trudged  on, but soon a rude boy jostled against her, and snatching her basket  from her hand, threw it into the street.    [Illustration]    Crying, she ran to pick it up. The horses of a passing street car trampled  her under their feet--and she knew no more till she found herself stretched  on a hospital bed.    When the doctors came that night, they knew she could not live until  morning. In the middle of the night, after she had been lying very still  for a long time, apparently asleep, she suddenly opened her eyes and the  nurse, bending over her, heard her whisper, while her face lighted up  with a smile that had some of heaven's own gladness in it: \"Oh, Jesus, I  have found you at last!\"    Then the tiny lips were hushed, but the questioning spirit had received  an answer.    --Selected.        \"I'LL NEVER STEAL AGAIN--IF FATHER KILLS ME FOR IT\"    A friend of mine, seeking for objects of charity, got into the room of  a tenement house. It was vacant. He saw a ladder pushed through the  ceiling."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7028"],[0,"The Clicking of Cuthbert (#12)"],[1,"a step-mother to his eleven drivers, his baffy, his twenty-eight  putters, and the rest of the ninety-four clubs which he had accumulated  in the course of his golfing career. The sole stipulation, of course,  which he made when dreaming his daydreams was that the future Mrs.  Sturgis must be a golfer. I can still recall the horror in his face  when one girl, admirable in other respects, said that she had never  heard of Harry Vardon, and didn't he mean Dolly Vardon? She has since  proved an excellent wife and mother, but Mortimer Sturgis never spoke  to her again.    With the coming of January, it was Mortimer's practice to leave England  and go to the South of France, where there was sunshine and crisp dry  turf. He pursued his usual custom this year. With his suit-case and his  ninety-four clubs he went off to Saint Brule, staying as he always did  at the Hotel Superbe, where they knew him, and treated with an amiable  tolerance his habit of practising chip-shots in his bedroom. On the  first evening, after breaking a statuette of the Infant Samuel in  Prayer, he dressed and went down to dinner. And the first thing he saw  was Her.    Mortimer Sturgis, as you know, had been engaged before, but Betty  Weston had never inspired the tumultuous rush of emotion which the mere  sight of this girl had set loose in him. He told me later that just to  watch her holing out her soup gave him a sort of feeling you get when  your drive collides with a rock in the middle of a tangle of rough and  kicks back into the middle of the fairway. If golf had come late in  life to Mortimer Sturgis, love came later still, and just as the golf,  attacking him in middle life, had been some golf, so was the love  considerable love. Mortimer finished his dinner in a trance, which is  the best way to do it at some hotels, and then scoured the place for  someone who would introduce him. He found such a person eventually and  the meeting took place.           *       *       *       *       *    She was a small and rather fragile-looking girl, with big blue eyes and  a cloud of golden hair. She had a sweet expression, and her left wrist  was in a sling. She looked up at Mortimer as if she had at last found  something that amounted to something. I am inclined to think it was a  case of love at first sight on both sides.    \"Fine weather we're having,\" said Mortimer, who was a capital  conversationalist.    \"Yes,\" said the girl.    \"I like fine weather.\"    \"So do I.\"    \"There's something about fine weather!\"    \"Yes.\"    \"It's--it's--well, fine weather's so much finer than weather that isn't  fine,\" said Mortimer.    He looked at the girl a little anxiously, fearing he might be taking  her out of her depth, but she seemed to have followed his train of  thought perfectly.    \"Yes, isn't it?\" she said. \"It's so--so fine.\"    \"That's just what I meant,\" said Mortimer. \"So fine. You've just hit  it.\"    He was charmed. The combination of beauty with intelligence is so rare.    \"I see you've hurt your wrist,\" he went on, pointing to the sling.    \"Yes. I strained it a little playing in the championship.\"    \"The championship?\" Mortimer was interested. \"It's awfully rude of me,\"  he said, apologetically, \"but I didn't catch your name just now.\"    \"My name is Somerset.\"    Mortimer had been bending forward solicitously. He overbalanced and  nearly fell off his chair. The shock had been stunning. Even before he  had met and spoken to her, he had told himself that he loved this girl  with the stored-up love of a lifetime. And she was Mary Somerset! The  hotel lobby danced before Mortimer's eyes.    The name will, of course, be familiar to you. In the early rounds of  the Ladies' Open Golf Championship of that year nobody had paid much  attention to Mary Somerset. She had survived her first two matches, but  her opponents had been nonentities like herself. And then, in the third  round, she had met and defeated the champion. From that point on, her  name was on everybody's lips. She became favourite. And she justified  the public confidence by sailing into the final and winning easily. And  here she was, talking to him like an ordinary person, and, if he could  read the message in her eyes, not altogether indifferent to his charms,  if you could call them that.    \"Golly!\" said Mortimer, awed.           *       *       *       *       *    Their friendship ripened rapidly, as friendships do in the South of  France. In that favoured clime, you find the girl and Nature does the  rest. On the second morning of their acquaintance Mortimer invited her  to walk round the links with him and watch him play. He did it a little  diffidently, for his golf was not of the calibre that would be likely  to extort admiration from a champion. On the other hand, one should  never let slip the opportunity of acquiring wrinkles on the game, and  he thought that Miss Somerset, if she watched one or two of his shots,  might tell him just what he ought to do. And sure enough, the opening  arrived on the fourth hole, where Mortimer, after a drive which  surprised even himself, found his ball in a nasty cuppy lie.    He turned to the girl.    \"What ought I to do here?\" he asked.    Miss Somerset looked at the ball. She seemed to be weighing the matter  in her mind.    \"Give it a good hard knock,\" she said.    Mortimer knew what she meant. She was advocating a full iron. The only  trouble was that, when he tried anything more ambitious than a  half-swing, except off the tee, he almost invariably topped. However,  he could not fail this wonderful girl, so he swung well back and took a  chance. His enterprise was rewarded. The ball flew out of the  indentation in the turf as cleanly as though John Henry Taylor had been  behind it, and rolled, looking neither to left nor to right, straight  for the pin. A few moments later Mortimer Sturgis had holed out one  under bogey, and it was only the fear that, having known him for so  short a time, she might be startled and refuse him that kept him from  proposing then and there. This exhibition of golfing generalship on her  part had removed his last doubts. He knew that, if he lived for ever,  there could be no other girl in the world for him. With her at his  side, what might he not do? He might get his handicap down to six--to  three--to scratch--to plus something! Good heavens, why, even the  Amateur Championship was not outside the range of possibility. Mortimer  Sturgis shook his putter solemnly in the air, and vowed a silent vow  that he would win this pearl among women.    Now, when a man feels like that, it is impossible to restrain him long.  For a week Mortimer Sturgis's soul sizzled within him: then he could  contain himself no longer. One night, at one of the informal dances at  the hotel, he drew the girl out on to the moonlit terrace.    \"Miss Somerset----\" he began, stuttering with emotion like an  imperfectly-corked bottle of ginger-beer. \"Miss Somerset--may I call  you Mary?\"    The girl looked at him with eyes that shone softly in the dim light.    \"Mary?\" she repeated. \"Why, of course, if you like----\"    \"If I like!\" cried Mortimer. \"Don't you know that it is my dearest  wish? Don't you know that I would rather be permitted to call you Mary  than do the first hole at Muirfield in two? Oh, Mary, how I have longed  for this moment! I love you! I love you! Ever since I met you I have  known that you were the one girl in this vast world whom I would die to  win! Mary, will you be mine? Shall we go round together? Will you fix  up a match with me on the links of life which shall end only when the  Grim Reaper lays us both a stymie?\"    She drooped towards him.    \"Mortimer!\" she murmured.    He held out his arms, then drew back. His face had grown suddenly  tense, and there were lines of pain about his mouth.    \"Wait!\" he said, in a strained voice. \"Mary, I love you dearly, and  because I love you so dearly I cannot let you trust your sweet life to  me blindly. I have a confession to make, I am not--I have not always  been\"--he paused--\"a good man,\" he said, in a low voice.    She started indignantly.    \"How can you say that? You are the best, the kindest, the bravest man I  have ever met! Who but a good man would have risked his life to save me  from drowning?\"    \"Drowning?\" Mortimer's voice seemed perplexed. \"You? What do you mean?\"    \"Have you forgotten the time when I fell in the sea last week, and you  jumped in with all your clothes on----\"    \"Of course, yes,\" said Mortimer. \"I remember now. It was the day I did  the long seventh in five. I got off a good tee-shot straight down the  fairway, took a baffy for my second, and---- But that is not the point.  It is sweet and generous of you to think so highly of what was the  merest commonplace act of ordinary politeness, but I must repeat, that  judged by the standards of your snowy purity, I am not a good man. I do  not come to you clean and spotless as a young girl should expect her  husband to come to her. Once, playing in a foursome, my ball fell in  some long grass. Nobody was near me. We had no caddies, and the others  were on the fairway. God knows----\" His voice shook. \"God knows I  struggled against the temptation. But I fell. I kicked the ball on to a  little bare mound, from which it was an easy task with a nice  half-mashie to reach the green for a snappy seven. Mary, there have  been times when, going round by myself, I have allowed myself ten-foot  putts on three holes in succession, simply in order to be able to say I  had done the course in under a hundred. Ah! you shrink from me! You are  disgusted!\"    \"I'm not disgusted! And I don't shrink! I only shivered because it is  rather cold.\"    \"Then you can love me in spite of my past?\"    \"Mortimer!\"    She fell into his arms.    \"My dearest,\" he said presently, \"what a happy life ours will be. That  is, if you do not find that you have made a mistake.\"    \"A mistake!\" she cried, scornfully."]]]
