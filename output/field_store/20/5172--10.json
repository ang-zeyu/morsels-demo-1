They followed Jack to the West. Thus vanished all  hopes of sympathy or relief from this source to Frado. There seemed no  one capable of enduring the oppressions of the house but her. She turned  to the darkness of the future with the determination previously formed,  to remain until she should be eighteen. Jane begged her to follow her so  soon as she should be released; but so wearied out was she by her  mistress, she felt disposed to flee from any and every one having her  similitude of name or feature.          CHAPTER XI.    MARRIAGE AGAIN.        Crucified the hopes that cheered me,      All that to the earth endeared me;      Love of wealth and fame and power,      Love,--all have been crucified.        C. E.      DARKNESS before day. Jane left, but Jack was now to come again. After  Mary's death he visited home, leaving a wife behind. An orphan whose  home was with a relative, gentle, loving, the true mate of kind,  generous Jack. His mother was a stranger to her, of course, and had  perfect right to interrogate:    \"Is she good looking, Jack?\" asked his mother.    \"Looks well to me,\" was the laconic reply.    \"Was her FATHER rich?\"    \"Not worth a copper, as I know of; I never asked him,\" answered Jack.    \"Hadn't she any property? What did you marry her for,\" asked his mother.    \"Oh, she's WORTH A MILLION dollars, mother, though not a cent of it is  in money.\"    \"Jack! what do you want to bring such a poor being into the family, for?  You'd better stay here, at home, and let your wife go. Why couldn't you  try to do better, and not disgrace your parents?\"    \"Don't judge, till you see her,\" was Jack's reply, and immediately  changed the subject. It was no recommendation to his mother, and she did  not feel prepared to welcome her cordially now he was to come with his  wife. He was indignant at his mother's advice to desert her. It rankled  bitterly in his soul, the bare suggestion. He had more to bring. He now  came with a child also. He decided to leave the West, but not his  family.    Upon their arrival, Mrs. B. extended a cold welcome to her new daughter,  eyeing her dress with closest scrutiny. Poverty was to her a disgrace,  and she could not associate with any thus dishonored. This coldness was  felt by Jack's worthy wife, who only strove the harder to recommend  herself by her obliging, winning ways.    Mrs. B. could never let Jack be with her alone without complaining of  this or that deficiency in his wife.    He cared not so long as the complaints were piercing his own ears. He  would not have Jenny disquieted. He passed his time in seeking  employment.    A letter came from his brother Lewis, then at the South, soliciting his  services. Leaving his wife, he repaired thither.    Mrs. B. felt that great restraint was removed, that Jenny was more in  her own power. She wished to make her feel her inferiority; to relieve  Jack of his burden if he would not do it himself. She watched her  incessantly, to catch at some act of Jenny's which might be construed  into conjugal unfaithfulness.    Near by were a family of cousins, one a young man of Jack's age, who,  from love to his cousin, proffered all needful courtesy to his stranger  relative. Soon news reached Jack that Jenny was deserting her covenant  vows, and had formed an illegal intimacy with his cousin. Meantime Jenny  was told by her mother-inlaw that Jack did not marry her untrammelled.  He had another love whom he would be glad, even now, if he could, to  marry. It was very doubtful if he ever came for her.    Jenny would feel pained by her unwelcome gossip, and, glancing at her  child, she decided, however true it might be, she had a pledge which  would enchain him yet. Ere long, the mother's inveterate hate crept out  into some neighbor's enclosure, and, caught up hastily, they passed the  secret round till it became none, and Lewis was sent for, the brother by  whom Jack was employed. The neighbors saw her fade in health and  spirits; they found letters never reached their destination when sent by  either. Lewis arrived with the joyful news that he had come to take  Jenny home with him.    What a relief to her to be freed from the gnawing taunts of her  adversary.    Jenny retired to prepare for the journey, and Mrs. B. and Henry had a  long interview. Next morning he informed Jenny that new clothes would be  necessary, in order to make her presentable to Baltimore society, and he  should return without her, and she must stay till she was suitably  attired.    Disheartened, she rushed to her room, and, after relief from weeping,  wrote to Jack to come; to have pity on her, and take her to him. No  answer came. Mrs. Smith, a neighbor, watchful and friendly, suggested  that she write away from home, and employ some one to carry it to the  office who would elude Mrs. B., who, they very well knew, had  intercepted Jenny's letter, and influenced Lewis to leave her behind.  She accepted the offer, and Frado succeeded in managing the affair so  that Jack soon came to the rescue, angry, wounded, and forever after  alienated from his early home and his mother. Many times would Frado  steal up into Jenny's room, when she knew she was tortured by her  mistress' malignity, and tell some of her own encounters with her, and  tell her she might \"be sure it wouldn't kill her, for she should have  died long before at the same treatment.\"    Susan and her child succeeded Jenny as visitors. Frado had merged into  womanhood, and, retaining what she had learned, in spite of the few  privileges enjoyed formerly, was striving to enrich her mind. Her  school-books were her constant companions, and every leisure moment was  applied to them. Susan was delighted to witness her progress, and some  little book from her was a reward sufficient for any task imposed,  however difficult. She had her book always fastened open near her, where  she could glance from toil to soul refreshment. The approaching spring  would close the term of years which Mrs. B. claimed as the period of her  servitude. Often as she passed the waymarks of former years did she  pause to ponder on her situation, and wonder if she COULD succeed in  providing for her own wants. Her health was delicate, yet she resolved  to try.    Soon she counted the time by days which should release her. Mrs. B. felt  that she could not well spare one who could so well adapt herself to all  departments--man, boy, housekeeper, domestic, etc. She begged Mrs. Smith  to talk with her, to show her how ungrateful it would appear to leave a  home of such comfort--how wicked it was to be ungrateful! But Frado  replied that she had had enough of such comforts; she wanted some new  ones; and as it was so wicked to be ungrateful, she would go from  temptation; Aunt Abby said \"we mustn't put ourselves in the way of  temptation.\"    Poor little Fido! She shed more tears over him than over all beside.    The morning for departure dawned. Frado engaged to work for a family a  mile distant. Mrs. Bellmont dismissed her with the assurance that she  would soon wish herself back again, and a present of a silver  half-dollar.    Her wardrobe consisted of one decent dress, without any superfluous  accompaniments. A Bible from Susan she felt was her greatest treasure.    Now was she alone in the world. The past year had been one of suffering  resulting from a fall, which had left her lame.    The first summer passed pleasantly, and the wages earned were expended  in garments necessary for health and cleanliness. Though feeble, she was  well satisfied with her progress. Shut up in her room, after her toil  was finished, she studied what poor samples of apparel she had, and, for  the first time, prepared her own garments.    Mrs. Moore, who employed her, was a kind friend to her, and attempted to  heal her wounded spirit by sympathy and advice, burying the past in the  prospects of the future. But her failing health was a cloud no kindly  human hand could dissipate. A little light work was all she could  accomplish. A clergyman, whose family was small, sought her, and she was  removed there. Her engagement with Mrs. Moore finished in the fall.  Frado was anxious to keep up her reputation for efficiency, and often  pressed far beyond prudence. In the winter she entirely gave up work,  and confessed herself thoroughly sick. Mrs. Hale, soon overcome by  additional cares, was taken sick also, and now it became necessary to  adopt some measures for Frado's comfort, as well as to relieve Mrs.  Hale. Such dark forebodings as visited her as she lay, solitary and sad,  no moans or sighs could relieve.    The family physician pronounced her case one of doubtful issue. Frado  hoped it was final. She could not feel relentings that her former home  was abandoned, and yet, should she be in need of succor could she obtain  it from one who would now so grudgingly bestow it? The family were  applied to, and it was decided to take her there. She was removed to a  room built out from the main building, used formerly as a workshop,  where cold and rain found unobstructed access, and here she fought with  bitter reminiscences and future prospects till she became reckless of  her faith and hopes and person, and half wished to end what nature  seemed so tardily to take.    Aunt Abby made her frequent visits, and at last had her removed to her  own apartment, where she might supply her wants, and minister to her  once more in heavenly things.    Then came the family consultation.    \"What is to be done with her,\" asked Mrs. B., \"after she is moved there  with Nab?\"    \"Send for the Dr., your brother,\" Mr. B. replied.    \"When?\"    \"To-night.\"    \"To-night! and for her! Wait till morning,\" she continued.    \"She has waited too long now; I think something should be done soon.\"    \"I doubt if she is much sick,\" sharply interrupted Mrs. B.    \"Well, we'll see what our brother thinks.\"    His coming was longed for by Frado,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891"],[0,"Travels in West Africa: Congo Français, Corisco and Cameroons (#12)"],[1,"absence of manioc.  Manioc is grown on Fernando Po, but only by the Portos.  The Bubi  cultivated plants are yams (Dioscorea alata), koko (Colocasia  esculenta--the taro of the South Seas,) and plantains.  Their farms  are well kept, particularly those in the grass districts by San  Carlos Bay.  The yams of the Cordillera districts are the best  flavoured, but those of the east coast the largest.  Palm-oil is  used for domestic purposes in the usual ways, and palm wine both  fresh and fermented is the ordinary native drink.  Rum is held in  high esteem, but used in a general way in moderation as a cordial  and a treat, for the Bubi is, like the rest of the West African  natives, by no means an habitual drunkard.  Gin he dislikes. {55}    And I may remark you will find the same opinion in regard to the  Dualla in Cameroons river--on the undeniable authority of Dr.  Buchner, and my own extensive experience of the West Coast bears it  out.    Physically the Bubis are a fairly well-formed race of medium height;  they are decidedly inferior to the Benga or the Krus, but quite on a  level with the Effiks.  The women indeed are very comely:  their  colour is bronze and their skin the skin of the Bantu.  Beards are  not uncommon among the men, and these give their faces possibly more  than anything else, a different look to the faces of the Effiks or  the Duallas.  Indeed the people physically most like the Bubis that  I have ever seen, are undoubtedly the Bakwiri of Cameroons Mountain,  who are also liable to be bearded, or possibly I should say more  liable to wear beards, for a good deal of the African hairlessness  you hear commented on--in the West African at any rate--arises from  his deliberately pulling his hair out--his beard, moustache,  whiskers, and, occasionally, as among the Fans, his eyebrows.    Dr. Baumann, the great authority on the Bubi language says it is a  Bantu stock. {56}  I know nothing of it myself save that it is harsh  in sound.  Their method of counting is usually by fives but they are  notably weak in arithmetical ability, differing in this particular  from the mainlanders, and especially from their Negro neighbours,  who are very good at figures, surpassing the Bantu in this, as  indeed they do in most branches of intellectual activity.    But the most remarkable instance of inferiority the Bubis display is  their ignorance regarding methods of working iron.  I do not know  that iron in a native state is found on Fernando Po, but scrap-iron  they have been in touch with for some hundreds of years.  The  mainlanders are all cognisant of native methods of working iron,  although many tribes of them now depend entirely on European trade  for their supply of knives, etc., and this difference between them  and the Bubis would seem to indicate that the migration of the  latter to the island must have taken place at a fairly remote  period, a period before the iron-working tribes came down to the  coast.  Of course, if you take the Bubi's usual explanation of his  origin, namely that he came out of the crater on the top of Clarence  Peak, this argument falls through; but he has also another legend,  one moreover which is likewise to be found upon the mainland, which  says he was driven from the district north of the Gaboon estuary by  the coming of the M'pongwe to the coast, and as this legend is the  more likely of the two I think we may accept it as true, or nearly  so.  But what adds another difficulty to the matter is that the Bubi  is not only unlearned in iron lore, but he was learned in stone, and  up to the time of the youth of many Porto-negroes on Fernando Po, he  was making and using stone implements, and none of the tribes within  the memory of man have done this on the mainland.  It is true that  up the Niger and about Benin and Axim you get polished stone celts,  but these are regarded as weird affairs,--thunderbolts--and suitable  only for grinding up and making into medicine; there is no trace in  the traditions of these places, as far as I have been able to find,  of any time at which stone implements were in common use, and  certainly the M'pongwe have not been a very long time on the coast,  for their coming is still remembered in their traditions.  The Bubi  stone implements I have seen twice, but on neither occasion could I  secure one, and although I have been long promised specimens from  Fernando Po, I have not yet received them.  They are difficult to  procure, because none of the present towns are on really old sites,  the Bubi, like most Bantus, moving pretty frequently, either because  the ground is witched, demonstrated by outbreaks of sickness, or  because another village-full of his fellow creatures, or a horrid  white man plantation-making, has come too close to him.  A Roman  Catholic priest in Ka Congo once told me a legend he laughed much  over, of how a fellow priest had enterprisingly settled himself one  night in the middle of a Bubi village with intent to devote the  remainder of his life to quietly but thoroughly converting it.  Next  morning, when he rose up, he found himself alone, the people having  taken all their portable possessions and vanished to build another  village elsewhere.  The worthy Father spent some time chivying his  flock about the forest, but in vain, and he returned home disgusted,  deciding that the Creator, for some wise purpose, had dedicated the  Bubis to the Devil.    The spears used by this interesting people are even to this day made  entirely of wood, and have such a Polynesian look about them that I  intend some time or other to bring some home and experiment on that  learned Polynesian-culture-expert, Baron von Hugel, with them: --  intellectually experiment, not physically, pray understand.    The pottery has a very early-man look about it, but in this it does  not differ much from that of the mainland, which is quite as poor,  and similarly made without a wheel, and sun-baked.  Those pots of  the Bubis I have seen have, however, not had the pattern (any sort  of pattern does, and it need not be carefully done) that runs round  mainland pots to \"keep their souls in\"--i.e. to prevent their  breaking up on their own account.    The basket-work of the Bubis is of a superior order:  the baskets  they make to hold the palm oil are excellent, and will hold water  like a basin, but I am in doubt whether this art is original, or  imported by the Portuguese runaway slaves, for they put me very much  in mind of those made by my old friends the Kabinders, from whom a  good many of those slaves were recruited.  I think there is little  doubt that several of the musical instruments own this origin,  particularly their best beloved one, the elibo.  This may be  described as a wooden bell having inside it for clappers several  (usually five) pieces of stick threaded on a bit of wood jammed into  the dome of the bell and striking the rim, beyond which the clappers  just protrude.  These bells are very like those you meet with in  Angola, but I have not seen on the island, nor does Dr. Baumann cite  having seen, the peculiar double bell of Angola--the engongui.  The  Bubi bell is made out of one piece of wood and worked--or played--  with both hands.  Dr. Baumann says it is customary on bright  moonlight nights for two lines of men to sit facing each other and  to clap--one can hardly call it ring--these bells vigorously, but in  good time, accompanying this performance with a monotonous song,  while the delighted women and children dance round.  The learned  doctor evidently sees the picturesqueness of this practice, but  notes that the words of the songs are not \"tiefsinnige\" (profound),  as he has heard men for hours singing \"The shark bites the Bubi's  hand,\" only that over and over again and nothing more.  This agrees  with my own observations of all Bantu native songs.  I have always  found that the words of these songs were either the repetition of  some such phrase as this, or a set of words referring to the recent  adventures or experiences of the singer or the present company's  little peculiarities; with a very frequent chorus, old and  conventional.    The native tunes used with these songs are far superior, and I  expect many of them are very old.  They are often full of variety  and beauty, particularly those of the M'pongwe and Igalwa, of which  I will speak later.    The dances I have no personal knowledge of, but there is nothing in  Baumann's description to make one think they are distinct in  themselves from the mainland dances.  I once saw a dance at Fernando  Po, but that was among Portos, and it was my old friend the Batuco  in all its beauty.  But there is a distinct peculiarity about the  places the dances are held on, every village having a kept piece of  ground outside it which is the dancing place for the village--the  ball-room as it were; and exceedingly picturesque these dances must  be, for they are mostly held during the nights of full moon.  These  kept grounds remind one very much of the similar looking patches of  kept grass one sees in villages in Ka Congo, but there is no  similarity in their use, for the Ka Congo lawns are of fetish, not  frivolous, import.    The Bubis have an instrument I have never seen in an identical form  on the mainland.  It is made like a bow, with a tense string of  fibre.  One end of the bow is placed against the mouth, and the  string is then struck by the right hand with a small round stick,  while with the left it is scraped with a piece of shell or a knife-  blade.  This excruciating instrument, I warn any one who may think  of living among the Bubis, is very popular.  The drums used are both  the Dualla form--all wood--and the ordinary skin-covered drum, and I  think if I catalogue fifes made of wood, I shall have nearly  finished the Bubi orchestra.  I have doubts on this point because I  rather question whether I may be allowed to refer to a very old  bullock hide-"]]]
