This lane opened  into wider, lighter space.  The cold air bore a sweet perfume--whether  of flowers or fruit Dick could not tell.  Ladd rode on for perhaps a  quarter of a mile, though it seemed interminably long to Dick.  A grove  of trees loomed dark in the gray morning.  Ladd entered it and was lost  in the shade.  Dick rode on among trees.  Presently he heard voices,  and soon another house, low and flat like the others, but so long he  could not see the farther end, stood up blacker than the trees.  As he  dismounted, cramped and sore, he could scarcely stand.  Lash came  alongside. He spoke, and some one with a big, hearty voice replied to  him. Then it seemed to Dick that he was led into blackness like pitch,  where, presently, he felt blankets thrown on him and then his drowsy  faculties faded.        IV    FORLORN RIVER    WHEN Dick opened his eyes a flood of golden sunshine streamed in at the  open window under which he lay.  His first thought was one of blank  wonder as to where in the world he happened to be.  The room was large,  square, adobe-walled.  It was littered with saddles, harness, blankets.  Upon the floor was a bed spread out upon a tarpaulin.  Probably this  was where some one had slept.  The sight of huge dusty spurs, a gun  belt with sheath and gun, and a pair of leather chaps bristling with  broken cactus thorns recalled to Dick the cowboys, the ride, Mercedes,  and the whole strange adventure that had brought him there.    He did not recollect having removed his boots; indeed, upon second  thought, he knew he had not done so.  But there they stood upon the  floor.  Ladd and Lash must have taken them off when he was so exhausted  and sleepy that he could not tell what was happening. He felt a dead  weight of complete lassitude, and he did not want to move.  A sudden  pain in his hand caused him to hold it up.  It was black and blue,  swollen to almost twice its normal size, and stiff as a board.  The  knuckles were skinned and crusted with dry blood. Dick soliloquized  that it was the worst-looking hand he had seen since football days, and  that it would inconvenience him for some time.    A warm, dry, fragrant breeze came through the window.  Dick caught  again the sweet smell of flowers or fruit.  He heard the fluttering of  leaves, the murmur of running water, the twittering of birds, then the  sound of approaching footsteps and voices.  The door at the far end of  the room was open.  Through it he saw poles of peeled wood upholding a  porch roof, a bench, rose bushes in bloom, grass, and beyond these  bright-green foliage of trees.    \"He shore was sleepin' when I looked in an hour ago,\" said a voice that  Dick recognized as Ladd's.    \"Let him sleep,\" came the reply in deep, good-natured tones.  \"Mrs. B.  says the girl's never moved.  Must have been a tough ride for them  both.  Forty miles through cactus!\"    \"Young Gale hoofed darn near half the way,\" replied Ladd.  \"We tried to  make him ride one of our hosses.  If we had, we'd never got here.  A  walk like that'd killed me an' Jim.\"    \"Well, Laddy, I'm right down glad to see you boys, and I'll do all I  can for the young couple,\" said the other.  \"But I'm doing some worry  here; don't mistake me.\"    \"About your stock?\"    \"I've got only a few head of cattle at the oasis now, I'm worrying  some, mostly about my horses.  The U. S. is doing some worrying, too,  don't mistake me.  The rebels have worked west and north as far as  Casita.  There are no cavalrymen along the line beyond Casita, and  there can't be.  It's practically waterless desert.  But these rebels  are desert men.  They could cross the line beyond the Rio Forlorn and  smuggle arms into Mexico.  Of course, my job is to keep tab on Chinese  and Japs trying to get into the U.S. from Magdalena Bay.  But I'm  supposed to patrol the border line.  I'm going to hire some rangers.  Now, I'm not so afraid of being shot up, though out in this lonely  place there's danger of it; what I'm afraid of most is losing that  bunch of horses.  If any rebels come this far, or if they ever hear of  my horses, they're going to raid me.  You know what those guerrilla  Mexicans will do for horses. They're crazy on horse flesh.  They know  fine horses.  They breed the finest in the world.  So I don't sleep  nights any more.\"    \"Reckon me an' Jim might as well tie up with your for a spell, Beldin'.  We've been ridin' up an' down Arizona tryin' to keep out of sight of  wire fences.\"    \"Laddy, it's open enough around Forlorn River to satisfy even an  old-time cowpuncher like you,\" laughed Belding.  \"I'd take your staying  on as some favor, don't mistake me.  Perhaps I can persuade the young  man Gale to take a job with me.\"    \"That's shore likely.  He said he had no money, no friends.  An' if a  scrapper's all you're lookin' for he'll do,\" replied Ladd, with a dry  chuckle.    \"Mrs. B. will throw some broncho capers round this ranch when she hears  I'm going to hire a stranger.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Well, there's Nell-- And you said this Gale was a young American. My  wife will be scared to death for fear Nell will fall in love with him.\"    Laddy choked off a laugh, then evidently slapped his knee or Belding's,  for there was a resounding smack.    \"He's a fine-spoken, good-looking chap, you said?\" went on Belding.    \"Shore he is,\" said Laddy, warmly.  \"What do you say, Jim?\"    By this time Dick Gale's ears began to burn and he was trying to make  himself deaf when he wanted to hear every little word.    \"Husky young fellow, nice voice, steady, clear eyes, kinda proud, I  thought, an' some handsome, he was,\" replied Jim Lash.    \"Maybe I ought to think twice before taking a stranger into my family,\"  said Belding, seriously.  \"Well, I guess he's all right, Laddy, being  the cavalryman's friend.  No bum or lunger?  He must be all right?\"    \"Bum?  Lunger?  Say, didn't I tell you I shook hands with this boy an'  was plumb glad to meet him?\" demanded Laddy, with considerable heat.  Manifestly he had been affronted. \"Tom Beldin', he's a gentleman, an'  he could lick you in--in half a second.  How about that, Jim?\"    \"Less time,\" replied Lash.  \"Tom, here's my stand.  Young Gale can have  my hoss, my gun, anythin' of mine.\"    \"Aw, I didn't mean to insult you, boys, don't mistake me,\" said  Belding. \"Course he's all right.\"    The object of this conversation lay quiet upon his bed, thrilling and  amazed at being so championed by the cowboys, delighted with Belding's  idea of employing him, and much amused with the quaint seriousness of  the three.    \"How's the young man?\" called a woman's voice.  It was kind and mellow  and earnest.    Gale heard footsteps on flagstones.    \"He's asleep yet, wife,\" replied Belding.  \"Guess he was pretty much  knocked out.... I'll close the door there so we won't wake him.\"    There were slow, soft steps, then the door softly closed.  But the fact  scarcely made a perceptible difference in the sound of the voices  outside.    \"Laddy and Jim are going to stay,\" went on Belding.  \"It'll be like the  old Panhandle days a little.  I'm powerful glad to have the boys,  Nellie.  You know I meant to sent to Casita to ask them. We'll see some  trouble before the revolution is ended.  I think I'll make this young  man Gale an offer.\"    \"He isn't a cowboy?\" asked Mrs. Belding, quickly.    \"No.\"    \"Shore he'd make a darn good one,\" put in Laddy.    \"What is he?  Who is he?  Where did he come from?  Surely you must be--\"    \"Laddy swears he's all right,\" interrupted the husband.  \"That's enough  reference for me.  Isn't it enough for you?\"    \"Humph!  Laddy knows a lot about young men, now doesn't he, especially  strangers from the East?... Tom, you must be careful!\"    \"Wife, I'm only too glad to have a nervy young chap come along. What  sense is there in your objection, if Jim and Laddy stick up for him?\"    \"But, Tom--he'll fall in love with Nell!\" protested Mrs. Belding.    \"Well, wouldn't that be regular?  Doesn't every man who comes along  fall in love with Nell?  Hasn't it always happened?  When she was a  schoolgirl in Kansas didn't it happen?  Didn't she have a hundred  moon-eyed ninnies after her in Texas?  I've had some peace out here in  the desert, except when a Greaser or a prospector or a Yaqui would come  along.  Then same old story--in love with Nell!\"    \"But, Tom, Nell might fall in love with this young man!\" exclaimed the  wife, in distress.    \"Laddy, Jim, didn't I tell you?\" cried Belding.  \"I knew she'd say  that.... My dear wife, I would be simply overcome with joy if Nell did  fall in love once.  Real good and hard!  She's wilder than any antelope  out there on the desert.  Nell's nearly twenty now, and so far as we  know she's never cared a rap for any fellow.  And she's just as gay and  full of the devil as she was at fourteen. Nell's as good and lovable as  she is pretty, but I'm afraid she'll never grow into a woman while we  live out in this lonely land. And you've always hated towns where there  was a chance for the girl--just because you were afraid she'd fall in  love.  You've always been strange, even silly, about that.  I've done  my best for Nell--loved her as if she were my own daughter.  I've  changed many business plans to suit your whims.  There are rough times  ahead, maybe.  I need men.  I'll hire this chap Gale if he'll stay. Let  Nell take her chance with him, just as she'll have to take chances with  men when we get out of the desert.  She'll be all the better for it.\"    \"I hope Laddy's not mistaken in his opinion of this newcomer,\" replied  Mrs. Belding, with a sigh of resignation.    \"Shore I never made a mistake in my life figger'n' people,\" said Laddy,  stoutly.    \"Yes, you have, Laddy,\" replied Mrs. Belding.  \"You're wrong about  Tom....

The King handed her out of the chariot, and she approved everything  he had done, but as she had very great foresight, she thought when the  Princess should awake she might not know what to do with herself, being  all alone in this old palace; and this was what she did: she  touched with her wand everything in the palace (except the King  and Queen)--governesses, maids of honor, ladies of the bedchamber,  gentlemen, officers, stewards, cooks, undercooks, scullions, guards,  with their beefeaters, pages, footmen; she likewise touched all the  horses which were in the stables, pads as well as others, the great dogs  in the outward court and pretty little Mopsey too, the Princess's little  spaniel, which lay by her on the bed.    Immediately upon her touching them they all fell asleep, that they might  not awake before their mistress and that they might be ready to wait  upon her when she wanted them. The very spits at the fire, as full as  they could hold of partridges and pheasants, did fall asleep also. All  this was done in a moment. Fairies are not long in doing their business.    And now the King and the Queen, having kissed their dear child without  waking her, went out of the palace and put forth a proclamation that  nobody should dare to come near it.    This, however, was not necessary, for in a quarter of an hour's time  there grew up all round about the park such a vast number of trees,  great and small, bushes and brambles, twining one within another, that  neither man nor beast could pass through; so that nothing could be seen  but the very top of the towers of the palace; and that, too, not unless  it was a good way off. Nobody; doubted but the Fairy gave herein a very  extraordinary sample of her art, that the Princess, while she continued  sleeping, might have nothing to fear from any curious people.    When a hundred years were gone and passed the son of the King then  reigning, and who was of another family from that of the sleeping  Princess, being gone a-hunting on that side of the country, asked:    What those towers were which he saw in the middle of a great thick wood?    Everyone answered according as they had heard. Some said:    That it was a ruinous old castle, haunted by spirits.    Others, That all the sorcerers and witches of the country kept there  their sabbath or night's meeting.    The common opinion was: That an ogre lived there, and that he carried  thither all the little children he could catch, that he might eat them  up at his leisure, without anybody being able to follow him, as having  himself only the power to pass through the wood.    The Prince was at a stand, not knowing what to believe, when a very good  countryman spake to him thus:    \"May it please your royal highness, it is now about fifty years since I  heard from my father, who heard my grandfather say, that there was then  in this castle a princess, the most beautiful was ever seen; that she  must sleep there a hundred years, and should be waked by a king's son,  for whom she was reserved.\"    The young Prince was all on fire at these words, believing, without  weighing the matter, that he could put an end to this rare adventure;  and, pushed on by love and honor, resolved that moment to look into it.    Scarce had he advanced toward the wood when all the great trees, the  bushes, and brambles gave way of themselves to let him pass through; he  walked up to the castle which he saw at the end of a large avenue which  he went into; and what a little surprised him was that he saw none of  his people could follow him, because the trees closed again as soon as  he had passed through them. However, he did not cease from continuing  his way; a young and amorous prince is always valiant.    He came into a spacious outward court, where everything he saw might  have frozen the most fearless person with horror. There reigned all over  a most frightful silence; the image of death everywhere showed itself,  and there was nothing to be seen but stretched-out bodies of men and  animals, all seeming to be dead. He, however, very well knew, by the  ruby faces and pimpled noses of the beefeaters, that they were only  asleep; and their goblets, wherein still remained some drops of wine,  showed plainly that they fell asleep in their cups.    He then crossed a court paved with marble, went up the stairs and came  into the guard chamber, where guards were standing in their ranks, with  their muskets upon their shoulders, and snoring as loud as they could.  After that he went through several rooms full of gentlemen and ladies,  all asleep, some standing, others sitting. At last he came into a  chamber all gilded with gold, where he saw upon a bed, the curtains of  which were all open, the finest sight was ever beheld--a princess, who  appeared to be about fifteen or sixteen years of age, and whose bright  and, in a manner, resplendent beauty, had somewhat in it divine. He  approached with trembling and admiration, and fell down before her upon  his knees.    And now, as the enchantment was at an end, the Princess awaked, and  looking on him with eyes more tender than the first view might seem to  admit of:    \"Is it you, my Prince?\" said she to him. \"You have waited a long while.\"    The Prince, charmed with these words, and much more with the manner in  which they were spoken, knew not how to show his joy and gratitude;  he assured her that he loved her better than he did himself; their  discourse was not well connected, they did weep more than talk--little  eloquence, a great deal of love. He was more at a loss than she, and we  need not wonder at it; she had time to think on what to say to him; for  it is very probable (though history mentions nothing of it) that the  good Fairy, during so long a sleep, had given her very agreeable dreams.  In short, they talked four hours together, and yet they said not half  what they had to say.    In the meanwhile all the palace awaked; everyone thought upon their  particular business, and as all of them were not in love they were ready  to die for hunger. The chief lady of honor, being as sharp set as other  folks, grew very impatient, and told the Princess aloud that supper  was served up. The Prince helped the Princess to rise; she was entirely  dressed, and very magnificently, but his royal highness took care not  to tell her that she was dressed like his great-grandmother, and had  a point band peeping over a high collar; she looked not a bit less  charming and beautiful for all that.    They went into the great hall of looking-glasses, where they supped, and  were served by the Princess's officers, the violins and hautboys played  old tunes, but very excellent, though it was now above a hundred years  since they had played; and after supper, without losing any time, the  lord almoner married them in the chapel of the castle, and the chief  lady of honor drew the curtains. They had but very little sleep--the  Princess had no occasion; and the Prince left her next morning to return  to the city, where his father must needs have been in pain for him. The  Prince told him:    That he lost his way in the forest as he was hunting, and that he had  lain in the cottage of a charcoal-burner, who gave him cheese and brown  bread.    The King, his father, who was a good man, believed him; but his mother  could not be persuaded it was true; and seeing that he went almost every  day a-hunting, and that he always had some excuse ready for so doing,  though he had lain out three or four nights together, she began to  suspect that he was married, for he lived with the Princess above two  whole years, and had by her two children, the eldest of which, who was  a daughter, was named Morning, and the youngest, who was a son, they  called Day, because he was a great deal handsomer and more beautiful  than his sister.    The Queen spoke several times to her son, to inform herself after  what manner he did pass his time, and that in this he ought in duty to  satisfy her. But he never dared to trust her with his secret; he feared  her, though he loved her, for she was of the race of the Ogres, and the  King would never have married her had it not been for her vast riches;  it was even whispered about the Court that she had Ogreish inclinations,  and that, whenever she saw little children passing by, she had all the  difficulty in the world to avoid falling upon them. And so the Prince  would never tell her one word.    But when the King was dead, which happened about two years afterward,  and he saw himself lord and master, he openly declared his marriage; and  he went in great ceremony to conduct his Queen to the palace. They made  a magnificent entry into the capital city, she riding between her two  children.    Soon after the King went to make war with the Emperor Contalabutte, his  neighbor. He left the government of the kingdom to the Queen his mother,  and earnestly recommended to her care his wife and children. He was  obliged to continue his expedition all the summer, and as soon as he  departed the Queen-mother sent her daughter-in-law to a country house  among the woods, that she might with the more ease gratify her horrible  longing.    Some few days afterward she went thither herself, and said to her clerk  of the kitchen:    \"I have a mind to eat little Morning for my dinner to-morrow.\"    \"Ah! madam,\" cried the clerk of the kitchen.    \"I will have it so,\" replied the Queen (and this she spoke in the tone  of an Ogress who had a strong desire to eat fresh meat), \"and will eat  her with a sauce Robert.\"    The poor man, knowing very well that he must not play tricks with  Ogresses, took his great knife and went up into little Morning's  chamber. She was then four years old, and came up to him jumping and  laughing, to take him about the neck, and ask him for some sugar-candy.  Upon which he began to weep, the great knife fell out of his hand, and  he went into the back yard,"]]]
