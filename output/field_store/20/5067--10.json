Don't you know who I am?\"    \"No,\" said Jim, stupidly.    \"Well, I'm Time--Father Time! Now, make haste and set me free--if  you want the world to run properly.\"    \"How did I happen to catch you?\" asked Jim, without making a move to  release his captive.    \"I don't know. I've never been caught before,\" growled Father Time.  \"But I suppose it was because you were foolishly throwing your lasso  at nothing.\"    \"I didn't see you,\" said Jim.    \"Of course you didn't. I'm invisible to the eyes of human beings  unless they get within three feet of me, and I take care to keep  more than that distance away from them. That's why I was crossing  this field, where I supposed no one would be. And I should have been  perfectly safe had it not been for your beastly lasso. Now, then,\"  he added, crossly, \"are you going to get that rope off?\"    \"Why should I?\" asked Jim.    \"Because everything in the world stopped moving the moment you  caught me. I don't suppose you want to make an end of all business  and pleasure, and war and love, and misery and ambition and  everything else, do you? Not a watch has ticked since you tied me up  here like a mummy!\"    Jim laughed. It really was funny to see the old man wound round and  round with coils of rope from his knees up to his chin.    \"It'll do you good to rest,\" said the boy. \"From all I've heard you  lead a rather busy life.\"    \"Indeed I do,\" replied Father Time, with a sigh. \"I'm due in  Kamchatka this very minute. And to think one small boy is upsetting  all my regular habits!\"    \"Too bad!\" said Jim, with a grin. \"But since the world has stopped  anyhow, it won't matter if it takes a little longer recess. As soon  as I let you go Time will fly again. Where are your wings?\"    \"I haven't any,\" answered the old man. \"That is a story cooked up by  some one who never saw me. As a matter of fact, I move rather  slowly.\"    \"I see, you take your time,\" remarked the boy. \"What do you use that  scythe for?\"    \"To mow down the people,\" said the ancient one. \"Every time I swing  my scythe some one dies.\"    \"Then I ought to win a life-saving medal by keeping you tied up,\"  said Jim. \"Some folks will live this much longer.\"    \"But they won't know it,\" said Father Time, with a sad smile; \"so it  will do them no good. You may as well untie me at once.\"    \"No,\" said Jim, with a determined air. \"I may never capture you  again; so I'll hold you for awhile and see how the world wags  without you.\"    Then he swung the old man, bound as he was, upon the back of the  butcher's horse, and, getting into the saddle himself, started back  toward town, one hand holding his prisoner and the other guiding the  reins.    When he reached the road his eye fell on a strange tableau. A horse  and buggy stood in the middle of the road, the horse in the act of  trotting, with his head held high and two legs in the air, but  perfectly motionless. In the buggy a man and a woman were seated;  but had they been turned into stone they could not have been more  still and stiff.    \"There's no Time for them!\" sighed the old man. \"Won't you let me go  now?\"    \"Not yet,\" replied the boy.    He rode on until he reached the city, where all the people stood in  exactly the same positions they were in when Jim lassoed Father  Time. Stopping in front of a big dry goods store, the boy hitched  his horse and went in. The clerks were measuring out goods and  showing patterns to the rows of customers in front of them, but  everyone seemed suddenly to have become a statue.    There was something very unpleasant in this scene, and a cold shiver  began to run up and down Jim's back; so he hurried out again.    On the edge of the sidewalk sat a poor, crippled beggar, holding out  his hat, and beside him stood a prosperous-looking gentleman who was  about to drop a penny into the beggar's hat. Jim knew this gentleman  to be very rich but rather stingy, so he ventured to run his hand  into the man's pocket and take out his purse, in which was a $20  gold piece. This glittering coin he put in the gentleman's fingers  instead of the penny and then restored the purse to the rich man's  pocket.    \"That donation will surprise him when he comes to life,\" thought the  boy.    He mounted the horse again and rode up the street. As he passed the  shop of his friend, the butcher, he noticed several pieces of meat  hanging outside.    \"I'm afraid that meat'll spoil,\" he remarked.    \"It takes Time to spoil meat,\" answered the old man.    This struck Jim as being queer, but true.    \"It seems Time meddles with everything,\" said he.    \"Yes; you've made a prisoner of the most important personage in the  world,\" groaned the old man; \"and you haven't enough sense to let  him go again.\"    Jim did not reply, and soon they came to his uncle's house, where he  again dismounted. The street was filled with teams and people, but  all were motionless. His two little cousins were just coming out the  gate on their way to school, with their books and slates underneath  their arms; so Jim had to jump over the fence to avoid knocking them  down.    In the front room sat his aunt, reading her Bible. She was just  turning a page when Time stopped. In the dining-room was his uncle,  finishing his luncheon. His mouth was open and his fork poised just  before it, while his eyes were fixed upon the newspaper folded  beside him. Jim helped himself to his uncle's pie, and while he ate  it he walked out to his prisoner.    \"There's one thing I don't understand,\" said he.    \"What's that?\" asked Father Time.    \"Why is it that I'm able to move around while everyone else  is--is--froze up?\"    \"That is because I'm your prisoner,\" answered the other. \"You can do  anything you wish with Time now. But unless you are careful you'll  do something you will be sorry for.\"    Jim threw the crust of his pie at a bird that was suspended in the  air, where it had been flying when Time stopped.    \"Anyway,\" he laughed, \"I'm living longer than anyone else. No one  will ever be able to catch up with me again.\"    \"Each life has its allotted span,\" said the old man. \"When you have  lived your proper time my scythe will mow you down.\"    \"I forgot your scythe,\" said Jim, thoughtfully.    Then a spirit of mischief came into the boy's head, for he happened  to think that the present opportunity to have fun would never occur  again. He tied Father Time to his uncle's hitching post, that he  might not escape, and then crossed the road to the corner grocery.    The grocer had scolded Jim that very morning for stepping into a  basket of turnips by accident. So the boy went to the back end of  the grocery and turned on the faucet of the molasses barrel.    \"That'll make a nice mess when Time starts the molasses running all  over the floor,\" said Jim, with a laugh.    A little further down the street was a barber shop, and sitting in  the barber's chair Jim saw the man that all the boys declared was  the \"meanest man in town.\" He certainly did not like the boys and  the boys knew it. The barber was in the act of shampooing this  person when Time was captured. Jim ran to the drug store, and,  getting a bottle of mucilage, he returned and poured it over the  ruffled hair of the unpopular citizen.    \"That'll probably surprise him when he wakes up,\" thought Jim.    Near by was the schoolhouse. Jim entered it and found that only a  few of the pupils were assembled. But the teacher sat at his desk,  stern and frowning as usual.    Taking a piece of chalk, Jim marked upon the blackboard in big  letters the following words:    \"Every scholar is requested to yell the minute he enters the room.  He will also please throw his books at the teacher's head. Signed,  Prof. Sharpe.\"    \"That ought to raise a nice rumpus,\" murmured the mischiefmaker, as  he walked away.    On the corner stood Policeman Mulligan, talking with old Miss  Scrapple, the worst gossip in town, who always delighted in saying  something disagreeable about her neighbors. Jim thought this  opportunity was too good to lose. So he took off the policeman's cap  and brass-buttoned coat and put them on Miss Scrapple, while the  lady's feathered and ribboned hat he placed jauntily upon the  policeman's head.    The effect was so comical that the boy laughed aloud, and as a good  many people were standing near the corner Jim decided that Miss  Scrapple and Officer Mulligan would create a sensation when Time  started upon his travels.    Then the young cowboy remembered his prisoner, and, walking back to  the hitching post, he came within three feet of it and saw Father  Time still standing patiently within the toils of the lasso. He  looked angry and annoyed, however, and growled out:    \"Well, when do you intend to release me?\"    \"I've been thinking about that ugly scythe of yours,\" said Jim.    \"What about it?\" asked Father Time.    \"Perhaps if I let you go you'll swing it at me the first thing, to  be revenged,\" replied the boy.    Father Time gave him a severe look, but said:    \"I've known boys for thousands of years, and of course I know  they're mischievous and reckless. But I like boys, because they grow  up to be men and people my world. Now, if a man had caught me by  accident, as you did, I could have scared him into letting me go  instantly; but boys are harder to scare. I don't know as I blame  you. I was a boy myself, long ago, when the world was new. But  surely you've had enough fun with me by this time, and now I hope  you'll show the respect that is due to old age. Let me go, and in  return I will promise to forget all about my capture. The incident  won't do much harm, anyway, for no one will ever know that Time has  halted the last three hours or so.\"    \"All right,\" said Jim, cheerfully, \"since you've promised not to mow  me down, I'll let you go.\" But he had a notion some people in the  town would suspect Time had stopped when they returned to life.    He carefully "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4358"],[0,"The Sea Fairies (#12)"],[1,"in the middle, but gradually slanting down to the  water. No trees or bushes or grass grew anywhere about; only rocks,  gray and bleak, were to be seen.    Trot scarcely noticed this at first, however, for the island seemed  covered with groups of forms, some still and some moving, which the  old sailor promptly recognized as seals. Many were lying asleep or  sunning themselves; others crept awkwardly around, using their  strong fins as legs or \"paddles\" and caring little if they disturbed  the slumbers of the others. Once in a while one of those crowded out  of place would give a loud and angry bark, which awakened others and  set them to barking likewise.    Baby seals were there in great numbers, and were more active and  playful than their elders. It was really wonderful how they could  scramble around on the land, and Trot laughed more than once at  their antics.    At the edge of the water lay many huge turtles, some as big around  as a wagon wheel and others much smaller in size.    \"The big ones are very old,\" said the Queen, seeing Trot's eyes  fixed on the turtles.    \"How old?\" asked the child.    \"Hundreds of years, I think. They live to a great age, for nothing  can harm them when they withdraw their legs and heads into their  thick shells. We use some of the turtles for food, but prefer the  younger ones. Men also fish for turtles and eat them, but of course  no men ever come to this out-of-the-way place in the ocean, so the  inhabitants of this little island know they are perfectly safe.\"    In the center of the island rose high cliffs on top of which were to  be seen great flocks of seagulls, some whirling in the air, while  others were perched upon the points of rock.    \"What do the birds find to eat?\" asked Cap'n Bill.    \"They often feed upon seals which die of accident or old age, and  they are expert fishermen,\" explained Queen Aquareine. \"Curiously  enough, the seals also feed upon these birds, which they are often  able to catch in their strong jaws when the gulls venture too near.  And then, the seals frequently rob the nests of eggs, of which they  are very fond.\"    \"I'd like a few gulls' eggs now,\" remarked a big seal that lay near  them upon the shore. Trot had thought him sound asleep, but now he  opened his eyes to blink lazily at the group in the water.    \"Good morning,\" said the Queen. \"Aren't you Chief Muffruff?\"    \"I am,\" answered the old seal. \"And you are Aquareine, the mermaid  queen. You see, I remember you, although you haven't been here for  years. And isn't that Princess Clia? To be sure! But the other  mermaids are strangers to me, especially the bald-headed one.\"    \"I'm not a mermaid,\" asserted Cap'n Bill. \"I'm a sailor jes'  a-visitin' the mermaids.\"    \"Our friends are earth dwellers,\" explained the Queen.    \"That's odd,\" said Muffruff. \"I can't remember that any earth  dwellers ever came this way before. I never travel far, you see, for  I'm chief of this disorderly family of seals that live on this  island--on it and off it, that is.\"    \"You're a poor chief,\" said a big turtle lying beside the seal. \"If  your people are disorderly, it is your own fault.\"    Muffruff gave a chuckling laugh. Then, with a movement quick as  lightning, he pushed his head under the shell of the turtle and gave  it a sudden jerk. The huge turtle was tossed up on edge and then  turned flat upon its back, where its short legs struggled vainly to  right its overturned body.    \"There!\" snorted the Seal contemptuously. \"Perhaps you'll dare  insult me again in the presence of visitors, you old mud-wallower!\"    Seeing the plight of the turtle, several young seals came laughingly  wabbling to the spot, and as they approached the helpless creature  drew in his legs and head and closed his two shells tightly  together. The seals bumped against the turtle and gave it a push  that sent it sliding down the beach like a toboggan, and a minute  later it splashed into the water and sank out of sight. But that was  just what the creature wanted. On shore the upset turtle was quite  helpless; but the mischievous seals saved him. For as soon as he  touched the water, he was able to turn and right himself, which he  promptly did. Then he raised his head above the water and asked:    \"Is it peace or war, Muffruff?\"    \"Whichever you like,\" answered the Seal indifferently.    Perhaps the turtle was angry, for it ran on shore with remarkable  swiftness, uttering a shrill cry as it advanced. At once all the  other turtles awoke to life and with upraised heads joined their  comrade in the rush for the seals. Most of Chief Muffruff's band  scrambled hastily down the rocks and plunged into the water of the  sea without waiting for the turtles to reach them; but the chief  himself was slow in escaping. It may be that he was ashamed to run  while the mermaids were watching, but if this was so he made a great  mistake. The turtles snapped at his fins and tail and began biting  round chunks out of them so that Chief Muffruff screamed with pain  and anger and floundered into the water as fast as he could go. The  vengeful turtles were certainly the victors, and now held undisputed  possession of the island.    Trot laughed joyously at the incident, not feeling a bit sorry for  the old seal who had foolishly begun the battle. Even the gentle  queen smiled as she said:    \"These quarrels between the turtles and the seals are very frequent,  but they are soon ended. An hour from now they will all be lying  asleep together just as we found them; but we will not wait for  that. Let us go.\"    She sank slowly beneath the water again, and the others followed  after her.          CHAPTER 11    ZOG THE TERRIBLE AND HIS SEA DEVILS      \"The sun must be going under a cloud,\" said Trot, looking ahead.    They had descended far into the ocean depths again--further, the  girl thought, than they had ever been before.    \"No,\" the Queen answered after a glance ahead of them, \"that is a  cuttlefish, and he is dyeing the sea around him with ink so that he  can hide from us. Let us turn a little to the left, for we could see  nothing at all in that inky water.\"    Following her advice, they made a broad curve to the left, and at  once the water began to darken in that direction.    \"Why, there's another of 'em,\" said Cap'n Bill as the little party  came to a sudden halt.    \"So there is,\" returned the Queen, and Trot thought there was a  little quiver of anxiety in her voice. \"We must go far to the right  to escape the ink.\"    So they again started, this time almost at a right angle to their  former course, the little girl inquired:    \"How can the cuttlefish color the water so very black?\"    \"They carry big sacks in front of them where they conceal the ink,\"  Princess Clia answered. \"Whenever they choose, the cuttlefish are  able to press out this ink, and it colors the water for a great  space around them.\"    The direction in which they were now swimming was taking them far  out of their way. Aquareine did not wish to travel very far to the  right, so when she thought they had gone far enough to escape the  inky water, she turned to lead her party toward the left--the  direction in which she DID wish to go. At once another cloud of ink  stained the water and drove them to the right again.    \"Is anything wrong, ma'am?\" asked Cap'n Bill, seeing a frown gather  upon the queen's lovely face.    \"I hope not,\" she said. \"But I must warn you that these cuttlefish  are the servants of the terrible sea devils, and from the way they  are acting they seem determined to drive us toward the Devil Caves,  which I wished to avoid.\"    This admission on the part of their powerful protector, the fairy  mermaid, sent a chill to the hearts of the earth people. Neither  spoke for a time, but finally Cap'n Bill asked in a timid voice:    \"Hadn't we better go back, ma'am?\"    \"Yes,\" decided Aquareine after a moment's thought. \"I think it will  be wise to retreat. The sea devils are evidently aware of our  movements and wish to annoy us. For my part, I have no fear of them,  but I do not care to have you meet such creatures.\"    But when they turned around to abandon their journey, another inky  cloud was to be seen behind them. They really had no choice but to  swim in the only streak of clear water they could find, and the  mermaids well knew this would lead them nearer and nearer to the  caves of their enemies.    But Aquareine led the way, moving very slowly, and the others  followed her. In every other direction they were hemmed in by the  black waters, and they did not dare to halt, because the inky fluid  crept swiftly up behind them and drove them on.    The queen and the princess had now become silent and grave. They  swam on either side of their guests as if to better protect them.    \"Don't look up,\" whispered Clia, pressing close to the little girl's  side.    \"Why not?\" asked Trot, and then she did exactly what she had been  told not to do. She lifted her head and saw stretched over them a  network of scrawny, crimson arms interlaced like the branches of  trees in winter when the leaves have fallen and left them bare.    Cap'n Bill gave a start and muttered \"Land sakes!\" for he, too, had  gazed upward and seen the crimson network of limbs.    \"Are these the sea devils?\" asked the child, more curious than  frightened.    \"Yes, dear,\" replied the Queen. \"But I advise you to pay no  attention to them. Remember, they cannot touch us.\"    In order to avoid the threatening arms overhead, which followed them  as they swam, our friends kept near to the bottom of the sea, which  was here thickly covered with rough and jagged rocks. The inky water  had now been left far behind, but when Trot looked over her  shoulder, she shuddered to find a great crimson monster following  closely after them, with a dozen long, snaky feelers stretched out  as if to grab anyone that lagged behind. And there, at the side of  Princess Clia, was another"]]]
