The  odor is repulsive and, if concentrated, can cause nausea in some  individuals. To me, the scent is indistinguishable from that of the  copperhead.      \"Head Bobbing\"    \"Head bobbing\" in snakes has been described frequently in the  literature, and many interpretations have been advanced to explain its  occurrence. One of the earlier accounts was that of Corrington (1929:72)  describing behavior of the corn snake, _Elaphe guttata_. Characteristic  bobbing occurred when the snake was cornered, and seemingly the purpose  was to warn or frighten foes. Neill (1949:114-115) mentioned the jerking  or bobbing of the head in several species of snakes including the  cottonmouth, and remarked that \"it is apparently connected with  courtship and with the recognition of individuals.\" According to Munro  (1950:88), \"head bobbing\" appears to be a sign of annoyance in some  instances but is usually concerned with reproduction and individual  recognition. Richmond (1952:38) thought that many types of head  movements among not only reptiles but also birds and some mammals are a  result of poor vision and serve \"to delimit and orient an object that  for lack of motion is otherwise invisible.\" Head movements undoubtedly  occur in animals to facilitate accommodation, but it is obvious from  Richmond's conclusions that he has never observed \"head bobbing\" in  snakes. The term itself is grossly misleading and should be discarded.  Mansueti (1946:98) correctly described the movements as spastic  contractions of the body. I have observed numerous instances of these  movements in cottonmouths, copperheads, and rat snakes (_Elaphe  obsoleta_); and in no case has the movement resembled a head bob as is  described in lizards and other animals. The movement appears to be a  result of a nervous or sexually excited state and consists of highly  spastic contractions confined to the anterior part of the snake most of  the time but affecting the entire body on some occasions.    I found the response to be most common among cottonmouths in confinement  when food was introduced to a cage containing several individuals  (increasing the tendency to strike at a moving object) and when an  individual was placed back in the cage after being handled. At these  times the snakes that were inactive began to jerk for a few seconds.  When the snake is in this seemingly nervous state, the same response is  elicited by another snake crawling over it. At other times the movement  of one individual causes no such response. The jerking movements appear  to be released by the recognition of a nervous state in another  individual and may serve to protect the jerking individual from  aggressive advances of the former.    Where courtship is involved, the jerking motions are made in conjunction  with writhing of the male and do not result from the same type of  releaser described above.      Combat Dance    The so-called combat dance between male snakes has long been known, but  its significance is still poorly understood. It was for many years  believed to be courtship behavior until the participants were examined  and found to be males. Carr and Carr (1942:1-6) described one such  instance in two cottonmouths as courtship. In their observations, as  well as those of others, copulation was never observed following the  \"dance\" but was assumed to be the ultimate goal. After the discovery  that only males participated, it was suggested that combat involved  competition for mates, but the \"dance\" has been observed at times other  than the breeding season (Ramsey, 1948:228).    Shaw (1948:137-145) discussed the combat of crotalids in some detail but  drew no conclusions as to the cause of the behavior. Lowe (1948:134)  concluded with little actual evidence that combat among male snakes is  solely for territorial purposes. Shaw (1951:167) stated that combat may  occur as a possible defense against homosexuality. One case of  homosexual mating among cottonmouths was reported (Lederer,  1931:651-653), but the incomplete description seems to be of normal  courtship procedure except that the \"female\" tried to avoid the male.  Two instances of combat observed between timber rattlesnakes (_C. h.  horridus_) by Sutherland (1958:23-24) were definitely initiated because  of competition for food. More observations are needed before the  significance of the combat can be fully understood.          THE VENOM    Properties of the Venom      The venom and poison apparatus have developed primarily as a means of  causing rapid death in small animals that are the usual prey. As a  protective device against larger enemies, including man, the venom may  have some value; but this was probably unimportant in the evolution of  the poison mechanism. A secondary function of the venom is to begin  digestion of tissues of the prey. Since food is swallowed whole,  injection of digestive enzymes into the body cavity enhances digestion  of the prey.    Kellogg (1925:5) described venom as a somewhat viscid fluid of a  yellowish color and composed of 50 to 70 per cent proteins, the chief  remaining components being water and carbohydrates, with occasional  admixtures of abraded epithelial cells or saprophytic microorganisms.  Salts, such as chlorides, phosphates of calcium, magnesium, and  ammonium, occur in small quantities. Each of the components of snake  venom has a different effect on the body of the victim. It was at first  believed that there were two types of venoms: neurotoxic, which acts  upon nervous tissue; and haemotoxic, which acts on blood and other  tissues. It has since been found that venoms are composed of varying  mixtures of both types. Fairley (1929:301) described the constituents of  venom as: (1) neurotoxic elements that act on the bulbar and spinal  ganglion cells of the central nervous system; (2) hemorrhagins that  destroy the lining of the walls of blood vessels; (3) thrombose,  producing clots within blood vessels; (4) hemolysins, destroying red  blood corpuscles; (5) cytolysins that act on leucocytes and on cells of  other tissues; (6) elements that retard coagulation of the blood; (7)  antibactericidal substances; and (8) ferments that prepare food for  pancreatic digestion. Elapid snakes tend to have more of elements 1, 4,  and 6 in their venoms, while viperids and crotalids, of which the  cottonmouth is one, have higher quantities of elements 2, 3, and 5.  Kellogg (_loc. cit._) stated that venom of cottonmouths contains more  neurotoxin than that of rattlesnakes and not only breaks down the nuclei  of ganglion cells but also produces granular disintegration of the  myelin sheath and fragmentation of the conducting portions of nerve  fibers.    Thus, venoms contain both toxic elements and non-toxic substances that  promote rapid spreading of the venom through the body of the victim.  Jacques (1956:291) attributed this rapid spreading to the hyaluronidase  content of venoms.      Venom Yield and Toxicity    One of the most important yet undeterminable factors of the gravity of  snakebite is the amount of venom injected into the victim. Since this  volume varies considerably in every bite, attempts have been made to  determine the amount and toxicity of venom produced by each species of  poisonous snake. Individual yield is so variable that a large number of  snakes must be milked in order to determine the average yield. Even then  there remains an uncertainty as to how this amount may compare with that  injected by a biting snake.    Wolff and Githens (1939b:234) made 16 venom extractions from a group of  cottonmouths in a two-year period. The average yield per snake  fluctuated between 80 and 237 milligrams (actual weight), and toxicity  measured as the minimum lethal dose for pigeons varied from 0.05 to 0.16  milligrams (dry weight). No decrease in yield or toxicity was evident  during this period. Another group of cottonmouths from which venom was  extracted over a period of five years also showed no decrease in yield  or toxicity. Of 315 individual extractions the average amount obtained  from each individual was 0.55 cubic centimeters of liquid or 0.158 grams  of dried venom (28.0 per cent solids). The minimum lethal dosage (M. L.  D.) which was determined by injecting intravenously into 350-gram  pigeons was found to be 0.09 milligrams (dry weight). Each snake carried  approximately 1755 M. L. D.'s of venom.    The record venom extraction for the cottonmouth was 4.0 cubic  centimeters (1.094 grams dried venom) taken from a five-foot snake which  had been in captivity for 11 weeks and milked five weeks earlier (Wolff  and Githens, 1939a:52). The average yield of venom of cottonmouths is  about three times the average yield reported for copperheads by Fitch  (1960:256), a difference correlated with the greater bulk and relatively  large head of the cottonmouth.    Allen and Swindell (1948:13) stated that cottonmouth venom rates third  in potency, compared drop for drop to that of _Micrurus fulvius_ and  _Crotalus adamanteus_. Freshly dried cottonmouth venom tested on young  white rats showed the lethal dose to be from 23 to 29 milligrams per  kilogram of body weight. The venom of 11 one-week-old cottonmouths was  found to be more potent than that of adult males. Githens (1935:171)  rated _C. adamanteus_ venom as being weaker than that of the copperhead  (_A. contortrix_), which he rated only slightly lower than cottonmouth  venom. The crotalids which he ranked more toxic than cottonmouths are:  the Pacific rattlesnake (_C. viridis oreganus_) and the massasauga (_S.  catenatus_). He found _A. bilineatus_, _C. durissus_, and _C. v.  lutosus_ to have the same toxicity as cottonmouths. Minton (1953:214)  found that the intraperitoneal \"lethal dose 50\" (the dose capable of  killing half the experimental mice receiving injections of it) was 6.36  milligrams per kilogram for copperheads.

[Illustration: FIG. 31.--SKELETON OF THE SUPERIOR LIMB OF A BIRD  (VULTURE): LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE.    1, Humerus; 2, radius; 3, ulna; 4, radial bone of the carpus; 5, ulnar  bone of the carpus; 6, first metacarpal; 7, second metacarpal; 8, third  metacarpal; 9, first digit, the homologue of the thumb; 10, first  phalanx of the second digit; 11, second phalanx of the second digit; 12,  third digit.]    For the rest, in order to be able to distinguish readily the  corresponding parts in the hand of a bird and that of a man, we merely  have to place the human forearm obliquely, in a direction upwards and  forwards (Fig. 32), the radius being above; this position we can obtain  by semi-pronation; then, to incline strongly the hand downwards and  backwards, moving the ulnar border of the hand towards the ulna; the  thumb is then anterior, the little finger posterior, and the palm of the  hand is turned towards the trunk.    The carpus in birds is formed by two bones only, with which the skeleton  of the forearm articulates. That which is in contact with the radius is  called the _radial bone of the carpus_; and that with which the ulna  articulates is named the _ulnar bone_.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--SUPERIOR LIMB OF THE HUMAN BEING, THE DIFFERENT  SEGMENTS BEING PLACED IN THE ATTITUDE WHICH THE CORRESPONDING PARTS  OCCUPY IN BIRDS: LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE.]    The metacarpus is formed of three bones; the first, which is very short,  is fused at its superior extremity with the adjoining one; this latter  and the third, both longer than the first, but of unequal size, are  fused at their extremities. The metacarpal, which articulates with the  radial bone of the carpus, is larger than the one which is in line with  the ulna. To the metacarpus succeed three digits, of which the central  is the longest, and is formed of two phalanges; the other two are formed  each by a small, stylet-shaped bone. The middle finger, situated on the  prolongation of the metacarpal, which articulates with the radial bone  of the carpus, has its first phalanx large and flattened transversely;  this phalanx seems to have been formed by the union of two bones of  unequal development; the second phalanx is styloid in form. As to the  other two fingers, they are placed, one in front and the other behind;  the first, which articulates with the short metacarpal, fused at its  upper end with the principal bone of the metacarpus, in position  represents the thumb. The other, which is the third finger, articulates  with the inferior extremity of the thinnest bone of the metacarpus; it  is sometimes closely united to the corresponding border of the first  phalanx of the large--that is to say, of the median--digit.      The Anterior Limbs in Certain Animals    =Plantigrades=: =Bear= (Fig. 33).--The scapula of the bear approaches in  shape to a trapezium, of which the angles have been rounded off. The  anterior border (cervical) is strongly convex in the part next the  glenoid cavity. The junction of the superior (spinal) and the cervical  border forms almost a right angle, the summit of which corresponds to  the origin of the spine. At its posterior angle there is a prominence,  directed downwards, the surface of which is hollowed and is separated  from the infraspinous fossa by a crest, so that at this level a third  fossa is added to the infraspinous one. The neck of the scapula is but  slightly marked. The acromion is prominent, and projects a little beyond  the glenoid cavity.    The clavicle is rudimentary, but, as an example of the complete  development of this bone in plantigrade quadrupeds, we may cite the  marmoset.    The humerus is furnished at its superior extremity with a large  tuberosity, wide, and situated in front of the head of the bone; the  effect of this is that the bicipital groove is internal. As in man, the  great tuberosity does not reach so high as the humeral head, but it  approaches more nearly to that level. The deltoid impression is very  extensive, and descends pretty far down on the body of the bone. The  epitrochlea is prominent; the epicondyle is surmounted by a well-marked  crest, curved and flexuous in outline.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--SKELETON OF THE BEAR: LEFT LATERAL SURFACE.    1.

The surface which articulates with the ulna,  viewed on its anterior aspect, has the shape of a slightly-marked  trochlea; except at the level of the internal lip, which, as in man,  descends lower than the surface for articulation with the radius  (condyle). Behind, the trochlea is more clearly defined.    The bear possesses a considerable power of rotation of the radius; the  bones of the forearm are joined only at their extremities, while in the  remainder of their extent they are widely separated. The ulna terminates  below in a head and a styloid process; these articulate with the two  last bones of the first row of the carpus--viz., the cuneiform and  pisiform. The bones of the carpus are seven in number, the scaphoid and  the semilunar being fused together.    The metacarpals, five in number, differ very little from one another in  regard to length, though they increase in size from the first to the  fifth; this may be demonstrated by looking at the palmar surface of the  hand. It is the reverse of that which we find in man, for the fifth  metacarpal is the thickest of all, and the first is the most slender.    At the level of each metacarpo-phalangeal articulation are two sesamoid  bones.    The third digit is the longest. The terminal phalanges present two very  different portions: one, the anterior, is curved and pointed; it serves  to support the nail, whose shape it assumes; the other, posterior, forms  a sort of sheath into which the base of the nail is received.    The inferior portion of the posterior surface of this latter part  articulates with the second phalanx in the case of each of the last four  digits, but with the first phalanx in the case of the thumb.

The supraspinous and  infraspinous fossae are of equal extent (Figs. 35 and 36). The neck is  short. The spine of the scapula becomes more and more prominent towards  its inferior extremity, where it ends in a twisted and inflexed portion,  which represents the acromion process; this process terminates at the  level of the glenoid cavity. The coracoid process is represented by a  small tubercle, slightly curved inwards; this tubercle is situated  above the glenoid cavity, at the inferior part of the cervical border.    In the dog, the posterior angle, formed by the junction of the axillary  and the superior (spinal) borders, is obtuse; the spine rises  perpendicularly from the surface of the bone. The width of the scapula,  measured at the level of the spinal border (from A to A', Fig. 35),  equals about half the length of the spine. We must, however, make an  exception for the turnspit dog, in which the superior border equals  three-fourths of that length. The scapula is, in this case, of a more  compact type; it is broader, but"]]]
