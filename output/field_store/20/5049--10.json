But if you say: \"What if I cannot believe that my prayer is heard and  accepted?\" I answer: For this very reason faith, prayer and all other  good works are commanded, that you shall know what you can and what you  cannot do. And when you find that you cannot so believe and do, then  you are humbly to confess it to God, and so begin with a weak spark of  faith and daily strengthen it more and more by exercising it in all  your living and doing. For as touching infirmity of faith (that is, of  the First and highest Commandment), there is no one on earth who does  not have his good share of it. For even the holy Apostles in the  Gospel, and especially St. Peter, were weak in faith, so that they also  prayed Christ and said: \"Lord, increase our faith \"; and He very  frequently rebukes them because they have so little faith.    Therefore you shall not despair, nor give up, even if you find that you  do not believe as firmly as you ought and wish, in your prayer or in  other works. Nay, you shall thank God with all your heart that He thus  reveals to you your weakness, through which He daily teaches and  admonishes you how much you need to exercise yourself and daily  strengthen yourself in faith. For how many do you see who habitually  pray, sing, read, work and seem to be great saints, and yet never get  so far as to know where they stand in respect of the chief work, faith;  and so in their blindness they lead astray themselves and others; think  they are very well off, and so unknowingly build on the sand of their  works without any faith, not on God's mercy and promise through a firm,  pure faith.    Therefore, however long we live, we shall always have our hands full to  remain, with all our works and sufferings, pupils of the First  Commandment and of faith, and not to cease to learn. No one knows what  a great thing it is to trust God alone, except he who attempts it with  his works.    VII. Again: if no other work were commanded, would not prayer alone  suffice to exercise the whole life of man in faith? For this work the  spiritual estate has been specially established, as indeed in olden  times some Fathers prayed day and night. Nay, there is no Christian who  does not have time to pray without ceasing. But I mean the spiritual  praying, that is: no one is so heavily burdened with his labor, but  that if he will he can, while working, speak with God in his heart, lay  before Him his need and that of other men, ask for help, make petition,  and in all this exercise and strengthen his faith.    This is what the Lord means, Luke xviii, when He says, \"Men ought  always to pray, and never cease,\" although in Matthew vi. He forbids  the use of much speaking and long prayers, because of which He rebukes  the hypocrites; not because the lengthy prayer of the lips is evil, but  because it is not that true prayer which can be made at all times, and  without the inner prayer of faith is nothing. For we must also practise  the outward prayer in its proper time, especially in the mass, as this  Commandment requires, and wherever it is helpful to the inner prayer  and faith, whether in the house or in the field, in this work or in  that; of which we have no time now to speak more. For this belongs to  the Lord's Prayer, in which all petitions and spoken prayer are summed  up in brief words.    VIII. Where now are they who desire to know and to do good works?  Let  them undertake prayer alone, and rightly exercise themselves in faith,  and they will find that it is true, as the holy Fathers have said, that  there is no work like prayer. Mumbling with the mouth is easy, or at  least considered easy, but with earnestness of heart to follow the  words in deep devotion, that is, with desire and faith, so that one  earnestly desires what the words say, and not to doubt that it will be  heard: that is a great deed in God's eyes.    Here the evil spirit hinders men with all his powers. Oh, how often  will he here prevent the desire to pray, not allow us to find time and  place, nay, often also raise doubts, whether a man is worthy to ask  anything of such a Majesty as God is, and so confuse us that a man  himself does not know whether it is really true that he prays or not;  whether it is possible that his prayer is acceptable, and other such  strange thoughts. For the evil spirit knows well how powerful one man's  truly believing prayer is, and how it hurts him, and how it benefits  all men. Therefore he does not willingly let it happen.    When so tempted, a man must indeed be wise, and not doubt that he and  his prayer are, indeed, unworthy before such infinite Majesty; in no  wise dare he trust his worthiness, or because of his unworthiness grow  faint; but he must heed God's command and cast this up to Him, and hold  it before the devil, and say: \"Because of my worthiness I do nothing,  because of my unworthiness I cease from nothing. I pray and work only  because God of His pure mercy has promised to hear and to be gracious  to all unworthy men, and not only promised it, but He has also most  sternly, on pain of His everlasting displeasure and wrath, commanded us  to pray, to trust and to receive. If it has not been too much for that  high Majesty so solemnly and highly to obligate His unworthy worms to  pray, to trust, and to receive from Him, how shall it be too much for  me to take such command upon myself with all joy, however worthy or  unworthy I may be?\" Thus we must drive out the devil's suggestion with  God's command. Thus will he cease, and in no other way whatever.    IX. But what are the things which we must bring before Almighty God in  prayer and lamentation, to exercise faith thereby? Answer: First, every  man's own besetting need and trouble, of which David says, Psalm xxxii:  \"Thou art my refuge in all trouble which compasseth me about; Thou art  my comfort, to preserve me from all evil which surrounds me.\" Likewise,  Psalm cxlii: \"I cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto  the Lord did I make my supplication. I poured out my complaint before  Him; I showed before Him my trouble.\" In the mass a Christian shall  keep in mind the short-comings or excesses he feels, and pour out all  these freely before God with weeping and groaning, as woefully as he  can, as to his faithful Father, who is ready to help him.  And if you  do not know or recognise your need, or have no trouble, then you shall  know that you are in the worst possible plight. For this is the  greatest trouble, that you find yourself so hardened, hard-hearted and  insensible that no trouble moves you.    There is no better mirror in which to see your need than simply the Ten  Commandments, in which you will find what you lack and what you should  seek. If, therefore, you find in yourself a weak faith, small hope and  little love toward God; and that you do not praise and honor God, but  love your own honor and fame, think much of the favor of men, do not  gladly hear mass and sermon, are indolent in prayer, in which things  every one has faults, then you shall think more of these faults than of  all bodily harm to goods, honor and life, and believe that they are  worse than death and all mortal sickness. These you shall earnestly lay  before God, lament and ask for help, and with all confidence expect  help, and believe that you are heard and shall obtain help and mercy.    Then go forward into the Second Table of the Commandments, and see how  disobedient you have been and still are toward father and mother and  all in authority; how you sin against your neighbor with anger, hatred  and evil words; how you are tempted to unchastity, covetousness and  injustice in word and deed against your neighbor; and you will  doubtless find that you are full of all need and misery, and have  reason enough to weep even drops of blood, if you could.    X. But I know well that many are so foolish as not to want to ask for  such things, unless they first be conscious that they are pure, and  believe that God hears no one who is a sinner. All this is the work of  those false preachers, who teach men to begin, not with faith and trust  in God's favor, but with their own works.    Look you, wretched man! if you have broken a leg, or the peril of death  overtakes you, you call upon God, this Saint and that, and do not wait  until your leg is healed, or the danger is past: you are not so foolish  as to think that God hears no one whose leg is broken, or who is in  bodily danger. Nay, you believe that God shall hear most of all when  you are in the greatest need and fear. Why, then, are you so foolish  here, where there is immeasurably greater need and eternal hurt, and do  not want to ask for faith, hope, love, humility, obedience, chastity,  gentleness, peace, righteousness, unless you are already free of all  your unbelief, doubt, pride, disobedience, unchastity, anger,  covetousness and unrighteousness. Although the more you find yourself  lacking in these things, the more and more diligently you ought to pray  or cry.    So blind are we: with our bodily sickness and need we run to God; with  the soul's sickness we run from Him, and are unwilling to come back  before we are well, exactly as if there could be one God who could help  the body, and another God who could help the soul; or as if we would  help ourselves in spiritual need, although it really is greater than  the bodily need. Such plan and counsel is of the devil.    Not so, my good man! If you wish to be cured of sin, you must not  withdraw from God, but run to Him, and pray with much more confidence  than if a bodily need had overtaken you. God is not hostile to sinners,  but only to unbelievers, that is, to such as do not recognize and  lament their sin, nor seek help against it from God, but in their own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#12)"],[1,"victims of his transformations  were doing.    They were all on top of the flat rock, talking together in tones so low  that Kiki could not hear what they said.    \"This is certainly a misfortune,\" remarked the Wizard in the Fox's  form, \"but our transformations are a sort of enchantment which is very  easy to break--when you know how and have the tools to do it with.  The  tools are in my Black Bag; but where is the Bag?\"    No one knew that, for none had seen Kiki Aru fly away with it.    \"Let's look and see if we can find it,\" suggested Dorothy the Lamb.    So they left the rock, and all of them searched the clearing high and  low without finding the Bag of Magic Tools.  The Goose searched as  earnestly as the others, for if he could discover it, he meant to hide  it where the Wizard could never find it, because if the Wizard changed  him back to his proper form, along with the others, he would then be  recognized as Ruggedo the Nome, and they would send him out of the Land  of Oz and so ruin all his hopes of conquest.    Ruggedo was not really sorry, now that he thought about it, that Kiki  had transformed all these Oz folks.  The forest beasts, it was true,  had been so frightened that they would now never consent to be  transformed into men, but Kiki could transform them against their will,  and once they were all in human forms, it would not be impossible to  induce them to conquer the Oz people.    So all was not lost, thought the old Nome, and the best thing for him  to do was to rejoin the Hyup boy who had the secret of the  transformations.  So, having made sure the Wizard's black bag was not  in the clearing, the Goose wandered away through the trees when the  others were not looking, and when out of their hearing, he began  calling, \"Kiki Aru!  Kiki Aru!  Quack--quack!  Kiki Aru!\"    The Boy and the Woman, the Fox, the Lamb, and the Rabbit, not being  able to find the bag, went back to the rock, all feeling exceedingly  strange.    \"Where's the Goose?\" asked the Wizard.    \"He must have run away,\" replied Dorothy.  \"I wonder who he was?\"    \"I think,\" said Gugu the King, who was the fat Woman, \"that the Goose  was the stranger who proposed that we make war upon the Oz people.  If  so, his transformation was merely a trick to deceive us, and he has now  gone to join his comrade, that wicked Li-Mon-Eag who obeyed all his  commands.\"    \"What shall we do now?\" asked Dorothy.  \"Shall we go back to the  Emerald City, as we are, and then visit Glinda the Good and ask her to  break the enchantments?\"    \"I think so,\" replied the Wizard Fox.  \"And we can take Gugu the King  with us, and have Glinda restore him to his natural shape.  But I hate  to leave my Bag of Magic Tools behind me, for without it I shall lose  much of my power as a Wizard.  Also, if I go back to the Emerald City  in the shape of a Fox, the Oz people will think I'm a poor Wizard and  will lose their respect for me.\"    \"Let us make still another search for your tools,\" suggested the  Cowardly Lion, \"and then, if we fail to find the Black Bag anywhere in  this forest, we must go back home as we are.\"    \"Why did you come here, anyway?\" inquired Gugu.    \"We wanted to borrow a dozen monkeys, to use on Ozma's birthday,\"  explained the Wizard.  \"We were going to make them small, and train  them to do tricks, and put them inside Ozma's birthday cake.\"    \"Well,\" said the Forest King, \"you would have to get the consent of  Rango the Gray Ape, to do that.  He commands all the tribes of monkeys.\"    \"I'm afraid it's too late, now,\" said Dorothy, regretfully.  \"It was a  splendid plan, but we've got troubles of our own, and I don't like  being a lamb at all.\"    \"You're nice and fuzzy,\" said the Cowardly Lion.    \"That's nothing,\" declared Dorothy.  \"I've never been 'specially proud  of myself, but I'd rather be the way I was born than anything else in  the whole world.\"      The Glass Cat, although it had some disagreeable ways and manners,  nevertheless realized that Trot and Cap'n Bill were its friends and so  was quite disturbed at the fix it had gotten them into by leading them  to the Isle of the Magic Flower.  The ruby heart of the Glass Cat was  cold and hard, but still it was a heart, and to have a heart of any  sort is to have some consideration for others.  But the queer  transparent creature didn't want Trot and Cap'n Bill to know it was  sorry for them, and therefore it moved very slowly until it had crossed  the river and was out of sight among the trees of the forest.  Then it  headed straight toward the Emerald City, and trotted so fast that it  was like a crystal streak crossing the valleys and plains.  Being  glass, the cat was tireless, and with no reason to delay its journey,  it reached Ozma's palace in wonderfully quick time.    \"Where's the Wizard?\" it asked the Pink Kitten, which was curled up in  the sunshine on the lowest step of the palace entrance.    \"Don't bother me,\" lazily answered the Pink Kitten, whose name was  Eureka.    \"I must find the Wizard at once!\" said the Glass Cat.    \"Then find him,\" advised Eureka, and went to sleep again.    The Glass Cat darted up the stairway and came upon Toto, Dorothy's  little black dog.    \"Where's the Wizard?\" asked the Cat.    \"Gone on a journey with Dorothy,\" replied Toto.    \"When did they go, and where have they gone?\" demanded the Cat.    \"They went yesterday, and I heard them say they would go to the Great  Forest in the Munchkin Country.\"    \"Dear me,\" said the Glass Cat; \"that is a long journey.\"    \"But they rode on the Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly Lion,\" explained  Toto, \"and the Wizard carried his Black Bag of Magic Tools.\"    The Glass Cat knew the Great Forest of Gugu well, for it had traveled  through this forest many times in its journeys through the Land of Oz.  And it reflected that the Forest of Gugu was nearer to the Isle of the  Magic Flower than the Emerald City was, and so, if it could manage to  find the Wizard, it could lead him across the Gillikin Country to where  Trot and Cap'n Bill were prisoned.  It was a wild country and little  traveled, but the Glass Cat knew every path.  So very little time need  be lost, after all.    Without stopping to ask any more questions the Cat darted out of the  palace and away from the Emerald City, taking the most direct route to  the Forest of Gugu.  Again the creature flashed through the country  like a streak of light, and it would surprise you to know how quickly  it reached the edge of the Great Forest.    There were no monkey guards among the trees to cry out a warning, and  this was so unusual that it astonished the Glass Cat.  Going farther  into the forest it presently came upon a wolf, which at first bounded  away in terror.  But then, seeing it was only a Glass Cat, the Wolf  stopped, and the Cat could see it was trembling, as if from a terrible  fright.    \"What's the matter?\" asked the Cat.    \"A dreadful Magician has come among us!\" exclaimed the Wolf, \"and he's  changing the forms of all the beasts--quick as a wink--and making them  all his slaves.\"    The Glass Cat smiled and said:    \"Why, that's only the Wizard of Oz.  He may be having some fun with you  forest people, but the Wizard wouldn't hurt a beast for anything.\"    \"I don't mean the Wizard,\" explained the Wolf.  \"And if the Wizard of  Oz is that funny little man who rode a great Tiger into the clearing,  he's been transformed himself by the terrible Magician.\"    \"The Wizard transformed?  Why, that's impossible,\" declared the Glass  Cat.    \"No; it isn't.  I saw him with my own eyes, changed into the form of a  Fox, and the girl who was with him was changed to a woolly Lamb.\"    The Glass Cat was indeed surprised.    \"When did that happen?\" it asked.    \"Just a little while ago in the clearing.  All the animals had met  there, but they ran away when the Magician began his transformations,  and I'm thankful I escaped with my natural shape.  But I'm still  afraid, and I'm going somewhere to hide.\"    With this the Wolf ran on, and the Glass Cat, which knew where the big  clearing was, went toward it.  But now it walked more slowly, and its  pink brains rolled and tumbled around at a great rate because it was  thinking over the amazing news the Wolf had told it.    When the Glass Cat reached the clearing, it saw a Fox, a Lamb, a  Rabbit, a Munchkin boy and a fat Gillikin woman, all wandering around  in an aimless sort of way, for they were again searching for the Black  Bag of Magic Tools.    The Cat watched them a moment and then it walked slowly into the open  space.  At once the Lamb ran toward it, crying:    \"Oh, Wizard, here's the Glass Cat!\"    \"Where, Dorothy?\" asked the Fox.    \"Here!\"    The Boy and the Woman and the Rabbit now joined the Fox and the Lamb,  and they all stood before the Glass Cat and speaking together, almost  like a chorus, asked: \"Have you seen the Black Bag?\"    \"Often,\" replied the Glass Cat, \"but not lately.\"    \"It's lost,\" said the Fox, \"and we must find it.\"    \"Are you the Wizard?\" asked the Cat.    \"Yes.\"    \"And who are these others?\"    \"I'm Dorothy,\" said the Lamb.    \"I'm the Cowardly Lion,\" said the Munchkin boy.    \"I'm the Hungry Tiger,\" said the Rabbit.    \"I'm Gugu, King of the Forest,\" said the fat Woman.    The Glass Cat sat on its hind legs and began to laugh.  \"My, what a  funny lot!\" exclaimed the Creature.  \"Who played this joke on you?\"    \"It's no joke at all,\" declared the Wizard.  \"It was a cruel, wicked  transformation, and the Magician that did it has the head of a lion,  the body of a monkey, the wings of an eagle and a round ball on the end  of his tail.\"    The Glass Cat laughed again.  \"That Magician must look funnier than you  do,\" it said.  \"Where is he now?\"    \"Somewhere in the forest,\" said the Cowardly Lion.  \"He just jumped  into that tall maple tree over there, for he can climb like a monkey  and fly like an eagle, and then he disappeared in the forest.\"    \"And there "]]]
