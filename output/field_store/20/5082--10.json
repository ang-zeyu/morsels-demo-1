Meyers, General History, page 334.        CHAPTER III    NEED OF TEMPLES IN THE PRESENT DISPENSATION    {63} Among the numerous sects and churches professing Christianity,  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands alone in the  teaching and practise of temple ministration. The devotion of this  people to the sacred labor of building temples and administering  therein the saving ordinances of the Gospel has attracted the attention  and aroused the wonder of both philosopher and layman. It is not  enough to attempt an explanation of this singular and stupendous  sacrifice by ascribing it to assumed and unproved fanaticism; the  earnest investigator, the careful observer, and even the cursory  reader, indeed, if he be honest, admits that beneath this devotion is  a deeply-seated and an abiding faith. It cannot be affirmed that the  Latter-day Saints build temples as monuments of communal wealth nor  in the pride of human aggrandisement; for we find them thus arduously  engaged even while bread was scarce and clothing scant among them; and  throughout their history the people have looked upon their temples  as edifices belonging to the Lord, and upon themselves as stewards  entrusted with the custody of the consecrated properties. Nor can it  be said that this Church builds temples as other sects erect chapels,  churches, cathedrals, and synagogues; for the Church has the equivalent  of these, and indeed the meeting-houses and places of public worship  maintained by the Latterday Saints are proportionately greater in  number than {64} are those of other denominations. Moreover, as already  stated, these temples are not used as places of common assembly, nor as  houses of general and congregational service.    Why, then, does The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints build  and maintain temples? In answer let the following pertinent facts be  carefully considered.    NECESSITY OF OBEDIENCE TO THE LAWS AND ORDINANCES OF THE GOSPEL    As part of its declaration of faith, the Church proclaims:    \"_We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be  saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel_.\"[1]    While professing belief in the possibility of a universal salvation,  the Church affirms that salvation is assured only on condition of  individual compliance with the requirements established by the  Redeemer, without whose atoning sacrifice none could be saved. The  atonement wrought by the Christ on Calvary was a vicarious offering, in  the beneficent results of which all mankind are made partakers. As to  redemption from the thrall of mortality incident to the transgression  in Eden, the sacrificial death of Christ met in full the exactions  incident to the broken law; and none but Adam shall be held accountable  for Adam's disobedience, nor for any results thereof. In the just  judgment to which every mortal shall come, all conditions of inherited  weakness, temptation due to {65} environment, the capacity to choose  and to act, the measure of knowledge to which the subject has attained,  the meed of truth he has accepted or rejected, the opportunities he has  used aright or wrongly spurned, the fidelity with which he walked in  the light or the depravity through which he wandered in the forbidden  paths of darkness,--these and every other fact and circumstance  entering into the individual life will be duly weighed and considered.  At the bar of God the distinguishing feature of Divine mercy will  be, as in the affairs of mortal life it now is, not an arbitrary  forgiveness of sin nor unearned annulment of the debts of guilt, but  the providing of a way whereby the sinner may be enabled to meet the  requirements of the Gospel, and so in due course pass from the prison  house of sin to the glorious freedom of a righteous life.    There is but one price set on forgiveness for individual transgression,  and this is alike to all,--to poor and rich, to bond and free, to  illiterate and learned; it knows no fluctuations, it changes not with  time; it was the same yesterday as today it is, and even so shall be  forever,--and that price, at which may be bought the pearl beyond all  price, is _obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel_.    Hear this further declaration of faith taught by the restored Church:    \"_We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel  are:--(1) Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; (2) Repentance; (3) Baptism  by immersion for the remission of sins; (4) Laying-on of hands for the  Gift of the Holy Ghost_.\"[2]    {66} _Faith_ in the Lord Jesus Christ is the fundamental principle of  the Gospel, the first letter in the alphabet of salvation with which  are spelled the words of life eternal. Yet who can have faith in aught  of which he knows nothing? Knowledge is essential to faith, and faith  impels its possessor to seek further knowledge, and to make of that  knowledge, wisdom, which is but knowledge applied and put to use. To  preach Christ and Him crucified[3] is the one and only way by which  faith in Him may be taught through the medium of either precept or  example. While knowledge and faith are thus closely associated, the two  are not identical, nor is the one an assured outgrowth of the other. A  man may have learned the truth, and yet may ignore it. His knowledge,  far from developing within his soul the faith that leads to right  action, may but add to his condemnation, for he sins without even the  mitigation of ignorance. Evil spirits have testified of their knowledge  that Jesus is the Christ, nevertheless they remain the fallen followers  of Satan.[4] As living faith develops within the soul of man it leads  its possessor to seek a means whereby he may rise from the thraldom  of sin; and the very thought of such emancipation inspires a loathing  for the evil contamination of the past. The natural fruitage of that  glorious growth is repentance.    _Repentance_, as a requirement made of all men, constitutes the second  principle of the Gospel of Christ. It comprises a sincere sorrow for  the sins of the past, and a resolute turning away therefrom with  the solemn determination to endeavor by Divine assistance to return  thereto no more. Repentance comes as a gift from God {67} to him who  has treasured and nurtured the earlier gift of faith. It is not to be  had for the careless asking; it may not be found upon the highway; it  is not of earth, but a treasure of heaven, and is given with care, yet  with boundless liberality unto those who have brought forth works that  warrant its bestowal. That is to say, all who prepare themselves for  repentance will, by the humbling and softening influence of the Holy  Spirit, be brought to the actual possession of this great gift. When  Peter was charged by his fellow-worshippers with a breach of law in  that he had associated with Gentiles, he told his hearers of the Divine  manifestations he had so recently received; they believed and declared  \"Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.\" Paul  also, in writing to the Romans, teaches that repentance comes through  the goodness of God.[5]    Wilful persistency in sin may lead to the loss and forfeiture of the  ability to repent; and for man to procrastinate the day of repentance  is to invite and eventually to insure such forfeiture. The Divine word  through the mouth of a modern prophet is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4524"],[0,"Familiar Letters on Chemistry, and Its Relation to Commerce, Physiology, and (#12)"],[1,"same deep purple  colour, and even in their physical characters, animal fibrine and  albumen are in no respect different from vegetable fibrine and  albumen. It is especially to be noticed, that by the phrase,  identity of composition, we do not here intend mere similarity, but  that even in regard to the presence and relative amount of sulphur,  phosphorus, and phosphate of lime, no difference can be observed.    How beautifully and admirably simple, with the aid of these  discoveries, appears the process of nutrition in animals, the  formation of their organs, in which vitality chiefly resides! Those  vegetable principles, which in animals are used to form blood,  contain the chief constituents of blood, fibrine and albumen, ready  formed, as far as regards their composition. All plants, besides,  contain a certain quantity of iron, which reappears in the colouring  matter of the blood. Vegetable fibrine and animal fibrine, vegetable  albumen and animal albumen, hardly differ, even in form; if these  principles be wanting in the food, the nutrition of the animal is  arrested; and when they are present, the graminivorous animal  obtains in its food the very same principles on the presence of  which the nutrition of the carnivora entirely depends.    Vegetables produce in their organism the blood of all animals, for  the carnivora, in consuming the blood and flesh of the graminivora,  consume, strictly speaking, only the vegetable principles which have  served for the nutrition of the latter. Vegetable fibrine and  albumen take the form in the stomach of the graminivorous animal as  animal fibrine and albumen do in that of the carnivorous animal.    From what has been said, it follows that the development of the  animal organism and its growth are dependent on the reception of  certain principles identical with the chief constituents of blood.    In this sense we may say that the animal organism gives to the blood  only its form; that it is incapable of creating blood out of other  substances which do not already contain the chief constituents of  that fluid. We cannot, indeed, maintain that the animal organism has  no power to form other compounds, for we know that it is capable of  producing an extensive series of compounds, differing in composition  from the chief constituents of blood; but these last, which form the  starting-point of the series, it cannot produce.    The animal organism is a higher kind of vegetable, the development  of which begins with those substances with the production of which  the life of an ordinary vegetable ends. As soon as the latter has  borne seed, it dies, or a period of its life comes to a termination.    In that endless series of compounds, which begins with carbonic  acid, ammonia, and water, the sources of the nutrition of  vegetables, and includes the most complex constituents of the animal  brain, there is no blank, no interruption. The first substance  capable of affording nutriment to animals is the last product of the  creative energy of vegetables.    The substance of cellular tissue and of membranes, of the brain and  nerves, these the vegetable cannot produce.    The seemingly miraculous in the productive agency of vegetables  disappears in a great degree, when we reflect that the production of  the constituents of blood cannot appear more surprising than the  occurrence of the fat of beef and mutton in cocoa beans, of human  fat in olive-oil, of the principal ingredient of butter in palm-oil,  and of horse fat and train-oil in certain oily seeds.          LETTER IX      My dear Sir,    The facts detailed in my last letter will satisfy you as to the  manner in which the increase of mass in an animal, that is, its  growth, is accomplished; we have still to consider a most important  question, namely, the function performed in the animal system by  substances destitute of nitrogen; such as sugar, starch, gum,  pectine, &c.    The most extensive class of animals, the graminivora, cannot live  without these substances; their food must contain a certain amount  of one or more of them, and if these compounds are not supplied,  death quickly ensues.    This important inquiry extends also to the constituents of the food  of carnivorous animals in the earliest periods of life; for this  food also contains substances, which are not necessary for their  support in the adult state. The nutrition of the young of carnivora  is obviously accomplished by means similar to those by which the  graminivora are nourished; their development is dependent on the  supply of a fluid, which the body of the mother secretes in the  shape of milk.    Milk contains only one nitrogenised constituent, known under the  name of caseine; besides this, its chief ingredients are butter  (fat), and sugar of milk. The blood of the young animal, its  muscular fibre, cellular tissue, nervous matter, and bones, must  have derived their origin from the nitrogenised constituent of  milk--the caseine; for butter and sugar of milk contain no nitrogen.    Now, the analysis of caseine has led to the result, which, after the  details I have given, can hardly excite your surprise, that this  substance also is identical in composition with the chief  constituents of blood, fibrine and albumen. Nay more--a comparison  of its properties with those of vegetable caseine has shown--that  these two substances are identical in all their properties;  insomuch, that certain plants, such as peas, beans, and lentils, are  capable of producing the same substance which is formed from the  blood of the mother, and employed in yielding the blood of the young  animal.    The young animal, therefore, receives in the form of caseine,--which  is distinguished from fibrine and albumen by its great solubility,  and by not coagulating when heated,--the chief constituent of the  mother's blood. To convert caseine into blood no foreign substance  is required, and in the conversion of the mother's blood into  caseine, no elements of the constituents of the blood have been  separated. When chemically examined, caseine is found to contain a  much larger proportion of the earth of bones than blood does, and  that in a very soluble form, capable of reaching every part of the  body. Thus, even in the earliest period of its life, the development  of the organs, in which vitality resides, is, in the carnivorous  animal, dependent on the supply of a substance, identical in organic  composition with the chief constituents of its blood.    What, then, is the use of the butter and the sugar of milk? How does  it happen that these substances are indispensable to life?    Butter and sugar of milk contain no fixed bases, no soda nor potash.  Sugar of milk has a composition closely allied to that of the other  kinds of sugar, of starch, and of gum; all of them contain carbon  and the elements of water, the latter precisely in the proportion to  form water.    There is added, therefore, by means of these compounds, to the  nitrogenised constituents of food, a certain amount of carbon; or,  as in the case of butter, of carbon and hydrogen; that is, an excess  of elements, which cannot possibly be employed in the production of  blood, because the nitrogenised substances contained in the food  already contain exactly the amount of carbon which is required for  the production of fibrine and albumen.    In an adult carnivorous animal, which neither gains nor loses  weight, perceptibly, from day to day, its nourishment, the waste of  organised tissue, and its consumption of oxygen, stand to each other  in a well-defined and fixed relation.    The carbon of the carbonic acid given off, with that of the urine;  the nitrogen of the urine, and the hydrogen given off as ammonia and  water; these elements, taken together, must be exactly equal in  weight to the carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen of the metamorphosed  tissues, and since these last are exactly replaced by the food, to  the carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen of the food. Were this not the  case, the weight of the animal could not possibly remain unchanged.    But, in the young of the carnivora, the weight does not remain  unchanged; on the contrary, it increases from day to day by an  appreciable quantity.    This fact presupposes, that the assimilative process in the young  animal is more energetic, more intense, than the process of  transformation in the existing tissues. If both processes were  equally active, the weight of the body could not increase; and were  the waste by transformation greater, the weight of the body would  decrease.    Now, the circulation in the young animal is not weaker, but, on the  contrary, more rapid; the respirations are more frequent; and, for  equal bulks, the consumption of oxygen must be greater rather than  smaller in the young than in the adult animal. But, since the  metamorphosis of organised parts goes on more slowly, there would  ensue a deficiency of those substances, the carbon and hydrogen of  which are adapted for combination with oxygen; because, in the  carnivora, nature has destined the new compounds, produced by the  metamorphosis of organised parts, to furnish the necessary  resistance to the action of the oxygen, and to produce animal heat.  What is wanting for these purposes an Infinite Wisdom has supplied  to the young in its natural food.    The carbon and hydrogen of butter, and the carbon of the sugar of  milk, no part of either of which can yield blood, fibrine, or  albumen, are destined for the support of the respiratory process, at  an age when a greater resistance is opposed to the metamorphosis of  existing organisms; or, in other words, to the production of  compounds, which, in the adult state, are produced in quantity amply  sufficient for the purpose of respiration.    The young animal receives the constituents of its blood in the  caseine of the milk. A metamorphosis of existing organs goes on, for  bile and urine are secreted; the"]]]
