GUNTHER'S HALL    [Illustration]      [Illustration]        PRELUDE          _The curtain rises slowly. The scene is the same as      at the close of the second day, on the Valkyries'      rock; night. In the background, from below,      firelight shines. The three Norns, tall women in      long, dark, veil-like drapery. The first (eldest)      lies in the foreground, to the right, under the      spreading pine-tree; the second (younger) is      stretched on a shelving rock in front of the cave;      the third (youngest) sits in the centre at the      back on a rock near the peak. Motionless, gloomy      silence._      THE FIRST NORN    What light glimmers there?    THE SECOND NORN    Is it already dawn?    THE THIRD NORN        Loge's host  Glows in flame around the rock.      It is night.  Why spin we not, singing the while?    THE SECOND NORN [_To the first._    Where for our spinning and singing  Wilt thou fasten the rope?    THE FIRST NORN            [_While she loosens a golden rope from herself and          ties one end of it to a branch of the pine-tree._    I sing and wind the rope  Badly or well, as may be.      At the world-ash-tree      Once I wove,      When from the stem      There bourgeoned strong  The boughs of a sacred wood.      In the shadows cool      A fountain flowed;      Wisdom whispered      Low from its wave;  Of holy things I sang.      A dauntless God      Came to drink at the well;      For the draught he drank  He paid with the loss of an eye.      From the world-ash-tree  Wotan broke a holy bough;      From the bough he cut  And shaped the shaft of a spear.    As time rolled on the wood  Wasted and died of the wound;  Sere, leafless and barren,  Wan withered the tree;      Sadly the flow      Of the fountain failed;      Troubled grew      My sorrowful song.      And now no more  At the world-ash-tree I weave;      I needs must fasten  Here on the pine-tree my rope.      Sing, O sister--      Catch as I throw--  Canst thou tell us why?    THE SECOND NORN            [_Winds the rope thrown to her round a projecting          rock at the entrance of the cave._        Runes of treaties      Well weighed and pondered      Cut were by Wotan      In the shaft,  Which wielding, he swayed the world.      A hero bold  In fight then splintered the spear,      The hallowed haft  With its treaties cleaving in twain.      Then bade Wotan      Walhall's heroes      Hew down the world-ash-tree      Forthwith,  Both the stem and boughs sere and barren.      The ash-tree sank;  Sealed was the fountain that flowed.      Round the sharp edge  Of the rock I wind the rope:      Sing, O sister,      Catch as I throw;  Further canst thou tell?    THE THIRD NORN            [_Catching the rope and throwing the end behind          her._        The castle stands      By giants up reared.      With the Gods and the holy      Host of the heroes  Wotan sits in his hall;      And round the walls      Hewn logs are heaped,      High up-piled,      Ready for burning:  The world-ash-tree these were once.      When the wood  Flares up brightly and burns,      In its fire  Shall the fair hall be consumed.  And then shall the high Gods' downfall  Dawn in darkness for aye.      Know ye yet more,  Begin anew winding the rope;      Again I throw it      Back from the north.  Spin and sing, O my sister.            [_She throws the rope to the second Norn and the          second throws it to the first, who loosens the rope          from the bough and ties it on to another._    THE FIRST NORN            [_Looking towards the back._        Is it the dawn,      Or the firelight that flickers?  Grief-darkened is my gaze.      The holy past      I can scarce remember,      When Loge burst  Of old into burning fire.  Dost thou know how he fared?    THE SECOND NORN            [_Winding the rope which has been thrown to her          round the rock again._        Overcome by Wotan's      Spear and its magic,  Loge worked for the God;      Then, to win his freedom,      Gnawed with his tooth  The solemn runes on the shaft.      So with the potent      Spell of the spear-point      Wotan confined him  Flaming where Brünnhilde slumbered.  Canst thou tell us the end?    THE THIRD NORN        With the broken spear's      Sharp-piercing splinters      Wotan wounded  The blazing one deep in the breast;      Ravening fire      Springs from the wound,      And this is thrown      'Mid the world-ash-tree's  Hewn logs heaped ready for burning.      Would ye know      When that will be,  Wind, O sisters, the rope!            [_She throws the rope back; the second Norn winds          it up and throws it again to the first._    THE FIRST NORN            [_Fastening the rope again._        The night wanes,      Dark grows my vision;      I cannot find      The threads of the rope;  The strands are twisted and loose.      A horrible sight  Wildly vexes mine eyes:      Rhinegold  That black Alberich stole.  Knowest thou more thereof?    THE SECOND NORN            [_With laborious haste winds the rope round the          jagged rock at the mouth of the cave._        The rock's sharp edge      Is cutting the rope;      The threads loosen      Their hold and grow slack;  They droop tangled and frayed.      From woe and wrath  Rises the Nibelung's ring;      A curse of revenge  Ruthlessly gnaws at the strands:--  Canst thou the end foretell?    THE THIRD NORN            [_Hastily catching the rope which is thrown to her._        The rope is too short,      Too loose it hangs;      It must be stretched,      Pulled straighter, before  Its end can reach to the north!            [_She pulls hard at the rope, which breaks._        It breaks!    THE SECOND NORN        It breaks!    THE FIRST NORN        It breaks!            [_They take the pieces of broken rope and bind          their bodies together with them._    THE THREE NORNS    So ends wisdom eternal!      The wise ones      Will utter no more.  Descend to Erda! Descend!            [_They vanish. The dawn grows brighter; the          firelight from the valley gradually fades. Sunrise;          then broad daylight._            _Siegfried and Brünnhilde enter from the cave.

One single doubt      Yet makes me linger:      The fear my service      Has been too small.      The things the Gods taught me      I could give:      All the rich hoard      Of holy runes;      But by the hero      Who holds my heart      I have been robbed      Of my maiden valour.      In wisdom weak,      Although strong in will;      In love so rich,      In power so poor--      Must thou not scorn      Her lack of riches      Who, though so eager,      Can give nothing more?

BRÜNNHILDE        Those oaths remember      That unite us;      The faith and truth      That are between us,      And evermore      The love we live for;  Brünnhilde in thy breast  Will deeply burn then for aye!            [_She embraces Siegfried._    SIEGFRIED    Must I leave thee, O love,  In thy holy fortress of fire,            [_He has taken Alberich's ring from his finger, and          holds it out to Brünnhilde._    This ring of mine I give thee;  Let it pay for thy runes.  Of whatever deeds I did  The virtue lies therein.  By my hand was the dragon grim,  Who long had guarded it, slain;  Keep thou the gold and its might  As token true of my love!    BRÜNNHILDE            [_Putting on the ring in rapturous delight._    I covet it more than all else!  For the ring take Grane, my horse.      Through the air with me      He galloped once boldly,      But lost with mine      Was his magic art;      Upon clouds and storm,      Through thunder and lightning      No more  Gallantly now will he sweep!      But if thou lead the way,      Even through fire  Fearlessly Grane will follow.      For henceforth, hero,      Thou art his master!

Gravel flew from beneath skidding tires  as the highly maneuverable little ground-car took off. A screaming  turn into the deservedly famous Avenue of Oaks. Along the Avenue.  Through the Gate, the guards saluting smartly as the bug raced past  them. Past the barracks. Past the airport hangars and strips. Out  into the space-field, the scarred and blackened area devoted solely  to the widely-spaced docks of the tremendous vessels which plied the  vacuous reaches of inter-planetary and inter-stellar space. Spacedocks  were, and are, huge and sprawling structures; built of concrete and  steel and asbestos and ultra-stubborn refractory and insulation  and vacuum-breaks; fully air-conditioned and having refrigeration  equipment of thousands of tons per hour of ice; designed not only  to expedite servicing, unloading, and loading, but also to protect  materials and personnel from the raving, searing blasts of take-off and  of landing.    A space-dock is a squat and monstrous cylinder, into whose hollow top  the lowermost one-third of a space-ship's bulk fits as snugly as does a  baseball into the \"pocket\" of a veteran fielder's long-seasoned glove.  And the tremendous distances between those docks minimize the apparent  size, both of the structures themselves and of the vessels surmounting  them. Thus, from a distance, the _Chicago_ looked little enough, and  harmless enough; but as the bug flashed under the overhanging bulk and  the driver braked savagely to a stop at one of the dock's entrances,  Samms could scarcely keep from flinching. That featureless, gray,  smoothly curving wall of alloy steel loomed so incredibly high above  them--extended so terrifyingly far outward beyond its visible means of  support! It _must_ be on the very verge of crashing!    Samms stared deliberately at the mass of metal towering above him, then  smiled--not without effort--at his companion.    \"You'd think, Alex, that a man would get over being afraid that a ship  was going to fall on him, but I haven't--yet.\"    \"No, and you probably never will. I never have, and I'm one of the old  hands. Some claim not to mind it--but not in front of a lie detector.  That's why they had to make the passenger docks bigger than the  liners--too many passengers fainted and had to be carried aboard on  stretchers--or cancelled passage entirely. However, scaring hell out of  them on the ground had one big advantage; they felt so safe inside that  they didn't get the colly-wobbles so bad when they went free.\"    \"Well, I've got over _that_, anyway. Good-bye, Alex; and thanks.\"    Samms entered the dock, shot smoothly upward, followed an escorting  officer to the captain's own cabin, and settled himself into a  cushioned chair facing an ultra-wave view-plate. A face appeared upon  his communicator screen and spoke.    \"Winfield to First Lensman Samms--you will be ready to blast off at  twenty one hundred?\"    \"Samms to Captain Winfield,\" the Lensman replied. \"I will be ready.\"    Sirens yelled briefly; a noise which Samms knew was purely a formality.  Clearance had been issued; Station PIXNY was filling the air with  warnings. Personnel and material close enough to the _Chicago's_ dock  to be affected by the blast were under cover and safe.    The blast went on; the plate showed, instead of a view of the  space-field, a blaze of blue-white light. The war-ship was inertialess,  it is true; but so terrific were the forces released that incandescent  gases, furiously driven, washed the dock and everything for hundreds of  yards around it.    The plate cleared. Through the lower, denser layers of atmosphere the  _Chicago_ bored in seconds; then, as the air grew thinner and thinner,  she rushed upward faster and faster. The terrain below became  concave ... then convex. Being completely without inertia, the ship's  velocity was at every instant that at which the friction of the medium  through which she blasted her way equaled precisely the force of her  driving thrust.    Wherefore, out in open space, the Earth a fast-shrinking tiny ball and  Sol himself growing smaller, paler, and weaker at a startling rate, the  _Chicago's_ speed attained an almost constant value; a value starkly  impossible for the human mind to grasp.          CHAPTER 5      For hours Virgil Samms sat motionless, staring almost unseeing into his  plate. It was not that the view was not worth seeing--the wonder of  space, the ever-changing, constantly-shifting panorama of incredibly  brilliant although dimensionless points of light, against that wondrous  background of mist-besprinkled black velvet, is a thing that never  fails to awe even the most seasoned observer--but he had a tremendous  load on his mind. He had to solve an apparently insoluble problem.  How ... _how_ ... HOW could he do what he had to do?    Finally, knowing that the time of landing was approaching, he got up,  unfolded his fans, and swam lightly through the air of the cabin to a  hand-line, along which he drew himself into the control room. He could  have made the trip in that room, of course, if he had so chosen; but,  knowing that officers of space do not really like to have strangers in  that sanctum, he did not intrude until it was necessary.    Captain Winfield was already strapped down at his master conning plate.  Pilots, navigators, and computers worked busily at their respective  tasks.    \"I was just going to call you, First Lensman.\" Winfield waved a  hand in the general direction of a chair near his own. \"Take the  Lieutenant-Captain's station, please.\" Then, after a few minutes: \"Go  inert, Mr. White.\"    \"Attention, all personnel,\" Lieutenant-Captain White spoke  conversationally into a microphone. \"Prepare for inert maneuvering,  Class Three. Off.\"    A bank of tiny red lights upon a panel turned green practically as  one. White cut the Bergenholm, whereupon Virgil Samms' mass changed  instantly from a weight of zero to one of five hundred and twenty  five pounds--ships of war then had no space to waste upon such  non-essentials as artificial gravity. Although he was braced for the  change and cushioned against it, the Lensman's breath _whooshed!_ out  sharply; but, being intensely interested in what was going on, he  swallowed convulsively a couple of times, gasped a few deep breaths,  and fought his way back up to normalcy.    The Chief Pilot was now at work, with all the virtuoso's skill of his  rank and grade; one of the hall-marks of which is to make difficult  tasks look easy. He played trills and runs and arpeggios--at times  veritable glissades--upon keyboards and pedals, directing with  micrometric precision the tremendous forces of the superdreadnaught to  the task of matching the intrinsic velocity of New York Spaceport at  the time of his departure to the I. V. of the surface of the planet so  far below.    Samms stared into his plate; first at the incredibly tiny apparent size  of that incredibly hot sun, and then at the barren-looking world toward  which they were dropping at such terrific speed.    \"It doesn't seem possible ...\" he remarked, half to Winfield, half  to himself, \"that a sun could be that big and that hot. Rigel Four  is almost two hundred times as far away from it as Earth is from  Sol--something like eighteen billion miles--it doesn't look much, if  any, bigger than Venus does from Luna--yet this world is hotter than  the Sahara Desert.\"    \"Well, blue giants are both big and hot,\" the captain replied,  matter-of-factly, \"and their radiation, being mostly invisible, is  deadly stuff. And Rigel is about the biggest in this region. There are  others a lot worse, though. Doradus S, for instance, would make Rigel,  here, look like a tallow candle. I'm going out there, some of these  days, just to take a look at it. But that's enough of astronomical  chit-chat--we're down to twenty miles of altitude and we've got your  city just about stopped.\"    The _Chicago_ slowed gently to a halt; perched motionless upon softly  hissing jets. Samms directed his visibeam downward and sent along it  an exploring, questing thought. Since he had never met a Rigellian in  person, he could not form the mental image or pattern necessary to  become en rapport with any one individual of the race. He did know,  however, the type of mind which must be possessed by the entity with  whom he wished to talk, and he combed the Rigellian city until he found  one. The rapport was so incomplete and imperfect as to amount almost to  no contact at all, but he could, perhaps, make himself understood.    \"If you will excuse this possibly unpleasant and certainly unwarranted  intrusion,\" he thought, carefully and slowly, \"I would like very  much to discuss with you a matter which should become of paramount  importance to all the intelligent peoples of all the planets in space.\"    \"I welcome you, Tellurian.\" Mind fused with mind at every one of  uncountable millions of points and paths. This Rigellian professor  of sociology, standing at his desk, was physically a monster ...  the oil-drum of a body, the four blocky legs, the multi-branchiate  tentacular arms, that immobile dome of a head, the complete lack  of eyes and of ears ... nevertheless Samms' mind fused with the  monstrosity's as smoothly, as effortlessly, and almost as completely as  it had with his own daughter's!    And _what_ a mind! The transcendent poise; the staggeringly tremendous  range and scope--the untroubled and unshakeable calm; the sublime  quietude; the vast and placid certainty; the ultimate stability,  unknown and forever unknowable to any human or near-human race!    \"Dismiss all thought of intrusion, First Lensman Samms ... I have heard  of you human beings, of course, but have never considered seriously the  possibility of meeting one of you mind to mind. Indeed, it was reported  that none of our minds could make any except"]]]
