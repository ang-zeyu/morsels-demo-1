But as regards groups within a state, it is  internal independence that must be emphasized, since that is what is  lacking; subjection to law has been secured, on the whole, since the  end of the Middle Ages.  In the relations between states, on the  contrary, it is law and a central government that are lacking, since  independence exists for external as for internal affairs.  The stage  we have reached in the affairs of Europe corresponds to the stage  reached in our internal affairs during the Wars of the Roses, when  turbulent barons frustrated the attempt to make them keep the king's  peace.  Thus, although the goal is the same in the two cases, the  steps to be taken in order to achieve it are quite different.    There can be no good international system until the boundaries of  states coincide as nearly as possible with the boundaries of nations.    But it is not easy to say what we mean by a nation.  Are the Irish a  nation?  Home Rulers say yes, Unionists say no.  Are the Ulstermen a  nation?  Unionists say yes, Home Rulers say no.  In all such cases it  is a party question whether we are to call a group a nation or not.  A  German will tell you that the Russian Poles are a nation, but as for  the Prussian Poles, they, of course, are part of Prussia.  Professors  can always be hired to prove, by arguments of race or language or  history, that a group about which there is a dispute is, or is not, a  nation, as may be desired by those whom the professors serve.  If we  are to avoid all these controversies, we must first of all endeavor to  find some definition of a nation.    A nation is not to be defined by affinities of language or a common  historical origin, though these things often help to produce a nation.  Switzerland is a nation, despite diversities of race, religion, and  language.  England and Scotland now form one nation, though they did  not do so at the time of the Civil War.  This is shown by Cromwell's  saying, in the height of the conflict, that he would rather be subject  to the domain of the royalists than to that of the Scotch.  Great  Britain was one state before it was one nation; on the other hand,  Germany was one nation before it was one state.    What constitutes a nation is a sentiment and an instinct, a sentiment  of similarity and an instinct of belonging to the same group or herd.  The instinct is an extension of the instinct which constitutes a flock  of sheep, or any other group of gregarious animals.  The sentiment  which goes with this is like a milder and more extended form of family  feeling.  When we return to England after being on the Continent, we  feel something friendly in the familiar ways, and it is easy to  believe that Englishmen on the whole are virtuous, while many  foreigners are full of designing wickedness.    Such feelings make it easy to organize a nation into a state.  It is  not difficult, as a rule, to acquiesce in the orders of a national  government.  We feel that it is our government, and that its decrees  are more or less the same as those which we should have given if we  ourselves had been the governors.  There is an instinctive and usually  unconscious sense of a common purpose animating the members of a  nation.  This becomes especially vivid when there is war or a danger  of war.  Any one who, at such a time, stands out against the orders of  his government feels an inner conflict quite different from any that  he would feel in standing out against the orders of a foreign  government in whose power he might happen to find himself.  If he  stands out, he does so with some more or less conscious hope that his  government may in time come to think as he does; whereas, in standing  out against a foreign government, no such hope is necessary.  This  group instinct, however it may have arisen, is what constitutes a  nation, and what makes it important that the boundaries of nations  should also be the boundaries of states.    National sentiment is a fact, and should be taken account of by  institutions.  When it is ignored, it is intensified and becomes a  source of strife.  It can only be rendered harmless by being given  free play, so long as it is not predatory.  But it is not, in itself,  a good or admirable feeling.  There is nothing rational and nothing  desirable in a limitation of sympathy which confines it to a fragment  of the human race.  Diversities of manners and customs and traditions  are, on the whole, a good thing, since they enable different nations  to produce different types of excellence.  But in national feeling  there is always latent or explicit an element of hostility to  foreigners.  National feeling, as we know it, could not exist in a  nation which was wholly free from external pressure of a hostile kind.    And group feeling produces a limited and often harmful kind of  morality.  Men come to identify the good with what serves the  interests of their own group, and the bad with what works against  those interests, even if it should happen to be in the interests of  mankind as a whole.  This group morality is very much in evidence  during war, and is taken for granted in men's ordinary thought.  Although almost all Englishmen consider the defeat of Germany  desirable for the good of the world, yet nevertheless most of them  honor a German for fighting for his country, because it has not  occurred to them that his actions ought to be guided by a morality  higher than that of the group.    A man does right, as a rule, to have his thoughts more occupied with  the interests of his own nation than with those of others, because his  actions are more likely to affect his own nation.  But in time of war,  and in all matters which are of equal concern to other nations and to  his own, a man ought to take account of the universal welfare, and not  allow his survey to be limited by the interest, or supposed interest,  of his own group or nation.    So long as national feeling exists, it is very important that each  nation should be self-governing as regards its internal affairs.  Government can only be carried on by force and tyranny if its subjects  view it with hostile eyes, and they will so view it if they feel that  it belongs to an alien nation.  This principle meets with difficulties  in cases where men of different nations live side by side in the same  area, as happens in some parts of the Balkans.  There are also  difficulties in regard to places which, for some geographical reason,  are of great international importance, such as the Suez Canal and the  Panama Canal.  In such cases the purely local desires of the  inhabitants may have to give way before larger interests.  But in  general, at any rate as applied to civilized communities, the  principle that the boundaries of nations ought to coincide with the  boundaries of states has very few exceptions.    This principle, however, does not decide how the relations between  states are to be regulated, or how a conflict of interests between  rival states is to be decided.  At present, every great state claims  absolute sovereignty, not only in regard to its internal affairs but  also in regard to its external actions.  This claim to absolute  sovereignty leads it into conflict with similar claims on the part of  other great states.  Such conflicts at present can only be decided by  war or diplomacy, and diplomacy is in essence nothing but the threat  of war.  There is no more justification for the claim to absolute  sovereignty on the part of a state than there would be for a similar  claim on the part of an individual.  The claim to absolute sovereignty  is, in effect, a claim that all external affairs are to be regulated  purely by force, and that when two nations or groups of nations are  interested in a question, the decision shall depend solely upon which  of them is, or is believed to be, the stronger.  This is nothing but  primitive anarchy, \"the war of all against all,\" which Hobbes asserted  to be the original state of mankind.    There cannot be secure peace in the world, or any decision of  international questions according to international law, until states  are willing to part with their absolute sovereignty as regards their  external relations, and to leave the decision in such matters to some  international instrument of government.[5]  An international government  will have to be legislative as well as judicial.  It is not enough  that there should be a Hague tribunal, deciding matters according to  some already existing system of international law; it is necessary  also that there should be a body capable of enacting international  law, and this body will have to have the power of transferring  territory from one state to another, when it is persuaded that  adequate grounds exist for such a transference.  Friends of peace will  make a mistake if they unduly glorify the _status quo_.  Some nations  grow, while others dwindle; the population of an area may change its  character by emigration and immigration.  There is no good reason why  states should resent changes in their boundaries under such  conditions, and if no international authority has power to make  changes of this kind, the temptations to war will sometimes become  irresistible.    [5] For detailed scheme of international government see \"International  Government,\" by L. Woolf. Allen & Unwin.    The international authority ought to possess an army and navy, and  these ought to be the only army and navy in existence.  The only  legitimate use of force is to diminish the total amount of force  exercised in the world.  So long as men are free to indulge their  predatory instincts, some men or groups of men will take advantage of  this freedom for oppression and robbery.  Just as the police are  necessary to prevent the use of force by private citizens, so an  international police will be necessary to prevent the lawless use of  force by separate states.    But I think "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/479"],[0,"Little Lord Fauntleroy (#12)"],[1,"to you, have I?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Lord Fauntleroy brightly; \"I'm ever so much obliged to  you about Bridget, and the apple-woman, and Dick.\"    \"Bridget!\" exclaimed the Earl. \"Dick! The apple-woman!\"    \"Yes!\" explained Cedric; \"the ones you gave me all that money for--the  money you told Mr. Havisham to give me if I wanted it.\"    \"Ha!\" ejaculated his lordship. \"That's it, is it? The money you were  to spend as you liked. What did you buy with it? I should like to hear  something about that.\"    He drew his shaggy eyebrows together and looked at the child sharply. He  was secretly curious to know in what way the lad had indulged himself.    \"Oh!\" said Lord Fauntleroy, \"perhaps you didn't know about Dick and the  apple-woman and Bridget. I forgot you lived such a long way off from  them. They were particular friends of mine. And you see Michael had the  fever----\"    \"Who's Michael?\" asked the Earl.    \"Michael is Bridget's husband, and they were in great trouble. When a  man is sick and can't work and has twelve children, you know how it is.  And Michael has always been a sober man. And Bridget used to come to our  house and cry. And the evening Mr. Havisham was there, she was in the  kitchen crying, because they had almost nothing to eat and couldn't pay  the rent; and I went in to see her, and Mr. Havisham sent for me and he  said you had given him some money for me. And I ran as fast as I could  into the kitchen and gave it to Bridget; and that made it all right; and  Bridget could scarcely believe her eyes. That's why I'm so obliged to  you.\"    \"Oh!\" said the Earl in his deep voice, \"that was one of the things you  did for yourself, was it? What else?\"    Dougal had been sitting by the tall chair; the great dog had taken its  place there when Cedric sat down. Several times it had turned and looked  up at the boy as if interested in the conversation. Dougal was a  solemn dog, who seemed to feel altogether too big to take life's  responsibilities lightly. The old Earl, who knew the dog well, had  watched it with secret interest. Dougal was not a dog whose habit it was  to make acquaintances rashly, and the Earl wondered somewhat to see how  quietly the brute sat under the touch of the childish hand. And, just  at this moment, the big dog gave little Lord Fauntleroy one more look  of dignified scrutiny, and deliberately laid its huge, lion-like head on  the boy's black-velvet knee.    The small hand went on stroking this new friend as Cedric answered:    \"Well, there was Dick,\" he said. \"You'd like Dick, he's so square.\"    This was an Americanism the Earl was not prepared for.    \"What does that mean?\" he inquired.    Lord Fauntleroy paused a moment to reflect. He was not very sure himself  what it meant. He had taken it for granted as meaning something very  creditable because Dick had been fond of using it.    \"I think it means that he wouldn't cheat any one,\" he exclaimed; \"or  hit a boy who was under his size, and that he blacks people's boots  very well and makes them shine as much as he can. He's a perfessional  bootblack.\"    \"And he's one of your acquaintances, is he?\" said the Earl.    \"He is an old friend of mine,\" replied his grandson. \"Not quite as old  as Mr. Hobbs, but quite old. He gave me a present just before the ship  sailed.\"    He put his hand into his pocket and drew forth a neatly folded red  object and opened it with an air of affectionate pride. It was the red  silk handkerchief with the large purple horse-shoes and heads on it.    \"He gave me this,\" said his young lordship. \"I shall keep it always. You  can wear it round your neck or keep it in your pocket. He bought it with  the first money he earned after I bought Jake out and gave him the new  brushes. It's a keepsake. I put some poetry in Mr. Hobbs's watch. It  was, 'When this you see, remember me.' When this I see, I shall always  remember Dick.\"    The sensations of the Right Honorable the Earl of Dorincourt could  scarcely be described. He was not an old nobleman who was very easily  bewildered, because he had seen a great deal of the world; but here was  something he found so novel that it almost took his lordly breath away,  and caused him some singular emotions. He had never cared for children;  he had been so occupied with his own pleasures that he had never had  time to care for them. His own sons had not interested him when they  were very young--though sometimes he remembered having thought Cedric's  father a handsome and strong little fellow. He had been so selfish  himself that he had missed the pleasure of seeing unselfishness in  others, and he had not known how tender and faithful and affectionate a  kind-hearted little child can be, and how innocent and unconscious are  its simple, generous impulses. A boy had always seemed to him a most  objectionable little animal, selfish and greedy and boisterous when not  under strict restraint; his own two eldest sons had given their tutors  constant trouble and annoyance, and of the younger one he fancied he had  heard few complaints because the boy was of no particular importance. It  had never once occurred to him that he should like his grandson; he had  sent for the little Cedric because his pride impelled him to do so. If  the boy was to take his place in the future, he did not wish his name  to be made ridiculous by descending to an uneducated boor. He had been  convinced the boy would be a clownish fellow if he were brought up in  America. He had no feeling of affection for the lad; his only hope was  that he should find him decently well-featured, and with a respectable  share of sense; he had been so disappointed in his other sons, and had  been made so furious by Captain Errol's American marriage, that he had  never once thought that anything creditable could come of it. When the  footman had announced Lord Fauntleroy, he had almost dreaded to look at  the boy lest he should find him all that he had feared. It was because  of this feeling that he had ordered that the child should be sent to  him alone. His pride could not endure that others should see his  disappointment if he was to be disappointed. His proud, stubborn old  heart therefore had leaped within him when the boy came forward with his  graceful, easy carriage, his fearless hand on the big dog's neck. Even  in the moments when he had hoped the most, the Earl had never hoped that  his grandson would look like that. It seemed almost too good to be true  that this should be the boy he had dreaded to see--the child of the  woman he so disliked--this little fellow with so much beauty and such  a brave, childish grace! The Earl's stern composure was quite shaken by  this startling surprise.    And then their talk began; and he was still more curiously moved, and  more and more puzzled. In the first place, he was so used to seeing  people rather afraid and embarrassed before him, that he had expected  nothing else but that his grandson would be timid or shy. But Cedric was  no more afraid of the Earl than he had been of Dougal. He was not bold;  he was only innocently friendly, and he was not conscious that there  could be any reason why he should be awkward or afraid. The Earl could  not help seeing that the little boy took him for a friend and treated  him as one, without having any doubt of him at all. It was quite plain  as the little fellow sat there in his tall chair and talked in his  friendly way that it had never occurred to him that this large,  fierce-looking old man could be anything but kind to him, and rather  pleased to see him there. And it was plain, too, that, in his childish  way, he wished to please and interest his grandfather. Cross, and  hard-hearted, and worldly as the old Earl was, he could not help feeling  a secret and novel pleasure in this very confidence. After all, it was  not disagreeable to meet some one who did not distrust him or shrink  from him, or seem to detect the ugly part of his nature; some one who  looked at him with clear, unsuspecting eyes,--if it was only a little  boy in a black velvet suit.    So the old man leaned back in his chair, and led his young companion  on to telling him still more of himself, and with that odd gleam in his  eyes watched the little fellow as he talked. Lord Fauntleroy was quite  willing to answer all his questions and chatted on in his genial little  way quite composedly. He told him all about Dick and Jake, and the  apple-woman, and Mr. Hobbs; he described the Republican Rally in all  the glory of its banners and transparencies, torches and rockets. In  the course of the conversation, he reached the Fourth of July and  the Revolution, and was just becoming enthusiastic, when he suddenly  recollected something and stopped very abruptly.    \"What is the matter?\" demanded his grandfather. \"Why don't you go on?\"    Lord Fauntleroy moved rather uneasily in his chair. It was evident to  the Earl that he was embarrassed by the thought which had just occurred  to him.    \"I was just thinking that perhaps you mightn't like it,\" he replied.  \"Perhaps some one belonging to you might have been there. I forgot you  were an Englishman.\"    \"You can go on,\" said my lord. \"No one belonging to me was there. You  forgot you were an Englishman, too.\"    \"Oh! no,\" said Cedric quickly. \"I'm an American!\"    \"You are an Englishman,\" said the Earl grimly. \"Your father was an  Englishman.\"    It amused him a little to say this, but it did not amuse Cedric. The lad  had never thought of such a development as this. He felt himself grow  quite hot up to the roots of his hair.    \"I was born in America,\" he protested. \"You have to be an American if  you are born in America. I beg your pardon,\" with serious politeness  and delicacy, \"for contradicting you. Mr. Hobbs told me, if there were  another war, you know, I should have to--to be an American.\"    The Earl gave a grim half laugh--it was short and grim, but it was a  laugh.    \"You would, would you?\""]]]
