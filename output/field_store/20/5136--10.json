I can't bear to have you.\"    \"Well, I won't then,\" said Clover good-humoredly, facing round with  her back to the window.  \"I wasn't looking at them either,--not  exactly.  I was thinking about Elsie and John, and wondering--But  what's the matter, Katy?  What makes you fire up so about it?  You've  watched the ball-playing yourself plenty of times.\"    \"I know I have, and I didn't mean to be cross, Clovy.  The truth is  I am all put out.  These girls with incessant talk about the students  make me absolutely sick.  It is so unladylike, and so bad, especially  for the little ones.  Fancy that mite of a Carrie Steele informing me  that she is \"in love\" with Harry Crosby.  In love!  A baby like that!  She has no business to know that there is such a thing.\"    \"Yes,\" said Clover laughing: \"she wrote his name on a wintergreen  lozenge, and bored a hole and hung it round her neck on a blue ribbon.  But it melted and stuck to her frock, and she had to take it off.\"    \"Whereupon she ate it,\" added Rose, who came in at that moment.    The girls shouted, but Katy soon grew grave.  \"One can't help  laughing,\" she said, \"but isn't it a shame to have such things going  on?  Just fancy our Elsie behaving so, Clover!  Why, papa would have  a fit.  I declare, I've a great mind to get up a society to put down  flirting.\"    \"Do!\" said Rose.  \"What fun it would be!  Call it 'The Society for  the Suppression of Young Men.'  I'll join.\"    \"You, indeed!\" replied Katy, shaking her head.  \"Didn't I see Berry  Searles throw a bunch of syringa into your window only this morning?\"    \"Dear me! did he?  I shall have to speak to Mary again.  It's quite  shocking to have her go on so.  But really and truly do let us have  a Society.  It would be so jolly.  We could meet on Saturday  afternoons, and write pieces and have signals and a secret, as  Sylvia's Society did when she was at school.  Get one up, Katy,--  that's a dear.\"    \"But,\" said Katy, taken aback by having her random idea so suddenly  adopted, \"if I did get one up, it would be in real earnest, and it  would be a society against flirting.  And you know you can't help  it, Rosy.\"    \"Yes, I can.  You are doing me great injustice.  I don't behave like  those girls in Attic Row.  I never did.  I just bow to Berry and the  rest whom I really know,--never to anybody else.  And you must see,  Katherine darling, that it would be the height of ingratitude if I  didn't bow to the boys who made mud pies for me when I was little,  and lent me their marbles, and did all sorts of kind things.  Now  wouldn't it?\"--coaxingly.    \"Per--haps,\" admitted Katy, with a smile.  \"But you're such a witch!\"    \"I'm not,--indeed I'm not.  I'll be a pillar of society if only you'll  provide a Society for me to be a pillar of.  Now, Katy, do--ah, do, do!\"    When Rose was in a coaxing mood, few people could resist her.  Katy  yielded, and between jest and earnest the matter was settled.  Katy  was to head the plan and invite the members.    \"Only a few at first,\" suggested Rose.  \"When it is proved to be a  success, and everybody wants to join, we can let in two or three more  as a great favor.  What shall the name be?  We'll keep it a secret,  whatever it is.  There's no fun in a society without a secret.\"    What should the name be?  Rose invented half a dozen, each more absurd  than the last.  \"The Anti-Jane Society\" would sound well, she insisted.  Or, no!--the \"Put-him-down-Club\" was better yet!  Finally they settled  upon \"The Society for the Suppression of Unladylike Conduct.\"    \"Only we'll never use the whole name,\" said Rose: \"We'll say, 'The  S. S .U. C.'  That sounds brisk and snappy, and will drive the whole  school wild with curiosity.  What larks!  How I long to begin!\"    The next Saturday was fixed upon for the first meeting.  During the  week Katy proposed the plan to the elect few, all of whom accepted  enthusiastically.  Lilly Page was the only person who declined.  She  said it would be stupid; that for her part she didn't set up to be  \"proper\" or better than she was, and that in any case she shouldn't  wish to be mixed up in a Society of which \"Miss Agnew\" was a member.  The girls did not break their hearts over this refusal.  They had  felt obliged to ask her for relationship's sake, but everybody was  a little relieved that she did not wish to join.    No. 6 looked very full indeed that Saturday afternoon when the S. S.  U. C. came together for the first time.  Ten members were present.  Mary Silver and Louisa were two; and Rose's crony, Esther Dearborn,  another.  The remaining four were Sally Alsop and Amy Erskine; Alice  Gibbons, one of the new scholars, whom they all liked, but did not  know very well; and Ellen Gray, a pale, quiet girl, with droll blue  eyes, a comical twist to her mouth, and a trick of saying funny  things in such a demure way that half the people who listened never  found out that they were funny.  All Rose's chairs had been borrowed  for the occasion.  Three girls sat on the bed, and three on the floor.  With a little squeezing, there was plenty of room for everybody.    Katy was chosen President, and requested to take the rocking-chair as  a sign of office.  This she did with much dignity, and proceeded to  read the Constitution and By-Laws of the Society, which had been drawn  up by Rose Red, and copied on an immense sheet of blue paper.    They ran thus:--      CONSTITUTION FOR THE SOCIETY FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF UNLADYLIKE      CONDUCT, KNOWN TO THE UNINITIATED AS THE S. S. U. C.      ARTICLE I.         The object of this Society is twofold: it combines       having a good time with the Pursuit of VIRTUE.      ARTICLE II.         The good time is to take place once a week in No. 6       Quaker Row, between the hours of four and six P. M.      ARTICLE III.         The nature of the good time is to be decided upon by       a Committee to be appointed each Saturday by the members       of the Society.      ARTICLE IV.         VIRTUE is to be pursued at all times and in all seasons,       by the members of the Society setting their faces against       the practice of bowing and speaking to young gentlemen       who are not acquaintances; waving of pocket handkerchiefs,       signals from windows, and any species of conduct which       would be thought unladylike by nice people anywhere, and       especially by the mammas of the Society.      ARTICLE V.         The members of the Society pledge themselves to use their       influence against these practices, both by precept and       example.                 In witness whereof we sign.                                 Katherine Carr, President.                               Rosamond Redding, Secretary.                               Clover E. Carr.                               Mary L. Silver.                               Esther Dearborn.                               Sally P. Alsop.                               Amy W. Erskine.                               Alice Gibbons.                               Ellen Whitworth Gray.      Next followed the By-Laws.  Katy had not been able to see the necessity  of having any By-Laws, but Rose had insisted.  She had never heard of  a Society without them, she said, and she didn't think it would be  \"legal\" to leave them out.  It had cost her some trouble to invent  them, but at last they stood thus:--        BY-LAW NO. 1.    The members of the S. S. U. C. will observe the following signals:--      1st. The Grip.--This is given by inserting the first and middle      finger of the right hand between the thumb and fourth finger of      the respondent's left, and describing a rotatory motion in the      air with the little finger.  N. B. Much practice is necessary      to enable members to exchange this signal in such a manner as      not to attract attention.      2nd. The Signal of Danger.--This signal is for use when Miss Jane,      or any other foe-woman, heaves into sight.  It consists in      rubbing the nose violently, and at the same time giving three      stamps on the floor with the left foot.  It must be done with      an air of unconsciousness.      3rd. The Signal for Consultation.--This signal is for use when      immediate communication is requisite between members of the      Society.  It consists of a pinch on the back of the right      hand, accompanied by the word \"Holofernes\" pronounced in a      low voice.      BY-LAW NO. 2.      The members of the S. S. U. C.  pledge themselves to inviolable      secrecy about all Society proceedings.      BY-LAW NO. 3      The members of the S. S. U. C. will bring their Saturday corn-      balls to swell the common entertainment.      BY-LAW NO. 4.      Members having boxes from home are at liberty to contribute such      part of the contents as they please to the aforementioned      common entertainment.        Here the By-Laws ended.  There was much laughter over them, especially  over the last.    \"Why did you put that in, Rosy?\" asked Ellen Gray: \"it strikes me as  hardly necessary.\"    \"Oh,\" replied Rose, \"I put that in to encourage Silvery Mary there.  She's expecting a box soon, and I knew that she would pine to give  the Society a share, but would be too timid to propose it; so I  thought I would just pave the way.\"    \"How truly kind!\" laughed Clover.    \"Now,\" said the President, \"the entertainment of the meeting will  begin by the reading of 'Trailing Arbutus,' a poem by C. E. C.\"    Clover had been very unwilling to read the first piece, and had only  yielded after much coaxing from Rose, who had bestowed upon her in  consequence the name of Quintia Curtia.  She felt very shy as she  stood up with her paper in hand, and her voice trembled perceptibly;  but after a minute she grew used to the sound of it, and read steadily.                                 TRAILING ARBUTUS.

One of their spectacular feats was the rescue of an airplane crew in  Florida in 1933. Two pilots flying to Miami from Tampa for the Air Races  had made a forced landing in the Everglades. Searching airplanes located  the ship, but it was far from any highway, inaccessible by boat or on  foot, the men without food and tormented by mosquitos, and with  apparently no way of ever getting out unless a road could be built in to  them. But a blimp found it easy, because it alone of all craft could  stand virtually still in the air.

All these exploits were incidental to the job of learning about airships  and airship weather--the tricks of winds and rain and storms. And they  did learn. A hangar had been built in the woods at Grosse Ile, Detroit,  with a lane of trees left standing so as to extend the line of the  building--this under the assumption that the trees would protect the  airships while entering or leaving. The British, under stress of war  conditions had done this, used woods as windbreaks for landings, even  for the assembly of airships at times.    But the wind has a trick of spilling over, like a waterfall, when it  strikes an obstruction. Early pilots were expert balloonists, and might  have remembered their experience in riding over mountainous  country--observed how the wind would carry them almost into a cliff, but  just before reaching it would pick the great bag gently up, carry it  over the top, drop it on the far side, almost to the bottom of the next  valley--but not quite, pick it up and carry on--a graphic chart of the  air flow in broken terrain.    But in the first weeks of operation at Detroit, a cross-hangar wind,  spilling over the windbreak, twice pushed an airship gently but firmly  into the trees on the far side. The trees were cut down, and the study  of eddies and gusts hastened the development of a mobile mooring mast  which would hold the ship steady in turbulent areas.    The Goodyear pilots learned to fly unworried through fog. As early as  1920, Hockensmith, flying the \"Pony Blimp\" from Los Angeles to Catalina  Island, got lost when his compass failed in a fog so dense he could  hardly see the nose of the ship. Flying low and slowly, barely off the  water, he presently spied a dark shape ahead, came on a U. S. submarine,  with decks awash, and an officer on lookout in the conning tower. He  landed on his pontoons, taxied alongside, borrowed a compass, went on to  his destination.    The conviction that except within its hangar the ship was safest in the  air, grew out of many battles with wind and storm. Brannigan, flying the  Vigilant at Washington, was caught in a storm which broke up an  aeronautic show, wrecked several planes on the ground, sent the rest  scattering for shelter. Piling extra cans of gasoline aboard, Brannigan  cut his ship loose, headed into the wind, a wind so high that at times  he found himself pushed backward at full throttle, hovered for an hour  and a half over the capital, waiting the storm out, then flew 150 miles  down the bay to Langley field and put up for the night.    On another occasion at Winston Salem, with his ship on the mast,  Brannigan was caught in a sleet storm, found his ship bowed down and  being crushed by the weight of ice on its back. Getting extra men from  the city fire department, he braced his control surfaces with poles,  beat off the ice on the bag as high as he could reach with branches,  built oil smudge fires alongside to melt the ice, took off all possible  equipment, to lighten ship, kept his craft headed into the wind, fought  the storm successfully--and in the morning as the sun came out and the  ice melted, flew on to Florida.    Boettner, starting south in 1930 in the larger Defender attempting a  non-stop flight to Miami, ran into ice and snow in the Tennessee  mountains. An oil line froze. His mechanic climbed out on the outriggers  and made emergency repairs in flight, but not before the ship had lost  most of its oil. Reaching Knoxville airport by morning, he dropped a  note, lowered a line, hauled up additional oil, refilled the tanks, went  on to the Gadsden hangar to complete repairs.    No Goodyear blimp has ever been damaged by storms while in the air,  though a bit of resourcefulness was needed from time to time. For that  matter, inquiry does not disclose any cases of a non-rigid airship being  damaged by storm while in flight.    Two Goodyear blimps were in the path of the 1938 hurricane, which,  heading for Florida from the Caribbean, changed its course erratically  and moved up the coast, shot across New England. Lange, with the  Enterprise, was at New Brunswick, N.J., 50 miles off the direct course  of the hurricane. He put his ship on the mast, held it there during  winds which rose as high as 73 miles per hour. He put extra men on the  handling lines, doubled the number of screw stakes which held the mast,  used the bus, with its motor wide open, as further re-enforcement. The  storm raged furiously at the ship for hours but couldn't budge it and  when the hurricane passed on, everything was intact.    Boettner, with the Puritan at Springfield, Mass., was almost directly at  the axis of the storm. He made the same gallant fight as Lange, but  against winds which roared to 100 miles per hour in gusts, uprooted  100-year-old trees, tugged at a sheet-iron hangar roof, flapping it up  and down, finally ripped it loose, sailed it like a child's kite across  the airport and out of sight.    At the peak of the storm the steel chains attaching the mast cables to  the screw stakes failed on the windward side, thrusting the mast into  the side of the ship, cutting a hole in the fabric. Boettner pulled out  the rip panel, deflating the ship to prevent further damage and when the  storm passed rolled up the bag, loaded it and the control car aboard a  truck, shipped it into Akron where a new bag was attached. The Puritan  was back at work within a week.    No wonder Goodyear pilots came to have great faith in the staunchness of  their craft, and their ability to get out of trouble.    Fuel exhaustion didn't bother the blimp. Fickes found that out early, at  Wingfoot Lake, when a leak developed in his tank and emptied it. Free  ballooning his ship he floated over a farm house, asked them to call the  office, waited aloft till a truck came out with additional fuel.    Boettner had a similar difficulty while returning from Canada in the  Defender. Persistent headwinds cut down his fuel and when he reached the  American shore around midnight it was a question whether he could go on  as far as Akron. Picking up U. S. Highway Five as being heavily  traveled, he swung low over an adjoining field, slowed down so that his  mechanic could drop off, flag a passing car and go into town for gas. By  the time the aide returned a number of cars had parked alongside.  Driving into the field, with headlights full on they formed a half  circle, and the drivers caught the lines, held the ship till the fuel  could be delivered, and Boettner proceeded on to Wingfoot Lake.    Mishaps there were of course, in all these years, but few were serious.  Lange snagged a lone dead tree in the fog over the Alabama mountains and  Smith side-swiped another while flying over a pass in Tennessee. The  ship settled easily to the ground in each instance, and farmers came in  with stone boats, carried the car and bag to town for repairs.    Brannigan, returning at night from Syracuse, ran short of gasoline,  directed his ground crew to land him in an open field ahead. The ship  nosed down, his aide directing the men with his flashlight. But just at  this juncture the top of the flashlight fell off into the propeller, was  whipped into the bag like a bullet, started a leak which was not  discovered till next day.    Most ships in the Goodyear fleet have been fired on by thoughtless  hunters. Once a bullet went through a ship a few inches back of the  pilot. One marksman was arrested and sent to jail in Florida. Pilot  Trotter had a curious experience in Oklahoma in 1935, while on his way  to the Dallas fair. The ship had been on the mast for three days waiting  for weather. On the fourth"]]]
