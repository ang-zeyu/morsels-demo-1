[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5713"],[0,"Tales of War (#12)"],[1,"an Irishman who sails from America for those historic lands knows  that the old trees that stand there have their roots far down in soil  once richened by Irish blood. When the Boyne was lost and won, and  Ireland had lost her King, many an Irishman with all his wealth in a  scabbard looked upon exile as his sovereign's court. And so they came  to the lands of foreign kings, with nothing to offer for the  hospitality that was given them but a sword; and it usually was a  sword with which kings were well content. Louis XV had many of them,  and was glad to have them at Fontenoy; the Spanish King admitted them  to the Golden Fleece; they defended Maria Theresa. Landen in Flanders  and Cremona knew them. A volume were needed to tell of all those  swords; more than one Muse has remembered them. It was not disloyalty  that drove them forth; their King was gone, they followed, the oak was  smitten and brown were the leaves of the tree.    But no such mournful metaphor applies to the men who march to-day  towards the plains where the \"Wild Geese\" were driven. They go with  no country mourning them, but their whole land cheers them on; they go  to the inherited battlefields. And there is this difference in their  attitude to kings, that those knightly Irishmen of old, driven  homeless over-sea, appeared as exiles suppliant for shelter before the  face of the Grand Monarch, and he, no doubt with exquisite French  grace, gave back to them all they had lost except what was lost  forever, salving so far as he could the injustice suffered by each.  But to-day when might, for its turn, is in the hands of democracies,  the men whose fathers built the Statue of Liberty have left their  country to bring back an exiled king to his home, and to right what  can be righted of the ghastly wrongs of Flanders.    And if men's prayers are heard, as many say, old saints will hear old  supplications going up by starlight with a certain wistful, musical  intonation that has linked the towns of Limerick and Cork with the  fields of Flanders before.          The Movement      For many years Eliphaz Griggs was comparatively silent. Not that he  did not talk on all occasions whenever he could find hearers, he did  that at great length; but for many years he addressed no public  meeting, and was no part of the normal life of the northeast end of  Hyde Park or Trafalgar Square. And then one day he was talking in a  public house where he had gone to talk on the only subject that was  dear to him. He waited, as was his custom, until five or six men were  present, and then he began. \"Ye're all damned, I'm saying, damned  from the day you were born. Your portion is Tophet.\"    And on that day there happened what had never happened in his  experience before. Men used to listen in a tolerant way, and say  little over their beer, for that is the English custom; and that would  be all. But to-day a man rose up with flashing eyes and went over to  Eliphaz and gripped him by the hand: \"They're all damned,\" said the  stranger.    That was the turning point in the life of Eliphaz. Up to that moment  he had been a lonely crank, and men thought he was queer; but now  there were two of them and he became a Movement. A Movement in England  may do what it likes: there was a Movement, before the War, for  spoiling tulips in Kew Gardens and breaking church windows; it had its  run like the rest.    The name of Eliphaz's new friend was Ezekiel Pim: and they drew up  rules for their Movement almost at once; and very soon country inns  knew Eliphaz no more. And for some while they missed him where he used  to drop in of an evening to tell them they were all damned: and then a  man proved one day that the earth was flat, and they all forgot  Eliphaz.    But Eliphaz went to Hyde Park and Ezekiel Pim went with him, and there  you would see them close to the Marble Arch on any fine Sunday  afternoon, preaching their Movement to the people of London. \"You are  all damned,\" said Eliphaz. \"Your portion shall be damnation for  everlasting.\"    \"All damned,\" added Ezekiel.    Eliphaz was the orator. He would picture Hell to you as it really is.  He made you see pretty much what it will be like to wriggle and turn  and squirm, and never escape from burning. But Ezekiel Pim, though he  seldom said more than three words, uttered those words with such  alarming sincerity and had such a sure conviction shining in his eyes  that searched right in your face as he said them, and his long hair  waved so weirdly as his head shot forward when he said \"You're all  damned,\" that Ezekiel Pim brought home to you that the vivid  descriptions of Eliphaz really applied to you.    People who lead bad lives get their sensibilities hardened. These did  not care very much what Eliphaz said. But girls at school, and several  governesses, and even some young clergy, were very much affected.  Eliphaz Griggs and Ezekiel Pim seemed to bring Hell so near to you.  You could almost feel it baking the Marble Arch from two to four on  Sundays. And at four o'clock the Surbiton Branch of the International  Anarchists used to come along, and Eliphaz Griggs and Ezekiel Pim  would pack up their flag and go, for the pitch belonged to the  Surbiton people till six; and the crank Movements punctiliously  recognize each other's rights. If they fought among themselves, which  is quite unthinkable, the police would run them in; it is the one  thing that an anarchist in England may never do.    When the War came the two speakers doubled their efforts. The way they  looked at it was that here was a counter-attraction taking people's  minds off the subject of their own damnation just as they had got them  to think about it. Eliphaz worked as he had never worked before; he  spared nobody; but it was still Ezekiel Pim who somehow brought it  most home to them.    One fine spring afternoon Eliphaz Griggs was speaking at his usual  place and time; he had wound himself up wonderfully. \"You are  damned,\" he was saying, \"for ever and ever and ever. Your sins have  found you out. Your filthy lives will be as fuel round you and shall  burn for ever and ever.\"    \"Look here,\" said a Canadian soldier in the crowd, \"we shouldn't  allow that in Ottawa.\"    \"What?\" asked an English girl.    \"Why, telling us we're all damned like that,\" he said.    \"Oh, this is England,\" she said. \"They may all say what they like  here.\"    \"You are all damned,\" said Ezekiel, jerking forward his head and  shoulders till his hair flapped out behind. \"All, all, all damned.\"    \"I'm damned if I am,\" said the Canadian soldier.    \"Ah,\" said Ezekiel, and a sly look came into his face.    Eliphaz flamed on. \"Your sins are remembered. Satan shall grin at  you. He shall heap cinders on you for ever and ever. Woe to you,  filthy livers. Woe to you, sinners. Hell is your portion. There shall  be none to grieve for you. You shall dwell in torment for ages. None  shall be spared, not one. Woe everlasting... Oh, I beg pardon,  gentlemen, I'm sure.\" For the Pacifists' League had been kept waiting  three minutes. It was their turn to-day at four.          Nature's Cad      The claim of Professor Grotius Jan Beek to have discovered, or  learned, the language of the greater apes has been demonstrated  clearly enough. He is not the original discoverer of the fact that  they have what may be said to correspond with a language; nor is he  the first man to have lived for some while in the jungle protected by  wooden bars, with a view to acquiring some knowledge of the meaning of  the various syllables that gorillas appear to utter. If so crude a  collection of sounds, amounting to less than a hundred words, if words  they are, may be called a language, it may be admitted that the  Professor has learned it, as his recent experiments show. What he has  not proved is his assertion that he has actually conversed with a  gorilla, or by signs, or grunts, or any means whatever obtained an  insight, as he put it, into its mentality, or, as we should put it,  its point of view. This Professor Beek claims to have done; and though  he gives us a certain plausible corroboration of a kind which makes  his story appear likely, it should be borne in mind that it is not of  the nature of proof.    The Professor's story is briefly that having acquired this language,  which nobody that has witnessed his experiments will call in question,  he went back to the jungle for a week, living all the time in the  ordinary explorer's cage of the Blik pattern. Towards the very end of  the week a big male gorilla came by, and the Professor attracted it by  the one word \"Food.\" It came, he says, close to the cage, and seemed  prepared to talk but became very angry on seeing a man there, and beat  the cage and would say nothing. The Professor says that he asked it  why it was angry. He admits that he had learned no more than forty  words of this language, but believes that there are perhaps thirty  more. Much however is expressed, as he says, by mere intonation.  Anger, for instance; and scores of allied words, such as terrible,  frightful, kill, whether noun, verb or adjective, are expressed, he  says, by a mere growl. Nor is there any word for \"Why,\" but queries  are signified by the inflexion of the voice.    When he asked it why it was angry the gorilla said that men killed  him, and added a noise that the professor said was evidently meant to  allude to guns. The only word used, he says, in this remark of the  gorilla's was the word that signified \"man.\" The sentence as  understood by the professor amounted to \"Man kill me. Guns.\" But the  word \"kill\" was represented simply by a snarl, \"me\" by slapping  its chest, and \"guns\" as I have explained was only represented by a  noise. The Professor believes that ultimately a word for guns may be  evolved out of that noise, but thinks that it will take many  centuries, and that if during that time guns should cease to be in  use, this stimulus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/572"],[0,"The Great Big Treasury of Beatrix Potter (#12)"],[1," a  mile off. He was of a wandering  habit and he had foxy whiskers;  they never knew where he would be  next.    One day he was living in a stick-  house in the coppice [grove], causing  terror to the family of old Mr.  Benjamin Bouncer. Next day he  moved into a pollard willow near  the lake, frightening the wild ducks  and the water rats.    In winter and early spring he  might generally be found in an  earth amongst the rocks at the top  of Bull Banks, under Oatmeal Crag.    He had half a dozen houses, but  he was seldom at home.    The houses were not always  empty when Mr. Tod moved OUT;  because sometimes Tommy Brock  moved IN; (without asking leave).    Tommy Brock was a short bristly  fat waddling person with a grin; he  grinned all over his face. He was  not nice in his habits. He ate wasp  nests and frogs and worms; and he  waddled about by moonlight, digging  things up.    His clothes were very dirty; and  as he slept in the daytime, he  always went to bed in his boots.  And the bed which he went to bed  in was generally Mr. Tod's.    Now Tommy Brock did occasionally  eat rabbit pie; but it was only  very little young ones occasionally,  when other food was really scarce.  He was friendly with old Mr.  Bouncer; they agreed in disliking  the wicked otters and Mr. Tod; they  often talked over that painful subject.    Old Mr. Bouncer was stricken in  years. He sat in the spring sunshine  outside the burrow, in a muffler;  smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco.    He lived with his son Benjamin  Bunny and his daughter-in-law  Flopsy, who had a young family.  Old Mr. Bouncer was in charge of  the family that afternoon, because  Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.    The little rabbit babies were just  old enough to open their blue eyes  and kick. They lay in a fluffy bed of  rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow  burrow, separate from the main  rabbit hole. To tell the truth--old  Mr. Bouncer had forgotten them.    He sat in the sun, and conversed  cordially with Tommy Brock, who  was passing through the wood with  a sack and a little spud which he  used for digging, and some mole  traps. He complained bitterly  about the scarcity of pheasants'  eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of  poaching them. And the otters had  cleared off all the frogs while he  was asleep in winter--\"I have not  had a good square meal for a fort-  night, I am living on pig-nuts. I  shall have to turn vegetarian and  eat my own tail!\" said Tommy  Brock.    It was not much of a joke, but it  tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because  Tommy Brock was so fat and  stumpy and grinning.    So old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and  pressed Tommy Brock to come inside,  to taste a slice of seed cake  and \"a glass of my daughter Flopsy's  cowslip wine.\" Tommy Brock  squeezed himself into the rabbit  hole with alacrity.    Then old Mr. Bouncer smoked  another pipe, and gave Tommy  Brock a cabbage leaf cigar which  was so very strong that it made  Tommy Brock grin more than ever;  and the smoke filled the burrow.  Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and  laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed  and grinned.    And Mr. Bouncer laughed and  coughed, and shut his eyes because  of the cabbage smoke ..........    When Flopsy and Benjamin came  back old Mr. Bouncer woke up.  Tommy Brock and all the young  rabbit babies had disappeared!    Mr. Bouncer would not confess  that he had admitted anybody into  the rabbit hole. But the smell of  badger was undeniable; and there  were round heavy footmarks in the  sand. He was in disgrace; Flopsy  wrung her ears, and slapped him.    Benjamin Bunny set off at once  after Tommy Brock.    There was not much difficulty in  tracking him; he had left his foot-  mark and gone slowly up the winding  footpath through the wood. Here he  had rooted up the moss and wood  sorrel. There he had dug quite a  deep hole for dog darnel; and had  set a mole trap. A little stream  crossed the way. Benjamin skipped  lightly over dry-foot; the badger's  heavy steps showed plainly in the mud.    The path led to a part of the  thicket where the trees had been  cleared; there were leafy oak  stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths  --but the smell that made Benjamin  stop was NOT the smell of flowers!    Mr. Tod's stick house was before  him; and, for once, Mr. Tod was at  home. There was not only a foxy  flavor in proof of it--there was  smoke coming out of the broken  pail that served as a chimney.    Benjamin Bunny sat up, staring,  his whiskers twitched. Inside the  stick house somebody dropped a  plate, and said something. Benjamin  stamped his foot, and bolted.    He never stopped till he came to  the other side of the wood. Apparently  Tommy Brock had turned the  same way. Upon the top of the wall  there were again the marks of    badger; and some ravellings of a  sack had caught on a briar.    Benjamin climbed over the wall,  into a meadow. He found another  mole trap newly set; he was still  upon the track of Tommy Brock. It  was getting late in the afternoon.  Other rabbits were coming out to  enjoy the evening air. One of them  in a blue coat, by himself, was busily  hunting for dandelions.--  \"Cousin Peter! Peter Rabbit, Peter  Rabbit!\" shouted Benjamin Bunny.    The blue coated rabbit sat up  with pricked ears--\"Whatever is  the matter, Cousin Benjamin? Is it  a cat? or John Stoat Ferret?\"    \"No, no, no! He's bagged my  family--Tommy Brock--in a sack  --have you seen him?\"    \"Tommy Brock? how many,  Cousin Benjamin?\"    \"Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of  them twins! Did he come this way?  Please tell me quick!\"    \"Yes, yes; not ten minutes since  ... he said they were CATERPILLARS;  I did think they were kicking rather  hard, for caterpillars.\"    \"Which way? which way has he  gone, Cousin Peter?\"    \"He had a sack with something  live in it; I watched him set a mole  trap. Let me use my mind, Cousin  Benjamin; tell me from the beginning,\"  Benjamin did so.    \"My Uncle Bouncer has displayed  a lamentable want of discretion for  his years;\" said Peter reflectively,  \"but there are two hopeful  circumstances. Your family is alive and  kicking; and Tommy Brock has had  refreshments. He will probably go  to sleep, and keep them for breakfast.\"  \"Which way?\" \"Cousin Benjamin,  compose yourself. I know  very well which way. Because Mr.  Tod was at home in the stick house  he has gone to Mr. Tod's other  house, at the top of Bull Banks. I  partly know, because he offered to  leave any message at Sister Cottontail's;  he said he would be passing.\"  (Cottontail had married a black  rabbit, and gone to live on the hill.)    Peter hid his dandelions, and  accompanied the afflicted parent,  who was all of atwitter. They  crossed several fields and began to  climb the hill; the tracks of Tommy  Brock were plainly to be seen. He  seemed to have put down the sack  every dozen yards, to rest.    \"He must be very puffed; we are  close behind him, by the scent.  What a nasty person!\" said Peter.    The sunshine was still warm and  slanting on the hill pastures. Half  way up, Cottontail was sitting in  her doorway, with four or five half-  grown little rabbits playing about  her; one black and the others  brown.    Cottontail had seen Tommy  Brock passing in the distance.  Asked whether her husband was at  home she replied that Tommy  Brock had rested twice while she  watched him.    He had nodded, and pointed to  the sack, and seemed doubled up  with laughing.--\"Come away,  Peter; he will be cooking them;  come quicker!\" said Benjamin  Bunny.    They climbed up and up;--\"He  was at home; I saw his black ears  peeping out of the hole.\" \"They live  too near the rocks to quarrel with  their neighbors. Come on, Cousin  Benjamin!\"    When they came near the wood  at the top of Bull Banks, they went  cautiously. The trees grew amongst  heaped up rocks; and there,  beneath a crag, Mr. Tod had made  one of his homes. It was at the top  of a steep bank; the rocks and  bushes overhung it. The rabbits  crept up carefully, listening and  peeping.    This house was something between  a cave, a prison, and a tumbledown  pigsty. There was a strong  door, which was shut and locked.    The setting sun made the window  panes glow like red flame; but  the kitchen fire was not alight. It  was neatly laid with dry sticks, as  the rabbits could see, when they  peeped through the window.    Benjamin sighed with relief.    But there were preparations  upon the kitchen table which made  him shudder. There was an immense  empty pie dish of blue willow  pattern, and a large carving  knife and fork, and a chopper.    At the other end of the table was  a partly unfolded tablecloth, a  plate, a tumbler, a knife and fork,  salt cellar, mustard and a chair--  in short, preparations for one  person's supper.    No person was to be seen, and  no young rabbits. The kitchen was  empty and silent; the clock had run  down. Peter and Benjamin flattened  their noses against the window,  and stared into the dusk.    Then they scrambled round the  rocks to the other side of the house.  It was damp and smelly, and over-  grown with thorns and briars.    The rabbits shivered in their  shoes.    \"Oh my poor rabbit babies!  What a dreadful place; I shall never  see them again!\" sighed Benjamin.    They crept up to the bedroom  window. It was closed and bolted  like the kitchen. But there were  signs that this window had been  recently open; the cobwebs were  disturbed, and there were fresh dirty  footmarks upon the windowsill.    The room inside was so dark that  at first they could make out nothing;  but they could hear a noise--a  slow deep regular snoring grunt.  And as their eyes became accustomed  to the darkness, they perceived  that somebody was asleep  on Mr. Tod's bed, curled up under  the blanket.--\"He has gone to bed  in his boots,\" whispered Peter.    Benjamin, who was all of atwitter,  pulled Peter off the windowsill.      Tommy Brock's snores continued,  grunty and regular from Mr.  Tod's bed. Nothing could be seen of  the "]]]
