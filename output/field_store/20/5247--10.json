To  make it more favorable the obstruction, as has been said, lay on the  right, or outside rail.    Had it been on the opposite one all would have been changed to a terrible  certainty.    There was no cowcatcher in front, similar to those seen on the engines in  this country, but there was a heavy iron fender in its stead, which  presented a square defense. This bar would strike the rock below  midweight, and in such an oblique manner that he believed the barrier  would be hurled from the track without derailing the engine.    Jack understood that he was taking a fearful risk, but with all these  favoring circumstances it could not be more disastrous than to stop and to  fall easy victims to the bush-raiders and their allies.    These thoughts flashed through his mind and he resolved to keep on at all  hazards. Thus he let on all the steam in reserve and stood grimly at his  post.    The engine obeyed like a living creature. It gave a mighty plunge forward  and dashed upon the ponderous barrier disputing its advance.    The suspense was of brief duration, but Jack's thoughts flew fast and far.  He realized that if the engine failed to clear the track it would be all  over with him in a moment.    He was thinking of Jenny when the shock came with a force which fairly  lifted the heavy engine! A crash and another shock threw him face downward  on the floor of the cab.    He felt that the crisis had been passed and the train was still rushing  on. Furious yells--yells that made the wildwoods ring with their  intonations--filed his ears, and a volley of bullets whistled around his  head.    He looked up and saw the trees rushing past him at a terrific speed.    A backward glance showed him some of the outlaws beside the track, while  others were scattered on both side of the rails, where the engine had  flung them in heaps.    At the bottom of the valley lay the big bowlder, which had been dislodged  and hurled into the depths.    The front of the engine showed the marks of its fearful blow, and he began  to realize more fully the awful risk he had taken.    The firing from the rear car had ceased, and wondering what had become of  Plum Plucky, he pulled the bell cord once.    A prompt response was given by two violent jerks on the rope, when he knew  that Plum was alive and on the train.    He did not have long to wait before he heard some one crawling over the  tender, and a moment later his fireman dropped beside him.    \"Golly, Jack!\" exclaimed Plum, \"wasn't that a squeezer?\"    \"What have you done?\" asked Jack.    \"We've got 'em!\" beginning to execute a dance on the footboard.    \"What do you mean? Have you lost your senses?\"    \"I mean we've got the traitors as tight as a squirrel in a box-trap. Some  of 'em jumped off and were killed, but we've got the most of 'em, and  Pedro is holding 'em there fast.\"    The train had slowed so the two could talk as they continued on.    \"I don't understand you, Plum,\" said Jack, ready to believe almost  anything after what he had passed through.    \"Well, yeou see I just played a Yankee trick on 'em. Just as I had got  back to Pedro, and before I could tell him what to do, some of the men  come out of the car, and I see they were going to uncouple it just as you  had told me to! By that I knew some trick was up, and before they could  tell what had struck 'em I pushed the sinners back into the car and shut  the door. No sooner had I done that than I covered 'em with my gun and  asked Pedro to help me. In the midst of it there came that awful chuck,  when I thought for a minute we'd all gone together. But it was soon over,  and Perdo is standing guard over our prisoners. As I said some of 'em  jumped off, but I guess they won't jump ag'in. Do yeou s'pose the trouble  is over?\"    At first Jack could scarcely believe the other's story, but he saw that  his excited companion was in earnest.    \"It was a fearful moment, Plum, and we should be thankful that we came out  alive. I think we have learned the raiders a lesson they won't forget. It  will be best to try and get your prisoners to Resaca.\"    It would not do to stop the train or even check its speed, as the  prisoners would be sure to take advantage of the situation. Thus Jack was  obliged to keep a sharp lookout and crowd the old engine on as fast as he  could with any degree of safety.    No further adventure befalling them, Jack and Plum at last had the  satisfaction of reaching Resaca. Never was there greater surprise in town  than when this train came into the station and the true situation became  known.    Officers were called to take charge of the prisoners in the car, but as  nothing could be proved against them, except what Jack and Plum stated,  and as their evidence was immediately discredited, the whole party went  free, vowing vengeance against their captors.    Jack saw that, on account of their being foreigners, they had really lost  favor by the capture, and he was glad to get clear so easily. After this  they ran a week without interference, not a solitary bush-raider having  been seen. Evidently the survivors had learned a lesson not to be quickly  forgotten.    Of course our hero and Plum received a few praises for their success in  getting the train through as they had, but it was evident to both that  they could not get full credit for whatever they might do. In fact it was  difficult for them to get acknowledgment for doing an ordinary duty.    This was due to the fact that they were foreigners and looked upon with  suspicion, no matter what they did.    Jack was not therefore much surprised when one day, as he was stepping  upon his engine at St. Resa, to have a bright-buttoned official stop him  and motion for another man to take charge of the locomotive.    This new arrival was a Peruvian, and the boy engineer was not long in  learning that he was willing to work for twelve pistoles a month.  Though  smarting under this unfair treatment, Jack offered no objections as he  stepped aside. The war with Chili was assuming more alarming proportions,  and he foresaw that troublesome times were near at hand.    Plum Plucky, upon finding that he was going to have a new master, jumped  down from the cab, exclaiming:    \"You can't have my valuable services if you turn off Jack North!\"    This was a turn in affairs the officials had not looked for, but the boys  did not stop to listen to their protestations.    Later they learned that the train did not make a run that day.          Chapter XV    The Treasure Island        \"Now,\" said Plum, as soon as he joined his friend, \"I call that about the  meanest trick I ever see played on a feller. Of course I wasn't going to  stay to fire for that weazen-faced son of old Piz-arro.\"    \"It seems too bad you should lose your job on my account, Plum.  Particularly when I am more than half glad to lose mine, while you have  made a real sacrifice.\"    \"Oh, carrots! I ain't any worse off than I was before. But what are you  going to do, Jack?\"    \"I am going to speculating.\"    \"What!\" in amazement.    \"Speculating, Plum. I have been thinking several days of a scheme in which  I believe there is more money than in running an engine for bush-raiders  to run down.\"    \"I'll bet you're going to speculate in that dirt I put round the don's  plants.\"    \"You got it right the first time, Plum. I--\"    \"Ginger! going to raise coffee? 'Cause of you air I can give you a  pointer.\"    \"No; you are on the wrong track now. But I have no objection to telling  you. Ever since I saw the result of your experiment I have been thinking  that the stuff would sell like hot cakes in our own country, in places  where the land is worn out and needs some such a stimulant. At any rate I  am going to send home a cargo and see what comes of it.\"    \"Hooray! I see it all now. It may pay, but I doubt it. How air you going  to get the stuff there?\"    \"In the first place I have got to get possession of the article itself,  though I do not believe this will be a very expensive undertaking. I have  a few dollars I have saved up from my wages, and I think I can borrow some  somewhere. I am going to buy one of the nitrate tracts as soon as I can  get suited.\"    \"You can buy a big mine for a hundred dollars, 'cause they're looked on  with disfavor. But after you've bought one, what then?\"    \"I am going to team a cargo to the nearest port and then charter a ship to  take it home.\"    \"You're smart enough to be a general, Jack North,\" and having paid him the  highest compliment that he could, according to his estimate, Plum added:    \"Say, Jack, I want to drive the team for you.\"    \"You shall. But, as I am anxious to begin operations, I am going to look  for my first purchase.\"    \"Don de Estuaray is the man you want to see. There is a big bed on his  estancia.\"    \"It seems to me your experiment may have opened his eyes.    \"He may catch onto my scheme quicker than some one who has seen nothing of  what this nitrate will do.\"    \"Of course you're right and I'm a blockhead, as usual. But go ahead and  I'll tag at your heels like a dog.\"    Jack's first move was to get a couple of ponies for himself and Plum to  ride. Then the pair, with provisions enough to last several days, set out  on their quest.    Taking the direction of what he believed to be the heart of the nitrate  region, Jack in a couple of days found several beds which he felt would  prove rich fields of speculation.    His prime object was to find a bed which should not be too far removed  from the railroad, or at least where its product could be the easiest  teamed.    It was during his search one day that he got separated from his companion,  in his desire to explore a wider stretch of country, when he quite  unexpectedly found himself in the vicinity of his adventure with the  jaguars.    The memory"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#12)"],[1,"up to her knee and looked, herself, at the  stocking - \"they are nice stockings, but they're too good for me,  really.\"            She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on K.'s as if  she wanted to calm him down, and whispered, \"Be quiet, Berthold is  watching us.\"  K. slowly looked up.  In the doorway to the courtroom  stood a young man, he was short, his legs were not quite straight, and  he continually moved his finger round in a short, thin, red beard with  which he hoped to make himself look dignified.  K. looked at him with  some curiosity, he was the first student he had ever met of the  unfamiliar discipline of jurisprudence, face to face at least, a man who  would even most likely attain high office one day.  The student, in  contrast, seemed to take no notice of K. at all, he merely withdrew his  finger from his beard long enough to beckon to the woman and went over  to the window, the woman leant over to K. and whispered, \"Don't be cross  with me, please don't, and please don't think ill of me either, I've got  to go to him now, to this horrible man, just look at his bent legs.  But  I'll come straight back and then I'll go with you if you'll take me,  I'll go wherever you want, you can do whatever you like with me, I'll be  happy if I can be away from here for as long as possible, it'd be best  if I could get away from here for good.\"  She stroked K.'s hand once  more, jumped up and ran over to the window.  Before he realised it, K.  grasped for her hand but failed to catch it.   He really was attracted  to the woman, and even after thinking hard about it could find no good  reason why he should not give in to her allure.  It briefly crossed his  mind that the woman meant to entrap him on behalf of the court, but that  was an objection he had no difficulty in fending off.  In what way could  she entrap him?  Was he not still free, so free that he could crush the  entire court whenever he wanted, as least where it concerned him?  Could  he not have that much confidence in himself?  And her offer of help  sounded sincere, and maybe it wasn't quite worthless.  And maybe there  was no better revenge against the examining judge and his cronies than  to take this woman from him and have her for himself.  Maybe then, after  much hard work writing dishonest reports about K., the judge would go to  the woman's bed late one night and find it empty.  And it would be empty  because she belonged to K., because this woman at the window, this lush,  supple, warm body in its sombre clothes of rough, heavy material  belonged to him, totally to him and to him alone.  Once he had settled  his thoughts towards the woman in this way, he began to find the quiet  conversation at the window was taking too long, he rapped on the podium  with his knuckles, and then even with his fist.  The student briefly  looked away from the woman to glance at K. over his shoulder but did  allow himself to be disturbed, in fact he even pressed himself close to  the woman and put his arms around her.  She dropped her head down low as  if listening to him carefully, as she did so he kissed her right on the  neck, hardly even interrupting what he was saying.   K. saw this as  confirmation of the tyranny the student held over the woman and which  she had already complained about, he stood up and walked up and down the  room.  Glancing sideways at the student, he wondered what would be the  quickest possible way to get rid of him, and so it was not unwelcome to  him when the student, clearly disturbed by K.'s to-ing and fro-ing which  K. had now developed into a stamping up and down, said to him,  \"You don't have to stay here, you know, if you're getting impatient.  You could have gone earlier, no-one would have missed you.  In fact you  should have gone, you should have left as quickly as possible as soon as  I got here.\"  This comment could have caused all possible rage to break  out between them, but K. also bore in mind that this was a prospective  court official speaking to a disfavoured defendant, and he might well  have been taking pride in speaking in this way.  K. remained standing  quite close to him and said with a smile, \"You're quite right, I am  impatient, but the easiest way to settle this impatience would be if you  left us.  On the other hand, if you've come here to study - you are a  student, I hear - I'll be quite happy to leave the room to you and go  away with the woman.  I'm sure you'll still have a lot of study to do  before you're made into a judge.  It's true that I'm still not all that  familiar with your branch of jurisprudence but I take it it involves a  lot more than speaking roughly - and I see you have no shame in doing  that extremely well.\"  \"He shouldn't have been allowed to move about so  freely,\" said the student, as if he wanted to give the woman an  explanation for K.'s insults, \"that was a mistake.  I've told the  examining judge so.  He should at least have been detained in his room  between hearings.  Sometimes it's impossible to understand what the  judge thinks he's doing.\"  \"You're wasting your breath,\" said K., then he reached his hand out  towards the woman and said, \"come with me.\"  \"So that's it,\" said the  student, \"oh no, you're not going to get her,\" and with a strength you  would not have expected from him, he glanced tenderly at her, lifted her  up on one arm and, his back bent under the weight, ran with her to the  door.  In this way he showed, unmistakeably, that he was to some extent  afraid of K., but he nonetheless dared to provoke him still further by  stroking and squeezing the woman's arm with his free hand.  K. ran the  few steps up to him, but when he had reached him and was about to take  hold of him and, if necessary, throttle him, the woman said, \"It's no  good, it's the examining judge who's sent for me, I daren't go with you,  this little bastard...\" and here she ran her hand over the student's  face, \"this little bastard won't let me.\"  \"And you don't want to be set  free!\" shouted K., laying his hand on the student's shoulder, who then  snapped at it with his teeth.  \"No!\" shouted the woman, pushing K. away  with both hands, \"no, no don't do that, what d'you think you're doing!?  That'd be the end of me.  Let go of him, please just let go of him.  He's only carrying out the judge's orders, he's carrying me to him.\"  \"Let him take you then, and I want to see nothing more of you,\" said K.,  enraged by his disappointment and giving the student a thump in the back  so that he briefly stumbled and then, glad that he had not fallen,  immediately jumped up all the higher with his burden.  K. followed them  slowly.  He realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he had  suffered from these people.  It was of course nothing to worry about, he  accepted the setback only because he was looking for a fight.  If he  stayed at home and carried on with his normal life he would be a  thousand times superior to these people and could get any of them out of  his way just with a kick.  And he imagined the most laughable scene  possible as an example of this, if this contemptible student, this  inflated child, this knock-kneed redbeard, if he were kneeling at Elsa's  bed wringing his hands and begging for forgiveness.  K. so enjoyed  imagining this scene that he decided to take the student along to Elsa  with him if ever he should get the opportunity.            K. was curious to see where the woman would be taken and he  hurried over to the door, the student was not likely to carry her  through the streets on his arm.  It turned out that the journey was far  shorter.  Directly opposite the flat there was a narrow flight of wooden  steps which probably led up to the attic, they turned as they went so  that it was not possible to see where they ended.  The student carried  the woman up these steps, and after the exertions of running with her he  was soon groaning and moving very slowly.  The woman waved down at K.  and by raising and lowering her shoulders she tried to show that she was  an innocent party in this abduction, although the gesture did not show a  lot of regret.  K. watched her without expression like a stranger, he  wanted to show neither that he was disappointed nor that he would easily  get over his disappointment.            The two of them had disappeared, but K. remained standing in the  doorway.  He had to accept that the woman had not only cheated him but  that she had also lied to him when she said she was being taken to the  examining judge.  The examining judge certainly wouldn't be sitting and  waiting in the attic.  The wooden stairs would explain nothing to him  however long he stared at them.  Then K. noticed a small piece of paper  next to them, went across to it and read, in a childish and unpractised  hand, \"Entrance to the Court Offices\".  Were the court offices here, in  the attic of this tenement, then?  If that was how they were  accommodated it did not attract much respect, and it was some comfort  for the accused to realise how little money this court had at its  disposal if it had to locate its offices in a place where the tenants of  the building, who were themselves among the poorest of people, would  throw their unneeded junk.  On the other hand, it was possible that the  officials  had enough money but that they squandered it on themselves  rather than use it for the court's purposes.  Going by K.'s experience  of them so far, that even seemed probable, except that if the court were  allowed to decay in that way it would not just humiliate the accused but  also give him more encouragement than if the court were simply  in a  state of poverty.  K. also now understood that the court was ashamed to  summon those it accused to the attic of this building for the initial  hearing, and why it preferred to impose upon them in their own homes.  What a position it was that K. found himself in, compared with the judge  sitting up in the"]]]
