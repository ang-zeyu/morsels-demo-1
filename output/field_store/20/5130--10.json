Included are the extraordinary receipts from  the disposal of surplus property.    As a result, estimated expenditures will exceed estimated receipts by 4.3  billion dollars. This amount can be provided by a reduction in the cash  balance in the Treasury. Thus, after a long period of increasing public  debt resulting from depression budgets and war budgets, it is anticipated  that no increase in the Federal debt will be required next year.    FEDERAL BUDGET EXPENDITURES AND BUDGET RECEIPTS    Including net outlays of Government corporations and credit agencies (based  on existing and proposed legislation)    Fiscal year    Expenditures: 1946 1947    Defense, war, and war liquidation $49,000 $15,000    Aftermath of war: Veterans, interest, refunds 10,813 10,793    International finance (including proposed legislation) 2,614 2,754    Other activities 4,552 5,813    Activities based on proposed legislation    (excluding international finance) 2501,500    Total expenditures 67, 229 35, 860    Receipts (net) 38, 60931,513    Excess of expenditures 28,620 4,347    The current fiscal year, 1946, is a year of transition. When the year  opened, in July 1945, we were still fighting a major war, and Federal  expenditures were running at an annual rate of about 100 billion dollars.  By June 1946 that rate will be more than cut in half. The Budget total for  the current fiscal year is now estimated at 67.2 billion dollars, of which  more than two-thirds provides for war and war liquidation. Since net  receipts are estimated at 38.6 billion dollars, there will be an excess of  expenditures of 28.6 billion dollars for the current fiscal year.    For all programs discussed in this Message I estimate the total of Budget  appropriations and authorizations (including reappropriations and permanent  appropriations) at 30,982 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947. Of this  amount, present permanent appropriations are expected to provide 5,755  million dollars, principally for interest. This leaves 24,224 million  dollars to be made available through new appropriations, exclusive of  appropriations to liquidate contract authorizations; 900 million dollars in  new contract authorizations; and 103 million dollars through the  reappropriation of unliquidated balances of previous appropriations. The  appropriations needed to liquidate contract authorizations are estimated at  1,113 million dollars.    In the Budget for the year ahead only over-all estimates are included at  this time for the major war agencies and for net outlays of Government  corporations. Detailed recommendations will be transmitted in the spring  for the war agencies; and the business-type budgets of Government  corporations will likewise be transmitted in accordance with the recently  adopted Government Corporation Control Act.    Similarly, only over-all estimates are provided for new programs  recommended in this Message; detailed recommendations will be transmitted  after authorizing legislation has been enacted. It should be recognized  that many of the estimates for new programs recommended in this Message are  initial year figures. These figures will be affected by the date the  legislation is enacted and by the time needed for getting a program under  way. New programs, such as that for a national research agency, will  require larger amounts in later years. The estimates exclude major elements  of the proposed national health program since the greater part of these  will be covered by expenditures from trust funds.    The Budget total includes expenditures for capital outlay as well as for  current operations. An estimated 1,740 million dollars will be expended in  the fiscal year 1947 for direct Federal public works and for loans and  grants for public works.    THE ECONOMIC IMPACT Of THE LIQUIDATION    OF THE WAR PROGRAM    Government programs are of such importance in the development of production  and employment opportunities--domestic and international--that it has  become essential to formulate and consider the Federal Budget in the light  of the Nation's budget as a whole. The relationship between the receipts,  expenditures, and savings of consumers, business, and government is shown  in the accompanying table.    Considering the whole Nation, total expenditures must equal the total  receipts, because what any individual or group spends becomes receipts of  other individuals or groups. Such equality can be achieved on either a high  level of incomes or on a low or depression level of incomes.    Tremendous orders for munitions during the war shifted production and  employment into high gear. Total goods produced and services rendered for  private as well as for Government purposes--the Nation's budget-reached  about 200 billion dollars in the calendar year 1944. Federal, State, and  local government expenditures represented half of this total.    Corresponding estimates for the past 3 months depict the national economy  in the process of demobilization and reconversion.    The wartime annual rate of Federal expenditures has been reduced by 32  billion dollars, while the Nation's budget total has dropped only half as  much. The drop in total value of production and services has been less  drastic because increasing private activities have absorbed in large  measure the manpower and materials released from war production and war  services.    The largest increase in private activities has occurred in business  investments, which include residential and other construction, producers'  durable equipment, accumulation of inventories, and net exports. Under  conditions of global war, expenditures for private construction and  equipment were held to a minimum and inventories were depleted. With the  beginning of reconversion these developments have been reversed.  Residential construction and outlays for plant and equipment are on the  increase; inventories, too, are being replenished. International  transactions (excluding lend-lease and international relief which are  included under war expenditures) showed an import surplus under conditions  of global war. In the past 3 months private exports have been slightly in  excess of imports, for the first time since 1941.    Consumers' budgets show a significant change. On the income side, their  total has declined but little because the reduction in \"take-home\" pay of  war workers is, to a large extent, offset for the time being by the  mustering-out payments received by war veterans and by unemployment  compensation received by the unemployed. On the expenditure side, however,  consumers' budgets, restricted during the war, have in creased  substantially as a result of the fact that scarce goods are beginning to  appear on the market and wartime restraints are disappearing. Thus,  consumers' current savings are declining substantially from the  extraordinarily high wartime rate and some wartime savings are beginning to  be used for long-delayed purchases.

Unemployment has increased less than was expected during this first period  of demobilization and reconversion. It is true that 6 million men and women  have been discharged from the armed forces since May 1945 and more than 5  million have been laid off from war work. On the other hand, more than a  million civilians have been enlisted in the armed forces, a considerable  number of war veterans have not immediately sought jobs, and many war  workers, especially women, have withdrawn from the labor force. In  addition, many industries, and especially service trades which were  undermanned during the war, are beginning now, for the first time in years,  to recruit an adequate labor force. The reduced workweek has also  contributed to the absorption of those released from war service and war  work.    In general, the drastic cut in war programs has thrown the economy into  lower gear; it has not thrown it out of gear. Our economic machine  demonstrates remarkable resiliency, although there are many difficulties  that must still be overcome.

In the reclamation of the arid  west, the permanent establishment of prosperous communities in the  desert wilds, and for their unity, strength, and industrial and  temporal independence, the \"Mormon\" people are today the marvel, if  not the admiration of the thinking world. They came here with nothing  but the good will of God. They began in poverty, and \"having almost  nothing to invest,\" says Mr. William E. Symthe in _The Conquest of  Arid America_, \"except the labor of their hands and brains, and that  all they have expended in a period of fifty years for all classes of  improvements--from the first shanty to the last turret of the last  temple--came primarily from the soil.\"    Again he says in the same work:      TESTIMONY OF MR. SMYTHE        Nowhere else has the common prosperity been reared upon firmer      foundations. Nowhere else are institutions more firmly buttressed      or better capable of resisting violent economic revolutions. The      thunder cloud that passed over the land in 1893, leaving a path of      commercial ruin from the Atlantic to the Pacific, was powerless to      close the door of a single Mormon store, factory or bank. Strong      in prosperity, the co-operative industrial and commercial system      stood immovable in the hour of widespread disaster. The solvency      of these industries is scarcely more striking than the solvency      of the farmers from whom they draw their strength. No other      governor, either in the West or in the East, is able to say what      the Honorable Heber M. Wells said in assuming the chief magistracy      of the new state in January, 1896, \"We have in Utah,\" said the      young governor. \"19,816 farms, and 17,584 of them are absolutely      free from incumbrance.\" A higher percentage in school attendance      and lower percentage of illiterates than even in the State of      Massachusetts, is another of Utah's proud records. P. 71.      THE GUIDANCE OF JEHOVAH    Without the divine guidance and the constant watchcare of Jehovah  over the destinies of the \"Mormon\" pioneers, with Brigham Young at  their head, the West today would be but a barren wilderness. Under the  leadership of Brigham Young the \"Mormon\" people prospered, and he left  them in a better condition temporally and physically, and spiritually  more united and more firmly established in the faith than they ever  were before. Where among the so-called \"factions\" can you point to  one that has accomplished the hundredth part of what the followers of  Brigham Young have accomplished? They have all practically disappeared  but one--gone to their destruction. And the one that remains will  dissolve and disappear as surely as the sun shines. You cannot fight  the work of God and prosper.      WILLIAM MARKS    The testimony of William Marks--a man who was out of harmony with the  Prophet before the latter's death! This testimony of William Marks  sounds too suspicious, given as it was, when it was, and describing an  alleged conversation which never could have taken place. \"The reader  will please notice,\" said David Whitmer in his _Address_ (p. 41), \"this  fact in regard to William Marks' statement; and that is, the time when  Brother Joseph told him that polygamy must be put down in the Church.\"  That time was a \"few days\" before the Prophet's death.    True, the Prophet was no \"fool\" (_Herald_ 51:74), and such a  \"conversation\" as this related by William Marks would have stamped him  \"foolish, irrational and a moral suicide,\" _because_ he could not bring  a charge against others for that for which he was himself responsible.  The Prophet had plural wives, and had officiated in the ceremony of the  sealing of plural wives to others. I have conversed with the principals  in these cases, and know that they told the truth. Furthermore, Mr.  Marks' testimony condemns itself. He proves--if he proves anything at  all--that the Prophet was responsible for this doctrine. This thought  is in harmony with the early teachings of the original elders of the  Reorganization, for the time was when even your elders acknowledged  that the Prophet received the revelation on celestial (including  plural) marriage. On this point David Whitmer says:        As time rolled on, many of the Reorganization saw that to      _continue_ to acknowledge that Brother Joseph received the      revelation would bring bitter persecution upon themselves, as the      public feeling at that time was very bitter. * * * The leaders      of the Reorganized church, after a time, began to suppress their      opinions concerning this matter. They would answer the question      when asked about it \"_I do not know whether Joseph Smith received      the revelation or not_.\"      THE \"SAINTS' HERALD\" A WITNESS OF \"POLYGAMY\"    Now, if it is true--and I claim it is--that the leaders of the  Reorganized church acknowledged that the Prophet received the  revelation and practiced that principle, there must be some proof. Turn  to the first volume of the _True L.D.S. Herald_ and read the editorial  on pages 6 to 11. It is on polygamy. After trying to explain the reason  why the Prophet taught and practiced this doctrine, the editor said:        And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I, the      Lord, have deceived the prophet, and I will stretch out my hand      upon him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. *      * * We have here the facts as they have transpired and as they will      continue to transpire in relation to this subject. The death of the      prophet is one fact that has been realized, although he abhorred      and repented of this iniquity before his death. Page 9.    And on page 27:        He (Joseph Smith) caused the Revelation to be burned, and when      he voluntarily came to Nauvoo and resigned himself into the arms      of his enemies, he said that he was going to Carthage to die. At      that time he also said that if it had not been for that accursed      spiritual wife doctrine, he would not have come to that. By his      conduct at that time he proved the sincerity of his repentance,      and of his profession as a prophet. If Abraham[4] and Jacob, by      repentance, can obtain salvation and exaltation, so can Joseph      Smith.    Mark you, we have the evidence of the revelation from your own side and  you well remember that but _one_ could and did receive revelations. I  do not accept the apology of your editor; I do not believe that the  Prophet had the revelation burned, or called the doctrine accursed. My  faith in Joseph Smith is such that if he had the revelation--which your  witnesses declare he did--that it was from God as much as any other  revelation he received!      TESTIMONY OF JASON BRIGGS    Jason W. Briggs, one of the founders of your church, in the Temple Lot  suit, said:        I heard something about a revelation on polygamy, or plural      marriage, when I was in Nauvoo, in 1842. I heard there was one:      there was talk going on about it at that time, and continued to be;      but it was not called plural marriage; it was called sealing.        You ask me what I understood this sealing to be, at the time the      talk was going on. What I understood it to be was sealing a woman      to a man to be his wife, to be his wife hereafter, his wife in the      spirit world.        I was asked in my direct examination if I did not hear of the      doctrine of polygamy, etc., and I answered that I talked with      members with reference to sealing, and I understood that the      doctrine of sealing, was for eternity; it was sealing a man's wife      to him for eternity, or wives, either. Record pp. 349, 431, 505.      TESTIMONY OF JAMES WHITEHEAD    James Whitehead said:        There was an ordinance in the Church for sealing, as early as 1842      or 1843.        They would be married according to the law of God, not only for      time but for eternity as well.    These men were among the founders of your church.      SIDNEY RIGDON'S TESTIMONY    Sidney Rigdon, in a lengthy letter to his official paper, _The  Messenger and Advocate_, in 1845 declared that the Prophet was  responsible for the plural marriage doctrine, and said:        This system was introduced by the Smiths some time before their      death, and was the thing which put them in the power of their      enemies, and was the immediate cause of their death. P. 475, vol. 2.    He says he \"warned Joseph Smith and his family,\" and told them that  destruction would come upon them if they continued in their course.      ORIGINAL RECORDS OF PLURALITY OF WIVES    You \"confidently affirm that there is not a single word in a single  sermon, lecture, statement, newspaper or Church publication _printed_  during the life of Joseph Smith, wherein he by word has endorsed the  doctrine of plurality of wives, not a single statement.\" Whether any  such statement was ever _printed_ in his lifetime or not I am not  prepared to say. But I do know of such evidence being recorded during  his lifetime, for I have seen it.    I have copied the following from the Prophet's manuscript record of  Oct. 5, 1843, and know it is genuine:        \"Gave instructions to try those persons who were preaching,      teaching or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives; for      according to the law, I hold the keys of this power in the last      days; for there is never but one on earth at a time on whom this      power and its keys are conferred; and I have constantly said no      man shall have but one wife at a time unless the Lord directs      otherwise.\"    There is also at the Historian's office in this city, a Bible, which  I have before me, containing the record of the marriage of Melissa  Lott to the Prophet Joseph Smith, which was recorded at"]]]
