After unusually rough weather in the Mediterranean  and off the coast of Spain, we landed at Southampton, on March 9th,  at 9 P.M., and went on to London next morning.                CHAPTER VI.        Return to India--Attached to Foreign Office--Imperial assemblage at      Delhi--Almorah--Appointed to Manipur--Journey to Shillong--Cherra      Poojee--Colonel McCulloch--Question of ceremony.      Malaria, and all the evils that follow in its train, are more easily  acquired than got rid of. Possibly two years in England, including  four visits to Carlsbad, which high medical authorities seem to  consider, and very justly, a sine qua non, might give a man a good  chance if he never again visited a malarious district, otherwise,  my own experience shows me that two years are nothing. Every time I  have gone before a Medical Board in London, preparatory to returning  to duty, their last charge has been, \"You must never again go to  a malarious district!\" Medical Boards propose, and Government and  circumstances dispose.    I stayed at home in a high and healthy part of the Midlands, and left  for India again in October. I arrived in Calcutta in November, where  I again suffered from malarious symptoms; but I soon got better,  and was attached to the Foreign Office, at my own request, extra  attaches being required for the Imperial Assemblage.    I had the good fortune to see the whole of that gorgeous pageant,  the like of which this generation will probably never witness again,  under the most favourable auspices; and though I had on an average  eighteen hours' work out of each twenty-four, I was well repaid by  being able to take part in it. I met many old friends, and also became  acquainted with Salar Jung, Maharajahs Scindiah and Holkar, Sir Dinkur  Rao, Madhava Rao, and several other now historical celebrities. The  Viceroy's reception-tent at night was a grand sight, filled with  gallant soldiers, European and native, and great statesmen.    Among the new arrivals was the Khan of Khelat, an intelligent but  savage-looking chief, with eyes all about him. I was being constantly  deputed to carry polite messages from the Viceroy to different chiefs  and celebrities and to meet them at the railway stations. Among those  whom I met were the envoy from the Chief of Muscat, also the Siamese  Ambassador and his suite, a highly intelligent and sensible set of  men. I remember well the rough-and-ready way in which the younger  Siamese officers looked after their luggage and effects. They were  provided with a handsome set of tents, and all dined together at  one table in European fashion, in the most civilised way, with the  British officer attached to them.    I stayed at Delhi till the assemblage broke up, and after a few days  in Calcutta with the Foreign Office, went to Bombay to meet my wife,  who, with our two boys, arrived there on February 2nd. We at once set  out on our way to Almorah in the Himalayas, where I was permitted to  reside for a year and compile Foreign Office records.    We were delayed at Moradabad for a few days, as the passes were covered  with snow. At last we started, and found Nynee Tal deep in snow, and  the lake frozen. Next day we marched across the track of an avalanche,  and the following afternoon reached the Almorah Dak Bungalow, or  rest house. The ground was covered with snow, and the cold intense,  the bungalow draughty and very uncomfortable. After a few days we got  into a house, which Sir H. Ramsey, who was then out on duty in the  district, had kindly taken for us, and I dived deep into my records,  consisting of early documents relating to Assam and the Singpho tribes.    As the weather grew warmer, Almorah became very pleasant. I pined  for active work, but our stay here gave my wife experience in the  mode of life in India, for which she was afterwards very thankful,  and she obtained hints on housekeeping subjects from other ladies,  which were a help to her later on. Life in the Naga Hills was of  course very different to what it is in more civilised parts of India.    The Foreign Office had my name down in their list for an appointment. I  could have gone to Manipur when I landed in Calcutta, but was not  well enough. In July, I had a telegram to say that Lieut. Durand,  who had lately been appointed, was ill, and must be relieved. Would  I go? I at once replied in the affirmative, and off we started on  July 16th. It was very short notice, but changing quarters at short  notice is part of an Indian official's life, and the prospect of  work was delightful to me. We had a trying journey down to Calcutta,  as the rains had not begun in the North-West Provinces, and the heat  was tremendous. However, we arrived none the worse for it, and stayed  for a day or two with our kind friends, the Medlicotts.    As Colonel Keatinge, the Chief Commissioner of Assam, wished to see  me before I went to Manipur, I was ordered to join at Shillong, so  we proceeded by rail to Goalundo, one night's journey from Calcutta,  and thence by river steamer to Chuttuk, on the Soorma, where we  changed into country boats, and proceeded up a smaller river and  across great jheels or shallow lakes, often passing for miles through  high grass growing in the water, which hid us from everything, till we  reached a place called Bholagunj, situated on a river rapidly becoming  narrower, where we again changed, this time into small canoes, the  only conveyances that could take us up the rapids, with which the  river abounds.    From Chuttuk we had come through a country mostly covered with grass  jungle, twelve to fifteen feet in height; now we passed through  forest scenery, very lovely fine trees, with festoons of creepers  and flowers overhanging the stream. At last we reached Thuria Ghat,  where the ascent of the hills commenced, and there we halted for the  night in the Dak Bungalow, or rest house. Most places situated as  Thuria Ghat is, would be deadly on account of malaria, but it seems  to be an exception, and, as far as I have seen, healthy.    Knowing the servant difficulties in the province of Assam, we had  brought servants with us from Almorah, men who had implored us to  take them. When I consented to do so I voluntarily raised their wages  from fifty to eighty per cent. above what they had been receiving,  but with the exception of a Dhobee (washerman), and a bearer (a  compound of housemaid and valet), they all became corrupted by the  other servants they met at Shillong, and who spoke of Manipur in  very disparaging terms, so before going farther I let them go, as  they demanded an enormous increase of wages.    The Dhobee Nunnoo, and the bearer Horna, stuck to me to the very last,  and proved admirable servants. It was fortunate that we had servants,  as there were none at Thuria Ghat rest house; as it was, we managed  very well, and were prepared to march in the morning before the coolies  were ready to take up our luggage. We had a tiring march up the hill  to Cherra Poojee; my wife and the children were in baskets on men's  backs, but I was on foot and felt the march in the intense heat to be  very fatiguing, though we halted to rest half-way. However, when we  reached the plateau of Cherra Poojee, 4000 feet above Thuria Ghat,  the cool air speedily set me right, and we all enjoyed the scenery,  hills, plains, waterfalls in abundance, deep valleys, and the lowlands  of Sylhet, covered with water, as far as the eye could reach. We had  a comfortable bungalow to rest in, and a cool night at last.    Next day we marched to Moflung, 6000 feet above the sea, and then to  Shillong, where for the next few days we were hospitably entertained by  the Chief Commissioner, Colonel (now General) Keatinge, V.C., C.S.I.,  who kindly sent a carriage to meet us on the road. As Colonel Keatinge  wished me to remain at Shillong for a time, and meet Mr. Carnegy,  political officer in the Naga Hills, who was coming there later on,  I arranged to stay, and took a house; so we settled down comfortably  till the early part of October--a very pleasant arrangement for us  instead of facing the intense heat of the Cachar Valley in August. It  gave me a good opportunity of looking over the records of the Chief  Commissioner's office, where I found much relating to Manipur, but  I fear that it was lost when the Record Office was burnt down some  years ago, the copies also having been destroyed in Manipur during  the rebellion of 1891. At last the day for leaving came, and we packed  up our things and prepared once more to set off on our travels.    Before leaving, I paid several visits to Colonel McCulloch, who, since  retiring from the service, had established himself at Shillong, and  asked his advice on many points, and learned much from him regarding  Manipur. He very kindly gave his opinion freely on all questions,  telling me where some of my predecessors had failed, and pointing out  the pitfalls to be avoided. He added to all his kindness by writing  to the Maharajah, and telling him that, from what he had seen of me,  he was sure it would be his fault if we did not get on together.                CHAPTER VII.        Start for Manipur--March over the hills--Lovely scenery--View of      the valleys--State reception--The Residency--Visitors.      Lowremba Subadar, an excellent old fellow, formerly in the service  of Colonel McCulloch, was sent to Shillong to be in attendance  on me, and of course to find out all he could about me and report  the result. Before I left, he sent a note to the Maharajah of my  requirements in the way of coolies, etc., for our long journey of  ten days between Cachar and Manipur, and I also intimated that, as  the representative of the British Government, and as one who well  knew what was due to me as such, I should expect to be received with  proper ceremony.    This was a point on which I laid much stress,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3785"],[0,"In the Reign of Terror: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy (#12)"],[1,"until the Assembly pass a decree upon the subject.\"    \"I am sure we are much indebted to this Monsieur Lebat,\" Marie  said. \"He was here at the hunting party and seemed a worthy young  man of his class. Of course he was out of place among us, but for  a man in his position he seemed tolerable.\"    \"Yes,\" Monsieur du Tillet agreed, but in a somewhat doubtful tone  of voice. \"So far as assurances go there is nothing to be desired,  and he has, as I said, so far acted loyally up to them, and  yet somehow I do not like him. It strikes me that he is playing a  game, although what that game is I cannot say.  At  anyrate I do  not trust him; he speaks smoothly but I think he has a double face,  and that he is cruel and treacherous.\"    \"That is not like you, Monsieur du Tillet,\" Marie laughed, \"you  who generally have a good word for everyone. It seems to me that  you are hard upon the young man, who appears to be animated by  excellent sentiments towards us.\"    Spring came again. M. du Tillet learned that the mob of Dijon were  becoming more and more violent, and that spies and watchmen had  been told off to see that none of the family attempted to fly for  the frontier. He therefore wrote to the marquis urging that it  would be better that the family should move to Paris, where they  would be in no danger. In reply he received a letter begging him  to start as soon as the roads were fit for travel.    About the same time Victor de Gisons received a summons from his  father to join him in Paris.    The messenger who brought the letter to M. du Tillet brought one  also for Marie from the marquise, saying that the heads of both  families were of opinion that the marriage must be still further  postponed, as in the present state of affairs all private plans and  interests must be put aside in view of the dangers that surrounded  the king. Marie acquiesced in the decision, and bade her lover  adieu calmly and bravely.    \"They are quite right, Victor; I have felt for some time that when  France was on the verge of a precipice it was not the time for her  nobles to be marrying. Noblesse oblige. If we were two peasants  we might marry and be happy. As it is we must wait, even though we  know that waiting may never come to an end. I have a conviction,  Victor, that our days of happiness are over, and that terrible  things are about to happen.\"    \"But nothing that can happen can separate us, Marie.\"    \"Nothing but death, Victor,\" she said quietly.    \"But surely, Marie, you take too gloomy a view. Death, of course,  may separate all lovers; but there seems no reason that we should  fear him now more than at other times. A few farmers-general and  others who have made themselves obnoxious to the mob have been  killed, but what is that! There should at least be no hostility  to our order. Many of the nobles have  been foremost in demanding  reforms. All have cheerfully resigned their privileges. There is  no longer the slightest reason for hostility against us.\"    \"My dear Victor,\" Marie said quietly, \"you do not ask a wild beast  about to rend his prey, what is the reason for his actions. I hope  I may be wrong; but at least, dear, we shall see each other again  before long, and, whatever troubles may come, will share them. My  mother in her letter yesterday said that she and the marquis had  determined that we should join them in Paris; for that although the  disorders have abated somewhat they are anxious at the thought of  our being alone here, and in the present position of things they  have no hope of being able to leave the king. She says my father  is very indignant at the great emigration of the nobility that  is going on. In the first place, he holds that they are deserting  their post in the face of the enemy; and in the second place, by  their assemblage across the frontier and their intrigues at foreign  courts against France they are causing the people to look with  suspicion upon the whole class.\"    \"You have kept your good news till the last, Marie,\" Victor said.  \"Here have we been saying good-bye, and it seems that we are going  to meet again very shortly.\"    \"I have been bidding farewell,\" Marie said, \"not to you, but to  our dream of happiness. We shall meet soon, but I fear that will  never return.\"    \"You are a veritable prophet of ill to-day, Marie,\" Victor said  with an attempt at gaiety. \"Some day, I hope, dear, that we shall  smile together over your gloomy prognostication.\"    \"I hope so, Victor--I pray God it may be so!\"    A week later three carriages arrived from Paris to convey the  family there; and upon the following day the whole party started;  the girls, the gouvernante, the abbe, and some of the female servants  occupying the carriages, Monsieur du Tillet, the boys, and several  of the men riding beside them as an escort.    They met with no interruption on the road, and arrived in Paris  on the last day of April, 1792. Harry was glad at the change. The  doings at Paris had been the subject of conversation and thought for  nearly two years, and he had caught the excitement which pervaded  France. He was tired of the somewhat monotonous life in the country,  and had for some time been secretly  longing to be at the centre  of interest, and to see for himself the stirring events, of which  little more than a feeble echo had reached them at the chateau.    The change of life was great indeed; the marquis had thrown himself  into the thick of all that was going on, and his salon was crowded  every evening with those of the nobility who still remained In  Paris. But he was regarded as by no means a man of extreme views,  and many of the leaders of the party of the Gironde with whose names  Harry was familiar were also frequent visitors--Roland, Vergniaud,  Lanjuinais, Brissot, Guader, Lebrun, and Condorcer.    Harry was struck with the variety of conversation that went on at  these meetings. Many of the young nobles laughed and chatted with  the ladies with as much gaiety as if the former state of things  were continuing undisturbed; and an equal indifference to the public  state of things was shown by many of the elders, who sat down and  devoted themselves to cards. Others gathered apart in little groups  and discussed gloomily and in low tones the events of the day;  while others who were more liberal in their views gathered round the  deputies of the Gironde and joined in their talk upon the meetings  of the Assembly and the measures which were necessary to consolidate  the work of reform, and to restore peace and happiness to France.    The marquis moved from group to group, equally at home with all,  chatting lightly with the courtiers, whispering gravely with the  elders, or discussing with the tone of the man of the world the  views and opinions of the deputies. Victor de Gisons was constantly  at the house, and strove by his cheerfulness and gaiety to dissipate  the shade of melancholy which still hung over Marie.    Towards the end of July the Marquis de St. Caux and the little  body of royalists who still remained faithful to the king became  more and more anxious; the position of the royal family was now  most precarious; most of the troops in Paris had been sent to the  frontier, and those left behind were disorganized and ready to join  the mob.  Two out of the three Swiss battalions had been sent away  and but one remained at the Tuileries. Of the National Guard only  the battalion of Filles St. Thomas and part of the battalion of  the Saints Pares could be trusted to defend the king. The rest were  opposed to him, and would certainly join the populace.    On the 14th of July a large number of National Guards from the  provinces had arrived in Paris; and the battalion from Marseilles,  the most violent of all, had, immediately that it arrived in the  city, come into collision with one of the loyal battalions.    The royalists were wholly without organization, their sole aim  being to defend the king should he be in danger, and if necessary  to die by his side.    On the evening before the 10th of August the tocsin was heard to  sound and the drums to beat to arms. All day there had been sinister  rumours circulating, but the king had sent privately to his friends  that the danger was not imminent and that he had no need of them;  however, as soon as the alarm sounded the marquis snatched up a  sword and prepared to start for the palace. He embraced his wife,  who was calm but very pale, and his children. Ernest asked to be  allowed to go with him, but the marquis said:    \"No, my son, my life is the king's; but yours at present is due  to your mother and sisters.\"    It was twenty-four hours before he returned. His clothes were torn,  his head was bound up, and one of his arms disabled. The marquise  gave a cry of delight as he entered. No one had slept since he  left, for every hour fresh rumours of fighting had arrived, and  the sound of cannon and musketry had been heard in the early part  of the day.    \"It is all over, wife!\" he said. \"We have done our best, but the  king will do nothing. We cannot say we have lost the battle, for  we have never tried to win it; but it would be the same thing in  the long run.\"    Before hearing what had passed the marquise insisted upon her husband  taking refreshment and having his wounds bound up and attended to.  When he had finished his meal the marquis began:    \"We had a good deal of difficulty in getting into the Tuileries,  for the National Guard tried to prevent our passing. However, we  most of us got through; and we found that there were about a hundred  assembled, almost all men of family. The Marshal de Mailly led us  into the king's apartment.    \"'Sire,' he said, 'here are your faithful nobles, eager to replace  your majesty on the throne of your ancestors.' The National Guard  in the palace withdrew at once, leaving us alone with the Swiss.    \"We formed in the courtyard; and the king, with his hat in his"]]]
