But these things are long in fashioning; meanwhile,  conditions are changing; climate, soil, vegetation vary; foes and rivals  diminish or increase; the old go, and others with different weapons and  a new strategy take their place; and just as a skilful man \"fighting the  wilderness\" fashions a plough from a hunting-knife, turns his implements  into weapons of war, and for everything he possesses discovers a use  never contemplated by its maker, so does Nature--only with an ingenuity  exceeding that of man--use the means she has to meet all contingencies,  and enable her creatures, seemingly so ill-provided, to maintain their  fight for life. Natural selection, like an angry man, can make a weapon  of anything; and, using the word in this wide sense, the mucous  secretions the huanaco discharges into the face of an adversary, and the  pestilential drops \"distilled\" by the skunk, are weapons, and may be as  effectual in defensive warfare as spines, fangs and tushes.    I do not know of a more striking instance in the animal kingdom of  adaptation of structure to habit than is afforded by the hairy  armadillo--Dasypus villosus. He appears to us, roughly speaking, to  resemble an ant-eater saddled with a dish cover; yet this creature, with  the cunning Avhich Nature has given it to supplement all deficiencies,  has discovered in its bony encumbrance a highly efficient weapon of  offence. Most other edentates are diurnal and almost exclusively  insectivorous, some feeding only on ants; they have unchangeable habits,  very limited intelligence, and vanish before civilization. The hairy  armadillo alone has struck out a line for itself. Like its fast  disappearing congeners, it is an insect-eater still, but does not like  them seek its food on the surface and in the ant-hill only; all kinds of  insects are preyed on, and by means of its keen scent it discovers worms  and larvae several inches beneath the surface. Its method of taking  worms and grubs resembles that of probing birds, for it throws up no  earth, but forces its sharp snout and wedge-shaped head down to the  required depth; and probably while working it moves round in a circle,  for the hole is conical, though the head of the animal is flat. Where it  has found a rich hunting-ground, the earth is seen pitted with hundreds  of these neat symmetrical bores. It is also an enemy to ground-nesting  birds, being fond of eggs and fledglings; and when unable to capture  prey it will feed on carrion as readily as a wild dog or vulture,  returning night after night to the carcase of a horse or cow as long as  the flesh lasts. Failing animal food, it subsists on vegetable diet; and  I have frequently found their stomachs stuffed with clover, and,  stranger still, with the large, hard grains of the maize, swallowed  entire.    It is not, therefore, strange that at all seasons, and even when other  animals are starving, the hairy armadillo is always fat and vigorous. In  the desert it is diurnal; but where man appears it becomes more and more  nocturnal, and in populous districts does not go abroad until long after  dark. Yet when a district becomes thickly settled it increases in  numbers; so readily does it adapt itself to new conditions. It is not to  be wondered at that the gauchos, keen observers of nature as they are,  should make this species the hero of many of their fables of the \"Uncle  Remus\" type, representing it as a versatile creature, exceedingly  fertile in expedients, and duping its sworn friend the fox in various  ways, just as \"Brer Rabbit\" serves the fox in the North American fables.    The hairy armadillo will, doubtless, long survive all the other  armadillos, and on this account alone it will have an ever-increasing  interest for the naturalist. I have elsewhere described how it captures  mice; when preying on snakes it proceeds in another manner. A friend of  mine, a careful observer, who was engaged in cattle-breeding amongst the  stony sierras near Cape Corrientes, described to me an encounter he  witnessed between an armadillo and a poisonous snake. While seated on  the hillside one day he observed a snake, about twenty inches in length,  lying coiled up on a stoue five or six yards beneath him. By-and-by, a  hairy armadillo appeared trotting directly towards it. Apparently the  snake perceived and feared its approach, for it quickly uncoiled itself  and began gliding away. Instantly the armadillo rushed on to it, and,  squatting close down, began swaying its body backward and forward with a  regular sawing motion, thus lacerating its victim with the sharp,  deep-cut edges of its bony covering. The snake struggled to free itself,  biting savagely at its aggressor, for its head and neck were disengaged.  Its bites made no impression, and very soon it dropped its head, and  when its enemy drew off, it was dead and very much mangled. The  armadillo at once began its meal, taking the tail in its mouth and  slowly progressing towards the head; but when about a third of the snake  still remained it seemed satisfied, and, leaving that portion, trotted  away.    Altogether, in its rapacious and varied habits this armadillo appears to  have some points of resemblance with the hedgehog; and possibly, like  the little European mammal it resembles, it is not harmed by the bite of  venomous snakes.    I once had a cat that killed every snake it found, purely for sport,  since it never ate them. It would jump nimbly round and across its  victim, occasionally dealing it a blow with its cruel claws. The enemies  of the snake are legion. Burrowing owls feed largely on them; so do  herons and storks, killing them with a blow of their javelin beaks, and  swallowing them entire. The sulphur tyrant-bird picks up the young snake  by the tail, and, flying to a branch or stone, uses it like a flail till  its life is battered out. The bird is highly commended in consequence,  reminding one of very ancient words: \"Happy shall he be that taketh thy  little ones and dasheth them against the stones.\" In arraying such a  variety of enemies against the snake, nature has made ample amends for  having endowed it with deadly weapons. Besides, the power possessed by  venomous snakes only seems to us disproportionate; it is not really so,  except in occasional individual encounters. Venomous snakes are always  greatly outnumbered by non-venomous ones in the same district; at any  rate this is the case on the pampas. The greater activity of the latter  counts for more in the result than the deadly weapons of the former.    The large teguexin lizard of the pampas, called iguana by the country  people, is a notable snake-killer. Snakes have in fact, no more  formidable enemy, for he is quick to see, and swift to overtake them. He  is practically invulnerable, and deals them sudden death with his  powerful tail. The gauchos say that dogs attacking the iguana are  sometimes known to have their legs broken, and I do not doubt it. A  friend of mine was out riding one day after his cattle, and having  attached one end of his lasso to the saddle, He let it trail on the  ground. He noticed a large iguana lying apparently asleep in the sun,  and though he rode by it very closely, it did not stir; but no sooner  had he passed it, than it raised its head, and fixed its attention on  the forty feet of lasso slowly trailing by. Suddenly it rushed after the  rope, and dealt it a succession of violent blows with its tail. When the  whole of the lasso, several yards of which had been pounded in vain, had  been dragged by, the lizard, with uplifted head, continued gazing after  it with the greatest astonishment. Never had such a wonderful snake  crossed its path before!    Molina, in his _Natural History of Chill,_ says the vizcacha uses its  tail as a weapon; but then Molina is not always reliable. I have  observed vizcachas all my life, and never detected them making use of  any weapon except their chisel teeth. The tail is certainly very  curious, being straight at the base, then curving up outwardly, and  slightly down again at the tip, resembling the spout of a china teapot.  The under surface of the straight portion of the base is padded with a  thick, naked, corneous skin; and, when the animal performs the curious  sportive antics in which it occasionally indulges, it gives rapid  loud-sounding blows on the ground with this part of the tail. The  peculiar form of the tail also makes it a capital support, enabling the  vizcacha to sit erect, with ease and security.    The frog is a most timid, inoffensive creature, saving itself, when  pursued, by a series of saltatory feats unparalleled amongst  vertebrates. Consequently, when I find a frog, I have no hesitation in  placing my hands upon it, and the cold sensation it gives one is the  worse result I fear. It came to pass, however, that I once encountered a  frog that was not like other frogs, for it possessed an instinct and  weapons of offence which greatly astonished me. I was out snipe shooting  one day when, peering into an old disused burrow, two or three feet  deep, I perceived a burly-looking frog sitting it. It was larger and  stouter-looking than our common Rana, though like it in colour, and I at  once dropped on to my knees and set about its capture. Though it watched  me attentively, the frog remained perfectly motionless, and this greatly  surprised me. Before I was sufficiently near to make a grab, it sprang  straight at my hand, and, catching two of my fingers round with its fore  legs, administered a hug so sudden and violent as to cause an acute  sensation of pain; then, at the very instant I experienced this feeling,  which made me start back quickly, it released its hold and bounded out  and away. I flew after it, and barely managed to overtake it before it  could gain the water.

As has already been said, Freycinet was not with Le Geographe on this  voyage, and therefore knew nothing about it personally. But before the  publication of the official history was completed, Peron died. Baudin was  also dead. Freycinet, who was preparing the maps, was instructed to  finish the work. He therefore wrote up from the notes and diaries of  other members of the expedition a geographical description of the coasts  traversed. His general plan, when describing coasts with which he had no  personal acquaintance, was to acknowledge in footnotes the particular  persons on whose notes he relied for his descriptions. But it is a  singular circumstance that when he came to describe this part of the  coast of Terre Napoleon, and to repeat, with an addition, Peron's  statement that Port Phillip was seen on March 30, he gave no footnote or  reference. In whose diary or notes was that fact recorded? It was not in  the ship's log, as we have seen. Who, then, saw Port Phillip from Le  Geographe? Henri de Freycinet did not; Baudin did not; Peron did not;  Louis de Freycinet was not there. If it were seen by a look-out man, did  no officer, or scientist, or artist on board, take the trouble to look at  it, or to make a note about it, or a drawing of it? What singular  explorers these were!    We must examine Freycinet's story a little more closely. He is not  content with saying, as Peron had done, that the port was seen from the  masthead. He is more precise--he, the man who was not there. He says:  \"Nous en avons observe l'entree.\" That is more than Peron, who was there,  had claimed. If the \"entrance\" to Port Phillip was \"observed\" on March  30, still more incomprehensible is it that the ship did not enter, that  the fact was not mentioned in the log, that the latitude and longitude  were not taken, and that the artists neglected so excellent an  opportunity.    But that is not all. Freycinet, the man who was not there, and whose  narrative was not published till thirteen years after the voyage, has  further information to give us. He states, on whose authority we are not  told, that the country observed along part of this coast, between Cap  Suffren and Cap Marengo (that is, between Cape Patton and Cape Franklin),  presented \"un aspect riant et fertile.\" The book containing these  descriptive words was, the reader will recollect, published in 1815. Now,  Flinders' volumes, A Voyage to Terra Australis, were published in 1814.  There he had described the country which he saw from inside the port as  presenting \"a pleasing and in many places a fertile appearance.\" \"Un  aspect riant et fertile\" and \"a pleasing and fertile appearance\" are  identical terms. It may be a mere coincidence, though the comparison of  dates is a little startling. All the words which one can use are, as  Boileau said, \"in the dictionaries\"; every writer selects and arranges  them to suit his own ideas. But when Flinders said that the country  around Port Phillip looked \"pleasing and fertile,\" he had seen it to  advantage. On May 1 he had climbed Station Peak, one of the You-Yang  group of mountains, and saw stretched at his feet the rich Werribee  Plains, the broad miles of fat pastures leading away to Mount Macedon,  and the green rolling lands beyond Geelong, opening to the Victorian  Western District. In May the kangaroo-grass would be high and waving,  full of seed, a wealth of luxuriant herbage, the value of which Flinders,  a country-bred boy, would be quick to appreciate. On the other side of  the bay he had climbed Arthur's Seat at the back of Dromana, saw behind  him the waters of Westernport which Bass had discovered, and traced the  curve of the coast as far into the blue distance as his eye could  penetrate. He had warrant for saying that the country looked \"pleasing  and fertile.\" But how did Freycinet come to select those words, \"un  aspect riant et fertile\"? He was not there himself, and, as a matter of  probability, it seems most unlikely that such terms would occur to a  person who was there, either as applicable to the lands near Points  Nepean and Lonsdale, with their bastions of rock and ramparts of sand, or  to the scrubby and broken coast running down to Cape Otway, which, as a  matter of fact, is not fertile, except in little patches, and, even after  half a century of settlement, does not look as if it were. The conclusion  is hardly to be resisted that Freycinet thought he was safe in  appropriating, to describe land seen from seaward, terms which Flinders  had employed to describe land seen inside the port.    Three additional facts strengthen the conviction that Port Phillip was  never seen from Le Geographe, but that the statements of Peron and  Freycinet were made to cover up a piece of negligence in the exploration  of these coasts. The French, on their maps, lavishly bestowed names on  the capes, bays, and other features of the coasts seen by them. More will  be said on this subject in the next chapter. But meanwhile it is  important to notice that they gave no names to the headlands at the  entrance to Port Phillip, which are now known as Point Lonsdale and Point  Nepean. If they saw the entrance on March 30, why did they lose the  opportunity of honouring two more of their distinguished countrymen, as  they had done in naming Cap Richelieu (Schanck), Cap Desaix (Otway), Cap  Montaigne (Nelson), Cap Volney (Moonlight Head), and so many other  features of the coast? It is singular that while they named some capes  that do not exist--as, for instance, Cap Montesquieu, to which there is  no name on modern maps to correspond, and no projection from the coast to  which it can be applicable--they left nameless these sharp and prominent  tongues of rock which form the gateway of Port Phillip. But if they knew  nothing about the port until they learnt of its existence later at  Sydney, and saw no chart of it till an English chart was brought to their  notice, the omission is comprehensible.    Another fact which must not escape notice is that the French charts show  two lines of soundings, one along the inside of the Nepean peninsula, and  a shorter one towards the north. Mud Island is also indicated. How did  they get there? It was not even pretended in the history of the voyage  that Le Geographe went inside the heads. But see how the story grew: (a)  Baudin saw no port; (b) Peron says the port was seen from the masthead;  (c) Freycinet says the entrance was seen; (d) on the charts there are  actually soundings shown inside the harbour. Further consideration will  be given to these soundings in a later chapter.    The reader who has carefully followed the argument so far, will probably  have come to the conclusion that Captain Baudin's statement to Flinders  was perfectly true, and that the assertions of Peron and Freycinet which,  if veracious, would make Le Geographe the second ship that ever saw Port  Phillip--cannot be accepted. One other fact will clinch the case and  place the conclusion beyond doubt.    In 1812 Freycinet published a large folio volume of charts. The sixth  chart in the book is most valuable for our purpose. It is called a \"Carte  generale du Detroit de Bass.\" Its importance lies in the fact that by  means of a dotted line it marks the track of Le Geographe throughout her  course. Now, this track-chart shows clearly that the ship was never, at  any moment, nearer than six or seven miles to Port Phillip heads. On the  greater part of her course across the so-called Baie Talleyrand she was  much farther from the land than that. On no part of her course would it  have been possible for a person at the masthead to see either the  entrance to Port Phillip or any part of the port itself. It shows that  the ship, while steering across from Cape Schanck in the direction of  Cape Otway, diverted a few miles to the north-west, and then abruptly  turned south-west. From any part of this course, the stretch of coast  where Port Phillip heads are would present the appearance of an unbroken  wall of rock, the gap being covered by the overlapping land on the  western side. The sudden north-westerly diversion, and then the sharp  turn south-west, seem to indicate that Baudin thought it well to sail up  to see if there was anything worth examining at the head of the bight,  and concluded that there was not.    There can be no more authoritative opinion on the possibility of doing  what Peron and Freycinet claimed was done, than that of a member of the  Port Phillip pilot service. The pilot steamer is almost incessantly on  duty in what the French chose to call Baie Talleyrand. The pilots know  the ground intimately; they are familiar with every part of the coast;  they see it in all weathers; they observe the entrance under all  conditions of light and atmosphere. Wishing, therefore, to confirm an  opinion already adequately supported, the writer showed two large  photographed copies of two of Freycinet's charts to an experienced member  of the pilot service, and asked him whether it would have been possible  for Port Phillip to be seen from the situation indicated, or anywhere in  the vicinity, under any conceivable conditions. He at once replied that  it was utterly impossible.* (* Indeed, he promptly said, in the direct,  emphatic speech which is the special privilege of sailors: \"The man who  said he saw Port Phillip or the entrance from any point in that  neighbourhood would be lying.\") Even if Le Geographe had sailed close  along shore, he further observed, nothing like the contour of the port  shown on Freycinet's chart could have been drawn from the masthead; and  the track-chart shows that the ship's course was several miles from the  coast. In fact, the chart shows more than could have been seen if the  French had sailed close up to the heads and looked inside.    Peron's statement--which is not confirmed by Freycinet--that it had"]]]
