The figure is the size of life. Bill black, depressed along the whole  length, but more especially at the tip, which is rounded, thin, obtuse, and  recurved in both mandibles; the under of which, towards the middle, has a  convex swelling, which gives the recurvature a stronger appearance. All the  upper plumage and body beneath golden-green; the throat, to the breast,  shining with scale-like feathers of a vivid emerald-green. From the breast  to the vent is a stripe of black down the middle; thighs white; tail even,  the two middle feathers dull greenish-blue, the rest above obscure  coppery-brown, but beneath of a rich shining topaz colour.    I believe this bird is _unique_; I purchased it at Mr. Bullock's sale, and  that gentleman received it from Peru. It presents so much of the genuine  habit of the _Trochili_, that I have retained it under that genus; for,  though the bill is differently formed, that exception does not point out  any important difference from the general economy of those birds.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 106    [Illustration]    CURSORIUS Temminckii,    _Black-bellied Courier._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum mediocre, ad apicem compressum, mandibulis arcuatis, basi      depressa, apice acuto, integro.

Le Vaillant discovered another in Africa; and I am happy in now  adding a fourth from the same country, in the possession of Mr. Leadbeater.  No ornithologist has paid greater attention both to the natural affinities,  and to the illustration of the genera allied with these birds, than  Professor Temminck; and I therefore feel pleasure in naming this bird in  honour of that excellent ornithologist, from whom whenever I have differed,  it has been from the sole wish of eliciting truth. Total length from the  bill to the tail eight inches; bill one inch from the gape, and half from  the end of the nostrils; the colours of the bird are best seen in the  figure; the middle of the body, and the quill feathers, deep black; legs  three inches from the naked thigh to the tip of the middle toe, the claw of  which is serrated internally; tail round; the middle feathers not spotted;  the two next with a black dot near the tip, which, in the next pair, is  further broken into two white dots; the outer pair white. These birds  inhabit the arid tracts of Africa, at a distance from the sea, and run  amazingly swift. One species has occasionally visited England.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 107    [Illustration]    TROCHILUS ensipennis,    _Blue Sickle-winged Humming Bird._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 82.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _T.

I was  at first inclined to believe this bird was the male of the _T. latipennis_,  (or _l'Oiseau Mouche a larges tuyaux_ of Buffon), from the under plumage in  that species being uniform grey, a common indication of the female Humming  Birds; but a further comparison of the two has proved this supposition to  be erroneous. They differ, not only in colour, but in their bills; in that  of _T. latipennis_, the curvature is so slight, that it may be almost  called straight; whereas in this, the curve is very apparent. I have little  doubt future observations will show, that these singular quill-feathers,  now known to exist in three species of this family, are peculiar only to  the male birds.    This extremely rare bird is in my own collection, and is not improbably  _unique_; the figure is strictly of the natural size; the plumage, above  and below, is a uniform deep green, with a metallic reflection; half way  down, the throat is dark violet blue; tail even, and very broad, the middle  feathers obscure green, the next pair raven or bluish-black, and the others  white, with a black base.    The progress which has been made towards ascertaining the geographic  distribution of animals, leaves no doubt that this bird is an inhabitant of  either the Continent or Islands of South America; but of what particular  country is unknown.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 108    [Illustration]    RAMPHASTOS Dicolorus,    _Yellow-billed Toucan._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 45.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _R. niger, gula aurea; fascia pectorali lata tegminibusque rubris;      rostro viridi-flavo, basi fascia nigra transversa ornata; mandibulae      superioris margine laterali rubro; culmine plano._        Black; throat golden-yellow; broad pectoral band and tail-covers red;      bill greenish-yellow, the base with a transverse black band, and the      lateral margins of the upper mandible red; the top flat.

It is a species which seems to have been well understood by  Linnaeus and the older ornithologists, though none of them have described  the form or peculiarities of the bill; it is probably owing to this  omission, that Dr. Shaw has created an imaginary species in _General  Zoology_, under the name of _R. pectoralis_; compounded of the descriptions  he gathered of this bird, and the Linnaean _R. tucanus_. Dr. Latham's  description is also inaccurate; nor is it improved in the new edition of  his Synopsis, probably from not having himself seen the bird. Of the  figures, there is a masterly delineation by Barraband, in Le Vaillant's  work, but those of Buffon and Brisson are not to be trusted.    Total length about sixteen inches: bill three and a half; it is shorter and  much thicker along the back, than that of any other species; this part also  is broad, and quite flat; the serratures of the margin small, and the upper  mandible only edged with a line of red; the sides are compressed, and the  colours greenish-yellow; the orbits chesnut-red, and the feet (as in all  the Toucans when fresh) delicate fine blue.    Dr. Langsdorff favoured me with a specimen of this rare bird, shot by  himself in Southern Brazil; the sexes have been dissected by that able  naturalist, but to which the one here figured belongs, I am unacquainted.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 109    [Illustration]    PAPILIO Harrisianus.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 92.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _P.

Vigors, Esq., whose valuable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39674"],[0,"Buffalo Land (#12)"],[1,"weird and startling in this voice from those  long-forgotten ages--ages no less remote than when the ridge we were  standing upon was a portion of a lake shore. The man who trod those  sands, the professor informed us, perished from the face of the earth  countless ages before the oldest mummy was laid away in the caves of  Egypt; and yet people looked at the shriveled Egyptian, and thought that  they were holding converse with one who lived close upon the time of the  oldest inhabitant. They wrested secrets from his tomb, and called them  very ancient. And now this dweller beside the great lakes had lifted his  feet out of the sand to kick the mummy from his pedestal of honor in the  museum, as but a being of yesterday, in comparison with himself.    This discovery was soon afterward extensively noticed in the newspapers,  and the specimens are now in the collection made by our party at Topeka.  It is but fair to say that a difference of opinion exists in regard to  these imprints. Many scientific men, among whom is Professor Cope,  affirm that they must be the work of Indians long ago, as the age of the  rock puts it beyond the era of man, while others attribute them to some  lower order of animal, with a foot resembling the human one. For my own  part, after careful examination, I accept our professor's theory, that  the imprints are those of human feet. The surface of the stone has been  decided by experts to be bent down, not chiseled out. Science not long  ago ridiculed the primitive man, which it now accepts. It is not  strange, therefore, that science should protest against its oldest  inhabitant stepping out from ages in which it had hitherto forbidden him  existence.    We also found on the rocks fine impressions of leaves, resembling those  of the magnolia, and gathered a bushel of petrified walnuts and  butternuts. There were no other indications whatever of trees, the whole  country, as far as we could see, being a desolate prairie.    \"Gentlemen,\" said the professor, \"as surely as you stand on the shore of  a great lake, which passed away in comparatively modern times, science  stands on the brink of important revelations. We have here the evidence  of the rocks that man existed on this earth when the vast level upon  which you are about to enter was covered by its mass of water. The waves  lapped against the Rocky Mountains on the west, and against the ridges  on which you are standing, upon the east. From previous explorations, I  can assure you that the buffalo now feed over a surface strewn with the  remains of those monsters which inhabited the waters of the primitive  world, and the grasses suck nutriment from the shells of centuries.  Geology has held that man did not exist during the time of the great  lakes. I assert that he did, gentlemen, and now an inhabitant of that  period steps forward to confirm my position. This man walked  barefooted, and yet the contour of one of the feet, so different in  shape from that of any wild people's of the present day, shows that it  had been confined by some stiff material, like our leather shoes. The  appearance of the big toe is especially confirmatory of this. I would  call your attention, gentlemen, to the block which contains companion  impressions of the right and left foot. The latter is deep, and well  defined, every toe being separate and perfect. The former is shallow,  and spread out, with bulged-up ridges of stone between each toe. These  are exactly the impressions your own feet would make, on such a shore  to-day, were the sand under the right one to be of such a yielding  nature that in moving you withdrew it quickly, and rested more heavily  on the other, the material under which was firmer. Your right track  would spread, the mud bulging up between the toes, and forcing them out  of position, and the material nearly regaining its level, with a  misshapen impression upon its surface.    \"You will also perceive that the sand was already hardening into rock  when our ancient friends walked over it. I use the plural because, if I  may venture an opinion from this hasty examination, I should say the two  tracks were those of a female, the single one that of a man. From the  position of the blocks they were probably walking near each other at  that precise time when the new rock was soft enough to receive an  impression and hard enough to retain it. You will perceive that the  surface of the stone is bent down into the cavities, as that of a loaf  of half-raised bread would be should you press your hand into it.\"    Sachem thought that the couple might have been an ancient Paul and  Virginia telling their love on the shores of the old-time lake.    The Professor continued: \"You notice close beside the two imprints an  oval, rather deep hole in the rock, precisely like that a boy often  makes by whirling on one heel in the sand.\"    Sachem again interrupted: \"Perhaps the maiden went through the  fascinating evolution of revolving her body while her mind revolved the  'yes' or 'no' to her swain's question. It might be a refined way of  telling her lover that she was well 'heeled,' and asking if he was.\"    The Professor very gravely replied: \"In those days the world had not run  to slang. If one of Noah's children had dared to address him with the  modern salutation of 'governor,' the venerable patriarch would have  flung his child overboard from the ark. Taking your view of the case,  Mr. Sachem, the whirl in the sand, which gave the lover his answer, is  telling us to-day that same old story. And the coquette of that remote  period caused the tell-tale walk upon the sand, which has proved the  greatest geological discovery of modern times. I believe that it will be  followed up and sustained by others equally as important, all tending to  date man's birth thousands of years anterior to the time geology has  hitherto assigned him an existence upon earth.\"    We spent many hours of the night in getting the rocks to the depot for  shipment to Topeka, the few inhabitants of Bavaria assisting us. Soon  after a westward train came along, and we were again in motion toward  the home of the buffalo.    Before we slept the Professor gave us the following information: The  vast plateau lying east of the Rocky Mountains, and which we were now  approaching, was once covered by a series of great fresh-water lakes. At  an early period these must have been connected with the sea, their  waters then being quite salty, as is abundantly demonstrated by the  remains of marine shells. During the time of the continental elevation  these lakes were raised above the sea level, and their size very much  diminished. Over the new land thus created, and surrounding these  beautiful sheets of water, spread a vegetation at once so beautiful and  so rich in growth that earth has now absolutely nothing with which to  compare it. Amid these lovely pastures roved large herds of elephants,  with the mastodon, rhinoceros, horse, and elk, while the streams and  lakes abounded with fish. But the drainage toward the distant ocean  continued, the water area diminished, the hot winds of the dry land  drank up what remained of the lakes, and, in process of time, lo! the  great grass-covered plains that we wander over delightedly to-day. What  folly to suppose that such a land, so peculiarly fitted for man's  enjoyment, should remain, through a long period of time, tenanted simply  by brutes, and be given up to the human race only after its delightful  characteristics had been entirely removed.

Next morning, as the first gray darts of dawn fell against our windows,  Mr. Colon lifted up a sleepy head and gazed out. Then came that quick  jerk into an upright position which one assumes when startled suddenly  from a drowsy state to one of intense interest. The motion caused a  similar one on the part of each of us, as if a sort of jumping-jack set  of string nerves ran up our backs, and a man under the cars had pulled  them all simultaneously.    We were on the great earth-ocean; upon either side, until striking  against the shores of the horizon, the billows of buffalo-grass rolled  away. It seemed as if the Mighty Ruler had looked upon these waters when  the world was young, and said to them, \"Ye waves, teeming with life, be  ye earth, and remain in form as now, until the planet which bears you  dissolves!\" And so, frozen into stillness at the instant, what were then  billows of water now stretch away billows of land into what seems to the  traveler infinite distance, with the same long roll lapping against and  upon distant _buttes_ that the Atlantic has to-day in lashing its  rock-ribbed coasts; and whenever man's busy industry cleaves asunder the  surface, the depths, like those of ocean, give back their monsters and  rare shells. Huge saurians, locked for a thousand centuries in their  vice-like prison, rise up, not as of old to bask lazily in the sun, but  to gape with huge jaws at the demons of lightning and steam rushing  past, and to crack the stiff backs of savans with their forty feet of  tail.    To the south of us, and distant several miles, was the line, scarcely  visible, of the Smoky Hill, treeless and desolate; on the north, the  upper Saline, equally barren. As difficult to distinguish as two brown  threads dividing a brown carpet, they might have been easily overlooked,  had we not known the streams were there, and, with the aid of our  glasses, sought for their ill-defined banks.    A curve in the road brought us suddenly and sharply face to face with  the sun, just rising in the far-away east, and flashing its ruddy light  over the vast plain around us. Its bright red rim first appeared,"]]]
