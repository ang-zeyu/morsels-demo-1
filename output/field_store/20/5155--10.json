When we  stopped he would sit in front of his tent with his book on his knee, a  long chest of medicine before him, a colored man for his body servant,  and a hospital steward standing in front of the wagon. At sick call,  everyone who could not walk had to be taken before the doctor's tent,  and there be seated or laid down, sometimes on the wet ground, then,  like going to a mill, wait for his grist, or dose of calomel. There  was not much chance to miss it, for, when a man's name was called and  responded to, the hospital steward was ordered to give him such and  such a dose, and the old iron spoon, with its contents of we knew  not what, was presented in the presence of the doctor. Under these  circumstances we began to feel at least the rigors of military rule.    About this time we entered the Comanche Indian country, and on  September 2 camped on Cottonwood Creek. The Indians were said to be  very hostile, yet we had no trouble with them. I think it was here that  we began to see signs of buffalo, and the prairie dog villages. Timber  was very scarce, and the country was more uninviting than that we had  passed over.    Shortly after Lieutenant Colonel Smith took command we were drawn up  in line, and some military laws were read to us. At the end of almost  every sentence there was the word death, as punishment for infraction  of the law. We were then talked to in a most offensive and domineering  manner, until some of us began to wonder what we had done to merit such  severity and downright abuse.    We were tired and footsore, and suffered much from lack of water. The  country showed such a sameness of forbidding features that the journey  became very monotonous and tiresome. Fuel was so scarce that we had to  dig trenches two or three feet long, and eight or ten inches wide and  a foot deep, fill these with dry grass, and start a fire and pile on  buffalo chips, with which to do our cooking. The result was our food  often was half raw and badly smoked, and many of the men were brought  down with severe diarrheal complaints. As many had traveled the road in  advance of us, even buffalo chips for fuel were so scarce that often we  had to go for miles to gather them.    When we reached Pawnee Fork we found it a very difficult stream to  cross. The wagons had to be let down the steep bank with ropes, by the  men, and had to be taken up the opposite bank in the same manner.    The events narrated here will indicate that it is not all of a  soldier's duty when on a long march to tramp all day with musket and  accoutrements and knapsack, but the soldier on such a journey as we  had must push and pull wagons up hill, hold them back when going down  hill, haul them through deep sands, and help them and the teams out  of quicksands; he must stand guard and night-herd stock; must press  on, over rough or smooth ground, rain or shine; must wade rivers, and  when crossing streams is not allowed to take off his clothing, but has  to plunge into the water, and then travel on in wet clothes; besides,  there are many other experiences that are far from pleasant.    We pushed along the best we could to the Arkansas River, through a  very uninviting country, in which we began to find brackish water and  saleratus. We traveled up the broad river bottoms of the Arkansas  eighty to one hundred miles, the water being poor and unhealthy. Many  were added to the corps of \"Jim along, Joseys,\" and had to be led or  carried by their comrades to the unfeeling doctor, many times to be  cursed at by him, and then to take a dose from his nauseating spoon.  Quite a number of the sick were badly salivated by the drugs given them.    About September 15 or 16, we crossed the river where the roads fork,  one going toward Fort Benton, and the other leading to Santa Fe. There  we parted with Captain Nelson Higgins, he having been detailed to take  a small squad of men and the families to a Spanish town called Pueblo,  some hundred miles away, there to winter. Meanwhile, we pushed our  way over barren plains and sandy deserts to the Cimmaron River. We  saw deceptive rivers, ponds and lakes; we chased after them for miles  sometimes, till we found that, like jack o' lantern or will o' the  wisp, we could not get nearer to them. Finally we learned that they  were mirages--a peculiar reflection of the sun upon the great plains or  sandy deserts. It seemed impossible for the inexperienced to discern  the difference between the mirage and a body of real water.    In this barren country we saw immense herds of buffalo; in our long  march we came to ponds of water made perfectly filthy by the buffalo,  and rendered offensive by the broiling hot sun, the liquid being almost  as thick as gruel; but we were so terribly famished with thirst that we  were glad to get even such foul water.    When the Cimmaron River was reached, there was good water, and good  feed for our stock, but our rations were reduced one-third, and we were  pretty well worn down.    On the 18th or 19th of September it was my place to be on guard. I had  stood the journey very well, but by this time had become affected by  the alkali, and that day was so badly afflicted with diarrhea as to be  almost unable to drag myself into camp. But rather than march to \"Jim  along, Josey,\" I took my place on guard. That night there came on one  of the most terrible storms I ever have experienced. I had to brace  myself with my musket to stand. From that date I have never been free  from pain in the right limb, near the instep, caused by the severe  exposure. Next day it became necessary to go on the sick list, to  remain several days.    About the 23rd we began to come to timber in the hills, and having been  for nine or ten days with nothing but grass and buffalo chips for fuel,  we were in a situation to appreciate the change. Soon we were among the  sandhills, where traveling was hard, and passed the Rabbit Ears (Black  Peak and Agua Fria Peak), two high mountain peaks. In this mountainous  region we found traces of the inhabitants of a past age, in old stone  walls and in numerous' irrigation canals long since dry.    On the 2nd or 3rd of October we came to the Red River. The mountain  air was bracing, but there were many men who yet remained sick. About  this time the command was culled over by Lieutenant Colonel Smith and  the doctor, and all who were considered able to stand a forced march to  Santa Fe were ordered forward on the double quick.    The sick men were left to take care of themselves as best they could,  with the broken down teams of the command to look after. My lot was  still with the invalids, and of course I had to remain. Yet we were  only about two days behind the strong men who left us in the mountains;  we reached Santa Fe on October 12th, having passed through several  Mexican villages, the houses of which were low and flat-roofed, and  covered principally with cement and tile. We saw the very small Mexican  sheep and goats, the people milking the latter, by sitting at the back  end, in an earthen pot, and there milking regardless of anything that  might drop into the vessel intended for milk only.    From the appearance of Santa Fe we had no reason to doubt that it was  between three and four hundred years old; for it looked at least that  far behind the times. Mexicans and Indians, badly mixed, made up the  population. Their costume, manners, habits, and in fact everything,  were both strange and novel to us, and of course were quite an  attraction. Many of the people looked on us with suspicion, and if  it had been in their power no doubt they would have given us a warm  reception; others appeared to be pleased, doubtless because it made  trade better for them, and on that account they seemed very friendly.  They brought into camp, for sale, many articles of food; the strongest  of these were red pepper pies, the pepper-pods as large as a teacup, and  onions (savoyas) as large as saucers, to be eaten raw like turnips.    A few days' rest and change of food at Santa Fe, and the command was  ready to resume its arduous march.        CHAPTER VI.    EXEMPLAR'S CONDUCT OF THE MORMON TROOPS--LIEUTENANT COLONEL  P. ST. GEORGE COOKE ARRIVES AND ASSUMES COMMAND--A WELCOME  CHANGE--ANOTHER DETACHMENT OP SICK, ALSO THE LAUNDRESSES, SENT TO  PUEBLO--SELECTING MEN TO CONTINUE THE JOURNEY TO CALIFORNIA--REDUCING  THE BAGGAGE--DIFFICULTIES OF THE 1,100 MILES JOURNEY AHEAD--POOR  EQUIPMENT THEREFOR--LEAVE SANTA FE--ROADS OF HEAVY SAND--ON ONE-THIRD  RATIONS--HARDSHIPS INCREASE--GALLED FEET AND GNAWING STOMACHS--MORE  SICK MEN FOR PUEBLO--LEAVING THE LAST WAGONS--MULES AND OXEN IN A PACK  TRAIN--IN AN UNKNOWN COUNTRY--HUNTING A PASS OVER THE MOUNTAINS--ALARM  OF AN ENEMY--A BEAVER DAM--CROSSING THE RIO GRANDE DEL NORTE--GREAT  SUFFERING AMONG THE TROOPS.    WHILE we were in Santa Fe, Colonel Sterling Price came in with his  cavalry command, and soon the town prison was filled with them, so that  it became necessary for a guard from the Mormon Battalion to be posted  at the prison. I do not recall that any of our command was put into the  prison, though it is possible one or two might have been, for a few of  them got rather too much wine; but it was a very few who acted that  way. There were many invalids of other commands left to garrison Santa  Fe, and they caused considerable disturbance, many of them getting into  prison.    It seems that word had gone ahead to the Mexican town that the Mormons  were a very hard class of outlaws, consequently at first we were looked  upon as \"toughs\" of the very worst kind. But when the people had an  opportunity to see our superior conduct in contrast with that of the  other troops, they realized the true situation, and male and female  thronged our camp in friendly visit.    It was on October 13, 1846, that Lieutenant Colonel P. St. George Cooke  assumed command of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54335"],[0,"The Women of Mormondom (#12)"],[1,"who became his celestial bride, and  whose beautiful ideals have so much glorified celestial marriage.    There were also others of our Mormon heroines who had now gathered to  the West to build up Zion, that their \"King might appear in his glory.\"  Among them was that exalted woman--so beloved and honored in the Mormon  church--the life-long wife of Heber C. Kimball. There were also Mary  Angel, and many apostolic women from New England, who have since stood,  for a generation, as pillars in the latter-day kingdom. We shall meet  them hereafter.    And the saints, as doves flocking to the window of the ark of the new  covenant, gathered to Zion. They came from the East and the West and  the North and the South.    Soon the glad tidings were conveyed to other lands. Great Britain  \"heard the word of the Lord,\" borne there by apostles Heber C. Kimball,  Orson Hyde and Willard Richards, and others.    Soon also the saints began to gather from the four quarters of the  earth; and those gatherings have increased until more than a hundred  thousand disciples--the majority of them women--have come to America,  as their land of promise, to build up thereon the Zion of the last days.        CHAPTER X.    THE LATTER-DAY ILIAD--REPRODUCTION OF THE GREAT HEBRAIC DRAMA--THE  MEANING OF THE MORMON MOVEMENT IN THE AGE.    It was \"a gathering dispensation.\" A strange religion indeed, that  meant something more than faith and prayers and creeds.    An empire-founding religion, as we have said,--this religion of a  latter-day Israel. A religion, in fact, that meant all that the name of  \"Latter-day Israel\" implies.    The women who did their full half in founding Mormondom, comprehended,  as much as did their prototypes who came up out of Egypt, the  significance of the name of Israel.    Out of Egypt the seed of promise, to become a peculiar people, a holy  nation, with a distinctive God and a distinctive destiny. Out of modern  Babylon, to repeat the same Hebraic drama in the latter age.    A Mormon iliad in every view; and the sisters understanding it fully.  Indeed perhaps they have best understood it. Their very experience  quickened their comprehension.    The cross and the crown of thorns quicken the conception of a  crucifixion. The Mormon women have borne the cross and worn the crown  of thorns for a full lifetime; not in their religion, but in their  experience. Their strange destiny and the divine warfare incarnated in  their lives, gave them an experience matchless in its character and  unparalleled in its sacrifices.    The sisters understood their religion, and they counted the cost of  their divine ambitions.    What that cost has been to these more than Spartan women, we shall  find in tragic stories of their lives, fast unfolding in the coming  narrative of their gatherings and exterminations.    For the first twenty years of their history the tragedy of the  Latter-day Israel was woeful enough to make their guardian angels weep,  and black enough in its scenes to satisfy the angriest demons.    This part of the Mormon drama began in 1831 with the removal of the  church from the State of New York to Kirtland, Ohio, and to Jackson,  and other counties in Missouri; and it culminated in the martyrdom of  the prophet and his brother at Nauvoo, and the exodus to the Rocky  Mountains. In all these scenes the sisters have shown themselves  matchless heroines.    The following, from an early poem, written by the prophetess, Eliza R.  Snow, will finely illustrate the Hebraic character of the Mormon work,  and the heroic spirit in which these women entered into the divine  action of their lives:      My heart is fix'd--I know in whom I trust.    'Twas not for wealth--'twas not to gather heaps    Of perishable things--'twas not to twine    Around my brow a transitory wreath,    A garland decked with gems of mortal praise,    That I forsook the home of childhood; that    I left the lap of ease--the halo rife    With friendship's richest, soft, and mellow tones;    Affection's fond caresses, and the cup    O'erflowing with the sweets of social life,    With high refinement's golden pearls enrich'd.      Ah, no! A holier purpose fir'd my soul;    A nobler object prompted my pursuit.    Eternal prospects open'd to my view,    And hope celestial in my bosom glow'd.    God, who commanded Abraham to leave    His native country, and to offer up    On the lone altar, where no eye beheld    But that which never sleeps, an only son,    Is still the same; and thousands who have made    A covenant with him by sacrifice,    Are bearing witness to the sacred truth--    Jehovah speaking has reveal'd his will.      The proclamation sounded in my ear--    It reached my heart--I listen'd to the sound--    Counted the cost, and laid my earthly all    Upon the altar, and with purpose fix'd    Unalterably, while the spirit of    Elijah's God within my bosom reigns,    Embrac'd the everlasting covenant,    And am determined now to be a saint,    And number with the tried and faithful ones,    Whose race is measured with their life; whose prize    Is everlasting, and whose happiness    Is God's approval; and to whom 'tis more    Than meat and drink to do his righteous will.      * * * *      Although to be a saint requires    A noble sacrifice--an arduous toil--    A persevering aim; the great reward    Awaiting the grand consummation will    Repay the price, however costly; and    The pathway of the saint the safest path    Will prove; though perilous--for 'tis foretold,    All things that can be shaken, God will shake;    Kingdoms and governments, and institutes,    Both civil and religious, must be tried--    Tried to the core, and sounded to the depth.      Then let me be a saint, and be prepar'd    For the approaching day, which like a snare    Will soon surprise the hypocrite--expose    The rottenness of human schemes--shake off    Oppressive fetters--break the gorgeous reins    Usurpers hold, and lay the pride of man--    The pride of nations, low in dust!    And there was in these gatherings of our latter-day Israel, like as in  this poem, a tremendous meaning. It is of the Hebrew significance and  genius rather than of the Christian; for Christ is now Messiah, King of  Israel, and not the Babe of Bethlehem. Mormondom is no Christian sect,  but an Israelitish nationality, and even woman, the natural prophetess  of the reign of peace, is prophesying of the shaking of \"kingdoms and  governments and all human institutions.\"    The Mormons from the beginning well digested the text to the great  Hebrew drama, and none better than the sisters; here it is:    \"Now the Lord had said unto Abram, get thee out of thy country, and  from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will  shew thee;    \"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and  make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing;    \"And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth  thee; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.\"    And so, for now nearly fifty years, this Mormon Israel have been  getting out of their native countries, and from their kindred, and from  their father's house unto the gathering places that their God has shown  them.    But they have been driven from those gathering places from time to  time; yes, driven farther west. There was the land which God was  showing them. At first it was too distant to be seen even by the eye of  faith. Too many thousands of miles even for the Spartan heroism of the  sisters; too dark a tragedy of expulsions and martyrdoms; and too many  years of exoduses and probations. The wrath of the Gentiles drove them  where their destiny led them--to the land which God was showing them.    And for the exact reason that the patriarchal Abraham and Sarah were  commanded to get out of their country and from their kindred and their  father's house, so were the Abrahams and Sarahs of our time commanded  by the same God and for the same purpose.    \"I will make of thee a great nation.\" \"And I will make my covenant  between me and thee, and I will multiply thee exceedingly.\" \"And thou  shalt be a father of many nations.\" \"And I will establish my covenant  between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations, for  an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and thy seed after thee.\"    To fulfill this in the lives of these spiritual sons and daughters of  Abraham and Sarah, the gathering dispensation was brought in. These  Mormons have gathered from the beginning that they might become the  fathers and mothers of a nation, and that through them the promises  made to the Abrahamic fathers and mothers might be greatly fulfilled.    This is most literal, and was well understood in the early rise of the  church, long before polygamy was known. Yet who cannot now see that  in such a patriarchal covenant was the very overture of patriarchal  marriage--or polygamy.    So in the early days quite a host of the daughters of New  England--earnest and purest of women--many of them unmarried, and most  of them in the bloom of womanhood--gathered to the virgin West to  become the mothers of a nation, and to build temples to the name of a  patriarchal God!        CHAPTER XI.    THE LAND OF TEMPLES--AMERICA THE NEW JERUSALEM--DARING CONCEPTION OF  THE MORMON PROPHET--FULFILLMENT OF THE ABRAHAMIC PROGRAMME--WOMAN TO BE  AN ORACLE OF JEHOVAH.    Two thousand years had nearly passed since the destruction of the  temple of Solomon; three thousand years, nearly, since that temple of  the old Jerusalem was built.    Yet here in America in the nineteenth century, _among the Gentiles_, a  modern Israel began to rear temples to the name of the God of Israel!  Temples to be reared to his august name in every State on this vast  continent! Thus runs the Mormon prophesy.    All America, the New Jerusalem of the last days! All America for the  God of Israel! What a conception! Yet"]]]
