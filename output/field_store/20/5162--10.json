Endeavour is even more effectually restrained by the  certainty of its impotence than by any positive discouragement.  Between subjection to the will of others and the virtues of self-help  and self-government there is a natural incompatibility. This is more  or less complete according as the bondage is strained or relaxed.  Rulers differ very much in the length to which they carry the control  of the free agency of their subjects, or the supersession of it by  managing their business for them. But the difference is in degree, not  in principle; and the best despots often go the greatest lengths in  chaining up the free agency of their subjects. A bad despot, when his  own personal indulgences have been provided for, may sometimes be  willing to let the people alone; but a good despot insists on doing  them good by making them do their own business in a better way than  they themselves know of. The regulations which restricted to fixed  processes all the leading branches of French manufactures were the  work of the great Colbert.    Very different is the state of the human faculties where a human being  feels himself under no other external restraint than the necessities  of nature, or mandates of society which he has his share in imposing,  and which it is open to him, if he thinks them wrong, publicly to  dissent from, and exert himself actively to get altered. No doubt,  under a government partially popular, this freedom may be exercised  even by those who are not partakers in the full privileges of  citizenship; but it is a great additional stimulus to any one's  self-help and self-reliance when he starts from even ground, and has  not to feel that his success depends on the impression he can make  upon the sentiments and dispositions of a body of whom he is not one.  It is a great discouragement to an individual, and a still greater one  to a class, to be left out of the constitution; to be reduced to plead  from outside the door to the arbiters of their destiny, not taken into  consultation within. The maximum of the invigorating effect of freedom  upon the character is only obtained when the person acted on either  is, or is looking forward to becoming, a citizen as fully privileged  as any other. What is still more important than even this matter of  feeling is the practical discipline which the character obtains from  the occasional demand made upon the citizens to exercise, for a time  and in their turn, some social function. It is not sufficiently  considered how little there is in most men's ordinary life to give any  largeness either to their conceptions or to their sentiments. Their  work is a routine; not a labor of love, but of self-interest in the  most elementary form, the satisfaction of daily wants; neither the  thing done, nor the process of doing it, introduces the mind to  thoughts or feelings extending beyond individuals; if instructive  books are within their reach, there is no stimulus to read them; and,  in most cases, the individual has no access to any person of  cultivation much superior to his own. Giving him something to do for  the public supplies, in a measure, all these deficiencies. If  circumstances allow the amount of public duty assigned him to be  considerable, it makes him an educated man. Notwithstanding the  defects of the social system and moral ideas of antiquity, the  practice of the dicastery and the ecclesia raised the intellectual  standard of an average Athenian citizen far beyond any thing of which  there is yet an example in any other mass of men, ancient or modern.  The proofs of this are apparent in every page of our great historian  of Greece; but we need scarcely look further than to the high quality  of the addresses which their great orators deemed best calculated to  act with effect on their understanding and will. A benefit of the same  kind, though far less in degree, is produced on Englishmen of the  lower middle class by their liability to be placed on juries and to  serve parish offices, which, though it does not occur to so many, nor  is so continuous, nor introduces them to so great a variety of  elevated considerations as to admit of comparison with the public  education which every citizen of Athens obtained from her democratic  institutions, makes them nevertheless very different beings, in range  of ideas and development of faculties, from those who have done  nothing in their lives but drive a quill, or sell goods over a  counter. Still more salutary is the moral part of the instruction  afforded by the participation of the private citizen, if even rarely,  in public functions. He is called upon, while so engaged, to weigh  interests not his own; to be guided, in case of conflicting claims, by  another rule than his private partialities; to apply, at every turn,  principles and maxims which have for their reason of existence the  general good; and he usually finds associated with him in the same  work minds more familiarized than his own with these ideas and  operations, whose study it will be to supply reasons to his  understanding, and stimulation to his feeling for the general  interest. He is made to feel himself one of the public, and whatever  is their interest to be his interest. Where this school of public  spirit does not exist, scarcely any sense is entertained that private  persons, in no eminent social situation, owe any duties to society  except to obey the laws and submit to the government. There is no  unselfish sentiment of identification with the public. Every thought  or feeling, either of interest or of duty, is absorbed in the  individual and in the family. The man never thinks of any collective  interest, of any objects to be pursued jointly with others, but only  in competition with them, and in some measure at their expense. A  neighbor, not being an ally or an associate, since he is never engaged  in any common undertaking for joint benefit, is therefore only a  rival. Thus even private morality suffers, while public is actually  extinct. Were this the universal and only possible state of things,  the utmost aspirations of the lawgiver or the moralist could only  stretch to make the bulk of the community a flock of sheep innocently  nibbling the grass side by side.    From these accumulated considerations, it is evident that the only  government which can fully satisfy all the exigencies of the social  state is one in which the whole people participate; that any  participation, even in the smallest public function, is useful; that  the participation should every where be as great as the general degree  of improvement of the community will allow; and that nothing less can  be ultimately desirable than the admission of all to a share in the  sovereign power of the state. But since all can not, in a community  exceeding a single small town, participate personally in any but some  very minor portions of the public business, it follows that the ideal  type of a perfect government must be representative.        Chapter IV--Under what Social Conditions Representative Government is Inapplicable.      We have recognized in representative government the ideal type of the  most perfect polity for which, in consequence, any portion of mankind  are better adapted in proportion to their degree of general  improvement. As they range lower and lower in development, that form  of government will be, generally speaking, less suitable to them,  though this is not true universally; for the adaptation of a people to  representative government does not depend so much upon the place they  occupy in the general scale of humanity as upon the degree in which  they possess certain special requisites; requisites, however, so  closely connected with their degree of general advancement, that any  variation between the two is rather the exception than the rule. Let  us examine at what point in the descending series representative  government ceases altogether to be admissible, either through its own  unfitness or the superior fitness of some other regimen.    First, then, representative, like any other government, must  be unsuitable in any case in which it can not permanently  subsist--_i.e._, in which it does not fulfill the three fundamental  conditions enumerated in the first chapter. These were, 1. That the  people should be willing to receive it. 2. That they should be willing  and able to do what is necessary for its preservation. 3. That they  should be willing and able to fulfill the duties and discharge the  functions which it imposes on them.    The willingness of the people to accept representative government only  becomes a practical question when an enlightened ruler, or a foreign  nation or nations who have gained power over the country, are disposed  to offer it the boon. To individual reformers the question is almost  irrelevant, since, if no other objection can be made to their  enterprise than that the opinion of the nation is not yet on their  side, they have the ready and proper answer, that to bring it over to  their side is the very end they aim at. When opinion is really  adverse, its hostility is usually to the fact of change rather than to  representative government in itself. The contrary case is not indeed  unexampled; there has sometimes been a religious repugnance to any  limitation of the power of a particular line of rulers; but, in  general, the doctrine of passive obedience meant only submission to  the will of the powers that be, whether monarchical or popular. In any  case in which the attempt to introduce representative government is at  all likely to be made, indifference to it, and inability to understand  its processes and requirements, rather than positive opposition, are  the obstacles to be expected. These, however, are as fatal, and may be  as hard to be got rid of as actual aversion; it being easier, in most  cases, to change the direction of an active"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5694"],[0,"The Harvard Classics Volume 38 (#12)"],[1,"he with me; as he has shown  me since. He wrote a letter to M. le Duc d' Ascot, how he was  healed of his wound, and also M. de Bassompierre of his, and many  others whom I had dressed after the battle of Moncontour; and  advised him to ask the King of France to let me visit M. le  Marquis d' Auret, his brother: which he did.          THE JOURNEY TO FLANDERS. 1569      M. le Duc d' Ascot did not fail to send a gentleman to the King,  with a letter humbly asking he would do him so much kindness and  honour as to permit and command his chief surgeon to visit M. le  Marquis d' Auret, his brother, who had received a gunshot wound  near the knee, with fracture of the bone, about seven months ago,  and the physicians and surgeons all this time had not been able  to heal him. The King sent for me and bade me go and see M. d'  Auret, and give him all the help I could, to heal him of his  wound. I told him I would employ all the little knowledge it had  pleased God to give me.    I went off, escorted by two gentlemen, to the Chateau d' Auret,  which is a league and a half from Mons in Hainault, where M. le  Marquis was lying. So soon as I had come, I visited him, and told  him the King had commanded me to come and see him and dress his  wound. He said he was very glad I had come, and was much beholden  to the King, who had done him so much honour as to send me to  him.    I found him in a high fever, his eyes deep sunken, with a  moribund and yellowish face, his tongue dry and parched, and the  whole body much wasted and lean, the voice low as of a man very  near death: and I found his thigh much inflamed, suppurating, and  ulcerated, discharging a greenish and very offensive sanies. I  probed it with a silver probe, wherewith I found a large cavity  in the middle of the thigh, and others round the knee, sanious  and cuniculate: also several scales of bone, some loose, others  not. The leg was greatly swelled, and imbued with a pituitous  humor ... and bent and drawn back. There was a large bedsore; he  could rest neither day nor night; and had no appetite to eat, but  very thirsty. I was told he often fell into a faintness of the  heart, and sometimes as in epilepsy: and often he felt sick, with  such trembling he could not carry his hands to his mouth. Seeing  and considering all these great complications, and the vital  powers thus broken down, truly I was very sorry I had come to  him, because it seemed to me there was little hope he would  escape death. All the same, to give him courage and good hope, I  told him I would soon set him on his legs, by the grace of God,  and the help of his physicians and surgeons.    Having seen him, I went a walk in a garden, and prayed God He  would show me this grace, that he should recover; and that He  would bless our hands and our medicaments, to fight such a  complication of diseases. I discussed in my mind the means I must  take to do this. They called me to dinner. I came into the  kitchen, and there I saw, taken out of a great pot, half a sheep,  a quarter of veal, three great pieces of beef, two fowls, and a  very big piece of bacon, with abundance of good herbs: then I  said to myself that the broth of the pot would be full of juices,  and very nourishing.    After dinner, we began our consultation, all the physicians and  surgeons together, in the presence of M. le Duc d' Ascot and some  gentlemen who were with him. I began to say to the surgeons that  I was astonished they had not made incisions in M. le Marquis'  thigh, seeing that it was all suppurating, and the thick matter  in it very foetid and offensive, showing it had long been pent up  there; and that I had found with the probe caries of the bone,  and scales of bone, which were already loose. They answered me:  \"Never would he consent to it\"; indeed, it was near two months  since they had been able to get leave to put clean sheets on his  bed; and one scarce dared touch the coverlet, so great was his  pain. Then I said, \"To heal him, we must touch something else  than the coverlet of his bed.\" Each said what he thought of the  malady of the patient, and in conclusion they all held it  hopeless. I told them there was still some hope, because he was  young, and God and Nature sometimes do things which seem to  physicians and surgeons impossible.    To restore the warmth and nourishment of the body, general  frictions must be made with hot cloths, above, below, to right,  to left, and around, to draw the blood and the vital spirits from  within outward. ... For the bedsore, he must be put in a fresh,  soft bed, with clean shirt and sheets... Having discoursed of the  causes and complications of his malady, I said we must cure them  by their contraries; and must first ease the pain, making  openings in the thigh to let out the matter. ... Secondly, having  regard to the great swelling and coldness of the limb, we must  apply hot bricks round it, and sprinkle them with a decoction of  nerval herbs in wine and vinegar, and wrap them in napkins; and  to his feet, an earthenware bottle filled with the decoction,  corked, and wrapped in cloths. Then the thigh, and the whole of  the leg, must be fomented with a decoction made of sage,  rosemary, thyme, lavender, flowers of chamomile and melilot, red  roses boiled in white wine, with a drying powder made of oak--  ashes and a little vinegar and half a handful of salt. ...  Thirdly, we must apply to the bedsore a large plaster made of the  desiccative red ointment and of Unguentum Comitissoe, equal  parts, mixed together, to ease his pain and dry the ulcer; and he  must have a little pillow of down, to keep all pressure off it.  ... And for the strengthening of his heart, we must apply over it  a refrigerant of oil of waterlilies, ointment of roses, and a  little saffron, dissolved in rose-vinegar and treacle, spread on  a piece of red cloth. For the syncope, from exhaustion of the  natural forces, troubling the brain, he must have good  nourishment full of juices, as raw eggs, plums stewed in wine and  sugar, broth of the meat of the great pot, whereof I have already  spoken; the white meat of fowls, partridges' wings minced small,  and other roast meats easy to digest, as veal, kid, pigeons,  partridges, thrushes, and the like, with sauce of orange,  verjuice, sorrel, sharp pomegranates; or he may have them boiled  with good herbs, as lettuce, purslain, chicory, bugloss,  marigold, and the like. At night he can take barley-water, with  juice of sorrel and of waterlilies, of each two ounces, with four  or five grains of opium, and the four cold seeds crushed, of each  half an ounce; which is a good nourishing remedy and will make  him sleep. His bread to be farmhouse bread, neither too stale nor  too fresh. For the great pain in his head, his hair must be cut,  and his head rubbed with rose-vinegar just warm, and a double  cloth steeped in it and put there; also a forehead-cloth, of oil  of roses and water-lilies and poppies, and a little opium and  rose-vinegar, with a little camphor, and changed from time to  time. Moreover, we must allow him to smell flowers of henbane and  water-lilies, bruised with vinegar and rose-water, with a little  camphor, all wrapped in a handkerchief, to be held some time to  his nose. ... And we must make artificial rain, pouring water  from some high place into a cauldron, that he may hear the sound  of it; by which means sleep shall be provoked on him. As for the  contraction of his leg, there is hope of righting it when we have  let out the pus and other humors pent up in the thigh, and have  rubbed the whole knee with ointment of mallows, and oil of  lilies, and a little eau-de-vie, and wrapped it in black wool  with the grease left in it; and if we put under the knee a  feather pillow doubled, little by little we shall straighten the  leg.    This my discourse was well approved by the physicians and  surgeons.    The consultation ended, we went back to the patient, and I made  three openings in his thigh. ... Two or three hours later, I got  a bed made near his old one, with fair white sheets on it; then a  strong man put him in it, and he was thankful to be taken out of  his foul stinking bed. Soon after, he asked to sleep; which he  did for near four hours; and everybody in the house began to feel  happy, and especially M. le Duc d' Ascot, his brother.    The following days, I made injections, into the depth and  cavities of the ulcers, of Aegyptiacum dissolved sometimes in  eau-de-vie, other times in wine, I applied compresses to the  bottom of the sinuous tracks, to cleanse and dry the soft spongy  flesh, and hollow leaden tents, that the sanies might always have  a way out; and above them a large plaster of Diacalcitheos  dissolved in wine. And I bandaged him so skilfully that he had no  pain; and when the pain was gone, the fever began at once to  abate. Then I gave him wine to drink moderately tempered with  water, knowing it would restore and quicken the vital forces. And  all that we agreed in consultation was done in due time and  order; and so soon as his pains and fever ceased, he began  steadily to amend. He dismissed two of his surgeons, and one of  his physicians, so that we were but three with him.    Now I stopped there about two months, not without seeing many  patients, both rich and poor, who came to me from three or four  leagues round. He gave food and drink to the needy, and commended  them all to me, asking me to help them for his sake. I protest I  refused not one, and did for them all I could, to his great  pleasure. Then, when I saw him beginning to be well, I told him  we must have viols and violins, and a buffoon to make him laugh:  which he did. In one month, we got him into a chair, and he had  himself carried about in his garden and at the door of his  chateau, to see everybody passing by.    The villagers of two or three leagues round, now they could have  sight of him, came on holidays to sing and "]]]
