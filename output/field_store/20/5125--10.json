He seems  always anxious that his old master should know how he fared, especially  hear of his success. His sentiments regarding Elsner reveal themselves  perhaps nowhere more strikingly than in an incidental remark which  escapes him when writing to his friend Woyciechowski. Speaking of a new  acquaintance he has made, he says, \"He is a great friend of Elsner's,  which in my estimation means much.\" No doubt Chopin looked up with more  respect and thought himself more indebted to Elsner than to Zywny; but  that he had a good opinion of both his masters is evident from his pithy  reply to the Viennese gentleman who told him that people were astonished  at his having learned all he knew at Warsaw: \"From Messrs. Zywny and  Elsner even the greatest ass must learn something.\"        CHAPTER III        FREDERICK ENTERS THE WARSAW LYCEUM.--VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL  INFLUENCES.--HIS FATHER'S FRIENDS.--RISE OF ROMANTICISM IN POLISH  LITERATURE.--FREDERICK'S STAY AT SZAFARNIA DURING HIS FIRST SCHOOL  HOLIDAYS.--HIS TALENT FOR IMPROVISATION.--HIS DEVELOPMENT AS A COMPOSER  AND PIANIST.--HIS PUBLIC PERFORMANCES.--PUBLICATION OF OP. I.--EARLY  COMPOSITIONS.--HIS PIANOFORTE STYLE.        FREDERICK, who up to the age of fifteen was taught at home along with  his father's boarders, became in 1824 a pupil of the Warsaw Lyceum, a  kind of high-school, the curriculum of which comprised Latin, Greek,  modern languages, mathematics, history, &c. His education was so  far advanced that he could at once enter the fourth class, and the  liveliness of his parts, combined with application to work, enabled him  to distinguish himself in the following years as a student and to carry  off twice a prize. Polish history and literature are said to have been  his favourite studies.    Liszt relates that Chopin was placed at an early age in one of the first  colleges of Warsaw, \"thanks to the generous and intelligent protection  which Prince Anton Radziwill always bestowed upon the arts and upon  young men of talent.\" This statement, however, has met with a direct  denial on the part of the Chopin family, and may, therefore, be  considered as disposed of. But even without such a denial the statement  would appear suspicious to all but those unacquainted with Nicholas  Chopin's position. Surely he must have been able to pay for his son's  schooling! Moreover, one would think that, as a professor at the Lyceum,  he might even have got it gratis. As to Frederick's musical education  in Warsaw, it cannot have cost much. And then, how improbable that the  Prince should have paid the comparatively trifling school-fees and left  the young man when he went abroad dependent upon the support of his  parents! The letters from Vienna (1831) show unmistakably that Chopin  applied to his father repeatedly for money, and regretted being such a  burden to him. Further, Chopin's correspondence, which throws much light  on his relation to Prince Radziwili, contains nothing which would lead  one to infer any such indebtedness as Liszt mentions. But in order that  the reader may be in possession of the whole evidence and able to judge  for himself, I shall place before him Liszt's curiously circumstantial  account in its entirety:--       The Prince bestowed upon him the inappreciable gift of a good     education, no part of which remained neglected. His elevated     mind enabling him to understand the exigencies of an artist's     career, he, from the time of his protege's entering the     college to the entire completion of his studies, paid the     pension through the agency of a friend, M. Antoine     Korzuchowski, [FOOTNOTE: Liszt should have called this     gentleman Adam Kozuchowski.] who always maintained cordial     relations and a constant friendship with Chopin.    Liszt's informant was no doubt Chopin's Paris friend Albert Grzymala,  [FOOTNOTE: M. Karasowski calls this Grzymala erroneously Francis. More  information about this gentleman will be given in a subsequent chapter.]  who seems to have had no connection with the Chopin family in Poland.  Karasowski thinks that the only foundation of the story is a letter and  present from Prince Radziwill--acknowledgments of the dedication to him  of the Trio, Op. 8--which Adam Kozuchowski brought to Chopin in 1833.  [FOOTNOTE: M. Karasowski, Fryderyk Chopin, vol. i., p. 65.]    Frederick was much liked by his school-fellows, which, as his manners  and disposition were of a nature thoroughly appreciated by boys, is  not at all to be wondered at. One of the most striking features in  the character of young Chopin was his sprightliness, a sparkling  effervescence that manifested itself by all sorts of fun and mischief.  He was never weary of playing pranks on his sisters, his comrades,  and even on older people, and indulged to the utmost his fondness for  caricaturing by pictorial and personal imitations. In the course of a  lecture the worthy rector of the Lyceum discovered the scapegrace making  free with the face and figure of no less a person than his own rectorial  self. Nevertheless the irreverent pupil got off easily, for the master,  with as much magnanimity as wisdom, abstained from punishing the  culprit, and, in a subscript which he added to the caricature, even  praised the execution of it. A German Protestant pastor at Warsaw, who  made always sad havoc of the Polish language, in which he had every  Sunday to preach one of his sermons, was the prototype of one of the  imitations with which Frederick frequently amused his friends. Our  hero's talent for changing the expression of his face, of which  George Sand, Liszt, Balzac, Hiller, Moscheles, and other personal  acquaintances, speak with admiration, seems already at this time to have  been extraordinary. Of the theatricals which the young folks were wont  to get up at the paternal house, especially on the name-days of their  parents and friends, Frederick was the soul and mainstay. With a good  delivery he combined a presence of mind that enabled him to be always  ready with an improvisation when another player forgot his part. A  clever Polish actor, Albert Piasecki, who was stage-manager on these  occasions, gave it as his opinion that the lad was born to be a great  actor. In after years two distinguished members of the profession in  France, M. Bocage and Mdme. Dorval, expressed similar opinions. For  their father's name-day in 1824, Frederick and his sister Emilia wrote  conjointly a one-act comedy in verse, entitled THE MISTAKE; OR, THE  PRETENDED ROGUE, which was acted by a juvenile company. According to  Karasowski, the play showed that the authors had a not inconsiderable  command of language, but in other respects could not be called a very  brilliant achievement. Seeing that fine comedies are not often written  at the ages of fifteen and eleven, nobody will be in the least surprised  at the result.    These domestic amusements naturally lead us to inquire who were the  visitors that frequented the house. Among them there was Dr. Samuel  Bogumil Linde, rector of the Lyceum and first librarian of the National  Library, a distinguished philologist, who, assisted by the best Slavonic  scholars, wrote a valuable and voluminous \"Dictionary of the Polish  Language,\" and published many other works on the Slavonic languages.  After this oldest of Nicholas Chopin's friends I shall mention Waclaw  Alexander Maciejowski, who, like Linde, received his university  education in Germany, taught then for a short time at the Lyceum,  and became in 1819 a professor at the University of Warsaw. His  contributions to various branches of Slavonic history (law, literature,  &c.) are very numerous. However, one of the most widely known of those  who were occasionally seen at Chopin's home was Casimir Brodzinski, the  poet, critic, and champion of romanticism, a prominent figure in Polish  literary history, who lived in Warsaw from about 1815 to 1822, in which  year he went as professor of literature to the University of Cracow.  Nicholas Chopin's pupil, Count Frederick Skarbek, must not be forgotten;  he had now become a man of note, being professor of political economy at  the university, and author of several books that treat of that science.  Besides Elsner and Zywny, who have already been noticed at some  length, a third musician has to be numbered among friends of the Chopin  family--namely, Joseph Javurek, the esteemed composer and professor at  the Conservatorium; further, I must yet make mention of Anton Barcinski,  professor at the Polytechnic School, teacher at Nicholas Chopin's  institution, and by-and-by his son-in-law; Dr. Jarocki, the zoologist;  Julius Kolberg, the engineer; and Brodowski, the painter. These and  others, although to us only names, or little more, are nevertheless not  without their significance. We may liken them to the supernumeraries on  the stage, who, dumb as they are, help to set off and show the position  of the principal figure or figures.    The love of literature which we have noticed in the young Chopins, more  particularly in the sisters, implanted by an excellent education and  fostered by the taste, habits, and encouragement of their father, cannot  but have been greatly influenced and strengthened by the characters and  conversation of such visitors. And let it not be overlooked that  this was the time of Poland's intellectual renascence--a time when the  influence of man over man is greater than at other times, he being, as  it were, charged with a kind of vivifying electricity. The  misfortunes that had passed over Poland had purified and fortified the  nation--breathed into it a new and healthier life. The change which the  country underwent from the middle of the eighteenth to the earlier  part of the nineteenth century was indeed immense. Then Poland, to  use Carlyle's drastic phraseology, had ripened into a condition  of \"beautifully"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4974"],[0,"Australia Twice Traversed (#12)"],[1," and caverns exist in the sides of the hills.    A few trees of the cypress pine (Callitris) were seen upon the summits  of the higher mounts. The hills and country generally seen in this  glen are more fertile than those outside, having real grass instead of  triodia upon their sides. I saw two or three natives just before  camping; they kept upon the opposite side of the water, according to a  slight weakness of theirs. Just at the time I saw them, I had my eye  on some ducks upon the water in the river bed, I therefore determined  to kill two birds with one stone; that is to say, to shoot the ducks  and astonish the natives at the same time. I got behind a tree, the  natives I could see were watching me most intently the while, and  fired. Two ducks only were shot, the remainder of the birds and the  natives, apparently, flying away together. Our travels to-day were  very agreeable; the day was fine, the breezes cool, and the scenery  continually changing, the river taking the most sinuous windings  imaginable; the bed of it, as might be expected in such a glen, is  rough and stony, and the old fear of the horses bogging has departed  from us. By bearings back upon hills at the mouth of the glen I found  our course was nearly north 23 degrees west. The night was clear and  cold; the stars, those sentinels of the sky, appeared intensely  bright. To the explorer they must ever be objects of admiration and  love, as to them he is indebted for his guidance through the untrodden  wilderness he is traversing. \"And sweet it is to watch them in the  evening skies weeping dew from their gentle eyes.\" Several hundred  pelicans, those antediluvian birds, made their appearance upon the  water early this morning, but seeing us they flew away before a shot  could be fired. These birds came from the north-west; indeed, all the  aquatic birds that I have seen upon the wing, come and go in that  direction. I am in hopes of getting through this glen to-day, for  however wild and picturesque the scenery, it is very difficult and bad  travelling for the unshod horses; consequently it is difficult to get  them along. There was no other road to follow than the windings of the  river bed through this mountain-bound glen, in the same manner as  yesterday. Soon after starting, I observed several natives ahead of  us; immediately upon their discovering us they raised a great outcry,  which to our ears did not exactly resemble the agreeable vibration of  the melodious sound, it being quite the opposite. Then of course  signal fires were made which raised great volumes of smoke, the  natives thinking perhaps to intimidate and prevent us from farther  advance. Neither of these effects was produced, so their next idea was  to depart themselves, and they ran ahead of us up the glen. I also saw  another lot of some twenty or thirty scudding away over the rocks and  stony hills--these were probably the women and children. Passing their  last night's encampment, we saw that they had left all their valuables  behind them--these we left untouched. One old gentleman sought the  security of a shield of rock, where this villain upon earth and fiend  in upper air most vehemently apostrophised us, and probably ordered us  away out of his territory. To the command in itself we paid little  heed, but as it fell in with our own ideas, we endeavoured to carry it  out as fast as possible. This, I trust, was satisfactory, as I always  like to do what pleases others, especially when it coincides with my  own views.       \"It's a very fine thing, and delightful to see      Inclination and duty both join and agree.\"    Some of the natives near him threatened us with their spears, and  waved knobbed sticks at us, but we departed without any harm being  done on either side.    (ILLUSTRATION: THE PALM-TREE FOUND IN THE GLEN OF PALMS.)    Soon after leaving the natives, we had the gratification of  discovering a magnificent specimen of the Fan palm, a species of  Livistona, allied to one in the south of Arnhem's Land, and now  distinguished as the Maria Palm (Baron von Mueller), growing in the  channel of the watercourse with flood drifts against its stem. Its  dark-hued, dome-shaped frondage contrasted strangely with the paler  green foliage of the eucalyptus trees that surrounded it. It was a  perfectly new botanical feature to me, nor did I expect to meet it in  this latitude. \"But there's a wonderful power in latitude, it alters a  man's moral relations and attitude.\" I had noticed some strange  vegetation in the dry flood drifts lower down, and was on the qui vive  for something new, but I did not know that. This fine tree was sixty  feet long, or high, in the barrel. Passing the palms, we continued  amongst the defiles of this mountain glen, which appears to have no  termination, for no signs of a break or anything but a continuation of  the range could be observed from any of the hills I ascended.    It was late in the afternoon when we left the palm-groves, and though  we travelled over twenty miles in distance could only make twelve good  from last camp. Although this glen was rough and rocky, yet the  purling of the water over its stony bed was always a delightful sound  to me; and when the winds of evening fanned us to repose, it seemed as  though some kindly spirit whispered that it would guard us while we  slept and when the sun declined the swift stream echoed on.    The following day being Sunday, the 1st September, I made it a day of  rest, for the horses at least, whose feet were getting sore from  continued travel over rocks and boulders of stone. I made an excursion  into the hills, to endeavour to discover when and where this  apparently interminable glen ceased, for with all its grandeur,  picturesqueness, and variety, it was such a difficult road for the  horses, that I was getting heartily tired of it; besides this, I  feared this range might be its actual source, and that I should find  myself eventually blocked and stopped by impassable water-choked  gorges, and that I should finally have to retreat to where I first  entered it. I walked and climbed over several hills, cliffs, and  precipices, of red sandstone, to the west of the camp, and at length  reached the summit of a pine-clad mountain considerably higher than  any other near it. Its elevation was over 1000 feet above the level of  the surrounding country. From it I obtained a view to all points of  the compass except the west, and could descry mountains, from the  north-east round by north to the north-north west, at which point a  very high and pointed mount showed its top above the others in its  neighbourhood, over fifty miles away. To the north and east of north a  massive chain, with many dome-shaped summits, was visible. Below,  towards the camp, I could see the channel of the river where it forced  its way under the perpendicular sides of the hills, and at a spot not  far above the camp it seemed split in two, or rather was joined by  another watercourse from the northwards. From the junction the course  of the main stream was more directly from the west. Along the course  of the tributary at about ten miles I could see an apparently open  piece of country, and with the glasses there appeared a sheet of water  upon it. I was glad to find a break in the chain, though it was not on  the line I should travel. Returning to my companions, I imparted to  them the result of my observations.    On Monday, the 2nd, there was a heaviness in the atmosphere that felt  like approaching rain. The thermometer during the night had not fallen  below 60 degrees; over 4 degrees higher than at our first night's camp  from the pillar. To-day, again following the mazy windings of the  glen, we passed the northern tributary noticed yesterday, and  continued on over rocks, under precipices, crossing and re-crossing  the channel, and turning to all points of the compass, so that nearly  three miles had to be travelled to make good one. Clumps of the  beautiful palms were occasionally passed, growing mostly in the river  bed, and where they appear, they considerably enliven the scenery.  During my sojourn in this glen, and indeed from first starting, I  collected a great number of most beautiful flowers, which grow in  profusion in this otherwise desolate glen. I was literally surrounded  by fair flowers of every changing hue. Why Nature should scatter such  floral gems upon such a stony sterile region it is difficult to  understand, but such a variety of lovely flowers of every kind and  colour I had never met with previously. Nature at times, indeed,  delights in contrasts, for here exists a land \"where bright flowers  are all scentless, and songless bright birds.\" The flowers alone would  have induced me to name this Glen Flora; but having found in it also  so many of the stately palm trees, I have called it the Glen of Palms.  Peculiar indeed, and romantic too, is this new-found watery glen,  enclosed by rocky walls, \"Where dial-like, to portion time, the  palm-tree's shadow falls.\"    While we were travelling to-day, a few slight showers fell, giving us  warning in their way that heavier falls might come. We were most  anxious to reach the northern mouth of the glen if possible before  night, so heartily tired were we of so continuously serpentine a  track; we therefore kept pushing on. We saw several natives to-day,  but they invariably fled to the fastnesses of their mountain homes,  they raised great volumes of smoke, and their strident vociferations  caused a dull and buzzing sound even when out of ear-shot. The  pattering of the rain-drops became heavier, yet we kept on, hoping at  every turn to see an opening which would free us from our  prison-house; but night and heavier rain together came, and we were  compelled to remain another night in the palmy glen. I found a small  sloping, sandy, firm piece of ground, probably the only one in the  glen, a little off from the creek, having"]]]
