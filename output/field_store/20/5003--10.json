Not meaning to disparage any       one in order by odious comparisons to extol him, I deem       his Naval History a more valuable and enduring       historical work than many others, both English and       American, of contemporaneous publication and much wider       dissemination. In short, if the gentlemen whose names I       have seen in the public journals with yours, proposing       some concentrated eulogium, should determine to appoint       a suitable person, with time to prepare it, I believe       that Fenimore Cooper may be made the subject of       illustration in very many and most striking lights,       justly reflecting him, and with excellent influence on       his country.         I do not recollect, from what I read lately in the       newspapers, precisely what you and the other gentlemen       associated with you in this proceeding propose to do,       or whether any thing is to take place. But if so,       whatever and wherever it may be, I beg you to use this       answer to your invitation, and any services I can       render, as cordial contributions, which I shall be       proud and happy to make. I am very respectfully your       humble servant,                                  C. J. INGERSOLL.         Rev. RUFUS W. GRISWOLD.    _From G. P. R. James._                          STOCKBRIDGE, Mass., 23d September, 1851.         DEAR DOCTOR GRISWOLD:--I regret extremely that it will       not be in my power to be present at the meeting to       testify respect for the memory of Mr. Cooper. I grieve       sincerely that so eminent a man is lost to the country       and the world; and though unacquainted with him       personally, I need hardly tell you how highly his       abilities as an author, and his character, were       appreciated by yours faithfully,                                  G. P. R. JAMES.    _From Mr. Everett._                                  CAMBRIDGE, 23d September, 1851.         DEAR SIR:--I received this afternoon your favor of the       17th, inviting me to attend and participate in the       meeting to be held in your City Hall, for the purpose       of doing honor to the memory of the late Mr. Fenimore       Cooper.         I sincerely regret that I cannot be with you. The state       of the weather puts it out of my power to make the       journey. The object of the meeting has my entire       sympathy. The works of Mr. Cooper have adorned and       elevated our literature. There is nothing more purely       American, in the highest sense of the word, than       several of them. In his department he is _facile       princeps_. He wrote too much to write every thing       equally well; but his abundance flowed out of a full,       original mind, and his rapidity and variety bespoke a       resolute and manly consciousness of power. If among his       works there were some which, had he been longer spared       to us, he would himself, on reconsideration, have       desired to recal, there are many more which the latest       posterity \"will not willingly let die.\"         With much about him that was intensely national, we       have but one other writer (Mr. Irving), as widely known       abroad. Many of Cooper's novels were not only read at       every fireside in England, but were translated into       every language of the European continent.         He owed a part of his inspiration to the magnificent       nature which surrounded him; to the lakes, and forests,       and Indian traditions, and border-life of your great       state. It would have been as difficult to create       Leatherstocking anywhere out of New-York, or some state       closely resembling it, as to create Don Quixotte out of       Spain. To have trained and possessed Fenimore Cooper       will be--is already--with justice, one of your greatest       boasts. But we cannot let you monopolize the care of       his memory. We have all rejoiced in his genius; we have       all felt the fascination of his pen; we all deplore his       loss. You must allow us all to join you in doing honor       to the name of our great American novelist. I remain,       dear sir, with great respect, very truly yours,                                  EDWARD EVERETT.         Rev. RUFUS W. GRISWOLD.    Letters of similar import were received from Richard H. Dana, George  Ticknor, William H. Prescott, John Neal, and many other eminent men, all  approving the design to render the highest honors to the illustrious  deceased.    At the meeting of the New-York Historical Society, on the evening of  Tuesday, the 7th of October, after the transaction of the regular business,  the following resolutions were moved by Rev. Rufus W. Griswold, and  seconded by Mr. George Bancroft:--         _Whereas_, It has pleased Almighty God to remove from       this life our illustrious associate and countryman,       JAMES FENIMORE COOPER, while his fame was in its       fulness, and his intelligence was still unclouded by       age or any infirmity, therefore:         Resolved, That this society has heard of the death of       James Fenimore Cooper with profound regret:         That it recognizes in him an eminent subject and a       masterly illustrator of our history:         That, in his contributions to our literature he       displayed eminent genius and a truly national spirit:         That, in his personal character, he was honorable,       brave, sincere, and generous, as respectable for       unaffected virtue as he was distinguished for great       capacities:         That this society, appreciating the loss which,       however heavily it has fallen upon this country and       the literary world, has fallen most heavily upon his       family, instructs its officers to convey to his family,       assurances of respectful sympathy and condolence.    Dr. JOHN W. FRANCIS addressed the society in a very interesting speech, in  support of these resolutions. Among the great men of letters, he said, whom  our country has produced, there were none greater than Mr. Cooper. I knew  him for a period of thirty years, and during all that time I never knew any  thing of his character that was not in the highest degree praiseworthy. He  was a man of great decision of character, and a fair expositor of his own  thoughts on every occasion--a thorough American, for I never knew a man who  was more entirely so in heart and principle. He was able, with his vast  knowledge, and a powerful physical structure, to complete whatever he  attempted. He had studied the history of this country with a large  philosophy, and understood our people and their character better than any  other writer of the age. He was not only perfectly acquainted with our  general history, but was thoroughly conversant with that of every state,  county, village, lake, and river. And with his vast knowledge he was no  less remarkable for ability as a historian than for his intrepidity of  personal character. I could not, said Dr. Francis, allow this opportunity  to pass without paying my tribute to the merits of this truly great man.    Mr. GEORGE BANCROFT next addressed the society. My friend, he said, has  spoken of the illustrious deceased as an American--I say that he was an  embodiment of the American feeling, and truly illustrated American  greatness. We were endeavoring to hold up our heads before the world, and  to claim a character and an intellect of our own, when Cooper appeared with  his powerful genius to support our pretensions. He came forth imbued with  American life, and feeling, and sentiment. Another like Cooper cannot  appear, for he was peculiarly suited to his time, which was that of an  invading civilization. The fame and honor which he gained, were not  obtained by obsequious deference to public opinion, but simply by his great  ability and manly character. Great as he was in the department of romantic  fiction, he was not less deserving of praise in that of history. In Lionel  Lincoln he has described the battle of Bunker Hill better than it is  described in any other work.    In his naval history of the United States he has left us the most masterly  composition of which any nation could boast on a similar subject. Mr.  Bancroft proceeded in a masterly analysis of some of Mr. Cooper's  characters, and ended with an impressive assertion of the purity of his  contributions to our literature, the eminence of his genius, and the  dignity of his personal character.    Dr. HAWKS spoke with his customary eloquence of the personal character of  Mr. Cooper, his indefectible integrity, his devotion to the best interests  of his country, and his religious spirit. He approved the resolutions which  had been offered to the society.    The Rev. SAMUEL OSGOOD said:         It must seem presumptuous in me, Mr. President, to try       to add any thing to the tribute which has been paid to       the memory of Cooper, by gentlemen so peculiarly       qualified from their experience and position to speak       of the man and his services. But all professions have       their own point of view, and I may be allowed to say a       few words upon the relation of our great novelist to       the historical associations and moral standards of our       nation. I cannot claim more than a passing acquaintance       with the deceased, and it belongs to friends more       favored to interpret the asperities and illustrate the       amenities which are likely to mark the character of a       man so decided in his make and habit. With his position       as an interpreter of American history and a delineator       of American character, we are in this society most       closely concerned. None in this presence, I am sure,       will rebuke me for speaking of the novelist as among       the most important agents of popular education,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37937"],[0,"A Wanderer in Paris (#12)"],[1,"opposite, in a  doorway, I watched an old chiffonniere playing with a grey rabbit.  Every inch of this neighbourhood offers priceless material to the hand  of Mr. Muirhead Bone.    One of the old tavern signs of Paris is to be seen close by, at the  corner of the Rue des Blancs-Manteaux and the Rue des Archives: a  soldier standing by a cannon, representing l'homme arme. It is a  comfortable little retreat and should be encouraged for such  antiquarian piety.    The pretty turret at the corner of the Rue des Francs Bourgeois and  the Rue Vieille du Temple marks the site of the hotel of Jean de la  Balue. Turning to the left up the Rue Vieille du Temple we come at No.  87 to a very beautiful ancient mansion, with a spacious courtyard,  built in 1712 for the Cardinal de Rohan. It is now the national  printing works: hence the statue of Gutenberg in the midst. Visitors  are allowed to see the house itself once a week, but I have not done  so. You will probably not be interfered with if you just step to the  inside of the second courtyard to see the bas-relief of the steeds of  Apollo. Nos. 102 to 108 in the same street mark the remains of another  fine eighteenth-century hotel. There is also a house which one should  see in the lower part of the street, on the south side of the Francs  Bourgeois--No. 47, where by penetrating boldly one comes to a perfect  little courtyard with some beautiful carvings in it, and, above, a  green garden, tended, when I was there, by a Little Sister of the  Poor. The principal courtyard has a very interesting bas-relief of  Romulus and Remus at their usual meal, and also an old sundial. This  palace was built in 1638.    Returning to the Rue des Francs Bourgeois, we find at No. 38 the  little impasse already referred to, where the Duc d'Orleans was  assassinated. At No. 30 is a very impressive red-brick palace with a  courtyard, now a nest of offices and factories, once the hotel of Jean  de Fourcy. A bust of Henri IV. has a place there. At No. 25 on the  other side (seen better from the Rue Pavee) is an even more splendid  abode--now also cut up into a rookery--the Hotel de Lamoignon, once  Hotel d'Angouleme, built for Diane, Duchess of Angouleme, daughter of  Henri II.: hence the symbols of the chase in the ornamentation. The  hotel passed to President de Lamoignon in 1655.    And here is the Carnavalet--the spacious building, with a garden and  modern additions, on the left--once the Hotel des Ligneries,  afterwards the Hotel de Kernevenoy, afterwards the Hotel de Sevigne,  and now the museum of the city of Paris. The only way to understand  Paris is to make repeated visits to this treasure-house. You will find  new entertainment and instruction every time, because every time you  will carry thither impressions of new objects of interest whose past  you will want to explore. For in the Carnavalet every phase of the  life of the city, from the days of the Romans and the Merovingians to  our own, is illustrated in one way or another. The pictures of streets  alone are inexhaustible: the streets that one knows to-day as they  were yesterday and the day before yesterday and hundreds of years ago;  the streets one has just walked through on the way here, in their  stages of evolution: such, for example, as the picture of the wooden  Pont des Meuniers in 1380 with the Tour Saint-Jacques behind it; the  streets with dramas of the Revolution in progress, such as the picture  of the emblems of Royalty being burned before the statue of Liberty  (where the Luxor column now stands) in the Place de la Concorde on  August 10th, 1793; such as the picture of the famous \"serment\" being  taken in the court of the Jeu de Paume on June 20th, 1789; such as the  picture of the funeral of Marat. For the perfection of topographical  drawing look at the series by F. Hoffbauer. But it is impossible and  needless to particularise. The visitor with a topographical or  historical bent will find himself in a paradise and will return and  return. One visit is ridiculous.    The catalogue, I may say, is not good, therein falling into line with  the sculpture catalogue at the Louvre. Everything may be in it, but  the arrangement is poor. In such a museum every article and every  picture should of course have a description attached, if only for the  benefit of the poor visitor, the humblest citizen of Paris whose  museum it is.    There are a few works of art here too, as well as topographical  drawings. Georges Michel, for example, who looked on landscape much as  Meryon looked on architecture and preferred a threatening sky to a  sunny one, has a prospect from the Plaine St. Denis. Vollon paints the  Moulin de la Galette on Montmartre as it was in 1865; Troyon spreads  out St. Cloud. Here also are a charming portrait by Chardin of his  second wife; the well-known picture of David's Life School; drawings  by Watteau; an adorable unsigned \"Marchand de Lingerie\"; an enchanting  leg on a blue pillow by Boucher; a portrait by Prud'hon of an  unknown man, very striking; and some exquisite work by Louis Boilly.      [Illustration: PORTRAIT DE JEUNE HOMME      ATTRIBUTED TO BIGIO      _(Louvre)_]    The Musee is strong in Henri IV. and the later Louis, but it is of  course in relics of the Revolution and Napoleon that the interest  centres. A casquette of Liberty; the handle of Marat's bathroom; a  portrait of \"La Veuve Capet\" in the Conciergerie, in the room that we  have seen; a painted life-mask of Voltaire, very horrible, and the  armchair in which he died; a copy of the constitution of 1793 bound in  the skin of a man; Marat's snuff-box; Madame Roland as a sweet and  happy child,--these I remember in particular.    Latude is, however, the popular figure--Latude the prisoner of the  Bastille who escaped by means of implements which he made secretly and  which are now preserved here, near a portrait of the enfranchised  gentleman, robust, portly and triumphant, pointing with one hand to  his late prison while the other grasps the rope ladder. Latude's  history is an odd one. He was born in 1725, the natural son of a poor  girl: after accompanying the army in Languedoc as a surgeon, or  surgeon's assistant, he reached Paris in 1748 and proceeded to starve.  In despair he hit upon an ingenious trick, which wanted nothing but  success to have made him. He prepared an infernal machine of  infinitesimal aptitude--a contrivance of practically harmless but  perhaps somewhat alarming explosives--and this he sent anonymously to  the Marquise de Pompadour, and then immediately after waited upon her  in person at Versailles to say that he had overheard some men plotting  to destroy her by means of this kind of a bomb, and he had come  post-haste to warn her and save her life. It was a good story, but  Latude seems to have lacked some necessary gifts as an impostor, for  his own share was detected and he was thrown into the Bastille on the  1st of May, 1749. A few weeks later he was transferred to the prison  at Vincennes, from which he escaped in 1750. A month later he was  retaken and again placed in the Bastille, from which he escaped six  years later. He got away to Holland, but was quickly recaptured; and  then again he escaped, after nine more years. He was then treated as a  lunatic and put into confinement at Charenton, but was discharged in  1777. His liberty, however, seems to have been of little use to him,  and he rapidly qualified for gaol again by breaking into a house and  threatening its owner, a woman, with a pistol, and he was imprisoned  once more. Altogether he was under lock and key for the greater part  of thirty-five years; but once he was free in 1784 he kept his head,  and not only remained free but became a popular hero, and did not a  little, by reason of a heightened account of his sufferings under  despotic prison rule, to inflame the revolutionaries. These memoirs,  by the way, in the preparation of which he was assisted by an advocate  named Thiery, were for the most part untruthful, and not least so in  those passages in which Latude described his own innocence and  ideals. Our own canonised prison-breaker, Jack Sheppard, was a better  hero than this man.    The little room devoted to Napoleon is filled with an intimate  melancholy. Many personal relics are here--even to a toothbrush dipped  in a red powder. His necessaires de campagne so compactly arranged  illustrate the minute orderliness of his mind, and the workmanship of  the travelling cases that hold them proves once again his thoroughness  and taste. Everything had to be right. One of his maps of la campagne  de Prusse is here; others we shall see at the Invalides.    The relics of Madame de Sevigne, who once lived in this beautiful  house, are not very numerous; but they exercise their spell. Her salon  is very much as she left it, except that the private staircase has  disappeared and a china closet takes its place. Within these walls  have La Rochefoucauld and Bossuet conversed; here she sat, pen in  hand, writing her immortal letters. \"Lisons tout Madame de Sevigne\"  was the advice of Sainte-Beuve, while her most illustrious English  admirer, Edward FitzGerald, often quotes her. He came to her late, not  till 1875, but she never loosened her hold. \"I have this Summer,\" he  wrote to Mrs. W. H. Thompson, \"made the Acquaintance of a great Lady,  with whom I have become perfectly intimate, through her Letters,  Madame de Sevigne. I had hitherto kept aloof from her, because of that  eternal Daughter of hers; but 'it's all Truth and Daylight,' as Kitty  Clive said of Mrs. Siddons. Her Letters from Brittany are best of all,  not those from Paris, for she loved the Country, dear Creature; and  now I want to go and visit her 'Rochers,' but never shall.\" \"I  sometimes lament,\" he says (to Mrs. Cowell), \"I did not know her  before; but perhaps such an acquaintance comes in best to cheer one  toward the end.\" With these pleasant praises in our "]]]
