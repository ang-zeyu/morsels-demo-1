But what is the matter now, Valletort? Why  stand you there gazing upon the common, as if the victim of your  murderous aim was rising from his bloody couch, to reproach you with  his death? Tell me, shall I write to Clara for the prize, or will you  receive it from her own hands?\"    \"Bid her rather pour her curses on my head; and to those, De Haldimar,  add your own,\" exclaimed Sir Everard, at length raising himself from  the statue-like position he had assumed. \"Almighty God,\" he pursued, in  the same tone of deep agony, \"what have I done? Where, where shall I  hide myself?\"    As he spoke he turned away from his companions, and covering his eyes  with his hand, with quick and unequal steps, even like those of a  drunken man, walked, or rather ran, along the rampart, as if fearful of  being overtaken.    The whole group of officers, and Charles de Haldimar in particular,  were struck with dismay at the language and action of Sir Everard; and  for a moment they fancied that fatigue, and watching, and excitement,  had partially affected his brain. But when, after the lapse of a minute  or two, they again looked out upon the common, the secret of his  agitation was too faithfully and too painfully explained.    What had at first the dusky and dingy hue of a half-naked Indian, was  now perceived, by the bright beams of light just gathering in the east,  to be the gay and striking uniform of a British officer. Doubt as to  who that officer was there could be none, for the white sword-belt  suspended over the right shoulder, and thrown into strong relief by the  field of scarlet on which it reposed, denoted the wearer of this  distinguishing badge of duty to be one of the guard.    To comprehend effectually the feelings of the officers, it would be  necessary that one should have been not merely a soldier, but a soldier  under the same circumstances. Surrounded on every hand by a fierce and  cruel enemy--prepared at every moment to witness scenes of barbarity  and bloodshed in their most appalling shapes--isolated from all society  beyond the gates of their own fortress, and by consequence reposing on  and regarding each other as vital links in the chain of their wild and  adventurous existence,--it can easily be understood with what sincere  and unaffected grief they lamented the sudden cutting off even of those  who least assimilated in spirit and character with themselves. Such, in  a great degree, had been the case in the instance of the officer over  whose grave they were now met to render the last offices of  companionship, if not of friendship. Indeed Murphy--a rude, vulgar, and  illiterate, though brave Irishman--having risen from the ranks, the  coarseness of which he had never been able to shake off, was little  calculated, either by habits or education, to awaken feelings, except  of the most ordinary description, in his favour; and he and Ensign  Delme were the only exceptions to those disinterested and tacit  friendships that had grown up out of circumstances in common among the  majority. If, therefore, they could regret the loss of such a companion  as Murphy, how deep and heartfelt must have been the sorrow they  experienced when they beheld the brave, generous, manly, amiable, and  highly-talented Frederick de Haldimar--the pride of the garrison, and  the idol of his family--lying extended, a cold, senseless corpse, slain  by the hand of the bosom friend of his own brother!--Notwithstanding  the stern severity and distance of the governor, whom few  circumstances, however critical or exciting, could surprise into  relaxation of his habitual stateliness, it would have been difficult to  name two young men more universally liked and esteemed by their brother  officers than were the De Haldimars--the first for the qualities  already named--the second, for those retiring, mild, winning manners,  and gentle affections, added to extreme and almost feminine beauty of  countenance for which he was remarkable. Alas, what a gloomy picture  was now exhibited to the minds of all!--Frederick de Haldimar a corpse,  and slain by the hand of Sir Everard Valletort! What but disunion could  follow this melancholy catastrophe? and how could Charles de Haldimar,  even if his bland nature should survive the shock, ever bear to look  again upon the man who had, however innocently or unintentionally,  deprived him of a brother whom he adored?    These were the impressions that passed through the minds of the  compassionating officers, as they directed their glance alternately  from the common to the pale and marble-like features of the younger De  Haldimar, who, with parted lips and stupid gaze, continued to fix his  eyes upon the inanimate form of his ill-fated brother, as if the very  faculty of life itself had been for a period suspended. At length,  however, while his companions watched in silence the mining workings of  that grief which they feared to interrupt by ill-timed observations,  even of condolence, the death-like hue, which had hitherto suffused the  usually blooming cheek of the young officer, was succeeded by a flush  of the deepest dye, while his eyes, swollen by the tide of blood now  rushing violently to his face, appeared to be bursting from their  sockets. The shock was more than his delicate frame, exhausted as it  was by watching and fatigue, could bear. He tottered, reeled, pressed  his hand upon his head, and before any one could render him assistance,  fell senseless on the ramparts.    During the interval between Sir Everard Valletort's exclamation, and  the fall of Charles de Haldimar, the men employed at the grave had  performed their duty, and were gazing with mingled astonishment and  concern, both on the body of their murdered officer, and on the dumb  scene acting around them. Two of these were now despatched for a  litter, with which they speedily re-appeared. On this Charles de  Haldimar, already delirious with the fever of intense excitement, was  carefully placed, and, followed by Captain Blessington and Lieutenant  Johnstone, borne to his apartment in the small range of buildings  constituting the officers' barracks. Captain Erskine undertook the  disagreeable office of communicating these distressing events to the  governor; and the remainder of the officers once more hastened to join  or linger near their respective companies, in readiness for the order  which it was expected would be given to despatch a numerous party of  the garrison to secure the body of Captain de Haldimar.          CHAPTER V.    The sun was just rising above the horizon, in all that peculiar  softness of splendour which characterises the early days of autumn in  America, as Captain Erskine led his company across the drawbridge that  communicated with the fort. It was the first time it had been lowered  since the investment of the garrison by the Indians; and as the dull  and rusty chains performed their service with a harsh and grating  sound, it seemed as if an earnest were given of melancholy boding.  Although the distance to be traversed was small, the risk the party  incurred was great; for it was probable the savages, ever on the alert,  would not suffer them to effect their object unmolested. It was perhaps  singular, and certainly contradictory, that an officer of the  acknowledged prudence and forethought ascribed to the  governor--qualities which in a great degree neutralised his excessive  severity in the eyes of his troops--should have hazarded the chance of  having his garrison enfeebled by the destruction of a part, if not of  the whole, of the company appointed to this dangerous duty; but with  all his severity, Colonel de Haldimar was not without strong affection  for his children. The feelings of the father, therefore, in a great  degree triumphed over the prudence of the commander; and to shield the  corpse of his son from the indignities which he well knew would be  inflicted on it by Indian barbarity, he had been induced to accede to  the earnest prayer of Captain Erskine, that he might be permitted to  lead out his company for the purpose of securing the body. Every means  were, however, taken to cover the advance, and ensure the retreat of  the detachment. The remainder of the troops were distributed along the  rear of the ramparts, with instructions to lie flat on their faces  until summoned by their officers from that position; which was to be  done only in the event of close pursuit from the savages. Artillerymen  were also stationed at the several guns that flanked the rear of the  fort, and necessarily commanded both the common and the outskirt of the  forest, with orders to fire with grape-shot at a given signal. Captain  Erskine's instructions were, moreover, if attacked, to retreat back  under the guns of the fort slowly and in good order, and without  turning his back upon the enemy.    Thus confident of support, the party, after traversing the drawbridge  with fixed bayonets, inclined to the right, and following the winding  of the ditch by which it was surrounded, made the semi-circuit of the  rampart until they gained the immediate centre of the rear, and in a  direct line with the bomb-proof. Here their mode of advance was  altered, to guard more effectually against the enemy with whom they  might possibly have to contend. The front and rear ranks of the  company, consisting in all of ninety men, were so placed as to leave  space in the event of attack, of a portion of each wheeling inwards so  as to present in an instant three equal faces of a square. As the rear  was sufficiently covered by the cannon of the fort to defeat any  attempt to turn their flanks, the manoeuvre was one that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49131"],[0,"Wings over England (#12)"],[1,"mind alert.    It was there on the rock that her brother found her. \"So they drove you  out of London? The dirty Huns!\" he exclaimed, dropping to a seat beside  her. \"Cherry!\" There were lines of fierce determination in his face,  \"I'm going to join up with the Royal Air Force.\"    For a full minute she made no reply, just sat staring at the cloudless  sky. Perhaps she was thinking of the good times they had had together,  fishing and swimming in summer, tobogganing and skiing in winter. And on  rainy days there had been games before the open fire.    \"Yes,\" she whispered at last, as color flooded back into her face, \"you  must join up, Brand. Everyone must. Those marvelous people, the women,  the children must come out of the subway. They must sleep again in their  own homes in peace.\"    \"I--I'm glad you feel that way.\" Brand swallowed hard. \"That--that's  going to make it easier. You and I have been pals, Cherry, all these  years.    \"I'll tell you,\" his voice picked up. \"It's a great secret. We've been  training, Dave and I, training for two weeks. Training like everything.\"    \"D--Dave,\" she whispered. \"Why! He's an American! This is not his war.\"    \"That's what he thought,\" Brand laughed low. \"Perhaps he still thinks  it, in a way. But he'll join up. You wait! The young Lord says he will,  and he usually knows.\"    \"The--the young Lord?\" Cherry whispered.    \"Yes, there's part of the secret. He's had two week's leave. He's been  training us in the back pasture. Of course we've each done a lot of  flying but this is special, regular fighting stuff, parachutes and  everything. And, Cherry, cross your heart and hope to die if I tell  you?\"    \"Cross--cross my heart.\"    \"All right. Dave's already been in a day fight. He and the young Lord  got a Dornier! Boy, that was great! I wish I'd been in it with them.\"    \"Dave in an air battle?\" The girl stared.    \"Certainly was, and did his part nobly.\"    While Cherry sat listening, breathless, Brand described Dave's adventure  in the clouds that day over England and the channel.    \"Dave never whispered a word about it to me,\" she said when the story  was told. Her shining eyes showed that the American boy stood out in her  mind as a hero.    \"Dave can keep a secret,\" said Brand. \"That's why we all like him.\"    \"But you shouldn't try to drag him into the war,\" Cherry replied  thoughtfully. \"England is not his country.\"    \"He'll decide about that for himself when the time comes.\" Brand sent a  small rock skipping down the hill. \"He talked it all over with his uncle  in London two weeks ago. His uncle advised him to get all the flying  experience he could. He thinks America will be in the war soon. Then  Dave will be in it for sure. Great old boy, his uncle, a real sport. He  was in the other war, an ace flyer. Thinks the air service is trumps.  And who wouldn't?\" Brand's face shone with enthusiasm. \"Boy it's great!  All of it.\" He sprang to his feet. \"Even baling out. First time I  stepped into space with a parachute on my back I thought my heart would  jump out of my mouth. But when the old silk took hold and I drifted  slowly down, Baby! That was swell! I've baled out twenty times since  then--just practice you know. Now it's as natural as swimming.\"    \"Brand?\" Cherry whispered. \"I've lost my voice. They say it will come  back. I--I don't know. Can't do my share. You'll have to carry on. How I  wish I'd been born a boy!\"    \"Buck up, old girl!\" Brand exclaimed cheerfully, \"you'll be right back  in there again before you know it.    \"And even if you aren't,\" he added soberly, \"you've already done more  than any other gal in Merry England to help folks keep heads up and  hopes high. That's a whole great big lot.\"    At that he went marching back down the hill.    \"Great doings these last two weeks,\" he thought to himself. They had  worked hard all of them. Truck loads of Brussels sprouts, turnips,  carrots, apples and pears had been sent rumbling on their way to London.  All their winter's supplies had been safely stowed away. Beside this  they had found time each day for two hours of practice flying. \"There's  mother,\" he thought soberly. \"Somehow, I'll have to win her over.\" Had  he but known it his hated enemies, the Jerries, were to give him a lift  with his mother.    Dave too had been thinking of his mother. As he sat by the open fire  with Cherry that evening, he said:    \"Just had a letter from my mother.\"    \"I hope she's well,\" Cherry replied in her polite, English manner.    \"Oh! Always!\" Dave laughed. \"She's closing our New England home and  going with my aunt to Florida. She has an independent income so she gets  about.\"    \"What does one do in Florida?\" Cherry asked.    \"Oh, bask in the sun until you're brown, swim, play tennis, go tarpon  fishing,\" Dave drawled lazily.    \"Sounds rather dreamy.\"    \"It is, and unreal too. Do you know?\" Dave exclaimed, \"I haven't thought  of it before but since I came to England I've really just started to  live.\"    \"I--I'm glad,\" Cherry whispered. \"I've often thought--\" She broke off to  listen.    \"Enemy planes,\" she whispered.    \"Bombers!\" Dave nodded.    \"Sound as if they were right overhead. And they seem so low.\" Cherry  shuddered.    A half minute followed without a sound save the tick-tock of the tall  old clock and the drone overhead.    Then, of a sudden, with a throaty whisper ten times more startling than  a cry, Cherry sprang from her seat.    The stillness of the countryside had been shattered by a crash that  appeared to come from their own farmyard. Truth was, a bomb had fallen  on their village two miles away.                                       _Chapter_ XIV                              A Dungeon Night      There came a second blast. A deathlike silence followed. This was soon  enough shattered by the anxious call of the cook, demanding to know if  all were well and by the excited cry of the children. Then, from  outside, came the honk of an auto horn.    The door swung open. A voice shouted:    \"All out for a moonlit visit to the ancient Norman castle.\"    It was the young Lord Applegate. \"Pile into the car, all of you.\" His  tone was sharp, commanding. \"This is going to be bad. A dozen Jerry  bombers circling around looking for targets, and the moon making  everything bright as day. Your broad roof shows up all too clearly.\"    Dashing to the corner of the room, Dave seized two buckets of water to  drench the fire. They were to recall this act later, with thanksgiving.    In an incredibly short time they were all crowded into the big car and  away.    Through the back window of the racing car Alice caught a fleeting  glimpse of her home, the only home she had ever known. Standing there in  the cool, shadowy moonlight, with great trees banked behind it, the old  house seemed a thing of indescribable beauty. Yet the word that came to  the girl's mind was \"lonely\". For a space of seconds it seemed to her  that she must leap from the car and race back to be with the dear old  house in its great time of trial.    This was but a fleeting fancy. A turn in the road shut the place from  her view. She heard the young Lord saying:    \"I've fixed up an air raid shelter in the dungeon of the castle. It's  thirty steps down, walled over with massive rocks. Even had an oil  heater installed. We'll be safe and comfortable there.\"    \"Safe and comfortable,\" Alice thought angrily. \"In an insane, upside  down world such as this, who wanted to be comfortable and safe?\"    This too she realized was a wrong slant on life. \"Comfort and safety,\"  she assured herself, \"are two of the great necessities of life. For, on  the morrow, there is work to be done.\" At that she did not know the half  of it.    Warmington Castle, a great, square mass of masonry, looming a hundred  feet above the meadows, greeted them as they took one more curve in the  road. A minute more and there they were.    With the droning of heavy motors still in their ears, they hurried down  one narrow stairs, then another, to find themselves in a rather large  windowless room where candles blinked at them from every corner and an  oil stove glowed warmly up at them.    Lady Applegate, a frail, nervous little lady, greeted them with jittery  handshakes and an uncertain smile. Her husband had died from wounds  received in that other war. And now this! \"Poor soul,\" thought Alice.    As if to guard her from bombs, the Lady's servants, butler, cook, and  two maids, sat clustered about her.    Dave was not long in the dungeon. Having wished to witness an air-raid  he took the thing by the bit and hurried back up the stairs. Flash, the  collie, it would seem, was of the same mind. He followed him out.    As if in search of fresh targets, just any roof gleaming up from the  moonlit night, giant planes were still circling. Dave strained his eyes  for a glimpse of them.    \"That's the plague of it,\" he grumbled. \"If you could see them you could  blast them from the sky even at night.\"    Backing away, he studied the mass of masonry above him. More a fort than  a castle, it had stood there for hundreds of years. Bombs had shattered  it more than twenty years before. But the tower, with stairway leading  to the top, still stood. He was considering climbing those stairs for a  better view of the sky, when, a sudden discovery left him standing there  quite motionless. From the very top of that tower had come a flash of  light.    \"Spy!\" His mind registered like a recording machine. \"Flashing signals!\"    That was enough. Two steps at a time, with the collie at his heels, he  went up those stairs. What was he to do? There were times when he  believed in revelations straight from the Divine Will. He would know  what was to be done when the time came.    Approaching the top, he went on tiptoe. Unfortunately Flash could not  know the need for breathless silence. He uttered a low growl.    Instantly there came a crash. Something had fallen. There was the sound "]]]
