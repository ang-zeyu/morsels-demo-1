Tenderly greet the dear land of my youth!     Here I am captive! oppressed by my foes,     No other than you may carry my woes.     Free through the ether your pathway is seen,     Ye own not the power of this tyrant queen.    KENNEDY.  Alas! dear lady! You're beside yourself,  This long-lost, long-sought freedom makes you rave.    MARY.  Yonder's a fisher returning to his home;  Poor though it be, would he lend me his wherry,  Quick to congenial shores would I ferry.  Spare is his trade, and labor's his doom;  Rich would I freight his vessel with treasure;  Such a draught should be his as he never had seen;  Wealth should he find in his nets without measure,  Would he but rescue a poor captive queen.    KENNEDY.  Fond, fruitless wishes! See you not from far  How we are followed by observing spies?  A dismal, barbarous prohibition scares  Each sympathetic being from our path.    MARY.  No, gentle Hannah! Trust me, not in vain  My prison gates are opened. This small grace  Is harbinger of greater happiness.  No! I mistake not; 'tis the active hand  Of love to which I owe this kind indulgence.  I recognize in this the mighty arm  Of Leicester. They will by degrees expand  My prison; will accustom me, through small,  To greater liberty, until at last  I shall behold the face of him whose hand  Will dash my fetters off, and that forever.    KENNEDY.  Oh, my dear queen! I cannot reconcile  These contradictions. 'Twas but yesterday  That they announced your death, and all at once,  To-day, you have such liberty. Their chains  Are also loosed, as I have oft been told,  Whom everlasting liberty awaits.       [Hunting horns at a distance.    MARY.  Hear'st then the bugle, so blithely resounding?  Hear'st thou its echoes through wood and through plain?  Oh, might I now, on my nimble steed bounding,  Join with the jocund, the frolicsome train.       [Hunting horns again heard.    Again! Oh, this sad and this pleasing remembrance!  These are the sounds which, so sprightly and clear,  Oft, when with music the hounds and the horn  So cheerfully welcomed the break of the morn,  On the heaths of the Highlands delighted my ear.        SCENE II.       Enter PAULET.    PAULET.  Well, have I acted right at last, my lady?  Do I for once, at least, deserve your thanks?    MARY.  How! Do I owe this favor, sir, to you?    PAULET.  Why not to me? I visited the court,  And gave the queen your letter.    MARY.                   Did you give it?  In very truth did you deliver it?  And is this freedom which I now enjoy  The happy consequence?    PAULET (significantly).              Nor that alone;  Prepare yourself to see a greater still.    MARY.  A greater still! What do you mean by that?    PAULET.  You heard the bugle-horns?    MARY (starting back with foreboding apprehension).                You frighten me.    PAULET.  The queen is hunting in the neighborhood----    MARY.                         What!    PAULET.  In a few moments she'll appear before you.    KENNEDY (hastening towards MARY, and about to fall).  How fare you, dearest lady? You grow pale.    PAULET.  How? Is't not well? Was it not then your prayer?  'Tis granted now, before it was expected;  You who had ever such a ready speech,  Now summon all your powers of eloquence,  The important time to use them now is come.    MARY.  Oh, why was I not told of this before?  Now I am not prepared for it--not now  What, as the greatest favor, I besought,  Seems to me now most fearful; Hannah, come,  Lead me into the house, till I collect  My spirits.    PAULET.         Stay; you must await her here.  Yes! I believe you may be well alarmed  To stand before your judge.        SCENE III.       Enter the EARL OF SHREWSBURY.    MARY.                 'Tis not for that, O God!  Far other thoughts possess me now.  Oh, worthy Shrewsbury! You come as though  You were an angel sent to me from heaven.  I cannot, will not see her. Save me, save me  From the detested sight!    SHREWSBURY.               Your majesty,  Command yourself, and summon all your courage,  'Tis the decisive moment of your fate.    MARY.  For years I've waited, and prepared myself.  For this I've studied, weighed, and written down  Each word within the tablet of my memory  That was to touch and move her to compassion.  Forgotten suddenly, effaced is all,  And nothing lives within me at this moment  But the fierce, burning feeling of my wrongs.  My heart is turned to direst hate against her;  All gentle thoughts, all sweet forgiving words,  Are gone, and round me stand with grisly mien,  The fiends of hell, and shake their snaky locks!    SHREWSBURY.  Command your wild, rebellious blood;--constrain  The bitterness which fills your heart. No good  Ensues when hatred is opposed to hate.  How much soe'er the inward struggle cost  You must submit to stern necessity,  The power is in her hand, be therefore humble.    MARY.  To her? I never can.    SHREWSBURY.              But pray, submit.  Speak with respect, with calmness! Strive to move  Her magnanimity; insist not now  Upon your rights, not now--'tis not the season.    MARY.  Ah! woe is me! I've prayed for my destruction,  And, as a curse to me, my prayer is heard.  We never should have seen each other--never!  Oh, this can never, never come to good.  Rather in love could fire and water meet,  The timid lamb embrace the roaring tiger!  I have been hurt too grievously; she hath  Too grievously oppressed me;--no atonement  Can make us friends!    SHREWSBURY.             First see her, face to face:  Did I not see how she was moved at reading  Your letter? How her eyes were drowned in tears?  No--she is not unfeeling; only place  More confidence in her. It was for this  That I came on before her, to entreat you  To be collected--to admonish you----    MARY (seizing his hand).  Oh, Talbot! you have ever been my friend,  Had I but stayed beneath your kindly care!  They have, indeed, misused me, Shrewsbury.    SHREWSBURY.  Let all be now forgot, and only think  How to receive her with submissiveness.    MARY.  Is Burleigh with her, too, my evil genius?    SHREWSBURY.  No one attends her but the Earl of Leicester.    MARY.  Lord Leicester?    SHREWSBURY.           Fear not him; it is not he  Who wishes your destruction;--'twas his work  That here the queen hath granted you this meeting.    MARY.  Ah! well I knew it.    SHREWSBURY.             What?    PAULET.                The queen approaches.       [They all draw aside; MARY alone remains, leaning on KENNEDY.        SCENE IV.       The same, ELIZABETH, EARL OF LEICESTER, and Retinue.    ELIZABETH (to LEICESTER).  What seat is that, my lord?    LEICESTER.                 'Tis Fotheringay.    ELIZABETH (to SHREWSBURY).  My lord, send back our retinue to London;  The people crowd too eager in the roads,  We'll seek a refuge in this quiet park.       [TALBOT sends the train away. She looks steadfastly at MARY,     as she speaks further with PAULET.    My honest people love me overmuch.  These signs of joy are quite idolatrous.  Thus should a God be honored, not a mortal.    MARY (who the whole time had leaned, almost fainting, on KENNEDY, rises   now, and her eyes meet the steady, piercing look of ELIZABETH; she   shudders and throws herself again upon KENNEDY'S bosom).  O God! from out these features speaks no heart.    ELIZABETH.  What lady's that?       [A general, embarrassed silence.    LEICESTER.            You are at Fotheringay,  My liege!    ELIZABETH (as if surprised, casting an angry look at LEICESTER).  Who hath done this, my Lord of Leicester?    LEICESTER.  'Tis past, my queen;--and now that heaven hath led  Your footsteps hither, be magnanimous;  And let sweet pity be triumphant now.      SHREWSBURY.  Oh, royal mistress! yield to our entreaties;  Oh, cast your eyes on this unhappy one  Who stands dissolved in anguish.       [MARY collects herself, and begins to advance towards     ELIZABETH, stops shuddering at half way: her action     expresses the most violent internal struggle.    ELIZABETH.                    How, my lords!  Which of you then announced to me a prisoner  Bowed down by woe? I see a haughty one  By no means humbled by calamity.    MARY.  Well, be it so:--to this will I submit.  Farewell high thought, and pride of noble mind!  I will forget my dignity, and all  My sufferings; I will fall before her feet  Who hath reduced me to this wretchedness.       [She turns towards the QUEEN.    The voice of heaven decides for you, my sister.  Your happy brows are now with triumph crowned,  I bless the Power Divine which thus hath raised you.  But in your turn be merciful, my sister;                       [She kneels.  Let me not lie before you thus disgraced;  Stretch forth your hand, your royal hand, to raise  Your sister from the depths of her distress.    ELIZABETH (stepping back).  You are where it becomes you, Lady Stuart;  And thankfully I prize my God's protection,  Who hath not suffered me to kneel a suppliant  Thus at your feet, as you now kneel at mine.    MARY (with increasing energy of feeling).  Think on all earthly things, vicissitudes.  Oh! there are gods who punish haughty pride:  Respect them, honor them, the dreadful ones  Who thus before thy feet have humbled me!  Before these strangers' eyes dishonor not  Yourself in me: profane not, nor disgrace  The royal blood of Tudor. In my veins  It flows as pure a stream as in your own.  Oh, for God's pity, stand not so estranged  And inaccessible, like some tall cliff,  Which the poor shipwrecked mariner in vain  Struggles to seize, and labors to embrace.  My all, my life, my fortune now depends  Upon the influence of my words and tears;  That I may touch your heart, oh, set mine free.  If you regard me with those icy looks  My shuddering heart contracts itself, the stream  Of tears is dried, and frigid horror chains  The words of supplication in my bosom!    ELIZABETH (c"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6798"],[0,"Aesthetical Essays of Friedrich Schiller (#12)"],[1,"as Jupiter gave them to his son-in-law, and by her triumphing force  she finally decides the victory.    Reason has done all that she could in finding the law and promulgating  it; it is for the energy of the will and the ardor of feeling to carry it  out. To issue victoriously from her contest with force, truth herself  must first become a force, and turn one of the instincts of man into her  champion in the empire of phenomena. For instincts are the only motive  forces in the material world. If hitherto truth has so little manifested  her victorious power, this has not depended on the understanding, which  could not have unveiled it, but on the heart which remained closed to it  and on instinct which did not act with it.    Whence, in fact, proceeds this general sway of prejudices, this might of  the understanding in the midst of the light disseminated by philosophy  and experience? The age is enlightened, that is to say, that knowledge,  obtained and vulgarized, suffices to set right at least on practical  principles. The spirit of free inquiry has dissipated the erroneous  opinions which long barred the access to truth, and has undermined the  ground on which fanaticism and deception had erected their throne.  Reason has purified itself from the illusions of the senses and from a  mendacious sophistry, and philosophy herself raises her voice and exhorts  us to return to the bosom of nature, to which she had first made us  unfaithful. Whence then is it that we remain still barbarians?    There must be something in the spirit of man--as it is not in the objects  themselves--which prevents us from receiving the truth, notwithstanding  the brilliant light she diffuses, and from accepting her, whatever may be  her strength for producing conviction. This something was perceived and  expressed by an ancient sage in this very significant maxim: sapere aude  [dare to be wise.]    Dare to be wise! A spirited courage is required to triumph over the  impediments that the indolence of nature as well as the cowardice of the  heart oppose to our instruction. It was not without reason that the  ancient Mythos made Minerva issue fully armed from the head of Jupiter,  for it is with warfare that this instruction commences. From its very  outset it has to sustain a hard fight against the senses, which do not  like to be roused from their easy slumber. The greater part of men are  much too exhausted and enervated by their struggle with want to be able  to engage in a new and severe contest with error. Satisfied if they  themselves can escape from the hard labor of thought, they willingly  abandon to others the guardianship of their thoughts. And if it happens  that nobler necessities agitate their soul, they cling with a greedy  faith to the formula that the state and the church hold in reserve for  such cases. If these unhappy men deserve our compassion, those others  deserve our just contempt, who, though set free from those necessities by  more fortunate circumstances, yet willingly bend to their yoke. These  latter persons prefer this twilight of obscure ideas, where the feelings  have more intensity, and the imagination can at will create convenient  chimeras, to the rays of truth which put to flight the pleasant illusions  of their dreams. They have founded the whole structure of their  happiness on these very illusions, which ought to be combated and  dissipated by the light of knowledge, and they would think they were  paying too dearly for a truth which begins by robbing them of all that  has value in their sight. It would be necessary that they should be  already sages to love wisdom: a truth that was felt at once by him to  whom philosophy owes its name. [The Greek word means, as is known, love  of wisdom.]    It is therefore not going far enough to say that the light of the  understanding only deserves respect when it reacts on the character; to a  certain extent it is from the character that this light proceeds; for the  road that terminates in the head must pass through the heart.  Accordingly, the most pressing need of the present time is to educate the  sensibility, because it is the means, not only to render efficacious in  practice the improvement of ideas, but to call this improvement into  existence.          LETTER IX.      But perhaps there is a vicious circle in our previous reasoning!  Theoretical culture must it seems bring along with it practical culture,  and yet the latter must be the condition of the former. All improvement  in the political sphere must proceed from the ennobling of the character.  But, subject to the influence of a social constitution still barbarous,  how can character become ennobled? It would then be necessary to seek  for this end an instrument that the state does not furnish, and to open  sources that would have preserved themselves pure in the midst of  political corruption.    I have now reached the point to which all the considerations tended that  have engaged me up to the present time. This instrument is the art of  the beautiful; these sources are open to us in its immortal models.    Art, like science, is emancipated from all that is positive, and all that  is humanly conventional; both are completely independent of the arbitrary  will of man. The political legislator may place their empire under an  interdict, but he cannot reign there. He can proscribe the friend of  truth, but truth subsists; he can degrade the artist, but he cannot  change art. No doubt, nothing is more common than to see science and art  bend before the spirit of the age, and creative taste receive its law  from critical taste. When the character becomes stiff and hardens  itself, we see science severely keeping her limits, and art subject to  the harsh restraint of rules; when the character is relaxed and softened,  science endeavors to please and art to rejoice. For whole ages  philosophers as well as artists show themselves occupied in letting down  truth and beauty to the depths of vulgar humanity. They themselves are  swallowed up in it; but, thanks to their essential vigor and  indestructible life, the true and the beautiful make a victorious fight,  and issue triumphant from the abyss.    No doubt the artist is the child of his time, but unhappy for him if he  is its disciple or even its favorite! Let a beneficent deity carry off  in good time the suckling from the breast of its mother, let it nourish  him on the milk of a better age, and suffer him to grow up and arrive at  virility under the distant sky of Greece. When he has attained manhood,  let him come back, presenting a face strange to his own age; let him  come, not to delight it with his apparition, but rather to purify it,  terrible as the son of Agamemnon. He will, indeed, receive his matter  from the present time, but he will borrow the form from a nobler time and  even beyond all time, from the essential, absolute, immutable unity.  There, issuing from the pure ether of its heavenly nature, flows the  source of all beauty, which was never tainted by the corruptions of  generations or of ages, which roll along far beneath it in dark eddies.  Its matter may be dishonored as well as ennobled by fancy, but the  ever-chaste form escapes from the caprices of imagination. The Roman had  already bent his knee for long years to the divinity of the emperors, and  yet the statues of the gods stood erect; the temples retained their  sanctity for the eye long after the gods had become a theme for mockery,  and the noble architecture of the palaces that shielded the infamies of  Nero and of Commodus were a protest against them. Humanity has lost its  dignity, but art has saved it, and preserves it in marbles full of  meaning; truth continues to live in illusion, and the copy will serve to  re-establish the model. If the nobility of art has survived the nobility  of nature, it also goes before it like an inspiring genius, forming and  awakening minds. Before truth causes her triumphant light to penetrate  into the depths of the heart, poetry intercepts her rays, and the summits  of humanity shine in a bright light, while a dark and humid night still  hangs over the valleys.    But how will the artist avoid the corruption of his time which encloses  him on all hands? Let him raise his eyes to his own dignity, and to law;  let him not lower them to necessity and fortune. Equally exempt from a  vain activity which would imprint its trace on the fugitive moment, and  from the dreams of an impatient enthusiasm which applies the measure of  the absolute to the paltry productions of time, let the artist abandon  the real to the understanding, for that is its proper field. But let the  artist endeavor to give birth to the ideal by the union of the possible  and of the necessary. Let him stamp illusion and truth with the effigy  of this ideal; let him apply it to the play of his imagination and his  most serious actions, in short, to all sensuous and spiritual forms; then  let him quietly launch his work into infinite time.    But the minds set on fire by this ideal have not all received an equal  share of calm from the creative genius--that great and patient temper  which is required to impress the ideal on the dumb marble, or to spread  it over a page of cold, sober letters, and then intrust it to the  faithful hands of time. This divine instinct, and creative force, much  too ardent to follow this peaceful walk, often throws itself immediately  on the present, on active life, and strives to transform the shapeless  matter of the moral world. The misfortune of his brothers, of the whole  species, appeals loudly to the heart of the man of feeling; their  abasement appeals still louder: enthusiasm is inflamed, and in souls  endowed with energy the burning desire aspires impatiently to action and  facts. But has this innovator examined himself to see if these disorders  of the moral world wound his reason, or if they do not rather wound his"]]]
