Tarascus was gray of face as he mechanically allowed Orastes to force  him prostrate again and the priest renewed work upon his mangled flesh.    'Conan!' he repeated. 'Not a crushed corpse--escaped! Mitra! He is no  man; but a devil himself! I thought Xaltotun was behind this wound. I  see now. Gods and devils! It was Conan who stabbed me! Arideus!'    'Aye, your Majesty!'    'Search every nook in the palace. He may be skulking through the dark  corridors now like a hungry tiger. Let no niche escape your scrutiny,  and beware. It is not a civilized man you hunt, but a blood-mad  barbarian whose strength and ferocity are those of a wild beast. Scour  the palace-grounds and the city. Throw a cordon about the walls. If you  find he has escaped from the city, as he may well do, take a troop of  horsemen and follow him. Once past the walls it will be like hunting a  wolf through the hills. But haste, and you may yet catch him.'    'This is a matter which requires more than ordinary human wits,' said  Orastes. 'Perhaps we should seek Xaltotun's advice.'    'No!' exclaimed Tarascus violently. 'Let the troopers pursue Conan and  slay him. Xaltotun can hold no grudge against us if we kill a prisoner  to prevent his escape.'    'Well,' said Orastes, 'I am no Acheronian, but I am versed in some of  the arts, and the control of certain spirits which have cloaked  themselves in material substance. Perhaps I can aid you in this matter.'           *       *       *       *       *    The fountain of Thrallos stood in a clustered ring of oaks beside the  road a mile from the walls of the city. Its musical tinkle reached  Conan's ears through the silence of the starlight. He drank deep of its  icy stream, and then hurried southward toward a small, dense thicket he  saw there. Rounding it, he saw a great white horse tied among the  bushes. Heaving a deep gusty sigh he reached it with one stride--a  mocking laugh brought him about, glaring.    A dully glinting, mail-clad figure moved out of the shadows into the  starlight. This was no plumed and burnished palace guardsman. It was a  tall man in morion and gray chain-mail--one of the Adventurers, a class  of warriors peculiar to Nemedia; men who had not attained to the wealth  and position of knighthood, or had fallen from that estate; hard-bitten  fighters, dedicating their lives to war and adventure. They constituted  a class of their own, sometimes commanding troops, but themselves  accountable to no man but the king. Conan knew that he could have been  discovered by no more dangerous a foeman.    A quick glance among the shadows convinced him that the man was alone,  and he expanded his great chest slightly, digging his toes into the  turf, as his thews coiled tensely.    'I was riding for Belverus on Amalric's business,' said the Adventurer,  advancing warily. The starlight was a long sheen on the great two-handed  sword he bore naked in his hand. 'A horse whinnied to mine from the  thicket. I investigated and thought it strange a steed should be  tethered here. I waited--and lo, I have caught a rare prize!'    The Adventurers lived by their swords.    'I know you,' muttered the Nemedian. 'You are Conan, king of Aquilonia.  I thought I saw you die in the valley of the Valkia, but----'    Conan sprang as a dying tiger springs. Practised fighter though the  Adventurer was, he did not realize the desperate quickness that lurks in  barbaric sinews. He was caught off guard, his heavy sword half lifted.  Before he could either strike or parry, the king's poniard sheathed  itself in his throat, above the gorget, slanting downward into his  heart. With a choked gurgle he reeled and went down, and Conan  ruthlessly tore his blade free as his victim fell. The white horse  snorted violently and shied at the sight and scent of blood on the  sword.    Glaring down at his lifeless enemy, dripping poniard in hand, sweat  glistening on his broad breast, Conan poised like a statue, listening  intently. In the woods about there was no sound, save for the sleepy  cheep of awakened birds. But in the city, a mile away, he heard the  strident blare of a trumpet.    Hastily he bent over the fallen man. A few seconds' search convinced him  that whatever message the man might have borne was intended to be  conveyed by word of mouth. But he did not pause in his task. It was not  many hours until dawn. A few minutes later the white horse was galloping  westward along the white road, and the rider wore the gray mail of a  Nemedian Adventurer.          7    The Rending of the Veil      Conan knew his only chance of escape lay in speed. He did not even  consider hiding somewhere near Belverus until the chase passed on; he  was certain that the uncanny ally of Tarascus would be able to ferret  him out. Besides, he was not one to skulk and hide; an open fight or an  open chase, either suited his temperament better. He had a long start,  he knew. He would lead them a grinding race for the border.    Zenobia had chosen well in selecting the white horse. His speed,  toughness and endurance were obvious. The girl knew weapons and horses,  and, Conan reflected with some satisfaction, she knew men. He rode  westward at a gait that ate up the miles.    It was a sleeping land through which he rode, past grove-sheltered  villages and white-walled villas amid spacious fields and orchards that  grew sparser as he fared westward. As the villages thinned, the land  grew more rugged, and the keeps that frowned from eminences told of  centuries of border war. But none rode down from those castles to  challenge or halt him. The lords of the keeps were following the banner  of Amalric; the pennons that were wont to wave over these towers were  now floating over the Aquilonian plains.    When the last huddled village fell behind him, Conan left the road,  which was beginning to bend toward the northwest, toward the distant  passes. To keep to the road would mean to pass by border towers, still  garrisoned with armed men who would not allow him to pass unquestioned.  He knew there would be no patrols riding the border marches on either  side, as in ordinary times, but there were those towers, and with dawn  there would probably be cavalcades of returning soldiers with wounded  men in ox-carts.    This road from Belverus was the only road that crossed the border for  fifty miles from north to south. It followed a series of passes through  the hills, and on either hand lay a wide expanse of wild, sparsely  inhabited mountains. He maintained his due westerly direction, intending  to cross the border deep in the wilds of the hills that lay to the south  of the passes. It was a shorter route, more arduous, but safer for a  hunted fugitive. One man on a horse could traverse country an army would  find impassable.    But at dawn he had not reached the hills; they were a long, low, blue  rampart stretching along the horizon ahead of him. Here there were  neither farms nor villages, no white-walled villas looming among  clustering trees. The dawn wind stirred the tall stiff grass, and there  was nothing but the long rolling swells of brown earth, covered with dry  grass, and in the distance the gaunt walls of a stronghold on a low  hill. Too many Aquilonian raiders had crossed the mountains in not too  distant days for the countryside to be thickly settled as it was farther  to the east.    Dawn ran like a prairie fire across the grasslands, and high overhead  sounded a weird crying as a straggling wedge of wild geese winged  swiftly southward. In a grassy swale Conan halted and unsaddled his  mount. Its sides were heaving, its coat plastered with sweat. He had  pushed it unmercifully through the hours before dawn.    While it munched the brittle grass and rolled, he lay at the crest of  the low slope, staring eastward. Far away to the northward he could see  the road he had left, streaming like a white ribbon over a distant rise.  No black dots moved along that glistening ribbon. There was no sign  about the castle in the distance to indicate that the keepers had  noticed the lone wayfarer.    An hour later the land still stretched bare. The only sign of life was a  glint of steel on the far-off battlements, a raven in the sky that  wheeled backward and forth, dipping and rising as if seeking something.  Conan saddled and rode westward at a more leisurely gait.    As he topped the farther crest of the slope, a raucous screaming burst  out over his head, and looking up, he saw the raven flapping high above  him, cawing incessantly. As he rode on, it followed him, maintaining its  position and making the morning hideous with its strident cries,  heedless of his efforts to drive it away.    This kept up for hours, until Conan's teeth were on edge, and he felt  that he would give half his kingdom to be allowed to wring that black  neck.    'Devils of hell!' he roared in futile rage, shaking his mailed fist at  the frantic bird. 'Why do you harry me with your squawking? Begone, you  black spawn of perdition, and peck for wheat in the farmer's fields!'    He was ascending the first pitch of the hills, and he seemed to hear an  echo of the bird's clamor far behind him. Turning in his saddle, he  presently made out another black dot hanging in the blue. Beyond that  again he caught the glint of the afternoon sun on steel. That could mean  only one thing: armed men. And they were not riding along the beaten  road, which was out of his sight beyond the horizon. They were following  him.    His face grew grim and he shivered slightly as he stared at the raven  that wheeled high above him.    'So it is more than the whim of a brainless beast?' he muttered. 'Those  riders cannot see you, spawn of hell; but the other bird can see you,  and they can see him. You follow me, he follows you, and they follow  him. Are you only a craftily trained feathered creature, or some devil  in the form of a bird?

More fiercely it blew through the hours  of darkness. It was a night of terror, for they dared not go to  sleep, not knowing at what moment the ship might turn turtle, or  even rend apart, and plunge with them into the depths of the sea.    So they sat up, occasionally attending to the machinery, and noting  the various gages. Mr. Damon made hot coffee, which they drank from  time to time, and it served to refresh them.    There came a sudden burst of fury from the storm, and the airship  rocked as if she was going over.    \"Bless my heart!\" cried Mr. Damon, springing up. \"That was a close  call!\"    Tom said nothing. Mr. Fenwick looked pale and alarmed.    The hours passed. They were swept ever onward, at about the same  speed, sometimes being whirled downward, and again tossed upward at  the will of the wind. The airship was well-nigh helpless, and Tom,  as he realized their position, could not repress a fear in his heart  as he thought of the parents of the girl he loved being tossed about  on the swirling ocean, in a frail pleasure yacht.          CHAPTER XII    A DOWNWARD GLIDE      They sat in the cabin of the airship, staring helplessly at each  other. Occasionally Tom rose to attend to one of the machines, or  Mr. Fenwick did the same. Occasionally, Mr. Damon uttered a remark.  Then there was silence, broken only by the howl of the gale.    It seemed impossible for the WHIZZER to travel any faster, yet when  Tom glanced at the speed gage he noted, with a feeling of surprise,  akin to horror, that they were making close to one hundred and fifty  miles an hour. Only an aeroplane could have done it, and then only  when urged on by a terrific wind which added to the speed produced  by the propellers.    The whole craft swayed and trembled, partly from the vibration of  the electrical machinery, and partly from the awful wind. Mr.  Fenwick came close to Tom, and exclaimed:    \"Do you think it would be any use to try once more to go above or  below the path of the storm?\"    Tom's first impulse was to say that it would be useless, but he  recollected that the craft belonged to Fenwick, and surely that  gentleman had a right to make a suggestion. The young inventor  nodded.    \"We'll try to go up,\" he said. \"If that doesn't work, I'll see if I  can force her down. It will be hard work, though. The wind is too  stiff.\"    Tom shifted the levers and rudders. His eyes were on the barograph--that  delicate instrument, the trembling hand of which registered  their height. Tom had tilted the deflection rudder to send them up,  but as he watched the needle he saw it stationary. They were not  ascending, though the great airship was straining to mount to an  upper current where there might be calm.    It was useless, however, and Tom, seeing the futility of it, shifted  the rudder to send them downward. This was more easily accomplished,  but it was a change for the worse, since, the nearer to the ocean  they went, the fiercer blew the wind.    \"Back! Go back up higher!\" cried Mr. Damon,    \"We can't!\" yelled Tom. \"We've got to stay here now!\"    \"Oh, but this is awful!\" exclaimed Mr. Fenwick. \"We can never stand  this!\"    The airship swaged more than ever, and the occupants were tossed  about in the cabin, from side to side. Indeed, it did seem that  human beings never could come alive out of that fearful ordeal.    As Tom looked from one of the windows of the cabin, he noted a pale,  grayish sort of light outside. At first he could not understand what  it was, then, as he observed the sickly gleams of the incandescent  electric lamps, he knew that the hour of dawn was at hand.    \"See!\" he exclaimed to his companions, pointing to the window.  \"Morning is coming.\"    \"Morning!\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"Is the night over? Now, perhaps we  shall get rid of the storm.\"    \"I'm afraid not,\" answered Tom, as he noted the anemometer and felt  the shudderings of the WHIZZER as she careened on through the gale.  \"It hasn't blown out yet!\"    The pale light increased. The electrics seemed to dim and fade. Tom  looked to the engines. Some of the apparatus was in need of oil, and  he supplied it. When he came back to the main cabin, where stood Mr.  Damon and Mr. Fenwick, it was much lighter outside.    \"Less than a day since we left Philadelphia,\" murmured the owner of  the WHIZZER, as he glanced at a distance indicator, \"yet we have  come nearly sixteen hundred miles. We certainly did travel top  speed. I wonder where we are?\"    \"Still over the ocean,\" replied Mr. Damon, as he looked down at the  heaving billows rolling amid crests of foam far below them. \"Though  what part of it would be hard to say. We'll have to reckon out our  position when it gets calmer.\"    Tom came from the engine room. His face wore a troubled look, and he  said, addressing the older inventor:    \"Mr. Fenwick, I wish you'd come and look at the gas generating  apparatus. It doesn't seem to be working properly.\"    \"Anything wrong?\" asked Mr. Damon, suspiciously.    \"I hope not,\" replied Tom, with all the confidence he could muster.  \"It may need adjusting. I am not so familiar with it as I am with  the one on the RED CLOUD. The gas seems to be escaping from the bag,  and we may have to descend, for some distance.\"    \"But the aeroplanes will keep us up,\" said Mr. Daman.    \"Yes--they will,\" and Tom hesitated. \"That is, unless something  happens to them. They are rather frail to stand alone the brunt of  the gale, and I wish--\"    Tom did not complete the sentence. Instead, he paused suddenly and  seemed to be intently listening.    From without there came a rending, tearing, crashing sound. The  airship quivered from end to end, and seemed to make a sudden dive  downward. Then it appeared to recover, and once more glided forward.    Tom, followed by Mr. Fenwick, made a rush for the compartment where  the machine was installed. They had no sooner reached it than there  sounded an explosion, and the airship recoiled as if it had hit a  stone wall.    \"Bless my shaving brush! What's that?\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Has  anything happened?\"    \"I'm rather afraid there has,\" answered Tom, solemnly. \"It sounded  as though the gas bag went up. And I'm worried over the strength of  the planes. We must make an investigation!\"    \"We're falling!\" almost screamed Mr. Fenwick, as he glanced at the  barograph, the delicate needle of which was swinging to and fro,  registering different altitudes.    \"Bless my feather bed! So we are!\" shouted Mr. Damon. \"Let's jump,  and avoid being caught under the airship!\"    He darted for a large window, opening from the main cabin, and was  endeavoring to raise it when Tom caught his hand.    \"What are you trying to do,\" asked the lad, hoarsely.    \"Save my life! I want to get out of this as soon as I can. I'm going  to jump!\"    \"Don't think of it! You'd be instantly killed. We're too high for a  jump, even into the ocean.\"    \"The ocean! Oh, is that still below us? Is there any chance of being  saved? What can be done?\" Mr. Damon hesitated.    \"We must first find out how badly we are damaged,\" said Tom,  quietly. \"We must keep our heads, and be calm, no matter what  happens. I need your help, Mr. Damon.\"    This served to recall the rather excited man to his senses. He came  back to the centre of the cabin, which was no easy task, for the  floor of it was tilted at first one angle, and then another. He  stood at Tom's side.    \"What can I do to help you?\" he asked. Mr. Fenwick was darting here  and there, examining the different machines. None of them seemed to  be damaged.    \"If you will look and see what has happened to our main wing planes,  I will see how much gas we have left in the bag,\" suggested Tom.  \"Then we can decide what is best to be done. We are still quite  high, and it will take some time to complete our fall, as, even if  everything is gone, the material of the bag will act as a sort of  parachute.\"    Mr. Damon darted to a window in the rear of the cabin, where he  could obtain a glimpse of the main wing planes. He gave a cry of  terror and astonishment.    \"Two of the planes are gone!\" he reported. \"They are torn and are  hanging loose.\"    \"I feared as much,\" retorted Tom, quietly, \"The gale was too much  for them.\"    \"What of the lifting gas?\" asked Mr. Fenwick, quickly.    \"It has nearly all flowed out of the retaining bag.\"    \"Then we must make more at once. I will start the generating  machine.\"    He darted toward it.    \"It will be useless,\" spoke Tom, quietly.    \"Why?\"    \"Because there is no bag left to hold it. The silk and rubber  envelope has been torn to pieces by the gale. The wind is even  stronger than it was last night.\"    \"Then what's to be done?\" demanded Mr. Damon, with a return of his  alarmed and nervous manner. \"Bless my fingernails! What's to be  done?\"    For an instant Tom did not answer. It was constantly getting  lighter, though there was no sun, for it was obscured by scudding  clouds. The young inventor looked critically at the various gages  and indicators.    \"Is--is there any chance for us?\" asked Mr. Fenwick, quietly.    \"I think so,\" answered Tom, with a hopeful smile. \"We have about two  thousand feet to descend, for we have fallen nearly that distance  since the accident.\"    \"Two thousand feet to fall!\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"We can never do it  and live!\"    \"I think so,\" spoke Tom.    \"Bless my gizzard! How?\" fairly exploded Mr. Damon.    \"By vol-planing down!\"    \"But, even if we do, we will fall into the ocean!\" cried Mr.  Fenwick. \"We will be drowned!\"    \"No,\" and Tom spoke more quietly than before. \"We are over a large  island.\" he went on, \"and I propose to let the disabled airship  vol-plane down to it. That is our only chance.\"    \"Over an island!\" cried Mr. Damon. He looked down "]]]
