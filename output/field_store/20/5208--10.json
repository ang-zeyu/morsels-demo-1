French is  mostly used, but the few that speak English are very proud of it  and are careful to let you know.    \"Are you ill?\" I asked.    \"The chief thinks I am,\" was the somewhat impatient reply, and she  broke down in a coughing fit.    \"How long have you had that?\" I said gravely.    \"What?\"    I tapped my chest for reply.    \"Oh! since last spring.\"    \"And you had it the spring before, too, didn't you?\"    \"Why, yes! (a pause). But that isn't what bothers me.\"    \"Isn't your husband kind to you?\"    \"Yes--sometimes.\"    \"Is this your husband?\"    \"No! F----- B----- is; I am K-----.\"    Again she was interrupted by coughing.    \"Would you like something to ease that cough?\" I asked.    \"No! It isn't the body that's sick; it's the heart.\"    \"Do you wish to tell me about it?\"    \"I lost my babies.\"    \"'When?\"    \"Two years ago. I had two little ones, and both died in one month.  I am left much alone; my husband is away on the transport; our  lodge is nearby. The chief has all these dogs; they bark at every  little thing and disturb me, so I lie awake all night and think  about my babies. But that isn't the hardest thing.\"    \"What is it?\"    She hesitated, then burst out: \"The tongues of the women. You don't  know what a hell of a place this is to live in. The women here don't  mind their work; they sit all day watching for a chance to lie about  their neighbours. If I am seen talking to you now, a story will be  made of it. If I walk to the store for a pound of tea, a story is  made of that. If I turn my head, another story; and everything is  carried to my husband to make mischief. It is nothing but lies,  lies, lies, all day, all night, all year. Women don't do that way  in your country, do they?\"    \"No,\" I replied emphatically. \"If any woman in my country were  to tell a lie to make another woman unhappy, she would be thought  very, very wicked.\"    \"I am sure of it,\" she said. \"I wish I could go to your country  and be at rest.\" She turned to her work and began talking to the  others in Chipewyan.    Now another woman entered. She was dressed in semi-white style,  and looked, not on the ground, as does an Indian woman, on seeing  a strange man, but straight at me.    \"Bon jour, madame,\" I said.    \"I speak Ingliss,\" she replied with emphasis.    \"Indeed! And what is your name?\"    \"I am Madame X-------.\"    And now I knew I was in the presence of the stuckup social queen.    After some conversation she said: \"I have some things at home you  like to see.\"    \"Where is your lodge?\" I asked.    \"Lodge,\" she replied indignantly; \"I have no lodge. I know ze Indian  way. I know ze half-breed way. I know ze white man's way. I go ze  white man's way. I live in a house--and my door is painted blue.\"    I went to her house, a 10 by 12 log cabin; but the door certainly  was painted blue, a gorgeous sky blue, the only touch of paint in  sight. Inside was all one room, with a mud fireplace at one end  and some piles of rags in the corners for beds, a table, a chair,  and some pots. On the walls snow-shoes, fishing-lines, dried fish  in smellable bunches, a portrait of the Okapi from Outing, and a  musical clock that played with painful persistence the first three  bars of \"God Save the King.\" Everywhere else were rags, mud, and  dirt. \"You see, I am joost like a white woman,\" said the swarthy  queen. \"I wear boots (she drew her bare brown feet and legs under  her) and corsets. Zey are la,\" and she pointed to the wall, where,  in very truth, tied up with a bundle of dried fish, were the articles  in question. Not simply boots and corsets, but high-heeled Louis  Quinze slippers and French corsets. I learned afterward how they  were worn. When she went shopping to the H. B. Co. store she had  to cross the \"parade\" ground, the great open space; she crowded her  brown broad feet into the slippers, then taking a final good long  breath she strapped on the fearfully tight corsets outside of all.  Now she hobbled painfully across the open, proudly conscious that  the eyes of the world were upon her. Once in the store she would  unhook the corsets and breathe comfortably till the agonized  triumphant return parade was in order.    This, however, is aside; we are still in the home of the queen. She  continued to adduce new evidences. \"I am just like a white woman.  I call my daughter darrr-leeng.\" Then turning to a fat, black-looking  squaw by the fire, she said: \"Darrr-leeng, go fetch a pail of  vaw-taire.\"    But darling, if familiar with that form of address, must have been  slumbering, for she never turned or moved a hair's-breadth or gave  a symptom of intelligence.  Now, at length it transpired that the  social leader wished to see me professionally.    \"It is ze nairves,\" she explained. \"Zere is too much going on in  this village. I am fatigue, very tired. I wish I could go away to  some quiet place for a long rest.\"    It was difficult to think of a place, short of the silent tomb,  that would be obviously quieter than Fort Smith. So I looked wise,  worked on her faith with a pill, assured her that she would soon  feel much better, and closed the blue door behind me.    With Chief Squirrel, who had been close by in most of this, I now  walked back to my tent. He told me of many sick folk and sad lodges  that needed me.    It seems that very few of these people are well. In spite of their  healthy forest lives they are far less sound than an average white  community. They have their own troubles, with the white man's maladies  thrown in. I saw numberless other cases of dreadful, hopeless,  devastating diseases, mostly of the white man's importation. It is  heart-rending to see so much human misery and be able to do nothing  at all for it, not even bring a gleam of hope. It made me feel like  a murderer to tell one after another, who came to me covered with  cankerous bone-eating sores, \"I can do nothing\"; and I was deeply  touched by the simple statement of the Chief Pierre Squirrel, after  a round of visits: \"You see how unhappy we are, how miserable and  sick. When I made this treaty with your government, I stipulated  that we should have here a policeman and a doctor; instead of that  you have sent nothing but missionaries.\"          CHAPTER XIV    RABBITS AND LYNXES IN THE NORTH-WEST        There are no Rabbits in the north-west. This statement, far from  final, is practically true to-day, but I saw plenty of Lynxes, and  one cannot write of ducks without mentioning water.    All wild animals fluctuate greatly in their population, none  more so than the Snowshoe or white-rabbit of the north-west. This  is Rabbit history as far back as known: They are spread over some  great area; conditions are favourable; some unknown influence endows  the females with unusual fecundity; they bear not one, but two or  three broods in a season, and these number not 2 or 3, but 8 or 10  each brood. The species increases far beyond the powers of predaceous  birds or beasts to check, and the Rabbits after 7 or 8 years of  this are multiplied into untold millions. On such occasions every  little thicket has a Rabbit in it; they jump out at every 8 or 10  feet; they number not less than 100 to the acre on desirable ground,  which means over 6,000 to the square mile, and a region as large as  Alberta would contain not less than 100,000,000 fat white bunnies.  At this time one man can readily kill 100 or 200 Rabbits in a day,  and every bird and beast of prey is slaughtering Rabbits without  restraint. Still they increase. Finally, they are so extraordinarily  superabundant that they threaten their own food supply as well as  poison all the ground. A new influence appears on the scene; it is  commonly called the plague, though it is not one disease but many  run epidemic riot, and, in a few weeks usually, the Rabbits are  wiped out.    This is an outline of the established routine in Rabbit vital  statistics. It, of course, varies greatly in every detail, including  time and extent of territory involved, and when the destruction is  complete it is an awful thing for the carnivores that have lived  on the bunny millions and multiplied in ratio with their abundance.  Of all the northern creatures none are more dependent on the Rabbits  than is the Canada Lynx. It lives on Rabbits, follows the Rabbits,  thinks Rabbits, tastes like Rabbits, increases with them, and on  their failure dies of starvation in the unrabbited woods.    It must have been a Hibernian familiar with the north that said:  \"A Lynx is nothing but an animated Rabbit anyway.\"    The Rabbits of the Mackenzie River Valley reached their flood  height in the winter of 1903-4. That season, it seems, they actually  reached billions.    Late the same winter the plague appeared, but did not take them at  one final swoop. Next winter they were still numerous, but in 1907  there seemed not one Rabbit left alive in the country. All that  summer we sought for them and inquired for them. We saw signs of  millions in the season gone by; everywhere were acres of saplings  barked at the snow-line; the floor of the woods, in all parts visited,  was pebbled over with pellets; but we saw not one Woodrabbit and  heard only a vague report of 3 that an Indian claimed he had seen  in a remote part of the region late in the fall.    Then, since the Lynx is the logical apex of a pyramid of Rabbits,  it naturally goes down when the Rabbits are removed.    These bobtailed cats are actually starving and ready to enter  any kind of a trap or snare that carries a bait. The slaughter of  Lynxes in its relation to the Rabbit supply is shown by the H. B.  Company fur returns as follows:      In 1900, number of skins taken 4,473   \" 1901            \"           5,781   \" 1902            \"           9,117   \" 1903            \"          19,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6840"],[0,"Queen Lucia (#12)"],[1,"to town for a rejuvenating visit  to his dentist, and the tarsomeness of being betwixt and between had  been quite forgotten by him when he saw her awake to Siegfried's line  on the mountain-top. \"_Das ist keine mann_,\" Siegfried had said,  and, to be sure, that was very clever of him, for she looked like some  slim beardless boy, and not in the least like those great fat Fraus at  Baireuth, whom nobody could have mistaken for a man as they bulged and  heaved even before the strings of the breastplate were uncut by his  sword. And then she sat up and hailed the sun, and Georgie felt for a  moment that he had quite taken the wrong turn in life, when he settled  to spend his years in this boyish, maidenly manner with his embroidery  and his china-dusting at Riseholme. He ought to have been Siegfried....  He had brought a photograph of her in her cuirass and helmet, and often  looked at it when he was not too busy with something else. He had even  championed his goddess against Lucia, when she pronounced that Wagner  was totally lacking in knowledge of dramatic effects. To be sure she  had never seen any Wagner opera, but she had heard the overture to  Tristram performed at the Queen's Hall, and if that was Wagner,  well----    Already, though Lady Ambermere's motor had not yet completely vanished  up the street, Riseholme was gently closing in round him, in order to  discover by discreet questions (as in the game of Clumps) what he and  she had been talking about. There was Colonel Boucher with his two  snorting bull-dogs closing in from one side, and Mrs Weston in her  bath-chair being wheeled relentlessly towards him from another, and the  two Miss Antrobuses sitting playfully in the stocks, on the third, and  Peppino at close range on the fourth. Everyone knew, too, that he did  not lunch till half past one, and there was really no reason why he  should not stop and chat as usual. But with the eye of the true  general, he saw that he could most easily break the surrounding cordon  by going off in the direction of Colonel Boucher, because Colonel  Boucher always said \"Haw, hum, by Jove,\" before he descended into  coherent speech, and thus Georgie could forestall him with \"Good  morning, Colonel,\" and pass on before he got to business. He did not  like passing close to those slobbering bull-dogs, but something had to  be done ... Next moment he was clear and saw that the other spies by  their original impetus were still converging on each other and walked  briskly down towards Lucia's house, to listen for any familiar noises  out of the Mozart trio. The noises were there, and the soft pedal was  down just as he expected, so, that business being off his mind, he  continued his walk for a few hundred yards more, meaning to make a  short circuit through fields, cross the bridge, over the happy stream  that flowed into the Avon, and regain his house by the door at the  bottom of the garden. Then he would sit and think ... the Guru, Olga  Bracely ... What if he asked Olga Bracely and her husband to dine, and  persuaded Mrs Quantock to let the Guru come? That would be three men  and one woman, and Hermy and Ursy would make all square. Six for dinner  was the utmost that Foljambe permitted.    He had come to the stile that led into the fields, and sat there for a  moment. Lucia's tentative melodies were still faintly audible, but soon  they stopped, and he guessed that she was looking out of the window.  She was too great to take part in the morning spying that went on round  about the Green, but she often saw a good deal from her window. He  wondered what Mrs Quantock was meaning to do. Apparently she had not  promised the Guru for the garden-party, or else Lady Ambermere would  not have said that Lucia did not know whether he was coming or not.  Perhaps Mrs Quantock was going to run him herself, and grant him  neither to Lucia nor Georgie. In that case he would certainly ask Olga  Bracely and her husband to dine, and should he or should he not ask  Lucia?    The red star had risen in Riseholme: Bolshevism was treading in its  peaceful air, and if Mrs Quantock was going to secrete her Guru, and  set up her own standard on the strength of him, Georgie felt much  inclined to ask Olga Bracely to dinner, without saying anything  whatever to Lucia about it, and just see what would happen next.  Georgie was a Bartlett on his mother's side, and he played the piano  better than Lucia, and he had twenty-four hours' leisure every day,  which he could devote to being king of Riseholme.... His nature flared  up, burning with a red revolutionary flame, that was fed by his secret  knowledge about Olga Bracely. Why should Lucia rule everyone with her  rod of iron? Why, and again why?    Suddenly he heard his name called in the familiar alto, and there was  Lucia in her Shakespeare's garden.    \"Georgino! Georgino mio!\" she cried. \"Gino!\"    Out of mere habit Georgie got down from his stile, and tripped up the  road towards her. The manly seething of his soul's insurrection rebuked  him, but unfortunately his legs and his voice surrendered. Habit was  strong....    \"Amica!\" he answered. \"Buon Giorno.\" (\"And why do I say it in Italian?\"  he vainly asked himself.)    \"Geordie, come and have ickle talk,\" she said. \"Me want 'oo wise man to  advise ickle Lucia.\"    \"What 'oo want?\" asked Georgie, now quite quelled for the moment.    \"Lots-things. Here's pwetty flower for button-holie. Now tell me about  black man. Him no snakes have? Why Mrs Quantock say she thinks he no  come to poo' Lucia's party-garden?\"    \"Oh, did she?\" asked Georgie relapsing into the vernacular.    \"Yes, oh, and by the way there's a parcel come which I think must be  the Mozart trio. Will you come over tomorrow morning and read it with  me? Yes? About half-past eleven, then. But never mind that.\"    She fixed him with her ready, birdy eye.    \"Daisy asked me to ask him,\" she said, \"and so to oblige poor Daisy I  did. And now she says she doesn't know if he'll come. What does that  mean? Is it possible that she wants to keep him to herself? She has  done that sort of thing before, you know.\"    This probably represented Lucia's statement of the said case about the  Welsh attorney, and Georgie taking it as such felt rather embarrassed.  Also that bird-like eye seemed to gimlet its way into his very soul,  and divine the secret disloyalty that he had been contemplating. If she  had continued to look into him, he might not only have confessed to the  gloomiest suspicions about Mrs Quantock, but have let go of his secret  about Olga Bracely also, and suggested the possibility of her and her  husband being brought to the garden-party. But the eye at this moment  unscrewed itself from him again and travelled up the road.    \"There's the Guru,\" she said. \"Now we will see!\"    Georgie, faint with emotion, peered out between the form of the peacock  and the pine-apple on the yew-hedge, and saw what followed. Lucia went  straight up to the Guru, bowed and smiled and clearly introduced  herself. In another moment he was showing his white teeth and  salaaming, and together they walked back to The Hurst, where Georgie  palpitated behind the yew-hedge. Together they entered and Lucia's eye  wore its most benignant aspect.    \"I want to introduce to you, Guru,\" she said without a stumble, \"a  great friend of mine. This is Mr Pillson, Guru; Guru, Mr Pillson. The  Guru is coming to tiffin with me, Georgie. Cannot I persuade you to  stop?\"    \"Delighted!\" said Georgie. \"We met before in a sort of way, didn't we?\"    \"Yes, indeed. So pleased,\" said the Guru.    \"Let us go in,\" said Lucia, \"It is close on lunch-time.\"    Georgie followed, after a great many bowings and politenesses from the  Guru. He was not sure if he had the makings of a Bolshevist. Lucia was  so marvellously efficient.          Chapter FIVE      One of Lucia's greatnesses lay in the fact that when she found anybody  out in some act of atrocious meanness, she never indulged in any idle  threats of revenge: it was sufficient that she knew, and would take  suitable steps on the earliest occasion. Consequently when it appeared,  from the artless conversation of the Guru at lunch that the perfidious  Mrs Quantock had not even asked him whether he would like to go to  Lucia's garden party or not (pending her own decision as to what she  was meaning to do with him) Lucia received the information with the  utmost good-humour, merely saying, \"No doubt dear Mrs Quantock forgot  to tell you,\" and did not announce acts of reprisal, such as striking  Daisy off the list of her habitual guests for a week or two, just to  give her a lesson. She even, before they sat down to lunch, telephoned  over to that thwarted woman to say that she had met the Guru in the  street, and they had both felt that there was some wonderful bond of  sympathy between them, so he had come back with her, and they were just  sitting down to tiffin. She was pleased with the word \"tiffin,\" and  also liked explaining to Daisy what it meant.    Tiffin was a great success, and there was no need for the Guru to visit  the kitchen in order to make something that could be eaten without  struggle. He talked quite freely about his mission here, and Lucia and  Georgie and Peppino who had come in rather late, for he had been  obliged to go back to the market-gardener's about the bulbs, listened  entranced.    \"Yes, it was when I went to my friend who keeps the book-shop,\" he  said, \"that I knew there was English lady who wanted Guru, and I knew I  was called to her. No luggage, no anything at all: as I am. Such a kind  lady, too, and she will get on well, but she will find some of the  postures difficult, for she is what you call globe, round.\"    \"Was that postures when I saw her standing on one leg in the garden?\"  asked Georgie, \"and when she sat down and tried to hold her toes?\"    \"Yes, indeed, quite so, and difficult for globe. But she has white  soul.\"    "]]]
