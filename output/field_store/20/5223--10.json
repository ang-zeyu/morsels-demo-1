[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7060"],[0,"At Agincourt (#12)"],[1," eight feet long, elevated at short intervals behind these, were so  placed as to afford shelter to the men coming down to the mantlets in  front. They stood in two lines; they were some twenty feet apart, but  those in one line alternated with those in the other. Guy soon saw the  object of this arrangement. Men were darting to and fro across the  interval some six feet wide between the two lines. Thus they had but ten  feet to run from the shelter on one side to that on the other, and exposed  themselves but for an instant to the aim of the archers. Some of the men  carried great bundles of faggots, others had sacks on their shoulders.    \"Do not heed the mantlets in front,\" said Dickon, who was in command of  the six archers near Guy, \"but pick off those fellows as they come down.  Shoot in turn; it is no use wasting two arrows on one man. Don't loose  your shaft until a man is within three mantlets from the end; then if one  misses, the next can take him when he runs across next time. That is  right, Hal,\" he broke off, as an arrow sped and a man with a sack on his  shoulder rolled over. \"Now, lads, we ought not to miss them by this  light.\"    Eleven men fell, out of the next twelve who attempted to carry their  burdens down. Guy went back to Sir Eustace with the news of the manner in  which the attack was being carried on, and of the effect of the archers'  defence.    \"I have just heard the same from the other side; there is one attack on  each side and two behind; Jean Bouvard has posted himself there. I am  going round myself now; I do not think there will be any attack made in  front. I have sent the archers here to the rear, where they will be more  useful; the fellows in the outwork across there have enough to do to  shelter themselves.\"    This Guy could well understand, for although the guns could not be  depressed sufficiently to fire down into the _tete du pont_, the mangonels  were hurling stones into it, and the men-at-arms shooting cross-bow  quarrels whenever a man showed himself. The rear of the outwork was open  and afforded no shelter to those who had taken possession of it, and  already the greater portion had retired to the other side of the small  moat surrounding it, where they lay sheltered by the outwork itself. It  was not long before the assailants at the other points, finding that the  plan they had formed was defeated by the skill of the archers, poured down  in a mass between the two lines of mantlets, each man carrying his burden  before him, thus sheltering him to a great extent. Against this method of  attack the archers could do little, and now confined themselves to  shooting at the men who, having thrown down the fascines or sacks by the  edge of the moat, stood for a moment and hesitated before running back to  the shelter of the mantlets, and not one in three got off scot-free. Guy  on going round the wall found the same state of things at each of the  other three points of assault. Numbers of the enemy were falling, but  great piles of materials were accumulating at the edge of the moat. After  a time a number of knights and men-at-arms, fully protected by armour,  came down and began to hurl the sacks and bags into the moat, their  operations being covered as much as possible by a storm of missiles shot  through holes in the mantlets. In a short time Sir Eustace ordered the  archers to desist shooting, for they were obliged, in order to aim at  those so much below them, to expose a considerable portion of their  bodies, and three were killed by the enemy's missiles.    \"We can't prevent them from filling up the moat,\" he said, \"and it is but  throwing away life to try to do so.\"    The archers were accordingly placed in the projecting turrets, where,  without being themselves exposed, they could shoot through the loopholes  at any point on the face of the walls. It was not long before the moat was  bridged at all four points of attack. Ladders were then brought down. This  the assailants were able to accomplish without loss, as, instead of  carrying them, they were pushed backwards and forwards by men stationed  behind the mantlets, and were so zigzagged down to the moat without the  defenders being able to offer any opposition. Then rushes were made by  parties of knights, the ladders were placed, and the fight began in  earnest.    In the great court-yard the leader of the English men-at-arms was placed  with twelve of his men as a reserve. They were to be summoned by one, two,  three, or four blasts of a horn to the point at which their services were  most required. The assaults were obstinate, but the walls were as stoutly  defended. Sometimes the ladders were hurled back by poles with an iron  fork at the end; buckets of boiling water and tar were poured over on to  the assailants as they clambered up, and lime cast over on those waiting  to take their turns to ascend; while with spear, axe, and mace the men-at-arms and tenants met the assailants as they endeavoured to get a footing  on the wall.    Guy had placed himself with the party to which he had first gone, and,  taking a pike from a fallen man, was fighting stoutly. The archers from  their turrets kept up a constant flight of arrows on the crowd below. Only  once was the horn sounded for the aid of the reserve. Sir Eustace had  taken the command at the rear, while Jean Bouvard headed the defence on  the side opposite to that at which Guy was fighting. The defenders under  Sir Eustace had the hardest work to hold their own, being assaulted at two  points. This was evidently the main place of attack, for here Sir Clugnet  himself and several of his knights led the assault, and at one time  succeeded in gaining a footing on the wall at one point, while Sir Eustace  was at the other. Then the knight blew his horn, and at the same time  called the archers from the turret nearest to him, while some of the other  party on the wall rushed to aid him of their own accord and, pressing  through the tenants, opposed themselves to the knights and men-at-arms who  had obtained a footing on the wall.    Their strength, and the power with which they wielded their heavy axes, so  held the assailants in check that they could not gain space sufficient for  others to join them, and when the reserve ran up, so fierce an attack was  made upon the knights that several were beaten down and the rest forced to  spring over the wall at the risk of life and limb. Sir Clugnet himself was  the last to do this, and was carried away insensible. Two or three of his  companions were killed by the fall, but the rest, leaping far enough out  to alight beyond the solid ground at the foot of the walls, had their fall  broken by the yielding mass of materials by which they had crossed the  moat. A loud shout of triumph rose from the defenders, and was re-echoed  by shouts from the other walls. As soon as the news of the repulse at the  rear reached the other parties, and that Sir Clugnet was badly hurt, while  several of the knights were killed, the assault ceased at once, and the  Orleanists withdrew, followed by derisive cries from the defenders.    \"Thanks be to the saints that it is all over,\" Sir Eustace said, as he  opened his vizor; \"it was a close thing here, and for a time I feared that  the outer wall was lost. However, I think that there is an end of it now,  and by the morning we shall find that they have moved off. They must have  suffered very heavily; certainly three or four hundred must have fallen,  for we must admit that they fought stoutly. You have all done well, my  friends, and I thank you heartily. Now, the first thing is to fetch the  wounded down to the hall prepared for them. Father Gregory has all in  readiness for them there. Guy, go round and find who have fallen, and see  them carried reverently down to the court-yard, send me a list of their  names, and place two men-at-arms at each point where the assault took  place. Tom, do you similarly dispose eight of your archers so that should  they send a spy up to see if we sleep, a message can be sent back in the  shape of a cloth-yard shaft. Bid all the tenants and retainers leave the  wall; a horn will recall them should there be need. I will myself visit  them shortly, and thank them for their stout defence. I will send round a  cup of spiced wine to each man on the wall as soon as it can be prepared,  to that all may slake their thirst after their efforts.\"    Sir Eustace then made his way down from the wall to his Apartments, where  Dame Margaret was awaiting him. She hurried to meet him.    \"Wait, wife, till I have removed my helmet, and even then you must be  careful how you embrace me, for methinks there is more than one blood-stain on my armour, though happily not of mine own. All has gone well,  love, and methinks that we shall hear no more of them; but they fought  more stoutly than I had given them credit for, seeing that they were but a  mixed rabble, with a small proportion of real men-at-arms among them. I  suppose Henry brought you my message to close the inner gates, as they had  gained a footing on the walls.\"    \"No, I received no message since the one he brought me half an hour ago,  saying that all was going well, and I thought that he was with you. Where  can he be, Eustace?\" she asked anxiously.    \"I know not indeed, Margaret, but will search at once. While I do so will  you go to the hall that you have prepared for the wounded, and give what  aid you can there? Do not fear for the boy; he turned and ran off when I  spoke to him, and as his head reaches not to the top of the battlements no  harm can have befallen him, though in truth I cannot think what can have  delayed him.\"    He called to two or three of the men below to take torches, and to  accompany him at once, and sent others to the sheds to ask if he had been  seen there, then went up to the top of the inner wall and crossed the  bridge at the back.    [Illustration: \"SIR EUSTACE"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7065"],[0,"Children of the Bush (#12)"],[1,"on, and swore at him. `I'll make it damned hot  for you, Bogan,' he said, `if I have to come over for you.'    \"`Two can play at that game,' says Bogan.    \"`Look here, Bogan,\" said Campbell, `I'll tell you what I'll do. If you  give me your word that you'll come up to the police station to-morrow  I'll go back and say nothing about it. You can say you didn't know a  warrant was out after you. It will be all the better for you in the end.  Better give me your word, man.'    \"Perhaps Campbell knew Bogan better than any of us.    \"`Now then, Bogan,' he said, `don't be a fool. Give your word like a  sensible man, and I'll go back. I'll give you five minutes to make up  your mind.' And he took out his watch.    \"But Bogan was nasty and wouldn't give his word, so there was nothing  for it but for Campbell to make a try for him.    \"Campbell had plenty of pluck, or obstinacy, which amounts to the same  thing. He put his carbine and revolver under a log, out of the rain that  was coming on, saw to his handcuffs, and then spurred his horse into the  water. Bogan lit his pipe with a stick from his camp-fire--so Campbell  said afterwards--and sat down on his heels and puffed away, and waited  for him.    \"Just as Campbell's horse floundered into the current Bogan shouted to  go back, but Campbell thought it was a threat and kept on. But Bogan  had caught sight of a log coming down the stream, end on, with a sharp,  splintered end, and before Campbell knew where he was, the sharp end of  the log caught the horse in the flank. The horse started to plunge and  struggle sideways, with all his legs, and Campbell got free of him as  quick as he could. Now, you know, in some of those Darling River reaches  the current will seem to run steadily far a while, and then come with a  rush. (I was caught in one of those rushes once, when I was in swimming,  and would have been drowned if I hadn't been born to be hanged.) Well,  a rush came along just as Campbell got free from his horse, and he  went down-stream one side of a snag and his horse the other. Campbell's  pretty stout, you know, and his uniform was tight, and it handicapped  him.    \"Just as he was being washed past the lower end of the snag he caught  hold of a branch that stuck out of the water and held on. He swung round  and saw Bogan running down to the point opposite him. Now, you know  there was always a lot of low cunning about Bogan, and I suppose he  reckoned that if he pulled Campbell out he'd stand a good show of  getting clear of his trouble; anyway, if he didn't save Campbell it  might be said that he killed him--besides, Bogan was a good swimmer, so  there wasn't any heroism about it anyhow. Campbell was only a few feet  from the bank, but Bogan started to strip--to make the job look as big  as possible, I suppose. He shouted to Campbell to say he was coming,  and to hold on. Campbell said afterwards that Bogan seemed an hour  undressing. The weight of the current was forcing down the bough that  Campbell was hanging on to, and suddenly, he said, he felt a great  feeling of helplessness take him by the shoulders. He yelled to Bogan  and let go.    \"Now, it happened that Jake Boreham and I were passing away the time  between shearings, and we were having a sort of fishing and shooting  loaf down the river in a boat arrangement that Jake had made out of  boards and tarred canvas. We called her the _Jolly Coffin_. We were just  poking up the bank in the slack water, a few hundred yards below the  billabong, when Jake said, `Why, there's a horse or something in the  river.' Then he shouted, `No, by God, it's a man,' and we poked the  _Coffin_ out into the stream for all she was worth. `Looks like two men  fighting in the water,' Jake shouts presently. `Hurry up, or they'll  drown each other.'    \"We hailed 'em, and Bogan shouted for help. He was treading water and  holding Campbell up in front of him now in real professional style. As  soon as he heard us he threw up his arms and splashed a bit--I reckoned  he was trying to put as much style as he could into that rescue. But I  caught a crab, and, before we could get to them, they were washed past  into the top of a tree that stood well below flood-mark. I pulled the  boat's head round and let her stern down between the branches. Bogan had  one arm over a limb and was holding Campbell with the other, and  trying to lift him higher out of the water. I noticed Bogan's face  was bleeding--there was a dead limb stuck in the tree with nasty sharp  points on it, and I reckoned he'd run his face against one of them.  Campbell was gasping like a codfish out of water, and he was the  whitest man I ever saw (except one, and _he'd_ been drowned for a week).  Campbell had the sense to keep still. We asked Bogan if he could hold  on, and he said he could, but he couldn't hold Campbell any longer.  So Jake took the oars and I leaned over the stern and caught hold of  Campbell, and Jake ran the boat into the bank, and we got him ashore;  then we went back for Bogan and landed him.    \"We had some whisky and soon brought Campbell round; but Bogan was  bleeding like a pig from a nasty cut over his good eye, so we bound wet  handkerchiefs round his eyes and led him to a log and he sat down for  a while, holding his hand to his eye and groaning. He kept saying, `I'm  blind, mates, I'm blind! I've lost me other eye!' but we didn't dream  it was so bad as that: we kept giving him whisky. We got some dry boughs  and made a big fire. Then Bogan stood up and held his arms stiff down  to his sides, opening and shutting his hands as if he was in great pain.  And I've often thought since what a different man Bogan seemed without  his clothes and with the broken bridge of his nose and his eyes covered  by the handkerchiefs. He was clean shaven, and his mouth and chin are  his best features, and he's clean limbed and well hung. I often thought  afterwards that there was something of a blind god about him as he stood  there naked by the fire on the day he saved Campbell's life--something  that reminded me of a statue I saw once in the Art Gallery. (Pity the  world isn't blinder to a man's worst points.)    \"Presently Jake listened and said, `By God, that's lucky!' and we heard  a steamer coming up-river and presently we saw her coming round the  point with a couple of wool-barges in tow. We got Bogan aboard and got  some clothes on him, and took him ashore at Bourke to the new hospital.  The doctors did all they knew, but Bogan was blind for life. He never  saw anything again--except `a sort of dull white blur,' as he called  it--or his past life sometimes, I suppose. Perhaps he saw that for the  first time. Ah, well!    \"Bogan's old enemy, Barcoo-Rot, went to see him in the hospital, and  Bogan said, `Well, Barcoo, I reckon we've had our last fight. I owe you  a hiding, but I don't see how I'm going to pay you.' `Never mind that,  Bogan, old man,' says Barcoo. `I'll take it from anyone yer likes to  appoint, if that worries yer; and, look here, Bogan, if I can't fight  you I can fight for you--and don't you forget it!' And Barcoo used to  lead Bogan round about town in his spare time and tell him all that was  going on; and I believe he always had an ear cocked in case someone said  a word against Bogan--as if any of the chaps would say a word against a  blind man.    \"Bogan's case was hushed up. The police told us to fix it up the best  way we could. One of the jackaroos, who reckoned that Bogan had swindled  him, was a gentleman, and he was the first to throw a quid in the  Giraffe's hat when it went round for Bogan, but the other jackaroo was  a cur: he said he wanted the money that Bogan had robbed him of. There  were two witnesses, but we sent 'em away, and Tom Hall, there, scared  the jackaroo. You know Tom was always the best hand we had at persuading  witnesses in Union cases to go home to see their mothers.\"    \"How did you scare that jackaroo, Tom?\" I asked.    \"Tell you about it some other time,\" said Tom.    \"Well,\" said Mitchell, \"Bogan was always a good woolsorter, so, next  shearing, old Baldy Thompson--(you know Baldy Thompson, Harry, of  West-o'-Sunday Station)--Baldy had a talk with some of the chaps, and  took Bogan out in his buggy with him to West-o'-Sunday. Bogan would sit  at the end of the rolling tables, in the shearing-shed, with a boy to  hand him the fleeces, and he'd feel a fleece and tell the boy what bin  to throw it into; and by and by he began to learn to throw the fleeces  into the bins himself. And sometimes Baldy would have a sheep brought to  him and get him to feel the fleece and tell him the quality of it. And  then again Baldy would talk, just loud enough for Bogan to overhear, and  swear that he'd sooner have Bogan, blind as he was, than half a dozen  scientific jackaroo experts with all their eyes about them.    \"Of course Bogan wasn't worth anything much to Baldy, but Baldy gave him  two pounds a week out of his own pocket, and another quid that we made  up between us; so he made enough to pull him through the rest of the  year.    \"It was curious to see how soon he learned to find his way about the hut  and manage his tea and tucker. It was a rough shed, but everybody was  eager to steer Bogan about--and, in fact, two of them had a fight about  it one day. Baldy and all of us----and especially visitors when they  came--were mighty interested in Bogan; and I reckon we were rather proud  of having a blind wool-sorter. I reckon Bogan had thirty or forty pairs  of eyes watching out for him in case he'd run against something or fall.  It irritated him to be messed round too much--he said a baby would never  learn to walk if it was held all the time. He reckoned he'd learn more  in a year than a man who'd served a lifetime to blindness; but we didn't  let him wander much--for fear he'd fall into the big rocky waterhole  there, by accident.    \"And after the shearing-season Bogan's wife turned up in"]]]
