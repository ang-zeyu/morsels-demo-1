With that weapon he kills a sheep, cuts off the head of a  serpent--seemingly, however, not doing it much harm, for it still  wriggles--sticks his horse when in anger, and, alas, as I have said,  sometimes stabs his fellow-man. Being so far isolated from the coast,  he is necessarily entirely uneducated. The forward march of the outer  world concerns him not; indeed he imagines that his native prairie  stretches away to the end of the world. He will gaze with wonder on  your watch, for his only mode of ascertaining the time is by the shadow  the sun casts. As that luminary rises and sets, so he sleeps and wakes.  His only bed is the sheepskin, which when riding he fastens over his  saddle, and the latter article forms his pillow. His coverlet is the  firmament of heaven, the Southern Cross and other constellations,  unseen by dwellers in the Northern Hemisphere, seeming to keep watch  over him; or in the colder season his poncho, which I have already  described. Around his couch flit the fireflies, resembling so many  stars of earth with their strangely radiant lights. The brightness of  one, when held near the face of my watch, made light enough to enable  me to ascertain the hour, even on the darkest night.    The Gaucho with his horse is at home anywhere. When on a journey he  will stop for the evening meal beside the dry bones of some dead  animal. With these and grass he will make a fire and cook the meat he  carries hanging behind him on the saddle. I have known an animal killed  and the meat cooked with its own bones, but this is not usual. Dry  bones burn better, and thistle-stalks better still. He will then lie  down on mother earth with the horse-cloth under him and the saddle for  a pillow. When travelling with these men I have known them, without any  comment, stretch themselves on the ground, even though the rain was  falling, and soon be in dreamland. After having passed a wretched night  myself, I have asked them, \"How did you sleep?\" _\"Muy Bien, Senor\"_  (Very good, sir), has been the invariable answer. They would often  growl much, however, over the wet saddle-cloths, for these soon cause a  horse's back to become sore.    Here and there, but sometimes at long distances apart, there is a  _pulperia_ on the road. This is always designated by having a white  flag flying on the end of a long bamboo. At these places cheap spirits  of wine and very bad rum can be bought, along with tobacco, hard  ship-biscuits (very often full of maggots, as I know only too well),  and a few other more necessary things. I have observed in some of these  wayside inns counters made of turf, built in blocks as bricks would be.  Here the natives stop to drink long and deep, and stew their meagre  brains in bad spirits. These draughts result in quarrels and sometimes  in murder.    The Gaucho, like the Indian, cannot drink liquor without becoming  maddened by it. He will then do things which in his sober moments he  would not dream of. I was acquainted with a man who owned a horse of  which he was very fond This animal bore him one evening to a pulperia  some miles distant, and was left tied outside while he imbibed his fill  inside. Coming out at length beastly intoxicated, he mounted his horse  and proceeded homeward. Arriving at a fork in the path, the faithful  horse took the one leading home, but the rider, thinking in his stupor  that the other way was the right one, turned the horse's head. As the  poor creature wanted to get home and have the saddle taken off, it  turned again. This affront was too much for the Gaucho, who is a man of  volcanic passions, so drawing his knife, he stabbed it in the neck, and  they dropped to the ground together. When he realized that he had  killed his favorite horse he cried like a child. I passed this dead  animal several times afterwards and saw the vultures clean its bones.  It served me as a witness to the results of ungoverned passion.    The Gaucho does not, and would not under any consideration, ride a  mare; consequently, for work she is practically valueless. Strain, who  rode across the pampas, says: \"In a single year ten million hides were  exported.\" For one or two dollars each the buyer may purchase any  number; indeed, of such little worth are the mares that they are very  often killed for their hide, or to serve as food for swine. At one  estancia I visited I was informed that one was killed each day for pig  feed. The mare can be driven long distances, even a hundred miles a  day, for several successive days, The Argentine army must surely be the  most mobile of any in the world, for its soldiers, when on the march,  get nothing but mare's flesh and the custom gives them great facility  of movement. The horse has, more or less, its standard value, and costs  four or five times the price of the mare.      [Illustration: THE AUTHOR IN GAUCHO DRESS.]      Sometimes it happens that the native finds a colt which is positively  untamable. On the cheek of such an animal the Gaucho will burn a cross  and then allow it to go free, like the scape-goat mentioned in the book  of Leviticus.    The native horse is rather small, but very wiry and wild. I was once  compelled, through sickness, to make a journey of ninety-seven miles,  being in the saddle for seventeen consecutive hours, and yet my poor  horse was unable to get one mouthful of food on the journey, and the  saddle was not taken off his back for a moment. He was very wild, yet  one evening between five and eight o'clock, he bore me safely a  distance of thirty-six miles, and returned the same distance with me on  the following morning. He had not eaten or drunk anything during the  night, for the locusts had devoured all pasturage and no rain had  fallen for a space of five months.    The horse is not indigenous to America, although Darwin tells us that  South America had a native horse, which lived and disappeared ages ago.  Spanish history informs us that they were first landed in Buenos Ayres  in 1537. We are further told that the Indians flew away in terror at  the sight of a man on horseback, which they took to be one animal of a  strange, two-headed shape. When the colony was for a time deserted  these horses were suffered to run wild. Those animals so multiplied and  spread over such a vast area that they were found, forty-three years  later, even down to the Straits of Magellan, a distance of eleven  hundred miles. With good pasture and a limitless expanse to roam over,  they soon turned from the dozens to thousands, and may now be counted  by millions. The Patagonian \"foot\" Indians quickly turned into \"horse\"  Indians, for on those wide prairie lands a man without a horse is  almost comparable to a man without legs. In former years, thousands of  wild horses roamed over these extensive plains, but the struggle of  mankind in the battle of life turned men's attention to them, and they  were captured and branded by whomsoever had the power and cared to take  the trouble. In the more isolated districts, there may still be found  numbers which are born and die without ever feeling the touch of saddle  or bridle. Far away from the crowded busses and perpetually moving  hansoms of the city, they feel not the driver's whip nor the strain of  the wagon, as, with tail trailing on the ground and head erect, they  gallop in freedom of life. Happy they!    In all directions on the prairie ostriches are found. The natives catch  them with _boliadoras_, an old Indian weapon, which is simply three  round stones, incased in bags of hide, tied together by twisted ropes,  also of hide. When the hunters have, by galloping from different  directions, baffled the bird in his flight, they thunder down upon him,  and, throwing the _boliadoras_ round his legs, where they entangle,  effectually stop his flight. I have seen this weapon thrown a distance  of about eighty yards.    The ostrich is a bird with wonderful digestive powers, which I often  have envied him; he eats grass or pebbles, insects or bones, as suits  his varying fancy. If you drop your knife or any other article, he will  stop to examine it, being most inquisitive, and, if possible, he will  swallow it. The flesh of the ostrich is dry and tough, and its feathers  are not to be compared in beauty with those of the African specimen.  Generally a very harmless bird, he is truly formidable during breeding  time. If one of the eggs is so much as touched he will break the whole  number to shivers. Woe to the man whom he savagely attacks at such  times; one kick of his great foot, with its sharp claws, is sufficient  to open the body of man or horse. The Gaucho uses the skin from the  neck of this bird as a tobacco pouch, and the eggs are considered a  great delicacy. One is equal to about sixteen hen's eggs.    As all creation has its enemy, the ostrich finds his in the _iguana_,  or lizard--an unsightly, scaly, long-tailed species of land crocodile.  This animal, when full-grown, attains the length of five feet, and is  of a dark green color. He, when he can procure them, feeds on the  ostrich eggs, which I believe must be a very strengthening diet. The  lizard, after fattening himself upon them during the six hotter months  of the year, is enabled to retire to the recesses of his cave, where he  tranquilly sleeps through the remaining six. The shell of the ostrich's  egg is about the thickness of an antique china cup, but the iguana  finds no difficulty in breaking it open with a slash of his tail This  wily animal is more astute than the bird, which lays its eggs in the  open spaces, for the lizard, with her claws, digs a hole in the ground,  in which hers are dropped to the number of dozens. The lizard does not  provide shells for her eggs, but only covers them with a thick, soft  skin, and they, buried in the soil, eventually hatch themselves.

But regrets were now unavailing, and he lost no time in useless  lamentations, setting to work at once. It was tedious labor, carrying  up the water in a small vessel, and emptying it in the tank, but he  persevered, and at the end of a couple of hours the task was  completed.    'I can make the wood stand me another day,' he added, as he stood  looking at the greatly diminished pile, 'although, if I knew where to  get it, I would load up now, and then I should be prepared.'    He suddenly paused, for scarcely a dozen yards away, coming up the  margin of the river, straight toward him, he descried the figure of a  man fully six feet and a half high.    Young Brainerd's first impulse was to spring into the wagon and start  away at full speed; but a second glance showed him that it was not an  Indian, but a white man, in the garb of a hunter.    'Hullo, boss, thar, what yer doin'?'    He was at a loss what reply to make, and therefore made none. The next  moment the giant hunter was beside him.    'B'ars and bufflers! younker, what ye got thar?' he demanded, eyeing  the steam man with an expression of the most amazed wonder. 'I say,  what do yer call that thing?'    'That,' laughed Johnny, who could not avoid a feeling of strong  apprehension at the singular appearance of the strange hunter, 'is a  sort of peregrinating locomotive.'    'Paggyratin' locomotive, what's that?' he asked, in a gruff voice, and  with an expression of great disgust at the unfamiliar words employed.    'You have seen a locomotive, haven't you?'    'Reckon I hev, down in St. Louey.'    'Well, this is something on the same principle, except that it uses  legs instead of wheels.'    'Can that ere thing walk?'    'Yes, sir, and run, too; it traveled all the way from the Missouri  river to this place.'    The huge hunter turned upon him with a fierce expression.    'Yer can't fool this yar boss in that style.'    'Don't you believe me?' asked the boy, who was fearful of offending  the stranger.    'No, sar; not a word.'    'How do you suppose we got it here?'    'Fotched in a wagon.'    'Let me show you what he can do.'    He was about to step into the wagon, when the hunter stopped him.    'See hyar, younker, who mought yer be?'    The boy gave his name and residence.    'What yer doin' hyar?'    'I'm traveling with this machine of mine.'    'How do you git it along?'    'I was just going to show you when you stopped me.'    'Hold on; no need of bein' in a sweat about it. Do yer come alone?'    'No. I came with a hunter.'    'What war his name?'    'Baldy Bicknell.'    'B'ars and bufflers! did yer come with him?'    'Yes; he was my companion all the way.'    'Whar mought he be?'    Johnny Brainerd hesitated a moment. While the huge hunter might  possibly be of great service to the beleaguered miners, yet he  recollected that it was the desire of Baldy that the fact of gold  existing in Wolf Ravine should be kept a secret from all except their  own party.    Should it become known to any of the numerous hunters and emigrants  who were constantly passing in the neighborhood, there would be such a  flocking to the place that they would be driven away and probably  killed for the treasure that they had already obtained.    The boy, therefore, chose to make a non-committal reply:    'Baldy is some distance away, in camp.'    'And what are yer doin' hyar?'    'I stopped here to get water for this steam man, as we call him. You  know anything that travels by steam must have the water to generate  it.'    'I say, younker, I don't want none of yer big words to me. Ef I h'ar  any more, b'ars and bufflers, ef I don't crack yer over the head with  Sweetlove, my shootin'-iron, so mind what yer say, fur I won't stand  no nonsense.'    'I didn't wish to offend you,' returned the boy, in the meekest of  tones.    'How far away might be Baldy?'    'I couldn't tell you exactly, but I think it is less than ten miles.'    'Be you goin' back to camp to-night?'    'It was my intention, that is, I meant to do so.'    'Guess I'll go with yer; but see hyar, younker, let's see yer try that  old humbug of yourn.'    The boy sprung into the wagon, glad of the opportunity of getting rid  of what looked like a dangerous man. Before he could start he was  again peremptorily stopped.    'Yer see, I b'leeve yar a humbug, but if that ole thing does run, and,  mind, I tell yer, I don't b'leeve it will, do yer know what I'm goin'  to do?'    'I do not.'    'I'm goin' to take it myself to chase rod-skins in. It won't bother  yer much fur them long legs of yourn to carry that humpback home  again. So, younker, start now, and let us see what yer can do.'    The boy let on steam, and the man started off on a moderate gait,  which rapidly increased to a swift one. The huge, wonder-stricken  hunter watched it until it gradually faded out of sight in the gloom,  and still watched the place where it had disappeared, and though he  watched much longer, with a savage and vindictive heart, yet it never  came back to him again.                        CHAPTER XV. THE ATTACK IN THE RAVINE.    IN THE mean time, the situation of our friends in Wolf Ravine was  becoming perilous to the last degree.    Before going to work, on the morning of the steam man's excursion to  the mountains, Baldy Bicknell made a reconnoissance of the ravine, to  assure himself that there was no danger of being suddenly overwhelmed,  while delving for the precious yellow sand.    He saw abundant signs of Indians having recently visited the place,  but he concluded there were none in the immediate vicinity, and that  comparatively little risk was run in the boy making his wished-for  visit to the mountains in the west.    Through the center of the ravine ran a small stream of water, hardly  of enough volume to be used for washing gold without a dam being  created. It looked as if this had once been the head of a large  stream, and that the golden sand had been drifted to this spot, by the  force of the powerful current.    The auriferous particles were scattered over the entire breadth of the  ravine, for the distance of several hundred feet, being found in the  richest deposits between the ledges and rocks, in the bottom of the  channel, where, as may well be supposed, it was no easy matter to  obtain.    A short distance back of the 'diggings,' where the vast masses of  rocks assumed curiously grotesque forms, the miners discovered a rude  cave, where they at once established their headquarters. A tiny stream  ran through the bottom of it, and with a little placing of the close  bowlders, they speedily put it in the best condition of defense.    It was almost entirely surrounded by trees, there was one spot where a  thin man, like Hopkins or Baldy, could draw his body through and climb  a luxuriant cottonwood, whose top have a wide view of the surrounding  plain.    The day passed away without any signs of Indians, Baldy occasionally  ascending the side of the ravine, and scanning the plains in every  direction, on the constant lookout for the insidious approach of their  enemies.    Just before nightfall, while all three were at work, a rifle was  discharged, and the bullet was imbedded in the tough oaken handle of  the spade with which the trapper was digging.    'Whar in thunder did that come from?' he demanded, dropping the  implement, catching up the rifle, and glaring savagely about him.    But neither of the others could answer him, and climbing up the bank,  he looked fiercely around for some evidence of the whereabouts of his  treacherous foe.    The latter remained invisible, but several hundred yards down the  ravine, he caught a glimpse of enough Indians dodging hither and  thither to satisfy him that there was quite a formidable force in the  valley.    Giving the alarm to his companions, all three withdrew within the  cave, not the less willingly, as it was very near their usual quitting  time.    'Begorrah! and what'll becoom of the shtame mian and the boy?'  inquired Mickey, as he hastily obeyed orders.    'Jerusalem!' exclaimed the Yankee, in great trepidation, 'if he isn't  warned, they'll catch him sure, and then what'll become of us? We'll  have to walk all the way hum.'    As the best means of communicating with him, the trapper climbed  through the narrow opening, and to the top of the tree, where he  ensconced himself, just as the steam man uttered its interrogative  whistle.    The trapper, as we have shown in another place, replied by pantomime,  not wishing to discover his whereabouts to the enemy, as he had a dim  idea that this means of egress might possibly prove of some use to  him, in the danger that was closing around them.    When Johnny Brainerd recognized his signal, and beat a retreat, Baldy  began a cautious descent to his cave again. At this time it was  already growing dark, and he had to feel his way down again.    And so it came about, that not until he had reached the lowest limb,  did his trained ear detest a slight rustling on the ground beneath.  Supposing it to be either Mickey or Ethan, he continued his descent,  merely glancing below. But at that moment something suspicious caught  his eye, and peering down more carefully, he discovered a crouching  Indian, waiting with drawn knife until he should come within his  reach.    The trapper was no coward, and had been in many a hand to-hand tussle  before; but there was something in the character of the danger which  would have made it more pleasant for him to hesitate awhile until he  could learn its precise dimensions; but time was too precious, and the  next moment, he had dropped directly by the side of the red-skin.    The latter intended to make the attack, but without waiting for him,  Baldy sprung like a panther upon him and bore him to the earth. There  was a silent but terrific struggle for a few moments, but the  prodigious activity and rower of the trapper prevailed,"]]]
