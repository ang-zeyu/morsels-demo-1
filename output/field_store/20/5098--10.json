As it was, by the time  any was received, the people were in a starving condition, and could  not spare it.    From the third camp, where I saw the last of the brethren, an express  was sent on to catch the returning supplies and continue on to the  valley, giving word that the train was coming. I know nothing more  of them except from reports. As I am writing mainly from my own  observations, I will simply state that after great suffering and much  assistance (hundreds turning out to help) the emigrants were finally  landed in the valley.        CHAPTER XIV.    We kill our Cattle to keep Them from Wolves--Visit from Two  Brethren--Letter from President Young--A Mail Company nearly Perishes.    I left the company feeling a little downcast, to return to Devil's  Gate. It was pretty well understood that there would be no relief  sent us. My hopes were that we could kill game. We had accepted the  situation, and as far as Capt. Grant was concerned he had done as much  as he could for us. There was more risk for those who went on than for  us remaining.    On returning to camp, I found that the cattle left were very poor. The  weather had moderated and we hoped to get them on good feed and recruit  them a little. Over two hundred head of cattle had died in the vicinity  of the fort. Along the road each way for a day's travel were carcases.  This led droves of prairie wolves into our camp, it was almost  impossible to keep them off from the cattle in the day time. We were  obliged to corral them at night. Once in the day time a small bunch was  taken and run off in spite of the efforts of the herders to stop them.  In fact, it became dangerous to face these wolves, they were at times  almost ready to attack men.    We soon found it would be impossible to save the cattle. Already some  twenty-five had died or been killed by the wolves within a week. It was  decided to kill the rest, some fifty head. A few were in living order,  but many would have died within twenty-four hours. In fact we killed  them to keep them from dying. We had a first-class butcher from London,  who dressed everything in the best style. Everything was saved that we  thought might be eaten. We hung the meat up. The poorest of it we did  not expect to eat, but intended to use it for wolf bait further along  when the carcases were all devoured, provided we could get traps from  the Platte bridge, which we afterwards did. We never used our poor beef  for wolf bait as we had to eat the whole of it ourselves, and finally  the hides were all consumed for food.    After killing the cattle we had nothing much to do but fix up the fort  and look after four ponies we had left. Brother Hampton and myself had  our saddle horses yet in good order.    There were plenty of guns and ammunition left with us, also dishes and  cooking utensils. After thoroughly repairing the houses, chinking and  daubing them, we overhauled the goods stored away.    While storing the bales and boxes the snow had drifted in among them.  There was nothing but dirt floors and the goods had been tumbled in  without any regard to order. Having cleaned out everything, we took ox  yokes, of which there were a great many, and made floors of them and  then piled the goods on them. While handling the goods we found some  coffee, sugar and fruit, also a roll of leather. These we kept out and  put in our store room for use. We also found a box of soap and candles.  These goods were marked F. D. Richards, Daniel Spencer, John Van Cott,  James Furgeson, William Dunbar, Cyrus Wheelock and Chauncy Webb; most  of them John Van Cott. We were told by Captain Grant to use anything we  could find to make us comfortable.    During the time we were at a loss what to do, men's minds did not run  much upon property, the main interest was to save life. One prominent  Elder became very liberal. He had several large trunks filled with  valuable stuff. He opened his heart and trunks, making presents to  several of the boys from the valley of socks, shirts and such things as  would help to make them comfortable. He left his trunks in my rooms,  giving me the keys and telling me to use anything there was, not to  suffer for anything that could be found, and asked God to bless me.    I told the boys who remained with me that we had better not open this  man's trunks, that when he got to the valley and had time to think, he  would change his mind and would doubtless be thinking we were using his  goods, and if we touched anything belonging to him we would be accused  of taking more than we had. Later occurrences proved this to be a good  suggestion.    With the cattle killed that were fit to eat, and what provisions we had  on hand, we managed to live for a while without suffering, except for  salt. Bread soon gave out and we lived on meat alone. Some of us went  out hunting daily but with poor success.    A day or two before Christmas, Ephraim Hanks and Feramorz Little  arrived at the fort, bringing the mail from the valley with the  following letter of instructions from President Young:    \"President's Office, Great Salt Lake City,                            \"Dec. 7th, 1856.    \"_Brothers Jones, Alexander and Hampton, in charge at Devil's Gate, and  the rest of the brethren at that place_:    \"Dear Brethren: Quite unexpectedly to us we have the opportunity of  sending you a few suggestions, as Judge Smith, the post master here,  has concluded to forward the eastern mail by Brothers Feramorz Little  and Ephraim Hanks.    \"Being somewhat aware of a natural disposition in many to relax  their vigilance after a temporary and unaccustomed watchfulness,  more especially in case no particular cause of alarm is of frequent  occurrence, I feel impressed to write a few suggestions and words  of counsel to you all. You are in an Indian country, few in number,  blockaded by the snows, and far from assistance at this season of  the year. Under such circumstances you can but realize the necessity  of all of you being constantly on the alert, to be firm, steady,  sober-minded and sober-bodied, united, faithful and watchful, living  your religion. Do not go from your fort in small parties of one, two  or three at a time. But when game is to be sought, wood got up, or any  other operation to be performed requiring you to travel from under  the protection of the fort guns, go in bands of some ten or twelve  together, and let them be well armed; and let those who stay by the  stuff be watchful while their comrades are out. And at all times and  under all circumstances let every person have his arms and ammunitions  ready for active service at a moment's warning, so you cannot be  surprised by your foes nor in any way be taken advantage of, whether in  or out of the fort. Always have plenty of water about the buildings,  and be very careful about fires, and the preservation from damp, fire  or other damage of the goods in your care. Unless buffaloes and other  game come within a reasonable distance, you had better kill some of the  cattle than run much risk in quest of game. Use all due diligence for  the preservation of your stock, and try to so ration out your flour as  to have it last until we can send you relief, which, as before stated,  will be forwarded as early as possible in the spring, but may not  reach you until May, depending somewhat on the winter snows and spring  weather, of which you will be able to form an estimate as the season  advances.    \"We will send teams to your relief as early as possible in the spring,  and trust to learn that all has been well with you and the property  in your care. Brothers Little and Hanks will furnish you with items  of news from the valley, and I will forward you some packages of our  papers by them.    \"Praying you may be united, faithful and protected,    \"I remain, Your brother in the gospel,                                \"Brigham Young.\"    From this letter it is plain to see that Brother Brigham was not  apprised of our condition. He afterwards said if he had known our  situation he would have relieved us if it had taken half the men in the  valley. I never felt to complain. The brethren who left us knew but  little about what was left to provision us. The supposition was that  the cattle would have furnished us in case game could not be killed.    Brother Alexander and I were out for several days, killing some game  on this trip. We were much disappointed on our return to find that  Brothers Hanks and Little had gone on east without us seeing them.  Brother Little looked around at our supplies, telling the boys to take  care of the hides, that they were better than nothing to eat. This  proved good advice.    Soon after, the Magraw mail company came along under the charge of  Jesse Jones. They left their coaches, fitted up with packs and started  for the valley. Brother Joseph L. Heywood, United States Marshal for  Utah, was a passenger. They went as far as the South Pass. The storm  setting in so severely they could not face it, they came near freezing  to death; it was with great difficulty that Brother Heywood was kept  alive.    The day they returned to our camp we had killed a buffalo some  twelve miles distant, it took all hands three days to get it into camp.  This buffalo I shot at the risk of my life. He was coming toward me in  a snow trail. I lay on the trail with nothing to protect me. If I had  not killed him he would doubtless have run on to me; but he dropped at  the first shot. We were about out of anything fit to eat and it did  not require much bravery to take the risk, for almost anyone will take  desperate chances when hungry. We wounded two others, that we expected  to get, but about the time we commenced dressing the one killed, there  came on a regular blizzard that lasted several days. We had hard work  to save the lives of the men getting the meat into camp.        CHAPTER XV.    Our Food Exhausted--Rawhides Cooked and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4657"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 1 (#12)"],[1," yourself into trouble; in Egypt you will be  cursed; in Arabia you will be beaten because you are a heretic; you  will pay the treble of what other travellers do, and if you fall sick  you may die by the roadside.\" After long deliberation about    [p.45]the choice of nations, I became a \"Pathan.[FN#4]\" Born in India  of Afghan parents, who had settled in the country, educated at Rangoon,  and sent out to wander, as men of that race frequently are, from early  youth, I was well guarded against the danger of detection by a  fellow-countryman. To support the character requires a knowledge of  Persian, Hindustani and Arabic, all of which I knew sufficiently well  to pass muster; any trifling inaccuracy was charged upon my long  residence at Rangoon. This was an important step; the first question at  the shop, on the camel, and in the Mosque, is \"What is thy name?\" the  second, \"Whence comest thou?\" This is not generally impertinent, or  intended to be annoying; if, however, you see any evil intention in the  questioner, you may rather roughly ask him, \"What may be his maternal  parent's name?\"-equivalent to enquiring, Anglice, in what church his  mother was married,-and escape your difficulties under cover of the  storm. But this is rarely necessary. I assumed the polite, pliant  manners of an Indian physician, and the dress of a small Effendi (or  gentleman), still, however, representing myself to be a Darwaysh, and  frequenting the places where Darwayshes congregate. \"What business,\"  asked the Haji, \"have those reverend men with politics or statistics,  or any of the information which you are collecting? Call yourself a  religious wanderer if you like, and let those who ask the object of  your peregrinations know that you are under a vow to visit all the holy  places in Al-Islam. Thus you will persuade them that you are a    [p.46]man of rank under a cloud, and you will receive much more  civility than perhaps you deserve,\" concluded my friend with a dry  laugh. The remark proved his sagacity; and after ample experience I had  not to repent having been guided by his advice.    Haji Wali, by profession a merchant at Alexandria, had accompanied  Khudabakhsh, the Indian, to Cairo on law-business. He soon explained  his affairs to me, and as his case brought out certain Oriental  peculiarities in a striking light, with his permission I offer a few of  its details.    My friend was defendant in a suit instituted against him in H.B.M.'s  Consular Court, Cairo, by one Mohammed Shafi'a, a scoundrel of the  first water. This man lived, and lived well, by setting up in business  at places where his name was not known; he enticed the unwary by artful  displays of capital; and, after succeeding in getting credit, he  changed residence, carrying off all he could lay hands upon. But  swindling is a profession of personal danger in uncivilised countries,  where law punishes pauper debtors by a short imprisonment; and where  the cheated prefer to gratify their revenge by the cudgel or the knife.  So Mohammed Shafi'a, after a few narrow escapes, hit upon a prime  expedient. Though known to be a native of Bokhara-he actually signed  himself so in his letters, and his appearance at once bespoke his  origin,-he determined to protect himself by a British passport. Our  officials are sometimes careless enough in distributing these  documents, and by so doing they expose themselves to a certain loss of  reputation at Eastern courts[FN#5]; still Mohammed Shafi'a    [p.47]found some difficulties in effecting his fraud. To recount all  his Reynardisms would weary the reader; suffice it to say that by  proper management of the subalterns in the consulate, he succeeded  without ruining himself. Armed with this new defence, he started boldly  for Jeddah on the Arabian coast. Having entered into partnership with  Haji Wali, whose confidence he had won by prayers, fastings, and  pilgrimages, he openly trafficked in slaves, sending them to Alexandria  for sale, and writing with matchless impudence to his correspondent  that he would dispose of them in person, but for fear of losing his  British passport and protection.    Presently an unlucky adventure embroiled this worthy British subject  with Faraj Yusuf, the principal merchant of Jeddah, and also an English  protege. Fearing so powerful an adversary, Mohammed Shafi'a packed up  his spoils and departed for Egypt. Presently he quarrels with his  former partner, thinking him a soft man, and claims from him a debt of  L165. He supports his pretensions by a document and four witnesses, who  are ready to swear that the receipt in question was \"signed, sealed,  and delivered\" by Haji Wali. The latter adduces his books to show that  accounts have been settled, and can prove that the witnesses in  question are paupers, therefore, not legal; moreover, that each has  received from the plaintiff two dollars, the price of perjury.    [p.48]Now had such a suit been carried into a Turkish court of justice,  it would very sensibly have been settled by the bastinado, for Haji  Wali was a respectable merchant, and Mohammed Shafi'a a notorious  swindler. But the latter was a British subject, which notably  influenced the question. The more to annoy his adversary, he went up to  Cairo, and began proceedings there, hoping by this acute step to  receive part payment of his demand.    Arrived at Cairo, Mohammed Shafi'a applied himself stoutly to the task  of bribing all who could be useful to him, distributing shawls and  piastres with great generosity. He secured the services of an efficient  lawyer; and, determining to enlist heaven itself in his cause, he  passed the Ramazan ostentatiously; he fasted, and he slaughtered sheep  to feed the poor.    Meanwhile Haji Wali, a simple truth-telling man, who could never master  the rudiments of that art which teaches man to blow hot and to blow  cold with the same breath, had been persuaded to visit Cairo by  Khudabakhsh, the wily Indian, who promised to introduce him to  influential persons, and to receive him in his house till he could  provide himself with a lodging at the Wakalah. But Mohammed Shafi'a,  who had once been in partnership with the Indian, and who possibly knew  more than was fit to meet the public ear, found this out; and, partly  by begging, partly by bullying, persuaded Khudabakhsh to transfer the  influential introductions to himself. Then the Hakim[FN#6]  Abdullah-your humble servant-appears upon the scene: he has travelled  in Feringistan, he has seen many men and their cities, he becomes an  intimate and an adviser of the Haji, and he finds out evil passages in  Mohammed Shafi'a's life. Upon which Khudabakhsh ashamed, or rather  afraid of his duplicity, collects his Indian friends. The Hakim  Abdullah draws up a petition    [p.49]addressed to Mr. Walne (H.B.M's Consul) by the Indian merchants  and others resident at Cairo, informing him of Mohammed Shafi'a's  birth, character, and occupation as a vendor of slaves, offering proof  of all assertions, and praying him for the sake of their good name to  take away his passport. And all the Indians affix their seals to this  paper. Then Mohammed Shafi'a threatens to waylay and to beat the Haji.  The Haji, not loud or hectoringly, but with a composed smile, advises  his friends to hold him off.    One would suppose that such a document would have elicited some  inquiry.But Haji Wali was a Persian protege, and proceedings between  the Consulates had commenced before the petition was presented. The  pseudo-British subject, having been acknowledged as a real one, must be  supported. Consuls, like kings, may err, but must not own to error. No  notice was taken of the Indian petition; worse still, no inquiry into  the slave-affair was set on foot[FN#7]; and it was discovered that the  passport having been granted by a Consul-General could not with  official etiquette be resumed by a Consul.[FN#8]    [p.50]Thus matters were destined to proceed as they began. Mohammed  Shafi'a had offered 5,000 piastres to the Persian Consul's interpreter;  this of course was refused, but still somehow or other all the Haji's  affairs seemed to go wrong. His statements were mistranslated, his  accounts were misunderstood, and the suit was allowed to drag on to a  suspicious length. When I left Cairo in July, Haji Wali had been kept  away nearly two months from his business and family, though both  parties-for the plaintiff's purse was rapidly thinning-appeared eager  to settle the difference by arbitration: when I returned from Arabia in  October, matters were almost in statu quo ante, and when I started for  India in January, the proceedings had not closed.    Such is a brief history, but too common, of a case in which the subject  of an Eastern state has to contend against British influence. It is  doubtless a point of honour to defend our proteges from injustice, but  the higher principle should rest upon the base of common honesty. The  worst part of such a case is, that the injured party has no redress.    \"Fiat injustitia, ruat coelum,\"    is the motto of his \"natural protectors,\" who would violate every law  to gratify the false pride of a petty English official. And, saving the  rare exceptions where rank or wealth command consideration, with what  face, to use the native phrase, would a hapless Turk appeal to the  higher powers, our ministers or our Parliament?    After lodging myself in the Wakalah, my first object was to make a  certain stir in the world. In Europe your travelling doctor advertises  the loss of a diamond ring, the gift of a Russian autocrat; or he  monopolises a whole column in a newspaper, feeing perhaps a title for  the use of a signature; the large brass plate, the gold-headed cane,  the rattling chariot, and the summons from the sermon complete the  work. Here, there is no such Royal    [p.51]Road to medical fame. You must begin by sitting with the porter,  who is sure to have blear eyes,"]]]
