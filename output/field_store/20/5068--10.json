Pausing at length above the imposing structure of the Hotel Anglais,  Rob noticed at one of the upper floors an open window, before which was  a small iron balcony.  Alighting upon this he proceeded to enter,  without hesitation, the open window.  He heard a shriek and a cry of  \"AU VOLEUR!\" and caught sight of a woman's figure as she dashed into an  adjoining room, slamming and locking the door behind her.    \"I don't know as I blame her,\" observed Rob, with a smile at the panic  he had created.  \"I s'pose she takes me for a burglar, and thinks I've  climbed up the lightning rod.\"    He soon found the door leading into the hallway and walked down several  flights of stairs until he reached the office of the hotel.    \"How much do you charge a day?\" he inquired, addressing a fat and  pompous-looking gentlemen behind the desk.    The man looked at him in a surprised way, for he had not heard the boy  enter the room.  But he said something in French to a waiter who was  passing, and the latter came to Rob and made a low bow.    \"I speak ze Eengliss ver' fine,\" he said.  \"What desire have you?\"    \"What are your rates by the day?\" asked the boy.    \"Ten francs, M'sieur.\"    \"How many dollars is that?\"    \"Dollar Americaine?\"    \"Yes; United States money.\"    \"Ah, OUI! Eet is ze two dollar, M'sieur.\"    \"All right; I can stay about a day before I go bankrupt.  Give me a  room.\"    \"CERTAINEMENT, M'sieur.  Have you ze luggage?\"    \"No; but I'll pay in advance,\" said Rob, and began counting out his  dimes and nickles and pennies, to the unbounded amazement of the  waiter, who looked as if he had never seen such coins before.    He carried the money to the fat gentleman, who examined the pieces  curiously, and there was a long conference between them before it was  decided to accept them in payment for a room for a day.  But at this  season the hotel was almost empty, and when Rob protested that he had  no other money the fat gentleman put the coins into his cash box with a  resigned sigh and the waiter showed the boy to a little room at the  very top of the building.    Rob washed and brushed the dust from his clothes, after which he sat  down and amused himself by viewing the pictures that constantly formed  upon the polished plate of the Record of Events.          12.  How Rob Saved A Republic      While following the shifting scenes of the fascinating Record Rob noted  an occurrence that caused him to give a low whistle of astonishment and  devote several moments to serious thought.    \"I believe it's about time I interfered with the politics of this  Republic,\" he said, at last, as he closed the lid of the metal box and  restored it to his pocket.  \"If I don't take a hand there probably  won't be a Republic of France very long and, as a good American, I  prefer a republic to a monarchy.\"    Then he walked down-stairs and found his English-speaking waiter.    \"Where's President Loubet?\" he asked.    \"Ze President!  Ah, he is wiz his mansion.  To be at his residence,  M'sieur.\"    \"Where is his residence?\"    The waiter began a series of voluble and explicit directions which so  confused the boy that he exclaimed:    \"Oh, much obliged!\" and walked away in disgust.    Gaining the street he approached a gendarme and repeated his question,  with no better result than before, for the fellow waved his arms wildly  in all directions and roared a volley of incomprehensible French  phrases that conveyed no meaning whatever.    \"If ever I travel in foreign countries again,\" said Rob, \"I'll learn  their lingo in advance.  Why doesn't the Demon get up a conversation  machine that will speak all languages?\"    By dint of much inquiry, however, and after walking several miles  following ambiguous directions, he managed to reach the residence of  President Loubet.  But there he was politely informed that the  President was busily engaged in his garden, and would see no one.    \"That's all right,\" said the boy, calmly.  \"If he's in the garden I'll  have no trouble finding him.\"    Then, to the amazement of the Frenchmen, Rob shot into the air fifty  feet or so, from which elevation he overlooked a pretty garden in the  rear of the President's mansion.  The place was protected from ordinary  intrusion by high walls, but Rob descended within the enclosure and  walked up to a man who was writing at a small table placed under the  spreading branches of a large tree.    \"Is this President Loubet?\" he inquired, with a bow.    The gentleman looked up.    \"My servants were instructed to allow no one to disturb me,\" he said,  speaking in excellent English.    \"It isn't their fault; I flew over the wall,\" returned Rob.  \"The fact  is,\" he added, hastily, as he noted the President's frown, \"I have come  to save the Republic; and I haven't much time to waste over a bundle of  Frenchmen, either.\"    The President seemed surprised.    \"Your name!\" he demanded, sharply.    \"Robert Billings Joslyn, United States of America!\"    \"Your business, Monsieur Joslyn!\"    Rob drew the Record from his pocket and placed it upon the table.    \"This, sir,\" said he, \"is an electrical device that records all  important events.  I wish to call your attention to a scene enacted in  Paris last evening which may have an effect upon the future history of  your country.\"    He opened the lid, placed the Record so that the President could see  clearly, and then watched the changing expressions upon the great man's  face; first indifference, then interest, the next moment eagerness and  amazement.    \"MON DIEU!\" he gasped; \"the Orleanists!\"    Rob nodded.    \"Yes; they've worked up a rather pretty plot, haven't they?\"    The President did not reply.  He was anxiously watching the Record and  scribbling notes on a paper beside him.  His face was pale and his lips  tightly compressed.    Finally he leaned back in his chair and asked:    \"Can you reproduce this scene again?\"    \"Certainly, sir,\" answered the boy; \"as often as you like.\"    \"Will you remain here while I send for my minister of police?  It will  require but a short time.\"    \"Call him up, then.  I'm in something of a hurry myself, but now I've  mixed up with this thing I'll see it through.\"    The President touched a bell and gave an order to his servant.  Then he  turned to Rob and said, wonderingly:    \"You are a boy!\"    \"That's true, Mr. President,\" was the answer; \"but an American boy, you  must remember.  That makes a big difference, I assure you.\"    The President bowed gravely.    \"This is your invention?\" he asked.    \"No; I'm hardly equal to that.  But the inventor has made me a present  of the Record, and it's the only one in the world.\"    \"It is a marvel,\" remarked the President, thoughtfully.  \"More!  It is  a real miracle.  We are living in an age of wonders, my young friend.\"    \"No one knows that better than myself, sir,\" replied Rob.  \"But, tell  me, can you trust your chief of police?\"    \"I think so,\" said the President, slowly; \"yet since your invention has  shown me that many men I have considered honest are criminally  implicated in this royalist plot, I hardly know whom to depend upon.\"    \"Then please wear these spectacles during your interview with the  minister of police,\" said the boy.  \"You must say nothing, while he is  with us, about certain marks that will appear upon his forehead; but  when he has gone I will explain those marks so you will understand  them.\"    The President covered his eyes with the spectacles.    \"Why,\" he exclaimed, \"I see upon your own brow the letters--\"    \"Stop, sir!\" interrupted Rob, with a blush; \"I don't care to know what  the letters are, if it's just the same to you.\"    The President seemed puzzled by this speech, but fortunately the  minister of police arrived just then and, under Rob's guidance, the  pictured record of the Orleanist plot was reproduced before the  startled eyes of the official.    \"And now,\" said the boy, \"let us see if any of this foolishness is  going on just at present.\"    He turned to the opposite side of the Record and allowed the President  and his minister of police to witness the quick succession of events  even as they occurred.    Suddenly the minister cried, \"Ha!\" and, pointing to the figure of a man  disembarking from an English boat at Calais, he said, excitedly:    \"That, your Excellency, is the Duke of Orleans, in disguise!  I must  leave you for a time, that I may issue some necessary orders to my men;  but this evening I shall call to confer with you regarding the best  mode of suppressing this terrible plot.\"    When the official had departed, the President removed the spectacles  from his eyes and handed them to Rob.    \"What did you see?\" asked the boy.    \"The letters 'G' and 'W'.\"    \"Then you may trust him fully,\" declared Rob, and explained the  construction of the Character Marker to the interested and amazed  statesman.    \"And now I must go,\" he continued, \"for my stay in your city will be a  short one and I want to see all I can.\"    The President scrawled something on a sheet of paper and signed his  name to it, afterward presenting it, with a courteous bow, to his  visitor.    \"This will enable you to go wherever you please, while in Paris,\" he  said.  \"I regret my inability to reward you properly for the great  service you have rendered my country; but you have my sincerest  gratitude, and may command me in any way.\"    \"Oh, that's all right,\" answered Rob.  \"I thought it was my duty to  warn you, and if you look sharp you'll be able to break up this  conspiracy.  But I don't want any reward.  Good day, sir.\"    He turned the indicator of his traveling machine and immediately rose  into the air, followed by a startled exclamation from the President of  France.    Moving leisurely over the city, he selected a deserted thoroughfare to  alight in, from whence he wandered unobserved into the beautiful  boulevards.

Gioberti died in Paris October 16, 1852, just as the new era in Italian  affairs which he had predicted in his last book was actually commencing  with the advent of Cavour as Prime Minister of Piedmont.    When we review Gioberti's work we find that it was chiefly important as  a stimulus to Italian patriotic thought, as a threshing out of theories  and principles in preparation for a true realization of national needs  and hopes. That the philosophy, in so far as it was political, of his  \"Primato\" failed to prove true when attempted in practice, and must  inevitably so have failed as we see now, did not affect his influence  over his own generation. That influence was one which contrasted  sharply with Mazzini's, Gioberti always preaching orderly organization,  Mazzini daring attempts of many sorts, both alike in the ardor of their  enthusiasm.    While Mazzini appealed to the mass, Gioberti appealed to the scholars,  the clergy, the thinking classes, and his appeal was patriotic as well  as intellectual. In his \"Primato\" he stirs his countrymen to consider  their country's place among the nations. \"While to the north,\" he says,  \"there is a people numbering only twenty-four millions who rule the  sea, make Europe tremble, own India, vanquish China and occupy the best  parts of Asia, Africa, America and Oceania, what great things have we  Italians done? What are our manual and intellectual exploits? Where  are our fleets and our colonies? What rank do our legates hold; what  force do they wield; what wise or authoritative influence do they exert  in foreign courts? What weight attaches to the Italian name in the  balance of European power? Foreigners, indeed, know and still visit our  country, but only for the purpose of enjoying the changeless beauty of  our skies and of looking upon the ruins of our past. But what profits  it to speak of glory, riches, and power? Can Italy say she has a place  in the world? Can she boast of a life of her own and of a political  autonomy, when she is awed by the first insolent and ambitious upstart  who tramples her under foot and galls her with his yoke? Who is there  who shudders not when he reflects that, disunited as we are, we must be  the prey of any assailant whatever, and that we owe even that wretched  fraction of independence which charters and protocols still allow us to  the compassion of our neighbors?\" Then he concludes, \"Although all this  has come upon us through our own fault; nevertheless, by the exercise  of a little strength of will and determination, without upheavals or  revolutions and without perpetrating injustice, we can still be one of  the first races in the world.\"    With consummate skill he arranged a national program in which the Pope,  the Princes, the people, even Austria, should have a part, and it was  scarcely to be wondered that inasmuch as each interest was flattered  each thought well of the program. The clergy were no less delighted with  the eloquence of one of their own number than with his teaching that  religion and patriotism should go hand in hand, those high in power felt  that their power would be left them under his theory, and the people  were stirred by his eloquence and dreams of what Italy should become. As  a result there arose what was known as the \"Neo-Guelph\" party, which,  harking back to the Middle Ages, sought to place the Pope at the head of  the national movement. And, by a beautiful coincidence of history, just  at that moment a new Pontiff, one of that clergy which had so greatly  admired Gioberti's writings, ascended St. Peter's throne. In these facts  you have the cause of Gioberti's commanding position in the early years  of the great struggle.    Unfortunately Gioberti's theories were dreams, not even so practical  as the aspirations of Mazzini's \"Young Italy.\" He had failed utterly  to grasp the need of absolute administrative concentration and did not  accurately estimate the jealousies and prides of the petty Princes and  the churchmen. He believed that those forces which had so long destroyed  Italian unity could be made to unite to restore it, he believed that the  Roman Church could exercise a wise temporal authority. He looked back to  the Middle Ages, and spoke with some of Savonarola's words. He appealed  to his people's ancient love of art and letters, to the glories of the  mediaeval cities, to the world-wide authority of Rome and St. Peter's.  The appeal stirred the imagination of the intellectual classes, and  drew the attention of other countries to the fallen estate of Italy.  Beyond that it could not be effective; the needs of State and Church, of  Princes and people, had grown too unalterably opposed. Mazzini was far  nearer right, a truer teacher, a surer guide.    The time came when Gioberti recognized that Italy's salvation lay in  the strong hand, and this he acknowledged in his last book. It is the  truest of all his political philosophies because he had then understood  that the future belonged to men of such abilities as were possessed by  Cavour and Victor Emmanuel, and to a well-knit nation rather than to a  confraternity of ill-assorted states.    Yet for all its fallacies Gioberti's \"Primato\" woke intellectual Italy  from a sleep which had lasted centuries, and made it consider the  problem of its regeneration.          [Illustration: MANIN]          MANIN, THE \"FATHER OF VENICE\"      The story of Venetian glory seemed closed with the last years of the  Eighteenth Century. The proud Queen of the Adriatic had seen her jewels  stolen one by one, and had finally become the toy of wanton powers.  Venice was no longer self-reliant, no longer coldly virtuous, her  grandeur had sunk into a memory, her civic honor been bedimmed by gross  corruption. \"Venice was,\" said the world, and France, parceling out the  conquests of the young Napoleon, handed Venetia and the City of the  Doges to Austria. There was no opportunity for self-defense, Napoleon  had removed all military stores and confiscated the Venetian fleet, the  citizens buried the lion-banners of Saint Mark beneath their churches,  and silently watched the Austrians enter. The last Doge, aged and bent  with years, fell senseless as he opened his lips to swear allegiance to  the House of Hapsburg. Europe considered the fate of Venice sealed.    Napoleon came and went, and men as well as maps experienced gigantic  changes, but still Venice slept. She had become a part of the Austrian  Empire, a new generation grew up who had never known Venice free, who  only learned their city's history by stealth. Among this new generation  was Daniel Manin, son of a Jew who had embraced Christianity and who  had adopted the surname of his noble patron the last Doge, according to  Venetian custom. So it happened that the last free ruler of Venice and  the man who was to raise her from sleep bore the same name. There was  also transmitted to the boy the ancient hate of Austria.    Born in 1804 Daniel Manin early showed a strong love of learning, which  was eagerly tended by his father, a lawyer of some note. The father  taught his son the history of his city, he brought him up to see the  unjust practices of Napoleon and of Austria, he kindled in him the  passion for liberty. The boy studied jurisprudence and the growth of  Venetian dialects, at fifteen he translated the apocryphal book of  Enoch from the Hebrew, at seventeen he became a Doctor of Laws, and  had translated Pothier's great French work on Roman law before he was  twenty-one. The year he came of age he married, and a little later  settled in the small town of Maestra, which lies at the entrance to the  Lagoons, and started to practise his profession of advocate, which under  Austrian rule allowed him only to act in civil cases, and then merely  in a consulting capacity and never as a pleader in the courts.    Even in early youth his health was poor; although his mind was unusually  active and well-balanced he was subject to frequent visitations of  great physical weariness which at times made it impossible for him to  accomplish anything. Later in life he wrote, \"The act of living, in a  healthy person, considered in itself, ought to be a pleasure; but to me  from my very childhood, it has always been a painful effort. I always  feel weary.\" He was frequently morbid just at the time when his growing  family required all his energy for support.    In person the young lawyer was rather striking, not tall, but spare,  with unusually animated blue eyes, thick chestnut hair, and features  full of changing expression, quick to show the temper of his mind. For  all his underlying weariness and continued depression he often appeared  gay and cheerful on the surface; it was his nature to be unselfish, and  to turn a brave face towards the world.    Working as an advocate Manin gave up his spare hours to studying  Venetian _patois_ and to planning how in time his city might loosen  the bonds of Austrian tyranny. As early as 1830, when he was only  twenty-six, he joined with three close friends in a plot to seize the  Venetian arsenal, and drew up a proclamation intended to excite the  citizens. The movement throughout northern Italy on which the friends  relied failed to materialize, and the plan fell through. Fortunately the  authors of the proclamation were not discovered, and Manin was permitted  to continue his profession. He did not believe in secret societies, and  would not join them; he devoted himself to studying Austria's colonial  weaknesses.    The first step which brought him seriously to the notice of the  government was his work on behalf of the Italian bankers who were  associated with some Germans in building a railway between Venice and  Milan. There had been a disagreement as to the route of the railway, and  the Austrian viceroy had sided with the Germans. Manin was engaged to  represent the Italian bankers, and conducted "]]]
