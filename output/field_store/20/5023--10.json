We proposed to pitch my tent in a ruined enclosure, but the headman  was unwilling, and when it was suggested that it should be placed  between the shop and the caravanserai, he said that before sunset all  the predatory Arabs for ten miles round would hear that \"rich  foreigners were travelling,\" and would fall upon and plunder us, so we  must pitch, if at all, in the filthy and crowded court of the  caravanserai. The _balakhana_, or upper room, was too insecure for me,  and had no privacy, as the fodder was kept in it, and there was no  method of closing the doors, which let in the bitterly cold wind.    We arrived at 3 P.M., and long before sunset a number of caravans came  in, and the courtyard was full of horses, mules, and asses. When they  halted the loads were taken off and stacked in the arched recesses;  next, the great padded pack-saddles, which cover nearly the whole  back, were removed, revealing in most cases deep sores and ulcers.  Then the animals were groomed with box curry-combs, with \"clatters\"  like the noise of a bird-scarer inside them. Fifty curry-combs going  at once is like the din of the cicada. Then the beasts were driven in  batches to the reedy pool, and came flying back helter-skelter through  the archway, some fighting, others playing, many rolling. One of them  nearly pulled my tent over by rolling among the tent ropes. It had  been pitched on damp and filthy ground in a corner of the yard, among  mules, horses, asses, dogs, and the roughest of rough men, but even  there the damp inside looked like home.    After this brief hilarity, the pack-saddles, which serve as blankets,  were put on, the camels were made to lie down in rows, most of the  mules and horses were tethered in the great stable, where they  neighed, stamped, and jangled their bells all night, and others were  picketed in the yard among the goats and donkeys and the big dogs,  which wandered about yelping. Later, the small remaining space was  filled up with sheep. It was just possible to move, but no more, and  sheep and goats were even packed under the _flys_ of my tent. The  muleteers and travellers spread their bedding in the recesses, lighted  their fires of animal fuel, and cooked their food.    At sunset the view from the roof was almost beautiful. Far away, in  all directions, stretched the level desert purpling in the purple  light. Very faintly, on the far horizon to the north-east, mountain  ranges were painted in amethyst on an orange sky. Horsemen in  companies galloped to tents which were not in sight, strings of camels  cast their long shadows on the purple sand, and flocks of big brown  sheep, led by armed shepherds, converged on the reedy pool in long  brown lines. The evening air was keen, nearly frosty.    The prospects for the night were not encouraging, and on descending  the filthy stair on which goats had taken up their quarters, I found  the malodorous, crowded courtyard so blocked, that shepherds, with  much pushing, shouting, and barking of big dogs, with difficulty made  a way for me to pass through the packed mass of sheep and goats into  the cold, damp tent, which was pitched on damp manure, two or three  feet deep, into which heavy feet had trampled the carpet. The uproar  of _katirgis_ and travellers went on for another two hours, and was  exchanged later for sounds of jangling bells, yelping and quarrelling  dogs, braying asses, bleating sheep, and coarsely-snoring men.    At 9 P.M. the heavy gates, clamped with iron, were closed and barred,  and some belated travellers, eager to get in from the perils of the  outside, thundered at them long and persistently, but \"the door was  shut,\" and they encountered a hoarse refusal. The _seraidar_ said that  400 horses and mules, besides camels and asses, 2000 sheep, and over  70 men were lodged in the caravanserai that night.    The servants were in a recess near, and Hadji professed that he  watched all night, and said that he fired at a man who tried to rob my  tent after the light went out, but I slept too soundly to be  disturbed, till the caravans and flocks left at daybreak, after a  preliminary uproar of two hours. It was bitterly cold, and my tent and  its contents were soaked with the heavy dew, nearly doubling their  weight.    I started at 9 A.M., before the hoar-frost had melted, and rode with  the _zaptieh_ over flat, stoneless, alluvial soil, with some  irrigation and the remains of some fine canals. There are villages to  be seen in the distance, but though the soil is rich enough to support  a very large population, there are no habitations near the road except  a few temporary reed huts, beside two large caravanserais. There was  little of an interesting kind except the perpetual contrast between  things as they are and things as they were and might be. Some large  graveyards, with brick graves, a crumbling _imamzada_, a pointed arch  of brick over the Nahrud canal, a few ass caravans, with a live fowl  tied by one leg on the back of each ass, and struggling painfully to  keep its uneasy seat, some cultivation and much waste, and then we  reached the walled village of Sheraban, once a town, but now only  possessing 300 houses.    Passing as usual among ruinous dwellings and between black walls with  doors here and there, by alleys foul with heaps of refuse, and  dangerous from slimy pitfalls, in the very foulest part we turned into  the caravanserai, its great courtyard reeking with filth and puddles,  among which are the contaminated wells from which we are supposed to  drink. The experience of the night before was not repeated. There were  fairly good rooms, mine looking into a palm garden, through a wooden  grating, cold truly, but pleasant. I fear we may never have such  \"luxury\" again. I remarked to my fellow-traveller that our early  arrival had fortunately given us the \"choice of rooms,\" and he  replied, \"choice of pig-styes,--choice of dens!\" but my experience at  Wiyjahea has deprived me of the last remnants of fastidiousness!    I walked through the ruinous, wretched town, and its poor bazar, where  the very fine _physique_ of the men was in marked contrast with their  wretched surroundings, and gives one the impression that under honest  officials they might be a fine people. They are not genial to  strangers, however. There was some bad language used in the bazar, and  on the roads they pass one in silence at the best, so unlike the  Tibetans with their friendly _Tzu_. At Sheraban one of the muleteers  forced his way into my room, and roughly turned over my saddle and  baggage, accusing me of having taken his blanket! Hadji is useless  under such circumstances. He blusters and fingers his revolver, but  carries no weight. Indeed his defects are more apparent every day. I  often have to speak to him two or three times before I can rouse him  from his opium dream, and there is a growing inclination to shirk his  very light work when he can shift it upon somebody else. I hope that  he is well-meaning, as that would cover a multitude of faults, but he  is very rough and ignorant, and is either unable or unwilling to learn  anything, even how to put up my trestle bed!    Open rooms have sundry disadvantages. In the night a cat fell from  the roof upon my bed, and was soon joined by more, and they knocked  over the lamp and milk bottle, and in the darkness had a noisy quarrel  over the milk.    The march of eighteen miles here was made in six hours, at a good  caravan pace. The baggage animals were sent off in advance, and the  _zaptieh_ led a mule loaded with chairs, blankets, and occupations. I  ride with the _zaptieh_ in front of me till I get near the  halting-place, when M---- and his orderly overtake me, as it might be  disagreeable for a European woman to enter a town alone.    The route lies over treeless levels of the same brown alluvial soil,  till it is lifted on a gentle gravelly slope to a series of low  crumbling mounds of red and gray sandstone, mixed up with soft  conglomerate rocks of jasper and porphyry pebbles. These ranges of  mounds, known as the Hamrin Hills, run parallel to the great Kurdistan  ranges, from a point considerably below Baghdad, nearly to Mosul and  the river Zab. They mark the termination in this direction of the vast  alluvial plains of the Tigris and Euphrates, and are the first step to  the uplifted Iranian plateau.    Arid and intricate ravines, dignified by the name of passes, furrow  these hills, and bear an evil reputation, as Arab robbers lie in wait,  \"making it very unsafe for small caravans.\" A wild, desolate,  ill-omened-looking region it is. When we were fairly within the pass,  the _zaptieh_ stopped, and with much gesticulation and many  repetitions of the word _effendi_, made me understand that it was  unsafe to proceed without a larger party. We were unmolested, but it  is a discredit to the administration of the province that an organised  system of pillage should be allowed to exist year after year on one of  the most frequented caravan routes in Turkey. There were several  companies of armed horsemen among the ranges, and some camels  browsing, but we met no caravans.    From the top of the descent there was a striking view over a great  brown alluvial plain, watered by the Beladruz and the Diyalah, with  serrated hills of no great height, but snow-covered; on its east side  a silent, strange, weird view, without interest or beauty as seen  under a sullen sky. There are no villages on this march, but ancient  canals run in all directions, and fragments of buildings, as well as  of brick and pottery, scattered over the unploughed surface, are  supposed by many to mark the situation of Dastagird, the residence of  Khosroe Parviz in the seventh century. I have no books of reference  with me, and can seldom write except of such things as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38828"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 2 (of 2) (#12)"],[1,"=i]m!_\" The Sahib, who came to the rescue, and urged them in  Persian to depart, was quite powerless. In the midst of the confusion  the Khan's wives and daughter came to visit me, but I could only show  them the crowd and walk, followed by it, in the opposite direction  from the tent, till I met the Agha, whose presence restored order.  That night nearly all Hadji's _juls_ or mule blankets and a donkey  were stolen.    The Zalakis are a large and powerful tribe, predatory by habit and  tradition. Aslam Khan himself directed certain thefts from which we  suffered, and quoted a passage from the Koran not only to extenuate  but to warrant depredations on the goods of \"infidels.\"    Sunday was spent in the hubbub of a crowd. I was suffering somewhat  from a fall, and yet more from the fatigues of Kalahoma, and longed  for rest, but the temperature of the tent when closed was 106 deg., and  when open the people crowded at the entrance, ostensibly for medicine,  but many from a pardonable and scarcely disguised curiosity to see the  \"Feringhi _Hak[=i]m_,\" and hear her speak.    In the afternoon, with Mirza and Karim as a guard, I went somewhat  reluctantly to the Khan's camp to return the abortive visit of the  ladies. This camp consists of a number of black tents arranged in a  circle, the Khan's tents only distinguishable from the rest by their  larger size. Mares, dogs, sheep, goats, and fireholes were in the  centre, and some good-looking horses were tethered outside.    The Khan's mother, a fine, buxom, but coarse-looking woman, met me,  and took me to an open tent, fully forty feet long, the back of which  was banked up by handsome saddle-bags. Bolsters and rugs were laid in  the middle, on which the four legitimate wives and several inferior  ones, with a quantity of babies and children crawling about them, were  seated. Among them was a very handsome Jewish-looking girl of  eighteen, the Khan's daughter, pleasing in expression and graceful in  manner. She is married to a son of Taimur Khan, but he does not care  for her, and has practically discarded her, which adds insult to the  \"blood feud\" previously existing.    After I entered the tent the whole camp population, male and female,  crowded in, pressing upon us with clamour indescribable. The Khan's  mother slapped the wives if they attempted to speak and conducted  herself like a ruling virago, occasionally shrieking at the crowd,  while a _tufangchi_ with a heavy stick belaboured all within his  reach, and those not belaboured yelled with laughter.    The senior lady beckoned Mirza to lean towards her, and told him in a  whisper that her handsome granddaughter is hated and despised by her  husband, and has been sent back with a baby a year old, he having  taken another wife, and that she wanted me to give her a \"love  philtre\" that would answer the double purpose of giving her back his  love and making her rival hateful in his eyes. During this whispered  conference as many as could reach leant close to the speakers, like  the \"savages\" that they are. I replied that I knew of no such  philtres, that if the girl's beauty and sweetness could not retain her  husband's love there was no remedy. She said she knew I had them, and  that I kept them, as well as potions for making favourite wives ugly  and odious to their husbands, in a leather box with a gold key! Then  many headaches and sore eyes were brought, and a _samovar_ and tea,  and I distributed presents in a Babel in which anything but the most  staccato style of conversation was impossible. When I left the crowd  surged after me, and a sharp stone was thrown, which cut through my  cloak.    Later, Aslam Khan, his brothers, and the usual train of retainers  called. He is a very fine-looking man, six feet high, with a most  sinister expression, and a look at times which inspired me with the  deepest distrust of him. His robber tribe numbers 3500 souls, and he  says that he can bring 540 armed horsemen into the field. He too asked  for medicine for headache. Not only is there a blood feud between him  and Khaja Taimur, but between him and Mirab Khan, through whose valley  we must pass. In the evening the Khan's mother returned with several  women, bent on getting the \"love philtre.\" At night Hadji, who was  watching, said that men were prowling round the tents at all hours,  and a few things were taken.    On Monday morning early all was ready, for the three caravans from  that day were to march together, and I was sitting on my horse talking  with the Sahib, waiting for the Agha to return from the Khan's camp,  when he rushed down the slope exclaiming, \"There's mischief!\" and I  crossed the stream and watched it. About twenty men with loaded sticks  had surrounded Mujid, and were beating him and finally got him down.  I leapt back to my own camp, where Hassan and Karim were taking a  parting smoke, and ordered them to the rescue. The soldier rushed into  the _melee_, armed with only a cane, which was broken at once, and the  Bakhtiaris got him by his thick hair, and all but forced him down; but  he fought like a bulldog, and so did Hassan, who was unarmed and got  two bad cuts. Dashed too into the fray Hadji Hussein, who fought like  a bull, followed by his muleteers and by Abbas Ali, who, being early  knocked down, hung on to a man's arm with his teeth. The Sahib, who  was endeavouring to make peace, was untouched, possibly because of his  lineage and faith, and he yelled to Mirza (who in a fight is of no  account) to run for the Agha, whose presence is worth fifty men.    Meanwhile a number of Zalakis, armed, two with guns and the rest with  loaded sticks, crowded round me, using menacing gestures and calling  me a _Kafir_, on which I took my revolver out of the holster, and very  slowly examined the chambers, though I knew well that all were loaded.  This had an excellent effect. They fell back, and were just dispersing  when over the crest of the hill cantered Aziz Khan, followed by the  Agha, who, galloping down the slope, fired a revolver twice over the  head of a man who was running away, who, having stolen a sheep, and  being caught in the act by Mujid, had begun the fray. Aslam Khan  followed, and, the men say, gave the order to fire, but recalled it on  finding that one of his tribesmen had been the aggressor. I thought he  took the matter very coolly, and he almost immediately told Mirza to  ask me for a penknife!    After this we started, the orders being for the caravans to keep well  together, and if we were absolutely attacked to \"fire.\" After  ascending a spur of the Kala Kuh we left the track for an Ilyat camp  on a steep hill among oaks and pears, where I had promised to see a  young creature very ill of fever.    Among the trees was a small booth of four poles, roofed with celery  stalks, but without sides or ends, and in this, on a sheepskin, was a  heap out of which protruded two white wasted arms. I uncovered the  back of a head which turned slowly, and revealed, in a setting of  masses of heavy shining hair, the white face of a young girl, with  large brilliant eyes and very beautiful teeth. Her pulse was  fluttering feebly, and I told the crowd that death was very near, for  fear they should think I had poisoned her with the few drops of  stimulant that she was able to swallow. Even here the death penalty  sometimes follows the joy of maternity. She died in the evening, and  now nothing remains of the camp but a heap of ashes, for these people  always at once leave the camping-ground where a death has occurred.    Meanwhile the Agha was making friends with the people, and giving  _krans_ to the children, as is his habit. Scarcely had we left when he  found that he had been robbed of a fine pair of binocular glasses,  almost a necessity under the circumstances. English rifles,  binoculars, and watches are all coveted by the Bakhtiaris. Aziz Khan  became very grave, and full of dismal prophecies regarding the  remainder of the journey.    After this divergence the scenery was magnificent. The Kala Kuh range  is certainly finer than the Zard Kuh. It is more broken up into peaks  of definite outline, and is more deeply cut by gorges, many of them  the beds of torrents, densely wooded. In fact it is less of a _range_  and more of a _group_. The route lay among huge steep mountains of  naked rock, cut up by narrow, deep, and gigantic clefts, from whose  depths rise spires of rock and stupendous, almost perpendicular  cliffs. Green torrents flecked with foam boom through the shadows, or  flash in the sunlight, margined wherever it is possible by walnuts,  oaks, lilacs, roses, the _Lastrea dilatata_, and an entanglement of  greenery revelling in spray.    A steep zigzag descent through oak and pear trees brought us to the  vigorous torrent Ab-i-Sefid (white water), one of many of the same  name, crossed by a natural bridge of shelving rock, slippery from much  use. One of the Arabs so nearly fell on this that I dismounted, and  just as I did so Abbas Ali's mule fell on his side, and _Screw_  following did the same, breaking several things in the holster.    After crossing a deep ravine Abbas Ali sprang back down the steep to  it, and the Sahib, who was behind, also ran down with three men to  what was evidently a disaster. Mirza's mule had fallen over twenty  feet, rolling over him three times with its load, hurting his knee  badly. The Sahib said he never saw so narrow an escape from a broken  neck. The loss of a bottle containing a quart of milk was the chief  damage. A little farther up three men were tugging _Hak[=i]m_ up to  the track by the tail. It was a very steep ascent by stony broken  zigzags and ledges to the fairly level top of a spur of the Kala Kuh  range, with a high battlemented hill behind, at the back of which  dwell robber hordes, and many Seyyids, who pay no tribute, and are  generally feared.    At this open, breezy height of 9200 feet the camps have been"]]]
