He massed Ricketts's and Griffin's  batteries, and made their practice grand. So well executed was it that the  Confederate left was again in peril, and, seeing reinforcements  approaching towards their rear, General Johnston sent orders to the  brigades at the lower fords revoking authority given them to advance  against Centreville, and ordering their return to the south side, and the  brigade at Union Mills was ordered to reinforce the Confederate left. The  brigade at Blackburn's Ford received the recall order in ample time, but  that at McLean's,--Jones's,--being a little farther away, became partially  engaged before the recall reached it. The brigades resumed their former  position, however, without serious trouble.    With this order came a message to me, saying that the Federals were  pressing severely on our left, and to the limit of its tension, that  reinforcements were in sight, approaching their right, which might prove  too heavy for our brave men, and force us back, for which emergency our  brigades should be held ready to cover retreat. These anxious moments were  soon relieved by the approach of General Kirby Smith's command, that had  been mistaken as reinforcements for the enemy. General Smith was wounded,  but was succeeded in command by the gallant Elzey, who by a well-timed  attack approached the rear of the massed batteries. At the same time a  brave charge on the part of Beauregard, in co-operation with this  fortunate attack of Smith and Elzey, captured the greater part of the  batteries and turned some of the guns upon the brave men who had handled  them so well.    McDowell made a gallant effort to recover his lost power, riding with his  troops and urging them to brave efforts, but our convex line, that he was  just now pressing back upon itself, was changed. Though attenuated, it had  become concave by reinforcement, and in elliptical curve was delivering a  concentrated fire upon its adversary. Before the loss of his artillery he  was the Samson of the field; now he was not only shorn of his power, but  some of his mighty strength was transferred to his adversary, leaving him  in desperate plight and exposed to blows increasing in force and  effectiveness. Although his renewed efforts were brave, his men seemed to  have given confidence over to despair. Still a show of battle was made  until General Johnston directed the brigades of Holmes and Early to good  positions for attack, when fight was abandoned and flight ensued.    The regulars under Sykes maintained order, and with the regular cavalry  covered the confused retreat. The Confederates in the field and  approaching at the moment were ordered in pursuit. At the same time  another order was sent the brigades at the lower fords, explaining that  the reinforcements, supposed to be Federals, proved to be Confederates,  and that the former were not only forced back, but were then in full  retreat, directing our brigades to cross again and strike the retreating  line on the turnpike. All of D. R. Jones's brigade that had crossed at  McLean's Ford under the former order had not yet returned to its position  under the order to that effect, and Ewell had gone from Union Mills Ford  to the battle on the extreme left, so that neither of them came in  position ready to take part in the pursuit. Those at Mitchell's and  Blackburn's Fords advanced, the former, under General Bonham, with orders  to strike at Cub Run, the latter at Centreville. Finding some obstruction  to his march, General Bonham kept the Centreville road, and joined the  brigade from Blackburn's, taking the lead as the ranking officer.    Through the abandoned camps of the Federals we found their pots and  kettles over the fire, with food cooking; quarters of beef hanging on the  trees, and wagons by the roadside loaded, some with bread and general  provisions, others with ammunition. When within artillery range of the  retreating column passing through Centreville, the infantry was deployed  on the sides of the road, under cover of the forest, so as to give room  for the batteries ordered into action in the open, Bonham's brigade on the  left, the other on the right.    As the guns were about to open, there came a message that the enemy,  instead of being in precipitate retreat, was marching around to attack the  Confederate right. With this report came orders, or reports of orders, for  the brigades to return to their positions behind the Run. I denounced the  report as absurd, claimed to know a retreat, such as was before me, and  ordered that the batteries open fire, when Major Whiting, of General  Johnston's staff, rising in his stirrups, said,--    \"In the name of General Johnston, I order that the batteries shall not  open.\"    I inquired, \"Did General Johnston send you to communicate that order?\"    Whiting replied, \"No; but I take the responsibility to give it.\"    I claimed the privilege of responsibility under the circumstances, and  when in the act of renewing the order to fire, General Bonham rode to my  side and asked that the batteries should not open. As the ranking officer  present, this settled the question. By that time, too, it was near night.  Colonel G. W. Lay, of Johnston's staff, supported my views,  notwithstanding the protest of Major Whiting.    Soon there came an order for the brigades to withdraw and return to their  positions behind the Run. General Bonham marched his brigade back, but,  thinking that there was a mistake somewhere, I remained in position until  the order was renewed, about ten o'clock. My brigade crossed and recrossed  the Run six times during the day and night.    It was afterwards found that some excitable person, seeing Jones's  brigade recrossing the Run, from its advance, under previous orders, took  them for Federal troops crossing at McLean's Ford, and, rushing to  head-quarters at the Junction, reported that the Federals were crossing  below and preparing for attack against our right. And upon this report one  of the staff-officers sent orders, in the names of the Confederate chiefs,  revoking the orders for pursuit.    From the effective service of the two guns of Latham's battery, _at short  range_, against the odds brought against them, the inference seems fair  that the Imboden battery, had it moved under Bee's orders, could have so  strengthened the position on the Matthews plateau as to hold it and give  time for them to retire and meet General Jackson on the Henry plateau.  Glorious Victory spread her generous wings alike over heroes and  delinquents.    The losses of the Confederates in all arms were 1982. Federal losses in  all arms, 3333[6] officers and soldiers, twenty-five cannon.[7]    On the 22d the cavalry troop of Captain Whitehead was sent forward with  Colonel Terry, volunteer aide, on a ride of observation. They picked up a  number of prisoners, and Colonel Terry cut the lanyards of the Federal  flag over the court-house at Fairfax by a shot from his six-shooter, and  sent the bunting to head-quarters.    The plan of the Union campaign was that their army in the Valley of the  Shenandoah, under General Patterson, should stand so surely against the  Confederates in that field, under General Johnston, as to prevent the  withdrawal of the latter through the Blue Ridge, which goes to show that  the concentration was considered, and thought possible, and that McDowell  was, therefore, under some pressure to act in time to gain his battle  before Johnston could have time for his swoop from the mountains. At  Centreville on the 18th, McDowell was within five miles of his immediate  objective,--Manassas Junction,--by the route of Tyler's reconnoissance.  The Sudley Ford route involved a march of twenty miles and drew him nearer  the reach of Johnston's forces. So, if Tyler's reconnoissance proved the  route by Blackburn's Ford practicable, it was imperative on McDowell to  adopt it. If it was proved impracticable, the route by Sudley's Ford was  necessary and justified the delay. But it has been claimed that the Union  commander did not intend to have the reconnoissance, and that he could  have made his move a success by that route if he had adopted it; which, if  true, would put him in a more awkward position than his defeat. He was  right in his conclusion that the Confederates were prepared for him on  that route, but it would have been a grave error to leave the shorter,  more direct line for the circuitous route without first so testing the  former as to know if it were practicable, knowing as he did that the  Confederate left was in the air, because of leaven looked for from over  the Blue Ridge. After the trial of General Tyler on the 18th, and finding  the route closed against him, he should have given credit to the division  commander and his troops for their courageous work, but instead he  disparaged their efforts and put them under criticism. The experiment and  subsequent events go to show that the route was not practicable except for  seasoned troops.    McDowell's first mistake was his display, and march for a grand military  picnic. The leading proverb impressed upon the minds of young soldiers of  the line by old commanders is, \"Never despise your enemy.\" So important a  part of the soldier's creed is it, that it is enjoined upon subalterns  pursuing marauding parties of half a dozen of the aborigines. His  over-confidence led him to treat with levity the reconnoissance of General  Tyler on the 18th, as not called for under his orders, nor necessary to  justify his plans, although they involved a delay of three days, and a  circuitous march around the Confederate left. Then, he put upon his  division commander the odium of error and uncalled-for exposure of the  troops. This broke the confidence between them, and worked more or less  evil through the ranks in the after-part of the campaign.

The flash colors  have faded in preservative, and so are of no aid in identifying these  specimens. Two are adult females with snout-vent lengths of 35 and 39  mm. In possessing a relatively large tympanum and barred thighs, and in  lacking a dorsolateral stripe they are typical of _loquax_, but in the  amount of webbing on the hands and feet, broad tarsal stripe, and  narrow anal stripe they are like _rickardsi_. The third specimen, a  juvenile, has a snout-vent length of 25 mm. In coloration it resembles  the adults; it has more distinct bars on the limbs. On the basis of  geography these specimens should be _loquax_, for the closest known  record of _rickardsi_ is more than 200 kilometers to the northwest,  whereas _loquax_ is known from several localities around San Lorenzo.    Shannon and Werler (1955:383) described _Hyla axillamembrana_ from the  lower southern slopes of Los Tuxtlas. The unique type is a small male  (27 mm. snout-vent). I have examined the type and find no great  differences between it and small specimens of _loquax_. It is not  possible to determine the color of the thighs, nor was this information  given in the description. _Hyla axillamembrana_ is here considered to  be a synonym of _Hyla loquax_.      =Hyla microcephala martini= Smith         _Oaxaca_: Donaji (15); 43 km. N of Matias Romero (19); Rio       Sarabia (2); Sarabia (11); Tolosita. _Veracruz_: Acayucan       (17); Alvarado (41); Aquilera (21); 8 km. SW of       Coatzacoalcos (10); Cosoleacaque (26); 10 km. SE of       Hueyapan; Naranja (3); Novillero.    This frog is abundant in the Gulf lowlands of the isthmus, where large  breeding congregations were found in grassy ponds on the savannas and  in openings in the forest. Most frequently males were calling from  grasses and reeds in the ponds; many individuals were perched  precariously on thin blades as high as one meter above the water. The  call is a series of low squeaks.    Individuals found at night were pale yellow above with light brown  lines arranged in an irregular pattern on the back, but often forming a  cross or an X-shaped mark in the scapular region. There is a brown  stripe from the nostril to the eye and thence to the groin. Anteriorly  this stripe is bordered above by a thin white or cream-colored line.  Numerous small brown flecks are scattered on the back and dorsal  surface of the shank. In most specimens there are thin transverse brown  bars on the shank. The thighs and undersides of the limbs are golden  yellow; the belly and vocal sac are lemon yellow. The iris is yellowish  brown. During the day individuals assume a pale reddish tan ground  color with darker brown markings. Twenty-five adult males from Alvarado  have an average snout-vent length of 24.1 mm.      =Hyla picta= Guenther         _Oaxaca_: Donaji (8); Sarabia (11); Tolosita (15); Ubero       (6). _Veracruz_: 19 km. N of Acayucan (4); Alvarado (5);       Aquilera; 8 km. SW of Coatzacoalcos; 10 km. SE of Hueyapan       (7); Lerdo de Tejada; Tula (3).    Widespread in the forests, scrub, and savannas on the Gulf lowlands of  the isthmus, these frogs were found breeding at numerous localities.  Males call from grasses and bushes growing in and about ponds. The  call is a high-pitched insect-like trill. At night these frogs are pale  yellow above; they change to light grayish tan during the day. A dark  stripe extends from the nostril to the eye and thence posteriorly to a  point between the axilla and groin. Above this dark stripe is a broader  white stripe. Scattered on the dorsum are brown flecks or spots; the  shanks are marked with poorly-defined cross-bars. The thighs are deep  yellow below and paler above with scattered dark flecks. The belly is  white, and the vocal sac is yellow. The iris is golden. Twenty males  have an average snout-vent length of 21.5 mm.; three females, 24.0 mm.      =Hyla robertmertensi= Taylor         _Oaxaca_: Tapanatepec (28); 7.5 km. NW of Tapanatepec (38);       7.2 km. WNW of Zanatepec (77).    This species was found in the isthmian region only on the Pacific  lowlands at the southern base of the western part of the Sierra Madre  de Chiapas. On July 13, 1956, many large choruses were discovered. The  calling males were on reeds and thorn scrub in and at the edge of  temporary ponds; the call is a cricket-like \"creak-creack,\" quickly  followed by a series of notes \"creak-eek-eek-eek-eek.\"    At night the dorsal ground color is pale yellow; this changes to  pinkish buff during the day. There is a grayish or brown dark stripe  from the nostril to the eye; the stripe continues to the groin. This  dark stripe is bordered above by a narrow white stripe. The belly is  white, and the vocal sac is yellow. The iris is dull reddish brown.  Twenty-five males have an average snout-vent length of 24.7 mm.      =Hyla staufferi= Cope         _Oaxaca_: Chivela; Huilotepec (5); Juchitan (4); Matias       Romero (4); 25 km. N of Matias Romero; Mixtequilla (4); Rio       Sarabia (11); 11 km. S of Santiago Chivela; Sarabia (3);       Tapanatepec (67); Tehuantepec (66); Tolosita (2); Ubero;       Union Hidalgo; Zanatepec (6). _Veracruz_: Acayucan (7);       Alvarado (3); Amatitlan; Aquilera; Ciudad Aleman (3); 8 km.       SW of Coatzacoalcos (9); Cosamaloapan (4); Cosoleacaque (8);       10 km. SE of Hueyapan; Lerdo de Tejada; Novillero (6); Tula       (2).    This is the only species of small hylid that crosses the isthmus.  Calling males were found in and about ponds on the savannas in southern  Veracruz, in ponds in open forest in northern Oaxaca (not in forest  pools), and in temporary pools in the scrub forest on the Pacific  lowlands. Individuals usually called from bushes and reeds in or at the  edge of ponds. The call is a short \"braaa.\" Dates of breeding choruses  indicate that by the time the other small species of hylids in the Gulf  lowlands reach the peak of their breeding season, that of _H.  staufferi_ is essentially over; no large breeding congregations were  found in July. On July 8, 1956, two metamorphosing young were found  clinging to blades of grass in a pond; they had snout-vent lengths of 8  and 9 mm. and tail stumps less than 3 mm. in length. Others were found  on July 13 and 26. The juveniles are nearly unicolor olive green above  and white below.    In life the adults vary greatly in color pattern. The dorsal ground  color is yellowish tan to olive brown with olive brown or dark brown  spots, some of which in certain individuals are connected to form  longitudinal dark stripes. On the posterior surface of the thighs are  small white flecks. The belly is white, and the vocal sac is a rich  yellow. Twenty males have an average snout-vent length of 26.3 mm.;  they have no horny nuptial pads. No noticeable differences in either  color or body proportions were found between the populations on either  side of the isthmus.      =Hylella sumichrasti= Brocchi         _Oaxaca_: Cerro Arenal (5); Cerro San Pedro (2); Escurano;       La Concepcion (41); Portillo Los Nanches (6); San Antonio       (16); 11 km. S of Santiago Chivela (18); Santa Lucia (7);       Tapanatepec (5); Tehuantepec (8); Tenango (49); Tres Cruces       (19).    With the exception of the series from 11 kilometers south of Santiago  Chivela, most of these specimens were found in small arboreal  bromeliads during the dry season. Males were found along a clear,  shallow, rocky stream south of Santiago Chivela on July 6, 1956. The  frogs were calling from bushes and rocks in and along the stream. When  disturbed, they jumped into the water and floated downstream until they  were able to hold onto a rock or other object. The call is a loud  \"bra-a-ah.\" In breeding individuals the dorsum is pale yellow; the  belly is white, and the vocal sac is yellow. The iris is pale golden  yellow. Eighteen males have an average snout-vent length of 25.2 mm.  All have dark brown nuptial tuberosities on the pollex.    Certain diagnostic characters of this species as given by Taylor  (1943a:50) and Taylor and Smith (1945:598) are in need of revision.  _Hylella sumichrasti_ has been characterized as having no vocal sac,  rarely having vomerine teeth, and as having a relatively smooth throat.  The vocal sac in breeding males is quite evident; it is single, median,  and when expanded, spherical. The openings into the vocal sac are  narrow slits along the inner posterior border of the jaw rami. Of 151  specimens studied, 74 have vomerine ridges between the choanae, and 36  of these have one to three teeth on each ridge. The belly and  undersurfaces of the thighs are granular; the throat is only somewhat  less so. The granular condition may be correlated with breeding, for  "]]]
