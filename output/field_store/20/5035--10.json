There were also other  masters who worked at medals carved in steel, which may be called the  models and true guides for those who aim at striking coins in the most  perfect style. All these divers arts I set myself with unflagging  industry to learn.    I must not omit the exquisite art of enamelling, in which I have never  known any one excel save a Florentine, our countryman, called Amerigo.  [6] I did not know him, but was well acquainted with his incomparable  masterpieces. Nothing in any part of the world or by craftsman that I  have seen, approached the divine beauty of their workmanship. To this  branch too I devoted myself with all my strength, although it is  extremely difficult, chiefly because of the fire, which, after long time  and trouble spent in other processes, has to be applied at last, and not  unfrequently brings the whole to ruin. In spite of its great  difficulties, it gave me so much pleasure that I looked upon them as  recreation; and this came from the special gift which the God of nature  bestowed on me, that is to say, a temperament so happy and of such  excellent parts that I was freely able to accomplish whatever it pleased  me to take in hand. The various departments of art which I have  described are very different one from the other, so that a man who  excels in one of them, if he undertakes the others, hardly ever achieves  the same success; whereas I strove with all my power to become equally  versed in all of them: and in the proper place I shall demonstrate that  I attained my object.    Note 1. St. Johns Day was the great Florentine Festival, on which all  the Guilds went in procession with pageants through the city. Of the  Florentine painter, II Rosso, or Maitre Roux, this is the first mention  by Cellini. He went to France in 1534, and died an obscure death there  in 1541.    Note 2. This Rienzo, Renzo, or Lorenzo da Ceri, was a captain of  adventurers or Condottiere, who hired his mercenary forces to  paymasters. He defended Crema for the Venetians in 1514, and conquered  Urbino for the Pope in 1515. Afterwards he fought for the French in the  Italian wars. We shall hear more of him again during the sack of Rome.    Note 3. The Italian, 'restando dal mio avversario,' seems to mean that  Cellinis opponent proposed an accommodation, apologized, or stayed the  duel at a certain point.    Note 4. See Cellinis Treatise 'Oreficeria,' cap. vi., for more  particulars about this artist.    Note 5. His real name was Ambrogio Foppa. The nickname Caradosso is said  to have stuck to him in consequence of a Spaniard calling him  Bears-face in his own tongue. He struck Leo Xs coins; and we possess  some excellent medallion portraits by his hand.    Note 6. For him, consult Cellinis 'Oreficeria.'    XXVII    AT that time, while I was still a young man of about twenty-three, there  raged a plague of such extraordinary violence that many thousands died  of it every day in Rome. Somewhat terrified at this calamity, I began to  take certain amusements, as my mind suggested, and for a reason which I  will presently relate. I had formed a habit of going on feast-days to  the ancient buildings, and copying parts of them in wax or with the  pencil; and since these buildings are all ruins, and the ruins house  innumerable pigeons, it came into my head to use my gun against these  birds. So then, avoiding all commerce with people, in my terror of the  plague, I used to put a fowling-piece on my boy Pagolinos shoulder, and  he and I went out alone into the ruins; and oftentimes we came home  laden with a cargo of the fattest pigeons. I did not care to charge my  gun with more than a single ball; and thus it was by pure skill in the  art that I filled such heavy bags. I had a fowling-piece which I had  made myself; inside and out it was as bright as any mirror. I also used  to make a very fine sort of powder, in doing which I discovered secret  processes, beyond any which have yet been found; and on this point, in  order to be brief, I will give but one particular, which will astonish  good shots of every degree. This is, that when I charged my gun with  powder weighing one-fifth of the ball, it carried two hundred paces  point-blank. It is true that the great delight I took in this exercise  bid fair to withdraw me from my art and studies; yet in another way it  gave me more than it deprived me of, seeing that each time I went out  shooting I returned with greatly better health, because the open air was  a benefit to my constitution. My natural temperament was melancholy, and  while I was taking these amusements, my heart leapt up with joy, and I  found that I could work better and with far greater mastery than when I  spent my whole time in study and manual labour. In this way my gun, at  the end of the game, stood me more in profit than in loss.    It was also the cause of my making acquaintance with certain hunters  after curiosities, who followed in the track [1] of those Lombard  peasants who used to come to Rome to till the vineyards at the proper  season. While digging the ground, they frequently turned up antique  medals, agates, chrysoprases, cornelians, and cameos; also sometimes  jewels, as, for instance, emeralds, sapphires, diamonds, and rubies. The  peasants used to sell things of this sort to the traders for a mere  trifle; and I very often, when I met them, paid the latter several times  as many golden crowns as they had given giulios for some object.  Independently of the profit I made by this traffic, which was at least  tenfold, it brought me also into agreeable relations with nearly all the  cardinals of Rome. I will only touch upon a few of the most notable and  the rarest of these curiosities. There came into my hands, among many  other fragments, the head of a dolphin about as big as a good-sized  ballot-bean. Not only was the style of this head extremely beautiful,  but nature had here far surpassed art; for the stone was an emerald of  such good colour, that the man who bought it from me for tens of crowns  sold it again for hundreds after setting it as a finger-ring. I will  mention another kind of gem; this was a magnificent topaz; and here art  equalled nature; it was as large as a big hazel-nut, with the head of  Minerva in a style of inconceivable beauty. I remember yet another  precious stone, different from these; it was a cameo, engraved with  Hercules binding Cerberus of the triple throat; such was its beauty and  the skill of its workmanship, that our great Michel Agnolo protested he  had never seen anything so wonderful. Among many bronze medals, I  obtained one upon which was a head of Jupiter. It was the largest that  had ever been seen; the head of the most perfect execution; and it had  on the reverse side a very fine design of some little figures in the  same style. I might enlarge at great length on this curiosity; but I  will refrain for fear of being prolix.    Note 1. 'Stavano alle velette.' Perhaps 'lay in wait for.'    XXVIII    AS I have said above, the plague had broken out in Rome; but though I  must return a little way upon my steps, I shall not therefore abandon  the main path of my history. There arrived in Rome a surgeon of the  highest renown, who was called Maestro Giacomo da Carpi. [1] This able  man, in the course of his other practice, undertook the most desperate  cases of the so-called French disease. In Rome this kind of illness is  very partial to the priests, and especially to the richest of them.  When, therefore, Maestro Giacomo had made his talents known, he  professed to work miracles in the treatment of such cases by means of  certain fumigations; but he only undertook a cure after stipulating for  his fees, which he reckoned not by tens, but by hundreds of crowns. He  was a great connoisseur in the arts of design. Chancing to pass one day  before my shop, he saw a lot of drawings which I had laid upon the  counter, and among these were several designs for little vases in a  capricious style, which I had sketched for my amusement. These vases  were in quite a different fashion from any which had been seen up to  that date. He was anxious that I should finish one or two of them for  him in silver; and this I did with the fullest satisfaction, seeing they  exactly suited my own fancy. The clever surgeon paid me very well, and  yet the honour which the vases brought me was worth a hundred times as  much; for the best craftsmen in the goldsmiths trade declared they had  never seen anything more beautiful or better executed.    No sooner had I finished them than he showed them to the Pope; and the  next day following he betook himself away from Rome. He was a man of  much learning, who used to discourse wonderfully about medicine. The  Pope would fain have had him in his service, but he replied that he  would not take service with anybody in the world, and that whoso had  need of him might come to seek him out. He was a person of great  sagacity, and did wisely to get out of Rome; for not many months  afterwards, all the patients he had treated grew so ill that they were a  hundred times worse off than before he came. He would certainly have  been murdered if he had stopped. He showed my little vases to several  persons of quality; amongst others, to the most excellent Duke of  Ferrara, and pretended that he had got them from a great lord in Rome,  by telling this nobleman that if he wanted to be cured, he must give him  those two vases; and that the lord had answered that they were antique,  and besought him to ask for anything else which it might be convenient  for him to give, provided only he would leave him those; but, according  to his own account, Maestro Giacomo made as though he would not  undertake the cure, and so he got them.    I was told this by Messer Alberto Bendedio in Ferrara, who with great  ostentation showed me "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4035"],[0,"Greek Studies: a Series of Essays (#12)"],[1,"and give their sanction to her deed.  And as the Bacchanals supplement the chorus, and must be added to it  to make the conception of it complete; so in the conception of  Dionysus also a certain transference, or substitution, must be made--  much of the horror and sorrow of Agave, of Pentheus, of the whole  tragic situation, must be transferred to him, if we wish to realise  in the older, profounder, and more complete sense of his nature, that  mystical being of Greek tradition to whom all these experiences--his  madness, the chase, his imprisonment and death, his peace again--  really belong; and to discern which, through Euripides' peculiar  treatment of his subject, is part of the curious interest of this  play.    Through the sophism of Euripides!  For that, again, is the really  descriptive word, with which Euripides, a lover of sophisms, as  Aristophanes knows, himself supplies us.  Well;--this softened  version of the Bacchic madness is a sophism of Euripides; and  Dionysus Omophagus--the eater of raw flesh, must be added to the  golden image of Dionysus Meilichius--the honey-sweet, if the old  tradition in its completeness is to be, in spite of that sophism, our  closing impression; if we are to catch, in its fulness, that deep  undercurrent of horror which runs below, all through [79] this masque  of spring, and realise the spectacle of that wild chase, in which  Dionysus is ultimately both the hunter and the spoil.    But meantime another person appears on the stage; Cadmus enters,  followed by attendants bearing on a bier the torn limbs of Pentheus,  which lying wildly scattered through the tangled wood, have been with  difficulty collected and now decently put together and covered over.  In the little that still remains before the end of the play, destiny  now hurrying things rapidly forward, and strong emotions, hopes and  forebodings being now closely packed, Euripides has before him an  artistic problem of enormous difficulty.  Perhaps this very haste and  close-packing of the matter, which keeps the mind from dwelling  overmuch on detail, relieves its real extravagance, and those who  read it carefully will think that the pathos of Euripides has been  equal to the occasion.  In a few profoundly designed touches he  depicts the perplexity of Cadmus, in whose house a god had become an  inmate, only to destroy it--the regret of the old man for the one  male child to whom that house had looked up as the pillar whereby  aged people might feel secure; the piteous craziness of Agave; the  unconscious irony with which she caresses the florid, youthful head  of her son; the delicate breaking of the thing to her reviving  intelligence, as Cadmus, though he can but wish that she might live  on for ever in her visionary enjoyment, [80] prepares the way, by  playing on that other horrible legend of the Theban house, the  tearing of Actaeon to death--he too destroyed by a god.  He gives us  the sense of Agave's gradual return to reason through many glimmering  doubts, till she wakes up at last to find the real face turned up  towards the mother and murderess; the quite naturally spontaneous  sorrow of the mother, ending with her confession, down to her last  sigh, and the final breaking up of the house of Cadmus; with a result  so genuine, heartfelt, and dignified withal in its expression of a  strange ineffable woe, that a fragment of it, the lamentation of  Agave over her son, in which the long-pent agony at last finds vent,  were, it is supposed, adopted into his paler work by an early  Christian poet, and have figured since, as touches of real fire, in  the Christus Patiens of Gregory Nazianzen.

THE MYTH OF DEMETER AND PERSEPHONE: I    [81] No chapter in the history of human imagination is more curious  than the myth of Demeter, and Kore or Persephone.  Alien in some  respects from the genuine traditions of Greek mythology, a relic of  the earlier inhabitants of Greece, and having but a subordinate place  in the religion of Homer, it yet asserted its interest, little by  little, and took a complex hold on the minds of the Greeks, becoming  finally the central and most popular subject of their national  worship.  Following its changes, we come across various phases of  Greek culture, which are not without their likenesses in the modern  mind.  We trace it in the dim first period of instinctive popular  conception; we see it connecting itself with many impressive elements  of art, and poetry, and religious custom, with the picturesque  superstitions of the many, and with the finer intuitions of the few;  and besides this, it is in itself full of [82] interest and  suggestion, to all for whom the ideas of the Greek religion have any  real meaning in the modern world.  And the fortune of the myth has  not deserted it in later times.  In the year 1780, the long-lost text  of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter was discovered among the manuscripts  of the imperial library at Moscow; and, in our own generation, the  tact of an eminent student of Greek art, Sir Charles Newton, has  restored to the world the buried treasures of the little temple and  precinct of Demeter, at Cnidus, which have many claims to rank in the  central order of Greek sculpture.  The present essay is an attempt to  select and weave together, for those who are now approaching the  deeper study of Greek thought, whatever details in the development of  this myth, arranged with a view rather to a total impression than to  the debate of particular points, may seem likely to increase their  stock of poetical impressions, and to add to this some criticisms on  the expression which it has left of itself in extant art and poetry.    The central expression, then, of the story of Demeter and Persephone  is the Homeric hymn, to which Grote has assigned a date at least as  early as six hundred years before Christ. The one survivor of a whole  family of hymns on this subject, it was written, perhaps, for one of  those contests which took place on the seventh day of the Eleusinian  festival, and in which a bunch of [83] ears of corn was the prize;  perhaps, for actual use in the mysteries themselves, by the  Hierophantes, or Interpreter, who showed to the worshippers at  Eleusis those sacred places to which the poem contains so many  references.  About the composition itself there are many difficult  questions, with various surmises as to why it has remained only in  this unique manuscript of the end of the fourteenth century.  Portions of the text are missing, and there are probably some  additions by later hands; yet most scholars have admitted that it  possesses some of the true characteristics of the Homeric style, some  genuine echoes of the age immediately succeeding that which produced  the Iliad and the Odyssey.  Listen now to a somewhat abbreviated  version of it.    \"I begin the song of Demeter\"--says the prize-poet, or the  Interpreter, the Sacristan of the holy places--\"the song of Demeter  and her daughter Persephone, whom Aidoneus carried away by the  consent of Zeus, as she played, apart from her mother, with the deep-  bosomed daughters of the Ocean, gathering flowers in a meadow of soft  grass--roses and the crocus and fair violets and flags, and  hyacinths, and, above all, the strange flower of the narcissus, which  the Earth, favouring the desire of Aidoneus, brought forth for the  first time, to snare the footsteps of the flower-like girl.  A  hundred [84] heads of blossom grew up from the roots of it, and the  sky and the earth and the salt wave of the sea were glad at the scent  thereof.  She stretched forth her hands to take the flower; thereupon  the earth opened, and the king of the great nation of the dead sprang  out with his immortal horses.  He seized the unwilling girl, and bore  her away weeping, on his golden chariot.  She uttered a shrill cry,  calling upon her father Zeus; but neither man nor god heard her  voice, nor even the nymphs of the meadow where she played; except  Hecate only, the daughter of Persaeus, sitting, as ever, in her cave,  half veiled with a shining veil, thinking delicate thoughts; she, and  the Sun also, heard her.    \"So long as she could still see the earth, and the sky, and the sea  with the great waves moving, and the beams of the sun, and still  thought to see again her mother, and the race of the ever-living  gods, so long hope soothed her, in the midst of her grief.  The peaks  of the hills and the depths of the sea echoed her cry.  And the  mother heard it.  A sharp pain seized her at the heart; she plucked  the veil from her hair, and cast down the blue hood from her  shoulders, and fled forth like a bird, seeking Persephone over dry  land and sea.  But neither man nor god would tell her the truth; nor  did any bird come to her as a sure messenger.    \"Nine days she wandered up and down upon the earth, having blazing  torches in her hands; [85] and, in her great sorrow, she refused to  taste of ambrosia, or of the cup of the sweet nectar, nor washed her  face.  But when the tenth morning came, Hecate met her, having a  light in her hands.  But Hecate had heard the voice only, and had  seen no one, and could not tell Demeter who had borne the girl away.
