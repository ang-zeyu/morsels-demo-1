But further, DEMEA; this objection which you urge can never be made use  of by CLEANTHES, without renouncing a defence which he has already made  against one of my objections. When I inquired concerning the cause of  that supreme reason and intelligence into which he resolves every thing;  he told me, that the impossibility of satisfying such inquiries could  never be admitted as an objection in any species of philosophy. \"We must  stop somewhere\", says he; \"nor is it ever within the reach of human  capacity to explain ultimate causes, or show the last connections of any  objects. It is sufficient, if any steps, so far as we go, are supported  by experience and observation.\" Now, that vegetation and generation, as  well as reason, are experienced to be principles of order in nature, is  undeniable. If I rest my system of cosmogony on the former, preferably to  the latter, it is at my choice. The matter seems entirely arbitrary. And  when CLEANTHES asks me what is the cause of my great vegetative or  generative faculty, I am equally entitled to ask him the cause of his  great reasoning principle. These questions we have agreed to forbear on  both sides; and it is chiefly his interest on the present occasion to  stick to this agreement. Judging by our limited and imperfect experience,  generation has some privileges above reason: for we see every day the  latter arise from the former, never the former from the latter.    Compare, I beseech you, the consequences on both sides. The world, say I,  resembles an animal; therefore it is an animal, therefore it arose from  generation. The steps, I confess, are wide; yet there is some small  appearance of analogy in each step. The world, says CLEANTHES, resembles  a machine; therefore it is a machine, therefore it arose from design. The  steps are here equally wide, and the analogy less striking. And if he  pretends to carry on my hypothesis a step further, and to infer design or  reason from the great principle of generation, on which I insist; I may,  with better authority, use the same freedom to push further his  hypothesis, and infer a divine generation or theogony from his principle  of reason. I have at least some faint shadow of experience, which is the  utmost that can ever be attained in the present subject. Reason, in  innumerable instances, is observed to arise from the principle of  generation, and never to arise from any other principle.    HESIOD, and all the ancient mythologists, were so struck with this  analogy, that they universally explained the origin of nature from an  animal birth, and copulation. PLATO too, so far as he is intelligible,  seems to have adopted some such notion in his TIMAEUS.    The BRAHMINS assert, that the world arose from an infinite spider, who  spun this whole complicated mass from his bowels, and annihilates  afterwards the whole or any part of it, by absorbing it again, and  resolving it into his own essence. Here is a species of cosmogony, which  appears to us ridiculous; because a spider is a little contemptible  animal, whose operations we are never likely to take for a model of the  whole universe. But still here is a new species of analogy, even in our  globe. And were there a planet wholly inhabited by spiders, (which is  very possible,) this inference would there appear as natural and  irrefragable as that which in our planet ascribes the origin of all  things to design and intelligence, as explained by CLEANTHES. Why an  orderly system may not be spun from the belly as well as from the brain,  it will be difficult for him to give a satisfactory reason.    I must confess, PHILO, replied CLEANTHES, that of all men living, the  task which you have undertaken, of raising doubts and objections, suits  you best, and seems, in a manner, natural and unavoidable to you. So  great is your fertility of invention, that I am not ashamed to  acknowledge myself unable, on a sudden, to solve regularly such  out-of-the-way difficulties as you incessantly start upon me: though I  clearly see, in general, their fallacy and error. And I question not, but  you are yourself, at present, in the same case, and have not the solution  so ready as the objection: while you must be sensible, that common sense  and reason are entirely against you; and that such whimsies as you have  delivered, may puzzle, but never can convince us.          PART 8      What you ascribe to the fertility of my invention, replied PHILO, is  entirely owing to the nature of the subject. In subjects adapted to the  narrow compass of human reason, there is commonly but one determination,  which carries probability or conviction with it; and to a man of sound  judgement, all other suppositions, but that one, appear entirely absurd  and chimerical. But in such questions as the present, a hundred  contradictory views may preserve a kind of imperfect analogy; and  invention has here full scope to exert itself. Without any great effort  of thought, I believe that I could, in an instant, propose other systems  of cosmogony, which would have some faint appearance of truth, though it  is a thousand, a million to one, if either yours or any one of mine be  the true system.    For instance, what if I should revive the old EPICUREAN hypothesis? This  is commonly, and I believe justly, esteemed the most absurd system that  has yet been proposed; yet I know not whether, with a few alterations, it  might not be brought to bear a faint appearance of probability. Instead  of supposing matter infinite, as EPICURUS did, let us suppose it finite.  A finite number of particles is only susceptible of finite transpositions:  and it must happen, in an eternal duration, that every possible order or  position must be tried an infinite number of times. This world, therefore,  with all its events, even the most minute, has before been produced and  destroyed, and will again be produced and destroyed, without any bounds  and limitations. No one, who has a conception of the powers of infinite,  in comparison of finite, will ever scruple this determination.    But this supposes, said DEMEA, that matter can acquire motion, without  any voluntary agent or first mover.    And where is the difficulty, replied PHILO, of that supposition? Every  event, before experience, is equally difficult and incomprehensible; and  every event, after experience, is equally easy and intelligible. Motion,  in many instances, from gravity, from elasticity, from electricity,  begins in matter, without any known voluntary agent: and to suppose  always, in these cases, an unknown voluntary agent, is mere hypothesis;  and hypothesis attended with no advantages. The beginning of motion in  matter itself is as conceivable a priori as its communication from mind  and intelligence.    Besides, why may not motion have been propagated by impulse through all  eternity, and the same stock of it, or nearly the same, be still upheld  in the universe? As much is lost by the composition of motion, as much is  gained by its resolution. And whatever the causes are, the fact is  certain, that matter is, and always has been, in continual agitation, as  far as human experience or tradition reaches. There is not probably, at  present, in the whole universe, one particle of matter at absolute rest.    And this very consideration too, continued PHILO, which we have stumbled  on in the course of the argument, suggests a new hypothesis of cosmogony,  that is not absolutely absurd and improbable. Is there a system, an  order, an economy of things, by which matter can preserve that perpetual  agitation which seems essential to it, and yet maintain a constancy in  the forms which it produces? There certainly is such an economy; for this  is actually the case with the present world. The continual motion of  matter, therefore, in less than infinite transpositions, must produce  this economy or order; and by its very nature, that order, when once  established, supports itself, for many ages, if not to eternity. But  wherever matter is so poised, arranged, and adjusted, as to continue in  perpetual motion, and yet preserve a constancy in the forms, its  situation must, of necessity, have all the same appearance of art and  contrivance which we observe at present. All the parts of each form must  have a relation to each other, and to the whole; and the whole itself  must have a relation to the other parts of the universe; to the element  in which the form subsists; to the materials with which it repairs its  waste and decay; and to every other form which is hostile or friendly. A  defect in any of these particulars destroys the form; and the matter of  which it is composed is again set loose, and is thrown into irregular  motions and fermentations, till it unite itself to some other regular  form. If no such form be prepared to receive it, and if there be a great  quantity of this corrupted matter in the universe, the universe itself is  entirely disordered; whether it be the feeble embryo of a world in its  first beginnings that is thus destroyed, or the rotten carcass of one  languishing in old age and infirmity. In either case, a chaos ensues;  till finite, though innumerable revolutions produce at last some forms,  whose parts and organs are so adjusted as to support the forms amidst a  continued succession of matter.    Suppose (for we shall endeavour to vary the expression), that matter were  thrown into any position, by a blind, unguided force; it is evident that  this first position must, in all probability, be the most confused and  most disorderly imaginable, without any resemblance to those works of  human contrivance, which, along with a symmetry of parts, discover an  adjustment of means to ends, and a tendency to self-preservation. If the  actuating force cease after this operation, matter must remain for ever  in disorder, and continue an immense chaos, without any proportion or  activity. But suppose that the actuating force,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45846"],[0,"Letters Exhibiting the Most Prominent Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of (#12)"],[1,"in these days! speak in  tongues now! heal the sick now! have visions of future things, and  even heavenly things like unto the ancients! The exclaimant stands  aghast with astonishment, as a perfect stranger to the most obvious and  conspicuous principles of ancient christianity.    Modern christianity professes to derive all its light, and its various  clashing creeds, from the Old and New Testament. If modern christianity  is, indeed, the offspring of the Bible, it is a prodigy with many  hundred heads; but ancient christianity drew its light from the ROCK of  immediate revelation, and previous scriptures were only confirmatory of  the Spirit's testimony. Illiterate fishermen, like Peter, traditionated  by a corrupt priesthood, could know next to nothing of the written  manuscripts of the Bible. What he learnt was not from flesh and blood,  but from the spirit of revelation; and let it be always in your  mind, sir, that Christ has said, that on \"THIS ROCK\" of _immediate  revelation_ \"He will build His church.\"    A christianity contained exclusively in a small volume like the Bible,  is an insult to the capacious revelations of the Eternal Spirit of  God, that even searches the deep things of God--a mere drop compared  with the mighty ocean! The full biography of Jesus Christ contained in  the New Testament? Nonsense! Preposterous mockery! You certainly are  not ignorant of the last verse in John's gospel--\"_The world itself  could not contain the account, if written, of the acts and doings_ of  Jesus Christ.\" But shall the knowledge of Christ be buried in oblivion  because his acts and sayings cannot be written? No, by no means; God  forbid! What saith the scriptures? the all-wise \"Spirit shall bring  _all things_ to your remembrance, even the deep things of God--things  that the tongue cannot utter nor the heart conceive.\"    Without the Holy Spirit of revelation, to take of the things of Jesus  and convey them to the knowledge of men, I boldly aver that NO man  can harmonize a consistent system from the Old and New Testament, or  find eternal life. Every man must be born of that spirit which gives  revelation and knowledge of Christ, or he can never see the kingdom  of God. But a prominent feature in the creed of modern christianity  is, that there is no further need of revelation, consequently the  distinct office-work of the Spirit, to bring to mind unwritten acts  and doctrines of Christ, and harmonize those which are written and  scattered promiscuously through the Bible, is abrogated and deemed  superfluous by modern christianity!    O thou benighted advocate of modern christianity, how long shall thy  eye be veiled in reading the New Testament, and thine heart be too  gross to perceive the beauty, and comfort, and power of that blessed  Spirit that gave life and salvation to ancient christianity? Hast thou  lost all admiration for the Spirit's miraculous gifts, power, and  blessing? settled down under reconciliation to a load of doubts and  fears, hoping that death will remove thy tormenting burden? Vain hope!  No longer then do despite to that Eternal Spirit of revelation that  is freely promised to all that will honestly receive it. If Gentile  christians are ashamed of the Jew, because a veil was before their eyes  in reading the Old Testament, has not the Jew equal cause to be ashamed  of the Gentile, that has so soon turned away from the primitive path of  the Spirit's gifts of visions, prophecies, healings, &c., and thereby  been \"cut off for not continuing in His goodness,\" according to the  warning threat of Jehovah against Gentiles.    Where, sir, are the splendid gifts of apostles and prophets,  evangelists, pastors and teachers, that Christ gave to men and set in  his church, forever to continue in the ministry, edifying \"the BODY of  Christ till we all come to the unity of faith,\" and to such a knowledge  of God, and fulness of power and wisdom as dwelt even in Jesus? They  are nowhere to be found in modern christianity! Modern christianity has  the effrontery and shamelessness even to say that she does not need  them; consequently she says that she does not need \"to come to unity of  faith,\" and to that full and potent knowledge of God that Jesus in the  flesh possessed, and had decreed that all Saints should possess and be  like their \"elder brother.\"    Not one of these great and precious gifts are retained. The bare  name of evangelists and pastors is retained in modern christianity,  without the shadow of the power and prophetic knowledge of the Holy  Ghost, with which these officers were _obliged_ to be endued in the  primitive church. She admits, indeed, the form of the office, \"denying  the power.\" She says, indeed, that she can come to \"unity of faith,\"  &c., without apostles, and without the help of the good old-fashioned  Almighty Holy Ghost.    But how long a time does she want to run for this prize of \"unity  of faith, &c.?\" She has been running for the stakes nearly EIGHTEEN  HUNDRED YEARS, and is further from the goal than when we started. When  she started, \"false apostles and deceitful workers\" were her champions.  In order to win the prize, these shed the blood of true apostles, and  the blood of saints was found in their garments. And when her followers  found that she had only the form or name of apostles and prophets  without the power, she said, we have no further need of apostles, they  have done their work and miracles have ceased. Oh, thou blood-guilty,  \"lying,\" Gentile christianity! thy lineage takes hold of the mother of  abominations, clothed in scarlet! How great will be the severity of  God's judgments upon all that are accessory to modern christianity,  except they repent and obey the gospel!    She has also changed the ordinances. Where is now the ordinance of  anointing with oil? Where the ordinance of imposition of hands? The  healing of the sick is given up to medical men, whose reliance is on  anything but the _power_ and established ordinance of God. Is it not  written for the benefit of the sick, that they should call for the  _elders_ of the church, whose duty it is to \"anoint the sick with oil  and lay on hands and they _shall recover_?\" Now the consequence of  changing this _one ordinance_ of the Bible to the medical nostrums of  men, is the literal death of thousands, who change the ordinance and  contribute to make this whole earth the _burying ground_ of nations.    Sir, may I not significantly ask, will the priests of the day return  unto the Lord and teach his \"law and his testimony,\" or will they with  hearts of stone see the inhabitants of the earth perish under the curse  of \"trusting in _medical_ man and making flesh an arm?\"    The prophet Isaiah says, the consequence of changing the ordinances  is, to make the earth empty and desolate! But this is not the only  ordinance that is changed. By laying on hands for the gift of the Holy  Spirit, the authority to prophecy, speak with new tongues, and cast out  devils, is conferred. Now, unless boasting christianity has secured  peace and fellowship with the devil, it is of much importance to know  how to cast him out. Unless they have wisdom and power, and the spirit  of prophecy, to supersede the need of the Holy Spirit, it is very  essential to observe the ordinances by which, alone, it is conferred.    But it is certain, that if the Holy Spirit, in all its supernatural  office-work of miraculous omnipotence and wisdom, does not come and  reign on the earth, then the kingdom of God will never come on the  earth as it exists in heaven. But the scriptures assure us that  the kingdom of God will break in pieces all other kingdoms, and be  established on earth, even as it is in heaven, and the palace of God  (tabernacle) be in the midst of the human family.    The Holy Ghost is the grand agent by which the different orders of  priesthood, have all their authority, wisdom, and power, to teach and  administer the laws and ordinances of heaven to men on earth. The  \"MANIFOLD WISDOM OF GOD\" flows through these orders of priesthood from  heaven to earth. But modern christianity has abolished these orders of  priesthood, as no longer necessary; consequently, the communications  from heaven to earth have been stopped for nearly _eighteen hundred  years_; and from _this cause_, our race has witnessed the most  appalling picture of the progress of crime and wretchedness, that  has ever pervaded the earth since the dawn of creation. No man has  sufficient knowledge of figures to enumerate THE MILLIONS that have  been slain in war, since the Gentiles were cut off for unbelief. The  pestilence has never slumbered since man rejected the healing ordinance  of God, for the aid of physicians that are of no value. Famine has  locked hands with pestilence, causing _rot_, and _blast_, and _mildew_  to lead many to fear that God had repented himself of the \"promised  seed time and harvest.\"    The social virtues that ought to be and ever would be, under the  reign of God, like salubrious breezes of heaven, have become like the  antagonistic and forked teeth of a _picking cylinder_, that turned  ever so much, will still be _picking_ either in the offensive or  defensive. The number of the oppressed is becoming so fearfully great  and vast, that the captors know not where to find either room or  keepers for their prisoners. The yoke of intolerance must have fresh  iron fastenings of unheard of tenacity and rigour. The oppressor feels  the danger of an awful outbreak from desperation that can be smothered  no longer. The elements of revolution and self-destruction, are sown  deep in every government, and in every religious and social system that  has not for its basis _truth, immediately and continually revealed from  heaven_!    Now, all this direful state of things is because that men have  \"forsaken God, the fountain of living waters, and hewn them out  cisterns that can hold no water.\" \"From the crown of"]]]
