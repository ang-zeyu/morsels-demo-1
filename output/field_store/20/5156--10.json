Halting at the door of Hyrum Smith, I heard  the sobs and groans of his wife at Hyrum's parting. She was then near  confinement and needed more than ever the comfort and consolation of a  husband's presence. As we returned to the wagon we witnessed the sad,  parting of Sidney Rigdon and his family, and in the same wagon was  Joseph Smith, while his aged father and mother came up overwhelmed with  tears, and took each of the prisoners by the hand with a silence of  grief too great for utterance.    Little encouragement was left to those grief-stricken parents, for they  knew so well that they were in the hands of a mob who had snatched and  dragged them away as if they were murderers. Fresh to their minds was  recalled a scene that took place in earlier days, when, close to their  own thresholds, a demon in human form, in the dark hour of the night,  had fired at their son, just barely missing him. There were fifty-six  citizens thus dragged away from their homes, without any earthly hope  of deliverance, only as in God they put their trust. Judge King said to  H. C. Kimball:    \"Joe Smith is not fit to live.\"    For further light concerning the good or evil wishes of this great mob  of Missourians, we will now return to the public square to hear the  abusive words of General Clark. Addressing the Mormons he said:    \"It now devolves upon you to fulfill a treaty that you have entered  into.    \"1st.--Your leading men be given up to be tried according to the law.  This you have already complied with.    \"2nd.--That you deliver up your arms. This has been attended to [which  we did, surrounded by the mob, some of whom I heard say, 'Now we have  got their arms, it is as good as death to them.']    \"3rd.--That you sign over your properties to defray the expenses of the  war. This you have also done.    \"4th.--That you leave the state forthwith. And whatever may be your  feelings concerning this, or whatever your innocence, it is nothing to  me. General Lucas (whose military rank is equal to mine) has made this  treaty with you, and I approve of it. I should have done the same. I am  determined to see it executed. The character of this state has suffered  almost beyond redemption. And we deem it as an act of justice to  restore her character to its former standing among the states by every  proper means. The orders of the Governor to me were, that you should  be exterminated, and not allowed to remain in the state. And had not  your leaders been given up, and the terms of the treaty complied with,  before this time you and your families would have been destroyed and  your houses in ashes.    \"There is a discretionary power vested in my hands, which, considering  your circumstances, I shall exercise for a season. You are indebted to  me for this clemency. I do not say you shall go now, but you must not  think if staying here another season or of putting in crops; for, if  you do, the citizens will be upon you. If I am called here again in  case of non-compliance of a treaty made, do not think that I shall do  as I have done now. You need not expect any mercy, but extermination.  For I am determined the Governor's orders shall be executed.    \"As for your leaders, do not think, do not imagine for a moment, do not  let it enter into your minds, that they shall be delivered and restored  to you again for their fate is fixed, their die is cast. Their doom is  sealed. I am sorry, very sorry, gentlemen, to see so many intelligent  men found in this situation. Oh! if I could invoke the Great Spirit,  the unknown God--[I suppose without body, parts or passions]--to  rest upon and deliver you from that awful chain of superstition, and  liberate you from those fetters of fanaticism with which you are bound,  that you no longer do homage to a man! My advice is that you become  as other citizens, let by a recurrence of these events you bring upon  yourselves irretrievable ruin.\"    It vividly recurs to my mind that at the closing of General Clark's  hard talk, G. M. Hinkle also spoke to the large body of Saints, saying:    \"I would advise you all to do as I have done, for I have got my hand  out of the lion's mouth, and I intend to keep it out hereafter.\"    It may not be out of place to relate a statement made to me by E. B.  Tripp, who authorizes me to use his name, regarding George M. Hinkle,  whose hand he said was out of the lion's mouth (taking his own word for  it.) Elder. E. B. Tripp says:    \"In 1852, I lived in Wapelo, Louisa Co., Iowa G. M. Hinkle, a stranger  to me, came into my drug store. He introduced himself to me, saying:  'This is Mr. Tripp, I understand. I hear that you are going to Utah,  and I would like to have a private talk with you. I am the man who  betrayed Joseph Smith and others into the hands of the mob in Missouri.  I am a miserable man, and scarce know what to do with myself. I would  be willing to lay down my life if this would atone for the sin I  committed. What can I do, Mr. Tripp, for I know Mormonism is true?\"    This is the substance of the conversation as reported by Brother Tripp,  who save him some good advice before he parted with him. Thomas B.  Marsh, one of the Twelve Apostles, apostatized during this dark hour  of Missouri persecution. I saw him and heard him speak then, and also  when he came to Utah and was rebaptized. I heard him confess with deep  regret, saying:    \"Look at my trembling limbs and see the fate of an apostate, for I am  a wreck, but Mormonism is true, and I advise you not to do as I have  done, in my apostasy.\"    Gen. John C. Bennett, who once flourished in Nauvoo, apostatized  because of his iniquities. He died in Polk City, Iowa, a miserable  wreck, debased and degraded. When I was in Iowa on a mission I learned  of a party who once had a rope around his neck and over a limb. At that  time he barely escaped being hung up like a dog.    Prior to Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and others, being marched to Liberty  jail, General Lucas allowed the prisoners to see for a few moments, in  the presence of their guards, their weeping wives and children. Most of  them were not permitted to speak, being merely allowed to look at them  before being hurried away.    Mary Fielding Smith, wife of Hyrum Smith, a few days after his painful  parting from her husband, became a mother. The favored child thus born  amidst those warlike scenes is today known as Joseph Fielding Smith,  Counselor to the First Presidency.    The brethren were taken to Independence, Jackson County, Missouri,  to be murdered by those who only a few years before drove the Saints  from the country, murdering some, tarring and feathering others, and  expelling the remainder without color of law. Notwithstanding this, on  Sunday, November 4th, 1838, the Prophet preached to many who gathered  around them. The officers, finding that the people's feelings were  softened into tears of sympathy, had them removed to Richmond, where  they were chained down as felons and then removed to Liberty jail.    In September, 1888, in company with Elder Andrew Jenson and  Bishop Black, of Deseret, I visited this place, also Far West and  Adam-Ondi-Ahman. This trip brought vividly before me many sayings of  the Prophet, more particularly of his speaking of the Garden of Eden,  which he said was situated at Independence, which is only about ten  miles to the northwest of Liberty jai. The Prophet said it had been  manifested unto him that here was where our Father Adam was placed,  and where his home was until his fall, when he was driven out into the  dreary world, and from thence he took his departure northeast about  seventy miles, to where a stake of Zion was located, and it was named  Adam-Ondi-Ahman by revelation. This knowledge makes this land, which is  good and greatly blessed, all the more attractive to the Saints, and  creates a desire to cherish not only the memory of the land, but this  loathsome jail as well, which is now going to ruins.    The Bible tells us about the Garden of Eden, and why not locate it  here in this goodly land as well as any other part of the earth? Many  changes have taken place since Adam's time, as, for instance, the great  deluge and the division of the earth in the days of Peleg. Again, at  the crucifixion, when the solid rocks were rent, mountains cast up,  and great convulsions took place on the face of the whole earth. All  of these events would naturally tend to make it difficult to locate  the Garden without revelation, and this is how I became informed on  this subject. I was with the Prophet Joseph Smith sixty miles northeast  of Liberty jail in 1838, less than one year before he was imprisoned  there. We were standing with others on the hill Adam-Ondi-Ahman. The  Prophet said, pointing to a mound of stones:    \"There is where Father Adam built an altar when he was driven from the  Garden of Eden and offered up sacrifice unto the Lord.\"    He further said that the Garden of Eden was in or near Independence,  the center stake of Zion. I thought it a great privilege to be at that  time with the Prophet, and to hear his words regarding the mound and  pile of rocks laid up at so early a period of the world's history.    Three years ago I visited the same altar with deep interest, and also  the spot of ground where the Prophet received the revelation, wherein  Adam-Ondi-Ahman is named as the place where Adam shall come to visit  his people, or the Ancient of Days shall sit, as spoken of by Daniel  the Prophet. Doc. and Cov., Sec. 115, page 415. The Prophet said that  this Michael is Adam.    I quote the following from the revelation:    \"Is there not room enough upon the mountains of Adam-Ondi-Ahman ... the  land where Adam dwelt? ... Therefore come up hither to the land of my  people, even Zion.\"--Doc. and Cov., sec. 117, v. 8    Having"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/544"],[0,"Anne's House of Dreams (#12)"],[1,"marvel and magic in a silence  that asked nothing of the world or each other.  Then they went up into  the tower, and Captain Jim showed and explained the mechanism of the  great light.  Finally they found themselves in the dining room, where a  fire of driftwood was weaving flames of wavering, elusive, sea-born  hues in the open fireplace.    \"I put this fireplace in myself,\" remarked Captain Jim.  \"The  Government don't give lighthouse keepers such luxuries.  Look at the  colors that wood makes.  If you'd like some driftwood for your fire,  Mistress Blythe, I'll bring you up a load some day.  Sit down.  I'm  going to make you a cup of tea.\"    Captain Jim placed a chair for Anne, having first removed therefrom a  huge, orange-colored cat and a newspaper.    \"Get down, Matey.  The sofa is your place.  I must put this paper away  safe till I can find time to finish the story in it.  It's called A Mad  Love.  'Tisn't my favorite brand of fiction, but I'm reading it jest to  see how long she can spin it out.  It's at the sixty-second chapter  now, and the wedding ain't any nearer than when it begun, far's I can  see.  When little Joe comes I have to read him pirate yarns.  Ain't it  strange how innocent little creatures like children like the  blood-thirstiest stories?\"    \"Like my lad Davy at home,\" said Anne.  \"He wants tales that reek with  gore.\"    Captain Jim's tea proved to be nectar.  He was pleased as a child with  Anne's compliments, but he affected a fine indifference.    \"The secret is I don't skimp the cream,\" he remarked airily.  Captain  Jim had never heard of Oliver Wendell Holmes, but he evidently agreed  with that writer's dictum that \"big heart never liked little cream pot.\"    \"We met an odd-looking personage coming out of your lane,\" said Gilbert  as they sipped.  \"Who was he?\"    Captain Jim grinned.    \"That's Marshall Elliott--a mighty fine man with jest one streak of  foolishness in him.  I s'pose you wondered what his object was in  turning himself into a sort of dime museum freak.\"    \"Is he a modern Nazarite or a Hebrew prophet left over from olden  times?\" asked Anne.    \"Neither of them.  It's politics that's at the bottom of his freak.  All those Elliotts and Crawfords and MacAllisters are dyed-in-the-wool  politicians.  They're born Grit or Tory, as the case may be, and they  live Grit or Tory, and they die Grit or Tory; and what they're going to  do in heaven, where there's probably no politics, is more than I can  fathom.  This Marshall Elliott was born a Grit.  I'm a Grit myself in  moderation, but there's no moderation about Marshall.  Fifteen years  ago there was a specially bitter general election.  Marshall fought for  his party tooth and nail.  He was dead sure the Liberals would win--so  sure that he got up at a public meeting and vowed that he wouldn't  shave his face or cut his hair until the Grits were in power.  Well,  they didn't go in--and they've never got in yet--and you saw the result  today for yourselves.  Marshall stuck to his word.\"    \"What does his wife think of it?\" asked Anne.    \"He's a bachelor.  But if he had a wife I reckon she couldn't make him  break that vow.  That family of Elliotts has always been more stubborn  than natteral.  Marshall's brother Alexander had a dog he set great  store by, and when it died the man actilly wanted to have it buried in  the graveyard, 'along with the other Christians,' he said.  Course, he  wasn't allowed to; so he buried it just outside the graveyard fence,  and never darkened the church door again.  But Sundays he'd drive his  family to church and sit by that dog's grave and read his Bible all the  time service was going on.  They say when he was dying he asked his  wife to bury him beside the dog; she was a meek little soul but she  fired up at THAT.  She said SHE wasn't going to be buried beside no  dog, and if he'd rather have his last resting place beside the dog than  beside her, jest to say so.  Alexander Elliott was a stubborn mule, but  he was fond of his wife, so he give in and said, 'Well, durn it, bury  me where you please.  But when Gabriel's trump blows I expect my dog to  rise with the rest of us, for he had as much soul as any durned Elliott  or Crawford or MacAllister that ever strutted.'  Them was HIS parting  words.  As for Marshall, we're all used to him, but he must strike  strangers as right down peculiar-looking.  I've known him ever since he  was ten--he's about fifty now--and I like him.  Him and me was out  cod-fishing today.  That's about all I'm good for now--catching trout  and cod occasional.  But 'tweren't always so--not by no manner of  means.  I used to do other things, as you'd admit if you saw my  life-book.\"    Anne was just going to ask what his life-book was when the First Mate  created a diversion by springing upon Captain Jim's knee.  He was a  gorgeous beastie, with a face as round as a full moon, vivid green  eyes, and immense, white, double paws.  Captain Jim stroked his velvet  back gently.    \"I never fancied cats much till I found the First Mate,\" he remarked,  to the accompaniment of the Mate's tremendous purrs.  \"I saved his  life, and when you've saved a creature's life you're bound to love it.  It's next thing to giving life.  There's some turrible thoughtless  people in the world, Mistress Blythe.  Some of them city folks who have  summer homes over the harbor are so thoughtless that they're cruel.  It's the worst kind of cruelty--the thoughtless kind.  You can't cope  with it.  They keep cats there in the summer, and feed and pet 'em, and  doll 'em up with ribbons and collars.  And then in the fall they go off  and leave 'em to starve or freeze.  It makes my blood boil, Mistress  Blythe.  One day last winter I found a poor old mother cat dead on the  shore, lying against the skin-and-bone bodies of her three little  kittens.  She'd died trying to shelter 'em.  She had her poor stiff  paws around 'em.  Master, I cried.  Then I swore.  Then I carried them  poor little kittens home and fed 'em up and found good homes for 'em.  I knew the woman who left the cat and when she come back this summer I  jest went over the harbor and told her my opinion of her.  It was rank  meddling, but I do love meddling in a good cause.\"    \"How did she take it?\" asked Gilbert.    \"Cried and said she 'didn't think.'  I says to her, says I, 'Do you  s'pose that'll be held for a good excuse in the day of Jedgment, when  you'll have to account for that poor old mother's life?  The Lord'll  ask you what He give you your brains for if it wasn't to think, I  reckon.'  I don't fancy she'll leave cats to starve another time.\"    \"Was the First Mate one of the forsaken?\" asked Anne, making advances  to him which were responded to graciously, if condescendingly.    \"Yes.  I found HIM one bitter cold day in winter, caught in the  branches of a tree by his durn-fool ribbon collar.  He was almost  starving.  If you could have seen his eyes, Mistress Blythe!  He was  nothing but a kitten, and he'd got his living somehow since he'd been  left until he got hung up.  When I loosed him he gave my hand a pitiful  swipe with his little red tongue.  He wasn't the able seaman you see  now.  He was meek as Moses.  That was nine years ago.  His life has  been long in the land for a cat.  He's a good old pal, the First Mate  is.\"    \"I should have expected you to have a dog,\" said Gilbert.    Captain Jim shook his head.    \"I had a dog once.  I thought so much of him that when he died I  couldn't bear the thought of getting another in his place.  He was a  FRIEND--you understand, Mistress Blythe?  Matey's only a pal.  I'm fond  of Matey--all the fonder on account of the spice of devilment that's in  him--like there is in all cats.  But I LOVED my dog.  I always had a  sneaking sympathy for Alexander Elliott about HIS dog.  There isn't any  devil in a good dog.  That's why they're more lovable than cats, I  reckon.  But I'm darned if they're as interesting.  Here I am, talking  too much.  Why don't you check me?  When I do get a chance to talk to  anyone I run on turrible.  If you've done your tea I've a few little  things you might like to look at--picked 'em up in the queer corners I  used to be poking my nose into.\"    Captain Jim's \"few little things\" turned out to be a most interesting  collection of curios, hideous, quaint and beautiful.  And almost every  one had some striking story attached to it.    Anne never forgot the delight with which she listened to those old  tales that moonlit evening by that enchanted driftwood fire, while the  silver sea called to them through the open window and sobbed against  the rocks below them.    Captain Jim never said a boastful word, but it was impossible to help  seeing what a hero the man had been--brave, true, resourceful,  unselfish.  He sat there in his little room and made those things live  again for his hearers.  By a lift of the eyebrow, a twist of the lip, a  gesture, a word, he painted a whole scene or character so that they saw  it as it was.    Some of Captain Jim's adventures had such a marvellous edge that Anne  and Gilbert secretly wondered if he were not drawing a rather long bow  at their credulous expense.  But in this, as they found later, they did  him injustice.  His tales were all literally true.  Captain Jim had the  gift of the born storyteller, whereby \"unhappy, far-off things\" can be  brought vividly before the hearer in all their pristine poignancy.    Anne and Gilbert laughed and shivered over his tales, and once Anne  found herself crying.  Captain Jim surveyed her tears with pleasure  shining from his face.    \"I like to see folks cry that way,\" he remarked.  \"It's a compliment.  But I can't do justice to the things I've seen or helped to do.  I've  'em all jotted down in my life-book, but I haven't got the knack of  writing them out properly.  If I could hit on jest the right words and  string 'em together proper on paper I could"]]]
