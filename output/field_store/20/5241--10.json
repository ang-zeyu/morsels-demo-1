Nearly abreast of  the vessel was a creek which Colonel Paterson and I penetrated for a  considerable way. On its banks we found part of a net made of strong  grass, apparently the work of a European. We likewise found marks of  fires having been lighted there, and in the stream the remains of a weir,  the work of the native inhabitants...We concluded the net had belonged to  the unfortunate men who ran away with the Norfolk...On examining Ash  Island we found many large timber trees intermixed with ash, one of which  I took on board...it has much the likeness of hickory. I found several  other woods, some of them light and pretty, and in particular a tree, the  leaves of which sting like nettles. This acquired from us the name of  Nettle Tree.\"    The native, Budgeree Dick, now reappeared after 48 hours' absence, with  two companions. One had been at Sydney and was known to Colonel Paterson,  with whom he was able to converse. Fires and occasionally the natives  themselves were observed opposite to Ash Island. A party from the ship  went up an arm of the river in order to try and meet with them, but were  disappointed, as at the entrance there was barely water for the boat. The  opposite (or north) shore to which they now proceeded was found to be  full of flats and shoals over many of which the boat had to be dragged.  Between these flats were gullies of deep water, but there was no regular  channel. Here the trees were encrusted with oysters, and the shore  covered to a great depth with oyster shells. The work was vigorously  pushed forward. Some woodmen were placed on Ash Island to fell and saw  timber. They took a week's provisions, arms, and ammunition, and were  warned to guard against an attack by the crew of the Norfolk or by the  natives. Meanwhile the commander and Paterson visited the coal mine and  found veins of coal of excellent quality, and among the rocks what is  known as \"liver of iron.\" They also saw strange birds, as well as the  wild or native cat, which has been such a pest ever since in most parts  of Australia.    On June 22nd Colonel Paterson took some men, one of whom was a miner, to  look for coal on the island, while Grant and Barrallier with Dr. Harris  sounded the entrance of the harbour. The coal found on the island proved  to be of an inferior kind. On his way back to the ship, Lieutenant Grant  met a stranger named John Loft, who had been wrecked out of a boat  belonging to Mr. Underwood of Sydney. She was cast on shore to the  northward of Port Stephens, and he had been thirty-two days in travelling  to this place from there. He had had two companions, one of whom, he  said, was killed by the natives, the other had eaten a toad fish and  died. The emotions that he felt on meeting his countrymen can be better  imagined than described. \"The laugh and the tear had their repeated place  in turns, and his first utterance was, 'I am starving with hunger.'\"    On the 23rd Mr. Barrallier and the second mate met a native in the woods  whom they brought on board. \"He was a little elderly man, strait made,  and spoke not one syllable that was intelligible.\" His legs and arms bore  no proportion in length to the rest of his body, and his manner of  ascending the ship's ladder was remarkable and proved that he was much  accustomed to climbing. His method was \"to stretch out his arms as far as  he could reach and then bring his feet to the same place with a jerk.\"  Grant says: \"He spoke a jargon of simple sounds as I particularly  observed only a few words that came from him were composed of more than  one syllable. He could eat nothing; but upon two crows, which some of the  people had shot, being given him, he stuffed them in the fire feathers  and all which after burning off and heating them a little he ate...The  Colonel gave him a tomahawk which he seemed pleased with and showed that  he understood the use of it. He was put on shore near the place where  they met him...He was quite naked and had no ornament through the  cartilage of his nose. Colonel Paterson declared that he had never met a  native who differed so widely from the rest of the New Hollanders.\"  Before he disappeared he gave the boat's crew an exhibition of his  climbing powers, for they pointed to a tree, making signs that they  wished to see him climb it. This he quickly did, first cutting a notch  with the axe and continuing thus to make footholds until he nimbly  reached the top--the tree being without branches to a height of 40 feet.  About this time there appeared a small party of woodmen who had been sent  to cut cedar for Mr. Palmer. These men had intended returning to Sydney,  having run short of provisions, but seeing the Lady Nelson they joined  her.    On June 28 the Lady Nelson advanced up the river and moored in one of its  branches about 6 miles from the entrance, Mr. Barrallier surveying while  Colonel Paterson with Dr. Harris and Mr. Lewin (the artist who had joined  the Lady Nelson after the sailing of the Francis) went in the launch to  examine the river and inspect the country.    On the 7th the Commander himself in company with Mr. Barrallier set off  to join Paterson. They found the country level and swampy near the river,  but with delightful views in the distance. \"The river took a serpentine  course, and for many miles appeared to be as broad as the Thames at  Kingston. From the marks on the trees it would seem that it is subject to  be greatly overflowed at times. The cedar (or rather the mahogany of New  Holland) appeared to have been immersed in water to the height of 50 or  60 feet. On our way up we landed at a small creek which we traced for a  considerable distance coming to a gradual ascent covered with the most  luxuriant grass. There was an extensive view from this height of a fine  champain country. I named the eminence Mount Egerton after a seat  belonging to the Duke of Bridgewater. In the evening we found by the  sound of the bugle that we had reached the Colonel's headquarters. We  answered the welcome signal and before it was quite dark we joined them.    \"The Colonel had erected a comfortable hut. The cedar grew here in great  plenty, and Mr. Palmer's party sawed many fine planks from these trees.  Colonel Paterson, Dr. Harris, Mr. Barrallier and myself penetrated 30  miles farther up the river in the course of which we met with many rapids  which obliged us to get out and drag the boats up. We had hitherto seen  none of the natives, but discovered places where they had been by the  marks of their fires. We now descried some of them at a distance, who  fled on our approach. We came to a spot which they had just quitted and  observed the marks of children's feet. The ground was covered with  freshwater shells of the sort found in the rivers of England and Scotland  and called the horse mussel, having sometimes small pearls in them.    \"We ascended two heights which commanded views of the country for several  miles on every side. To one, Colonel Paterson gave the name of Ann's  Mountain after Mrs. King, the other he called Elizabeth's Mountain, that  being the Christian name of Mrs. Paterson. We now found that we had got  behind the range of mountains extending along the coast to the south and  west. We likewise saw the coast of Port Stephens and the chain of hills  inland stretching in a direction towards the north-east. Between us and  the hills was a space perfectly level for many miles, and to appearance  swampy. The land on the south side of the river was interspersed with  lagoons on which we killed some ducks but found them very shy. The  country seemed not to be destitute of inhabitants, some of whom we  descried at a distance. The river here meandered so greatly that to have  pursued its course the boats must have been pulled a whole day to have  gained a direct distance of four or five miles from our present station.    \"The time limited for our departure for Sydney approaching very fast and  the survey still to be made not being less than 70 miles up the river, it  was judged prudent not to proceed any further. Passing the night upon the  banks of the river we descended it the next day to our former rendezvous,  Schanck Forest, Pasture Plains, where preparations were made for a  general embarkation.    \"The next morning I left Colonel Paterson in company of Mr. Barrallier,  who then proceeded on the survey of the river. On our passage down it, we  saw several natives with their canoes...In many of them we saw fires, and  in some of them observed that kind of eatable to which they give the name  of cabra.* (* Teredo.) It appears to be abominably filthy; however, when  dressed, it is not disagreeable to the taste. The cabra is a species of  worm which breeds in the wood that happens to be immersed in water, and  are found in such parts of the river wherein trees have fallen. They grow  to a great size and soon reduce timber to the appearance of a honeycomb.  They are of a glutinous substance, and after being put on the fire harden  to the consistence of the spinal marrow of animals. When fire is not at  hand, the natives eat them raw; some of them being found at a fire near  one of the canoes, I tasted them on the recommendation of one of my men  and found them not unpalatable...    \"We saw several natives at a small distance; one of them looked earnestly  at us and seemed to be waiting our approach. One of my men called to him  in his own language to stop, but at length he got behind a tree whence he  presented only his head and shoulders, brandishing a fish-gig in his  hand. He waited our landing, and seeing we were unarmed threw down his  muton (so they named the fish-gig) and came readily to us. For what  reason I know not (for we appeared without any marks of distinction) he  addressed himself first to me,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7524"],[0,"The Germany and the Agricola of Tacitus (#12)"],[1,"in the night upon the ninth legion,  which was the weakest, [106] in the confusion of sleep and consternation  they slaughtered the sentinels, and burst through the intrenchments.  They were now fighting within the camp, when Agricola, who had received  information of their march from his scouts, and followed close upon  their track, gave orders for the swiftest of his horse and foot to  charge the enemy's rear. Presently the whole army raised a general  shout; and the standards now glittered at the approach of day. The  Britons were distracted by opposite dangers; whilst the Romans in the  camp resumed their courage, and secure of safety, began to contend for  glory. They now in their turns rushed forwards to the attack, and a  furious engagement ensued in the gates of the camp; till by the emulous  efforts of both Roman armies, one to give assistance, the other to  appear not to need it, the enemy was routed: and had not the woods and  marshes sheltered the fugitives, that day would have terminated the war.    27. The soldiers, inspirited by the steadfastness which characterized  and the fame which attended this victory, cried out that \"nothing could  resist their valor; now was the time to penetrate into the heart  of Caledonia, and in a continued series of engagements at length to  discover the utmost limits of Britain.\" Those even who had before  recommended caution and prudence, were now rendered rash and boastful by  success. It is the hard condition of military command, that a share in  prosperous events is claimed by all, but misfortunes are imputed to  one alone. The Britons meantime, attributing their defeat not to the  superior bravery of their adversaries, but to chance, and the skill of  the general, remitted nothing of their confidence; but proceeded to arm  their youth, to send their wives and children to places of safety, and  to ratify the confederacy of their several states by solemn assemblies  and sacrifices. Thus the parties separated with minds mutually  irritated.    28. During the same summer, a cohort of Usipii, [107] which had been  levied in Germany, and sent over into Britain, performed an extremely  daring and memorable action. After murdering a centurion and some  soldiers who had been incorporated with them for the purpose of  instructing them in military discipline, they seized upon three light  vessels, and compelled the masters to go on board with them. One of  these, however, escaping to shore, they killed the other two upon  suspicion; and before the affair was publicly known, they sailed away,  as it were by miracle. They were presently driven at the mercy of  the waves; and had frequent conflicts, with various success, with the  Britons, defending their property from plunder. [108] At length they  were reduced to such extremity of distress as to be obliged to feed upon  each other; the weakest being first sacrificed, and then such as were  taken by lot. In this manner having sailed round the island, they lost  their ships through want of skill; and, being regarded as pirates, were  intercepted, first by the Suevi, then by the Frisii. Some of them, after  being sold for slaves, by the change of masters were brought to the  Roman side of the river, [109] and became notorious from the relation of  their extraordinary adventures. [110]    29. In the beginning of the next summer, [111] Agricola received a  severe domestic wound in the loss of a son, about a year old. He bore  this calamity, not with the ostentatious firmness which many have  affected, nor yet with the tears and lamentations of feminine sorrow;  and war was one of the remedies of his grief. Having sent forwards his  fleet to spread its ravages through various parts of the coast, in  order to excite an extensive and dubious alarm, he marched with an  army equipped for expedition, to which he had joined the bravest of  the Britons whose fidelity had been approved by a long allegiance, and  arrived at the Grampian hills, where the enemy was already encamped.  [112] For the Britons, undismayed by the event of the former action,  expecting revenge or slavery, and at length taught that the common  danger was to be repelled by union alone, had assembled the strength  of all their tribes by embassies and confederacies. Upwards of thirty  thousand men in arms were now descried; and the youth, together with  those of a hale and vigorous age, renowned in war, and bearing their  several honorary decorations, were still flocking in; when Calgacus,  [113] the most distinguished for birth and valor among the chieftans,  is said to have harangued the multitude, gathering round, and eager for  battle, after the following manner:--    30. \"When I reflect on the causes of the war, and the circumstances of  our situation, I feel a strong persuasion that our united efforts on the  present day will prove the beginning of universal liberty to Britain.  For we are all undebased by slavery; and there is no land behind us, nor  does even the sea afford a refuge, whilst the Roman fleet hovers around.  Thus the use of arms, which is at all times honorable to the brave, now  offers the only safety even to cowards. In all the battles which  have yet been fought, with various success, against the Romans, our  countrymen may be deemed to have reposed their final hopes and resources  in us: for we, the noblest sons of Britain, and therefore stationed in  its last recesses, far from the view of servile shores, have preserved  even our eyes unpolluted by the contact of subjection. We, at the  furthest limits both of land and liberty, have been defended to this  day by the remoteness of our situation and of our fame. The extremity of  Britain is now disclosed; and whatever is unknown becomes an object  of magnitude. But there is no nation beyond us; nothing but waves and  rocks, and the still more hostile Romans, whose arrogance we cannot  escape by obsequiousness and submission. These plunderers of the world,  after exhausting the land by their devastations, are rifling the ocean:  stimulated by avarice, if their enemy be rich; by ambition, if poor;  unsatiated by the East and by the West: the only people who behold  wealth and indigence with equal avidity. To ravage, to slaughter,  to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a  desert, they call it peace. [114]    31. \"Our children and relations are by the appointment of nature the  dearest of all things to us. These are torn away by levies to serve in  foreign lands. [115] Our wives and sisters, though they should escape  the violation of hostile force, are polluted under names of friendship  and hospitality. Our estates and possessions are consumed in tributes;  our grain in contributions. Even our bodies are worn down amidst stripes  and insults in clearing woods and draining marshes. Wretches born to  slavery are once bought, and afterwards maintained by their masters:  Britain every day buys, every day feeds, her own servitude. [116] And as  among domestic slaves every new comer serves for the scorn and derision  of his fellows; so, in this ancient household of the world, we, as the  newest and vilest, are sought out to destruction. For we have neither  cultivated lands, nor mines, nor harbors, which can induce them to  preserve us for our labors. The valor too and unsubmitting spirit  of subjects only render them more obnoxious to their masters; while  remoteness and secrecy of situation itself, in proportion as it conduces  to security, tends to inspire suspicion. Since then all Lopes of mercy  are vain, at length assume courage, both you to whom safety and you to  whom glory is dear. The Trinobantes, even under a female leader, had  force enough to burn a colony, to storm camps, and, if success had not  damped their vigor, would have been able entirely to throw off the  yoke; and shall not we, untouched, unsubdued, and struggling not for the  acquisition but the security of liberty, show at the very first onset  what men Caledonia has reserved for her defence?    32. \"Can you imagine that the Romans are as brave in war as they are  licentious in peace? Acquiring renown from our discords and dissensions,  they convert the faults of their enemies to the glory of their own army;  an army compounded of the most different nations, which success alone  has kept together, and which misfortune will as certainly dissipate.  Unless, indeed, you can suppose that Gauls, and Germans, and (I blush to  say it) even Britons, who, though they expend their blood to establish  a foreign dominion, have been longer its foes than its subjects, will be  retained by loyalty and affection! Terror and dread alone are the weak  bonds of attachment; which once broken, they who cease to fear will  begin to hate. Every incitement to victory is on our side. The Romans  have no wives to animate them; no parents to upbraid their flight. Most  of them have either no home, or a distant one. Few in number, ignorant  of the country, looking around in silent horror at woods, seas, and a  heaven itself unknown to them, they are delivered by the gods, as it  were imprisoned and bound, into our hands. Be not terrified with an idle  show, and the glitter of silver and gold, which can neither protect nor  wound. In the very ranks of the enemy we shall find our own bands. The  Britons will acknowledge their own cause. The Gauls will recollect their  former liberty. The rest of the Germans will desert them, as the  Usipii have lately done. Nor is there anything formidable behind them:  ungarrisoned forts; colonies of old men; municipal towns distempered and  distracted between unjust masters and ill-obeying subjects. Here is  a general; here an army. There, tributes, mines, and all the train of  punishments inflicted on slaves; which whether to bear eternally, or  instantly to revenge, this field must determine. March then to battle,  and think of your ancestors and your posterity.\"    33. They"]]]
