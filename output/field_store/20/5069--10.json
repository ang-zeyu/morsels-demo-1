Fremont also left California with General Kearney, and with him  departed all cause of confusion and disorder in the country.  From  that time forth no one could dispute the authority of Colonel Mason  as in command of all the United States forces on shore, while the  senior naval officer had a like control afloat.  This was Commodore  James Biddle, who had reached the station from China in the  Columbus, and he in turn was succeeded by Commodore T. Ap Catesby  Jones in the line-of-battle-ship Ohio.  At that time Monterey was  our headquarters, and the naval commander for a time remained  there, but subsequently San Francisco Bay became the chief naval  rendezvous.    Colonel R. B. Mason, First Dragoons, was an officer of great  experience, of stern character, deemed by some harsh and severe,  but in all my intercourse with him he was kind and agreeable.  He  had a large fund of good sense, and, during our long period of  service together, I enjoyed his unlimited confidence.  He had been  in his day a splendid shot and hunter, and often entertained me  with characteristic anecdotes of Taylor, Twiggs, Worth, Harvey,  Martin Scott, etc., etc, who were then in Mexico, gaining a  national fame.  California had settled down to a condition of  absolute repose, and we naturally repined at our fate in being  so remote from the war in Mexico, where our comrades were  reaping large honors.  Mason dwelt in a house not far from the  Custom-House, with Captain Lanman, United States Navy; I had a small  adobe-house back of Larkin's.  Halleck and Dr. Murray had a small  log-house not far off.  The company of artillery was still on the  hill, under the command of Lieutenant Ord, engaged in building a  fort whereon to mount the guns we had brought out in the Lexington,  and also in constructing quarters out of hewn pine-logs for the men.  Lieutenant Minor, a very clever young officer, had taken violently  sick and died about the time I got back from Los Angeles, leaving  Lieutenants Ord and Loeser alone with the company, with  Assistant-Surgeon Robert Murray.  Captain William G. Marcy was the  quartermaster and commissary.  Naglee's company of Stevenson's  regiment had been mounted and was sent out against the Indians in  the San Joaquin Valley, and Shannon's company occupied the barracks.  Shortly after General Kearney had gone East, we found an order of  his on record, removing one Mr. Nash, the Alcalde of Sonoma, and  appointing to his place ex-Governor L. W. Boggs.  A letter came to  Colonel and Governor Mason from Boggs, whom he had personally known  in Missouri, complaining that, though he had been appointed alcalde,  the then incumbent (Nash) utterly denied Kearney's right to remove  him, because he had been elected by the people under the  proclamation of Commodore Sloat, and refused to surrender his office  or to account for his acts as alcalde.  Such a proclamation had been  made by Commodore Sloat shortly after the first occupation of  California, announcing that the people were free and enlightened  American citizens, entitled to all the rights and privileges as  such, and among them the right to elect their own officers, etc.  The people of Sonoma town and valley, some forty or fifty immigrants  from the United States, and very few native Californians, had  elected Mr. Nash, and, as stated, he refused to recognize the right  of a mere military commander to eject him and to appoint another to  his place.  Neither General Kearney nor Mason had much respect for  this land of \"buncombe,\" but assumed the true doctrine that  California was yet a Mexican province, held by right of conquest,  that the military commander was held responsible to the country, and  that the province should be held in statu quo until a treaty of  peace.  This letter of Boggs was therefore referred to Captain  Brackett, whose company was stationed at Sonoma, with orders to  notify Nash that Boggs was the rightful alcalde; that he must  quietly surrender his office, with the books and records thereof,  and that he must account for any moneys received from the sale of  town-lots, etc., etc.; and in the event of refusal he (Captain  Brackett) must compel him by the use of force.  In due time we got  Brackett's answer, saying that the little community of Sonoma was in  a dangerous state of effervescence caused by his orders; that Nash  was backed by most of the Americans there who had come across from  Missouri with American ideas; that as he (Brackett) was a volunteer  officer, likely to be soon discharged, and as he designed to settle  there, he asked in consequence to be excused from the execution of  this (to him) unpleasant duty.  Such a request, coming to an old  soldier like Colonel Mason, aroused his wrath, and he would have  proceeded rough-shod against Brackett, who, by-the-way, was a West  Point graduate, and ought to have known better; but I suggested to  the colonel that, the case being a test one, he had better send me  up to Sonoma, and I would settle it quick enough.  He then gave me  an order to go to Sonoma to carry out the instructions already given  to Brackett.    I took one soldier with me, Private Barnes, with four horses, two  of which we rode, and the other two we drove ahead.  The first day  we reached Gilroy's and camped by a stream near three or four  adobe-huts known as Gilroy's ranch.  The next day we passed  Murphy's, San Jose, and Santa Clara Mission, camping some four  miles beyond, where a kind of hole had been dug in the ground for  water.  The whole of this distance, now so beautifully improved and  settled, was then scarcely occupied, except by poor ranches  producing horses and cattle.  The pueblo of San Jose was a string  of low adobe-houses festooned with red peppers and garlic; and the  Mission of Santa Clara was a dilapidated concern, with its church  and orchard.  The long line of poplar-trees lining the road from  San Jose to Santa Clara bespoke a former period when the priests  had ruled the land.  Just about dark I was lying on the ground near  the well, and my soldier Barnes had watered our horses and picketed  them to grass, when we heard a horse crushing his way through the  high mustard-bushes which filled the plain, and soon a man came to  us to inquire if we had seen a saddle-horse pass up the road.  We  explained to him what we had heard, and he went off in pursuit of  his horse.  Before dark he came back unsuccessful, and gave his  name as Bidwell, the same gentleman who has since been a member of  Congress, who is married to Miss Kennedy, of Washington City, and  now lives in princely style at Chico, California.    He explained that he was a surveyor, and had been in the lower  country engaged in surveying land; that the horse had escaped him  with his saddle-bags containing all his notes and papers, and some  six hundred dollars in money, all the money he had earned.  He  spent the night with us on the ground, and the next morning we left  him there to continue the search for his horse, and I afterward  heard that he had found his saddle-bags all right, but never  recovered the horse.  The next day toward night we approached the  Mission of San Francisco, and the village of Yerba Buena, tired and  weary--the wind as usual blowing a perfect hurricane, and a more  desolate region it was impossible to conceive of.  Leaving Barnes  to work his way into the town as best he could with the tired  animals, I took the freshest horse and rode forward.  I fell in  with Lieutenant Fabius Stanley, United States Navy, and we rode  into Yerba Buena together about an hour before sundown, there being  nothing but a path from the Mission into the town, deep and heavy  with drift-sand.  My horse could hardly drag one foot after the  other when we reached the old Hudson Bay Company's house, which was  then the store of Howard and Mellus.  There I learned where Captain  Folsom, the quartermaster, was to be found.  He was staying with a  family of the name of Grimes, who had a small horse back of  Howard's store, which must have been near where Sacramento Street  now crosses Kearney.  Folsom was a classmate of mine, had come out  with Stevenson's regiment as quartermaster, and was at the time the  chief-quartermaster of the department.  His office was in the old  custom-horse standing at the northwest corner of the Plaza.  He had  hired two warehouses, the only ones there at the time, of one  Liedsdorff, the principal man of Yerba Buena, who also owned the  only public-house, or tavern, called the City Hotel, on Kearney  Street, at the southeast corner of the Plaza.  I stopped with  Folsom at Mrs. Grimes's, and he sent my horse, as also the other  three when Barnes had got in after dark, to a coral where he had a  little barley, but no hay.  At that time nobody fed a horse, but he  was usually turned out to pick such scanty grass as he could find  on the side-hills.  The few government horses used in town were  usually sent out to the Presidio, where the grass was somewhat  better.  At that time (July, 1847), what is now called San  Francisco was called Yerba Buena.  A naval officer, Lieutenant  Washington A. Bartlett, its first alcalde, had caused it to be  surveyed and laid out into blocks and lots, which were being sold  at sixteen dollars a lot of fifty vuras square; the understanding  being that no single person could purchase of the alcalde more than  one in-lot of fifty varas, and one out-lot of a hundred varas.  Folsom, however, had got his clerks, orderlies, etc., to buy lots,  and they, for a small consideration, conveyed them to him, so that  he was nominally the owner of a good many lots.  Lieutenant Halleck  had bought one of each kind, and so had Warner.  Many naval  officers had also invested, and Captain Folsom advised me to buy  some, but I felt actually insulted that he should think me such a  fool as to pay money for property in such a horrid place as Yerba"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4362"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of P. H. Sheridan, General, United States Army — Complete (#12)"],[1,"renegades who were captured  at the Cascades.  My detachment did not accompany Colonel Wright, but  remained for some time at the Cascades, and while still there General  Wool came up from San Francisco to take a look into the condition of  things.  From his conversation with me in reference to the affair at  the Cascades, I gathered that he was greatly pleased at the service I  had performed, and I afterward found that his report of my conduct  had so favorably impressed General Scott that that distinguished  officer complimented me from the headquarters of the army in general  orders.    General Wool, while personally supervising matters on the Columbia  River, directed a redistribution to some extent of the troops in the  district, and shortly before his return to San Francisco I was  ordered with my detachment of dragoons to take station on the Grande  Ronde Indian Reservation in Yamhill County, Oregon, about twenty-five  miles southwest of Dayton, and to relieve from duty at that point  Lieutenant William B. Hazen--late brigadier-general and chief signal  officer--who had established a camp there some time before.  I  started for my new station on April 21, and marching by way of  Portland and Oregon City, arrived at Hazen's camp April 25.  The camp  was located in the Coast range of mountains, on the northeast part of  the reservation, to which last had been added a section of country  that was afterward known as the Siletz reservation.  The whole body  of land set aside went under the general name of the \"Coast  reservation,\" from its skirting the Pacific Ocean for some distance  north of Yaquina Bay, and the intention was to establish within its  bounds permanent homes for such Indians as might be removed to it.  In furtherance of this idea, and to relieve northern California and  southwestern Oregon from the roaming, restless bands that kept the  people of those sections in a state of constant turmoil, many of the  different tribes, still under control but liable to take part in  warfare, were removed to the reservation, so that they might be away  from the theatre of hostilities.    When I arrived I found that the Rogue River Indians had just been  placed upon the reservation, and subsequently the Coquille, Klamath,  Modocs, and remnants of the Chinooks were collected there also, the  home of the latter being in the Willamette Valley.  The number all  told amounted to some thousands, scattered over the entire Coast  reservation, but about fifteen hundred were located at the Grande  Ronde under charge of an agent, Mr. John F. Miller, a sensible,  practical man, who left the entire police control to the military,  and attended faithfully to the duty of settling the Indians in the  work of cultivating the soil.    As the place was to be occupied permanently, Lieutenant Hazen had  begun, before my arrival, the erection of buildings for the shelter  of his command, and I continued the work of constructing the post as  laid out by him.  In those days the Government did not provide very  liberally for sheltering its soldiers; and officers and men were  frequently forced to eke out parsimonious appropriations by toilsome  work or go without shelter in most inhospitable regions.  Of course  this post was no exception to the general rule, and as all hands were  occupied in its construction, and I the only officer present, I was  kept busily employed in supervising matters, both as commandant and  quartermaster, until July, when Captain D. A. Russell, of the Fourth  Infantry, was ordered to take command, and I was relieved from the  first part of my duties.    About this time my little detachment parted from me, being ordered to  join a company of the First Dragoons, commanded by Captain Robert  Williams, as it passed up the country from California by way of  Yamhill.  I regretted exceedingly to see them go, for their faithful  work and gallant service had endeared every man to me by the  strongest ties.  Since I relieved Lieutenant Hood on Pit River,  nearly a twelvemonth before, they had been my constant companions,  and the zeal with which they had responded to every call I made on  them had inspired in my heart a deep affection that years have not  removed.  When I relieved Hood--a dragoon officer of their own  regiment--they did not like the change, and I understood that they  somewhat contemptuously expressed this in more ways than one, in  order to try the temper of the new \"Leftenant,\" but appreciative and  unremitting care, together with firm and just discipline, soon  quieted all symptoms of dissatisfaction and overcame all prejudice.  The detachment had been made up of details from the different  companies of the regiment in order to give Williamson a mounted  force, and as it was usual, under such circumstances, for every  company commander to shove into the detail he was called upon to  furnish the most troublesome and insubordinate individuals of his  company, I had some difficulty, when first taking command, in  controlling such a medley of recalcitrants; but by forethought for  them and their wants, and a strict watchfulness for their rights and  comfort, I was able in a short time to make them obedient and the  detachment cohesive.  In the past year they had made long and  tiresome marches, forded swift mountain streams, constructed rafts of  logs or bundles of dry reeds to ferry our baggage, swum deep rivers,  marched on foot to save their worn-out and exhausted animals, climbed  mountains, fought Indians, and in all and everything had done the  best they could for the service and their commander.  The disaffected  feeling they entertained when I first assumed command soon wore away,  and in its place came a confidence and respect which it gives me the  greatest pleasure to remember, for small though it was, this was my  first cavalry command.  They little thought, when we were in the  mountains of California and Oregon--nor did I myself then dream--that  but a few years were to elapse before it would be my lot again to  command dragoons, this time in numbers so vast as of themselves to  compose almost an army.    Shortly after the arrival of Captain Russell a portion of the Indians  at the Grande Ronde reservation were taken down the coast to the  Siletz reservation, and I was transferred temporarily to Fort  Haskins, on the latter reserve, and assigned to the duty of  completing it and building a blockhouse for the police control of the  Indians placed there.    While directing this work, I undertook to make a road across the  coast mountains from King's Valley to the Siletz, to shorten the haul  between the two points by a route I had explored.  I knew there were  many obstacles in the way, but the gain would be great if we could  overcome them, so I set to work with the enthusiasm of a young  path-finder.  The point at which the road was to cross the range was  rough and precipitous, but the principal difficulty in making it would  be from heavy timber on the mountains that had been burned over years  and years before, until nothing was left but limbless trunks of dead  trees--firs and pines--that had fallen from time to time until the  ground was matted with huge logs from five to eight feet in diameter.  These could not be chopped with axes nor sawed by any ordinary means,  therefore we had to burn them into suitable lengths, and drag the  sections to either side of the roadway with from four to six yoke of  oxen.    The work was both tedious and laborious, but in time perseverance  surmounted all obstacles and the road was finished, though its grades  were very steep.  As soon as it was completed, I wished to  demonstrate its value practically, so I started a Government wagon  over it loaded with about fifteen hundred pounds of freight drawn by  six yoke of oxen, and escorted by a small detachment of soldiers.  When it had gone about seven miles the sergeant in charge came back  to the post and reported his inability to get any further.  Going out  to the scene of difficulty I found the wagon at the base of a steep  hill, stalled.  Taking up a whip myself, I directed the men to lay on  their gads, for each man had supplied himself with a flexible hickory  withe in the early stages of the trip, to start the team, but this  course did not move the wagon nor have much effect on the demoralized  oxen; but following as a last resort an example I heard of on a  former occasion, that brought into use the rough language of the  country, I induced the oxen to move with alacrity, and the wagon and  contents were speedily carried to the summit.  The whole trouble was  at once revealed: the oxen had been broken and trained by a man who,  when they were in a pinch, had encouraged them by his frontier  vocabulary, and they could not realize what was expected of them  under extraordinary conditions until they heard familiar and possibly  profanely urgent phrases.  I took the wagon to its destination, but  as it was not brought back, even in all the time I was stationed in  that country, I think comment on the success of my road is  unnecessary.    I spent many happy months at Fort Haskins, remaining there until the  post was nearly completed and its garrison increased by the arrival  of Captain F. T. Dent--a brother-in-law of Captain Ulysses S. Grant  --with his company of the Fourth Infantry, in April, 1857.  In the  summer of 1856, and while I was still on duty there, the Coquille  Indians on the Siletz, and down near the Yaquina Bay, became, on  account of hunger and prospective starvation, very much excited and  exasperated, getting beyond the control of their agent, and even  threatening his life, so a detachment of troops was sent out to set  things to rights, and I took command of it.  I took with me most of  the company, and arrived at Yaquina Bay in time to succor the agent,  who for some days had been besieged in a log hut by the Indians and  had almost abandoned hope of rescue."]]]
