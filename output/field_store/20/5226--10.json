'It is thence,' said he,  'that I derive the beauty which surprises you. My dwelling is there; a  still finer one is prepared for you, and you shall soon come to inhabit  it. Farewell! we shall meet again to-morrow.' With these words Engelram  returned to heaven. Anselme, struck by the vision, sent the next  morning for the priests, received the sacrament; and although full of  health, took a last farewell of all his friends, telling them that he  was about to leave this world. A few hours afterwards, the enemy having  made a sortie, Anselme went out against them sword in hand, and was  struck on the forehead by a stone from a Turkish sling, which sent him  to heaven, to the beautiful palace that was prepared for him.\"    New disputes arose between the Prince of Antioch and the Count of  Toulouse with regard to the capture of this town, which were with the  utmost difficulty appeased by the other chiefs. Delays also took place  in the progress of the army, especially before Arches, and the soldiery  were so exasperated that they were on the point of choosing new leaders  to conduct them to Jerusalem. Godfrey, upon this, set fire to his camp  at Arches, and marched forward. He was immediately joined by hundreds  of the Provencals of the Count of Toulouse. The latter, seeing the turn  affairs were taking, hastened after them, and the whole host proceeded  towards the holy city, so long desired amid sorrow, and suffering, and  danger. At Emmaus they were met by a deputation from the Christians of  Bethlehem, praying for immediate aid against the oppression of the  infidels. The very name of Bethlehem, the birthplace of the Saviour,  was music to their ears, and many of them wept with joy to think they  were approaching a spot so hallowed.  Albert of Aix informs us that  their hearts were so touched that sleep was banished from the camp, and  that, instead of waiting till the morning's dawn to recommence their  march, they set out shortly after midnight, full of hope and  enthusiasm. For upwards of four hours the mail-clad legions tramped  steadfastly forward in the dark, and when the sun arose in unclouded  splendour, the towers and pinnacles of Jerusalem gleamed upon their  sight. All the tender feelings of their nature were touched; no longer  brutal fanatics, but meek and humble pilgrims, they knelt down upon the  sod, and with tears in their eyes, exclaimed to one another,  \"Jerusalem! Jerusalem!\" Some of them kissed the holy ground, others  stretched themselves at full length upon it, in order that their bodies  might come in contact with the greatest possible extent of it, and  others prayed aloud. The women and children who had followed the camp  from Europe, and shared in all its dangers, fatigues, and privations,  were more boisterous in their joy; the former from long-nourished  enthusiasm, and the latter from mere imitation, [Guibert de Nogent  relates a curious instance of the imitativeness of these juvenile  crusaders. He says that, during the siege of Antioch, the Christian and  Saracen boys used to issue forth every evening from the town and camp  in great numbers under the command of captains chosen from among  themselves. Armed with sticks instead of swords, and stones instead of  arrows, they ranged themselves in battle order, and shouting each the  war-cry of their country, fought with the utmost desperation. Some of  them lost their eyes, and many became cripples for life from the  injuries they received on these occasions.] and prayed, and wept, and  laughed till they almost put the more sober to the blush.    The first ebullition of their gladness having subsided, the army  marched forward, and invested the city on all sides. The assault was  almost immediately begun; but after the Christians had lost some of  their bravest knights, that mode of attack was abandoned, and the army  commenced its preparations for a regular siege. Mangonels, moveable  towers, and battering rams, together with a machine called a sow, made  of wood, and covered with raw hides, inside of which miners worked to  undermine the walls, were forthwith constructed; and to restore the  courage and discipline of the army, which had suffered from the  unworthy dissensions of the chiefs, the latter held out the hand of  friendship to each other, and Tancred and the Count of Toulouse  embraced in sight of the whole camp. The clergy aided the cause with  their powerful voice, and preached union and goodwill to the highest  and the lowest. A solemn procession was also ordered round the city, in  which the entire army joined, prayers being offered up at every spot  which gospel records had taught them to consider as peculiarly sacred.    The Saracens upon the ramparts beheld all these manifestations without  alarm. To incense the Christians, whom they despised, they constructed  rude crosses, and fixed them upon the walls, and spat upon and pelted  them with dirt and stones. This insult to the symbol of their faith  raised the wrath of the crusaders to that height that bravery became  ferocity and enthusiasm madness. When all the engines of war were  completed the attack was recommenced, and every soldier of the  Christian army fought with a vigour which the sense of private wrong  invariably inspires. Every man had been personally outraged, and the  knights worked at the battering-rams with as much readiness as the  meanest soldiers. The Saracen arrows and balls of fire fell thick and  fast among them, but the tremendous rams still heaved against the  walls, while the best marksmen of the host were busily employed in the  several floors of the moveable towers in dealing death among the Turks  upon the battlements. Godfrey, Raymond, Tancred, and Robert of  Normandy, each upon his tower, fought for hours with unwearied energy,  often repulsed, but ever ready to renew the struggle. The Turks, no  longer despising the enemy, defended themselves with the utmost skill  and bravery till darkness brought a cessation of hostilities. Short was  the sleep that night in the Christian camp. The priests offered up  solemn prayers in the midst of the attentive soldiery for the triumph  of the Cross in this last great struggle, and as soon as morning dawned  every one was in readiness for the affray. The women and children lent  their aid, the latter running unconcerned to and fro while the arrows  fell fast around them, bearing water to the thirsty combatants. The  saints were believed to be aiding their efforts, and the army,  impressed with this idea, surmounted difficulties under which a force  thrice as numerous, but without their faith, would have quailed and  been defeated. Raymond of Toulouse at last forced his way into the city  by escalade, while at the very same moment Tancred and Robert of  Normandy succeeded in bursting open one of the gates. The Turks flew to  repair the mischief, and Godfrey of Bouillon, seeing the battlements  comparatively deserted, let down the drawbridge of his moveable tower,  and sprang forward, followed by all the knights of his train. In an  instant after, the banner of the Cross floated upon the walls of  Jerusalem. The crusaders, raising once more their redoubtable war-cry,  rushed on from every side, and the city was taken. The battle raged in  the streets for several hours, and the Christians, remembering their  insulted faith, gave no quarter to young or old, male or female, sick  or strong. Not one of the leaders thought himself at liberty to issue  orders for staying the carnage, and if he had, he would not have been  obeyed. The Saracens fled in great numbers to the mosque of Soliman,  but they had not time to fortify themselves within it ere the  Christians were upon them. Ten thousand persons are said to have  perished in that building alone.    Peter the Hermit, who had remained so long under the veil of neglect,  was repaid that day for all his zeal and all his sufferings.  As soon  as the battle was over, the Christians of Jerusalem issued forth from  their hiding-places to welcome their deliverers. They instantly  recognized the Hermit as the pilgrim who, years before, had spoken to  them so eloquently of the wrongs and insults they had endured, and  promised to stir up the princes and people of Europe in their behalf.  They clung to the skirts of his garments in the fervour of their  gratitude, and vowed to remember him for ever in their prayers. Many of  them shed tears about his neck, and attributed the deliverance of  Jerusalem solely to his courage and perseverance. Peter afterwards held  some ecclesiastical office in the Holy City, but what it was, or what  was his ultimate fate, history has forgotten to inform us. Some say  that he returned to France and founded a monastery, but the story does  not rest upon sufficient authority.    The grand object for which the popular swarms of Europe had forsaken  their homes was now accomplished. The Moslem mosques of Jerusalem were  converted into churches for a purer faith, and the mount of Calvary and  the sepulchre of Christ were profaned no longer by the presence or the  power of the infidel. Popular frenzy had fulfilled its mission, and, as  a natural consequence, it began to subside from that time forth. The  news of the capture of Jerusalem brought numbers of pilgrims from  Europe, and, among others, Stephen Count of Chartres and Hugh of  Vermandois, to atone for their desertion; but nothing like the former  enthusiasm existed among the nations.    Thus then ends the history of the first Crusade. For the better  understanding of the second, it will be necessary to describe the  interval between them, and to enter into a slight sketch of the history  of Jerusalem under its Latin kings, the long and fruitless wars they  continued to wage with the unvanquished Saracens, and the poor and  miserable results which sprang from so vast an expenditure of zeal, and  so deplorable a waste of human life.

Perhaps it was  because they felt so happy over having done a good turn for a poor  neighbor.    \"Say, fellows,\" Tom said later, while they sat on the pond bank trying  to see something interesting in the cool, clear water, \"what do you say  if we make up a circus!\"    \"Fine,\" the others answered, \"but what will be the show?\"    \"Animals of course,\" continued Tom; \"we've got plenty around here,  haven't we?\"    \"Well, some,\" Harry admitted. \"There's Sable, for instance.\"    At this the boys all laughed at Tom, remembering the runaway.    \"Well, I could be a cowboy, and ride him just the same,\" spoke up Tom.  \"I rode him around the track yesterday, and he went all right. He was  only scared with that sulphur match when he ran away.\"    \"A circus would be fine,\" Bert put in. \"We could have Frisky as the  Sacred Calf.\"    \"And Snoopy as the Wild Cat,\" said Harry.    \"And two trained goats,\" August added.    \"And a real human bear, 'Teddy'?\" suggested Jack.    \"Then a cage of pigeons,\" went on Harry.    \"Let's get them all in training,\" said Tom, jumping up suddenly,  anxious to begin the sport.    \"I tell you!\" Harry planned. \"We can each train our own animals and  then we can bring them together in a well-organized circus.\"    \"When will we have it?\" August asked impatiently.    \"About next week,\" Harry thought, and this was decided upon.    During the interval the boys were so busy training that they had little  time for other sports, but the girls found out-door life quite as  interesting as their brothers did, and now made many discoveries in and  about the pretty woodlands.    \"Oh, we saw the prettiest little rabbits today,\" Nan told her mother,  after a trip in the woods. \"Flossie and Freddie were sitting on an old  stump when two rabbits ran right across the road in front of them.  Freddie ran after them as far as he could go in the brushwood, but of  course no one can go as fast as a rabbit.\"    \"And the squirrels,\" Flossie told them. \"I think the squirrels are the  prettiest things that live in the woods. They have tails just like  mamma's feather boa and they walk sitting up so cute.\"    \"Oh, I think the rabbits are the nicest,\" lisped Freddie, \"'cause they  are Bunnies, and Bunnies bring Easter eggs.\"    \"And we have made the loveliest fern garden up back of the swing,\" said  Flossie. \"We got a whole basket of ferns in the woods and transplanted  them.\"    \"In the center we have some lovely Jack-in the-pulpits,\" Nan added.  \"Some are light green striped, and the largest are purple with gold  stripes. The Jacks stand up straight, just like real live boys  preaching in a pulpit.\"    \"Don't you think, mamma,\" asked Flossie, \"that daisies and violets make  a lovely garden? I have a round place in the middle of our wild flower  bed just full of light blue violets and white daisies.\"    \"All flowers are beautiful,\" their mamma told them, \"but I do think  with Flossie that daisies and violets are very sweet.\"    \"And, mamma, we got a big piece of the loveliest green moss! It is just  like real velvet,\" said Flossie. \"We found a place all covered with it  down by the pond, under the dark cedar trees. Nan said it wouldn't grow  in our garden, but I brought some home to try. I put it in a cool dark  place, and I'm going to put lots of water on it every day.\"    \"Moss must be very cool and damp to grow,\" Mrs. Bobbsey replied. \"I  remember how disappointed I used to be when I was a little girl and  tried to make it grow around my geraniums. It would always dry up and  turn brown in a few days.\"    \"Oh,\" called Freddie from his garden under the cherry tree, \"come  quick! Look at the funny bugs!\"    Nan and Flossie hurried to where their little brother had dug a hole in  the earth.    \"They're mice!\" exclaimed Nan. \"Oh, aren't they cute! Let's catch them.  Call Bert or Harry.\"    While Flossie ran to tell Bert, Nan watched the tiny mice so that they  would not get away.    \"It's a nest of field mice,\" Harry told them.    \"We'll put them in a cage and have them in our circus.\"    \"But they're my mice,\" cried Freddie, \"and I won't let anybody have  them!\"    \"We're only going to help you take care of them in a little box. Oh,  there's the mother--catch her, Harry,\" called Bert.    The mother mouse was not so easy to catch, however, and the boys had  quite a chase after her. At last she ran into a tin box the boys had  sunk in the ground when playing golf. Here Harry caught the frightened  little creature.    \"I've got a queer kind of a trap,\" Harry said. \"It's just like a cage.  We can put them in this until we build a larger one. We can make one  out of a box with a wire door.\"    The mice were the smallest, cutest things, not larger than Freddie's  thumb. They hardly looked like mice at all, but like some queer little  bugs. They were put in the cage trap, mother and all, and then Bert got  them a bit of cheese from the kitchen.    \"What! Feed mice!\" exclaimed Dinah \"Sakes alive, chile! you go bringing  dem mice in de house to eat all our cake and pie. You just better drown  dem in de brook before dey bring a whole lot more mices around here.\"    \"We'll keep them away from the house,\" Bert told Dinah. \"We're going to  have a circus, you know, and these will be our trained mice.\"    Freddie, of course, was delighted with the little things, and wanted to  dig for more.    \"I tell you!\" said Bert. \"We might catch butterflies and have them  under a big glass on the table with all the small animals.\"    \"That would be good,\" Harry agreed. \"We could catch some big brown ones  and some little fancy ones. Then after dark we could get some big moths  down by the postoffice electric light.\"    The girls, too, went catching butterflies. Nan was able to secure four  or five yellow ones in the flower garden near the porch, and Flossie  got two of the small brown variety in the nasturtium bed. Harry and  Bert searched in the close syringa bushes where the nests are usually  found.    \"Oh! look at this one!\" called Freddie, coming up with a great green  butterfly. \"Is it bird?\" he asked. \"See how big it is!\"    It really was very large, and had such beautiful wings it might easily  be mistaken for some strange bird.    \"We will try to keep them alive,\" said Harry, \"and perhaps we can get  ma's big glass globe to put them in. She has one she used to put wax  flowers under.\"    \"And, oh say!\" exclaimed Bert, \"couldn't we have an aquarium with  snakes and turtles and toads in?\"    \"Fine!\" declared Harry. \"We've got a big glass tank I used to have gold  fish in. We'll get the other fellows to help catch some snakes, fish,  and turtles and toads, and--and anything else that will stand water!\"    Then what a time they had hunting for reptiles! It seemed each boy had  a different variety on his premises. August Stout brought three turtles  and Jack Hopkins caught two snakes under a big stone in his back yard.  Tom Mason supplied four lovely gold fish, while Ned Prentice brought  three bright green frogs.    \"I can catch hop-toads,\" declared Freddie, and sure enough the little  fellow brought two big ones and a baby toad in his hat down to the  boys, who had their collection in a glass tank in the barn.    \"We can't put the snakes in with the others or they'll eat them up,\"  said Jack. \"I'll get a big glass jar for the snakes.\"    \"And say!\" said Harry. \"Will we charge admission to the show?\"    \"Sure--five cents each,\" said Tom, \"and give the money to the fresh-air  camp over on the mountain.\"    This was considered a good plan, and now it was only a few days more  until Wednesday--the day of the circus!        CHAPTER XIV    THE CIRCUS    News of the circus had spread from one end of Meadow Brook to the  other. Every boy and girl in the place expected to get in to see the  sights, and even some grown folks had made up their minds, from what  they heard, there would be something interesting for them to see, and  so they decided to go too.    Mrs. Bobbsey, Aunt Sarah, Dinah, and Martha had bought tickets for  reserved seats (these cost ten cents each). Then Mildred Manners was  going to bring her mother and her big sister, and Mabel Herold expected  to have her mother with her also. Mr. Bobbsey was coming up from  Lakeport purposely to see the circus, and Uncle Daniel had helped the  boys put up the seats and fix things generally. A big tent had been  borrowed from the Herolds; they were only out at Meadow Brook for the  summer, and this tent was erected in the open field between the Bobbsey  and the Mason farms, alongside the track where Tom had tried Sable.    The tent had large flaps that opened up the entire front, so that all  the exhibits could be shown nicely to the people on the seats out side.    The seats were made of boards set on most anything that would hold  them, with a few garden benches for reserved seats at the front.    Everything was ready, and the circus day came at last.    \"Lucky it isn't raining,\" the boys declared as they rushed around  putting the final touches to everything.    August Stout was appointed to collect the tickets, and Ned Prentice was  to show the people to their seats.    Two o'clock!    Only one hour more!    Lots of children came early to get good seats. Roy Mason sat right in  the front row alongside of Freddie. Nettie"]]]
