Of course, as soon as your pageship is  over you will go to the English auberge, but I shall still keep my eye  upon you, and shall do my best to help you to achieve distinction; and  I shall take upon myself the providing of your arms and armour as a  knight.\"    Accordingly, on the day on which his duties as a page terminated, two  servitors of the auberge of Auvergne brought across to the palace a suit  of fine armour and a sword, a battleaxe, a lance, and a dagger; also  three complete suits of clothes, two of them for ordinary wear, and one  for state occasions. The next day Gervaise took the oaths of the Order  in the Church of St. John. The aged master himself received the vows,  and formally inducted him as a professed knight of the Order, Peter  D'Aubusson and the bailiff of the English langue acting as his sponsors,  vouching that he was of noble blood and in all ways fitted to become  a knight of Justice, this being the official title of the professed  knights of the Order. Ten newly arrived novices were inducted at the  same time, and the ceremony was a stately one, attended by a number of  the knights from each langue, all in full armour.    The ceremony over, Gervaise bore the title of Sir Gervaise Tresham;  but this was an honorary rather than a real title, as the Order did not  profess to bestow the honour of knighthood, and it was usual for its  members to receive the accolade at the hands of secular knights. At the  conclusion of the ceremony, he returned with the bailiff of the English  langue to the auberge, and took up his quarters there. By his frequent  visits he was well known to all the members, and in a day or two felt as  much at home as he had done in the pages' room in the palace. A week was  given to him before he was assigned to any special duty, and he was glad  when he was told off as one of the knights who were to take their turn  in superintending the work of the slaves employed in strengthening  the fortifications, although he would rather that any other employment  should have been assigned to him, because he felt deep pity for the  unfortunate men who were engaged in the work.    He knew well enough that if he himself were ever made prisoner by the  Turks, his lot would be as hard and as hopeless as that of the Moslem  captives; but this, although he often repeated it to himself in order to  abate his feeling of commiseration, was but a poor satisfaction. He saw  one side of the picture, and the other was hidden from him; and although  he told himself that after slaving in a Turkish galley he would feel a  satisfaction at seeing those who had been his tyrants suffering the same  fate, he was well aware that this would not be the case, and that his  own sufferings would only make him sympathise more deeply with those of  others. He had found, soon after his arrival on the Island, that it was  best to keep his feelings on this subject to himself. While the knights  were bound, in accordance with their vows, to relieve sufferings of any  kind among Christians, they seemed to regard their captives rather in  the light of brute beasts than human beings. The slaves were struck on  the smallest provocation, and even the killing of a slave was considered  a very venial offence, and punished only because the slave was of value  to the Order.    It was true that edicts were from time to time published by the council,  enjoining fair treatment of slaves, and it was specially ordered that  those employed as servants in the auberges were not to be struck. The  lot of these servants was, indeed, very much easier than that of  those engaged on the public works, and such occupation was therefore  considered a privilege, the servants being for the most part selected  from among the captives of superior rank.    For the next six months Gervaise worked at various duties in the town.  He was employed for a fortnight in the infirmary, then for a while he  was transferred to the galleys; but for the most part he was with the  slaves working on the fortifications. At the end of that time he was,  to his great delight, informed by the bailiff that he was one of the six  knights of the langue told off to join a galley that was on the point  of sailing. Among those going in her was Sir Ralph Harcourt, one of his  companions on the journey from England.    \"So you are to go with us, Gervaise,\" the young knight said, \"to try  your luck for the first time against the infidels. This is my third  voyage, and I hope that it will be more fortunate than its predecessors,  for, beyond picking up two or three small craft, which did not venture  upon resistance, we gained neither honour nor booty. I regard you as  having specially good fortune, and besides being glad that we shall  be together, I expect that you will bring good luck to us, and that we  shall meet with foes worth contending with. The corsairs have been very  active of late, and have captured many prizes, while, on the other hand,  our galleys have been unfortunate, and have but seldom come upon the  miscreants.\"    \"How many knights will there be on board?\"    \"Forty. Aragon, like us, furnishes five, Germany ten, Portugal five,  Auvergne ten, and Provence five. We shall be commanded by Sir Louis  Ricord, a knight of Auvergne, and we could wish no better, for he has  proved himself a good seaman and a brave captain. Two other galleys are  to start with us. We are to cruise separately unless one gets news of a  force so superior that he will need aid to attack it, when he will meet  the others at a rendezvous agreed upon, and we shall work together.\"    \"Who are the other three Englishmen?\"    \"John Boswell, Marmaduke Lumley, and Adam Tedbond--all, as you know,  brave knights and good companions.\"    That evening Gervaise received a message from D'Aubusson, requesting him  to call at his auberge.    \"So you are going to sea, Sir Gervaise? I hear from your bailiff that  you have been working to his satisfaction in the town.\"    \"Yes, sir. I shall indeed be glad to change it for a life at sea. In  truth, it is grievous to me to witness the sufferings of the slaves, and  I would rather do any other work.\"    \"They are far better off than the Christians who fall into the hands  of the Turks,\" the bailiff said; \"and, moreover, it is because their  countrymen are preparing to attack us that we are forced to use their  labour in strengthening our fortifications. They have naught to complain  of in the way of food. Still, I would myself gladly see their lot  alleviated; but we could not afford to keep so great a number of  captives in idleness; they must work for their living. Had it not been  for their labour we could never have built and fortified the city. After  all, they are little worse off than our serfs at home; they build our  castles and till our land.\"    \"It may be so, sir; but with us in England men are free, and it was,  when I first came, strange to me to see them working under the fear of  the whip. It is necessary, I know, that such work should be done, but I  own that I shall be glad to be away from the sight of the poor wretches,  pirates and enemies of the faith though they be.\"    \"I can understand your feelings, and I too felt somewhat the same when  I first came here. Nevertheless, there is work that must be done if the  Order is not to be crushed by the infidels. Here are captives, for the  most part malefactors, who have to be fed; and there is no injustice in  their having, like all men, to give work for food. I have learnt to see  this and recognise the necessity, though I would that the work could  be obtained without the use of harshness and severity. We ourselves are  prepared at any moment to sacrifice our lives for the good of the Order  and for the great cause, and it would be wrong, nay, sinful, not to use  the means that have been placed ready to our hand. Now, Sir Gervaise, I  wish you a pleasant voyage. You will find the life somewhat hard, after  your three years' residence at the palace, but this I know you will  not mind. I have specially commended you to Ricord as one in whom I am  personally interested, and from whom I hope great things in the future.  Be brave; be resolute. From what you have said I need not say--be  merciful. Fulfill all orders promptly and without question; bear  yourself courteously to all; above all things, remember that you are a  soldier, not only of the Order, but of the Cross.\"    The next day Gervaise embarked with his companions on board the galley.  It was a long, low boat, similar to those in use by the Venetians and  Genoese. It was rowed by fifty slaves, who slept at night on or beneath  the benches they sat on by day. The knights occupied the great cabins  in the poop. There were two tiers of these; the upper one contained the  little cabin of the commander, while the rest of the space on this deck,  and that below it, was used by the knights in common. In the upper cabin  they took their meals, and a third of their number slept there, the  remainder in the cabin below. A fourth of their number were, however,  always on guard, lest any attempt at a rising or escape should be made  by the galley slaves.    On leaving the harbour the galley, with its two consorts, rowed north,  and Gervaise learnt that they were to cruise between the mainland and  the islands. Some of these were in the hands of the Turks, while others  were still occupied by Greeks.    Except when there was a formal and actual state of war, the Moslem and  Christian islands remained in a state of neutrality, trading with  each other and avoiding all unfriendly proceedings that would lead  to struggles which would be fatal to the prosperity of both. The  Archipelago, and indeed the whole of the eastern portion of the  Mediterranean, was infested by pirates, fitted out, for the most part,  on the mainland. These, when in force,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4940"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Senior Year at High School (#12)"],[1,"hustled into the library  by Nora and Miriam, and informed by them that they constituted a  committee of two to amuse him until eleven o'clock. He was their  prisoner and they dared him to try to escape.    Next to Grace, Nora, with her rosy cheeks and ready Irish wit was  perhaps the judge's favorite, while he had a profound admiration for  stately Miriam; so he was well satisfied with his captors, who  triumphantly conducted him to the drawing room, where Miriam played and  Nora sang Irish ballads with a delicious brogue that completely  captivated the old gentleman.    At eleven o'clock there was a great jingling of bells and into the room  dashed Santa Claus, looking as fat and jolly as a story-book Kris  Kringle.    \"Merry Christmas,\" he cried in a high squeaky voice. \"It's a little  early to wish you Merry Christmas, judge, but I've an engagement in  China at midnight so I thought I'd drop in here a trifle early, leave a  few toys for you and your little playmates and be gone. I always make it  a point to remember good little boys. So hurry up, everybody, and follow  me, for I haven't long to stay.\"    With these words Kris Kringle dashed through the hall followed by the  judge who, entering fully into the spirit of the affair, seized Nora and  Miriam by the hand and the three raced after their strange visitor at  full speed, catching up with him at the door of the dining room which  was closed. Here Santa Claus paused and gave three knocks on the oak  door.    \"Who is there?\" demanded a voice, that sounded like David Nesbit's.    \"Kris Kringle and three good children.\"    \"Enter into the realm of Christmas,\" answered the voice, and the door  was flung open.    The sight that greeted them was sufficiently brilliant to dazzle their  eyes for a moment. In one corner of the dining room stood the great  tree, radiant with gilt and silver ornaments. At the top was a huge  silver star, while the branches were wound with glittering tinsel, and  heavily laden with beribboned bundles of all shapes and sizes, while the  space around the base of the tree was completely filled with presents.    At one side of the tree stood a graceful figure clad in a white robe  that glittered and sparkled as though covered with diamonds. She wore a  gilt crown on her head and carried a scepter, while over her shoulder  trailed a long garland of holly fastened with scarlet ribbons. It was  Grace Harlowe in a robe made of cotton wadding thickly sprinkled with  diamond dust, gotten up to represent the spirit of Christmas.    On the other side of the tree lay old Father Time, apparently fast  asleep, his sickle by his side. His long white cotton beard flowed  realistically down to his waist, and in his folded hands was a placard  bearing these words, \"Gone to sleep for the next hundred years,\" while  in the opposite corner his sister and the rest of the guests had grouped  themselves, and as the old gentleman stepped over the threshold, a  chorus of laughing voices rang out:    \"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!\"    Then Grace glided forward and escorted the judge to a sort of double  throne that had been improvised from two easy chairs raised to a small  platform constructed by the boys, and draped with the piano cover, and a  couple of silken curtains, while Santa Claus performed the same office  for Miss Putnam.    After they had been established with great pomp and ceremony, Santa  Claus awoke Father Time by shaking him vigorously, apologizing to the  company between each shake for doing so, and promising to put him to  sleep the moment the festivities were over.    Then the fun of distributing the presents began, and for the next hour a  great unwrapping and rattling of papers ensued, mingled with constant  exclamations of surprise and delight from all present, as they opened  and admired their gifts.    The judge was particularly pleased with the little personal gifts that  the girls themselves had made for him, and exclaimed with the delight of  a schoolboy as he opened each one. At last nothing remained save one  rather imposing package.    \"This must be something very remarkable,\" said the judge, as he untied  the bow of scarlet ribbon and unwrapped the folds of tissue paper,  disclosing a cut glass inkstand, with a heavy silver top, on which were  engraved his initials in block letters.    There was a general murmur of admiration from all.    \"Very fine, very fine,\" said the judge, picking up the card which read,  \"Merry Christmas, from Miss Barber.\"    \"Miss Barber?\" he repeated questioningly. Then it dawned upon him that  this expensive gift was from one of his guests.    \"Pardon me, my dear,\" he said turning to Marian, who looked half  complacent, half embarrassed. \"I am an old man and don't always remember  names as well as I should. The beauty of your gift quite overcame me.  Allow me to thank you and express my appreciation of it.\"    Marian smiled affectedly at the judge's words, in a manner so foreign to  her former, blunt, good-natured self, that the girl chums watched her in  silent amazement.    But the judge's inkstand was merely the fore-runner of surprises. A  sudden cry from Grace attracted the attention of the others.    \"Why, Marian Barber, what made you do it?\"    Then other exclamations followed in quick succession as the Phi Sigma  Taus rushed over to her in a body, each carrying a jeweler's box.    \"You shouldn't have been so generous, Marian,\" said Grace. \"I never  dreamed of receiving this beautiful gold chain.\"    \"Just look at my bracelet!\" cried Jessica.    \"And my lovely ring!\" put in Nora.    \"Not half so fine as my silver purse,\" commented Anne.    Miriam Nesbit was the recipient of a cut glass powder box with a silver  top, while Eva Allen was in raptures over a gold chatelaine pin, that  more than once she had vainly sighed for.    Even the boys had been so well remembered that they felt rather  embarrassed when they compared their simple gifts to Marian with those  she had given them. As for Mr. Henry Hammond, he had received a complete  toilet set mounted in silver that was truly a magnificent affair, while  Marian proudly exhibited a gold chain and locket set with small  diamonds, which she had received from him.    When the last package had been opened, Santa Claus removed his huge  white beard, slipped out of his scarlet bath robe bordered with cotton  and stood forth as Hippy Wingate; while Father Time set his sickle  carefully up in one corner, divested himself of his flowing beard and  locks, took off David's gray dressing gown and appeared as Tom Gray.    It was long after midnight before the guests sought their rooms, their  arms piled with gifts.    \"Come into my room for an after-gathering,\" said Miriam to the girls, as  they stood in a group at the head of the stairs.    \"Wait until we deposit our spoils and get comfy,\" said Grace.    Fifteen minutes later the Phi Sigma Taus, with the exception of Marian  Barber, wrapped in kimonos, were monopolizing the floor space around the  big open fireplace in Miriam's room.    \"Where's Marian?\" asked Grace.    \"Gone to bed,\" answered Eva laconically. \"She said she didn't propose to  stay up half the night to gossip.\"    \"The very idea!\" exclaimed Jessica. \"We never do gossip, but I think she  has furnished plenty of material so far for a gossiping match.\"    \"And it looks as though we were in a fair way to start one, now,\" said  Anne slyly.    \"Anne, you rascal,\" said Jessica laughing. \"I'll acknowledge my sins and  change the subject.\"    \"My presents were all beautiful!\" said Miriam Nesbit, who, clad in a  kimono of cream-colored silk bordered with red poppies, her long black  braids hanging far below her waist, looked like a princess of the  Orient.    \"And mine,\" echoed Grace. \"The chain Marian gave me is a dear.\"    She stopped abruptly. A sudden silence had fallen upon the group at her  words. Grace instantly divined that in the minds of her friends there  lurked a secret disapproval of Marian's extravagance in the matter of  gifts.          CHAPTER XII    THE MISTLETOE BOUGH      After breakfast the next morning the judge proposed a sleigh ride, and  soon the entire party were skimming over the ground in two big  old-fashioned sleighs. Though the day was fairly cold, the guests were  too warmly wrapped to pay any attention to the weather, and keenly  enjoyed every moment of the ride.    After lunch a mysterious council took place in the library, and directly  after a visit was made to the attic, Grace having received permission to  rummage there. Later Reddy and Tom Gray were seen staggering down the  stairs under the weight of a huge cedar chest, and later still the girls  hurried down, their arms piled high with costumes of an earlier period.    Christmas dinner was to be a grand affair, and the judge had invited  half a dozen friends of his own age to share \"his borrowed children.\"    The girls had saved their prettiest gowns for the occasion, and the boys  had put on evening dress. The judge viewed them with unmistakable pride  as they stood grouped about the drawing room, awaiting the announcement  of dinner. An almost imperceptible frown gathered between his brows,  however, as his eyes rested upon Marian Barber, who was wearing a  fearfully and wonderfully made gown of gold-colored silk, covered with  spangles, that gave her a serpentine effect, and made her look ten years  older than the other girls.    On going upstairs to dress, Marian had asked Eva Allen if she objected  to dressing with Miriam Nesbit, and Eva had obligingly taken her  belongings into Miriam's room after obtaining the latter's permission to  do so. Marian had engaged the attention of Miss Putnam's maid for the  greater part of an hour, and when she did appear the varied expressions  upon the faces of her friends plainly showed that she had succeeded in  creating a sensation.    \"For goodness sake, what ails Marian!\" growled Reddy Brooks in an  undertone "]]]
