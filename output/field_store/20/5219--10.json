The pawkie auld carle cam ower the lea,                  Wi' mony good-e'ens and good-morrows to me,                      Saying, Kind Sir, for your courtesy,                      Will ye lodge a silly puir man?                                    The Gaberlunzie Man.    Our two friends moved through a little orchard, where the aged  apple-trees, well loaded with fruit, showed, as is usual in the  neighbourhood of monastic buildings, that the days of the monks had not  always been spent in indolence, but often dedicated to horticulture  and gardening. Mr. Oldbuck failed not to make Lovel remark, that the  planters of those days were possessed of the modern secret of preventing  the roots of the fruit-trees from penetrating the till, and compelling  them to spread in a lateral direction, by placing paving-stones beneath  the trees when first planted, so as to interpose between their fibres  and the subsoil. \"This old fellow,\" he said, \"which was blown down last  summer, and still, though half reclined on the ground, is covered  with fruit, has been, as you may see, accommodated with such a  barrier between his roots and the unkindly till. That other tree has a  story:--the fruit is called the Abbot's Apple; the lady of a neighbouring  baron was so fond of it, that she would often pay a visit to Monkbarns,  to have the pleasure of gathering it from the tree. The husband, a  jealous man, belike, suspected that a taste so nearly resembling that  of Mother Eve prognosticated a similar fall. As the honour of a noble  family is concerned, I will say no more on the subject, only that the  lands of Lochard and Cringlecut still pay a fine of six bolls of barley  annually, to atone the guilt of their audacious owner, who intruded  himself and his worldly suspicions upon the seclusion of the Abbot and  his penitent.--Admire the little belfry rising above the ivy-mantled  porch--there was here a hospitium, hospitale, or hospitamentum (for it  is written all these various ways in the old writings and evidents), in  which the monks received pilgrims. I know our minister has said, in the  Statistical Account, that the hospitium was situated either in the lands  of Haltweary or upon those of Half-starvet; but he is incorrect, Mr.  Lovel--that is the gate called still the Palmer's Port, and my gardener  found many hewn stones, when he was trenching the ground for winter  celery, several of which I have sent as specimens to my learned friends,  and to the various antiquarian societies of which I am an unworthy  member. But I will say no more at present; I reserve something for  another visit, and we have an object of real curiosity before us.\"    While he was thus speaking, he led the way briskly through one or two  rich pasture-meadows, to an open heath or common, and so to the top of  a gentle eminence. \"Here,\" he said, \"Mr. Lovel, is a truly remarkable  spot.\"    \"It commands a fine view,\" said his companion, looking around him.    \"True: but it is not for the prospect I brought you hither; do you see  nothing else remarkable?--nothing on the surface of the ground?\"    \"Why, yes; I do see something like a ditch, indistinctly marked.\"    \"Indistinctly!--pardon me, sir, but the indistinctness must be in your  powers of vision. Nothing can be more plainly traced--a proper agger or  vallum, with its corresponding ditch or fossa. Indistinctly! why, Heaven  help you, the lassie, my niece, as light-headed a goose as womankind  affords, saw the traces of the ditch at once. Indistinct!--why, the great  station at Ardoch, or that at Burnswark in Annandale, may be clearer,  doubtless, because they are stative forts, whereas this was only an  occasional encampment. Indistinct!--why, you must suppose that fools,  boors, and idiots, have ploughed up the land, and, like beasts and  ignorant savages, have thereby obliterated two sides of the square, and  greatly injured the third; but you see, yourself, the fourth side is  quite entire!\"    Lovel endeavoured to apologize, and to explain away his ill-timed  phrase, and pleaded his inexperience. But he was not at once quite  successful. His first expression had come too frankly and naturally not  to alarm the Antiquary, and he could not easily get over the shock it  had given him.    \"My dear sir,\" continued the senior, \"your eyes are not inexperienced:  you know a ditch from level ground, I presume, when you see them?  Indistinct! why, the very common people, the very least boy that can  herd a cow, calls it the Kaim of Kinprunes; and if that does not imply  an ancient camp, I am ignorant what does.\"    Lovel having again acquiesced, and at length lulled to sleep the  irritated and suspicious vanity of the Antiquary, he proceeded in his  task of cicerone. \"You must know,\" he said, \"our Scottish antiquaries  have been greatly divided about the local situation of the final  conflict between Agricola and the Caledonians; some contend for Ardoch  in Strathallan, some for Innerpeffry, some for the Raedykes in the  Mearns, and some are for carrying the scene of action as far north as  Blair in Athole. Now, after all this discussion,\" continued the old  gentleman, with one of his slyest and most complacent looks, \"what would  you think, Mr. Lovel,--I say, what would you think,--if the memorable  scene of conflict should happen to be on the very spot called the Kaim  of Kinprunes, the property of the obscure and humble individual who now  speaks to you?\" Then, having paused a little, to suffer his guest to  digest a communication so important, he resumed his disquisition in a  higher tone. \"Yes, my good friend, I am indeed greatly deceived if this  place does not correspond with all the marks of that celebrated place  of action. It was near to the Grampian mountains--lo! yonder they are,  mixing and contending with the sky on the skirts of the horizon! It was  in conspectu classis--in sight of the Roman fleet; and would any admiral,  Roman or British, wish a fairer bay to ride in than that on your right  hand? It is astonishing how blind we professed antiquaries sometimes  are! Sir Robert Sibbald, Saunders Gordon, General Roy, Dr. Stokely,--why,  it escaped all of them. I was unwilling to say a word about it till  I had secured the ground, for it belonged to auld Johnnie Howie, a  bonnet-laird* hard by, and many a communing we had before he and I could  agree.    * A bonnet-laird signifies a petty proprietor, wearing the dress, along  with the habits of a yeoman.    At length--I am almost ashamed to say it--but I even brought my mind to  give acre for acre of my good corn-land for this barren spot. But then  it was a national concern; and when the scene of so celebrated an event  became my own, I was overpaid.--Whose patriotism would not grow warmer,  as old Johnson says, on the plains of Marathon? I began to trench the  ground, to see what might be discovered; and the third day, sir, we  found a stone, which I have transported to Monkbarns, in order to have  the sculpture taken off with plaster of Paris; it bears a sacrificing  vessel, and the letters A. D. L. L. which may stand, without much  violence, for Agricola Dicavit Libens Lubens.\"    \"Certainly, sir; for the Dutch Antiquaries claim Caligula as the founder  of a light-house, on the sole authority of the letters C. C. P. F.,  which they interpret Caius Caligula Pharum Fecit.\"    \"True, and it has ever been recorded as a sound exposition. I see  we shall make something of you even before you wear spectacles,  notwithstanding you thought the traces of this beautiful camp indistinct  when you first observed them.\"    \"In time, sir, and by good instruction\"--    \"--You will become more apt--I doubt it not. You shall peruse, upon your  next visit to Monkbarns, my trivial Essay upon Castrametation, with some  particular Remarks upon the Vestiges of Ancient Fortifications lately  discovered by the Author at the Kaim of Kinprunes. I think I have  pointed out the infallible touchstone of supposed antiquity. I premise a  few general rules on that point, on the nature, namely, of the evidence  to be received in such cases. Meanwhile be pleased to observe, for  example, that I could press into my service Claudian's famous line,                   Ille Caledoniis posuit qui castra pruinis.    For pruinis, though interpreted to mean hoar frosts, to which I own we  are somewhat subject in this north-eastern sea-coast, may also signify  a locality, namely, Prunes; the Castra Pruinis posita would therefore be  the Kaim of Kinprunes. But I waive this, for I am sensible it might  be laid hold of by cavillers as carrying down my Castra to the time of  Theodosius, sent by Valentinian into Britain as late as the year 367, or  thereabout. No, my good friend, I appeal to people's eye-sight. Is  not here the Decuman gate? and there, but for the ravage of the horrid  plough, as a learned friend calls it, would be the Praetorian gate. On  the left hand you may see some slight vestiges of the porta sinistra,  and on the right, one side of the porta dextra wellnigh entire. Here,  then, let us take our stand, on this tumulus, exhibiting the foundation  of ruined buildings,--the central point--the praetorium, doubtless, of the  camp. From this place, now scarce to be distinguished but by its slight  elevation and its greener turf from the rest of the fortification,  we may suppose Agricola to have looked forth on the immense army  of Caledonians, occupying the declivities of yon opposite hill,--the  infantry rising rank over rank, as the form of ground displayed their  array to its utmost advantage,--the cavalry and covinarii, by which I  understand the charioteers--another guise of folks from your Bond-street  four-in-hand men, I trow--scouring the more level space below--                           --See, then, Lovel--See--              See that huge battle moving from the mountains!

I have a dislike to such tricksters.    We have no prejudice to foreigners.    She don't know nothing about it.    Father wouldn't give me none.    He hasn't been sick neither.    I won't have no more nohow.    +To the Teacher+.--Let the reason be given for every correction.          LESSON 52.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    Build sentences in which the following participles shall be used as  modifiers.    Being fatigued; laughing; being amused; having been elected; running;  having been running.    Expand each of the following sentences into three sentences, using the  _participial form_ of the verb as a _participle_, in the first; the same  form as an _adjective_, in the second; and as a _noun_, in the third.    +Model+.--The stream _flows_. The stream, _flowing_ gently, crept through  the meadow. The _flowing_ stream slipped away to the sea. The _flowing_ of  the stream caused a low murmur. The stream flows. The sun rises. Insects  hum. The birds sing. The wind whistles. The bells are ringing. The tide  ebbs.    Form _infinitive phrases_ from the following verbs, and use these phrases  as _adjectives, adverbs_, and _nouns_, in sentences of your own building.    Smoke, dance, burn, eat, lie, try.    +To the Teacher+.--For exercises to distinguish the participle from the  predicate verb, see Notes, pp. 181, 182.          LESSON 53.    NOUNS AND PRONOUNS AS MODIFIERS.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--In the sentence, _The robin's eggs are  blue_, the noun _robin's_ does what? +P+.--It tells what or whose eggs are  blue. +T+.--What word names the things owned or possessed? +P+.--_Eggs_.  +T+.--What word names the owner or possessor? +P+.--_Robin's_.    +T+.--The noun _robin's_ is here used as a _modifier_. You see that this  word, which I have written on the board, is the word _robin_ with a little  mark (') called an apostrophe, and the letter _s_ added. These are added to  denote possession.    In the sentence, _Webster, the statesman, was born in New Hampshire_, the  noun _statesman_ modifies the subject _Webster_ by explaining what or which  Webster is meant. Both words name the same person.    Let the pupils give examples of each of these two kinds of +Noun  Modifiers+--the +Possessive+ and the +Explanatory+.      Analysis and Parsing.    +Model+.--_Julia's sister Mary has lost her diamond ring_.      sister (Mary) |  has lost  |   ring   ===============|============'=============      \\Julia's    |                \\her  \\diamond    +Explanation of the Diagram+.--_Mary_ is written on the subject line,  because _Mary_ and _sister_ both name the same person, but the word _Mary_  is inclosed within marks of parenthesis to show that _sister_ is the proper  grammatical subject.    In _oral analysis_, call _Julia's_ and _Mary_ modifiers of the subject,  _sister_, because _Julia's_ tells whose sister, and _Mary_ explains sister  by adding another name of the same person. _Her_ is a modifier of the  object, because it tells whose ring is meant.    _Julia's sister Mary_ is the _modified subject_, the predicate is  unmodified, and _her diamond ring_ is the _modified object complement_.    1. The planet Jupiter has four moons.  2. The Emperor Nero was a cruel tyrant.  3. Peter's wife's mother lay sick of a fever.       mother    ========      \\wife's         \\Peter's    4. An ostrich outruns an Arab's horse.  5. His pretty little nephew Arthur had the best claim to the throne.  6. Milton, the great English poet, became blind.  7. Caesar gave his daughter Julia in marriage to Pompey.  8. London, the capital of England, is the largest and richest city in the     world.  9. Joseph, Jacob's favorite son, was sold by his brethren to the     Ishmaelites.  10. Alexander the Great [Footnote: _Alexander the Great_ may be taken as      one name, or _Great_ may be called an explanatory modifier of      _Alexander_.] was educated under the celebrated philosopher Aristotle.  11. Friends tie their purses with a spider's thread.  12. Caesar married Cornelia, the daughter of Cinna.  13. His fate, alas! was deplorable.  14. Love rules his kingdom without a sword.          LESSON 54.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    Nouns and pronouns denoting possession may generally be changed to  equivalent phrases; as, _Arnold's treason_ = _the treason of Arnold_. Here  the preposition _of_ indicates _possession_, the same relation expressed by  the apostrophe (') and _s_. Change the following possessive nouns to  equivalent phrases, and the phrases indicating possession to possessive  nouns, and then expand the expressions into complete sentences.    +Model+.--The _earth's_ surface. The surface _of the earth_ is made up of  land and water.    The earth's surface: Solomon's temple; England's Queen; Washington's  Farewell Address; Dr. Kane's Explorations; Peter's wife's mother; George's  friend's father; Shakespeare's plays; Noah's dove; the diameter of the  earth; the daughter of Jephthah; the invasion of Burgoyne; the voyage of  Cabot; the Armada of Philip; the attraction of the earth; the light of the  moon.    Find for the things mentioned below, _other_ names which shall describe or  explain them. Add such names to these nouns, and then expand the  expressions into complete sentences.    +Model+.--_Ink_.--_Ink, a dark fluid_, is used in writing.    Observe the following rule.    +COMMA-RULE.--An _Explanatory Modifier_, when it does not restrict the  modified term or combine closely with it, is set off by the comma+.    +To the Teacher+.--See Notes, pp. 176, 177.    New York, rain, paper, the monkey, the robin, tea, Abraham Lincoln,  Alexander Hamilton, world, peninsula, Cuba, Shakespeare.    Write three sentences, each of which shall contain a noun or pronoun  denoting possession, and a noun or pronoun used to explain.    +To the Teacher+.--For additional exercises in the use of possessive  modifiers, see Notes, pp. 182, 183.          LESSON 55.    ANALYSIS AND PARSING.    MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES IN REVIEW.    1. The toad spends the winter in a dormant state.  2. Pride in dress or in beauty betrays a weak mind.  3. The city of London is situated on the river Thames.  4. Napoleon Bonaparte was born in 1769, on an island in the Mediterranean.  5. Men's opinions vary with their interests.  6. Ammonia is found in the sap of trees, and in the juices of all     vegetables.  7. Earth sends up her perpetual hymn of praise to the Creator.  8. Having once been deceived by him, I never trusted him again.  9. Aesop, the author of Aesop's Fables, was a slave.  10. Hope comes with smiles to cheer the hour of pain.  11. Clouds are collections of vapors in the air.  12. To relieve the wretched was his pride.  13. Greece, the most noted country of antiquity, scarcely exceeded in size      the half of the state of New York.          LESSON 56.    ANALYSIS AND PARSING.    MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES IN REVIEW--CONTINUED.    1. We are never too old to learn.  2. Civility is the result of good nature and good sense.  3. The right of the people to instruct their representatives is generally     admitted.  4. The immense quantity of matter in the Universe presents a most striking     display of Almighty power.  5. Virtue, diligence, and industry, joined with good temper and prudence,     must ever be the surest means of prosperity.  6. The people called Quakers were a source of much trouble to the Puritans.  7. The Mayflower brought to America [Footnote: One hundred and one may be     taken as one adjective.] one hundred and one men, women, and children.  8. Edward Wingfield, an avaricious and unprincipled man, was the first     president of the Jamestown colony.  9. John Cabot and his son Sebastian, sailing under a commission from Henry     VII. of England, discovered the continent of America.  10. True worth is modest and retiring.  11. Jonah, the prophet, preached to the inhabitants of Nineveh.          LESSON 57.    COMPLEX SENTENCES.    THE ADJECTIVE CLAUSE.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--A word-modifier may sometimes be expanded  into a phrase or into an expression that asserts.    +T+.--_A wise man will be honored_. Expand _wise_ into a phrase, and give  me the sentence. +P+.--A man _of wisdom_ will be honored. +T+.--Expand  _wise_ into an expression that asserts, join this to _man_, as a modifier,  and then give me the entire sentence. +P+.--A man _who is wise_ will be  honored.    +T+.--You see that the same quality may be expressed in three ways--A  _wise_ man, A man _of wisdom_, A man _who is wise_.    Let the pupils give similar examples.    +T+.--In the sentence, _A man who is wise will be honored_, the word _who_  stands for what? +P+.--For the noun _man_. +T+.--Then what part of speech  is it? +P+.--A pronoun.    +T+.--Put the noun _man_ in the place of the pronoun _who_, and then give  me the sentence. +P+.--_A man, man is wise, will be honored_.    +T+.--I will repeat your sentence, changing the order of the words--_A man  will be honored. Man is wise_. Is the last sentence now joined to the first  as a modifier, or are they two separate sentences? +P+.--They are two  separate sentences.    +T+.--Then you see that the pronoun _who_ not only stands for the noun  _man_, but it connects the modifying expression, _who is wise_, to _man_,  the subject of the sentence, _A man will be honored_, and thus there is  formed what we call a +Complex Sentence+. These two parts we call  +Clauses+. _A man will be honored_ is the +Independent Clause;+ _who is  wise_ is the +Dependent Clause+.    Clauses that modify nouns or pronouns are called +Adjective Clauses+.      +DEFINITION.--A _Clause_ is a part of a sentence containing a subject and  its predicate+.    +DEFINITION.--A _Dependent Clause_ is one used as an adjective, an adverb,  or a noun+.    +DEFINITION.--An _Independent Clause_ is one not dependent on another  clause+.    +DEFINITION.--A _Simple Sentence_ is one that contains but one subject and  one predicate, either "]]]
