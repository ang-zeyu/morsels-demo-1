[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6782"],[0,"The Robbers (#12)"],[1,"AZ. A precious magnet, indeed. But I should like to know, I'll be  hanged if I shouldn't, what witchcraft you use?    SPIEGEL. Witchcraft? No need of witchcraft. All it wants is a head--a  certain practical capacity which, of course, is not taken in with every  spoonful of barley meal; for you know I have always said that an honest  man may be carved out of any willow stump, but to make a rogue you must  have brains; besides which it requires a national genius--a certain  rascal-climate--so to speak.*       *[In the first (and suppressed) edition was added, \"Go to the     Grisons, for instance; that is what I call the thief's Athens.\"     This obnoxious passage has been carefully expunged from all the     subsequent editions. It gave mortal offence to the Grison     magistrates, who made a formal complaint of the insult and caused     Schiller to be severely rebuked by the Grand Duke. This incident     forms one of the epochs in our author's history.]    RAZ. Brother, I have heard Italy celebrated for its artists.    SPIEGEL. Yes, yes! Give the devil his due. Italy makes a very noble  figure; and if Germany goes on as it has begun, and if the Bible gets  fairly kicked out, of which there is every prospect, Germany, too, may  in time arrive at something respectable; but I should tell you that  climate does not, after all, do such a wonderful deal; genius thrives  everywhere; and as for the rest, brother, a crab, you know, will never  become a pineapple, not even in Paradise. But to pursue our subject,  where did I leave off?    RAZ. You were going to tell me about your stratagems.    SPIEGEL. Ah, yes! my stratagems. Well, when you get into a town, the  first thing is to fish out from the beadles, watchmen, and turnkeys, who  are their best customers, and for these, accordingly, you must look out;  then ensconce yourself snugly in coffee-houses, brothels, and  beer-shops, and observe who cry out most against the cheapness of the  times, the reduced five per cents., and the increasing nuisance of police  regulations; who rail the loudest against government, or decry  physiognomical science, and such like? These are the right sort of  fellows, brother. Their honesty is as loose as a hollow tooth; you have  only to apply your pincers. Or a shorter and even better plan is to drop  a full purse in the public highway, conceal yourself somewhere near, and  mark who finds it. Presently after you come running up, search, proclaim  your loss aloud, and ask him, as it were casually, \"Have you perchance  picked up a purse, sir?\" If he says \"Yes,\" why then the devil fails you.  But if he denies it, with a \"pardon me, sir, I remember, I am sorry,  sir,\" (he jumps up), then, brother, you've done the trick. Extinguish  your lantern, cunning Diogenes, you have found your match.    RAZ. You are an accomplished practitioner.    SPIEGEL. My God! As if that had ever been doubted. Well, then, when  you have got your man into the net, you must take great care to land him  cleverly. You see, my son, the way I have managed is thus: as soon as I  was on the scent I stuck to my candidate like a leech; I drank  brotherhood with him, and, _nota bene_, you must always pay the score.  That costs a pretty penny, it is true, but never mind that. You must go  further; introduce him to gaming-houses and brothels; entangle him in  broils and rogueries till he becomes bankrupt in health and strength, in  purse, conscience, and reputation; for I must tell you, by the way, that  you will make nothing of it unless you ruin both body and soul. Believe  me, brother, and I have experienced it more than fifty times in my  extensive practice, that when the honest man is once ousted from his  stronghold, the devil has it all his own way--the transition is then as  easy as from a whore to a devotee. But hark! What bang was that?    RAZ. It was thunder; go on.    SPIEGEL. Or, there is a yet shorter and still better way. You strip  your man of all he has, even to his very shirt, and then he will come to  you of his own accord; you won't teach me to suck eggs, brother; ask  that copper-faced fellow there. My eyes, how neatly I got him into my  meshes. I showed him forty ducats, which I promised to give him if he  would bring me an impression in wax of his master's keys. Only think,  the stupid brute not only does this, but actually brings me--I'll be  hanged if he did not--the keys themselves; and then thinks to get the  money. \"Sirrah,\" said I, \"are you aware that I am going to carry these  keys straight to the lieutenant of police, and to bespeak a place for  you on the gibbet?\" By the powers! you should have seen how the  simpleton opened his eyes, and began to shake from head to foot like a  dripping poodle. \"For heaven's sake, sir, do but consider. I will--  will--\" \"What will you? Will you at once cut your stick and go to the  devil with me?\" \"Oh, with all my heart, with great pleasure.\" Ha! ha!  ha! my fine fellow; toasted cheese is the thing to catch mice with; do  have a good laugh at him, Razman; ha! ha! ha!    RAZ. Yes, yes, I must confess. I shall inscribe that lesson in letters  of gold upon the tablet of my brain. Satan must know his people right  well to have chosen you for his factor.    SPIEGEL. Eh, brother? Eli? And if I help him to half a score of  fellows he will, of course, let me off scot-free--publishers, you know,  always give one copy in ten gratis to those who collect subscribers for  them; why should the devil be more of a Jew? Razman, I smell powder.    RAZ. Zounds! I smelt it long ago. You may depend upon it there has  being something going forward hereabouts. Yes, yes! I can tell you,  Spiegelberg, you will be welcome to our captain with your recruits; he,  too, has got hold of some brave fellows.    SPIEGEL. But look at mine! at mine here, bah!    RAZ. Well, well! they may be tolerably expert in the finger  department, but, I tell you, the fame of our captain has tempted even  some honorable men to join his staff.    SPIEGEL. So much the worse.    RAZ. Without joking. And they are not ashamed to serve under such a  leader. He does not commit murder as we do for the sake of plunder; and  as to money, as soon as he had plenty of it at command, he did not seem  to care a straw for it; and his third of the booty, which belongs to him  of right, he gives away to orphans, or supports promising young men with  it at college. But should he happen to get a country squire into his  clutches who grinds down his peasants like cattle, or some gold-laced  villain, who warps the law to his own purposes, and hoodwinks the eyes  of justice with his gold, or any chap of that kidney; then, my boy, he  is in his element, and rages like a very devil, as if every fibre in his  body were a fury.    SPIEGEL. Humph!    RAZ. The other day we were told at a tavern that a rich count from  Ratisbon was about to pass through, who had gained the day in a suit  worth a million of money by the craftiness of his lawyer. The captain  was just sitting down to a game of backgammon. \"How many of us are  there?\" said he to me, rising in haste. I saw him bite his nether lip,  which he never does except when he is very determined. \"Not more than  five,\" I replied. \"That's enough,\" he said; threw his score on the  table, left the wine he had ordered untouched, and off we went. The  whole time he did not utter a syllable, but walked aloof and alone, only  asking us from time to time whether we heard anything, and now and then  desiring us to lay our ears to the ground. At last the count came in  sight, his carriage heavily laden, the lawyer, seated by his side, an  outrider in advance, and two horsemen riding behind. Then you should  have seen the man. With a pistol in each hand he ran before us to the  carriage,--and the voice with which he thundered, \"Halt!\" The coachman,  who would not halt, was soon toppled from his box; the count fired out  of the carriage and missed--the horseman fled. \"Your money, rascal!\"  cried Moor, with his stentorian voice. The count lay like a bullock  under the axe: \"And are you the rogue who turns justice into a venal  prostitute?\" The lawyer shook till his teeth chattered again; and a  dagger soon stuck in his body, like a stake in a vineyard. \"I have done  my part,\" cried the captain, turning proudly away; \"the plunder is your  affair.\" And with this he vanished into the forest.    SPIEGEL. Hum! hum! Brother, what I told you just now remains between  ourselves; there is no occasion for his knowing it. You understand me?    RAZ. Yes, yes, I understand!    SPIEGEL. You know the man! He has his own notions! You understand me?    RAZ. Oh, I quite understand.               (Enter SCHWARZ at full speed).    Who's there? What is the matter? Any travellers in the forest?    SCHWARZ. Quick, quick! Where are the others? Zounds! there you stand  gossiping! Don't you know--do you know nothing of it?--that poor  Roller--    PAZ. What of him? What of him?    SCHWARZ. He's hanged, that's all, and four others with him--    RAz. Roller hanged? S'death! when? How do you know?    SCHWARZ. He has been in limbo more than three weeks, and we knew  nothing of it. He was brought up for examination three several days,  and still we heard nothing. They put him to the rack to make him tell  where the captain was to be found--but the brave fellow would not slip.  Yesterday he got his sentence, and this morning was dispatched express  to the devil!    RAZ. Confound it! Does the captain know?    SCHWARZ. He heard of it only yesterday. He foamed like a wild boar.  You know that Roller was always an especial favorite; and then the rack!  Ropes and scaling-ladders were conveyed to the prison, but in vain.  Moor himself got access to him disguised as a Capuchin monk, and  proposed to change clothes with him; but Roller absolutely refused;  whereupon the captain swore an oath that made our very flesh creep. He  vowed that he would light a funeral pile for him, such as had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6788"],[0,"Wilhelm Tell (#12)"],[1,"recoils.  This right these haughty peasant-churls assume  Trenches upon their master's privileges.  None should be armed but those who bear command.  It pleases you wear the bow and bolt;  Well, be it so. I will provide the mark.    TELL (bends the bow and fixes the arrow).  A lane there! Room!    STAUFFACHER.             What, Tell? You would--no, no!  You shake--your hand's unsteady--your knees tremble!    TELL (letting the bow sink down).  There's something swims before mine eyes!    WOMEN.  Great Heaven!    TELL.          Release me from this shot!  Here is my heart!       [Tears open his breast.    Summon your troopers--let them strike me down!    GESSLER.  I do not want thy life, Tell, but the shot.  Thy talent's universal! Nothing daunts thee!  Thou canst direct the rudder like the bow!  Storms fright not thee when there's a life at stake.  Now, savior, help thyself, thou savest all!       [TELL stands fearfully agitated by contending emotions,     his hands moving convulsively, and his eyes turning     alternately to the governor and heaven. Suddenly he     takes a second arrow from his quiver and sticks it in     his belt. The governor watches all these motions.    WALTER (beneath the lime tree).  Come, father, shoot! I'm not afraid!    TELL.                      It must be!       [Collects himself and levels the bow.    RUDENZ (who all the while has been standing in a state of violent   excitement, and has with difficulty restrained himself, advances).  My lord, you will not urge this matter further.  You will not. It was surely but a test.  You've gained your object. Rigor pushed too far  Is sure to miss its aim, however good,  As snaps the bow that's all too straightly bent.    GESSLER.  Peace, till your counsel's asked for!    RUDENZ.  I will speak! Ay, and I dare! I reverence my king;  But acts like these must make his name abhorred.  He sanctions not this cruelty. I dare  Avouch the fact. And you outstep your powers  In handling thus an unoffending people.    GESSLER.  Ha! thou growest bold methinks!    RUDENZ.                   I have been dumb  To all the oppressions I was doomed to see.  I've closed mine eyes that they might not behold them,  Bade my rebellious, swelling heart be still,  And pent its struggles down within my breast.  But to be silent longer were to be  A traitor to my king and country both.    BERTHA (casting herself between him and the governor).  Oh, heavens! you but exasperate his rage!    RUDENZ.  My people I forsook, renounced my kindred--  Broke all the ties of nature that I might  Attach myself to you. I madly thought  That I should best advance the general weal,  By adding sinews to the emperor's power.  The scales have fallen from mine eyes--I see  The fearful precipice on which I stand.  You've led my youthful judgment far astray,--  Deceived my honest heart. With best intent,  I had well nigh achieved my country's ruin.    GESSLER.  Audacious boy, this language to thy lord?    RUDENZ.  The emperor is my lord, not you! I'm free  As you by birth, and I can cope with you  In every virtue that beseems a knight.  And if you stood not here in that king's name,  Which I respect e'en where 'tis most abused,  I'd throw my gauntlet down, and you should give  An answer to my gage in knightly fashion.  Ay, beckon to your troopers! Here I stand;  But not like these--     [Pointing to the people.            unarmed. I have a sword,  And he that stirs one step----    STAUFFACHER (exclaims).                 The apple's down!       [While the attention of the crowd has been directed     to the spot where BERTHA had cast herself between RUDENZ     and GESSLER, TELL has shot.    ROSSELMANN.  The boy's alive!    MANY VOICES.           The apple has been struck!       [WALTER FURST staggers, and is about to fall. BERTHA supports him.    GESSLER (astonished).  How? Has he shot? The madman!    BERTHA.                   Worthy father!  Pray you compose yourself. The boy's alive!    WALTER (runs in with the apple).  Here is the apple, father! Well I knew  You would not harm your boy.       [TELL stands with his body bent forwards, as though he would     follow the arrow. His bow drops from his hand. When he sees     the boy advancing, he hastens to meet him with open arms, and     embracing him passionately sinks down with him quite exhausted.     All crowd round them deeply affected.    BERTHA.  Oh, ye kind heavens!    FURST (to father and son).              My children, my dear children!    STAUFFACHER.  God be praised!    LEUTHOLD.           Almighty powers! That was a shot indeed!  It will be talked of to the end of time.    HARRAS.  This feat of Tell, the archer, will be told  While yonder mountains stand upon their base.       [Hands the apple to GESSLER.    GESSLER.  By heaven! the apple's cleft right through the core.  It was a master shot I must allow.    ROSSELMANN.  The shot was good. But woe to him who drove  The man to tempt his God by such a feat!    STAUFFACHER.  Cheer up, Tell, rise! You've nobly freed yourself,  And now may go in quiet to your home.    ROSSELMANN.  Come, to the mother let us bear her son!    GESSLER.  A word, Tell.       [They are about to lead him off.    TELL.          Sir, your pleasure?    GESSLER.                     Thou didst place  A second arrow in thy belt--nay, nay!  I saw it well--what was thy purpose with it?    TELL (confused).  It is the custom with all archers, sir.    GESSLER.  No, Tell, I cannot let that answer pass.  There was some other motive, well I know.  Frankly and cheerfully confess the truth;--  Whate'er it be I promise thee thy life,  Wherefore the second arrow?    TELL.                 Well, my lord,  Since you have promised not to take my life,  I will, without reserve, declare the truth.       [He draws the arrow from his belt, and fixes his eyes     sternly upon the governor.    If that my hand had struck my darling child,  This second arrow I had aimed at you,  And, be assured, I should not then have missed.    GESSLER.  Well, Tell, I promised thou shouldst have thy life;  I gave my knightly word, and I will keep it.  Yet, as I know the malice of thy thoughts,  I will remove thee hence to sure confinement,  Where neither sun nor moon shall reach thine eyes,  Thus from thy arrows I shall be secure.  Seize on him, guards, and bind him.       [They bind him.    STAUFFACHER.                     How, my lord--  How can you treat in such a way a man  On whom God's hand has plainly been revealed?    GESSLER.  Well, let us see if it will save him twice!  Remove him to my ship; I'll follow straight.  In person I will see him lodged at Kuessnacht.    ROSSELMANN.  You dare not do it. Nor durst the emperor's self,  So violate our dearest chartered rights.    GESSLER.  Where are they? Has the emperor confirmed them?  He never has. And only by obedience  Need you expect to win that favor from him.  You are all rebels 'gainst the emperor's power  And bear a desperate and rebellious spirit.  I know you all--I see you through and through.  Him do I single from amongst you now,  But in his guilt you all participate.  The wise will study silence and obedience.       [Exit, followed by BERTHA, RUDENZ, HARRAS, and attendants.     FRIESSHARDT and LEUTHOLD remain.    FURST (in violent anguish).  All's over now! He is resolved to bring  Destruction on myself and all my house.    STAUFFACHER (to Tell).  Oh, why did you provoke the tyrant's rage?    TELL.  Let him be calm who feels the pangs I felt.    STAUFFACHER.  Alas! alas! Our every hope is gone.  With you we all are fettered and enchained.    COUNTRY PEOPLE (surrounding Tell).  Our last remaining comfort goes with you!    LEUTHOLD (approaching him).  I'm sorry for you, Tell, but must obey.    TELL.  Farewell!    WALTER (clinging to him in great agony).        Oh, father, father, father dear!    TELL (pointing to Heaven).  Thy father is on high--appeal to Him!    STAUFFACHER.  Hast thou no message, Tell, to send your wife?    TELL (clasping the boy passionately to his breast).  The boy's uninjured; God will succor me!       [Tears himself suddenly away, and follows the soldiers     of the guard.          ACT IV.    SCENE I.       Eastern shore of the Lake of Lucerne; rugged and singularly     shaped rocks close the prospect to the west. The lake is     agitated, violent roaring and rushing of wind, with thunder     and lightning at intervals.       KUNZ OF GERSAU, FISHERMAN and BOY.      KUNZ.  I saw it with these eyes! Believe me, friend,  It happen'd all precisely as I've said.    FISHERMAN.  Tell, made a prisoner, and borne off to Kuessnacht?  The best man in the land, the bravest arm,  Had we resolved to strike for liberty!    KUNZ.  The Viceroy takes him up the lake in person:  They were about to go on board, as I  Left Flueelen; but still the gathering storm,  That drove me here to land so suddenly,  Perchance has hindered their abrupt departure.    FISHERMAN.  Our Tell in chains, and in the viceroy's power!  Oh, trust me, Gessler will entomb him where  He never more shall see the light of day;  For, Tell once free, the tyrant well may dread  The just revenge of one so deep incensed.    KUNZ.  The old Landamman, too--von Attinghaus--  They say, is lying at the point of death.    FISHERMAN.  Then the last anchor of our hopes gives way!  He was the only man who dared to raise  His voice in favor of the people's rights.    KUNZ.  The storm grows worse and worse. So, fare ye well!  I'll go and seek out quarters in the village.  There's not a chance of getting off to-day.                         [Exit.    FISHERMAN.  Tell dragged to prison, and the baron dead!  Now, tyranny, exalt thy insolent front--  Throw shame aside! The voice of truth is silenced,  The eye that watched for us in darkness closed,  The arm that should have struck thee down in chains!    BOY.
