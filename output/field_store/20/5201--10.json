Cover them and set them on hot coals in the chimney  corner. Let them stew for twelve hours or more, occasionally  stirring them, and renewing the coals. Next day put them up in  jars. Done in this manner they will keep till the next spring.]    Syrups may be improved in clearness, by adding to the dissolved  sugar and water, some white of egg very well beaten, allowing the  white of one egg to each pound of sugar. Boil it very hard, and  skim it well, that it may be quite clear before you put in your  fruit.      PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES.    Weigh the strawberries after you have picked off the stems. To  each pound of fruit allow a pound of loaf-sugar, which must be  powdered. Strew half of the sugar over the strawberries, and let  them stand in a cold place two or three hours. Then put them in a  preserving kettle over a slow fire, and by degrees strew on the  rest of the sugar. Boil them fifteen or twenty minutes, and skim  them well.    Put them in wide-mouthed bottles, and when cold, seal the corks.    If you wish to do them whole, take them carefully out of the  syrup, (one at a time) while boiling. Spread them to cool on large  dishes, not letting the strawberries touch each other, and when  cool, return them to the syrup, and boil them a little longer.  Repeat this several times.    Keep the bottles in dry sand, in a place that is cool and not  damp.    Gooseberries, currants, raspberries, cherries and grapes may be  done in the same manner. The stones must be taken from the  cherries (which should be morellas, or the largest and best red  cherries;) and the seeds should be extracted from the grapes with  the sharp point of a penknife. Gooseberries, grapes, and cherries,  require longer boiling than strawberries, raspberries or currants.      PRESERVED CRANBERRIES    Wash your cranberries, weigh them, and to each pound allow a pound  of loaf-sugar. Dissolve the sugar in a very little water, (about  half a pint of water to a pound of sugar) and set it on the fire  in a preserving kettle. Boil it nearly ten minutes, skimming it  well. Then put in your cranberries, and boil them slowly, till  they are quite soft, and of a fine colour.    Put them warm into your jars or glasses, and tie them up with  brandy paper, when cold.    All sorts of sweetmeats keep better in glasses, than in stone of  earthen jars. When opened for use, they should be tied up again  immediately, as exposure to the air spoils them.    Common glass tumblers are very convenient for jellies, and  preserved small fruit. White jars are better than stone or  earthen, for large fruit.      PRESERVED PUMPKIN.    Cut slices from a fine high-coloured pumpkin, and cut the slices  into chips about the thickness of a dollar. The chips should be of  an equal size, six inches in length and an inch broad. Weigh them  and allow to each pound of pumpkin chips, a pound of loaf-sugar.  Have ready a sufficient number of fine lemons, pare off the yellow  rind, and lay it aside. Cut the lemons in half, and squeeze the  juice into a bowl. Allow a gill of juice to each pound of pumpkin.    Put the pumpkin into a broad pan laying the sugar among it. Pour  the lemon-juice over it, Cover the pan, and let the pumpkin chips,  sugar and lemon-juice, set all night.    Early in the morning put the whole into a preserving pan, and boil  all together (skimming it well) till the pumpkin becomes clear and  crisp, but not till it breaks. It should have the appearance of  lemon-candy. You may if you choose, put some lemon-peel with it,  cut in very small pieces.    Half an hour's boiling (or a little more) is generally sufficient.    When it is done, take out the pumpkin, spread it On a large dish,  and strain the syrup through a bag. Put the pumpkin into your jars  or glasses, pour the syrup over it, and tie it up with brandy  paper.    If properly done, this is a very fine sweetmeat. The taste of the  pumpkin will be lost in that of the lemon and sugar, and the syrup  is particularly pleasant. It is eaten without cream, like  preserved ginger. It may be laid on puff-paste shells, after they  are baked.      PRESERVED PINE-APPLE,    Pare your pine-apples, and cut them in thick slices. Weigh the  slices and to each pound allow a pound of loaf-sugar. Dissolve the  sugar in a very small quantity of water, stir it, and set it over  the fire in a preserving-kettle. Boil it ten minutes, skimming it  well. Then put in it the pine-apple slices, and boil them till  they are clear and soft, but not till they break. About half an  hour (or perhaps less time) will suffice. Let them cool in a large  dish or pan, before you put them into your jars, which you must do  carefully, lest they break. Pour the syrup over them. Tie them up  with brandy paper.      RASPBERRY JAM.    Allow a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Mash the raspberries  and put them with the sugar into your preserving kettle. Boll it  slowly for an hour skimming it well. Tie it up with brandy paper.    All jams are made in the same manner.            APPENDIX.    MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS.      CONTENTS.

A pound of the fat of bacon or corned pork.    The marrow from the bone of the beef, \\ chopped together    A quarter of a pound of beef-suet,    /    Two bundles of pot herbs, parsley, thyme, small onions, &c.      chopped fine.    Two large bunches of sweet marjoram,\\sufficient when powdered to make    Two bunches of sweet basil,         /make four table-spoonfuls of each.    Two large nutmegs,      \\    Half an ounce of cloves  } beaten to a powder.    Half an ounce of mace,  /    One table-spoonful of salt.    One table-spoonful of pepper.    Two glasses of madeira wine.    If your a-la-mode beef is to be eaten cold, prepare it three days  before it is wanted.    Take out the bone. Fasten up the opening with skewers, and tie the  meat all round with tape. Rub it all over on both sides with salt.  A large round of beef will be more tender than a small one.    Chop the marrow and suet together. Pound the spice. Chop the  pot-herbs very fine. Pick the sweet-marjoram and sweet-basil clean  from the stalks, and rub the leaves to a powder. You must have at  least four table-spoonfuls of each. Add the pepper and salt, and  mix well together all the ingredients that compose the seasoning.    Cut the fat of the bacon or pork into pieces about a quarter of an  inch thick and two inches long. With a sharp knife make deep  incisions all over the round of beef and very near each other. Put  first a little of the seasoning into each hole, then a slip of the  bacon pressed down hard and covered with more seasoning. Pour a  little wine into each hole.    When you have thus stuffed the upper side of the beef, turn it  over and stuff in the same manner the under side. If the round is  very large, you will require a larger quantity of seasoning.    Put it in a deep baking dish, pour over it some wine, cover it,  and let it set till next morning. It will be much the better for  lying all night in the seasoning.    Next day put a little water in the dish, set it in a covered oven,  and bake or stew it gently for twelve hours at least, or more if  it is a large round. It will be much improved by stewing it in  lard. Let it remain all night in the oven.    If it is to be eaten hot at dinner, put it in to stew the evening  before, and let it cook till dinner-time next day. Stir some wine  and a beaten egg into the gravy.    If brought to table cold, cover it all over with green parsley,  and stick a large bunch of something green in the centre.    What is left will make an excellent hash the next day.      CHICKEN PUDDING    Cut up a pair of young chickens, and season them with pepper and  salt and a little mace and nutmeg. Put them into a pot with two  large spoonfuls of butter, and water enough to cover them. Stew  them gently; and when about half cooked, take them out and set  them away to cool. Pour off the gravy, and reserve it to be served  up separately.    In the mean time, make a batter as if for a pudding, of eight  table-spoonfuls of sifted flour stirred gradually into a quart of  milk, six eggs well beaten and added by degrees to the mixture,  and a very little salt. Put a layer of chicken in the bottom of a  deep dish, and pour over it some of the batter; then another layer  of chicken, and then some more batter; and so on till the dish is  full, having a cover of batter at the top. Bake it till it is  brown. Then break an egg into the gravy which you have set away,  give it a boil, and send it to table in a sauce-boat to eat with  the pudding.      A BONED TURKEY.      A large turkey.    Three sixpenny loaves of stale bread.    One pound of fresh butter.    Four eggs.    One bunch of pot-herbs, parsley, thyme, and little onions.    Two bunches of sweet marjoram.    Two bunches of sweet basil.    Two nutmegs.                   \\    Half an ounce of cloves.        }  pounded fine.    A quarter of an ounce of mace. /    A table-spoonful of salt.    A table-spoonful of pepper.    Skewers, tape, needle, and coarse thread will be wanted.    Grate the bread, and put the crusts in water to soften. Then break  them up small into the pan of crumbled bread. Cut up a pound of  butter in the pan of bread. Rub the herbs to powder, and have two  table-spoonfuls of sweet-marjoram and two of sweet basil, or more  of each if the turkey is very large.

I think he's very nice.'    'He admires you frantically. I hoped he would. That's why I wanted  you to come over on the same ship with him.'    'Polly! I had no notion you were such a schemer.'    'I would just love to see you two fix it up,' continued Lady  Wetherby, earnestly. 'He may not be what you might call a genius,  but he's a darned good sort; and all his millions help, don't  they? You don't want to overlook these millions, Claire!'    'I do like Mr Pickering.'    'Claire, he asked me if you were engaged.'    'What!'    'When I told him you weren't, he beamed. Honestly, you've only got  to lift your little finger and--Oh, good Lord, there's Algie!'    Claire looked up. A dapper, trim little man of about forty was  threading his way among the tables in their direction. It was a  year since Claire had seen Lord Wetherby, but she recognized him  at once. He had a red, weather-beaten face with a suspicion of  side-whiskers, small, pink-rimmed eyes with sandy eyebrows, the  smoothest of sandy hair, and a chin so cleanly shaven that it was  difficult to believe that hair had ever grown there. Although his  evening-dress was perfect in every detail, he conveyed a subtle  suggestion of horsiness. He reached the table and sat down without  invitation in the vacant chair.    'Pauline!' he said, sorrowfully.    'Algie!' said Lady Wetherby, tensely. 'I don't know what you've  come here for, and I don't remember asking you to sit down and put  your elbows on that table, but I want to begin by saying that I  will not be called Pauline. My name's Polly. You've got a way of  saying Pauline, as if it were a gentlemanly cuss-word, that makes  me want to scream. And while you're about it, why don't you say  how-d'you-do to Claire? You ought to remember her, she was my  bridesmaid.'    'How do you do, Miss Fenwick. Of course, I remember you perfectly.  I'm glad to see you again.'    'And now, Algie, what is it? Why have you come here?' Lord  Wetherby looked doubtfully at Claire. 'Oh, that's all right,' said  Lady Wetherby. 'Claire knows all about it--I told her.'    'Then I appeal to Miss Fenwick, if, as you say, she knows all the  facts of the case, to say whether it is reasonable to expect a man  of my temperament, a nervous, highly-strung artist, to welcome the  presence of snakes at the breakfast-table. I trust that I am not  an unreasonable man, but I decline to admit that a long, green  snake is a proper thing to keep about the house.'    'You had no right to strike the poor thing.'    'In that one respect I was perhaps a little hasty. I happened to  be stirring my tea at the moment his head rose above the edge of  the table. I was not entirely myself that morning. My nerves were  somewhat disordered. I had lain awake much of the night planning a  canvas.'    'Planning a what?'    'A canvas--a picture.'    Lady Wetherby turned to Claire.    'I want you to listen to Algie, Claire. A year ago he did not know  one end of a paint-brush from the other. He didn't know he had any  nerves. If you had brought him the artistic temperament on a plate  with a bit of watercress round it, he wouldn't have recognized it.  And now, just because he's got a studio, he thinks he has a right  to go up in the air if you speak to him suddenly and run about the  place hitting snakes with teaspoons as if he were Michelangelo!'    'You do me an injustice. It is true that as an artist I developed  late--But why should we quarrel? If it will help to pave the way  to a renewed understanding between us, I am prepared to apologize  for striking Clarence. That is conciliatory, I think, Miss  Fenwick?'    'Very.'    'Miss Fenwick considers my attitude conciliatory.'    'It's something,' admitted Lady Wetherby, grudgingly.    Lord Wetherby drained the whisky-and-soda which Dudley Pickering  had left behind him, and seemed to draw strength from it, for he  now struck a firmer note.    'But, though expressing regret for my momentary loss of self-control,  I cannot recede from the position I have taken up as regards the  essential unfitness of Clarence's presence in the home.'    Lady Wetherby looked despairingly at Claire.    'The very first words I heard Algie speak, Claire, were at  Newmarket during the three o'clock race one May afternoon. He was  hanging over the rail, yelling like an Indian, and what he was  yelling was, \"Come on, you blighter, come on! By the living jingo,  Brickbat wins in a walk!\" And now he's talking about receding from  essential positions! Oh, well, he wasn't an artist then!'    'My dear Pau--Polly. I am purposely picking my words on the  present occasion in order to prevent the possibility of further  misunderstandings. I consider myself an ambassador.'    'You would be shocked if you knew what I consider you!'    'I am endeavouring to the best of my ability--'    'Algie, listen to me! I am quite calm at present, but there's no  knowing how soon I may hit you with a chair if you don't come to  earth quick and talk like an ordinary human being. What is it that  you are driving at?'    'Very well, it's this: I'll come home if you get rid of that  snake.'    'Never!'    'It's surely not much to ask of you, Polly?'    'I won't!'    Lord Wetherby sighed.    'When I led you to the altar,' he said, reproachfully, 'you  promised to love, honour, and obey me. I thought at the time it  was a bit of swank!'    Lady Wetherby's manner thawed. She became more friendly.    'When you talk like that, Algie, I feel there's hope for you after  all. That's how you used to talk in the dear old days when you'd  come to me to borrow half-a-crown to put on a horse! Listen, now  that at last you seem to be getting more reasonable; I wish I  could make you understand that I don't keep Clarence for sheer  love of him. He's a commercial asset. He's an advertisement. You  must know that I have got to have something to--'    'I admit that may be so as regards the monkey, Eustace. Monkeys as  aids to publicity have, I believe, been tested and found valuable  by other artistes. I am prepared to accept Eustace, but the snake  is worthless.'    'Oh, you don't object to Eustace, then?'    'I do strongly, but I concede his uses.'    'You would live in the same house as Eustace?'    'I would endeavour to do so. But not in the same house as Eustace  and Clarence.'    There was a pause.    'I don't know that I'm so stuck on Clarence myself,' said Lady  Wetherby, weakly.    'My darling!'    'Wait a minute. I've not said I would get rid of him.'    'But you will?'    Lady Wetherby's hesitation lasted but a moment. 'All right, Algie.  I'll send him to the Zoo to-morrow.'    'My precious pet!'    A hand, reaching under the table, enveloped Claire's in a loving  clasp.    From the look on Lord Wetherby's face she supposed that he was  under the delusion that he was bestowing this attention on his  wife.    'You know, Algie, darling,' said Lady Wetherby, melting completely,  'when you get that yearning note in your voice I just flop and take  the full count.'    'My sweetheart, when I saw you doing that Dream of  What's-the-girl's-bally-name dance just now, it was all I could  do to keep from rushing out on to the floor and hugging you.'    'Algie!'    'Polly!'    'Do you mind letting go of my hand, please, Lord Wetherby?' said  Claire, on whom these saccharine exchanges were beginning to have  a cloying effect.    For a moment Lord Wetherby seemed somewhat confused, but, pulling  himself together, he covered his embarrassment with a pomposity  that blended poorly with his horsy appearance.    'Married life, Miss Fenwick,' he said, 'as you will no doubt  discover some day, must always be a series of mutual compromises,  of cheerful give and take. The lamp of love--'    His remarks were cut short by a crash at the other end of the  room. There was a sharp cry and the splintering of glass. The  place was full of a sudden, sharp confusion. They jumped up with  one accord. Lady Wetherby spilled her iced coffee; Lord Wetherby  dropped the lamp of love. Claire, who was nearest the pillar that  separated them from the part of the restaurant where the accident  had happened, was the first to see what had taken place.    A large man, dancing with a large girl, appeared to have charged  into a small waiter, upsetting him and his tray and the contents  of his tray. The various actors in the drama were now engaged in  sorting themselves out from the ruins. The man had his back toward  her, and it seemed to Claire that there was something familiar  about that back. Then he turned, and she recognized Lord Dawlish.    She stood transfixed. For a moment surprise was her only emotion.  How came Bill to be in America? Then other feelings blended with  her surprise. It is a fact that Lord Dawlish was looking  singularly uncomfortable.    Claire's eyes travelled from Bill to his partner and took in with  one swift feminine glance her large, exuberant blondeness. There  is no denying that, seen with a somewhat biased eye, the Good  Sport resembled rather closely a poster advertising a revue.    Claire returned to her seat. Lord and Lady Wetherby continued to  talk, but she allowed them to conduct the conversation without her  assistance.    'You're very quiet, Claire,' said Polly.    'I'm thinking.'    'A very good thing, too, so they tell me. I've never tried it  myself. Algie, darling, he was a bad boy to leave his nice home,  wasn't he? He didn't deserve to have his hand held.'          8      It had been a great night for Nutty Boyd. If the vision of his  sister Elizabeth, at home at the farm speculating sadly on the  whereabouts of her wandering boy, ever came before his mental eye  he certainly did not allow it to interfere with his appreciation  of the festivities.
