[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4667"],[0,"Seven Wives and Seven Prisons (#12)"],[1," in the town instead  of on the farm, so that I could open an office and practice there.    So we went back to her home again, but before I completed my plans for  settling down in Keene, Mary and I had several quarrels which were worse  than mere ordinary matrimonial squabbles. Two or three young men in  Keene, with whom I had become acquainted, twitted me with marrying Mary,  and told me enough about her to convince me that her former life had not  been altogether what it should have been. I had been too blinded by  her beauty when I first saw her in Brattleboro, to notice how extremely  easily she was won. Her parents, too, were wonderfully willing, if not  eager, to marry her to me. All these things came to me now, and we had  some very lively conversations on the subject, in which the old folks  joined, siding with their daughter of course. By and by the girl went  to Keene and made a complaint that she was afraid of her life, and I was  brought before a magistrate and put under bonds of four hundred dollars  to keep the peace. I gave a man fifty dollars to go bail for me, and  then, instead of going out to the farm with Mary, I went to the hotel in  Keene.    The well-known character of the girl, my marriage to her, the brief  honeymoon, the quarrels and the cause of the same, were all too tempting  material not to be served up in a paragraph, and as I expected and  feared, out came the whole story in the Keene paper.    This was copied in other journals, and presently came letters to the  family and to other persons in the place, giving some account of my  former adventures and marriages. Of this however I knew nothing, till  one day, while I was at the hotel, I was suddenly arrested for bigamy.  But I was used to this kind of arrest by this time, and I went before  the magistrate with my mind made up that I must suffer again for my  matrimonial monomania.    It was just after dinner when I was arrested, and the examination, which  was a long one, continued till evening. Every one in the magistrate's  office was tired out with it, I especially, and so I took a favorable  opportunity to leave the premises. I bolted for the door, ran down  stairs into the street, and was well out of town before the astonished  magistrate, stunned constable, and amazed spectators realized that I had  gone.    Whether they than set out in pursuit of me I never knew, I only know  they did not catch me. I ran till I came to the house of a farmer whom  I had been attending for some ailment, and hurriedly narrating the  situation, I offered him one hundred dollars if he would secrete me till  the hue and cry was over and I could safely get away. I think he would  have done it from good will, but the hundred dollar bill I offered him  made the matter sure. He put my money into his pocket, and he put me  into a dark closet, not more than five feet square, and locked me in.    I stayed in that man's house, never going out of doors, for more than  three weeks, and did my best to board out my hundred dollars. The day  after my flight the whole neighborhood was searched, that is, the woods,  roads, and adjacent villages. They never thought of looking in a house,  particularly in a house so near the town; and, as I heard from my  protector, they telegraphed and advertised far and near for me.    I anticipated all this, and for this very reason I remained quietly  where I was, in an unsuspected house, and with my dark closet to retire  to whenever any one came in; and gossiping neighbors coming in almost  every hour, kept me in that hole nearly half the time. I heard my own  story told in that house at least fifty times, and in fifty different  ways.    At last, when I thought it was safe, one night my host harnessed up his  horses and carried me some miles on my way to Concord. He drove as far  as he dared, for he wanted to get back home by daylight, so that his  expedition might excite no suspicion. Twenty miles away from Keene he  set me down in the road, and, bidding him \"good-bye,\" I began my march  toward Concord. When I arrived there, almost the first man I saw in the  street was a doctor from Keene. I did not think he saw me, but he did,  as I soon found out, for while I was waiting at the depot to take the  cars to the north, I was arrested.    The Keene doctor owed me a grudge for interfering, as he deemed it; with  his regular practice, and the moment he saw me he put an officer on my  trail. I thought it was safe here to take the cars, for I was footsore  and weary, nor did I get away from Keene as fast and as far as I wanted  to. I should have succeeded but for that doctor.    When the officer brought me before a justice, the doctor was a willing  witness to declare that I was a fugitive from justice, and he stated the  circumstances of my escape. So I was sent back to Keene under charge of  the very officer who arrested me at the depot.    I would not give this officer's name if I could remember it, but he was  a fine fellow, and was exceedingly impressible. For instance, on our  arrival at Keene, he allowed me to go to the hotel and pack my trunk to  be forwarded to Meredith Bridge by express. He then handed me over to  the authorities, and I was immediately taken before the magistrate from  whom I had previously escaped, the Concord officer accompanying the  Keene officer who had charge of me.    The examination was short; I was bound over in the sum of one thousand  dollars to take my trial for bigamy. On my way to jail I persuaded the  Concord officer--with a hundred dollar bill which I slipped into his  hand--to induce the other officer to go with me to the hotel under  pretense of looking after my things, and getting what would be necessary  for my comfort in jail. My Concord friend kept the other officer down  stairs--in the bar-room, I presume--while I went to my room. I put a  single shirt in my pocket; the distance from my window to the ground  was not more than twelve or fifteen feet, and I let myself down from the  window sill and then dropped.    I was out of the yard, into the street, and out of town in less than no  time. It was already evening, and everything favored my escape. I had  no idea of spending months in jail at Keene, and months more, perhaps  years, in the New Hampshire State Prison. All my past bitter experiences  of wretched prison life urged me to flight.    And fly I did. No stopping at the friendly farmer's, my former refuge,  this time; that would be too great a risk. No showing of myself in any  town or village where the telegraph might have conveyed a description  of my person. I traveled night and day on foot, and more at night than  during the day, taking by-roads, lying by in the woods, sleeping in  barns, and getting my meals in out-of-the-way farm houses.    I had plenty of money; but this kind of travelling is inexpensive, and,  paying twenty-five cents for one or two meals a day, as I dared to get  them, and sleeping in barns or under haystacks for nothing, my purse  did not materially diminish. I was a good walker, and in the course of  a week from the night when I left Keene, I found myself in Biddeford,  Maine.    There was some sense of security in being in another State, and here I  ventured to take the cars for Portland, where I staid two days, sending  in the meantime for my trunk from Meredith Bridge, and getting it by  express. Of course it went to a fictitious address at Meredith, and it  came to me under the same name which I had registered in my hotel at  Portland.    I did not mean to stay there long. My departure was hastened by the  advice of a man who knew me, and told he also knew my New Hampshire  scrape, and that I had better leave Portland as soon as possible. Half  an hour after this good advice I was on my way by cars to Canada. In  Canada I stayed in different small towns near the border, and \"kept  moving,\" till I thought the New Hampshire matter had blown over a  little, or at least till they had given me up as a \"gone case,\" and I  then reappeared in Troy.

From Troy I went, first to Newburyport, Mass., where I had some  business, and where I remained a week, and then returned to Troy again.  Next I went to Bennington, Vt., to sell medicines and practice, and I  found enough to occupy me there for full two months. From Bennington to  Rutland, selling medicines on the way, and at Rutland I intended to stay  for some time. My oldest son was there well established in the medical  business, and I thought that both of us together might extend a wide  practice and make a great deal of money.    No doubt we might have done so, if I had minded my medical business  only, and had let matrimonial matters alone. I had just got rid of a  worthless woman in New Hampshire with a very narrow escape from State  prison. But, as my readers know by this time, all experience, even the  bitterest, was utterly thrown away upon me; I seemed to get out of one  scrape only to walk, with my eyes open, straight into another.    At the hotel where I went to board, there was temporarily staying a  woman, about thirty-two years old, Margaret Bradly, by name, who kept a  large millinery establishment in town. I became acquainted with her, and  she told me that she owned a house in the place, in which she and her  mother lived; but her mother had gone away on a visit, and as she did  not like to live alone she had come to the hotel to stay for a few days  till her mother returned. Margaret was a fascinating woman; she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4671"],[0,"The Story of the Pony Express (#12)"],[1," would soon arrive, and there was nobody to take his regular run. So  after resting an hour and a half, he resumed the saddle and hurried back  along his old trail, over the Sierras to Friday's Station. Then \"Bob\"  rested after having ridden three hundred and eighty miles with scarcely  eleven hours of lay-off, and within a very few hours of regular schedule  time all the way. In speaking of this performance afterwards, Haslam[31]  modestly admitted that he was \"rather tired,\" but that \"the excitement  of the trip had braced him up to stand the journey.\"    The most widely known of all the pony riders is William F. Cody--usually  called \"Bill,\" who in early life resided in Kansas and was  raised amid the exciting scenes of frontier life. Cody had an unusually  dangerous route between Red Buttes and Three Crossings. The latter place  was on the Sweetwater River, and derived its name from the fact that the  stream which followed the bed of a rocky canon, had to be crossed three  times within a space of sixty yards. The water coming down from the  mountains, was always icy cold and the current swift, deep, and  treacherous. The whole bottom of the canon was often submerged, and in  attempting to follow its course along the channel of the stream, both  horse and rider were liable to plunge at any time into some abysmal  whirlpool. Besides the excitement which the Three Crossings and an  Indian country furnished, Cody's trail ran through a region that was  often frequented by desperadoes. Furthermore, he had to ford the North  Platte at a point where the stream was half a mile in width and in  places twelve feet deep. Though the current was at times slow, dangers  from quicksand were always to be feared on these prairie rivers. Cody,  then but a youth, had to surmount these obstacles and cover his trip at  an average of fifteen miles an hour.    Cody entered the Pony Express service just after the line had been  organized. At Julesburg he met George Chrisman, an old friend who was  head wagon-master for Russell, Majors, and Waddell's freighting  department. Chrisman was at the time acting as an agent for the express  line, and, out of deference to the youth, he hired him temporarily to  ride the division then held by a pony man named Trotter. It was a short  route, one of the shortest on the system, aggregating only forty-five  miles, and with three relays of horses each way. Cody, who had been  accustomed to the saddle all his young life, had no trouble in following  the schedule, but after keeping the run several weeks, the lad was  relieved by the regular incumbent, and then went east, to Leavenworth,  where he fell in with another old friend, Lewis Simpson, then acting as  wagon boss and fitting up at Atchison a wagon train of supplies for the  old stage line at Fort Laramie and points beyond. Acting through  Simpson, Cody obtained a letter of recommendation from Mr. Russell, the  head of the firm, addressed to Jack Slade, Superintendent of the  division between Julesburg and Rocky Ridge, with headquarters at  Horseshoe Station, thirty-six miles west of Fort Laramie, in what is now  Wyoming. Armed with this letter, young Cody accompanied Simpson's  wagon-train to Laramie, and soon found Superintendent Slade. The  superintendent, observing the lad's tender years and frail stature, was  skeptical of his ability to serve as a pony rider; but on learning that  Cody was the boy who had already given satisfactory service as a  substitute some months before, at once engaged him and assigned him to  the perilous run of seventy-six miles between Red Buttes and Three  Crossings. For some weeks all went well. Then, one day when he reached  his terminal at Three Crossings, Cody found that his successor who was  to have taken the mail out, had been killed the night before. As there  was no extra rider available, it fell to young Cody to fill the dead  courier's place until a successor could be procured. The lad was  undaunted and anxious for the added responsibility. Within a moment he  was off on a fresh horse for Rocky Ridge, eighty-five miles away.  Notwithstanding the dangers and great fatigue of the trip, Cody rode  safely from Three Crossings to his terminal and returned with the  eastbound mail, going back over his own division and into Red Buttes  without delay or mishap--an aggregate run of three hundred and  twenty-two miles. This was probably the longest continuous performance  without formal rest period in the history of this or any other courier  service.    Not long afterward, Cody was chased by a band of Sioux Indians while  making one of his regular trips. The savages were armed with revolvers,  and for a few minutes made it lively for the young messenger. But the  superior speed and endurance of his steed soon told; lying flat on the  animal's neck, he quickly distanced his assailants and thundered into  Sweetwater, the next station, ahead of schedule. Here he found--as so  often happened in the history of the express service--that the place  had been raided, the keeper slain, and the horses driven off. There was  nothing to do but drive his tired pony twelve miles further to Ploutz  Station, where he got a fresh horse, briefly reported what he had  observed, and completed his run without mishap.    On another occasion[32] it became mysteriously rumored that a certain  Pony Express pouch would carry a large sum of currency. Knowing that  there was great likelihood of some bandits or \"road agents\" as they were  commonly called getting wind of the consignment and attempting a holdup,  Cody hit upon a little emergency ruse. He provided himself with an extra  mochila which he stuffed with waste papers and placed over the saddle in  the regular position. The pouch containing the currency was hidden  under a special saddle blanket. With his customary revolver loaded and  ready, Cody then started. His suspicions were soon confirmed, for on  reaching a particularly secluded spot, two highwaymen stepped from  concealment, and with leveled rifles compelled the boy to stop, at the  same time demanding the letter pouch. Holding up his hands as ordered,  Cody began to remonstrate with the thugs for robbing the express, at the  same time declaring to them that they would hang for their meanness if  they carried out their plans. In reply to this they told Cody that they  would take their own chances. They knew what he carried and they wanted  it. They had no particular desire to harm him, but unless he handed over  the pouch without delay they would shoot him full of holes, and take it  anyhow. Knowing that to resist meant certain death Cody began slowly to  unfasten the dummy pouch, still protesting with much indignation.  Finally, after having loosed it, he raised the pouch and hurled it at  the head off the nearest outlaw, who dodged, half amused at the young  fellow's spirit. Both men were thus taken slightly off their guard, and  that instant the rider acted like a flash. Whipping out his revolver, he  disabled the farther villain; and before the other, who had stooped to  recover the supposed mail sack, could straighten up or use a weapon,  Cody dug the spurs into his horse, knocked him down, rode over him and  was gone. Before the half-stunned robber could recover himself to shoot,  horse and rider were out of range and running like mad for the next  station, where they arrived ahead of schedule.    The following is a partial list, so far as is known[33], of the men who  rode the Pony Express and contributed to the lasting fame of the  enterprise:      Baughn, Melville    Beatley, Jim    \"Boston\"    Boulton, William    Brink, James W.    Burnett, John    Bucklin, Jimmy    Carr, William    Carrigan, William    Cates, Bill    Clark, Jimmy    Cliff, Charles    Cody, William F.    Egan, Major    Ellis, J. K.    Faust, H. J.    Fisher, John    Frey, Johnnie    Gentry, Jim    Gilson, Jim    Hamilton, Sam    Haslam, Robert    Hogan (first name missing)    Huntington, Let    \"Irish Tom\"    James, William    Jenkins, Will D.    Kelley, Jay G.    Keetley, Jack    \"Little Yank\"    Martin, Bob    McCall, J. G.    McDonald, James    McNaughton, Jim    Moore, Jim    Perkins, Josh    Rand, Theodore    Richardson, Johnson    Riles, Bart    Rising, Don C.    Roff, Harry    Spurr, George    Thacher, George    Towne, George    Wallace, Henry    Westcott, Dan    Zowgaltz, Jose.    Many of these men were rough and unlettered. Many died deaths of  violence. The bones of many lie in unknown graves. Some doubtless lie  unburied somewhere in the great West, in the winning of which their  lives were lost. Yet be it always remembered, that in the history of the  American nation they played an important part. They were bold-hearted  citizen knights to whom is due the honors of uncrowned kings.        [29] Afterwards named Fort Churchill. This ride took place in the summer  of 1860.    [30] Some reports say that Richardson was stricken with fear. That he  was probably suffering from overwrought nerves, resulting from excessive  risks which his run had involved, is a more correct inference. This is  the only case on record of a pony messenger failing to respond to duty,  unless killed or disabled.    [31] After the California Pony Express was abandoned, Bob rode for Wells  Fargo & Co., between Friday's Station and Virginia City, Nevada, a  distance of one hundred miles. He seems to have enjoyed horseback  riding, for he made this roundtrip journey in twenty-four hours. When  the Central Pacific R. R. was built, and this pony line abandoned,  Haslam rode for six months a twenty-three mile division between Virginia  City and Reno, traveling the distance in less than one hour. To  accomplish this feat, he used a relay of fifteen horses. He was  afterwards transfered to Idaho where he continued in a similar capacity  on a one hundred mile run before quitting the service for a less  exciting vocation.
