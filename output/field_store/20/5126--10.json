Plans so simple on paper do not always \"pan out\" as  confidently expected and a more odious job, or one which entailed more  hard work, than prospecting with condensers I have not had to undertake.  \"Prospecting\" is generally taken to mean searching for gold. In Western  Australia in the hot weather it resolves itself into a continual battle  for water, with the very unlikely contingency that, in the hunt for a  drink, one may fall up against a nugget of gold or a gold-bearing quartz  reef.    On November 10th we made a start from Coolgardie, and, travelling along  the Twenty-five Mile road for some fifteen miles, we branched off in an  easterly direction, to try some country where I had previously found  \"colours\" of gold, when journeying from Kurnalpi to the Twenty-five Mile.  Finding that in the meantime others had been there and pegged out leases  and claims, we passed on and set up our condensers on the \"Wind and Water\"  lake, and began to get an inkling that our job was not to be of the  pleasantest.    More than one hole six to fifteen feet deep had to be sunk before we  struck any water. To lessen the labour we at first dug our shafts near the  margin of the lake; this proving unsuccessful we were forced further and  further out, until our efforts were rewarded by a plentiful supply, but  alas! some three hundred yards from the shore. This necessitated the  carrying of wood from the margin of the lake to the condensers. The  boilers required constant attention day and night, the fires had to be  stoked, and the water stored as it slowly trickled from the cooling tray.  Thus the duties of the twenty-four hours consisted in chopping and  carrying wood, watching the condensers, attending to the camels,  occasionally sleeping and eating, and prospecting for gold in spare time.  I think my readers will readily understand that it was hard indeed to find  much time to devote to the proper object of the expedition, however  willing we were to do so.    There were one or two others engaged on the same job at that lake, and  from one party Czar sneaked a cheap drink by thrusting his head through  the opening in the lid of a large two-hundred-gallon tank. His peculiar  position was specially adapted to the administration of a sound beating,  nor did the infuriated owner of the water fail to take advantage of the  situation.    With our tanks filled and our camels watered, we set forth from the lake  on November 21st, having prospected what country there was in its  immediate neighbourhood. The heat was intense, and walking, out of  training as we were, was dry work; our iron casks being new, gave a most  unpleasant zinc taste to the water, which made us all feel sick.  Unpleasant as this was, yet it served the useful purpose of checking the  consumption of water. Our route lay past the \"Broad Arrow\" to a hill that  I took to be Mount Yule, and from there almost due east to Giles'  Pinnacles. Our camels were most troublesome; young, nervous, and unused  to us or to each other, they would wander miles during the night, and give  two of us a walk of three or four miles in the morning; before the day's  work began. Two were not content with merely wandering, but persisted in  going in one direction, the third in another.    One morning Conley and Egan were following their tracks each in a  different quarter. I meanwhile climbed a neighbouring hill to spy out the  land ahead, hoping to see the white glitter of a salt lake, for we were in  likely country, ironstone blows, quartz, and diorite giving evidence of  its probable auriferous nature; we were therefore anxious to find water to  enable us to test it. On return to camp, after an absence of not more than  half an hour, I was astonished to see it surrounded by the tracks of  numerous \"black-fellows.\" I guessed they had paid us a visit for no good  purpose, and was hardly surprised when I found that they had not only  stolen all our flour, but added insult to injury by scattering it about  the ground. Not daring to leave the camp, lest in my absence they should  return and take all our provisions, I was unable to follow the thieves,  and had to wait in patience the return of the camels.    So far had they wandered in their hobbles, that by the time we were ready  to start the blacks must have gained too great an advantage in distance to  make it worth our while to follow them; nor, since they started off in the  direction from which we had come, was it any use tracking them with the  hope of getting water. So we pushed on eastwards, through open forest of  gums, scrubs, and thickets, broken by occasional small plains of saltbush,  seeing no signs of water or lake, when presently we entered a belt of  sandy desert--rolling sandhills, spinifex-clad, with occasional thickets  of mulga and mallee.    Monotonous work it was, dragging the wretched camels for eight to ten  hours at a stretch, inciting them to fresh exertions by curses and  beatings, kindness and caresses, in turn. In some respects a camel  resembles a bullock; not only does he chew his cud, but he loves to be  sworn at; no self-respecting ox will do an ounce of work until his  driver has flung over him a cloud of the most lurid and hair-raising  language. Now, a camel draws the line at blasphemy, but rejoices in the  ordinary oaths and swear-words of every-day life in much the same way as a  retriever. There is no animal more susceptible to kindness than a camel;  but in a sandy sea of scrub with the blazing sun almost boiling the water,  milk-like from zinc, in the tanks, loads dragged this way and that,  boilers and pipes of condensers rolling, now forward, now back, eventually  to slip clattering down, bearing camel and all to the ground--with these  and other trials kindness was not in us.    Soon after sunset on the 27th, from the branches of a high gum tree we  sighted the Pinnacles almost dead on our course; and late that night we  reached the lake, and found to our joy a condenser already established, by  means of which two men earned a precarious livelihood by selling water to  travellers--for these lakes were on the direct track from Kurnalpi to the  Mount Margaret district. Thus enabled to assuage the seven days' thirst of  the camels forthwith, at the cost of a shilling per gallon, we lost no  time in setting up our own plant, and were fortunate in finding water  and wood easy of access. The next four days were spent in prospecting the  surrounding country, but no gold rewarded our efforts, though numerous  reefs and blows of quartz were to be seen in the hills which the lake  nearly surrounds.    Whilst camped here, I took the opportunity of breaking in Satan as a  riding-camel, and found him at first a most untameable customer, trying  all sorts of dodges to get the better of me. Twisting round his neck he  would grab at my leg; then, rolling, he would unseat and endeavour to roll  on me; finally tiring of these tricks he would gallop off at full speed,  and run my leg against a tree, or do his best to sweep me off by an  overhanging branch, until I felt satisfied that he had been rightly named.  At last he realised that I was master, and after that I hardly remember  one occasion on which he gave any trouble; for the three years that I  afterwards possessed him, we were the best of friends, and he the most  gentle and biddable of beasts. Alas! that I should have had to end his  days with a bullet, and leave his bones to be picked by the dingoes of the  Great Sandy Desert.    Failing to find any gold, and being in need of flour, we made south to  Kurnalpi, through country flat and uninteresting, and arrived at that camp  just in time to secure the last two bags of flour. The town was almost  deserted, and had none of the lively and busy appearance that it presented  when I had last seen it. All who saw us praised our equipment and  forethought in having portable condensers. I am not quite sure that we  agreed with them.    Hearing that some promising country existed near Lake Roe, I decided to  make for that place, and more particularly for a small rock-hole named  Beri, at the west end of the lake. Very rough, stony hills covered with  dense scrub surround Kurnalpi on the south; once across these, flat, open  country of saltbush and samphire, rapidly changing into salt-swamp, made  travelling easy; passing over another low range of diorite, from which we  got an extensive view of Lake Lapage to the west and Lake Roe to the east,  we reached Beri, hitting off the rock with so much accuracy that even  Paddy Egan was surprised into praise of the compass. For some bushmen, be  it known, can neither understand nor appreciate the use of a compass, and,  being quite capable of finding their way back, are content to wander forth  into the bush with no guide but the sun, taking no notes of the country,  no record of their day's march, and making no observations to help either  themselves or anybody else; unable to say where they have been, how they  got there, or how they got home again. Some men have a natural instinct  for direction, and I know some who could start, say from Coolgardie, to  ride seventy miles east and return, then perhaps sixty to the north, and  from that point ride across to their seventy-mile point with great  ease and certainty, having no notion of the distance or point of the  compass.    A good many prospectors, depending on their black-boys almost entirely,  wander from one range of hills to another, dodge here and there for water,  keep no count or reckoning, and only return by the help of their guide  when the \"tucker-bags\" are empty; others make a practice of standing two  sticks in the ground on camping at night, to remind them of the course  they have travelled during the day and must resume in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4985"],[0,"Ruth Fielding of the Red Mill; Or, Jasper Parloe's Secret (#12)"],[1,"smart. I could make use of it I'm a poor man, an' I  could use it nicely,\" admitted the sly and furtive Parloe.    \"I haven't got so much money now,\" growled the boy.    \"Yeou kin get it, I warrant.\"    \"I suppose I can.\" He drew his purse from his pocket. \"I've got three  dollars and a half here. I'll have the rest for you on Monday.\"    \"Quite correct,\" said Jasper Parloe, clutching eagerly at the money.  \"I'll trust ye till then--oh, yes! I'll trust ye till then.\"      CHAPTER XIV     JUST A MATTER OF A DRESS    \"Well, I really believe, Tommy Cameron!\" cried his sister Helen, when  he overtook the girls and Reno, swinging the basket recklessly, \"that  you are developing a love for low company. I don't see how you can  bear to talk with that Jasper Parloe.\"    \"I don't see how I can, either,\" muttered Tom, and he was rather  silent--for him--until they were well off the road and the incident  at the bridge was some minutes behind them.    But the day was such a glorious one, and the fields and woods were so  beautiful, that no healthy boy could long be gloomy. Besides, Tom  Cameron had assured his sister that he thought Ruth Fielding \"just  immense,\" and he was determined to give the girl of the Red Mill as  pleasant a time as possible.    He worked like a Trojan to gather buttercups, and after they had eaten  the luncheon old Babette had put up for them (and it was the very  nicest and daintiest luncheon that Ruth Fielding had ever tasted) he  told the girls to remain seated on the flat stone he had found for  them and weave the foundation for the pillow while he picked bushels  upon bushels of buttercups.    \"You'll need a two-horse load, anyway to have enough for a pillow of  the size Nell has planned,\" he said, grinning. \"And perhaps she'll  finish it if you help her, Ruth. She's always trying to do some big  thing and 'falling down' on it.\"    \"That's not so, Master Sauce-box!\" cried his sister.    Tom went off laughing, and the two girls set to work on the great mass  of buttercups they had already picked. They grew so large, and were so  dewey and golden, that a more brilliant bed of color one could scarce  imagine than the pillow, as it began to grow under the dexterous hands  of Helen and Ruth. And, being alone together now, they began to grow  confidential.    \"And how does the Ogre treat you?\" asked Helen. \"I thought, when I  came this morning, that you had been feeling badly.\"    \"I am not very happy,\" admitted Ruth.    \"It's that horrid Ogre!\" cried Helen.    \"It isn't right to call Uncle Jabez names,\" said Ruth, quietly. \"He is  greatly to be pitied, I do believe. And just now, particularly so.\"    \"You mean because of the loss of that cash-box?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Do you suppose there was much in it?\"    \"He told me that it contained every cent he had saved in all these  years.\"    \"My!\" cried Helen. \"Then he must have lost a fortune! He has been a  miser for forty years, so they say.\"    \"I do not know about that,\" Ruth pursued. \"He is harsh and--and he  seems to be very selfish. He--he says I can go to school, though.\"    \"Well, I should hope so!\" cried Helen.    \"But I don't know that I can go,\" Ruth continued, shaking her head.    \"For pity's sake I why not?\" asked her friend.    Then, out came the story of the lost trunk. Nor could Ruth keep back  the tears as she told her friend about Uncle Jabez's cruelty.    \"Oh, oh, oh!\" cried Helen, almost weeping herself. \"The mean, mean  thing! No, I won't call him Ogre again; he isn't as good as an Ogre.  I--I don't know what to call him!\"    \"Calling him names won't bring back my trunk, Helen,\" sobbed Ruth.    \"That's so. I--I'd make him pay for it! I'd make him get me dresses  for those that were lost.\"    \"Uncle is giving me a home; I suppose he will give me to wear all that  he thinks I need. But I shall have to wear this dress to school, and  it will soon not be fit to wear anywhere else.\"    \"It's just too mean for anything, Ruth! I just wish--\"    What Miss Cameron wished she did not proceed to explain. She stopped  and bit her lip, looking at her friend all the time and nodding. Ruth  was busily wiping her eyes and did not notice the very wise expression  on Helen's face.    \"Look out! here comes Tom,\" whispered Helen, suddenly, and Ruth made a  last dab at her eyes and put away her handkerchief in a hurry.    \"Say! ain't you ever going to get that thing done?\" demanded Tom.  \"Seems to me you haven't done anything at all since I was here last.\"    The girls became very busy then and worked swiftly until the pillow  was completed. By that time it was late afternoon and they started  homeward. Ruth separated from Helen and Tom at the main road and  walked alone toward the Red Mill. She came to the bridge, which was at  the corner of her uncle's farm, and climbed the stile, intending to  follow the path up through the orchard to the rear of the house--the  same path by which she and her friends had started on their little  jaunt in the morning.    The brook which ran into the river, and bounded this lower end of Mr.  Potter's place, was screened by clumps of willows. Just beyond the  first group of saplings Ruth heard a rough voice say:    \"And I tell you to git out! Go on the other side of the crick, Jasper  Parloe, if ye wanter fish. That ain't my land, but this is.\"    \"Ain't ye mighty brash, Jabe?\" demanded the snarling voice of Parloe,  and Ruth knew the first speaker to be her uncle. \"Who are yeou ter  drive me away?\"    \"The last time ye was at the mill I lost something--I lost more than  I kin afford to lose again,\" continued Uncle Jabez. \"I don't say ye  took it. They tell me the flood took it. But I'm going to know the  right of it some time, and if you know more about it than you ought--\"    \"What air ye talkin' about, Jabe Potter?\" shrilled Parloe. \"I've lost  money by you; ye ain't never paid me for the last month I worked for  ye.\"    \"Ye paid yerself--ye paid yerself,\" said Jabe, tartly. \"And if ye  stole once ye would again--\"    \"Now stop right there, Jabe Potter!\" cried Parloe, and Ruth knew that  he had stepped closer to Mr. Potter, and was speaking in a trembling  rage. \"Don't ye intermate an' insinerate; for if ye do, I kin fling  out some insinerations likewise. Yeou jest open yer mouth about me  stealin' an' I'll put a flea in old man Cameron's ear. Ha! Ye know  what I mean. Better hev a care, Jabe Potter--better hev a care!\"    There was silence. Her uncle made no reply, and Ruth, fearing she  would be seen, and not wishing to be thought an eavesdropper (although  the conversation had so surprised and terrified her that she had not  thought what she did, before) the girl ran lightly up the hill,  leaving the two old men to their wrangle. When Uncle Jabez came in to  supper that evening his scowl was heavier than usual, if that were  possible, and he did not speak to either Ruth or Aunt Alvirah all the  evening.      CHAPTER XV     IN SCHOOL    Ruth thought it all over, and she came to this conclusion: Uncle Jabez  had given his permission--albeit a grumpy one--and she would begin  school on Monday. The black cloth dress that was so shabby and would  look so odd and proverty-stricken among the frocks of the other girls  (for she had watched them going to and from school, and already knew  some of them to speak to) would have to be worn, if possible, through  the term. Perhaps Uncle Jabez might notice how shabby she looked,  finally, and give her something more appropriate to wear. Especially  as it had been through him that her other frocks were lost.    But it was not an easy thing to face a whole schoolroom full of girls  and boys--and most of them strangers to her--looking so \"dowdyish.\"  Ruth's love of pretty things was born in her. She had always taken  pride in her appearance, and she felt her shortcomings in this line  quicker and more acutely than most girls of her age.    She faced the school on Monday morning and found it not so hard as she  had supposed. Miss Cramp welcomed her kindly, and put her through  quite a thorough examination to decide her grade. The Darrowtown  schools had been so good that Ruth was able to take a high place in  this one, and the teacher seated her among the most advanced of her  pupils, although Ruth was younger than some of them.    The fact that Ruth was well grounded in the same studies that the  scholars at this district school were engaged in, made a difficulty  for her at the start. But she did not know it then. She only knew that  Miss Cramp, seating her pupils according to their grade, sent her to  an empty seat beside one of the largest girls--Julia Semple.    A good many of the girls stared at the new-comer with more than  ordinary attention; but Julia immediately turned her back on her new  seatmate. Ruth did not, however, give Julia much attention at the  time. She was quite as bashful as most girls of her age; and, too,  there were many things during that first session to hold her  attention. But at recess she found that Julia walked away from her  without a word and that most of the girls who seemed to be in her  grade kept aloof, too. As a stranger in the school the girl from the  Red Mill felt no little unhappiness at this evident slight; but she  was too proud to show her disappointment. She made friends with the  younger girls and was warmly welcomed in their games and pastimes.    \"Julia's mad at you, you see,\" one of her new acquaintances confided  to Ruth.    \"Mad at me? What for?\" asked the surprised new scholar.    \"Why, that seat was Rosy Ball's. Rosy has gone away to see her sister  married and she's coming back to-morrow. If you hadn't come in to take  her place, Rosy would have been let sit beside Julia again, of course,  although like enough she's fallen behind the class. Miss Cramp is very  strict.\"    \"But I didn't know that. I couldn't help it,\" cried Ruth.    \"Just the same, Julia says she doesn't like you and that you're a  nobody--that Jabe Potter "]]]
