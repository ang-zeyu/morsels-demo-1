Everything was procurable from one  source, and nothing could be procured anywhere else. A system of direct  distribution from the national storehouses took the place of trade, and  for this money was unnecessary.\"    \"How is this distribution managed?\" I asked.    \"On the simplest possible plan,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"A credit  corresponding to his share of the annual product of the nation is given  to every citizen on the public books at the beginning of each year, and  a credit card issued him with which he procures at the public  storehouses, found in every community, whatever he desires whenever he  desires it. This arrangement, you will see, totally obviates the  necessity for business transactions of any sort between individuals and  consumers. Perhaps you would like to see what our credit cards are like.    \"You observe,\" he pursued as I was curiously examining the piece of  pasteboard he gave me, \"that this card is issued for a certain number  of dollars. We have kept the old word, but not the substance. The term,  as we use it, answers to no real thing, but merely serves as an  algebraical symbol for comparing the values of products with one  another. For this purpose they are all priced in dollars and cents,  just as in your day. The value of what I procure on this card is  checked off by the clerk, who pricks out of these tiers of squares the  price of what I order.\"    \"If you wanted to buy something of your neighbor, could you transfer  part of your credit to him as consideration?\" I inquired.    \"In the first place,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"our neighbors have nothing to  sell us, but in any event our credit would not be transferable, being  strictly personal. Before the nation could even think of honoring any  such transfer as you speak of, it would be bound to inquire into all  the circumstances of the transaction, so as to be able to guarantee its  absolute equity. It would have been reason enough, had there been no  other, for abolishing money, that its possession was no indication of  rightful title to it. In the hands of the man who had stolen it or  murdered for it, it was as good as in those which had earned it by  industry. People nowadays interchange gifts and favors out of  friendship, but buying and selling is considered absolutely  inconsistent with the mutual benevolence and disinterestedness which  should prevail between citizens and the sense of community of interest  which supports our social system. According to our ideas, buying and  selling is essentially anti-social in all its tendencies. It is an  education in self-seeking at the expense of others, and no society  whose citizens are trained in such a school can possibly rise above a  very low grade of civilization.\"    \"What if you have to spend more than your card in any one year?\" I  asked.    \"The provision is so ample that we are more likely not to spend it  all,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"But if extraordinary expenses should exhaust  it, we can obtain a limited advance on the next year's credit, though  this practice is not encouraged, and a heavy discount is charged to  check it. Of course if a man showed himself a reckless spendthrift he  would receive his allowance monthly or weekly instead of yearly, or if  necessary not be permitted to handle it all.\"    \"If you don't spend your allowance, I suppose it accumulates?\"    \"That is also permitted to a certain extent when a special outlay is  anticipated. But unless notice to the contrary is given, it is presumed  that the citizen who does not fully expend his credit did not have  occasion to do so, and the balance is turned into the general surplus.\"    \"Such a system does not encourage saving habits on the part of  citizens,\" I said.    \"It is not intended to,\" was the reply. \"The nation is rich, and does  not wish the people to deprive themselves of any good thing. In your  day, men were bound to lay up goods and money against coming failure of  the means of support and for their children. This necessity made  parsimony a virtue. But now it would have no such laudable object, and,  having lost its utility, it has ceased to be regarded as a virtue. No  man any more has any care for the morrow, either for himself or his  children, for the nation guarantees the nurture, education, and  comfortable maintenance of every citizen from the cradle to the grave.\"    \"That is a sweeping guarantee!\" I said. \"What certainty can there be  that the value of a man's labor will recompense the nation for its  outlay on him? On the whole, society may be able to support all its  members, but some must earn less than enough for their support, and  others more; and that brings us back once more to the wages question,  on which you have hitherto said nothing. It was at just this point, if  you remember, that our talk ended last evening; and I say again, as I  did then, that here I should suppose a national industrial system like  yours would find its main difficulty. How, I ask once more, can you  adjust satisfactorily the comparative wages or remuneration of the  multitude of avocations, so unlike and so incommensurable, which are  necessary for the service of society? In our day the market rate  determined the price of labor of all sorts, as well as of goods. The  employer paid as little as he could, and the worker got as much. It was  not a pretty system ethically, I admit; but it did, at least, furnish  us a rough and ready formula for settling a question which must be  settled ten thousand times a day if the world was ever going to get  forward. There seemed to us no other practicable way of doing it.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"it was the only practicable way under a  system which made the interests of every individual antagonistic to  those of every other; but it would have been a pity if humanity could  never have devised a better plan, for yours was simply the application  to the mutual relations of men of the devil's maxim, 'Your necessity is  my opportunity.' The reward of any service depended not upon its  difficulty, danger, or hardship, for throughout the world it seems that  the most perilous, severe, and repulsive labor was done by the worst  paid classes; but solely upon the strait of those who needed the  service.\"    \"All that is conceded,\" I said. \"But, with all its defects, the plan of  settling prices by the market rate was a practical plan; and I cannot  conceive what satisfactory substitute you can have devised for it. The  government being the only possible employer, there is of course no  labor market or market rate. Wages of all sorts must be arbitrarily  fixed by the government. I cannot imagine a more complex and delicate  function than that must be, or one, however performed, more certain to  breed universal dissatisfaction.\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"but I think you exaggerate the  difficulty. Suppose a board of fairly sensible men were charged with  settling the wages for all sorts of trades under a system which, like  ours, guaranteed employment to all, while permitting the choice of  avocations. Don't you see that, however unsatisfactory the first  adjustment might be, the mistakes would soon correct themselves? The  favored trades would have too many volunteers, and those discriminated  against would lack them till the errors were set right. But this is  aside from the purpose, for, though this plan would, I fancy, be  practicable enough, it is no part of our system.\"    \"How, then, do you regulate wages?\" I once more asked.    Dr. Leete did not reply till after several moments of meditative  silence. \"I know, of course,\" he finally said, \"enough of the old order  of things to understand just what you mean by that question; and yet  the present order is so utterly different at this point that I am a  little at loss how to answer you best. You ask me how we regulate  wages; I can only reply that there is no idea in the modern social  economy which at all corresponds with what was meant by wages in your  day.\"    \"I suppose you mean that you have no money to pay wages in,\" said I.  \"But the credit given the worker at the government storehouse answers  to his wages with us. How is the amount of the credit given  respectively to the workers in different lines determined? By what  title does the individual claim his particular share? What is the basis  of allotment?\"    \"His title,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"is his humanity. The basis of his  claim is the fact that he is a man.\"    \"The fact that he is a man!\" I repeated, incredulously. \"Do you  possibly mean that all have the same share?\"    \"Most assuredly.\"    The readers of this book never having practically known any other  arrangement, or perhaps very carefully considered the historical  accounts of former epochs in which a very different system prevailed,  cannot be expected to appreciate the stupor of amazement into which Dr.  Leete's simple statement plunged me.    \"You see,\" he said, smiling, \"that it is not merely that we have no  money to pay wages in, but, as I said, we have nothing at all answering  to your idea of wages.\"    By this time I had pulled myself together sufficiently to voice some of  the criticisms which, man of the nineteenth century as I was, came  uppermost in my mind, upon this to me astounding arrangement. \"Some men  do twice the work of others!\" I exclaimed. \"Are the clever workmen  content with a plan that ranks them with the indifferent?\"    \"We leave no possible ground for any complaint of injustice,\" replied  Dr. Leete, \"by requiring precisely the same measure of service from  all.\"    \"How can you do that, I should like to know, when no two men's powers  are the same?\"    \"Nothing could be simpler,\" was Dr. Leete's reply. \"We require of each  that he shall make the same effort; that is, we demand of him the best  service it is in his power to give.\"    \"And"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/626"],[0,"The Love of Books: The Philobiblon of Richard de Bury (#12)"],[1,"Pegasean fount, to develop fully the title of the present  chapter.  Though one should speak with the tongue of men and angels,  though he should become a Mercury or Tully, though he should grow sweet  with the milky eloquence of Livy, yet he will plead the stammering of  Moses, or with Jeremiah will confess that he is but a boy and cannot  speak, or will imitate Echo rebounding from the mountains.  For we know  that the love of books is the same thing as the love of wisdom, as was  proved in the second chapter.  Now this love is called by the Greek  word philosophy, the whole virtue of which no created intelligence can  comprehend; for she is believed to be the mother of all good things:  Wisdom vii.  She as a heavenly dew extinguishes the heats of fleshly  vices, the intense activity of the mental forces relaxing the vigour of  the animal forces, and slothfulness being wholly put to flight, which  being gone all the bows of Cupid are unstrung.    Hence Plato says in the Phaedo:  The philosopher is manifest in this,  that he dissevers the soul from communion with the body.  Love, says  Jerome, the knowledge of the scriptures, and thou wilt not love the  vices of the flesh.  The godlike Xenocrates showed this by the firmness  of his reason, who was declared by the famous hetaera Phryne to be a  statue and not a man, when all her blandishments could not shake his  resolve, as Valerius Maximus relates at length.  Our own Origen showed  this also, who chose rather to be unsexed by the mutilation of himself,  than to be made effeminate by the omnipotence of woman--though it was a  hasty remedy, repugnant alike to nature and to virtue, whose place it  is not to make men insensible to passion, but to slay with the dagger  of reason the passions that spring from instinct.    Again, all who are smitten with the love of books think cheaply of the  world and wealth; as Jerome says to Vigilantius:  The same man cannot  love both gold and books.  And thus it has been said in verse:      No iron-stained hand is fit to handle books,    Nor he whose heart on gold so gladly looks:    The same men love not books and money both,    And books thy herd, O Epicurus, loathe;    Misers and bookmen make poor company,    Nor dwell in peace beneath the same roof-tree.    No man, therefore, can serve both books and Mammon.      The hideousness of vice is greatly reprobated in books, so that he who  loves to commune with books is led to detest all manner of vice.  The  demon, who derives his name from knowledge, is most effectually  defeated by the knowledge of books, and through books his multitudinous  deceits and the endless labyrinths of his guile are laid bare to those  who read, lest he be transformed into an angel of light and circumvent  the innocent by his wiles.  The reverence of God is revealed to us by  books, the virtues by which He is worshipped are more expressly  manifested, and the rewards are described that are promised by the  truth, which deceives not, neither is deceived.  The truest likeness of  the beatitude to come is the contemplation of the sacred writings, in  which we behold in turn the Creator and the creature, and draw from  streams of perpetual gladness.  Faith is established by the power of  books; hope is strengthened by their solace, insomuch that by patience  and the consolation of scripture we are in good hope.  Charity is not  puffed up, but is edified by the knowledge of true learning, and,  indeed, it is clearer than light that the Church is established upon  the sacred writings.    Books delight us, when prosperity smiles upon us; they comfort us  inseparably when stormy fortune frowns on us.  They lend validity to  human compacts, and no serious judgments are propounded without their  help.  Arts and sciences, all the advantages of which no mind can  enumerate, consist in books.  How highly must we estimate the wondrous  power of books, since through them we survey the utmost bounds of the  world and time, and contemplate the things that are as well as those  that are not, as it were in the mirror of eternity.  In books we climb  mountains and scan the deepest gulfs of the abyss; in books we behold  the finny tribes that may not exist outside their native waters,  distinguish the properties of streams and springs and of various lands;  from books we dig out gems and metals and the materials of every kind  of mineral, and learn the virtues of herbs and trees and plants, and  survey at will the whole progeny of Neptune, Ceres, and Pluto.    But if we please to visit the heavenly inhabitants, Taurus, Caucasus,  and Olympus are at hand, from which we pass beyond the realms of Juno  and mark out the territories of the seven planets by lines and circles.  And finally we traverse the loftiest firmament of all, adorned with  signs, degrees, and figures in the utmost variety.  There we inspect  the antarctic pole, which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard; we admire  the luminous Milky Way and the Zodiac, marvellously and delightfully  pictured with celestial animals.  Thence by books we pass on to  separate substances, that the intellect may greet kindred  intelligences, and with the mind's eye may discern the First Cause of  all things and the Unmoved Mover of infinite virtue, and may immerse  itself in love without end.  See how with the aid of books we attain  the reward of our beatitude, while we are yet sojourners below.    Why need we say more?  Certes, just as we have learnt on the authority  of Seneca, leisure without letters is death and the sepulture of the  living, so contrariwise we conclude that occupation with letters or  books is the life of man.    Again, by means of books we communicate to friends as well as foes what  we cannot safely entrust to messengers; since the book is generally  allowed access to the chambers of princes, from which the voice of its  author would be rigidly excluded, as Tertullian observes at the  beginning of his Apologeticus.  When shut up in prison and in bonds,  and utterly deprived of bodily liberty, we use books as ambassadors to  our friends, and entrust them with the conduct of our cause, and send  them where to go ourselves would incur the penalty of death.  By the  aid of books we remember things that are past, and even prophesy as to  the future; and things present, which shift and flow, we perpetuate by  committing them to writing.    The felicitous studiousness and the studious felicity of the  all-powerful eunuch, of whom we are told in the Acts, who had been so  mightily kindled by the love of the prophetic writings that he ceased  not from his reading by reason of his journey, had banished all thought  of the populous palace of Queen Candace, and had forgotten even the  treasures of which he was the keeper, and had neglected alike his  journey and the chariot in which he rode.  Love of his book alone had  wholly engrossed this domicile of chastity, under whose guidance he  soon deserved to enter the gate of faith.  O gracious love of books,  which by the grace of baptism transformed the child of Gehenna and  nursling of Tartarus into a Son of the Kingdom!    Let the feeble pen now cease from the tenor of an infinite task, lest  it seem foolishly to undertake what in the beginning it confessed to be  impossible to any.        CHAPTER XVI    THAT IT IS MERITORIOUS TO WRITE NEW BOOKS AND TO RENEW THE OLD    Just as it is necessary for the state to prepare arms and to provide  abundant stores of victuals for the soldiers who are to fight for it,  so it is fitting for the Church Militant to fortify itself against the  assaults of pagans and heretics with a multitude of sound writings.    But because all the appliances of mortal men with the lapse of time  suffer the decay of mortality, it is needful to replace the volumes  that are worn out with age by fresh successors, that the perpetuity of  which the individual is by its nature incapable may be secured to the  species; and hence it is that the Preacher says: Of making many books  there is no end.  For as the bodies of books, seeing that they are  formed of a combination of contrary elements, undergo a continual  dissolution of their structure, so by the forethought of the clergy a  remedy should be found, by means of which the sacred book paying the  debt of nature may obtain a natural heir and may raise up like seed to  its dead brother, and thus may be verified that saying of  Ecclesiasticus: His father is dead, and he is as if he were not dead;  for he hath left one behind him that is like himself.  And thus the  transcription of ancient books is as it were the begetting of fresh  sons, on whom the office of the father may devolve, lest it suffer  detriment.  Now such transcribers are called antiquarii, whose  occupations Cassiodorus confesses please him above all the tasks of  bodily labour, adding: \"Happy effort,\" he says, \"laudable industry, to  preach to men with the hand, to let loose tongues with the fingers,  silently to give salvation to mortals, and to fight with pen and ink  against the illicit wiles of the Evil One.\"  So far Cassiodorus.  Moreover, our Saviour exercised the office of the scribe when He  stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground (John viii.), that  no one, however exalted, may think it unworthy of him to do what he  sees the wisdom of God the Father did.    O singular serenity of writing, to practise which the Artificer of the  world stoops down, at whose dread name every knee doth bow!  O  venerable handicraft pre-eminent above all other crafts that are  practised by the hand of man, to which our Lord humbly inclines His  breast, to which the finger of God is applied, performing the office of  a pen!  We do not read of the Son of God that He sowed or ploughed,  wove or digged; nor did any other of the mechanic arts befit the divine  wisdom incarnate except to trace letters in writing, that every  gentleman and sciolist may know that fingers are given by God "]]]
