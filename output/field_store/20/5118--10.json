[_He draws the sword with a violent effort from the          stem of the tree and shows it to the amazed and          enraptured Sieglinde._          Siegmund the Wälsung        Thou dost see!        As bride-gift        He brings thee this sword;        With this he frees        The woman most blest;        He bears thee        From the house of his foe.

The          curtain falls quickly._            THE SECOND ACT      _A wild, mountainous spot. In the background a gorge rises from below to a  high ridge of rocks, from which the ground slopes down again towards  the front. Wotan, in full armour, carrying his spear. Before  him Brünnhilde as a Valkyrie, also fully armed._        WOTAN          Go bridle thy steed,        Valorous maid!        Bitter strife        Soon will break forth;    Brünnhilde, storm to the fray    And cause the Wälsung to win!        Hunding choose for himself        Where to bide:    No place in Walhall has he.        So up and to horse!        Haste to the field!    BRÜNNHILDE [_Ascends the height on the right, shouting  and springing from rock to rock._      Hojotoho! Hojotoho!    Heiaha! Heiaha!    Hojotoho! Hojotoho!    Heiaha! Heiaha!    Hojotoho! Hojotoho!    Hojotoho! Hojotoho!        Heiaha! Hojoho!    [Illustration: Plate 22      \"Siegmund the Walsung      Thou dost see!      As bride-gift      He brings thee this sword\"]            [_She pauses on a high peak, looks down into the          gorge and calls back to Wotan._           I warn thee, Father,         See to thyself;         Stern the strife         That is in store:     Here comes Fricka, thy wife,     Drawn hither in her car by her rams,         Swinging the golden         Scourge in her hand!         The wretched beasts         Are groaning with fear;     And how the wheels rattle!     Hot she hastes to the fray.         Such strife as this         No strife is for me,         Though I love boldly waged         Strife 'twixt men.     The battle alone thou must brave;     I go; thou art left in the lurch!         Hojotoho! Hojotoho!         Heiaha! Heiaha!         Hojotoho! Hojotoho!         Heiaha! Heiaha!         Hojotoho! Hojotoho!         Hojotoho! Hojotoho!         Heiaha! Ha!            [_She disappears behind the mountain peak at the          side. Fricka, in a car drawn by a pair of rams, has          driven up the gorge to the mountain ridge, where          she suddenly stops, alights and strides angrily          towards Wotan in the foreground._    WOTAN [_Aside, when he sees Fricka approaching._          The usual storm!        The usual strife!    But I must act with firmness    FRICKA [_Moderating her pace as she approaches, and  confronting Wotan with dignity._      All alone among the hills    I seek thee, where thou dost hide        Fearing the eyes        Of thy wife,    That help in need thou may'st promise.    WOTAN          Let Fricka tell        Her trouble in full.    FRICKA      I have heard Hunding's cry,    For vengeance calling on me;        As wedlock's guardian        I gave ear:        My word passed        To punish the deed    Of this impious pair    Who boldly wrought him the wrong.    WOTAN          Have this pair then        Done such harm,    Whom spring united in love?        'Twas love's sweet magic        That lured them on;    None pays for love's might to me.    FRICKA      How dull and how deaf thou wouldst seem!    As though thou wert not aware        That it is wedlock's        Holy oath    Profaned so rudely I grieve for.    WOTAN          Unholy        Hold I the bond    That binds unloving hearts;        Nor must thou        Imagine that I        Will restrain by force        What transcends thy power;    For where bold natures are stirring    I urge them frankly to strife.    [Illustration: Plate 23, Brünnhilde]    FRICKA          Deeming thus laudable        Wedlock's breach,        Pray babble more nonsense        And call it holy    That shame should blossom forth    From bond of a twin-born pair!        I shudder at heart,        My brain reels and whirls.        Sister embraced        As bride by the brother--    Who has ever heard    Of brother and sister as lovers?    WOTAN          Thou hearest it now!        Be taught by this        That a thing may be    Which has never befallen before.        That those two are lovers        Thou must admit;    So take advice and be wise!        Thy blessing surely        Will bring to thee gladness,    If thou wilt, laughing on love,  Bless Siegmund and Sieglinde's bond.    FRICKA [_With a burst of deep indignation._          Then nothing to thee        Are the gods everlasting        Since the wild Wälsungs        Won thee for father?        I speak plainly--        Is that thy thought?        The holy and high        Immortals are worthless;        And all that once        Was esteemed is thrown over;        The bonds thou didst bind        By thyself now are broken;        Heaven's hold        Is loosed with a laugh,    That this twin-born pair, unimpeded,    The fruit of thy lawless love,    May in wantonness flourish and rule!        But why wail over        Wedlock and vows,    Since by thee the first they are scorned!        The faithful wife        Betrayed at each turn,        Lustfully longing        Wander thy glances;        Thine eyes scan        Each hollow and height    As thy fickle fancy allures thee,    While grief is gnawing my heart.        Heavy of soul        I had to endure it,        When to the fight        With the graceless maidens        Born out of wedlock,        Forth thou hast fared;    For, thy wife still holding in awe,        Thou didst give her as maids        The Valkyrie band        To obedience bound,    Even Brünnhilde, bride of thy Wish.        But now that new names        Afford thee new pleasure,        And Wälse, wolfish, in        Forests has wandered;        Now that to bottomless        Shame thou hast stooped,        And a pair of mortals        Hast vilely begotten--    Now thy wife at the feet    Of whelps of a wolf thou dost fling!        Come finish thy work!        Fill the cup full!    Mock and trample now the betrayed one!    [Illustration: Plate 24, Fricka approaches in anger.]    WOTAN [_Quietly._          Thou couldst not learn,        Though I might teach thee;    To thee there is nothing plain    Till day has dawned on the deed,        Wonted things        Thou alone canst conceive,    Whereas my spirit broods    On things not yet brought forth.        Listen, woman!        Some one we need,    A hero gods have not shielded,    And who is not bound by their law.        So alone        Were he fit for the deed    Which no god can accomplish,    Yet which must be done for the gods.    FRICKA          With sayings dark        Thou fain wouldst deceive me!        What deed by hero        Could be accomplished    That was beyond the strength of the gods,    By whose grace alone he is strong?    WOTAN          Then his own heart's courage        Counts not at all?    FRICKA      Who breathed their souls into men?    Who opened their eyes, that they see?        Behind thy shield        Strong they appear;        With thee to goad them,        Upward they strive;    Those men that thou praisest,    'Tis thou who spurrest them on.        With falsehoods fresh        Thou wouldst fain delude me,        With new devices        Thou wouldst evade me;        Thou shalt not shelter        The Wälsung from me;    He lives only through thee,    And is bold through thee alone.    WOTAN [_With emotion._          He grew unaided        In grievous distress;    My shield sheltered him not.    FRICKA      Then shield him not to-day;        Take back the sword        That thou hast bestowed.    WOTAN          The sword?    FRICKA          Yes, the sword,        The magic sword        Sudden and strong    That thou gavest to thy son.    WOTAN          Nay, Siegmund won it        Himself in his need.            [_From here Wotan's whole attitude expresses an          ever-deepening uneasiness and gloom._    WOTAN [_Continuing passionately._          Both conquering sword        And the need came from thee.        Wouldst thou deceive me        Who, day and night,        At thy heels follow close?        For him thou didst strike        The sword in the stem;        Thou didst promise him        The peerless blade.        Canst thou deny        That thy cunning it was    Which led him where it lay hid?            [_Wotan makes a wrathful gesture. Fricka goes          on more and more confidently as she sees the          impression produced on him._          The Gods        Do not battle with bondsmen;    The free but punish transgressors.        Against thee, my peer,        Have I waged war,    But Siegmund is mine as my slave.            [_Another violent gesture from Wotan, who then          seems to succumb to the feeling of his own          powerlessness._          Shall thy eternal        Consort obey one        Who calls thee master        And bows as thy slave?
