Even in such a feature  as the proper motions of the stars, the same unity is seen. The reader  doubtless knows that each of these objects is flying through space on  its own course with a speed comparable with that of the earth around  the sun. These speeds range from the smallest limit up to more than one  hundred miles a second. Such diversity might seem to detract from the  unity of the whole; but when we seek to learn something definite by  taking their average, we find this average to be, so far as can yet be  determined, much the same in opposite regions of the universe. Quite  recently it has become probable that a certain class of very bright  stars known as Orion stars--because there are many of them in the most  brilliant of our constellations--which are scattered along the whole  course of the Milky Way, have one and all, in the general average,  slower motions than other stars. Here again we have a definable  characteristic extending through the universe. In drawing attention to  these points of similarity throughout the whole universe, it must not  be supposed that we base our conclusions directly upon them. The point  they bring out is that the universe is in the nature of an organized  system; and it is upon the fact of its being such a system that we are  able, by other facts, to reach conclusions as to its structure, extent,  and other characteristics.    One of the great problems connected with the universe is that of its  possible extent. How far away are the stars? One of the unities which  we have described leads at once to the conclusion that the stars must  be at very different distances from us; probably the more distant ones  are a thousand times as far as the nearest; possibly even farther than  this. This conclusion may, in the first place, be based on the fact  that the stars seem to be scattered equally throughout those regions of  the universe which are not connected with the Milky Way. To illustrate  the principle, suppose a farmer to sow a wheat-field of entirely  unknown extent with ten bushels of wheat. We visit the field and wish  to have some idea of its acreage. We may do this if we know how many  grains of wheat there are in the ten bushels. Then we examine a space  two or three feet square in any part of the field and count the number  of grains in that space. If the wheat is equally scattered over the  whole field, we find its extent by the simple rule that the size of the  field bears the same proportion to the size of the space in which the  count was made that the whole number of grains in the ten bushels sown  bears to the number of grains counted. If we find ten grains in a  square foot, we know that the number of square feet in the whole field  is one-tenth that of the number of grains sown. So it is with the  universe of stars. If the latter are sown equally through space, the  extent of the space occupied must be proportional to the number of  stars which it contains.    But this consideration does not tell us anything about the actual  distance of the stars or how thickly they may be scattered. To do this  we must be able to determine the distance of a certain number of stars,  just as we suppose the farmer to count the grains in a certain small  extent of his wheat-field. There is only one way in which we can make a  definite measure of the distance of any one star. As the earth swings  through its vast annual circuit round the sun, the direction of the  stars must appear to be a little different when seen from one extremity  of the circuit than when seen from the other. This difference is called  the parallax of the stars; and the problem of measuring it is one of  the most delicate and difficult in the whole field of practical  astronomy.    The nineteenth century was well on its way before the instruments of  the astronomer were brought to such perfection as to admit of the  measurement. From the time of Copernicus to that of Bessel many  attempts had been made to measure the parallax of the stars, and more  than once had some eager astronomer thought himself successful. But  subsequent investigation always showed that he had been mistaken, and  that what he thought was the effect of parallax was due to some other  cause, perhaps the imperfections of his instrument, perhaps the effect  of heat and cold upon it or upon the atmosphere through which he was  obliged to observe the star, or upon the going of his clock. Thus  things went on until 1837, when Bessel announced that measures with a  heliometer--the most refined instrument that has ever been used in  measurement--showed that a certain star in the constellation Cygnus had  a parallax of one-third of a second. It may be interesting to give an  idea of this quantity. Suppose one's self in a house on top of a  mountain looking out of a window one foot square, at a house on another  mountain one hundred miles away. One is allowed to look at that distant  house through one edge of the pane of glass and then through the  opposite edge; and he has to determine the change in the direction of  the distant house produced by this change of one foot in his own  position. From this he is to estimate how far off the other mountain  is. To do this, one would have to measure just about the amount of  parallax that Bessel found in his star. And yet this star is among the  few nearest to our system. The nearest star of all, Alpha Centauri,  visible only in latitudes south of our middle ones, is perhaps half as  far as Bessel's star, while Sirius and one or two others are nearly at  the same distance. About 100 stars, all told, have had their parallax  measured with a greater or less degree of probability. The work is  going on from year to year, each successive astronomer who takes it up  being able, as a general rule, to avail himself of better instruments  or to use a better method. But, after all, the distances of even some  of the 100 stars carefully measured must still remain quite doubtful.    Let us now return to the idea of dividing the space in which the  universe is situated into concentric spheres drawn at various distances  around our system as a centre. Here we shall take as our standard a  distance 400,000 times that of the sun from the earth. Regarding this  as a unit, we imagine ourselves to measure out in any direction a  distance twice as great as this--then another equal distance, making  one three times as great, and so indefinitely. We then have successive  spheres of which we take the nearer one as the unit. The total space  filled by the second sphere will be 8 times the unit; that of the third  space 27 times, and so on, as the cube of each distance. Since each  sphere includes all those within it, the volume of space between each  two spheres will be proportional to the difference of these  numbers--that is, to 1, 7, 19, etc. Comparing these volumes with the  number of stars probably within them, the general result up to the  present time is that the number of stars in any of these spheres will  be about equal to the units of volume which they comprise, when we take  for this unit the smallest and innermost of the spheres, having a  radius 400,000 times the sun's distance. We are thus enabled to form  some general idea of how thickly the stars are sown through space. We  cannot claim any numerical exactness for this idea, but in the absence  of better methods it does afford us some basis for reasoning.    Now we can carry on our computation as we supposed the farmer to  measure the extent of his wheat-field. Let us suppose that there are  125,000,000 stars in the heavens. This is an exceedingly rough  estimate, but let us make the supposition for the time being. Accepting  the view that they are nearly equally scattered throughout space, it  will follow that they must be contained within a volume equal to  125,000,000 times the sphere we have taken as our unit. We find the  distance of the surface of this sphere by extracting the cube root of  this number, which gives us 500. We may, therefore, say, as the result  of a very rough estimate, that the number of stars we have supposed  would be contained within a distance found by multiplying 400,000 times  the distance of the sun by 500; that is, that they are contained within  a region whose boundary is 200,000,000 times the distance of the sun.  This is a distance through which light would travel in about 3300 years.    It is not impossible that the number of stars is much greater than that  we have supposed. Let us grant that there are eight times as many, or  1,000,000,000. Then we should have to extend the boundary of our  universe twice as far, carrying it to a distance which light would  require 6600 years to travel.    There is another method of estimating the thickness with which stars  are sown through space, and hence the extent of the universe, the  result of which will be of interest. It is based on the proper motion  of the stars. One of the greatest triumphs of astronomy of our time has  been the measurement of the actual speed at which many of the stars are  moving to or from us in space. These measures are made with the  spectroscope. Unfortunately, they can be best made only on the brighter  stars--becoming very difficult in the case of stars not plainly visible  to the naked eye. Still the motions of several hundreds have been  measured and the number is constantly increasing.    A general result of all these measures and of other estimates may be  summed up by saying that there is a certain average speed with which  the individual stars move in space; and that this average is about  twenty miles per second. We are also able to form an estimate as to  what proportion of the stars move with each rate of speed from the  lowest up to a limit which is probably as high as 150 miles per second.  Knowing these proportions we have, by observation of the proper motions  of the stars, another method of estimating how thickly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4069"],[0,"The Dawn of Canadian History : A Chronicle of Aboriginal Canada (#12)"],[1," about that the Portuguese,  going far southward in Africa, went also far northward in America and  sailed along the coast of Canada.    We find, in consequence, that when King Manoel of Portugal was fitting  out a fleet of twenty ships for a new expedition under da Gama, which  was to sail to the Indies by way of Africa, another Portuguese  expedition, setting out with the same object, was sailing in the  opposite direction. At its head was Gaspar Corte-Real, a nobleman of  the Azores, who had followed with eager interest the discoveries of  Columbus, Diaz, and da Gama. Corte-Real sailed from Lisbon in the  summer of 1500 with a single ship. He touched at the Azores. It is  possible that a second vessel joined him there, but this is not clear.  From the Azores his path lay north and west, till presently he reached  a land described as a 'cool region with great woods.' Corte-Real called  it from its verdure 'the Green Land,' but the similarity of name with  the place that we call Greenland is only an accident. In reality the  Portuguese captain was on the coast of Newfoundland. He saw a number of  natives. They appeared to the Portuguese a barbarous people, who  dressed in skins, and lived in caves. They used bows and arrows, and  had wooden spears, the points of which they hardened with fire.    Corte-Real directed his course northward, until he found himself off  the coast of Greenland. He sailed for some distance along those rugged  and forbidding shores, a land of desolation, with jagged mountains and  furrowed cliffs, wrapped in snow and ice. No trace of the lost  civilization of the Norsemen met his eyes. The Portuguese pilot  considered Greenland at its southern point to be an outstanding  promontory of Asia, and he struggled hard to pass beyond it westward to  a more favoured region. But his path was blocked by 'enormous masses of  frozen snow floating on the sea, and moving under the influence of the  waves.' It is clear that he was met not merely by the field ice of the  Arctic ocean, but also by great icebergs moving slowly with the polar  current. The narrative tells how Corte-Real's crew obtained fresh water  from the icebergs. 'Owing to the heat of the sun, fresh and clear water  is melted on the summits, and, descending by small channels formed by  the water itself, it eats away the base where it falls. The boats were  sent in, and in that way as much was taken as was needed.'    Corte-Real made his way as far as a place (which was in latitude 60  degrees) where the sea about him seemed a flowing stream of snow, and  so he called it Rio Nevado, 'the river of snow.' Probably it was Hudson  Strait.    Late in the same season, Corte-Real was back in Lisbon. He had  discovered nothing of immediate profit to the crown of Portugal, but  his survey of the coast of North America from Newfoundland to Hudson  Strait seems to have strengthened the belief that the best route to  India lay in this direction. In any case, on May 15, 1501, he was sent  out again with three ships. This time the Portuguese discovered a  region, so they said, which no one had before visited. The description  indicates that they were on the coast of Nova Scotia and the adjacent  part of New England. The land was wooded with fine straight timber, fit  for the masts of ships, and 'when they landed they found delicious  fruits of various kinds, and trees and pines of marvellous height and  thickness.' They saw many natives, occupied in hunting and fishing.  Following the custom of the time, they seized fifty or sixty natives,  and crowded these unhappy captives into the holds of their ships, to  carry home as evidence of the reality of their discoveries, and to be  sold as slaves. These savages are described by those who saw them in  Portugal as of shapely form and gentle manner, though uncouth and even  dirty in person. They wore otter skins, and their faces were marked  with lines. The description would answer to any of the Algonquin tribes  of the eastern coast. Among the natives seen on the coast there was a  boy who had in his ears two silver rings of Venetian make. The  circumstance led the Portuguese to suppose that they were on the coast  of Asia, and that a European ship had recently visited the same spot.  The true explanation, if the circumstance is correctly reported, would  seem to be that the rings were relics of Cabot's voyages and of his  trade in the trinkets supplied by the merchants.    Gaspar Corte-Real sent his consort ships home, promising to explore the  coast further, and to return later in the season. The vessels duly  reached Lisbon, bringing their captives and the news of the voyage.  Corte-Real, however, never returned, nor is anything known of his fate.    When a year had passed with no news of Gaspar Corte-Real, his brother  Miguel fitted out a new expedition of three ships and sailed westward  in search of him. On reaching the coast of Newfoundland, the ships of  Miguel Corte-Real separated in order to make a diligent search in all  directions for the missing Gaspar. They followed the deep indentations  of the island, noting its outstanding features. Here and there they  fell in with the natives and traded with them, but they found nothing  of value. To make matters worse, when the time came to assemble, as  agreed, in the harbour of St John's, only two ships arrived at the  rendezvous. That of Miguel was missing. After waiting some time the  other vessels returned without him to Portugal.    Two Corte-Reals were now lost. King Manoel transferred the rights of  Gaspar and Miguel to another brother, and in the ensuing years sent out  several Portuguese expeditions to search for the lost leaders, but  without success. The Portuguese gained only a knowledge of the  abundance of fish in the region of the Newfoundland coast. This was  important, and henceforth Portuguese ships joined with the Normans, the  Bretons, and the English in fishing on the Grand Banks. Of the  Corte-Reals nothing more was ever heard.    The next great voyage of discovery was that of Juan Verrazano, some  twenty years after the loss of the Corte-Reals. Like so many other  pilots of his time, Verrazano was an Italian. He had wandered much  about the world, had made his way to the East Indies by the new route  that the Portuguese had opened, and had also, so it is said, been a  member of a ship's company in one of the fishing voyages to  Newfoundland now made in every season.    The name of Juan Verrazano has a peculiar significance in Canadian  history. In more ways than one he was the forerunner of Jacques  Cartier, 'the discoverer of Canada.' Not only did he sail along the  coast of Canada, but did so in the service of the king of France, the  first representative of those rising ambitions which were presently to  result in the foundation of New France and the colonial empire of the  Bourbon monarchy. Francis I, the French king, was a vigorous and  ambitious prince. His exploits and rivalries occupy the foreground of  European history in the earlier part of the sixteenth century. It was  the object of Francis to continue the work of Louis XI by consolidating  his people into a single powerful state. His marriage with the heiress  of Brittany joined that independent duchy, rich at least in the  seafaring bravery of its people, to the crown of France. But Francis  aimed higher still. He wished to make himself the arbiter of Europe and  the over-lord of the European kings. Having been defeated by the  equally famous king of Spain, Charles V, in his effort to gain the  position and title of Holy Roman Emperor and the leadership of Europe,  he set himself to overthrow the rising greatness of Spain. The history  of Europe for a quarter of a century turns upon the opposing ambitions  of the two monarchs.    As a part of his great design, Francis I turned towards western  discovery and exploration, in order to rival if possible the  achievements of Columbus and Cortes and to possess himself of  territories abounding in gold and silver, in slaves and merchandise,  like the islands of Cuba and San Domingo and the newly conquered empire  of Montezuma, which Spain held. It was in this design that he sent out  Juan Verrazano; in further pursuit of it he sent Jacques Cartier ten  years later; and the result was that French dominion afterwards,  prevailed in the valley of the St Lawrence and seeds were planted from  which grew the present Dominion of Canada.    At the end of the year 1523 Juan Verrazano set out from the port of  Dieppe with four ships. Beaten about by adverse storms, they put into  harbour at Madeira, so badly strained by the rough weather that only a  single seaworthy ship remained. In this, the Dauphine, Verrazano set  forth on January 17, 1524, for his western discovery. The voyage was  prosperous, except for one awful tempest in mid-Atlantic, 'as  terrible,' wrote Verrazano, 'as ever any sailors suffered.' After seven  weeks of westward sailing Verrazano sighted a coast 'never before seen  of any man either ancient or modern.' This was the shore of North  Carolina. From this point the French captain made his way northward,  closely inspecting the coast, landing here and there, and taking note  of the appearance, the resources, and the natives of the country. The  voyage was chiefly along the coast of what is now the United States,  and does not therefore immediately concern the present narrative.  Verrazano's account of his discoveries, as he afterwards wrote it down,  is full of picturesque interest, and may now be found translated into  English in Hakluyt's Voyages. He tells of the savages who flocked to  the low sandy shore to see the French ship riding at anchor. They wore  skins about their loins and light feathers in their hair, and they were  'of colour russet, and not much unlike the Saracens.' Verrazano said  that these Indians were of 'cheerful and steady look, not strong of  body, yet sharp-witted, nimble, and"]]]
