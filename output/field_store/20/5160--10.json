We believe in being subject to kings, presidents,      rulers and magistrates, in obeying, honoring and      sustaining the law.        13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste,      benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men;      indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul,      We believe all things, we hope all things, we have      endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all      things.  If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of      good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these      things.--JOSEPH SMITH.    This brief summary of \"Mormon\" doctrine appears over the  signature of Joseph Smith--the man whom the Latter-day Saints  accept as the instrument in divine hands of re-establishing the  Church of Christ on earth, in this the Dispensation of the  Fulness of Times.  Let it not be supposed, however, that these  Articles of Faith are, or profess to be, a complete code of the  doctrines of the Church, for, as declared in one of the  \"Articles,\" belief in continuous revelation from Heaven is a  characteristic feature of \"Mormonism.\"  Yet it is to be noted  that no doctrine has been promulgated, which by even strained  interpretation could be construed as antagonistic to this early  declaration of faith.  Nor has any revelation to the Church yet  appeared in opposition to earlier revelation of this or of  by-gone dispensations.    To most of the declarations in the Articles of Faith, many sects  professing Christianity could confidently pledge allegiance; to  many of them, all Christian organizations could and professedly  do subscribe.  Belief in the existence and powers of the Supreme  Trinity; in Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer of mankind;  in man's individual accountability for his doings; in the  acceptance of sacred writ as the Word of God; in the rights of  Worship according to the dictates of conscience; in all the moral  virtues;--these professions and beliefs are as a common creed in  the realm of Christendom.  There is no peculiarly \"Mormon\"  interpretation, in the light of which these principles of faith  and practise are viewed by the Latter-day Saints, except in a  certain simplicity and literalness of acceptance--gross  literalness, unrefined materialism, it has been called by some  critical opponents.    The gospel plan as accepted and taught by the Latter-day Saints  is strikingly simple; disappointing in its simplicity, indeed, to  the mind that can find satisfaction in mysteries alone, and to  him whose love for metaphor, symbolism, and imagery are stronger  than his devotion to truth itself, which may or may not be thus  embellished.  The Church asserts that the wisdom of human  learning, while ranking among the choicest of earthly  possessions, is not essential to an understanding of the gospel;  and that the preacher of the Word must be otherwise endowed than  by the learning of the schoolmen.  \"Mormonism\" is for the  wayfaring man, not less than for the scholar, and it possesses a  simplicity adapting it to the one as to the other.  A few of the  characteristically \"Mormon\" tenets may perhaps be profitably  considered.    \"Mormonism\" affirms its unqualified belief in the Godhead as the  Holy Trinity, comprising Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; each of the  three a separate and individual personage; the Father and the Son  each a personage of spirit and of immortalized body; the Holy  Ghost a personage of spirit.    The unity of the Godhead is accepted in the literal fulness of  scriptural declaration--that the three are one in purpose, plan  and method, alike in all their Godly attributes; one in their  divine omniscience and omnipotence; yet as separate and distinct  in their personality as are any three inhabitants of earth.  \"Mormonism\" claims that scriptures declaring the oneness of the  Trinity admit of this interpretation; that such indeed is the  natural interpretation; and that the conception is in accord with  reason.    We hold that mankind are literally the spiritual children of God;  that even as the Christ had an existence with the Father before  coming to earth to take upon himself a tabernacle of flesh, to  live and to die as a man in accordance with the fore-ordained  plan of redemption, so, too, every child of earth had an  existence in the spirit-state before entering upon this mortal  probation.  We hold the doctrine to be reasonable, scriptural and  true, that mortal birth is no more the beginning of the soul's  existence than is death its end.    The time-span of mortal life is but one stage in the soul's  career, separating the eternity that has preceded from the  eternity that is to follow.  And this mortal existence is one of  the Father's great gifts to his spiritual children, affording  them the opportunity of an untrammeled exercise of their free  agency, the privilege of meeting temptation and of resisting it  if they will, the chance to win exaltation and eternal life.    We claim that all men are equal as to earthly rights and human  privileges; but that each has individual capacity and  capabilities; that in the primeval world there were spirits noble  and great, as there were others of lesser power and inferior  purpose.  There is no chance in the number or nature of spirits  that are born to earth; all who are entitled to the privileges of  mortality and have been assigned to this sphere shall come at the  time appointed, and shall return to inherit each the glory or the  degradation to which he has shown himself adapted.  The gospel as  understood by the Latter-day Saints affirms the unconditional  free-agency of man--his right to accept good or evil, to choose  the means of eternal progression or the opposite, to worship as  he elects, or to refuse to worship at all--and then to take the  consequences of his choice.    \"Mormonism\" rejects what it regards as a heresy, the false  doctrine of pre-destination as an absolute compulsion or even as  an irresistible tendency forced upon the individual toward right  or wrong--as a pre-appointment to eventual exaltation or  condemnation; yet it affirms that the infinite wisdom and  fore-knowledge of God makes plain to him the end from the  beginning; and that he can read in the natures and dispositions  of his children, their destiny.    \"Mormonism\" claims an actual and literal relationship of parent  and child between the Creator and man--not in the figurative  sense in which the engine may be called the child of its builder;  not the relationship of a thing mechanically made to the maker  thereof; but the kinship of father and offspring.  In short it is  bold enough to declare that man's spirit being the offspring of  Deity, and man's body though of earthy components yet being in  the very image and likeness of God, man even in his present  degraded--aye, fallen condition--still possesses, if only in a  latent state, inherited traits, tendencies and powers that tell  of his more than royal descent; and that these may be developed  so as to make him, even while mortal, in a measure Godlike.    But \"Mormonism\" is bolder yet.  It asserts that in accordance  with the inviolable law of organic nature--that like shall beget  like, and that multiplication of numbers and perpetuation of  species shall be in compliance with the condition \"each after his  kind,\" the child may achieve the former status of the parent, and  that in his mortal condition man is a God in embryo.  However far  in the future it may be, what ages may elapse, what eternities  may pass before any individual now a mortal being may attain the  rank and sanctity of godship, man nevertheless carries in his  soul the possibilities of such achievement; even as the crawling  caterpillar or the corpse-like chrysalis holds the latent  possibility, nay, barring destruction, the certainty indeed, of  the winged imago in all the glory of maturity.    \"Mormonism\" claims that all nature, both on earth and in heaven,  operates on a plan of advancement; that the very Eternal Father  is a progressive Being; that his perfection, while so complete as  to be incomprehensible by man, possesses this essential quality  of true perfection--the capacity of eternal increase.  That  therefore, in the far future, beyond the horizon of eternities  perchance, man may attain the status of a God.  Yet this does not  mean that he shall be then the equal of the Deity he now worships  nor that he shall ever overtake those intelligences that are  already beyond him in advancement; for to assert such would be to  argue that there is no progression beyond a certain stage of  attainment, and that advancement is a characteristic of low  organization and inferior purpose alone.  We believe that there  was more than the sounding of brass or the tinkling of wordy  cymbals in the fervent admonition of the Christ to his  followers--\"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is  in heaven is perfect.\"  (Matt. 5:48.)    But it is beyond dispute that in his present state, man is far  from the condition of even a relatively perfect being.  He is  born heir to the weaknesses as well as to the excellencies of  generations of ancestors; he inherits potent tendencies for both  good and evil; and verily, it seems that in the flesh he has to  suffer for the sins of his progenitors.  But divine blessings are  not to be reckoned in terms of earthly possessions or bodily  excellencies alone; the child born under conditions of adversity  may after all be richly endowed with opportunity, opportunity  which, perhaps, had been less of service amid the surroundings of  luxury.  We hold that the Father has an individual interest in  his children; and that surely in the rendering of divine  judgment, the conditions under which each soul has lived in  mortality shall be considered.    \"Mormonism\" accepts the doctrine of the Fall, and the account of  the transgression in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5632"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Midway (#12)"],[1,"come  to light about the early days of the Peppers.    \"Isn't Dr. Fisher lovely?\" cried Polly, with sparkling eyes, \"just the  same as ever. Mamsie, I ought to do something for him.    \"He is as good as gold,\" assented Mrs. Pepper heartily. \"You've done  something, I'm sure, Polly. The medical books you bought out of your  pocket money, and sent him, pleased him more than anything you could  give him.\"    \"But I want to do something now,\" said Polly. \"Oh! just think how good  he was to us.\"    \"May we never forget it!\" exclaimed Mrs. Pepper, wiping her eyes.    \"But he's very unwise,\" said Mr. King a trifle testily, \"not to take up  with my offer to establish him in the town. A man like him could easily  hold a good practice, because the fellow's got ability.\"    \"Oh! Dr. Fisher wouldn't leave Badgertown,\" cried all the Peppers in a  bunch. \"And what would the poor people here do without him?\" finished  Polly.    \"Well, well, never mind, he won't come to town, and that's enough,\"  said the old gentleman quickly. \"Aside from that, he's a sensible chap,  and one quite to my liking.\"    \"Oh, Polly!\" cried Phronsie suddenly, and lifting her head, she  fastened her brown eyes on the face above her, \"wasn't Mamsie's  birthday cake good?\"    \"The flowers were pretty, but the cake was heavy, don't you remember?\"  said Polly, who hadn't recovered from that grief even yet.    \"I thought it was just beautiful,\" cried Mrs. Pepper hastily. \"No one  could have baked it better in the old stove you had. I'm sure we ate it  all up, every crumb.\"    \"We kept it in the old cupboard,\" cried Joel, rushing over to the  corner to swing the door open. \"And we never once peeked, Mamsie, so  afraid you'd suspect.\"    \"You kept staring at the cupboard door all the evening, Joe, you know  you did,\" cried Ben; \"you were just within a hair's breadth of letting  the whole thing out ever so many times. Polly and I had to drag you  away. We were glad enough when you went to bed, I can tell you.\"    \"You were always sending me off to bed in those days,\" said Joel,  taking his head out of the cupboard to throw vindictive glances over to  the group around the stove.    \"I wish we could do so now,\" said Ben.    \"And those two,\" Joel went on, pointing to Polly and Ben, \"used to go  whispering around a lot of old secrets, that they wouldn't tell us. Oh!  it was perfectly awful, wasn't it, Dave?\" bestowing a small pinch on  that individual's shoulder.    \"I liked the secrets best not to know them till Polly and Ben got ready  to tell us,\" said David slowly; \"then they were just magnificent.\"    Phronsie had laid her head back in the waiting lap, and was crooning  softly to herself.    \"I want to go and see dear good Mr. Beebe,\" she said presently, \"and  nice Mrs. Beebe, can I, Mamsie?\" looking over at her.    \"To be sure,\" cried Mrs. Pepper, \"you shall indeed, child.\"    \"Beebe-Beebe, and who is he, pray?\" demanded Mr. King.    \"Oh! he keeps the shoe shop over in the Center,\" explained three or  four voices, \"and Phronsie's new shoes were bought there, you know.\"    \"And he gave me pink and white candy-sticks,\" said Phronsie, \"and he  was very nice; and I like him very much.\"    \"And Mrs. Beebe gave us doughnuts all around,\" communicated Joel; \"I  don't know but that I liked those best. There was more to them.\"    \"So you always bought your new shoes of the Beebes?\" asked the old  gentleman, a question that brought all the five Peppers around his  chair at once.    \"We didn't ever have new shoes that I can remember,\" said Joel quickly,  \"except Phronsie's, and once Ben had a new pair. He had to, because he  was the oldest, you know.\"    \"Oh!\" said Mr. King.    \"You see,\" said Phronsie, shaking her head gravely, while she laid one  hand on his knee, \"we were very poor, Grandpapa dear. Don't you  understand?\"    \"Yes, yes, child,\" said old Mr. King; \"there, get up here,\" and he took  her within his arms.    \"No, no, you're not going to talk yet,\" seeing Percy and Van beginning  violent efforts to join in the conversation. \"Let the Peppers have a  chance to talk over old times first. See how good Jasper is to wait.\"    \"I would much prefer to hear the Peppers talk forever,\" said Jasper,  smiling down on the two Whitneys, \"than to have the gates opened for a  general flood. Go on, do, Polly and Ben, and the rest of you.\"    \"Oh! there is so much,\" said Polly despairingly, clasping her hands,  \"we shouldn't get through if we talked ten years, should we, Ben?  Mamsie,\" and she rushed over to her, \"can we have a baking time  to-morrow, just as we used to in the old days? Oh! do say yes.\"    \"Yes, do say yes,\" echoed Jasper, also rushing to the side of the  little rocking-chair. \"You will, won't you, Mrs. Pepper?\"    \"Hoh! hoh!\" cried the two Whitneys derisively, \"I thought you could  'hear the Peppers talk forever.' That's great, Jasper.\"    \"Well, when it comes to hearing a proposal for a baking frolic, my  principles are thrown to the wind,\" said Jasper recklessly. \"Why, boys,  that's the first thing I remember about the little brown house. Do say  yes, Mrs. Pepper!\"          VIII    SOME BADGERTOWN CALLS      \"Well, I declare!\" exclaimed Grandma Bascom, opening the door and  looking in, \"I never!\"    \"Come in,\" cried Mr. King sociably. His night over at the parsonage had  been a most fortunate experiment. \"I haven't slept so finely in ten  years,\" he confided to Mrs. Whitney as they met at breakfast at the  minister's table. So now, his face wreathed with smiles, he repeated  his invitation. \"Come in, do, Mrs. Bascom; we're glad to see you.\"    \"I never!\" said Grandma Bascom once more, for want of something better  to say, and coming close to the center of operations.    Jasper, attired in one of Mrs. Pepper's long aprons, which was fastened  in the style of the old days, by the strings around his neck, was  busily engaged in rolling out under Polly's direction, a thin paste,  expected presently under the genial warmth of the waiting stove, to  evolve into most toothsome cakes. Ben was similarly attired, and  similarly employed; while Joel and David were in a sticky state,  preparing their dough after their own receipt, over at the corner  table, their movements closely followed by the three Whitneys.    Phronsie, before a board laid across two chairs, was enlightening old  Mr. King who sat by her, into the mysteries of baking day.    \"Do bake a gingerbread boy,\" he begged. \"I never had anything half so  good as the one you sent over to Hingham.\"    \"You were my poor sick man then,\" observed Phronsie, with slow, even  pats on her bit of dough. \"Please, the rolling-pin now, Grandpapa dear.\"    \"To be sure,\" cried the old gentleman; \"here, Jappy, my boy, be so good  as to hand us over that article.\"    \"And you see,\" continued Phronsie, receiving the rolling-pin, and  making the deftest of passes with it over the soft mass, \"I couldn't  send you anything better, though I wanted to, Grandpapa dear.\"    \"Better?\" cried Mr. King. \"I should think not; you couldn't have made  me anything that pleased me more, had you tried a thousand times.\"    Phronsie never tired of hearing this, and now humming a soft note of  thanks, proceeded with her task, declaring that she would make the best  gingerbread boy that could possibly be achieved.    Grandma Bascom was still reiterating \"I never,\" and going slowly from  one group to another to inspect operations. When she came to Phronsie,  she stopped short, raising her hands in surprise. \"Seems as ef 'twas  only yesterday when the Peppers went away, though land knows I've  missed 'em all most dretfully, 'an there sets that blessed child  baking, as big as any of 'em. I never!\"    \"Have you any more raisins to give us, Grandma?\" shouted Joel across  the kitchen. \"They were terribly hard,\" he added in his natural voice;  \"almost broke our teeth.\"    \"Hey?\" called Grandma back again.    \"Raisins, Grandma, or peppermints,\" cried Joel.    \"Oh, Joe, for shame!\" called Ben.    \"I'm going to have the fun of going after them,\" declared Joel,  throwing down his dough-pat, and wiping his sticky fingers on his  apron; \"just like old times--so there!\"    \"I'll go over and get 'em,\" said Grandma; \"you come along with me,\"  looking admiringly up at the tall boy; so the two, Joel laughing and  hopping by her side as if he were five years younger, disappeared,  well-pleased with each other.    \"Now I shall take his dough,\" declared Dick, rushing around the end of  the table to Joel's deserted place.    \"No such thing,\" declared Van, flying out of his chair. \"Leave your  hands off, youngster! that's to be mine.\"    Polly looked up from the little cookies she was cutting with the top of  a tin baking powder box and their eyes met.    \"I didn't promise not to have it out with Dicky,\" said Van stoutly.  \"He's a perfect plague, and always under foot. I never thought of such  a thing as not making him stand around, Polly.\"    But the brown eyes did not return to their task, as Polly mechanically  stamped another cooky.    \"I only promised not to have a bout with Percy,\" Van proceeded  uncomfortably. And in the same breath, \"Go ahead, If you want it,  Dicky, I don't care.\"    \"I do want it,\" declared Dick, clambering into Van's chair, while Van  returned to his own, \"and I'm going to have it too. I guess you think  you'd better give it up now, sir; I'm getting so big.\"    \"Softly there, Dicky,\" said Mrs. Whitney, over in the window-seat with  her fancy work; \"if Van gives up, you should thank him; I think he is  very good to do it.\" And the bigger boy's heart warmed with the radiant  smile she sent him.    Dick gave several vicious thrusts to his dough, and looked up at last  to say very much against his will, \"Thank you,\" and adding brightly,  \"but you know I'm getting big, sir, and you'd better give up.\"    \"All right,\" said Van, with that smile in his heart feeling equal to  anything.    \"Now,\" cried Jasper, with a flourish of his baking "]]]
