Grimly silent for a long time, he seemed  oblivious of our presence. When he took up the dangling thread of  his narrative, it was suddenly, with subdued voice.    \"Not long after Father's warning, I visited the capital city of  Cooch Behar. The picturesque territory was new to me, and I expected  a restful change. As usual everywhere, a curious crowd followed me  on the streets. I would catch bits of whispered comment:    \"'This is the man who fights wild tigers.'    \"'Has he legs, or tree-trunks?'    \"'Look at his face! He must be an incarnation of the king of tigers  himself!'    \"You know how village urchins function like final editions of a  newspaper! With what speed do the even-later speech-bulletins of  the women circulate from house to house! Within a few hours, the  whole city was in a state of excitement over my presence.    \"I was relaxing quietly in the evening, when I heard the hoofbeats  of galloping horses. They stopped in front of my dwelling place.  In came a number of tall, turbaned policemen.    \"I was taken aback. 'All things are possible unto these creatures  of human law,' I thought. 'I wonder if they are going to take me to  task about matters utterly unknown to me.' But the officers bowed  with unwonted courtesy.    \"'Honored Sir, we are sent to welcome you on behalf of the Prince  of Cooch Behar. He is pleased to invite you to his palace tomorrow  morning.'    \"I speculated awhile on the prospect. For some obscure reason I  felt sharp regret at this interruption in my quiet trip. But the  suppliant manner of the policemen moved me; I agreed to go.    \"I was bewildered the next day to be obsequiously escorted from my  door into a magnificent coach drawn by four horses. A servant held  an ornate umbrella to protect me from the scorching sunlight. I  enjoyed the pleasant ride through the city and its woodland outskirts.  The royal scion himself was at the palace door to welcome me. He  proffered his own gold-brocaded seat, smilingly placing himself in  a chair of simpler design.    \"'All this politeness is certainly going to cost me something!' I  thought in mounting astonishment. The prince's motive emerged after  a few casual remarks.    \"'My city is filled with the rumor that you can fight wild tigers  with nothing more than your naked hands. Is it a fact?'    \"'It is quite true.'    \"'I can scarcely believe it! You are a Calcutta Bengali, nurtured  on the white rice of city folk. Be frank, please; have you not been  fighting only spineless, opium-fed animals?' His voice was loud  and sarcastic, tinged with provincial accent.    \"I vouchsafed no reply to his insulting question.    \"'I challenge you to fight my newly-caught tiger, Raja Begum.  {FN6-2} If you can successfully resist him, bind him with a chain,  and leave his cage in a conscious state, you shall have this royal  Bengal! Several thousand rupees and many other gifts shall also be  bestowed. If you refuse to meet him in combat, I shall blazon your  name throughout the state as an impostor!'    \"His insolent words struck me like a volley of bullets. I shot an  angry acceptance. Half risen from the chair in his excitement, the  prince sank back with a sadistic smile. I was reminded of the Roman  emperors who delighted in setting Christians in bestial arenas.    \"'The match will be set for a week hence. I regret that I cannot  give you permission to view the tiger in advance.'    \"Whether the prince feared I might seek to hypnotize the beast, or  secretly feed him opium, I know not!    \"I left the palace, noting with amusement that the royal umbrella  and panoplied coach were now missing.    \"The following week I methodically prepared my mind and body for  the coming ordeal. Through my servant I learned of fantastic tales.  The saint's direful prediction to my father had somehow got abroad,  enlarging as it ran. Many simple villagers believed that an evil  spirit, cursed by the gods, had reincarnated as a tiger which took  various demoniac forms at night, but remained a striped animal  during the day. This demon-tiger was supposed to be the one sent  to humble me.    \"Another imaginative version was that animal prayers to Tiger  Heaven had achieved a response in the shape of Raja Begum. He was  to be the instrument to punish me-the audacious biped, so insulting  to the entire tiger species! A furless, fangless man daring  to challenge a claw-armed, sturdy-limbed tiger! The concentrated  venom of all humiliated tigers-the villagers declared-had gathered  momentum sufficient to operate hidden laws and bring about the fall  of the proud tiger tamer.    \"My servant further apprized me that the prince was in his element  as manager of the bout between man and beast. He had supervised  the erection of a storm-proof pavilion, designed to accommodate  thousands.  Its center held Raja Begum in an enormous iron cage,  surrounded by an outer safety room. The captive emitted a ceaseless  series of blood-curdling roars. He was fed sparingly, to kindle a  wrathful appetite.  Perhaps the prince expected me to be the meal  of reward!    \"Crowds from the city and suburbs bought tickets eagerly in response  to the beat of drums announcing the unique contest. The day of  battle saw hundreds turned away for lack of seats. Many men broke  through the tent openings, or crowded any space below the galleries.\"    As the Tiger Swami's story approached a climax, my excitement  mounted with it; Chandi also was raptly mute.    \"Amidst piercing sound-explosions from Raja Begum, and the hubbub  of the somewhat terrified crowd, I quietly made my appearance. Scantily  clad around the waist, I was otherwise unprotected by clothing. I  opened the bolt on the door of the safety room and calmly locked  it behind me. The tiger sensed blood. Leaping with a thunderous  crash on his bars, he sent forth a fearsome welcome. The audience  was hushed with pitiful fear; I seemed a meek lamb before the raging  beast.    \"In a trice I was within the cage; but as I slammed the door, Raja  Begum was headlong upon me. My right hand was desperately torn.  Human blood, the greatest treat a tiger can know, fell in appalling  streams.  The prophecy of the saint seemed about to be fulfilled.    \"I rallied instantly from the shock of the first serious injury  I had ever received. Banishing the sight of my gory fingers by  thrusting them beneath my waist cloth, I swung my left arm in a  bone-cracking blow. The beast reeled back, swirled around the rear  of the cage, and sprang forward convulsively. My famous fistic  punishment rained on his head.    \"But Raja Begum's taste of blood had acted like the maddening first  sip of wine to a dipsomaniac long-deprived. Punctuated by deafening  roar, the brute's assaults grew in fury. My inadequate defense  of only one hand left me vulnerable before claws and fangs. But I  dealt out dazing retribution. Mutually ensanguined, we struggled  as to the death. The cage was pandemonium, as blood splashed in  all directions, and blasts of pain and lethal lust came from the  bestial throat.    \"'Shoot him!' 'Kill the tiger!' Shrieks arose from the audience.  So fast did man and beast move, that a guard's bullet went amiss.  I mustered all my will force, bellowed fiercely, and landed a final  concussive blow. The tiger collapsed and lay quietly.    \"Like a pussycat!\" I interjected.    The swami laughed in hearty appreciation, then continued the  engrossing tale.    \"Raja Begum was vanquished at last. His royal pride was further  humbled: with my lacerated hands, I audaciously forced open his  jaws.  For a dramatic moment, I held my head within the yawning  deathtrap. I looked around for a chain. Pulling one from a pile  on the floor, I bound the tiger by his neck to the cage bars. In  triumph I moved toward the door.    \"But that fiend incarnate, Raja Begum, had stamina worthy of his  supposed demoniac origin. With an incredible lunge, he snapped  the chain and leaped on my back. My shoulder fast in his jaws, I  fell violently. But in a trice I had him pinned beneath me. Under  merciless blows, the treacherous animal sank into semiconsciousness.  This time I secured him more carefully. Slowly I left the cage.    \"I found myself in a new uproar, this time one of delight. The crowd's  cheer broke as though from a single gigantic throat. Disastrously  mauled, I had yet fulfilled the three conditions of the fight-stunning  the tiger, binding him with a chain, and leaving him without  requiring assistance for myself. In addition, I had so drastically  injured and frightened the aggressive beast that he had been content  to overlook the opportune prize of my head in his mouth!    \"After my wounds were treated, I was honored and garlanded; hundreds of  gold pieces showered at my feet. The whole city entered a holiday  period. Endless discussions were heard on all sides about my  victory over one of the largest and most savage tigers ever seen.  Raja Begum was presented to me, as promised, but I felt no elation.  A spiritual change had entered my heart. It seemed that with my  final exit from the cage I had also closed the door on my worldly  ambitions.    \"A woeful period followed. For six months I lay near death from  blood poisoning. As soon as I was well enough to leave Cooch Behar,  I returned to my native town.    \"'I know now that my teacher is the holy man who gave the wise  warning.' I humbly made this confession to my father. 'Oh, if I  could only find him!' My longing was sincere, for one day the saint  arrived unheralded.    \"'Enough of tiger taming.' He spoke with calm assurance. 'Come with  me; I will teach you to subdue the beasts of ignorance roaming in  jungles of the human mind. You are used to an audience: let it be  a galaxy of angels, entertained by your thrilling mastery of yoga!'    \"I was initiated into the spiritual path by my saintly guru.

I was quite  surprised to see the man was not at all shy with Bill. They seemed very  friendly.    'Is that him?' said Bill, looking at me.    'Bought him this afternoon,' said the man.    'Well,' said Bill, 'he's ugly enough. He looks fierce. If you want a  dog, he's the sort of dog you want. But what do you want one for? It  seems to me it's a lot of trouble to take, when there's no need of any  trouble at all. Why not do what I've always wanted to do? What's wrong  with just fixing the dog, same as it's always done, and walking in and  helping yourself?'    'I'll tell you what's wrong,' said the man. 'To start with, you can't  get at the dog to fix him except by day, when they let him out. At  night he's shut up inside the house. And suppose you do fix him during  the day what happens then? Either the bloke gets another before night,  or else he sits up all night with a gun. It isn't like as if these  blokes was ordinary blokes. They're down here to look after the house.  That's their job, and they don't take any chances.'    It was the longest speech I had ever heard the man make, and it seemed  to impress Bill. He was quite humble.    'I didn't think of that,' he said. 'We'd best start in to train this  tyke at once.'    Mother often used to say, when I went on about wanting to go out into  the world and see life, 'You'll be sorry when you do. The world isn't  all bones and liver.' And I hadn't been living with the man and Bill in  their cottage long before I found out how right she was.    It was the man's shyness that made all the trouble. It seemed as if he  hated to be taken notice of.    It started on my very first night at the cottage. I had fallen asleep  in the kitchen, tired out after all the excitement of the day and the  long walks I had had, when something woke me with a start. It was  somebody scratching at the window, trying to get in.    Well, I ask you, I ask any dog, what would you have done in my place?  Ever since I was old enough to listen, mother had told me over and over  again what I must do in a case like this. It is the A B C of a dog's  education. 'If you are in a room and you hear anyone trying to get in,'  mother used to say, 'bark. It may be someone who has business there, or  it may not. Bark first, and inquire afterwards. Dogs were made to be  heard and not seen.'    I lifted my head and yelled. I have a good, deep voice, due to a hound  strain in my pedigree, and at the public-house, when there was a full  moon, I have often had people leaning out of the windows and saying  things all down the street. I took a deep breath and let it go.    'Man!' I shouted. 'Bill! Man! Come quick! Here's a burglar getting in!'    Then somebody struck a light, and it was the man himself. He had come  in through the window.    He picked up a stick, and he walloped me. I couldn't understand it. I  couldn't see where I had done the wrong thing. But he was the boss, so  there was nothing to be said.    If you'll believe me, that same thing happened every night. Every  single night! And sometimes twice or three times before morning. And  every time I would bark my loudest and the man would strike a light and  wallop me. The thing was baffling. I couldn't possibly have mistaken  what mother had said to me. She said it too often for that. Bark! Bark!  Bark! It was the main plank of her whole system of education. And yet,  here I was, getting walloped every night for doing it.    I thought it out till my head ached, and finally I got it right. I  began to see that mother's outlook was narrow. No doubt, living with a  man like master at the public-house, a man without a trace of shyness  in his composition, barking was all right. But circumstances alter  cases. I belonged to a man who was a mass of nerves, who got the jumps  if you spoke to him. What I had to do was to forget the training I had  had from mother, sound as it no doubt was as a general thing, and to  adapt myself to the needs of the particular man who had happened to buy  me. I had tried mother's way, and all it had brought me was walloping,  so now I would think for myself.    So next night, when I heard the window go, I lay there without a word,  though it went against all my better feelings. I didn't even growl.  Someone came in and moved about in the dark, with a lantern, but,  though I smelt that it was the man, I didn't ask him a single question.  And presently the man lit a light and came over to me and gave me a  pat, which was a thing he had never done before.    'Good dog!' he said. 'Now you can have this.'    And he let me lick out the saucepan in which the dinner had been  cooked.    After that, we got on fine. Whenever I heard anyone at the window I  just kept curled up and took no notice, and every time I got a bone or  something good. It was easy, once you had got the hang of things.    It was about a week after that the man took me out one morning, and we  walked a long way till we turned in at some big gates and went along a  very smooth road till we came to a great house, standing all by itself  in the middle of a whole lot of country. There was a big lawn in front  of it, and all round there were fields and trees, and at the back a  great wood.    The man rang a bell, and the door opened, and an old man came out.    'Well?' he said, not very cordially.    'I thought you might want to buy a good watch-dog,' said the man.    'Well, that's queer, your saying that,' said the caretaker. 'It's a  coincidence. That's exactly what I do want to buy. I was just thinking  of going along and trying to get one. My old dog picked up something  this morning that he oughtn't to have, and he's dead, poor feller.'    'Poor feller,' said the man. 'Found an old bone with phosphorus on it,  I guess.'    'What do you want for this one?'    'Five shillings.'    'Is he a good watch-dog?'    'He's a grand watch-dog.'    'He looks fierce enough.'    'Ah!'    So the caretaker gave the man his five shillings, and the man went off  and left me.    At first the newness of everything and the unaccustomed smells and  getting to know the caretaker, who was a nice old man, prevented my  missing the man, but as the day went on and I began to realize that he  had gone and would never come back, I got very depressed. I pattered  all over the house, whining. It was a most interesting house, bigger  than I thought a house could possibly be, but it couldn't cheer me up.  You may think it strange that I should pine for the man, after all the  wallopings he had given me, and it is odd, when you come to think of  it. But dogs are dogs, and they are built like that. By the time it was  evening I was thoroughly miserable. I found a shoe and an old  clothes-brush in one of the rooms, but could eat nothing. I just sat  and moped.    It's a funny thing, but it seems as if it always happened that just  when you are feeling most miserable, something nice happens. As I sat  there, there came from outside the sound of a motor-bicycle, and  somebody shouted.    It was dear old Fred, my old pal Fred, the best old boy that ever  stepped. I recognized his voice in a second, and I was scratching at  the door before the old man had time to get up out of his chair.    Well, well, well! That was a pleasant surprise! I ran five times round  the lawn without stopping, and then I came back and jumped up at him.    'What are you doing down here, Fred?' I said. 'Is this caretaker your  father? Have you seen the rabbits in the wood? How long are you going  to stop? How's mother? I like the country. Have you come all the way  from the public-house? I'm living here now. Your father gave five  shillings for me. That's twice as much as I was worth when I saw you  last.'    'Why, it's young Nigger!' That was what they called me at the saloon.  'What are you doing here? Where did you get this dog, father?'    'A man sold him to me this morning. Poor old Bob got poisoned. This one  ought to be just as good a watch-dog. He barks loud enough.'    'He should be. His mother is the best watch-dog in London. This  cheese-hound used to belong to the boss. Funny him getting down here.'    We went into the house and had supper. And after supper we sat and  talked. Fred was only down for the night, he said, because the boss  wanted him back next day.    'And I'd sooner have my job, than yours, dad,' he said. 'Of all the  lonely places! I wonder you aren't scared of burglars.'    'I've my shot-gun, and there's the dog. I might be scared if it wasn't  for him, but he kind of gives me confidence. Old Bob was the same. Dogs  are a comfort in the country.'    'Get many tramps here?'    'I've only seen one in two months, and that's the feller who sold me  the dog here.'    As they were talking about the man, I asked Fred if he knew him. They  might have met at the public-house, when the man was buying me from the  boss.    'You would like him,' I said. 'I wish you could have met.'    They both looked at me.    'What's he growling at?' asked Fred. 'Think he heard something?'    The old man laughed.    'He wasn't growling. He was talking in his sleep. You're nervous, Fred.  It comes of living in the city.'    'Well, I am. I like this place in the daytime, but it gives me the pip  at night. It's so quiet. How you can stand it here all the time, I  can't understand. Two nights of it would have me seeing things.'    His father laughed.    'If you feel like that, Fred, you had better take the gun to bed with  you. I shall be quite happy without it.'    'I will,' said Fred. 'I'll take six if you've got them.'    And after that they went upstairs. I had a basket in the hall, which  had belonged to Bob, the dog who had got poisoned. It was a comfortable  basket, but I was so excited at having met Fred again that I couldn't  sleep. Besides, there was a smell of mice somewhere, and I had to move  around, trying to place it.    I was just sniffing at a place in the"]]]
