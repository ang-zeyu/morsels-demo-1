Whitney and George Miller, and President  {2} Brigham Young and Elders Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards,  instructing them in the principles and order of the Priesthood,  attending to washings, anointings, endowments and the communication of  keys pertaining to the Aaronic Priesthood, and so on to the highest  order of the Melchisedek Priesthood, setting forth the order pertaining  to the Ancient of Days, and all those plans and principles by which any  one is enabled to secure the fullness of those blessings which have  been prepared for the Church of the First Born, and come up and abide  in the presence of the Eloheim in the eternal worlds. In this council  was instituted the ancient order of things for the first time in these  last days. And the communications I made to this council were of things  spiritual, and to be received only by the spiritual minded: and there  was nothing made known to these men but what will be made known to all  the Saints of the last days, so soon as they are prepared to receive,  and a proper place is prepared to communicate them, even to the weakest  of the Saints; therefore let the Saints be diligent in building the  Temple, and all houses which they have been, or shall hereafter be,  commanded of God to build; and wait their time with patience in all  meekness, faith, perseverance unto the end, knowing assuredly that all  these things referred to in this council are always governed by the  principle of revelation. [A]    [Footnote A: This is the Prophet's account of the introduction of the  Endowment ceremonies in this dispensation, and is the foundation of  the sacred ritual of the temples. There has been some controversies  as to the time when these ceremonies were introduced into the Church.  A sect styling itself the \"Re-organized Church,\" even goes so far as  to claim that these ceremonies were not introduced into the Church by  the Prophet Joseph Smith at all, but on the contrary claim that they  had their origin with Brigham Young and the Apostles who followed him  in the migration from Nauvoo to Great Salt Lake Valley in Utah. The  evidence, however, against such claims, is overwhelming. First, the  statement of the Prophet in the text above. Second, a previous allusion  to the same thing in his remarks at Nauvoo, on the 6th of January,  1842. (See HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, Vol. IV. p. 492.) Third, the same  ceremonies are referred to in the Revelation of Jan. 19, 1841, in which  washings, anointings, conversations, statutes, judgments, etc., are  explicitly referred to. (HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, Vol. IV, p. 277.) In  addition to this evidence also, Ebenezer Robinson, associate editor of  the _Times and Seasons_ when that periodical was founded by Don Carlos  Smith and himself, and who at the death of Don Carlos Smith, 1841,  became editor-in-chief of that periodical, and so continues until the  15th of March, 1842--declares that such ceremonies as are alluded to in  the text were inaugurated by special action of the Prophet as early as  1843. Mr. Robinson subsequently left the Church, but when in 1890, the  aforesaid self-styled \"Re-organized Church\" persisted in claiming that  Joseph Smith the Prophet did not inaugurate these Temple ceremonies,  he published an article in the magazine he was then conducting, called  _The Return_, in which he bears emphatic testimony to the effect above  stated, namely, that all these ceremonies were introduced into the  Church by the Prophet Joseph Smith at least as early as 1843. (See _The  Return_, Vol. II, No. 4, p. 252)]    _Thursday, 5_.--General Adams started for Springfield, {3} and the  remainder of the council of yesterday continued their meeting at the  same place, and myself and Brother Hyrum received in turn from the  others, the same that I had communicated to them the day previous.    The city of Hamburg, the commercial emporium of Germany, was destroyed  by fire, about this time.    _Friday, 6_.--I attended the Legion officers' drill in the morning, and  visited Lyman Wight, who was sick.    _Saturday, 7.--_    _Legion History_.        The Nauvoo Legion was on parade by virtue of an order of the      25th of January, 1842, and was reviewed by Lieutenant-General      Joseph Smith, who commanded through the day. One year since, the      Legion consisted of six companies; today of twenty-six companies,      amounting to about two thousand troops.        The consolidated staff of the Legion with their ladies, partook of      a sumptuous dinner at the house of the commander-in-chief, between      one and three o'clock, p. m. The weather was very fine.        In the afternoon the Legion was separated into cohorts, and fought      an animated sham battle; the first cohort under the command of      General Wilson Law, the second under General Charles C. Rich. At      the close of the parade, Lieutenant-General Joseph Smith delivered      a most animated and appropriate address, in which he remarked \"that      his soul was never better satisfied than on this occasion.\" Such      was the curious and interesting excitement which prevailed at the      time, in the surrounding country, about the Legion, that Judge      Douglas adjourned the circuit court, then in session at Carthage,      and came with some of the principal lawyers, to see the splendid      military parade of the Legion; upon notice of which being given to      General Smith, he immediately invited them to partake of the repast      prepared as above.    {4}[Sidenote: General John C. Bennett's Perfidy.]    In addition to this quotation, I would remark that the day passed very  harmoniously, without drunkenness, noise or confusion. There was an  immense congregation of spectators, and many distinguished strangers  expressed much satisfaction. But one thing I will notice: I was  solicited by General Bennett to take command of the first cohort during  the sham battle; this I declined. General Bennett next requested me to  take my station in the rear of the cavalry, without my staff, during  the engagement; but this was counteracted by Captain A. P. Rockwood,  commander of my life guards, who kept close to my side, and I chose  my own position. And if General Bennett's true feelings toward me are  not made manifest to the world in a very short time, then it may be  possible that the gentle breathings of that Spirit, which whispered  me on parade, that there was mischief concealed in that sham battle,  were false; a short time will determine the point. Let John C. Bennett  answer at the day of judgment, \"Why did you request me to command one  of the cohorts, and also to take my position without my staff, during  the sham battle, on the 7th of May, 1842, where my life might have been  the forfeit, and no man have known who did the deed?\"    The following diagram shows the position in which the Legion was drawn  up:    {5} [Diagram: Legion's position during parade.]    [Sidenote: Earthquakes in St. Domingo.]    A violent shock of an earthquake is reported to have been experienced  at the island of St. Domingo, at twenty minutes past seven, p. m. It  was also felt at St. Marc, Gonaives, and Cape Haytien, and at various  places from Port-au-Prince, to the base of the Rocky Mountains,  comprising a distance of 1,500 miles. At Santiago de Cuba the cathedral  and several extensive buildings were prostrated. About ten thousand  persons were killed at Cape Haytien.    {6}_Sunday, 8_.--Attended meeting at the grove, and heard Elder Rigdon  preach.    After meeting many persons were baptized, some in the font, others in  the river.    Eighty persons killed and as many wounded, by an accident on the Paris  and Versailles railroad, the carriages being consumed by fire, and  their passengers roasted alive.    _Monday, 9_.--Spent the day with my family.    _Tuesday, 10_.--Transacted a variety of business at the store, printing  office, &c.    [Sidenote: The Work in England.]    By letter from Elder Levi Richards, dated at Liverpool, we learn that  the work is progressing in the north of England, namely, Carlisle,  Brampton, Burnstones, Alstone, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where he has  been laboring for a few weeks.    _Wednesday, 11_.--Called with my clerk at Brother Joseph W. Coolidge's  to examine a new cabinet for the Temple Recorder's office; also called  at Bishop Knight's; dictated several letters and other items of a  business nature.    _Thursday, 12_.--Dictated a letter to Elder Rigdon concerning certain  difficulties, or surmises which existed and attended the meeting of the  Female Relief Society, the house being filled to overflowing. There was  a heavy thunderstorm at the close of the meeting.    _Friday, 13_.--Received a letter from Sidney Rigdon in reply to mine of  yesterday.    Spent most of the day in my garden and with my family.    Dictated the following letter to Horace R. Hotchkiss, Esq.    _The Prophet's Letter to Horace R. Hotchkiss.--Explaining why the  Former had taken Advantage of the Bankrupt Law_.        Dear Sir--I proceed without delay to give a hasty reply to yours of      the 12th ultimo, just received. My engagements will not admit of a      lengthy detail of events and circumstances which have transpired to      bring about that state of things which now exists in this place, as      before {7} you receive this you will probably be apprised of the      failure of myself and brethren to execute our designs in paying off      our contracts, or in other words, that we have been compelled to      pay our debts by the most popular method; that is by petitioning      for the privilege of general bankruptcy, a principle so popular at      the present moment throughout the Union.

Therefore--        _Resolved,_ 1st. That inasmuch as we honestly believe that the      combination of people calling themselves Mormons, or Latter-day      Saints, have given strong indications, in their recent movements,      that they are unwilling to submit to the ordinary restraints of      law, we are therefore forced to the conclusion that the time is not      far distant when the citizens of this country will be compelled to      assert their rights in some way.        _Resolved,_ 2nd. That while we would deprecate anything like      lawless violence, without justifiable cause, yet we pledge      ourselves in the most solemn manner to resist all the wrongs which      may be hereafter attempted to be imposed on this community by the      Mormons, to the utmost of our ability,--peaceably, if we can, but      forcibly, if we must.        _Resolved,_ 3rd. That in the event of our being forced into a      collision with that people, we pledge ourselves that we will stand      by and support each other in every emergency up to the death.        _Resolved,_ 4th. That we believe that it is also the interest      of our friends in the neighboring counties and also neighboring      states to begin to take a firm and decided stand against the high      pretension and base designs of this latter-day would-be Mahomet.        {7} _Resolved,_ 5th. That provided we must necessarily, for the      well-being of this community, the protection of our dearest rights,      and the preservation of our excellent institutions, adopt measures      to humble the pride and arrogance of that audacious despot; we      therefore call upon all good and honest men, without distinction of      party or place, to come to the rescue.        _Resolved,_ 6th. That we pledge ourselves in the most determined      manner that if the authorities of the State of Missouri shall make      another demand for the body of Joseph Smith, and our Governor      shall issue another warrant to stand ready at all times to serve      the officer into whose hands such warrant may come, as a _posse_,      in order that it may not be said of us, in future, that the most      outrageous culprits have been suffered \"to go unwhipped of justice.\"        _Resolved,_ 7th. That a corresponding committee be appointed to      communicate with the different parts of this county, and also with      other counties; and we would also recommend to all surrounding      counties to appoint like committees for the purpose of a mutual      interchange of views in regard to the subjects embraced in these      proceedings.        _Resolved,_ 8th. That as it has been too common for several years      past for politicians of both political parties, not only of this      county, but likewise of the state, to go to Nauvoo and truckle      to the heads of the Mormon clan for their influence, we pledge      ourselves that we will not support any man of either party in      future who shall thus debase himself.        _Resolved,_ 9th. That if the Mormons carry out the threats they      have made in regards to the lives of several of our citizens, we      will, if failing to obtain speedy redress from the laws of the      land, take summary and signal vengeance upon them as a people.        _Resolved,_ 10th. That when the Government ceases to afford      protection, the citizens of course fall back upon their original      inherent right of self-defense.        In pursuance of the 7th resolution, the following gentlemen      were appointed to act as a central corresponding committee at      Carthage--namely, Captain Robert F. Smith, Major T. J. Bartlet,      Harmon T. Wilson, Frank A. Worrel, and Walter Bagby.        On motion of Henry Stevens, it was ordered that committees,      consisting of two persons, be appointed in each election precinct      of this county, for the purpose of communicating with the central      committee at Carthage; and that those two may add to their number      at discretion.        On motion of Daniel Beaver, it was made the duty of the person      whose name stands first on the list of each committee to act as      chairman; and that all communications from the other committees, or      from any other sources shall be added.        {8} The following gentlemen were then appointed by the chair as      committees in the several precincts, to wit:--        _Green Plains_--Edson Whitney and Levi Williams.        _Bear Creek_--William White and Andrew Moore.        _Chili_--Stephen Owen and Arthur Morgan.        _Augusta_--William D. Abernethy and Alexander Oliver.        _Saint Mary's_--William Darnell and Daniel Beaver.        _Fountain Green_--Thomas Geddis and S. H. Tyler.        _La Harpe_--Jesse Gilmer and Charles Comstock.        _Camp Creek_--James Graham and Thomas Harris.        _Appanooce_--John McCanley and John R. Atherton.        _Montebello_--Samuel Steel and Benjamin B. Gates.        _Warsaw_--Thomas C. Sharp and Mark Aldrich.        On motion of Levi Williams, Colonel Root, of McDonough county, was      added to the central corresponding committee of Carthage.        On motion of Henry Newton, Esq.,        _Resolved,_ That the central committee of correspondence act as a      general committee of supervision; and, in case of a contingency      occurring requiring aid, that they immediately call on the precinct      committees and upon all others favorable to our cause to furnish      such aid as the exigency of the case may require.        On the motion of Charles C. Stevens, the following supplementary      resolutions were unanimously adopted:--        _Resolved,_ That the president of this meeting be requested to      communicate with the Governor of Missouri, and respectfully request      him to make another demand upon the authorities of this state for      the body of Joseph Smith, commonly called the Mormon Prophet;      and in the event of a requisition and an order for his arrest      and delivery to the proper officers of the state of Missouri, we      offer our services to enforce said order, and pledge ourselves to      sustain the supremacy of the laws at all hazards and under all      circumstances.        _Resolved,_ That a copy of the proceedings of this meeting be      forwarded to the publisher of the _Warsaw Message, Quincy Whig,_      and _Quincy Herald,_ for publication, with a request to them to add      a note, soliciting all editors friendly to our cause in this state,      Missouri, and Iowa Territory, to copy.        It was then moved and seconded, That this meeting adjourn, subject      to the call of the central corresponding committee.        Edson Whitney, Chairman.        W. D. Abernethy, Secretary.        Editors throughout Illinois, Missouri, Iowa Territory, friendly to      the Anti-Mormon cause, are requested to publish the proceedings, in      today's paper, of a meeting held at Carthage on the 6th instant.    {9} _Thursday, 7.--_I took home the letter written to Harrisburg  [6] for the Church History, a small fragment of which only has been  preserved, and is as follows:--        _Historical Sketch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day      Saints._        Messrs. Editors,--The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints      was founded upon direct revelation, as the true Church of God      has ever been, according to the Scriptures (Amos 3:7, and Acts      1:2); and through the will and blessings of God, I have been an      instrument in his hands, thus far, to move forward the cause of      Zion: therefore, in order to fulfill the solicitations of your      letter of July last, I shall commence with my life.        [Then follows a brief historical sketch of the Church from the      birth of the Prophet to the settlement of the Saints at Nauvoo,      much in the strain of the _\"Wentworth Letter\"_ already published in      this HISTORY, (Vol. IV, Ch. XXXI); and for the reason that all the      historical data in this I. Daniel Rupp sketch is contained in the      _Wentworth Letter,_ it is thought unnecessary to reproduce it here,      excepting the closing paragraphs which deal with conditions and      prospects at Nauvoo, on the date at which we have arrived in our      HISTORY, viz. September, 1843.--Editor.]        Nauvoo, upon every point connected with increase and prosperity      has exceeded the most sanguine expectations of thousands. It now      contains near 3,500 houses, and more than 15,000 inhabitants.      The charter contains, among its important powers, privileges or      immunities, a grant for \"The University of Nauvoo,\" with the same      liberal powers of the city, where all the arts and sciences will      grow with the growth and strengthen the strength of this beloved      city of the Saints of the last days.        Another very commendatory provision of the charter is that that      portion of the citizens subject to military duty are organized      into a body of independent military men, styled the \"Nauvoo      Legion,\" whose highest officer holds the rank and is commissioned      lieutenant-general. This Legion, like other independent bodies of      troops in this Republican Government, is at the disposal of the      Governor of the state, and President of the United States. There is      also an act of incorporation for an Agricultural and Manufacturing      Association, as well as the Nauvoo House Association.        Since the organization of this Church, its progress has been rapid,      and its gain in numbers regular. Besides these United States, where      {10} nearly every place of notoriety has heard the glad tidings      of the Gospel of the Son of God, England, Ireland and Scotland      have shared largely in the fullness of the everlasting Gospel, and      thousands have already gathered with their kindred Saints to this      the corner stone of Zion. Missionaries of this Church have gone      to the East Indies, to Australia, Germany,"]]]
