The air comes briskly and sweetly off the hills,  pure from the elevation and rustically scented by the upland plants; and  even at the toll, you may hear the curlew calling on its mate.  At  certain seasons, when the gulls desert their surfy forelands, the birds  of sea and mountain hunt and scream together in the same field by  Fairmilehead.  The winged, wild things intermix their wheelings, the  sea-birds skim the tree-tops and fish among the furrows of the plough.  These little craft of air are at home in all the world, so long as they  cruise in their own element; and, like sailors, ask but food and water  from the shores they coast.    Below, over a stream, the road passes Bow Bridge, now a dairy-farm, but  once a distillery of whisky.  It chanced, some time in the past century,  that the distiller was on terms of good-fellowship with the visiting  officer of excise.  The latter was of an easy, friendly disposition, and  a master of convivial arts.  Now and again, he had to walk out of  Edinburgh to measure the distiller's stock; and although it was agreeable  to find his business lead him in a friend's direction, it was unfortunate  that the friend should be a loser by his visits.  Accordingly, when he  got about the level of Fairmilehead, the gauger would take his flute,  without which he never travelled, from his pocket, fit it together, and  set manfully to playing, as if for his own delectation and inspired by  the beauty of the scene.  His favourite air, it seems, was 'Over the  hills and far away.'  At the first note, the distiller pricked his ears.  A flute at Fairmilehead? and playing 'Over the hills and far away?'  This  must be his friendly enemy, the gauger.  Instantly horses were harnessed,  and sundry barrels of whisky were got upon a cart, driven at a gallop  round Hill End, and buried in the mossy glen behind Kirk Yetton.  In the  same breath, you may be sure, a fat fowl was put to the fire, and the  whitest napery prepared for the back parlour.  A little after, the  gauger, having had his fill of music for the moment, came strolling down  with the most innocent air imaginable, and found the good people at Bow  Bridge taken entirely unawares by his arrival, but none the less glad to  see him.  The distiller's liquor and the gauger's flute would combine to  speed the moments of digestion; and when both were somewhat mellow, they  would wind up the evening with 'Over the hills and far away' to an  accompaniment of knowing glances.  And at least, there is a smuggling  story, with original and half-idyllic features.    A little further, the road to the right passes an upright stone in a  field.  The country people call it General Kay's monument.  According to  them, an officer of that name had perished there in battle at some  indistinct period before the beginning of history.  The date is  reassuring; for I think cautious writers are silent on the General's  exploits.  But the stone is connected with one of those remarkable  tenures of land which linger on into the modern world from Feudalism.  Whenever the reigning sovereign passes by, a certain landed proprietor is  held bound to climb on to the top, trumpet in hand, and sound a flourish  according to the measure of his knowledge in that art.  Happily for a  respectable family, crowned heads have no great business in the Pentland  Hills.  But the story lends a character of comicality to the stone; and  the passer-by will sometimes chuckle to himself.    The district is dear to the superstitious.  Hard by, at the back-gate of  Comiston, a belated carter beheld a lady in white, 'with the most  beautiful, clear shoes upon her feet,' who looked upon him in a very  ghastly manner and then vanished; and just in front is the Hunters'  Tryst, once a roadside inn, and not so long ago haunted by the devil in  person.  Satan led the inhabitants a pitiful existence.  He shook the  four corners of the building with lamentable outcries, beat at the doors  and windows, overthrew crockery in the dead hours of the morning, and  danced unholy dances on the roof.  Every kind of spiritual disinfectant  was put in requisition; chosen ministers were summoned out of Edinburgh  and prayed by the hour; pious neighbours sat up all night making a noise  of psalmody; but Satan minded them no more than the wind about the  hill-tops; and it was only after years of persecution, that he left the  Hunters' Tryst in peace to occupy himself with the remainder of mankind.  What with General Kay, and the white lady, and this singular visitation,  the neighbourhood offers great facilities to the makers of sun-myths; and  without exactly casting in one's lot with that disenchanting school of  writers, one cannot help hearing a good deal of the winter wind in the  last story.  'That nicht,' says Burns, in one of his happiest moments,--        '_That nicht a child might understand_      _The deil had business on his hand_.'    And if people sit up all night in lone places on the hills, with Bibles  and tremulous psalms, they will be apt to hear some of the most fiendish  noises in the world; the wind will beat on doors and dance upon roofs for  them, and make the hills howl around their cottage with a clamour like  the judgment-day.    The road goes down through another valley, and then finally begins to  scale the main slope of the Pentlands.  A bouquet of old trees stands  round a white farmhouse; and from a neighbouring dell, you can see smoke  rising and leaves ruffling in the breeze.  Straight above, the hills  climb a thousand feet into the air.  The neighbourhood, about the time of  lambs, is clamorous with the bleating of flocks; and you will be  awakened, in the grey of early summer mornings, by the barking of a dog  or the voice of a shepherd shouting to the echoes.  This, with the hamlet  lying behind unseen, is Swanston.    The place in the dell is immediately connected with the city.  Long ago,  this sheltered field was purchased by the Edinburgh magistrates for the  sake of the springs that rise or gather there.  After they had built  their water-house and laid their pipes, it occurred to them that the  place was suitable for junketing.  Once entertained, with jovial  magistrates and public funds, the idea led speedily to accomplishment;  and Edinburgh could soon boast of a municipal Pleasure House.  The dell  was turned into a garden; and on the knoll that shelters it from the  plain and the sea winds, they built a cottage looking to the hills.  They  brought crockets and gargoyles from old St. Giles's which they were then  restoring, and disposed them on the gables and over the door and about  the garden; and the quarry which had supplied them with building  material, they draped with clematis and carpeted with beds of roses.  So  much for the pleasure of the eye; for creature comfort, they made a  capacious cellar in the hillside and fitted it with bins of the hewn  stone.  In process of time, the trees grew higher and gave shade to the  cottage, and the evergreens sprang up and turned the dell into a thicket.  There, purple magistrates relaxed themselves from the pursuit of  municipal ambition; cocked hats paraded soberly about the garden and in  and out among the hollies; authoritative canes drew ciphering upon the  path; and at night, from high upon the hills, a shepherd saw lighted  windows through the foliage and heard the voice of city dignitaries  raised in song.    The farm is older.  It was first a grange of Whitekirk Abbey, tilled and  inhabited by rosy friars.  Thence, after the Reformation, it passed into  the hands of a true-blue Protestant family.  During the covenanting  troubles, when a night conventicle was held upon the Pentlands, the farm  doors stood hospitably open till the morning; the dresser was laden with  cheese and bannocks, milk and brandy; and the worshippers kept slipping  down from the hill between two exercises, as couples visit the  supper-room between two dances of a modern ball.  In the Forty-Five, some  foraging Highlanders from Prince Charlie's army fell upon Swanston in the  dawn.  The great-grandfather of the late farmer was then a little child;  him they awakened by plucking the blankets from his bed, and he  remembered, when he was an old man, their truculent looks and uncouth  speech.  The churn stood full of cream in the dairy, and with this they  made their brose in high delight.  'It was braw brose,' said one of them.  At last they made off, laden like camels with their booty; and Swanston  Farm has lain out of the way of history from that time forward.  I do not  know what may be yet in store for it.  On dark days, when the mist runs  low upon the hill, the house has a gloomy air as if suitable for private  tragedy.  But in hot July, you can fancy nothing more perfect than the  garden, laid out in alleys and arbours and bright, old-fashioned  flower-plots, and ending in a miniature ravine, all trellis-work and moss  and tinkling waterfall, and housed from the sun under fathoms of broad  foliage.    The hamlet behind is one of the least considerable of hamlets, and  consists of a few cottages on a green beside a burn.  Some of them (a  strange thing in Scotland) are models of internal neatness; the beds  adorned with patchwork, the shelves arrayed with willow-pattern plates,  the floors and tables bright with scrubbing or pipe-clay, and the very  kettle polished like silver.  It is the sign of a contented old age in  country places, where there is little matter for gossip and no street  sights.  Housework becomes an art; and at evening, when the cottage  interior shines and twinkles in the glow of the fire, the housewife folds  her hands and contemplates her finished picture; the snow and the wind  may do their worst, she has made herself a pleasant corner in the world.  The city might be a thousand miles away, and yet it was from close by  that Mr. Bough painted the distant view of Edinburgh which has been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38207"],[0,"On the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (#12)"],[1,"r. Darwin's views, a life-history in which the mouth is first  mandibulate and then suctorial, as, for example, in a butterfly. A clue  to the difficulty may, I think, be found in the distinction between  developmental and adaptive changes; to which I have called attention in  a previous chapter. The larva of an insect is by no means a mere stage  in the development of the perfect animal. On the contrary, it is subject  to the influence of natural selection, and undergoes changes which have  reference entirely to its own requirements and condition. It is evident,  then, that while the embryonic development of an animal in the egg may  be an epitome of its specific history, this is by no means the case  with species in which the immature forms have a separate and  independent existence. If an animal which, when young, pursues one mode  of life, and lives on one kind of food, subsequently, either from its  own growth in size and strength, or from any change of season, alters  its habits or food, however slightly, it immediately becomes subject to  the action of new forces: natural selection affects it in two different,  and, it may be, very distinct manners, gradually tending to changes  which may become so great as to involve an intermediate period of change  and quiescence.    There are, however, peculiar difficulties in those cases in which, as  among the Lepidoptera, the same species is mandibulate as a larva, and  suctorial as an imago. From this point of view _Campodea_ and the  Collembola (_Podura_, &c.) are peculiarly interesting. There are in  insects three principal types of mouth:--    First, the mandibulate;    Secondly, the suctorial; and    Thirdly, that of _Campodea_ and the Collembola generally,    in which the mandibles and maxillae are retracted, but have some freedom  of motion, and can be used for biting and chewing soft substances. This  type is, in some respects, intermediate between the other two. Assuming  that certain representatives of such a type were placed under conditions  which made a suctorial mouth advantageous, those individuals in which  the mandibles and maxillae were best calculated to pierce or prick would  be favoured by natural selection, and their power of lateral motion  would tend to fall into abeyance; while, on the other hand, if  masticatory jaws were an advantage, the opposite process would take  place.    There is yet a third possibility--namely, that during the first portion  of life, the power of mastication should be an advantage, and during the  second that of suction, or _vice versa_. A certain kind of food might  abound at one season and fail at another; might be suitable for the  animal at one age and not at another. Now in such cases we should have  two forces acting successively on each individual, and tending to modify  the organization of the mouth in different directions. It cannot be  denied that the innumerable variations in the mouth-parts of insects  have special reference to their mode of life, and are of some advantage  to the species in which they occur. Hence, no believer in natural  selection can doubt the possibility of the three cases above suggested,  the last of which seems to throw some light on the possible origin of  species which are mandibulate in one period of life and not in another.  Granting then the transition from the one condition to the other, this  would no doubt take place contemporaneously with a change of skin. At  such times we know that, even when there is no change in form, the  softness of the organs temporarily precludes the insect from feeding for  a time, as, for instance, in the case of caterpillars. If, however, any  considerable change were involved, this period of fasting must be  prolonged, and would lead to the existence of a third condition, that of  the pupa, intermediate between the other two. Since the acquisition of  wings is a more conspicuous change than any relating to the mouth, we  are apt to associate with it the existence of a pupa-state: but the case  of the Orthoptera (grasshoppers, &c.) is sufficient proof that the  development of wings is perfectly compatible with permanent activity;  the necessity for prolonged rest is in reality much more intimately  connected with the change in the constitution of the mouth, although in  many cases, no doubt, this is accompanied by changes in the legs, and in  the internal organization. An originally mandibulate mouth, however,  like that of a beetle, could not, I think, have been directly modified  into a suctorial organ like that of a butterfly or a gnat, because the  intermediate stages would necessarily be injurious. Neither, on the  other hand, for the same reasons, could the mouth of the Hemiptera be  modified into a mandibulate type like that of the Coleoptera. But in  _Campodea_ and the _Collembola_ we have a type of animal closely  resembling certain larvae which occur both in the mandibulate and  suctorial series of insects, possessing a mouth neither distinctly  mandibulate nor distinctly suctorial, but constituted on a peculiar  type, capable of modification in either direction by gradual change,  without loss of utility.    In discussing this subject, it is necessary also to take into  consideration the nature and origin of wings. Whence are they derived?  why are there normally two pairs? and why are they attached to the  meso-and meta-thorax? These questions are as difficult as they are  interesting. It has been suggested, and I think with justice, that the  wings of insects originally served for aquatic and respiratory  purposes.    In the larva of _Chloeon_ (Pl. IV., Fig. 1), for instance, which in  other respects so singularly resembles _Campodea_ (Pl. III., Fig. 5),  several of the segments are provided with foliaceous expansions which  serve as respiratory organs. These so-called branchiae are in constant  agitation, and the muscles which move them in several points resemble  those of true wings. It is true that in _Chloeon_ the vibration of the  branchiae is scarcely, if at all, utilized for the purpose of locomotion;  the branchiae are, in fact, placed too far back to act efficiently. The  situation of these branchiae differs in different groups; indeed, it  seems probable that originally there were a pair on each segment. In  such a case, those branchiae situated near the centre of the body,  neither too much in front nor too far back, would serve the most  efficiently as propellers: the same causes which determined the position  of the legs would also affect the wings. Thus a division of labour would  be effected; the branchiae on the thorax would be devoted to locomotion;  those on the abdomen to respiration. This would tend to increase the  development of the thoracic segments, already somewhat enlarged, in  order to receive the muscles of the legs.    That wings may be of use to insects under water is proved by the very  interesting case of _Polynema natans_,[46] which uses its wings for  swimming. This, however, is a rare case, and it is possible that the  principal use of the wings was, primordially, to enable the mature forms  to pass from pond to pond, thus securing fresh habitats and avoiding  in-and-in breeding. If this were so, the development of wings would  gradually have been relegated to a late period of life; and by the  tendency to the inheritance of characters at corresponding ages, which  Mr. Darwin has pointed out,[47] the development of wings would have thus  become associated with the maturity of the insect. Thus the late  acquisition of wings in the Insecta generally seems to be itself an  indication of their descent from a stock which was at one period, if not  originally, aquatic, and which probably resembled the present larvae of  _Chloeon_ in form, but had thoracic as well as abdominal branchiae.    Finally, from the subject of metamorphosis we pass naturally to that  most remarkable phenomenon which is known as the \"Alternation of  Generations:\" for the first systematic view of which we are indebted to  my eminent friend Prof Steenstrup.[48]    I have always felt it very difficult to understand why any species  should have been created in this double character; nor, so far as I am  aware, has any explanation of the fact yet been attempted. Nevertheless  insects offer, in their metamorphoses, a phenomenon not altogether  dissimilar, and give a clue to the manner in which alternation of  generations may have originated.    The caterpillar owes its difference from the butterfly to the  undeveloped state in which it leaves the egg; but its actual form is  mainly due to the influence of the conditions under which it lives. If  the caterpillar, instead of changing into one butterfly, produced  several, we should have an instance of alternation of generations. Until  lately, however, we knew of no such case among insects; each larva  produced one imago, and that not by generation, but by development. It  has long been known, indeed, that there are species in which certain  individuals remain always apterous, while others acquire wings. Many  entomologists, however, regard these abnormal individuals as perfect,  though wingless insects; and therefore I shall found no argument upon  these cases, although they appear to me deserving of more attention than  they have yet received.    Recently, however, Prof. Wagner[49] has discovered that, among certain  small gnats, the larvae do not directly produce in all cases perfect  insects, but give birth to other larvae, which undergo metamorphoses of  the usual character, and eventually become gnats. His observations have  been confirmed, as regards this main fact, by other naturalists; and  Grimm has met with a species of _Chironomus_ in which the pupae lay  eggs.[50]    Here, then, we have a distinct case of alternation of generations, as  characterized by Steenstrup. Probably other cases will be discovered in  which insects undeniably in the larval state will be found"]]]
