Wagner makes this fact pathetic, comical,  and altogether charming in his \"Mastersingers of Nuremberg.\"    Till Duerer's time, however, there had been little painting that could  be regarded as art, and when he came to study it there was but little  opportunity in his own land, but Duerer was destined to bring art to  Nuremberg. If he went elsewhere to study, it was only for a little  time, because he was above all things patriotic and dearly loved his  home.    With seventeen brothers and sisters, young Duerer's problem was a  serious one. His father not only meant him to become a goldsmith like  himself--a craft in which there was much money to be made at a time  when people dressed with great ornamentation and used gold to decorate  with--it was highly necessary with so large a family that he should  learn to do that which could make him helpful to his father. Hence the  young boy entered his father's shop. If he had not been handicapped  with so many to help to maintain, he would have laid up a considerable  fortune, because from the very beginning he was master of all that he  undertook; doing the least thing better than any other did it, putting  conscience and painstaking into all.    \"My father took special delight in me,\" the son said, \"seeing that I  was industrious in working and learning, he put me to school; and when  I had learned to read and write, he took me home from my school and  taught me the goldsmith's trade.\"    The family were good and kind; excellent neighbours, deeply religious,  and little Albrecht certainly was comely. He was beautiful as a little  child, and as a man was very handsome, with long light hair sweeping  his shoulders, and gentle eyes. He was very tall, stately, and full of  dignity.    In his father's shop he made little clay figures which were afterward  moulded in metal; also he learned to carve wood and ivory, and he  added the touch of originality to all that he did. He was the Leonardo  da Vinci of Germany, an intellectual man, a poet, painter, sculptor,  engraver, and engineer. He approached everything that he did from an  intellectual point of view, looking for the reasons of things.    After a while in his father's shop, he found mere craftsmanship  irksome, and he begged to be allowed to enter a studio. This was a  great disappointment to the father, even a distress, because he could  see no very quick nor large returns in money for an artist, and he  sorely needed the help of his son; but being kind and reasonable, he  consented Albrecht was apprenticed to the only artist of any repute  then in Nuremberg, Wolgemuth.    To his studio Albrecht went, at the age of fifteen, and if he did not  learn much more of painting, under that artist's direction, than his  own genius had already taught him, he learned the drudgery of his  work; how to grind colours and to mix them, and he studied wood  engraving also.    In Wolgemuth's studio he remained for the three years of his  apprenticeship, and then he fled to better things. For a time he  followed the methods of another German artist, Schongauer, but finally  he went forth to try his luck alone. He wandered from place to place,  practising all his trades, goldsmithing, engraving, whatever would  support him, yet always and everywhere painting.    It is thought that he may have gone as far as Italy, but it is not  certain whether he went there in his first wanderings or later  on. However, he was soon recalled home, for his father had found a  suitable wife for him. She was the daughter of a rich citizen and her  name was Agnes Frey. She was pretty as well as rich, but had she been  neither Albrecht would have returned at his father's bidding. There  was never any resistance to the fine and proper things of life on  Albrecht Duerer's part. He was the well balanced, reasonable man from  youth up.    There have been extraordinary tales told of the artist's wife. She has  been called hateful and spiteful as Xantippe, the wife of Socrates,  but we think this is calumny. The stories came about in this way:  Duerer had a life-long friend, Wilibald Pirkheimer, who in his old age  became the most malicious and quarrelsome of old fellows. He lived  longer than Duerer did, and Duerer's wife also outlived her  husband. Pirkheimer wanted a set of antlers which had belonged to  Duerer and which he thought the wife should give him after Duerer was  dead, but Agnes thought otherwise and would not give them up. Then,  full of rage, the old man wrote the most outrageous letters about poor  Agnes, saying that she was a shrew and had compelled Duerer to work  himself to death; that she was a miser and had led the artist an awful  dance through life. This is the only evidence against her, and that so  sane and sensible a man as the artist lived with her all his life and  cherished her, is evidence enough that Pirkheimer didn't tell the  truth. When Duerer died he was in good circumstances and instead of  being overworked, he for many years had done no \"pot-boiling,\" but had  followed investigations along lines that pleased him. After his death,  the widow treated his brothers and sisters generously, giving them  properties of Duerer's and being of much help to them. During the  artist's life he and she had travelled everywhere together and had  appeared to love each other tenderly; hence we may conclude that the  old Pirkheimer was simply a disgruntled, gouty old man without a good  word for anybody.    If Duerer's father and mother had eighteen children, Albrecht and Agnes  struck a balance, for they had none. Whether or not Duerer went to  Italy before his marriage in 1494, certain it is that he was in  Venice, the home of Titian, in 1506. Titian was six years younger than  Duerer, who was then about thirty-five years old. It is said that he  started for Italy in 1505 and that he went the whole of the way, over  the Alps, through forests and streams, on horseback. Who knows but it  was during that very journey, while travelling alone, often finding  himself in lonely ways, and full of the speculative thoughts that were  characteristic of him, that he did not think first of his subject,  \"Knight, Death, and the Devil,\" which helped make his fame. In that  picture we have a knight, helmeted, carrying his lance, mounted upon  his horse, riding in a lonely forest, with death upon a \"pale horse\"  by his side, holding an hour glass to remind the knight of the  fleeting of time. Behind comes the devil, with trident and horn,  represented as a frightful and disgusting beast, which follows  hot-foot after the lonely knight, who looks neither to right nor left,  but persistently goes his way.    Titian's teacher, Bellini, was still living, and he was one of Duerer's  greatest admirers. Especially did he believe that he could paint the  finest hair of any artist in the world. One day, while studying  Duerer's work, and being especially fascinated by the hair of one of  his figures, the old man took Duerer's brush and tried to reproduce as  beautiful a tress. Presently he put down the brush in despair, but the  younger artist took it up, still wet with the same colours, and in a  few brilliant strokes produced a lovely lock of woman's hair.    While luxuriating in Venetian heat, Duerer wrote home to his friend  Pirkheimer: \"Oh, how I shall freeze after this sunshine!\" He was a  lover of warm, beautiful colour, gay and tender life. Most of all he  loved the fatherland, and all the honours paid him and all the  invitations pressed upon him could not keep him long from  Nuremberg. The journey homeward was not uneventful because he was  taken ill, and had to stop at a house on his way, where he was cared  for till he was strong enough to proceed. Before he went his way he  painted upon the wall of that house a fine picture, to show his  gratitude for the kind treatment he had received. Imagine a people so  settled in their homes that it would be worth while for an artist who  came along to leave a picture upon the walls to-day--we should have  moved to a new house or a new flat almost before Duerer could have  washed his brushes and turned the corner.    Back in Nuremberg, he settled down into the life of a responsible  citizen, lived in a fine new house, in time became a member of the  council, and his studio was a veritable workshop. Studios were quite  different from those of to-day. Then the pupils turned to and ground  colours, did much of their own manufacturing, engaged at first in such  commonplace occupations, which were nevertheless teaching them the  foundation of their art, while they watched the work of the  master. Such a studio as Duerer's must have been full of young men  coming and going, not all working at the art of painting, but  engraving, preparing materials for such work, designing, and executing  many other details of art work.    After this time Duerer made his smallest picture, which is hardly more  than an inch in diameter. On that tiny surface he painted the whole  story of the crucifixion, and it is now in the Dresden Gallery. To  those of us who see little mentality in the faces of the Italian  subjects, the German art of Duerer, often ugly in the choice of models,  and so exact as to bring out unpleasing details, is nevertheless the  greater; because in all cases, the faces have sincere expressions. They  exhibit human purposes and emotions which we can understand, and  despise or love as the case may be.    They say that his Madonna is generally a \"much-dressed round-faced  German mother, holding a merry little German boy.\" That may be true;  but at any rate, she is every inch a mother and he a well-beloved  little boy, which is considerably more than can be said of some  Italian performances.    Duerer made a painting of \"Praying Hands,\" a queer subject for a  picture, but those hands are nothing _but_ praying hands. The story of  them is touching. It is said that for several years"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6933"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part II: The Jesuits in North America in (#12)"],[1,"   To the institutions, traditions, rites, usages, and festivals of the  league the Iroquois was inseparably wedded. He clung to them with Indian  tenacity; and he clings to them still. His political fabric was one of  ancient ideas and practices, crystallized into regular and enduring  forms. In its component parts it has nothing peculiar to itself. All its  elements are found in other tribes: most of them belong to the whole  Indian race. Undoubtedly there was a distinct and definite effort of  legislation; but Iroquois legislation invented nothing. Like all sound  legislation, it built of materials already prepared. It organized the  chaotic past, and gave concrete forms to Indian nature itself. The  people have dwindled and decayed; but, banded by its ties of clan and  kin, the league, in feeble miniature, still subsists, and the degenerate  Iroquois looks back with a mournful pride to the glory of the past.    Would the Iroquois, left undisturbed to work out their own destiny, ever  have emerged from the savage state? Advanced as they were beyond most  other American tribes, there is no indication whatever of a tendency to  overpass the confines of a wild hunter and warrior life. They were  inveterately attached to it, impracticable conservatists of barbarism,  and in ferocity and cruelty they matched the worst of their race. Nor  did the power of expansion apparently belonging to their system ever  produce much result. Between the years 1712 and 1715, the Tuscaroras, a  kindred people, were admitted into the league as a sixth nation; but  they were never admitted on equal terms. Long after, in the period of  their decline, several other tribes were announced as new members of the  league; but these admissions never took effect. The Iroquois were always  reluctant to receive other tribes, or parts of tribes, collectively,  into the precincts of the \"Long House.\" Yet they constantly practised a  system of adoptions, from which, though cruel and savage, they drew  great advantages. Their prisoners of war, when they had burned and  butchered as many of them as would serve to sate their own ire and that  of their women, were divided, man by man, woman by woman, and child by  child, adopted into different families and clans, and thus incorporated  into the nation. It was by this means, and this alone, that they could  offset the losses of their incessant wars. Early in the eighteenth  century, and even long before, a vast proportion of their population  consisted of adopted prisoners. [57]    [57] Relation, 1660, 7 (anonymous). The Iroquois were at the height of  their prosperity about the year 1650. Morgan reckons their number at  this time at 25,000 souls; but this is far too high an estimate. The  author of the Relation of 1660 makes their whole number of warriors  2,200. Le Mercier, in the Relation of 1665, says 2,350. In the Journal  of Greenhalgh, an Englishman who visited them in 1677, their warriors  are set down at 2,150. Du Chesneau, in 1681, estimates them at 2,000; De  la Barre, in 1684, at 2,600, they having been strengthened by adoptions.  A memoir addressed to the Marquis de Seignelay, in 1687, again makes  them 2,000. (See N. Y. Col. Docs., IX. 162, 196, 321.) These estimates  imply a total population of ten or twelve thousand.    The anonymous writer of the Relation of 1660 may well remark: \"It is  marvellous that so few should make so great a havoc, and strike such  terror into so many tribes.\"    It remains to speak of the religious and superstitious ideas which so  deeply influenced Indian life.      RELIGION AND SUPERSTITIONS.    The religious belief of the North-American Indians seems, on a first  view, anomalous and contradictory. It certainly is so, if we adopt the  popular impression. Romance, Poetry, and Rhetoric point, on the one  hand, to the august conception of a one all-ruling Deity, a Great  Spirit, omniscient and omnipresent; and we are called to admire the  untutored intellect which could conceive a thought too vast for Socrates  and Plato. On the other hand, we find a chaos of degrading, ridiculous,  and incoherent superstitions. A closer examination will show that the  contradiction is more apparent than real. We will begin with the lowest  forms of Indian belief, and thence trace it upward to the highest  conceptions to which the unassisted mind of the savage attained.    To the Indian, the material world is sentient and intelligent. Birds,  beasts, and reptiles have ears for human prayers, and are endowed with  an influence on human destiny. A mysterious and inexplicable power  resides in inanimate things. They, too, can listen to the voice of man,  and influence his life for evil or for good. Lakes, rivers, and  waterfalls are sometimes the dwelling-place of spirits; but more  frequently they are themselves living beings, to be propitiated by  prayers and offerings. The lake has a soul; and so has the river, and  the cataract. Each can hear the words of men, and each can be pleased or  offended. In the silence of a forest, the gloom of a deep ravine,  resides a living mystery, indefinite, but redoubtable. Through all the  works of Nature or of man, nothing exists, however seemingly trivial,  that may not be endowed with a secret power for blessing or for bane.    Men and animals are closely akin. Each species of animal has its great  archetype, its progenitor or king, who is supposed to exist somewhere,  prodigious in size, though in shape and nature like his subjects. A  belief prevails, vague, but perfectly apparent, that men themselves owe  their first parentage to beasts, birds, or reptiles, as bears, wolves,  tortoises, or cranes; and the names of the totemic clans, borrowed in  nearly every case from animals, are the reflection of this idea. [58]    [58] This belief occasionally takes a perfectly definite shape. There  was a tradition among Northern and Western tribes, that men were created  from the carcasses of beasts, birds, and fishes, by Manabozho, a  mythical personage, to be described hereafter. The Amikouas, or People  of the Beaver, an Algonquin tribe of Lake Huron, claimed descent from  the carcass of the great original beaver, or father of the beavers. They  believed that the rapids and cataracts on the French River and the Upper  Ottawa were caused by dams made by their amphibious ancestor. (See the  tradition in Perrot, MÃ©moire sur les MÅurs, Coustumes et Relligion des  Sauvages de l'AmÃ©rique Septentrionale, p. 20.) Charlevoix tells the same  story. Each Indian was supposed to inherit something of the nature of  the animal whence he sprung.    An Indian hunter was always anxious to propitiate the animals he sought  to kill. He has often been known to address a wounded bear in a long  harangue of apology. [59] The bones of the beaver were treated with  especial tenderness, and carefully kept from the dogs, lest the spirit  of the dead beaver, or his surviving brethren, should take offence. [60]  This solicitude was not confined to animals, but extended to inanimate  things. A remarkable example occurred among the Hurons, a people  comparatively advanced, who, to propitiate their fishing-nets, and  persuade them to do their office with effect, married them every year to  two young girls of the tribe, with a ceremony more formal than that  observed in the case of mere human wedlock. [61] The fish, too, no less  than the nets, must be propitiated; and to this end they were addressed  every evening from the fishing-camp by one of the party chosen for that  function, who exhorted them to take courage and be caught, assuring them  that the utmost respect should be shown to their bones. The harangue,  which took place after the evening meal, was made in solemn form; and  while it lasted, the whole party, except the speaker, were required to  lie on their backs, silent and motionless, around the fire. [62]    [59] McKinney, Tour to the Lakes, 284, mentions the discomposure of a  party of Indians when shown a stuffed moose. Thinking that its spirit  would be offended at the indignity shown to its remains, they surrounded  it, making apologetic speeches, and blowing tobacco-smoke at it as a  propitiatory offering.  [60] This superstition was very prevalent, and numerous examples of it  occur in old and recent writers, from Father Le Jeune to Captain Carver.  [61] There are frequent allusions to this ceremony in the early writers.  The Algonquins of the Ottawa practised it, as well as the Hurons.  Lalemant, in his chapter \"Du Regne de Satan en ces ContrÃ©es\" (Relation  des Hurons, 1639), says that it took place yearly, in the middle of  March. As it was indispensable that the brides should be virgins, mere  children were chosen. The net was held between them; and its spirit, or  oki, was harangued by one of the chiefs, who exhorted him to do his part  in furnishing the tribe with food. Lalemant was told that the spirit of  the net had once appeared in human form to the Algonquins, complaining  that he had lost his wife, and warning them, that, unless they could  find him another equally immaculate, they would catch no more fish.  [62] Sagard, Le Grand Voyage du Pays des Hurons, 257. Other old writers  make a similar statement.    Besides ascribing life and intelligence to the material world, animate  and inanimate, the Indian believes in supernatural existences, known  among the Algonquins as Manitous, and among the Iroquois and Hurons as  Okies or Otkons. These words comprehend all forms of supernatural being,  from the highest to the lowest, with the exception, possibly, of certain  diminutive fairies or hobgoblins, and certain giants and anomalous  monsters, which appear under various forms, grotesque and horrible, in  the Indian fireside legends. [63] There are local manitous of streams,  rocks, mountains, cataracts, and forests. The conception of these beings  betrays, for the most part, a striking poverty of imagination.
