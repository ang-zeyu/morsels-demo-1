The little beavers were still with  their mothers in the big houses that looked like great domes of sticks  and mud out in the middle of the lake. There were three of these  houses, one of them at least twenty feet in diameter. Baree had some  difficulty in following his side of the pond. When he got back among  the willows and alders and birch, dozens of little canals crossed and  crisscrossed in his path. Some of these canals were a foot wide, and  others three or four feet, and all were filled with water. No country  in the world ever had a better system of traffic than this domain of  the beavers, down which they brought their working materials and food  into the main reservoir--the pond.    In one of the larger canals Baree surprised a big beaver towing a  four-foot cutting of birch as thick through as a man's leg--half a  dozen breakfasts and dinners and suppers in that one cargo. The four or  five inner barks of the birch are what might be called the bread and  butter and potatoes of the beaver menu, while the more highly prized  barks of the willow and young alder take the place of meat and pie.  Baree smelled curiously of the birch cutting after the old beaver had  abandoned it in flight, and then went on. He did not try to conceal  himself now, and at least half a dozen beavers had a good look at him  before he came to the point where the pond narrowed down to the width  of the stream, almost half a mile from the dam. Then he wandered back.  All that morning he hovered about the pond, showing himself openly.    In their big mud-and-stick strongholds the beavers held a council of  war. They were distinctly puzzled. There were four enemies which they  dreaded above all others: the otter, who destroyed their dams in the  wintertime and brought death to them from cold and by lowering the  water so they could not get to their food supplies; the lynx, who  preyed on them all, young and old alike; and the fox and wolf, who  would lie in ambush for hours in order to pounce on the very young,  like Umisk and his playmates. If Baree had been any one of these four,  wily Beaver Tooth and his people would have known what to do. But Baree  was surely not an otter, and if he was a fox or a wolf or a lynx, his  actions were very strange, to say the least. Half a dozen times he had  had the opportunity to pounce on his prey, if he had been seeking prey.  But at no time had he shown the least desire to harm them.    It may be that the beavers discussed the matter fully among themselves.  It is possible that Umisk and his playmates told their parents of their  adventure, and of how Baree had made no move to harm them when he could  quite easily have caught them. It is also more than likely that the  older beavers who had fled from Baree that morning gave an account of  their adventures, again emphasizing the fact that the stranger, while  frightening them, had shown no disposition to attack them. All this is  quite possible, for if beavers can make a large part of a continent's  history, and can perform engineering feats that nothing less than  dynamite can destroy, it is only reasonable to suppose that they have  some way of making one another understand.    However this may be, courageous old Beaver Tooth took it upon himself  to end the suspense.    It was early in the afternoon that for the third or fourth time Baree  walked out on the dam. This dam was fully two hundred feet in length,  but at no point did the water run over it, the overflow finding its way  through narrow sluices. A week or two ago Baree could have crossed to  the opposite side of the pond on this dam, but now--at the far  end--Beaver Tooth and his engineers were adding a new section of dam,  and in order to accomplish their work more easily, they had flooded  fully fifty yards of the low ground on which they were working.    The main dam held a strange fascination for Baree. It was strong with  the smell of beaver. The top of it was high and dry, and there were  dozens of smoothly worn little hollows in which the beavers had taken  their sun baths. In one of these hollows Baree stretched himself out,  with his eyes on the pond. Not a ripple stirred its velvety smoothness.  Not a sound broke the drowsy stillness of the afternoon. The beavers  might have been dead or asleep, for all the stir they made. And yet  they knew that Baree was on the dam. Where he lay, the sun fell in a  warm flood, and it was so comfortable that after a time he had  difficulty in keeping his eyes open to watch the pond. Then he fell  asleep.    Just how Beaver Tooth sensed this fact is a mystery. Five minutes later  he came up quietly, without a splash or a sound, within fifty yards of  Baree. For a few moments he scarcely moved in the water. Then he swam  very slowly parallel with the dam across the pond. At the other side he  drew himself ashore, and for another minute sat as motionless as a  stone, with his eyes on that part of the dam where Baree was lying. Not  another beaver was moving, and it was very soon apparent that Beaver  Tooth had but one object in mind--getting a closer observation of  Baree. When he entered the water again, he swam along close to the dam.  Ten feet beyond Baree he began to climb out. He did this with great  slowness and caution. At last he reached the top of the dam.    A few yards away Baree was almost hidden in his hollow, only the top of  his shiny black body appearing to Beaver Tooth's scrutiny. To get a  better look, the old beaver spread his flat tail out beyond him and  rose to a sitting posture on his hindquarters, his two front paws held  squirrel-like over his breast. In this pose he was fully three feet  tall. He probably weighed forty pounds, and in some ways he resembled  one of those fat, good-natured, silly-looking dogs that go largely to  stomach. But his brain was working with amazing celerity. Suddenly he  gave the hard mud of the dam a single slap with his tail--and Baree sat  up. Instantly he saw Beaver Tooth, and stared. Beaver Tooth stared. For  a full half-minute neither moved the thousandth part of an inch. Then  Baree stood up and wagged his tail.    That was enough. Dropping to his forefeet. Beaver Tooth waddled  leisurely to the edge of the dam and dived over. He was neither  cautious nor in very great haste now. He made a great commotion in the  water and swam boldly back and forth under Baree. When he had done this  several times, he cut straight up the pond to the largest of the three  houses and disappeared. Five minutes after Beaver Tooth's exploit word  was passing quickly among the colony. The stranger--Baree--was not a  lynx. He was not a fox. He was not a wolf. Moreover, he was very  young--and harmless. Work could be resumed. Play could be resumed.  There was no danger. Such was Beaver Tooth's verdict.    If someone had shouted these facts in beaver language through a  megaphone, the response could not have been quicker. All at once it  seemed to Baree, who was still standing on the edge of the dam, that  the pond was alive with beavers. He had never seen so many at one time  before. They were popping up everywhere, and some of them swam up  within a dozen feet of him and looked him over in a leisurely and  curious way. For perhaps five minutes the beavers seemed to have no  particular object in view. Then Beaver Tooth himself struck straight  for the shore and climbed out. Others followed him. Half a dozen  workers disappeared in the canals. As many more waddled out among the  alders and willows. Eagerly Baree watched for Umisk and his chums. At  last he saw them, swimming forth from one of the smaller houses. They  climbed out on their playground--the smooth bar above the shore of mud.  Baree wagged his tail so hard that his whole body shook, and hurried  along the dam.    When he came out on the level strip of shore, Umisk was there alone,  nibbling his supper from a long, freshly cut willow. The other little  beavers had gone into a thick clump of young alders.    This time Umisk did not run. He looked up from his stick. Baree  squatted himself, wiggling in a most friendly and ingratiating manner.  For a few seconds Umisk regarded him.    Then, very coolly, he resumed his supper.        CHAPTER 10    Just as in the life of every man there is one big, controlling  influence, either for good or bad, so in the life of Baree the beaver  pond was largely an arbiter of destiny. Where he might have gone if he  had not discovered it, and what might have happened to him, are matters  of conjecture. But it held him. It began to take the place of the old  windfall, and in the beavers themselves he found a companionship which  made up, in a way, for his loss of the protection and friendship of  Kazan and Gray Wolf.    This companionship, if it could be called that, went just so far and no  farther. With each day that passed the older beavers became more  accustomed to seeing Baree. At the end of two weeks, if Baree had gone  away, they would have missed him--but not in the same way that Baree  would have missed the beavers. It was a matter of good-natured  toleration on their part. With Baree it was different. He was still  uskahis, as Nepeese would have said. He still wanted mothering; he was  still moved by the puppyish yearnings which he had not yet had the time  to outgrow; and when night came--to speak that yearning quite  plainly--he had the desire to go into the big beaver house with Umisk  and his chums and sleep.    During this fortnight that followed Beaver Tooth's exploit on the dam  Baree ate his meals a mile up the creek, where there were plenty of  crayfish. But the pond was home. Night always found him there, and a  large part of his day. He slept at the end of the dam, or on top of it  on particularly clear nights, and the beavers accepted him as a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47519"],[0,"President Heber C. Kimball's Journal (#12)"],[1," him.    This was a gloomy time!    On the 30th of October, 1838, we discovered several thousand of the mob  coming to Far West, under pretense of being government troops. They  passed through our corn and wheat fields, making a complete desolation  of every thing in their way.    Brother Brigham Young and I were appointed captains of fifty, in a  hurry, and commanded to take our position right in the thoroughfare on  which the mob were seen advancing to the city, momentarily anticipating  the awful tragedy of a bloody massacre. Joseph was with us, giving  counsel.    The army came up to good rifle shot distance and halted. Seeing our  temporary fortifications, which we had thrown up the night previous,  by pulling down some of our houses, and fixing up our wagon, they  dared not approach nearer, but retreated back to Goose Creek, about  three-fourths of a mile, screaming, hallooing and screeching. The mob  afterwards declared there were fifteen hundred of us stationed there  to prevent their approach, but to my certain knowledge there were only  about one hundred and fifty in that line.    The word came that Joseph Smith and several others were to be given up;  otherwise the mob would massacre every man, woman and child.    In order to prevent the execution of this threat, Joseph gave himself  up, with Elders Sidney Rigdon, P. P. Pratt, Lyman Wight and George W.  Robinson, they having been betrayed into the camp by Col. George M.  Hinkle and other apostates.    On the 1st of November, the mob, professing to be the regular militia  of the State of Missouri, numbering about seven thousand, surrounded  Far West. Our men were all taken prisoners and then marched a short  distance into a hollow, where Col. Lucas had previously pointed his  cannon in full range, so that if we failed to lay down our arms, he  could easily sweep us into eternity, which was his design. We were then  formed into a hollow square and commanded by Col. Lucas to ground arms  and deliver up our weapons of war, although they were our own private  property. After being marched back a short distance, on the public  square, we were again formed into a hollow square, near the house of  Widow Beeman.    The mob commenced plundering the citizens of their bedding, money,  wearing apparel and everything of value they could lay their hands  upon. Much property was destroyed by the burning of houses, logs,  rails, corn cribs, boards, etc., the using of corn and hay, the killing  of cattle, sheep and hogs, etc., and all this without regard to owners,  or asking leave of any one. In the meantime, men were abused, and women  insulted, and treated with violence by the troops, while the men were  kept prisoners.    We were compelled at the point of the bayonet to sign a deed of trust  for the purpose of making our individual property liable, as they said,  to pay all the debts of persons belonging to the Church, and also for  all damages the old inhabitants of Daviess County might have sustained  in consequence of the late difficulties in that County.    When General Clark arrived, the first important move made by him, was  collecting our men together on the square, and selecting about fifty of  them, whom he immediately marched into a house and confined closely.  This was done without the aid of the sheriff or any legal process.    The next day, forty-six of those taken, with the Prophet Joseph, were  driven, like a parcel of menial slaves, off to Richmond, not knowing  why they were taken.    When these troops surrounded us, and we were brought into a hollow  square, the first persons that I knew, were men who had once professed  to be our brethren. They were the men who piloted the mob into our  city, namely: William E. McLellin and Lyman E. Johnson, two of the  Twelve; John Whitmer and David Whitmer, two of the witnesses to the  Book of Mormon; William W. Phelps, and scores of others, \"hail fellows,  well met.\"    A portion of the troops were painted like Indians, and looked horrible.  They were led by Niel Gillum, who styled himself \"the Delaware chief,\"  who, with many others, cocked his gun upon us and swore he would blow  our brains out, although we were disarmed and helpless.    William E. McLellin inquired where Heber C. Kimball was, and some one  pointed me out to him. I was sitting on the ground. When he came up  to me, he said, \"Brother Heber, what do you think of Joseph Smith,  the fallen prophet, now? Has he not led you blindfolded long enough?  Look and see yourself poor, your family stripped and robbed, and your  brethren in the same fix. Are you not satisfied with Joseph?\"    I replied, \"Yes, I am more satisfied a hundred fold than I was before;  for I see you in the very position that he foretold you would be in--a  Judas to betray your brethren, if you did not forsake your adultery,  fornication, lying and abominations. Where are you? What are you  about--you, and Hinkle, and scores of others? Have you not betrayed  Joseph and his brethren into the hands of the mob, as Judas did Jesus?  Yes, verily, you have! I tell you 'Mormonism' is true, and Joseph is  a true Prophet of the living God, and you with all others that turn  therefrom will be damned and go to hell, and Judas will rule over you!\"    Soon after this, when things began to be a little more quiet, I desired  to go to my home to get something to eat, many of us not having eaten  any food for twenty-four hours. I asked some of the mob standing near  if I could have the privilege of going to my house, a little distance  off. They referred me to their captain, who was Bogart, the Methodist  preacher. I went to him and told him what I wanted. He first spoke of  sending some one with me, as I would be liable to be shot if found  alone. In a short time, however, he said, \"I will go with you.\"    He went down to my house, and my wife got some dinner and he ate with  me; then we returned, and I again took my seat on the ground with my  brethren who were under guard.    The next day I was permitted to return to my home, but told that I need  not try to leave the city as it was surrounded with a strong guard to  prohibit any one leaving the place. The mob were engaged taking every  man a prisoner who seemed to have any influence, and putting him in  chains to await a trial.    It was rumored that all the men who were in the Crooked River battle  would be taken prisoners; therefore, many of them fled to the north  before the guards were placed around the city.    The 6th of November, General Clark delivered his noted extermination  speech, and read over the names of fifty-six brethren who were made  prisoners, to await a trial for something they knew not what.    In order that the tyrant may not be forgotten, I insert a portion of  his speech:    \"GENTLEMEN:--You whose names are not attached to this list of names,  will now have the privilege of going to your fields, and of providing  corn, wood, etc., for your families. Those who are now taken will go  from this to prison, be tried and receive the due demerit of their  crimes; but you, (except such as charges may hereafter be preferred  against,) are at liberty, as soon as the troops are removed that now  guard the place, which I shall cause to be done immediately. It now  devolves upon you to fulfil a treaty that you have entered into, the  leading items of which I shall now lay before you. The first requires  that your leading men be given up to be tried according to law; this  you already have complied with. The second is, that you deliver up your  arms; this has been attended to. The third stipulation is that you sign  over your properties to defray the expenses of the war. This you have  also done. Another article yet remains for you to comply with--and  that is, that you leave the State forth with. And whatever may be your  feelings concerning this, or whatever your innocence, it is nothing to  me. General Lucas (whose military rank is equal with mine,) has made  this treaty with you; I approve of it. I should have done the same  had I been here. I am therefore determined to see it executed. The  character of this State has suffered almost beyond redemption, from the  character, conduct and influence that you have exerted; and we deem  it an act of justice to restore her character to its former standing  among the States by every proper means. The orders of the governor to  me were, _that you should be exterminated, and not allowed to remain in  the State_. And had not your leaders been given up, and the terms of  the treaty complied with, before this time you and your families would  have been destroyed, and your houses in ashes. There is a discretionary  power vested in my hands, which, considering your circumstances, I  shall exercise for a season. You are indebted to me for this clemency.  I do not say that you shall go now, but you must not think of staying  here another season or of putting in crops; for the moment you do this  the citizens will be upon you; and if I am called here again in case  of non-compliance of a treaty made, do not think that I shall do as  I have done now. You need not expect any mercy, but _extermination,  for I am determined the governor's order shall be executed_. As for  your leaders, do not think, do not imagine for a moment, do not let  it enter into your minds, that they will be delivered and restored to  you again, for _their fate is fixed, their die is cast, their doom is  sealed_. I am sorry, gentlemen, to see so many apparently intelligent  men found in the situation that you are; and oh! if I could invoke  that Great Spirit, THE UNKNOWN GOD, to rest upon and deliver you  from that awful chain of superstition, and liberate you from those  fetters of fanaticism with which you are bound--that you no longer do  homage to a man. I would advise you to scatter abroad, and never again  organize yourselves with Bishops, Presidents, etc., lest you excite the  jealousies of the people and subject"]]]
