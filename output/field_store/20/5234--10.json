Who ever heard of such  a thing! Wolves and all thrown in for nothing! I daresay I shall have a  tiger dropping in presently just to have a look round. No, no, my  venerable friend, that was all excellent acting about my extraordinary  delusions, and the rest of it, but I am not going to be carried so far  by them as to adhere to such an outrageously one-sided bargain.\"    Presently I remembered two things--divine Yoletta was the first; and the  second was that thought of the rare pleasure it would be to array myself  in those same \"barbarous rags,\" as I had blasphemously called them.  These things had entered into my soul, and had become a part of  me--especially--well, both. Those strange garments had looked so  refreshingly picturesque, and I had conceived such an intense longing to  wear them! Was it a very contemptible ambition on my part? Is it sinful  to wish for any adornments other than wisdom and sobriety, a meek and  loving spirit, good works, and other things of the kind? Straight into  my brain flashed the words of a sentence I had recently read--that is to  say, just before my accident--in a biological work, and it comforted me  as much as if an angel with shining face and rainbow-colored wings had  paid me a visit in my dusky cell: \"Unto Adam also, and his wife, did the  Lord God make coats of skin and clothed them. This has become, as every  one knows, a custom among the race of men, and shows at present no sign  of becoming obsolete. Moreover, that first correlation, namely,  milk-glands and a hairy covering, appears to have entered the very soul  of creatures of this class, and to have become psychical as well as  physical, for in that type, which is only _for a while_ inferior to  the angels, the fondness for this kind of outer covering is a strong,  ineradicable passion!\" Most true and noble words, O biologist of the  fiery soul! It was a delight to remember them. A \"strong and  ineradicable passion,\" not merely to clothe the body, but to clothe it  appropriately, that is to say, beautifully, and by so doing please God  and ourselves. This being so, must we go on for ever scraping our faces  with a sharp iron, until they are blue and spotty with manifold  scrapings; and cropping our hair short to give ourselves an artificial  resemblance to old dogs and monkeys--creatures lower than us in the  scale of being--and array our bodies, like mutes at a funeral, in  repulsive black--we, \"Eutheria of the Eutheria, the noble of the noble?\"  And all for what, since it pleases not heaven nor accords with our own  desires? For the sake of respectability, perhaps, whatever that may  mean. Oh, then, a million curses take it--respectability, I mean; may it  sink into the bottomless pit, and the smoke of its torment ascend for  ever and ever! And having thus, by taking thought, brought my mind into  this temper, I once more finally determined to have the clothes, and  religiously to observe the compact.    It made me quite happy to end it in this way. The hard bed, the cold  night wind blowing on me, my wolfish visitor, were all forgotten. Once  more I gave loose to my imagination, and saw myself (clothed and in my  right mind) sitting at Yoletta's feet, learning the mystery of that  sweet, tranquil life from her precious lips. A whole year was mine in  which to love her and win her gentle heart. But her hand--ah, that was  another matter. What had I to give in return for such a boon as that?  Only that strength concerning which my venerable host had spoken  somewhat encouragingly. He had also been so good as to mention my skill;  but I could scarcely trade on that. And if a whole year's labor was only  sufficient to pay for a suit of clothing, how many years of toil would  be required to win Yoletta's hand?    Naturally, at this juncture, I began to draw a parallel between my case  and that of an ancient historical personage, whose name is familiar to  most. History repeats itself--with variations. Jacob--namely,  Smith--cometh to the well of Haran. He taketh acquaintance of Rachel,  here called Yoletta. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice  and wept. That is a touch of nature I can thoroughly appreciate--the  kissing, I mean; but why he wept I cannot tell, unless it be because he  was not an Englishman. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's  brother. I am glad to have no such startling piece of information to  give to the object of my affections: we are not even distant relations,  and her age being, say, fifteen, and mine twenty-one, we are so far well  suited to each other, according to my notions. Smith covenanted! for  Yoletta, and said: \"I will serve thee seven years for Yoletta, thy  younger daughter\"; and the old gentleman answered: \"Abide with me, for I  would rather you should have her than some other person.\" Now I wonder  whether the matter will be complicated with Leah--that is, Edra? Leah  was considerably older than Rachel, and, like Edra, tender-eyed. I do  not aspire or desire to marry both, especially if I should, like Jacob,  have to begin with the wrong one, however tender-eyed: but for divine  Yoletta I could serve seven years; yea, and fourteen, if it comes to it.    Thus I mused, and thus I questioned, tossing and turning on my  inhospitable hard bed, until merciful sleep laid her quieting hands on  the strings of my brain, and hushed their weary jangling.              Chapter 8    Fortunately I woke early next morning, for I was now a member of an  early-rising family, and anxious to conform to rules. On going to the  door I found, to my inexpressible disgust, that I might easily have  closed it in the way I had seen the other door closed, by simply pulling  a sliding panel. There was ventilation enough without having the place  open to prowling beasts of prey. I also found that if I had turned up  the little stray bed I should have had warm woolen sheets to sleep in.    I resolved to say nothing about my nocturnal visitor, not wishing to  begin the day by furnishing fresh instances of what might seem like  crass stupidity on my part. While occupied with these matters I began to  hear people moving about and talking on the terrace, and peeping out, I  beheld a curious and interesting spectacle. Down the broad steps leading  to the water the people of the house were hurrying, and flinging  themselves like agile, startled frogs on the bosom of the stream. There,  in the midst of his family, my venerable host was already disporting  himself, his long, silvery beard and hair floating like a foam on the  waves of his own creating. And presently from other sleeping-rooms on a  line with mine shot forth new bewitching forms, each sparsely clothed in  a slender clinging garment, which concealed no beauteous curve beneath;  and nimbly running and leaping down the slope, they quickly joined the  masculine bathers.    Looking about I soon found a pretty thing in which to array myself, and  quickly started after the others, risking my neck in my desire to  imitate the new mode of motion I had just witnessed. The water was  delightfully cool and refreshing, and the company very agreeable, ladies  and gentlemen all swimming and diving about together with the  unconventional freedom and grace of a company of grebes.    After dressing, we assembled in the eating-room or portico where we had  supped, just when the red disk of the sun was showing itself above the  horizon, kindling the clouds with yellow flame, and filling the green  world with new light. I felt happy and strong that morning, very able  and willing to work in the fields, and, better than all, very hopeful  about that affair of the heart. Happiness, however, is seldom perfect,  and in the clear, tender morning light I could not help contrasting my  own repulsively ugly garments with the bright and beautiful costumes  worn by the others, which seemed to harmonize so well with their fresh,  happy morning mood. I also missed the fragrant cup of coffee, the  streaky rasher from the dear familiar pig, and, after breakfast, the  well-flavored cigar; but these lesser drawbacks were soon forgotten.    After the meal a small closed basket was handed to me, and one of the  young men led me out to a little distance from the house, then, pointing  to a belt of wood about a mile away, told me to walk towards it until I  came to a plowed field on the slope of a valley, where I could do some  plowing. Before leaving me he took from his own person a metal  dog-whistle, with a string attached, and hung it round my neck, but  without explaining its use.    Basket in hand I went away, over the dewy grass, whistling  light-heartedly, and after half an hour's walk found the spot indicated,  where about an acre and a half of land had been recently turned; there  also, lying in the furrow, I found the plow, an implement I knew very  little about. This particular plow, however, appeared to be a simple,  primitive thing, consisting of a long beam of wood, with an upright pole  to guide it; a metal share in the center, going off to one side,  balanced on the other by a couple of small wheels; and there were also  some long ropes attached to a cross-stick at the end of the beam. There  being no horses or bullocks to do the work, and being unable to draw the  plow myself as well as guide it, I sat down leisurely to examine the  contents of my basket, which, I found, consisted of brown bread, dried  fruit, and a stone bottle of milk. Then, not knowing what else to do, I  began to amuse myself by blowing on the whistle, and emitted a most  shrill and piercing sound, which very soon produced an unexpected  effect. Two noble-looking horses, resembling those I had seen the day  before, came galloping towards me as if in response to the sound I had  made.

We now reach the third act, of Setna's struggle to get the magic roll.  Here the strange episode comes in of the rival magicians gambling; it  recalls the old tale of Rampsinitus descending into Hades and playing at  dice with Ceres, and the frequent presence of draught-boards in the  tombs, shows how much the _ka_ was supposed to relish such pleasures.  The regular Egyptian game-board had three rows of ten squares, or thirty  in all. Such are found from the XIIth Dynasty down to Greek times; but  this form has now entirely disappeared, and the _man-galah_ of two rows  of six holes, or the _tab_ of four rows of nine holes, have taken its  place. Both of these are side games, where different sides belong to  opposite players. The commoner _siga_ is a square game, five rows of  five, or seven rows of seven holes, and has no personal sides. The  ancient game was played with two, or perhaps three, different kinds of  men, and the squares were counted from one end along the outer edge; but  what the rules were, or how a game of fifty-two points was managed, has  not yet been explained.    The strange scene of Setna being sunk into the ground portion by  portion, as he loses successive games, is parallel to a mysterious story  among the dervishes in Palestine. They tell how the three holy shekhs of  the Dervish orders, Bedawi, Erfa'i, and Desuki, went in succession to  Baghdad to ask for a jar of water of Paradise from the Derwisha Bint  Bari, who seems to be a sky-genius, controlling the meteors. The last  applicant, Desuki, was refused like the others; so he said, \"Earth!  swallow her,\" and the earth swallowed her to her knees; still she gave  not the water, so he commanded the earth, and she was swallowed to her  waist; a third time she refused, and she was swallowed to her breasts;  she then asked him to marry her, which he would not; a fourth time she  refused the water and was swallowed to her neck. She then ordered a  servant to bring the water (\"Palestine Exploration Statement, 1894,\" p.  32). The resemblance is most remarkable in two tales two thousand years  apart; and the incident of Bint Bari asking the dervish to marry her has  its connection with this tale. Had the dervish done so he  would--according to Eastern beliefs--have lost his magic power over her,  just as Setna loses his magic power by his alliance with Tabubua, to  which he is tempted by Na-nefer-ka-ptah, in order to subdue him. The  talisman here is a means of subduing magic powers, and is of more force  than that of Thoth, as Ptah is greater than he.    The fourth act recounts the overcoming of the power of Setna by  Na-nefer-ka-ptah, who causes Tabubua to lead to the loss of his superior  magic, and thus to subdue him to the magic of his rival. Ankhtaui, here  named as the place of Tabubua, was a quarter of Memphis, which is also  named as the place of the wife of Uba-aner in the first tale.    The fifth act describes the victory of Na-nefer-ka-ptah, and his  requiring Setna to reunite the family in his tomb at Memphis. The  contrast between Ahura's pious ascription to Ptah, and her husband's  chuckle at seeing his magic successful, is remarkable. Setna at once  takes the position of an inferior by addressing praises to  Na-nefer-ka-ptah: after which the tomb became bright as it was before he  took away the magic roll. Setna then having made restitution, is  required to give some compensation as well.    The search for the tomb of Ahura and Mer-ab is a most tantalising  passage. The great cemetery of Koptos is the scene, and the search  occupies three days and nights in the catacombs and on the steles.  Further, the tomb was at the south corner of the town of Pehemato, as  Maspero doubtfully reads it. Yet this cemetery is now quite unknown, and  in spite of all the searching of the native dealers, and the examination  which I have made on the desert of both sides of the Nile, it is a  mystery where the cemetery can be. The statement that the tomb was at  the south corner of a town pretty well excludes it from the desert,  which runs north and south there. And it seems as if it might have been  in some raised land in the plain, like the spur or shoal on which the  town of Koptos was built. If so it would have been covered by the ten to  twenty feet rise of the Nile deposits since the time of its former use.    The appearance of the ancient to guide Setna gives some idea of the time  that elapsed between then and the death of Ahura. The ancient, who must  be allowed to represent two or three generations, says that his  great-grandfather knew of the burial, which would take it back to five  or six generations. This would place the death of Ahura about 150 years  before the latter part of the reign of Ramessu II., say 1225 B.C.: thus,  being taken back to about 1375 B.C., would make her belong to the  generation after Amenhotep III., agreeing well with Mer-neb-ptah, being  a corruption of the name of that king. No argument could be founded on  so slight a basis; but at least there is no contradiction in the slight  indications which we can glean.    The fear of Setna is that this apparition may have come to bring him  into trouble by leading him to attack some property in this town; and  Setna is particularly said to have restored the ground as it was before,  after removing the bodies.    The colophon at the end is unhappily rather illegible. But the  thirty-fifth year precludes its belonging to the reign of any Ptolemy,  except the IInd or the VIIIth; and by the writing Maspero attributes it  to the earlier of these reigns."]]]
