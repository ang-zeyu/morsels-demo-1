Many great men  were glad to call him their friend, and even kings asked his advice  and were amused by his fables.          ONE OF AESOP'S FABLES        An old Cat was in a fair way to kill all the Mice in the barn.    One day the Mice met to talk about the great harm that she was doing  them. Each one told of some plan by which to keep out of her way.    \"Do as I say,\" said an old gray Mouse that was thought to be very wise.  \"Do as I say. Hang a bell to the Cat's neck. Then, when we hear it  ring, we shall know that she is coming, and can scamper out of her  way.\" \"Good! good!\" said all the other Mice; and one ran to get the  bell. \"Now which of you will hang this bell on the Cat's neck?\" said  the old gray Mouse.    \"Not I! not I!\" said all the Mice together. And they scampered away  to their holes.          THE DARK DAY        Listen, and I will tell you of the famous dark day in Connecticut. It  was in the month of May, more than a hundred years ago.    The sun rose bright and fair, and the morning was without a cloud. The  air was very still. There was not a breath of wind to stir the young  leaves on the trees.    Then, about the middle of the day, it began to grow dark. The sun was  hidden. A black cloud seemed to cover the earth.    The birds flew to their nests. The chickens went to roost. The cows  came home from the pasture and stood mooing at the gate. It grew so  dark that the people could not see their way along the streets.    Then everybody began to feel frightened. \"What is the matter? What is  going to happen?\" each one asked of another. The children cried. The  dogs howled. The women wept, and some of the men prayed.    \"The end of the world has come!\" cried some; and they ran about in the  darkness.    \"This is the last great day!\" cried others; and they knelt down and  waited.    In the old statehouse, the wise men of Connecticut were sitting. They  were men who made the laws, and much depended upon their wisdom.    [Illustration]    When the darkness came, they too began to be alarmed. The gloom was  terrible.    \"It is the day of the Lord.\" said one.    \"No use to make laws,\" said another, \"for they will never be needed.\"    \"I move that we adjourn,\" said a third.    Then up from his seat rose Abraham Davenport.    His voice was clear and strong, and all knew that he, at least, was  not afraid.    \"This may be the last great day,\" he said. \"I do not know whether the  end of the world has come or not. But I am sure that it is my duty to  stand at my post as long as I live. So, let us go on with the work  that is before us. Let the candles be lighted.\"    His words put courage into every heart. The candles were brought in.  Then with his strong face aglow in their feeble light, he made a speech  in favor of a law to help poor fishermen.    And as he spoke, the other lawmakers listened in silence till the  darkness began to fade and the sky grew bright again.    The people of Connecticut still remember Abraham Davenport, because  he was a wise judge and a brave lawmaker. The poet Whittier has written  a poem about him, which you will like to hear.          THE SURLY GUEST        One day John Randolph, of Roanoke, [Footnote: Ro'a noke.] set out on  horseback to ride to a town that was many miles from his home. The  road was strange to him, and he traveled very slowly.    When night came on he stopped at a pleasant roadside inn and asked for  lodging. The innkeeper welcomed him kindly. He had often heard of the  great John Randolph, and therefore he did all that he could to  entertain him well.    A fine supper was prepared, and the innkeeper himself waited upon his  guest. John Randolph ate in silence. The innkeeper spoke of the  weather, of the roads, of the crops, of politics. But his surly guest  said scarcely a word.    In the morning a good breakfast was served, and then Mr. Randolph made  ready to start on his journey. He called for his bill and paid it. His  horse was led to the door, and a servant helped him to mount it.    As he was starting away, the friendly innkeeper said, \"Which way will  you travel, Mr. Randolph?\"    Mr. Randolph looked at him in no gentle way, and answered, \"Sir!\"    \"I only asked which way you intend to travel,\" said the man.    \"Oh! I have I paid you my bill?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Do I owe you anything more?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Then, I intend to travel the way I wish to go--do you understand?\"    He turned his horse and rode away. He had not gone farther than to the  end of the innkeeper's field, when to his surprise he found that the  road forked. He did not know whether he should take the right-hand  fork or the left-hand.    He paused for a while. There was no signboard to help him. He looked  back and saw the innkeeper still standing by the door. He called to  him:--\"My friend, which of these roads shall I travel to go to  Lynchburg?\"    \"Mr. Randolph,\" answered the innkeeper, \"you have paid your bill and  don't owe me a cent. Travel the way you wish to go. Good-by!\"    As bad luck would have it, Mr. Randolph took the wrong road. He went  far out of his way and lost much time, all on account of his surliness.    [Illustration]        III      John Randolph, of Roanoke, lived in Virginia one hundred years ago.  He was famous as a lawyer and statesman. He was a member of Congress  for many years, and was noted for his odd manners and strong self-  will.          THE STORY OF A GREAT STORY        Two hundred years ago there lived in Scotland a young man whose name  was Alexander Selkirk. He was quarrelsome and unruly. He was often  making trouble among his neighbors.    For this reason many people were glad when he ran away from home and  went to sea. \"We hope that he will get what he deserves,\" they said.    He was big and strong and soon became a fine sailor. But he was still  headstrong and ill-tempered; and he was often in trouble with the other  sailors.    Once his ship was sailing in the great Pacific Ocean, It was four  hundred miles from the coast of South America. Then something happened  which Selkirk did not like. He became very disagreeable. He quarreled  with the other sailors, and even with the captain.    \"I would rather live alone on a desert island than be a sailor on this  ship,\" he said.    \"Very well,\" answered the captain. \"We shall put you ashore on the  first island that we see.\"    \"Do so,\" said Selkirk. \"You cannot please me better.\"    The very next day they came in sight of a little green island. There  were groves of trees near the shore, and high hills beyond them.    \"What is the name of this island?\" asked Selkirk.    \"Juan Fernandez,\" [Footnote: Juan Fernandez (pro. joo'an fer nan'dsz).]  said the captain.    [Illustration]    \"Set me on shore and leave me there. Give me a few common tools and  some food, and I will do well enough,\" said the sailor.    \"It shall be done,\" answered the captain.    So they filled a small boat with the things that he would need the  most--an ax, a hoe, a kettle, and some other things. They also put  in some bread and meat and other food, enough for several weeks.    Then four of the sailors rowed him to the shore and left him there.    Alexander Selkirk was all alone on the island. He began to see how  foolish he had been; he thought how terrible it would be to live there  without one friend, without one person to whom he could speak.    He called loudly to the sailors and to the captain. \"Oh, do not leave  me here. Take me back, and I will give you no more trouble.\"    But they would not listen to him. The ship sailed away and was soon  lost to sight.    Then Selkirk set to work to make the best of things. He built him a  little hut for shelter at night and in stormy weather. He planted a  small garden. There were pigs and goats on the island, and plenty of  fish could be caught from the shore. So there was always plenty of  food. Sometimes Selkirk saw ships sailing in the distance. He tried  to make signals to them; he called as loudly as he could; but he was  neither seen nor heard, and the ships came no nearer.    \"If I ever have the good fortune to escape from this island,\" he said,  \"I will be kind and obliging to every one. I will try to make friends  instead of enemies.\"    For four years and four months he lived alone on the island. Then, to  his great joy, a ship came near and anchored in the little harbor.    He made himself known, and the captain willingly agreed to carry him  back to his own country. When he reached Scotland everybody was eager  to hear him tell of his adventures, and he soon found himself famous.    In England there was then living a man whose name was Daniel Defoe.  [Footnote: De foe'.] He was a writer of books. He had written many  stories which people at that time liked to read.    When Daniel Defoe heard how Selkirk had lived alone on the island of  Juan Fernandez, he said to himself: \"Here is something worth telling  about. The story of Alexander Selkirk is very pleasing.\"    So he sat down and wrote a wonderful story, which he called \"The  Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.\"    Every boy has heard of Robinson Crusoe. Many boys and indeed many girls  have read his story.    When only a child he liked to stand by the river and see the ships  sailing past. He wondered where they had come from and where they were  going. He talked with some of the sailors. They told him about the  strange lands they had visited far over the sea. They told him about  the wonderful things they had seen there. He was delighted.    \"Oh, I wish I could be a sailor!\" he said.    He could not think of anything else. He thought how grand it would be  to sail and sail on the wide blue sea. He thought how pleasant it would  be to visit strange countries and see strange peoples.    As he grew up, his father wished him to learn a trade.    \"No, no, I am going to be a sailor; I am going to see the world\" he  said. His mother said to him: \"A sailor's life is a hard"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/62"],[0,"A Princess of Mars (#12)"],[1,"me, and  thrust his body against my legs.  His expression was pleading rather  than ferocious, nor did he bare his great tusks or utter his fearful  guttural warnings.  Denied the friendship and companionship of my kind,  I had developed considerable affection for Woola and Sola, for the  normal earthly man must have some outlet for his natural affections,  and so I decided upon an appeal to a like instinct in this great brute,  sure that I would not be disappointed.    I had never petted nor fondled him, but now I sat upon the ground and  putting my arms around his heavy neck I stroked and coaxed him, talking  in my newly acquired Martian tongue as I would have to my hound at  home, as I would have talked to any other friend among the lower  animals.  His response to my manifestation of affection was remarkable  to a degree; he stretched his great mouth to its full width, baring the  entire expanse of his upper rows of tusks and wrinkling his snout until  his great eyes were almost hidden by the folds of flesh.  If you have  ever seen a collie smile you may have some idea of Woola's facial  distortion.    He threw himself upon his back and fairly wallowed at my feet; jumped  up and sprang upon me, rolling me upon the ground by his great weight;  then wriggling and squirming around me like a playful puppy presenting  its back for the petting it craves.  I could not resist the  ludicrousness of the spectacle, and holding my sides I rocked back and  forth in the first laughter which had passed my lips in many days; the  first, in fact, since the morning Powell had left camp when his horse,  long unused, had precipitately and unexpectedly bucked him off  headforemost into a pot of frijoles.    My laughter frightened Woola, his antics ceased and he crawled  pitifully toward me, poking his ugly head far into my lap; and then I  remembered what laughter signified on Mars--torture, suffering, death.  Quieting myself, I rubbed the poor old fellow's head and back, talked  to him for a few minutes, and then in an authoritative tone commanded  him to follow me, and arising started for the hills.    There was no further question of authority between us; Woola was my  devoted slave from that moment hence, and I his only and undisputed  master.  My walk to the hills occupied but a few minutes, and I found  nothing of particular interest to reward me.  Numerous brilliantly  colored and strangely formed wild flowers dotted the ravines and from  the summit of the first hill I saw still other hills stretching off  toward the north, and rising, one range above another, until lost in  mountains of quite respectable dimensions; though I afterward found  that only a few peaks on all Mars exceed four thousand feet in height;  the suggestion of magnitude was merely relative.    My morning's walk had been large with importance to me for it had  resulted in a perfect understanding with Woola, upon whom Tars Tarkas  relied for my safe keeping.  I now knew that while theoretically a  prisoner I was virtually free, and I hastened to regain the city limits  before the defection of Woola could be discovered by his erstwhile  masters.  The adventure decided me never again to leave the limits of  my prescribed stamping grounds until I was ready to venture forth for  good and all, as it would certainly result in a curtailment of my  liberties, as well as the probable death of Woola, were we to be  discovered.    On regaining the plaza I had my third glimpse of the captive girl.  She  was standing with her guards before the entrance to the audience  chamber, and as I approached she gave me one haughty glance and turned  her back full upon me.  The act was so womanly, so earthly womanly,  that though it stung my pride it also warmed my heart with a feeling of  companionship; it was good to know that someone else on Mars beside  myself had human instincts of a civilized order, even though the  manifestation of them was so painful and mortifying.    Had a green Martian woman desired to show dislike or contempt she  would, in all likelihood, have done it with a sword thrust or a  movement of her trigger finger; but as their sentiments are mostly  atrophied it would have required a serious injury to have aroused such  passions in them.  Sola, let me add, was an exception; I never saw her  perform a cruel or uncouth act, or fail in uniform kindliness and good  nature.  She was indeed, as her fellow Martian had said of her, an  atavism; a dear and precious reversion to a former type of loved and  loving ancestor.    Seeing that the prisoner seemed the center of attraction I halted to  view the proceedings.  I had not long to wait for presently Lorquas  Ptomel and his retinue of chieftains approached the building and,  signing the guards to follow with the prisoner entered the audience  chamber.  Realizing that I was a somewhat favored character, and also  convinced that the warriors did not know of my proficiency in their  language, as I had plead with Sola to keep this a secret on the  grounds that I did not wish to be forced to talk with the men until I  had perfectly mastered the Martian tongue, I chanced an attempt to  enter the audience chamber and listen to the proceedings.    The council squatted upon the steps of the rostrum, while below them  stood the prisoner and her two guards.  I saw that one of the women was  Sarkoja, and thus understood how she had been present at the hearing of  the preceding day, the results of which she had reported to the  occupants of our dormitory last night.  Her attitude toward the captive  was most harsh and brutal.  When she held her, she sunk her rudimentary  nails into the poor girl's flesh, or twisted her arm in a most painful  manner.  When it was necessary to move from one spot to another she  either jerked her roughly, or pushed her headlong before her.  She  seemed to be venting upon this poor defenseless creature all the  hatred, cruelty, ferocity, and spite of her nine hundred years, backed  by unguessable ages of fierce and brutal ancestors.    The other woman was less cruel because she was entirely indifferent; if  the prisoner had been left to her alone, and fortunately she was at  night, she would have received no harsh treatment, nor, by the same  token would she have received any attention at all.    As Lorquas Ptomel raised his eyes to address the prisoner they fell on  me and he turned to Tars Tarkas with a word, and gesture of impatience.  Tars Tarkas made some reply which I could not catch, but which caused  Lorquas Ptomel to smile; after which they paid no further attention to  me.    \"What is your name?\" asked Lorquas Ptomel, addressing the prisoner.    \"Dejah Thoris, daughter of Mors Kajak of Helium.\"    \"And the nature of your expedition?\" he continued.    \"It was a purely scientific research party sent out by my father's  father, the Jeddak of Helium, to rechart the air currents, and to take  atmospheric density tests,\" replied the fair prisoner, in a low,  well-modulated voice.    \"We were unprepared for battle,\" she continued, \"as we were on a  peaceful mission, as our banners and the colors of our craft denoted.  The work we were doing was as much in your interests as in ours, for  you know full well that were it not for our labors and the fruits of  our scientific operations there would not be enough air or water on  Mars to support a single human life.  For ages we have maintained the  air and water supply at practically the same point without an  appreciable loss, and we have done this in the face of the brutal and  ignorant interference of you green men.    \"Why, oh, why will you not learn to live in amity with your fellows?  Must you ever go on down the ages to your final extinction but little  above the plane of the dumb brutes that serve you!  A people without  written language, without art, without homes, without love; the victims  of eons of the horrible community idea.  Owning everything in common,  even to your women and children, has resulted in your owning nothing in  common.  You hate each other as you hate all else except yourselves.  Come back to the ways of our common ancestors, come back to the light  of kindliness and fellowship.  The way is open to you, you will find  the hands of the red men stretched out to aid you.  Together we may do  still more to regenerate our dying planet.  The granddaughter of the  greatest and mightiest of the red jeddaks has asked you.  Will you  come?\"    Lorquas Ptomel and the warriors sat looking silently and intently at  the young woman for several moments after she had ceased speaking.  What was passing in their minds no man may know, but that they were  moved I truly believe, and if one man high among them had been strong  enough to rise above custom, that moment would have marked a new and  mighty era for Mars.    I saw Tars Tarkas rise to speak, and on his face was such an expression  as I had never seen upon the countenance of a green Martian warrior.  It bespoke an inward and mighty battle with self, with heredity, with  age-old custom, and as he opened his mouth to speak, a look almost of  benignity, of kindliness, momentarily lighted up his fierce and  terrible countenance.    What words of moment were to have fallen from his lips were never  spoken, as just then a young warrior, evidently sensing the trend of  thought among the older men, leaped down from the steps of the rostrum,  and striking the frail captive a powerful blow across the face, which  felled her to the floor, placed his foot upon her prostrate form and  turning toward the assembled council broke into peals of horrid,  mirthless laughter.    For an instant I thought Tars Tarkas would strike him dead, nor did the  aspect of Lorquas Ptomel augur any too favorably for the brute, but the  mood passed, their old selves reasserted their ascendency, and they  smiled.  It was portentous however that they did not laugh aloud, for  the brute's act constituted "]]]
