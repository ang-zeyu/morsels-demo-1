The voyage, as it was undertaken with a great deal of ignorance and  desperation, so really it was not carried on with much resolution or  judgment; for we knew no more of the course we were to steer than this,  that it was anywhere about the west, within two or three points N. or  S., and as we had no compass with us but a little brass pocket compass,  which one of our men had more by accident than otherwise, so we could  not be very exact in our course.    However, as it pleased God that the wind continued fair at S.E. and by  E., we found that N.W. by W., which was right afore it, was as good a  course for us as any we could go, and thus we went on.    The voyage was much longer than we expected; our vessel also, which had  no sail that was proportioned to her, made but very little way in the  sea, and sailed heavily. We had, indeed, no great adventures happened  in this voyage, being out of the way of everything that could offer to  divert us; and as for seeing any vessel, we had not the least occasion  to hail anything in all the voyage; for we saw not one vessel, small  or great, the sea we were upon being entirely out of the way of all  commerce; for the people of Madagascar knew no more of the shores of  Africa than we did, only that there was a country of lions, as they call  it, that way.    We had been eight or nine days under sail, with a fair wind, when, to  our great joy, one of our men cried out \"Land!\" We had great reason to  be glad of the discovery, for we had not water enough left for above two  or three days more, though at a short allowance. However, though it was  early in the morning when we discovered it, we made it near night before  we reached it, the wind slackening almost to a calm, and our ship being,  as I said, a very dull sailer.    We were sadly baulked upon our coming to the land, when we found that,  instead of the mainland of Africa, it was only a little island, with no  inhabitants upon it, at least none that we could find; nor any cattle,  except a few goats, of which we killed three only. However, they served  us for fresh meat, and we found very good water; and it was fifteen days  more before we reached the main, which, however, at last we arrived at,  and which was most essential to us, as we came to it just as all our  provisions were spent. Indeed, we may say they were spent first, for we  had but a pint of water a day to each man for the last two days. But, to  our great joy, we saw the land, though at a great distance, the evening  before, and by a pleasant gale in the night were by morning within two  leagues of the shore.    We never scrupled going ashore at the first place we came at, though,  had we had patience, we might have found a very fine river a little  farther north. However, we kept our frigate on float by the help of two  great poles, which we fastened into the ground to moor her, like poles;  and the little weak ropes, which, as I said, we had made of matting,  served us well enough to make the vessel fast.    As soon as we had viewed the country a little, got fresh water, and  furnished ourselves with some victuals, which we found very scarce here,  we went on board again with our stores. All we got for provision was  some fowls that we killed, and a kind of wild buffalo or bull, very  small, but good meat; I say, having got these things on board, we  resolved to sail along the coast, which lay N.N.E., till we found some  creek or river, that we might run up into the country, or some town  or people; for we had reason enough to know the place was inhabited,  because we several times saw fires in the night, and smoke in the day,  every way at a distance from us.    At length we came to a very large bay, and in it several little creeks  or rivers emptying themselves into the sea, and we ran boldly into the  first creek we came at; where, seeing some huts and wild people about  them on the shore, we ran our vessel into a little cove on the north  side of the creek, and held up a long pole, with a white bit of cloth  on it, for a signal of peace to them. We found they understood us  presently, for they came flocking to us, men, women, and children, most  of them, of both sexes, stark naked. At first they stood wondering  and staring at us, as if we had been monsters, and as if they had been  frighted; but we found they inclined to be familiar with us afterwards.  The first thing we did to try them, was, we held up our hands to our  mouths, as if we were to drink, signifying that we wanted water. This  they understood presently, and three of their women and two boys ran  away up the land, and came back in about half a quarter of an hour, with  several pots, made of earth, pretty enough, and baked, I suppose, in  the sun; these they brought us full of water, and set them down near the  sea-shore, and there left them, going back a little, that we might fetch  them, which we did.    Some time after this, they brought us roots and herbs, and some fruits  which I cannot remember, and gave us; but as we had nothing to give  them, we found them not so free as the people in Madagascar were.  However, our cutler went to work, and, as he had saved some iron out  of the wreck of the ship, he made abundance of toys, birds, dogs, pins,  hooks, and rings; and we helped to file them, and make them bright for  him, and when we gave them some of these, they brought us all sorts of  provisions they had, such as goats, hogs, and cows, and we got victuals  enough.    We were now landed upon the continent of Africa, the most desolate,  desert, and inhospitable country in the world, even Greenland and Nova  Zembla itself not excepted, with this difference only, that even the  worst part of it we found inhabited, though, taking the nature and  quality of some of the inhabitants, it might have been much better to us  if there had been none.    And, to add to the exclamation I am making on the nature of the place,  it was here that we took one of the rashest, and wildest, and most  desperate resolutions that ever was taken by man, or any number of men,  in the world; this was, to travel overland through the heart of the  country, from the coast of Mozambique, on the east ocean, to the coast  of Angola or Guinea, on the western or Atlantic Ocean, a continent of  land of at least 1800 miles, in which journey we had excessive heats to  support, unpassable deserts to go over, no carriages, camels, or beasts  of any kind to carry our baggage, innumerable numbers of wild and  ravenous beasts to encounter with, such as lions, leopards, tigers,  lizards, and elephants; we had the equinoctial line to pass under, and,  consequently, were in the very centre of the torrid zone; we had nations  of savages to encounter with, barbarous and brutish to the last degree;  hunger and thirst to struggle with, and, in one word, terrors enough to  have daunted the stoutest hearts that ever were placed in cases of flesh  and blood.    Yet, fearless of all these, we resolved to adventure, and accordingly  made such preparations for our journey as the place we were in would  allow us, and such as our little experience of the country seemed to  dictate to us.    It had been some time already that we had been used to tread barefooted  upon the rocks, the gravel, the grass, and the sand on the shore; but as  we found the worst thing for our feet was the walking or travelling on  the dry burning sands, within the country, so we provided ourselves with  a sort of shoes, made of the skins of wild beasts, with the hair inward,  and being dried in the sun, the outsides were thick and hard, and would  last a great while. In short, as I called them, so I think the term very  proper still, we made us gloves for our feet, and we found them very  convenient and very comfortable.    We conversed with some of the natives of the country, who were friendly  enough. What tongue they spoke I do not yet pretend to know. We  talked as far as we could make them understand us, not only about our  provisions, but also about our undertaking, and asked them what country  lay that way, pointing west with our hands. They told us but little to  our purpose, only we thought, by all their discourse, that there were  people to be found, of one sort or other, everywhere; that there were  many great rivers, many lions and tigers, elephants, and furious wild  cats (which in the end we found to be civet cats), and the like.    When we asked them if any one had ever travelled that way, they told  us yes, some had gone to where the sun sleeps, meaning to the west, but  they could not tell us who they were. When we asked for some to guide  us, they shrunk up their shoulders as Frenchmen do when they are afraid  to undertake a thing. When we asked them about the lions and wild  creatures, they laughed, and let us know that they would do us no hurt,  and directed us to a good way indeed to deal with them, and that was to  make some fire, which would always fright them away; and so indeed we  found it.    Upon these encouragements we resolved upon our journey, and many  considerations put us upon it, which, had the thing itself been  practicable, we were not so much to blame for as it might otherwise be  supposed; I will name some of them, not to make the account too tedious.    First, we were perfectly destitute of means to work about our own  deliverance any other way; we were on shore in a place perfectly remote  from all European navigation; so that we could never think of being  relieved, and fetched off by any of our own countrymen in that part of  the world. Secondly, if we had adventured to have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6440"],[0,"Elsie Dinsmore (#12)"],[1," spare your life! If you had been killed I could  never have had you for my papa.\"    \"Perhaps you might have had a much better one, Elsie,\" he said gravely.    \"Oh! no, papa, I wouldn't want any other,\" she replied earnestly,  pressing his hand to her lips.    \"Ah! here we are,\" exclaimed her father, as at that instant the  carriage turned into a broad avenue, up which they drove quite rapidly,  and the next moment they had stopped, the coachman had thrown open the  carriage door, and Mr. Dinsmore, springing out, lifted his little girl  in his arms and set her down on the steps of the veranda.    \"Ah! Dinsmore, how do you do? Glad to see you, and my little friend  Elsie, too. Why this is really kind,\" cried Mr. Travilla, in his  cheerful, hearty way, as, hurrying out to welcome them, he shook Mr.  Dinsmore cordially by the hand, and kissed Elsie's cheek.    \"Walk in, walk in,\" he continued, leading the way into the house, \"my  mother will be delighted to see you both; Miss Elsie especially, for  she seems to have taken a very great fancy to her.\"    If Mrs. Travilla's greeting was less boisterous, it certainly was not  lacking in cordiality, and she made Elsie feel at home at once; taking  off her bonnet, smoothing her hair, and kissing her affectionately.    The gentlemen soon went out together, and Elsie spent the morning in  Mrs. Travilla's room, chatting with her and assisting her with some  coarse garments she was making for her servants.    Mrs. Travilla was an earnest Christian, and the lady and the little  girl were not long in discovering the tie which existed between them.    Mrs. Travilla, being also a woman of great discernment, and having  known Horace Dinsmore nearly all his life, had conceived a very correct  idea of the trials and difficulties of Elsie's situation, and without  alluding to them at all, gave her some most excellent advice, which the  little girl received very thankfully.    They were still chatting together when Mr. Travilla came in, saying,  \"Come, Elsie, I want to take you out to see my garden, hot-house, etc.  We will just have time before dinner. Will you go along, mother?\"    \"No; I have some little matters to attend to before dinner, and will  leave you to do the honors,\" replied the lady; and taking the little  girl's hand he led her out.    \"Where is papa?\" asked Elsie.    \"Oh! he's in the library, looking over some new books,\" replied Mr.  Travilla. \"He always cared more for books than anything else. But what  do you think of my flowers?\"    \"Oh! they are lovely! What a variety you have! what a splendid  cape-jessamine that is, and there is a variety of cactus I never saw  before! Oh! you have a great many more, and handsomer, I think, than we  have at Roselands,\" exclaimed Elsie, as she passed admiringly from one  to another.    Mr. Travilla was much pleased with the admiration she expressed, for he  was very fond of his flowers, and took great pride in showing them.    But they were soon called in to dinner, where Elsie was seated by her  father.    \"I hope this little girl has not given you any trouble, Mrs. Travilla,\"  said he, looking gravely at her.    \"Oh! no,\" the lady hastened to say, \"I have enjoyed her company very  much indeed, and hope you will bring her to see me again very soon.\"    After dinner, as the day was very warm, they adjourned to the veranda,  which was the coolest place to be found; it being on the shady side of  the house, and also protected by thick trees, underneath which a  beautiful fountain was playing.    But the conversation was upon some subject which did not interest  Elsie, and she presently stole away to the library, and seating herself  in a corner of the sofa, was soon lost to everything around her in the  intense interest with which she was reading a book she had taken from  the table.    \"Ah! that is what you are about, Miss Elsie! a bookworm, just like your  father, I see. I had been wondering what had become of you for the last  two hours,\" exclaimed Mr. Travilla's pleasant voice; and sitting down  beside her, he took the book from her hand, and putting it behind him,  said, \"Put it away now; you will have time enough to finish it, and I  want you to talk to me.\"    \"Oh! please let me have it,\" she pleaded. \"I shall not have much time,  for papa will soon be calling me to go home.\"    \"No, no, he is not to take you away; I have made a bargain with him to  let me keep you,\" said Mr. Travilla, very gravely. \"We both think that  there are children enough at Roselands without you; and so your papa  has given you to me; and you are to be _my_ little girl, and call _me_  papa in future.\"    Elsie gazed earnestly in his face for an instant, saying in a  half-frightened tone, \"You are only joking, Mr. Travilla.\"    \"Not a bit of it,\" said he; \"can't you see that I'm in earnest?\"    His tone and look were both so serious that for an instant Elsie  believed he meant all that he was saying, and springing to her feet  with a little cry of alarm, she hastily withdrew her hand which he had  taken, and rushing out to the veranda, where her father still sat  conversing with Mrs. Travilla, she flung herself into his arms, and  clinging to him, hid her face on his breast, sobbing, \"O papa, _dear_  papa! _don't_ give me away; please don't--I will be so good--I will do  everything you bid me--I--\"    \"Why, Elsie, what does all this mean!\" exclaimed Mr. Dinsmore in great  surprise and perplexity; while Mr. Travilla stood in the doorway  looking half amused, half sorry for what he had done.    \"O papa!\" sobbed the little girl, still clinging to him as though  fearing she should be torn from his arms, \"Mr. Travilla says you have  given me to him. O papa! _don't_ give me away.\"    \"Pooh! nonsense, Elsie! I am ashamed of you! how can you be so very  silly as to believe for one moment anything so perfectly absurd as that  I should think of giving you away? Why, I would as soon think of  parting with my eyes.\"    Elsie raised her head and gazed searchingly into his face; then with a  deep-drawn sigh of relief, dropped it again, saying, \"Oh! I am _so_  glad.\"    \"Really, Miss Elsie,\" said Travilla, coming up and patting her on the  shoulder, \"I can't say that I feel much complimented; and, indeed, I  don't see why you need have been so very much distressed at the  prospect before you; for I must say I have vanity enough to imagine  that I should make the better--or at least the more indulgent--father  of the two. Come, now, wouldn't you be willing to try me for a month,  if your papa will give consent?\"    Elsie shook her head.    \"I will let you have your own way in everything,\" urged Travilla,  coaxingly; \"and I know that is more than he does.\"    \"I don't want my own way, Mr. Travilla; I know it wouldn't always be a  good way,\" replied Elsie, decidedly.    Her father laughed and passed his hand caressingly over her curls.    \"I thought you liked me, little Elsie,\" said Travilla, in a tone of  disappointment.    \"So I do, Mr. Travilla; I like you very much,\" she replied.    \"Well, don't you think I would make a good father?\"    \"I am sure you would be very kind, and that I should love you very  much; but not so much as I love my own papa; because, you know, you are  _not_ my papa, and never can be, even if he _should_ give me to you.\"    Mr. Dinsmore laughed heartily, saying, \"I think you may as well give it  up, Travilla; it seems I'll have to keep her whether or no, for she  clings to me like a leech.\"    \"Well, Elsie, you will at least come to the piano and play a little for  me, will you not?\" asked Travilla, smiling.    But Elsie still clung to her father, seeming loath to leave him, until  he said, in his grave, decided way, \"Go, Elsie; go at once, and do as  you are requested.\"    Then she rose instantly to obey.    Travilla looked somewhat vexed. \"I wish,\" he afterward remarked to his  mother, \"that Dinsmore was not quite so ready to second my requests  with his commands. I want Elsie's compliance to be voluntary; else I  think it worth very little.\"    Elsie played and sang until they were called to tea; after which she  sat quietly by her father's side, listening to the conversation of her  elders until the carriage was announced.    \"Well, my daughter,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, when they were fairly upon  their way to Roselands, \"have you had a pleasant day?\"    \"Oh! _very pleasant_, papa, excepting--\" She paused, looking a little  embarrassed.    \"Well, excepting what?\" he asked, smiling down at her.    \"Excepting when Mr. Travilla frightened me so, papa,\" she replied,  moving closer to his side, blushing and casting down her eyes.    \"And you do love your own papa best, and don't want to exchange him for  another?\" he said, inquiringly, as he passed his arm affectionately  around her waist.    \"Oh! no, dear papa, not for anybody else in all the world,\" she said  earnestly.    He made no reply in words, but, looking highly gratified, bent down and  kissed her cheek.    He did not speak again during their ride, but when the carriage stopped  he lifted her out, and setting her gently down, bade her a kind  good-night, saying it was time for mammy to put her to bed.    She ran lightly up-stairs, and springing into her nurse's arms,  exclaimed, \"O mammy, mammy! what a pleasant, _pleasant_ day I have had!  Papa has been so kind, and so were Mr. Travilla and his mother.\"    \"I'se _berry_ glad, darlin', an' I hope you gwine hab many more such  days,\" replied Chloe, embracing her fondly and then proceeding to take  off her bonnet and prepare her for bed, while Elsie gave her a minute  account of all the occurrences of the day, not omitting the fright Mr.  Travilla had given her, and how happily her fears had been relieved.    \"You look berry happy, my darlin' pet,\" said Chloe, clasping her  nursling again in her arms when her task was finished.    \"Yes, mammy, I am happy, oh! _so_ happy, because I do believe that papa  is beginning to love me a little,"]]]
