On the next day  the plants were placed in a completely darkened room, and at each  observation were illuminated as much as possible from vertically above by a  small wax taper. The annexed figure (Fig. 39) shows the movement of the  hypocotyl during 9 h. under these circumstances. A second seedling was  similarly observed at the same time, and the tracing had the same peculiar  character, due to the hypocotyl often moving and returning in nearly  parallel lines. The movement of a third hypocotyl differed greatly.    Fig. 39. Beta vulgaris: circumnutation of hypocotyl, with filament fixed  obliquely across its summit, traced in darkness on horizontal glass, from  8.25 A.M. to 5.30 P.M. Nov. 4th. Movement of bead magnified 23 times, here  reduced to one-third of original scale.    We endeavoured to trace the movements of the cotyledons, and for this  purpose some seedlings were kept in the dark, but they moved in an abnormal  manner; they continued rising from 8.45 A.M. to 2 P.M., then moved  laterally, and from 3 to 6 P.M. descended; whereas cotyledons which have  been exposed all the day to the light rise in the evening so as to stand  vertically at night; but this statement applies only to young seedlings.  For instance, six seedlings in the greenhouse had their cotyledons  partially open for the first time on the morning of November 15th, and at  8.45 P.M. all were completely closed, so that they might properly be said  to be asleep. Again, on the morning of November 27th, the cotyledons of  four other seedlings, which were surrounded by a collar of brown paper so  that they received light only from above, were open to the extent of 39o;  at 10 P.M. they were completely closed; next morning (November 28th) at  6.45 A.M. whilst it was still dark, two of them  [page 53]  were partially open and all opened in the course of the morning; but at  10.20 P.M. all four (not to mention nine others which had been open in the  morning and six others on another occasion) were again completely closed.  On the morning of the 29th they were open, but at night only one of the  four was closed, and this only partially; the three others had their  cotyledons much more raised than during the day. On the night of the 30th  the cotyledons of the four were only slightly raised.    Ricinus Borboniensis (Euphorbiaceae).--Seeds were purchased under the above  name--probably a variety of the common castor-oil plant. As soon as an  arched hypocotyl had risen clear above the ground, a filament was attached  to the upper leg bearing the cotyledons which were still buried beneath the  surface, and the movement of the bead was traced on a horizontal glass  during a period of 34 h. The lines traced were strongly zigzag, and as the  bead twice returned nearly parallel to its former course in two different  directions, there could be no doubt that the arched hypocotyl  circumnutated. At the close of the 34 h. the upper part began to rise and  straighten itself, dragging the cotyledons out of the ground, so that the  movements of the bead could no longer be traced on the glass.    Quercus (American sp.) (Cupuliferae).--Acorns of an American oak which had  germinated at Kew were planted in a pot in the greenhouse. This  transplantation checked their growth; but after a time one grew to a height  of five inches, measured to the tips of the small partially unfolded leaves  on the summit, and now looked vigorous. It consisted of six very thin  internodes of unequal lengths. Considering these circumstances and the  nature of the plant, we hardly expected that it would circumnutate; but the  annexed figure (Fig. 40) shows that it did so in a conspicuous manner,  changing its course many times and travelling in all directions during the  48 h. of observation. The figure seems to represent 5 or 6 irregular ovals  or ellipses. The actual amount of movement from side to side (excluding one  great bend to the left) was about .2 of an inch; but this was difficult to  estimate, as owing to the rapid growth of the stem, the attached filament  was much further from the mark beneath at the close than at the  commencement of the observations. It deserves notice that the pot was  placed in a north-east room within a deep box, the top of which was not at  first covered up, so that the inside facing  [page 54]  the windows was a little more illuminated than the opposite side; and  during the first morning the stem travelled to a greater distance in this  direction (to the left in the figure) than it did afterwards when the box  was completely protected from light.    Fig. 40. Quercus (American sp.): circumnutation of young stem, traced on  horizontal glass, from 12.50 P.M. Feb. 22nd to 12.50 P.M. 24th. Movement of  bead greatly magnified at first, but slightly towards the close of the  observations--about 10 times on an average.    Quercus robur.--Observations were made only on the movements of the  radicles from germinating acorns, which were allowed to grow downwards in  the manner previously described, over plates of smoked glass, inclined at  angles between 65o and 69o to the horizon. In four cases the tracks left  were almost straight, but the tips had pressed sometimes with more and  sometimes with less force on the glass, as shown by the varying thickness  of the tracks and by little bridges of soot left across them. In the fifth  case the track was slightly serpentine, that is, the tip had moved a little  from side to side. In the sixth case (Fig. 41, A) it was plainly  serpentine, and the tip had pressed almost equably on the glass in its  whole course. In the seventh case (B) the tip had moved both laterally and  had pressed  [page 55]  alternately with unequal force on the glass; so that it had moved a little  in two planes at right angles to one another. In the eighth and last case  (C) it had moved very little laterally, but had alternately left the glass  and come into contact with it again. There can be no doubt that in the last  four cases the radicle of the oak circumnutated whilst growing downwards.    Fig. 41. Quercus robur: tracks left on inclined smoked glass-plates by tips  of radicles in growing downwards. Plates A and C inclined at 65o and plate  B at 68o to the horizon.    Corylus avellana (Corylaceae).--The epicotyl breaks through the ground in  an arched form; but in the specimen which was first examined, the apex had  become decayed, and the epicotyl grew to some distance through the soil, in  a tortuous, almost horizontal direction, like a root. In consequence of  this injury it had emitted near the hypogean cotyledons two secondary  shoots, and it was remarkable that both of these were arched, like the  normal epicotyl in ordinary cases. The soil was removed from around one of  these arched secondary shoots, and a glass filament was affixed to the  basal leg. The whole was kept damp beneath a metal-box with a glass lid,  and was thus illuminated only from above. Owing apparently to the lateral  pressure of the earth being removed, the terminal and bowed-down part of  the shoot began at once to move upwards, so that after 24 h. it formed a  right angle with the lower part. This lower part, to which the filament was  attached, also straightened itself, and moved a little backwards from the  upper part. Consequently a long line was traced on the horizontal glass;  and  [page 56]  this was in parts straight and in parts decidedly zigzag, indicating  circumnutation.    On the following day the other secondary shoot was observed; it was a  little more advanced in age, for the upper part, instead of depending  vertically downwards, stood at an angle of 45o above the horizon. The tip  of the shoot projected obliquely .4 of an inch above the ground, but by the  close of our observations, which lasted 47 h., it had grown, chiefly  towards its base, to a height of .85 of an inch. The filament was fixed  transversely to the basal and almost upright half of the shoot, close  beneath the lowest scale-like appendage. The circumnutating course pursued  is shown in the accompanying figure (Fig. 42). The actual distance  traversed from side to side was about .04 of an inch.    Fig. 42. Corylus avellana: circumnutation of a young shoot emitted from the  epicotyl, the apex of which had been injured, traced on a horizontal glass,  from 9 A.M. Feb. 2nd to 8 A.M. 4th. Movement of bead magnified about 27  times.    Pinus pinaster (Coniferae).--A young hypocotyl, with the tips of the  cotyledons still enclosed within the seed-coats, was at first only .35 of  an inch in height; but the upper part grew so rapidly that at the end of  our observations it was .6 in height,    Fig. 43. Pinus pinaster: circumnutation of hypocotyl, with filament fixed  across its summit, traced on horizontal glass, from 10 A.M. March 21st to 9  A.M. 23rd. Seedling kept in darkness. Movement of bead magnified about 35  times.  [page 57]    and by this time the filament was attached some way down the little stem.  From some unknown cause, the hypocotyl moved far towards the left, but  there could be no doubt (Fig. 43) that it circumnutated. Another hypocotyl  was similarly observed, and it likewise moved in a strongly zigzag line to  the same side. This lateral movement was not caused by the attachment of  the glass filaments, nor by the action of light; for no light was allowed  to enter when each observation was made, except from vertically above.    The hypocotyl of a seedling was secured to a little stick; it bore nine in  appearance distinct cotyledons, arranged in a circle. The movements of two  nearly opposite ones were observed. The tip of one was painted white, with  a mark placed below, and the figure described (Fig. 44, A) shows that it  made an irregular    Fig. 44.

Where the tempests sweep,  And the waters leap,    And the storms rage overhead.    Were you lying there on your couch alone    Ere Egypt and Rome were born?  Ere the Age of Stone,  Or the world had known    The Man with the Crown of Thorn.    The winds screech down from the open west,    And the thunders beat and break  On the amethyst  Of your rugged breast,--    But you never arise or wake.    You have locked your past, and you keep the key    In your heart 'neath the westing sun,  Where the mighty sea  And its shores will be    Storm-swept till the world is done.        THE QUILL WORKER      Plains, plains, and the prairie land which the sunlight floods and fills,  To the north the open country, southward the Cyprus Hills;  Never a bit of woodland, never a rill that flows,  Only a stretch of cactus beds, and the wild, sweet prairie rose;  Never a habitation, save where in the far south-west  A solitary tepee lifts its solitary crest,  Where Neykia in the doorway, crouched in the red sunshine,  Broiders her buckskin mantle with the quills of the porcupine.    Neykia, the Sioux chief's daughter, she with the foot that flies,  She with the hair of midnight and the wondrous midnight eyes,  She with the deft brown fingers, she with the soft, slow smile,  She with the voice of velvet and the thoughts that dream the while,--  \"Whence come the vague to-morrows? Where do the yesters fly?  What is beyond the border of the prairie and the sky?  Does the maid in the Land of Morning sit in the red sunshine,  Broidering her buckskin mantle with the quills of the porcupine?\"    So Neykia, in the westland, wonders and works away,  Far from the fret and folly of the \"Land of Waking Day.\"  And many the pale-faced trader who stops at the tepee door  For a smile from the sweet, shy worker, and a sigh when the hour is o'er.  For they know of a young red hunter who oftentimes has stayed  To rest and smoke with her father, tho' his eyes were on the maid;  And the moons will not be many ere she in the red sunshine  Will broider his buckskin mantle with the quills of the porcupine.        GUARD OF THE EASTERN GATE      Halifax sits on her hills by the sea    In the might of her pride,--  Invincible, terrible, beautiful, she    With a sword at her side.    To right and to left of her, battlements rear    And fortresses frown;  While she sits on her throne without favour or fear    With her cannon as crown.    Coast guard and sentinel, watch of the weal    Of a nation she keeps;  But her hand is encased in a gauntlet of steel,    And her thunder but sleeps.        AT CROW'S NEST PASS      At Crow's Nest Pass the mountains rend  Themselves apart, the rivers wend    A lawless course about their feet,    And breaking into torrents beat  In useless fury where they blend      At Crow's Nest Pass.    The nesting eagle, wise, discreet,  Wings up the gorge's lone retreat  And makes some barren crag her friend      At Crow's Nest Pass.    Uncertain clouds, half-high, suspend  Their shifting vapours, and contend    With rocks that suffer not defeat;    And snows, and suns, and mad winds meet  To battle where the cliffs defend      At Crow's Nest Pass.        \"GIVE US BARABBAS\" [4]      There was a man--a Jew of kingly blood,    But of the people--poor and lowly born,  Accused of blasphemy of God, He stood    Before the Roman Pilate, while in scorn  The multitude demanded it was fit    That one should suffer for the people, while  Another be released, absolved, acquit,    To live his life out virtuous or vile.    \"Whom will ye have--Barabbas or this Jew?\"    Pilate made answer to the mob, \"The choice  Is yours; I wash my hands of this, and you,    Do as you will.\" With one vast ribald voice  The populace arose and, shrieking, cried,    \"Give us Barabbas, we condone his deeds!\"  And He of Nazareth was crucified--    Misjudged, condemned, dishonoured for their needs.    And down these nineteen centuries anew    Comes the hoarse-throated, brutalized refrain,  \"Give us Barabbas, crucify the Jew!\"    Once more a man must bear a nation's stain,--  And that in France, the chivalrous, whose lore    Made her the flower of knightly age gone by.  Now she lies hideous with a leprous sore    No skill can cure--no pardon purify.    And an indignant world, transfixed with hate    Of such disease, cries, as in Herod's time,  Pointing its finger at her festering state,    \"Room for the leper, and her leprous crime!\"  And France, writhing from years of torment, cries    Out in her anguish, \"Let this Jew endure,  Damned and disgraced, vicarious sacrifice.    The honour of my army is secure.\"    And, vampire-like, that army sucks the blood    From out a martyr's veins, and strips his crown  Of honour from him, and his herohood    Flings in the dust, and cuts his manhood down.  Hide from your God, O! ye that did this act!    With lesser crimes the halls of Hell are paved.  Your army's honour may be still intact,    Unstained, unsoiled, unspotted,--but unsaved.

Place mine therein, for, all the same,    I'll have my little laughs at them.    For girls may come, and girls may go,    I think I have the best of them;  And yet this photograph I know    You'll toss among the rest of them.    I cannot even hope that you    Will put me in your locket, dear;  Nor costly frame will I look through,    Nor bide in your breast pocket, dear.    For none your heart monopolize,    You favour such a nest of them.  So I but hope your roving eyes    Seek mine among the rest of them.    For saucy sprite, and noble dame,    And many a dainty maid of them  Will greet me in your mirror frame,    And share your kisses laid on them.    And yet, sometimes I fancy, dear,    You hold me as the best of them.  So I'm content if I appear    To-night with all the rest of them.        THE CITY AND THE SEA      I    To none the city bends a servile knee;    Purse-proud and scornful, on her heights she stands,  And at her feet the great white moaning sea    Shoulders incessantly the grey-gold sands,--  One the Almighty's child since time began,    And one the might of Mammon, born of clods;  For all the city is the work of man,    But all the sea is God's.    II    And she--between the ocean and the town--    Lies cursed of one and by the other blest:  Her staring eyes, her long drenched hair, her gown,    Sea-laved and soiled and dank above her breast.  She, image of her God since life began,    She, but the child of Mammon, born of clods,  Her broken body spoiled and spurned of man,    But her sweet soul is God's.        FIRE-FLOWERS      And only where the forest fires have sped,    Scorching relentlessly the cool north lands,  A sweet wild flower lifts its purple head,  And, like some gentle spirit sorrow-fed,    It hides the scars with almost human hands.    And only to the heart that knows of grief,    Of desolating fire, of human pain,  There comes some purifying sweet belief,  Some fellow-feeling beautiful, if brief.    And life revives, and blossoms once again.        A TOAST      There's wine in the cup, Vancouver,    And there's warmth in my heart for you,  While I drink to your health, your youth, and your wealth,    And the things that you yet will do.  In a vintage rare and olden,    With a flavour fine and keen,  Fill the glass to the edge, while I stand up to pledge    My faith to my western queen.    Then here's a Ho! Vancouver, in wine of the bonniest hue,    With a hand on my hip and the cup at my lip,  And a love in my life for you.    For you are a jolly good fellow, with a great, big heart, I know;  So I drink this toast  To the \"Queen of the Coast.\"    Vancouver, here's a Ho!

Little Lady Icicle is waking in the north-land,  And shaking in the north-land her pillow to and fro;    And the hurricane a-skirling    Sends the feathers all a-whirling  Where little Lady Icicle is waking in the snow.    Little Lady Icicle is laughing in the north-land,  And quaffing in the north-land her wines that overflow;    All the lakes and rivers crusting    That her finger-tips are dusting,  Where little Lady Icicle is laughing in the snow.    Little Lady Icicle is singing in the north-land,  And bringing from the north-land a music wild and low;    And the fairies watch and listen    Where her silver slippers glisten,  As little Lady Icicle goes singing through the snow.    Little Lady Icicle is coming from the north-land,  Benumbing all the north-land where'er her feet may go;"]]]
