By 6 A.M. our early breakfast  was despatched, and the donkeys and pagazis were defiling from Camp  Gonera. Even at this early hour, and in this country place, there was  quite a collection of curious natives, to whom we gave the parting  \"Kwaheri\" with sincerity. My bay horse was found to be invaluable for  the service of a quarter-master of a transport-train; for to such was I  compelled to compare myself. I could stay behind until the last donkey  had quitted the camp, and, by a few minutes' gallop, I could put myself  at the head, leaving Shaw to bring up the rear.    The road was a mere footpath, and led over a soil which, though  sandy, was of surprising fertility, producing grain and vegetables  a hundredfold, the sowing and planting of which was done in the most  unskilful manner. In their fields, at heedless labor, were men and women  in the scantiest costumes, compared to which Adam and Eve, in their  fig-tree apparel, must have been _en grande tenue_. We passed them with  serious faces, while they laughed and giggled, and pointed their index  fingers at this and that, which to them seemed so strange and bizarre.    In about half an hour we had left the tall matama and fields of  water-melons, cucumbers, and manioc; and, crossing a reedy slough,  were in an open forest of ebony and calabash. In its depths are deer in  plentiful numbers, and at night it is visited by the hippopotami of the  Kingani for the sake of its grass. In another hour we had emerged from  the woods, and were looking down upon the broad valley of the Kingani,  and a scene presented itself so utterly different from what my foolish  imagination had drawn, that I felt quite relieved by the pleasing  disappointment. Here was a valley stretching four miles east and west,  and about eight miles north and south, left with the richest soil to its  own wild growth of grass--which in civilization would have been a most  valuable meadow for the rearing of cattle--invested as it was by dense  forests, darkening the horizon at all points of the compass, and folded  in by tree-clad ridges.    At the sound of our caravan the red antelope bounded away to our right  and the left, and frogs hushed their croak. The sun shone hot, and  while traversing the valley we experienced a little of its real African  fervour. About half way across we came to a sluice of stagnant water  which, directly in the road of the caravan, had settled down into an  oozy pond. The pagazis crossed a hastily-constructed bridge, thrown up  a long time ago by some Washensi Samaritans. It was an extraordinary  affair; rugged tree limbs resting on very unsteady forked piles, and it  had evidently tested the patience of many a loaded Mnyamwezi, as it  did those porters of our caravan. Our weaker animals were unloaded, the  puddle between Bagamoyo and Genera having taught us prudence. But  this did not occasion much delay; the men worked smartly under Shaw's  supervision.    The turbid Kingani, famous for its hippopotami, was reached in a short  time, and we began to thread the jungle along its right bank until we  were halted point-blank by a narrow sluice having an immeasurable depth  of black mud. The difficulty presented by this was very grave, though  its breadth was barely eight feet; the donkeys, and least of all the  horses, could not be made to traverse two poles like our biped carriers,  neither could they be driven into the sluice, where they would quickly  founder. The only available way of crossing it in safety was by means  of a bridge, to endure in this conservative land for generations as the  handiwork of the Wasungu. So we set to work, there being no help for it,  with American axes--the first of their kind the strokes of which ever  rang in this part of the world--to build a bridge. Be sure it was made  quickly, for where the civilized white is found, a difficulty must  vanish. The bridge was composed of six stout trees thrown across, over  these were laid crosswise fifteen pack saddles, covered again with a  thick layer of grass. All the animals crossed it safely, and then for a  third time that morning the process of wading was performed. The Kingani  flowed northerly here, and our course lay down its right bank. A half  mile in that direction through a jungle of giant reeds and extravagant  climbers brought us to the ferry, where the animals had to be again  unloaded--verily, I wished when I saw its deep muddy waters that I  possessed the power of Moses with his magic rod, or what would have  answered my purpose as well, Aladdin's ring, for then I could have found  myself and party on the opposite side without further trouble; but not  having either of these gifts I issued orders for an immediate crossing,  for it was ill wishing sublime things before this most mundane prospect.    Kingwere, the canoe paddler, espying us from his brake covert, on the  opposite side, civilly responded to our halloos, and brought his huge  hollowed tree skilfully over the whirling eddies of the river to where  we stood waiting for him. While one party loaded the canoe with our  goods, others got ready a long rape to fasten around the animals' necks,  wherewith to haul them through the river to the other bank. After seeing  the work properly commenced, I sat down on a condemned canoe to amuse  myself with the hippopotami by peppering their thick skulls with my No.  12 smooth-bore. The Winchester rifle (calibre 44), a present from the  Hon. Edward Joy Morris--our minister at Constantinople--did no more than  slightly tap them, causing about as much injury as a boy's sling; it was  perfect in its accuracy of fire, for ten times in succession I struck  the tops of their heads between the ears. One old fellow, with the look  of a sage, was tapped close to the right ear by one of these bullets.  Instead of submerging himself as others had done he coolly turned round  his head as if to ask, \"Why this waste of valuable cartridges on  us?\" The response to the mute inquiry of his sageship was an  ounce-and-a-quarter bullet from the smooth-bore, which made him bellow  with pain, and in a few moments he rose up again, tumbling in his death  agonies. As his groans were so piteous, I refrained from a useless  sacrifice of life, and left the amphibious horde in peace.    A little knowledge concerning these uncouth inmates of the African  waters was gained even during the few minutes we were delayed at the  ferry. When undisturbed by foreign sounds, they congregate in shallow  water on the sand bars, with the fore half of their bodies exposed  to the warm sunshine, and are in appearance, when thus somnolently  reposing, very like a herd of enormous swine. When startled by the noise  of an intruder, they plunge hastily into the depths, lashing the waters  into a yellowish foam, and scatter themselves below the surface, when  presently the heads of a few reappear, snorting the water from their  nostrils, to take a fresh breath and a cautious scrutiny around them;  when thus, we see but their ears, forehead, eyes and nostrils, and as  they hastily submerge again it requires a steady wrist and a quick hand  to shoot them. I have heard several comparisons made of their appearance  while floating in this manner: some Arabs told me before I had seen them  that they looked like dead trees carried down the river; others, who in  some country had seen hogs, thought they resembled them, but to my mind  they look more like horses when swimming their curved necks and  pointed ears, their wide eyes and expanded nostrils, favor greatly this  comparison.    At night they seek the shore, and wander several miles over the country,  luxuriating among its rank grasses. To within four miles of the town  of Bagamoyo (the Kingani is eight miles distant) their wide tracks are  seen. Frequently, if not disturbed by the startling human voice, they  make a raid on the rich corn-stalks of the native cultivators, and a  dozen of them will in a few minutes make a frightful havoc in a large  field of this plant. Consequently, we were not surprised, while delayed  at the ferry, to hear the owners of the corn venting loud halloos, like  the rosy-cheeked farmer boys in England when scaring the crows away from  the young wheat.    The caravan in the meanwhile had crossed safely--bales, baggage,  donkeys, and men. I had thought to have camped on the bank, so as to  amuse myself with shooting antelope, and also for the sake of procuring  their meat, in order to save my goats, of which I had a number  constituting my live stock of provisions; but, thanks to the awe and  dread which my men entertained of the hippopotami, I was hurried on to  the outpost of the Baluch garrison at Bagamoyo, a small village called  Kikoka, distant four miles from the river.    The western side of the river was a considerable improvement upon the  eastern. The plain, slowly heaving upwards, as smoothly as the beach of  a watering-place, for the distance of a mile, until it culminated in  a gentle and rounded ridge, presented none of those difficulties which  troubled us on the other side. There were none of those cataclysms  of mire and sloughs of black mud and over-tall grasses, none of that  miasmatic jungle with its noxious emissions; it was just such a scene  as one may find before an English mansion--a noble expanse of lawn  and sward, with boscage sufficient to agreeably diversify it. After  traversing the open plain, the road led through a grove of young ebony  trees, where guinea-fowls and a hartebeest were seen; it then wound,  with all the characteristic eccentric curves of a goat-path, up and  down a succession of land-waves crested by the dark green foliage of  the mango, and the scantier and lighter-coloured leaves of the enormous  calabash. The depressions were filled with jungle of more or less  density, while here and there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/517"],[0,"The Emerald City of Oz (#12)"],[1,"when it suddenly exploded the  result was terrible.    The paper dolls were mowed down by dozens, and flew and fluttered in  wild confusion in every direction, tumbling this way and that and  getting more or less wrinkled and bent.    A wail of terror and grief came from the scattered throng, and Miss  Cuttenclip exclaimed:    \"Dear me! dear me!\" and hurried at once to the rescue of her overturned  people.    \"Oh, Shaggy Man!  How could you?\" asked Dorothy, reproachfully.    \"I couldn't help it--really I couldn't,\" protested the Shaggy Man,  looking quite ashamed.  \"And I had no idea it took so little to upset  these paper dolls.\"    \"So little!\" said Dorothy.  \"Why, it was 'most as bad as a Kansas  cyclone.\"  And then she helped Miss Cuttenclip rescue the paper folk  and stand them on their feet again.  Two of the cardboard houses had  also tumbled over, and the little Queen said she would have to repair  them and paste them together before they could be lived in again.    And now, fearing they might do more damage to the flimsy paper people,  they decided to go away.  But first they thanked Miss Cuttenclip very  warmly for her courtesy and kindness to them.    \"Any friend of Princess Ozma is always welcome here--unless he  sneezes,\" said the Queen with a rather severe look at the Shaggy Man,  who hung his head.  \"I like to have visitors admire my wonderful  village, and I hope you will call again.\"    Miss Cuttenclip herself led them to the door in the wall, and as they  passed along the street the paper dolls peeped at them half fearfully  from the doors and windows.  Perhaps they will never forget the Shaggy  Man's awful sneeze, and I am sure they were all glad to see the meat  people go away.        11.  How the General Met the First and Foremost    On leaving the Growleywogs General Guph had to recross the Ripple  Lands, and he did not find it a pleasant thing to do.  Perhaps having  his whiskers pulled out one by one and being used as a pin-cushion for  the innocent amusement of a good natured jailer had not improved the  quality of Guph's temper, for the old Nome raved and raged at the  recollection of the wrongs he had suffered, and vowed to take vengeance  upon the Growleywogs after he had used them for his purposes and Oz had  been conquered.  He went on in this furious way until he was half  across the Ripple Land.  Then he became seasick, and the rest of the  way this naughty Nome was almost as miserable as he deserved to be.    But when he reached the plains again and the ground was firm under his  feet he began to feel better, and instead of going back home he turned  directly west.  A squirrel, perched in a tree, saw him take this road  and called to him warningly: \"Look out!\"  But he paid no attention.  An  eagle paused in its flight through the air to look at him wonderingly  and say: \"Look out!\"  But on he went.    No one can say that Guph was not brave, for he had determined to visit  those dangerous creatures the Phanfasms, who resided upon the very top  of the dread Mountain of Phantastico.  The Phanfasms were Erbs, and so  dreaded by mortals and immortals alike that no one had been near their  mountain home for several thousand years.  Yet General Guph hoped to  induce them to join in his proposed warfare against the good and happy  Oz people.    Guph knew very well that the Phanfasms would be almost as dangerous to  the Nomes as they would to the Ozites, but he thought himself so clever  that he believed he could manage these strange creatures and make them  obey him.  And there was no doubt at all that if he could enlist the  services of the Phanfasms, their tremendous power, united to the  strength of the Growleywogs and the cunning of the Whimsies would doom  the Land of Oz to absolute destruction.    So the old Nome climbed the foothills and trudged along the wild  mountain paths until he came to a big gully that encircled the Mountain  of Phantastico and marked the boundary line of the dominion of the  Phanfasms.  This gully was about a third of the way up the mountain,  and it was filled to the brim with red-hot molten lava in which swam  fire-serpents and poisonous salamanders.  The heat from this mass and  its poisonous smell were both so unbearable that even birds hesitated  to fly over the gully, but circled around it.  All living things kept  away from the mountain.    Now Guph had heard, during his long lifetime, many tales of these  dreaded Phanfasms; so he had heard of this barrier of melted lava, and  also he had been told that there was a narrow bridge that spanned it in  one place.  So he walked along the edge until he found the bridge.  It  was a single arch of gray stone, and lying flat upon the bridge was a  scarlet alligator, seemingly fast asleep.    When Guph stumbled over the rocks in approaching the bridge the  creature opened its eyes, from which tiny flames shot in all  directions, and after looking at the intruder very wickedly the scarlet  alligator closed its eyelids again and lay still.    Guph saw there was no room for him to pass the alligator on the narrow  bridge, so he called out to it:    \"Good morning, friend.  I don't wish to hurry you, but please tell me  if you are coming down, or going up?\"    \"Neither,\" snapped the alligator, clicking its cruel jaws together.    The General hesitated.    \"Are you likely to stay there long?\" he asked.    \"A few hundred years or so,\" said the alligator.    Guph softly rubbed the end of his nose and tried to think what to do.    \"Do you know whether the First and Foremost Phanfasm of Phantastico is  at home or not?\" he presently inquired.    \"I expect he is, seeing he is always at home,\" replied the alligator.    \"Ah; who is that coming down the mountain?\" asked the Nome, gazing  upward.    The alligator turned to look over its shoulder, and at once Guph ran to  the bridge and leaped over the sentinel's back before it could turn  back again.  The scarlet monster made a snap at the Nome's left foot,  but missed it by fully an inch.    \"Ah ha!\" laughed the General, who was now on the mountain path.  \"I  fooled you that time.\"    \"So you did; and perhaps you fooled yourself,\" retorted the alligator.  \"Go up the mountain, if you dare, and find out what the First and  Foremost will do to you!\"    \"I will,\" declared Guph, boldly; and on he went up the path.    At first the scene was wild enough, but gradually it grew more and more  awful in appearance.  All the rocks had the shapes of frightful beings  and even the tree trunks were gnarled and twisted like serpents.    Suddenly there appeared before the Nome a man with the head of an owl.  His body was hairy like that of an ape, and his only clothing was a  scarlet scarf twisted around his waist.  He bore a huge club in his  hand and his round owl eyes blinked fiercely upon the intruder.    \"What are you doing here?\" he demanded, threatening Guph with his club.    \"I've come to see the First and Foremost Phanfasm of Phantastico,\"  replied the General, who did not like the way this creature looked at  him, but still was not afraid.    \"Ah; you shall see him!\" the man said, with a sneering laugh.  \"The  First and Foremost shall decide upon the best way to punish you.\"    \"He will not punish me,\" returned Guph, calmly, \"for I have come here  to do him and his people a rare favor.  Lead on, fellow, and take me  directly to your master.\"    The owl-man raised his club with a threatening gesture.    \"If you try to escape,\" he said, \"beware--\"    But here the General interrupted him.    \"Spare your threats,\" said he, \"and do not be impertinent, or I will  have you severely punished.  Lead on, and keep silent!\"    This Guph was really a clever rascal, and it seems a pity he was so  bad, for in a good cause he might have accomplished much.  He realized  that he had put himself into a dangerous position by coming to this  dreadful mountain, but he also knew that if he showed fear he was lost.  So he adopted a bold manner as his best defense.  The wisdom of this  plan was soon evident, for the Phanfasm with the owl's head turned and  led the way up the mountain.    At the very top was a level plain upon which were heaps of rock that at  first glance seemed solid.  But on looking closer Guph discovered that  these rock heaps were dwellings, for each had an opening.    Not a person was to be seen outside the rock huts.  All was silent.    The owl-man led the way among the groups of dwellings to one standing  in the center.  It seemed no better and no worse than any of the  others.  Outside the entrance to this rock heap the guide gave a low  wail that sounded like \"Lee-ow-ah!\"    Suddenly there bounded from the opening another hairy man.  This one  wore the head of a bear.  In his hand he bore a brass hoop.  He glared  at the stranger in evident surprise.    \"Why have you captured this foolish wanderer and brought him here?\" he  demanded, addressing the owl-man.    \"I did not capture him,\" was the answer.  \"He passed the scarlet  alligator and came here of his own free will and accord.\"    The First and Foremost looked at the General.    \"Have you tired of life, then?\" he asked.    \"No indeed,\" answered Guph.  \"I am a Nome, and the Chief General of  King Roquat the Red's great army of Nomes.  I come of a long-lived  race, and I may say that I expect to live a long time yet.  Sit down,  you Phanfasms--if you can find a seat in this wild haunt--and listen to  what I have to say.\"    With all his knowledge and bravery General Guph did not know that the  steady glare from the bear eyes was reading his inmost thoughts as  surely as if they had been put into words.  He did not know that these  despised rock heaps of the Phanfasms were merely deceptions to his own  eyes, nor could he guess that he was standing in the midst of one of  the most splendid and luxurious cities ever built by magic power.  All  that he saw was a barren waste of rock heaps, a hairy man with an owl's  head"]]]
