Here it is.' I felt satisfied that  Joseph was a Prophet of God in very deed.\"    Prior to his departure with Zion's Camp, Wilford Woodruff became  acquainted with many leading men and private members of the Church,  some of whom were destined to be his co-laborers throughout subsequent  years of his life. Besides the Prophet, the patriarch and their  families, he became acquainted with Brigham Young, Orson Hyde, Milton  Holmes, Sidney Rigdon, and many others whose names occur in the early  history of the Church.    \"I passed one Sabbath in Kirtland,\" he writes, \"and heard many of the  elders speak. I rejoiced before God because of the light and knowledge  which were manifested to me during that {40} day. The first day of May,  1834, was appointed for the Camp of Zion to start from Kirtland. Only a  few of those composing the Camp were ready.    \"The Prophet asked those who were ready, to go as far as New Portage  and there await the arrival of those who would follow later. I left in  company with about twenty men with baggage wagons. At night we pitched  our tents. Climbing to the top of the hill, I looked down upon the Camp  of Israel. There I knelt upon the ground and prayed. I rejoiced and  praised the Lord that I had lived to see some of the tents of Israel  pitched, and a company gathered by the commandment of God to go up and  help to redeem Zion.    \"We remained at New Portage until the 6th when we were joined by the  Prophet and eighty-five more men. The day before their arrival, while  passing through the village of Middlebury, the people tried to count  them, but the Lord multiplied them in the eyes of those people so that  those who counted them said there were four hundred.    \"On the 7th, the Prophet Joseph organized the Camp which consisted  of about one hundred and thirty men. The day following we continued  our journey. We pitched our tents at night and had prayers night and  morning. The Prophet gave us our instructions every day. We were nearly  all young men brought together from all parts of the country, and were  therefore strangers to each other. We soon became acquainted and had  a happy time in each others association. It was a great school for us  to be led by a Prophet of God a thousand miles through cities, towns,  villages, and through the wilderness. When persons stood up to count  us, they could not tell how many we numbered. Some said five hundred,  others, a thousand. Many were astonished as we passed through their  towns. One lady ran to the door, pushed her spectacles to the top of  her head, raised her hands and exclaimed: 'What under heavens has  broken loose.' She stood in that position the last I saw of her.    \"During our travels we visited many mounds thrown up by the ancient  inhabitants, the Nephites and Lamanites. This morning, June 3rd, we  went on to a high mound near the river. From the summit we could  overlook the tops of the trees as far as we could see. The scenery was  truly beautiful. On the summit of {41} the mound were stones which  presented the appearance of three altars, they having been erected, one  above the other, according to the ancient order of things. Human bones  were seen upon the ground. Brother Joseph requested us to dig into the  mound; we did so; and in about one foot we came to the skeleton of  a man, almost entire, with an arrow sticking in his backbone. Elder  Milton Holmes picked it out, and brought it into the Camp, with one  of the leg bones, which had been broken. I brought the thigh bone to  Missouri. I desired to bury it in the Temple Block in Jackson County;  but not having this privilege, I buried it in Clay County, Missouri,  near the house owned by Col. Arthur and occupied by Lyman Wight.\"    The arrowhead referred to is now in the possession of President Joseph  F. Smith, Salt Lake City, Utah.    \"Brother Joseph,\" continues Wilford, \"feeling anxious to learn  something of this man, asked the Lord, and received an open vision.  The man's name was Zelph. He was a white Lamanite, the curse having  been removed because of his righteousness. He was a great warrior, and  fought for the Nephites under the direction of the Prophet Onandagus.  The latter had charge of the Nephite armies from the Eastern sea to  the Rocky Mountains. Although the Book of Mormon does not mention  Onandagus, he was a great warrior, leader, general, and prophet. Zelph  had his thigh bone broken by a stone thrown from a sling, but was  killed by the arrow found sticking in his backbone. There was a great  slaughter at that time. The bodies were heaped upon the earth, and  buried in the mound, which is nearly three hundred feet in height.    \"The Lord delivered Israel in the days of Moses by dividing the Red  Sea, so they went over dry shod. When their enemies tried to do the  same, the water closed upon the latter and they were drowned. The Lord  delivered Zion's Camp from their enemies on the 19th of June, 1834, by  piling up the waters in Fishing River forty feet in one night, so our  enemies could not cross. He also sent a great hailstorm, which broke  them up and sent them seeking for shelter. James Campbell, who had  threatened the life of the Prophet and his brethren, was drowned, with  six others, the same night, after his threat. His body was washed down  the stream, and was eaten by eagles and turkey-buzzards.\"    {42} The people of Richmond, Missouri, declared the Camp should not  pass through that city; but on the morning of the 19th, before the  people were up, the brethren passed through unmolested. \"We intended  to enter Clay County that day, but the Lord knew best what was for our  good,\" says Wilford, \"and so began to hinder our progress. One wheel  broke down, another ran off, and one thing after another hindered us so  that we had to camp between two forks of Fishing River. Five armed men  soon rode up, and told us that large companies of men from Jackson and  Clay Counties, and other parts, would be upon us before morning, and  were sworn to encompass our destruction.    \"Shortly after these five men left us, a small cloud arose, and spread  with great rapidity, until the whole heavens gathered blackness, and  a mighty storm burst forth with fury upon our enemies. If the Camp  had not been hindered, they would have crossed into Clay County, and  would have been at the mercy of the mob. Thus the Lord, in a marvelous  manner, preserved the lives of His servants. Colonel Sconce, who came  into the Camp the next day, with several leading men, said that surely  Jehovah fought the battles of Joseph and his followers.\"    The Prophet addressed the visitors at some length, and recounted the  wrongs heaped upon the Saints in Missouri. His address touched the  hearts of the visitors, bringing tears to their eyes. They promised to  do all they could to allay the prejudice of the people. It appears from  Wilford Woodruff's journal that they kept their word, and rode through  the country endeavoring to allay the excitement.    \"Previous to this event,\" says Wilford, \"Elders Hyrum Smith and Lyman  Wight had joined the Camp with a company of volunteers from Michigan.  The Camp now consisted of two hundred and five men and twenty-five  baggage wagons. Lyman Wight was made commander-in-chief. Joseph  appointed twenty men to be his body-guard; Hyrum Smith was captain, and  George A. Smith armor-bearer.    \"The Camp of Zion arrived at Brother Burk's, in Clay County, Missouri  on the 24th of June, 1834. We pitched our tents on his premises. He  told some of the brethren of my company that he had a spare room which  some of us might occupy if we would clean it. Our company accepted the  offer; and, fearing {43} that some other company would get it first,  we left all other business and went to work, cleaned out the room, and  immediately spread down our blankets, so as to hold a right to the  room. It was but a short time afterwards that our brethren who were  attacked by cholera were brought in and laid upon our beds. None of us  ever used those blankets again, for they were buried with the dead; so  we gained nothing but experience by our selfishness, and we lost our  bedding.    \"When the cholera broke out in Camp, Joseph attempted to rebuke it,  but was shown by the Lord that when He sends a judgment man must not  attempt to stay it. (Joseph returned to me the sword which I had given  him, and it still remains in my family as a relic of that expedition.)  Those who died in Zion's Camp were A. S. Gilbert, John S. Carter, Eber  Wilcox, Seth Hitchcock, Erastus Rudd, Alfred Frisk, Edward Jones, Noah  Johnson, Jesse B. Lawson, Robert McCord, Eliel Strong, Jesse Smith,  Betsey Parrish, and Warren Ingles.    \"The Prophet called the brethren together at Lyman Wight's and told  them the cholera had been sent in fulfillment of his prediction. Nearly  all had suffered from it, and fourteen had died. Joseph said that if we  would now humble ourselves, the cholera would be stayed. We covenanted  with uplifted hands to keep the commandments of God, and the cholera  was stayed from that hour; not another case appeared among the Saints.    \"The journey of Zion's Camp to Missouri was necessarily one of trial  and hardship. Several of the brethren murmured, and found fault. Joseph  prophesied that a scourge would come upon the Camp, and it came in the  form of cholera, thirteen of the brethren being stricken in death.  During the journey, when brethren would have killed the serpents which  at times came into the tents and coiled up near the beds, the Prophet  taught his brethren the beautiful principle that men themselves must  become harmless before they can expect the brute creation to be so.

We believed them deluded  fanatics, or weak and designing knaves, and that they and their  pretensions would soon pass away; but in this we were deceived. * * *  They openly blaspheme the Most High God, and cast contempt on His holy  religion, by pretending to receive revelations direct from heaven,  by pretending to speak unknown tongues by direct inspiration, and by  divers pretenses derogatory to God and religion, and to the utter  subversion of human reason.\" [37]    The foregoing is quoted from the first \"Manifesto,\" or \"Secret  Constitution\" of the mob. Somewhat later, in a second manifesto issued  to the public in justification of their contemplated acts of violence  against the Saints, they say: \"What would be the fate of our lives  and property, in the hands of jurors and witnesses, who do not blush  to declare, and would not upon occasion hesitate to swear, that they  have wrought miracles, and have been the subjects of miraculous and  supernatural cures, have conversed with God and His angels, and possess  and exercise the gifts of divination and of unknown tongues, and fired  with the prospect of obtaining inheritances without money and without  price--may be better imagined than described. * * * Of their pretended  revelations from heaven--their personal intercourse {XLVIII} with God  and His angels--the maladies they pretend to heal by the laying on  of hands--and the contemptible gibberish with which they habitually  profane the Sabbath, and which they dignify with the appellation of  unknown tongues, we have nothing to say: vengeance belongs to God  alone.\" [38]    Yet it was because the Saints entertained these religious beliefs  that the mob of Jackson county issuing this \"manifesto,\" proceeded  to take \"vengeance\" into their own hands, and wreak it upon the  Saints. All their other accusations against them,--namely, idleness,  ignorance, inviting \"free negroes\" into the state, inciting the slaves  to insubordination to their masters, claiming Jackson county as their  inheritance to be obtained by force if not bloodshed, and poverty--all  these charges, except, perhaps the last (for some of the Saints were  very poor, though I have yet to learn that that is a crime), were  absolutely untrue. The Saints, however, did claim the existence of  spiritual power in their religion; that the channel of communication  between God and men by means of revelation, the visitation of angels,  and the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, had been opened anew; that  gifts of the Gospel--tongues, interpretations, visions, inspired  dreams, healings--that all the spiritual powers and graces of the  Gospel, in fact, were manifested in the religion they had accepted. By  this religion, also, they were admonished to righteousness of life;  to the strict observance of the Sabbath; to respect for the name of  Deity; to temperance; to industry; to true speaking and true acting;  to patience--in a word, to godliness; all of which but to live was to  place themselves in marked contrast to those about them, and their  righteous lives were a great rebuke to the general dissolute conduct of  the Missourians. It was this effort at a godly walk and conversation,  and the religion which commanded it, that was offensive in the eyes of  the Missourians, and which led them to form their strong determination  to be rid of a people and a religion which made their own lives a  reproach.    That this was regarded as the chief, if not the sole cause of their  persecution, appears in the subsequent discussion of the Jackson county  difficulties, both _pro et con_. All other questions, all the minor  causes and pretexts were lost sight of in that discussion. Governor  Dunklin, in a communication to Colonel J. Thornton, in answer to a  letter written by that gentleman proposing a compromise between the  Saints and their enemies in Jackson county, recognizes what he calls  \"the eccentricity of the religious opinions of the Mormons\" as being  the cause of their persecution. \"I am fully persuaded,\" he remarks,  \"that the eccentricity of the religious opinions and practices of the  Mormons is at the bottom of the outrages committed against them.\"    {XLIX} In this important communication he no where considers anything  else as the cause of their persecution, but argues at length in favor  of their right to the entertainment of their religious views, eccentric  howsoever they might be, so long as they did not interfere with the  rights of others. \"They have the right constitutionally guaranteed to  them,\" he remarks, \"and it is indefeasible, to worship Joe Smith as a  man, an angel, or even as the only true and living God, and to call  their habitation Zion, the Holy Land, or even heaven itself. Indeed,  there is nothing so absurd or ridiculous that they have not a right to  adopt as their religion, so that in its exercise they do not interfere  with the rights of others.\" [39]    The people of Clay county when they called upon the Saints to peaceably  remove from their borders and seek a locality where they could form a  community that should be largely, if not exclusively, made up of their  own Church membership, indicated very clearly that it was the religion  of the Saints that was the chief cause of complaint against them. In a  document they published setting forth the reasons why they suggested  such removal, they said; \"The religious tenets of this people are so  different from the present churches of the age, that they always have,  and always will, excite deep prejudices against them in any populous  country where they may locate. We, therefore, in a spirit of frank and  friendly kindness, do advise them to seek a home where they may obtain  large and separate bodies of land, and have a community of their own.\"  [40]    Again, after the surrender at Far West, when the Church leaders had  been betrayed into bondage; after the Saints had delivered up their  arms; after they had signed over their properties to defray the  expenses of the \"war;\" and when the whole body of the Church was making  hasty preparations to depart from the state, a number of the brethren  were assembled on the temple square at Far West, and in the course of a  long speech, which he read [41] to them, General John B. Clark said:    \"I am sorry, gentlemen, to see so great a number of apparently  intelligent men found in the situation you are; and oh! that I could  invoke that Great Spirit, the Unknown God, to rest upon you, and make  you sufficiently intelligent to break that chain of superstition,  and liberate you from those fetters of fanaticism with which you are  bound--that you no longer worship a man! I would advise you to scatter  abroad, and never again organize yourselves with Bishops, Presidents,  {L} etc., lest you excite the jealousies of the people, and subject  yourselves to the same calamities that have now come upon you.\"    This to a people whose leaders had been betrayed into the hands of  their enemies; who themselves had been disarmed, though acting only  in defense of their homes and families; who had been compelled at  the muzzle of the musket to sign away their property to defray the  expenses of the militia mobs that had brought their calamities upon  them; who were then under an order of expulsion from the state and  making hurried preparations for their enforced departure--this to men  who had sacrificed or had been robbed of the most sacred rights of  American citizenship! And he who thus addressed the brethren impudently  told them in the very speech from which I quote, that he approved of  all that had been done to them! But the foregoing quotation is not  made in order to point out the mockery of the speech; or the mixture  of hypocrisy and blasphemy in it; or the utter contemptibility of him  who delivered it. I quote the passage merely to point out the fact  that it was hatred of their alleged \"superstition\" and \"fanaticism,\"  in other words the religion of the Saints that was the cause of their  persecution. The crimes against which the Saints are warned for the  future--under penalty of having their present troubles revisited upon  them--is gathering together in large bodies, and organizing themselves  with Bishops, Presidents, etc. In other words it was the religion of  the people and the organization which was both the depository of its  doctrines, and the instrumentality by which they were promulgated--the  Church--which was the object of the Missourians' animosity, the thing  they were determined to destroy.    Later, when the Prophet Joseph and other leading brethren were under  examination before Judge Austin A. King at Richmond, Ray county,  special inquiry was made as to the belief of the witnesses in the  declaration of the Prophet Daniel: \"And in the days of these kings  shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be  destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it  shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall  stand for ever.\" [42]    The judge on being answered that the Saints believed the prophecy,  turned to the clerk and told him to write the answer down as it was \"_a  strong point for treason_!\" [43] I"]]]
