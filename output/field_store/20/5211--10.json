[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6886"],[0,"First Footsteps in East Africa (#12)"],[1," to prayer, our  preacher rises, and in the voice with which Sir Hudibras was wont      \"To blaspheme custard through the nose,\"    preaches El Waaz [30], or the advice-sermon. He sits down for a few  minutes, and then, rising again, recites El Naat, or the Praise of the  Prophet and his Companions. These are the two heads into which the Moslem  discourse is divided; unfortunately, however, there is no application. Our  preacher, who is also Kazi or Judge, makes several blunders in his Arabic,  and he reads his sermons, a thing never done in El Islam, except by the  _modice docti_. The discourse over, our clerk, who is, if possible, worse  than the curate, repeats the form of call termed El Ikamah; then entering  the Mihrab or niche, he recites the two-bow Friday litany, with, and in  front of, the congregation. I remarked no peculiarity in the style of  praying, except that all followed the practice of the Shafeis in El  Yemen,--raising the hands for a moment, instead of letting them depend  along the thighs, between the Rukaat or bow and the Sujdah or prostration.  This public prayer concluded, many people leave the mosque; a few remain  for more prolonged devotions.    There is a queer kind of family likeness between this scene and that of a  village church, in some quiet nook of rural England. Old Sharmarkay, the  squire, attended by his son, takes his place close to the pulpit; and  although the _Honoratiores_ have no padded and cushioned pews, they  comport themselves very much as if they had. Recognitions of the most  distant description are allowed before the service commences: looking  around is strictly forbidden during prayers; but all do not regard the  prohibition, especially when a new moustache enters. Leaving the church,  men shake hands, stand for a moment to exchange friendly gossip, or  address a few words to the preacher, and then walk home to dinner. There  are many salient points of difference. No bonnets appear in public: the  squire, after prayers, gives alms to the poor, and departs escorted by two  dozen matchlock-men, who perseveringly fire their shotted guns.      FOOTNOTES    [1] This style of profile--highly oval, with the chin and brow receding--  is very conspicuous in Eastern Africa, where the face, slightly  prognathous, projects below the nose.    [2] Gall-nuts form the base of the tattooing dye. It is worked in with a  needle, when it becomes permanent: applied with a pen, it requires to be  renewed about once a fortnight.    [3] Mats are the staple manufacture in Eastern, as in many parts of  Western, Africa. The material is sometimes Daum or other palm: there are,  however, many plants in more common use; they are made of every variety in  shape and colour, and are dyed red, black, and yellow,--madder from  Tajurrah and alum being the matter principally used.    [4] When woman addresses woman she always uses her voice.    [5] The Tobe, or Abyssinian \"Quarry,\" is the general garment of Africa  from Zayla to Bornou. In the Somali country it is a cotton sheet eight  cubits long, and two breadths sewn together. An article of various uses,  like the Highland plaid, it is worn in many ways; sometimes the right arm  is bared; in cold weather the whole person is muffled up, and in summer it  is allowed to full below the waist. Generally it is passed behind the  back, rests upon the left shoulder, is carried forward over the breast,  surrounds the body, and ends hanging on the left shoulder, where it  displays a gaudy silk fringe of red and yellow. This is the man's Tobe.  The woman's dress is of similar material, but differently worn: the edges  are knotted generally over the right, sometimes over the left shoulder; it  is girdled round the waist, below which hangs a lappet, which in cold  weather can be brought like a hood over the head. Though highly becoming,  and picturesque as the Roman toga, the Somali Tobe is by no means the most  decorous of dresses: women in the towns often prefer the Arab costume,--a  short-sleeved robe extending to the knee, and a Futah or loin-cloth  underneath.    As regards the word Tobe, it signifies, in Arabic, a garment generally:  the Somal call it \"Maro,\" and the half Tobe a \"Shukkah.\"    [6] Abu Kasim of Gaza, a well known commentator upon Abu Shujaa of  Isfahan, who wrote a text-book of the Shafei school.    [7] The Hajj had seven sons, three of whom died in infancy. Ali and  Mahmud, the latter a fine young man, fell victims to small pox: Mohammed  is now the eldest, and the youngest is a child called Ahmed, left for  education at Mocha. The Hajj has also two daughters, married to Bedouin  Somal.    [8] It is related that a Hazrami, flying from his fellow-countrymen,  reached a town upon the confines of China. He was about to take refuge in  a mosque, but entering, he stumbled over the threshold. \"Ya Amud el Din\"--  \"0 Pillar of the Faith!\" exclaimed a voice from the darkness, calling upon  the patron saint of Hazramaut to save a Moslem from falling. \"May the  Pillar of the Faith break thy head,\" exclaimed the unpatriotic traveller,  at once rising to resume his vain peregrinations.    [9] Mercenaries from Mocha, Hazramaut, and Bir Hamid near Aden: they are  armed with matchlock, sword, and dagger; and each receives from the  governor a monthly stipend of two dollars and a half.    [10] The system of caste, which prevails in El Yemen, though not in the  northern parts of Arabia, is general throughout the Somali country. The  principal families of outcasts are the following.    The Yebir correspond with the Dushan of Southern Arabia: the males are  usually jesters to the chiefs, and both sexes take certain parts at  festivals, marriages, and circumcisions. The number is said to be small,  amounting to about 100 families in the northern Somali country.    The Tomal or Handad, the blacksmiths, originally of Aydur race, have  become vile by intermarriage with serviles. They must now wed maidens of  their own class, and live apart from the community: their magical  practices are feared by the people,--the connection of wits and witchcraft  is obvious,--and all private quarrels are traced to them. It has been  observed that the blacksmith has ever been looked upon with awe by  barbarians on the same principle that made Vulcan a deity. In Abyssinia  all artisans are Budah, sorcerers, especially the blacksmith, and he is a  social outcast as among the Somal; even in El Hejaz, a land, unlike Yemen,  opposed to distinctions amongst Moslems, the Khalawiyah, who work in  metal, are considered vile. Throughout the rest of El Islam the blacksmith  is respected as treading in the path of David, the father of the craft.    The word \"Tomal,\" opposed to Somal, is indigenous. \"Handad \"is palpably a  corruption of the Arabic \"Haddad,\" ironworker.    The Midgan, \"one-hand,\" corresponds with the Khadim of Yemen: he is called  Kami or \"archer\" by the Arabs. There are three distinct tribes of this  people, who are numerous in the Somali country: the best genealogists  cannot trace their origin, though some are silly enough to derive them,  like the Akhdam, from Shimr. All, however, agree in expelling the Midgan  from the gentle blood of Somali land, and his position has been compared  to that of Freedman amongst the Romans. These people take service under  the different chiefs, who sometimes entertain great numbers to aid in  forays and frays; they do not, however, confine themselves to one craft.  Many Midgans employ themselves in hunting and agriculture. Instead of  spear and shield, they carry bows and a quiver full of diminutive arrows,  barbed and poisoned with the Waba,--a weapon used from Faizoghli to the  Cape of Good Hope. Like the Veddah of Ceylon, the Midgan is a poor shot,  and scarcely strong enough to draw his stiff bow. He is accused of  maliciousness; and the twanging of his string will put to flight a whole  village. The poison is greatly feared: it causes, say the people, the hair  and nails to drop off, and kills a man in half an hour. The only treatment  known is instant excision of the part; and this is done the more  frequently, because here, as in other parts of Africa, such _stigmates_  are deemed ornamental.    In appearance the Midgan is dark and somewhat stunted; he is known to the  people by peculiarities of countenance and accent.    [11] The reason why Europeans fail to explain their thoughts to Orientals  generally is that they transfer the Laconism of Western to Eastern  tongues. We for instance say, \"Fetch the book I gave you last night.\" This  in Hindostani, to choose a well-known tongue, must be smothered with words  thus: \"What book was by me given to you yesterday by night, that book  bringing to me, come!\"    [12] I have alluded to these subjects in a previous work upon the subject  of Meccah and El Medinah.    [13] This is one of the stock complaints against the Moslem scheme. Yet is  it not practically the case with ourselves? In European society, the best  are generally those who prefer the companionship of their own sex; the  \"ladies' man\" and the woman who avoids women are rarely choice specimens.    [14] The Shantarah board is thus made, with twenty-five points technically  called houses. [Illustration] The players have twelve counters a piece,  and each places two at a time upon any of the unoccupied angles, till all  except the centre are filled up. The player who did not begin the game  must now move a man; his object is to inclose one of his adversary's  between two of his own, in which case he removes it, and is entitled to  continue moving till he can no longer take. It is a game of some skill,  and perpetual practice enables the Somal to play it as the Persians do  backgammon, with great art and little reflection. The game is called  Kurkabod when, as in our draughts, the piece passing over one of the  adversary's takes it.    Shahh is another favourite game.

CHAPTER XVIII.    \"So we lived in the city. In the city the wretched feel less sad. One  can live there a hundred years without being noticed, and be dead a long  time before anybody will notice it. People have no time to inquire into  your life. All are absorbed. Business, social relations, art, the health  of children, their education. And there are visits that must be received  and made; it is necessary to see this one, it is necessary to hear that  one or the other one. In the city there are always one, two, or three  celebrities that it is indispensable that one should visit.    \"Now one must care for himself, or care for such or such a little one,  now it is the professor, the private tutor, the governesses, . . . and  life is absolutely empty. In this activity we were less conscious of the  sufferings of our cohabitation. Moreover, in the first of it, we had a  superb occupation,--the arrangement of the new dwelling, and then, too,  the moving from the city to the country, and from the country to the  city.    \"Thus we spent a winter. The following winter an incident happened to us  which passed unnoticed, but which was the fundamental cause of all that  happened later. My wife was suffering, and the rascals (the doctors)  would not permit her to conceive a child, and taught her how to avoid  it. I was profoundly disgusted. I struggled vainly against it, but  she insisted frivolously and obstinately, and I surrendered. The last  justification of our life as wretches was thereby suppressed, and life  became baser than ever.    \"The peasant and the workingman need children, and hence their conjugal  relations have a justification. But we, when we have a few children,  have no need of any more. They make a superfluous confusion of expenses  and joint heirs, and are an embarrassment. Consequently we have no  excuses for our existence as wretches, but we are so deeply degraded  that we do not see the necessity of a justification. The majority of  people in contemporary society give themselves up to this debauchery  without the slightest remorse. We have no conscience left, except, so to  speak, the conscience of public opinion and of the criminal code. But in  this matter neither of these consciences is struck. There is not a being  in society who blushes at it. Each one practices it,--X, Y, Z, etc. What  is the use of multiplying beggars, and depriving ourselves of the joys  of social life? There is no necessity of having conscience before the  criminal code, or of fearing it: low girls, soldiers' wives who throw  their children into ponds or wells, these certainly must be put  in prison. But with us the suppression is effected opportunely and  properly.    \"Thus we passed two years more. The method prescribed by the rascals had  evidently succeeded. My wife had grown stouter and handsomer. It was the  beauty of the end of summer. She felt it, and paid much attention to her  person. She had acquired that provoking beauty that stirs men. She was  in all the brilliancy of the wife of thirty years, who conceives no  children, eats heartily, and is excited. The very sight of her was  enough to frighten one. She was like a spirited carriage-horse that has  long been idle, and suddenly finds itself without a bridle. As for my  wife, she had no bridle, as for that matter, ninety-nine hundredths of  our women have none.\"        CHAPTER XIX.    Posdnicheff's face had become transformed; his eyes were pitiable; their  expression seemed strange, like that of another being than himself; his  moustache and beard turned up toward the top of his face; his nose was  diminished, and his mouth enlarged, immense, frightful.    \"Yes,\" he resumed \"she had grown stouter since ceasing to conceive,  and her anxieties about her children began to disappear. Not even  to disappear. One would have said that she was waking from a long  intoxication, that on coming to herself she had perceived the entire  universe with its joys, a whole world in which she had not learned to  live, and which she did not understand.    \"'If only this world shall not vanish! When time is past, when old age  comes, one cannot recover it.' Thus, I believe, she thought, or rather  felt. Moreover, she could neither think nor feel otherwise. She had been  brought up in this idea that there is in the world but one thing worthy  of attention,--love. In marrying, she had known something of this love,  but very far from everything that she had understood as promised her,  everything that she expected. How many disillusions! How much suffering!  And an unexpected torture,--the children! This torture had told upon  her, and then, thanks to the obliging doctor, she had learned that it  is possible to avoid having children. That had made her glad. She had  tried, and she was now revived for the only thing that she knew,--for  love. But love with a husband polluted by jealousy and ill-nature was no  longer her ideal. She began to think of some other tenderness; at least,  that is what I thought. She looked about her as if expecting some event  or some being. I noticed it, and I could not help being anxious.    \"Always, now, it happened that, in talking with me through a third party  (that is, in talking with others, but with the intention that I should  hear), she boldly expressed,--not thinking that an hour before she had  said the opposite,--half joking, half seriously, this idea that maternal  anxieties are a delusion; that it is not worth while to sacrifice one's  life to children. When one is young, it is necessary to enjoy life. So  she occupied herself less with the children, not with the same intensity  as formerly, and paid more and more attention to herself, to her  face,--although she concealed it,--to her pleasures, and even to her  perfection from the worldly point of view. She began to devote herself  passionately to the piano, which had formerly stood forgotten in the  corner. There, at the piano, began the adventure.    \"The MAN appeared.\"    Posdnicheff seemed embarrassed, and twice again there escaped him that  nasal sound of which I spoke above. I thought that it gave him pain to  refer to the MAN, and to remember him. He made an effort, as if to  break down the obstacle that embarrassed him, and continued with  determination.    \"He was a bad man in my eyes, and not because he has played such an  important role in my life, but because he was really such. For the  rest, from the fact that he was bad, we must conclude that he was  irresponsible. He was a musician, a violinist. Not a professional  musician, but half man of the world, half artist. His father, a country  proprietor, was a neighbor of my father's. The father had become ruined,  and the children, three boys, were all sent away. Our man, the youngest,  was sent to his godmother at Paris. There they placed him in the  Conservatory, for he showed a taste for music. He came out a violinist,  and played in concerts.\"    On the point of speaking evil of the other, Posdnicheff checked himself,  stopped, and said suddenly:    \"In truth, I know not how he lived. I only know that that year he came  to Russia, and came to see me. Moist eyes of almond shape, smiling red  lips, a little moustache well waxed, hair brushed in the latest fashion,  a vulgarly pretty face,--what the women call 'not bad,'--feebly built  physically, but with no deformity; with hips as broad as a woman's;  correct, and insinuating himself into the familiarity of people as far  as possible, but having that keen sense that quickly detects a false  step and retires in reason,--a man, in short, observant of the external  rules of dignity, with that special Parisianism that is revealed in  buttoned boots, a gaudy cravat, and that something which foreigners pick  up in Paris, and which, in its peculiarity and novelty, always has  an influence on our women. In his manners an external and artificial  gayety, a way, you know, of referring to everything by hints, by  unfinished fragments, as if everything that one says you knew already,  recalled it, and could supply the omissions. Well, he, with his music,  was the cause of all.    \"At the trial the affair was so represented that everything seemed  attributable to jealousy. It is false,--that is, not quite false, but  there was something else. The verdict was rendered that I was a deceived  husband, that I had killed in defence of my sullied honor (that is the  way they put it in their language), and thus I was acquitted. I tried to  explain the affair from my own point of view, but they concluded that I  simply wanted to rehabilitate the memory of my wife. Her relations with  the musician, whatever they may have been, are now of no importance  to me or to her. The important part is what I have told you. The whole  tragedy was due to the fact that this man came into our house at a time  when an immense abyss had already been dug between us, that frightful  tension of mutual hatred, in which the slightest motive sufficed to  precipitate the crisis. Our quarrels in the last days were something  terrible, and the more astonishing because they were followed by a  brutal passion extremely strained. If it had not been he, some other  would have come. If the pretext had not been jealousy, I should have  discovered another. I insist upon this point,--that all husbands  who live the married life that I lived must either resort to outside  debauchery, or separate from their wives, or kill themselves, or kill  their wives as I did. If there is any one in my case to whom this does  not happen, he is a very rare exception, for, before ending as I ended,  I was several times on the point of suicide, and my wife made several  attempts to poison herself.\"        CHAPTER XX.    \"In order that you may understand me, I must tell you how this happened.  We were living along, and all seemed well. Suddenly we began to talk  of the children's education. I do not remember what words either of "]]]
