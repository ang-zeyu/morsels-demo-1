It was at a great fete celebrated at the  Palais Royal. There was a play acted, with scenery and music, and then  a ball. It took three whole days to arrange my ornaments for this  night. The Queen of England would dress me on this occasion, also,  with her own hands. My robe was all figured with diamonds, with  carnation trimmings. I wore the jewels of the crown of France, and,  to add to them, the Queen of England lent me some fine ones of her  own, which she had not then sold. The queen praised the fine turn of  my shape, my air, the beauty of my complexion, and the brightness of  my light hair. I had a conspicuous seat in the middle of the ballroom,  with the young King of France and the Prince of Wales at my feet I did  not feel the least embarrassed, for, as I had an idea of marrying the  emperor, I regarded the Prince of Wales only as an object of pity.\"    Things went on in this way for a time, until at last some political  difficulties occurred at Paris which broke in upon the ordinary routine  of the royal family, and drove them, for a time, out of the city.  Before these troubles were over, Henrietta and her son were struck  down, as by a blow, by the tidings, which came upon them like a  thunderbolt, that their husband and father had been beheaded. This  dreadful event put a stop for a time to every thing like festive  pleasures. The queen left her children, her palace, and all the gay  circle of her friends, and retired to a convent, to mourn, in solitude  and undisturbed, her irreparable loss.          CHAPTER VI.    NEGOTIATIONS WITH ANNE MARIA.        Our Prince Charles now becomes, by the death of his father, King Charles  the Second, both of England and of Scotland. That is, he becomes so  in theory, according to the principles of the English Constitution,  though, in fact, he is a fugitive and an exile still. Notwithstanding  his exclusion, however, from the exercise of what he considered his  right to reign, he was acknowledged as king by all true Royalists in  England, and by all the continental powers. They would not aid him to  recover his throne, but in the courts and royal palaces which he visited  he was regarded as a king, and was treated, in form at least, with all  the consideration and honor which belonged to royalty. Queen Henrietta  was overwhelmed with grief and despair when she learned the dreadful  tidings of the execution of her husband. At the time when these tidings  came to her, she was involved, also, in many other sufferings and  trials. As was intimated in the last chapter, serious difficulties had  occurred between the royal family of France and the government and  people of the city of Paris, from which a sort of insurrection had  resulted, and the young king and his mother, together with all the  principal personages of the court, had been compelled to fly from the  city, in the night, to save their lives. They went in a train of twenty  or thirty carriages, by torch light, having kept their plan a profound  secret until the moment of their departure. The young king was asleep  in his bed until the time arrived, when they took him up and put him  into the carriage. Anne Maria, whose rank and wealth gave her a great  deal of influence and power, took sides, in some degree, with the  Parisians in this contest, so that her aunt, the queen regent,  considered her as an enemy rather than a friend. She, however, took  her with them in their flight; but Anne Maria, being very much out of  humor, did all she could to tease and torment the party all the way.  When they awoke her and informed her of their proposed escape from  Paris, she was, as she says in her memoirs, very much delighted, for  she knew that the movement was very unwise, and would get her aunt,  the queen regent, and all their friends, into serious difficulties.    She dressed herself as quick as she could, came down stairs, and  proceeded to enter the queen regent's coach, saying that she wanted  to have one or the other of certain seats--naming the best places--as  she had no idea, she said, of being exposed to cold, or riding  uncomfortably on such a night. The queen told her that those seats  were for herself and another lady of high rank who was with her, to  which Anne Maria replied, \"Oh, very well; I suppose young ladies ought  to give up to _old_ people.\"    In the course of conversation, as they were preparing to ride away,  the queen asked Anne Maria if she was not surprised at being called  up to go on such an expedition. \"Oh no,\" said she; \"my father\" (that  is, Gaston, the duke of Orleans) \"told me all about it beforehand.\"  This was not true, as she says herself in her own account of these  transactions. She knew nothing about the plan until she was called  from her bed. She said this, therefore, only to tease her aunt by the  false pretension that the secret had been confided to her. Her aunt,  however, did not believe her, and said, \"Then why did you go to bed,  if you knew what was going on?\" \"Oh,\" replied Anne Maria, \"I thought  it would be a good plan to get some sleep, as I did not know whether  I should even have a bed to lie upon to-morrow night.\"    The party of fugitives exhibited a scene of great terror and confusion,  as they were assembling and crowding into their carriages, before they  left the court of the Palais Royal. It was past midnight, in the month  of January, and there was no moon. Called up suddenly as they were  from their beds, and frightened with imaginary dangers, they all pressed  forward, eager to go; and so hurried was their departure, that they  took with them very scanty supplies, even for their most ordinary  wants. At length they drove away. They passed rapidly out of the city.  They proceeded to an ancient palace and castle called St. Germain's,  about ten miles northeast of Paris. Anne Maria amused herself with the  fears, and difficulties, and privations which the others suffered, and  she gives an account of the first night they spent in the place of  their retreat, which, as it illustrates her temperament and character,  the reader will like perhaps, to see.    \"I slept in a very handsome room, well painted, well gilded, and large,  with very little fire, and no windows, [Footnote: That is, with no  glass to the windows.] which is not very agreeable in the month of  January. I slept on mattresses, which were laid upon the floor, and  my sister, who had no bed, slept with me. I was obliged to sing to get  her to sleep, and then her slumber did not last long, so that she  disturbed mine. She tossed about, felt me near her, woke up, and  exclaimed that she saw the beast, so I was obliged to sing again to  put her to sleep, and in that way I passed the night. Judge whether  this was an agreeable situation for one who had had little or no sleep  the night before, and who had been ill all winter with colds. However,  the fatigue and exposure of this expedition cured me.    \"In a short time my father gave me his room, but as nobody knew I was  there, I was awoke in the night by a noise. I drew back my curtain,  and was astonished to find my chamber filled with men in large buff  skin collars, and who appeared surprised to see me, and knew me as  little as I did them. I had no change of linen, and when I wanted any  thing washed, it was done in the night, while I was in bed. I had no  women to arrange my hair and dress me, which is very inconvenient.  Still I did not lose my gayety, and they were in admiration at my  making no complaint; and it is true that I am a creature that can make  the most of every thing, and am greatly above trifles.\"    To feel any commiseration for this young lady, on account of the alarm  which she may be supposed to have experienced at seeing all those  strange men in her chamber, would be sympathy thrown away, for her  nerves were not of a sensibility to be affected much by such a  circumstance as that. In fact, as the difficulties between the young  king's government and the Parisians increased, Anne Maria played quite  the part of a heroine. She went back and forth to Paris in her carriage,  through the mob, when nobody else dared to go. She sometimes headed  troops, and escorted ladies and gentlemen when they were afraid to go  alone. Once she relieved a town, and once she took the command of the  cannon of the Bastille, and issued her orders to fire with it upon the  troops, with a composure which would have done honor to any veteran  officer of artillery. We can not go into all these things here in  detail, as they would lead us too far away from the subject of this  narrative. We only allude to them, to give our readers some distinct  idea of the temperament and character of the rich and blooming beauty  whom young King Charles was wishing so ardently to make his bride.    During the time that these difficulties continued in Paris, Queen  Henrietta's situation was extremely unhappy. She was shut up in the  palace of the Louvre, which became now her prison rather than her home.  She was separated from the royal family; her son, the king, was  generally absent in Holland or in Jersey, and her palace was often  surrounded by mobs; whenever she ventured out in her carriage, she was  threatened with violence and outrage by the populace in such a manner  as to make her retreat as soon as possible to the protection of the  palace walls. Her pecuniary means, too, were exhausted. She sold her  jewels, from time to time, as long as they lasted, and then contracted  debts which her creditors were continually pressing her to pay. Her  friends at St."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6675"],[0,"The Loss of the S. S. Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#12)"],[1,"blown up and the ship  broken in two; but I think such accounts will not stand close  analysis. In the first place the fires had been withdrawn and the  steam allowed to escape some time before she sank, and the possibility  of explosion from this cause seems very remote. Then, as just related,  the noise was not sudden and definite, but prolonged--more like the  roll and crash of thunder. The probability of the noise being caused  by engines falling down will be seen by referring to Figure 2, page  116, where the engines are placed in compartments 3, 4, and 5. As the  Titanic tilted up they would almost certainly fall loose from their  bed and plunge down through the other compartments.    No phenomenon like that pictured in some American and English papers  occurred--that of the ship breaking in two, and the two ends being  raised above the surface. I saw these drawings in preparation on board  the Carpathia, and said at the time that they bore no resemblance to  what actually happened.    When the noise was over the Titanic was still upright like a column:  we could see her now only as the stern and some 150 feet of her stood  outlined against the star-specked sky, looming black in the darkness,  and in this position she continued for some minutes--I think as much  as five minutes, but it may have been less. Then, first sinking back a  little at the stern, I thought, she slid slowly forwards through the  water and dived slantingly down; the sea closed over her and we had  seen the last of the beautiful ship on which we had embarked four days  before at Southampton.    And in place of the ship on which all our interest had been  concentrated for so long and towards which we looked most of the time  because it was still the only object on the sea which was a fixed  point to us--in place of the Titanic, we had the level sea now  stretching in an unbroken expanse to the horizon: heaving gently just  as before, with no indication on the surface that the waves had just  closed over the most wonderful vessel ever built by man's hand; the  stars looked down just the same and the air was just as bitterly cold.    There seemed a great sense of loneliness when we were left on the sea  in a small boat without the Titanic: not that we were uncomfortable  (except for the cold) nor in danger: we did not think we were either,  but the Titanic was no longer there.    We waited head on for the wave which we thought might come--the wave  we had heard so much of from the crew and which they said had been  known to travel for miles--and it never came. But although the Titanic  left us no such legacy of a wave as she went to the bottom, she left  us something we would willingly forget forever, something which it is  well not to let the imagination dwell on--the cries of many hundreds  of our fellow-passengers struggling in the ice-cold water.    I would willingly omit any further mention of this part of the  disaster from this book, but for two reasons it is not possible--first,  that as a matter of history it should be put on record;  and secondly, that these cries were not only an appeal for  help in the awful conditions of danger in which the drowning  found themselves,--an appeal that could never be answered,--but  an appeal to the whole world to make such conditions of  danger and hopelessness impossible ever again; a cry that called  to the heavens for the very injustice of its own existence; a cry  that clamoured for its own destruction.    We were utterly surprised to hear this cry go up as the waves closed  over the Titanic: we had heard no sound of any kind from her since we  left her side; and, as mentioned before, we did not know how many  boats she had or how many rafts. The crew may have known, but they  probably did not, and if they did, they never told the passengers; we  should not have been surprised to know all were safe on some  life-saving device.    So that unprepared as we were for such a thing, the cries of the  drowning floating across the quiet sea filled us with stupefaction: we  longed to return and rescue at least some of the drowning, but we knew  it was impossible. The boat was filled to standing-room, and to return  would mean the swamping of us all, and so the captain-stoker told his  crew to row away from the cries. We tried to sing to keep all from  thinking of them; but there was no heart for singing in the boat at  that time.    The cries, which were loud and numerous at first, died away gradually  one by one, but the night was clear, frosty and still, the water  smooth, and the sounds must have carried on its level surface free  from any obstruction for miles, certainly much farther from the ship  than we were situated. I think the last of them must have been heard  nearly forty minutes after the Titanic sank. Lifebelts would keep the  survivors afloat for hours; but the cold water was what stopped the  cries.    There must have come to all those safe in the lifeboats, scattered  round the drowning at various distances, a deep resolve that, if  anything could be done by them in the future to prevent the repetition  of such sounds, they would do it--at whatever cost of time or other  things. And not only to them are those cries an imperative call, but  to every man and woman who has known of them. It is not possible that  ever again can such conditions exist; but it is a duty imperative on  one and all to see that they do not. Think of it! a few more boats, a  few more planks of wood nailed together in a particular way at a  trifling cost, and all those men and women whom the world can so ill  afford to lose would be with us to-day, there would be no mourning in  thousands of homes which now are desolate, and these words need not  have been written.          CHAPTER V    THE RESCUE      All accounts agree that the Titanic sunk about 2:20 A.M.: a watch in  our boat gave the time as 2:30 A.M. shortly afterwards. We were then  in touch with three other boats: one was 15, on our starboard quarter,  and the others I have always supposed were 9 and 11, but I do not know  definitely. We never got into close touch with each other, but called  occasionally across the darkness and saw them looming near and then  drawing away again; we called to ask if any officer were aboard the  other three, but did not find one. So in the absence of any plan of  action, we rowed slowly forward--or what we thought was forward, for  it was in the direction the Titanic's bows were pointing before she  sank. I see now that we must have been pointing northwest, for we  presently saw the Northern Lights on the starboard, and again, when  the Carpathia came up from the south, we saw her from behind us on the  southeast, and turned our boat around to get to her. I imagine the  boats must have spread themselves over the ocean fanwise as they  escaped from the Titanic: those on the starboard and port sides  forward being almost dead ahead of her and the stern boats being  broadside from her; this explains why the port boats were so much  longer in reaching the Carpathia--as late as 8.30 A.M.--while some of  the starboard boats came up as early as 4.10 A.M. Some of the port  boats had to row across the place where the Titanic sank to get to the  Carpathia, through the debris of chairs and wreckage of all kinds.    None of the other three boats near us had a light--and we missed  lights badly: we could not see each other in the darkness; we could  not signal to ships which might be rushing up full speed from any  quarter to the Titanic's rescue; and now we had been through so much  it would seem hard to have to encounter the additional danger of being  in the line of a rescuing ship. We felt again for the lantern beneath  our feet, along the sides, and I managed this time to get down to the  locker below the tiller platform and open it in front by removing a  board, to find nothing but the zinc airtank which renders the boat  unsinkable when upset. I do not think there was a light in the boat.  We felt also for food and water, and found none, and came to the  conclusion that none had been put in; but here we were mistaken. I  have a letter from Second Officer Lightoller in which he assures me  that he and Fourth Officer Pitman examined every lifeboat from the  Titanic as they lay on the Carpathia's deck afterwards and found  biscuits and water in each. Not that we wanted any food or water then:  we thought of the time that might elapse before the Olympic picked us  up in the afternoon.    Towards 3 A.M. we saw a faint glow in the sky ahead on the starboard  quarter, the first gleams, we thought, of the coming dawn. We were not  certain of the time and were eager perhaps to accept too readily any  relief from darkness--only too glad to be able to look each other in  the face and see who were our companions in good fortune; to be free  from the hazard of lying in a steamer's track, invisible in the  darkness. But we were doomed to disappointment: the soft light  increased for a time, and died away a little; glowed again, and then  remained stationary for some minutes! \"The Northern Lights\"! It  suddenly came to me, and so it was: presently the light arched fanwise  across the northern sky, with faint streamers reaching towards the  Pole-star. I had seen them of about the same intensity in England some  years ago and knew them again. A sigh of disappointment went through  the boat as we realized that the day was not yet; but had we known it,  something more comforting even than the day was in store for us. All  night long we had watched the horizon with eager eyes for signs of a  steamer's lights; we heard from the captain-stoker that the first  appearance would be a single light on the horizon, the masthead light,  followed shortly by a second one, lower down, on the deck; if these  two remained in vertical alignment and the distance between them  increased as the lights drew nearer, we might be certain it was a  steamer."]]]
