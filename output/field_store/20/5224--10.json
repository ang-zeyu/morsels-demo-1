We have been married for fifteen years, and she  has no children to keep her at home. She is accustomed to my being away  for weeks. This would be for months, perhaps for two years. I made no  secret to her that we might meet with many dangers. She says they will  be no greater for her than for me. At first she tried to dissuade me  from going for so long a time; but when I told her that you were sent  me by the gentleman who saved my life a year after I married her, and  that he had recommended you to me as standing to him almost in the  relation of a son, and I therefore felt bound to carry his wishes into  effect, and so to pay the debt of gratitude that I owed him, she agreed  at once that it was my duty to go and do all in my power for you, and  she prayed me to take her with me. I said that I would put it before  you, senor, and that I must abide by your decision.\"    \"By all means bring her with you, Dias. If you and she are both willing  to share the dangers we should meet with, surely we cannot object in  any way.\"    \"Thank you, senor; you will find her useful. You have already seen that  she can cook well; and if we have Jose to look after the animals when  we are searching among the hills, you will find it not unpleasant, when  we return of an evening, to find a hot supper ready for us.\"    \"That is quite true, and I am sure we shall find your wife a great  acquisition to our party. The only difference will be, that instead of  one large tent we must have two small ones--it does not matter how  small, so long as we can crawl into them and they are long enough for  us to lie down. And now about payment?\"    \"I shall not overcharge you,\" Dias said with a smile. \"If my wife had  remained behind I must have asked for money to maintain her while we  were away. It would not have been much, for she has her garden and her  house, and there is a bag hid away with my savings, so that if she had  been widowed she could still live in the house until she chose someone  else to share it with her; she is but thirty-two, and is as comely as  when I first married her. However, as she is going with us, there will  be no need to trouble about her. If misfortune comes upon us and I am  killed, it is likely she will be killed also. We shall have no expenses  on the journey, as you will pay for food for ourselves and the animals.  You will remember, senor, that I make this journey not as a business  matter--no money would buy from me any information that I may have as  to hidden mines or treasures,--I do it to repay a debt of gratitude to  my preserver, Don Henry Barnett, and partly because I am sure that I  shall like you and your brother as I did him. I shall aid you as far as  lies in my power in the object for which you are undertaking this  journey. Therefore until it is finished there shall be no talk about  payment. You may have many expenses beyond what you calculate upon. If  we meet with no success, and return to Lima empty-handed, I shall have  lost nothing. I shall have had no expenses at home, my wife and I will  have fed at your expense, and Jose will have learned so much that he  would be as good a guide as any in the country. You could then give me  the three mules you will buy, to take the place of any of mine that may  have perished on the journey, and should you have them to spare, I will  take a hundred dollars as a _bueno mano_. If we succeed, and you  discover a rich mine or a hidden treasure, you shall then pay me what  it pleases you. Is it a bargain?\"    \"The bargain you propose is ridiculously one-sided, Dias, and I don't  see how I could possibly accept the offer you make to me.\"    \"Those are my terms, senor,\" Dias said simply, \"to take or to leave.\"    \"Then I cannot but accept them, and I thank you most heartily;\" and he  held out his hand to Dias, and the Indian grasped it warmly.    \"When do you propose we shall start?\"    \"Will this day week suit you, senor? There are the mules to buy, and  the tents to be made--they should be of vicuna skin with the wool still  on, which, with the leather kept well oiled, will keep out water. We  shall want them in the hills, but we shall sometimes find villages  where we can sleep in shelter.\"    \"Not for us, Dias. Mr. Barnett has told me that the houses are for the  most part alive with fleas, and I should prefer to sleep in a tent,  however small, rather than lie in a bed on the floor of any one of  them. We don't want thick beds, you know--a couple of thicknesses of  well-quilted cotton, say an inch thick each, and two feet wide. You can  get these made for us, no doubt.\"    The Indian nodded.    \"That would be the best for travel; the beds the Peruvian caballeros  use are very thick and bulky.\"    \"You will want two for yourself and your wife, and two for Jose. By the  by, we shall want a tent for him.\"    Dias smiled. \"It will not be necessary, senor; muleteers are accustomed  to sleep in the open air, and with two thick blankets, and a leathern  coverlet in case of rain, he will be more than comfortable. I shall  have five leather bags made to hold the beds and blankets. But the  making of the beds and tents will take some time--people do not hurry  in Lima,--and there will be the riding saddles and bridles to get, and  the provisions. I do not think we can be ready before another week. It  will be well, then, that you should, before starting away, visit the  ruins of Pachacamac. All travellers go there, and it will seem only  natural that you should do so, for there you will see the style of the  buildings, and also the explorations that were everywhere made by the  Spaniards in search of treasure.\"    \"Very well, Dias; then this day week we shall be ready to start.  However, I suppose I shall see you every day, and learn how you are  getting on with your preparations.\"    Bertie had been sitting at the window looking down into the street  while this conversation was going on. \"Well, what is it all about?\" he  asked, turning round as the Indian left the room. \"Is it satisfactory?\"    \"More than satisfactory,\" his brother answered. \"In the first place his  nephew, a lad of fifteen, who is training as a mule-driver, is going  with us, which is much better than getting an outsider; in the next  place his wife is going with us.\"    \"Good gracious!\" Bertie exclaimed, \"what in the world shall we do with  a woman?\"    \"Well, I think we shall do very well with her, Bertie; but well or ill  she has to go. She will not let her husband go without her, which is  natural enough, considering how long we shall be away, and that the  journey will be a dangerous one. But really I think she will be an  acquisition to the party. She is bright and pretty, as you no doubt  noticed, and what is of more importance, she is a capital cook.\"    \"She certainly gave us a good meal yesterday,\" Bertie said, \"and though  I could rough it on anything, it is decidedly pleasanter to have a  well-cooked meal.\"    \"Well, you see, that is all right.\"    \"And how many mules are we to take?\"    \"Five for baggage, and three for riding. I have no doubt Dias's wife  will ride behind him, and the boy, when he wants to ride, will perch  himself on one of the baggage mules. Dias has five mules, and we shall  only have to buy the three for riding.\"    \"What is it all going to cost, Harry?\" Bertie said when his brother had  told him all the arrangements that had been made. \"That is the most  important point after all.\"    \"Well, you will be astonished when I tell you, Bertie, that if we don't  succeed in finding a treasure of any kind I shall only have to pay for  the three riding mules, and the expenses of food and so on, and a  hundred dollars.\"    \"Twenty pounds!\" Bertie said incredulously; \"you are joking!\"    \"No, it is really so; the man said that he considered that in going  with me he is only fulfilling the obligation he is under to Mr.  Barnett. Of course I protested against the terms, and would have  insisted upon paying the ordinary prices, whatever they might be, for  his services and the use of his mules; but he simply said that those  were the conditions on which he was willing to go with me, and that I  could take them or leave them, so I had to accept. I can only hope that  we may find some treasure, in which case only he consented to accept  proper payment for his services.\"    \"Well, it is awfully good of him,\" Bertie said; \"though really it  doesn't seem fair that we should be having the services of himself, his  wife, his boy, and his mules for nothing. There is one thing, it will  be an extra inducement to him to try and put us in the way of finding  one of those mines.\"    \"I don't think so, Bertie; he said that not for any sum of money  whatever would he do what he is going to do, but simply from gratitude  to Barnett. It is curious how the traditions, or superstitions, or  whatever you like to call them, of the time of the Incas have continued  to impress the Indians, and how they have preserved the secrets  confided to their ancestors.

The testimony of the man who first reported having seen one  of them was that, as he was walking slowly round the house, while yet  in the shadow, he caught sight of a creature standing on its hind legs  in the moonlight, with its forefeet upon a window-ledge, staring in at  the window.  Its body might have been that of a dog or wolf, he  thought, but he declared on his honour that its head was twice the size  it ought to have been for the size of its body, and as round as a ball,  while the face, which it turned upon him as it fled, was more like one  carved by a boy upon the turnip inside which he is going to put a  candle than anything else he could think of.  It rushed into the  garden. He sent an arrow after it, and thought he must have struck it;  for it gave an unearthly howl, and he could not find his arrow any more  than the beast, although he searched all about the place where it  vanished.  They laughed at him until he was driven to hold his tongue,  and said he must have taken too long a pull at the ale-jug.    But before two nights were over he had one to side with him, for he,  too, had seen something strange, only quite different from that  reported by the other.  The description the second man gave of the  creature he had seen was yet more grotesque and unlikely.  They were  both laughed at by the rest; but night after night another came over to  their side, until at last there was only one left to laugh at all his  companions.  Two nights more passed, and he saw nothing; but on the  third he came rushing from the garden to the other two before the  house, in such an agitation that they declared--for it was their turn  now--that the band of his helmet was cracking under his chin with the  rising of his hair inside it. Running with him into that part of the  garden which I have already described, they saw a score of creatures,  to not one of which they could give a name, and not one of which was  like another, hideous and ludicrous at once, gambolling on the lawn in  the moonlight. The supernatural or rather subnatural ugliness of their  faces, the length of legs and necks in some, the apparent absence of  both or either in others, made the spectators, although in one consent  as to what they saw, yet doubtful, as I have said, of the evidence of  their own eyes--and ears as well; for the noises they made, although  not loud, were as uncouth and varied as their forms, and could be  described neither as grunts nor squeaks nor roars nor howls nor barks  nor yells nor screams nor croaks nor hisses nor mews nor shrieks, but  only as something like all of them mingled in one horrible dissonance.  Keeping in the shade, the watchers had a few moments to recover  themselves before the hideous assembly suspected their presence; but  all at once, as if by common consent, they scampered off in the  direction of a great rock, and vanished before the men had come to  themselves sufficiently to think of following them.    My readers will suspect what these were; but I will now give them full  information concerning them.  They were, of course, household animals  belonging to the goblins, whose ancestors had taken their ancestors  many centuries before from the upper regions of light into the lower  regions of darkness.  The original stocks of these horrible creatures  were very much the same as the animals now seen about farms and homes  in the country, with the exception of a few of them, which had been  wild creatures, such as foxes, and indeed wolves and small bears, which  the goblins, from their proclivity towards the animal creation, had  caught when cubs and tamed.  But in the course of time all had  undergone even greater changes than had passed upon their owners.  They  had altered--that is, their descendants had altered--into such  creatures as I have not attempted to describe except in the vaguest  manner--the various parts of their bodies assuming, in an apparently  arbitrary and self-willed manner, the most abnormal developments.  Indeed, so little did any distinct type predominate in some of the  bewildering results, that you could only have guessed at any known  animal as the original, and even then, what likeness remained would be  more one of general expression than of definable conformation.  But  what increased the gruesomeness tenfold was that, from constant  domestic, or indeed rather family association with the goblins, their  countenances had grown in grotesque resemblance to the human.    No one understands animals who does not see that every one of them,  even amongst the fishes, it may be with a dimness and vagueness  infinitely remote, yet shadows the human: in the case of these the  human resemblance had greatly increased: while their owners had sunk  towards them, they had risen towards their owners.  But the conditions  of subterranean life being equally unnatural for both, while the  goblins were worse, the creatures had not improved by the  approximation, and its result would have appeared far more ludicrous  than consoling to the warmest lover of animal nature.  I shall now  explain how it was that just then these animals began to show  themselves about the king's country house.    The goblins, as Curdie had discovered, were mining on--at work both day  and night, in divisions, urging the scheme after which he lay in wait.  In the course of their tunnelling they had broken into the channel of a  small stream, but the break being in the top of it, no water had  escaped to interfere with their work.  Some of the creatures, hovering  as they often did about their masters, had found the hole, and had,  with the curiosity which had grown to a passion from the restraints of  their unnatural circumstances, proceeded to explore the channel.  The  stream was the same which ran out by the seat on which Irene and her  king-papa had sat as I have told, and the goblin creatures found it  jolly fun to get out for a romp on a smooth lawn such as they had never  seen in all their poor miserable lives.  But although they had partaken  enough of the nature of their owners to delight in annoying and  alarming any of the people whom they met on the mountain, they were, of  course, incapable of designs of their own, or of intentionally  furthering those of their masters.    For several nights after the men-at-arms were at length of one mind as  to the fact of the visits of some horrible creatures, whether bodily or  spectral they could not yet say, they watched with special attention  that part of the garden where they had last seen them.  Perhaps indeed  they gave in consequence too little attention to the house.  But the  creatures were too cunning to be easily caught; nor were the watchers  quick-eyed enough to descry the head, or the keen eyes in it, which,  from the opening whence the stream issued, would watch them in turn,  ready, the moment they should leave the lawn, to report the place clear.        CHAPTER 14    That Night Week    During the whole of the week Irene had been thinking every other moment  of her promise to the old lady, although even now she could not feel  quite sure that she had not been dreaming.  Could it really be that an  old lady lived up in the top of the house, with pigeons and a  spinning-wheel, and a lamp that never went out?  She was, however, none  the less determined, on the coming Friday, to ascend the three stairs,  walk through the passages with the many doors, and try to find the  tower in which she had either seen or dreamed her grandmother.    Her nurse could not help wondering what had come to the child--she  would sit so thoughtfully silent, and even in the midst of a game with  her would so suddenly fall into a dreamy mood.  But Irene took care to  betray nothing, whatever efforts Lootie might make to get at her  thoughts.  And Lootie had to say to herself: 'What an odd child she  is!' and give it up.    At length the longed-for Friday arrived, and lest Lootie should be  moved to watch her, Irene endeavoured to keep herself as quiet as  possible.  In the afternoon she asked for her doll's house, and went on  arranging and rearranging the various rooms and their inhabitants for a  whole hour.  Then she gave a sigh and threw herself back in her chair.  One of the dolls would not sit, and another would not stand, and they  were all very tiresome.  Indeed, there was one would not even lie down,  which was too bad.  But it was now getting dark, and the darker it got  the more excited Irene became, and the more she felt it necessary to be  composed.    'I see you want your tea, princess,' said the nurse: 'I will go and get  it.  The room feels close: I will open the window a little. The evening  is mild: it won't hurt you.'    'There's no fear of that, Lootie,' said Irene, wishing she had put off  going for the tea till it was darker, when she might have made her  attempt with every advantage.    I fancy Lootie was longer in returning than she had intended; for when  Irene, who had been lost in thought, looked up, she saw it was nearly  dark, and at the same moment caught sight of a pair of eyes, bright  with a green light, glowering at her through the open window.  The next  instant something leaped into the room.  It was like a cat, with legs  as long as a horse's, Irene said, but its body no bigger and its legs  no thicker than those of a cat.  She was too frightened to cry out, but  not too frightened to jump from her chair and run from the room.    It is plain enough to every one of my readers what she ought to have  done--and indeed, Irene thought of it herself; but when she came to the  foot of the old stair, just outside the nursery door, she imagined the  creature running up those long ascents after her, and pursuing her  through the dark passages--which, after all, might lead to no tower!  That thought was too much.  Her heart failed her, and, turning from the  stair, she rushed along to the hall, whence, finding the"]]]
