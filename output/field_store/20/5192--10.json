[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6382"],[0,"Bat Wing (#12)"],[1," I thought that before affliction visited her Madame de Staemer must have  been a vivacious and a beautiful woman. Her vivacity remained and much  of her beauty, so that it was difficult to believe her snow-white hair  to be a product of nature. Again and again I found myself regarding it  as a powdered coiffure of the Pompadour period and wondering why Madame  wore no patches.    That a deep and sympathetic understanding existed between herself and  Colonel Menendez was unmistakable. More than once I intercepted glances  from the dark eyes of Madame which were lover-like, yet laden with a  profound sorrow. She was playing a role, and I was convinced that Harley  knew this. It was not merely a courageous fight against affliction on  the part of a woman of the world, versed in masking her real self from  the prying eyes of society, it was a studied performance prompted by  some deeper motive.    She dressed with exquisite taste, and to see her seated there amid her  cushions, gesticulating vivaciously, one would never have supposed that  she was crippled. My admiration for her momentarily increased, the more  so since I could see that she was sincerely fond of Val Beverley, whose  every movement she followed with looks of almost motherly affection.  This was all the more strange as Madame de Staemer whose age, I supposed,  lay somewhere on the sunny side of forty, was of a type which expects,  and wins, admiration, long after the average woman has ceased to be  attractive.    One endowed with such a temperament is as a rule unreasonably jealous  of youth and good looks in another. I could not determine if Madame's  attitude were to be ascribed to complacent self-satisfaction or to a  nobler motive. It sufficed for me that she took an unfeigned joy in the  youthful sweetness of her companion.    \"Val, dear,\" she said, presently, addressing the girl, \"you should make  those sleeves shorter, my dear.\"    She had a rapid way of speaking, and possessed a slightly husky but  fascinatingly vibrant voice.    \"Your arms are very pretty. You should not hide them.\"    Val Beverley blushed, and laughed to conceal her embarrassment.    \"Oh, my dear,\" exclaimed Madame, \"why be ashamed of arms? All women have  arms, but some do well to hide them.\"    \"Quite right, Marie,\" agreed the Colonel, his thin voice affording an  odd contrast to the deeper tones of his cousin. \"But it is the scraggy  ones who seem to delight in displaying their angles.\"    \"The English, yes,\" Madame admitted, \"but the French, no. They are too  clever, Juan.\"    \"Frenchwomen think too much about their looks,\" said Val Beverley,  quietly. \"Oh, you know they do, Madame. They would rather die than be  without admiration.\"    Madame shrugged her shoulders.    \"So would I, my dear,\" she confessed, \"although I cannot walk. Without  admiration there is\"--she snapped her fingers--\"nothing. And who would  notice a linnet when a bird of paradise was about, however sweet her  voice? Tell me that, my dear?\"    Paul Harley aroused himself and laughed heartily.    \"Yet,\" he said, \"I think with Miss Beverley, that this love of elegance  does not always make for happiness. Surely it is the cause of half the  domestic tragedies in France?\"    \"Ah, the French love elegance,\" cried Madame, shrugging, \"they cannot  help it. To secure what is elegant a Frenchwoman will sometimes forget  her husband, yes, but never forget herself.\"    \"Really, Marie,\" protested the Colonel, \"you say most strange things!\"    \"Is that so, Juan?\" she replied, casting one of her queer glances in his  direction; \"but how would you like to be surrounded by a lot of drabs,  eh? That man, Mr. Knox,\" she extended one white hand in the direction of  Colonel Menendez, the fingers half closed, in a gesture which curiously  reminded me of Sarah Bernhardt, \"that man would notice if a parlourmaid  came into the room with a shoe unbuttoned. Poof! if we love elegance it  is because without it the men would never love _us_.\"    Colonel Menendez bent across the table and kissed the white fingers in  his courtier-like fashion.    \"My sweet cousin,\" he said, \"I should love you in rags.\"    Madame smiled and flushed like a girl, but withdrawing her hand she  shrugged.    \"They would have to be _pretty_ rags!\" she added.    During this little scene I detected Val Beverley looking at me in a  vaguely troubled way, and it was easy to guess that she was wondering  what construction I should place upon it. However:    \"I am going into the town,\" declared Madame de Staemer, energetically.  \"Half the things ordered from Hartley's have never been sent.\"    \"Oh, Madame, please let _me_ go,\" cried Val Beverley.    \"My dear,\" pronounced Madame, \"I will not let you go, but I will let you  come with me if you wish.\"    She rang a little bell which stood upon the tea-table beside the urn,  and Pedro came out through the drawing room.    \"Pedro,\" she said, \"is the car ready?\"    The Spanish butler bowed.    \"Tell Carter to bring it round. Hurry, dear,\" to the girl, \"if you are  coming with me. I shall not be a minute.\"    Thereupon she whisked her mechanical chair about, waved her hand to  dismiss Pedro, and went steering through the drawing room at a great  rate, with Val Beverley walking beside her.    As we resumed our seats Colonel Menendez lay back with half-closed  eyes, his glance following the chair and its occupant until both were  swallowed up in the shadows of the big drawing room.    \"Madame de Staemer is a very remarkable woman,\" said Paul Harley.    \"Remarkable?\" replied the Colonel. \"The spirit of all the old chivalry  of France is imprisoned within her, I think.\"    He passed cigarettes around, of a long kind resembling cheroots  and wrapped in tobacco leaf. I thought it strange that having thus  emphasized Madame's nationality he did not feel it incumbent upon him to  explain the mystery of their kinship. However, he made no attempt to do  so, and almost before we had lighted up, a racy little two-seater was  driven around the gravel path by Carter, the chauffeur who had brought  us to Cray's Folly from London.    The man descended and began to arrange wraps and cushions, and a few  moments later back came Madame again, dressed for driving. Carter  was about to lift her into the car when Colonel Menendez stood up and  advanced.    \"Sit down, Juan, sit down!\" said Madame, sharply.    A look of keen anxiety, I had almost said of pain, leapt into her eyes,  and the Colonel hesitated.    \"How often must I tell you,\" continued the throbbing voice, \"that you  must not exert yourself.\"    Colonel Menendez accepted the rebuke humbly, but the incident struck  me as grotesque; for it was difficult to associate delicacy with such a  fine specimen of well-preserved manhood as the Colonel.    However, Carter performed the duty of assisting Madame into her little  car, and when for a moment he supported her upright, before placing  her among the cushions, I noted that she was a tall woman, slender and  elegant.    All smiles and light, sparkling conversation, she settled herself  comfortably at the wheel and Val Beverley got in beside her. Madame  nodded to Carter in dismissal, waved her hand to Colonel Menendez, cried  \"Au revoir!\" and then away went the little car, swinging around the  angle of the house and out of sight.    Our host stood bare-headed upon the veranda listening to the sound  of the engine dying away among the trees. He seemed to be lost in  reflection from which he only aroused himself when the purr of the motor  became inaudible.    \"And now, gentlemen,\" he said, and suppressed a sigh, \"we have much to  talk about. This spot is cool, but is it sufficiently private? Perhaps,  Mr. Harley, you would prefer to talk in the library?\"    Paul Harley flicked ash from the end of his cigarette.    \"Better still in your own study, Colonel Menendez,\" he replied.    \"What, do you suspect eavesdroppers?\" asked the Colonel, his manner  becoming momentarily agitated.    He looked at Harley as though he suspected the latter of possessing  private information.    \"We should neglect no possible precaution,\" answered my friend. \"That  agencies inimical to your safety are focussed upon the house your own  statement amply demonstrates.\"    Colonel Menendez seemed to be on the point of speaking again, but he  checked himself and in silence led the way through the ornate library  to a smaller room which opened out of it, and which was furnished as a  study.    Here the motif was distinctly one of officialdom. Although the Southern  element was not lacking, it was not so marked as in the library or in  the hall. The place was appointed for utility rather than ornament.  Everything was in perfect order. In the library, with the blinds drawn,  one might have supposed oneself in Trinidad; in the study, under similar  conditions, one might equally well have imagined Downing Street to lie  outside the windows. Essentially, this was the workroom of a man of  affairs.    Having settled ourselves comfortably, Paul Harley opened the  conversation.    \"In several particulars,\" said he, \"I find my information to be  incomplete.\"    He consulted the back of an envelope, upon which, I presumed during the  afternoon, he had made a number of pencilled notes.    \"For instance,\" he continued, \"your detection of someone watching the  house, and subsequently of someone forcing an entrance, had no visible  association with the presence of the bat wing attached to your front  door?\"    \"No,\" replied the Colonel, slowly, \"these episodes took place a month  ago.\"    \"Exactly a month ago?\"    \"They took place immediately before the last full moon.\"    \"Ah, before the full moon. And because you associate the activities of  Voodoo with the full moon, you believe that the old menace has again  become active?\"    The Colonel nodded emphatically. He was busily engaged in rolling one of  his eternal cigarettes.    \"This belief of yours was recently"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64"],[0,"The Gods of Mars (#12)"],[1,"moons of Mars, hurtling like monster  meteors low across the face of the planet.    The declining sun lighted brilliantly the eastern banks of Korus, the  crimson sward, the gorgeous forest.  Beneath the trees we saw feeding  many herds of plant men.  The adults stood aloft upon their toes and  their mighty tails, their talons pruning every available leaf and twig.  It was then that I understood the careful trimming of the trees which  had led me to form the mistaken idea when first I opened my eyes upon  the grove that it was the playground of a civilized people.    As we watched, our eyes wandered to the rolling Iss, which issued from  the base of the cliffs beneath us.  Presently there emerged from the  mountain a canoe laden with lost souls from the outer world.  There  were a dozen of them.  All were of the highly civilized and cultured  race of red men who are dominant on Mars.    The eyes of the herald upon the balcony beneath us fell upon the doomed  party as soon as did ours.  He raised his head and leaning far out over  the low rail that rimmed his dizzy perch, voiced the shrill, weird wail  that called the demons of this hellish place to the attack.    For an instant the brutes stood with stiffly erected ears, then they  poured from the grove toward the river's bank, covering the distance  with great, ungainly leaps.    The party had landed and was standing on the sward as the awful horde  came in sight.  There was a brief and futile effort of defence.  Then  silence as the huge, repulsive shapes covered the bodies of their  victims and scores of sucking mouths fastened themselves to the flesh  of their prey.    I turned away in disgust.    \"Their part is soon over,\" said Thuvia.  \"The great white apes get the  flesh when the plant men have drained the arteries.  Look, they are  coming now.\"    As I turned my eyes in the direction the girl indicated, I saw a dozen  of the great white monsters running across the valley toward the river  bank.  Then the sun went down and darkness that could almost be felt  engulfed us.    Thuvia lost no time in leading us toward the corridor which winds back  and forth up through the cliffs toward the surface thousands of feet  above the level on which we had been.    Twice great banths, wandering loose through the galleries, blocked our  progress, but in each instance Thuvia spoke a low word of command and  the snarling beasts slunk sullenly away.    \"If you can dissolve all our obstacles as easily as you master these  fierce brutes I can see no difficulties in our way,\" I said to the  girl, smiling.  \"How do you do it?\"    She laughed, and then shuddered.    \"I do not quite know,\" she said.  \"When first I came here I angered  Sator Throg, because I repulsed him.  He ordered me to be thrown into  one of the great pits in the inner gardens.  It was filled with banths.  In my own country I had been accustomed to command.  Something in my  voice, I do not know what, cowed the beasts as they sprang to attack me.    \"Instead of tearing me to pieces, as Sator Throg had desired, they  fawned at my feet.  So greatly were Sator Throg and his friends amused  by the sight that they kept me to train and handle the terrible  creatures.  I know them all by name.  There are many of them wandering  through these lower regions.  They are the scavengers.  Many prisoners  die here in their chains.  The banths solve the problem of sanitation,  at least in this respect.    \"In the gardens and temples above they are kept in pits.  The therns  fear them.  It is because of the banths that they seldom venture below  ground except as their duties call them.\"    An idea occurred to me, suggested by what Thuvia had just said.    \"Why not take a number of banths and set them loose before us above  ground?\" I asked.    Thuvia laughed.    \"It would distract attention from us, I am sure,\" she said.    She commenced calling in a low singsong voice that was half purr.  She  continued this as we wound our tedious way through the maze of  subterranean passages and chambers.    Presently soft, padded feet sounded close behind us, and as I turned I  saw a pair of great, green eyes shining in the dark shadows at our  rear.  From a diverging tunnel a sinuous, tawny form crept stealthily  toward us.    Low growls and angry snarls assailed our ears on every side as we  hastened on and one by one the ferocious creatures answered the call of  their mistress.    She spoke a word to each as it joined us.  Like well-schooled terriers,  they paced the corridors with us, but I could not help but note the  lathering jowls, nor the hungry expressions with which they eyed Tars  Tarkas and myself.    Soon we were entirely surrounded by some fifty of the brutes.  Two  walked close on either side of Thuvia, as guards might walk.  The sleek  sides of others now and then touched my own naked limbs.  It was a  strange experience; the almost noiseless passage of naked human feet  and padded paws; the golden walls splashed with precious stones; the  dim light cast by the tiny radium bulbs set at considerable distances  along the roof; the huge, maned beasts of prey crowding with low growls  about us; the mighty green warrior towering high above us all; myself  crowned with the priceless diadem of a Holy Thern; and leading the  procession the beautiful girl, Thuvia.    I shall not soon forget it.    Presently we approached a great chamber more brightly lighted than the  corridors.  Thuvia halted us.  Quietly she stole toward the entrance  and glanced within.  Then she motioned us to follow her.    The room was filled with specimens of the strange beings that inhabit  this underworld; a heterogeneous collection of hybrids--the offspring  of the prisoners from the outside world; red and green Martians and the  white race of therns.    Constant confinement below ground had wrought odd freaks upon their  skins.  They more resemble corpses than living beings.  Many are  deformed, others maimed, while the majority, Thuvia explained, are  sightless.    As they lay sprawled about the floor, sometimes overlapping one  another, again in heaps of several bodies, they suggested instantly to  me the grotesque illustrations that I had seen in copies of Dante's  INFERNO, and what more fitting comparison?  Was this not indeed a  veritable hell, peopled by lost souls, dead and damned beyond all hope?    Picking our way carefully we threaded a winding path across the  chamber, the great banths sniffing hungrily at the tempting prey spread  before them in such tantalizing and defenceless profusion.    Several times we passed the entrances to other chambers similarly  peopled, and twice again we were compelled to cross directly through  them.  In others were chained prisoners and beasts.    \"Why is it that we see no therns?\" I asked of Thuvia.    \"They seldom traverse the underworld at night, for then it is that the  great banths prowl the dim corridors seeking their prey.  The therns  fear the awful denizens of this cruel and hopeless world that they have  fostered and allowed to grow beneath their feet.  The prisoners even  sometimes turn upon them and rend them.  The thern can never tell from  what dark shadow an assassin may spring upon his back.    \"By day it is different.  Then the corridors and chambers are filled  with guards passing to and fro; slaves from the temples above come by  hundreds to the granaries and storerooms.  All is life then.  You did  not see it because I led you not in the beaten tracks, but through  roundabout passages seldom used.  Yet it is possible that we may meet a  thern even yet.  They do occasionally find it necessary to come here  after the sun has set.  Because of this I have moved with such great  caution.\"    But we reached the upper galleries without detection and presently  Thuvia halted us at the foot of a short, steep ascent.    \"Above us,\" she said, \"is a doorway which opens on to the inner  gardens.  I have brought you thus far.  From here on for four miles to  the outer ramparts our way will be beset by countless dangers.  Guards  patrol the courts, the temples, the gardens.  Every inch of the  ramparts themselves is beneath the eye of a sentry.\"    I could not understand the necessity for such an enormous force of  armed men about a spot so surrounded by mystery and superstition that  not a soul upon Barsoom would have dared to approach it even had they  known its exact location.  I questioned Thuvia, asking her what enemies  the therns could fear in their impregnable fortress.    We had reached the doorway now and Thuvia was opening it.    \"They fear the black pirates of Barsoom, O Prince,\" she said, \"from  whom may our first ancestors preserve us.\"    The door swung open; the smell of growing things greeted my nostrils;  the cool night air blew against my cheek.  The great banths sniffed the  unfamiliar odours, and then with a rush they broke past us with low  growls, swarming across the gardens beneath the lurid light of the  nearer moon.    Suddenly a great cry arose from the roofs of the temples; a cry of  alarm and warning that, taken up from point to point, ran off to the  east and to the west, from temple, court, and rampart, until it sounded  as a dim echo in the distance.    The great Thark's long-sword leaped from its scabbard; Thuvia shrank  shuddering to my side.          CHAPTER VI    THE BLACK PIRATES OF BARSOOM      \"What is it?\" I asked of the girl.    For answer she pointed to the sky.    I looked, and there, above us, I saw shadowy bodies flitting hither and  thither high over temple, court, and garden.    Almost immediately flashes of light broke from these strange objects.  There was a roar of musketry, and then answering flashes and roars from  temple and rampart.    \"The black pirates of Barsoom, O Prince,\" said Thuvia.    In great circles the air craft of the marauders swept lower and lower  toward the defending forces of the therns.    Volley after volley they vomited "]]]
