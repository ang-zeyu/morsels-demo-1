Dayanand tries to show that the ancient Aryans knew, and even visited,  America, which in ancient MSS. is called Patala, and out of which  popular fancy constructed, in the course of time, something like the  Greek Hades. He supports his theory by many quotations from the oldest  MSS., especially from the legends about Krishna and his favourite  disciple Arjuna. In the history of the latter it is mentioned that  Arjuna, one of the five Pandavas, descendants of the moon dynasty,  visited Patala on his travels, and there married the widowed daughter of  King Nagual, called Illupl. Comparing the names of father and daughter  we reach the following considerations, which speak strongly in favour of  Dayanand's supposition.    (1) Nagual is the name by which the sorcerers of Mexico, Indians and  aborigines of America, are still designated. Like the Assyrian and  Chaldean Nargals, chiefs of the Magi, the Mexican Nagual unites in his  person the functions of priest and of sorcerer, being served in the  latter capacity by a demon in the shape of some animal, generally a  snake or a crocodile. These Naguals are thought to be the descendants  of Nagua, the king of the snakes. Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg devotes a  considerable amount of space to them in his book about Mexico, and says  that the Naguals are servants of the evil one, who, in his turn, renders  them but a temporary service. In Sanskrit, likewise, snake is Naga,  and the \"King of the Nagas\" plays an important part in the history of  Buddha; and in the Puranas there exists a tradition that it was Arjuna  who introduced snake worship into Patala. The coincidence, and the  identity of the names are so striking that our scientists really ought  to pay some attention to them.    (2) The Name of Arjuna's wife Illupl is purely old Mexican, and if we  reject the hypothesis of Swami Daya-nand it will be perfectly impossible  to explain the actual existence of this name in Sanskrit manuscripts  long before the Christian era. Of all ancient dialects and languages  it is only in those of the American aborigines that you constantly meet  with such combinations of consonants as pl, tl, etc. They are abundant  especially in the language of the Toltecs, or Nahuatl, whereas, neither  in Sanskrit nor in ancient Greek are they ever found at the end of  a word. Even the words Atlas and Atlantis seem to be foreign to the  etymology of the European languages. Wherever Plato may have found them,  it was not he who invented them. In the Toltec language we find the  root atl, which means water and war, and directly after America was  discovered Columbus found a town called Atlan, at the entrance of the  Bay of Uraga. It is now a poor fishing village called Aclo. Only  in America does one find such names as Itzcoatl, Zempoaltecatl, and  Popocatepetl. To attempt to explain such coincidences by the theory of  blind chance would be too much, consequently, as long as science does  not seek to deny Dayanand's hypothesis, which, as yet, it is unable to  do, we think it reasonable to adopt it, be it only in order to follow  out the axiom \"one hypothesis is equal to another.\" Amongst other things  Dayanand points out that the route that led Arjuna to America five  thousand years ago was by Siberia and Behring's Straits.    It was long past midnight, but we still sat listening to this legend and  others of a similar kind. At length the innkeeper sent a servant to  warn us of the dangers that threatened us if we lingered too long on the  verandah on a moonlit night. The programme of these dangers was divided  into three sections--snakes, beasts of prey, and dacoits. Besides the  cobra and the \"rock-snake,\" the surrounding mountains are full of a kind  of very small mountain snake, called furzen, the most dangerous of  all. Their poison kills with the swiftness of lightning. The moonlight  attracts them, and whole parties of these uninvited guests crawl up to  the verandahs of houses, in order to warm themselves. Here they are more  snug than on the wet ground. The verdant and perfumed abyss below  our verandah happened, too, to be the favorite resort of tigers and  leopards, who come thither to quench their thirst at the broad brook  which runs along the bottom, and then wander until daybreak under the  windows of the bungalow. Lastly, there were the mad dacoits, whose dens  are scattered in mountains inaccessible to the police, who often shoot  Europeans simply to afford themselves the pleasure of sending ad patres  one of the hateful bellatis (foreigners). Three days before our arrival  the wife of a Brahman disappeared, carried off by a tiger, and two  favorite dogs of the commandant were killed by snakes. We declined to  wait for further explanations, but hurried to our rooms. At daybreak we  were to start for Karli, six miles from this place.          In The Karli Caves        At five o'clock in the morning we had already arrived at the limit, not  only of driveable, but, even, of rideable roads. Our bullock-cart could  go no further. The last half mile was nothing but a rough sea of stones.  We had either to give up our enterprise, or to climb on all-fours up an  almost perpendicular slope two hundred feet high. We were utterly at  our wits' end, and meekly gazed at the historical mass before us, not  knowing what to do next. Almost at the summit of the mountain, under  the overhanging rocks, were a dozen black openings. Hundreds of pilgrims  were crawling upwards, looking, in their holiday dresses, like so many  green, pink, and blue ants. Here, however, our faithful Hindu friends  came to our rescue. One of them, putting the palm of his hand to his  mouth, produced a strident sound something between a shriek and a  whistle. This signal was answered from above by an echo, and the next  moment several half naked Brahmans, hereditary watchmen of the temple,  began to descend the rocks as swiftly and skillfully as wild cats.  Five minutes later they were with us, fastening round our bodies strong  leathern straps, and rather dragging than leading us upwards. Half an  hour later, exhausted but perfectly safe, we stood before the porch  of the chief temple, which until then had been hidden from us by giant  trees and cactuses.    This majestic entrance, resting on four massive pillars which form a  quadrangle, is fifty-two feet wide and is covered with ancient moss and  carvings. Before it stands the \"lion column,\" so-called from the four  lions carved as large as nature, and seated back to back, at its base.  Over the principal entrance, its sides covered with colossal male  and female figures, is a huge arch, in front of which three gigantic  elephants are sculptured in relief, with heads and trunks that project  from the wall. The shape of the temple is oval. It is 128 feet long and  forty-six feet wide. The central space is separated on each side  from the aisles by forty-two pillars, which sustain the cupola-shaped  ceiling. Further on is an altar, which divides the first dome from  a second one which rises over a small chamber, formerly used by the  ancient Aryan priests for an inner, secret altar. Two side passages  leading towards it come to a sudden end, which suggests that, once upon  a time, either doors or wall were there which exist no longer. Each of  the forty-two pillars has a pedestal, an octagonal shaft, and a  capital, described by Fergusson as \"of the most exquisite workmanship,  representing two kneeling elephants surmounted by a god and a goddess.\"  Fergusson further says that this temple, or chaitya, is older and better  preserved than any other in India, and may be assigned to a period about  200 years B.C., because Prinsep, who has read the inscription on the  Silastamba pillar, asserts that the lion pillar was the gift of Ajmitra  Ukasa, son of Saha Ravisobhoti, and another inscription shows that  the temple was visited by Dathama Hara, otherwise Dathahamini, King of  Ceylon, in the twentieth year of his reign, that is to say, 163 years  before our era. For some reason or other, Dr. Stevenson points to  seventy years B.C. as the date, asserting that Karlen, or Karli, was  built by the Emperor Devobhuti, under the supervision of Dhanu-Kakata.  But how can this be maintained in view of the above-mentioned perfectly  authentic inscriptions? Even Fergusson, the celebrated defender of the  Egyptian antiquities and hostile critic of those of India, insists that  Karli belongs to the erections of the third century B.C., adding that  \"the disposition of the various parts of its architecture is identical  with the architecture of the choirs of the Gothic period, and the  polygonal apsides of cathedrals.\"    Above the chief entrance is found a gallery, which reminds one of the  choirs, where, in Catholic churches, the organ is placed. Besides the  chief entrance there are two lateral entrances, leading to the aisles  of the temple, and over the gallery there is a single spacious window in  the shape of a horseshoe, so that the light falls on the daghopa (altar)  entirely from above, leaving the aisles, sheltered by the pillars,  in obscurity, which increases as you approach the further end of the  building. To the eyes of a spectator standing at the entrance, the whole  daghopa shines with light, and behind it is nothing but impenetrable  darkness, where no profane footsteps were permitted to tread. A figure  on the dag-hopa, from the summit of which \"Raja priests\" used to  pronounce verdicts to the people, is called Dharma-Raja, from Dharma,  the Hindu Minos. Above the temple are two stories of caves, in each of  which are wide open galleries formed by huge carved pillars, and from  these galleries an opening leads to roomy cells and corridors, sometimes  very long, but quite useless, as they invariably come to an abrupt  termination at solid walls, without the trace of an issue of any kind.

While at Wheeling father preached eleven times,--nearly  every evening,--and gave them the Taylorite heresy on sin and decrees  to the highest notch; and what amused me most was to hear him establish  it from the Confession of Faith. It went high and dry, however, above  all objections, and they were delighted with it, even the old school  men, since it had not been christened 'heresy' in their hearing. After  remaining in Wheeling eight days, we chartered a stage for Cincinnati,  and started next morning.    \"At Granville, Ohio, we were invited to stop and attend a protracted  meeting. Being in no great hurry to enter Cincinnati till the cholera  had left, we consented. We spent the remainder of the week there, and I  preached five times and father four. The interest was increasingly deep  and solemn each day, and when we left there were forty-five cases of  conversion in the town, besides those from the surrounding towns. The  people were astonished at the doctrine; said they never saw the truth  so plain in their lives.\"    Although the new-comers were cordially welcomed in Cincinnati, and  everything possible was done for their comfort and to make them feel  at home, they felt themselves to be strangers in a strange land.  Their homesickness and yearnings for New England are set forth by the  following extracts from Mrs. Stowe's answer to the first letter they  received from Hartford after leaving there:--    MY DEAR SISTER (Mary),--The Hartford letter from all and sundry has  just arrived, and after cutting all manner of capers expressive of  thankfulness, I have skipped three stairs at a time up to the study  to begin an answer. My notions of answering letters are according  to the literal sense of the word; not waiting six months and then  scrawling a lazy reply, but sitting down the moment you have read a  letter, and telling, as Dr. Woods says, \"How the subject strikes you.\"  I wish I could be clear that the path of duty lay in talking to you  this afternoon, but as I find a loud call to consider the heels of  George's stockings, I must only write a word or two, and then resume  my darning-needle. You don't know how anxiously we all have watched  for some intelligence from Hartford. Not a day has passed when I have  not been the efficient agent in getting somebody to the post-office,  and every day my heart has sunk at the sound of \"no letters.\" I felt a  tremor quite sufficient for a lover when I saw your handwriting once  more, so you see that in your old age you can excite quite as much  emotion as did the admirable Miss Byron in her adoring Sir Charles. I  hope the consideration and digestion of this fact will have its due  weight in encouraging you to proceed.    The fact of our having received said letter is as yet a state secret,  not to be made known till all our family circle \"in full assembly meet\"  at the tea-table. Then what an illumination! \"How we shall be edified  and fructified,\" as that old Methodist said. It seems too bad to keep  it from mother and Aunt Esther a whole afternoon, but then I have the  comfort of thinking that we are consulting for their greatest happiness  \"on the whole,\" which is metaphysical benevolence.    So kind Mrs. Parsons stopped in the very midst of her pumpkin pies to  think of us? Seems to me I can see her bright, cheerful face now! And  then those well known handwritings! We _do_ love our Hartford friends  dearly; there can be, I think, no controverting that fact. Kate says  that the word _love_ is used in _six senses_, and I am sure in some one  of them they will all come in. Well, good-by for the present.    Evening. Having finished the last hole on George's black vest, I stick  in my needle and sit down to be sociable. You don't know how coming  away from New England has sentimentalized us all! Never was there  such an abundance of meditation on our native land, on the joys of  friendship, the pains of separation. Catherine had an alarming paroxysm  in Philadelphia which expended itself in \"The Emigrant's Farewell.\"  After this was sent off she felt considerably relieved. My symptoms  have been of a less acute kind, but, I fear, more enduring. There! the  tea-bell rings. Too bad! I was just going to say something bright. Now  to take your letter and run! How they will stare when I produce it!    After tea. Well, we have had a fine time. When supper was about half  over, Catherine began: \"We have a dessert that we have been saving all  the afternoon,\" and then I held up my letter. \"See here, this is from  Hartford!\" I wish you could have seen Aunt Esther's eyes brighten, and  mother's pale face all in a smile, and father, as I unfolded the letter  and began. Mrs. Parsons's notice of her Thanksgiving predicament caused  just a laugh, and then one or two sighs (I told you we were growing  sentimental!). We did talk some of keeping it (Thanksgiving), but  perhaps we should all have felt something of the text, \"How shall we  sing the Lord's song in a strange land?\" Your praises of Aunt Esther  I read twice in an audible voice, as the children made some noise the  first time. I think I detected a visible blush, though she found at  that time a great deal to do in spreading bread and butter for James,  and shuffling his plate; and, indeed, it was rather a vehement attack  on her humility, since it gave her at least \"angelic perfection,\" if  not \"Adamic\" (to use Methodist technics). Jamie began his Sunday-school  career yesterday. The superintendent asked him how old he was. \"I'm  four years old now, and when it _snows very hard_ I shall be five,\" he  answered. I have just been trying to make him interpret his meaning;  but he says, \"Oh, I said so because I could not think of anything else  to say.\" By the by, Mary, speaking of the temptations of cities, I  have much solicitude on Jamie's account lest he should form improper  intimacies, for yesterday or day before we saw him parading by the  house with his arm over the neck of a great hog, apparently on the most  amicable terms possible; and the other day he actually got upon the  back of one, and rode some distance. So much for allowing these animals  to promenade the streets, a particular in which Mrs. Cincinnati has  imitated the domestic arrangements of some of her elder sisters, and a  very disgusting one it is.    Our family physician is one Dr. Drake, a man of a good deal of  science, theory, and reputed skill, but a sort of general mark for  the opposition of all the medical cloth of the city. He is a tall,  rectangular, perpendicular sort of a body, as stiff as a poker, and  enunciates his prescriptions very much as though he were delivering  a discourse on the doctrine of election. The other evening he was  detained from visiting Kate, and he sent a very polite, ceremonious  note containing a prescription, with Dr. D.'s compliments to Miss  Beecher, requesting that she would take the inclosed in a little  molasses at nine o'clock precisely.    The house we are at present inhabiting is the most inconvenient,  ill-arranged, good-for-nothing, and altogether to be execrated affair  that ever was put together. It was evidently built without a thought of  a winter season. The kitchen is so disposed that it cannot be reached  from any part of the house without going out into the air. Mother is  actually obliged to put on a bonnet and cloak every time she goes into  it. In the house are two parlors with folding doors between them. The  back parlor has but one window, which opens on a veranda and has its  lower half painted to keep out what little light there is. I need  scarcely add that our landlord is an old bachelor and of course acted  up to the light he had, though he left little enough of it for his  tenants.           *       *       *       *       *    During this early Cincinnati life Harriet suffered much from ill-health  accompanied by great mental depression; but in spite of both she  labored diligently with her sister Catherine in establishing their  school. They called it the Western Female Institute, and proposed to  conduct it upon the college plan, with a faculty of instructors. As all  these things are treated at length in letters written by Mrs. Stowe to  her friend, Miss Georgiana May, we cannot do better than turn to them.  In May, 1833, she writes:--    \"Bishop Purcell visited our school to-day and expressed himself as  greatly pleased that we had opened such an one here. He spoke of my  poor little geography,[1] and thanked me for the unprejudiced manner  in which I had handled the Catholic question in it. I was of course  flattered that he should have known anything of the book.    \"How I wish you could see Walnut Hills. It is about two miles from the  city, and the road to it is as picturesque as you can imagine a road to  be without 'springs that run among the hills.' Every possible variety  of hill and vale of beautiful slope, and undulations of land set off by  velvet richness of turf and broken up by groves and forests of every  outline of foliage, make the scene Arcadian. You might ride over the  same road a dozen times a day untired, for the constant variation of  view caused by ascending and descending hills relieves you from all  tedium. Much of the wooding is beech of a noble growth. The straight,  beautiful shafts of these trees as one looks up the cool green recesses  of the woods seems as though they might form very proper columns for  a Dryad temple. There! Catherine is growling at me for sitting up so  late; so 'adieu to music, moonlight, and you.' I meant to tell you an  abundance of classical things that I have been thinking to-night, but  'woe's me.'    \"Since writing the above my whole time has been taken up in the labor  of our new school, or wasted in the fatigue and lassitude following  such labor. To-day is Sunday, and I am staying at home because I think  it is time to"]]]
