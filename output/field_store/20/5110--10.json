From the  pond they brought in eels, gold-fish, trouts, and--\"    \"About how big were the trouts, Garrigou?\"    \"Oh, about so big, my reverend; simply enormous--\"    \"Holy Fathers! I can just see them. Did you put the wine in the  vases?\"    \"Yes, my reverend, I filled them; but mercy! that isn't anything  like the wine you'll have later, after midnight Mass. You ought to  see the dining-hall at the castle,--all the decanters glittering  with the many-colored wines, and the silver, the plate, the chased  centre-pieces, the flowers, the candelabrum; I don't suppose there  has ever been such a Christmas supper! The Lord Marquis has invited  all the lords of the neighboring estates. There will be over forty at  the table, leaving out the bailiff and the notary. Ah, my reverend,  you are very lucky to be invited! The smell of the truffles haunts me  now, simply from having sniffed at those turkeys,--meuh!\"    \"Come, come, my child, let us beware of the sin of  greediness,--particularly on the night of the Nativity. Hurry off now  and light the tapers, and ring the first call for Mass; it will soon  be midnight, and we can't afford to lose time.\"    This conversation occurred one Christmas night in the year of  our Lord sixteen hundred and something, between the reverend Dom  Balaguère, formerly prior of the Barnabites, and present chaplain  of the Sires of Trinquelague, and his little clerk, or rather what  he believed to be his little clerk Garrigou,--for let me tell you  that the Devil on that particular night had assumed the round face  and uncertain features of the young sacristan, the better to lead the  reverend father into temptation and make him commit a great sin of  greediness. So while the would-be Garrigou (hem! hem!) rang out the  chimes with all his might from the seigniorial chapel, the reverend  father was slipping on his chasuble in the little vestry; and as his  imagination was somewhat excited by Garrigou's gastronomic accounts,  he repeated mechanically as he got into his vestments,--    \"Two roast turkeys, gold-fish, trouts about so big!\"    Without, the night wind blew, and scattered the music of the bells.  Gradually lights began to pierce the gloom along the roads of Mount  Ventoux, on whose summit the old towers of Trinquelague reared their  mighty heads. The neighboring farmers and their families were on  their way to the castle to hear midnight Mass. They climbed the  mountain singing gayly, in little groups of five or six,--the father  ahead carrying the lantern, the women following, wrapped in great  dark cloaks under which the children snuggled to keep warm. In spite  of the cold and the advanced hour of the night, all these good people  walked along merrily, cheered by the thought that a great supper was  awaiting them as usual, below, in the castle kitchens, after Mass.  Every now and then, on the rough declivity some fine lord's coach,  preceded by torch-bearers, showed its glimmering window-panes in  the moonlight; or then a mule trotted along shaking its bells; or  again, by the light of their lanterns wrapped in mist, the farmers  recognized their bailiff and hailed him as they passed.    \"Good-night, good-night, Master Arnoton!\"    \"Good-night; good-night, my children!\"    It was a clear night; the stars seemed brightened by the cold; the  wind was nipping; and a fine sleet powdered all these cloaks without  wetting them, just in order to preserve the tradition that requires  Christmas to be white with snow.    On the very crest of the mountain the castle appeared like a goal,  with its huge mass of towers and gables, the chapel steeple rising  straight into the blue-black sky, while a thousand little lights  moved rapidly hither and thither, blinking at all the windows, and  looking, against the intense black of the building, like the tiny  sparks that glimmer in a pile of burnt paper.    After passing the drawbridge and the postern, in order to reach  the chapel, one had to cross the first court, crowded with coaches,  footmen, sedan-chairs, and bright with the flame of torches and the  glare from the kitchens. One could hear the clicking of the spits,  the rattling of pots, the tinkling of crystal and silver, as they  were laid out for the banquet; and above it all floated a warm vapor  smelling of roasted meats and the pungent herbs of complicated  sauces, which made the farmers, as well as the chaplain, the bailiff,  and everybody say,--    \"What a good supper we shall have after Mass!\"      II.    Ding, ling, ling! Ding, ling, ling!    Midnight Mass has begun. In the chapel of the castle, which is a  miniature cathedral, with intercrossed arches and oaken wainscoting  up to the ceiling, all the tapestries are hung, all the tapers  lighted. What a crowd of people, and what sumptuous costumes! Here,  in one of the carven stalls that surround the choir, sits the Sire  of Trinquelague, clad in salmon-colored silk, and around him all the  noble lords, his guests. Opposite them, on velvet fall-stools, kneel  the old dowager Marchioness, in a gown of flame-colored brocade, and  the young lady of Trinquelague, wearing on her pretty head a great  tower of lace puffed and quilled according to the latest fashion at  the court of France. Farther down the aisle, all dressed in black,  with vast pointed wigs and cleanly shaven chins, sit Thomas Arnoton  the bailiff, and the notary, Master Ambroy, two sombre spots amid  the high colors of silks and brocaded damasks. Then come the fat  major-domos, the pages, outriders, the stewards, Dame Barbe with her  great bunch of keys dangling from her side on a ring of fine silver.  On the benches in the rear is the lower service,--butlers, maids, the  farmers and their families. And last of all, far back against the  doors, which they discreetly open and close, come the cooks, between  two sauces, to catch a little whiff of the Mass, bringing with them  into the bedecked church, warm with the light of so many tapers,  odoriferous suggestions of the Christmas supper.    Can it be the sight of these crisp white caps that diverts the  reverend father's attention? Or is it not rather Garrigou's  bell?--that fiendish little bell that tinkles away at the foot of the  altar with such infernal haste, and seems to be saying,--    \"Come, come, let us hurry! The sooner we despatch the service, the  sooner we go to supper.\"    The fact of the matter is that at every peal from this little devil  of a bell, the chaplain forgets his Mass and allows his mind to  wander to the Christmas supper. He evokes visions of busy kitchens,  with ovens glowing like furnaces, warm vapors rising from under tin  lids, and through these vapors, two superb turkeys, stuffed, crammed,  mottled with truffles. Or then again, he sees long files of little  pages carrying great dishes wrapped in their tempting fumes, and  with them he is about to enter the dining-hall. What ecstasy! Here  stands the immense table, laden and dazzling with peacocks dressed in  their feathers, pheasants spreading their bronzed wings, ruby-colored  decanters, pyramids of luscious fruit amid the foliage, and those  wonderful fish that Garrigou spoke of (Garrigou, forsooth!) reclining  on a bed of fennel, their pearly scales looking as if they were just  from the pond, and a bunch of pungent herbs in their monster-like  nostrils. This beatific vision is so vivid that Dom Balaguère  actually fancies that the glorious dishes are being served before  him, on the very embroideries of the altar-cloth, and instead of  saying _Dominus vobiscum_, he catches himself saying the _Benedicite_.    With the exception of these slight mistakes the worthy man rattled  off the service conscientiously, without skipping a line, or omitting  a genuflection, and all went well to the end of the first Mass. For  you must know that on Christmas the same officiating priest is  obliged to say three Masses consecutively.    \"So much for one!\" thought the chaplain, with a sigh of relief;  and without losing a second, he motioned his clerk, or him whom he  believed to be his clerk, and--    Ding, ling, ling! Ding, ling, ling!    The second Mass has begun--and with it Dom Balaguère's sin. \"Come,  let us hurry!\" says Garrigou's bell, in a shrill, devilish little  voice, at the mere sound of which the unfortunate priest pounces  upon the missal and devours its pages with all the avidity of his  over-excited brain. He kneels and rises frantically, barely sketches  the sign of the cross and the genuflections, and shortens all of his  gestures in order to get through sooner. He scarcely extends his arms  at the Gospel, or strikes his breast at the _Confiteor_. Between him  and his little clerk it is hard to tell who mumbles the faster. The  words, half uttered between their teeth,--for it would take them too  long to open their lips every time,--die out into unintelligible  murmurs,--    Oremus--ps--ps--ps--    Meâ culpa--pâ--pâ--    Like hurried vintagers crushing the grapes in the mash-tuns, they  both splashed about in the Latin of the service, spattering it in  every direction.    \"Dom--scum!\" says Balaguère.    \"Stutuo!\" responds Garrigou, while the infernal little bell jingles  in their ears like the sleigh-bells that are put on stage-horses to  hasten their speed. You may well imagine that at such a rate a Low  Mass is soon rattled off.    \"So much for the second,\" says the panting chaplain, with scarlet  face, in a full perspiration; and without taking time to breathe, he  goes tumbling down the altar steps, and--    Ding, ling, ling! Ding, ling, ling!    The third Mass is under way. Only a few minutes stand between them  and the supper. But alas! as the time approaches, Dom Balaguère's  fever of impatience and greediness increases. His vision grows more  and more vivid; the fish, the roasted turkeys, are there before him;  he touches them; he--great Heavens!--he breathes the perfume of the  wines"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47338"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale.

When will you come again?\"    \"I can hardly hope for a repetition of my delightful visit for ten days  or a fortnight: but on the first possibility of leave I will return.\"    \"Do you know I took a long walk with nurse this morning; we had some  business in that wood I showed you from the dining room, and I saw so  many beautiful pictures _en route_; I must show you the walk. I do not  think Mr. Winter knows it very well, we cross a delightful ferry to  get to it, and--\"    The door opened and the Colonel entered.    \"Ah! Egerton, I have just been to your hotel, they told me you had  gone out only a few minutes before, and I thought it likely you would  make your way over here; I met Winter, Kate, and he dragged me off  to pass sentence on a pony he wants to buy, which he described as a  quiet, gentle animal Mrs. Winter might herself drive; but I saw at a  glance that the creature was blind of one eye, at least, and I strongly  suspect he is broken winded; however, I rather fancy Winter has set  his heart on the purchase, for the pony has a shaggy picturesque  appearance, and would look charmingly in a sketch, with a few autumnal  trees. Oh! I feel a little fagged;--and have you done much in the way  of sketching, this morning, Egerton?\"    \"No, indeed, Colonel, I do not feel sufficiently at home here yet; I  have not got my eye familiarised to the style of the place; I intend  to make great progress to-morrow. I cannot tell you how charmed I am  with this old town, it is so utterly dissimilar to Carrington, and its  abominations.\"    \"Ah!\" said the Colonel, \"the tone of society is not very thorough-bred  there, I suppose; but are you quite just in judging the worthy  citizens, by a standard they were never intended either by nature or  art to reach?\"    \"That is a question I have never asked myself, and probably never  shall.\"    \"Good breeding,\" continued Colonel Vernon, \"must be innate often;  there's Winter, you see, he has evidently risen from the ranks, yet one  feels at ease in his society, and free from all chance of his rubbing  you up the wrong way, as _parvenus_ are apt to do.\"    \"Winter belongs to a class distinct from, and superior to class  distinctions.\"    \"We are allies, from this moment, Captain Egerton,\" said Miss Vernon.    \"By the way, Kate, Mrs. Winter wants you to drink tea with her this  evening; I have promised for you and myself,\" observed her grandfather.    \"Of course, I like to drink tea at the abbey gardens; everything is so  pleasant and friendly; are you to be of our party, Captain Egerton?\"    \"I am happy to say, yes.\"    \"Then you had better join our early dinner, for Winter piques himself  on keeping continental hours, and I believe his tea is considerably  earlier than a London _dejeunér_\" said the Colonel.    \"Many thanks, my dear sir, but I have already eaten a substantial  luncheon, and intend acquitting myself with credit at Mrs. Winter's tea  table.\"    \"Oh!\" said Miss Vernon, laughing, \"some prophetic vision must have  warned you, that she is famous for hot cakes.\"    \"New style of life this, eh! Egerton?\"    \"I enjoy it extremely, and you Colonel. I cannot fancy any thing more  opposite to your life in Ireland.\"    \"True, true,\" he replied, \"yet I am very happy. Then, at my age,  a placid routine, unexciting, and calm, is naturally congenial; I  sometimes wish for a little more fellow-feeling on particular points  than Winter or even Gilpin can offer me. Kate is generally a great  sympathiser, but I confess, my dear Egerton, that a little chat with  you on old times and topics does me infinite good.\"    \"Captain Egerton says he will come back soon again, grandpapa, and  bring me some sketches he has of dear Dungar.\"    \"A treasure trove, Kate! But must you leave us so immediately?\"    \"I regret to say my leave expires to-morrow evening; I must return to  Carrington, but will take the last train, half-past eight I think; and  now I will say good-bye until this evening, Colonel. I want to get a  few more outlines into my portfolio before Mrs. Winter's hot cakes are  ready. _Au revoir_, Miss Vernon.\"    The Colonel and Cormac accompanied me to the door, which Nurse opened  with a gracious smile. \"Not a step further, Colonel Vernon, you are  fatigued; Mrs. O'Toole, I commend the Colonel to your care, adieu.\"  And as I walked away I heard confused and glowing eulogiums pronounced  by Mrs. O'Toole on some person or persons unknown, in which she seemed  to dwell particularly on the facility of distinguishing between \"The  rale ould ancient stock, and ye'r musherooms,\" terms of approbation my  vanity somehow or other appropriated, though the connection was by no  means clear.    With military punctuality I was raising the well burnished brass  knocker which adorned Winter's door as the cathedral clock chimed six.  A trim little damsel answered the summons, and informed me with a  rather frightened air, that \"Missis was in.\" She ushered me up stairs  to a large, handsomely furnished room, where sat Mrs. Winter in the  identical cap she had worn at the ball. I could have sworn to it in any  court in the kingdom.    She received me with the slight nervousness of manner I had before  observed, but we had hardly exchanged salutations when Winter appeared,  and carried me off to his studio. \"While there was any light,\" he  said, \"it was well worth a visit.\" Studies of trees in every season,  architectural drawings of great beauty, rugged old men and women, rosy  chubby children, some few strong deep subjects--a mine of pictorial  wealth; and the grand characteristic of each and all was truth; nothing  seemed beneath his pencil, nor a single object misplaced on his canvas.  I felt that a glance at his studio revealed the man more than the most  elaborate description of his character could have done. I began to  understand his views of imagination.    Mr. Winter had just pronounced it becoming too dark to judge fairly his  productions, when the little maid entered and informed him that tea and  the company were waiting; we returned to the drawing room, where we  found the Colonel and Miss Vernon, Gilpin, and a tall dried up looking  woman in a yellow turban, assembled round a large table, which groaned,  or ought to have groaned, under piles of delicately brown hot cakes,  multitudes of little round pats of butter, each adorned with a cowslip  in bas relief, and a massive tea equipage. There was a cheerful buzz of  conversation, with a pleasant accompaniment of hissing from a portly  tea urn that sent forth volumes of steam.    The gentlemen rose to greet us, and Winter, passing to the turbanned  lady, expressed his pleasure at seeing her, adding--    \"I do not think you know Miss Cox, Captain Egerton? The Honourable  Captain Egerton; Miss Araminta Cox.\"    Somewhat to my surprise the lady gave herself the trouble of rising to  make me a profound curtsey. I secured a seat between Mrs. Winter and  Kate, and joined in the general conversation, which took a very merry  turn on our appearance, in consequence of Winter having discovered  that Kate and Gilpin had been wofully taken in about some old stone  inscribed with Saxon or Runic characters, they had raved of for a  week, and which turned out to be frightfully modern. Kate, however,  retaliated by quizzing him on his intended purchase of a pony, more  fit for a picture than a phaeton; and clapped her hands in triumph,  when Winter disclosed the fact that, contrary to the Colonel's warning,  he had absolutely completed the purchase. Much laughter and ingenuity  were called forth by these rival charges, but we all found the gravity  and earnestness with which Winter repelled Kate's attacks upon his new  steed irresistible.    \"At all events, Mr. Winter, it is not half so disgraceful to be cheated  by an almost obliterated inscription on a stone, as to be taken in  by a horse-dealer. We deceived ourselves, but you have not even that  consolation; you fell a victim to the devices of a groom,\" concluded  Kate, pushing her chair from the tea-table, and rising.    \"_Per di Bacco!_\" exclaimed Winter thickly, and with the greatest  energy, \"the Colonel is mistaken; I tested the eyes; I tied a  handkerchief over the best looking of the two and led him up and down,  and he walked, sir, without the slightest hesitation! Tell me he is  minus an eye after that!\"    We received this conclusive evidence with a roar of laughter that  disturbed the murmured conference Mrs. Winter and Miss Cox had  maintained during our argument, fragments of which had reached my  ears occasionally, indicating strong disapprobation of some unhappy  individuals.    \"Do you play whist, Captain Egerton?\" enquired our hostess, as the trim  damsel was removing the goodly array which had suffered considerably  under our united efforts.    \"Hardly ever, Mrs. Winter; and when I do I get so rowed by my partners  that I am glad to abandon the attempt altogether.\"    \"We generally make up a whist table; the Colonel and Mr. Winter like a  rubber.\"    \"Do you play, Miss Vernon?\"    \"Yes, with a degree of science seldom equalled; therefore I rarely  honour Mrs. Winter's whist table.\"    \"We'll have that trio first, Miss Vernon,\" rejoined Mr. Winter. \"Gilpin  get the flute ready.\"    During the little bustle of bringing flute and violin into tune with  the piano, I approached the performers.    \"How did you like the hot cakes?\" asked Kate.    \"I think I gave ocular demonstration of my opinion,\" I replied,  laughing.    \"What are you going to play?\"    \"_Prendi l'anell' ti dono._\"    \"I thought that was a duet?\"    \"So it is; the flute and violin take first and second, the piano is a  mere accompaniment; you will be pleased with it.\"    \"How droll Winter is! His experiment on the pony was truly original.\"    \"Yes, and his habit of pointing his discourse with foreign  exclamations; he acquired the habit abroad, and complains he cannot do  without"]]]
