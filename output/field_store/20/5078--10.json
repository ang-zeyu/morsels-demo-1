Their Zion was threatened,--their institutions  in danger,--and with the fire of revenge burning in their hearts, at the  remembrance of former injuries, they rushed forth, to conquer or to die.    Many joined their brethren in Echo Canyon, without even shoes to their  feet, wading through snows several feet deep. Such devotion and heroism  were worthy of a better cause.    The feeling and determination of the people cannot be better expressed  than by extracts from the sermons of their leaders at this critical  period.    Sunday morning, September 16, 1857, Brigham Young, in his public  discourse, said:--         \"This people are free; they are not in bondage to any       government on God's footstool. We have transgressed no law,       and we have no occasion to do so, neither do we intend; but as       for any nation's coming to destroy this people, God Almighty       being my helper, they cannot come here. [The congregation       responded a loud 'Amen.'] . . .         \"We have borne enough of their oppression and hellish abuse,       and we will not bear any more of it, for there is no just law       requiring further forbearance on our part. And I am not going       to have troops here to protect the priests and hellish rabble       in efforts to drive us from the land we possess; for the Lord       does not want us to be driven, and has said, 'If you will       assert your rights, and keep my commandments, you shall never       again be brought into bondage by your enemies.' . . .         \"They say that their army is legal; and I say that such a       statement is as false as hell, and that they are as rotten as       an old pumpkin that has been frozen seven times, and then       melted in a harvest sun. Come on with your thousands of       illegally ordered troops, and I will promise you, in the name       of Israel's God, that you shall melt away as the snow before a       July sun. . . .         \"You might as well tell me that you can make hell into a       powder-house, as to tell me that you could let an army in       here, and have peace; and I intend to tell them, and show them       this, if they do not stay away. . . . And I say our enemies       shall not slip the bow on old 'Bright's neck' again. God bless       you. Amen.\"    In the afternoon of the same day, the \"lion\" again roars, as follows:--         \"There cannot be a more damnable, dastardly order issued, than       was issued by the Administration to this people, while they       were in an Indian country in 1846. Before we left Nauvoo, not       less than two United States Senators came to receive a pledge       from us that we would leave the United States; and then, while       we were doing our best to leave their borders, the poor, low,       degraded curses sent a requisition for five hundred men to go       and fight their battles! That was President Polk; and he is       now weltering in hell, with old Zachary Taylor, where the       present Administration will soon be, if they do not repent.         \"Liars have reported that this people have committed treason,       and upon their lies the President has ordered out troops to       aid in officering this Territory; and if those officers are       like many who have previously been sent here,--and we have       reason to believe that they are, or they would not come where       they know they are not wanted,--they are poor, miserable       blacklegs, broken down political hacks, robbers and       whoremongers; men that are not fit for civilized society; so       they must dragoon them upon us for officers. I feel that I       won't bear such cursed treatment, and that is enough to       say,--for we are just as free as the mountain air. . .         \"I have told you that if this people will live their religion,       all will be well; and I have told you that if there is any man       or woman who is not willing to destroy anything or everything       of their property that would be of use to an enemy if left, I       wanted them to go out of the Territory. And I again say so       to-day; for when the time comes to burn and lay waste our       improvements, if any man undertakes to shield his, he will be       sheared down; for 'judgment will be laid to the line, and       righteousness to the plummet.'         \"Now, the faint-hearted can go in peace; but should that time       come, they must not interfere. Before I will suffer what I       have in times gone by, there shall not be one building, nor       one foot of lumber, nor a stick, nor a tree, nor a particle of       grass or hay that will burn, left in reach of our enemies. I       am sworn, if driven to extremity, to utterly lay waste, in the       name of Israel's God.\"    On the same subject, Heber C. Kimball, first counsellor to Brigham, used  the following language:--         \"Is there a collision between us and the United States? No; we       have not collashed; that is the word that sounds nearest to       what I mean. But now the thread is cut between them and us,       and we will never gybe again,--no, never, worlds without end.       [Voices, 'Amen.'] . . .         \"Do as you are told, and Brigham Young will never leave the       governorship of this Territory, from this time henceforth and       forever. No, never. And there shall no wicked Judge with his       w---- ever sit in our courts again; for all who are against       Israel are an abomination to me and to our God.         \"The spirit that is upon me this morning is the Spirit of the       Lord, that is, the Holy Ghost,--though some of you may think       that the Holy Ghost is never cheerful. Well, let me tell you,       the Holy Ghost is a man; he is one of the sons of our Father       and our God, and he is that man that stood next to Jesus       Christ,--just as I stand by brother Brigham. . . . You think       our Father and our God is not a lively, sociable, and cheerful       man; he is one of the most lively men that ever lived. . . .       Brother Brigham is my leader, he is my Prophet and my Seer, my       Revelator; and whatever he says, that is for me to do, and it       is not for me to question him one word, nor to question God a       minute.\"[49:A]    Many sermons were delivered, composed, throughout, of such material as  the foregoing extracts. The genius of Mormonism is here fully  displayed,--implicit obedience to their leaders, and especially to the  teachings of Brigham Young. The people were commanded to be ready to  leave their homes at an hour's notice, and flee to the mountains,--and  this too, as the snows of winter were falling around them. They were  commanded to have the torch ready to set fire to their dwellings, and  the axe to cut down all their fruit-trees; and they were ready to obey!  The question naturally presents itself, Can blind faith and fanaticism  thus lead and control a whole community? That some should be thus  blindly infatuated, is not strange; but that a whole community should  thus lose their reason, and be willing to beggar themselves and  families, in obedience to the call of their leader, is almost beyond  belief.    It is safe to say, had the Mormons been left free to choose, at least  one half would have remained at home, and even welcomed the troops into  the city.    But the fiat of despotism had gone forth. \"When the time comes to burn  and lay waste our improvements, if any man undertakes to shield his, he  will be sheared down; for 'judgment will be laid to the line, and  righteousness to the plummet.'\" This means, in plain English, that any  man who refused to obey Young should be put to death; and the people  well understood it. As it was certain death to resist his will, they  vied with each other in seeming to render a willing obedience to a  tyrant whom many hated, and all feared.    They fortified Echo Canyon, a narrow pass, about eighteen miles in  length, eastward from the city. Piles of huge stones were heaped up  along the borders of the precipices, ready to be dashed against the  troops, as they should essay to pass the gorge. Intrenchments were  thrown up, and such other warlike preparations made as their facilities  afforded.    The United States troops had entered the Territory of Utah, and were  encamped in Green River County, near Fort Bridger, a distance of 118  miles from Salt Lake City. From this place Governor Cumming issued the  following proclamation:--         \"GREEN RIVER COUNTY, near Fort Bridger,   }         UTAH TERRITORY, 21st November, 1857.    }         \"_To the People of Utah Territory_:--         \"On the 11th day of July, 1857, the President appointed me to       preside over the executive department of the government of       this Territory. I arrived at this point on the 17th of this       month, and shall probably be detained some time, in       consequence of the loss of animals during the recent       snow-storm. I will proceed at this point to make the       preliminary arrangements for the temporary organization of the       territorial government. Many treasonable acts of violence have       recently been committed by lawless individuals, supposed to       have been commanded by the late executive. Such persons are in       a state of rebellion.         \"Proceedings will be instituted against them in a court       organized by Chief Justice Eckels, held in this county, which       court will supersede the necessity of appointing military       commissions for the trial of such offenders.         \"It is my duty to enforce unconditional obedience to the       Constitution, and the organic law of this Territory, and to       all the other laws of Congress applicable to you.         \"To enable me to effect this object, I will, in the event of       resistance, rely first upon a _posse comitatus_ of the       well-disposed portion of the inhabitants of this Territory,       and will only resort to a military _posse_ in case"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/446"],[0,"A Book of Remarkable Criminals (#12)"],[1,"with Peace than she was ready to admit, and that Dyson had been shot  by Peace in the course of a struggle, in which the former had been the  aggressor.    In the first part of his task Mr. Clegg met with some success. Mrs.  Dyson, whose memory was certainly eccentric--she could not, she said,  remember the year in which she had been married--was obliged to admit  that she had been in the habit of going to Peace's house, that she had  been alone with him to public-houses and places of entertainment, and  that she and Peace had been photographed together during the summer fair  at Sheffield. She could not \"to her knowledge\" recollect having told the  landlord of a public-house to charge her drink to Peace.    A great deal of Mrs. Dyson's cross-examination turned on a bundle of  letters that had been found near the scene of Dyson's murder on the  morning following the crime. These letters consisted for the most part  of notes, written in pencil on scraps of paper, purporting to have been  sent from Mrs. Dyson to Peace. In many of them she asks for money to get  drink, others refer to opportunities for their meetings in the absence  of Dyson; there are kind messages to members of Peace's family, his wife  and daughter, and urgent directions to Peace to hold his tongue and not  give ground for suspicion as to their relations. This bundle of letters  contained also the card which Dyson had thrown into Peace's garden  requesting him not to interfere with his family. According to the theory  of the defence, these letters had been written by Mrs. Dyson to Peace,  and went to prove the intimacy of their relations. At the inquest after  her husband's murder, Mrs. Dyson had been questioned by the coroner  about these letters. She denied that she had ever written to Peace; in  fact, she said, she \"never did write.\" It was stated that Dyson himself  had seen the letters, and declared them to be forgeries written by Peace  or members of his family for the purpose of annoyance. Nevertheless,  before the Sheffield magistrate Mr. Clegg thought it his duty to  cross-examine Mrs. Dyson closely as to their authorship. He asked her  to write out a passage from one of them: \"You can give me something as a  keepsake if you like, but I don't like to be covetous, and to take them  from your wife and daughter. Love to all!\" Mrs. Dyson refused to admit  any likeness between what she had written and the handwriting of the  letter in question. Another passage ran: \"Will see you as soon as I  possibly can. I think it would be easier after you move; he won't watch  so. The r--g fits the little finger. Many thanks and love to--Jennie  (Peace's daughter Jane). I will tell you what I thought of when I see  you about arranging matters. Excuse this scribbling.\" In answer to Mr.  Clegg, Mrs. Dyson admitted that Peace had given her a ring, which she  had worn for a short time on her little finger.    Another letter ran: \"If you have a note for me, send now whilst he is  out; but you must not venture, for he is watching, and you cannot be too  careful. Hope your foot is better. I went to Sheffield yesterday, but  I could not see you anywhere. Were you out? Love to Jane.\" Mrs. Dyson  denied that she had known of an accident which Peace had had to his foot  at this time. In spite of the ruling of the magistrate that Mr.  Clegg had put forward quite enough, if true, to damage Mrs. Dyson's  credibility, he continued to press her as to her authorship of these  notes and letters, but Mrs. Dyson was firm in her repudiation of  them. She was equally firm in denying that anything in the nature of a  struggle had taken place between Peace and her husband previous to his  murder.    At the conclusion of Mrs. Dyson's evidence the prisoner was committed to  take his trial at the Leeds Assizes, which commenced the week following.  Peace, who had groaned and moaned and constantly interrupted the  proceedings, protested his innocence, and complained that his witnesses  had not been called. The apprehension with which this daring malefactor  was regarded by the authorities is shown by this clandestine hearing  of his case in a cold corridor of the Town Hall, and the rapidity with  which his trial followed on his committal. There is an appearance almost  of precipitation in the haste with which Peace was bustled to his doom.  After his committal he was taken to Wakefield Prison, and a few days  later to Armley Jail, there to await his trial.    This began on February 4, and lasted one day. Mr. Justice Lopes, who had  tried vainly to persuade the Manchester Grand Jury to throw out the  bill in the case of the brothers Habron, was the presiding judge. Mr.  Campbell Foster, Q.C., led for the prosecution. Peace was defended by  Mr. Frank Lockwood, then rising into that popular success at the bar  which some fifteen years later made him Solicitor-General, and but for  his premature death would have raised him to even higher honours in his  profession.    In addressing the jury, both Mr. Campbell Foster and Mr. Lockwood took  occasion to protest against the recklessness with which the press of  the day, both high and low, had circulated stories and rumours about  the interesting convict. As early as November in 1878 one leading London  daily newspaper had said that \"it was now established beyond doubt that  the burglar captured by Police Constable Robinson was one and the same  as the Banner Cross murderer.\" Since then, as the public excitement grew  and the facts of Peace's extraordinary career came to light, the press  had responded loyally to the demands of the greedy lovers of sensation,  and piled fiction on fact with generous profusion. \"Never,\" said Mr.  Lockwood, \"in the whole course of his experience--and he defied any  of his learned friends to quote an experience--had there been such an  attempt made on the part of those who should be most careful of all  others to preserve the liberties of their fellowmen and to preserve the  dignity of the tribunals of justice to determine the guilt of a man.\"  Peace exclaimed \"Hear, hear!\" as Mr. Lockwood went on to say that \"for  the sake of snatching paltry pence from the public, these persons had  wickedly sought to prejudice the prisoner's life.\" Allowing for Mr.  Lockwood's zeal as an advocate, there can be no question that, had  Peace chosen or been in a position to take proceedings, more than one  newspaper had at this time laid itself open to prosecution for contempt  of Court. The Times was not far wrong in saying that, since Muller  murdered Mr. Briggs on the North London Railway and the poisonings of  William Palmer, no criminal case had created such excitement as that of  Charles Peace. The fact that property seemed to be no more sacred to him  than life aggravated in a singular degree the resentment of a commercial  people.    The first witness called by the prosecution was Mrs. Dyson. She  described how on the night of November 29, 1876, she had come out of  the outhouse in the yard at the back of her house, and found herself  confronted by Peace holding a revolver; how he said: \"Speak, or I'll  fire!\" and the sequence of events already related up to the moment when  Dyson fell, shot in the temple.    Mr. Lockwood commenced his cross-examination of Mrs. Dyson by  endeavouring to get from her an admission; the most important to the  defence, that Dyson had caught hold of Peace after the first shot had  been fired, and that in the struggle which ensued, the revolver had gone  off by accident. But he was not very successful. He put it to Mrs. Dyson  that before the magistrate at Sheffield she had said: \"I can't say  my husband did not get hold of the prisoner.\" \"Put in the little  word 'try,' please,\" answered Mrs. Dyson. In spite of Mr. Lockwood's  questions, she maintained that, though her husband may have attempted to  get hold of Peace, he did not succeed in doing so. As she was the only  witness to the shooting there was no one to contradict her statement.    Mr. Lockwood fared better when he came to deal with the relations of  Mrs. Dyson with Peace previous to the crime. Mrs. Dyson admitted that  in the spring of 1876 her husband had objected to her friendship with  Peace, and that nevertheless, in the following summer, she and Peace  had been photographed together at the Sheffield fair. She made a vain  attempt to escape from such an admission by trying to shift the occasion  of the summer fair to the previous year, 1875, but Mr. Lockwood put  it to her that she had not come to Darnall, where she first met Peace,  until the end of that year. Finally he drove her to say that she could  not remember when she came to Darnall, whether in 1873, 1874, 1875, or  1876. She admitted that she had accepted a ring from Peace, but could  not remember whether she had shown it to her husband. She had been  perhaps twice with Peace to the Marquis of Waterford public-house, and  once to the Star Music Hall. She could not swear one way or the other  whether she had charged to Peace's account drink consumed by her at an  inn in Darnall called the Half-way House. Confronted with a little girl  and a man, whom Mr. Lockwood suggested she had employed to carry notes  to Peace, Mrs. Dyson said that these were merely receipts for pictures  which he had framed for her. On the day before her husband's murder,  Mrs. Dyson was at the Stag Hotel at Sharrow with a little boy belonging  to a neighbour. A man followed her in and sat beside her, and afterwards  followed her out. In answer to Mr. Lockwood, Mrs. Dyson would \"almost  swear\" the man was not Peace; he had spoken to her, but she could not  remember whether she had spoken to him or not. She denied that this man  had said to her that he would come and see her the next night. As  the result of a parting shot Mr. Lockwood obtained from Mrs. Dyson a  reluctant admission that she had been \"slightly inebriated\" at the  Half-way House in Darnall, but had not to her knowledge been"]]]
