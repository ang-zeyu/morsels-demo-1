It is a rather shabby, poorly  made affair which very lively tanager youngster might easily tumble  apart. _\"Chip--churr\"_ calls the gorgeous father from the tree top,  and a reassuring reply that all is well with the nest floats up to him  from his mate. He does not often risk its safety by showing himself  near the nest, securely hidden by the foliage below. If, toward the  end of May, you hear him singing his real song, which is somewhat like  an oriole's mellow, cheery carol, you may be sure he is planning to  spend the summer in your neighbourhood. Not many miles from New York  there is a house built on the top of a hill, whose sides are covered  with oak and chestnut woods, where one may be sure to see tanagers  among the tree tops from any window at any hour of any day from May to  October. Several nests in those woods are saddled on to the horizontal  {89} limbs of the white oak. Not many people are blessed with such  beautiful, interesting neighbours.    In the Southern States, one of the most familiar birds in the orange  groves, orchards, and woods of pine and oak, is the summer tanager,  another smooth-headed redbird, but without a black feather on him. He  is fire red all over. Of the three hundred and fifty species of  tanagers in the tropics, only two think it worth while to visit the  Eastern United States and one of these frequently suffers because he  starts too early. Suppose all should suddenly decide to come north  some spring and spend the summer with us! Our woods would be filled  with some of the most brilliant and gorgeous birds in the world. Don't  you wish all the members of the family were as adventurous as the  scarlet tanager?    {90}    CHAPTER VII    THE SWALLOWS      Purple Martin    Barn Swallow    Cliff Swallow    Bank Swallow    Tree Swallow    {91}    {92}    {93}    THE SWALLOWS    If you were a bird, could you think of any way of earning a living  more delightful than sailing about in the air all day, playing  cross-tag on the wing with your companions, skimming low across the  meadows, ponds and marshes, or rising high above them and darting  hither and thither wherever you pleased, without knowing what it means  to feel tired? Swallows are as much in their element when in the air  as fish are in water; but don't imagine they are there simply for fun.  Their long, blade-like wings, which cut the air with such easy, but  powerful strokes, propel them enormous distances before they have  collected enough mosquitoes, gnats and other little gauzy-winged  insects to supply such great energy and satisfy their hunger. With  mouth widely gaping, leaving an opening in the front of their broad  heads that stretches from ear to ear, they get a tremendous draught  down their little throats, but they gather in a dinner piece-meal just  as the chimney swift, whip-poor-will and night-hawk do. Viscid saliva  in the bird's mouth glues the little victims as fast as if they were  caught on sticky fly-paper; then, when {94} enough have been trapped  to make a pellet, the swallow swallows them in a ball, although one  swallow does not make a dinner, any more than one swallow makes a  summer.    These sociable birds delight to live in companies, even during the  nesting season when most feathered couples, however glad to flock at  other times, prefer to be alone. As soon as the young birds can take  wing, one family party unites with another, one colony with another,  until often enormous numbers assemble in the marshes in August and  September. You see them strung like beads along the telegraph wires,  perched on the fences, circling over the meadows and ponds, zigzagging  across the sky. Millions of swallows have been noted in some of these  autumnal flocks. Usually they go to sleep among the reeds and grasses  in a favourite marsh where the bands return year after year; but some  prefer trees. Comparatively little perching is done except at night,  for swallows' feet are very small and weak.    At sunrise, the birds scatter in small bands to pick up on the wing  the long continued meal, which lasts till late in the afternoon. Those  who have gone too far abroad and must travel back to the roost after  sundown shoot across the sky with incredible swiftness lest darkness  overtake them. Relying upon their speed of flight to carry them beyond  the reach of {95} enemies, they migrate boldly by daylight instead of  at night as the timid little vireos and warblers do. During every day  the swallows are with us they must consume billions and trillions of  blood-sucking insects that would pester other animals beside  ourselves. Think of the mosquito bites alone that they prevent! Every  one of us is greatly in their debt.    Male and female swallows are dressed so nearly alike that you can  scarcely tell one from the other. Both twitter merrily but neither  really sings.      THE PURPLE MARTIN    There is a picturesque old inn beside a post road in New Jersey with a  five-storied martin house set up on a pole above its quaint swinging  sign. For over thirty years a record was kept on the pole showing the  dates of the coming and going of the martins in April and September,  which did not vary by more than two or three days during all that  time. The inn-keeper locked up in his safe every night the registers  on which were entered the arrivals and departures of his human guests,  but he valued far more the record of his bird visitors which  interested everybody who stopped at his inn.    {96}    One day, while he was away, a man who was painting a fence for him  thought he would surprise him by freshening up the old, weather-beaten  pole. Alas! He painted over every precious mark. You may be sure the  surprise recoiled upon him like a boomerang when the wrathful  inn-keeper returned. However, the martins continue to come back to  their old home year after year and rear their broods on little heaps  of leaves in every room in the house, which is the cheerful fact of  the story.    These glossy, blue-black iridescent swallows, grayish white  underneath, the largest of their graceful tribe, have always been  great favourites. Even the Indians in the Southern States used to hang  gourds for them to nest in about their camps--a practice continued by  the Negroes around their cabins to this day. Strangely enough these  birds which nested and slept in hollow trees before the coming of the  white men, were among the first to take advantage of his presence.  Now, in the Eastern United States, at least, the pampered darlings of  luxury positively refuse to live where people do not put up houses for  their comfort. In the sparsely settled West, however, they still  condescend to live in trees, but only when they must, like the  chimney-swifts, who, by the way are no relation. Plenty of people  persist in calling them chimney swallows, which is precisely what they  are not. Not even the little house wren has adapted itself so quickly  to civilised men's homes, as the swift and purple martin.      [Illustration]    Young barn swallows cradled under the rafters.    [Illustration]    Baby barn swallows learning to walk a plank.      {97}    Intelligent people, who are only just beginning to realise what birds  do for us and how very much more they might be induced to do, are  putting up boxes for the martins, not only near their own houses, that  the birds may rid the air of mosquitoes, but in their gardens and  orchards that incalculable numbers of injurious pests in the winged  stage may be destroyed. When martins return to us in spring from  Central and South America, where they have passed the winter, insects  are just beginning to fly, and if they can be captured then, before  they have a chance to lay their eggs, you see how much trouble and  money are saved for the farmers by their tireless allies, the  swallows. Unfortunately, purple martins are not so common at the North  as they were before the coming of those saucy little immigrants, the  English sparrows, who take possession, by fair means or by foul, of  every house that they can find. In the South, where the martins are  still very numerous, a peach grower I know has set up in his orchard  rows of poles, with a house on each, either for them or for bluebirds.  He says these bird partners are of inestimable value in keeping his  fruit trees free from insects.    {98}    The curculio, one of the worst enemies every fruit grower has to  fight, destroying as it does millions of dollars worth of crops every  year, is practically unknown in that Georgia planter's orchard. Some  day farmers all over the United States will wake up and copy his good  idea.    A colony of martins circling about a house give it a delightful  home-like air. Their very soft, sweet conversation with one another as  they fly, sounds like rippling, musical laughter.      THE BARN SWALLOW    Do you know where there is an old-fashioned, weather-worn barn, with  its hospitable doors standing open, where you could not find at least  one pair of barn swallows at home beneath its roof? These birds, you  will notice, prefer dilapidated old farm buildings, whose doors are  off their hinges, and whose loose shingles or broken clapboards offer  plenty of entrances and exits. If you like to play around a barn as  well as every child I know, you must be already acquainted with the  exquisite, dark steel-blue swallows with glistening reddish buff  breasts, and deeply forked tails, that dart and glide in and out of  the openings, merrily twittering as they fly. While you tumble about  in the {99} hay among the rafters the swallows go and come, so that,  quite unconsciously, you will associate them with happy hours as long  as you live.    High up on some beam, too high for the children to reach, let us hope,  a pair of barn swallows will plaster their mud cradle. Did you ever  see them gathering pellets of wet soil in their bills at some roadside  puddle? It is,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38253"],[0,"A Description of the Coasts of East Africa and Malabar in the Beginning of the (#12)"],[1," in the battle, and with their tusks wound the men and horses so  severely, that in a very short time they put any array into  confusion. But they are so timid, and subject to pain when wounded,  that they take to flight at once, and put one another into  confusion, and rout their own side. This king has four or five  hundred of these at his residence, very large and fine. They buy  them for one thousand five hundred ducats each, at the seaports  where the Malabars bring them for sale. And they make war much with  the horses bred in the country, for it has a wonderful quantity; and  the Moors and Gentiles of this kingdom are bold riders, ride small  saddles,[127] and use whips. They carry very thick round shields,  edged with silk, and two swords each man, a dagger, and a Turkish  bow, with very good arrows; and some carry steel maces, and many of  them coats of mail, and others tunics quilted with cotton. And the  horses have housings and steel head pieces, and so they fight very  well and are light in their movements; and they are so supple in  their saddles that they can play on horseback at the choga[128] or  at any other game. They have amongst them the game of the jerid, as  in Spain. These Moors are white, and of many countries: both Turks  and Mamelukes, Arabs, Persians, Khorasanys, Turkomans, and from the  great kingdom of Dily, and others born in the country itself. These  people come together there on account of the country being very  rich, and well supplied; and the king gives good pay and rations,  and regularly paid. These people are very well dressed, with very  rich stuffs of gold, silk, cotton, and goats' wool, and all wear  caps on their heads, and their clothes long, such as morisco shirts  and drawers, and leggings to the knee of good thick leather, worked  with gold knots and embroidery; and their swords are borne in their  girdles, or in the hands of their pages. They are richly ornamented  with gold and silver. Their women are very white and pretty, also  very richly decked out. They may marry as many as they like and are  able to maintain, to honour the sect of Mahomed; and so there are  many of them who have three or four or five wives, and of all of  them they have sons and daughters. And these Moors of Cambay speak  many languages, that is to say, Arabic, Persian, Turkish,[129] and  Guzaraty. They eat wheaten bread, rice, meat of all kinds, leaving  aside pork, which is against their law. They are luxurious people,  who live well and spend much money. They always go with their heads  shaved, and the women with very fine hair. When they go out of their  houses, they go on horses, or in cars, and so covered up that nobody  can see them. They are very jealous men, and can unmarry themselves  when they please, on paying to the wife a certain sum of money  (which is promised when they marry them), if at any time they repent  of it; and the women have also the same liberty.    This King of Cambay has been king since a short time only, and his  father was called Sultan Mahomed, who was brought up from a child  and nourished with poison, for his father desired that he should so  be brought up in order that it should not be possible to kill him  with poison; for the Moorish kings of these parts often have one  another killed by poison. And this king began to eat it in such a  small quantity that it could not do him any harm, and from that he  went on increasing this kind of food in such manner that he could  eat a great quantity of it; for which cause he became so poisonous  that if a fly settled on his hand it swelled and immediately fell  dead. And many wives with whom he slept died at once of his poison,  which he was unable to leave off eating, for he feared if he did not  use it, to die soon after; as we see by experience with the opium  which the Indians eat, for if they leave off eating it they die  immediately, that is, if they begin as children to eat it in such a  small quantity that it can do them no harm, for some length of time,  and then increasing the quantity by degrees until they remain  accustomed to it. This anfion is cold in the fourth degree, and on  account of being so cold it kills. We call it opio, and the women of  India when they wish to kill themselves in any case of dishonour or  of despair, eat it with oil of sesame, and so die sleeping without  feeling death.      CITY OF CHAMPAVER.[130]    This King possesses great cities in his kingdom, and especially the  city of Champaver, where he resides continually, with all his court.  This city is to the north of Guzerat, eighty leagues inland. It is a  very fertile country: of abundant provisions, wheat, barley, millet,  rice, peas and other vegetables, and many cows, sheep, goats, and  plenty of fruit, so that it is very full of all things; and it has  in its neighbourhood many hunting grounds, and deer and other  animals, and winged game. And this country possesses dogs and  falcons for the chase, and tame leopards for hunting all sorts of  game. And the King for his pastime keeps many animals of all kinds,  which they send to find and bring up. This King sent a Ganda[131] to  the King of Portugal, because they told him that he would be pleased  to see her.      ANDAVAT.    Leaving this city and going further inland there is another city  called Andavat, which is larger than the said city of Champaver, and  it is very rich, and well supplied. The former kings used always to  reside in this city. These towns are walled, and embellished with  good streets and squares, and houses of stone and whitewash, with  roofs in our fashion; and they have large courts, and much water in  wells and pools. They make use of horses, donkeys, mules, camels and  carts, and have fine rivers, with plenty of fresh water fish, and  many orchards and gardens. There are also in this kingdom, inland,  many cities, towns and villages, in which the king keeps his  governors and collectors of his revenue. If these commit a fault he  summons them, and after having heard them he bids them drink a cup  of poison, with which anyone dies immediately; and in this way he  chastises them, so that they are in great fear of him.      PATEMXI.    The places which this king has on the sea coast are these. Firstly,  leaving the kingdom of Ulcinde for India at a distance of  thirty-seven leagues, is a river, on the shore of which there is a  great city called Patemxi, a good seaport, very rich, and of great  trade. In this city many silk stuffs are made, coloured with much  embroidery, which are used over the whole of India, Malacca, Bengal,  and also many cotton stuffs. To this port come many Indian ships  laden with cocoa nuts, sugar of palms which they call xagara[132],  and from there they carry away a great quantity of cloth and much  cotton, horses, wheat, and vegetables, by which much money is made.  Their voyage, with the delays, is of four months.      SURATIMANGALOR.    Passing by this city, further on the coast to the east and south, at  fifteen leagues distance, there is another town of commerce, which  has a very good port, and is called Suratimangalor, where also many  ships from Malabar touch, for horses, wheat, rice, cotton cloths,  vegetables and other goods which are of use in India. And they bring  cocoa nuts, hurraca[133] (which is something to drink), emery,  beeswax, cardamums, and all sorts of spices, in which trade and  voyage great profit is made in a short time.      DUY.    Fifty leagues further along the coast, towards the south, there is a  promontory, and joining close to it is a small island, which  contains a very large and fine town, which the Malabars call  Diuixa[134], and the Moors of the country call it Diu. It has a very  good harbour, and is a port of much trade in merchandise, and of  much shipping from Malabar, Baticala, Goa Dabul and Cheul; and the  people of Diu sail to Aden, Mekkah, Zeyla, Barbara, Magadoxo, Brava,  Melinde, Mombaza, Xer[135], Ormuz, and all parts of the kingdom. And  the Malabars bring hither rice, cocoa nuts, jagara, wax, emery,  iron, and sugar from Baticala, and all the spices that can be got in  India and Malacca; and from Chaul and Dabul they bring a large  quantity of cotton stuffs, which they call _beyranies_, and caps for  women, which are carried from this place to Arabia and Persia. And  they load at this port for the return voyage cotton cloths of the  country and silk stuffs, horses, wheat, vegetables, sesame, cotton,  oil of sesame, and opium, both that which comes there from Aden, and  that which is made in the kingdom of Cambay, which is not so fine as  that of Aden; and they export many coarse camlets and silk stuffs  made in this kingdom of Cambay, and thick carpets,[136] taffeta,  scarlet cloth, and of other colours. They also export the spices and  things brought to them from India, by the people of the country, to  Aden, Ormuz, and all parts of Arabia and Persia, so that this town  is the chief emporium of trade which exists in all these parts. This  town gives such a large sum of money as revenue to the king, for the  loading and unloading of such rich goods, that it is a subject of  marvel and amazement; for they also bring to it from Mekkah much  coral, copper, quicksilver, vermillion, lead, alum, madder,  rose-water, saffron, and much gold and silver coined and uncoined.  The king keeps a Moorish governor in this place called Melquiaz; an  old man, and a very good gentleman, discreet, industrious, and of  great information, who lives with great order and regularity in all  his affairs. He makes much artillery, and has many rowing barges,  very well arranged, small and very light, which are called  Talayas.[137] He has had constructed in the port a very strong and  fine bulwark, in which he has very good artillery, with many  lombards,[138] and he always keeps with him many men-at-arms, to  whom he pays very good appointments. They are very well armed. He is  always on his"]]]
