Or do you mean that there  is an absolute rule that the Antecedent non-existence of consciousness,  if proved, must be contemporaneous with consciousness? Have you then, we  ask, ever observed this so as to be able to assert an absolute rule? And  if it were observed, that would prove the existence of previous  non-existence, not its negation!--The fact, however, is that no person  in his senses will maintain the contemporaneous existence of  consciousness and its own antecedent non-existence. In the case of  perceptive knowledge originating from sensation, there is indeed this  limitation, that it causes the apprehension of such things only as are  actually present at the same time. But this limitation does not extend  to cognitions of all kinds, nor to all instruments of knowledge; for we  observe that remembrance, inference, and the magical perception of Yogis  apprehend such things also as are not present at the time of  apprehension. On this very point there rests the relation connecting the  means of knowledge with their objects, viz. that the former are not  without the latter. This does not mean that the instrument of knowledge  is connected with its object in that way that it is not without  something that is present at the time of cognition; but rather that the  instrument of knowledge is opposed to the falsehood of that special form  in which the object presents itself as connected with some place and  time.--This disposes also of the contention that remembrance has no  external object; for it is observed that remembrance is related to such  things also as have perished.--Possibly you will now argue as follows.  The antecedent non-existence of consciousness cannot be ascertained by  perception, for it is not something present at the time of perception.  It further cannot be ascertained by the other means of knowledge, since  there is no characteristic mark (linga) on which an inference could be  based: for we do not observe any characteristic mark invariably  accompanied by the antecedent non-existence of consciousness. Nor do we  meet with any scriptural text referring to this antecedent  non-existence. Hence, in the absence of any valid instrument of  knowledge, the antecedent non-existence of consciousness cannot be  established at all.--If, we reply, you thus, altogether setting aside  the force of self-provedness (on which you had relied hitherto), take  your stand on the absence of valid means of knowledge, we again must  request you to give in; for there is a valid means of knowledge whereby  to prove the antecedent non-existence of consciousness, viz. valid  non-perception (anupalabdhi).    Moreover, we observe that perceptional knowledge proves its object, be  it a jar or something else, to exist only as long as it exists itself,  not at all times; we do not, through it, apprehend the antecedent or  subsequent existence of the jar. Now this absence of apprehension is due  to the fact that consciousness itself is limited in time. If that  consciousness which has a jar for its object were itself apprehended as  non-limited in time, the object also--the jar--would be apprehended  under the same form, i.e. it would be eternal. And if self-established  consciousness were eternal, it would be immediately cognised as eternal;  but this is not the case. Analogously, if inferential consciousness and  other forms of consciousness were apprehended as non-limited in time,  they would all of them reveal their objects also as non-limited, and  these objects would thus be eternal; for the objects are conform in  nature to their respective forms of consciousness.          There is no consciousness without object.    Nor is there any consciousness devoid of objects; for nothing of this  kind is ever known. Moreover, the self-luminousness of consciousness has,  by our opponent himself, been proved on the ground that its essential  nature consists in illumining (revealing) objects; the self-luminousness  of consciousness not admitting of proof apart from its essential nature  which consists in the lighting up of objects. And as moreover, according  to our opponent, consciousness cannot be the object of another  consciousness, it would follow that (having neither an object nor itself  being an object) it is something altogether unreal, imaginary.    Nor are you justified in maintaining that in deep sleep, swoon,  senselessness and similar states, pure consciousness, devoid of any  object, manifests itself. This view is negatived by 'valid  non-perception' (see above, p. 52). If consciousness were present in  those states also, there would be remembrance of it at the time of  waking from sleep or recovery from swoon; but as a matter of fact there  is no such remembrance.--But it is not an absolute rule that something  of which we were conscious must be remembered; how then can the absence  of remembrance prove the absence of previous consciousness?--Unless, we  reply, there be some cause of overpowering strength which quite  obliterates all impressions--as e.g. the dissolution of the body--the  absence of remembrance does necessarily prove the absence of previous  consciousness. And, moreover, in the present case the absence of  consciousness does not only follow from absence of remembrance; it is  also proved by the thought presenting itself to the person risen from  sleep, 'For so long a time I was not conscious of anything.'--Nor may it  be said that even if there was consciousness, absence of remembrance  would necessarily follow from the absence (during deep sleep) of the  distinction of objects, and from the extinction of the consciousness of  the 'I'; for the non-consciousness of some one thing, and the absence of  some one thing cannot be the cause of the non-remembrance of some other  thing, of which there had been consciousness. And that in the states in  question the consciousness of the 'I' does persist, will moreover be  shown further on.    But, our opponent urges, have you not said yourself that even in deep  sleep and similar states there is consciousness marked by difference?--  True, we have said so. But that consciousness is consciousness of the  Self, and that this is affected by difference will be proved further on.  At present we are only interested in denying the existence of your pure  consciousness, devoid of all objects and without a substrate. Nor can we  admit that your pure consciousness could constitute what we call the  consciousness of the Self; for we shall prove that the latter has a  substrate.    It thus cannot be maintained that the antecedent non-existence of  consciousness does not admit of being proved, because consciousness  itself does not prove it. And as we have shown that consciousness itself  may be an object of consciousness, we have thereby disproved the alleged  impossibility of antecedent non-existence being proved by other means.  Herewith falls the assertion that the non-origination of consciousness  can be proved.          Consciousness is capable of change.    Against the assertion that the alleged non-origination of consciousness  at the same time proves that consciousness is not capable of any other  changes (p. 36), we remark that the general proposition on which this  conclusion rests is too wide: it would extend to antecedent  non-existence itself, of which it is evident that it comes to an end,  although it does not originate. In qualifying the changes as changes of  'Being,' you manifest great logical acumen indeed! For according to your  own view Nescience also (which is not 'Being') does not originate, is  the substrate of manifold changes, and comes to an end through the rise  of knowledge! Perhaps you will say that the changes of Nescience are all  unreal. But, do you then, we ask in reply, admit that any change is  real? You do not; and yet it is only this admission which would give a  sense to the distinction expressed by the word 'Being' [FOOTNOTE 54:1].    Nor is it true that consciousness does not admit of any division within  itself, because it has no beginning (p. 36). For the non-originated Self  is divided from the body, the senses, &c., and Nescience also, which is  avowedly without a beginning, must needs be admitted to be divided from  the Self. And if you say that the latter division is unreal, we ask  whether you have ever observed a real division invariably connected with  origination! Moreover, if the distinction of Nescience from the Self is  not real, it follows that Nescience and the Self are essentially one.  You further have yourself proved the difference of views by means of the  difference of the objects of knowledge as established by non-refuted  knowledge; an analogous case being furnished by the difference of acts  of cleaving, which results from the difference of objects to be cleft.  And if you assert that of this knowing--which is essentially knowing  only--nothing that is an object of knowledge can be an attribute, and  that these objects--just because they are objects of knowledge--cannot  be attributes of knowing; we point out that both these remarks would  apply also to eternity, self-luminousness, and the other attributes of  'knowing', which are acknowledged by yourself, and established by valid  means of proof. Nor may you urge against this that all these alleged  attributes are in reality mere 'consciousness' or 'knowing'; for they  are essentially distinct. By 'being conscious' or 'knowing', we  understand the illumining or manifesting of some object to its own  substrate (i.e. the substrate of knowledge), by its own existence (i.e.  the existence of knowledge) merely; by self-luminousness (or  'self-illuminatedness') we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/73"],[0,"The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War (#12)"],[1,"near his shoulder.  Turning he saw that it belonged to the tattered soldier.  \"Ye'd better  take 'im outa th' road, pardner.  There's a batt'ry comin' helitywhoop  down th' road an' he 'll git runned over.  He 's a goner anyhow in  about five minutes--yeh kin see that.  Ye 'd better take 'im outa th'  road.  Where th' blazes does hi git his stren'th from?\"    \"Lord knows!\" cried the youth.  He was shaking his hands helplessly.    He ran forward presently and grasped the tall soldier by the arm.  \"Jim! Jim!\" he coaxed, \"come with me.\"    The tall soldier weakly tried to wrench himself free.  \"Huh,\" he said  vacantly.  He stared at the youth for a moment.  At last he spoke as if  dimly comprehending.  \"Oh!  Inteh th' fields?  Oh!\"    He started blindly through the grass.    The youth turned once to look at the lashing riders and jouncing guns  of the battery.  He was startled from this view by a shrill outcry from  the tattered man.    \"Gawd!  He's runnin'!\"    Turning his head swiftly, the youth saw his friend running in a  staggering and stumbling way toward a little clump of bushes.  His  heart seemed to wrench itself almost free from his body at this sight.  He made a noise of pain.  He and the tattered man began a pursuit.  There was a singular race.    When he overtook the tall soldier he began to plead with all the words  he could find.  \"Jim--Jim--what are you doing--what makes you do this  way--you'll hurt yerself.\"    The same purpose was in the tall soldier's face.  He protested in a  dulled way, keeping his eyes fastened on the mystic place of his  intentions.  \"No--no--don't tech me--leave me be--leave me be--\"    The youth, aghast and filled with wonder at the tall soldier, began  quaveringly to question him.  \"Where yeh goin', Jim?  What you thinking  about?  Where you going?  Tell me, won't you, Jim?\"    The tall soldier faced about as upon relentless pursuers.  In his eyes  there was a great appeal.  \"Leave me be, can't yeh?  Leave me be for a  minnit.\"    The youth recoiled.  \"Why, Jim,\" he said, in a dazed way, \"what 's the  matter with you?\"    The tall soldier turned and, lurching dangerously, went on.  The youth  and the tattered soldier followed, sneaking as if whipped, feeling  unable to face the stricken man if he should again confront them.  They  began to have thoughts of a solemn ceremony.  There was something  rite-like in these movements of the doomed soldier.  And there was a  resemblance in him to a devotee of a mad religion, blood-sucking,  muscle-wrenching, bone-crushing.  They were awed and afraid.  They hung  back lest he have at command a dreadful weapon.    At last, they saw him stop and stand motionless.  Hastening up, they  perceived that his face wore an expression telling that he had at last  found the place for which he had struggled.  His spare figure was  erect; his bloody hands were quietly at his side.  He was waiting with  patience for something that he had come to meet.  He was at the  rendezvous.  They paused and stood, expectant.    There was a silence.    Finally, the chest of the doomed soldier began to heave with a strained  motion.  It increased in violence until it was as if an animal was  within and was kicking and tumbling furiously to be free.    This spectacle of gradual strangulation made the youth writhe, and once  as his friend rolled his eyes, he saw something in them that made him  sink wailing to the ground.  He raised his voice in a last supreme call.    \"Jim--Jim--Jim--\"    The tall soldier opened his lips and spoke.  He made a gesture.  \"Leave  me be--don't tech me--leave me be--\"    There was another silence while he waited.    Suddenly his form stiffened and straightened.  Then it was shaken by a  prolonged ague.  He stared into space.  To the two watchers there was a  curious and profound dignity in the firm lines of his awful face.    He was invaded by a creeping strangeness that slowly enveloped him.  For a moment the tremor of his legs caused him to dance a sort of  hideous hornpipe.  His arms beat wildly about his head in expression of  implike enthusiasm.    His tall figure stretched itself to its full height.  There was a  slight rending sound.  Then it began to swing forward, slow and  straight, in the manner of a falling tree.  A swift muscular contortion  made the left shoulder strike the ground first.    The body seemed to bounce a little way from the earth.  \"God!\" said the  tattered soldier.    The youth had watched, spellbound, this ceremony at the place of  meeting.  His face had been twisted into an expression of every agony  he had imagined for his friend.    He now sprang to his feet and, going closer, gazed upon the pastelike  face.  The mouth was open and the teeth showed in a laugh.    As the flap of the blue jacket fell away from the body, he could see  that the side looked as if it had been chewed by wolves.    The youth turned, with sudden, livid rage, toward the battlefield.  He  shook his fist.  He seemed about to deliver a philippic.    \"Hell--\"    The red sun was pasted in the sky like a wafer.          Chapter 10      The tattered man stood musing.    \"Well, he was a reg'lar jim-dandy fer nerve, wa'n't he,\" said he  finally in a little awestruck voice.  \"A reg'lar jim-dandy.\" He  thoughtfully poked one of the docile hands with his foot.  \"I wonner  where he got 'is stren'th from?  I never seen a man do like that  before.  It was a funny thing.  Well, he was a reg'lar jim-dandy.\"    The youth desired to screech out his grief.  He was stabbed, but his  tongue lay dead in the tomb of his mouth.  He threw himself again upon  the ground and began to brood.    The tattered man stood musing.    \"Look-a-here, pardner,\" he said, after a time.  He regarded the corpse  as he spoke.  \"He 's up an' gone, ain't 'e, an' we might as well begin  t' look out fer ol' number one.  This here thing is all over.  He 's up  an' gone, ain't 'e?  An' he 's all right here.  Nobody won't bother  'im.  An' I must say I ain't enjoying any great health m'self these  days.\"    The youth, awakened by the tattered soldier's tone, looked quickly up.  He saw that he was swinging uncertainly on his legs and that his face  had turned to a shade of blue.    \"Good Lord!\" he cried, \"you ain't goin' t'--not you, too.\"    The tattered man waved his hand.  \"Nary die,\" he said.  \"All I want is  some pea soup an' a good bed.  Some pea soup,\" he repeated dreamfully.    The youth arose from the ground.  \"I wonder where he came from.  I left  him over there.\"  He pointed.  \"And now I find 'im here.  And he was  coming from over there, too.\"  He indicated a new direction.  They both  turned toward the body as if to ask of it a question.    \"Well,\" at length spoke the tattered man, \"there ain't no use in our  stayin' here an' tryin' t' ask him anything.\"    The youth nodded an assent wearily.  They both turned to gaze for a  moment at the corpse.    The youth murmured something.    \"Well, he was a jim-dandy, wa'n't 'e?\" said the tattered man as if in  response.    They turned their backs upon it and started away.  For a time they  stole softly, treading with their toes.  It remained laughing there in  the grass.    \"I'm commencin' t' feel pretty bad,\" said the tattered man, suddenly  breaking one of his little silences.  \"I'm commencin' t' feel pretty  damn' bad.\"    The youth groaned.  \"Oh Lord!\"  He wondered if he was to be the  tortured witness of another grim encounter.    But his companion waved his hand reassuringly.  \"Oh, I'm not goin' t'  die yit!  There too much dependin' on me fer me t' die yit.  No, sir!  Nary die!  I CAN'T!  Ye'd oughta see th' swad a' chil'ren I've got, an'  all like that.\"    The youth glancing at his companion could see by the shadow of a smile  that he was making some kind of fun.    As they plodded on the tattered soldier continued to talk.  \"Besides, if  I died, I wouldn't die th' way that feller did.  That was th' funniest  thing.  I'd jest flop down, I would.  I never seen a feller die th' way  that feller did.    \"Yeh know Tom Jamison, he lives next door t' me up home.  He's a nice  feller, he is, an' we was allus good friends.  Smart, too. Smart as a  steel trap.  Well, when we was a-fightin' this atternoon,  all-of-a-sudden he begin t' rip up an' cuss an' beller at me.  'Yer  shot, yeh blamed infernal!'--he swear horrible--he ses t' me.  I put up  m' hand t' m' head an' when I looked at m' fingers, I seen, sure  'nough, I was shot.  I give a holler an' begin t' run, but b'fore I  could git away another one hit me in th' arm an' whirl' me clean  'round.  I got skeared when they was all a-shootin' b'hind me an' I run  t' beat all, but I cotch it pretty bad.  I've an idee I'd a been  fightin' yit, if t'was n't fer Tom Jamison.\"    Then he made a calm announcement:  \"There's two of 'em--little  ones--but they 're beginnin' t' have fun with me now.  I don't b'lieve  I kin walk much furder.\"    They went slowly on in silence.  \"Yeh look pretty peek'ed yerself,\"  said the tattered man at last.  \"I bet yeh 've got a worser one than  yeh think.  Ye'd better take keer of yer hurt.  It don't do t' let sech  things go.  It might be inside mostly, an' them plays thunder.  Where  is it located?\"  But he continued his harangue without waiting for a  reply.  \"I see a feller git hit plum in th' head when my reg'ment was  a-standin' at ease onct.  An' everybody yelled to 'im:  'Hurt, John?  Are yeh hurt much?' 'No,' ses he.  He looked kinder surprised, an' he  went on tellin' 'em how he felt.  He sed he didn't feel nothin'.  But,  by dad, th' first thing that feller knowed he was dead.  Yes, he was  dead--stone dead.  So, yeh wanta watch out.  Yeh might have some queer  kind 'a hurt yerself.  Yeh can't never tell.  Where is your'n located?\"    The youth had been wriggling since the introduction of this topic.  He  now gave a cry of exasperation and made a furious motion with his hand.  \"Oh, don't bother me!\" he said.  He was enraged"]]]
