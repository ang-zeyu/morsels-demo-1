O Allah, grant us in  this World Weal, and in the future Weal, and save us from the torments  of Hell-fire! Praise to Thee, O Lord, Lord of Glory, greater than Man  can describe! and Peace be upon the Apostle, and Laud to Allah, the  Lord of the (three) Worlds. This concludes, as usual, with the  Testification and the Fatihah. Pious men on such an occasion go to the  Rauzah, where they strive, if possible, to shed a tear,a single drop  being a sign of acceptance,give alms to the utmost of their ability, vow  piety, repentance, and obedience, and retire overwhelmed with grief, at  separating themselves from their Prophet and Intercessor. It is  customary, too, before leaving Al-Madinah, to pass at least one night  in vigils at the Harim, and for learned men to read through the Koran  once before the tomb.    Then began the uncomfortable process of paying off little bills. The  Eastern creditor always, for divers reasons, waits the last moment  before he claims his debt. Shaykh Hamid had frequently hinted at his  difficulties; the only means of escape from which, he said, was to rely  upon Allah. He had treated me so hospitably, that I could not take back  any part of the £5 lent to him at Suez. His three brothers received a  dollar or two each, and one or two of his cousins hinted to some effect  that such a proceeding would meet with their approbation.    The luggage was then carried down, and disposed in packs upon the  ground before the house, so as to be ready for loading at a moments  notice. Many flying parties of travellers had almost started on the  high road, and late in the evening came a new report that the body of  the Caravan would march about midnight. We sat up till about two A.M.,  when, having heard no gun, and having seen no camels, we lay down to  sleep through the sultry remnant of the hours of darkness.    [p.57]Thus, gentle reader, was spent my last night at Al-Madinah.    I had reason to congratulate myself upon having passed through the  first danger. Meccah is so near the coast, that, in case of detection,  the traveller might escape in a few hours to Jeddah, where he would  find an English Vice-Consul, protection from the Turkish authorities,  and possibly a British cruiser in the harbour. But at Al-Madinah  discovery would entail more serious consequences. The next risk to be  run was the journey between the two cities, where it would be easy for  the local officials quietly to dispose of a suspected person by giving  a dollar to a Badawi.    [FN#1] The Tayyarah, or Flying Caravan, is lightly laden, and travels by  forced marches.  [FN#2] This Musafahah, as it is called, is the Arab fashion of shaking  hands. They apply the palms of the right hands flat to each other,  without squeezing the fingers, and then raise the hand to the forehead.  [FN#3] On this occasion I heard three new words: Kharitah, used to  signify a single trip to Meccah (without return to Al-Madinah), Taarifah,  going out from Meccah to Mount Arafat, and Tanzilah, return from Mount  Arafat to Meccah.  [FN#4] And part of an extra animal which was to carry water for the  party. Had we travelled by the Darb al-Sultani, we should have paid 6½  dollars, instead of 10, for each beast.  [FN#5] The system of advances, as well as earnest money, is common all  over Arabia. In some places, Aden for instance, I have heard of  two-thirds the price of a cargo of coffee being required from the  purchaser before the seller would undertake to furnish a single bale.  [FN#6] Most men of the Shafei school clip their mustachios exceedingly  short; some clean shave the upper lip, the imperial, and the parts of  the beard about the corners of the mouth, and the forepart of the  cheeks. I neglected so to do, which soon won for me the epithet  recorded above. Arabs are vastly given to nick-naming Gods creatures;  their habit is the effect of acute observation, and the want of variety  in proper names. Sonnini appears not to like having been called the  Father of a nose. But there is nothing disrespectful in these personal  allusions. In Arabia you must be father of something, and it is better to  be father of a feature, than father of a cooking pot, or father of a  strong smell (Abu-Zirt.)  [FN#7] Salt among the Hindus is considered the essence and preserver of  the seas; it was therefore used in their offerings to the gods. The old  idea in Europe was, that salt is a body composed of various elements,  into which it cannot be resolved by human means: hence, it became the  type of an indissoluble tie between individuals. Homer calls salt  sacred and divine, and whoever ate it with a stranger was supposed to  become his friend. By the Greek authors, as by the Arabs, hospitality  and salt are words expressing a kindred idea. When describing the  Badawin of Al-Hijaz, I shall have occasion to notice their peculiar  notions of the Salt-law.  [FN#8] The import of such articles shows the march of progress in  Al-Hijaz. During the last generation, schoolmasters used for pencils  bits of bar lead beaten to a point.  [FN#9] The two comforts are success and despair; the latter, according to  the Arabs, being a more enviable state of feeling than doubt or hope  deferred.    [p.58]CHAPTER XXIV.    FROM AL-MADINAH TO AL-SUWAYRKIYAH.    FOUR roads lead from Al-Madinah to Meccah. The []Darb al-Sultani, or  Sultans Highway, follows the line of coast: this general passage has been  minutely described by my exact predecessor. The Tarik al-Ghabir, a  mountain path, is avoided by the Mahmil and the great Caravans on  account of its rugged passes; water abounds along the whole line, but  there is not a single village and the Sobh Badawin, who own the soil[,]  are inveterate plunderers. The route called Wady al-Kura is a favourite  with Dromedary Caravans; on this road are two or three small  settlements, regular wells, and free passage through the Benu Amr  tribe. The Darb al-Sharki, or Eastern road, down which I travelled, owes  its existence to the piety of the Lady Zubaydah, wife of Harun  al-Rashid. That munificent princess dug wells from Baghdad to  Al-Madinah, and built, we are told, a wall to direct pilgrims over the  shifting sands.[FN#1] There is a fifth road, or rather mountain path,  concerning which I can give no information.    At eight A.M. on Wednesday, the 26th Zul Kaadah    [p.59] (31st August, 1853), as we were sitting at the window of Hamids  house after our early meal, suddenly appeared, in hottest haste, Masud,  our Camel-Shaykh. He was accompanied by his son, a bold boy about  fourteen years of age, who fought sturdily about the weight of each  package as it was thrown over the camels back; and his nephew, an ugly  pock-marked lad, too lazy even to quarrel. We were ordered to lose no  time in loading; all started into activity, and at nine A.M. I found  myself standing opposite the Egyptian Gate, surrounded by my friends,  who had accompanied me thus far on foot, to take leave with due honour.  After affectionate embraces and parting mementoes, we mounted, the boy  Mohammed and I in the litter, and Shaykh Nur in his cot. Then in  company with some Turks and Meccans, for Masud owned a string of nine  camels, we passed through the little gate near the castle, and shaped  our course towards the North. On our right lay the palm-groves, which  conceal this part of the city; far to the left rose the domes of Hamzahs  Mosques at the foot of Mount Ohod; and in front a band of road, crowded  with motley groups, stretched over a barren stony plain.    After an hours slow march, bending gradually from North to North-East,  we fell into the Nijd highway, and came to a place of renown called  Al-Ghadir, or the Basin.[FN#2] This is a depression conducting the  drainage of the plain towards the northern hills. The skirts of Ohod  still limited the prospect to the left. On the right was the Bir Rashid  (Well of Rashid), and the little whitewashed dome of Ali al-Urays, a  descendant from Zayn al-Abidin:the tomb is still a place of Visitation.  There we halted and turned to take farewell of the Holy City. All the    [p.60] pilgrims dismounted and gazed at the venerable minarets and the  Green Dome,spots upon which their memories would for ever dwell with a  fond and yearning interest.    Remounting at noon, we crossed a Fiumara which runs, according to my  Camel-Shaykh, from North to South; we were therefore emerging from the  Madinah basin. The sky began to be clouded, and although the air was  still full of Samu[m], cold draughts occasionally poured down from the  hills. Arabs fear this    bitter change  Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,    and call that a dangerous climate which is cold in the hot season and  hot in the cold. Travelling over a rough and stony path, dotted with  thorny Acacias, we arrived about two P.M. at the bed of lava heard of  by Burckhardt.[FN#3] The    [p.61] aspect of the country was volcanic, abounding in basalts and  scoriae, more or less porous: sand veiled the black bed whose present  dimensions by no means equal the descriptions of Arabian historians. I  made diligent enquiries about the existence of active volcanoes in this  part of Al-Hijaz, and heard of none.

O amazing love of this poor thief, love that cast out all  fear! He was indeed well drunken with that new wine which in the  wine-press of the Cross had been pressed out of that sweet cluster,  Jesus Christ, and therefore he confessed Christ without shame before  all the people. At the very beginning of the Passion, the apostles  and disciples had forsaken Christ and fled; even St Peter,  frightened by the voice of one maidservant, had denied Christ. But  this poor thief did not forsake Him even in death, but confessed Him  to be the Lord of heaven in the presence of all those armed men. Who  can do justice to the merits of this man? Who taught him so quickly  that faith of his, and his clear knowledge of all the virtues, save  the very Wisdom of the Father, Jesus Christ, who hung near him on  the Cross? Him whom the Jews could not or would not know, in spite  of the promises made to the patriarchs, the fulfilment of  prophecies, the teaching of the Scriptures, and the interpretation  of allegories, this poor thief learned to know by repentance. He  confessed Christ to be the Son of God, though he saw Him full of  misery, want, and torment, and dying from natural weakness. He  confessed Him at a time when the apostles, who had seen His mighty  works, denied Him. The nails were holding his hands and feet fixed  to the cross; he had nothing free about him, except his heart and  his tongue; yet he gave to God all that he could give to Him, and,  in the words of Scripture, \"with his heart he believed unto  righteousness, and with his tongue he made confession of Christ unto  salvation.\" O infinite and unsearchable mercy of God! For what  manner of man was he when he was sent to the cross, and what when he  left it? (Not that it was his own cross, that wrought this change,  but the power of Christ crucified.) He came to the cross stained  with the blood of his fellow-man; he was taken down from it cleansed  by the blood of Christ. He came to the cross still savage and full  of rage, and while he was upon it he became so meek and pitiful that  he lamented for the sufferings of another more than for his own. One  member only was left to him, and at the eleventh hour he came to  work in God's vineyard, and yet so eagerly did he labour that he was  the first to finish his work and receive his reward. Indeed he  behaved like a just man; for he first accused himself and confessed  his sins, saying, \"and we, indeed, justly, for we receive the due  reward of our deeds.\" Secondly, he excused Christ, and confessed  that He was the Just One when he said \"but this Man hath done  nothing amiss.\" Thirdly, he showed brotherly love, for he said,  \"dost not thou fear God?\" Fourthly, with all his members, or at  least with all that he could offer, and with loving eyes and a  devout heart and a humble spirit, he turned himself to Christ and  prayed earnestly, \"Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy  Kingdom.\" How great was the justice and humility and resignation  which he showed in this prayer, for he asked only for a little  remembrance of himself, acknowledging that he was not worthy to ask  for anything great. Nor did he pray for the safety of his body, for  he gladly desired to die for his sins. It was more pleasant for him  to die with Christ than to live any longer. Nor did he pray that our  Lord would deliver him from the pains of hell, or of purgatory, nor  did he ask for the kingdom of heaven; but he resigned himself  entirely to the will of God, and offered himself altogether to  Christ, to do what He would with him. In his humility he prayed for  nothing except for grace and mercy, for which David also prayed when  he said, \"Deal with Thy servant according to Thy mercy.\" And  therefore, because he had prayed humbly and wisely, the Eternal  Wisdom, Who reads the hearts of all who pray, heard his prayer, and,  opening wide the rich storehouse of His grace, bestowed upon him  much more than he had dared to ask. O marvellous goodness of God!  How plainly dost Thou declare in this, that Thou desirest not the  death of a sinner, but rather that he should be converted and live.  Now Thou hast manifested and fulfilled what Thou didst promise  aforetime by Thy prophet: \"When the wicked man shall mourn for his  sins, I will remember his iniquity no more.\" Thou didst not impose  upon him many years of severe penance, nor many sufferings in  purgatory for the expiation of his sins; but just as if Thou hadst  quite forgotten his crimes, and couldst see nothing in him but  virtue, Thou didst say: \"This day shalt thou be with Me in  paradise.\" O immeasurable compassion of God! Our tender Lord forgot  all the countless crimes which that poor thief had done, and forgave  him when he repented, and gave so great and splendid a reward to the  good which there was in him, small indeed though it was. Our loving  God is very rich; He needs not our gifts; but He seeks for a heart  which turns to Him with lowliness and resignation, such a heart as  He found in this poor thief. For He says Himself: \"turn to Me, and I  will turn to you.\" And so when this thief so courageously and  effectively turned to God, his prayer was at once not only accepted  but answered. For our Lord did not reject his prayer, or say to him:  \"See how I hang here in torment, and I behold before My eyes My  mother in sore affliction, and I have not yet spoken one word to  her, so that to hear thee now would not be just.\" No, our Lord said  nothing of this kind to the thief. Rather, He heard his prayer at  once, and made answer in that sweet word, \"Amen, I say unto thee,  this day shalt thou be with Me in paradise.\" O tender goodness, O  marvellous mercy of God! O great wisdom of the thief! He saw that  the treasures of Christ were wide open, and were being scattered  abroad. Who then should forbid him to take as much as would pay what  he owed to his Lord? And O the accursed hardness of the impenitent  thief, whom neither the rebuke of his associate, nor the patience of  Christ, nor the many signs of love and mercy that shone forth in  Christ, could melt or convert! He saw that alms were plentiful at  the rich man's gate, that more was given than was asked for, and yet  he was too proud and obstinate to ask. He saw that life and the  kingdom of heaven were being granted, and yet he would not bend his  heart to wish for them: therefore he shall not have them. He loved  better revilings and curses, and they shall come unto him, and that  for all eternity. These new first-fruits of the grape, which our  Lord gathered on the wood of the Cross from our barren soil, by much  sweat of His brow and much watering with His own precious blood, He  sent with great joy as a precious gift to His heavenly Father, by  His celestial messengers the holy angels. But if there is joy among  the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth, how must they  rejoice and exult at the salvation of this thief, of whom they had  almost despaired? We can picture to ourselves with what joy the  Father of heaven received these first-fruits of the harvest of His  Son's Passion. But Christ Himself, though He felt some joy at the  thief's conversion, was still more afflicted thereby, for by His  wisdom He foresaw that this thief would be the cause of perdition to  many, who would resolve to pass their whole lives in sin, hoping to  obtain pardon and grace at the moment of death. Truly a most foolish  hope, for nowhere in the Scriptures do we read that it has so  happened to any man. In truth, they who seek after God only when  they must, will not, it is to be feared, find Him near them in their  time of need. In the meantime, none can trust too much in God, and  no one has ever been forsaken by Him, who has turned to Him with his  whole heart, and leant upon Him with loving confidence.    THE THIRD WORD    THERE stood also by the Cross of Jesus His most holy and ever-virgin  mother Mary; not in order that His sufferings might thereby be  lessened, but that they might be greatly augmented. For if any  creature could have given consolation to the Lord while He hung on  the Cross, no one could have done it so fitly as His blessed mother.  But since it was God's will that Christ should die the most bitter  of deaths, and end His Passion without any comfort or relief, but  with true resignation, His mother's presence brought Him no  consolation, but rather added to His sufferings, for her sufferings  were thereby added to His, and this added yet more to His  affliction. Who then, O good Jesus can discover by meditation how  great was Thy inward grief, for Thou knowest the hearts of all, when  Thou sawest all the body of Thy holy mother tortured by inward  compassion, even as Thou wast tortured on the Cross, and her tender  heart and maternal breast pierced with the sword of sharp sorrow,  her face pale as death, telling the anguish of her soul, and almost  dead, yet unable to die. When Thou beheldest her hot tears, flowing  down abundantly like sweet rivers upon her gracious cheeks, and over  all her face, all witnesses to Thee that she shared in Thy sorrow  and love; when Thou heardest her sad laments, forced from her by the  weight of her affliction; when Thou sawest that same tender mother,  melted away with the heat of love, her strength quite failing her,  worn out and exhausted by the pains of Thy Passion, which wasted her  away; all this, truly, was a new affliction to Thee on the Cross; it  was itself a new Cross. For Thou alone, by the spear of, Thy pity,  didst explore the weight and grievousness of her woes, which to men  are beyond comprehension. All this, indeed, greatly increased the  pain of Thy Passion, because Thou wast crucified not only in Thy own  body, but in Thy mother's heart; for her Cross was Thy Cross, and  Thine was hers. O how bitter was Thy Passion, sweet Jesus! Great  indeed was Thy outward suffering, but far more grievous was Thy"]]]
