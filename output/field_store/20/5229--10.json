Mix very  well, and pour it on the dice. You may vary this by using cream only, in  which case omit the vinegar. Season with pepper, salt, celery seed, and  instead of the capers take some pickled nasturtium seed, and let that,  finely minced, remain in the sauce for an hour before using it.          ANCHOVIES    Fillets of these, put in a lattice work across mashed potato look very  nice. Be sure you use good anchovies preserved in salt, and well washed  and soaked to take away the greater part of the saltness; or, if you can  make some toast butter it when cold, cut it into thin strips, and lay  a fillet in the center. Fill up the sides of the toast with chopped  hard-boiled yolk of egg.          ANCHOVY SANDWICHES    Cut some bread and butter, very thin, and in fingers. Chop some  water-cress, lay it on a finger, sprinkle a little Tarragon vinegar and  water (equal quantities) over it, and then lay on a fillet of anchovy,  cover with more cress and a finger of bread and butter. Put them in a  pile under a plate to flatten and before serving trim the edges.          ANCHOVY ROUNDS    Make some toast, cut it in rounds, butter it when cold. Curl an anchovy  round a stewed olive, and put it on the toast. Make a little border of  yolk of egg boiled and chopped.          ANCHOVY BISCUITS    Made as you would make cheese biscuits, but using anchovy sauce instead  to flavor them. If you make the pastry thin you can put some lettuce  between two biscuits and press together with a little butter spread  inside.          ANCHOVY PATTIES    Make some paste and roll it out thinly. Take a coffee cup and turning it  upside down stamp out some rounds. Turn the cup the right way again,  and put it on a round. Then you will see an edge of paste protruding all  round. Turn this up with the end of a fork, which makes a pretty little  edge. Do this with all, and fill the shallow cases then made with a good  mayonnaise sauce in which you have put chopped celery and potato, and a  small quantity of chopped gherkins. Lay three fillets of anchovy across  each other to form a six-pointed star and season highly with cayenne  pepper.    All the above recipes can be followed using sardines instead of  anchovies, and indeed one can use them in many other ways, with eggs,  with lettuce, with tomatoes. As anchovies are rather expensive to buy,  I give a recipe for mock anchovies, which is easy to do, but it must be  done six months before using the fish.          MOCK ANCHOVIES    When sprats are cheap, buy a good quantity, what in England you would  call a peck. Do not either wipe or wash them. Take four ounces of  saltpeter, a pound of bay salt, two pounds of common coarse salt, and  pound them well, then add a little cochineal to color it, pound and mix  very well. Take a stone jar and put in it a layer of the mixture and  a layer of the sprats, on each layer of fish adding three or four bay  leaves and a few whole pepper-corns. Fill up the jar and press it all  down very firmly. Cover with a stone cover, and let them stand for six  months before you use them.          CUCUMBER A LA LAEKEN    Take a cucumber and cut it in pieces two inches long, then peel away the  dark green skin for one inch, leaving the other inch as it was. Set up  each piece on end, scoop it out till nearly the bottom and fill up with  bits of cold salmon or lobster in mayonnaise sauce. Cold turbot or any  other delicate fish will do equally well or a small turret of whipped  cream, slightly salted, should be piled on top. This dish never fails to  please.          HERRING AND MAYONNAISE    Take some salt herring, a half for each person, and soak them for a day  in water. Skin them, cut them open lengthwise, take out the backbone,  and put them to soak in vinegar. Then before serving them let them lie  for a few minutes in milk, and putting them on a dish pour over them a  good mayonnaise sauce. [_Mlle. Oclhaye._]          SWEET DRINKS AND CORDIALS. ORGEAT    Blanch first of all half a pound of sweet almonds and three ounces of  bitter, turn them into cold water for a few minutes; then you must pound  them very fine in a stone mortar, if you have a marble one so much the  better, and do it in a cool place.    You must add a little milk occasionally to prevent the paste from  becoming oily, then add three quarts of fresh milk, stirring it in  slowly, sweeten to your taste, and then putting all into a saucepan  clean as a chalice, bring it to the boil.    Boil for ten minutes, and then stir till cold, strain it through finest  muslin, and then add two good glasses of brandy. Bottle and keep in a  dark place.          HAWTHORN CORDIAL    When the hawthorn is in full bloom, pick a basketful of the blooms. Take  them home, and put the white petals into a large glass bottle, taking  care that you put in no leaves or stalks. When the bottle is filled to  the top do not press it down, but pour in gently as much good French  Brandy as it will hold. Cork and let it stand for three months, then  you can strain it off. This is good as a cordial, and if you find it too  strong, add water, or sweeten it with sugar.          DUTCH NOYEAU    Peel finely the rinds of five large lemons, or of six small ones, then  throw on it a pound of loaf sugar that you have freshly pounded, two  ounces of bitter almonds, chopped and pounded; mix these with two quarts  of the best Schnappes or Hollands, and add six tablespoonfuls of boiling  milk.    Fill your jars with this, cover it close, and put it in a passage or  hall, where people can shake it every day.    Leave it there for three weeks, and strain it through some blotting  paper into another bottle. It will be ready to drink.          LAVENDER WATER    Take a large bottle, and put in it twelve ounces of the best spirits of  wine, one essence of ambergris, twopennyworth of musk, and three drachms  of oil of lavender.    Cork it tightly, put in a dark place, and shake it every day for a  month. This is really lavender spirit, as no water is used.          HOT BURGUNDY    Take half a pint of good Burgundy wine, put it to boil with two cloves,  and a dust of mixed spice, sweeten to taste with some powdered sugar.  If you like add a quarter of the quantity of water to the wine before  boiling.          CREME DE POISSON A LA ROI ALBERT    Take a fresh raw whiting, fillet it, and pass the flesh through a wire  sieve.    For a small dish take four ounces of the fish, mix them lightly with  four tablespoonfuls of very thick cream, adding pepper and salt. Fill  an oval ring mold, and steam gently for twenty minutes, under buttered  paper.    Have some marine crayfish boiled, shell the tails, cut them in pieces,  removing the black line inside. Cut three truffles into thick slices,  heat them and the crayfish in some ordinary white sauce, enriched with  the yolk of a raw egg, pepper and salt, and one dessertspoonful of  tarragon vinegar. This must not be allowed to boil. When the cream is  turned out into a hot silver dish, pour the ragout into the center, and  put a hot lid on.    This dish, and that on page 86-87, has been composed by a Scotch lady in  honor of the King of the Belgians. Not every cook can manage the cream,  but the proportions are exact, and so is the time.    [_Mrs. Alex. Stuart._]          FISH AND CUSTARD    Boil up the trimmings of your fish with milk, pepper and salt. Strain it  and add the yolks of eggs till you get a good custard. Pour the custard  into a mold, and lay in it your fish, which must already be parboiled.  If you have cold fish, flake it, and mix it with the custard. Put the  mold in a double saucepan. Steam it for three quarters of an hour.  Turn it out, and garnish with strips of lemon peel, and if you have it,  sprigs of fennel.          HAKE AND POTATOES    Hake, which is not one of the most delicate fish, can be made excellent  if stewed in the following sauce: A quart of milk to which you have  added a dessertspoonful of any of the good English sauces; thicken it  with a knob of butter rolled in flour, which stir in till all is smooth.  When it boils take off the fire, and put in your pieces of hake, set  it back by the side of the fire to keep very hot, without boiling, for  twenty-five minutes. Meanwhile mash some potatoes, and put it as a  puree round a dish, pour the fish in the center, sprinkle on it chopped  parsley. The liquor ought to be much reduced.          VERY NICE SKATE    Take skate, or indeed any fish that rolls up easily, make into fillets,  dry them well, and sprinkle on each fillet, pepper, salt, a dust of  mixed spice, and chopped parsley. Roll each fillet up tightly, and  pack them tightly into a dish, so that they will not become loose. Take  vinegar and beer in equal quantities, or, if you do not like to use  beer, you must add to the vinegar some whole black pepper, and a good  sprinkle of dried and mixed herbs with salt. Pour over the fish, tie a  piece of buttered paper over the top, and bake for an hour and a quarter  (for a medium pie dish) in a moderate oven.          TO KEEP SPRATS    A large quantity of these may be bought cheaply and kept for some weeks  by this method. Put on to warm equal quantities of vinegar and water,  what you think sufficient to cover your sprats, allowing for wastage;  and stir in for every quart of liquor a small saltspoonful of mixed  spice, four bay leaves, a shallot minced, a small bunch of bruised  thyme, the thin rind of a half lemon, salt and pepper; if you can use  tarragon vinegar so much the better. Clean the sprats, remove tails and  heads, and lay them in a deep dish. Take your liquor and pour it over  the fish, tie a large paper over all, and let them bake in a cool oven  for two or three hours; or cook them in a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7234"],[0,"Species and Varieties, Their Origin (#12)"],[1,"at large. If the historic facts go to prove a multiple origin for the  cultivation of some of the more important useful plants, the probability  that different varieties or elementary species have been the starting  points for different lines of culture, evidently becomes stronger.    Unfortunately, this historic evidence is scanty. The most interesting  facts are those concerning the use of apples by the Romans and by their  contemporaries of the Swiss and middle European lake-dwellings. Oswald  Heer has collected large numbers of the relics of this prehistoric  period. Apples were found in large quantities, ordinarily cut into  halves and with the signs of having been dried. Heer distinguished two  varieties, one with large and one with small fruits. The first about 3  and [75] the other about 1.5-2 cm. in diameter. Both are therefore very  small compared with our present ordinary varieties, but of the same  general size as the wild forms of the present day. Like these, they must  have been of a more woody and less fleshy tissue. They would scarcely  have been tasteful to us, but in ancient times no better varieties were  known and therefore no comparison was possible.    There is no evidence concerning the question, as to whether during the  periods mentioned apples were cultivated or only collected in the wild  state. The very large numbers which are found, have induced some writers  to believe in their culture, but then there is no reason why they should  not have been collected in quantity from wild shrubs. The main fact is  that the apple was not a uniform species in prehistoric times but showed  even then at least some amount of variability.    At the present day the wild apples are very rich in elementary species.  Those of Versailles are not the same as those of Belgium, and still  others are growing in England and in Germany. The botanical differences  derived from the blossoms and the leaves are slight, but the flavor,  size and shape of the fruits diverge widely. Two opinions have been  advanced to explain this high degree of variability, but [76] neither of  them conveys a real explanation; their aim is chiefly to support  different views as to the causes of variability, and the origin of  elementary species at large.    One opinion, advocated by De Candolle, Darwin and others, claims that  the varieties owe their origin to the direct influence of cultivation,  and that the corresponding forms found in the wild state, are not at all  original, but have escaped from cultivation and apparently become wild.  Of course this possibility cannot be denied, at least in any single  instance, but it seems too sweeping an assertion to make for the whole  range of observed forms.    The alternative theory is that of van Mons, the Belgian originator of  commercial varieties of apples, who has published his experiments in a  large work called \"Arbres fruitiers ou Pomonomie belge.\" Most of the  more remarkable apples of the first half of the last century were  produced by van Mons, but his greatest merit is not the direct  production of a number of good varieties, but the foundation of the  method, by which new varieties may be obtained and improved.    According to van Mons, the production of a new variety consists chiefly  of two parts. The first is the discovery of a subspecies with new  desirable qualities. The second is the transformation [77] of the  original small and woody apple into a large, fleshy and palatable  variety. Subspecies, or what we now call elementary species were not  produced by man; nature alone creates new forms, as van Mons has it. He  examined with great care the wild apples of his country, and especially  those of the Ardennes, and found among them a number of species with  different flavors. For the flavor is the one great point, which must be  found ready in nature and which may be improved, but can never be  created by artificial selection. The numerous differences in flavor are  quite original; all of them may be found in the wild state and most of  them even in so limited a region as the Ardennes Mountains. Of course  van Mons preferred not to start from the wild types themselves, when the  same flavor could be met with in some cultivated variety. His general  method was, to search for a new flavor and to try to bring the bearer of  it up to the desired standard of size and edibility.    The latter improvement, though it always makes the impression of an  achievement, is only the last stone to be added to the building up of  the commercial value of the variety. Without it, the best flavored apple  remains a crab; with it, it becomes a conquest. According to the method  of van Mons it may be reached within [78] two or three generations, and  a man's life is wholly sufficient to produce in this way many new types  of the very best sorts, as van Mons himself has done. It is done in the  usual way, sowing on a large scale and selecting the best, which are in  their turn brought to an early maturation of their fruit by grafting,  because thereby the life from seed to seed may be reduced to a few  years.    Form, taste, color, flavor and other valuable marks of new varieties are  the products of nature, says van Mons, only texture, fleshiness and size  are added by man. And this is done in each new variety by the same  method and according to the same laws. The richness of the cultivated  apples of the present day was already present in the large range of  original wild elementary species, though unobserved and requiring  improvement.    An interesting proof of this principle is afforded by the experience of  Mr. Peter M. Gideon, as related by Bailey. Gideon sowed large quantities  of apple-seeds, and one seed produced a new and valuable variety called  by him the \"Wealthy\" apple. He first planted a bushel of apple-seeds,  and then every year, for nine years, planted enough seeds to produce a  thousand trees. At the end of ten years all seedlings had perished  except one hardy seedling [79] crab. This experiment was made in  Minnesota, and failed wholly. Then he bought a small lot of seeds of  apples and crab-apples in Maine and from these the \"Wealthy\" came. There  were only about fifty seeds in the lot of crab-apple seed which produced  the \"Wealthy,\" but before this variety was obtained, more than a bushel  of seed had been sown. Chance afforded a species with an unknown taste;  but the growing of many thousands of seedlings of known varieties was  not the best means to get something really new.    Pears are more difficult to improve than apples. They often require six  or more generations to be brought from the wild woody state to the  ordinary edible condition. But the varieties each seem to have a  separate origin, as with apples, and the wide range of form and of taste  must have been present in the wild state, long before cultivation. Only  recently has the improvement of cherries, plums, currants and  gooseberries been undertaken with success by Mr. Burbank, and the  difference between the wild and cultivated forms has hitherto been very  small. All indications point to the existence, before the era of  cultivation, of larger or smaller numbers of elementary species.    The same holds good with many of the larger forage crops and other  plants of great industrial [80] value. Clover exhibits many varieties,  which have been cultivated indiscriminately, and often in motley  mixtures. The flower heads may be red or white, large or small,  cylindric or rounded, the leaves are broader or narrower, with or  without white spots of a curious pattern. They may be more or less hairy  and so forth. Even the seeds exhibit differences in size, shape or  color, and of late Martinet has shown, that by the simple means of  picking out seeds of the same pattern, pure strains of clover may be  obtained, which are of varying cultural value. In this way the best  subspecies or varieties may be sought out for separate cultivation. Even  the white spots on the leaflets have proved to be constant characters  corresponding with noticeable differences in yield.    Flax is another instance. It was already cultivated, or at least made  use of during the period of the lake-dwellers, but at that time it was a  species referred to as _Linum angustifolium_, and not the _Linum  usitatissimum_, which is our present day flax. There are now many  subspecies, elementary species, and varieties under cultivation. The  oldest of them is known as the \"springing flax,\" in opposition to the  ordinary \"threshing flax.\" It has capsules which open of themselves, in  order to disseminate the seeds, while the ordinary heads of the [81]  flax remain closed until the seeds are liberated by threshing. It seems  probable that the first form or _Linum crepitans_ might thrive in the  wild state as well as any other plant, while in the common species those  qualities are lacking which are required for a normal dissemination of  the seeds. White or blue flowers, high or dwarf stems, more or less  branching at the base and sundry other qualities distinguish the  varieties, aside from the special industrial difference of the fibres.  Even the life-history varies from annual and biennial, to perennial.    It would take us too long to consider other instances. It is well known  that corn, though considered as a single botanical species, is  represented by different subspecies and varieties in nearly every region  in which it is grown. Of course its history is unknown and it is  impossible to decide whether all the tall and dwarf forms, or starchy  and sweet varieties, dented or rounded kernels, and hundreds of others  are older than culture or have come into existence during historic  times, or as some assume, through the agency of man. But our main point  now is not the origin, but only the existence of constant and sharply  differentiated forms within botanical species. Nearly every cultivated  plant affords instances"]]]
