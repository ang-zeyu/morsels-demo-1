But, to  make you quit it more easily, I desire that, beside what has been  hitherto suggested, you will farther consider whether, upon supposition  that Matter exists, you can possibly conceive how you should be affected  by it. Or, supposing it did not exist, whether it be not evident you  might for all that be affected with the same ideas you now are, and  consequently have the very same reasons to believe its existence that you  now can have.    HYL.  I acknowledge it is possible we might perceive all things just as  we do now, though there was no Matter in the world; neither can I  conceive, if there be Matter, how it should produce' any idea in our  minds. And, I do farther grant you have entirely satisfied me that it is  impossible there should be such a thing as matter in any of the foregoing  acceptations. But still I cannot help supposing that there is MATTER in  some sense or other. WHAT THAT IS I do not indeed pretend to determine.    PHIL.  I do not expect you should define exactly the nature of that  unknown being. Only be pleased to tell me whether it is a Substance; and  if so, whether you can suppose a Substance without accidents; or, in case  you suppose it to have accidents or qualities, I desire you will let me  know what those qualities are, at least what is meant by Matter's  supporting them?    HYL.  We have already argued on those points. I have no more to say to  them. But, to prevent any farther questions, let me tell you I at present  understand by MATTER neither substance nor accident, thinking nor  extended being, neither cause, instrument, nor occasion, but Something  entirely unknown, distinct from all these.    PHIL.  It seems then you include in your present notion of Matter  nothing but the general abstract idea of ENTITY.    HYL.  Nothing else; save only that I super-add to this general idea the  negation of all those particular things, qualities, or ideas, that I  perceive, imagine, or in anywise apprehend.    PHIL.  Pray where do you suppose this unknown Matter to exist?    HYL.  Oh Philonous! now you think you have entangled me; for, if I say  it exists in place, then you will infer that it exists in the mind, since  it is agreed that place or extension exists only in the mind. But I am  not ashamed to own my ignorance. I know not where it exists; only I am  sure it exists not in place. There is a negative answer for you. And you  must expect no other to all the questions you put for the future about  Matter.    PHIL.  Since you will not tell me where it exists, be pleased to inform  me after what manner you suppose it to exist, or what you mean by its  EXISTENCE?    HYL.  It neither thinks nor acts, neither perceives nor is perceived.    PHIL.  But what is there positive in your abstracted notion of its  existence?    HYL.  Upon a nice observation, I do not find I have any positive notion  or meaning at all. I tell you again, I am not ashamed to own my  ignorance. I know not what is meant by its EXISTENCE, or how it exists.    PHIL.  Continue, good Hylas, to act the same ingenuous part, and tell me  sincerely whether you can frame a distinct idea of Entity in general,  prescinded from and exclusive of all thinking and corporeal beings, all  particular things whatsoever.    HYL.  Hold, let me think a little--I profess, Philonous, I do not find  that I can. At first glance, methought I had some dilute and airy notion  of Pure Entity in abstract; but, upon closer attention, it hath quite  vanished out of sight. The more I think on it, the more am I confirmed in  my prudent resolution of giving none but negative answers, and not  pretending to the least degree of any positive knowledge or conception of  Matter, its WHERE, its HOW, its ENTITY, or anything belonging to  it.    PHIL.  When, therefore, you speak of the existence of Matter, you have  not any notion in your mind?    HYL.  None at all.    PHIL.  Pray tell me if the case stands not thus--At first, from a belief  of material substance, you would have it that the immediate objects  existed without the mind; then that they are archetypes; then causes;  next instruments; then occasions: lastly SOMETHING IN GENERAL, which  being interpreted proves NOTHING. So Matter comes to nothing. What  think you, Hylas, is not this a fair summary of your whole proceeding?    HYL.  Be that as it will, yet I still insist upon it, that our not being  able to conceive a thing is no argument against its existence.    PHIL.  That from a cause, effect, operation, sign, or other  circumstance, there may reasonably be inferred the existence of a thing  not immediately perceived; and that it were absurd for any man to argue  against the existence of that thing, from his having no direct and  positive notion of it, I freely own. But, where there is nothing of all  this; where neither reason nor revelation induces us to believe the  existence of a thing; where we have not even a relative notion of it;  where an abstraction is made from perceiving and being perceived, from  Spirit and idea: lastly, where there is not so much as the most  inadequate or faint idea pretended to--I will not indeed thence conclude  against the reality of any notion, or existence of anything; but my  inference shall be, that you mean nothing at all; that you employ words  to no manner of purpose, without any design or signification whatsoever.  And I leave it to you to consider how mere jargon should be treated.    HYL.  To deal frankly with you, Philonous, your arguments seem in  themselves unanswerable; but they have not so great an effect on me as to  produce that entire conviction, that hearty acquiescence, which attends  demonstration. I find myself relapsing into an obscure surmise of I know  not what, MATTER.    PHIL.  But, are you not sensible, Hylas, that two things must concur to  take away all scruple, and work a plenary assent in the mind? Let a  visible object be set in never so clear a light, yet, if there is any  imperfection in the sight, or if the eye is not directed towards it, it  will not be distinctly seen. And though a demonstration be never so well  grounded and fairly proposed, yet, if there is withal a stain of  prejudice, or a wrong bias on the understanding, can it be expected on a  sudden to perceive clearly, and adhere firmly to the truth? No; there is  need of time and pains: the attention must be awakened and detained by a  frequent repetition of the same thing placed oft in the same, oft in  different lights. I have said it already, and find I must still repeat  and inculcate, that it is an unaccountable licence you take, in  pretending to maintain you know not what, for you know not what reason,  to you know not what purpose. Can this be paralleled in any art or  science, any sect or profession of men? Or is there anything so  barefacedly groundless and unreasonable to be met with even in the lowest  of common conversation? But, perhaps you will still say, Matter may  exist; though at the same time you neither know WHAT IS MEANT by  MATTER, or by its EXISTENCE. This indeed is surprising, and the more  so because it is altogether voluntary and of your own head, you not  being led to it by any one reason; for I challenge you to shew me that  thing in nature which needs Matter to explain or account for it.    HYL.  THE REALITY of things cannot be maintained without supposing the  existence of Matter. And is not this, think you, a good reason why I  should be earnest in its defence?    PHIL.  The reality of things! What things? sensible or intelligible?    HYL.  Sensible things.    PHIL.  My glove for example?    HYL.  That, or any other thing perceived by the senses.    PHIL.  But to fix on some particular thing. Is it not a sufficient  evidence to me of the existence of this GLOVE, that I see it, and feel  it, and wear it? Or, if this will not do, how is it possible I should be  assured of the reality of this thing, which I actually see in this place,  by supposing that some unknown thing, which I never did or can see,  exists after an unknown manner, in an unknown place, or in no place at  all? How can the supposed reality of that which is intangible be a proof  that anything tangible really exists? Or, of that which is invisible,  that any visible thing, or, in general of anything which is  imperceptible, that a perceptible exists? Do but explain this and I shall  think nothing too hard for you.    HYL.  Upon the whole, I am content to own the existence of matter is  highly improbable; but the direct and absolute impossibility of it does  not appear to me.    PHIL.  But granting Matter to be possible, yet, upon that account  merely, it can have no more claim to existence than a golden mountain, or  a centaur.    HYL.  I acknowledge it; but still you do not deny it is possible; and  that which is possible, for aught you know, may actually exist.    PHIL.  I deny it to be possible; and have, if I mistake not,  evidently proved, from your own concessions, that it is not. In the  common sense of the word MATTER, is there any more implied than an  extended, solid, figured, moveable substance, existing without the mind?  And have not you acknowledged, over and over, that you have seen evident  reason for denying the possibility of such a substance?    HYL.  True, but that is only one sense of the term MATTER.    PHIL.  But is it not the only proper genuine received sense? And, if  Matter, in such a sense, be proved impossible, may it not be thought with  good grounds absolutely impossible? Else how could anything be proved  impossible? Or, indeed, how could there be any proof at all one way or  other, to a man who takes the liberty to unsettle and change the common  signification of words?    HYL.  I thought philosophers might be allowed to speak more accurately  than the vulgar, and were not always confined to the common acceptation  of a term.    PHIL.  But this now mentioned is the common received sense among"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],[0,"Seven Little Australians (#12)"],[1,"said it because--well,  because I am a great rough brute, and don't know how to talk to a  little, tender girl.  Dear Miss Meg, do shake hands and tell me you  forgive my boorishness.\"    Meg extended a small white hand, and he shook it warmly.  Then  they walked up the paddocks together, and parted at a broken gate  leading into the garden.    \"I'll never flirt again while I live,\" she said with great  earnestness, as he bade her good-bye; and he answered encouragingly,  \"No, I am quite sure you won't--leave it to girls like Aldith, won't  you? you only wanted to be set straight.  Good-bye, little Miss Meg.\"          CHAPTER IX    Consequences        \"However could you do it?    Some day, no doubt, you'll rue it!\"      Meg's troubles were not quite over, however, even yet.  When she  got into the house Nellie met her in the hall and stared at her.    \"Where have you been?\" she said, a slow wonder in her round eyes.  \"I've been hunting and hunting for you.\"    \"What for?\" said Meg shortly.    \"Oh, Dr. Gormeston and Mrs. Gormeston and two Miss Gormestons are in  the drawing-room, and I think they'll stay for ever and ever.\"    \"Well?\" said Meg.    \"And the General is ill again, and Esther says she won't leave him  for a second, not if Gog and Magog were down there dying to see  her.\"    \"Well?\" said Meg again.    \"And Father is as mad as he can be, and is having to keep them  all amused himself.  He's sung 'My sweetheart when a boy' and  'Mona,' and he's told them all about his horses, and now I s'pose  he doesn't know what to do.\"    \"Well, I can't help it,\" Meg said wearily, and as if the subject  had no interest for her.    \"But you'll just have to!\" Nell cried sharply, \"I've done my  best: he sent out and said we were to go in, and you weren't  anywhere, so there was only Baby and me.\"    \"And what did you do?\" Meg asked, curious in spite of herself.    \"Oh, Baby talked to Miss Gormeston, and they asked me to play,\"  she returned, \"so I played the 'Keel Row.'  Only I forgot  till I had finished that it was in two sharps,\" she added sadly.  \"And then Baby told Mrs. Gormeston all about Judy leaving the  General at the Barracks, and being sent to boarding school for it,  and about the green frog Bunty gave her, and, then Father said  we'd better go to bed, and asked why ever you didn't come in.\"    \"I'll go, I'll go,\" Meg said hastily, \"he'll be fearfully cross  to-morrow about it.  Oh! and, Nell, go and tell Martha to  send in the wine and biscuits and things in half an hour.\"    She flung off her cloud, smoothed her ruffled hair, and peeped  in the hall-stand glass to see if the night wind had taken away  the traces of her recent tears.  Then she went into the drawing-roam,  where her father was looking quite heated and unhappy over  his efforts to entertain four guests who were of the class  popularly known as \"heavy in hand:\"    \"Play something, Meg,\" he said presently, when greetings were  finished, and a silence seemed settling down over them all again;  \"or sing something that will be better--haven't you anything you  can sing?\"    Now Meg on ordinary occasions had a pleasant, fresh little voice  of her own, that could be listened to with a certain amount of  pleasure, but this evening she was tired and excited and unhappy.  She sang \"Within a mile of Edinboro' town,\" and was exceedingly  flat all through.    She knew her father was sitting on edge all the time, and that her  mistakes were grating on him, and at the end of the song, rather  than turn round immediately and face them all, she began to play  Kowalski's March Hongroise.  But the keys seemed to be rising up  and hitting her hands, and the piano was growing unsteady, and  rocking to and fro in an alarming manner; she made a horrible  jangle as she clutched at the music-holder for safety, and the  next minute swayed from the stool and fell in a dead, faint right  into Dr. Gormeston's arms, providentially extended just in time.    The heavy, heated atmosphere had proved too much for her, in her  unhinged state of mind.  Captain Woolcot was extraordinarily  upset by the occurrence; not one of his children had ever done  such a thing before, and as Meg lay on the sofa, with her  little fair head drooping against the red frilled cushions, her  face white and unconscious, she looked strangely like her mother,  whom he had buried out in the churchyard four years ago.  He went  to the filter for a glass of water, and, as it trickled, wondered  in a dull, mechanical kind of way if his little dead wife thought  he had been too quick in appointing Esther to her kingdom.  And  then, as he stood near the sofa and looked at the death-like face,  he wondered with a cold chill at his heart whether Meg was going  to die, too, and if so would she be able to tell the same little  wife that Esther received more tenderness at his hands than she  had done.    His reverie was interrupted by the doctor's sharp, surprised  voice.  He was talking to Esther, who had been hastily summoned to  the scene, and who had helped to unfasten the pretty bodice.    \"Why, the child is tight-laced!\" he said; \"surely you must  have noticed it, madam.  That pressure, if it has been constant,  has been enough to half kill her.  Chut, chut! faint indeed--I wonder  she has not taken fits or gone into a decline before this.\"    Then a cloud of trouble came over Esther's beautiful face--she had  failed again in her duty.  Her husband was regarding her almost  gloomily from the sofa, where the little figure lay in its  crumpled muslin dress, and her heart told her these children  were not receiving a mother's care at her hands.    Afterwards, when Meg was safely in bed and the excitement  all over, she went up to her husband almost timidly.    \"I'm only twenty; Jack; don't be too hard on me!\" she said  with a little sob in her voice.  \"I can't be all to them that  she was, can I?\"    He kissed the bright, beautiful head against his shoulder,  and comforted her with a tender word or two.  But again and again  that night there came to him Meg's white, still face as it lay on  the scarlet cushions, and he knew the wind that stirred the  curtains at the window had been playing with the long grass in  the churchyard a few minutes since.          CHAPTER X    Bunty in the Light of a Hero          \"'I know him to be valiant.'       'I was told that by one that knows him better than you.'       'What's he?'       'Marry, he told the so himself, and he said              he cared not who knew it'\"      Bunty had been betrayed into telling another story.  It was a  very, big one, and he was proportionately miserable.  Everyone  else had gone out but Meg, who was still in bed after her fainting  fit, and he had been having a lonely game of cricket down in the  paddock by himself.  But even with a brand-new cricket ball this  game palls after a time when one has to bowl and bat and backstop  in solitary state.  So presently he put his bat over into the garden,  and began to throw the ball about in an aimless fashion, while he  cogitated on what he should do next.  His father's hack was standing  away at the farther end of the paddock, and in an idle, thoughtless  way Bunty sauntered down towards it, and then sent his ball spinning  over the ground in its direction \"to give it a jump.\"  Nothing was  further from his thoughts than an idea of hurting the animal, and  when the ball struck it full on the leg, and it moved away limping,  he hastened down to it, white and anxious.    He could see he had done serious mischief by the way the poor  thing held its leg up from the ground and quivered when he touched  it.  Terror seized him forthwith, and he turned hastily round with  his usual idea of hiding in his head.  But to his utter dismay,  when he got half-way back across the paddock he saw his father and  a brother officer come out of the wicket gate leading from the  garden and saunter slowly down in the direction of the horse,  which was a valuable and beautiful one.    In terror at what he had done, he slipped the cricket ball into the  front of his sailor jacket, and, falling hurriedly upon his  knees, began playing an absorbing game of marbles.  His trembling  thumb had hit about a dozen at random when he heard his name called  in stentorian tones.    He rose, brushed the dust from his shaking knees, and walked slowly  down to his father.    \"Go and tell Pat I want him instantly,\" the Captain said.  He  had the horse's leg in his hand and was examining it anxiously.  \"If he's not about, send Pip.  I can't think how it's happened--do  you know anything of this, Bunty?\"    \"No, of course not! I n--never did n--n--nothing,\" Bunty said with  chattering teeth, but his father was too occupied to notice his  evident guilt, and bade him go at once.    So he went up to the stables and sent Pat posthaste back to his  father.    And then he stole into the house, purloined two apples and a bit  of cake from the dining-room, and went away to be utterly miserable  until he had confessed.    He crept into a disused shed some distance from the house; in days  gone by it had been a stable, and had a double loft over it that  was only to be reached by a ladder in the last stage of dilapidation.  Bunty scrambled up, sat down in an unhappy little heap among some  straw, and began thoughtfully to gnaw an apple.    If ever a little lad was in need of a wise loving, motherly  mother it was this same dirty-faced, heavyhearted one who sat  with his small rough head against a cobwebby beam and muttered  dejectedly, \"'Twasn't my fault: 'Twas the horse:\"    He fancied something moved in the second loft, which was divided  from the one he was in by a low partition.  \"Shoo--shoo, get away!\"  he called, thinking it was rats.  He struck the floor several times  with his heavy little boots.    \"Shoo!\" he said.    \"Bunty,\"    The boy turned pale to his lips.  That odd, low whisper of his  name, that strange rustle so near him--o"]]]
