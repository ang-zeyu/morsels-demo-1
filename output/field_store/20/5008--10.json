Raoul de Lagors, and had gained immense sums.    Five o'clock struck before the list of witnesses summoned for the day  was exhausted. But the task of M. Patrigent was not yet finished. He  rang for his bailiff, who instantly appeared, and said to him:    \"Go at once, and bring Fanferlot here.\"    It was some time before the detective answered the summons. Having met  a colleague on the gallery, he thought it his duty to treat him to a  drink; and the bailiff had found it necessary to bring him from the  little inn at the corner.    \"How is it that you keep people waiting?\" said the judge, when he  entered bowing and scraping. Fanferlot bowed more profoundly still.    Despite his smiling face, he was very uneasy. To prosecute the Bertomy  case alone, it required a double play that might be discovered at any  moment; to manage at once the cause of justice and his own ambition, he  ran great risks, the least of which was the losing of his place.    \"I have a great deal to do,\" he said, to excuse himself, \"and have not  wasted any time.\"    And he began to give a detailed account of his movements. He was  embarrassed, for he spoke with all sorts of restrictions, picking out  what was to be said, and avoiding what was to be left unsaid. Thus he  gave the history of Cavaillon's letter, which he handed to the judge;  but he did not breathe a word of Madeleine. On the other hand, he gave  biographical details, very minute indeed, of Prosper and Mme. Gypsy,  which he had collected from various quarters during the day.    As he progressed the conviction of M. Patrigent was strengthened.    \"This young man is evidently guilty,\" he said. Fanferlot did not reply;  his opinion was different, but he was delighted that the judge was  on the wrong track, thinking that his own glory would thereby be the  greater when he discovered the real culprit. True, this grand discovery  was as far off as it had ever been; but Fanferlot was hopeful.    After hearing all he had to tell, the judge dismissed Fanferlot, telling  him to return the next day.    \"Above all,\" he said, as Fanferlot left the room, \"do not lose sight of  the girl Gypsy; she must know where the money is, and can put us on the  track.\"    Fanferlot smiled cunningly.    \"You may rest easy about that, monsieur; the lady is in good hands.\"    Left to himself, although the evening was far advanced, M. Patrigent  continued to busy himself with the case, and to arrange that the rest of  the depositions should be made.    This case had actually taken possession of his mind; it was, at the same  time, puzzling and attractive. It seemed to be surrounded by a cloud of  mystery, and he determined to penetrate and dispel it.    The next morning he was in his office much earlier than usual. On this  day he examined Mme. Gypsy, recalled Cavaillon, and sent again for M.  Fauvel. For several days he displayed the same activity.    Of all the witnesses summoned, only two failed to appear.    One was the office-boy sent by Prosper to bring the money from the city  bank; he was ill from a fall.    The other was M. Raoul de Lagors.    But their absence did not prevent the file of papers relating to  Prosper's case from daily increasing; and on the ensuing Monday, five  days after the robbery, M. Patrigent thought he held in his hands enough  moral proof to crush the accused.          V    While his whole past was the object of the most minute investigations,  Prosper was in prison, in a secret cell.    The two first days had not appeared very long.    He had requested, and been granted, some sheets of paper, numbered,  which he was obliged to account for; and he wrote, with a sort of rage,  plans of defence and a narrative of justification.    The third day he began to be uneasy at not seeing anyone except the  condemned prisoners who were employed to serve those confined in secret  cells, and the jailer who brought him his food.    \"Am I not to be examined again?\" he would ask.    \"Your turn is coming,\" the jailer invariably answered.    Time passed; and the wretched man, tortured by the sufferings of  solitary confinement which quickly breaks the spirit, sank into the  depths of despair.    \"Am I to stay here forever?\" he moaned.    No, he was not forgotten; for on Monday morning, at one o'clock, an hour  when the jailer never came, he heard the heavy bolt of his cell pushed  back.    He ran toward the door.    But the sight of a gray-headed man standing on the sill rooted him to  the spot.    \"Father,\" he gasped, \"father!\"    \"Your father, yes!\"    Prosper's astonishment at seeing his father was instantly succeeded by a  feeling of great joy.    A father is one friend upon whom we can always rely. In the hour of  need, when all else fails, we remember this man upon whose knees we sat  when children, and who soothed our sorrows; and although he can in no  way assist us, his presence alone comforts and strengthens.    Without reflecting, Prosper, impelled by tender feeling, was about to  throw himself on his father's bosom.    M. Bertomy harshly repulsed him.    \"Do not approach me!\" he exclaimed.    He then advanced into the cell, and closed the door. The father and son  were alone together, Prosper heart-broken, crushed; M. Bertomy angry,  almost threatening.    Cast off by this last friend, by his father, the miserable young man  seemed to be stupefied with pain and disappointment.    \"You too!\" he bitterly cried. \"You, you believe me guilty? Oh, father!\"    \"Spare yourself this shameful comedy,\" interrupted M. Bertomy: \"I know  all.\"    \"But I am innocent, father; I swear it by the sacred memory of my  mother.\"    \"Unhappy wretch,\" cried M. Bertomy, \"do not blaspheme!\"    He seemed overcome by tender thoughts of the past, and in a weak, broken  voice, he added:    \"Your mother is dead, Prosper, and little did I think that the day would  come when I could thank God for having taken her from me. Your crime  would have killed her, would have broken her heart!\"    After a painful silence, Prosper said:    \"You overwhelm me, father, and at the moment when I need all my courage;  when I am the victim of an odious plot.\"    \"Victim!\" cried M. Bertomy, \"victim! Dare you utter your insinuations  against the honorable man who has taken care of you, loaded you with  benefits, and had insured you a brilliant future! It is enough for you  to have robbed him; do not calumniate him.\"    \"For pity's sake, father, let me speak!\"    \"I suppose you would deny your benefactor's kindness. Yet you were at  one time so sure of his affection, that you wrote me to hold myself in  readiness to come to Paris and ask M. Fauvel for the hand of his niece.  Was that a lie too?\"    \"No,\" said Prosper in a choked voice, \"no.\"    \"That was a year ago; you then loved Mlle. Madeleine; at least you wrote  to me that you--\"    \"Father, I love her now, more than ever; I have never ceased to love  her.\"    M. Bertomy made a gesture of contemptuous pity.    \"Indeed!\" he cried, \"and the thought of the pure, innocent girl whom you  loved did not prevent your entering upon a path of sin. You loved her:  how dared you, then, without blushing, approach her presence after  associating with the shameless creatures with whom you were so  intimate?\"    \"For Heaven's sake, let me explain by what fatality Madeleine--\"    \"Enough, monsieur, enough. I told you that I know everything. I saw M.  Fauvel yesterday; this morning I saw the judge, and 'tis to his kindness  that I am indebted for this interview. Do you know what mortification  I suffered before being allowed to see you? I was searched and made to  empty all of my pockets, on suspicion of bringing you arms!\"    Prosper ceased to justify himself, but in a helpless, hopeless way,  dropped down upon a seat.    \"I have seen your apartments, and at once recognized the proofs of your  crime. I saw silk curtains hanging before every window and door, and  the walls covered with pictures. In my father's house the walls were  whitewashed; and there was but one arm-chair in the whole house, and  that was my mother's. Our luxury was our honesty. You are the first  member of our family who has possessed Aubusson carpets; though, to be  sure, you are the first thief of our blood.\"    At this last insult Prosper's face flushed crimson, but he remained  silent and immovable.    \"But luxury is necessary now,\" continued M. Bertomy, becoming more  excited and angry as he went on, \"luxury must be had at any price. You  must have the insolent opulence and display of an upstart, without being  an upstart. You must support worthless women who wear satin slippers  lined with swan's-down, like those I saw in your rooms, and keep  servants in livery--and you steal! And bankers no longer trust their  safe-keys with anybody; and every day honest families are disgraced by  the discovery of some new piece of villainy.\"    M. Bertomy suddenly stopped. He saw that his son was not in a condition  to hear any more reproaches.    \"But I will say no more,\" he said. \"I came here not to reproach, but  to, if possible, save the honor of our name, to prevent it from being  published in the papers bearing the names of thieves and murderers.  Stand up and listen to me!\"    At the imperious tone of his father, Prosper arose. So many successive  blows had reduced him to a state of torpor.    \"First of all,\" began M. Bertomy, \"how much have you remaining of the  stolen three hundred and fifty thousand francs?\"    \"Once more, father,\" replied the unfortunate man in a tone of hopeless  resignation, \"once more I swear I am innocent.\"    \"So I supposed you would say. Then our family will have to repair the  injury you have done M. Fauvel.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"The day he heard of your crime, your brother-in-law brought me your  sister's dowry, seventy thousand francs.

The metallic sheen of the head of the ring-neck is a  dark indigo blue. The bill of the ring-neck is quite different from  that of the scaups, being much darker in color and more of a sooty  tinge and with a faint bluish band across it about half an inch from  the end. The females of all three species resemble each other very  closely, but the difference in size will generally determine to which  species they belong. The two blue-bills can be told from the female  ring-neck by their white speculums. The female ring-neck has the gray  of the male, but this does not distinguish it from the female  red-head. The smaller size of the ring-neck and darker appearance of  the head and neck will always indicate to which species the female  belongs. The bill of the female red-head meets the skull in quite an  abrupt manner, while hat of the ring-neck has more of the sloping  character of the canvasback.    =Color=--Male--Head and neck, black, showing a green luster in the  sun; back, gray, finely lined with black; under parts, white;  speculum, white.    Female--Head, dead brown, with a light gray patch at the base of the  bill blending into the brown of the head; breast and back, dirty  brown; under parts, white; speculum, white; bill, bluish.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is a crude affair near the water's edge,  containing about ten pale olive-buff eggs.    =Measurements=--Total length, about 18 inches; wing, 8-1/2, and  bill, 1 7/8 inches. The females are but a trifle smaller.      THE LESSER SCAUP, OR LITTLE BLUE-BILL    (Aythya affinis)    The little blue-bill, or lesser scaup, like its larger relative, is a  cosmopolitan species, and commonly met with in flocks of the other,  which has led to the common error of classing the two together, the  one as the elder and the other as the younger birds.    While in general color and markings they are very similar, there is  so much difference in their size that they should be easily  distinguished. With the males this is very easy for the head of the  larger species has a green sheen, the head of the lesser has a purple  sheen as shown in the sun. The bill of this species is more of a blue  and much smaller, being not over 1-1/2 inches in length.    =Color=--The color and markings are the same as the American scaup,  with the exception that the metallic sheen of the head, as already  mentioned, is purple.    =Nest and Eggs=--The same as the American scaup.    =Measurements=--Total length, about 16-1/2 inches; wing, 7-1/2,  and bill 1-1/2 inches.        [Illustration: RING-NECK (Aythya collaris)]      THE RING-NECK    (Aythya collaris)    In the breeding season the ring-neck male has a dirty orange ring  around the neck which disappears wholly, or nearly so, before the  beginning of the hunting season. The ring-neck is generally more  plentiful on the fresh waters. I have seen great numbers of them at  the mouth of the Colorado river. In fact, both the ring-neck and the  lesser scaup range much farther south than do the larger species, for  while few of the larger scaup are seen in Mexico, great quantities of  the little blue-bills are found throughout the republic, especially on  the salt marshes of the two coasts. All of these three species breed  along the mountain lakes from California north.    =Color=--Male--Head and neck, black, with an indigo sheen when turned  in the sun. This will always distinguish it from the larger blue-bill  whose sheen is green and the lesser blue-bill whose sheen is purple.  The speculum is gray; bill, bluish with a pale blue band across it  about a half inch from the end.    Female--The female of this species resembles the female of the  red-head very closely. It is considerable darker, however, and the  bill joins the head without the marked indentation seen in the  red-head.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest and eggs are the same as the scaups.    =Measurements=--Total length, 17-1/2 inches; wing, 8, and bill, 2 inches.        [Illustration: RUDDY DUCK (Erismatura rubida)]      THE RUDDY DUCK, OR WIRE-TAIL    (Erismatura rubida)    The ruddy duck is a very common duck on our shooting grounds, from one  end to the other, though as a rule it is not much sought after by our  sportsmen. When feeding on the salt marshes they are not very  palatable, it is true, but when killed on fresh waters they are one of  our finest flavored ducks, if properly cooked. After refusing many  shots at these little ducks and even many times failing to carry home  those I did kill, it remained for Mr. Babcock, then of the Coronado  Hotel, of San Diego, California, to demonstrate to me the real value  of the ruddy duck. I was one of the party shooting with him on his  preserve at Otay dam. When we came into the house after our morning's  shoot, a most enjoyable one, he asked each member of the party what  kind of duck he wished for his dinner. Mallards, canvasbacks, sprigs  and widgeons had been named, so when he came to me I answered that any  kind would do me. To this he replied: \"Then you shall have one of my  favorites.\" When dinner was ready, before each plate was a beautifully  roasted duck of the species chosen by the member of the party for whom  that plate was laid, but the plates in front of Mr. Babcock and myself  each contained two plump little birds that I did not recognize in  their undress uniform. After I had tasted of one, Mr. Babcock asked:  \"How do you like my selection?\" \"Very much,\" I answered, \"but what are  they? I never ate anything better.\" \"The much despised ruddy,\" was his  reply, \"the superior of the canvasback when properly handled.\" The  best evidence that I fully endorsed all that he claimed for the ruddy  duck is the fact that there was nothing left of my two birds but  well-picked bones. The ruddy duck may well be called a resident  species over the whole of the Pacific Coast shooting grounds, for they  breed not only on the lakes and streams, but on the lower marshes as  well, throughout the whole territory.    The ruddy duck is known by a number of names such as \"wire tail,\"  \"dipper,\" \"bullet-head,\" \"buffle-head,\" etc.    =Color=--Male--Top of head, dark brown; sides of head below the eye,  dirty white; upper parts, brown; no speculum on the wing; axillars,  very light gray with light brown shafts; tail, broad and stiff with  the feathers pointed; under parts, dirty white.    Female--Much the color of the male, but more of a dirty brown. Side of  the head and throat, dirty gray.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nests are usually built on little hillocks in the  marshes, and contain from six to eight dirty white eggs.    =Measurements=--The ruddy is a small duck with a very rounded body.  Total length, about 15 inches; wing, 6, and bill, 1-1/2 inches, strongly  depressed in the center.        [Illustration: AMERICAN GOLDEN-EYE (Glaucionetta clangula americana)]      THE AMERICAN GOLDEN-EYE    (Glaucionetta clangula americana)    The American golden-eye is a visitor from the far north to the  northern portions of the territory covered by this work. An occasional  straggler is killed as far south as San Francisco, but they are a cold  country bird. They are more common in the interior of Washington and  Oregon than along the coast.    =Color=--Male--Head and upper half of neck, dark green with a metallic  sheen; a nearly round patch of white between the eye and the base of  the bill; lower part of neck, most of the back and the under parts,  white; upper part of the back, rump and tail, black; wings, mostly  white.    Female--Head and upper neck, brown; gray spot at the base of the bill;  breast and under parts, gray; back and most of the wings, brownish  black.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is usually built in a hollow tree or stump  and contains about ten eggs of a bluish white color.    =Measurements=--Total length, about 19 inches; wing, 9, and  bill, 1 7/8. Female about one-tenth smaller.        [Illustration: BARROW'S GOLDEN-EYE (Glaucionetta ilandica)]      BARROW'S GOLDEN-EYE    (Glaucionetta ilandica)    Barrow's golden-eye is another duck that is seen, but little within  the Pacific Coast hunting grounds, and only then near the coast  sections of the northern part. They are found more plentiful on the  islands along the north Pacific coast.    =Color=--The male resembles the American golden-eye very closely,  except that the head of the Barrow's is more of a purple, or greenish  purple. The white at the base of the bill is also different, it being  a crescent shape instead of round.    The female differs in the head being more of a cinnamon brown, and the  back more of a gray and slightly mottled with brown.    =Nest, Eggs and Measurements=--The same as the American golden-eye.        [Illustration: BUTTER-BALL (Charitonetta albeola)]      THE BUTTER-BALL    (Charitonetta albeola)    The butter-ball, or buffle-head, is another common duck all over the  country. But where we have so many larger and better ducks they are  little sought for, and are generally considered poor shooting. Yet I  recall one occasion when with a friend I was shooting on a couple of  foothill ponds where many of these little ducks had congregated, they  furnished us with fine sport. The larger ducks were soon scared away,  but the little butter-balls would not leave. One of us was stationed  at each pond and we soon had them all in the air.    =Color=--Male--Head, greenish purple, with a strong metallic luster;  white patch running from the eye to the back of the head; feathers of  the head long, forming a crest; back, black; under parts white and a  broad white patch on the wing.    Female--The female is a very modestly colored bird to have so gaudy a  mate. Head and upper parts, a dark, dead brown; under parts, white;  speculum, white; a small, elongated white spot on the side of the  head.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is usually built on some elevation such as a  stump or log;"]]]
