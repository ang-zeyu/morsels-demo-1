At  this time she was twenty-two, and by her personal influence she had  ended one of the greatest struggles of history. Nor had she done it to  her country's loss. Denmark yielded up rich provinces, while Germany  was compelled to grant Sweden membership in the German diet.    Then came a period of immense prosperity through commerce, through  economies in government, through the improvement of agriculture and the  opening of mines. This girl queen, without intrigue, without descending  from her native nobility to peep and whisper with shady diplomats,  showed herself in reality a great monarch, a true Semiramis of the  north, more worthy of respect and reverence than Elizabeth of England.  She was highly trained in many arts. She was fond of study, spoke Latin  fluently, and could argue with Salmasius, Descartes, and other  accomplished scholars without showing any inferiority to them.    She gathered at her court distinguished persons from all countries. She  repelled those who sought her hand, and she was pure and truthful and  worthy of all men's admiration. Had she died at this time history would  rank her with the greatest of women sovereigns. Naude, the librarian of  Cardinal Mazarin, wrote of her to the scientist Gassendi in these words:    To say truth, I am sometimes afraid lest the common saying should be  verified in her, that short is the life and rare the old age of those  who surpass the common limits. Do not imagine that she is learned only  in books, for she is equally so in painting, architecture, sculpture,  medals, antiquities, and all curiosities. There is not a cunning  workman in these arts but she has him fetched. There are as good  workers in wax and in enamel, engravers, singers, players, dancers here  as will be found anywhere.    She has a gallery of statues, bronze and marble, medals of gold,  silver, and bronze, pieces of ivory, amber, coral, worked crystal,  steel mirrors, clocks and tables, bas-reliefs and other things of the  kind; richer I have never seen even in Italy; finally, a great quantity  of pictures. In short, her mind is open to all impressions.    But after she began to make her court a sort of home for art and  letters it ceased to be the sort of court that Sweden was prepared for.  Christina's subjects were still rude and lacking in accomplishments;  therefore she had to summon men of genius from other countries,  especially from France and Italy. Many of these were illustrious  artists or scholars, but among them were also some who used their  mental gifts for harm.    Among these latter was a French physician named Bourdelot--a man of  keen intellect, of winning manners, and of a profound cynicism, which  was not apparent on the surface, but the effect of which last lasting.  To Bourdelot we must chiefly ascribe the mysterious change which  gradually came over Queen Christina. With his associates he taught her  a distaste for the simple and healthy life that she had been accustomed  to lead. She ceased to think of the welfare of the state and began to  look down with scorn upon her unsophisticated Swedes. Foreign luxury  displayed itself at Stockholm, and her palaces overflowed with  beautiful things.    By subtle means Bourdelot undermined her principles. Having been a  Stoic, she now became an Epicurean. She was by nature devoid of  sentiment. She would not spend her time in the niceties of love-making,  as did Elizabeth; but beneath the surface she had a sort of tigerish,  passionate nature, which would break forth at intervals, and which  demanded satisfaction from a series of favorites. It is probable that  Bourdelot was her first lover, but there were many others whose names  are recorded in the annals of the time.    When she threw aside her virtue Christina ceased to care about  appearances. She squandered her revenues upon her favorites. What she  retained of her former self was a carelessness that braved the opinion  of her subjects. She dressed almost without thought, and it is said  that she combed her hair not more than twice a month. She caroused with  male companions to the scandal of her people, and she swore like a  trooper when displeased.    Christina's philosophy of life appears to have been compounded of an  almost brutal licentiousness, a strong love of power, and a strange,  freakish longing for something new. Her political ambitions were  checked by the rising discontent of her people, who began to look down  upon her and to feel ashamed of her shame. Knowing herself as she did,  she did not care to marry.    Yet Sweden must have an heir. Therefore she chose out her cousin  Charles, declared that he was to be her successor, and finally caused  him to be proclaimed as such before the assembled estates of the realm.  She even had him crowned; and finally, in her twenty-eighth year, she  abdicated altogether and prepared to leave Sweden. When asked whither  she would go, she replied in a Latin quotation:    \"The Fates will show the way.\"    In her act of abdication she reserved to herself the revenues of some  of the richest provinces in Sweden and absolute power over such of her  subjects as should accompany her. They were to be her subjects until  the end.    The Swedes remembered that Christina was the daughter of their greatest  king, and that, apart from personal scandals, she had ruled them well;  and so they let her go regretfully and accepted her cousin as their  king. Christina, on her side, went joyfully and in the spirit of a  grand adventuress. With a numerous suite she entered Germany, and then  stayed for a year at Brussels, where she renounced Lutheranism. After  this she traveled slowly into Italy, where she entered Borne on  horseback, and was received by the Pope, Alexander VII., who lodged her  in a magnificent palace, accepted her conversion, and baptized her,  giving her a new name, Alexandra.    In Rome she was a brilliant but erratic personage, living sumptuously,  even though her revenues from Sweden came in slowly, partly because the  Swedes disliked her change of religion. She was surrounded by men of  letters, with whom she amused herself, and she took to herself a lover,  the Marquis Monaldeschi. She thought that at last she had really found  her true affinity, while Monaldeschi believed that he could count on  the queen's fidelity.    He was in attendance upon her daily, and they were almost inseparable.  He swore allegiance to her and thereby made himself one of the subjects  over whom she had absolute power. For a time he was the master of those  intense emotions which, in her, alternated with moods of coldness and  even cruelty.    Monaldeschi was a handsome Italian, who bore himself with a fine air of  breeding. He understood the art of charming, but he did not know that  beyond a certain time no one could hold the affections of Christina.    However, after she had quarreled with various cardinals and decided to  leave Rome for a while, Monaldeschi accompanied her to France, where  she had an immense vogue at the court of Louis XIV. She attracted wide  attention because of her eccentricity and utter lack of manners. It  gave her the greatest delight to criticize the ladies of the French  court--their looks, their gowns, and their jewels. They, in return,  would speak of Christina's deformed shoulder and skinny frame; but the  king was very gracious to her and invited her to his hunting-palace at  Fontainebleau.    While she had been winning triumphs of sarcasm the infatuated  Monaldeschi had gradually come to suspect, and then to know, that his  royal mistress was no longer true to him. He had been supplanted in her  favor by another Italian, one Sentanelli, who was the captain of her  guard.    Monaldeschi took a tortuous and roundabout revenge. He did not let the  queen know of his discovery; nor did he, like a man, send a challenge  to Sentanelli. Instead he began by betraying her secrets to Oliver  Cromwell, with whom she had tried to establish a correspondence. Again,  imitating the hand and seal of Sentanelli, he set in circulation a  series of the most scandalous and insulting letters about Christina. By  this treacherous trick he hoped to end the relations between his rival  and the queen; but when the letters were carried to Christina she  instantly recognized their true source. She saw that she was betrayed  by her former favorite and that he had taken a revenge which might  seriously compromise her.    This led to a tragedy, of which the facts were long obscure. They were  carefully recorded, however, by the queen's household chaplain, Father  Le Bel; and there is also a narrative written by one Marco Antonio  Conti, which confirms the story. Both were published privately in 1865,  with notes by Louis Lacour.    The narration of the priest is dreadful in its simplicity and  minuteness of detail. It may be summed up briefly here, because it is  the testimony of an eye-witness who knew Christina.    Christina, with the marquis and a large retinue, was at Fontainebleau  in November, 1657. A little after midnight, when all was still, the  priest, Father Le Bel, was aroused and ordered to go at once to the  Galerie des Cerfs, or Hall of Stags, in another part of the palace.  When he asked why, he was told:    \"It is by the order of her majesty the Swedish queen.\"    The priest, wondering, hurried on his garments. On reaching the gloomy  hall he saw the Marquis Monaldeschi, evidently in great agitation, and  at the end of the corridor the queen in somber robes. Beside the queen,  as if awaiting orders, stood three figures, who could with some  difficulty be made out as three soldiers of her guard.    The queen motioned to Father Le Bel and asked him for a packet which  she had given him for safe-keeping some little time before. He gave it  to her, and she opened it. In it were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4693"],[0,"Famous Affinities of History: The Romance of Devotion. Vol 1-4, Complete (#12)"],[1,"alliances. So Christina said, in her harsh, peremptory  voice:    \"I shall never marry; and why should you speak of my having children! I  am just as likely to give birth to a Nero as to an Augustus.\"    Having assumed the throne, she ruled with a strictness of government  such as Sweden had not known before. She took the reins of state into  her own hands and carried out a foreign policy of her own, over the  heads of her ministers, and even against the wishes of her people. The  fighting upon the Continent had dragged out to a weary length, but the  Swedes, on the whole, had scored a marked advantage. For this reason the  war was popular, and every one wished it to go on; but Christina, of  her own will, decided that it must stop, that mere glory was not to be  considered against material advantages. Sweden had had enough of glory;  she must now look to her enrichment and prosperity through the channels  of peace.    Therefore, in 1648, against Oxenstierna, against her generals, and  against her people, she exercised her royal power and brought the Thirty  Years' War to an end by the so-called Peace of Westphalia. At this time  she was twenty-two, and by her personal influence she had ended one of  the greatest struggles of history. Nor had she done it to her country's  loss.
