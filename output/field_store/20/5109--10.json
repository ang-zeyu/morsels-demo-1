HOW JOSEPH SMITH OBTAINED THE BOOK OF MORMON    The Book of Mormon was published in the town of Palmyra, Wayne County,  State of New York. It issued from the press of Mr. Egbert B. Grandin;  and was published for Joseph Smith, the Prophet. The exact date on  which the book issued from the press cannot be ascertained. Most  likely, however, it was some time in the month of March or of April,  1830; for in the Prophet's history we have him saying that, \"During  this month of April, I went on a visit to the residence of Mr. Joseph  Knight, of Colesville, Broome county, New York.\" This Mr. Knight had  been acquainted with the Smith family for some time. He had visited  them at their home near Manchester, New York, on several occasions; [1]  and during the period occupied in translating the Book of Mormon, had  rendered some material assistance to the Prophet by supplying him and  Oliver Cowdery with provisions. [2] Soon after this visit the Prophet  informs us that he returned to Fayette, Seneca county,--evidently in  the same month of April--and then adds:    \"The Book of Mormon * * * had now been published for some time, and  as the ancient prophets predicted of it, 'it was accounted a strange  thing.'\" [3] In the _Evening and Morning Star_ for April, 1833,  published at Independence, Missouri--the first periodical published by  the Church--occurs the following: \"Soon after the Book of Mormon came  forth, containing the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Church  was organized, on the 6th of April, 1830.\" [4] This fixes approximately  the date for the publication of the book. It issued from the press  either very early in April or in the month of March, 1830; most likely  some time in March. The first edition was five thousand copies.    Naturally enough the book was \"accounted a strange thing.\" Joseph  Smith, for whom it was published, was an unlettered young man, who  from the time he was ten years of age until the Book of Mormon was  published--when he was twenty-four--had lived in the vicinity of  Palmyra and Manchester townships. His father having met with a series  of misfortunes in business ventures and land purchases, the family was  in straitened circumstances through all these years, and Joseph had  been under the necessity of working among the farmers in and around  Manchester to aid his parents in the support of their large family.  About the last thing to be expected of a young man reared under such  circumstances would be that he become the publisher of a book. The  fact that he had published one was of itself sufficient cause for  astonishment; but it was not the fact that an unlettered youth, who  had spent his life in toil among them, had published a book that was  regarded as so strange a thing by the people. It was the account he  gave of the book's origin, and the nature of the book itself that  constituted it such a \"marvel and a wonder.\" Joseph Smith disclaimed  being its author [5] in any other sense than that he was the translator  of it by miraculous means. The original Book of Mormon, the translation  of which he had published, was written, or rather engraven, upon gold  plates, according to his representations; which plates had come into  his possession in the following manner:    Early in the spring of 1820 Joseph Smith received a revelation from God  in which the apostate condition of Christendom was made known to him,  coupled with a promise that at some future time the gospel of Jesus  Christ would be restored to the earth; and that he, if faithful, would  be an instrument in the hands of God in accomplishing some of his great  purposes in the last days. [6]    After this first revelation, Joseph Smith was left for three years  without any further direct manifestation from God. At the expiration  of that time, however, being oppressed with a sense of loneliness and  longing for further communication with the heavens, and burdened with  an anxious desire to know of his standing before the Lord, on the  evening of the 21st of September, 1823, after having retired for the  night, he betook himself to prayer that he might receive once more a  manifestation from God. The rest of the narrative is best told in his  own words:        While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a      light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the      room was lighter than at noon day, when immediately a personage      appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did      not touch the floor. He had on a loose robe of most exquisite      whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever      seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to      appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands were naked      and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were his      feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His neck      and head were also bare. I could discover that he had no other      clothing on but this robe, as it was open, so that I could see      into his bosom. Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his      whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance      truly like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so      very bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked      upon him, I was afraid; but the fear soon left me. He called me      by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the      presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had      a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and      evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should      be both good and evil spoken of among all people. He said there      was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account      of the former inhabitants of this continent, [7] and the source      from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the      everlasting gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior      to the ancient inhabitants [of America]; also that there were two      stones in silver bows--and these stones, fastened to a breastplate,      constituted what is called the Urim and Thummim--deposited with      the plates; and the possession and use of these stones were what      constituted seers in ancient or former times; and that God had      prepared them for the purpose of translating the book.        After telling me these things, he commenced quoting the prophecies      of the Old Testament. He first quoted part of the third chapter      of Malachi, [8] and he quoted also the fourth or last chapter of      the same prophecy, though with a little variation from the way it      reads in our Bible [the English authorized version of the Jewish      Scriptures]. Instead of quoting the first verse as it reads in our      books he quoted it thus: \"For behold, the day cometh that shall      burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly      shall burn as stubble; for they that come shall burn them saith the      Lord of hosts; that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.\"      And again, he quoted the fifth verse thus: \"Behold, I will reveal      unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah, the prophet,      before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.\" He      also quoted the next verse differently: \"And he shall plant in the      hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the      hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not      so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.\"        In addition to these, he quoted the eleventh chapter of Isaiah,      saying that it was about to be fulfilled.        He quoted also the third chapter of Acts, twenty-second and      twenty-third verses, precisely as they stand in our New Testament.      [9] He said that that prophet was Christ; but the day had not yet      come when \"they who would not hear his voice should be cut off from      among the people,\" but soon would come.        He also quoted the second chapter of Joel, from the twenty-eighth      verse to the last. He also said that this was not yet fulfilled,      but was soon to be. And he further stated, the fulness of the      Gentiles was soon to come in. He quoted many other passages of      scripture, and offered many explanations which cannot be mentioned      here. Again, he told me, that when I got the plates of which he      had spoken--for the time that they should be obtained was not      yet fulfilled--I should not show them to any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4732"],[0,"Prolegomena to the History of Israel (#12)"],[1,"Code.  ********************************    of course.  What follows from this for the question before us?  To my thinking, this:--that the Priestly Code rests  upon the result which is only the aim of Deuteronomy.  The latter  is in the midst of movement and conflict: it clearly speaks out  its reforming intention, its opposition to the traditional \"what we  do here this day;\" the former stands outside of and above the  struggle,--the end has been reached and made a secure possession.  On the basis of the Priestly Code no reformation would ever have  taken place, no Josiah would ever have observed from it that the  actual condition of affairs was perverse and required to be set  right; it proceeds as if everything had been for long in the best  of order.  It is only in Deuteronomy, moreover, that one sees to  the root of the matter, and recognises its connection with the  anxiety for a strict monotheism and for the elimination from the  worship of the popular heathenish elements, and thus with a deep  and really worthy aim; in the Priestly Code the reason of the  appointments, in themselves by no means rational, rests upon their  own legitimacy, just as everything that is actual ordinarily seems  natural and in no need of explanation.  Nowhere does it become  apparent that the abolition of the Bamoth and Asherim and memorial  stones is the real object contemplated; these institutions are  now almost unknown, and what is really only intelligible as a  negative and polemical ordinance is regarded as full of meaning in  itself.    The idea as idea is older than the idea as history.  In  Deuteronomy it appears in its native colours, comes forward with  its aggressive challenge to do battle with the actual.  One step  indeed is taken towards investing it with an historical character,  in so far as it is put into the mouth of Moses; but the beginning  thus made keeps within modest limits.  Moses only lays down the  law; for its execution he makes no provision as regards his own  time, nor does he demand it for the immediate future.  Rather it is  represented as not destined to come into force until the people  shall have concluded the conquest of the country and secured a  settled peace.  We have already found reason to surmise that the  reference to \"menuha\" is intended to defer the date when the Law  shall come into force to the days of David and Solomon (1Kings  viii.16).  This is all the more probable inasmuch as there is  required for its fulfilment \"the place which Jehovah shall choose,\"  by which only the capital of Judah can be meant.  Deuteronomy,  therefore, knows nothing of the principle that what ought to be  must actually have been from the beginning.  Until the building of  Solomon's temple the unity of worship according to it had,  properly speaking, never had any existence; and, moreover, it is  easy to read between the lines that even after that date it was  more a pious wish than a practical demand.  The Priestly Code, on  the other hand, is unable to think of religion without the one  sanctuary, and cannot for a moment imagine Israel without it,  carrying its actual existence back to the very beginning of the  theocracy, and, in accordance with this, completely altering the  ancient history.  The temple, the focus to which the worship was  concentrated, and which in reality was not built until Solomon's  time, is by this document regarded as so indispensable, even for  the troubled days of the wanderings before the settlement, that it  is made portable, and in the form of a tabernacle set up in the  very beginning of things.  For the truth is, that the tabernacle  is the copy, not the prototype, of the temple at Jerusalem.  The  resemblance of the two is indeed unmistakable, /1/    ****************************  1. In Wisdom of Solomon ix. 8 the temple is called MIMHMA SKHNHS  HAGIAS.  Josephus (Antiquities iii. 6,1) says of the tabernacle,  (H D'OUDEN METAFEROMENOU NAOU DIEFERE.  *******************************    but it is not said in 1Kings vi. that Solomon made use of the old  pattern and ordered his Tyrian workmen to follow it.  The posteriority  of the Mosaic structure comes into clearer light from the two following  considerations brought forward by Graf (p. 60 seq.).  In the first  place, in the description of the tabernacle mention is repeatedly  made of its south, north, and west side, without any preceding rubric  as to a definite and constantly uniform orientation; the latter is  tacitly taken for granted, being borrowed from that of the temple,  which was a fixed building, and did not change its site.  In the  second place, the brazen altar is, strictly speaking, described as  an altar of wood merely plated with brass,--for a fireplace of  very large size, upon which a strong fire continually burns, a  perfectly absurd construction, which is only to be accounted for  by the wish to make the brazen altar which Solomon cast (1Kings  xvi. 14) transportable, by changing its interior into wood.  The  main point, however, is this, that the tabernacle of the Priestly  Code in its essential meaning is not a mere provisional shelter for  the ark on the march, but the sole legitimate sanctuary for the  community of the twelve tribes prior to the days of Solomon, and  so in fact a projection of the later temple.  How modest, one might  almost say how awkwardly bashful, is the Deuteronomic reference  to the future place which Jehovah is to choose when compared with  this calm matter-of-fact assumption that the necessary centre of  unity of worship was given from the first!  In the one case we  have, so to speak, only the idea as it exists in the mind of the  lawgiver, but making no claim to be realised till a much later  date; in the other, the Mosaic idea has acquired also a Mosaic  embodiment, with which it entered the world at the very first.    By the same simple historical method which carries the central  sanctuary back into the period before Solomon does the Priestly  author abolish the other places of worship.  His forty-eight  Levitical cities are for the most part demonstrably a  metamorphosis of the old Bamoth to meet the exigencies of the time.  The altar which the tribes eastward of Jordan build (Josh. xxii.)  is erected with no intention that it should be used, but merely in  commemoration of something.  Even the pre-Mosaic period is rendered  orthodox in the same fashion.  The patriarchs, having no  tabernacle, have no worship at all; according to the Priestly  Code they build no altars, bring no offerings, and scrupulously  abstain from everything by which they might in any way encroach  on the privilege of the one true sanctuary.  This manner of shaping  the patriarchal history is only the extreme consequence of the  effort to carry out with uniformity in history the semper  ubique et ab omnibus of the legal unity of worship.    Thus in Deuteronomy the institution is only in its birth-throes,  and has still to struggle for the victory against the praxis of  the present, but in the Priestly Code claims immemorial legitimacy  and strives to bring the past into conformity with itself,  obviously because it already dominates the present; the carrying  back of the new into the olden time always takes place at a later  date than the ushering into existence of the new itself.  Deuteronomy has its position in the very midst of the historical  crisis, and still stands in a close relation with the older period  of worship, the conditions of which it can contest, but is unable  to ignore, and still less to deny.  But, on the other hand, the  Priestly Code is hindered by no survival to present times of the  older usage from projecting an image of antiquity such as it must  have been; unhampered by visible relics or living tradition of an  older state, it can idealise the past to its heart's content.  Its  place, then, is after Deuteronomy, and in the third post-exilian  period of the history of the cultus, in which, on the one hand,  the unity of the sanctuary was an established fact, contested by  no one and impugned by nothing, and in which, on the other hand,  the natural connection between the present and the past had been so  severed by the exile that there was no obstacle to prevent an  artificial and ideal repristination of the latter.      I.III.      The reverse of this is what is usually held.  In Deuteronomy, it  is considered, there occur clear references to the period of the  kings; but the Priestly Code, with its historical  presuppositions, does not fit in with any situation belonging to  that time, and is therefore older.  When the cultus rests upon the  temple of Solomon as its foundation, as in Ezekiel, then every one  recognises the later date; but when it is based upon the  tabernacle, the case is regarded as quite different.  The great  antiquity of the priestly legislation is proved by relegating it  to an historical sphere, created by itself out of its own legal  premisses, but which is nowhere to be found within, and therefore  must have preceded actual history.  Thus (so to speak) it holds  itself up in the air by its own waistband.    I.III.1. It may, however, seem as if hitherto it had only been  asserted that the tabernacle rests on an historical fiction.  In truth it is proved; but yet it may be well to add some things  which have indeed been said long before now, but never as yet  properly laid to heart.  The subject of discussion, be it  premised, is the tabernacle of the Priestly Code; for some kind  of tent for the ark there may well have been: in fact, tents were  in Palestine the earliest dwellings of idols (Hos. ix.6), and only  afterwards gave place to fixed houses; and even the Jehovistic  tradition (although not J) knows of a sacred tent /1/    *************************************  1. It is never, however, employed for legislative purposes,  but is simply a shelter for the ark; it stands without the camp,  as the oldest sanctuaries were wont to"]]]
