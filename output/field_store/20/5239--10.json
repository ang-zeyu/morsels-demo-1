And with Tuesday one came and washed his head with rose-water, and he  was worshipped again when they sang \"There is also Sheemish.\" And yet  was Chu-bu content, for he said, \"The head of Sheemish has been  defiled,\" and again, \"His head was defiled, it is enough.\" And one  evening lo! there was dirt on the head of Chu-bu also, and the thing  was perceived of Sheemish.    It is not with the gods as it is with men. We are angry one with  another and turn from our anger again, but the wrath of the gods is  enduring. Chu-bu remembered and Sheemish did not forget. They spake as  we do not speak, in silence yet heard of each other, nor were their  thoughts as our thoughts. We should not judge them merely by human  standards. All night long they spake and all night said these words  only: \"Dirty Chu-bu,\" \"Dirty Sheemish.\" \"Dirty Chu-bu,\" \"Dirty  Sheemish,\" all night long. Their wrath had not tired at dawn, and  neither had wearied of his accusation. And gradually Chu-bu came to  realize that he was nothing more than the equal of Sheemish. All gods  are jealous, but this equality with the upstart Sheemish, a thing of  painted wood a hundred years newer than Chu-bu, and this worship given  to Sheemish in Chu-bu's own temple, were particularly bitter. Chu-bu  was jealous even for a god; and when Tuesday came again, the third day  of Sheemish's worship, Chu-bu could bear it no longer. He felt that  his anger must be revealed at all costs, and he returned with all the  vehemence of his will to achieving a little earthquake. The  worshippers had just gone from his temple when Chu-bu settled his will  to attain this miracle. Now and then his meditations were disturbed by  that now familiar dictum, \"Dirty Chu-bu,\" but Chu-bu willed  ferociously, not even stopping to say what he longed to say and had  already said nine hundred times, and presently even these  interruptions ceased.    They ceased because Sheemish had returned to a project that he had  never definitely abandoned, the desire to assert himself and exalt  himself over Chu-bu by performing a miracle, and the district being  volcanic he had chosen a little earthquake as the miracle most easily  accomplished by a small god.    Now an earthquake that is commanded by two gods has double the chance  of fulfilment than when it is willed by one, and an incalculably  greater chance than when two gods are pulling different ways; as, to  take the case of older and greater gods, when the sun and the moon  pull in the same direction we have the biggest tides.    Chu-bu knew nothing of the theory of tides, and was too much occupied  with his miracle to notice what Sheemish was doing. And suddenly the  miracle was an accomplished thing.    It was a very local earthquake, for there are other gods than Chu-bu  or even Sheemish, and it was only a little one as the gods had willed,  but it loosened some monoliths in a colonnade that supported one side  of the temple and the whole of one wall fell in, and the low huts of  the people of that city were shaken a little and some of their doors  were jammed so that they would not open; it was enough, and for a  moment it seemed that it was all; neither Chu-bu nor Sheemish  commanded there should be more, but they had set in motion an old law  older than Chu-bu, the law of gravity that that colonnade had held  back for a hundred years, and the temple of Chu-bu quivered and then  stood still, swayed once and was overthrown, on the heads of Chu-bu  and Sheemish.    No one rebuilt it, for nobody dared to near such terrible gods. Some  said that Chu-bu wrought the miracle, but some said Sheemish, and  thereof schism was born. The weakly amiable, alarmed by the bitterness  of rival sects, sought compromise and said that both had wrought it,  but no one guessed the truth that the thing was done in rivalry.    And a saying arose, and both sects held this belief in common, that  whoso toucheth Chu-bu shall die or whoso looketh upon Sheemish.    That is how Chu-bu came into my possession when I travelled once  beyond the hills of Ting. I found him in the fallen temple of Chu-bu  with his hands and toes sticking up out of the rubbish, lying upon his  back, and in that attitude just as I found him I keep him to this day  on my mantlepiece, as he is less liable to be upset that way. Sheemish  was broken, so I left him where he was.    And there is something so helpless about Chu-bu with his fat hands  stuck up in the air that sometimes I am moved out of compassion to bow  down to him and pray, saying, \"O Chu-bu, thou that made everything,  help thy servant.\"    Chu-bu cannot do much, though once I am sure that at a game of bridge  he sent me the ace of trumps after I had not held a card worth having  for the whole of the evening. And chance alone could have done as much  as that for me. But I do not tell this to Chu-bu.        THE WONDERFUL WINDOW      The old man in the Oriental-looking robe was being moved on by the  police, and it was this that attracted to him and the parcel under his  arm the attention of Mr. Sladden, whose livelihood was earned in the  emporium of Messrs. Mergin and Chater, that is to say in their  establishment.    Mr. Sladden had the reputation of being the silliest young man in  Business; a touch of romance--a mere suggestion of it--would send his  eyes gazing away as though the walls of the emporium were of gossamer  and London itself a myth, instead of attending to customers.    Merely the fact that the dirty piece of paper that wrapped the old  man's parcel was covered with Arabic writing was enough to give Mr.  Sladden the idea of romance, and he followed until the little crowd  fell off and the stranger stopped by the kerb and unwrapped his parcel  and prepared to sell the thing that was inside it. It was a little  window in old wood with small panes set in lead; it was not much more  than a foot in breadth and was under two feet long. Mr. Sladden had  never before seen a window sold in the street, so he asked the price  of it.    \"Its price is all you possess,\" said the old man.    \"Where did you get it?\" said Mr. Sladden, for it was a strange window.    \"I gave all that I possessed for it in the streets of Baghdad.\"    \"Did you possess much?\" said Mr. Sladden.    \"I had all that I wanted,\" he said, \"except this window.\"    \"It must be a good window,\" said the young man.    \"It is a magical window,\" said the old one.    \"I have only ten shillings on me, but I have fifteen-and-six at home.\"    The old man thought for a while.    \"Then twenty-five-and-sixpence is the price of the window,\" he said.    It was only when the bargain was completed and the ten shillings paid  and the strange old man was coming for his fifteen-and-six and to fit  the magical window into his only room that it occurred to Mr.  Sladden's mind that he did not want a window. And then they were at  the door of the house in which he rented a room, and it seemed too  late to explain.    The stranger demanded privacy when he fitted up the window, so Mr.  Sladden remained outside the door at the top of a little flight of  creaky stairs. He heard no sound of hammering.    And presently the strange old man came out with his faded yellow robe  and his great beard, and his eyes on far-off places. \"It is finished,\"  he said, and he and the young man parted. And whether he remained a  spot of colour and an anachronism in London, or whether he ever came  again to Baghdad, and what dark hands kept on the circulation of his  twenty-five-and-six, Mr. Sladden never knew.    Mr. Sladden entered the bare-boarded room in which he slept and spent  all his indoor hours between closing-time and the hour at which  Messrs. Mergin and Chater commenced. To the Penates of so dingy a room  his neat frock-coat must have been a continual wonder. Mr. Sladden  took it off and folded it carefully; and there was the old man's  window rather high up in the wall. There had been no window in that  wall hitherto, nor any ornament at all but a small cupboard, so when  Mr. Sladden had put his frock-coat safely away he glanced through his  new window. It was where his cupboard had been in which he kept his  tea-things: they were all standing on the table now. When Mr. Sladden  glanced through his new window it was late in a summer's evening; the  butterflies some while ago would have closed their wings, though the  bat would scarcely yet be drifting abroad--but this was in London: the  shops were shut and street-lamps not yet lighted.    Mr. Sladden rubbed his eyes, then rubbed the window, and still he saw  a sky of blazing blue, and far, far down beneath him, so that no sound  came up from it or smoke of chimneys, a mediaeval city set with  towers; brown roofs and cobbled streets, and then white walls and  buttresses, and beyond them bright green fields and tiny streams. On  the towers archers lolled, and along the walls were pikemen, and now  and then a wagon went down some old-world street and lumbered through  the gateway and out to the country, and now and then a wagon drew up  to the city from the mist that was rolling with evening over the  fields. Sometimes folks put their heads out of lattice windows,  sometimes some idle troubadour seemed to sing, and nobody hurried or  troubled about anything. Airy and dizzy though the distance was, for  Mr. Sladden seemed higher above the city than any cathedral gargoyle,  yet one clear detail he obtained as a clue: the banners floating from  every tower over the idle archers had little golden dragons all over a  pure white field.    He heard motor-buses roar by his other window, he heard the newsboys  howling.    Mr. Sladden grew dreamier than ever after that on the premises, in the  establishment of Messrs. Mergin and Chater. But in one matter he was  wise and wakeful: he made continuous and careful inquiries about the  golden dragons on a white flag, and talked to no one of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7498"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Grown Up (#12)"],[1,"e, then turned off  abruptly. \"You are sure you won't bother yourself too much with  Charlotte?\" he said awkwardly coming back.    \"Yes; don't worry, Jasper,\" said Polly, wondering at his unusual manner.    \"All right; then as soon as I've seen father I'll throw my traps  together and be off,\" declared Jasper, quite like the business man  again.    But old Mr. King was not to hear about it just then, for when Jasper  rapped at his door, it was to find that his father was fast asleep.    \"See here, Jasper,\" said Mr. Whitney, happening along at this minute,  \"here's a nice piece of work. Percy declares that he shall be made  miserable to go back to college to-morrow. His mother is able now for  him to be settled at his studies; won't you run up and persuade  him--that's a good fellow.\"    \"I'm going back to my work to-night,\" cried Jasper, pulling out his  watch, \"that is, if father wakes up in time for me to take the train.\"    \"Is that so? Good,\" cried Mr. Whitney. \"Well, run along and tell Percy  that, for the boy is so worried over his mother that he can't listen to  reason.\"    So Jasper scaled the stairs to Percy's den.    \"Well, old fellow, I thought I'd come up and let you know that I'm off  to my work,\" announced Jasper, putting his head in the doorway.    \"Eh!\" cried Percy, \"what's that?\"    \"Why, I'm off, I say; back to dig at the publishing business. Your  mother doesn't want us fellows hanging around here any longer. It  worries her to feel that we are idling.\"    \"Is that so?\" cried Percy. \"How do you know?\"    \"Polly says so; she let me into the secret; says sister Marian requested  me to go back.\"    \"Did Polly really say so?\" demanded Percy in astonishment.    \"Yes, in good plain English. So I'm off.\"    \"Well, if Polly really said that mamma wanted you to go, why, I'll get  back to college as soon as I can,\" said Percy. \"But if she should be  worse?\" He stopped short.    \"They can send for you instantly; trust Polly for that,\" said Jasper.  \"But she won't be worse; not unless we worry her by not doing as she  wishes. Well, good-by, I'm off.\"    \"So am I,\" declared Percy, springing up to throw his clothes into  traveling order. \"All right, I'll take the train with you, Jappy.\"    \"Now you see how much better I'm off,\" observed Van, coming in to perch  on the edge of the bed while Percy was hurrying all sorts of garments  into the trunk with a quick hand. \"I tell you, Percy, I struck good luck  when I chose father's business. Now I don't have to run like a dog at  the beck of a lot of professors.\"    \"Every one to his taste,\" said Percy, \"and I can't bear father's  business, for one.\"    \"No, you'd rather sit up with your glasses stuck on your nose, and learn  how to dole out the law; that's you, Percy. I say, I wouldn't try to  keep the things on,\" with a laugh as he saw his brother's ineffectual  efforts to pack, and yet give the attention to his eyeglasses that they  seemed to demand.    \"See here now, Van,\" cried Percy warmly, \"if you cannot help, you can  take yourself off. Goodness! I have left out my box of collars!\"    \"Here it is,\" cried Van, throwing it to him from the bed, where it had  rolled off under a pile of underclothing. \"Well, you don't know how the  things make you look. And Polly doesn't like them a bit.\"    \"How do you know?\" demanded Percy, growing quite red, and desisting from  his employment a minute.    \"Oh, that's telling; I know she doesn't,\" replied Van provokingly.    For answer Van felt his arms seized, and before he knew it Percy was  over him and holding him down so that he couldn't stir.    \"Now how do you know that Polly doesn't like my eyeglasses?\" he  demanded.    \"Ow--let me up!\" cried Van.    \"Tell on, then. How do you know she doesn't like them?\"    \"Because--Let me up, and I'll tell.\"    \"No, tell now,\" said Percy, having hard work to keep Van from slipping  out from under his hands.    \"Boys,\" called Polly's voice.    \"Oh dear me--she's coming!\" exclaimed Percy, jumping to his feet, and  releasing Van, who, red and shining, skipped to the door. \"Come in,  Polly.\"    \"I thought I'd find you up here,\" said Polly in great satisfaction.  \"Percy, can't I do something for you? Jasper says you are going back to  college right away.\"    \"Yes, you can,\" said Percy, \"take Van off; that would help me more than  anything else you could do.\"    Polly looked at Van and shook her brown head so disapprovingly that he  came out of his laugh.    \"Oh, I'll be good, Polly,\" he promised.    \"See that you are, then,\" she said. Then she went over to the trunk and  looked in.    \"Percy, may I take those things out and fold them over again?\" she  asked.    \"Yes, if you want to,\" said Percy shamefacedly. \"I suppose I have made a  mess of them; but it's too hard work for you, Polly.\"    \"I should like nothing better than to attack that trunk,\" declared Polly  merrily. \"Now, Van, you come and help me, that's a dear boy.\"    And in five minutes Polly and Van were busily working together; he  putting in the things, while she neatly made them into piles, and Percy  sorted and gave orders like a general.    \"He does strut around so,\" said Van under his breath, \"just see him  now.\"    \"Hush--oh, Van, how can you? and he's going back to college, and you  won't see him for ever so many weeks.\"    Van swallowed something in his throat, and bent all his energies to  settling the different articles in the trunk.    \"Percy,\" said Polly presently in a lull, \"I do just envy you for one  thing.\"    \"What for, pray?\" asked Percy, settling his beloved eyeglasses for a  better view of her.    \"Why, you'll be with Joel and Davie,\" said Polly. \"Oh, you don't know  how I miss those boys!\" She rested both hands on the trunk edge as she  knelt before it.    [Illustration: \"OH, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I MISS THOSE BOYS!\" ]    \"I wish you'd been our sister,\" said Van enviously, \"then we'd have had  good times always.\"    \"Oh, I don't see much of Joel,\" said Percy. \"Dave once in a while I run  across, but Joel--dear me!\"    \"You don't see much of Joel,\" repeated Polly, her hands dropping  suddenly in astonishment. \"Why, Percy Whitney, why not, pray tell?\"    \"Why, Joel's awful good--got a streak of going into the prayer-meetings  and that sort of thing,\" explained Percy, \"and we call him Deacon Pepper  in the class.\"    \"He goes to prayer-meetings, and you call him Deacon Pepper,\" repeated  Polly in amazement, while Van burst out into a fit of amusement.    \"Yes,\" said Percy, \"and he has a lot of old fogies always turning up  that want help, and all such stuff, and I expect that he is going to be  a minister.\"    He brought this out as something too dreadful to be spoken, and then  fell back to see the effect of his words.    \"Can you suppose it?\" cried Polly under her breath, still kneeling on  the floor, \"oh, boys, can you?\" looking from one to the other.    \"Yes; I'm afraid it's true,\" said Percy, feeling that he ought to be  thrashed for having told her, while Van laughed again.    \"Oh--oh! it's too lovely. Dear, beautiful, old Joel!\" cried Polly,  springing suddenly to her feet; \"just think how good he is, boys! Oh,  it's too lovely to be true!\"    Percy retreated a few steps hastily.    \"And oh, how much better we ought to be,\" cried Polly in a rush of  feeling. \"Just think, with Joel doing such beautiful things, oh, how  glad Mamsie will be! And he never told--Joel never told.\"    \"And he'll just about kill me if you tell him I've let it out,\" said  Percy abruptly. \"Oh, dear me, how he'll pitch into me!\" exclaimed Percy  in alarm.    \"I never shall speak of it,\" declared Polly in a rapture, \"because Joel  always hated to be praised for being good. But oh, how lovely it is!\"    And then Grandpapa called, and she ran off on happy feet.    \"Whew!\" exclaimed Percy, with a look over at Van.    \"I tell you what, if you want to get into Polly's good graces, you've  just got to brush up on your catechism, and such things,\" remarked Van;  \"eyeglasses don't count.\"    Percy turned off uneasily.    \"Nor suppers, and a bit of card-playing, eh, Percy?\"    \"Hold your tongue, will you?\" cried his brother irritably.    \"Nor swell clothes and a touch-me-if-you-dare manner,\" said Van  mockingly, sticking his fingers in his vest pockets.    Percy made a lunge at him, then thought better of it.    \"Leave me alone, can't you?\" he said crossly.    Van opened his mouth to toss back a teasing reply, when Percy opened up  on him. \"I'd as soon take my chances with her, on the suppers and other  things, as to have yours. What would Polly say to see you going for me  like this, I'd like to know?\"    It was now Van's turn to look uncomfortable, and he cast a glance at the  door.    \"Oh, she may come in,\" said Percy, bursting into a laugh, \"then you'd be  in a fine fix; and I wouldn't give a rush for the good opinion she'd  have of you.\"    Van hung his head, took two or three steps to the door, then came back  hurriedly.    \"I cry 'Quits,' Percy,\" he said, and held out his hand.    \"All right,\" said Percy, smoothing down his ruffled feelings, and  putting out his hand too.    Van seized it, wrung it in good brotherly fashion, then raced over the  stairs at a breakneck pace.    \"Polly\", he said, meeting her in the hall where she had just come from  Mr. King's room, \"I've been blackguarding Percy, and you ought to know  it.\"    \"Oh, Van!\" cried Polly, stopping short in a sorry little way; \"why,  you've been so good ever since you both promised years ago that you  wouldn't say bad things to each other.\"    \"Oh, that was different,\" said Van recklessly; \"but since he went to  college, Percy has been a perfect snob Polly.\"    Polly said nothing, only looked at him in a way that cut him to the  heart, as she moved off slowly.    \"Aren't you going to say anything?\" asked Van at last.    \"I've nothing to say,\" replied Polly, and she disappeared into Mrs.  Whitney's room and closed the door.    That evening Jasper and Percy, who went"]]]
