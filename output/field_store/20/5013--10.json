I merely lifted my hat in a non-committing fashion.    \"Are you going to cut me, I wonder?\" I said to myself. She answered the  unspoken question as I hoped it would be answered.    \"Mr. Garnet,\" she said, stopping at the end of the bridge. A pause.    \"I couldn't tell you so before, but I am so sorry this has happened.\"    \"Oh, thanks awfully,\" I said, realising as I said it the miserable  inadequacy of the English language. At a crisis when I would have given  a month's income to have said something neat, epigrammatic, suggestive,  yet withal courteous and respectful, I could only find a hackneyed,  unenthusiastic phrase which I should have used in accepting an  invitation from a bore to lunch with him at his club.    \"Of course you understand my friends--must be my father's friends.\"    \"Yes,\" I said gloomily, \"I suppose so.\"    \"So you must not think me rude if I--I----\"    \"Cut me,\" said I, with masculine coarseness.    \"Don't seem to see you,\" said she, with feminine delicacy, \"when I am  with my father. You will understand?\"    \"I shall understand.\"    \"You see,\"--she smiled--\"you are under arrest, as Tom says.\"    Tom!    \"I see,\" I said.    \"Good-bye.\"    \"Good-bye.\"    I watched her out of sight, and went on to interview Mr. Leigh.    We had a long and intensely uninteresting conversation about the  maladies to which chickens are subject. He was verbose and reminiscent.  He took me over his farm, pointing out as we went Dorkings with pasts,  and Cochin Chinas which he had cured of diseases generally fatal on, as  far as I could gather, Christian Science principles.    I left at last with instructions to paint the throats of the stricken  birds with turpentine--a task imagination boggled at, and one which I  proposed to leave exclusively to Ukridge and the Hired Retainer--and  also a slight headache. A visit to the Cob would, I thought, do me  good. I had missed my bathe that morning, and was in need of a breath  of sea-air.    It was high-tide, and there was deep water on three sides of the Cob.    In a small boat in the offing Professor Derrick appeared, fishing. I  had seen him engaged in this pursuit once or twice before. His only  companion was a gigantic boatman, by name Harry Hawk, possibly a  descendant of the gentleman of that name who went to Widdicombe Fair  with Bill Brewer and old Uncle Tom Cobley and all on a certain  memorable occasion, and assisted at the fatal accident to Tom Pearse's  grey mare.    I sat on the seat at the end of the Cob and watched the professor. It  was an instructive sight, an object-lesson to those who hold that  optimism has died out of the race. I had never seen him catch a fish.  He never looked to me as if he were at all likely to catch a fish. Yet  he persevered.    There are few things more restful than to watch some one else busy  under a warm sun. As I sat there, my pipe drawing nicely as the result  of certain explorations conducted that morning with a straw, my mind  ranged idly over large subjects and small. I thought of love and  chicken-farming. I mused on the immortality of the soul and the  deplorable speed at which two ounces of tobacco disappeared. In the end  I always returned to the professor. Sitting, as I did, with my back to  the beach, I could see nothing but his boat. It had the ocean to itself.    I began to ponder over the professor. I wondered dreamily if he were  very hot. I tried to picture his boyhood. I speculated on his future,  and the pleasure he extracted from life.    It was only when I heard him call out to Hawk to be careful, when a  movement on the part of that oarsman set the boat rocking, that I began  to weave romances round him in which I myself figured.    But, once started, I progressed rapidly. I imagined a sudden upset.  Professor struggling in water. Myself (heroically): \"Courage! I'm  coming!\" A few rapid strokes. Saved! Sequel, a subdued professor,  dripping salt water and tears of gratitude, urging me to become his  son-in-law. That sort of thing happened in fiction. It was a shame that  it should not happen in real life. In my hot youth I once had seven  stories in seven weekly penny papers in the same month, all dealing  with a situation of the kind. Only the details differed. In \"Not really  a Coward\" Vincent Devereux had rescued the earl's daughter from a fire,  whereas in \"Hilda's Hero\" it was the peppery old father whom Tom  Slingsby saved. Singularly enough, from drowning. In other words, I, a  very mediocre scribbler, had effected seven times in a single month  what the Powers of the Universe could not manage once, even on the  smallest scale.     * * * * *    It was precisely three minutes to twelve--I had just consulted my  watch--that the great idea surged into my brain. At four minutes to  twelve I had been grumbling impotently at Providence. By two minutes to  twelve I had determined upon a manly and independent course of action.    Briefly it was this. Providence had failed to give satisfaction. I  would, therefore, cease any connection with it, and start a rival  business on my own account. After all, if you want a thing done well,  you must do it yourself.    In other words, since a dramatic accident and rescue would not happen  of its own accord, I would arrange one for myself. Hawk looked to me  the sort of man who would do anything in a friendly way for a few  shillings.    I had now to fight it out with Conscience. I quote the brief report  which subsequently appeared in the _Recording Angel_:--     * * * * *    _Three-Round Contest_: CONSCIENCE (Celestial B.C.) v. J. GARNET  (Unattached).    _Round One_.--Conscience came to the scratch smiling and confident. Led  off lightly with a statement that it would be bad for a man of the  professor's age to get wet. Garnet countered heavily, alluding to the  warmth of the weather and the fact that the professor habitually  enjoyed a bathe every day. Much sparring, Conscience not quite so  confident, and apparently afraid to come to close quarters with this  man. Time called, with little damage done.    _Round Two_.--Conscience, much freshened by the half minute's rest,  feinted with the charge of deceitfulness, and nearly got home heavily  with \"What would Phyllis say if she knew?\" Garnet, however,  side-stepped cleverly with \"But she won't know,\" and followed up the  advantage with a damaging, \"Besides, it's all for the best.\" The round  ended with a brisk rally on general principles, Garnet crowding in a  lot of work. Conscience down twice, and only saved by the call of time.    _Round Three (and last)_.--Conscience came up very weak, and with  Garnet as strong as ever it was plain that the round would be a brief  one. This proved to be the case. Early in the second minute Garnet  cross-countered with \"All's Fair in Love and War.\" Conscience down and  out. The winner left the ring without a mark.     * * * * *    I rose, feeling much refreshed.    That afternoon I interviewed Mr. Hawk in the bar-parlour of the Net and  Mackerel.    \"Hawk,\" I said to him darkly, over a mystic and conspirator-like pot of  ale, \"I want you, next time you take Professor Derrick out  fishing\"--here I glanced round, to make sure that we were not  overheard--\"to upset him.\"    His astonished face rose slowly from the pot of ale like a full moon.    \"What 'ud I do that for?\" he gasped.    \"Five shillings, I hope,\" said I, \"but I am prepared to go to ten.\"    He gurgled.    I encored his pot of ale.    He kept on gurgling.    I argued with the man.    I spoke splendidly. I was eloquent, but at the same time concise. My  choice of words was superb. I crystallised my ideas into pithy  sentences which a child could have understood.    And at the end of half-an-hour he had grasped the salient points of the  scheme. Also he imagined that I wished the professor upset by way of a  practical joke. He gave me to understand that this was the type of  humour which was to be expected from a gentleman from London. I am  afraid he must at one period in his career have lived at one of those  watering-places at which trippers congregate. He did not seem to think  highly of the Londoner.    I let it rest at that. I could not give my true reason, and this served  as well as any.     * * * * *    At the last moment he recollected that he, too, would get wet when the  accident took place, and he raised the price to a sovereign.    A mercenary man. It is painful to see how rapidly the old simple spirit  is dying out of our rural districts. Twenty years ago a fisherman would  have been charmed to do a little job like that for a screw of tobacco.        CHAPTER XI    THE BRAVE PRESERVER    I could have wished, during the next few days, that Mr. Harry Hawk's  attitude towards myself had not been so unctuously confidential and  mysterious. It was unnecessary, in my opinion, for him to grin  meaningly when he met me in the street. His sly wink when we passed  each other on the Cob struck me as in indifferent taste. The thing had  been definitely arranged (ten shillings down and ten when it was over),  and there was no need for any cloak and dark-lantern effects. I  objected strongly to being treated as the villain of a melodrama. I was  merely an ordinary well-meaning man, forced by circumstances into doing  the work of Providence. Mr. Hawk's demeanour seemed to say, \"We are two  reckless scoundrels, but bless you, _I_ won't give away your guilty  secret.\" The climax came one morning as I was going along the street  towards the beach. I was passing a dark doorway, when out shimmered Mr.  Hawk as if he had been a spectre instead of the most substantial man  within a radius of ten miles.    \"'St!\" He whispered.    \"Now look here, Hawk,\" I said wrathfully, for the start he had given me  had made me bite my tongue, \"this has got to stop. I refuse to be  haunted in this way. What is it now?\"    \"Mr. Derrick goes out this morning, zur.\"    \"Thank goodness for that,\" I said. \"Get it over this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38290"],[0,"Speciation and Evolution of the Pygmy Mice, Genus Baiomys (#12)"],[1,"different from those of pygmy mice  studied from Guerrero. He (_loc. cit._) concluded that: (1) if the  specimens of pygmy mice from central Guerrero were typical of the  subspecies _musculus_, then _pallidus_ did not deserve subspecific  recognition, or; (2) the name _B. m. musculus_ should be restricted to  the larger pygmy mice inhabiting the lowlands immediately adjacent to  the Pacific Coast and the area to the north. My data (see Figure 12)  show pygmy mice from southwestern Nayarit, northwestern and central  Jalisco, Colima, and parts of Michoacan to be significantly larger in  certain cranial and external measurements than pygmy mice from Guerrero,  Oaxaca, Morelos, and parts of Puebla. This finding essentially  corroborates Hooper's (1952a:96) findings. It seems advisable,  therefore, to restrict the range of _B. musculus musculus_ to the large  mice inhabiting west-central Mexico and the coastal lowlands of Colima  and Michoacan. The name _pallidus_ is applicable to the smaller mice  occupying Morelos, southwestern Puebla, Guerrero, Oaxaca, and  southwestern Chiapas.    _B. m. musculus_ intergrades with _B. m. pallidus_ in eastern Michoacan  and central and western Guerrero. Specimens from San Jose Prura and 12  mi.

Coll.); Valley of Comitan, Chiapas, Republic of Mexico, obtained  on December 9, 1895, by E. W. Nelson and E. A. Goldman, original number  8719.    _Range._--Southern coastal region and eastern parts of Chiapas,  southeastward into central and southern Guatemala, thence south into El  Salvador (see Figure 10). Zonal range: parts of Lower Austral; also  occurs in parts of the arid division of the Upper Tropical Life-zone,  and in parts of the arid division of the Lower Tropical Life-zone;  approximates a part of the Chiapas Highlands Biotic Province of Goldman  and Moore (1945:349), and parts of the Guatemalan Subregion of Smith  (1949:235).    _Diagnosis._--Size medium to small for the species; dorsum Vandyke Brown  mixed with blackish, individual hairs black-tipped with a subterminal  band of Warm Buff, Neutral Gray at base; guard hairs of dorsum black  distally, Neutral Gray basally; hairs on sides grayish-brown, facial  region like dorsum; chin buffy-brown; vibrissae brown, ventrally some  white; venter creamy-buff to grayish, individual hairs creamy-buff at  tips, gray basally; in region of throat and chin, hairs tipped with  Ochraceous-Buff; dorsal surface of forefeet and hind feet dull whitish  gray to brownish-black; tail indistinctly bicolored, dusky above,  grayish to brownish below; incisive foramina short, wide medially;  average and extreme external and cranial measurements of 15 adults from  6 mi. NW Tonala, Chiapas, are as follows: total length, 107.5 (100-116);  length of tail vertebrae, 41.1 (33-48); length of body, 66.1 (62-73);  length of hind foot, 15.0 (14-16); length of ear, 10.9 (10-12);  occipitonasal length, 18.9 (18.4-19.7); zygomatic breadth, 9.8  (9.4-10.2); postpalatal length, 6.9 (6.6-7.4); least interorbital  breadth, 3.7 (3.5-3.8); length of incisive foramina, 4.4 (4.1-4.8);  length of rostrum, 6.7 (6.1-7.1); breadth of braincase, 9.2 (9.0-9.4);  depth of cranium, 6.9 (6.5-7.3); alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row,  3.1 (2.9-3.2); for photographs of skull, see Plate 1_f_, and Plate 3_f_.    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. m. handleyi_, _B. m.  grisescens_, _B. m. musculus_, _B. m. pallidus_, and _B. m. pullus_, see  accounts of those subspecies.    From _B. m. brunneus_, _B. m. nigrescens_ differs in: dorsum  blackish-brown rather than reddish to ochraceous brown; face and ears  brownish-black rather than brownish with tinges of ochraceous; vibrissae  darker; forefeet and hind feet darker; venter with more grayish tones;  dorsalmost part of zygomatic plate projects farther anteriorly;  interparietal oval to diamond-shaped and narrower anteroposteriorly;  zygomata narrower at anteriormost part; slightly smaller in most cranial  and external measurements.    From _B. m. infernatis_, _B. m. nigrescens_ differs in: dorsum darker;  region of face and ears darker; venter buffy to gray rather than  whitish-buff; vibrissae darker; forefeet and hind feet darker; tail  darker above and below; incisive foramina shorter, more constricted  laterally; cranium slightly smaller in most dimensions.    _Remarks._--Hooper (1952a:93-94) reported specimens from the coastal  strip of southern Chiapas as the most intensely pigmented, whereas,  specimens from central and western Chiapas were distinctly paler. Crania  of specimens from the coastal region of southern Chiapas were smaller  than crania from the central highlands and mountains of Chiapas. My  studies essentially corroborate the findings of Hooper. The gradation of  color between the pale brown _pallidus_ to the north in Oaxaca, and the  brownish-black _nigrescens_ to the south in Chiapas is extremely  gradual. Specimens from the central and western parts of Chiapas (see  Figure 10 for localities) are difficult to assign to either _pallidus_  or _nigrescens_. Equal justification exists for assignment to either  subspecies. I have assigned the specimens to _nigrescens_ because they  are geographically closer to the type locality of _nigrescens_.  Specimens from Reforma, Oaxaca (assigned by Hooper, 1952a:93-94, to  _nigrescens_), are nearly identical in size and color to paratypes of  _pallidus_. I assign the Reforma specimens to _pallidus_.    The darkest of all the specimens examined and assigned to _nigrescens_  are from 1 mi. NW San Salvador and 1 mi. S Los Planes, El Salvador. The  variations in color in this subspecies closely correspond to degree of  relative humidity; the palest samples are from areas of low relative  humidity and the darkest are from areas of high relative humidity. In  view of the present state of differentiation of specimens from the  southern coastal areas of Chiapas and mountainous areas of El Salvador,  it would seem that populations there might be incipient subspecies.    _Specimens examined._--Total 319.
