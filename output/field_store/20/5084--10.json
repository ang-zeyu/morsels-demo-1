Chaste love is that when thou askest of God neither releasing of  pain, nor increasing of meed, nor yet sweetness in His love in this  life; but if it be any certain time that thou covetest sweetness as  for a refreshing of thy ghostly mights, that they fail not in the  way; but thou askest of God nought but Himself, and neither thou  reckest nor lookest after whether thou shalt be in pain or in bliss,  so that thou have Him that thou lovest--this is chaste love, this is  perfect love.[210] And therefore shape thee for to depart the fruit  from the tree; that is to say, this reverent affection from the  thoughts of dread and of hope coming before; so that thou mayst  offer it ripe and chaste unto God by itself, not caused of any thing  beneath Him, or medled with Him[211] (yea, though all it be the  chief),[212] but only of Him, by Himself; and then it is so meedful  as I say that it is. For it is plainly known without any doubt unto  all those that are expert in the science of divinity and of God's  love, that as often as a man's affection is stirred unto God without  mean (that is, without messenger of any thought in special causing  that stirring), as oft it deserveth everlasting life. And for that  that a soul that is thus disposed (that is to say, that offreth the  fruit ripe, and departed from the tree) may innumerable times in one  hour be raised in to God suddenly without mean, therefore more than  I can say it deserveth, through the grace of God, the which is the  chief worker, to be raised in to joy. And therefore shape thee for  to offer the fruit ripe and departed from the tree. Nevertheless,  the fruit upon the tree, continually offered as man's frailty will  suffer, deserveth salvation; but the fruit ripe and departed from  the tree, suddenly offered unto God without mean, that is  perfection. And here mayst thou see that the tree is good, though  all that I bid thee depart the fruit therefrom, for more perfection;  and therefore I set it in thy garden; for I would that thou should  gather the fruit thereof, and keep it to thy Lord. And for that that  I would that thou knew what manner of working it is that knitteth  man's soul to God, and that maketh it one with Him in love and  accordance of will,[213] after the word of saint Paul saying thus:  Qui adhaeret Duo unus spiritus est cum illo;214 that is to say: \"Who  so draweth near to God,\" as it is by such a reverent affection  touched before, \"he is one spirit with God.\" That is, though all  that God and he be two and sere[215] in kind, nevertheless yet in  grace they are so knit together that they are but one in  spirit;[216] and all this is for onehead of love and accordance of  will; and in this onehead is the marriage made between God and the  soul, the which shall never be broken, though all that the heat and  the fervour of this work cease for a time, but by a deadly sin.    In the ghostly feeling of this onehead may a loving soul both say  and sing (if it list) this holy word that is written in the book of  songs in the Bible: Dilectus meus mihi et ego illi;217 that is: \"My  loved unto me and I unto Him\"; understanden that God shall be  knitted with the ghostly glue of grace on His party, and the lovely  consent in gladness of spirit on thy party.    And therefore climb up by this tree, as I said in the beginning; and  when thou comest to the fruit (that is, to the reverent affection,  the which ever will be in thee if thou think heartily the other two  thoughts before, and fage[218] not thyself with no lie, as I said),  then shalt thou take good keep[219] of that working that is made in  thy soul that time, and shape thee, in as much as thou mayst through  grace, for to meek thee under the height of thy God, so that thou  mayst use thee in that working other times by itself, without any  climbing thereto by any thought. And, sikerly, this is it the which  is so meedful as I said, and ever the longer that it is kept from  the tree (that is to say, from any thought), and ever the ofter that  it is done suddenly, lustily, and likingly, without mean, the  sweeter it smelleth, and the better it pleaseth the high King of  heaven. And ever when thou feelest sweetness and comfort in thy  doing, then He breaketh this fruit and giveth thee part of thine own  present. And that that thou feelest is so hard, and so straitly  stressing thine heart without comfort in the first beginning, that  bemeaneth[220] that the greenness of the fruit hanging on the tree,  or else newly pulled, setteth thy teeth on edge. Nevertheless yet it  is speedful to thee. For it is no reason that thou eat the sweet  kernel, but if thou crack first the hard shell and bite of the  bitter bark.    Nevertheless, if it so be that thy teeth be weak (that is to say,  thy ghostly mights), then it is my counsel that thou seek slights,  for better is list than lither strength.[221]    Another skill there is why that I set this tree in thy garden, for  to climb up thereby. For though all it be so that God may do what He  will, yet, to mine understanding, it is impossible any man to attain  to the perfection of this working without these two means, or else  other two that are according to them coming before. And yet is the  perfection of this work sudden, without any mean. And, therefore, I  rede[222] thee that these be thine, not thine in propriety, for that  is nought but sin,[223] but thine given graciously of God, and sent  by me as a messenger though I be unworthy; for wete thou right well  that every thought that stirreth thee to the good,[224] whether it  come from within by thine angel messenger, or from without by any  man messenger, it is but an instrument of grace given, sent and  chosen of God Himself for to work within in thy soul. And this is  the skill why that I counsel thee to take these two thoughts before  all others. For as man is a mingled thing of two substances, a  bodily and a ghostly, so it needeth for to have two sere[225] means  to come by to perfection;[226] sith it so is that both these  substances shall be oned in undeadliness at the uprising in the last  day; so that either substance be raised to perfection in this life,  by a mean accordant thereto. And that is dread to bodily substance,  and hope to the ghostly. And thus it is full seemly and according to  be, as me thinketh; for as there is nothing that so soon will ravish  the body from all affection of earthly things, as will a sensible  dread of the death; so there is nothing that so soon nor so  fervently will raise the affection of a sinner's soul, unto the love  of God, as will a certain hope of forgiveness of all his  recklessness. And therefore have I ordained thy climbing by these  two thoughts; but if it so be that thy good angel teach thee within  thy ghostly conceit, or any other man, any other two that are more  according to thy disposition than thee thinketh these two be, thou  mayst take them, and leave these safely without any blame.  Nevertheless to my conceit (till I wete more) me thinketh that these  should be full helply unto thee, and not much unaccording to thy  disposition, after that I feel in thee. And therefore, if thou think  that they do thee good, then thank God heartily, and for God's love  pray for me. Do then so, for I am a wretch, and thou wotest not how  it standeth with me.    No more at this time, but God's blessing have thou and mine.    Read often, and forget it not; set thee sharply to the proof; and  flee all letting and occasion of letting, in the name of our Lord  Jesu Christ. AMEN.    FINIS          VI.    HERE FOLLOWETH ALSO A VERY NECESSARY EPISTLE OF DISCRETION IN  STIRRINGS OF THE SOUL      GHOSTLY friend in God, that same grace and joy that I will to  myself, will I to thee at God's will. Thou askest me counsel of  silence and of speaking, of common dieting and of singular fasting,  of dwelling in company and only woning[227] by thyself. And thou  sayest thou art in great were[228] what thou shalt do; for, as thou  sayest, on the one party thou art greatly tarried with speaking,  with common eating, as other folk do, and with common woning in  company. And, on the other party, thou dreadest to be straitly  still,[229] singular in fasting, and only in woning, for deeming of  more holiness in thee than thou hast,[230] and for many other  perils; for oft times now these days they are deemed for most holy,  and fall in to many perils, that most are in silence, in singular  fasting, and in only woning. And sooth it is that they are most  holy, if grace only be the cause of that silence, of that singular  fasting, and of that only woning, the kind[231] but suffering and  only consenting; and if it be otherwise, then that is but peril on  all sides, for it is full perilous to strain the kind to any such  work of devotion, as is silence or speaking, common dieting or  singular fasting, woning in company or in onliness.[232] I mean,  passing the course and the common custom of kind and degree, but if  it be led thereto by grace; and, namely, to such works the which in  themself are indifferent, that is to say, now good, and now evil,  now with thee, now against thee, now helping, and now letting. For  it might befall that, if thou followed thy singular stirring,  straitly straining thee to silence, to singular fasting, or to only  woning, that thou shouldest oft times be still when time were to  speak, oft times fast when time were to eat, oft times be only when  time were to be in company. Or if thou give thee to speaking always  when thee list, to common eating, or to companious woning,[233] then  peradventure thou shouldest sometime speak when time[234] were to be  still, sometime eat when time were to fast, sometime be in company  when time were to be only; and thus mightest thou lightly fall in to  error, in great confusion, not only of thine own soul but also of  others. And, therefore, in eschewing of such errors, thou askest of  me (as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45456"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 1 of 2 (#12)"],[1,"of the assembly, \"use the utmost rigour of the  rights of victory? You are masters to destroy all Latium, and to make a  vast desert of it, after having often drawn from it powerful succours.  Will you, on the contrary, after the example of your fathers, augment  the resources of Rome? Admit the vanquished among the number of your  citizens; it is a fruitful means of increasing at the same time your  power and your glory.\"[184] This last counsel prevailed.    The first step was to break the bonds which made of the Latin people a  sort of confederacy. All political communalty, all war on their own  account, all rights of _commercium_ and _connubium_, between the  different cities, were taken from them.[185]    The towns nearest Rome received the rights of city and suffrage.[186]  Others received the title of allies and the privilege of preserving  their own institutions, but they lost a part of their territory.[187] As  to the Latin colonies founded before in the old country of the Volsci,  they formed the nucleus of the Latin allies (_socii nominis Latini_).  Velitrae, alone, having already revolted several times, was treated with  great rigour; Antium was compelled to surrender its ships, and become a  maritime colony.    These severe, but equitable measures, had pacified Latium; applied to  the rest of Italy, and even to foreign countries, they will facilitate  everywhere the progress of Roman domination.    The momentary alliance with the Samnites had permitted Rome to reduce  the Latins; nevertheless the Senate, without hesitation, turned against  the former again as soon as the moment appeared convenient. It  concluded, in 422, a treaty with the Gauls and Alexander Molossus, who,  having landed near Paestum, attacked the Lucanians and the Samnites. This  King of Epirus, the uncle of Alexander the Great, had been called into  Italy by the Tarentines; but his premature death disappointed the hopes  to which his co-operation had given rise, and the Samnites recommenced  their incursions on the lands of their neighbours. The intervention of  Rome put a stop to the war. All the forces of the Republic were employed  in reducing the revolt of the Volscian towns of Fundi and  Privernum.[188] In 425, Anxur (_Terracina_) was declared a Roman colony,  and, in 426, Fregellae (_Ceprano?_), a Latin colony.    The establishment of these fortresses, and of those of Cales and Antium,  secured the communications with Campania; the Liris and the Vulturnus  became in that direction the principal lines of defence of the Romans.  The cities situated on the shores of that magnificent gulf called  _Crater_ by the ancients, and in our days the _Gulf of Naples_,  perceived then the dangers which threatened them. They turned their eyes  towards the population of the interior, who were no less alarmed for  their independence.      [Sidenote: Second Samnite War.]    V. The fertile countries which bordered the western shore of the  peninsula were destined to excite the covetousness of the Romans and the  Samnites, and become the prey of the conqueror. \"Campania, indeed,\" says  Florus,[189] \"is the finest country of Italy, and even of the whole  world. There is nothing milder than its climate. Spring flourishes there  twice every year. There can be nothing more fertile than its soil. It is  called the garden of Ceres and Bacchus. There is not a more hospitable  sea than that which bathes its shores.\" In 427, the two peoples  disputed the possession of it, as they had done in 411. The inhabitants  of Palaeopolis having attacked the Roman colonists of the _ager  Campanus_, the consuls marched against that place, which soon received  succour from the Samnites and the inhabitants of Nola, while Rome formed  an alliance with the Apulians and the Lucanians. The siege dragged on,  and the necessity of continuing the campaign beyond the ordinary limit  led to the prolongation of the command of Publilius Philo with the title  of proconsul, which appeared for the first time in the military annals.  The Samnites were soon driven from Campania; the Palaeopolitans  submitted; their town was demolished; but they formed close to it a new  establishment, at Naples (_Neapolis_), where a new treaty guaranteed  them an almost absolute independence, on the condition of furnishing a  certain number of vessels to Rome. After that, nearly all the Greek  towns, reduced one after another, obtained the same favourable  conditions, and formed the class of the _socii navales_.[190]    Yet the war was protracted in the mountains of the Apennine. Tarentum  united with the Samnites, the only people who were still to be  feared,[191] and the Lucanians abandoned the alliance of the Romans;  but, in 429, the two most celebrated captains of the time, Q. Fabius  Rullianus and Papirius Cursor, penetrated into the country of Samnium,  and compelled the enemy to pay an indemnity for the war and accept a  year's truce.    At this epoch, an unforeseen event, which changed the destinies of the  world, came to demonstrate the difference between the rapid creation of  a man of genius and the patient work of an intelligent aristocracy.  Alexander the Great, after having shone like a meteor, and brought into  subjection the most powerful kingdoms of Asia, died at Babylon. His  fruitful and decisive influence, which carried the civilization of  Greece into the East, survived him, but at his death, the empire he  founded became in a few years dismembered (431); the Roman aristocracy,  on the contrary, perpetuating itself from age to age, pursued more  slowly, but without interruption, the system which, binding again the  peoples about a common centre, was destined by little and little to  secure her domination over Italy first, and then over the universe.    The defection of a part of the Apulians, in 431, encouraged the Samnites  to take arms again; defeated in the following years, they asked for the  restoration of friendly relations, but the haughty refusal of Rome led,  in 433, to the famous defeat of the Furcae Caudinae. The generosity of the  Samnite general, Pontus Herennius, who granted their lives to so many  thousands of prisoners on condition of restoring to force the old  treaties, had no effect upon the Senate. Four legions had passed under  the yoke--a circumstance in which the Senate only saw a new affront to  revenge. The treaty of Caudium was not ratified, and subterfuges little  excusable, although approved at a later period by Cicero,[192] gave to  the refusal an appearance of justice.    Meanwhile the Senate exerted itself vigorously to repair this check, and  soon Publilius Philo defeated the enemies in Samnium, and, in Apulia,  Papirius, in his turn, caused seven thousand Samnites to pass under the  yoke. The vanquished solicited peace, but in vain; they only obtained a  truce for two years (436), and it had hardly expired, when, penetrating  into the country of the Volsci, as far as the neighbourhood of  Terracina, and taking a position at Lautulae, they defeated a Roman army  raised hastily and commanded by Q. Fabius (439). Capua deserted, and  Nola, Nuceria, the Aurunci, and the Volsci of the Liris took part openly  with the Samnites. The spirit of rebellion spread as far as Praeneste.  Rome was in danger. The Senate required its utmost energy to restrain  populations whose fidelity was always doubtful. Fortune seconded its  efforts, and the allies, who had proved traitors, received a cruel  chastisement, explained by the terror they had inspired. In 440,[193]  not far from Caudium, a numerous army encountered the Samnites, who lost  30,000 men, and were driven back into the Apennine territory. The Roman  legions proceeded to encamp before their capital, Bovianum, and there  took up their winter quarters.    The year following (441), Rome, less occupied in fighting, profited by  this circumstance to seize upon advantageous positions, establishing in  Campania and Apulia colonies which surrounded the territory of Samnium.  At the same epoch, Appius Claudius transformed into a regular causeway  the road which has preserved his name.[194] The Romans turned their  attention to the defence of the coasts and communication by sea; a  colony was sent to the isle of Pontia,[195] opposite Tarracina, and the  armament of a fleet was commenced, which was placed under the command of  _duumviri navales_.[196] The war had lasted fifteen years, and, although  Rome had only succeeded in driving back the Samnites into their own  territory, she had conquered two provinces, Apulia and Campania.      [Sidenote: Third Samnite war. Coalition of Samnites, Etruscans,  Umbrians, and Hernici (443-449).]    VI. A struggle so desperate had produced its effect even in Etruria, and  the old league was formed again. Inured to war by their daily combats  with the Gauls, and emboldened by the reports of the defeat of Lautulae,  the Etruscans believed that the moment had arrived for recovering their  ancient territory to the south of the Ciminian forest; they were further  encouraged by the attitude of the peoples of Central Italy, who were  weary of the continual passing of legions. From 443 to 449, the armies  of the Republic were obliged to face different enemies at the same time.  In Etruria, Fabius Rullianus relieved Sutrium, a rampart of Rome on the  north;[197] he passed through the Ciminian forest, and by the victories  of Lake Vadimo (445)[198] and Perusia compelled all the Etruscan towns  to ask for peace. At the same time, an army laid waste the country of  the Samnites; and a Roman fleet, composed of vessels furnished by the  maritime allies, took the offensive for the first time. Its attempt near  Nuceria Alfaterna (_Nocera_, a town of Campania) was unfortunate.    War next breaks out again in Apulia, Samnium, and Etruria, where the  aged Papirius Cursor, named dictator anew, gains a brilliant victory at  Langula (445).
