[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7853"],[0,"Quentin Durward (#12)"],[1,"the  landlord. \"I am bound to pleasure every friend of Maitre Pierre.\"    \"Oh, happy ducking!\" exclaimed Quentin Durward, cutting a caper on  the floor, so soon as his host had retired: \"Never came good luck in a  better or a wetter form. I have been fairly deluged by my good fortune.\"    As he spoke thus, he stepped towards the little window, which, as the  turret projected considerably from the principal line of the building,  not only commanded a very pretty garden of some extent, belonging to the  inn, but overlooked, beyond its boundary, a pleasant grove of those  very mulberry trees which Maitre Pierre was said to have planted for  the support of the silk worm. Besides, turning the eye from these more  remote objects, and looking straight along the wall, the turret of  Quentin was opposite to another turret, and the little window at which  he stood commanded a similar little window in a corresponding projection  of the building. Now, it would be difficult for a man twenty years older  than Quentin to say why this locality interested him more than either  the pleasant garden or the grove of mulberry trees; for, alas! eyes  which have been used for forty years and upwards, look with indifference  on little turret windows, though the lattice be half open to admit the  air, while the shutter is half closed to exclude the sun, or perhaps  a too curious eye--nay, even though there hang on the one side of the  casement a lute, partly mantled by a light veil of sea green silk. But,  at Durward's happy age, such accidents, as a painter would call them,  form sufficient foundation for a hundred airy visions and mysterious  conjectures, at recollection of which the full grown man smiles while he  sighs, and sighs while he smiles.    As it may be supposed that our friend Quentin wished to learn a little  more of his fair neighbour, the owner of the lute and veil--as it may be  supposed he was at least interested to know whether she might not prove  the same whom he had seen in humble attendance on Maitre Pierre, it must  of course be understood that he did not produce a broad staring visage  and person in full front of his own casement. Durward knew better the  art of bird catching; and it was to his keeping his person skilfully  withdrawn on one side of his window; while he peeped through the  lattice, that he owed the pleasure of seeing a white, round, beautiful  arm take down the instrument, and that his ears had presently after  their share in the reward of his dexterous management.    The maid of the little turret, of the veil, and of the lute sang exactly  such an air as we are accustomed to suppose flowed from the lips of the  high born dames of chivalry, when knights and troubadours listened and  languished. The words had neither so much sense, wit, or fancy as to  withdraw the attention from the music, nor the music so much of art as  to drown all feeling of the words. The one seemed fitted to the other;  and if the song had been recited without the notes, or the air played  without the words, neither would have been worth noting. It is;  therefore, scarcely fair to put upon record lines intended not to be  said or read, but only to be sung. But such scraps of old poetry have  always had a sort of fascination for us; and as the tune is lost for  ever unless Bishop [Sir Henry Rowley, an English composer and professor  of music at Oxford in 1848. Among his most popular operas are Guy  Mannering and The Kniqht of Snowdon] happens to find the notes, or some  lark teaches Stephens [Catherine (1794-1882): a vocalist and actress  who created Susanna in the Marriage of Figaro, and various parts in  adaptation of Scott.] to warble the air--we will risk our credit, and  the taste of the Lady of the Lute, by preserving the verses, simple and  even rude as they are:           Ah! County Guy, the hour is nigh,       The sun has left the lea,       The orange flower perfumes the bower,       The breeze is on the sea.       The lark, his lay who thrill'd all day,       Sits hush'd his partner nigh;       Breeze, bird, and flower confess the hour,       But where is County Guy?         The village maid steals through the shade,       Her shepherd's suit to hear;       To beauty shy, by lattice high,       Sings high born Cavalier.       The star of Love, all stars above,       Now reigns o'er earth and sky;       And high and low the influence know       --But where is County Guy?      Whatever the reader may think of this simple ditty, it had a powerful  effect on Quentin, when married to heavenly airs, and sung by a sweet  and melting voice, the notes mingling with the gentle breezes which  wafted perfumes from the garden, and the figure of the songstress  being so partially and obscurely visible as threw a veil of mysterious  fascination over the whole.    At the close of the air, the listener could not help showing himself  more boldly than he had yet done, in a rash attempt to see more than he  had yet been able to discover. The music instantly ceased--the casement  was closed, and a dark curtain, dropped on the inside, put a stop to all  farther observation on the part of the neighbour in the next turret.    Durward was mortified and surprised at the consequence of his  precipitance, but comforted himself with the hope that the Lady of the  Lute could neither easily forego the practice of an instrument which  seemed so familiar to her, nor cruelly resolve to renounce the pleasures  of fresh air and an open window for the churlish purpose of preserving  for her own exclusive ear the sweet sounds which she created. There  came, perhaps, a little feeling of personal vanity to mingle with these  consolatory reflections. If, as he shrewdly suspected, there was a  beautiful dark tressed damsel inhabitant of the one turret, he could not  but be conscious that a handsome, young, roving, bright locked gallant,  a cavalier of fortune, was the tenant of the other; and romances, those  prudent instructors, had taught his youth that if damsels were shy, they  were yet neither void of interest nor of curiosity in their neighbours'  affairs.    Whilst Quentin was engaged in these sage reflections, a sort of  attendant or chamberlain of the inn informed him that a cavalier desired  to speak with him below.        CHAPTER V: THE MAN AT ARMS         Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,       Seeking the bubble reputation       Even in the cannon's mouth.         AS YOU LIKE IT      The cavalier who awaited Quentin Durward's descent into the apartment  where he had breakfasted, was one of those of whom Louis XI had long  since said that they held in their hands the fortune of France, as  to them were intrusted the direct custody and protection of the royal  person.    Charles the Sixth had instituted this celebrated body, the Archers, as  they were called, of the Scottish Bodyguard, with better reason than  can generally be alleged for establishing round the throne a guard of  foreign and mercenary troops. The divisions which tore from his side  more than half of France, together with the wavering and uncertain faith  of the nobility who yet acknowledged his cause, rendered it impolitic  and unsafe to commit his personal safety to their keeping. The Scottish  nation was the hereditary enemy of the English, and the ancient, and,  as it seemed, the natural allies of France. They were poor, courageous,  faithful; their ranks were sure to be supplied from the superabundant  population of their own country, than which none in Europe sent forth  more or bolder adventurers. Their high claims of descent, too, gave them  a good title to approach the person of a monarch more closely than other  troops, while the comparative smallness of their numbers prevented the  possibility of their mutinying, and becoming masters where they ought to  be servants.    On the other hand, the French monarchs made it their policy to  conciliate the affections of this select band of foreigners, by allowing  them honorary privileges and ample pay, which last most of them disposed  of with military profusion in supporting their supposed rank. Each of  them ranked as a gentleman in place and honour; and their near approach  to the King's person gave them dignity in their own eyes, as well as  importance in those of the nation of France. They were sumptuously  armed, equipped, and mounted; and each was entitled to allowance for  a squire, a valet, a page; and two yeomen, one of whom was termed  coutelier, from the large knife which he wore to dispatch those whom in  the melee his master had thrown to the ground. With these followers, and  a corresponding equipage, an Archer of the Scottish Guard was a person  of quality and importance; and vacancies being generally filled up by  those who had been trained in the service as pages or valets, the cadets  of the best Scottish families were often sent to serve under some friend  and relation in those capacities, until a chance of preferment should  occur.    The coutelier and his companion, not being noble or capable of this  promotion, were recruited from persons of inferior quality; but as their  pay and appointments were excellent, their masters were easily able  to select from among their wandering countrymen the strongest and most  courageous to wait upon them in these capacities.    Ludovic Lesly, or as we shall more frequently call him, Le Balafre, by  which name he was generally known in France, was upwards of six feet  high, robust, strongly compacted in person, and hard favoured in  countenance, which latter attribute was much increased by a large and  ghastly scar, which, beginning on his forehead, and narrowly missing  his right eye, had laid bare the cheek bone, and descended from  thence almost to the tip of his ear, exhibiting a deep seam, which  was sometimes scarlet, sometimes purple, sometimes blue, and sometimes  approaching to black; but always hideous, because at variance with  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7864"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#12)"],[1,"aya, the son of Parikshit, was, with his brothers,  attending his long sacrifice on the plains of Kurukshetra. His brothers  were three, Srutasena, Ugrasena, and Bhimasena. And as they were sitting  at the sacrifice, there arrived at the spot an offspring of Sarama (the  celestial bitch). And belaboured by the brothers of Janamejaya, he ran  away to his mother, crying in pain. And his mother seeing him crying  exceedingly asked him, 'Why criest thou so? Who hath beaten thee?' And  being thus questioned, he said unto his mother, 'I have been belaboured by  the brothers of Janamejaya.' And his mother replied, 'Thou hast committed  some fault for which hast thou been beaten!' He answered, 'I have not  committed any fault. I have not touched the sacrificial butter with my  tongue, nor have I even cast a look upon it.' His mother Sarama hearing  this and much distressed at the affliction of her son went to the place  where Janamejaya with his brothers was at his long-extending sacrifice.  And she addressed Janamejaya in anger, saying, 'This my son hath committed  no fault: he hath not looked upon your sacrificial butter, nor hath he  touched it with his tongue. Wherefore hath he been beaten?' They said not  a word in reply; whereupon she said, 'As ye have beaten my son who hath  committed no fault, therefore shall evil come upon ye, when ye least  expect it.'    \"Janamejaya, thus addressed by the celestial bitch, Sarama, became  exceedingly alarmed and dejected. And after the sacrifice was concluded  returned to Hastinapura, and began to take great pains in searching for a  Purohita who could by procuring absolution for his sin, neutralise the  effect of the curse.    \"One day Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, while a-hunting, observed in a  particular part of his dominions a hermitage where dwelt a certain Rishi  of fame, Srutasrava. He had a son named Somasrava deeply engaged in  ascetic devotions. Being desirous of appointing that son of the Rishi as  his Purohita, Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, saluted the Rishi and  addressed him, saying, 'O possessor of the six attributes, let this thy  son be my purohita.' The Rishi thus addressed, answered Janamejaya, 'O  Janamejaya, this my son, deep in ascetic devotions, accomplished in the  study of the Vedas, and endued with the full force of my asceticism, is  born of (the womb of) a she-snake that had drunk my vital fluid. He is  able to absolve thee from all offences save those committed against  Mahadeva. But he hath one particular habit, viz. he would grant to any  Brahmana whatever might be begged of him. If thou canst put up with it,  then thou take him.' Janamejaya thus addressed replied to the Rishi, 'It  shall be even so.' And accepting him for his Purohita, he returned to his  capital; and he then addressed his brothers saying, 'This is the person I  have chosen for my spiritual master; whatsoever he may say must be  complied with by you without examination.' And his brothers did as they  were directed. And giving these directions to his brothers, the king  marched towards Takshyashila and brought that country under his authority.    \"About this time there was a Rishi, Ayoda-Dhaumya by name. And Ayoda-  Dhaumya had three disciples, Upamanyu, Aruni, and Veda. And the Rishi bade  one of these disciples, Aruni of Panchala, to go and stop up a breach in  the water-course of a certain field. And Aruni of Panchala, thus ordered  by his preceptor, repaired to the spot. And having gone there he saw that  he could not stop up the breach in the water-course by ordinary means. And  he was distressed because he could not do his preceptor's bidding. But at  length he saw a way and said, 'Well, I will do it in this way.' He then  went down into the breach and lay down himself there. And the water was  thus confined.    \"And some time after, the preceptor Ayoda-Dhaumya asked his other  disciples where Aruni of Panchala was. And they answered, 'Sir, he hath  been sent by yourself saying, \"Go, stop up the breach in the water-course  of the field.\"' Thus reminded, Dhaumya, addressing his pupils, said, 'Then  let us all go to the place where he is.'    \"And having arrived there, he shouted, 'Ho Aruni of Panchala! Where art  thou? Come hither, my child.' And Aruni hearing the voice of his preceptor  speedily came out of the water-course and stood before his preceptor. And  addressing the latter, Aruni said, 'Here I am in the breach of the water-  course. Not having been able to devise any other means, I entered myself  for the purpose of preventing the water running out. It is only upon  hearing thy voice that, having left it and allowed the waters to escape, I  have stood before thee. I salute thee, Master; tell me what I have to do.'    \"The preceptor, thus addressed, replied, 'Because in getting up from the  ditch thou hast opened the water-course, thenceforth shalt thou be called  Uddalaka as a mark of thy preceptor's favour. And because my words have  been obeyed by thee, thou shalt obtain good fortune. And all the Vedas  shall shine in thee and all the Dharmasastras also.' And Aruni, thus  addressed by his preceptor, went to the country after his heart.    \"The name of another of Ayoda-Dhaumya's disciples was Upamanyu. And  Dhaumya appointed him saying, 'Go, my child, Upamanyu, look after the  kine.' And according to his preceptor's orders, he went to tend the kine.  And having watched them all day, he returned in the evening to his  preceptor's house and standing before him he saluted him respectfully. And  his preceptor seeing him in good condition of body asked him, 'Upamanyu,  my child, upon what dost thou support thyself? Thou art exceedingly plump.'  And he answered, 'Sir, I support myself by begging.' And his preceptor  said, 'What is obtained in alms should not be used by thee without  offering it to me.' And Upamanyu, thus told, went away. And having  obtained alms, he offered the same to his preceptor. And his preceptor  took from him even the whole. And Upamanyu, thus treated, went to attend  the cattle. And having watched them all day, he returned in the evening to  his preceptor's abode. And he stood before his preceptor and saluted him  with respect. And his preceptor perceiving that he still continued to be  of good condition of body said unto him, 'Upamanyu, my child, I take from  thee even the whole of what thou obtainest in alms, without leaving  anything for thee. How then dost thou, at present, contrive to support  thyself?' And Upamanyu said unto his preceptor, 'Sir, having made over to  you all that I obtain in alms, I go a-begging a second time for supporting  myself.' And his preceptor then replied, 'This is not the way in which  thou shouldst obey the preceptor. By this thou art diminishing the support  of others that live by begging. Truly having supported thyself so, thou  hast proved thyself covetous.' And Upamanyu, having signified his assent  to all that his preceptor said, went away to attend the cattle. And having  watched them all day, he returned to his preceptor's house. And he stood  before his preceptor and saluted him respectfully. And his preceptor  observing that he was still fat, said again unto him, 'Upamanyu, my child,  I take from thee all thou obtainest in alms and thou dost not go a-begging  a second time, and yet art thou in healthy condition. How dost thou  support thyself?' And Upamanyu, thus questioned, answered, 'Sir, I now  live upon the milk of these cows.' And his preceptor thereupon told him,  'It is not lawful for thee to appropriate the milk without having first  obtained my consent.' And Upamanyu having assented to the justice of these  observations, went away to tend the kine. And when he returned to his  preceptor's abode, he stood before him and saluted him as usual. And his  preceptor seeing that he was still fat, said, 'Upamanyu, my child, thou  eatest no longer of alms, nor dost thou go a-begging a second time, not  even drinkest of the milk; yet art thou fat. By what means dost thou  contrive to live now?' And Upamanyu replied, 'Sir, I now sip the froth that  these calves throw out, while sucking their mother's teats.' And the  preceptor said, 'These generous calves, I suppose, out of compassion for  thee, throw out large quantities of froth. Wouldst thou stand in the way  of their full meals by acting as thou hast done? Know that it is unlawful  for thee to drink the froth.' And Upamanyu, having signified his assent to  this, went as before to tend the cows. And restrained by his preceptor, he  feedeth not on alms, nor hath he anything else to eat; he drinketh not of  the milk, nor tasteth he of the froth!    \"And Upamanyu, one day, oppressed by hunger, when in a forest, ate of the  leaves of the Arka (Asclepias gigantea). And his eyes being affected by  the pungent, acrimonious, crude, and saline properties of the leaves which  he had eaten, he became blind. And as he was crawling about, he fell into  a pit. And upon his not returning that day when the sun was sinking down  behind the summit of the western mountains, the preceptor observed to his  disciples that Upamanyu was not yet come. And they told him that he had  gone out with the cattle.    \"The preceptor then said, 'Upamanyu being restrained by me from the use of  everything, is, of course, tired, and therefore, doth not come home until  it be late. Let us then go in search of him.' And having said this, he went  with his disciples into the forest and began to shout, saying, 'Ho  Upamanyu, where art thou?' And Upamanyu hearing his preceptor's voice  answered in a loud tone, 'Here I am at the bottom of a well.' And his  preceptor asked him how he happened to be there. And Upamanyu replied,  'Having eaten of the leaves of the Arka plant I became blind, and so have  I fallen into this well.' And his preceptor thereupon told him, 'Glorify  the twin Aswins, the joint physicians of the gods, and they will restore  thee thy sight.' And Upamanyu thus"]]]
