[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#12)"],[1," little copy of \"Lamb's Tales from  Shakespeare\" which I thought he could read without brain fever. Then  I lit my lantern and after a chorus of good-byes Parnassus rolled  away. \"Well,\" I said to myself as I turned into the high road once  more, \"drat the gingersnap, he seems to hypnotize everybody... he  must be nearly in Brooklyn by this time!\"    It was very quiet along the road, also very dark, for the sky had  clouded over and I could see neither moon nor stars. As it was a  direct road I should have had no difficulty, and I suppose I must  have fallen into a doze during which Peg took a wrong turning. At  any rate, I realized about half-past nine that Parnassus was on a  much rougher road than the highway had any right to be, and there  were no telephone poles to be seen. I knew that they stretched  all along the main road, so plainly I had made a mistake. I was  reluctant for a moment to admit that I could be wrong, and just  then Peg stumbled heavily and stood still. She paid no heed to my  exhortations, and when I got out and carried my lantern to see  whether anything was in the way, I found that she had cast a shoe  and her foot was bleeding. The shoe must have dropped off some way  back and she had picked up a nail or something in the quick. I saw  no alternative but to stay where I was for the night.    This was not very pleasant, but the adventures of the day had put  me into a stoical frame of mind, and I saw no good in repining. I  unhitched Peg, sponged her foot, and tied her to a tree. I would  have made more careful explorations to determine just where I was,  but a sharp patter of rain began to fall. So I climbed into my  Parnassus, took Bock in with me, and lit the swinging lamp. By this  time it was nearly ten o'clock. There was nothing to do but turn in,  so I took off my boots and lay down in the bunk. Bock lay quite  comfortably on the floor of the van. I meant to read for a while,  and so did not turn out the light, but I fell asleep almost  immediately.    I woke up at half-past eleven and turned out the lamp, which had  made the van very warm. I opened the little windows front and back,  and would have opened the door, but I feared Bock might slip away.  It was still raining a little. To my annoyance I felt very wakeful.  I lay for some time listening to the patter of raindrops on the roof  and skylight--a very snug sound when one is warm and safe. Every now  and then I could hear Peg stamping in the underbrush. I was almost  dozing off again when Bock gave a low growl.    No woman of my bulk has a right to be nervous, I guess, but  instantly my security vanished! The patter of the rain seemed  menacing, and I imagined a hundred horrors. I was totally alone and  unarmed, and Bock was not a large dog. He growled again, and I felt  worse than before. I imagined that I heard stealthy sounds in the  bushes, and once Peg snorted as though frightened. I put my hand  down to pat Bock, and found that his neck was all bristly, like a  fighting cock. He uttered a queer half growl, half whine, which  gave me a chill. Some one must be prowling about the van, but in the  falling rain I could hear nothing.    I felt I must do something. I was afraid to call out lest I betray  the fact that there was only a woman in the van. My expedient was  absurd enough, but at any rate it satisfied my desire to act. I  seized one of my boots and banged vigorously on the floor, at the  same time growling in as deep and masculine a voice as I could  muster: \"What the hell's the matter? What the hell's the matter?\"  This sounds silly enough, I dare say, but it afforded me some  relief. And as Bock shortly ceased growling, it apparently served  some purpose.    I lay awake for a long time, tingling all over with nervousness.  Then I began to grow calmer, and was getting drowsy almost in spite  of myself when I was aroused by the unmistakable sound of Bock's  tail thumping on the floor--a sure sign of pleasure. This puzzled  me quite as much as his growls. I did not dare strike a light, but  could hear him sniffing at the door of the van and whining with  eagerness. This seemed very uncanny, and again I crept stealthily  out of the bunk and pounded on the floor lustily, this time with the  frying pan, which made an unearthly din. Peg neighed and snorted,  and Bock began to bark. Even in my anxiety I almost laughed. \"It  sounds like an insane asylum,\" I thought, and reflected that  probably the disturbance was only caused by some small animal.  Perhaps a rabbit or a skunk which Bock had winded and wanted to  chase. I patted him, and crawled into my bunk once more.    But my real excitement was still to come. About half an hour later  I heard unmistakable footsteps alongside the van. Bock growled  furiously, and I lay in a panic. Something jarred one of the wheels.  Then broke out a most extraordinary racket. I heard quick steps, Peg  whinneyed, and something fell heavily against the back of the wagon.  There was a violent scuffle on the ground, the sound of blows, and  rapid breathing. With my heart jumping I peered out of one of the  back windows. There was barely any light, but dimly I could see a  tumbling mass which squirmed and writhed on the ground. Something  struck one of the rear wheels so that Parnassus trembled. I heard  hoarse swearing, and then the whole body, whatever it was, rolled  off into the underbrush. There was a terrific crashing and snapping  of twigs. Bock whined, growled, and pawed madly at the door. And  then complete silence.    My nerves were quite shattered by this time. I don't think I had  been so frightened since childhood days when I awakened from a  nightmare. Little trickles of fear crept up and down my spine and my  scalp prickled. I pulled Bock on the bunk, and lay with one hand on  his collar. He, too, seemed agitated and sniffed gingerly now and  then. Finally, however, he gave a sigh and fell asleep. I judged it  might have been two o'clock, but I did not like to strike a light.  And at last I fell into a doze.    When I woke the sun was shining brilliantly and the air was full of  the chirping of birds. I felt stiff and uneasy from sleeping in my  clothes, and my foot was numb from Bock's weight.    I got up and looked out of the window. Parnassus was standing in a  narrow lane by a grove of birch trees. The ground was muddy, and  smeared with footprints behind the van. I opened the door and looked  around. The first thing I saw, on the ground by one of the wheels,  was a battered tweed cap.        CHAPTER NINE      My feelings were as mixed as a crushed nut sundae. So the Professor  hadn't gone to Brooklyn after all! What did he mean by prowling  after me like a sleuth? Was it just homesickness for Parnassus? Not  likely! And then the horrible noises I had heard in the night; had  some tramp been hanging about the van in the hope of robbing me? Had  the tramp attacked Mifflin? Or had Mifflin attacked the tramp? Who  had got the better of it?    I picked up the muddy cap and threw it into the van. Anyway, I had  problems of my own to tackle, and those of the Professor could wait.    Peg whinneyed when she saw me. I examined her foot. Seeing it by  daylight the trouble was not hard to diagnose. A long, jagged piece  of slate was wedged in the frog of the foot. I easily wrenched it  out, heated some water, and gave the hoof another sponging. It  would be all right when shod once more. But where was the shoe?    I gave the horse some oats, cooked an egg and a cup of coffee for  myself at the little kerosene stove, and broke up a dog biscuit  for Bock. I marvelled once more at the completeness of Parnassus'  furnishings. Bock helped me to scour the pan. He sniffed eagerly  at the cap when I showed it to him, and wagged his tail.    It seemed to me that the only thing I could do was to leave  Parnassus and the animals where they were and retrace my steps as  far as the Pratt farm. Undoubtedly Mr. Pratt would be glad to sell  me a horse-shoe and send his hired man to do the job for me. I could  not drive Peg as she was, with a sore foot and without a shoe. I  judged Parnassus would be quite safe: the lane seemed to be a lonely  one leading to a deserted quarry. I tied Bock to the steps to act as  a guard, took my purse and the Professor's cap with me, locked the  door of the van, and set off along the back track. Bock whined and  tugged violently when he saw me disappearing, but I could see no  other course.    The lane rejoined the main road about half a mile back. I must have  been asleep or I could never have made the mistake of turning off.  I don't see why Peg should have made the turn, unless her foot hurt  and she judged the side track would be a good place to rest. She  must have been well used to stopping overnight in the open.    I strode along pondering over my adventures, and resolved to buy a  pistol when I got to Woodbridge. I remember thinking that I could  write quite a book now myself. Already I began to feel quite a  hardened pioneer. It doesn't take an adaptable person long to  accustom one's self to a new way of life, and the humdrum routine of  the farm certainly looked prosy compared to voyaging with Parnassus.  When I had got beyond Woodbridge, and had crossed the river, I would  begin to sell books in earnest. Also I would buy a notebook and jot  down my experiences. I had heard of bookselling as a profession  for women, but I thought that my taste of it was probably unique.  I might even write a book that would rival Andrew's--yes, and  Mifflin's. And that brought my thoughts to Barbarossa again.    Of all extraordinary people, I thought, he certainly takes the  cake--and then, rounding a bend, I saw him sitting on a rail fence,  with his head shining in the sunlight. My heart gave a sort of jump.  I do believe I was getting fond of the Professor. He was examining  something which he held in his hand.    \"You'll get sunstroke,\" I said. \"Here's your cap.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5321"],[0,"Concerning the Spiritual in Art (#12)"],[1,"of tone,--so  yellow has shades, which can be expressed by various instruments.  But in making such parallels, I am assuming in each case a pure  tone of colour or sound, unvaried by vibration or dampers, etc.]    Yellow is the typically earthly colour. It can never have  profound meaning. An intermixture of blue makes it a sickly  colour. It may be paralleled in human nature, with madness, not  with melancholy or hypochondriacal mania, but rather with violent  raving lunacy.    The power of profound meaning is found in blue, and first in its  physical movements (1) of retreat from the spectator, (2) of  turning in upon its own centre. The inclination of blue to depth  is so strong that its inner appeal is stronger when its shade is  deeper.    Blue is the typical heavenly colour.    [Footnote: ...The halos are golden for emperors and prophets  (i.e. for mortals), and sky-blue for symbolic figures (i.e.  spiritual beings); (Kondakoff, Histoire de l'An Byzantine  consideree principalement dans les miniatures, vol. ii, p. 382,  Paris, 1886-91).]    The ultimate feeling it creates is one of rest.    [Footnote: Supernatural rest, not the earthly contentment of  green. The way to the supernatural lies through the natural. And  we mortals passing from the earthly yellow to the heavenly blue  must pass through green.]    When it sinks almost to black, it echoes a grief that is hardly  human.    [Footnote: As an echo of grief violet stand to blue as does green  in its production of rest.]    When it rises towards white, a movement little suited to it, its  appeal to men grows weaker and more distant. In music a light  blue is like a flute, a darker blue a cello; a still darker a  thunderous double bass; and the darkest blue of all-an organ.    A well-balanced mixture of blue and yellow produces green. The  horizontal movement ceases; likewise that from and towards the  centre. The effect on the soul through the eye is therefore  motionless. This is a fact recognized not only by opticians but  by the world. Green is the most restful colour that exists. On  exhausted men this restfulness has a beneficial effect, but after  a time it becomes wearisome. Pictures painted in shades of green  are passive and tend to be wearisome; this contrasts with the  active warmth of yellow or the active coolness of blue. In the  hierarchy of colours green is the \"bourgeoisie\"-self-satisfied,  immovable, narrow. It is the colour of summer, the period when  nature is resting from the storms of winter and the productive  energy of spring (cf. Fig. 2).    Any preponderance in green of yellow or blue introduces a  corresponding activity and changes the inner appeal. The green  keeps its characteristic equanimity and restfulness, the former  increasing with the inclination to lightness, the latter with the  inclination to depth. In music the absolute green is represented  by the placid, middle notes of a violin.    Black and white have already been discussed in general terms.  More particularly speaking, white, although often considered as  no colour (a theory largely due to the Impressionists, who saw no  white in nature as a symbol of a world from which all colour as a  definite attribute has disappeared).    [Footnote: Van Gogh, in his letters, asks whether he may not  paint a white wall dead white. This question offers no difficulty  to the non-representative artist who is concerned only with the  inner harmony of colour. But to the impressionist-realist it  seems a bold liberty to take with nature. To him it seems as  outrageous as his own change from brown shadows to blue seemed to  his contemporaries. Van Gogh's question marks a transition from  Impressionism to an art of spiritual harmony, as the coming of  the blue shadow marked a transition from academism to  Impressionism. (Cf. The Letters of Vincent van Gogh. Constable,  London.)]    This world is too far above us for its harmony to touch our  souls. A great silence, like an impenetrable wall, shrouds its  life from our understanding. White, therefore, has this harmony  of silence, which works upon us negatively, like many pauses in  music that break temporarily the melody. It is not a dead  silence, but one pregnant with possibilities. White has the  appeal of the nothingness that is before birth, of the world in  the ice age.    A totally dead silence, on the other hand, a silence with no  possibilities, has the inner harmony of black. In music it is  represented by one of those profound and final pauses, after  which any continuation of the melody seems the dawn of another  world. Black is something burnt out, like the ashes of a funeral  pyre, something motionless like a corpse. The silence of black is  the silence of death. Outwardly black is the colour with least  harmony of all, a kind of neutral background against which the  minutest shades of other colours stand clearly forward. It  differs from white in this also, for with white nearly every  colour is in discord, or even mute altogether.    [Footnote: E.g. vermilion rings dull and muddy against white, but  against black with clear strength. Light yellow against white is  weak, against black pure and brilliant.]    Not without reason is white taken as symbolizing joy and spotless  purity, and black grief and death. A blend of black and white  produces gray which, as has been said, is silent and motionless,  being composed of two inactive colours, its restfulness having  none of the potential activity of green. A similar gray is  produced by a mixture of green and red, a spiritual blend of  passivity and glowing warmth.    [Footnote: Gray = immobility and rest. Delacroix sought to  express rest by a mixture of green and red (cf. Signac, sup.  cit.).]    The unbounded warmth of red has not the irresponsible appeal of  yellow, but rings inwardly with a determined and powerful  intensity. It glows in itself, maturely, and does not distribute  its vigour aimlessly (see Fig. 2).    The varied powers of red are very striking. By a skillful use of  it in its different shades, its fundamental tone may be made warm  or cold.    [Footnote: Of course every colour can be to some extent varied  between warm and cold, but no colour has so extensive a scale of  varieties as red.]    Light warm red has a certain similarity to medium yellow, alike  in texture and appeal, and gives a feeling of strength, vigour,  determination, triumph. In music, it is a sound of trumpets,  strong, harsh, and ringing.    Vermilion is a red with a feeling of sharpness, like glowing  steel which can be cooled by water. Vermilion is quenched by  blue, for it can support no mixture with a cold colour. More  accurately speaking, such a mixture produces what is called a  dirty colour, scorned by painters of today. But \"dirt\" as a  material object has its own inner appeal, and therefore to avoid  it in painting, is as unjust and narrow as was the cry of  yesterday for pure colour. At the call of the inner need that  which is outwardly foul may be inwardly pure, and vice versa.    The two shades of red just discussed are similar to yellow,  except that they reach out less to the spectator. The glow of red  is within itself. For this reason it is a colour more beloved  than yellow, being frequently used in primitive and traditional  decoration, and also in peasant costumes, because in the open air  the harmony of red and green is very beautiful. Taken by itself  this red is material, and, like yellow, has no very deep appeal.  Only when combined with something nobler does it acquire this  deep appeal. It is dangerous to seek to deepen red by an  admixture of black, for black quenches the glow, or at least  reduces it considerably.    But there remains brown, unemotional, disinclined for movement.  An intermixture of red is outwardly barely audible, but there  rings out a powerful inner harmony. Skillful blending can produce  an inner appeal of extraordinary, indescribable beauty. The  vermilion now rings like a great trumpet, or thunders like a  drum.    Cool red (madder) like any other fundamentally cold colour, can  be deepened--especially by an intermixture of azure. The  character of the colour changes; the inward glow increases, the  active element gradually disappears. But this active element is  never so wholly absent as in deep green. There always remains a  hint of renewed vigour, somewhere out of sight, waiting for a  certain moment to burst forth afresh. In this lies the great  difference between a deepened red and a deepened blue, because in  red there is always a trace of the material. A parallel in music  are the sad, middle tones of a cello. A cold, light red contains  a very distinct bodily or material element, but it is always  pure, like the fresh beauty of the face of a young girl. The  singing notes of a violin express this exactly in music.    Warm red, intensified by a suitable yellow, is orange. This blend  brings red almost to the point of spreading out towards the  spectator. But the element of red is always sufficiently strong  to keep the colour from flippancy. Orange is like a man,  convinced of his own powers. Its note is that of the angelus, or  of an old violin.    Just as orange is red brought nearer to humanity by yellow, so  violet is red withdrawn from humanity by blue. But the red in  violet must be cold, for the spiritual need does not allow of a  mixture of warm red with cold blue.    Violet is therefore both in the physical and spiritual sense a  cooled red. It is consequently rather sad and ailing. It is worn  by old women, and in China as a sign of mourning. In music it is  an English horn, or the deep notes of wood instruments (e.g. a  bassoon).    [Footnote: Among artists one often hears the question, \"How are  you?\" answered gloomily by the words \"Feeling very violet.\"]    The two last mentioned colours (orange and violet) are the fourth  and last pair of antitheses of the primitive colours. They stand  to each"]]]
