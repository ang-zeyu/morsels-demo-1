[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/485"],[0,"The Road to Oz (#12)"],[1,"need me bad, 'cause I'm always, ALWAYS, good.\"    At this they quickly whirled around to find a funny little man sitting  on a big copper chest, puffing smoke from a long pipe.  His hair was  grey, his whiskers were grey; and these whiskers were so long that he  had wound the ends of them around his waist and tied them in a hard  knot underneath the leather apron that reached from his chin nearly to  his feet, and which was soiled and scratched as if it had been used a  long time.  His nose was broad, and stuck up a little; but his eyes  were twinkling and merry.  The little man's hands and arms were as hard  and tough as the leather in his apron, and Dorothy thought Johnny Dooit  looked as if he had done a lot of hard work in his lifetime.    \"Good morning, Johnny,\" said the shaggy man.  \"Thank you for coming to  me so quickly.\"    \"I never waste time,\" said the newcomer, promptly.  \"But what's  happened to you?  Where did you get that donkey head?  Really, I  wouldn't have known you at all, Shaggy Man, if I hadn't looked at your  feet.\"    The shaggy man introduced Johnny Dooit to Dorothy and Toto and  Button-Bright and the Rainbow's Daughter, and told him the story of  their adventures, adding that they were anxious now to reach the  Emerald City in the Land of Oz, where Dorothy had friends who would  take care of them and send them safe home again.    \"But,\" said he, \"we find that we can't cross this desert, which turns  all living flesh that touches it into dust; so I have asked you to come  and help us.\"    Johnny Dooit puffed his pipe and looked carefully at the dreadful  desert in front of them--stretching so far away they could not see its  end.    \"You must ride,\" he said, briskly.    \"What in?\" asked the shaggy man.    \"In a sand-boat, which has runners like a sled and sails like a ship.  The wind will blow you swiftly across the desert and the sand cannot  touch your flesh to turn it into dust.\"    \"Good!\" cried Dorothy, clapping her hands delightedly.  \"That was the  way the Magic Carpet took us across.  We didn't have to touch the  horrid sand at all.\"    \"But where is the sand-boat?\" asked the shaggy man, looking all around  him.    \"I'll make you one,\" said Johnny Dooit.    As he spoke, he knocked the ashes from his pipe and put it in his  pocket.  Then he unlocked the copper chest and lifted the lid, and  Dorothy saw it was full of shining tools of all sorts and shapes.    Johnny Dooit moved quickly now--so quickly that they were astonished at  the work he was able to accomplish.  He had in his chest a tool for  everything he wanted to do, and these must have been magic tools  because they did their work so fast and so well.    The man hummed a little song as he worked, and Dorothy tried to listen  to it.  She thought the words were something like these:      The only way to do a thing    Is do it when you can,    And do it cheerfully, and sing    And work and think and plan.    The only real unhappy one    Is he who dares to shirk;    The only really happy one    Is he who cares to work.      Whatever Johnny Dooit was singing he was certainly doing things, and  they all stood by and watched him in amazement.    He seized an axe and in a couple of chops felled a tree.  Next he took  a saw and in a few minutes sawed the tree-trunk into broad, long  boards.  He then nailed the boards together into the shape of a boat,  about twelve feet long and four feet wide.  He cut from another tree a  long, slender pole which, when trimmed of its branches and fastened  upright in the center of the boat, served as a mast.  From the chest he  drew a coil of rope and a big bundle of canvas, and with these--still  humming his song--he rigged up a sail, arranging it so it could be  raised or lowered upon the mast.    Dorothy fairly gasped with wonder to see the thing grow so speedily  before her eyes, and both Button-Bright and Polly looked on with the  same absorbed interest.    \"It ought to be painted,\" said Johnny Dooit, tossing his tools back  into the chest, \"for that would make it look prettier.  But 'though I  can paint it for you in three seconds it would take an hour to dry, and  that's a waste of time.\"    \"We don't care how it looks,\" said the shaggy man, \"if only it will  take us across the desert.\"    \"It will do that,\" declared Johnny Dooit.  \"All you need worry about is  tipping over.  Did you ever sail a ship?\"    \"I've seen one sailed,\" said the shaggy man.    \"Good.  Sail this boat the way you've seen a ship sailed, and you'll be  across the sands before you know it.\"    With this he slammed down the lid of the chest, and the noise made them  all wink.  While they were winking the workman disappeared, tools and  all.          12.  The Deadly Desert Crossed      \"Oh, that's too bad!\" cried Dorothy; \"I wanted to thank Johnny Dooit  for all his kindness to us.\"    \"He hasn't time to listen to thanks,\" replied the shaggy man; \"but I'm  sure he knows we are grateful.  I suppose he is already at work in some  other part of the world.\"    They now looked more carefully at the sand-boat, and saw that the  bottom was modeled with two sharp runners which would glide through the  sand.  The front of the sand-boat was pointed like the bow of a ship,  and there was a rudder at the stern to steer by.    It had been built just at the edge of the desert, so that all its  length lay upon the gray sand except the after part, which still rested  on the strip of grass.    \"Get in, my dears,\" said the shaggy man; \"I'm sure I can manage this  boat as well as any sailor.  All you need do is sit still in your  places.\"    Dorothy got in, Toto in her arms, and sat on the bottom of the boat  just in front of the mast.  Button-Bright sat in front of Dorothy,  while Polly leaned over the bow.  The shaggy man knelt behind the mast.  When all were ready he raised the sail half-way.  The wind caught it.  At once the sand-boat started forward--slowly at first, then with added  speed.  The shaggy man pulled the sail way up, and they flew so fast  over the Deadly Desert that every one held fast to the sides of the  boat and scarcely dared to breathe.    The sand lay in billows, and was in places very uneven, so that the  boat rocked dangerously from side to side; but it never quite tipped  over, and the speed was so great that the shaggy man himself became  frightened and began to wonder how he could make the ship go slower.    \"It we're spilled in this sand, in the middle of the desert,\" Dorothy  thought to herself, \"we'll be nothing but dust in a few minutes, and  that will be the end of us.\"    But they were not spilled, and by-and-by Polychrome, who was clinging  to the bow and looking straight ahead, saw a dark line before them and  wondered what it was.  It grew plainer every second, until she  discovered it to be a row of jagged rocks at the end of the desert,  while high above these rocks she could see a tableland of green grass  and beautiful trees.    \"Look out!\" she screamed to the shaggy man.  \"Go slowly, or we shall  smash into the rocks.\"    He heard her, and tried to pull down the sail; but the wind would not  let go of the broad canvas and the ropes had become tangled.    Nearer and nearer they drew to the great rocks, and the shaggy man was  in despair because he could do nothing to stop the wild rush of the  sand-boat.    They reached the edge of the desert and bumped squarely into the rocks.  There was a crash as Dorothy, Button-Bright, Toto and Polly flew up in  the air in a curve like a skyrocket's, one after another landing high  upon the grass, where they rolled and tumbled for a time before they  could stop themselves.    The shaggy man flew after them, head first, and lighted in a heap  beside Toto, who, being much excited at the time, seized one of the  donkey ears between his teeth and shook and worried it as hard as he  could, growling angrily.  The shaggy man made the little dog let go,  and sat up to look around him.    Dorothy was feeling one of her front teeth, which was loosened by  knocking against her knee as she fell.  Polly was looking sorrowfully  at a rent in her pretty gauze gown, and Button-Bright's fox head had  stuck fast in a gopher hole and he was wiggling his little fat legs  frantically in an effort to get free.    Otherwise they were unhurt by the adventure; so the shaggy man stood up  and pulled Button-Bright out of the hole and went to the edge of the  desert to look at the sand-boat.  It was a mere mass of splinters now,  crushed out of shape against the rocks.  The wind had torn away the  sail and carried it to the top of a tall tree, where the fragments of  it fluttered like a white flag.    \"Well,\" he said, cheerfully, \"we're here; but where the here is I don't  know.\"    \"It must be some part of the Land of Oz,\" observed Dorothy, coming to  his side.    \"Must it?\"    \"'Course it must.  We're across the desert, aren't we?  And somewhere  in the middle of Oz is the Emerald City.\"    \"To be sure,\" said the shaggy man, nodding.  \"Let's go there.\"    \"But I don't see any people about, to show us the way,\" she continued.    \"Let's hunt for them,\" he suggested.  \"There must be people somewhere;  but perhaps they did not expect us, and so are not at hand to give us a  welcome.\"          13.  The Truth Pond      They now made a more careful examination of the country around them.  All was fresh and beautiful after the sultriness of the desert, and the  sunshine and sweet, crisp air were delightful to the wanderers.  Little  mounds of yellowish green were away at the right, while on the left  waved a group of tall leafy trees bearing yellow blossoms that looked  like tassels and pompoms.  Among the grasses carpeting the ground were  pretty buttercups and cowslips and marigolds.  After looking at these a  moment Dorothy said reflectively:    \"We must be in the Country of the Winkies, for the color of that  country is yellow, and you will notice that 'most everything here is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/486"],[0,"Ozma of Oz (#12)"],[1,"placed him near her so  that she might ask his advice about the journey while she ate.    Lower down the table were the twenty-seven warriors of Oz, and at the  end of the room the Lion and the Tiger were eating out of a kettle that  had been placed upon the floor, while Billina fluttered around to pick  up any scraps that might be scattered.    It did not take long to finish the meal, and then the Lion and the  Tiger were harnessed to the chariot and the party was ready to start  for the Nome King's Palace.    First rode Ozma, with Dorothy beside her in the golden chariot and  holding Billina fast in her arms.  Then came the Scarecrow on the  Sawhorse, with the Tin Woodman and Tiktok marching side by side just  behind him.  After these tramped the Army, looking brave and handsome  in their splendid uniforms.  The generals commanded the colonels and  the colonels commanded the majors and the majors commanded the captains  and the captains commanded the private, who marched with an air of  proud importance because it required so many officers to give him his  orders.    And so the magnificent procession left the palace and started along the  road just as day was breaking, and by the time the sun came out they  had made good progress toward the valley that led to the Nome King's  domain.          10.  The Giant with the Hammer      The road led for a time through a pretty farm country, and then past a  picnic grove that was very inviting.  But the procession continued to  steadily advance until Billina cried in an abrupt and commanding manner:    \"Wait--wait!\"    Ozma stopped her chariot so suddenly that the Scarecrow's Sawhorse  nearly ran into it, and the ranks of the army tumbled over one another  before they could come to a halt.  Immediately the yellow hen struggled  from Dorothy's arms and flew into a clump of bushes by the roadside.    \"What's the matter?\" called the Tin Woodman, anxiously.    \"Why, Billina wants to lay her egg, that's all,\" said Dorothy.    \"Lay her egg!\" repeated the Tin Woodman, in astonishment.    \"Yes; she lays one every morning, about this time; and it's quite  fresh,\" said the girl.    \"But does your foolish old hen suppose that this entire cavalcade,  which is bound on an important adventure, is going to stand still while  she lays her egg?\" enquired the Tin Woodman, earnestly.    \"What else can we do?\" asked the girl.  \"It's a habit of Billina's and  she can't break herself of it.\"    \"Then she must hurry up,\" said the Tin Woodman, impatiently.    \"No, no!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow.  \"If she hurries she may lay  scrambled eggs.\"    \"That's nonsense,\" said Dorothy.  \"But Billina won't be long, I'm sure.\"    So they stood and waited, although all were restless and anxious to  proceed.  And by and by the yellow hen came from the bushes saying:    \"Kut-kut, kut, ka-daw-kutt!  Kut, kut, kut--ka-daw-kut!\"    \"What is she doing--singing her lay?\" asked the Scarecrow.    \"For-ward--march!\" shouted the Tin Woodman, waving his axe, and the  procession started just as Dorothy had once more grabbed Billina in her  arms.    \"Isn't anyone going to get my egg?\" cried the hen, in great excitement.    \"I'll get it,\" said the Scarecrow; and at his command the Sawhorse  pranced into the bushes.  The straw man soon found the egg, which he  placed in his jacket pocket.  The cavalcade, having moved rapidly on,  was even then far in advance; but it did not take the Sawhorse long to  catch up with it, and presently the Scarecrow was riding in his  accustomed place behind Ozma's chariot.    \"What shall I do with the egg?\" he asked Dorothy.    \"I do not know,\" the girl answered.  \"Perhaps the Hungry Tiger would  like it.\"    \"It would not be enough to fill one of my back teeth,\" remarked the  Tiger.  \"A bushel of them, hard boiled, might take a little of the edge  off my appetite; but one egg isn't good for anything at all, that I  know of.\"    \"No; it wouldn't even make a sponge cake,\" said the Scarecrow,  thoughtfully.  \"The Tin Woodman might carry it with his axe and hatch  it; but after all I may as well keep it myself for a souvenir.\"  So he  left it in his pocket.    They had now reached that part of the valley that lay between the two  high mountains which Dorothy had seen from her tower window.  At the  far end was the third great mountain, which blocked the valley and was  the northern edge of the Land of Ev.  It was underneath this mountain  that the Nome King's palace was said to be; but it would be some time  before they reached that place.    The path was becoming rocky and difficult for the wheels of the chariot  to pass over, and presently a deep gulf appeared at their feet which  was too wide for them to leap.  So Ozma took a small square of green  cloth from her pocket and threw it upon the ground.  At once it became  the magic carpet, and unrolled itself far enough for all the cavalcade  to walk upon.  The chariot now advanced, and the green carpet unrolled  before it, crossing the gulf on a level with its banks, so that all  passed over in safety.    \"That's easy enough,\" said the Scarecrow.  \"I wonder what will happen  next.\"    He was not long in making the discovery, for the sides of the mountain  came closer together until finally there was but a narrow path between  them, along which Ozma and her party were forced to pass in single file.    They now heard a low and deep \"thump!--thump!--thump!\" which echoed  throughout the valley and seemed to grow louder as they advanced.  Then, turning a corner of rock, they saw before them a huge form, which  towered above the path for more than a hundred feet.  The form was that  of a gigantic man built out of plates of cast iron, and it stood with  one foot on either side of the narrow road and swung over its right  shoulder an immense iron mallet, with which it constantly pounded the  earth.  These resounding blows explained the thumping sounds they had  heard, for the mallet was much bigger than a barrel, and where it  struck the path between the rocky sides of the mountain it filled all  the space through which our travelers would be obliged to pass.    Of course they at once halted, a safe distance away from the terrible  iron mallet.  The magic carpet would do them no good in this case, for  it was only meant to protect them from any dangers upon the ground  beneath their feet, and not from dangers that appeared in the air above  them.    \"Wow!\" said the Cowardly Lion, with a shudder.  \"It makes me dreadfully  nervous to see that big hammer pounding so near my head.  One blow  would crush me into a door-mat.\"    \"The ir-on gi-ant is a fine fel-low,\" said Tiktok, \"and works as  stead-i-ly as a clock.  He was made for the Nome King by Smith &  Tin-ker, who made me, and his du-ty is to keep folks from find-ing the  un-der-ground pal-ace.  Is he not a great work of art?\"    \"Can he think, and speak, as you do?\" asked Ozma, regarding the giant  with wondering eyes.    \"No,\" replied the machine; \"he is on-ly made to pound the road, and has  no think-ing or speak-ing at-tach-ment.  But he pounds ve-ry well, I  think.\"    \"Too well,\" observed the Scarecrow.  \"He is keeping us from going  farther.  Is there no way to stop his machinery?\"    \"On-ly the Nome King, who has the key, can do that,\" answered Tiktok.    \"Then,\" said Dorothy, anxiously, \"what shall we do?\"    \"Excuse me for a few minutes,\" said the Scarecrow, \"and I will think it  over.\"    He retired, then, to a position in the rear, where he turned his  painted face to the rocks and began to think.    Meantime the giant continued to raise his iron mallet high in the air  and to strike the path terrific blows that echoed through the mountains  like the roar of a cannon.  Each time the mallet lifted, however, there  was a moment when the path beneath the monster was free, and perhaps  the Scarecrow had noticed this, for when he came back to the others he  said:    \"The matter is a very simple one, after all.  We have but to run under  the hammer, one at a time, when it is lifted, and pass to the other  side before it falls again.\"    \"It will require quick work, if we escape the blow,\" said the Tin  Woodman, with a shake of his head.  \"But it really seems the only thing  to be done.  Who will make the first attempt?\"    They looked at one another hesitatingly for a moment.  Then the  Cowardly Lion, who was trembling like a leaf in the wind, said to them:    \"I suppose the head of the procession must go first--and that's me.  But I'm terribly afraid of the big hammer!\"    \"What will become of me?\" asked Ozma.  \"You might rush under the hammer  yourself, but the chariot would surely be crushed.\"    \"We must leave the chariot,\" said the Scarecrow.  \"But you two girls  can ride upon the backs of the Lion and the Tiger.\"    So this was decided upon, and Ozma, as soon as the Lion was unfastened  from the chariot, at once mounted the beast's back and said she was  ready.    \"Cling fast to his mane,\" advised Dorothy.  \"I used to ride him myself,  and that's the way I held on.\"    So Ozma clung fast to the mane, and the lion crouched in the path and  eyed the swinging mallet carefully until he knew just the instant it  would begin to rise in the air.    Then, before anyone thought he was ready, he made a sudden leap  straight between the iron giant's legs, and before the mallet struck  the ground again the Lion and Ozma were safe on the other side.    The Tiger went next.  Dorothy sat upon his back and locked her arms  around his striped neck, for he had no mane to cling to.  He made the  leap straight and true as an arrow from a bow, and ere Dorothy realized  it she was out of danger and standing by Ozma's side.    Now came the Scarecrow on the Sawhorse, and while they made the dash in  safety they were within a hair's breadth of being caught by the  descending hammer.    Tiktok walked up to the very edge of the spot the hammer struck, and as  it was raised for the next blow he calmly stepped"]]]
