If  I remain long enough, I intend to compose six in this style, for it is  much liked here.        64.    Munich, Oct. 11, 1777.    WHY have I not as yet written anything about Misliweczeck? [See No. 43.]  Because I was only too glad not to think of him; for when he is spoken  of I invariably hear how highly he praises me, and what a kind and  true friend he is of mine; but then follow pity and lamentation. He  was described to me, and deeply was I distressed. How could I bear that  Misliweczeck, my intimate friend, should be in the same town, nay, even  in the same corner of the world with me, and neither see him nor speak  to him? Impossible! so I resolved to go to visit him. On the previous  day, I called on the manager of the Duke's Hospital to ask if I might  see my friend in the garden, which I thought best, though the doctors  assured me there was no longer any risk of infection. The manager agreed  to my proposal, and said I should find him in the garden between eleven  and twelve o'clock, and, if he was not there when I came, to send for  him. Next day I went with Herr von Hamm, secretary in the Crown Office,  (of whom I shall speak presently,) and mamma to the Duke's Hospital.  Mamma went into the Hospital church, and we into the garden.  Misliweczeck was not there, so we sent him a message. I saw him coming  across, and knew him at once from his manner of walking. I must tell  you that he had already sent me his remembrances by Herr Heller, a  violoncello-player, and begged me to visit him before I left Munich.  When he came up to me, we shook hands cordially. \"You see,\" said he,  \"how unfortunate I am.\" These words and his appearance, which papa is  already aware of from description, so went to my heart that I could only  say, with tears in my eyes, \"I pity you from my heart, my dear friend.\"  He saw how deeply I was affected, so rejoined quite cheerfully, \"Now  tell me what you are doing; when I heard that you were in Munich, I  could scarcely believe it; how could Mozart be here and not long ago  have come to see me?\" \"I hope you will forgive me, but I had such a  number of visits to make, and I have so many kind friends here.\" \"I feel  quite sure that you have indeed many kind friends, but a truer friend  than myself you cannot have.\" He asked me whether papa had told me  anything of a letter he had received. I said, \"Yes, he did write to me,\"  (I was quite confused, and trembled so much in every limb that I could  scarcely speak,) \"but he gave me no details.\" He then told me that  Signor Gaetano Santoro, the Neapolitan impresario, was obliged, owing  to impegni and protezione, to give the composition of the opera for this  Carnival to a certain Maestro Valentini; but he added, \"Next year he  has three at liberty, one of which is to be at my service. But as I  have already composed six times for Naples, I don't in the least mind  undertaking the less promising one, and making over to you the best  libretto, viz. the one for the Carnival. God knows whether I shall  be able to travel by that time, but if not, I shall send back the  scrittura. The company for next year is good, being all people whom I  have recommended. You must know that I have such influence in Naples  that, when I say engage such a one, they do so at once.\" Marquesi is  the primo uomo, whom he, and indeed all Munich too, praises very highly;  Marchiani is a good prima donna; and there is a tenor, whose name I  cannot recall, but Misliweczeck says he is the best in all Italy. He  also said, \"I do beg of you to go to Italy; there one is esteemed and  highly prized.\" And in truth he is right. When I come to reflect on the  subject, in no country have I received such honors, or been so esteemed,  as in Italy, and nothing contributes more to a man's fame than to have  written Italian operas, and especially for Naples. He said he would  write a letter for me to Santoro, which I was to copy out when I went  to see him next day; but finding it impossible to return, he sent me  a sketch of the letter to-day. I was told that when Misliweczeck heard  people here speaking of Becke, or other performers on the piano, he  invariably said, \"Let no one deceive himself; none can play like Mozart;  in Italy, where the greatest masters are, they speak of no one but  Mozart; when his name is mentioned, not a word is said of others.\" I can  now write the letter to Naples when I please; but, indeed, the sooner  the better. I should, however, first like to have the opinion of that  highly discreet Hofcapellmeister, Herr von Mozart. I have the most  ardent desire to write another opera. The distance is certainly great,  but the period is still a long way off when I am to write this opera,  and there may be many changes before then. I think I might at all events  undertake it. If, in the mean time, I get no situation, eh, bien! I  shall then have a resource in Italy. I am at all events certain to  receive 100 ducats in the Carnival; and when I have once written for  Naples I shall be sought for everywhere. As papa well knows, there is an  opera buffa in Naples in spring, summer, and autumn, for which I might  write for the sake of practice, not to be quite idle. It is true that  there is not much to be got by this, but still there is something,  and it would be the means of gaining more honor and reputation than by  giving a hundred concerts in Germany, and I am far happier when I have  something to compose, which is my chief delight and passion; and if I  get a situation anywhere, or have hopes of one, the scrittura would be  a great recommendation to me, and excite a sensation, and cause me to be  more thought of. This is mere talk, but still I say what is in my heart.  If papa gives me any good grounds to show that I am wrong, then I  will give it up, though, I own, reluctantly. Even when I hear an opera  discussed, or am in a theatre myself and hear voices, oh! I really am  beside myself!    To-morrow, mamma and I are to meet Misliweczeck in the Hospital garden  to take leave of him; for he wished me last time to fetch mamma out  of church, as he said he should like to see the mother of so great a  virtuoso. My dear papa, do write to him as often as you have time to do  so; you cannot confer a greater pleasure on him, for the man is quite  forsaken. Sometimes he sees no one for a whole week, and he said to me,  \"I do assure you it does seem so strange to me to see so few people; in  Italy I had company every day.\" He looks thin, of course, but is still  full of fire and life and genius, and the same kind, animated person  he always was. People talk much of his oratorio of \"Abraham and Isaac,\"  which he produced here. He has just completed (with the exception of  a few arias) a Cantata, or Serenata, for Lent; and when he was at the  worst he wrote an opera for Padua. Herr Heller is just come from him.  When I wrote to him yesterday I sent him the Serenata that I wrote in  Salzburg: for the Archduke Maximilian [\"Il Re Pastore\"].    Now to turn to something else. Yesterday I went with mamma immediately  after dinner to take coffee with the two Fraulein von Freysinger. Mamma,  however, took none, but drank two bottles of Tyrolese wine. At three  o'clock she went home again to make preparations for our journey. I,  however, went with the two ladies to Herr von Hamm's, whose three young  ladies each played a concerto, and I one of Aichner's prima vista, and  then went on extemporizing. The teacher of these little simpletons,  the Demoiselles Hamm, is a certain clerical gentleman of the name of  Schreier. He is a good organ-player, but no pianist. He kept staring  at me with an eye-glass. He is a reserved kind of man who does not talk  much; he patted me on the shoulder, sighed, and said, \"Yes--you are--you  understand--yes--it is true--you are an out-and-outer!\" By the by, can  you recall the name of Freysingen--the papa of the two pretty girls I  mentioned? He says he knows you well, and that he studied with you. He  particularly remembers Messenbrunn, where papa (this was quite new  to me) played most incomparably on the organ. He said, \"It was quite  startling to see the pace at which both hands and feet went, but quite  inimitable; a thorough master indeed; my father thought a great deal of  him; and how he humbugged the priests about entering the Church! You are  just what he was then, as like as possible; only he was a degree shorter  when I knew him.\" A propos, a certain Hofrath Effeln sends you his kind  regards; he is one of the best Hofraths here, and would long ago have  been made chancellor but for one defect--TIPPLING. When we saw him  for the first time at Albert's, both mamma and I thought, \"What an  odd-looking fish!\" Just imagine a very tall man, stout and corpulent,  and a ridiculous face. When he crosses the room to another table, he  folds both hands on his stomach, stoops very low, and then draws himself  up again, and makes little nods; and when this is over he draws back his  right foot, and does this to each individual separately. He says that  he knows papa intimately. I am now going for a little to the play. Next  time I will write more fully, but I can't possibly go on to-day, for my  fingers do ache uncommonly.    Munich, October 11th, at 1/4 to 12 at night, I write as follows:--I  have been at the Drittl comedy, but only went in time for the ballet, or  rather the pantomime, which I had not before seen. It is called \"Das von  der fur Girigaricanarimanarischaribari verfertigte Ei.\" It was very good  and funny. We are going to-morrow to Augsburg on account of Prince Taxis  not being at Ratisbon but at Teschingen. He is, in fact, at present at  his country-seat, which is, however, only an hour from Teschingen. I  send my sister, with this, four preludes; she will see and hear for  herself the different keys into which they lead. My compliments to all  my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5308"],[0,"The Paradise Mystery (#12)"],[1,"man who hadn't even a visiting-card  or a letter upon him? And from Australia, too!--where all the people  that are wanted run away to! I have actually been tempted to wonder, Dr.  Bryce, if Dr. Ransford knew this man--in years gone by? He might have,  you know, he might have--certainly! And that, of course, would explain  the flowers.\"    \"There is a great deal in the matter that requires explanation, Mrs.  Folliot,\" said Bryce. He was wondering if it would be wise to instil  some minute drop of poison into the lady's mind, there to increase in  potency and in due course to spread. \"I--of course, I may have been  mistaken--I certainly thought Dr. Ransford seemed unusually agitated by  this affair--it appeared to upset him greatly.\"    \"So I have heard--from others who were at the inquest,\" responded Mrs.  Folliot. \"In my opinion our Coroner--a worthy man otherwise--is not  sufficiently particular. I said to Mr. Folliot this morning, on reading  the newspaper, that in my view that inquest should have been adjourned  for further particulars. Now I know of one particular that was never  mentioned at the inquest!\"    \"Oh?\" said Bryce. \"And what?\"    \"Mrs. Deramore, who lives, as you know, next to Dr. Ransford,\" replied  Mrs. Folliot, \"told me this morning that on the morning of the accident,  happening to look out of one of her upper windows, she saw a man whom,  from the description given in the newspapers, was, Mrs. Deramore feels  assured, was the mysterious stranger, crossing the Close towards the  Cathedral in, Mrs. Deramore is positive, a dead straight line from  Dr. Ransford's garden--as if he had been there. Dr. Bryce!--a direct  question should have been asked of Dr. Ransford--had he ever seen that  man before?\"    \"Ah, but you see, Mrs. Folliot, the Coroner didn't know what Mrs.  Deramore saw, so he couldn't ask such a question, nor could any one  else,\" remarked Bryce, who was wondering how long Mrs. Deramore remained  at her upper window and if she saw him follow Braden. \"But there are  circumstances, no doubt, which ought to be inquired into. And it's  certainly very curious that Dr. Ransford should send a wreath to the  grave of--a stranger.\"    He went away convinced that Mrs. Folliot's inquisitiveness had been  aroused, and that her tongue would not be idle: Mrs. Folliot, left to  herself, had the gift of creating an atmosphere, and if she once got  it into her head that there was some mysterious connection between Dr.  Ransford and the dead man, she would never rest until she had spread her  suspicions. But as for Bryce himself, he wanted more than suspicions--he  wanted facts, particulars, data. And once more he began to go over the  sum of evidence which had accrued.    The question of the scrap of paper found in Braden's purse, and of the  exact whereabouts of Richard Jenkins's grave in Paradise, he left  for the time being. What was now interesting him chiefly was the  advertisement in the Times to which the bank-manager from London had  drawn attention. He had made haste to buy a copy of the Times and to  cut out the advertisement. There it was--old friend Marco was wanted by  (presumably old friend) Sticker, and whoever Sticker might be he could  certainly be found under care of J. Braden. It had never been in doubt  a moment, in Bryce's mind, that Sticker was J. Braden himself. Who, now,  was Marco? Who--a million to one on it!--but Ransford, whose Christian  name was Mark?    He reckoned up his chances of getting at the truth of the affair anew  that night. As things were, it seemed unlikely that any relations of  Braden would now turn up. The Wrychester Paradise case, as the reporters  had aptly named it, had figured largely in the newspapers, London and  provincial; it could scarcely have had more publicity--yet no one, save  this bank-manager, had come forward. If there had been any one to  come forward the bank-manager's evidence would surely have proved an  incentive to speed--for there was a sum of ten thousand pounds awaiting  John Braden's next-of-kin. In Bryce's opinion the chance of putting in  a claim to ten thousand pounds is not left waiting forty-eight  hours--whoever saw such a chance would make instant use of telegraph or  telephone. But no message from anybody professing relationship with the  dead man had so far reached the Wrychester police.    When everything had been taken into account, Bryce saw no better clue  for the moment than that suggested by Ambrose Campany--Barthorpe.  Ambrose Campany, bookworm though he was, was a shrewd, sharp fellow,  said Bryce--a man of ideas. There was certainly much in his suggestion  that a man wasn't likely to buy an old book about a little insignificant  town like Barthorpe unless he had some interest in it--Barthorpe, if  Campany's theory were true, was probably the place of John Braden's  origin.    Therefore, information about Braden, leading to knowledge of his  association or connection with Ransford, might be found at Barthorpe.  True, the Barthorpe police had already reported that they could tell  nothing about any Braden, but that, in Bryce's opinion, was neither  here nor there--he had already come to the conclusion that Braden was an  assumed name. And if he went to Barthorpe, he was not going to trouble  the police--he knew better methods than that of finding things out. Was  he going?--was it worth his while? A moment's reflection decided that  matter--anything was worth his while which would help him to get a  strong hold on Mark Ransford. And always practical in his doings, he  walked round to the Free Library, obtained a gazeteer, and looked up  particulars of Barthorpe. There he learnt that Barthorpe was an ancient  market-town of two thousand inhabitants in the north of Leicestershire,  famous for nothing except that it had been the scene of a battle at  the time of the Wars of the Roses, and that its trade was mainly in  agriculture and stocking-making--evidently a slow, sleepy old place.    That night Bryce packed a hand-bag with small necessaries for a few  days' excursion, and next morning he took an early train to London; the  end of that afternoon found him in a Midland northern-bound express,  looking out on the undulating, green acres of Leicestershire. And while  his train was making a three minutes' stop at Leicester itself, the  purpose of his journey was suddenly recalled to him by hearing the  strident voices of the porters on the platform.    \"Barthorpe next stop!--next stop Barthorpe!\"    One of two other men who shared a smoking compartment with Bryce turned  to his companion as the train moved off again.    \"Barthorpe?\" he remarked. \"That's the place that was mentioned in  connection with that very queer affair at Wrychester, that's been  reported in the papers so much these last few days. The mysterious  stranger who kept ten thousand in a London bank, and of whom nobody  seems to know anything, had nothing on him but a history of Barthorpe.  Odd! And yet, though you'd think he'd some connection with the place, or  had known it, they say nobody at Barthorpe knows anything about anybody  of his name.\"    \"Well, I don't know that there is anything so very odd about it, after  all,\" replied the other man. \"He may have picked up that old book for  one of many reasons that could be suggested. No--I read all that case  in the papers, and I wasn't so much impressed by the old book feature  of it. But I'll tell you what--there was a thing struck me. I know this  Barthorpe district--we shall be in it in a few minutes--I've been a good  deal over it. This strange man's name was given in the papers as John  Braden. Now close to Barthorpe--a mile or two outside it, there's a  village of that name--Braden Medworth. That's a curious coincidence--and  taken in conjunction with the man's possession of an old book about  Barthorpe--why, perhaps there's something in it--possibly more than I  thought for at first.\"    \"Well--it's an odd case--a very odd case,\" said the first speaker.  \"And--as there's ten thousand pounds in question, more will be heard of  it. Somebody'll be after that, you may be sure!\"    Bryce left the train at Barthorpe thanking his good luck--the man in  the far corner had unwittingly given him a hint. He would pay a visit to  Braden Medworth--the coincidence was too striking to be neglected. But  first Barthorpe itself--a quaint old-world little market-town, in  which some of even the principal houses still wore roofs of thatch, and  wherein the old custom of ringing the curfew bell was kept up. He found  an old-fashioned hotel in the marketplace, under the shadow of the  parish church, and in its oak-panelled dining-room, hung about with  portraits of masters of foxhounds and queer old prints of sporting and  coaching days, he dined comfortably and well.    It was too late to attempt any investigations that evening, and  when Bryce had finished his leisurely dinner he strolled into the  smoking-room--an even older and quainter apartment than that which  he had just left. It was one of those rooms only found in very old  houses--a room of nooks and corners, with a great open fireplace, and  old furniture and old pictures and curiosities--the sort of place to  which the old-fashioned tradesmen of the small provincial towns still  resort of an evening rather than patronize the modern political clubs.  There were several men of this sort in the room when Bryce entered,  talking local politics amongst themselves, and he found a quiet corner  and sat down in it to smoke, promising himself some amusement from the  conversation around him; it was his way to find interest and amusement  in anything that offered. But he had scarcely settled down in a  comfortably cushioned elbow chair when the door opened again and into  the room walked old Simpson Harker.          CHAPTER VIII.
