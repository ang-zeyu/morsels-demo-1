[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4552"],[0,"The Border Legion (#12)"],[1,"the play of the moving flare  of light. It was an intelligent, keen, strong face, but evil. Evil power  stood out in the lines, in the strange eyes, stranger then ever, now  in shadow; and it seemed once more the face of an alert, listening,  implacable man, with wild projects in mind, driving him to the doom he  meant for others. Pearce's red face shone redder in that ruddy light. It  was hard, lean, almost fleshless, a red mask stretched over a grinning  skull. The one they called Frenchy was little, dark, small-featured,  with piercing gimlet-like eyes, and a mouth ready to gush forth hate  and violence. The next two were not particularly individualized by any  striking aspect, merely looking border ruffians after the type of Bill  and Halloway. But Gulden, who sat at the end of the half-circle, was  an object that Joan could scarcely bring her gaze to study. Somehow her  first glance at him put into her mind a strange idea--that she was a  woman and therefore of all creatures or things in the world the farthest  removed from him. She looked away, and found her gaze returning,  fascinated, as if she were a bird and he a snake. The man was of huge  frame, a giant whose every move suggested the acme of physical power. He  was an animal--a gorilla with a shock of light instead of black hair,  of pale instead of black skin. His features might have been hewn and  hammered out with coarse, dull, broken chisels. And upon his face, in  the lines and cords, in the huge caverns where his eyes hid, and in the  huge gash that held strong, white fangs, had been stamped by nature  and by life a terrible ferocity. Here was a man or a monster in whose  presence Joan felt that she would rather be dead. He did not smoke; he  did not indulge in the coarse, good-natured raillery, he sat there like  a huge engine of destruction that needed no rest, but was forced to rest  because of weaker attachments. On the other hand, he was not sullen or  brooding. It was that he did not seem to think.    Kells had been rapidly gaining strength since the extraction of  the bullet, and it was evident that his interest was growing  proportionately. He asked questions and received most of his replies  from Red Pearce. Joan did not listen attentively at first, but presently  she regretted that she had not. She gathered that Kells's fame as  the master bandit of the whole gold region of Idaho, Nevada, and  northeastern California was a fame that he loved as much as the gold he  stole. Joan sensed, through the replies of these men and their attitude  toward Kells, that his power was supreme. He ruled the robbers and  ruffians in his bands, and evidently they were scattered from Bannack  to Lewiston and all along the border. He had power, likewise, over the  border hawks not directly under his leadership. During the weeks of his  enforced stay in the canon there had been a cessation of operations--the  nature of which Joan merely guessed--and a gradual accumulation of  idle wailing men in the main camp. Also she gathered, but vaguely, that  though Kells had supreme power, the organization he desired was yet  far from being consummated. He showed thoughtfulness and irritation by  turns, and it was the subject of gold that drew his intensest interest.    \"Reckon you figgered right, Jack,\" said Red Pearce, and paused as  if before a long talk, while he refilled his pipe. \"Sooner or later  there'll be the biggest gold strike ever made in the West. Wagon-trains  are met every day comin' across from Salt Lake. Prospectors are workin'  in hordes down from Bannack. All the gulches an' valleys in the Bear  Mountains have their camps. Surface gold everywhere an' easy to get  where there's water. But there's diggin's all over. No big strike yet.  It's bound to come sooner or later. An' then when the news hits the  main-traveled roads an' reaches back into the mountains there's goin' to  be a rush that'll make '49 an' '51 look sick. What do you say, Bate?\"    \"Shore will,\" replied a grizzled individual whom Kells had called Bate  Wood. He was not so young as his companions, more sober, less wild,  and slower of speech. \"I saw both '49 and '51. Them was days! But I'm  agreein' with Red. There shore will be hell on this Idaho border sooner  or later. I've been a prospector, though I never hankered after the hard  work of diggin' gold. Gold is hard to dig, easy to lose, an' easy to get  from some other feller. I see the signs of a comin' strike somewhere in  this region. Mebbe it's on now. There's thousands of prospectors in twos  an' threes an' groups, out in the hills all over. They ain't a-goin' to  tell when they do make a strike. But the gold must be brought out. An'  gold is heavy. It ain't easy hid. Thet's how strikes are discovered. I  shore reckon thet this year will beat '49 an' '51. An' fer two reasons.  There's a steady stream of broken an' disappointed gold-seekers  back-trailin' from California. There's a bigger stream of hopeful an'  crazy fortune hunters travelin' in from the East. Then there's the  wimmen an' gamblers an' such thet hang on. An' last the men thet the  war is drivin' out here. Whenever an' wherever these streams meet, if  there's a big gold strike, there'll be the hellishest time the world  ever saw!\"    \"Boys,\" said Kells, with a ring in his weak voice, \"it'll be a harvest  for my Border Legion.\"    \"Fer what?\" queried Bate Wood, curiously.    All the others except Gulden turned inquiring and interested faces  toward the bandit.    \"The Border Legion,\" replied Kells.    \"An' what's that?\" asked Red Pearce, bluntly.    \"Well, if the time's ripe for the great gold fever you say is coming,  then it's ripe for the greatest band ever organized. I'll organize. I'll  call it the Border Legion.\"    \"Count me in as right-hand, pard,\" replied Red, with enthusiasm.    \"An' shore me, boss,\" added Bate Wood.    The idea was received vociferously, at which demonstration the giant  Gulden raised his massive head and asked, or rather growled, in a heavy  voice what the fuss was about. His query, his roused presence, seemed to  act upon the others, even Kells, with a strange, disquieting or halting  force, as if here was a character or an obstacle to be considered. After  a moment of silence Red Pearce explained the project.    \"Huh! Nothing new in that,\" replied Gulden. \"I belonged to one once. It  was in Algiers. They called it the Royal Legion.\"    \"Algiers. What's thet?\" asked Bate Wood.    \"Africa,\" replied Gulden.    \"Say, Gul, you've been around some,\" said Red Pearce, admiringly. \"What  was the Royal Legion?\"    \"Nothing but a lot of devils from all over. The border there was the  last place. Every criminal was safe from pursuit.\"    \"What'd you do?\"    \"Fought among ourselves. Wasn't many in the Legion when I left.\"    \"Shore thet ain't strange!\" exclaimed Wood, significantly. But his  inference was lost upon Gulden.    \"I won't allow fighting in my Legion,\" said Kells, coolly. \"I'll pick  this band myself.\"    \"Thet's the secret,\" rejoined Wood. \"The right fellers. I've been in all  kinds of bands. Why, I even was a vigilante in '51.\"    This elicited a laugh from his fellows, except the wooden-faced Gulden.    \"How many do we want?\" asked Red Pearce.    \"The number doesn't matter. But they must be men I can trust and  control. Then as lieutenants I'll need a few young fellows, like you,  Red. Nervy, daring, cool, quick of wits.\"    Red Pearce enjoyed the praise bestowed upon him and gave his shoulders  a swagger. \"Speakin' of that, boss,\" he said, \"reminds me of a chap who  rode into Cabin Gulch a few weeks ago. Braced right into Beard's place,  where we was all playin' faro, an' he asks for Jack Kells. Right off  we all thought he was a guy who had a grievance, an' some of us was for  pluggin' him. But I kinda liked him an' I cooled the gang down. Glad  I did that. He wasn't wantin' to throw a gun. His intentions were  friendly. Of course I didn't show curious about who or what he was.  Reckoned he was a young feller who'd gone bad sudden-like an' was  huntin' friends. An' I'm here to say, boss, that he was wild.\"    \"What's his name?\" asked Kells.    \"Jim Cleve, he said,\" replied Pearce.    Joan Randle, hidden back in the shadows, forgotten or ignored by this  bandit group, heard the name Jim Cleve with pain and fear, but not  amaze. From the moment Pearce began his speech she had been prepared  for the revelation of her runaway lover's name. She trembled, and grew  a little sick. Jim had made no idle threat. What would she have given to  live over again the moment that had alienated him?    \"Jim Cleve,\" mused Kells. \"Never heard of him. And I never forget a name  or a face. What's he like?\"    \"Clean, rangy chap, big, but not too big,\" replied Pearce. \"All muscle.  Not more'n twenty three. Hard rider, hard fighter, hard gambler an'  drinker--reckless as hell. If only you can steady him, boss! Ask Bate  what he thinks.\"    \"Well!\" exclaimed Kells in surprise. \"Strangers are everyday occurrences  on this border. But I never knew one to impress you fellows as this  Cleve.... Bate, what do you say? What's this Cleve done? You're an old  head. Talk, sense, now.\"    \"Done?\" echoed Wood, scratching his grizzled head. \"What in the hell  ain't he done?... He rode in brazener than any feller thet ever stacked  up against this outfit. An' straight-off he wins the outfit. I don't  know how he done it. Mebbe it was because you seen he didn't care fer  anythin' or anybody on earth. He stirred us up. He won all the money we  had in camp--broke most of us--an' give it all back. He drank more'n the  whole outfit, yet didn't get drunk. He threw his gun on Beady Jones  fer cheatin' an' then on Beady's pard, Chick Williams. Didn't shoot to  kill--jest winged 'em. But say, he's the quickest and smoothest hand to  throw a gun thet ever hit this border. Don't overlook thet.... Kells,  this Jim Cleve's a great youngster goin' bad quick.

It had a breadth which Caesar represents by nine long days' march.[201]  The other, of much less extent, took its rise in the forest of  Thuringia; it embraced all the mountains to the north of Bohemia, and  that long chain which separates the basins of the Oder and the Vistula  from that of the Danube.    The Suevi inhabited, to the south of the forest Bacenis, the countries  situated between the forest of Thuringia, the Boehmerwald, the Inn, and  the Black Forest, which compose, in our days, the Duchies of  Saxe-Meiningen and Saxe-Coburg, Bavaria, and the greater part of  Wurtemberg.[202] To the east of the Suevi were the Boii (_partly in  Bohemia and partly in the north-west of Austria_);[203] to the north,  the Cherusci, separated from the Suevi by the forest Bacenis; to the  west, the Marcomanni (_the upper and middle course of the Maine_) and  the Sedusii (_between the Maine and the Neckar_); to the south, the  Harudes (_on the north of the Lake of Constance_), the Tulingi, and the  Latobriges (_the southern part of the Grand Duchy of Baden_).    On the two banks of the Rhine dwelt the Rauraci (_the territory of Bale  and part of the Brisgau_); the Triboces (_part of Alsace and of the  Grand Duchy of Baden_): on the right bank were the Nemetes (_opposite  Spire_); the Vangiones (_opposite Worms_); the Ubii, from the Odenwald  to the watershed of the Sieg and the Ruhr. To the north of the Ubii were  the Sicambri, established in Sauerland, and nearly as far as the Lippe.  Finally, the Usipetes and the Tencteri were still farther to the north,  towards the mouth of the Rhine. (_See Plate 2._)      [Sidenote: The Gauls solicit Caesar to come to their assistance.]    II. The Gaulish chiefs who had come to solicit the succour of Caesar made  the following complaints against Ariovistus:--\"The German king,\" they  said, \"had taken advantage of the quarrels which divided the different  peoples of Gaul; called in formerly by the Arverni and the Sequani, he  had gained, with their co-operation, several victories over the AEdui, in  consequence of which the latter were subjected to the most humiliating  conditions. Shortly afterwards his yoke grew heavy on the Sequani  themselves, to such a degree that, though conquerors with him, they are  now more wretched than the vanquished AEdui. Ariovistus has seized a  third of their territory;[204] another third is on the point of being  given up, by his orders, to 24,000 Harudes, who have joined him some  months ago. There are 120,000 Germans in Gaul. The contingents of the  Suevi have already arrived on the banks of the Rhine. In a few years the  invasion of Gaul by the Germans will be general. Caesar alone can prevent  it, by his prestige and that of the Roman name, by the force of his  arms, and by the fame of his recent victory.\"    Gaul thus came voluntarily, in the persons of her chiefs, to throw  herself into the arms of Caesar, take him for the arbiter of her destiny,  and implore him to be her saviour. He spoke encouragingly, and promised  them his support. Several considerations engaged him to act upon these  complaints. He could not suffer the AEdui, allies of Rome, to be brought  under subjection by the barbarians. He saw a substantial danger for the  Republic in the numerous immigrations of fierce peoples who, once  masters of Gaul, would not fail, in imitation of the Cimbri and  Teutones, to invade the Roman province, and thence fall upon Italy.  Resolved to prevent these dangers, he proposed an interview with  Ariovistus, who was probably occupied, since the defeat of the  Helvetii, in collecting an army among the Triboci (towards  Strasburg),[205] as well to oppose the further designs of the Romans, as  to defend the part of the country of the Sequani which he had seized.  Ariovistus, it will be remembered, had been declared, under Caesar's  consulate, ally and friend of the Roman people; and this favour would  encourage the expectation that the head of the Germans would be willing  to treat; but he refused with disdain the proposed interview. Then Caesar  sent messengers to him to reproach him with his ingratitude. \"If  Ariovistus cares to preserve his friendship, let him make reparation for  all the injury he has inflicted upon the allies of Rome, and let him  bring no more barbarians across the Rhine; if, on the contrary, he  rejects these conditions, so many acts of violence will be punished in  virtue of the decree rendered by the Senate, under the consulate of M.  Messala and M. Piso, which authorises the governor of Gaul to do that  which he judges for the advantage of the Republic, and enjoins him to  defend the AEdui and the other allies of the Roman people.\"    By this language, Caesar wished to show that he did not violate the law,  enacted a year before under his consulate, which forbade the governors  to leave their provinces without an order of the Senate. He purposely  appealed to an old decree, which gave unlimited powers to the governor  of Gaul, a province the importance of which had always required  exceptional laws.[206] The reply of Ariovistus was equally proud:--    \"Caesar ought to know as well as he the right of the conqueror: he admits  no interference in the treatment reserved for the vanquished; he has  himself causes of complaint against the proconsul, whose presence  diminishes his revenues; he will not restore the hostages to the AEdui;  the title of brothers and allies of the Roman people will be of little  service to them. He cares little for threats. No one has ever braved  Ariovistus with impunity. Let anybody attack him, and he will learn the  valour of a people which, for fourteen years, has never sought shelter  under a roof.\"[207]      [Sidenote: March of Caesar upon Besancon.]    III. This arrogant reply, and news calculated to give alarm, hastened  Caesar's decision. In fact, on one side the AEdui complained to him of the  devastation of their country by the Harudes; and, on the other, the  Treviri announced that the hundred cantons of the Suevi were preparing  to cross the Rhine.[208] Caesar, wishing to prevent the junction of  these new bands with the old troops of Ariovistus, hastened the  collecting of provisions, and advanced against the Germans by forced  marches. The negotiations having probably lasted during the month of  July, it was now the beginning of August. Starting from the  neighbourhood of Tonnerre, where we have supposed he was encamped, Caesar  followed the road subsequently replaced by a Roman way of which vestiges  are still found, and which, passing by Tanlay, Gland, Laignes, Etrochey,  and Dancevoir, led to Langres.[209] (_See Plate 4._) After three long  days' marches, on his arrival towards Arc-en-Barrois, he learnt that  Ariovistus was moving with all his troops to seize Besancon, the most  considerable place in Sequania, and that he had already advanced three  days' march beyond his territory. Caesar considered it a matter of  urgency to anticipate him, for this place was abundantly provided with  everything necessary for an army. Instead of continuing his march  towards the Rhine, by way of Vesoul, Lure, and Belfort, he advanced, day  and night, by forced marches, towards Besancon, obtained possession of  it, and placed a garrison there.[210]    The following description, given in the \"Commentaries,\" is still  applicable to the present town. \"It was so well fortified by nature,  that it offered every facility for sustaining war. The Doubs, forming a  circle, surrounds it almost entirely, and the space of sixteen hundred  feet,[211] which is not bathed by the water, is occupied by a high  mountain, the base of which reaches, on each side, to the edge of the  river. The wall which encloses this mountain makes a citadel of it, and  connects it with the _oppidum_.\"[212]    During this rapid movement of the Roman army on Besancon, Ariovistus had  advanced very slowly. We must suppose, indeed, that he halted when he  was informed of this march; for, once obliged to abandon the hope of  taking that place, it was imprudent to separate himself any farther from  his re-enforcements, and, above all, from the Suevi, who were ready to  pass the Rhine towards Mayence, and await the Romans in the plains of  Upper Alsace, where he could advantageously make use of his numerous  cavalry.      [Sidenote: Panic in the Roman Army.]    IV. During the few days which Caesar passed at Besancon (the middle of  August), in order to assure himself of provisions, a general panic took  possession of his soldiers. Public rumour represented the Germans as men  of gigantic stature, of unconquerable valour, and of terrible aspect.  Now there were in the Roman army many young men without experience in  war, come from Rome, some out of friendship for Caesar, others in the  hope of obtaining celebrity without trouble. Caesar could not help  receiving them. It must have been difficult, indeed, for a general who  wished to preserve his friends at Rome, to defend himself against the  innumerable solicitations of influential people.[213] This panic had  begun with these volunteers; it soon gained the whole army. Every one  made his will; the least timid alleged, as an excuse for their fear, the  difficulty of the roads, the depth of the forests, the want of  provisions, the impossibility of obtaining transports, and even the  illegality of the enterprise.[214]    Caesar, surprised at this state of feeling, called a council, to which he  admitted the centurions of all classes. He sharply reproached the  assembled chiefs with wishing to penetrate his designs, and to seek  information as to the country into which he intended to lead them. He  reminded them that their fathers, under Marius, had driven out the  Cimbri and the Teutones; that, still more recently, they had defeated  the German race in the revolt of the slaves;[215] that the Helvetii had  often beaten the Germans,"]]]
