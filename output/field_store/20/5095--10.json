His confession  was reduced in writing, sworn to before a magistrate, and now at last  I feel myself a free man. No one now could charge me with a crime from  which my soul revolted.    \"When this matter was concluded, my first thought was of the boy whom I  had not seen for thirteen long years. I could claim him now before all  the world; I could endow him with the gifts of fortune; I could bring  him up in luxury, and I could satisfy a father's affectionate longing. I  could not immediately ascertain where you were. I wrote to Fultonville,  to the postmaster, and learned that you and Mr. Brent had moved away and  settled down in Gresham, in the State of New York. I learned also that  my Philip was still living, but other details I did not learn. But I  cared not, so long as my boy still lived.    \"And now you may guess my wish and my intention. I shall pay you  handsomely for your kind care of Philip, but I must have my boy back  again. We have been separated too long. I can well understand that you  are attached to him, and I will find a home for you and Mr. Brent near  my own, where you can see as often as you like the boy whom you have so  tenderly reared. Will you do me the favor to come at once, and bring  the boy with you? The expenses of your journey shall, of course,  be reimbursed, and I will take care that the pecuniary part of my  obligations to you shall be amply repaid. I have already explained why I  cannot come in person to claim my dear child.    \"Telegraph to me when you will reach Philadelphia, and I will engage  a room for you. Philip will stay with me.    \"Yours gratefully,    \"OSCAR GRANVILLE.\"      \"Mother, here is a slip of paper that has dropped from the letter,\" said  Jonas.    He picked up and handed to his mother a check on a Philadelphia bank for  the sum of one hundred dollars.    \"Why, that's the same as money, isn't it?\" asked Jonas.    \"Yes, Jonas.\"    \"Then you'll keep your promise, won't you?\"    Mrs. Brent silently drew from her pocket-book a two-dollar bill and  handed it to Jonas.    \"Jonas,\" she said, \"if you won't breathe a word of it, I will tell you a  secret.\"    \"All right, mother.\"    \"We start for Philadelphia to-morrow.\"    \"By gosh! that's jolly,\" exclaimed Jonas, overjoyed. \"I'll keep mum.  What was in the letter, mother?\"    \"I will not tell you just now. You shall know very soon.\"    Mrs. Brent did not sleep much that night. Her mind was intent upon a  daring scheme of imposture. Mr. Granville was immensely wealthy, no  doubt. Why should she not pass off Jonas upon him as his son Philip, and  thus secure a fortune for her own child?        CHAPTER XVII.    JONAS JOINS THE CONSPIRACY.    Later in the evening Mrs. Brent took Jonas into her confidence. She  was a silent, secretive woman by nature, and could her plan have been  carried out without imparting it to any one, she would gladly have had  it so. But Jonas must be her active accomplice, and it was as well to  let him know at once what he must do.    In the evening, when Jonas, tired with his day's skating, was lying on  the lounge, Mrs. Brent rose deliberately from her seat, peeped into  the adjoining room, then went to each window to make sure there was no  eavesdropper, then resumed her seat and said:    \"Jonas, get up. I want to speak to you.\"    \"I am awfully tired, mother. I can hear you while I lie here.\"    \"Jonas, do you hear me? I am about to speak to you of something no other  person must hear. Get a chair and draw it close to mine.\"    Jonas rose, his curiosity stimulated by his mother's words and manner.    \"Is it about the letter, mother?\" he asked.    \"Yes, it relates to the letter and our journey to-morrow.\"    Jonas had wondered what the letter was about and who had sent his mother  the hundred-dollar check, and he made no further objection. He drew a  chair in front of his mother and said:    \"Go ahead, mother, I'm listening.\"    \"Would you like to be rich, Jonas?\" asked Mrs. Brent.    \"Wouldn't I?\"    \"Would you like to be adopted by a very rich man, have a pony to ride,  plenty of pocket-money, fine clothes and in the end a large fortune?\"    \"That would just suit me, mother,\" answered the boy eagerly. \"Is there  any chance of it?\"    \"Yes, if you follow my directions implicitly.\"    \"I will, mother,\" said Jonas, his eyes shining with desire. \"Only tell  me what to do and I'll do it.\"    \"Do you remember what I told Philip the evening before he went away?\"    \"About his being left at Mr. Brent's hotel? Yes, I remember it.\"    \"And about his true father having disappeared?\"    \"Yes, yes.\"    \"Jonas, the letter I received this afternoon was from Philip's real  father.\"    \"By gosh!\" ejaculated Jonas, altering his usual expression of surprise.    \"He is in Philadelphia. He is a very rich man.\"    \"Then Phil will be rich,\" said Jonas, disappointed. \"I thought you said  it would be me.\"    \"Philip's father has never seen him since he was three years old,\"  continued Mrs. Brent, taking no notice of her son's tone.    \"What difference does that make, mother?\"    \"Jonas,\" said Mrs. Brent, bending toward her son, \"if I choose to  tell him that you are Philip, he won't know the difference. Do you  understand?\"    Jonas did understand.    \"That's a bully idea, mother! Can we pull the wool over the old man's  eyes, do you think?\"    \"I wish you would not use such expressions, Jonas. They are not  gentlemanly, and you are to be a young gentleman.\"    \"All right, mother.\"    \"We can manage it if you are very careful. It is worth the trouble,  Jonas. I think Mr. Granville--that is his name--must be worth a quarter  of a million dollars, and if he takes you for Philip the whole will  probably go to you.\"    \"What a head you've got, mother!\" exclaimed Jonas admiringly. \"It is a  tip-top chance.\"    \"Yes, it is one chance in ten thousand. But you must do just as I tell  you.\"    \"Oh, I'll do that, mother. What must I do?\"    \"To begin with, you must take Philip's name. You must remember that you  are no longer Jonas Webb, but Philip Brent.\"    \"That'll be a bully joke!\" said Jonas, very much amused. \"What would  Phil say if he knew I had taken his name?\"    \"He must not know. Henceforth we must endeavor to keep out of his way.  Again, you must consider me your step-mother, not your own mother.\"    \"Yes, I understand. What are you going to do first, mother?\"    \"We start for Philadelphia to-morrow. Your father is lying sick at the  Continental Hotel.\"    Jonas roared with delight at the manner in which his mother spoke of the  sick stranger.    \"Oh, it'll be fun, mother! Shall we live in Philadelphia?\"    \"I don't know. That will be as Mr. Granville thinks best.\"    \"Where are you going, mother? Are you going to live here?\"    \"Of course I shall be with you. I will make that a condition. I cannot  be parted from my only boy.\"    \"But I shall be Mr. Granville's boy.\"    \"To the public you will be. But when we are together in private, we  shall be once more mother and son.\"    \"I am afraid you will spoil all,\" said Jonas. \"Old Granville will  suspect something if you seem to care too much for me.\"    The selfish nature of Jonas was cropping out, and his mother felt, with  a pang, that he would be reconciled to part with her forever for  the sake of the brilliant prospects and the large fortune which Mr.  Granville could offer him.    She was outwardly cold, but such affection as she was capable of she  expended on this graceless and ungrateful boy.    \"You seem to forget that I may have some feeling in the matter,\" said  Mrs. Brent coldly, but with inward pain. \"If the result of this plan  were to be that we should be permanently separated, I would never  consent to it.\"    \"Just as you like, mother,\" said Jonas, with an ill grace. \"I don't look  much like Phil.\"    \"No, there will be a difficulty. Still Mr. Granville has never seen  Philip since he was three years old, and that is in our favor. He thinks  I am Mr. Brent's first wife.\"    \"Shall you tell him?\"    \"I don't know. I will be guided by circumstances. Perhaps it may be  best. I wouldn't like to have it discovered that I had deceived him in  that.\"    \"How are you going to manage about this place, mother?\"    \"I am going to write to your Uncle Jonas to take charge of it. I will  let him have it at a nominal rent. Then, if our plan miscarries we shall  have a place to come back to.\"    \"Were you ever in Philadelphia, mother?\"    \"No; but there will be no trouble in journeying there. I shall pack  your clothes and my own to-night. Of course, Jonas, when you meet Mr.  Granville you must seem to be fond of him. Then you must tell him how  kind I have been to you. In fact, you must act precisely as Philip might  be expected to do.\"    \"Yes, mother; and you must be careful not to call me Jonas. That will  spoil all, you know.\"    \"Rest assured that I shall be on my guard. If you are as careful as I  am, Philip----\"    Jonas burst into a guffaw at the new name.    \"It's just like play-acting, mother,\" he said.    \"But it will pay better,\" said Mrs. Brent quietly. \"I think it will be  best for me to begin calling you Philip at once--that is, as soon as we  have left town--so that we may both get accustomed to it.\"    \"All right, mother. You've got a good headpiece.\"    \"I will manage things properly. If you consent to be guided by me, all  will be right.\"    \"Oh, I'll do it mother. I wish we were on our way.\"    \"You can go to bed if you like. I must stay up late to-night. I have to  pack our trunks.\"    The next day the pair of adventurers left Gresham. From the earliest  available point Mrs. Brent telegraphed to Mr. Granville that she was on  her way, with the son from whom he had so long been separated.        CHAPTER XVIII.    THE CONSPIRACY SUCCEEDS.    In a handsome private parlor at the Continental Hotel a man of about  forty-five years of age sat in an easy-chair. He was of middle height,  rather dark complexion, and a pleasant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46202"],[0,"A New Witness for God (Volume 1 of 3) (#12)"],[1,"of the empire, excepting in Gaul,  where Constantine governed; and there, it will be remembered, a  previous persecution under Aurelius and Verus had well-nigh destroyed  the churches. Public worship was suspended. The saints were either  driven to apostasy by tortures, had fled from the provinces to the  barbarians, or kept themselves concealed. Meantime the magistrates  incited as much by avarice as by hatred of Christianity, confiscated  not only the church property, but also the private possessions of the  ministers. In other cases the church leaders were either slain, or  mutilated and sent to the mines or banished from the country. \"Many  through dread of undergoing torture had made way with their own lives,  and many apostatized from the faith; and what remained of the Christian  community, consisted of weak, poor and timorous persons.\" [26]    After adopting these measures for the destruction of the church,  severities of another character were put in operation. \"It was thought  necessary to subject to the most intolerable hardships the condition  of those perverse individuals who should still reject the religion  of nature, of Rome, and of their ancestors. Persons of liberal birth  were declared incapable of holding any honors or employments; slaves  were forever deprived of the hopes of freedom, and the whole body of  the people were put out of the protection of the law. The judges were  authorized to hear and determine every action that was brought against  a Christian. But the Christians were not permitted to complain of any  injury which they themselves had suffered; and thus those unfortunate  sectaries were exposed to the severity, while they were excluded from  the benefits of public justice. This new species of martyrdom, so  painful and lingering, so obscure and ignominious was, perhaps, the  most proper to weary the constancy of the faithful; nor can it be  doubted that the passions and interest of mankind were disposed on this  occasion to second the designs of the emperors.\" [27] That the Romans  considered the destruction of the Christian church completed by the  Diocletian persecution is witnessed by the inscriptions upon monuments  and medals. Two pillars in Spain, erected to commemorate the reign of  Diocletian bore the following; on the first--    \"DIOCLETIAN, JOVIAN, MAXIMIAN HERCULIUS, CAESARES AUGUSTI, FOR HAVING  EXTENDED THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE EAST AND WEST, AND FOR HAVING  EXTINGUISHED THE NAME OF CHRISTIANS, WHO BROUGHT THE REPUBLIC TO RUIN;\"    On the second,    \"DIOCLETIAN, ETC., FOR HAVING ADOPTED GALERIUS IN THE EAST, FOR HAVING  EVERYWHERE ABOLISHED THE SUPERSTITION OF CHRIST, FOR HAVING EXTENDED  THE WORSHIP OF THE GODS.\"    And on the medal of Diocletian this: \"THE NAME OF CHRISTIAN BEING  EXTINGUISHED.\" [28]    When it is remembered that these persecutions, to which I have briefly  referred, ran through more than three centuries; that the emperors  whose edicts inaugurated them possessed unlimited power to execute  their decrees; that the age in which they occurred was cruel beyond  modern comprehension; that Roman, that is to say, pagan hatred of  Christians was venomously bitter, because they were made to believe  that the existence of the ancient religion of Rome and latterly the  existence of the empire itself depended upon the destruction of  Christianity--when all this is remembered, it is not to be wondered  at that the saints were worn out, or so nearly so that only \"weak and  timorous\" men were left to ineffectually resist the paganization of  Christianity--the destruction of the Church of Christ.

The situation was this: A year after his elevation to the imperial  throne, Diocletian, believing the government of the vast empire of  Rome a task too great for a single mind, chose Maximianus Herculius,  commonly called Maximian, to be his colleague and to share with him  the title of Augustus. After a few years each of the emperors chose a  colleague in order to still further divide the labor of administration.  These were Constantius Chlorus and Galerius Maximianus, usually called  by his first name. Constantius and Galerius occupied an inferior  position to that of Diocletian and Maximian, and were honored only with  the title of \"Caesar.\"    18. Eusebius Eccl. Hist., Bk. viii, Ch. ii.    19.

Gibbon claims, however, that  \"notwithstanding the severity of this law, the virtuous courage of many  of the pagans in concealing their friends or relatives, affords an  honorable proof, that the rage of superstition had not extinguished in  their minds the sentiments of nature and humanity.\"--_Ibid_.    26. Schlegel, quoted by Murdock, see note Mosheim's Eccl. Hist., Cent.  iv, Bk. ii. Ch. i.    27. \"Decline and Fall,\" Vol. i, ch. xvi, p. 477. Gibbon undertakes  to modify what he has here written by saying that the policy of a  well-ordered government must sometimes have interposed in behalf of the  oppressed Christians. \"This wants proof,\" says Milman in a footnote  on the remark, \"the edict of Diocletian was executed in all its rigor  during the rest of the reign;\" and gives reference to Eusebius Eccl.  Hist., Bk. viii, ch. xiii.    28. See Milner's Church History, Vol. ii, cent. iv, ch. ii, I also give  the following in evidence of the severity of the persecution of the  Christians in the early centuries of our era; and since it is taken  from the funeral oration pronounced by Libanius over the body of his  friend, the Emperor Julian, commonly called the apostate--because in  manhood he renounced that Christianity which had been forced on him in  childhood, and attempted to restore the ancient religion of Rome--it  is of the same character of evidence as that already found in the  statements of Tacitus and Pliny--it is the testimony of one unfriendly  to Christianity, who could have no motive for exaggerating the  sufferings of the Christians. Referring to the mildness of the methods  of persecution adopted by Julian against the Christians, Labanius says:  \"They who adhered to corrupt religion [he means the Christians] were  in great terrors [on his accession to the throne] and expected that  their eyes would be plucked out, that their heads would be cut off, and  that rivers of their blood would flow from the multitude of slaughters.  They apprehended their new master would invent new kinds of torment,  in comparison of which mutilation, sword, fire, drowning, being buried  alive, would appear slight pains. _For the preceding emperors had  employed against them all these kinds of punishments_.\"        CHAPTER III.    THE EFFECT OF PEACE, WEALTH AND LUXURY ON CHRISTIANITY.    Disastrous as the persecutions of the early Christian centuries were,  still more mischievous to the church were those periods of tranquility  which intervened between the outbursts of rage that prompted them.  Peace may have her victories, no less renowned than those of war; and  so, too, she has her calamities, and they are not less destructive than  those of war. War may destroy nations, but ease and luxury mankind  corrupt--the body and the mind. Especially is peace dangerous to the  church. Prosperity relaxes the reins of discipline; people feel less  and less the need of a sustaining providence; but in adversity the  spirit of man feels after God, and he is correspondingly more devoted  to the service of religion.    We shall find the early Christians no exception to the operation of  this influence of repose. Whenever it was accorded them, either through  the mercy or the indifference of the emperors, internal dissensions,  the intrigues of aspiring prelates and the rise of heresies  characterized those periods. Even Milner, who wrote his great work to  counteract the influence of the too candid Mosheim; who takes to task  other "]]]
