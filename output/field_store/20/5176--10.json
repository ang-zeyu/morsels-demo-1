It was well known  that the actual destruction of sheep was mainly owing to the two days  of heavy rain which succeeded the snow. Out of a flock of 13,000 of all  ages, we lost, on the lowest calculation, 1,000 grown sheep and nearly  3,000 lambs; and yet our loss was small by comparison with that of  our neighbours, whose runs were further back among the hill, and less  sheltered than our own.    Long before midsummer our cloud-shadowed hills were green once more; and  I think I see again their beautiful outlines, their steep sides planted  with semi-tropical palms and grasses, whilst the more distant peaks are  veiled in a sultry haze. During that peculiarly bright and lovely summer  we often ask each other, Could it have been true that no one knew one  mountain from the other, and that hills had been apparently levelled and  vallies filled up by the heaviest snow-fall ever known. But whilst the  words were on our lips, we could see a group of palm-trees, ten feet  high, with their topmost leaves gnawed to the stump by starving sheep,  that must have been standing on at least seven feet of snow to reach  them; and there was scarcely a creek on the run whose banks were not  strewn, for many a long day, by bare and bleaching bones.        Chapter VI: Buying a run.      Like many other people in the world, I have occasionally built castles  in the air, and equally of course they have invariably tumbled down in  due time with a crash This particular castle however, not only attained  to a great elevation in the visionary builder's eyes, but it covered so  vast an area of land, that the story of its rise and fall deserves to  be placed on record, as a warning to aerial architects and also as a  beacon-light to young colonists.    This was exactly the way it all happened. The new year of 186-found us  living very quietly and happily on a small compact sheep-farm, at the  foot of the Malvern Hills, in the province of Canterbury, New Zealand.  As runs went, its dimensions were small indeed; for we only measured  it at 12,000 acres, all told. The great tidal wave of prosperity, which  sets once in a while towards the shores of all colonies, had that year  swelled and risen to its full force; but this we did not know. Borne  aloft upon its unsubstantial crest we could not, from that giddy height,  discern any water-valleys of adversity or clouds of change and  storm along the shining horizon of the new world around us. All our  calculations were based on the assumption that the existing prices for  sheep, wool, cattle, and all farm-produce, would rule for many a long  day; and the delightful part of this royal road to wealth was, that its  travellers need not exert themselves in any way: they had only to sit  still with folded hands whilst their sheep increased, and it was well  known that a flock doubled itself in three short years. The obvious  deduction from this agreeable numerical fact was, that in an equally  short period your agent's payments to your bank account would also be  doubled. In the meantime the drays were busy carting the wool to the  seaports as fast as they could be loaded, whilst speculative drovers  rode all about the country buying up the fat cattle and wethers from  every run. These were wanted to supply the West Coast Diggings which had  just \"broken out\" (as the curious phrase goes there), and so was every  description of grain and dairy produce.    We squatters were not the only inhabitants of this fool's paradise. The  local Government began planning extensive works: railways were laid  out in every direction, bridges planned across rivers, which proved  the despair of engineers; whilst a tunnel, the wonder of the Southern  Hemisphere, was commenced through a range of hills lying between Port  Lyttleton and Christchurch. All this work was undertaken on a scale of  pay which made the poor immigrants who thronged to the place by every  ship, rub their eyes and believe they must be dreaming, and that they  would presently wake up and find themselves back again in the old  country, at the old starvation rate of wages. Small capitalists, with  perhaps only one or two hundred pounds in the world, bid against each  other as purchasers of quarter-acre sections in the fast-springing  townships, or of fifty-acre lots of arable land in the projected  suburbs. Subscriptions were raised for building a Cathedral in  Christchurch; but so dear was both labour and material, that 7,000  pounds barely sufficed to lay its foundations.    The paramount anxiety in men's minds seemed to be to secure land.  Sheep-runs in sheltered accessible parts of the country commanded  enormous prices, and were bought in the most complicated way. The first  comers had taken up vast tracts of land in all directions from the  Government, at an almost nominal rental. This had happened quite in  the dark and remote ages of the history of the colony, at least ten  or twelve years before the date of which I write. As speculators with  plenty of hard cash came down from Australia, these original tenants  sold, as it were, the good-will and stock of their run at enormous  prices; but what always seemed to me so hard was, that after you had  paid any number of thousand pounds for your run, you might have to buy  it all, or at any rate, some portion of it, over again. Land could only  be purchased freehold from the Government, for 2 pounds an acre; and if  a \"cockatoo\" (i.e., a small farmer), or a speculator in mines, fancied  any part of your property, he had only to go to the land office, and  challenge your pre-emptive rights. The officials gave you notice of the  challenge, and six weeks' grace in which to raise the money, and buy it  freehold yourself; but few sheep-farmers could afford to pay a good  many hundred pounds unexpectedly to secure even their best \"flats\" or  vallies. Hence it often happened that large runs in the most favourable  situations were cut up by small investors, \"free selectors\" as they are  called in Australia, and it used to be rather absurd the way one grew  to distrust any stranger who was descried riding about the run. The poor  man might be looking for a stray horse, or have lost his way, but we  always fancied he must be \"prospecting\" for either gold or coals, or  else be a \"cockatoo\" disguised as a traveller.    Such was the state of things when my story opens. Shearing was just  over, and we knew to a lamb how rapidly our flocks and herds were  increasing. A succession of mild winters and early genial springs had  got the flock into capital order. The wool had all been sent off to  Christchurch by drays, the sheep were turned out on the beautiful green  hills for ten months of perfect rest and peace; whilst the dogs, who  had barked themselves quite hoarse, were enabled to desist from their  labours in mustering and watching the yet unshorn mobs on the vallies.  Although our run was as well grassed and watered as any in the province,  still it could not possibly carry more than a certain number of sheep,  and to that total our returns showed that we were rapidly approaching.  The most careful calculations warned us that by next shearing we should  hardly know what to do with our sheep. It is always better to be under  than overstocked, for the merino gets out of condition immediately, and  even the staple of the wool deteriorates if its wearer be at all crowded  on his feeding-grounds.    \"You must take up more country directly,\" was the invariable formula of  the advice we, comparatively \"new chums,\" received on all sides. This  was easier to say than to do. Turn which ever way we would, far back  beyond our own lovely vallies and green hills, back up to the bleak  region of glaciers, where miles of bush and hundreds of acres of steep  hill-side, formed the _back-est_ of \"back country,\" every inch of land  was taken up. No fear had those distant Squatters of \"cockatoos,\" or  even of miners; for no one came their way who could possibly help it.  Still we should have been comparatively glad to buy such a run fifty or  sixty miles further back,--at the foot, in fact of the great Southern  Alps,--just as a summer feeding-ground for the least valuable portion  of our flock. But no one was inclined to part with a single acre, and we  were forced to turn our eyes in a totally different direction.    If my readers will refer to the accompanying map of New Zealand, and  look at the Middle or South Island, they will notice a long seaboard  on the eastern side of the island, stretching SS.W. for many hundred  leagues. It extends beyond the Province of Canterbury to that of  Otago, and embraces some of the most magnificent pastoral land in the  settlement. Not only is the soil rich and productive, but the climate  is rather less windy than with us in the northern portion of the island;  and the capital of Otago (Dunedin) had risen into comparative position  and importance before Christchurch,--was in short an elder sister of  that pretty little town. Most of the settlers in Otago were Scotchmen,  and as there are no better colonists anywhere, its prosperity had  attained to a very flourishing height. Gold-digging had also broken out  at the foot of the Dunstan range, so that Otago held her head quite as  high, if not higher, than her neighbour Canterbury. Of course all the  first-class pasture-land \"down south,\" as it was called, had been taken  up long before; but we heard rumours of splendid sheep country, yet  unappropriated, far back towards the west coast of Otago, just where its  boundary joined Canterbury.    With our minds in this state of desire for what poor Mazzini used  to denounce as \"territorial aggrandisement,\" we paid our usual  post-shearing visit to Christchurch. F---- had his agent's accounts to  examine, a nice little surplus of wool-money to receive, and many other  squatting interests to attend to; whilst I had to lay in chests of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5994"],[0,"Our Nervous Friends — Illustrating the Mastery of Nervousness (#12)"],[1," their strength keeping her in bed  during the paroxysms of her suffering, which, hour by hour, seemed to  grow in intensity and to defy the ever-increasing doses of quieting  drugs. She had recognized no one for days. Even her mother's voice  brought back no moment of natural response. \"It must be meningitis,\"  Dr. Harkins finally said, and the other doctor nodded in agreement.  And Aunt Melissa informed the neighbors that it was \"meningitis\" and  that her darling Ruth could last but a few days. The mother's anxiety  reiterated \"meningitis,\" and good, levelheaded Martha King, the nurse,  knew that the three cases of meningitis which she had nursed had  suffered the same way before they died. When Judge Rivers came, he  spent but one minute in the sick-room. It was days before he dared  reenter. Ruth did not know him. For the first time in her twenty-seven  years, she had failed to respond happily to his hearty, rich-voiced  love-greeting. The Judge's small fortune had grown slowly. Only that  year had the mortgage been finally lifted on their comfortable Georgia  home. But in that minute at the sufferer's bedside all he had was  thrown into the scales. Ruth must be saved. She was the only daughter;  she was a worthily beloved daughter. \"No, she cannot be moved to Johns  Hopkins; the trip is too rough and long; she is too weak,\" decided Dr.  Harkins, and the consultant agreed. \"Our only hope for her is to get  the 'brain expert' from the next state.\" Five days had passed since  the patient had retained food. For twenty-four hours the tide of her  strength seemed only to ebb. They all counted the minutes. The summer-  boarders in the little town, so many of whom knew the sick girl,  counted the hours, for Ruth was much quieter--too quiet, they felt. An  hour before, Aunt Melissa had tiptoed in to see her darling; the  finger-tips seemed cold in her excited palm, the nails looked bluish  to her dreading eyes, and she retreated to the back porch-steps, threw  her apron over her head and sat weaving to and fro, inconsolate; nor  would she look up even when the big motor panted into sight out of a  cloud of dust, and stopped. \"It is too late, too late,\" moaned Aunt  Melissa. Dr. Harkins and Judge Rivers met the neurologist. The former  reviewed the case in a few sentences. The Judge simply said: \"Doctor,  my whole savings are nothing. I would give my life for hers.\"    In the sick-room tensity had given place to intensity, as with deft,  skillful directness the doctor made his examination. He had finished;  the light had again been dimmed, and in the added shadow the haggard  face seemed ashen. Motionless, thoughtful, interminably silent, the  expert stood, holding the sick girl's hand. The nurse first saw him  smile. It was a serious smile; it was a strangely hopeful smile--a  smile which was instantly reflected in her own face and which the  mother caught and Dr. Harkins saw. Each one of them was thrilled with  such thrills as become rare when the forties have passed, thrilled  even before they heard his words: \"It is not meningitis. Your daughter  can get well.\"    In the conference which followed, Dr. Harkins felt that his confidence  had been well placed. It is surprising how much the expert had  discovered in forty minutes,--and how carefully considered and  relentlessly logical were his reasons for deciding that it was an  \"auto-toxic meningismus, secondary to renal and pancreatic  insufficiency,\" which, translated, signifies a self-produced poison  due to defective action of the liver and pancreas, resulting in  circulatory disturbance in the covering of the brain. Most clearly,  too, he revealed that several of the most alarming symptoms were the  result of the added poison of the drugs which had been given for the  relief of the intolerable pain. Each step of the long road to recovery  was outlined with equal clearness, and the light of hope burst in  strong on Dr. Harkins first, then on Martha King. The crushing load  was lifted from off the Judge's heart. The promise seemed too good to  be true, to the mother, who had seen her daughter go down through the  years, step by step. It never penetrated the shadow of Aunt Melissa's  pessimism.    What forces had been at work to bring ten years of relentlessly  increasing suffering, even impending death, to Ruth Rivers at twenty-  seven, when she should have been in the glory of her young womanhood?  \"Her headaches have always been a mystery,\" her mother had said again  and again, and this saying had been accepted by family and friends.  Let us join hands with Understanding, step behind this mystery, and  find its solution.    Judge Rivers' father had been Judge Rivers, too. The war between the  States had absorbed the family wealth; still, our Judge Rivers showed  every evidence of good living: he was always well-dressed, as befitted  his office, portly and contented, as was also befitting, fine of color  and always well. His daughter's illness had been practically the only  problem in the affairs of his life which he had not solved to his  quite reasonable satisfaction. His love for Ruth held half of his  life's sweetness.    Mrs. Rivers was tall, active, almost muscular in type. Her brow, like  her daughter's, was high. The quality of her Virginia blood had marked  her face. She had always been unduly pale, but never ill. Controlled  and reasonable, she had ministered to her home with efficiency and  pride.    Aunt Melissa, her sister, five years the senior, was tall and strong,  but her paleness had long been unhealthily tinted with sallowness. For  years she had been subject to attacks of depression when for days she  would insist upon being let alone, even as she let others alone. Ruth  was the only bright spot she recognized in her life, and her  morbidness was constantly picturing disaster for this object of her  love.    Ruth's babyhood was a joy. Plump, cooing and happy, she evinced, even  in her earliest days, evidences of her rare disposition. At eighteen  months, however, she began having spells of indigestion. She always  sat in her high-chair beside Aunt Melissa, at the table, and rarely  failed to get at least a taste of anything served which her fancy  indicated. Her wise little stomach from time to time expressed its  disapproval of such unlawful liberties, but parents and aunts and  grandmothers, and probably most of us, are very dull in interpreting  the protests of stomachs. So Ruth got what she liked, and what was an  equal misfortune, she liked what she got; and no one ever associated  the liking and the getting with the poor sick stomach's periodic  protests. As a girl Ruth was not very active. There was a certain  reserve, even in her playing, quite in keeping with family traditions.  Mother, Aunt Melissa and the servants did the work--still Ruth  developed, happy, unselfish, kindly and sensitive. There was rigid  discipline accompanying certain rules of conduct, and her deportment  was carefully molded by the silent forces of family culture. They  lived at the county-seat. The public schools which Ruth attended were  fairly good. As she grew older, while she remained thin and never  approached ruggedness, her digestive \"spells\" were much less frequent,  and during the two years she spent away from home in the Convent, she  was quite well, and one year played center on the second basket ball  team. Two years away at school were all that the Judge could then  afford. And so at eighteen she was home for good. That fall she began  having headaches. She was reading much, so she went to Mobile and was  carefully fitted with glasses. The correction was not a strong one,  but the oculist felt it would relieve the \"abnormal sensitiveness of  her eyes, which is probably causing her trouble.\"    Throughout her years of suffering, Ruth had always maintained the rare  restraint which marks fineness of soul. No one ever heard her  complain. Even her mother could not be sure that another attack was  on, until she found Ruth alone in her darkened room. Acquaintances,  even friends, never heard her mention her illness.    The midsummer months in Southern Alabama drive such as are able to the  relief of the mountains of Tennessee and the Carolinas. The Judge had  always felt that he should send his family away during July and  August; they often went in June when the summers were early. And these  weeks of change proved, year after year, the most helpful influences  that came to Ruth. She always improved and would usually remain  stronger until after Thanksgiving. But with irregular periodicity the  blinding, prostrating headaches would return--a week of pain, nausea  and prostration. Yet Ruth never asked for, nor took medicine, unless  it was ordered by the doctor, and then more in consideration of the  desires of her family, for the unnatural sensations, produced by most  of the remedies she was given, seemed but the substitution of one  discomfort for another. The only exercise that counted, which this  girl ever had, was during her weeks at Point View. The stimulation of  the invigorating mountain air seemed to get into her blood, and after  a few weeks with her friendly mountains she could climb the highest  with little apparent fatigue. At home, the country was flat, the roads  sandy, and even horseback riding uninteresting. She had never been  taught any strengthening form of daily home-exercise, and so she  suffered on. While the glasses brought comfort, they lessened, for but  a short time, the number and the intensity of her attacks. Several  physicians were consulted and several varying courses of treatment  undertaken, but no betterment came which lasted, and the headaches  remained a mystery, not only to her mother, but to others who  seriously tried to help. As we are behind the scenes, we need no  longer delay the mystery's solution. It was not eyes, they were  accurately corrected; it was not stomach, as much stomach treatment  proved; "]]]
