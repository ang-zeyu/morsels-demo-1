I  merely suggested him in particular, on account of his good name and  fame among author-folk, besides he has himself written--as the Americans  say--'more poetry 'an you can shake a stick at.' So I hope we shall come  to terms.    I also hope my poem will turn out not utterly unworthy your kind  interest, and more deserving your favour than anything of mine you have  as yet seen; indeed I all along proposed to myself such an endeavour,  for it will never do for one so distinguished by past praise to prove  nobody after all--'nous verrons'. I am, dear sir, Yours most truly and  obliged Robt. Browning.      On April 16 he wrote again as follows:      Dear Sir,    Your communication gladdened the cockles of my heart. I lost no time  in presenting myself to Moxon, but no sooner was Mr. Clarke's letter  perused than the Moxonian visage loured exceedingly thereat--the  Moxonian accent grew dolorous thereupon:--'Artevelde' has not paid  expenses by about thirty odd pounds. Tennyson's poetry is 'popular at  Cambridge', and yet of 800 copies which were printed of his last,  some 300 only have gone off: Mr. M. hardly knows whether he shall ever  venture again, &c. &c., and in short begs to decline even inspecting,  &c. &c.    I called on Saunders and Otley at once, and, marvel of marvels, do  really think there is some chance of our coming to decent terms--I shall  know at the beginning of next week, but am not over-sanguine.    You will 'sarve me out'? two words to that; being the man you are, you  must need very little telling from me, of the real feeling I have of  your criticism's worth, and if I have had no more of it, surely I  am hardly to blame, who have in more than one instance bored you  sufficiently: but not a particle of your article has been rejected or  neglected by your observant humble servant, and very proud shall I be  if my new work bear in it the marks of the influence under which it was  undertaken--and if I prove not a fit compeer of the potter in Horace  who anticipated an amphora and produced a porridge-pot. I purposely  keep back the subject until you see my conception of its  capabilities--otherwise you would be planning a vase fit to give the  go-by to Evander's best crockery, which my cantharus would cut but a  sorry figure beside--hardly up to the ansa.    But such as it is, it is very earnest and suggestive--and likely I hope  to do good; and though I am rather scared at the thought of a _fresh eye_  going over its 4,000 lines--discovering blemishes of all sorts which  my one wit cannot avail to detect, fools treated as sages, obscure  passages, slipshod verses, and much that worse is,--yet on the whole  I am not much afraid of the issue, and I would give something to be  allowed to read it some morning to you--for every rap o' the knuckles I  should get a clap o' the back, I know.    I have another affair on hand, rather of a more popular nature, I  conceive, but not so decisive and explicit on a point or two--so I  decide on trying the question with this:--I really shall _need_ your  notice, on this account; I shall affix my name and stick my arms akimbo;  there are a few precious bold bits here and there, and the drift and  scope are awfully radical--I am 'off' for ever with the other side, but  must by all means be 'on' with yours--a position once gained, worthier  works shall follow--therefore a certain writer* who meditated a notice  (it matters not laudatory or otherwise) on 'Pauline' in the 'Examiner',  must be benignant or supercilious as he shall choose, but in no case an  idle spectator of my first appearance on any stage (having previously  only dabbled in private theatricals) and bawl 'Hats off!' 'Down in  front!' &c., as soon as I get to the proscenium; and he may depend that  tho' my 'Now is the winter of our discontent' be rather awkward, yet  there shall be occasional outbreaks of good stuff--that I shall warm as  I get on, and finally wish 'Richmond at the bottom of the seas,' &c. in  the best style imaginable.         * Mr. John Stuart Mill.    Excuse all this swagger, I know you will, and    (The signature has been cut off; evidently for an autograph.)    Mr. Effingham Wilson was induced to publish the poem, but more, we  understand, on the ground of radical sympathies in Mr. Fox and the  author than on that of its intrinsic worth.    The title-page of 'Paracelsus' introduces us to one of the warmest  friendships of Mr. Browning's life. Count de Ripert-Monclar was a young  French Royalist, one of those who had accompanied the Duchesse de Berri  on her Chouan expedition, and was then, for a few years, spending his  summers in England; ostensibly for his pleasure, really--as he  confessed to the Browning family--in the character of private agent of  communication between the royal exiles and their friends in France. He  was four years older than the poet, and of intellectual tastes which  created an immediate bond of union between them. In the course of one of  their conversations, he suggested the life of Paracelsus as a possible  subject for a poem; but on second thoughts pronounced it unsuitable,  because it gave no room for the introduction of love: about which, he  added, every young man of their age thought he had something quite new  to say. Mr. Browning decided, after the necessary study, that he would  write a poem on Paracelsus, but treating him in his own way. It was  dedicated, in fulfilment of a promise, to the friend to whom its  inspiration had been due.    The Count's visits to England entirely ceased, and the two friends  did not meet for twenty years. Then, one day, in a street in Rome, Mr.  Browning heard a voice behind him crying, 'Robert!' He turned, and  there was 'Amedee'. Both were, by that time, married; the Count--then, I  believe, Marquis--to an English lady, Miss Jerningham. Mrs. Browning, to  whom of course he was introduced, liked him very much.*         * A minor result of the intimacy was that Mr. Browning       became member, in 1835, of the Institut Historique, and in       1836 of the Societe Francaise de Statistique Universelle, to       both of which learned bodies his friend belonged.    Mr. Browning did treat Paracelsus in his own way; and in so doing  produced a character--at all events a history--which, according  to recent judgments, approached far nearer to the reality than any  conception which had until then been formed of it. He had carefully  collected all the known facts of the great discoverer's life, and  interpreted them with a sympathy which was no less an intuition of their  truth than a reflection of his own genius upon them. We are enabled  in some measure to judge of this by a paper entitled 'Paracelsus, the  Reformer of Medicine', written by Dr. Edward Berdoe for the Browning  Society, and read at its October meeting in 1888; and in the difficulty  which exists for most of us of verifying the historical data of  Mr. Browning's poem, it becomes a valuable guide to, as well as an  interesting comment upon it.    Dr. Berdoe reminds us that we cannot understand the real Paracelsus  without reference to the occult sciences so largely cultivated in his  day, as also to the mental atmosphere which produced them; and he quotes  in illustration a passage from the writings of that Bishop of Spanheim  who was the instructor of Paracelsus, and who appears as such in the  poem. The passage is a definition of divine magic, which is apparently  another term for alchemy; and lays down the great doctrine of all  mediaeval occultism, as of all modern theosophy--of a soul-power equally  operative in the material and the immaterial, in nature and in the  consciousness of man.    The same clue will guide us, as no other can, through what is apparently  conflicting in the aims and methods, anomalous in the moral experience,  of the Paracelsus of the poem. His feverish pursuit, among the things of  Nature, of an ultimate of knowledge, not contained, even in fragments,  in her isolated truths; the sense of failure which haunts his most  valuable attainments; his tampering with the lower or diabolic magic,  when the divine has failed; the ascetic exaltation in which he begins  his career; the sudden awakening to the spiritual sterility which has  been consequent on it; all these find their place, if not always their  counterpart, in the real life.    The language of Mr. Browning's Paracelsus, his attitude towards himself  and the world, are not, however, quite consonant with the alleged facts.  They are more appropriate to an ardent explorer of the world of abstract  thought than to a mystical scientist pursuing the secret of existence.  He preserves, in all his mental vicissitudes, a loftiness of tone and a  unity of intention, difficult to connect, even in fancy, with the real  man, in whom the inherited superstitions and the prognostics of true  science must often have clashed with each other. Dr. Berdoe's picture  of the 'Reformer' drawn more directly from history, conveys this double  impression. Mr. Browning has rendered him more simple by, as it were,  recasting him in the atmosphere of a more modern time, and of his own  intellectual life. This poem still, therefore, belongs to the same group  as 'Pauline', though, as an effort of dramatic creation, superior to it.    We find the Poet with still less of dramatic disguise in the deathbed  revelation which forms so beautiful a close to the story. It supplies a  fitter comment to the errors of the dramatic Paracelsus, than to those  of the historical, whether or not its utterance was within the compass  of historical probability, as Dr. Berdoe believes. In any case it was  the direct product of Mr. Browning's mind, and expressed what was to  be his permanent conviction. It might then have been an echo of German  pantheistic philosophies. From the point of view of science--of modern  science at least--it was prophetic; although the prophecy of one for  whom evolution "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6574"],[0,"Watchers of the Sky (#12)"],[1,"cord had touched him.  Out of the Inquisition's five degrees  Of rigor: first, the public threat of torture;  Second, the repetition of the threat  Within the torture-chamber, where we show  The instruments of torture to the accused;  Third, the undressing and the binding; fourth,  Laying him on the rack; then, fifth and last,  Torture, _territio realis_; out of these,  Your Galileo reached the second only,  When, clapping both his hands against his sides,  He whined about a rupture that forbade  These extreme courses. Great heroic soul  Dropped like a cur into a sea of terror,  He sank right under. Then he came up gasping,  Ready to swear, deny, abjure, recant,  Anything, everything! Foolish, weak, old man,  Who had been so proud of his discoveries,  And dared to teach his betters. How we grinned  To see him kneeling there and whispering, thus,  Through his white lips, bending his old grey head:  _\"I, Galileo Galilei, born  A Florentine, now seventy years of age,  Kneeling before you, having before mine eyes,  And touching with my hands the Holy Gospels,  Swear that I always have believed, do now,  And always will believe what Holy Church  Has held and preached and taught me to believe;  And now, whereas I rightly am accused,  Of heresy, having falsely held the sun  To be the centre of our Universe,  And also that this earth is not the centre,  But moves;  I most illogically desire  Completely to expunge this dark suspicion,  So reasonably conceived. I now abjure,  Detest and curse these errors; and I swear  That should I know another, friend or foe,  Holding the selfsame heresy as myself,  I will denounce him to the Inquisitor  In whatsoever place I chance to be.  So help me God, and these His Holy Gospels,  Which with my hands I touch!\"_                                    You will observe  His promise to denounce. Beware, Castelli!  What think you of your Galileo now?          III      _(Castelli writes, enclosing Schemer's letter, to Campanella.)_    What think I? This,--that he has laid his hands  Like Samson on the pillars of our world,  And one more trembling utterance such as this  Will overwhelm us all.                         O, Campanella,  You know that I am loyal to our faith,  As Galileo too has always been.  You know that I believe, as he believes,  In the one Catholic Apostolic Church;  Yet there are many times when I could wish  That some blind Samson would indeed tear down  All this proud temporal fabric, made with hands,  And that, once more, we suffered with our Lord,  Were persecuted, crucified with Him.  I tell you, Campanella, on that day  When Galileo faced our Cardinals,  A veil was rent for me. There, in one flash,  I saw the eternal tragedy, transformed  Into new terms. I saw the Christ once more,  Before the court of Pilate. Peter there  Denied Him once again; and, as for me,  Never has all my soul so humbly knelt  To God in Christ, as when that sad old man  Bowed his grey head, and knelt--at seventy years--  To acquiesce, and shake the world with shame.  _He shall not strive or cry_! Strange, is it not,  How nearly Scheiner--even amidst his hate--  Quoted the Prophets? Do we think this world  So greatly bettered, that the ancient cry,  \"_Despised, rejected_,\" hails our God no more?          IV      (_Celeste writes to her father in his imprisonment at Siena_.)    Dear father, it will seem a thousand years  Until I see you home again and well.  I would not have you doubt that all this time  I have prayed for you continually. I saw  A copy of your sentence. I was grieved;  And yet it gladdened me, for I found a way  To be of use, by taking on myself  Your penance. Therefore, if you fail in this,  If you forget it--and indeed, to save you  The trouble of remembering it--your child  Will do it for you.                      Ah, could she do more!  How willingly would your Celeste endure  A straiter prison than she lives in now  To set you free.                   \"A prison,\" I have said;  And yet, if you were here, 'twould not be so.  When you were pent in Rome, I used to say,  \"Would he were at Siena!\" God fulfilled  That wish. You are at Siena; and I now say  Would he were at Arcctri.                            So perhaps  Little by little, angels can be wooed  Each day, by some new prayer of mine or yours,  To bring you wholly back to me, and save  Some few of the flying days that yet remain.  You see, these other Nuns have each their friend,  Their patron Saint, their ever near _devoto_,  To whom they tell their joys and griefs; but I  Have only you, dear father, and if you  Were only near me, I could want no more.  Your garden looks as if it missed your love.  The unpruned branches lean against the wall  To look for you. The walks run wild with flowers.  Even your watch-tower seems to wait for you;  And, though the fruit is not so good this year  (The vines were hurt by hail, I think, and thieves  Have climbed the wall too often for the pears),  The crop of peas is good, and only waits  Your hand to gather it.                          In the dovecote, too,  You'll find some plump young pigeons. We must make  A feast for your return.                           In my small plot,  Here at the Convent, better watched than yours,  I raised a little harvest. With the price  I got for it, I had three Masses said  For my dear father's sake.          V      _(Galileo writes to his friend Castelli, after his return to  Arcetri.) _    Castelli, O Castelli, she is dead.  I found her driving death back with her soul  Till I should come.                      I could not even see  Her face.--These useless eyes had spent their power  On distant worlds, and lost that last faint look  Of love on earth.                    I am in the dark, Castelli,  Utterly and irreparably blind.  The Universe which once these outworn eyes  Enlarged so far beyond its ancient bounds  Is henceforth shrunk into that narrow space  Which I myself inhabit.                          Yet I found  Even in the dark, her tears against my face,  Her thin soft childish arms around my neck,  And her voice whispering ... love, undying love;  Asking me, at this last, to tell her true,  If we should meet again.                           Her trust in me  Had shaken her faith in what my judges held;  And, as I felt her fingers clutch my hand,  Like a child drowning, \"Tell me the truth,\" she said,  \"Before I lose the light of your dear face\"--  It seemed so strange that dying she could see me  While I had lost her,--\"tell me, before I go.\"  \"Believe in Love,\" was all my soul could breathe.  I heard no answer. Only I felt her hand  Clasp mine and hold it tighter. Then she died,  And left me to my darkness. Could I guess  At unseen glories, in this deeper night,  Make new discoveries of profounder realms,  Within the soul? O, could I find Him there,  Rise to Him through His harmonies of law  And make His will my own!                            This much, at least,  I know already, that--in some strange way--  His law implies His love; for, failing that  All grows discordant, and the primal Power  Ignobler than His children.                              So I trust  One day to find her, waiting for me still,  When all things are made new.                                I raise this torch  Of knowledge. It is one with my right hand,  And the dark sap that keeps it burning flows  Out of my heart; and yet, for all my faith,  It shows me only darkness.                             Was I wrong?  Did I forget the subtler truth of Rome  And, in my pride, obscure the world's one light?  Did I subordinate to this moving earth  Our swiftlier-moving God?                            O, my Celeste,  Once, once at least, you knew far more than I;  And she is dead, Castelli, she is dead.          VI      (_Viviani, many years later, writes to a friend in England_)    I was his last disciple, as you say  I went to him, at seventeen years of age,  And offered him my hands and eyes to use,  When, voicing the true mind and heart of Rome,  Father Castelli, his most faithful friend,  Wrote, for my master, that compassionate plea;  _The noblest eye that Nature ever made  Is darkened; one so exquisitely dowered,  So delicate in power that it beheld  More than all other eyes in ages gone  And opened the eyes of all that are to come._  But, out of England, even then, there shone  The first ethereal promise of light  That crowns my master dead. Well I recall  That day of days. There was no faintest breath  Among his garden cypress-trees. They dreamed  Dark, on a sky too beautiful for tears,  And the first star was trembling overhead,  When, quietly as a messenger from heaven,  Moving unseen, through his own purer realm,  Amongst the shadows of our mortal world,  A young man, with a strange light on his face  Knocked at the door of Galileo's house.  His name was Milton.                       By the hand of God,  He, the one living soul on earth with power  To read the starry soul of this blind man,  Was led through Italy to his prison door.  He looked on Galileo, touched his hand ...  _O, dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,  Irrecoverably dark .... _                               In after days,  He wrote it; but it pulsed within him then;  And Galileo rising to his feet  And turning on him those unseeing eyes  That had searched heaven and seen so many worlds,  Said to him, \"You have found me.\"  Often he told me in those last sad months  Of how your grave young island poet brought  Peace to him, with the knowledge that, far off,  In other lands, the truth he had proclaimed  Was gathering power.                       Soon after, death unlocked  His prison, and the city that he loved,  Florence, his town of flowers, whose gates in life  He was forbid to pass, received him dead.    You write to me from England, that his name  Is now among the mightiest in the world,  And in his name I thank you.                               I am old;  And I was very young when,"]]]
