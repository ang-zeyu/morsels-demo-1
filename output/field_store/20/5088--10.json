Pappina would not admit, even to herself, that she was afraid of  Guiseppe in his drunken, quarrelsome condition, but Marta noticed that  the little hand in hers trembled and held her own more tightly whenever  Guiseppe turned toward them.    Worn and tired from the long tramp, Pappina inquired of Marta: \"Where  is he going? I can't walk much farther. I feel weak, Marta.\"    \"_Poverina_ [poor little one], I do not know, but we are together and  you are safe with me,\" Marta replied as they followed Guiseppe through  the merry crowd that was enjoying the pleasures of the walk and the  beauties of the moonlit bay.    When he reached the theater, he stopped and put down the Punchinellos.  Assuming a bravado air, he ordered Pappina to sing.    \"You remember what I said?\" he asked. \"You shall sing all night if I  will it so. Marta knows me. She can tell you that I say what I mean and  mean what I say. It is not the Punchinellos to-night, it is you.\" He  shook his fist in Pappina's face.    Rebellious, tired, and hungry, she quickly lifted her clenched fist to  strike again, but Marta enfolded the little doubled-up hand in hers.    \"It is best to obey to-night,\" she whispered. \"Sing for me, my bird,  for I love you.\"    Marta's loving words appealed to Pappina as nothing else would have  done. She rose quickly and sang the best she could. The poor little  girl put no animation in the vivacious song she tried to sing; it might  have passed for a funeral dirge.    After the long tramp it was hard for the child to stand and sing; to  dance was impossible. There was a plaintiveness in her voice and in her  manner. She was but a baby, forced beyond her strength; made to sing  for her food.    Her face looked drawn and white, even her lips were colorless. At times  her voice could scarcely be heard. When she staggered in her efforts to  dance, as she did many times, she looked helplessly and appealingly at  Marta.    Guiseppe's eyes were on the crowd only. He noticed their interest  in the singer, and nothing more. When Pappina finished the song, he  shouted: \"Give! Give! Here, little one, pass your tambourine.\"    Marta knew and the people knew. The tambourine was passed.    \"Fill, so the brute will take her home.\" Only Marta of our three  wanderers understood these words, spoken in English.    Guiseppe quickly took possession of the money. \"I am thirsty. Wine,  wine!\" he exclaimed, \"I must have wine. Who wouldn't drink, with her--\"  He pointed to Pappina and left the sentence unfinished. \"Wait for me  here, and don't move or I'll kill you both.\"    He was out of sight in a moment, disappearing into a wine shop. They  heard his boisterous laugh within. Marta took Pappina's hand in hers.    \"_Carissima_,\" she said, \"you are so hungry and so tired! Guiseppe is  not himself. He forgets.\"    A new light shone in Pappina's eyes. She was given new strength. This  time she would sing, not from fear of Guiseppe, perhaps not from love  of Marta. She was just a worn-out, tired little child whose tender age  should have ensured her protection at home--only seven years old, but  forced to battle with the world, seeking refuge through her songs from  storms and hunger, a weatherbeaten bird. For her there was now no place  called home, no place to lay her tired little head. She knew that to  sing and dance meant money, and that she and Marta were hungry and in  need of money for supper. She took her tambourine from Marta, threw it  high in the air, caught it, and began to dance.    The gaping crowd that had watched her efforts before stood almost  aghast as she swayed and tipped and toed, till one would have thought  her little feet would refuse to take another step. Then, pausing a  moment to take breath, she started to sing the rollicking song Guiseppe  had just taught her--with gestures and grimaces, stopping to speak,  dashing into song, now laughing so infectiously that every bystander  joined with her.    She finished the song in an uproar of laughter, applause, and shouts of  \"Bravo, bravo!\"    The enthusiastic listeners fairly threw _soldi_ at her. Pappina wanted  them for supper for Marta and herself. They had tramped all day with  but a bite of bread in the early morning. Pappina's haggard little face  glowed with pleasure as she took the well-filled tambourine to Marta.    \"See, Marta, yours to-night--not Guiseppe's--yours!\"    \"No, not mine; it is yours alone, _carissima_.\"    \"Then it is yours and mine. Come, let's go. Macaroni, Marta! Hurry,  dear Marta.\"    \"Pappina, _mia carissima_, Pappina!\" Marta walked a few steps then  stopped. \"Should Guiseppe return and find us gone!\" Even as she spoke  she did not feel her usual fear.    \"But I am starved, Marta. I must eat, unless, dear, good Marta, you who  love me say I mustn't.\"    Marta hesitated for a moment, looking down the street to see if her  husband was returning. He was nowhere in sight. Her love for Pappina  conquered her fear of Guiseppe's displeasure.    \"Wait for me here,\" she said. \"I will go and bring us food.\"    With all haste it was purchased and eaten. It was long after they had  finished their simple meal that Guiseppe returned from his revelry.    His mood was changed. He had drank so much wine he could scarcely stand  up. He loved the little girl who had filled his purse. He laid his hand  caressingly on her head. She shuddered at his touch, and clung close to  Marta, who looked fearlessly into Guiseppe's face and said sternly:    \"I am used to your thoughtlessness, used even to cruelty; but Pappina  is worn out, and she must have her rest.\"    \"Eh! What's that you say? She's tired? Macaroni and a bottle of wine  will build her up. Come on, sweet one.\" Stretching out his hand to  Pappina, he continued: \"Throughout the town those who have seen you  and heard you to-night sing your praises. They believe you are mine.  _Ebbene!_ So you are, sweet one--so you are.\"    \"Guiseppe,\" and Pappina looked pleadingly into his half-closed eyes,  \"Guiseppe, if you love me so much, take me where we shall sleep  to-night. I'm not hungry, Guiseppe, but I'm so tired. I want to go to  sleep.\"    Worn out, Pappina began to cry. Marta quickly gathered the child into  her arms and carried her to a place Guiseppe selected as suitable to  spend the night.           *       *       *       *       *    Sabbath morning! So beautiful it dawned that it seemed to be wooing  man, woman and child to worship the God who could give to his children  so perfect a day. Flowers, grass, birds and sky, with the bright Bay of  Salerno in the glint of the morning sun, all attested to the wonders of  a marvelous world with its perfection in every phase of nature as it  appeared this Sunday in Salerno.    Guiseppe slept in a drunken stupor. Marta was afraid to speak, even  in a whisper, for fear of disturbing his slumber. Pappina, harboring  a feeling of hatred stronger than ever, grew tired of waiting for  Guiseppe to awaken.    \"Marta,\" she said softly.    \"Sh!\" Marta raised her finger to silence Pappina, who for a time sat  quiet. Then the stillness began to irritate her.    \"Marta,\" she began again and once more Marta tried to silence her, but  this time in vain. \"I won't 'sh,' for it must be time to go to church,  and surely he,\" (pointing to Guiseppe), \"ought to pray.\"    Guiseppe, hearing her voice, sat up and looked about him in a dazed way  out of his bleary eyes. Pappina, seeing him thus, needed courage to  speak at all, but with her characteristic fearlessness she said:    \"Come, Guiseppe, it's Sunday. We must go to church.\"    \"Sunday! Let me sleep. Sunday, did you say? There's nothing to do on  Sunday except pray. I'll sleep. If you two simpletons want to pray, go  on to church and let me alone. Get along, I'll wait.\" He fell over on  the ground and was soon snoring loudly.    Hand in hand Marta and Pappina walked away.    \"I dared not ask Guiseppe for money. You saw, _carina_, he is not yet  himself.\"    Pappina's face was wreathed in smiles as she stooped down to bring up  _soldi_ she had hidden in her shoe the night before. It was not the  cleanest hand in the world that handed the money to Marta, but the  little grime on it did not prevent Marta from seizing it and covering  it with kisses.    \"I am so glad, so glad, _carina_!\" she exclaimed. \"Now you need not go  hungry to church.\"    After a hasty breakfast they were soon in the celebrated St. Matthew's  Cathedral. Marta, fearful of Guiseppe's displeasure if he were to  awaken and be kept waiting too long, wished to say a short prayer and  return at once, but Pappina was anxious to follow the people and see  the things that interested them. She suddenly seized Marta by the arm  and almost dragged her out of the church. There was a look of terror on  the child's face.    \"_Carina_, what is it?\"    \"Those ladies--you saw them, Marta! The man with them--you said he was  a guide--didn't you hear what he was telling them?\" She covered her  face with her hands. \"Oh, I cannot bear to think of it!\"    \"No, I did not hear. Tell me, what did he say that frightened you?  Perhaps you didn't understand.\"    \"Oh. I did. I heard every word. He told them that three saints' heads  had been cut off right by that column where we were standing. It scared  me so that now I am afraid to go back, and I wanted so much to go to  the tomb of the Pope. The guide said one is buried in the church. You  have seen so much, Marta--have you ever seen a Pope's tomb?\"    \"No, _carina_, but we must go back now, at once, to Guiseppe.\"    \"Back to Guiseppe,\" Pappina repeated slowly, \"back to Guiseppe.\" She  grew thoughtful. \"Marta, must we go back to Guiseppe? May we not run a  way?\"    \"Oh, my sweet baby, we must--we must go back to Guiseppe!\"    They met him walking to meet them. He smiled kindly as they approached  him. He even held out his hand to Pappina, but she paid no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45573"],[0,"Out with Garibaldi: A story of the liberation of Italy (#12)"],[1,"\"That will be a splendid gift, mother. I suppose I shall not go back to  school before I start?\"    \"No, Frank. Since you are to go on this expedition, the sooner you start  the better. I shall write to your headmaster, and tell him that I am  most reluctantly obliged to take you away from school for a few months;  but that it is a matter of the greatest importance, and that I hope he  will retain your name on the books and permit you to return when you  come back to England.\"    \"If he won't, mother, it will not matter very much. Of course I should  like to go back again; but if they won't let me, I shall only have to go  to a coach for a year or two.\"    \"That is of little consequence,\" his mother agreed; \"and perhaps, after  going through such an exciting time, you will not yourself care about  returning to school again. You must not look upon this matter as a mere  adventure, Frank; it is a very, very perilous enterprise, in which your  life will be risked daily. Were we differently situated, I should not  have dreamt of allowing you to go out; but we have identified ourselves  with the cause of freedom in Italy. Your grandfather lost  everything--his home, his country, and maybe his life; and your father,  living as he did in Rome, and married to the daughter of an Italian,  felt as burning a hatred for the oppression he saw everywhere round him  as did the Italians themselves; perhaps more so, for being accustomed to  the freedom Englishmen enjoy, these things appeared to him a good deal  more monstrous than they did to those who had been used to them all  their lives. He risked death a score of times in the defence of Rome;  and he finally lost his life while endeavouring to discover whether my  father was a prisoner in one of the tyrants' dungeons. Thus, although in  all other respects an English boy--or Italian only through your  grandfather--you have been constantly hearing of Italy and its wrongs,  and on that point feel as keenly and strongly as the son of an Italian  patriot would do. I consider that it is a holy war in which you are  about to take part--a war that, if successful, will open the doors of  dungeons in which thousands, among whom may be my father, are lingering  out their lives for no other cause than that they dared to think, and  will free a noble people who have for centuries been under the yoke of  foreigners. Therefore, as, if this country were in danger, I should not  baulk your desire to enter the army, so now I say to you, join  Garibaldi; and even should you be taken from me, I shall at least have  the consolation of feeling that it was in a noble cause you fell, and  that I sent you, knowing that my happiness as well as your life hung  upon the issue. I want you to view the matter then, my boy, not in the  light of an exciting adventure, but in the spirit in which the Crusaders  went out to free the Holy Sepulchre, in which the Huguenots of France  fought and died for their religion.\"    \"I will try to do so, mother,\" Frank said gravely; \"at any rate, if the  cause was good enough for my father and grandfather to risk their lives  for, it is good enough for me. But you know, mother,\" he went on, in a  changed voice, \"you can't put an old head on to young shoulders; and  though I shall try to regard it as you say, I am afraid that I shan't be  able to help enjoying it as a splendid adventure.\"    His mother smiled faintly. \"I suppose that is boy nature. At any rate,  I am sure that you will do your duty, and there is certainly no occasion  for your doing it with a sad face; and bear in mind always, Frank, that  you are going out not so much to fight, as to search every prison and  fortress that may be captured, to question every prisoner whether he has  heard or known any one answering the description of your grandfather,  or--or----\" and her lip quivered, and her voice broke.    \"Or, mother?\"--and he stood surprised as Mrs. Percival burst suddenly  into tears, and the signora, rising from her seat, went hastily to her,  and put her arm round her neck. It was a minute or two before Mrs.  Percival took her hands from her face, and went on,--    \"I was going to say, Frank, or of your father.\"    Frank started, as if he had been suddenly struck. \"My father,\" he  repeated, in a low tone. \"Do you think, mother--do you think it  possible? I thought there was no doubt as to how he was killed.\"    \"I have never let myself doubt,\" Mrs. Percival went on. \"Whenever the  thought has come into my mind during the past two years I have  resolutely put it aside. It would have been an agony more than I could  bear to think it possible that he could be alive and lingering in a  dungeon beyond human aid. Never have I spoken on the subject, except to  my mother, when she first suggested the possibility; but now that there  is a chance of the prison doors being opened, I may let myself not  hope--it can hardly be that--but pray that in God's mercy I may yet see  him again.\" And as she again broke down altogether, Frank, with a sudden  cry, threw himself on his knees beside her, and buried his face in his  arms on her lap, his whole figure shaken by deep sobs.    Mrs. Percival was the first to recover her composure, and gently  stroked his hair, saying: \"You must not permit yourself to hope, my boy;  you must shut that out from your mind as I have done, thinking of it  only as a vague, a very vague and distant possibility.\"    \"But how, mother, could it be?\" he asked presently, raising his head.  \"Did we not hear all about his being killed, how Beppo saw him shot, and  how one of the band testified that he was dead and buried?\"    \"So it seemed to me, Frank, when my mother first pointed out to me that  all this might be false, and that just as the government of Naples  declared they were absolutely ignorant as to your grandfather's  disappearance when it appeared to us a certainty that it was due to  their own act, so they would not hesitate a moment to get rid of your  father, whose letters as to the state of their prisons were exciting an  intense feeling against them in every free country. She said it would be  easy for them to bribe or threaten his servant into telling any tale  they thought fit; he or some other agent might have informed the  banditti that a rich Englishman would be passing along the road at a  certain time, and that the government would be ready to pay for his  capture and delivery to them. The prisoner taken may have been promised  a large sum to repeat the story of the Englishman having died and been  buried. It was all possible, and though I was determined not to think of  him as a prisoner, my mother, who knew more of these things than I did,  and how matters like this were managed in Italy, thought that it was so.  Still to my mind there were, and still are, reasons against hope, for  surely the Neapolitan government would have preferred that the brigands  should kill him, rather than that they themselves should have the  trouble of keeping him in prison.\"    \"Possibly they would have preferred that,\" Signora Forli said, speaking  for the first time. \"They knew that he was an Englishman, and doubtless  learned that he carried loaded pistols, and may have reckoned  confidently upon his resisting and being killed, and may have been  disappointed because the brigands, hoping for a large ransom, carried  him off wounded.\"    \"But even then,\" Mrs. Percival said, \"they could have sent up their  agents to the brigands and paid them to finish their work.\"    \"Yes, possibly that is what they did do; but though I have never spoken  to you on the subject since you told me not to, I have thought it over  many and many times, and it seems to me that they would scarcely do so,  for they might thus put themselves into the power of these bandits. Any  one of the band might make his way to Naples, go to the British  legation, and under the promise of a large sum of money and protection  denounce the whole plot. It seems to me more likely that they would send  an agent to the chief brigand, and pay him a sum of money to deliver the  captive up to men who would meet him at a certain place. It is probable  that the chief would, on some excuse or other, get rid of all his band  but two or three, hand over the prisoner, and share the money only with  those with him, and when the others returned, tell them that the  prisoner had died and that they had buried him. Then the carabinieri  would use every effort to kill those who were in the secret, and being  in earnest for once, they probably did kill the chief and those with  him.    \"Probably the man who gave his evidence was not one of the party at all,  but some prisoner charged with a minor offence, who was promised his  liberty as the price of telling the story that he was taught. If  Leonard had been killed and buried, as they stated, his grave must  surely have been found--the earth must still have been fresh; and,  indeed, nothing is more unlikely than that the brigands should have  taken any extraordinary trouble to hide the body, as they could not have  anticipated that any vigorous search would be made for it. For these  reasons I have all along believed that Leonard did not come to his end  as was supposed. He may have been killed afterwards by those into whose  hands he was delivered; but even this does not seem likely, for one of  them might betray the secret for a large reward. He may have died in a  dungeon, as so many thousands have done; but I believe firmly that he  did not, as reported, die in the brigands' hut. I have never since  spoken on the subject to your mother, Frank, for I agreed with what she  said, that it would be better to think of him as dead than in a dungeon,  from which, as was shown in the case of your grandfather, there was no  chance of releasing him. Now, however, if Garibaldi is successful, as  every prison will be searched, and every political prisoner freed, there  is a prospect that, if he is"]]]
