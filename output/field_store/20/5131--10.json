Hence  baptism is termed \"the washing of regeneration.\" Regeneration means new  birth.    Two fold Nature of Baptism.--Baptism, as already explained, is  twofold, corresponding to the soul of man. The body or fleshly part is  represented by the water, and the spirit by the Holy Ghost. The water  and the spirit are both essential in baptism, because, as previously  stated, it is not the body alone, nor the spirit alone, that is  baptized, but the soul, body and spirit in one.    The body, I say, is represented by the water. Science tells us that  most of the human body is water. Hamlet's plaintive wish that his \"too,  too, solid flesh would melt--thaw and resolve itself into a dew,\" was  not so very extravagant, therefore, from a scientific viewpoint.    Spirit baptism illumines the soul, making manifest the things of God.  \"Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart  of man, the great things which God hath prepared for them that love  him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit; for the Spirit  searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God\" (1 Cor. 2:9,10).  Thus Paul explains the office of the Holy Ghost, in one of its most  important functions. The Savior had reference to the same subject when  he promised to his disciples \"the Spirit of Truth,\" to reveal things  past, explain the present, and show things to come. The importance of  this mighty Agent, and the part played by it in baptism, was plainly  pointed out by Jesus, when he said: \"Except a man be born again, he can  not see the kingdom of God.\"    The Atoning Blood of Christ.--But there are three factors, not merely  two, in the process of the soul's regeneration--the spirit, the water,  and the blood. By these three man is born into the world, and by these  three he is \"born again\" into the kingdom of God. Ordinarily but two  of them are mentioned in connection with baptism, for only two are  actually used in baptism; but without the third, the atoning blood of  Christ, there would be no baptism for salvation. If his blood had not  been shed, there would be no redemption from the fall; the banishment  of Adam and Eve and their posterity would have been perpetual, and the  grave's victory eternal. There would be no baptism, no remission of  sins, no resurrection, but for the shedding of the blood of the Lamb of  God. Hence John the apostle says: \"The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth  us from all sin\" (1 John 1:7).    The Mediator.--The water and the spirit, representing, respectively,  earth and heaven, are made effectual by the blood. Man and God are thus  reconciled; Christ being the Mediator and Reconciler. There are three  that bear record in heaven--the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.  There are three that bear witness on earth--the spirit, the water, and  the blood. Each group corresponds to the other; each three agree in  one. Hence, when a soul is baptized, it must be by water and by spirit,  made effectual by blood, and in the name of the Father, the Son, and  the Holy Ghost.    Three in One.--Spirit, water, and blood-the three elements of  baptism--were combined in the person of Jesus when he was baptized  by John in the Jordan. Standing upon the river's brink, his sacred  form dripping with the waters from which he had just emerged, he was  crowned with the Holy Ghost, descending upon him from above. Yet it was  necessary that his blood should be shed, that the Spirit might come  unto his disciples. Not until the Mediator had hung between heaven and  earth, did the Holy Ghost, as the witness of his consummated sacrifice,  appear upon the scene. Not till then were the apostles endued with  power from on high. Not till then did the Spirit of God move upon the  waters of this world, coming, as in the first instance, that there  might be a creation, a new birth, a regeneration for the human race.    The Fathers Understood.--The Greek fathers of the Christian Church held  correct ideas concerning baptism. This is shown in the terms used by  them to describe it--\"initiation,\" from its introductory character;  \"regeneration,\" from its being regarded as a new birth; \"the great  circumcision,\" because it was held to have superseded the circumcision  of the Mosaic law; \"illumination,\" and \"the gift of the Lord,\" with  reference to the Holy Ghost. Other synonyms for the sacred ceremonial  were \"consecration\" and \"consummation.\" Those baptized were understood  to have consecrated their lives to God, and to have consummated or  completed their preparation for communion with the Church of Christ.  Only to such as had been baptized was the Sacrament of the Lord's  Supper administered.    Early Greek Christians.--The Greek Christians of the early centuries,  like the Saints of New Testament times, baptized for the remission of  sins. They have been censured by modern critics for magnifying the  importance of water baptism, and at the same time insisting on the  purely ethical or spiritual nature of the rite; for confounding the  sign with the thing signified, the action of the water with the action  of the Spirit, in the process of regeneration. But they were not any  more insistent upon these points than the apostles themselves.    Augustine's Theory.--St. Augustine is complimented by the same critics  for formulating the first strict scientific theory of the nature and  effects of baptism. He drew a sharp distinction between what he called  \"the outward sign\"--water baptism--and the inward change of heart  resulting from the operation of the Holy Ghost. Yet even he is charged  with laying too much stress upon the value of \"the outward sign,\" which  he held to be essential to salvation.    Protestant theologians have been commended for keeping the \"sign\" in  due subordination to \"the thing signified,\" for justifying themselves  by faith, and ignoring to a great extent outward ordinances.    But the Greek Christians, whatever their defects, were nearer right  than St. Augustine; and the Catholic St. Augustine was nearer right  than the Protestant theologians who followed him. Baptism, as taught in  the New Testament, is not the mere \"outward sign of an inward grace.\"  The action of the water and the action of the Spirit are not to be  separated in any analysis of the nature and effects of baptism. Both  are essential in the soul-cleansing, soul-enlightening, process, modern  critics to the contrary notwithstanding.        CHAPTER VII.    Mode and Meaning of Baptism.    Use of the Figurative.--When Jesus told Nicodemus that a man must be  born again--born of water and of the Spirit--he virtually declared the  meaning of the ordinance and prescribed the mode of its administration.  Our Savior was not a mere rhetorician, ornamenting his speech for the  mere sake of ornament. A true son of the Orient, naturally given to  the use of figurative language, he was not a flourisher of phrases,  a flaunter of vain show. His parables are poems, but they teach the  truth in plainness to the wise; and because he recognized, as all great  teachers do, the power of poetic symbolism to illustrate and impress  the truth, he used it as a medium of instruction. But symbols are  not arbitrarily invented by those who use them. They are already in  existence, awaiting recognition. Poetic genius recognizes and applies  them--that is all. God has built his universe upon symbols. In every  department of creation the lesser symbolizes the greater and leads up  to its comprehension.    Like Suggests Like.--What said the Lord to Moses? \"All things have  their likeness, and all things are created and made to bear record of  me, both things which are temporal, and things which are spiritual;  things which are in the heavens above, and things which are on the  earth, and things which are in the earth, and things which are under  the earth, both above and beneath: all things bear record of me\" (Moses  6:63).    Man is a symbol of God, and is destined to become God; Earth is typical  of heaven, and will yet be converted into a heaven. \"If two things  exist, and there be one above the other, there shall be greater things  above them\" (Abraham 3:16). Plato grasped the idea: \"All things are in  a scale, and begin where we will, ascend and ascend, and what we call  results are beginnings.\"    The Resurrection Foreshadowed.--It was to prepare the way before a  greater and higher principle, that Christ taught and exemplified  the principle of baptism. That greater and higher principle was the  resurrection, a doctrine difficult for even the apostles to comprehend,  and one that he repeatedly impressed upon them, both before and after  he arose from the dead. Hence he compared baptism to a birth--the  entry, and the only one, into mortal life; and this pointed forward to  the resurrection--the entry, and the only one, into immortal glory.  Men should therefore be prepared for something suggestive of a birth,  of a resurrection, in the ordinance prescribed by him as the means of  admittance into his kingdom. That suggestion is fully realized in the  true form of the baptismal ordinance--immersion.    Why the Savior was Baptized.--Baptism was made universal, and became  the doorway to the Church of Christ, the kingdom of God on earth,  because it symbolizes the resurrection, which is also universal, and  without which no man can enter into the heavenly Church and Kingdom.    Here we touch, I think, the real reason, or at least one of the  principal reasons, why Jesus was baptized. He was the Exemplar of  the Resurrection--the first to rise from the grave: and as baptism  represents the resurrection, it was fitting and appropriate that he  should also undergo that sacred ordinance.    Immersion.--\"Born of water\" means to come out of the water, and coming  out of the water, presupposes going into the water. This is why we are  baptized by immersion, which means sinking, dipping, burying, plunging."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5061"],[0,"The Children's Book of Christmas Stories (#12)"],[1,"'ll drop in to-morrow night, and just see how you like it,\" he said.  Then, with a nod, he was gone.    The old fear came back when she woke in the morning, and she tied on her  shoes with a tremble at her heart. Downstairs she stole. The first thing  she saw was a wooden ship standing on her plate. Marc had made the ship,  but Toinette had no idea it was for her.    The little ones sat round the table with their eyes on the door,  watching till Toinette should come in and be surprised.    \"I wish she'd hurry,\" said Pierre, drumming on his bowl with a spoon.    \"We all want Toinette, don't we?\" said the mother, smiling as she poured  the hot porridge.    \"It will be fun to see her stare,\" declared Marc.    \"Toinette is jolly when she stares. Her eyes look big and her cheeks  grow pink. Andre Brugen thinks his sister Aline is prettiest, but I  don't. Our Toinette is ever so pretty.\"    \"She is ever so nice, too,\" said Pierre. \"She's as good to play with  as--as--a boy,\" finished triumphantly.    \"Oh, I wish my Toinette would come,\" said Jeanneton.    Toinette waited no longer, but sped upstairs with glad tears in her  eyes. Two minutes, and down she came again visible this time. Her heart  was light as a feather.    \"Merry Christmas!\" clamoured the children. The ship was presented,  Toinette was duly surprised, and so the happy day began.    That night Toinette left the window open, and lay down in her clothes;  for she felt, as Thistle had been so kind, she ought to receive him  politely. He came at midnight, and with him all the other little men in  green.    \"Well, how was it?\" asked Thistle.    \"Oh, I liked it this time,\" declared Toinette, with shining eyes, \"and I  thank you so much.\"    \"I'm glad you did,\" said the elf. \"And I'm glad you are thankful, for we  want you to do something for us.\"    \"What can it be?\" inquired Toinette, wondering.    \"You must know,\" went on Thistle, \"that there is no dainty in the world  which we elves enjoy like a bowl of fern-seed broth. But it has to be  cooked over a real fire, and we dare not go near fire, you know, lest  our wings scorch. So we seldom get any fern-seed broth. Now, Toinette,  will you make us some?\"    \"Indeed, I will!\" cried Toinette, \"only you must tell me how.\"    \"It is very simple,\" said Peascod; \"only seed and honey dew, stirred  from left to right with a sprig of fennel. Here's the seed and the  fennel, and here's the dew. Be sure and stir from the left; if you  don't, it curdles, and the flavour will be spoiled.\"    Down into the kitchen they went, and Toinette, moving very softly,  quickened the fire, set on the smallest bowl she could find, and  spread the doll's table with the wooden saucers which Marc had made for  Jeanneton to play with. Then she mixed and stirred as the elves bade,  and when the soup was done, served it to them smoking hot. How they  feasted! No bumblebee, dipping into a flower-cup, ever sipped and  twinkled more rapturously than they.    When the last drop was eaten, they made ready to go. Each in turn  kissed Toinette's hand, and said a word of farewell. Thistle brushed his  feathered cap over the doorpost as he passed.    \"Be lucky, house,\" he said, \"for you have received and entertained the  luck-bringers. And be lucky, Toinette. Good temper is good luck, and  sweet words and kind looks and peace in the heart are the fairest of  fortunes. See that you never lose them again, my girl.\" With this, he,  too, kissed Toinette's hand, waved his feathered cap, and--whir! they  all were gone, while Toinette, covering the fire with ashes and putting  aside the little cups, stole up to her bed a happy child.          IX. THE VOYAGE OF THE WEE RED CAP    *Published originally in the Outlook. Reprinted here by arrangement with  the author.    RUTH SAWYER DURAND    It was the night of St. Stephen, and Teig sat alone by his fire with  naught in his cupboard but a pinch of tea and a bare mixing of meal, and  a heart inside of him as soft and warm as the ice on the water-bucket  outside the door. The tuft was near burnt on the hearth--a handful of  golden cinders left, just; and Teig took to counting them greedily on  his fingers.    \"There's one, two, three, an' four an' five,\" he laughed. \"Faith, there  be more bits o' real gold hid undther the loose clay in the corner.\"    It was the truth; and it was the scraping and scrooching for the last  piece that had left Teig's cupboard bare of a Christmas dinner.    \"Gold is betther nor eatin' an' dthrinkin'. An' if ye have naught to  give, there'll be naught asked of ye;\" and he laughed again.    He was thinking of the neighbours, and the doles of food and piggins of  milk that would pass over their thresholds that night to the vagabonds  and paupers who were sure to come begging. And on the heels of that  thought followed another: who would be giving old Barney his dinner?  Barney lived a stone's throw from Teig, alone, in a wee tumbled-in  cabin; and for a score of years past Teig had stood on the doorstep  every Christmas Eve, and, making a hollow of his two hands, had called  across the road:    \"Hey, there, Barney, will ye come over for a sup?\"    And Barney had reached for his crutches--there being but one leg to  him--and had come.    \"Faith,\" said Teig, trying another laugh, \"Barney can fast for the once;  'twill be all the same in a month's time.\" And he fell to thinking of  the gold again. A knock came at the door. Teig pulled himself down in  his chair where the shadow would cover him, and held his tongue.    \"Teig, Teig!\" It was the widow O'Donnelly's voice. \"If ye are there,  open your door. I have not got the pay for the spriggin' this month, an'  the childher are needin' food.\"    But Teig put the leash on his tongue, and never stirred till he heard  the tramp of her feet going on to the next cabin. Then he saw to it that  the door was tight-barred. Another knock came, and it was a stranger's  voice this time:    \"The other cabins are filled; not one but has its hearth crowded; will  ye take us in--the two of us? The wind bites mortal sharp, not a morsel  o' food have ne tasted this day. Masther, will ye take us in?\"    But Teig sat on, a-holding his tongue; and the tramp of the strangers'  feet passed down the road. Others took their place--small feet, running.  It was the miller's wee Cassie, and she called out as she ran by.    \"Old Barney's watchin' for ye. Ye'll not be forgettin' him, will ye,  Teig?\"    And then the child broke into a song, sweet and clear, as she passed  down the road:         \"Listen all ye, 'tis the Feast o' St. Stephen,       Mind that ye keep it, this holy even.       Open your door an' greet ye the stranger--       For ye mind that the wee Lord had naught but a manger.                  Mhuire as truagh!         \"Feed ye the hungry an' rest ye the weary,       This ye must do for the sake of Our Mary.       'Tis well that ye mind--ye who sit by the fire--       That the Lord he was born in a dark and cold byre.                  Mhuire as truagh!\"    Teig put his fingers deep in his ears. \"A million murdthering curses on  them that won't let me be! Can't a man try to keep what is his without  bein' pesthered by them that has only idled an' wasted their days?\"    And then the strange thing happened: hundreds and hundreds of wee lights  began dancing outside the window, making the room bright; the hands of  the clock began chasing each other round the dial, and the bolt of the  door drew itself out. Slowly, without a creak or a cringe, the door  opened, and in there trooped a crowd of the Good People. Their wee green  cloaks were folded close about them, and each carried a rush candle.    Teig was filled with a great wonderment, entirely, when he saw the  fairies, but when they saw him they laughed.    \"We are takin' the loan o' your cabin this night, Teig,\" said they. \"Ye  are the only man hereabout with an empty hearth, an' we're needin' one.\"    Without saying more, they bustled about the room making ready. They  lengthened out the table and spread and set it; more of the Good People  trooped in, bringing stools and food and drink. The pipers came last,  and they sat themselves around the chimney-piece a-blowing their  chanters and trying the drones. The feasting began and the pipers played  and never had Teig seen such a sight in his life. Suddenly a wee man  sang out:    \"Clip, clap, clip, clap, I wish I had my wee red cap!\" And out of the  air there tumbled the neatest cap Teig ever laid his two eyes on. The  wee man clapped it on his head, crying:    \"I wish I was in Spain!\" and--whist--up the chimney he went, and away  out of sight.    It happened just as I am telling it. Another wee man called for his cap,  and away he went after the first. And then another and another until the  room was empty and Teig sat alone again.    \"By my soul,\" said Teig, \"I'd like to thravel that way myself! It's a  grand savin' of tickets an' baggage; an' ye get to a place before ye've  had time to change your mind. Faith there is no harm done if I thry it.\"    So he sang the fairies' rhyme and out of the air dropped a wee cap for  him. For a moment the wonder had him, but the next he was clapping the  cap on his head and crying:    \"Spain!\"    Then--whist--up the chimney he went after the fairies, and before he had  time to let out his breath he was standing in the middle of Spain, and  strangeness all about him.    He was in a great city. The doorways of the houses were hung with  flowers and the air was warm and sweet with the smell of them. Torches  burned along the streets, sweetmeat-sellers went about crying their  wares, and on the steps of the cathedral crouched a crowd of beggars.    \"What's the meanin' o' that?\" asked Teig of one of the fairies. \"They  are waiting for those that are hearing mass. When they come out, they  give half of what they have to those that have nothing, so on this night  of all the year there shall be no hunger and no cold.\""]]]
