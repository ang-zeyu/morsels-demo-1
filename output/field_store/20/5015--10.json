They would always in the future go with him.    And so for ever the Goolahwilleels went in flocks, never more singly,  in search of food.          22.  GOONUR, THE WOMAN-DOCTOR      Goonur was a clever old woman-doctor, who lived with her son, Goonur,  and his two wives. The wives were Guddah the red lizard, and Beereeun  the small, prickly lizard. One day the two wives had done something to  anger Goonur, their husband, and he gave them both a great beating.  After their beating they went away by themselves. They said to each  other that they could stand their present life no longer, and yet there  was no escape unless they killed their husband. They decided they would  do that. But how? That was the question. It must be by cunning.    At last they decided on a plan. They dug a big hole in the sand near  the creek, filled it with water, and covered the hole over with boughs,  leaves, and grass.    \"Now we will go,\" they said, \"and tell our husband that we have found a  big bandicoot's nest.\"    Back they went to the camp, and told Goonur that they had seen a big  nest of bandicoots near the creek; that if he sneaked up he would be  able to surprise them and get the lot.    Off went Goonur in great haste. He sneaked up to within a couple of  feet of the nest, then gave a spring on to the top of it. And only when  he felt the bough top give in with him, and he sank down into water,  did he realise that he had been tricked. Too late then to save himself,  for he was drowning and could not escape. His wives had watched the  success of their stratagem from a distance. When they were certain that  they had effectually disposed of their hated husband, they went back to  the camp. Goonur, the mother, soon missed her son, made inquiries of  his wives, but gained no information from them. Two or three days  passed, and yet Goonur, the son, returned not. Seriously alarmed at his  long absence without having given her notice of his intention, the  mother determined to follow his track. She took up his trail where she  had last seen him leave the camp. This she followed until she reached  the so-called bandicoot's nest. Here his tracks disappeared, and  nowhere could she find a sign of his having returned from this place.  She felt in the hole with her yarn stick, and soon felt that there was  something large there in the water. She cut a forked stick and tried to  raise the body and get it out, for she felt sure it must be her son.  But she could not raise it; stick after stick broke in the effort. At  last she cut a midjee stick and tried with that, and then she was  successful. When she brought out the body she found it was indeed her  son. She dragged the body to an ant bed, and watched intently to see if  the stings of the ants brought any sign of returning life. Soon her  hope was realised, and after a violent twitching of the muscles her son  regained consciousness. As soon as he was able to do so, he told her of  the trick his wives had played on him.    Goonur, the mother, was furious. \"No more shall they have you as  husband. You shall live hidden in my dardurr. When we get near the camp  you can get into this long, big comebee, and I will take you in. When  you want to go hunting I will take you from the camp in this comebee,  and when we are out of sight you can get out and hunt as of old.\"    And thus they managed for some time to keep his return a secret; and  little the wives knew that their husband was alive and in his mother's  camp. But as day after day Goonur, the mother, returned from hunting  loaded with spoils, they began to think she must have help from some  one; for surely, they said, no old woman could be so successful in  hunting. There was a mystery they were sure, and they were determined  to find it out.    \"See,\" they said, \"she goes out alone. She is old, and yet she brings  home more than we two do together, and we are young. To-day she brought  opossums, piggiebillahs, honey yams, quatha, and many things. We got  little, yet we went far. We will watch her.\"    The next time old Goonur went out, carrying her big comebee, the wives  watched her.    \"Look,\" they said, \"how slowly she goes. She could not climb trees for  opossums--she is too old and weak; look how she staggers.\"    They went cautiously after her, and saw when she was some distance from  the camp that she put down her comebee. And out of it, to their  amazement, stepped Goonur, their husband.    \"Ah,\" they said, \"this is her secret. She must have found him, and, as  she is a great doctor, she was able to bring him to life again. We must  wait until she leaves him, and then go to him, and beg to know where he  has been, and pretend joy that he is back, or else surely now he is  alive again he will sometime kill us.\"    Accordingly, when Goonur was alone the two wives ran to him, and said:    \"Why, Goonur, our husband, did you leave us? Where have you been all  the time that we, your wives, have mourned for you? Long has the time  been without you, and we, your wives, have been sad that you came no  more to our dardurr.\"    Goonur, the husband, affected to believe their sorrow was genuine, and  that they did not know when they directed him to the bandicoot's nest  that it was a trap. Which trap, but for his mother, might have been his  grave.    They all went hunting together, and when they had killed enough for  food they returned to the camp. As they came near to the camp, Goonur,  the mother, saw them coming, and cried out:    \"Would you again be tricked by your wives? Did I save you from death  only that you might again be killed? I spared them, but I would I had  slain them, if again they are to have a chance of killing you, my son.  Many are the wiles of women, and another time I might not be able to  save you. Let them live if you will it so, my son, but not with you.  They tried to lure you to death; you are no longer theirs, mine only  now, for did I not bring you back from the dead?\"    But Goonur the husband said, \"In truth did you save me, my mother, and  these my wives rejoice that you did. They too, as I was, were deceived  by the bandicoot's nest, the work of an enemy yet to be found. See, my  mother, do not the looks of love in their eyes, and words of love on  their lips vouch for their truth? We will be as we have been, my  mother, and live again in peace.\"    And thus craftily did Goonur the husband deceive his wives and make  them believe he trusted them wholly, while in reality his mind was even  then plotting vengeance. In a few days he had his plans ready. Having  cut and pointed sharply two stakes, he stuck them firmly in the creek,  then he placed two logs on the bank, in front of the sticks, which were  underneath the water, and invisible. Having made his preparations, he  invited his wives to come for a bathe. He said when they reached the  creek:    \"See those two logs on the bank, you jump in each from one and see  which can dive the furthest. I will go first to see you as you come  up.\" And in he jumped, carefully avoiding the pointed stakes. \"Right,\"  he called. \"All is clear here, jump in.\"    Then the two wives ran down the bank each to a log and jumped from it.  Well had Goonur calculated the distance, for both jumped right on to  the stakes placed in the water to catch them, and which stuck firmly  into them, holding them under the water.    \"Well am I avenged,\" said Goonur. \"No more will my wives lay traps to  catch me.\" And he walked off to the camp.    His mother asked him where his wives were. \"They left me,\" he said, \"to  get bees' nests.\"    But as day by day passed and the wives returned not, the old woman  began to suspect that her son knew more than he said. She asked him no  more, but quietly watched her opportunity, when her son was away  hunting, and then followed the tracks of the wives. She tracked them to  the creek, and as she saw no tracks of their return, she went into the  creek, felt about, and there found the two bodies fast on the stakes.  She managed to get them off and out of the creek, then she determined  to try and restore them to life, for she was angry that her son had not  told her what he had done, but had deceived her as well as his wives.  She rubbed the women with some of her medicines, dressed the wounds  made by the stakes, and then dragged them both on to ants' nests and  watched their bodies as the ants crawled over them, biting them. She  had not long to wait; soon they began to move and come to life again.    As soon as they were restored Goonur took them back to the camp and  said to Goonur her son, \"Now once did I use my knowledge to restore  life to you, and again have I used it to restore life to your wives.  You are all mine now, and I desire that you live in peace and never  more deceive me, or never again shall I use my skill for you:\"    And they lived for a long while together, and when the Mother Doctor  died there was a beautiful, dazzlingly bright falling star, followed by  a sound as of a sharp clap of thunder, and all the tribes round when  they saw and heard this said, \"A great doctor must have died, for that  is the sign.\" And when the wives died, they were taken up to the sky,  where they are now known as Gwaibillah, the red star, so called from  its bright red colour, owing, the legend says, to the red marks left by  the stakes on the bodies of the two women, and which nothing could  efface.          23.  DEEREEREE THE WAGTAIL, AND THE RAINBOW      Deereeree was a widow and lived in a camp alone with her four little  girls. One day Bibbee came and made a camp not far from hers. Deereeree  was frightened of him, too frightened to go to sleep. All night she  used to watch his camp, and if she heard a sound she would cry aloud:  \"Deerceree, wyah, wyah, Deereeree,\" Sometimes she would be calling out  nearly all night.

Mus. Canada;  obtained on September 21, 1940, by J. Dewey Soper, from 2-1/2 mi. NW Lake  Audy, Riding Mtn. Nat'l Park, Manitoba.    _Range._--Southwestern Manitoba to central Saskatchewan.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium to small for the species; measurements of  type and two topotypes are: total length, 107, 108, 117; tail, 45, 45,  45; hind foot, 12.1, 12.3, 12.5. Color dark brownish or fuscous in  summer pelage; winter pelage unknown.    _Comparison._--Resembles _S. v. obscurus_ in size; darker than  _obscurus_ in summer pelage; cranium slightly higher and top more  nearly flat; larger and darker in summer pelage than the new  subspecies from central Montana.    _Remarks._--In their description of this subspecies Anderson and Rand  pointed out that specimens from the type locality and from central  Saskatchewan represent the dark extreme in a color cline which begins  in south-central British Columbia with \"pale, brownish-tinged  animals.\" These authors referred shrews from Cypress Hills,  southwestern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta to _S. o. soperi_,  although they noted that these specimens, taken by themselves, are not  strikingly different from _S. o. obscurus_ from the Rocky Mountains.  The specimens from the Cypress Hills were included in _soperi_ because  the authors felt that the subspecific boundary should be drawn \"where  specimens average about half way between the extremes (of the cline)  in characters.\"    It is true, as Anderson and Rand say, that the shrews from Cypress  Hills are hardly separable from those from, say, Waterton Lakes Park.  The specimens from the Cypress Hills are noticeably different from  specimens from the Okanagan area, but some of the latter, in my  opinion may represent intergrades between _S. v. obscurus_ and the  more reddish _S. v. vagrans_ and are not, at any rate, typical  _obscurus_. In view of the similarity of shrews from Cypress Hills to  typical _S. v. obscurus_ and since the Cypress Hills are much nearer  to the range of _S. v. obscurus_ than to the record-stations of  occurrence in central Saskatchewan and Manitoba, I have chosen to  restrict the name _soperi_ to shrews from these latter two localities.  Seemingly _S. vagrans_ is absent from the plains separating the  Cypress Hills from the Rocky Mountains and from Riding Mountain  National Park.    _Specimens examined._--none.    _Marginal records._--SASKATCHEWAN: Prince Albert National Park, 1700  ft.

Hooper from 25 mi.  ESE Big Sandy, Eagle Creek, Chouteau Co., Montana, original no. 2184.    _Range._--Central Montana; marginal localities are: Bearpaw Mts.,  Zortman, Big Snowy Mts., Buffalo, Little Belt Mts.    _Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; measurements of three  topotypes are: total length, 101, 105, 108; tail, 39, 40, 42; hind  foot, 11.5, 11.5, 12. Color pale; summer pelage: back near (17'''_k_)  Olive Brown but hairs of dorsum with a pale, buffy band proximal from  the tips which imparts a pale over-all appearance; flanks near Wood  Brown; underparts Pale Smoke Gray, usually not with a buffy wash;  color of underparts often extending along margin of upper lip. Skull  small for species; rostrum relatively broad and heavy; relatively  broad interorbitally.    _Comparisons._--From _S. v. obscurus_, _S. v. longiquus_ differs as  follows: size smaller; skull smaller in all dimensions although  similar in proportion. From _S. v. soperi_, _S. v. longiquus_ differs  in: size smaller; color paler in summer pelage. From _S. v. vagrans_,  _S. v. longiquus_ differs in: color paler in summer pelage, less  brownish; color of venter extending higher on flanks; venter Pale  Smoke Gray, rarely tinged with buffy rather than usually tinged with  buffy. From _S. v. monticola_, _S. v. longiquus_ differs in: summer  pelage slightly paler, venter Pale Smoke Gray rather than suffused  with buffy.    _Remarks._--The subspecies _longiquus_ is obviously derived from the  neighboring _S. v. obscurus_ and differs from it mainly in size. Some  specimens of obscurus from western Montana show evidences of  intergradation with _S. v. vagrans_ in possessing a somewhat buffy  belly and these are thus more strikingly different from _longiquus_  than are other specimens of _obscurus_. Many specimens of _obscurus_  from the eastern slope of the Lewis and Clark Range in Montana show  the tricolored pattern seen in many specimens of _longiquus_. The  smallest individuals of longiquus are found on the Big Snowy  Mountains. Intergradation with _obscurus_ is seen in specimens here  referred to _S. v. obscurus_ from the Big Belt Mountains.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 45.

Washington, 26:133, May 21, 1913.    _Type._--Adult male, skin and skull; No. 100440, U. S. Biol. Surv.  Coll.; obtained on May 29, 1900, by Vernon Bailey, from Cloudcroft,  9000 ft., Otero Co., New Mexico.    _Range._--Sacramento and Capitan Mountains of New Mexico.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the species; average and extreme  measurements of 4 topotypes are: total length, 105.2 (103-107); tail,  41.0 (39-42); hind foot, 13.1 (12.5-14). Color near Olive Brown in  summer; winter pelage unknown; skull large and relatively broad; teeth  relatively large.    _Comparisons._--Skull larger than that of _S. v. obscurus_ and  relatively somewhat broader; much larger in all cranial dimensions  than _S. v. monticola_.    _Remarks._--_S. v. neomexicanus_ is a well-marked subspecies seemingly  limited to the mountains of southeastern New Mexico. It is the only  species of _Sorex_ thus far recorded from that area.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 12. NEW MEXICO: _Otero Co._: SW  slope Capitan Mts., 2 BS; 10 mi. NE Cloudcroft, 2 BS;"]]]
