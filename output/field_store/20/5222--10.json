Some of the ladies said they wish that  my father was back here with his legion, for that there are but few  soldiers, and if Decianus continues to treat the people so badly  there may be trouble. What do you think, Beric?\"    \"I cannot say,\" he replied. \"It seems to me that the Romans are  bent upon crushing us down altogether. They have just captured our  Holy Island, slaying the priests and priestesses, and overthrowing  the altars, while Nero's officers wring from the people the last  coin and the last animal they possess. I fear that there will be  trouble, Berenice. No men worthy of the name could see their gods  insulted and themselves despoiled of all they possess without  striking a blow in defence.\"    \"But they will only bring more trouble upon themselves,\" the girl  said gravely. \"I have heard my father lament that they forced us to  fight against them, though you know he held that it was our fault  more than theirs, and that if they were ruled kindly and wisely,  as were the people in Southern Gaul, where the legion was stationed  before it came over here, they would settle down and live peaceably,  and be greatly benefited by our rule.\"    \"If you treat a man as you would a dog you must not be surprised  if he bites you,\" Beric said. \"Some of your people not only think  that we are dogs, but that we are toothless ones. Mayhap they will  find their mistake some day.\"    \"But you will never fight against us, Beric,\" the girl said anxiously,  \"after living so long among us?\"    \"I would not fight against your father or against those who have  treated me well,\" he replied; \"but against those who ill treat and  abuse us I would fight when my countrymen fought. Yet if I could  ever do you a service, Berenice, I would lay down my life to do  it.\"    The event seemed so improbable to the girl that she passed over  the promise without comment.    \"So you are a chief, Beric! But I thought chiefs wore golden  bracelets and ornaments, and you are just as you were when you came  here last.\"    \"Because I come here only as a visitor. If I came on a mission from  the queen, or as one of a deputation of chiefs, I should wear my  ornaments. I wear them at home now, those that my father had.\"    Beric stayed for some hours chatting with Berenice, and his old  instructor, who had been left by Caius in charge of the household.  As he walked home he wondered over the careless security of  the Romans, and vowed that should opportunity occur he would save  Berenice from the fate that was likely to fall upon all in Camalodunum  should the Britons rise.        CHAPTER IV: AN INFURIATED PEOPLE      \"A fresh misfortune has occurred,\" was the greeting with which  Beric's mother met him on his return home. \"Prasutagus is dead; and  this is not the worst, he has left half his estates to the Roman  Emperor.\"    \"To the Roman Emperor!\" Beric repeated; \"is it possible, mother?\"    \"It is true, Beric. You know he has always tried to curry favour  with the Romans, and has kept the Iceni from joining when other  tribes rose against Rome. He has thought of nothing but amassing  wealth, and in all Britain there is no man who could compare with  him in riches. Doubtless he felt that the Romans only bided their  time to seize what he had gathered, and so, in order that Boadicea  and his daughters should enjoy in peace a portion of his stores,  he has left half to Nero. The man was a fool as well as a traitor.  The peasant who throws a child out of the door to the wolves knows  that it does but whet their appetite for blood, and so it will be  in this case. I hear Prasutagus died a week since, though the news  has come but slowly, and already a horde of Roman officials have  arrived in Norfolk, and are proceeding to make inventories of the  king's possessions, and to bear themselves as insolently as if they  were masters of all. Trouble must come, and that soon. Boadicea is  of different stuff to her husband; she will not bear the insolence  of the Romans. It would have been well for the Iceni had Prasutagus  died twenty years ago and she had ruled our country.\"    \"The gods have clearly willed, mother, that we should rise as one  people against the Romans. It may be that it was for this that they  did not defend their shrines from the impious hands of the invaders.  Nought else stirred the Britons to lay aside their jealousies and  act as one people. Now from end to end of the island all are burning  for vengeance. Just at this moment, comes the death of the Romans'  friend Prasutagus, and the passing of the rule of the Iceni into  the hands of Boadicea. With the Romans in her capital the occasion  will assuredly not long be wanting, and then there will be such a  rising as the Romans have never yet seen; and then, their purpose  effected, the gods may well fight on our side. I would that there  had been five more years in which to prepare for the struggle, but  if it must come it must. This Catus Decianus is just the man to  bring it on. Haughty, arrogant, and greedy, he knows nothing of  us, and has never faced the Britons in arms. Had Suetonius been  here he would not have acted thus with regard to the affairs of  Prasutagus. Had Caius Muro not been absent his voice might have been  raised in warning to the tyrant; but everything seems to conspire  together, mother, to bring on the crisis.\"    \"The sooner the better,\" Parta exclaimed vehemently. \"It is true  that in time you might teach the whole Iceni to fight in Roman  methods, but what is good for the Romans may not be good for us.  Moreover, every year that passes strengthens their hold on the  land. Their forts spring up everywhere, their cities grow apace;  every month numbers flock over here. Another five years, my son,  and their hold might be too strong to shake off.\"    \"That is so, mother. Thinking of ourselves I thought not of them;  it may be that it were better to fight now than to wait. Well,  whenever the signal is given, and from wheresoever it comes, we  are ready.\"    Since the news of the capture of Mona had arrived, the tribesmen  had drilled with increased alacrity and eagerness. Every man saw  that the struggle with Rome must ere long take place, and was eager  to take a leading share in the conflict. It was upon them that the  blow had fallen most heavily in the former partial rising, and they  knew that the other tribes of the Iceni held that their defence of  their camp should not have been overborne by the Romans as it was;  hence they had something of a private wrong as well as a national  one to avenge. Another fortnight was spent in constant work, until  one day the news came that Boadicea's daughters had been most  grossly insulted by the Roman officers, and that the queen herself  had started for Camalodunum to demand from Decianus a redress of  their wrongs and the punishment of the offenders. The excitement  was intense. Every man felt the outrage upon the daughters of their  queen as a personal injury, and when Beric took his place before  the men of the tribe, who were drawn up in military order, a shout  arose: \"Lead us to Camalodunum! Let us take vengeance!\"    \"Not yet,\" Beric cried. \"The queen has gone there; we must wait  the issue. Not until she gives the orders must we move. A rising  now would endanger her safety. We must wait, my friends, until all  are as ready as we are; when the time comes you will not find me  backward in leading you.\"    Three days later came news that seemed at first incredible, but  which was speedily confirmed. Decianus had received the queen, had  scoffed at her complaints, and when, fired with indignation, she  had used threats, he had ordered his soldiers to strip and scourge  her, and the sentence had actually been carried into effect. Then  the rage of the tribesmen knew no bounds, and it needed the utmost  persuasions of Parta herself to induce them to wait until news came  from the north.    \"Fear not,\" she said, \"that your vengeance will be baulked. Boadicea  will not submit to this double indignity, of that you maybe sure.  Wait until you hear from her. When measures are determined upon  in this matter the Iceni must act as one man. We are all equally  outraged in the persons of our queen and her daughters; all have  a right to a share in avenging her insults. We might spoil all  by moving before the others are ready. When we move it must be as  a mighty torrent to overwhelm the invaders. Not Camalodunum only,  but every Roman town must be laid in ruins. It must be a life  and death struggle between us and Rome; we must conquer now or be  enslaved for ever.\"    It was not long before messengers arrived from Boadicea, bidding  the Sarci prepare for war, and summoning Parta and her son to a  council of the chiefs of the tribe, to be held under a well known  sacred oak in the heart of the forest, near Norwich. Parta's chariot  was at once prepared, together with a second, which was to carry  Boduoc and a female attendant of Parta, and as soon as the horses  were harnessed they started. Two long days' journey brought them  to the place of meeting. The scene was a busy one. Already fully  two score of the chiefs had arrived. Parta was received with great  marks of respect. The Sarci were the tribe lying nearest to the  Romans, and upon them the brunt of the Roman anger would fall, as  it had done before; but her appearance in answer to the summons  showed, it was thought, their willingness to join in the general  action of the tribe.    Beric was looked at curiously. His four years' residence among the  Romans caused him to be regarded with a certain amount of suspicion,  which had been added to by rumours that he had been impressing  upon the tribe the greatness and power of Rome. Of late there had  been reports brought by wandering bards that the Sarci were being  practised in the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],[0,"The Amateur Cracksman (#12)"],[1,"a man who knelt over him.  \"He's got a bullet in  him somewhere.\"    \"Is he alive?\"    \"Barely.\"    \"Good God!  Where's Crowley?\"    \"Here I am,\" called a breathless voice.  \"It's no good, you fellows.  There's nothing to show which way they've gone.  Here's Raffles; he's  chucked it, too.\"  And they ran up panting.    \"Well, we've got one of them, at all events,\" muttered Lord Amersteth.  \"The next thing is to get this poor fellow indoors.  Take his  shoulders, somebody.  Now his middle.  Join hands under him.  All  together, now; that's the way.  Poor fellow!  Poor fellow!  His name  isn't Clephane at all.  He's a Scotland Yard detective, down here for  these very villains!\"    Raffles was the first to express surprise; but he had also been the  first to raise the wounded man.  Nor had any of them a stronger or more  tender hand in the slow procession to the house.    In a little we had the senseless man stretched on a sofa in the  library.  And there, with ice on his wound and brandy in his throat,  his eyes opened and his lips moved.    Lord Amersteth bent down to catch the words.    \"Yes, yes,\" said he; \"we've got one of them safe and sound.  The brute  you collared upstairs.\" Lord Amersteth bent lower.  \"By Jove!  Lowered  the jewel-case out of the window, did he?  And they've got clean away  with it!  Well, well!  I only hope we'll be able to pull this good  fellow through.  He's off again.\"    An hour passed: the sun was rising.    It found a dozen young fellows on the settees in the billiard-room,  drinking whiskey and soda-water in their overcoats and pyjamas, and  still talking excitedly in one breath.  A time-table was being passed  from hand to hand: the doctor was still in the library.  At last the  door opened, and Lord Amersteth put in his head.    \"It isn't hopeless,\" said he, \"but it's bad enough. There'll be no  cricket to-day.\"    Another hour, and most of us were on our way to catch the early train;  between us we filled a compartment almost to suffocation.  And still we  talked all together of the night's event; and still I was a little hero  in my way, for having kept my hold of the one ruffian who had been  taken; and my gratification was subtle and intense.  Raffles watched me  under lowered lids.  Not a word had we had together; not a word did we  have until we had left the others at Paddington, and were skimming  through the streets in a hansom with noiseless tires and a tinkling  bell.    \"Well, Bunny,\" said Raffles, \"so the professors have it, eh?\"    \"Yes,\" said I.  \"And I'm jolly glad!\"    \"That poor Mackenzie has a ball in his chest?\"    \"That you and I have been on the decent side for once.\"    He shrugged his shoulders.    \"You're hopeless, Bunny, quite hopeless!  I take it you wouldn't have  refused your share if the boodle had fallen to us?  Yet you positively  enjoy coming off second best--for the second time running!  I confess,  however, that the professors' methods were full of interest to me.  I,  for one, have probably gained as much in experience as I have lost in  other things.  That lowering the jewel-case out of the window was a  very simple and effective expedient; two of them had been waiting below  for it for hours.\"    \"How do you know?\" I asked.    \"I saw them from my own window, which was just above the dear old  lady's.  I was fretting for that necklace in particular, when I went up  to turn in for our last night--and I happened to look out of my window.  In point of fact, I wanted to see whether the one below was open, and  whether there was the slightest chance of working the oracle with my  sheet for a rope.  Of course I took the precaution of turning my light  off first, and it was a lucky thing I did.  I saw the pros. right down  below, and they never saw me.  I saw a little tiny luminous disk just  for an instant, and then again for an instant a few minutes later.  Of  course I knew what it was, for I have my own watch-dial daubed with  luminous paint; it makes a lantern of sorts when you can get no better.  But these fellows were not using theirs as a lantern.  They were under  the old lady's window.  They were watching the time.  The whole thing  was arranged with their accomplice inside.  Set a thief to catch a  thief: in a minute I had guessed what the whole thing proved to be.\"    \"And you did nothing!\" I exclaimed.    \"On the contrary, I went downstairs and straight into Lady Melrose's  room--\"    \"You did?\"    \"Without a moment's hesitation.  To save her jewels.  And I was  prepared to yell as much into her ear-trumpet for all the house to  hear.  But the dear lady is too deaf and too fond of her dinner to wake  easily.\"    \"Well?\"    \"She didn't stir.\"    \"And yet you allowed the professors, as you call them, to take her  jewels, case and all!\"    \"All but this,\" said Raffles, thrusting his fist into my lap.  \"I would  have shown it you before, but really, old fellow, your face all day has  been worth a fortune to the firm!\"    And he opened his fist, to shut it next instant on the bunch of  diamonds and of sapphires that I had last seen encircling the neck of  Lady Melrose.        LE PREMIER PAS    That night he told me the story of his earliest crime.  Not since the  fateful morning of the Ides of March, when he had just mentioned it as  an unreported incident of a certain cricket tour, had I succeeded in  getting a word out of Raffles on the subject.  It was not for want of  trying; he would shake his head, and watch his cigarette smoke  thoughtfully; a subtle look in his eyes, half cynical, half wistful, as  though the decent honest days that were no more had had their merits  after all.  Raffles would plan a fresh enormity, or glory in the last,  with the unmitigated enthusiasm of the artist.  It was impossible to  imagine one throb or twitter of compunction beneath those frankly  egotistic and infectious transports.  And yet the ghost of a dead  remorse seemed still to visit him with the memory of his first felony,  so that I had given the story up long before the night of our return  from Milchester.  Cricket, however, was in the air, and Raffles's  cricket-bag back where he sometimes kept it, in the fender, with the  remains of an Orient label still adhering to the leather.  My eyes had  been on this label for some time, and I suppose his eyes had been on  mine, for all at once he asked me if I still burned to hear that yarn.    \"It's no use,\" I replied.  \"You won't spin it. I must imagine it for  myself.\"    \"How can you?\"    \"Oh, I begin to know your methods.\"    \"You take it I went in with my eyes open, as I do now, eh?\"    \"I can't imagine your doing otherwise.\"    \"My dear Bunny, it was the most unpremeditated thing I ever did in my  life!\"    His chair wheeled back into the books as he sprang up with sudden  energy.  There was quite an indignant glitter in his eyes.    \"I can't believe that,\" said I craftily.  \"I can't pay you such a poor  compliment!\"    \"Then you must be a fool--\"    He broke off, stared hard at me, and in a trice stood smiling in his  own despite.    \"Or a better knave than I thought you, Bunny, and by Jove it's the  knave!  Well--I suppose I'm fairly drawn; I give you best, as they say  out there.  As a matter of fact I've been thinking of the thing myself;  last night's racket reminds me of it in one or two respects.  I tell  you what, though, this is an occasion in any case, and I'm going to  celebrate it by breaking the one good rule of my life.  I'm going to  have a second drink!\"    The whiskey tinkled, the syphon fizzed, the ice plopped home; and  seated there in his pyjamas, with the inevitable cigarette, Raffles  told me the story that I had given up hoping to hear.  The windows were  wide open; the sounds of Piccadilly floated in at first.  Long before  he finished, the last wheels had rattled, the last brawler was removed,  we alone broke the quiet of the summer night.      \"... No, they do you very well, indeed. You pay for nothing but drinks,  so to speak, but I'm afraid mine were of a comprehensive character.  I  had started in a hole, I ought really to have refused the invitation;  then we all went to the Melbourne Cup, and I had the certain winner  that didn't win, and that's not the only way you can play the fool in  Melbourne.  I wasn't the steady old stager I am now, Bunny; my analysis  was a confession in itself.  But the others didn't know how hard up I  was, and I swore they shouldn't.  I tried the Jews, but they're extra  fly out there. Then I thought of a kinsman of sorts, a second cousin of  my father's whom none of us knew anything about, except that he was  supposed to be in one or other of the Colonies.  If he was a rich man,  well and good, I would work him; if not there would be no harm done.  I  tried to get on his tracks, and, as luck would have it, I succeeded (or  thought I had) at the very moment when I happened to have a few days to  myself.  I was cut over on the hand, just before the big Christmas  match, and couldn't have bowled a ball if they had played me.    \"The surgeon who fixed me up happened to ask me if I was any relation  of Raffles of the National Bank, and the pure luck of it almost took my  breath away.  A relation who was a high official in one of the banks,  who would finance me on my mere name--could anything be better?  I made  up my mind that this Raffles was the man I wanted, and was awfully sold  to find next moment that he wasn't a high official at all.  Nor had the  doctor so much as met him, but had merely read of him in connection  with a small sensation at the suburban branch which my namesake  managed; an armed robber had been rather pluckily beaten off, with a  bullet in him, by this Raffles; and the sort of thing was so common out  there that this was the first I had heard of it!  A suburban branch--my  financier had faded into some excellent fellow with a billet to lose if  he called his soul his own. Still a manager was a manager, and I"]]]
