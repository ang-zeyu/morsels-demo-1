Say that, certainly; I consider the old man's rebuke quite  reasonable.    _Ly_. So do I. But I am not so sure you will approve what comes  next; as for me, I have as little doubt of that as of the other.    _Her_. What is it?    _Ly_. The next step will be the application; my questioner will say,  _Now Lycinus, let us suppose an analogue, in a person acquainted only  with the Stoic doctrine, like your friend Hermotimus; he has never  travelled in Plato's country, or to Epicurus, or any other land; now, if  he were to state that there was no such beauty or truth in those many  countries as there is in the Porch and its teaching, would you not be  justified in considering it bold of him to give you his opinion about  them all, whereas he knew only one, having never set foot outside the  bounds of Ethiopia?_ What reply do you advise to that?    _Her_. The perfectly true one, of course, that it is indeed the Stoic  doctrine that we study fully, being minded to sink or swim with that, but  still we do know what the others say also; our teacher rehearses the  articles of their beliefs to us incidentally, and demolishes them with his  comments.    _Ly_. Do you suppose the Platonists, Pythagoreans, Epicureans, and  other schools, will let that pass? or will they laugh out loud and say,  _What remarkable methods your friend has, Lycinus! he accepts our  adversaries' character of us, and gathers our doctrines from the  description of people who do not know, or deliberately misrepresent them.  If he were to see an athlete getting his muscles in trim by kicking high,  or hitting out at empty space as though he were getting a real blow home,  would he (in the capacity of umpire) at once proclaim him victor, because  he _could not help winning_? No; _he would reflect that these displays are  easy and safe, when there is no defence to be reckoned with, and that the  real decision must wait till he has beaten and mastered his opponent, and  the latter 'has had enough'. Well then, do not let Hermotimus suppose from  his teachers' sparrings with our shadows (for _we_ are not there) that  they have the victory, or that our doctrines are so easily upset; tell him  the business is too like the sand houses which children, having built them  weak, have no difficulty in overturning, or, to change the figure, like  people practising archery; they make a straw target, hang it to a post,  plant it a little way off, and then let fly at it; if they hit and get  through the straw, they burst into a shout, as if it were a great triumph  to have driven through the dry stuff. That is not the way the Persians  take, or those Scythian tribes which use the bow. Generally, when _they_  shoot, in the first place they are themselves mounted and in motion, and  secondly, they like the mark to be moving too; it is not to be stationary,  waiting for the arrival of the arrow, but passing at full speed; they can  usually kill beasts, and their marksmen hit birds. If it ever happens that  they want to test the actual impact on a target, they set up one of stout  wood, or a shield of raw hide; piercing that, they reckon that their  shafts will go through armour too. So, Lycinus, tell Hermotimus from us  that his teachers fierce straw targets, and then say they have disposed of  armed men; or paint up figures of us, spar at them, and, after a not  surprising success, think they have beaten us. But we shall severally  quote against them Achilles's words against Hector:      They dare not face the nodding of my plume._    So say all of them, one after the other.    I suspect that Plato, with his intimate knowledge of Sicily, will add an  anecdote from there. Gelo of Syracuse had disagreeable breath, but did  not find it out himself for a long time, no one venturing to mention such  a circumstance to a tyrant. At last a foreign woman who had a connexion  with him dared to tell him; whereupon he went to his wife and scolded her  for never having, with all her opportunities of knowing, warned him of  it; she put in the defence that, as she had never been familiar or at  close quarters with any other man, she had supposed all men were like  that. So Hermotinus (Plato will say) after his exclusive association with  Stoics, cannot be expected to know the savour of other people's mouths.  Chrysippus, on the other hand, might say as much or more if I were to put  _him_ out of court and betake myself to Platonism, in reliance upon  some one who had conversed with Plato alone. And in a word, as long as it  is uncertain which is the true philosophic school, I choose none; choice  of one is insult to the rest.    _Her_. For Heaven's sake, Lycinus, let us leave Plato, Aristotle,  Epicurus, and the rest of them alone; to argue with them is not for me.  Why not just hold a private inquiry, you and I, whether philosophy is  what I say it is? As for the Ethiopians and Gelo's wife, what a long way  you have brought them on none of their business!    _Ly_. Away with them, then, if you find their company superfluous.  And now do you proceed; my expectations are high.    _Her_. Well, it seems to me perfectly possible, Lycinus, after  studying the Stoic doctrines alone, to get at the truth from them,  without going through a course of all the others too. Look at it this  way: if any one tells you simply, Twice two is four, need you go round  all the mathematicians to find out whether there is one who makes it  five, or seven; or would you know at once that the man was right?    _Ly_. Certainly I should.    _Her_. Then why should you think it impossible for a man who finds,  without going further, that the Stoics make true statements, to believe  them and dispense with further witness? He knows that four can never be  five, though ten thousand Platos or Pythagorases said it was.    _Ly_. Not to the point. You compare accepted with disputed facts,  whereas they are completely different. Tell me, did you ever meet a man  who said twice two was seven or eleven?    _Her_. Not I; any one who did not make four of it must be mad.    _Ly_. But on the other hand--try to tell the truth, I adjure you--,  did you ever meet a Stoic and an Epicurean who did _not_ differ  about principles or ends?    _Her_. No.    _Ly_. You are an honest man; now ask yourself whether you are trapping a  friend with false logic. We are trying to find out with whom philosophic  truth lies; and you beg the question and make a present of that same truth  to the Stoics; for you say (what is quite unproved) that they are the  people who make twice two four; the Epicureans or Platonists would say  that _they_ bring out that result, whereas you get five or seven. Does it  not amount to that, when your school reckon goodness the only end, and the  Epicureans pleasure? or again when you say everything is material, and  Plato recognizes an immaterial element also in all that exists? As I said,  you lay hold of the thing in dispute, as though it were the admitted  property of the Stoics, and put it into their hands, though the others  claim it and maintain that it is theirs; why, it is the very point at  issue. If it is once established that Stoics have the monopoly of making  four out of twice two, it is time for the rest to hold their tongues; but  as long as they refuse to yield that point, we must hear all alike, or be  prepared for people's calling us partial judges.    _Her_. It seems to me, Lycinus, you do not understand what I mean.    _Ly_. Very well, put it plainer, if it is something different from that.    _Her_. You will see in a minute. Let us suppose two people have gone  into the temple of Asclepius or Dionysus, and subsequently one of the  sacred cups is missing. Both of them will have to be searched, to see  which has it about him.    _Ly_. Clearly.    _Her_. Of course one of them has it.    _Ly_. Necessarily, if it is missing.    _Her_. Then, if you find it on the first, you will not strip the other; it  is clear he has not got it.    _Ly_. Quite.    _Her_. And if we fail to find it on the first, the other certainly has it;  it is unnecessary to search him that way either.    _Ly_. Yes, he has it.    _Her_. So with us; if we find the cup in the possession of the Stoics, we  shall not care to go on and search the others; we have what we were  looking for; why trouble further?    _Ly_. There is no why, if you really find it, and can be certain it  is the missing article, the sacred object being unmistakable. But there  are some differences in this case, friend, the temple-visitors are not  two, so that if one has not got the booty the other has, but many; and  the identity of the missing object is also uncertain; it may be cup, or  bowl, or garland; every priest gives a different description of it; they  do not agree even about the material; bronze, say these, silver, say  those--anything from gold to tin. So there is nothing for it but to strip  the visitors, if you want to find it; even if you discover a gold cup on  the first man, you must go on to the others.    _Her_. What for?    _Ly_. Because it is not certain that the thing was a cup. And even if that  is generally admitted, they do not all agree that it was gold; and if it  is well known that a gold cup is missing, and you find a gold cup on your  first man, even so you are not quit of searching the others; it is not  clear that this is _the_ sacred cup; do you suppose there is only one gold  cup in the world?    _Her_. No, indeed.    _Ly_. So you will have to go the round, and then collect all your finds  together and decide which of them is most likely to be divine property.    For the source of all the difficulty is this: every one who is stripped  has something or other on him, one a bowl, one a cup, one a garland,  which again may be bronze, gold, or silver; but whether the one he has is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6593"],[0,"History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (#12)"],[1,"constituted, the demands of  a married state, and the care of posterity, require some little regard  to what we call circumstances. Yet this provision is greatly  increased, beyond what is really necessary, by folly and vanity, which  create abundantly more wants than nature. Equipage for the wife, and  large fortunes for the children, are by custom enrolled in the list of  necessaries; and to procure these, everything truly solid and sweet,  and virtuous and religious, are neglected and overlooked.    \"And this in many degrees; the last and greatest of which seems scarce  distinguishable from madness;--I mean where persons of immense  fortunes contract themselves to those who are, and must be,  disagreeable to them--to fools and knaves--in order to increase an  estate already larger even than the demands of their pleasures. Surely  such persons, if they will not be thought mad, must own, either that  they are incapable of tasting the sweets of the tenderest friendship,  or that they sacrifice the greatest happiness of which they are  capable to the vain, uncertain, and senseless laws of vulgar opinion,  which owe as well their force as their foundation to folly.\"    Here Allworthy concluded his sermon, to which Blifil had listened with  the profoundest attention, though it cost him some pains to prevent  now and then a small discomposure of his muscles. He now praised every  period of what he had heard with the warmth of a young divine, who  hath the honour to dine with a bishop the same day in which his  lordship hath mounted the pulpit.        Chapter xiii.    Which concludes the first book; with an instance of ingratitude,  which, we hope, will appear unnatural.      The reader, from what hath been said, may imagine that the  reconciliation (if indeed it could be so called) was only matter of  form; we shall therefore pass it over, and hasten to what must surely  be thought matter of substance.    The doctor had acquainted his brother with what had past between Mr  Allworthy and him; and added with a smile, \"I promise you I paid you  off; nay, I absolutely desired the good gentleman not to forgive you:  for you know after he had made a declaration in your favour, I might  with safety venture on such a request with a person of his temper; and  I was willing, as well for your sake as for my own, to prevent the  least possibility of a suspicion.\"    Captain Blifil took not the least notice of this, at that time; but he  afterwards made a very notable use of it.    One of the maxims which the devil, in a late visit upon earth, left to  his disciples, is, when once you are got up, to kick the stool from  under you. In plain English, when you have made your fortune by the  good offices of a friend, you are advised to discard him as soon as  you can.    Whether the captain acted by this maxim, I will not positively  determine: so far we may confidently say, that his actions may be  fairly derived from this diabolical principle; and indeed it is  difficult to assign any other motive to them: for no sooner was he  possessed of Miss Bridget, and reconciled to Allworthy, than he began  to show a coldness to his brother which increased daily; till at  length it grew into rudeness, and became very visible to every one.    The doctor remonstrated to him privately concerning this behaviour,  but could obtain no other satisfaction than the following plain  declaration: \"If you dislike anything in my brother's house, sir, you  know you are at liberty to quit it.\" This strange, cruel, and almost  unaccountable ingratitude in the captain, absolutely broke the poor  doctor's heart; for ingratitude never so thoroughly pierces the human  breast as when it proceeds from those in whose behalf we have been  guilty of transgressions. Reflections on great and good actions,  however they are received or returned by those in whose favour they  are performed, always administer some comfort to us; but what  consolation shall we receive under so biting a calamity as the  ungrateful behaviour of our friend, when our wounded conscience at the  same time flies in our face, and upbraids us with having spotted it in  the service of one so worthless!    Mr Allworthy himself spoke to the captain in his brother's behalf, and  desired to know what offence the doctor had committed; when the  hard-hearted villain had the baseness to say that he should never  forgive him for the injury which he had endeavoured to do him in his  favour; which, he said, he had pumped out of him, and was such a  cruelty that it ought not to be forgiven.    Allworthy spoke in very high terms upon this declaration, which, he  said, became not a human creature. He expressed, indeed, so much  resentment against an unforgiving temper, that the captain at last  pretended to be convinced by his arguments, and outwardly professed to  be reconciled.    As for the bride, she was now in her honeymoon, and so passionately  fond of her new husband that he never appeared to her to be in the  wrong; and his displeasure against any person was a sufficient reason  for her dislike to the same.    The captain, at Mr Allworthy's instance, was outwardly, as we have  said, reconciled to his brother; yet the same rancour remained in his  heart; and he found so many opportunities of giving him private hints  of this, that the house at last grew insupportable to the poor doctor;  and he chose rather to submit to any inconveniences which he might  encounter in the world, than longer to bear these cruel and ungrateful  insults from a brother for whom he had done so much.    He once intended to acquaint Allworthy with the whole; but he could  not bring himself to submit to the confession, by which he must take  to his share so great a portion of guilt. Besides, by how much the  worse man he represented his brother to be, so much the greater would  his own offence appear to Allworthy, and so much the greater, he had  reason to imagine, would be his resentment.    He feigned, therefore, some excuse of business for his departure, and  promised to return soon again; and took leave of his brother with so  well-dissembled content, that, as the captain played his part to the  same perfection, Allworthy remained well satisfied with the truth of  the reconciliation.    The doctor went directly to London, where he died soon after of a  broken heart; a distemper which kills many more than is generally  imagined, and would have a fair title to a place in the bill of  mortality, did it not differ in one instance from all other  diseases--viz., that no physician can cure it.    Now, upon the most diligent enquiry into the former lives of these two  brothers, I find, besides the cursed and hellish maxim of policy above  mentioned, another reason for the captain's conduct: the captain,  besides what we have before said of him, was a man of great pride and  fierceness, and had always treated his brother, who was of a different  complexion, and greatly deficient in both these qualities, with the  utmost air of superiority. The doctor, however, had much the larger  share of learning, and was by many reputed to have the better  understanding. This the captain knew, and could not bear; for though  envy is at best a very malignant passion, yet is its bitterness  greatly heightened by mixing with contempt towards the same object;  and very much afraid I am, that whenever an obligation is joined to  these two, indignation and not gratitude will be the product of all  three.          BOOK II.    CONTAINING SCENES OF MATRIMONIAL FELICITY IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF  LIFE; AND VARIOUS OTHER TRANSACTIONS DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS AFTER  THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN CAPTAIN BLIFIL AND MISS BRIDGET ALLWORTHY.        Chapter i.    Showing what kind of a history this is; what it is like, and what it  is not like.      Though we have properly enough entitled this our work, a history, and  not a life; nor an apology for a life, as is more in fashion; yet we  intend in it rather to pursue the method of those writers, who profess  to disclose the revolutions of countries, than to imitate the painful  and voluminous historian, who, to preserve the regularity of his  series, thinks himself obliged to fill up as much paper with the  detail of months and years in which nothing remarkable happened, as he  employs upon those notable aeras when the greatest scenes have been  transacted on the human stage.    Such histories as these do, in reality, very much resemble a  newspaper, which consists of just the same number of words, whether  there be any news in it or not. They may likewise be compared to a  stage coach, which performs constantly the same course, empty as well  as full. The writer, indeed, seems to think himself obliged to keep  even pace with time, whose amanuensis he is; and, like his master,  travels as slowly through centuries of monkish dulness, when the world  seems to have been asleep, as through that bright and busy age so  nobly distinguished by the excellent Latin poet--         _Ad confligendum venientibus undique poenis,       Omnia cum belli trepido concussa tumultu       Horrida contremuere sub altis aetheris auris;       In dubioque fuit sub utrorum regna cadendum       Omnibus humanis esset, terraque marique._    Of which we wish we could give our readers a more adequate translation  than that by Mr Creech--         When dreadful Carthage frighted Rome with arms,       And all the world was shook with fierce alarms;       Whilst undecided yet, which part should fall,       Which nation rise the glorious lord of all.    Now it is our purpose, in the ensuing pages, to pursue a contrary  method. When any extraordinary scene presents itself (as we trust will  often be the case), we shall spare no pains nor paper to open it at  large to our reader; but if whole years should pass without producing  anything worthy his notice, we shall not be afraid of a chasm in our  history; but shall hasten on to matters of consequence,"]]]
