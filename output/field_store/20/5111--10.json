Another measure which I have supported is that of the arming of all  British civilians, for reasons already enumerated. An essential to the  measure being successful, being loyally supported, is that, on the Boer  model, the officers of the corps should be elected by their men. British  colonists, with their traditions of liberty and independence, will never  submit to being compulsorily placed on military service and subjected to  the orders of officers whom they have not chosen.    No measure of greater political moment can be taken than the thorough  organising of a system of education, from the university to the school.  I am one of those who support the making of the Gold Reef city a great  university centre.    As regards the Native Law, I advocate as little as possible alteration  in the laws already in force. The Boer theory of the position of the  Kaffir--as not an equal, but entitled to justice, under tutelage to a  government directed by European ideals--is the sound one.[2]    Asiatic immigration in any form, whether of British Indians from India,  or Chinese from Hong-Kong or elsewhere, would be a measure fraught with  disaster to the future of European civilisation. With the exception of  some employers of labour in Rhodesia and Natal, South African  opinion--British, Boer, even Kaffir--is opposed to Asiatic immigration.  Even the employers referred to only desire to encourage the importation  of Asiatics as manual labourers, not as owners of the land or traders in  the towns.    FOOTNOTES:    [2] In the _Fortnightly Review_, August 1902. Ideal with this subject:  \"Negrophilism in South Africa.\"          THE AFRICANDER PARTY    ITS ORIGIN, ITS GROWTH, ITS AIMS    BY THE HON. A. WILMOT    _Member of the Legislative Council, Cape Colony; Author of \"History of  Our Own Times in South Africa,\" &c., &c._      One of the greatest statesmen whose experience and ability have assisted  the Imperial Government declares that it was only after two years'  residence that he understood the political problems affecting South  Africa. Hundreds rush in where Milners fear to tread, and the little  knowledge which induces superficial views and rash judgment on a merely  _prim√¢ facie_ case are now at present, as they have been in the past,  among the causes which impede the progress of a vast country which we  hope will yet become a great federated dominion under the British crown.    It is because of the vital importance of going to the root of the  political questions affecting South Africa that this paper is written.    The origin of the Africander party is traceable principally to  discontent with British rule. The Cape Colony, as our readers know, was  obtained by conquest in 1806, and by purchase from the Netherlands for  six million pounds sterling in the year 1814. Mr. Paul M. Botha, Member  of the Orange Free State Volksraad for Kroonstadt, states the case from  the Dutchman's point of view, and tells us that as England said that  South Africa was her country she ought to have governed it, instead of  which she shirked responsibilities and was guilty of the most glaring  inconsistencies. One day England blew hot and the next cold. \"One moment  she insisted on swallowing us, and the next moment she insisted on  disgorging us.\" For example, the Orange Free State was declared British  territory because a governor said, \"You can never escape British  jurisdiction.\" Then we were abandoned because the next governor said,  \"The country was a howling wilderness.\" The Transvaal was annexed, and  Sir Garnet Wolseley declared: \"The rivers will sooner run back in their  courses than that England will give back the Transvaal.\" Shortly after  that the Transvaal was retroceded, after Majuba, because the British  Ministry said, \"We have been unjust in annexing this country.\"[3]    The slavery question, Mr. Botha tells us, was handled with astounding  negligence and ignorance of the circumstances of the people. Although  England was perfectly right in emancipating the slaves, yet the way it  was done irritated, annoyed, and disgusted the people, and sowed seeds  of distrust which have never been eradicated. England failed to carry  out effectively her promises of compensation.    On the minor grievances, such as Slagter's Nek and other so-called  injustices of England, Mr. Botha lays no stress. \"It was a rough period,  and rough measures were used by all Governments.\" He significantly adds  that what he has heard of the cruelty of the Dutch East India Company's  officials makes him think that anyhow British rule was heaven to that of  the Dutch. Whatever a well-educated man like Mr. Botha may say, we know  that the rank and file of the Dutch throughout South Africa are taught  to \"Remember Slagter's Nek.\" Nothing can be more unjust than to blame  the British power for executing rebels, caught red-handed and sentenced  to death in perfect accord with both evidence and law by a competent  Court, whose members were themselves of Dutch extraction. Nevertheless  this is one of the heavy popular grievances.    Mr. Botha says that England's weak and spasmodic policy in South Africa  has made the Boer what he is to-day--distrustful and contemptuous of  British statesmen. By further receding into the interior, and having to  fight wild beasts and hordes of Kaffirs, the Boer became blown out with  vanity at his own prowess, and more and more ignorant. Through this  ignorance it is easier to mislead than to lead him. A man who plays upon  his vanity and prejudices against England quickly obtains influence. A  loud talker and blusterer gets a better hearing than a quiet reasoner.  \"I ascribe this to want of education and complete isolation on the  veldt.\"    As a marked illustration in support of Mr. Botha's view which has come  under the present writer's observation, let us tell what occurred  shortly before the war to a nephew of the Speaker of the House of  Assembly who had to travel through the Transvaal to look after some  landed property. This gentleman, who spoke the Taal perfectly, met at  one place about two dozen Dutchmen who were, like the Laird of Cockpen,  \"greatly ta'en up with the 'fairs of the State.\" The first question,  \"Can we beat the British?\" was answered by a unanimous \"Yes, we have  done so before, and can, of course, easily do so again.\" Second. \"Tell  me, Carls, could we beat England and France united?\" \"Certainly,\" said  every one, \"there can be no doubt about it.\" But now interposed a new  speaker. \"How if we had to fight England, France, and Germany?\" The  reply was unanimous. \"We can beat them all three.\" No wonder that the  people of the Lord, as they believed themselves to be, took the bit  between their teeth at the time of the ultimatum. Not even Paul Kruger  could then have stopped the war, for they felt perfectly assured of  victory.    With a religion which has not unfitly been described as a superstition  based upon the Old Testament, there is profound ignorance accompanied by  prejudice of the most deep-rooted character. Mr. Botha tells us that  unfortunately the ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church, \"greedy for  the fat lamb, the fowl, and the purse,\" foster this ignorance. One  Predikant had actually the audacity to tell his congregation that God  _must_ help His chosen people, otherwise He would lose His influence.    Mr. Botha defends his own people against charges of treachery, and gives  it as his fixed opinion that a just and firm Government with uniformity  of treatment will not only control and satisfy the Boers, but eradicate  in time that feeling of distrust and fear which was engendered in their  minds by the halting and unequal policy of England. He admits at the  same time that it is to Britain that they owe peace, and that it was  Britain that protected them from foreign invasion and saved them from  continual civil strife. Then comes most important evidence. President  Brand of the Free State recognised in the misgoverned Transvaal a subtle  enemy. Indeed, it is scarcely remembered that in 1857 the burghers of  the South African Republic invaded the Orange Free State territory and  declared that it belonged to them. Paul Kruger was subsequently raised  up, in the opinion of his followers, to be a Moses, whose mission was to  deliver \"De Africander Natie\" from British bondage. Mr. Botha asks us to  let him tear this veil of false romance away. \"We know him,\" he tells  us, \"as an avaricious, unscrupulous, and hypocritical man, who  sacrificed a whole people to his cupidity.\" Krugerism spread over South  Africa, using the Bond, the press, and the pulpit to further its  schemes.    [Illustration: AT THE HEAD OF UMGENI FALLS, HOWICK, NATAL.]    Let it be fully understood--the Bond was the _fons_ and _origo_ of the  South African war--Krugerism powerfully co-operating. The idea of the  Africander Bond took root at the Paarl in the Cape Colony in the years  1879 and 1880. Of course, as we have seen, there was abundant  preparation, but events in the Transvaal hastened proceedings.  Enthusiastic, educated men, such as Reitz, Te Water, and the students of  the Theological Seminary at Stellenbosch felt patriotic desires wildly  coursing in their veins, but the honour of formulating a definite  plan of organisation belongs to the Rev. S. J. du Toit, who then edited  _De Patriot_ newspaper at the Paarl. _De Transvaalse Oorlag_ was  published by Messrs. D. T. du Toit & Co. of the Paarl in the year 1881.  It was the retrocession of the Transvaal under the direction of Mr.  Gladstone in the last-mentioned year that enabled the Bond to assume a  very definite shape, and to obtain immense and widespread power.    Carl Borckenhagen, editor of the _Bloemfontein Express_, and F. W.  Reitz, who succeeded Sir J. Brand as President of the Orange Free State,  and was subsequently State Secretary of the Transvaal, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#12)"],[1," factors.  And inasmuch as he was now Derwent Conniston and no longer John Keith,  he took the logical point of arguing that the affair was none of his  business, and that he could go on to the mountains if he pleased. Only  in that direction could he see ice of a sane and perfect thickness, to  carry out the metaphor in his head. He could report indifferently to  McDowell, forget Miss Kirkstone, and disappear from the menace of Shan  Tung's eyes. John Keith, he repeated, would be officially dead, and  being dead, the law would have no further interest in him.    He prodded himself on with this thought as he fumbled his way through  darkness down into town. Miriam Kirkstone in her golden way was  alluring; the mystery that shadowed the big house on the hill was  fascinating to his hunting instincts; he had the desire, growing fast,  to come at grips with Shan Tung. But he had not foreseen these things,  and neither had Conniston foreseen them. They had planned only for the  salvation of John Keith's precious neck, and tonight he had almost  forgotten the existence of that unpleasant reality, the hangman. Truth  settled upon him with depressing effect, and an infinite loneliness  turned his mind again to the mountains of his dreams.    The town was empty of life. Lights glowed here and there through the  mist; now and then a door opened; down near the river a dog howled  forlornly. Everything was shut against him. There were no longer homes  where he might call and be greeted with a cheery \"Good evening, Keith.  Glad to see you. Come in out of the wet.\" He could not even go to  Duggan, his old river friend. He realized now that his old friends were  the very ones he must avoid most carefully to escape self-betrayal.  Friendship no longer existed for him; the town was a desert without an  oasis where he might reclaim some of the things he had lost. Memories  he had treasured gave place to bitter ones. His own townfolk, of all  people, were his readiest enemies, and his loneliness clutched him  tighter, until the air itself seemed thick and difficult to breathe.  For the time Derwent Conniston was utterly submerged in the  overwhelming yearnings of John Keith.    He dropped into a dimly lighted shop to purchase a box of cigars. It  was deserted except for the proprietor. His elbow bumped into a  telephone. He would call up Wallie and tell him to have a good fire  waiting for him, and in the company of that fire he would do a lot of  thinking before getting into communication with McDowell.    It was not Wallie who answered him, and he was about to apologize for  getting the wrong number when the voice at the other end asked,    \"Is that you, Conniston?\"    It was McDowell. The discovery gave him a distinct shock. What could  the Inspector be doing up at the Shack in his absence? Besides, there  was an imperative demand in the question that shot at him over the  wire. McDowell had half shouted it.    \"Yes, it's I,\" he said rather feebly.    \"I'm down-town, stocking up on some cigars. What's the excitement?\"    \"Don't ask questions but hustle up here,\" McDowell fired back. \"I've  got the surprise of your life waiting for you!\"    Keith heard the receiver at the other end go up with a bang. Something  had happened at the Shack, and McDowell was excited. He went out  puzzled. For some reason he was in no great hurry to reach the top of  the hill. He was beginning to expect things to happen--too many  things--and in the stress of the moment he felt the incongruity of the  friendly box of cigars tucked under his arm. The hardest luck he had  ever run up against had never quite killed his sense of humor, and he  chuckled. His fortunes were indeed at a low ebb when he found a bit of  comfort in hugging a box of cigars still closer.    He could see that every room in the Shack was lighted, when he came to  the crest of the slope, but the shades were drawn. He wondered if  Wallie had pulled down the curtains, or if it was a caution on  McDowell's part against possible espionage. Suspicion made him transfer  the box of cigars to his left arm so that his right was free. Somewhere  in the darkness Conniston's voice was urging him, as it had urged him  up in the cabin on the Barren: \"Don't walk into a noose. If it comes to  a fight, FIGHT!\"    And then something happened that brought his heart to a dead stop. He  was close to the door. His ear was against it. And he was listening to  a voice. It was not Wallie's, and it was not the iron man's. It was a  woman's voice, or a girl's.    He opened the door and entered, taking swiftly the two or three steps  that carried him across the tiny vestibule to the big room. His  entrance was so sudden that the tableau in front of him was unbroken  for a moment. Birch logs were blazing in the fireplace. In the big  chair sat McDowell, partly turned, a smoking cigar poised in his  fingers, staring at him. Seated on a footstool, with her chin in the  cup of her hands, was a girl. At first, blinded a little by the light,  Keith thought she was a child, a remarkably pretty child with  wide-open, half-startled eyes and a wonderful crown of glowing, brown  hair in which he could still see the shimmer of wet. He took off his  hat and brushed the water from his eyes. McDowell did not move. Slowly  the girl rose to her feet. It was then that Keith saw she was not a  child. Perhaps she was eighteen, a slim, tired-looking, little thing,  wonderfully pretty, and either on the verge of laughing or crying.  Perhaps it was halfway between. To his growing discomfiture she came  slowly toward him with a strange and wonderful look in her face. And  McDowell still sat there staring.    His heart thumped with an emotion he had no time to question. In those  wide-open, shining eyes of the girl he sensed unspeakable tragedy--for  him. And then the girl's arms were reaching out to him, and she was  crying in that voice that trembled and broke between sobs and laughter:    \"Derry, don't you know me? Don't you know me?\"    He stood like one upon whom had fallen the curse of the dumb. She was  within arm's reach of him, her face white as a cameo, her eyes glowing  like newly-fired stars, her slim throat quivering, and her arms  reaching toward him.    \"Derry, don't you know me? DON'T YOU KNOW ME?\"    It was a sob, a cry. McDowell had risen. Overwhelmingly there swept  upon Keith an impulse that rocked him to the depth of his soul. He  opened his arms, and in an instant the girl was in them. Quivering, and  sobbing, and laughing she was on his breast. He felt the crush of her  soft hair against his face, her arms were about his neck, and she was  pulling his head down and kissing him--not once or twice, but again and  again, passionately and without shame. His own arms tightened. He heard  McDowell's voice--a distant and non-essential voice it seemed to him  now--saying that he would leave them alone and that he would see them  again tomorrow. He heard the door open and close. McDowell was gone.  And the soft little arms were still tight about his neck. The sweet  crush of hair smothered his face, and on his breast she was crying now  like a baby. He held her closer. A wild exultation seized upon him, and  every fiber in his body responded to its thrill, as tautly-stretched  wires respond to an electrical storm. It passed swiftly, burning itself  out, and his heart was left dead. He heard a sound made by Wallie out  in the kitchen. He saw the walls of the room again, the chair in which  McDowell had sat, the blazing fire. His arms relaxed. The girl raised  her head and put her two hands to his face, looking at him with eyes  which Keith no longer failed to recognize. They were the eyes that had  looked at him out of the faded picture in Conniston's watch.    \"Kiss me, Derry!\"    It was impossible not to obey. Her lips clung to him. There was love,  adoration, in their caress.    And then she was crying again, with her arms around him tight and her  face hidden against him, and he picked her up as he would have lifted a  child, and carried her to the big chair in front of the fire. He put  her in it and stood before her, trying to smile. Her hair had loosened,  and the shining mass of it had fallen about her face and to her  shoulders. She was more than ever like a little girl as she looked up  at him, her eyes worshiping him, her lips trying to smile, and one  little hand dabbing her eyes with a tiny handkerchief that was already  wet and crushed.    \"You--you don't seem very glad to see me, Derry.\"    \"I--I'm just stunned,\" he managed to say. \"You see--\"    \"It IS a shocking surprise, Derry. I meant it to be. I've been planning  it for years and years and YEARS! Please take off your coat--it's  dripping wet!--and sit down near me, on that stool!\"    Again he obeyed. He was big for the stool.    \"You are glad to see me, aren't you, Derry?\"    She was leaning over the edge of the big chair, and one of her hands  went to his damp hair, brushing it back. It was a wonderful touch. He  had never felt anything like it before in his life, and involuntarily  he bent his head a little. In a moment she had hugged it up close to  her.    \"You ARE glad, aren't you, Derry? Say 'yes.'\"    \"Yes,\" he whispered.    He could feel the swift, excited beating of her heart.    \"And I'm never going back again--to THEM,\" he heard her say, something  suddenly low and fierce in her voice. \"NEVER! I'm going to stay with  you always, Derry. Always!\"    She put her lips close to his ear and whispered mysteriously. \"They  don't know where I am. Maybe they think I'm dead. But Colonel  Reppington knows. I told him I was coming if I had to walk round the  world to get here. He said he'd keep my secret, and gave me letters to  some awfully nice people over here. I've been over six months. And when  I saw your name in one of those dry-looking, blue-covered, paper books  the Mounted Police get out, I just dropped down on my knees and thanked  the"]]]
