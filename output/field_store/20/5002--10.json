Forster entered into an agreement  with him for the English copyright of his compositions, and between  1781 and 1787 he published eighty-two symphonies, twenty-four quartets,  twenty-four solos, duets and trios, and the \"Seven Last Words,\" of which  we have yet to speak. Nothing of the Forster correspondence seems to  have survived.    Royal Dedicatees    Among the events of 1781-1782 should be noted the entertainments given  in connection with two visits which the Emperor Joseph II received from  the Grand Duke Paul and his wife. The Grand Duchess was musical, and had  just been present at the famous combat between Clementi and Mozart, a  suggestion of the Emperor. She had some of Haydn's quartets played at  her house and liked them so well that she gave him a diamond snuff-box  and took lessons from him. It was to her that he afterwards--in  1802--dedicated his part-songs for three and four voices, while the  Grand Duke was honoured by the dedication of the six so-called \"Russian\"  quartets. It had been arranged that the Duke and Duchess should  accompany the Emperor to Eisenstadt, but the arrangement fell through,  and an opera which Haydn had written for the occasion was only produced  at Esterhaz in the autumn of 1782. This was his \"Orlando Paladino,\"  better known in its German form as \"Ritter Roland.\" Another work of this  year (1782) was the \"Mariazell\" Mass in C major (Novello, No. 15), which  derives its name from the shrine of the Virgin in Styria, the scene  of an incident already related. The mass was written to the order of a  certain Herr Liebe de Kreutzner, and the composer is said to have taken  special pains with it, perhaps because it reminded him of his early  struggling days as a chorister in Vienna. It was the eighth mass Haydn  had written, one being the long and difficult \"Cecilia\" Mass in C  major, now heard only in a curtailed form. No other work of the kind was  composed until 1796, between which year and 1802 the best of his masses  were produced. To the year 1783 belongs the opera \"Armida,\" performed in  1784 and again in 1797 at Schickaneder's Theatre in Vienna. Haydn writes  to Artaria in March 1784 to say that \"Armida\" had been given at Esterhaz  with \"universal applause,\" adding that \"it is thought the best work I  have yet written.\" The autograph score was sent to London to make up, in  a manner, for the non-performance of his \"Orfeo\" there in 1791.    The \"Seven Words\"    But the most interesting work of this period was the \"Seven Words of our  Saviour on the Cross,\" written in 1785. The circumstances attending its  composition are best told in Haydn's own words. In Breitkopf & Hartel's  edition of 1801, he writes:    About fifteen years ago I was requested by a Canon of Cadiz to compose  instrumental music on the Seven Words of Jesus on the Cross. It was  the custom of the Cathedral of Cadiz to produce an oratorio every year  during Lent, the effect of the performance being not a little enhanced  by the following circumstances. The walls, windows and pillars of the  Church were hung with black cloth, and only one large lamp, hanging from  the centre of the roof, broke the solemn obscurity. At mid-day the doors  were closed and the ceremony began. After a short service the bishop  ascended the pulpit, pronounced one of the Seven Words (or sentences)  and delivered a discourse thereon. This ended, he left the pulpit and  knelt prostrate before the altar. The pause was filled by the music. The  bishop then in like manner pronounced the second word, then the third,  and so on, the orchestra falling in at the conclusion of each discourse.  My composition was to be subject to these conditions, and it was no easy  matter to compose seven adagios to last ten minutes each, and follow one  after the other without fatiguing the listeners; indeed I found it quite  impossible to confine myself within the appointed limits.    This commission may be taken as a further evidence of the growing extent  of Haydn's fame. He appears to have been already well known in Spain.  Boccherini carried on a friendly correspondence with him from Madrid,  and he was actually made the hero of a poem called \"The Art of Music,\"  published there in 1779. The \"Seven Words\" created a profound impression  when performed under the circumstances just detailed, but the work was  not allowed to remain in its original form, though it was printed in  that form by Artaria and by Forster. Haydn divided it into two parts,  and added choruses and solos, in which form it was given for the first  time at Eisenstadt in October, 1797, and published in 1801. The \"Seven  Words\" was a special favourite of the composer himself, who indeed is  declared by some to have preferred it to all his other compositions.    The \"Toy\" Symphony    The remaining years of the period covered by this chapter being almost  totally devoid of incident, we may pause to notice briefly two of the  better-known symphonies of the time--the \"Toy\" Symphony and the more  famous \"Farewell.\" The former is a mere jeu d'esprit, in which, with an  orchestral basis of two violins and a bass, the solo instruments are all  of a burlesque character. Mozart attempted something of a kindred  nature in his \"Musical joke,\" where instruments come in at wrong places,  execute inappropriate phrases, and play abominably out of tune. This  kind of thing does not require serious notice, especially in the case  of Haydn, to whom humour in music was a very different matter from the  handling of rattles and penny trumpets and toy drums.    The \"Farewell\" Symphony    The \"Farewell\" Symphony has often been described, though the  circumstances of its origin are generally mis-stated. It has been  asserted, for example, that Haydn intended it as an appeal to the prince  against the dismissal of the Capelle. But this, as Pohl has conclusively  shown, is incorrect. The real design of the \"Farewell\" was to persuade  the prince to shorten his stay at Esterhaz, and so enable the musicians  to rejoin their wives and families. Fortunately, the prince was  quick-witted enough to see the point of the joke. As one after another  ceased playing and left the orchestra, until only two violinists  remained, he quietly observed, \"If all go, we may as well go too.\"  Thus Haydn's object was attained--for the time being! The \"Farewell\"  is perfectly complete as a work of art, but its fitness for ordinary  occasions is often minimized by the persistent way in which its original  purpose is pointed out to the listener.    Free from Esterhaz    Haydn's active career at Esterhaz may be said to have closed with the  death, on September 28, 1790, of Prince Nicolaus. The event was of great  importance to his future. Had the prince lived, Haydn would doubtless  have continued in his service, for he \"absolutely adored him.\" But  Prince Anton, who now succeeded, dismissed the whole Capelle, retaining  only the few members necessary for the carrying on of the church  service, and Haydn's occupation was practically gone. The new prince  nominally held the right to his services, but there was no reason for  his remaining longer at the castle, and he accordingly took up his  residence in Vienna. Thus free to employ his time as he considered best,  Haydn embraced the opportunity to carry out a long-meditated project,  and paid the first of his two visits to London. With these we enter upon  a new epoch in the composer's life, and one of great interest to the  student and lover of music.        CHAPTER V.

English Music about 1791    Haydn came to England in 1791. It may occur to the reader to ask what  England was doing in music at that time, and who were the foremost  representatives of the art. The first question may be partially answered  from the literature of the period. Thus Jackson, in his Present State of  Music in London, published the year after Haydn's arrival, remarks  that \"instrumental music has been of late carried to such perfection  in London by the consummate skill of the performers that any attempt to  beat the time would be justly considered as entirely needless.\" Burney,  again, in his last volume, published in 1789, says that the great  improvement in taste during the previous twenty years was \"as different  as civilized people from savages\"; while Stafford Smith, writing in  1779, tells that music was then \"thought to be in greater perfection  than among even the Italians themselves.\" There is a characteristic John  Bull complacency about these statements which is hardly borne out by a  study of the lives of the leading contemporary musicians. Even Mr Henry  Davey, the applauding historian of English music, has to admit the  evanescent character of the larger works which came from the composers  of that \"bankrupt century.\" Not one of these composers--not even  Arne--is a real personality to us like Handel, or Bach, or Haydn, or  Mozart. The great merit of English music was melody, which seems to  have been a common gift, but \"the only strong feeling was patriotic  enthusiasm, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37901"],[0,"Profitable Squab Breeding (#12)"],[1,"     40    Regularity,                                             63    Roup,                                                   55    Runts,                                                  12      Salt,                                                   29    Sanitation,                                             22    Sex, How Determined,                                    35    Site for Plant,                                         65    Sound Grain,                                            26    South Jersey District,                                  63    Starting a Loft,                                        61    Sweet Fern Tea,                                         59      Testing Eggs,                                           65      Ventilation,                                            65    Vertigo,                                                56      Water Fountains,                                        22    Weight of Squabs,                                       61    Wheat,                                                  26    Wing Disease,                                           57    Worms,                                                  57          A.
