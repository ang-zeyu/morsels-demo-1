A flag of gold with a lion worked upon it waveth along  its field.\"    And Hujir said, \"It belongeth unto Gudarz the brave. And those who stand  about it are his sons, for eighty men of might are sprung from his  loins.\"    Then Sohrab said, \"To whom belongeth the tent draped with green tissues?  Before its doors is planted the flag of Kawah. I see upon its throne a  Pehliva, nobler of mien than all his fellows, whose head striketh the  stars. And beside him standeth a steed tall as he, and his standard  showeth a lion and a writhing dragon.\"    When Hujir heard this question he thought within himself, \"If I tell  unto this lion the signs whereby he may know Rustem the Pehliva, surely  he will fall upon him and seek to destroy him. It will beseem me better,  therefore, to keep silent, and to omit his name from the list of the  heroes.\" So he said unto Sohrab:    \"This is some ally who is come unto Kai Kaous from far Cathay, and his  name is not known unto me.\"    And Sohrab when he heard it was downcast, and his heart was sad that he  could nowhere discover Rustem; and though it seemed unto him that he  beheld the marks whereby his mother said that he would know him, he  could not credit the words of his eyes against the words of Hujir. Still  he asked yet again the name of the warrior, and yet again Hujir denied  it unto him, for it was written that that should come to pass which had  been decreed. But Sohrab ceased not from his questionings. And he asked:    \"Who dwelleth beneath the standard with the head of a wolf?\"    And Hujir said, \"It is Gew, the son of Gudarz, who dwelleth within that  tent, and men call him Gew the valiant.\"    Then Sohrab said, \"Whose is the seat over which are raised awnings and  brocades of Roum, that glisten with gold in the sunlight?\"    And Hujir said, \"It is the throne of Fraburz, the son of the Shah.\"    Then Sohrab said, \"It beseemeth the son of a Shah to surround himself  with such splendour.\"    And he pointed unto a tent with trappings of yellow that was encircled  by flags of many colours. And he questioned of its owner.    And Hujir said, \"Guraz the lion-hearted is master therein.\"    Then Sohrab, when he could not learn the tent of his father, questioned  Hujir concerning Rustem, and he asked yet a third time of the green  tent. Yet Hujir ever replied that he knew not the name of its master.  And when Sohrab pressed him concerning Rustem, he said that Rustem  lingered in Zaboulistan, for it was the feast of roses. But Sohrab  refused to give ear unto the thought that Kai Kaous should go forth to  battle without the aid of Rustem, whose might none could match. So he  said unto Hujir:    \"And thou show not unto me the tents of Rustem, I will strike thy head  from off thy shoulders, and the world shall fade before thine eyes.  Choose, therefore, the truth or thy life.\"    And Hujir thought within himself, \"Though five score men cannot  withstand Rustem when he be roused to battle-fury, my mind misgiveth me  that he may have found his equal in this boy. And, for that the  stripling is younger, it might come about that he subdue the Pehliva.  What recketh my life against the weal of Iran? I will therefore abandon  me into his hands rather than show unto him the marks of Rustem the  Pehliva. So he said:    \"Why seekest thou to know Rustem the Pehliva? Surely thou wilt know him  in battle, and he shall strike thee dumb, and quell thy pride of youth.  Yet I will not show him unto thee.\"    When Sohrab heard these words he raised his sword and smote Hujir, and  made an end of him with a great blow. Then he made himself ready for  fight, and leaped upon his steed of battle, and he rode till he came  unto the camp of the Iranians, and he broke down the barriers with his  spear, and fear seized upon all men when they beheld his stalwart form  and majesty of mien and action. Then Sohrab opened his mouth, and his  voice of thunder was heard even unto the far ends of the camp. And he  spake words of pride, and called forth the Shah to do battle with him,  and he sware with a loud voice that the blood of Zindeh should be  avenged. Now when Sohrab's voice had run throughout the camp, confusion  spread within its borders, and none of those who stood about the throne  would accept his challenge for the Shah. And with one accord they said  that Rustem was their sole support, and that his sword alone could cause  the sun to weep. And Tus sped him within the courts of Rustem. And  Rustem said:    \"The hardest tasks doth Kai Kaous ever lay upon me.\"    But the nobles would not suffer him to linger, neither to waste time in  words, and they buckled upon him his armour, and they threw his  leopard-skin about him, and they saddled Rakush, and made ready the hero  for the strife. And they pushed him forth, and called after him:    \"Haste, haste, for no common combat awaiteth thee, for verily Ahriman  standeth before us.\"    Now when Rustem was come before Sohrab, and beheld the youth, brave and  strong, with a breast like unto Saum, he said to him:    \"Let us go apart from hence, and step forth from out the lines of the  armies.\"    For there was a zone between the camps that none might pass. And Sohrab  assented to the demand of Rustem, and they stepped out into it, and made  them ready for single combat. But when Sohrab would have fallen upon  him, the soul of Rustem melted with compassion, and he desired to save a  boy thus fair and valiant. So he said unto him:    \"O young man, the air is warm and soft, but the earth is cold. I have  pity upon thee, and would not take from thee the boon of life. Yet if we  combat together, surely thou wilt fall by my hands, for none have  withstood my power, neither men nor Deevs nor dragons. Desist,  therefore, from this enterprise, and quit the ranks of Turan, for Iran  hath need of heroes like unto thee.\"    Now while Rustem spake thus, the heart of Sohrab went out to him. And he  looked at him wistfully, and said:    \"O hero, I am about to put unto thee a question, and I entreat of thee  that thou reply to me according to the truth. Tell unto me thy name,  that my heart may rejoice in thy words, for it seemeth unto me that thou  art none other than Rustem, the son of Zal, the son of Saum, the son of  Neriman,\"    But Rustem replied, \"Thou errest, I am not Rustem, neither am I sprung  from the race of Neriman. Rustem is a Pehliva, but I, I am a slave, and  own neither a crown nor a throne,\"    These words spake Rustem that Sohrab might be afraid when he beheld his  prowess, and deem that yet greater might was hidden in the camp of his  enemy. But Sohrab when he heard these words was sad, and his hopes that  were risen so high were shattered, and the day that had looked so bright  was made dark unto his eyes. Then he made him ready for the combat, and  they fought, until their spears were shivered and their swords hacked  like unto saws. And when all their weapons were bent, they betook them  into clubs, and they waged war with these until they were broken. Then  they strove until their mail was torn and their horses spent with  exhaustion, and even then they could not desist, but wrestled with one  another with their hands till that the sweat and blood ran down from  their bodies. And they contended until their throats were parched and  their bodies weary, and to neither was given the victory. They stayed  them a while to rest, and Rustem thought within his mind how all his  days he had not coped with such a hero. And it seemed to him that his  contest with the White Deev had been as nought to this.    Now when they had rested a while they fell to again, and they fought  with arrows, but still none could surpass the other. Then Rustem strove  to hurl Sohrab from his steed, but it availed him naught, and he could  shake him no more than the mountain can be moved from its seat. So they  betook themselves again unto clubs, and Sohrab aimed at Rustem with  might and smote him, and Rustem reeled beneath the stroke, and bit his  lips in agony. Then Sohrab vaunted his advantage, and bade Rustem go and  measure him with his equals; for though his strength be great, he could  not stand against a youth. So they went their ways, and Rustem fell upon  the men of Turan, and spread confusion far and wide among their ranks;  and Sohrab raged along the lines of Iran, and men and horses fell under  his hands. And Rustem was sad in his soul, and he turned with sorrow  into his camp. But when he saw the destruction Sohrab had wrought his  anger was kindled, and he reproached the youth, and challenged him to  come forth yet again to single combat. But because that the day was far  spent they resolved to rest until the morrow.    Then Rustem went before Kai Kaous and told him of this boy of valour,  and he prayed unto Ormuzd that He would give him strength to vanquish  his foe. Yet he made ready also his house lest he should fall in the  fight, and he commanded that a tender message be borne unto Rudabeh, and  he sent words of comfort unto Zal, his father. And Sohrab, too, in his  camp lauded the might of Rustem, and he said how the battle had been  sore, and how his mind had misgiven him of the issue. And he spake unto  Human, saying:    \"My mind is filled with thoughts of this aged man, mine adversary, for  it would seem unto me that his stature is like unto mine, and that I  behold about him the tokens that my mother recounted unto me. And my  heart goeth out toward him, and I muse if it be Rustem, my father. For  it behoveth me not to combat him. Wherefore, I beseech thee, tell unto  me how this may be.\"    But Human answered and said, \"Oft have I looked upon the face of Rustem  in battle, and mine eyes have beheld his deeds of valour; but this man  in no wise"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6628"],[0,"The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth (#12)"],[1,"rt. They were told that it was a wounded confederate, and so  held their tongues. The little ferry, again in requisition, took them  over by squads, and they pushed from Port Conway to Bell Plain, which  they reached in the middle of the afternoon. All the way the blood  dribbled from the corpse in a slow, incessant, sanguine exudation. The  old negro was niggardly dismissed with two paper dollars. The dead man  untied and cast upon the vessel's dock, steam gotten up in a little  while, and the broad Potomac shores saw this skeleton ship flit by, as  the bloody sun threw gashes and blots of unhealthy light along the  silver surface.

He tried to talk for his own exoneration, saying he had  ridden, as was his wont, beyond the East Branch, and returning, found  Booth wounded, who begged him to be his companion. Of his crime he knew  nothing, so help him God, &c. But nobody listened to him. All interest  of crime, courage, and retribution centered in the dead flesh at his  feet. At Washington, high and low turned out to look on Booth. Only a  few were permitted to see his corpse for purposes of recognition. It was  fairly preserved, though on one side of the face distorted, and looking  blue like death, and wildly bandit-like, as if beaten by avenging winds.    Yesterday the Secretary of War, without instructions of any kind,  committed to Colonel Lafayette C. Baker, of the secret service, the  stark corpse of J. Wilkes Booth. The secret service never fulfilled its  volition more secretively. \"What have you done with the body?\" said I to  Baker. \"That is known\" he answered, \"to only one man living besides  myself. It is gone. I will not tell you where. The only man who knows is  sworn to silence. Never till the great trumpeter comes shall the grave  of Booth be discovered.\" And this is true. Last night, the 27th of  April, a small row boat received the carcass of the murderer; two men  were in it they carried the body off into the darkness, and out of that  darkness it will never return. In the darkness, like his great crime,  may it remain forever, impalpable, invisible, nondescript, condemned to  that worse than damnation,--annihilation. The river-bottom may ooze  about it laden with great shot and drowning manacles. The earth may have  opened to give it that silence and forgiveness which man will never give  its memory. The fishes may swim around it, or the daisies grow white  above it; but we shall never know. Mysterious, incomprehensible,  unattainable, like the dim times through which we live and think upon as  if we only dreamed them in perturbed fever, the assassin of a nation's  head rests somewhere in the elements, and that is all; but if the  indignant seas or the profaned turf shall ever vomit his corpse from  their recesses, and it receive humane or Christian burial from some who  do not recognize it, let the last words those decaying lips ever uttered  be carved above them with a dagger, to tell the history of a young and  once promising life--useless! useless!          LETTER V.    A SOLUTION OF THE CONSPIRACY.    [The annexed Letter, which has been cavilled at, as much as copied, is a  rationale of the Conspiracy, combined from the Government's own  officers. When it was written it was believed to be true: the evidence  at the trial has confirmed much of it: I reprint it to show how men's  ingenuities were at work to account for the conception and progress of  the Plot.]      Washington, May 2.    Justice and fame are equally and simultaneously satisfied. The President  is not yet in his sarcophagus, but all the conspirators against his  life, with a minor exception or two, are in their prison cells waiting  for the halter.    The dark and bloody plot against a good ruler's life is now so fully  unraveled that I may make it plain to you. There is nothing to be gained  by further waiting; the trials are proceeding; the evidence is mountain  high. Within a week the national scaffold will have done its work, and  be laid away forever. This prompt and necessary justice will signal the  last public assassination in America. Borgia, and Medici, and  Brinvilliers, have left no descendants on this side of the world.    The conspiracy was both the greatest and the smallest of our cycle.  Narrowed in execution to a few, it was understood and connived at by a  multitude. One man was its head and heart; its accessories were so  numerous that the trouble is not whom to suspect, but whom not accuse.  Damning as the result must be to the character of our race, it must be  admitted, in the light of facts, that Americans are as secretive and as  skillful plotters as any people in the world. The Rye House plot, never  fully understood; the many schemes of Mazzini, never fastened upon him  sufficiently well for implication, yield in extent, darkness and  intricacy, to the republican plot against the President's life and those  of his counselors. The police operations prove that the late murder as  not a spasmodic and fitful crime, but long premeditated, and carried to  consummation with as much cohesion and resolution as the murder of  Allessandro de Medici or Henri Quatre.    I have been accused of cannonizing Booth. Much as I denounce and  deprecate his crime--holding him to be worthy of all execration, and so  seeped in blood that the excuses of a century will fail to lift him out  of the atmosphere of common felons--I still, at every new developement,  stand farther back in surprise and terror at the wonderful resources and  extraordinary influence of one whom I had learned to consider a mere  Thespian, full of sound, fury, and assertion.    Strange and anomalous as the facts may seem, John Wilkes Booth was the  sole projector of the plot against the President which culminated in the  taking of that good man's life. He had rolled under his tongue the sweet  paragraphs of Shakspeare refering to Brutus, as had his father so well,  that the old man named one son Junius Brutus, and the other John Wilkes,  after the wild English agitator, until it became his ambition, like the  wicked Lorenzino de Medici, to stake his life upon one stroke for fame,  the murder of a ruler obnoxious to the South.    That Wilkes Booth was a southern man from the first may be accounted for  upon grounds, of interest as well as of sympathy. It is insidious to  find no higher incentive than appreciation, but on the stage this is the  first and last motive; and as Edwin Booth made his success in the North  and remained steadfast, Wilkes Booth was most truly applauded in the  South, and became rebel. A false emotion of gratitude, as well as an  impulse of mingled waywardness and gratitude, set John Wilkes's face  from the first toward the North, and he burned to make his name a part  of history, cried into fame by the applauses of the South.    He hung to his bloody suggestion with dogged inflexibility, maintaining  only one axiom above all the rest--that whatever minor parts might be  enacted--Casca, Cassius, or what not--he was to be the dramatic Brutus,  excepting that assassin's negativeness. In other words, the idea was to  be his own, as well us the crowning blow.    Booth shrank at first from murder, until another and less dangerous  resolution failed. This was no less than the capture of the President's  body, and its detention or transportation to the South. I do not rely on  this assertion upon his sealed letter, where he avows it; there has been  found upon a street within the city limits, a house belonging to one  Mrs. Greene; mined and furnished with underground apartments, manacles  and all the accessories to private imprisonment. Here the President, and  as many as could be gagged and conveyed away with him, were to be  concealed in the event of failure to run them into the confederacy.  Owing to his failure to group around him as many men as he desired,  Booth abandoned the project of kidnapping; but the house was discovered  last week, as represented, ready to be blown up at a moment's notice.    It was at this time that Booth devised his triumphant route through the  South. The dramatic element seems to have been never lacking in his  design, and with all his base purposes he never failed to consider some  subsequent notoriety to be enjoyed. He therefore shipped, before the end  of 1864, his theatrical wardrobe from Canada to Nassau. After the  commission of his crime he intended to reclaim it, and \"star\" through  the South, drawing money as much by his crime as his abilities.    When Booth began \"on his own responsibility,\" to hunt for accomplices,  he found his theory at fault. The bold men he had dreamed of refused to  join him in the rash attempt at kidnapping the President, and were too  conscientious to meditate murder. All those who presented themselves  were military men, unwilling to be subordinate to a civilian, and a mere  play-actor, and the mortified bravo found himself therefore compelled to  sink to a petty rank in the plot, or to make use of base and despicable  assistants. His vanity found it easier to compound with the second  alternative than the first.    Here began the first resolve, which, in its mere animal estate, we may  name courage. Booth found that a tragedy in real life could no more be  enacted without greasy-faced and knock-kneed supernumeraries than upon  the mimic stage. Your \"First Citizen,\" who swings a stave for Marc  Antony, and drinks hard porter behind the flies is very like the bravo  of real life, who murders between his cocktails at the nearest bar.  Wilkes Booth had passed the ordeal of a garlicky green-room, and did not  shrink from the broader and ranker green-room of real life. He assembled  around him, one by one, the cut-throats at whom his soul would have"]]]
