[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7777"],[0,"Narrative of the Voyages Round the World, Performed (#12)"],[1,"Long Sand. I shall not regularly  pursue the course of our commander round New Zealand. In this course  he spent nearly six months, and made large additions to the knowledge  of navigation and geography. By making almost the whole circuit of New  Zealand, he ascertained it to be two islands, with a strength of  evidence which no prejudice could gainsay or resist. He obtained  likewise a full acquaintance with the inhabitants of the different  parts of the country, with regard to whom it was clearly proved, that  they are eaters of human flesh. Omitting a number of minute  circumstances, I shall only select a few things which mark Mr. Cook's  personal conduct, and relate to his intercourse with the natives.    The good usage the three boys had met with, and the friendly and  generous manner in which they were dismissed to their own homes, had  some effect in softening the dispositions of the neighbouring Indians.  Several of them, who had come on board while the ship lay becalmed in  the afternoon, manifested every sign of friendship, and cordially  invited the English to go back to their old bay, or to a cove which  was not quite so far off. But Lieutenant Cook chose rather to  prosecute his discoveries, having reason to hope that he should find a  better harbour than any he had yet seen.    While the ship was, hauling round to the south end of a small island,  which the lieutenant had named Portland, from its very great  resemblance to Portland in the British Channel, she suddenly fell into  shoal water and broken ground. The soundings were never twice the  same, jumping at once from seven fathom to eleven. However, they were  always seven fathom or more; and in a short time the Endeavour got  clear of danger, and again sailed in deep water. While the ship was in  apparent distress, the inhabitants of the islands, who in vast numbers  sat on its white cliffs, and could not avoid perceiving some  appearance of confusion on board, and some irregularity in the working  of the vessel, were desirous of taking advantage of her critical  situation. Accordingly, five canoes full of men, and well armed, were  put off with the utmost expedition; and they came so near, and shewed  so hostile a disposition by shouting, brandishing their lances, and  using threatening gestures, that the lieutenant was in pain for his  small boat, which was still employed in sounding. By a musket which he  ordered to be fired over them, they were rather provoked than  intimidated. The firing of a four pounder loaded with grape shot,  though purposely discharged wide of them, produced a better effect.  Upon the report of the piece the Indians all rose up and shouted; but  instead of continuing the chase, they collected themselves together,  and, after a short consultation, went quietly away.    On the 14th of October, Lieutenant Cook having hoisted out his pinnace  and long boat to search for water, just as they were about to set off,  several boats full of the New Zealand people were seen coming from the  shore. After some time five of these boats, having on board between  eighty and ninety men, made towards the ship; and four more followed  at no great distance, as if to sustain the attack. When the first five  had gotten within about a hundred yards of the Endeavour, they began  to sing their war song, and brandishing their pikes, prepared for an  engagement. As the lieutenant was extremely desirous of avoiding the  unhappy necessity of using fire-arms against the natives, Tupia was  ordered to acquaint them that our voyagers had weapons which, like  thunder, would destroy them in a moment; that they would immediately  convince them of their power by directing their effect so that they  should not be hurt; but that if they persisted in any hostile attempt,  they would be exposed to the direct attack of these formidable  weapons. A four pounder, loaded with grape shot, was then fired wide  of them; and this expedient was fortunately attended with success. The  report, the flash, and above all the shot, which spread very far in  the water, terrified the Indians to such a degree, that they began to  paddle away with all their might. At the instance, however, of Tupia,  the people of one of the boats were induced to lay aside their arms,  and to come under the stern of the Endeavour; in consequence of which  they received a variety of presents.    On the next day a circumstance occurred, which shewed how ready one of  the inhabitants of New Zealand was to take an advantage of our  navigators. In a large armed canoe, which came boldly alongside of the  ship, was a man who had a black skin thrown over him, somewhat like  that of a bear. Mr. Cook being desirous of knowing to what animal it  originally belonged, offered the Indian for it a piece of red baize.  With this bargain he seemed to be greatly pleased, immediately pulling  off the skin, and holding it up in the boat. He would not, however,  part with it till he had the cloth in his possesssion; and as their  could be no transfer of property if equal caution should be exercised  on both sides, the lieutenant ordered the baize to be delivered into  his hands. Upon this, instead of sending up the skin, he began with  amazing coolness to pack up both that and the cloth, which he had  received as the purchase of it, in a basket: nor did he pay the least  regard to Mr. Cook's demand or remonstrances, but soon after put off  from the English vessel. Our commander was too generous to revenge  this insult by any act of severity.    During the course of a traffic which was carrying on for some fish,  little Tayeto, Tupia's boy, was placed among others over the ship's  side; to hand up what was purchased. While he was thus employed, one  of the New Zealanders, watching his opportunity, suddenly seized him  and dragged him into a canoe. Two of the natives then held him down in  the fore part of it, and the others, with great activity, paddled her  off with all possible celerity. An action so violent rendered it  indispensably necessary that the marines, who were in arms upon the  deck, should be ordered to fire. Though the shot was directed to that  part of the canoe which was furthest from the boy, and somewhat wide  of her, it being thought favourable rather to miss the rowers than to  run the hazard of hurting Tayeto, it happened that one man dropped.  This occasioned the Indians to quit their hold of the youth, who  instantly leaped into the water, and swam towards the ship. In the  meanwhile, the largest of the canoes pulled round and followed him;  and till some muskets and a great gun were fired at her, did not  desist from the pursuit. The ship being brought to, a boat was  lowered, and the poor boy was taken up unhurt. Some of the gentlemen,  who with their glasses traced the canoes to shore, agreed in asserting  that they saw three men carried up the beach, who appeared to be  either dead, or wholly disabled by their wounds.    While, on the 18th, the Endeavour lay abreast of a peninsula within  Portland Island, called Terakako, two of the natives, who were judged  to be chiefs, placed an extraordinary degree of confidence in Mr.  Cook. They were so well pleased with the kindness which had been shown  them in a visit to the ship, that they determined not to go on shore  till the next morning. This was a circumstance by no means agreeable  to the lieutenant, and he remonstrated against it; but as they  persisted in their resolution, he agreed to comply with it, provided  their servants were also taken on board, and their canoe hoisted into  the ship. The countenance of one of these two chiefs was the most open  and ingenuous that our commander had ever seen, so that he soon gave  up every suspicion of his entertaining any sinister design. When the  guests were put on shore the next morning, they expressed some  surprise at seeing themselves so far from their habitations.    On Monday the 23rd, while the ship was in Tagadoo Bay, Lieutenant Cook  went on shore to examine the watering-place, and found every thing  agreeable to his wishes. The boat landed in the cove, without the  least serf; the water was excellent, and conveniently situated: there  was plenty of wood close to the high water mark, and the disposition  of the people was as favourable in all respects as could be desired.  Early the next morning, our commander sent Lieutenant Gore to  superintend the cutting of wood and filling of water, with a  sufficient number of men for both purposes, and all the marines as a  guard. Soon after he went on shore himself, and continued there during  the whole day. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who had landed on the same  day, found in their walks several things worthy of notice. As they  were advancing in some of the valleys, the hills on each side of which  were very steep, they were suddenly struck with the sight of an  extraordinary natural curiosity. It was a rock perforated through its  whole substance, so as to form a rude but stupendous arch or cavern,  opening directly to the sea. This aperture was seventy-five feet long,  twenty-seven broad, and five and forty feet high, commanding a view of  the bay and the hills on the other side, which were seen through it;  and opening at once upon the view, produced an effect far superior to  any of the contrivances of art.    When on the 28th the gentlemen of the Endeavour went on shore upon an  island which lies to the left hand of the entrance of Tolaga Bay, they  saw there the largest canoe they had yet met with; her length being  sixty-eight feet and a half, her breadth five feet, and her height  three feet six inches. In the same island was a larger house than any  they had hitherto seen; but it was in an unfinished state, and full of  chips.    While the ship was in Hicks's Bay, the inhabitants of the adjoining  coast were found to be very hostile. This gave much uneasiness to our  navigators, and was indeed contrary to their expectation;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],[0,"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#12)"],[1,"is selected and mentioned:       Li estas la plej juna el tiuj, he is the youngest of (out of) those.     Vi estas la plej felicxa el ni, you are the happiest of us.     Tiu estis la plej ruza el la viroj,        that one was the craftiest of the men.                             MANNER AND CHARACTERISTIC.    76. The actions or feelings which accompany an act or state, or the  characteristic which permanently accompanies a person or thing, may be  expressed by a substantive with the preposition \"kun\":       Li prenis gxin kun la plej granda zorgo,        he took it with the greatest care.     Mi auxdis lin kun intereso kaj plezuro,        I heard him with interest and pleasure.     Sxi estas virino kun bona gusto,        she is a woman with (of) good taste.

The verbs \"diri\", to say, \"paroli\", to talk, to speak, and  \"rakonti\", to relate, having in common the general idea of speech or  expression, must not be confused in use:       Mi diris al vi ke pluvas, I said to (told) you that it was raining.     Mi diris gxin al vi, I said it to you (I told you).     Mi parolis al vi pri gxi, I talked (spoke) to you about it.     Mi rakontis gxin al vi, I related (told) it to you.                                     VOCABULARY       ami = to love.                     pli = more (74).     ekster = outside (of).             plumo = pen.     Frederiko = Frederick.             rakonti = to relate (77).     gratuli = to congratulate.         regxo = king.     intereso = interest.               servisto = servant.     letero = letter.                   skribi = to write.     plej = most (74).                  tiam = then (73).     plezuro = pleasure.                zorgo = care.                       FREDERIKO GRANDA KAJ LA JUNA SERVISTO.    Hieraux mi legis interesan libron pri Frederiko Granda (\"the Great\").  En gxi oni rakontas ke la regxo kun plezuro legis aux skribis per sia  plumo, dum malfruaj horoj de la nokto. Agrabla juna knabo, la plej juna  el la servistoj, tiam restis ekster la pordo. Cxar la regxo legis plej  interesan novan libron, li ne opiniis ke la horo estas malfrua. Li vokis  sian malgrandan serviston, sed la knabo, nek venis nek respondis. La  regxo iris tien, kaj trovis la knabon ekster la pordo. Li vidis ke la  knabo dormas sur malalta segxo. Tiam Frederiko Granda ne estis kolera,  sed hontis cxar li vokis la infanon. La regxo Frederiko vidis leteron  en la posxo de la knabo. Tuj li prenis la leteron el lia posxo, kaj  rigardis gxin. Gxi estis letero al la servisto, de lia patrino. Sxi ne  estis ricxa virino, sxi sxajnis esti tre malricxa. En cxi tiu letero la  patrino diris per la plumo ke sxi amas la filon. Sxi dankis lin cxar  li skribis al sxi longan leteron. Sxi ankaux dankis lin cxar li donis  al sxi monon. La regxo volis esti tre bona al tia filo. Kun la plej  granda zorgo li metis monon el sia posxo kun la letero kaj tiam lasis la  leteron en ties posxo. Tiam li formarsxis al sia cxambro, kaj vokis la  malgrandan serviston. La knabo tuj auxdis, kaj rapidis tra la pordo. Li  kuris trans la cxambron, kaj staris antaux la regxo. \"Cxu vi dormis?\"  diris Frederiko Granda. \"Jes, mi timas ke mi preskaux dormis,\" respondis  la knabo, \"kaj mi tre hontas.\" Tiam li metis la manon en la posxon,  kaj trovis la monon. Li sxajnis pli malfelicxa kaj diris kun granda  timo \"Malamiko metis cxi tiun monon en mian posxon! Oni opinios ke mi  sxtelis gxin! Oni malamos min, kaj forpelos min!\" Frederiko respondis,  \"Ne, mi donis gxin al vi, cxar mi amas bonajn knabojn. Mi gratulas vian  patrinon, cxar sxi havas tian filon.\"                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. An interesting story is related (54) about Frederick the Great. 2.

THE DEMONSTRATIVE ADVERB OF MOTIVE OR REASON.    78. The demonstrative adverb of motive or reason, related to the  demonstrative pronoun \"tiu\", is \"tial\", therefore, for that reason,  so:       Tial la servisto foriris, therefore the servant went away.     Tial mi gratulis lin, for that reason I congratulated him.     Tial oni forpelis lin, so they drove him away.                               DERIVATION OF ADVERBS.    79. Adverbs may be derived from roots whose meaning permits, by addition  of the adverb-ending \"-e\", as \"felicxe\", happily, \"kolere\", angrily. The  comparison of adverbs is similar to that of adjectives:       POSITIVE.       COMPARATIVE.            SUPERLATIVE.     -------------   ----------------------  -----------------------     sagxe, wisely   pli sagxe, more wisely  plej sagxe, most wisely     bone, well      pli bone, better        plej bone, best     malbone, badly  pli malbone, worse      plej malbone, worst     ruze, slyly     pli ruze, more slyly    plej ruze, most slyly                                \"MALPLI\" AND \"MALPLEJ\".    80. The opposites (67) of \"pli\" and \"plej\" are \"malpli\", less, and  \"malplej\", least. Their use is similar to that of \"pli\" and \"plej\".  (These adverbs may also modify verbs):       Li estas malpli kuragxa, he is less courageous.     Tiuj estis malplej akraj, those were least sharp.     La vento blovis malpli forte, the wind blew less strongly.     Li skribis malplej zorge, he wrote least carefully.     Mi malpli timas ilin, I fear them less.     Vi malplej bezonos helpon, you will need help least.                      COMPARISON OF WORDS EXPRESSING QUANTITY.    81. Since in their precise sense the words \"pli\", \"malpli\", \"plej\",  \"malplej\", express degree, a quantitative meaning is given by \"multe\",  \"much\", in the desired degree of comparison:       multe, much        pli multe, more (in amount)   plej multe, most                          malpli multe, less     \"      malplej multe, least       malmulte, little   pli malmulte, less     \"      plej malmulte, least                            COMPARISONS CONTAINING \"OL\".    82. In a comparison made by the use of \"pli\" or \"malpli\", the case used  after \"ol\", than, must indicate clearly the sense intended:       Mi amas ilin pli multe ol sxin, I love them more than (I love) her.     Mi amas ilin pli multe ol sxi,        I love them more than she (loves them).     Vi helpis la viron malpli multe ol la knabo,        you helped the man less than the boy (helped him).     Vi helpis la viron malpli multe ol la knabon,        you helped the man less than (you helped) the boy.                                  CAUSAL CLAUSES.    83. A clause giving a cause or reason is introduced by \"cxar\", because,  for, or by the combination \"tial ke\", for this reason that, because,  for:       Mi venis frue, cxar mi volis vidi vin,                 I came early, for I wished to see you.     La floroj velkis tial, ke ne pluvis,                 the flowers wilted for this reason, that it did not rain.                                     VOCABULARY       anstataux = instead of.            multa = much (multaj, many).     aprilo = April.                    ofta = frequent (ofte, often).     auxgusto = August.                 ol = than (82).     jaro = year.                       printempo = spring (season).     junio = June.                      tago = day.     julio = July.                      sezono = season.     majo = May.                        somero = summer.     marto = March.                     tial = therefore (78).     monato = month.                    vintro = winter.                                  PRI LA SEZONOJ.    La vintro estas la malplej agrabla sezono el la tuta jaro. Negxas tre  multe, kaj tial oni nur malofte promenas, cxar la stratoj estas tro  malsekaj. Oni marsxas kun granda zorgo, kaj malrapide (\"slowly\"), tial  ke oni ne volas fali kaj preskaux rompi la kolon. Oni zorge gardas sin  tiam kontraux la malvarmaj nordaj ventoj. La manojn oni metas en la  posxojn, sed la vizagxon oni ne povas bone gardi. Mi ne sxatas resti  ekster la domo dum tia vetero. Mi multe preferas sidi en varma luma  cxambro, kaj skribi leterojn per bona plumo. La monatoj de la printempo  estas marto, aprilo kaj majo. La bela printempo sxajnas pli agrabla ol  la vintro. Gxiaj tagoj estas pli longaj kaj pli varmaj, gxiaj ventoj  blovas malpli forte. En cxi tiu sezono la kampoj kaj arboj frue komencas  montri plej belajn kolorojn. La birdoj konstruas siajn nestojn, kaj  dolcxe kantas. Oni povas promeni sur la mola herbo, anstataux sur  malsekaj malagrablaj stratoj."]]]
