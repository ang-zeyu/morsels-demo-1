He employed a number of men and proceeded at once to open      it. Before long he was rewarded by finding in the centre and near      the surface a bed of the tough clay generally known as pipe-clay,      which must have been brought from a distance of some twelve miles.      Imbedded in the clay was a coffin, dug out of a burr-oak log,      and in a pretty good state of preservation. In the coffin was a      skeleton, with quite a number of stone ornaments and emblems, and      some open brass rings, suitable for bracelets or anklets. These      being removed, they dug down deeper, and soon discovered a stone      dressed to an oblong shape, about eighteen inches long and twelve      wide, which proved to be a casket, neatly fitted and completely      water-tight, containing a slab of stone of hard and fine quality,      and an inch and a half thick, eight inches long, four inches wide      at one end, and tapering to three inches at the other. Upon the      face of the slab was the figure of a man, apparently a priest with      a long flowing beard, and a robe reaching to his feet. Over his      head was a curved line of characters, and upon the edges and back      of the stone closely and neatly carved letters. The slab, which I      saw myself, was shown to the Episcopalian clergyman of Newark, and      he pronounced the writings to be the Ten Commandments in ancient      Hebrew. [7]    Mr. Bancroft, referring to these circumstances, says that in neither of  them \"is it certain or even probable that the relic existed in America  before the conquest,\" though he gives no reason for the rather dogmatic  statement. For my own part, and especially in the latter case, I see  no reason to doubt the existence of these relics in America before the  advent of the Spaniards. According to the Book of Mormon the ancient  inhabitants of America, the Nephites, had the writings of Moses. The  Ten Commandments were regarded as the summing up, the crystallization  of the law of God [8] to the people, pending the advent of Messiah  with the more perfect law of the gospel. What could be more natural  than that they should multiply copies of these scriptures, or parts  of them, especially such parts as related to particular promises or  warnings to Israelites, as do the passages on the parchment found  in Pittsfield, Massachusetts? Or such summaries of the law of Moses  as the Ten Commandments constitute? That the Nephites did multiply  copies of the scriptures they had in their possession (and doubtless  also copies of striking passages of those scriptures) is evident from  what is said upon the subject by Mormon when giving an account of  the transfer of the Nephite records from one Shiblon to Helaman, the  son of Helaman: \"Now, behold, all those engravings which were in the  possession of Helaman, were written and sent forth among the children  of men throughout all the land, save it were those parts which had been  commanded by Alma should not go forth.\" [9]    The part here prohibited transcription and circulation related to the  oaths and constitutions of the secret societies from the record of the  Jaredites; [10] but for the rest, there was perfect liberty to multiply  copies of the scriptures, and that it was done is further evidenced  from the fact that missionaries from the Nephites to the Lamanites are  found to be in possession of copies of the scriptures which Lehi's  colony brought with them from Jerusalem, and from which they read for  the instruction of their hearers. [11] It is not difficult to believe,  in the light of these facts, that noted personages among native  Americans should have engraved on stone or parchment in Hebrew or in  other characters passages of the holy scriptures; nor is it incredible  that these should be buried with them--since to bury one's personal  effects with him was a custom of the natives--and that afterwards the  relics should be discovered as in the two instances cited. The fact  of the discoveries is beyond question: the nature of them is strong  incidental proof of the claims of the Book of Mormon.    Of this Newark discovery, the late Orson Pratt, who examined the  engraved stone in the city of New York, and which at the time was  in possession of the \"Ethnological Society\" of that city, makes  the following very valuable and convincing statement and argument  respecting the find. It should also be remembered that Elder Pratt's  knowledge of the Hebrew language makes his comments all the more  conclusive; while the fact that he points out in his statement that  there is in this Newark Tablet none of the modern \"points\" and  \"characters\" that have been introduced into the Hebrew \"during the last  two thousand four hundred years,\" proves conclusively that the Newark  Tablet is an ancient, not a modern production.        Thirty years after the Book of Mormon was put in print, giving the      history of the settlement of this country, one of the great mounds      south of the great lakes near Newark, in Ohio, was opened. What      was found in it? A great many curiosities, among which were some      copper pieces, supposed to be money. After digging down many feet,      and carrying off many thousand loads of stone, they at length found      a coffin in the midst of a hard kind of fire clay. Underneath this      they found a large stone that appeared to be hollow; something      seemed to rattle inside of it. The stone was cemented together      in the middle, but with some little exertion they broke it open,      when another stone was found inside of it, of a different nature      entirely from its covering. On the stone taken from the inside was      carved the figure of a man with a priestly robe flowing from his      shoulders; and over the head of this man were the Hebrew characters      for \"Moshe,\" the ancient name of Moses; while on each side of this      likeness, and on different sides of the stone, above, beneath, and      around about were the Ten Commandments that were received on Mount      Sinai, written in the ancient Hebrew characters. Now recollect      that the Book of Mormon had been in print thirty years before this      discovery. And what does this discovery prove? It proves that      the builders of these mounds, south of the great lakes in the      great Mississippi Valley in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, New York,      etc., must have understood the Hebrew characters; [12] and not      only that, but they must also have understood the law of Moses.      Otherwise how happened it that they should write on this stone      the Ten Commandments almost verbatim as they are now contained in      King James's translation of the Bible. It proves that the builders      of these mounds were Israelites, and that their illustrious dead,      buried in these mounds, had these commandments buried with them      in accordance with the custom of many of the ancient nations,      especially the Egyptians, who were in the habit of consigning their      written sacred papyrus to their great tombs. In Egypt many of these      ancient manuscripts have been exhumed and, in many instances,      pretended to be translated. So the Israelites followed the customs      of these Eastern nations, and buried that which they considered      most sacred, namely, the Ten Commandments, thundered by the voice      of the Almighty in the midst of flaming fire on Mount Sinai in the      ears of all the congregation of Israel.        I have seen that sacred stone. It is not a hatched up story. I      heard tell of it [the stone] as being in the Antiquarian Society,      or rather, as it is now called, the Ethnological Society, in the      City of New York. I went to the Secretary of that Society, and he      kindly showed me this stone, of which I have been speaking, and      being acquainted with modern Hebrew, I could form some kind of      an estimate of the ancient Hebrew, for some of the modern Hebrew      characters do not vary much in form from the ancient Hebrew. At      any rate we have enough of ancient Hebrew, that has been dug up in      Palestine and taken from among the ruins of the Israelites east      of the Miditerranean Sea, to form some kind of an estimate of the      characters, and comparing them, I could see and understand the      nature of the writings upon these records. They were also taken to      the most learned men of our country, who, as soon as they looked at      them, were able to pronounce them to be not only ancient Hebrew,      but they were also able to translate them and pronounced them to be      the Ten Commandments. This, then, is external proof, independent of      the Scriptural proofs to which I have alluded, in testimony of the      divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon.        Now, our modern Hebrew has many points; it has also many      additional characters that have been made since these colonies      left Jerusalem. Do you find on these ancient writings any of these      modern characters that have been introduced during the last two      thousand four hundred years? Not one. Do you find any Hebrew points      representing vowels? Not one; and all the new consonants that have      been introduced during the last two thousand four hundred years      were not found upon this stone to which I have referred, showing      plainly that it must have been of very ancient date. [13]    In connection with his comments on this Newark Tablet Elder Pratt also  makes the following statement:    \"HAVE MERCY ON ME A NEPHITE.\"        Five years after the discovery of this remarkable memento of the      ancient Israelites on the American continent, [the Newark Tablet],      and thirty-five years after the Book of Mormon was in print,      several other mounds in the same vicinity of Newark were opened,      in several of which Hebrew characters were found. Among"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59970"],[0,"The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet (#12)"],[1,"of the record.    The family of Peter Whitmer, and some other persons in the  neighborhood, were very earnest inquirers after truth. The supernatural  instruction and aid which David had received to go down into  Pennsylvania and offer his father's house as a refuge to Joseph, amazed  all who heard of the occurrence. Therefore Joseph found many people  at Fayette anxious to receive him. Peter Whitmer and all the members  of his household accorded to Joseph and also to Oliver every help and  comfort within their bestowal; and thus, without further anxiety as to  their maintenance or safety, they were enabled to progress with the  translation of the sacred history.    While they were not laboring upon this work, they were praying and  teaching among the people. Thus the Prophet and his assistant Oliver  wrought much good. Several honest, God-fearing souls became convinced  that Joseph Smith was entrusted with a divine mission. And in this  month of June, 1829, three persons were baptized in Seneca Lake, after  the pattern and under the authority received from John, the forerunner  of our Savior. Hyrum Smith and David Whitmer received this ordinance  under the hand of the Prophet himself, and John Whitmer, a brother of  David, was baptized by Oliver Cowdery.    The work of translation went on rapidly. When Oliver's hand would grow  weary after some hours of writing, either John or David Whitmer would  take his place and continue at the Prophet's dictation.        CHAPTER XI.    ELEVEN CHOSEN WITNESSES VIEW THE PLATES--THEIR UNIMPEACHABLE  TESTIMONY--RESTORATION OF THE MELCHISEDEC PRIESTHOOD BY DISCIPLES OF  OUR LORD--THE APOSTLESHIP CONFERRED--OTHER BAPTISMS--THE TRANSLATION  COMPLETED.    After establishing himself at the house of David Whitmer, and early in  the month of June while engaged in translating, Joseph was instructed  that three special witnesses should be blessed of God with a revelation  of the truth of the Book and should be permitted to examine the  plates. This was, also, in fulfillment of predictions published in  the Book of Mormon. When this promise became known to Oliver Cowdery  and David Whitmer, they begged that they might be numbered among the  three witnesses. While they were still making their petitions for  this favor, Martin Harris came to Fayette. Impelled by repentance and  a desire to gain forgiveness, he had followed Joseph. Martin humbled  himself in prayer to God and solicited the entreaties of Joseph in  his behalf. Joseph joined with Martin in praying to Heaven that his  humility and contrition might be accepted and that he might be received  again into favor. The Lord answered Joseph that if Martin continued  faithful and humble, and refused to be led away again by evil counsels  or the vanity of the world, his sins would be forgiven. Then Martin,  learning that witnesses were to be chosen to behold the plates of gold,  bearing the engraved record, and to give testimony to all the world  concerning this work of God, most penitently and anxiously solicited  that he might be one of the witnesses with Oliver Cowdery and David  Whitmer. Much supplication was offered by these three men; and Joseph  prayed to the Lord on their behalf. Soon the Prophet received a reply  that through prayer and humility, Oliver and David and Martin should  witness this manifestation of the power of God; that they should view  the plates of gold upon which were written the sacred records; that  they should see the Urim and Thummim--the breast-plate of gold, and  also the seer-stones which were given to the brother of Jared upon  the mount, when he talked with the Lord face to face; and that they  should be permitted to behold the sword of Laban, which Nephi carried  away from Jerusalem. After this promise was given in a revelation  through the Prophet, he and his three fellow-servants, Oliver Cowdery,  David Whitmer and Martin Harris, withdrew into a retired spot in the  woods, and there bowed themselves in humble prayer. Joseph first  offered a supplication to the Lord and he was followed by the others  in succession; all asking that the witnesses might be purified and  forgiven before Heaven and be permitted to view the plates and the  other treasures. At first they received no manifestation of Divine  favor; and they contritely and fervently repeated their solicitations.  Still there came no answer. Martin Harris then arose and confessed  that his presence was the cause of their failure. He said that he  realized, through the whispering of the Spirit, that his presence  was objectionable because of the sins he had formerly committed, and  that the Lord designed this as a rebuke to him and an admonition that  he must continue to humble himself before Heaven. He proposed that  he should withdraw to a little distance, beyond the sight of his  companions, and engage in silent prayer; while they should continue  their joint supplications for the favor of God.    After Martin was gone, the others knelt down again and engaged once  more in prayer. While they were beseeching the Heavens, a light of  exceeding brightness changed the shadowed air above their heads into  wondrous brilliancy, and soon descended around about them. Within a  pillar of radiance stood the angel holding the treasures in his hands.  He turned over the leaves of the unsealed portion of the record one by  one, and displayed to the gaze of Oliver and David the golden plates.  So bright was the light that they could plainly discern the engraved  characters. The angel also showed to them the other promised treasures.  While the light was still about them, the voice of Heaven declared to  them the divinity of the work of which they were the witnesses. And  after they had been admonished to be forever faithful to the testimony  bestowed upon them, the vision withdrew.    Joseph left Oliver and David engaged in thanksgiving to God for His  infinite mercy, while he hastened away to find Martin Harris. At a  little distance, still within the wood, Joseph discovered Martin  praying hopelessly. He had not been able to obtain an answer to his  supplication, and he earnestly entreated Joseph to join with him in  his appeal to the Lord. Meekly they prayed to God; and at length came  an answer in the renewal of the vision. Once more the holy personage  descended in dazzling brightness and exhibited to Martin the plates and  the other treasures as they had been shown to Oliver and David. And  again the voice of Heaven gave testimony and admonition. So great was  the glory of the vision that Martin Harris had not strength to long  sustain his ecstasy; and he fell upon his face, crying,    \"It is enough! Mine eyes have beheld of the glories of God!\"    All the witnesses then returned with the Prophet to the house of  Peter Whitmer. Later they gave to the world the testimony which has  since gone forth with the Book of Mormon: declaring to all nations,  kindreds, tongues and people that through the grace of God the Eternal  Father and His Son Jesus Christ, they had seen the plates containing  the holy record; that an angel of God came down from Heaven and laid  before their eyes the plates; that they beheld the engraving thereon;  and that the voice of God had declared unto them for a surety that the  holy record was true and had been faithfully translated; and to this  testimony they added the solemn words:        \"We know that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our      garments of the blood of all men and be found spotless before the      Judgment Seat of Christ, and shall dwell eternally with Him in the      Heavens.\"    The great happiness which the three witnesses experienced in thus  being permitted to view the sacred treasure, and the great desire they  evinced from this hour to aid the work of the Lord, made Joseph anxious  that others who were worthy might, in part at least, participate in  that blessing. He therefore obtained permission from the Lord, to show  the plates of gold to eight other faithful persons: Christian Whitmer,  Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer, Jr., John Whitmer, Hiram Page, Joseph  Smith, Sen., Hyrum Smith and Samuel H. Smith. And these men also gave  to the world a testimony which has linked their names forever with the  Book of Mormon and the cause of Christ. They saw, and testified to  seeing, the plates of gold and the engravings of curious workmanship  upon them. And they closed their simple declaration with these words:        \"And we give our names unto the world to witness unto the world      that which we have seen; and we lie not, God bearing witness of it.\"    At length the translation was completed, and Joseph and his friends  arranged to have the book printed. A contract was made with Egbert B.  Grandin, of Palmyra, Wayne County, New York. And soon this sublime  work, which details the history of the peoples who anciently inhabited  the continents of North and South America; which describes the dealings  of God with the nations of the past upon these lands; and which  recounts the ministrations of Christ in this part of His vineyard after  His crucifixion at Jerusalem, was opened to the gaze of the world. It  is a marvelous book and a wonder. Its pages portray the history of  powerful nations which flourished for hundreds and even thousands of  years; and yet, despite the brevity of the work, this history is more  complete and graphic than any that was ever penned by the unaided hand  of man. The book also contains a record of a sublime system of religion  and religious government, as perfect as any enjoyed by man upon this  earth.    After the work of translation was ended, Joseph recommitted his charge  to the care of the Angel of the record; and Moroni received it back  into his keeping, to bring forth the yet unsealed portions of it only  when God shall so decree.    Joseph, and Oliver under the Prophet's direction, labored assiduously  to spread the truth among the people. And, though the"]]]
