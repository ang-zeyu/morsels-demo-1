As I could not find the outer door, I led my horse  successively into every room in the house.    There is no furniture such as we use in a typical Spanish dwelling, no  bedsteads, tables, or chairs. The inmates squat on divans arranged on  the floor around the walls of the rooms, and at nighttime they spread  their bedding on the floors. Some of the rooms were nicely carpeted  with Mexican rugs. My horse must have thought he had come to a suite of  stables, for he acted accordingly. He nosed around after grain and hay,  whinnied and pawed, and seemed to enjoy himself generally. At last I  found the right door, came out into the street and rode to the church  to tender my best wishes to the happy couple and bid them adios. When  the party emerged from the chapel they seemed to be very much surprised  at seeing me. I told my host that I regretted to leave them so early in  the day, but had an appointment to keep elsewhere. I would ride slowly  out of town so that they could overtake me easily, should they wish to  see me later, but nobody came, and after several hours I caught up with  my companions.          CHAPTER VIII.    WITH THE NAVAJO TRIBE      After a couple of days we came to Fort Wingate, which controls the  Navajo Indian Reservation. We camped here for a day to have some repair  work done to our wagons, and I took a stroll over the hills after  rabbits and returned to camp at nightfall. Don Juan told me that he had  been visited by a number of Indians, who had bartered him some blankets  and buckskins and he was highly pleased thereat.    The next morning we started early and traveled until noon. Several  Indians had been following us for some time, and as soon as we made  camp they squatted at our fire, while others were continually arriving,  some afoot, but most of them on horseback. Manuelito, a grand-looking  chief, rode into camp on the finest Indian pony I had ever seen. It was  beautifully caparisoned; the saddle, bridle, and trappings were covered  with silver mountings. This was by far the most gorgeously dressed  Navajo I had ever met. He wore tight-fitting knickerbockers of  jet-black buckskin, which resembled velvet, with a double row of silver  buttons, set as close as possible on the outward seams, from top to  bottom. On his legs from knee to ankle he wore homespun woolen  stockings and his feet were covered by beaded moccasins of yellow,  smoke-tanned buckskin. His bright red calico shirt was literally  covered with silver ornaments and his ears were pierced with heavy  silver rings, at least three inches in diameter. His wrists and arms  were heavy with massive silver bracelets and others, carved from a  stone, which resembled jade. About his neck he wore strings of wampum  and glass beads, garnets, and bits of turquoise. The turquoise and  garnet is found here in places known only to these Indians. His fingers  were encircled by many rings, but the finest ornament he possessed was  his body belt of great disks of silver, the size of tea saucers. All  this jewelry was of a fair workmanship, such as is made by Navajo  silversmiths out of coin silver. In fact, these Indians prefer silver  to gold for purposes of personal adornment. The blanket which this  Indian wore around his waist was worth at least two hundred dollars;  never have I seen its equal in beauty of pattern and texture.    The chief dismounted and withdrew with Don Juan behind a wagon for a  talk, as I presumed. They reappeared soon, and the chief mounted his  steed and cavorted around our camp as one possessed. Furiously lashing  his horse, he scattered our cooking utensils and acted in a most  provoking manner generally. I noticed then that the noble chief was  intoxicated, and when I questioned Don Juan sharply, he admitted that  he had given the Indian some whiskey, and on the day before as well. I  warned the Don to have no further dealings with these Indians and  advised him to break camp at once in order to avoid trouble. I informed  him also that he had committed a serious crime by selling liquor to  Indians and that he was liable to be arrested at any time should a  patrol from the fort happen our way. As the Mexican was frightened now,  we took to the road in a hurry and traveled until a late hour that  night. In fact, we did not stop until the cattle were exhausted.    Hardly had we prepared our camp and were sitting around our fire, when  a horde of Indians appeared, clamoring for whiskey. As they were armed  and threatening, Don Juan became so terrified that he climbed to the  interior of a wagon to comply with the demand of the savages. When I  saw this, I drew my rifle from its place under my bedding and placed it  in readiness. Plainly I saw Don Juan come out of the wagon with the  mischievous stone jug, as this happened in the bright light of our camp  fire. That will never do, thought I, and quickly drawing my revolver, I  persuaded the Don to drop the jug, incidentally smashing it with a 44  caliber bullet, taking care not to hurt anybody; and this was easily  done, as the jug was a large one, it held three gallons.  Instantaneously I grabbed my Winchester, and with my back against a  wagon stood ready for action. The Indians uttered a howl of  disappointment when they saw the jug collapse and its precious contents  wasted, but were silenced by an exclamation of their chief. After an  excited pow-wow between themselves, they disappeared among the hills in  the shadows of the night.    \"Muchas gracias, senor Americana,\" said Don Juan, \"quien sabe?\" What  would have happened if the Indians had gotten the liquor, which I dared  not refuse them; but I think this ends our troubles. We passed a  sleepless night, and long before sunrise Don Juan made preparations for  our departure.    When the herders rounded up the cattle, they found that several yoke of  oxen were missing, and greatly alarmed, they said that they believed  the Indians had stolen them during the night. Don Juan did not appear  to be very anxious to search for the missing cattle himself, so he sent  out the herders again after breakfast. They returned with the report of  having found the tracks of Indians who had apparently driven the cattle  toward the hills, and stated that they were afraid to follow, fearing  for their lives.    As it was nearly noon by this time, we cooked our dinner, and while  doing so were visited again by a number of the Indians. Don Juan  intimated to them that several of his oxen had strayed off during the  night, and the Navajos kindly offered to go in search of them for a  remuneration. They demanded a stack of tortillas a foot high and a sack  of flour. Nolens-volens, squatted Don Mestal before the fire and baked  bread for the wily Indians as a ransom for his cattle. Of course then  the missing oxen were soon brought up, and we lost no time in getting  under way.    Until midnight we traveled, as Don Juan was very anxious to get away  from the reservation of these Indians, which is seventy-five miles  across. This night we experienced a repetition of the tactics of the  night before, as regarded the safety of our herd, but Don Juan had to  pay a higher ransom in the morning. While we were awaiting the arrival  of the Indians with our lost steers, Chief Manuelito honored us again  with his presence. He sat down at our fire, and producing a greasy deck  of Spanish playing cards, he challenged Don Juan to a game of monte.  That was an irresistible temptation for my companion. By the smiling  expression of his wizened features I divined that he thought he saw his  chance for revenge. Manuelito undoubtedly had a strain of sporting  blood in his veins, as he offered to stake his horses, blankets,  squaws, and everything he had against the Mexican's wagons and cargo. I  warned Don Juan to have a care, as I knew the cunning of the Navajo  tribe, having dealt with them before, and advised him to play the traps  he had bought from them with liquor against a chipper little squaw who  was richly dressed and had come with Chief Manuelito, mounted on a  white pony. I believed her to be the chief's daughter. When she  understood the import of the conversation, she looked haughtily and in  a disdainful manner at Don Juan, but appeared to be pleased with me and  eyed me with symptoms of curiosity. Of course, I expected her to defy  Don Juan to take her, and simply ride off in case he should win the  game. At any rate, I meant to take her under my protection, if  necessary, and send her home to her people. In fact, the liquor which  Don Juan had sold these Indians had belonged to me and had been  presented to me by a friend as an antidote for possible snake bites on  the road to Arizona.    The gambling began, and my Mexican companions became so engrossed in  the enjoyment of their alluring national game of monte that they forgot  everything else. The drivers were as interested as their employer and  bet the poor trinkets they possessed on the result of the game. There  arrived more Indians continually, and I observed a familiar face  amongst these and saw that I myself was recognized. The game was ended  as I had foreseen, with Don Juan as the loser. He was an easy prey for  these Indians, who are as full of tricks as the ocean is of water.    Then Chief Manuelito, who was highly elated with his victory over the  Mexican, challenged me to a game in a very overbearing and provoking  manner. I replied that I despised the game of monte, which was perhaps  good enough for Mexicans and Indians, but was decided by chance; I  boasted that I was ready to bet anything I had on my skill at shooting  with the rifle, and challenged him and his whole tribe to the sport  which was worthy of men, a shooting match. I think Manuelito would have  accepted my challenge without hesitation and in great glee if he had  not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43008"],[0,"Around the Yule Log (#12)"],[1,"party, and he was quietly enjoying the thought  of making them happy on the morrow.    By a preconcerted plan he met Mrs. Brownlow under the great golden  eagle at the corner of Summer and Washington streets; and, having thus  joined forces, the two proceeded in company toward a certain wholesale  toy-shop where Mr. Brownlow was acquainted, and where they expected to  secure such small articles as they desired, at dozen rates.    And now Mr. Brownlow realized what must have been his wife's exertions  during the last fortnight. For having gallantly relieved her of her  carpetbag, and offered his unoccupied arm for her support, he was  constantly engaged in a struggle to maintain his hold upon either one  or the other of his charges, and rescuing them with extreme difficulty  from the crowd. At one time he was simultaneously attacked at both  vulnerable points, a very stout woman persisting in thrusting herself  between him and his already bulging carpetbag, on the one hand, and an  equally persistent old gentleman engaged in separating Mrs. Brownlow  from him, on the other. With flushed but determined face he held on to  both with all his might, when a sudden stampede, to avoid a passing  team, brought such a violent pressure upon him that he found both  Clarissa and bag dragged from him, while he himself was borne at least  a rod away before he could stem the tide. Fortunately, the stout woman  immediately fell over the bag, and Mr. Brownlow, having by this means  identified the spot where it lay, hewed his way, figuratively  speaking, to his wife and bore her off triumphantly. At last, to the  relief of both, they reached the entrance of the toy-dealer's huge  store. Mr. Brownlow at once hunted up his friend, and all three set  about a tour of the premises.    It was beyond doubt a wonderful place. A little retail shop, in the  Christmas holidays, is of itself a marvel; but this immense  establishment, at the back doors of which stood wagons constantly  receiving cases on cases of goods directed to all parts of the  country, was quite another thing. Such long passageways there were,  walled in from floor to ceiling with boxes of picture-blocks, labeled  in German; such mysterious, gloomy alcoves, by the sides of which  lurked innumerable wild animals with glaring eyes and rigid tails;  such fleets of Noah's arks, wherein were bestowed the patriarch's  whole family (in tight-fitting garments of yellow and red) and  specimens of all creation, so promiscuously packed together that it  must have been extremely depressing to all concerned; such a delicious  smell of sawdust and paint and wax; in short such presentation of Toy  in the abstract, and Toy in particular, and Toy overhead, and  underfoot, and in the very air,--could never have existed outside of  Cottlow & Co.'s, Manufacturers, Dealers, and Importers of Toys.    Mrs. Brownlow was fairly at her wits' end to choose. When she meekly  inquired for tin soldiers, solid regiments of them sprang up, like  Jason's armed men, at her bidding. At the suggestion of a doll, the  world seemed suddenly and solely peopled with these little creatures,  and winking, crying, walking and talking dolls crowded about the  bewildered customers,--dolls with flaxen hair, and dolls with no hair  at all; dolls of imposing proportions when viewed in front, but of no  thickness to speak of, when held sideways; dolls as rigid as mummies,  and dolls who exhibited an alarming tendency to double their arms and  legs up backward. To add to the confusion, the air was filled with the  noise of trumpets, drums, musical boxes and other instruments, which  were being tested in various parts of the building, until poor Mrs.  Brownlow declared she should go distracted. At length, however, she  and her husband, with the assistance of their polite friend,  succeeded in selecting two or three dozen small gifts, and, when the  last purchase was concluded, started for home.    After a walk of ten minutes, they reached Boylston Market, where they  were at once beset by venders of evergreen and holly wreaths, crosses  and stars of every description. Mr. Brownlow bought half a dozen of  the cheaper sort of wreaths, which the owner kindly threaded upon his  arm, as if they were a sort of huge, fragrant beads. Then he selected  a tree, and, after a short consultation with Mrs. Brownlow, decided to  carry it home himself, to save a quarter. A horse-car opportunely  passing, they boarded it, Mrs. Brownlow and her bag being with some  difficulty squeezed in through the rear door, and Mr. Brownlow taking  his stand upon the front platform, from which the tree, which had been  tightly tied up, projected like a bowsprit, until they reached home.    Great was the bustle at 17 Elm Street that night. Parcels were  unwrapped; the whole house was pleasantly redolent of boiling  molasses; and from the kitchen there came at the same time a scratchy  and poppy sound, denoting the preparation of mounds of feathery corn.  Bob and his father took upon themselves the uprearing of the tree. On  being carried to the parlor it was found to be at least three feet too  long, and Mr. Brownlow, in his shirt-sleeves, accomplished wonders  with a saw, smearing himself in the process with pitch, from head to  foot.    The tree seemed at first inclined to be sulky, perhaps at having been  decapitated and curtailed; for it obstinately leaned backward, kicked  over the soapbox in which it was set, bumped against Mr. Brownlow,  tumbled forward, and in short, behaved itself like a tree which was  determined to lie on its precious back all the next day, or perish in  the attempt. At length, just as they were beginning to despair of ever  getting it firm and straight, it gave a little quiver of its limbs,  yielded gracefully to a final push by Bob, and stood upright, as fair  and comely a Christmas tree as one would wish to see. Mr. Brownlow  crept out backward from under the lower branches, (thereby throwing  his hair into the wildest confusion and adding more pitch to himself),  and regarded it with a sigh of content. Such presents as were to be  disposed of in this way were now hung upon the branches; then strings  of pop-corn, bits of wool, and glistening paper, a few red apples, and  lastly the candles. When all was finished, which was not before  midnight, the family withdrew to their beds, with weary limbs and  brains, but with light-hearted anticipation of to-morrow.    \"Do you s'pose Mrs. Bright will come with her children, John?\" asked  Mrs. Brownlow, as she turned out the gas.    \"Shouldn't--wonder\"--sleepily from the four-poster.    \"Did Mr. Bright say anything about the invitation we sent, when he  paid you off?\"    Silence. More silence. Good Mr. Brownlow was asleep, and Clarissa soon  followed him.    Meanwhile the snow, which had been falling fast during the early part  of the evening, had ceased, leaving the earth as fair to look upon as  the fleece-drifted sky above it. Slowly the heavy banks of cloud  rolled away, disclosing star after star, until the moon itself looked  down, and sent a soft \"Merry Christmas\" to mankind. At last came the  dawn, with a glorious burst of sunlight and church-bells and glad  voices, ushering in the gladdest and dearest day of all the year.    The Brownlows were early astir, full of the joyous spirit of the day.  There was a clamor of Christmas greetings, and a delighted medley of  shouts from the children over the few simple gifts that had been  secretly laid aside for them. But the ruling thought in every heart  was the party. It was to come off at five o'clock in the afternoon,  when it would be just dark enough to light the candles on the tree.    In spite of all the hard work of the preceding days, there was not a  moment to spare that forenoon. The house, as the head of the family  facetiously remarked, was a perfect hive of B's.    As the appointed hour drew near, their nervousness increased. The  children had been scrubbed from top to toe, and dressed in their very  best clothes; Mrs. Brownlow wore a cap with lavender ribbons, which  she had a misgiving were too gaudy for a person of her sedate years.  Nor was the excitement confined to the interior of the house. The  tree was placed in the front parlor, close to the window, and by  half-past four a dozen ragged children were gathered about the iron  fence of the little front yard, gazing open-mouthed and open-eyed at  the spectacular wonders within. At a quarter before five Mrs.  Brownlow's heart beat hard every time she heard a strange footstep in  their quiet street. It was a little odd that none of the guests had  arrived; but then, it was fashionable to be late!    Ten minutes more passed. Still no arrivals. It was evident that each  was planning not to be the first to get there, and that they would all  descend on the house and assault the door-bell at once. Mrs. Brownlow  repeatedly smoothed the wrinkles out of her tidy apron, and Mr.  Brownlow began to perspire with responsibility.    Meanwhile the crowd outside, recognizing no rigid bonds of etiquette,  rapidly increased in numbers. Mr. Brownlow, to pass the time and  please the poor little homeless creatures, lighted two of the candles.    The response from the front-yard fence was immediate. A low murmur of  delight ran along the line, and several dull-eyed babies were hoisted,  in the arms of babies scarcely older than themselves, to behold the  rare vision of candles in a tree, just illumining the further  splendors glistening here and there among the branches.    The kind man's heart warmed towards them, and he lighted two more  candles. The delight of the audience could now hardly be restrained,  and the babies, having been temporarily lowered by the aching little  arms of their respective nurses, were shot up once more to view the  redoubled grandeur.    The whole family had become so much interested in these small outcasts  that they had not noticed the flight "]]]
