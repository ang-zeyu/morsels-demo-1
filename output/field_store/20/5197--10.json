Edward started  the practice of King's touching people to cure them of scrofula, a  disease which affected the glands, especially in the head and  neck. It was done in the context of a religious ceremony.    The main governmental activities were: war, collection of revenue,  religious education, and administration of justice. For war, the  shires had to provide a certain number of men and the ports quotas  of ships with crews. The king was the patron of the English  church. He gave the church peace and protection. He presided over  church councils and appointed bishops. As for the administration  of justice, the public courts were almost all under members of  Edward's court, bishops, earls, and reeves. Edward's mind was  often troubled and disturbed by the threat that law and justice  would be overthrown, by the pervasiveness of disputes and discord,  by the raging of wicked presumption, by money interfering with  right and justice, and by avarice kindling all of these. He saw it  as his duty to courageously oppose the wicked by taking good men  as models, by enriching the churches of God, by relieving those  oppressed by wicked judges, and by judging equitably between the  powerful and the humble. He was so greatly revered that a comet  was thought to accompany his death.    The king established the office of the Chancery to draft documents  and keep records. It created the writ, which was a small piece of  parchment addressed to a royal official or dependent commanding  him to perform some task for the King. By the 1000s A.D., the writ  contained a seal: a lump of wax with the impress of the Great Seal  of England which hung from the bottom of the document. Writing was  done with a sharpened goose-wing quill. Ink was obtained from  mixing fluid from the galls made by wasps for their eggs on oak  trees, rainwater or vinegar, gum arabic, and iron salts for color.    A King's grant of land entailed two documents: a charter giving  boundaries and conditions and a writ, usually addressed to the  shire court, listing the judicial and financial privileges  conveyed with the land. These were usually sac and soke  [possession of jurisdiction of a private court of a noble or  institution to execute the laws and administer justice over  inhabitants and tenants of the estate], toll [right to have a  market and to collect a payment on the sale of cattle and other  property on the estate] and team [probably the right to hold a  court to determine the honesty of a man accused of illegal  possession of cattle or of buying stolen cattle by inquiring of  the alleged seller or a warrantor, even if an outsider], and  infangenetheof  [the authority to hang and take the chattels of a  thief caught on the estate].    The town of Coventry consisted of a large monastery estate and a  large private estate headed by a lord. The monastery was granted  by Edward the Confessor full freedom and these jurisdictions: sac  and soke, toll and team, hamsocne [the authority to fine a person  for breaking into and making entry by force into the dwelling of  another], forestall [the authority to fine a person for robbing  others on the road], bloodwite [the authority to impose a  forfeiture for assault involving bloodshed], fightwite [the  authority to fine for fighting], weordwite [the authority to fine  for manslaughter, but not for willful murder], and mundbryce [the  authority to fine for any breach of the peace, such as trespass on  lands].    Every man was expected to have a lord to whom he gave fealty. He  swore by this fealty oath: \"By the Lord, before whom this relic is  holy, I will be to ------ faithful and true, and love all that he  loves, and shun all that he shuns, according to God's law, and  according to the world's principle, and never, by will nor by  force, by word nor by work, do ought of  what is loathful to him;  on condition that he keep me as I am willing to deserve, and all  that fulfill that our agreement was, when I to him submitted and  chose his will.\"  If a man was homeless or lordless, his brothers  were expected to find him such, e.g. in the folkmote. Otherwise,  he as to be treated as a fugitive, and could be slain as for a  thief, and anyone who had harbored him would pay a penalty.  Brothers were also expected to protect their minor kinsmen.    Marriages were determined by men asking women to marry them. If a  woman said yes, he paid a sum to her kin for her \"mund\"  [jurisdiction or protection over her] and gave his oath to them to  maintain and support the woman and any children born. As security  for this oath, he gave a valuable object or \"wed\". The couple were  then betrothed. Marriage ceremonies were performed by priests in  churches. The groom had to bring friends to his wedding as  sureties to guarantee his oath to maintain and support his wife  and children. Those who swore to take care of the children were  called their \"godfathers\". The marriage was written into church  records. After witnessing the wedding, friends ate the great loaf,  or first bread made by the bride. This was the forerunner of the  wedding cake. They drank special ale, the \"bride ale\" (from hence  the work \"bridal\"), to the health of the couple.    Women could own land, houses, and furniture and other property.  They could even make wills that disinherited their sons. This  marriage agreement with an Archbishop's sister provides her with  land, money, and horsemen:    \"Here in this document is stated the agreement which Wulfric and  the archbishop made when he obtained the archbishop's sister as  his wife, namely he promised her the estates at Orleton and  Ribbesford for her lifetime, and promised her that he would obtain  the estate at Knightwick for her for three lives from the  community at Winchcombe, and gave her the estate at Alton to grant  and bestow upon whomsoever she pleased during her lifetime or at  her death, as she preferred, and promised her 50 mancuses of gold  and 30 men and 30 horses.    The witnesses that this agreement was made as stated were  Archbishop Wulfstan and Earl Leofwine and Bishop AEthelstan and  Abbot AElfweard and the monk Brihtheah and many good men in  addition to them, both ecclesiastics and laymen. There are two  copies of this agreement, one in the possession of the archbishop  at Worcester and the other in the possession of Bishop AEthelstan  at Hereford.\"    This marriage agreement provided the wife with money, land, farm  animals and farm laborers; it also names sureties, the survivor of  whom would receive all this property:    \"Here is declared in this document the agreement which Godwine  made with Brihtric when he wooed his daughter. In the first place  he gave her a pound's weight of gold, to induce her to accept his  suit, and he granted her the estate at Street with all that  belongs to it, and 150 acres at Burmarsh and in addition 30 oxen  and 20 cows and 10 horses and 10 slaves.    This agreement was made at Kingston before King Cnut, with the  cognizance of Archbishop Lyfing and the community at Christchurch,  and Abbot AElfmaer and the community at St. Augustine's, and the  sheriff AEthelwine and Sired the old and Godwine, Wulfheah's son,  and AElfsige cild and Eadmaer of Burham and Godwine, Wulfstan's  son, and Carl, the King's cniht. And when the maiden was brought  from Brightling AElfgar, Sired's son, and Frerth, the priest of  Forlstone, and the priests Leofwine and Wulfsige from Dover, and  Edred, Eadhelm's son, and Leofwine, Waerhelm's son, and Cenwold  rust and Leofwine, son of Godwine of Horton, and Leofwine the Red  and Godwine, Eadgifu's son, and Leofsunu his brother acted as  security for all this. And whichever of them lives the longer  shall succeed to all the property both in land and everything else  which I have given them. Every trustworthy man in Kent and Sussex,  whether thegn or commoner, is cognizant of these terms.    There are three of these documents; one is at Christchurch,  another at St. Augustine's, and Brihtric himself has the third.\"    Nuns and monks lived in segregated nunneries and monasteries on  church land and grew their own food. The local bishop usually was  also an abbot of a monastery. The priests and nuns wore long robes  with loose belts and did not carry weapons. Their life was ordered  by the ringing of the bell to start certain activities, such as  prayer; meals; meetings; work in the fields, gardens, or  workshops; and copying and illuminating books. They chanted to pay  homage and to communicate with God or his saints. They taught  justice, piety, chastity, peace, and charity; and cared for the  sick. Caring for the sick entailed mostly praying to God as it was  thought that only God could cure. They bathed a few times a year.  They got their drinking water from upstream of where they had  located their latrines over running water. The large monasteries  had libraries, dormitories, guesthouses, kitchens, butteries to  store wine, bakehouses, breweries, dairies, granaries, barns,  fishponds, orchards, vineyards, gardens, workshops, laundries,  lavatories with long stone or marble washing troughs, and towels.  Slavery was diminished by the church by excommunication for the  sale of a child over seven. The clergy taught that manumission of  slaves was good for the soul of the dead, so it became frequent in  wills. The clergy were to abstain from red meat and wine and were  to be celibate. But there were periods of laxity. Punishment was  by the cane or scourge.    The Archbishop of Canterbury began anointing new kings at the time  of coronation to emphasize that the king was ruler by the grace of  God. As God's minister, the king could only do right. From 973,  the new king swore to protect the Christian church, to prevent  inequities to all subjects, and to render good justice, which  became a standard oath.    There was a celestial hierarchy, with heavenly hosts in specific  places.

Then Lenawee entered the circle. \"Lenawee is a blighted flower,\"  she sobbed. \"Let her blood flow for her people.\" And catching a knife  from the Prophet's belt, she ran with it to the stream on which she and  the Arrow had so often floated in their canoe. In another moment her  blood had bedewed the earth. \"Lay me with the Arrow,\" she murmured, and,  smiling in their sad faces, breathed her last. The demon of the quick  death shrank from the spot, and the Great Spirit smiled once more on the  tribe that could produce such heroism. Lenawee's body was placed beside  her lover's, and next morning, where her blood had spilt, the ground was  pure, and on it grew in slender spires a new flower,--the Indian plume:  the transformed blood of sacrifice. The people loved that flower in all  years after. They decked their hair and dresses with it and made a feast  in its honor. When parents taught their children the beauty of  unselfishness they used as its emblem a stalk of Indian plume.          BIRTH OF THE WATER-LILY    Back from his war against the Tahawi comes the Sun, chief of the Lower  Saranacs,--back to the Lake of the Clustered Stars, afterward called, by  dullards, Tupper's Lake. Tall and invincible he comes among his people,  boasting of his victories, Indian fashion, and stirring the scalps that  hang at his breast. \"The Eagle screams,\" he cries. \"He greets the chief,  the Blazing Sun. Wayotah has made the Tahawi tremble. They fly from him.  Hooh, hooh! He is the chief.\" Standing apart with wistful glance stands  Oseetah, the Bird. She loves the strong young chief, but she knows that  another has his promise, and she dares not hope; yet the chief loves her,  and when the feasting is over he follows her footprints to the shore,  where he sees her canoe turning the point of an island. He silently  pursues and comes upon her as she sits waving and moaning. He tries to  embrace her, but she draws apart. He asks her to sing to him; she bids  him begone.    He takes a more imperious tone and orders her to listen to her chief. She  moves away. He darts toward her. Turning on him a face of sorrow, she  runs to the edge of a steep rock and waves him back. He hastens after.  Then she springs and disappears in the deep water. The Sun plunges after  her and swims with mad strength here and there. He calls. There is no  answer. Slowly he returns to the village and tells the people what has  happened. The Bird's parents are stricken and the Sun moans in his sleep.  At noon a hunter comes in with strange tidings: flowers are growing on  the water! The people go to their canoes and row to the Island of Elms.  There, in a cove, the still water is enamelled with flowers, some as  white as snow, filling the air with perfume, others strong and yellow,  like the lake at sunset.    \"Explain to us,\" they cry, turning to the old Medicine of his tribe, \"for  this was not so yesterday.\"    \"It is our daughter,\" he answered. \"These flowers are the form she  takes. The white is her purity, the yellow her love. You shall see that  her heart will close when the sun sets, and will reopen at his coming.\"  And the young chief went apart and bowed his head.          ROGERS'S SLIDE    The shores of Lakes George and Champlain were ravaged by war. Up and down  those lovely waters swept the barges of French and English, and the green  hills rang to the shrill of bugles, the boom of cannon, and the yell of  savages. Fiction and history have been weft across the woods and the  memory of deeds still echoes among the heights. It was at Glen's Falls,  in the cave on the rock in the middle of the river, that the brave Uncas  held the watch with Hawkeye. Bloody Defile and Bloody Pond, between there  and Lake George, take their names from the \"Bloody morning scout\" sent  out by Sir William Johnson on a September day in 1755 to check Dieskau  until Fort William Henry could be completed. In the action that ensued,  Colonel Williams, founder of Williams College, and Captain Grant, of the  Connecticut line, great-grandfather of the President who bore that name,  were killed. The victims, dead and wounded alike, having been flung into  Bloody Pond, it was thick and red for days, and tradition said that in  after years it resumed its hue of crimson at sunset and held it until  dawn. The captured, who were delivered to the Indians, had little to  hope, for their white allies could not stay their savagery. Blind Rock  was so called because the Indians brought a white man there, and tearing  his eyes out, flung them into embers at the foot of the stone. Captives  were habitually tortured, blazing splinters of pine being thrust into  their flesh, their nails torn out, and their bodies slashed with knives  before they went to the stake. An English prisoner was allowed to run the  gauntlet here. They had already begun to strike at him as he sped between  the lines, when he seized a pappoose, flung it on a fire, and, in the  instant of confusion that followed, snatched an axe, cut the bonds of a  comrade who had been doomed to die, and both escaped.    But the best-known history of this region is that of Rogers's Rock, or  Rogers's Slide, a lofty precipice at the lower end of Lake George. Major  Rogers did not toboggan down this rock in leather trousers, but his  escape was no less remarkable than if he had. On March 13, 1758, while  reconnoitring near Ticonderoga with two hundred rangers, he was surprised  by a force of French and Indians. But seventeen of his men escaped death  or capture, and he was pursued nearly to the brink of this cliff. During  a brief delay among the red men, arising from the loss of his trail, he  had time to throw his pack down the slide, reverse his snow-shoes, and go  back over his own track to the head of a ravine before they emerged from  the woods, and, seeing that his shoe-marks led to the rock, while none  pointed back, they concluded that he had flung himself off and committed  suicide to avoid capture. Great was their disappointment when they saw  the major on the frozen surface of the lake beneath going at a lively  rate toward Fort William Henry. He had gained the ice by way of the cleft  in the rocks, but the savages, believing that he had leaped over the  precipice, attributed his preservation to the Great Spirit and forbore to  fire on him. Unconsciously, he had chosen the best possible place to  disappear from, for the Indians held it in superstitious regard,  believing that spirits haunted the wood and hurled bad souls down the  cliff, drowning them in the lake, instead of allowing them to go to the  happy hunting grounds. The major reached his quarters in safety, and  lived to take up arms against the land of his birth when the colonies  revolted, seventeen years later.          THE FALLS AT COHOES    When Occuna, a young Seneca, fell in love with a girl whose cabin was  near the present town of Cohoes, he behaved very much as Americans of a  later date have done. He picked wild flowers for her; he played on the  bone pipe and sang sentimental songs in the twilight; he roamed the hills  with her, gathering the loose quartz crystals that the Indians believed  to be the tears of stricken deer, save on Diamond Rock, in Lansingburgh,  where they are the tears of Moneta, a bereaved mother and wife; and in  fine weather they went boating on the Mohawk above the rapids. They liked  to drift idly on the current, because it gave them time to gaze into each  other's eyes, and to build air castles that they would live in in the  future. They were suddenly called to a realization of danger one evening,  for the stream had been subtly drawing them on and on until it had them  in its power. The stroke of the paddle failed and the air castles fell in  dismal ruin. Sitting erect they began their death-song in this wise:    Occuna: \"Daughter of a mighty warrior, the Manitou calls me hence. I hear  the roaring of his voice; I see the lightning of his glance along the  river; he walks in clouds and spray upon the waters.\"    The Maiden: \"Thou art thyself a warrior, O Occuna. Hath not thine axe  been often bathed in blood? Hath the deer ever escaped thine arrow or the  beaver avoided thy chase? Thou wilt not fear to go into the presence of  Manitou.\"    Occuna: \"Manitou, indeed, respects the strong. When I chose thee from the  women of our tribe I promised that we should live and die together. The  Thunderer calls us now. Welcome, O ghost of Oriska, chief of the  invincible Senecas! A warrior and the daughter of a warrior come to join  you in the feast of the blessed!\"    The boat leaped over the falls, and Occuna, striking on the rocks below,  was killed at once; but, as by a miracle, the girl fell clear of them and  was whirled on the seething current to shoal water, where she made her  escape. For his strength and his virtues the dead man was canonized. His  tribe raised him above the regions of the moon, whence he looked down on  the scenes of his youth with pleasure, and in times of war gave pleasant  dreams and promises to his friends, while he confused the enemy with evil  omens. Whenever his tribe passed the falls they halted and with brief  ceremonials commemorated the death of Occuna.          FRANCIS WOOLCOTT'S NIGHT-RIDERS    In Copake, New York, among the Berkshire Hills, less than a century ago,  lived Francis Woolcott, a dark, tall man, with protruding teeth, whose  sinister laugh used to give his neighbors a creep along their spines. He  had no obvious trade or calling, but the farmers feared him so that he  had no trouble in making levies: pork, flour, meal, cider, he could have  what he chose for the asking, for had he not halted horses at the plow so  that neither blows nor commands could move"]]]
