In this particular, though great superiority is observable  of one man above another; yet none are so entirely indifferent to the  interest of their fellow-creatures, as to perceive no distinctions  of moral good and evil, in consequence of the different tendencies of  actions and principles. How, indeed, can we suppose it possible in any  one, who wears a human heart, that if there be subjected to his censure,  one character or system of conduct, which is beneficial, and another  which is pernicious to his species or community, he will not so much  as give a cool preference to the former, or ascribe to it the smallest  merit or regard? Let us suppose such a person ever so selfish; let  private interest have ingrossed ever so much his attention; yet in  instances, where that is not concerned, he must unavoidably feel SOME  propensity to the good of mankind, and make it an object of choice, if  everything else be equal. Would any man, who is walking along, tread as  willingly on another's gouty toes, whom he has no quarrel with, as on  the hard flint and pavement? There is here surely a difference in the  case. We surely take into consideration the happiness and misery of  others, in weighing the several motives of action, and incline to the  former, where no private regards draw us to seek our own promotion or  advantage by the injury of our fellow-creatures. And if the principles  of humanity are capable, in many instances, of influencing our actions,  they must, at all times, have some authority over our sentiments, and  give us a general approbation of what is useful to society, and blame of  what is dangerous or pernicious. The degrees of these sentiments may  be the subject of controversy; but the reality of their existence, one  should think, must be admitted in every theory or system.    A creature, absolutely malicious and spiteful, were there any such in  nature, must be worse than indifferent to the images of vice and virtue.  All his sentiments must be inverted, and directly opposite to those,  which prevail in the human species. Whatever contributes to the good of  mankind, as it crosses the constant bent of his wishes and desires, must  produce uneasiness and disapprobation; and on the contrary, whatever is  the source of disorder and misery in society, must, for the same reason,  be regarded with pleasure and complacency. Timon, who probably from  his affected spleen more than an inveterate malice, was denominated the  manhater, embraced Alcibiades with great fondness. GO ON, MY BOY! cried  he, ACQUIRE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE: YOU WILL ONE DAY, I FORESEE,  BE THE CAUSE OF GREAT CALAMITIES TO THEM [Footnote: Plutarch fit vita  Ale.]. Could we admit the two principles of the Manicheans, it is an  infallible consequence, that their sentiments of human actions, as well  as of everything else, must be totally opposite, and that every instance  of justice and humanity, from its necessary tendency, must please the  one deity and displease the other. All mankind so far resemble the good  principle, that, where interest or revenge or envy perverts not our  disposition, we are always inclined, from our natural philanthropy, to  give the preference to the happiness of society, and consequently to  virtue above its opposite. Absolute, unprovoked, disinterested malice  has never perhaps place in any human breast; or if it had, must there  pervert all the sentiments of morals, as well as the feelings of  humanity. If the cruelty of Nero be allowed entirely voluntary, and not  rather the effect of constant fear and resentment; it is evident that  Tigellinus, preferably to Seneca or Burrhus, must have possessed his  steady and uniform approbation.    A statesman or patriot, who serves our own country in our own time, has  always a more passionate regard paid to him, than one whose beneficial  influence operated on distant ages or remote nations; where the good,  resulting from his generous humanity, being less connected with us,  seems more obscure, and affects us with a less lively sympathy. We may  own the merit to be equally great, though our sentiments are not raised  to an equal height, in both cases. The judgement here corrects the  inequalities of our internal emotions and perceptions; in like manner,  as it preserves us from error, in the several variations of images,  presented to our external senses. The same object, at a double distance,  really throws on the eye a picture of but half the bulk; yet we imagine  that it appears of the same size in both situations; because we know  that on our approach to it, its image would expand on the eye, and that  the difference consists not in the object itself, but in our  position with regard to it. And, indeed, without such a correction of  appearances, both in internal and external sentiment, men could  never think or talk steadily on any subject; while their fluctuating  situations produce a continual variation on objects, and throw them into  such different and contrary lights and positions.           [Footnote: For a little reason, the tendencies of actions and  characters, not their real accidental consequences, are alone regarded  in our more determinations or general judgements; though in our real  feeling or sentiment, we cannot help paying greater regard to one whose  station, joined to virtue, renders him really useful to society, then  to one, who exerts the social virtues only in good intentions and  benevolent affections. Separating the character from the furtone, by an  easy and necessary effort of thought, we pronounce these persons alike,  and give them the appearance: But is not able entirely to prevail our  sentiment.       Why is this peach-tree said to be better than that other; but because  it produces more or better fruit? And would not the same praise be given  it, though snails or vermin had destroyed the peaches, before they came  to full maturity? In morals too, is not THE TREE KNOWN BY THE FRUIT?  And cannot we easily distinguish between nature and accident, in the one  case as well as in the other?]        The more we converse with mankind, and the greater social intercourse we  maintain, the more shall we be familiarized to these general preferences  and distinctions, without which our conversation and discourse could  scarcely be rendered intelligible to each other. Every man's interest  is peculiar to himself, and the aversions and desires, which result  from it, cannot be supposed to affect others in a like degree. General  language, therefore, being formed for general use, must be moulded on  some more general views, and must affix the epithets of praise or blame,  in conformity to sentiments, which arise from the general interests of  the community. And if these sentiments, in most men, be not so strong as  those, which have a reference to private good; yet still they must make  some distinction, even in persons the most depraved and selfish; and  must attach the notion of good to a beneficent conduct, and of evil to  the contrary. Sympathy, we shall allow, is much fainter than our concern  for ourselves, and sympathy with persons remote from us much fainter  than that with persons near and contiguous; but for this very reason it  is necessary for us, in our calm judgements and discourse concerning  the characters of men, to neglect all these differences, and render  our sentiments more public and social. Besides, that we ourselves often  change our situation in this particular, we every day meet with persons  who are in a situation different from us, and who could never converse  with us were we to remain constantly in that position and point of  view, which is peculiar to ourselves. The intercourse of sentiments,  therefore, in society and conversation, makes us form some general  unalterable standard, by which we may approve or disapprove of  characters and manners. And though the heart takes not part entirely  with those general notions, nor regulates all its love and hatred by  the universal abstract differences of vice and virtue, without regard  to self, or the persons with whom we are more intimately connected;  yet have these moral differences a considerable influence, and being  sufficient, at least for discourse, serve all our purposes in company,  in the pulpit, on the theatre, and in the schools.           [Footnote: It is wisely ordained by nature, that private  connexions should commonly prevail over univeral views and  considerations; otherwise our affections and actions would be dissopated  and lost, for want of a proper limited object. Thus a small benefit done  to ourselves, or our near friends, excites more lively sentiments  of love and approbation than a great benefit done to a distant  commonwealth: But still we know here, as in all the senses, to correct  these inequalities by reflection, and retain a general standard of vice  and virtue, founded chiefly on a general usefulness.]    Thus, in whatever light we take this subject, the merit, ascribed to  the social virtues, appears still uniform, and arises chiefly from that  regard, which the natural sentiment of benevolence engages us to pay to  the interests of mankind and society. If we consider the principles of  the human make, such as they appear to daily experience and observation,  we must, A PRIORI, conclude it impossible for such a creature as man to  be totally indifferent to the well or ill-being of his fellow-creatures,  and not readily, of himself, to pronounce, where nothing gives him any  particular bias, that what promotes their happiness is good, what tends "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43282"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.No. 6.

In all these cases there was a space around the flash where the dust was  not thick enough to ignite from particle to particle; hence it remained  in the air after the explosion. Flour dust, flour middlings, etc., when  mixed with air, thick enough to ignite from particle to particle, and  separated so that each particle is surrounded by air, will unite with  the oxygen in the air, producing a gas at high temperature, which  requires an additional space, hence the bursting.    There is no gas which comes from flour or middlings that is an  explosive; it is the direct combination with the air that produces gas,  requiring additional space. Powerful electric sparks from the electric  machine and from the Leyden jar were passed through the air filled with  dust of the different kinds, but without an explosion in any case. A  platinum wire kept at a white heat by a galvanic battery would not  produce an explosion. The dust would collect upon it and char to black  coals, but would not blaze nor explode.    A piece of glowing charcoal, kept hot by the bellows, would not produce  an explosion when surrounded by dust, but when fanned into a blaze the  explosion followed. A common kerosene lantern, when surrounded by dust  of all degrees of density, would not produce an explosion, but when the  dust was blown into the bottom, through the globe and out of the top, it  would ignite. To explode quickly the dust must be dry. Evidently when an  explosion has been started in a volume of dusty air, loose flour maybe  blown into the air and made a source of danger.           *       *       *       *       *                               =New Engineering Inventions.=    Erskine H. Bronson, of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, has patented an  improvement in Automatic Switches for Railways, which consists in an  arrangement of sliding cams for moving the switch rails, and in treadles  to be operated by the pilot wheels of the locomotive, and in  intermediate mechanism for connecting the treadles with the switch  operating cams, the object being to provide a switch will be operated  by the pilot wheels of the locomotive as it approaches the movable  switch rails.    An improved Refrigerator Car has been patented by Michael Haughey, of St  Louis, Missouri. The object of this invention is to ventilate and cool  railway cars used in the transportation of perishable articles. This car  has a novel ventilator and ice box and is provided with a new form of  non-conducting walls.           *       *       *       *       *                                   =CROOKED JOURNALISM.=    In the English scientific journal _Engineering_, of June 21, 1878,  appears a six column article on \"Edison's Carbon Telephone,\" illustrated  with ten engravings from Mr. Prescott's recent work on \"The Speaking  Telephone, Talking Phonograph, and other novelties.\" The descriptions of  the cuts, and the rest of the information given, so far as correct,  obviously come from the same source.    So far as correct: unhappily for the honor of scientific journalism, the  writer's desire is plainly not so much to do justice to truth as to  exalt Mr. Hughes at the expense of Mr. Edison. To this end he has  studiously suppressed from Mr. Prescott's description of the carbon  telephone the points which establish Mr. Edison's claim to the prior  invention or discovery of everything involved in Mr. Hughes' microphone,  while he has as studiously dwelt upon those same points as constituting  the peculiar merits of Mr. Hughes' work.    For example, while he uses Fig. 21 of Mr. Prescott's book, he leaves out  the very important little diagram numbered 20. It represents one form of  the apparatus to which Sir William Thomson refers in the letter in which  he says:    \"It is certain that at the meeting of the British Association at  Plymouth last September, a method of magnifying sound in an electric  telephone was described as having been invented by Mr. Edison, which was  identical in principle and in some details with that brought forward by  Mr. Hughes.\"    The figure looks altogether too much like one form of Mr. Hughes'  microphone to allow of its use in an article intended to establish the  novelty of Mr. Hughes' discovery.    The omissions from the text are quite as significant. Under the first  cut used in _Engineering_, Mr. Prescott says: \"In the latest form of  transmitter which Mr. Edison has introduced the vibrating diaphragm is  done away with altogether, it having been found that much better results  are obtained when a rigid plate of metal is substituted in its place....  The inflexible plate, of course, merely serves, in consequence of its  comparatively large area, to concentrate a considerable portion of the  sonorous waves upon the small carbon disk or button; a much greater  degree of pressure for any given effort of the speaker is thus brought  to bear on the disk than could be obtained if only its small surface  alone were used.\"    The _Engineering_ writer coolly suppresses this important statement. He  does worse: he puts in its place the false statement that \"the essential  principle of Mr. Edison's transmitter consists in causing a diaphragm,  vibrating under the influence of sonorous vibrations, to vary the  pressure upon, and therefore the resistance of, a piece of carbon,\" and  so on.    A little further on, while repeating Mr. Edison's account of the  experiments which led to the abandonment of the vibrating diaphragm  (page 226 of Mr. Prescott's book), the _Engineering_ writer drops out  the following remark by Mr. Edison: \"I discovered that my principle,  unlike all other acoustical devices for the transmission of speech, did  not require any vibration of the diaphragm--that, in fact, the sound  waves could be transformed into electrical pulsations without the  movement of any intervening mechanism.\"    Worse yet, in the very face of Mr. Edison's assertion to the  contrary--an assertion which he could not by any possibility have  overlooked--this most unscientific journalist says: \"Mr. Edison finds it  necessary to insert a diaphragm in all forms of his apparatus, that  being the mechanical contrivance employed by which sonorous vibrations  are converted into variations of mechanical pressure, and by which  variations in the conductivity of the carbon or other material is  insured.... On the other hand, Mr. Hughes employs no diaphragm at all,  the sonorous vibrations in his apparatus acting directly upon the  conducting material or through whatever solid substance to which they  may be attached.\"    In this way throughout the offending article, the writer persistently  robs Edison to magnify Hughes, giving credit to Mr. Hughes for exactly  what he has suppressed from Mr. Prescott's book. To insist as he does,  that, because Mr. Edison covers his carbon button with a rigid iron  plate, in his very practical telephone, therefore a vibrating diaphragm  is an essential feature of Mr. Edison's invention, is a very shallow  quibble in the face of Mr. Edison's and Mr. Prescott's statements that  the carbon button acts precisely the same in the absence of such  covering, though not so strongly. Mr. Edison's laboratory records show a  great variety of experiments in which the carbon was talked against  without \"any intervening mechanism.\" In a telephone for popular use,  however, to be held in the hand, turned upside down, talked into,  exposed to dust and the weather, it was obviously necessary to use some  means for holding the carbon in place, and to prevent its sensitiveness  from being destroyed by dirt and the moisture of the breath when in use.  For this purpose a rigid iron partition seemed at once convenient and  durable. It is not in any sense a \"vibrating diaphragm.\"    With a persistence worthy of a better cause, the _Engineering_ writer  returns to the point he seems especially anxious to enforce. Toward the  end of the article he says: \"In every instrument described by Mr. Edison  the diaphragm is the ruling genie of the instrument. Professor Hughes,  however, has through his great discovery been enabled to show that  variations of resistance can be imparted to an electrical current not  only without a diaphragm, but with very much better results when no such  accessory is employed.\"    The animus of all this is only too apparent. Altogether the article is  the most dishonest piece of writing we have ever seen in a scientific  periodical; and although the article appears in the editorial columns of  _Engineering_, we prefer, for the honor of scientific journalism, to  think that the management of that paper was not party to the rascally  act. It is more credible that a gross imposition has been practiced by  some trusted member of the _Engineering_ staff, or by some contributor  whose position seemed to justify the acceptance of his utterances  without any attempt at their verification. It is well known here to  whom, in London, at Mr. Edison's request, Mr. Prescott sent proofs of  the matter abused, together with electros of the cuts used, in  _Engineering_. Accordingly the burden of dishonor lies upon or between a  prominent British official on the one hand, and on the other a journal  which cannot afford to leave the matter unexplained. Whoever is hurt, we  sincerely hope that the fair fame of scientific journalism for candor  and honesty may come off unstained.           *       *       *       *       *                                =A More Perfect Production.=    The highest skill in manufacture or in production of any kind is not yet  the prevailing characteristic of American industry.
