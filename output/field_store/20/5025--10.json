In some cases it  appeared that the entire nest was closed; probably the occupant had  closed the entrance. Such a closed nest would have the advantage of  greatly moderating the microenvironment within the nest, and would allow  the animal within to remain comfortable with a minimum expenditure of  energy. The larger nests found in the trapping grid resembled those  built by captives. Nests built of grasses were always larger than those  built of juniper bark. Juniper bark is as easily worked into nests as  are grasses, in my judgment. Therefore, difficulty of construction of  nests from this material probably does not account for the smaller size  of the nests composed of bark. I think the difference in insulating  characteristics between the two materials probably accounts for the  difference in size of the nests.          REPRODUCTION      In Mesa Verde, _Peromyscus_ reproduces from April through September.  Reproduction is greatly reduced in the autumn, and most females complete  reproduction before October.    Ten of the 20 females of _P. maniculatus_, taken in May, contained  embryos; five others were lactating. Lactating and pregnant females were  collected on May 5, 1962, indicating that reproduction in some females  began in early April. In September, 15 of 34 females were pregnant or  lactating, whereas in October only two out of 15 females of _P.  maniculatus_ were reproducing. Only one female of _P. maniculatus_ was  found to contain embryos in October. This large adult was taken on  October 3, 1963, and had six embryos, each five millimeters long. She  probably would have produced a litter later in October, and would have  been nursing into November. A report of October breeding in  north-central Colorado described nine of 23 females of _P. maniculatus_  as being in a reproductive state; seven were lactating and one was  pregnant between October 26 and 31, 1952 (Beidleman, 1954:118).    In the Museum of Natural History, the University of Kansas, there are 35  females of _P. maniculatus_ more than 144 millimeters in total length  taken from Mesa Verde in November, 1957 (Anderson, 1961:53). None of  these contained embryos, and no pregnant females have been taken from  the park in November.    _P. truei_ and _P. maniculatus_ reproduce at about the same time. A  female of _P. truei_ prepared as a specimen on May 10, 1964, contained  four embryos, each 20 millimeters long, indicating a breeding time in  mid-April. Svihla (1932:19) reported the gestation period for  non-lactating _P. truei_ to be 25 to 27 days and for lactating  individuals, 40 days. Lactation tends to increase the gestation period  of other _Peromyscus_ by about five days (Asdell, 1964:266). The  gestation period of nine non-lactating females of _P. m. rufinus_ was  reported by Svihla to be 23 to 24 days. Lactation increased the length  of the period of gestation in this subspecies to between 23 and 32 days  (mean for seven females 26.57 +- 0.73, Svihla, 1932:19).    Females of _P. truei_ were observed in various stages of reproduction  from June through September. Ten of the 20 females of _P. truei_ taken  in September were reproducing; four contained embryos and the other six  were lactating. In October, only one of 17 females caught in snap traps  was lactating. Lactating females were caught in live-traps as late as  October 23, although most females had ceased reproduction by then. No  pregnant or lactating females were observed in November.    In _P. maniculatus_, puberty has been placed at 32 to 35 days for  females weighing 13 grams, and in males at from 40 to 45 days, at  weights of 15 to 16 grams (Jameson, 1953:45). In _P. truei_, the weight  of the testes is reported to rise in March and diminish through  September, with accessory organs following the same cycle (Asdell,  1964:267). Young of _P. truei_ nurse for about one month, although some  litters may not be weaned until 40 days of age. Young of _P.  maniculatus_ are weaned between 22 and 37 days of age (Svihla, 1932:30).    Twenty-six pregnant females of _P. maniculatus_, taken in the breeding  seasons of 1961-1964, contained from one to eight embryos each; the mean  was 4.65 +- 1.67. Other investigators have found similar mean values in  this species (Asdell, 1964:266).    Thirteen females of _P. truei_ taken in the breeding seasons of  1961-1964, contained from three to six embryos each; the mean was 4.0 +-  .912. Svihla (1932:25) reported litter sizes, at birth, of two to five  and a mean of 2.84, in 19 litters. Other investigators have reported  litter sizes of one to five with a mean of 3.4, and one to six with a  mean of 3.6 (Asdell, 1964:268). Apparently _P. truei_ does not have more  than six young per litter.    In captivity, females of both species began reproduction in early  February. These captives had been kept for several months at a  temperature of 21 degrees Centigrade, and on a daily photoperiod of 15  hours. Some captive males had enlarged, scrotal testes in January; the  extended photoperiod and warm temperature probably influenced the  breeding condition. In both species testes of wild males caught in  autumn after late September and on through the winter were abdominal,  except for one male of _P. maniculatus_ which had enlarged, scrotal  testes on October 15.    Dates at which different animals arrived at breeding condition varied,  in part owing to subadults (young of the year) appearing in the catch  from early summer to late autumn. Some adult females appeared to be  pregnant or lactating throughout much of the summer and early autumn,  whereas other females, that were caught a number of times, apparently  reproduced only once in the summer.    Some females may fail to breed even though they are mature enough to do  so. One female of _P. truei_ captured eight times (August 30 to  September 20) was a juvenile when first caught, and was classed as young  (in postjuvenal molt) on September 10. She did not reproduce in her  first breeding season, unless she did so after September 20, which is  unlikely. Another female of _P. truei_ was an adult when first caught,  and was caught 12 times (August 21 to October 25). At no time were her  mammae enlarged and she was not lactating or pregnant. It is improbable  that she reproduced earlier in the season, for teats of mice that have  reproduced earlier usually are enlarged to such a degree that previous  parturition is clearly indicated. It was surprising to catch a female,  of any age, 12 times in two months without sign of reproductive  activity.    Only one female of _P. maniculatus_ did not show reproductive activity.  She was a juvenile on July 19 when first caught; a subadult on August 28  when caught the third time, and an adult on October 23 when caught the  fifth time.    Burt reported a rest period of a month or more in the summer, in  Michigan, during which many females of _P. leucopus_ did not reproduce.  They began to breed again in late summer at about the time when young of  the year began reproducing (Burt, 1940:17, 19). Abundant mast was  correlated with reproductivity in autumn, according to Jameson  (1953:54), who thought that \"food is a basic determinant of the autumn  reproduction\" of _P. leucopus_.    Little has been written about the length of time males remain in  breeding condition. Difficulties in determining breeding condition are  many. Fertility customarily is determined by sectioning testes and  noting the presence or absence, and relative abundance, of sperm. This  procedure necessarily sacrifices the individual and indicates the  breeding condition at only one moment and for only the individuals  sacrificed. My observations of males caught a number of times in live  traps shed some light on the breeding condition of males, but the  investigator is likely to err in extrapolating physiological data from  morphology when he notes whether the testes are abdominal or scrotal and  whether they are enlarged or small. It was assumed that testes that have  not descended, and that lie within the abdominal cavity, are not capable  of producing viable sperm. This is the condition in most juveniles, and  in all males during winter. As the breeding condition is attained,  testes descend into the scrotum. Soon the testes and their accessory  organs enlarge and are readily apparent.    Howard (1950:320) reported that numerous males of _P. leucopus_ sired  litters when their testes appeared to be abdominal, and therefore  questioned whether the criterion of descended testes is valid as an  indicator of breeding condition. My captive males of _P. maniculatus_  and _P. truei_ did not sire litters when their testes were abdominal,  even though such males were left with adult females for as long as four  to five months (August through December). Captive pairs of both species  yielded no evidence of reproductive activity until January when, as  mentioned earlier, some of the males had scrotal testes. Young were born  first in early February, although their parents had been confined  together since the preceding August. Jameson reported the testes of  fecund males of _P. maniculatus_ as almost always 8.0 millimeters or  larger (Jameson, 1953:50). Testes that are at least partly scrotal must  be considered as being capable of producing motile sperm, even though  this may not be the case for all individuals.    Toward the beginning and end of the breeding season the testes and  accessory organs of wild mice were small and probably produced few if  any sperm. At these times some males apparently were so frightened by  being handled that the testes were retracted into the inguinal canals.  It would have been easy to consider such males as having abdominal  testes when in fact they did not. In such cases the scrotum usually was  noticeably enlarged; it was found also that in many cases the testes  returned to the scrotal position if the mouse was held gently for a few  minutes.

The theodolite-stand was unavoidably placed within a  very few inches of the edge, and I took a round of angles, suffering,  however, intense pain from the piercing coldness of the wind, which, heated  as we were by the ascent, was much felt, though the temperature was not  lower than 39deg. I was lightly clothed, and should have fared badly, had  not one of the party lent me his Flushing jacket, while he descended under  the lee of the mountain-top to make a fire. The barometer stood at 26,618,  the temperature of the air being 40deg, and of {42} the mercury 43deg.[44]  Unfortunately the day was very cloudy, and many squalls of sleet and rain,  which obscured the hills, passed whilst I was taking bearings. To the N.E.,  towards the supposed Sebastian Channel, the horizon was too hazy to allow  much view. A deep inlet was seen in that direction; but whether the land  closed round, or whether a channel was at the bottom, we could not  distinguish. A considerable body of water was observed to the southward of  Cape St. Valentyn, behind Lomas Bay, but its extent was screened from our  view by the intervention of the Lomas hills. It appeared to be a channel,  the opposite or eastern side of it being formed by the high ranges  previously seen from Point St. Mary. Cordova's Ports San Antonio and Valdez  were distinctly made out; but, to the southward, every thing was enveloped  in mist.    The bearings and observations, which occupied me nearly two hours, being  completed, we all adjourned to a sheltered cleft in the rock close to our  station, where we soon recovered the use of our fingers.[45]    {43}    Having accomplished our object, we began the descent. In a comparatively  mild and agreeable spot, I again set up the theodolite and barometer, while  some of the party employed themselves in fruitless attempts to kindle a  fire. The height, by the barometer, proved to be 1,845 feet above the sea;  and the bearings from this station were much better than those I had taken  from the exposed summit.    We reached our tent at noon, having been absent seven hours. At three we  reached the beach, where the barometer stood at 29,312 (air 61.deg3,[46]  and mercury 62,deg5).    Excepting near the sea, where clay-slate (very similar to that of Point St.  Anna, but with an opposite dip) showed itself, the side of the hill is  clothed with trees and underwood, and no rock is visible until one arrives  at the ravine. Around the summit of Mount Tarn the ground is bare, but so  covered with small decomposed fragments, that the solid rock only appears  occasionally: it is very hard, and breaks with a conchoidal fracture: some  of the specimens which we detached bore indistinct impressions of organic  remains. We also found, projecting from the rock in which they were  embedded, nodules, or small rounded masses of stone, in an advanced state  of decomposition, mouldering away in laminar forms somewhat resembling the  inner leaves of a cabbage. Several were brought away carefully, but before  we arrived on board they had crumbled to pieces: the nucleus was quite  hard, but was surrounded by concentric laminae, more brittle the nearer  they approached to the outer surface. It seemed as if the face of the  summit {44} above-mentioned was covered with the decomposing fragments of  these nodules.    The highest parts of the Mount form a ridge extending S.E. and N.W., being  a succession of strata of slaty rock, dipping to the eastward, at an angle  of 15deg or 20deg from the horizon. The strata are very narrow, and  separated from each other by a vein of quartz, much of which is in a  crystallized state. We reached the ship about seven o'clock, and found that  the Hope and her party had done well. Her cruize proved interesting, with  regard to the geography of the Strait, and a summary of it is subjoined.    Mr. Graves's orders were to survey the Sebastian Channel; but in the event  of his seeing any thing more interesting to the S.E., he was allowed to  defer that service to another opportunity. The Hope crossed the Strait, and  anchored in a small bay, formed between the two projecting points of Cape  Valentyn, where some few defects in the vessel were remedied, and a good  round of angles obtained from the summit of the Cape, whence there was a  fine view. The country was low, undulating, and destitute of trees. From a  station about two miles overland, to the eastward, a large body of water  was observed to the southward, forming a channel, or deep sound, and it was  determined to follow up its examination, rather than risk the crew in the  deep bay that was supposed to communicate with the San Sebastian Channel,  on board a vessel whose capabilities were unknown. Several fire-places and  remains of wigwams were seen; the latter were, however, very different,  both in shape and material, from those at Port Famine, for the country  being destitute of trees, they were built of driftwood, piled up in a  conical form.    Passing round Cape Valentyn, the Hope hauled to the southward, keeping the  land on board. At night she anchored in Philip Gidley Cove, at the bottom  of Willes Bay, where she was weather-bound until the 29th of January. The  shores of Willes Bay are thickly clothed with wood, growing to the water's  edge, except at the S.W. side. The great abundance of muscles and limpets  attracts the Indians, whose wigwams {45} were found standing, and from the  green appearance of the branches with which they were formed, seemed to  have been lately erected. After leaving Willes Bay, the Hope visited Fox  Bay, and Sir Edward Owen's Sound, which, it was thought, would lead into  Lomas Bay, opposite to Port Famine; but, after running ten miles up, they  got into shoal water, and as there was no current, or stream of tide, they  landed, and found that a mile and a half farther on, the sound was  terminated by low land. Another day, while proceeding along the south side  of Brenton Sound, the smoke of Indians' fires was noticed near the beach.  As this was the first time the Natives of this part had been seen, the  course was shaped towards them, until the Hope anchored. Three Indians then  approached, holding up the skins of some animal, and inviting them to land.  The small boat was hoisted out, and Messrs. Wickham and Rowlett, with  Robinson the pilot, went on shore. The Fuegians presented a fox skin to  each of the party, who in return gave them some trifles. After a short  interview the boat left them, and no further communication was held that  night. The following morning a canoe came off to the vessel, containing  three young men, two women, and three children, the youngest not more than  four months old. They were no sooner alongside than the men went on board,  and commenced an active traffic with all the valuables they possessed; and  for a few buttons, a glass bottle, or an empty preserved-meat canister,  many of their goods were bartered. They had several fox-skins with them,  but no other kind of peltry, except their clothing, obtained from the seal  or guanaco: and though many of them wore a penguin skin suspended from  their girdle, some were without even that covering. This canoe was followed  by another, containing an old man, sixty or seventy years of age, with a  grey beard; an elderly woman, and two children. Before they came alongside  they put their dogs on shore.    Although the visit from these Indians did not last very long, they had time  enough to pilfer. One of the young men, who was seen going into a canoe,  excited, by his manner, a {46} suspicion of his having stolen something,  and a tin pot was found concealed under his mantle. As there was every  probability of their soon separating, and Mr. Graves feared that punishment  would cause a rupture, he only turned him out of the vessel: the rest soon  followed him, and landed. Having made a fire, the men squatted round it;  while the women were despatched to collect shell-fish.    As soon as the Natives had finished their meal, they embarked, and  proceeded eastward. Next day they again visited the Hope, but in  consequence, perhaps, of the occurrence the day before, did not venture  alongside, until invited by the words, 'ho-say, ho-say,' which mean, 'come,  come.' In a few minutes confidence was restored, and they began to barter.  The trade was opened by one of the women making a peace-offering of a shell  necklace, in return for which, red caps and medals were given to each of  the women and children. The Hope went thence to Soapsuds Cove, where the  crew washed their clothes, and replaced a broken spar.    In a S.E. direction from this cove there appeared to be a considerable  channel leading to the S.E., and to the southward was a deep sound, towards  which they were proceeding the next morning; but having advanced about two  miles, the land of Cape Expectation trended suddenly round to the eastward,  and a long narrow channel presented itself, which seemed likely to  communicate with the Strait, to the southward of Port San Antonio. They  proceeded through this channel, which takes a very straight course, and  gradually narrows from Port Waterfall, where it is two miles and a half  wide, to Passage Cove, where it is scarcely three quarters of a mile; and  there they anchored.    Between Port Waterfall and Passage Cove, a party of Natives was seen; but,  being probably the same who were met at Indian Cove, no attention was paid  to their hallooings and fires of invitation.[47] The Hope came into the  Strait, eastward of an opening then called Magdalen Sound; her passage {47}  must therefore have been through Sarmiento's 'San Gabriel' Channel.    At night, when between Cape Froward and Port San Antonio, a heavy squall  from S.W. carried the little vessel rapidly towards Cape San Isidro, and,  at daylight the next morning, she was in the position observed by us, "]]]
