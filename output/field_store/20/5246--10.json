Here quite a little excitement occurred, for  several sea-gulls attacked the buzzard and with loud cries tried to drive  it away, following it as it soared higher and higher into the heavens,  and finally routing it altogether and sending it off in the direction of  Port Sennen.    The path along which the girls had been walking was the merest track  through the bracken. So far there had been either a low wall or a hedge  as a protection at the edge of the cliff, but now these outposts of  civilisation vanished and they were at the very brink of the crags.  Tattie, whose head was not of the strongest, turned giddy and refused to  go farther; indeed, she was so overcome that she sank on the ground and  buried her face in her hands.    \"I daren't look down!\" she shuddered. \"I know I shall fall if I do. Oh! I  wish I'd never come! How am I going to get back?\"    \"There's only about a hundred yards like this,\" urged Mavis. \"After that  the path is all right again. Take my arm.\"    \"No, no! I daren't! I can't go either backwards or forwards. I feel as if  I should faint!\" sobbed Tattie, waxing quite hysterical.    Here was a dilemma! She must certainly be made to move one way or the  other. With great difficulty Fay and Beata between them got her back to  the path along which they had come, where she collapsed under the shelter  of the wall, and sat down to recover.    \"I'll be all right now,\" she said, wiping her eyes. \"I can go home alone.  Don't let me keep any of you.\"    \"We'll come with you,\" said Lizzie Colville. \"Nan and I don't like  walking so near the edge either. I wouldn't cross that place for worlds.\"    So it was arranged that the Ramsays and the Castletons and Fay should go  on to St. Morval's Head, while the rest of the company turned back.    \"It's a pity, but it's no good taking people who turn giddy,\" commented  Mavis. \"If they can't manage that piece of cliff, how would they scramble  down into the cove?\"    \"They haven't got tennis shoes on for one thing,\" remarked Merle, \"and  boots are horribly slippery. You ought to have rubber soles for these  rocks. It just makes all the difference. Mavis and I always wear them at  Chagmouth.\"    \"So do we. We learnt that at Porthkeverne. We're used to scrambling. As  for Fay she's a real fairy. I believe she could fly if you gave her a  push over the edge to start her off.\"    \"Don't try, thanks, or I might turn into a mermaid instead of a fairy or  a bird! I often think, though, I'd like a private aeroplane of my own.  They're things that are bound to come sooner or later. I only hope I  shan't be too old to use one when they do. What a view it is here!\"    The difficult piece of cliff had led them round a corner, and they were  now facing a magnificent sweep of coast-line. Below them, fixed to a buoy  that floated on the water, a bell was ringing incessantly, its clanging  sound floating over the sea like the knell of a mermaid's funeral.    \"It's to warn the vessels off the rocks,\" explained Mavis. \"They can hear  it in a fog when they can't see quite where they are.\" Merle and I always  call it 'The Inchcape Bell.' Oh, you know the story?      'The worthy abbot of Aberbrothock    Had fixed that bell on the Inchcape rock.    On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung,    And over the waves its warning rung.'    Then the pirate, Sir Ralph the Rover, goes and cuts it off, just out of  spite, and sails away. Years afterwards his ship comes back to Scotland,  and there's a thick fog, and he's wrecked on the very Inchcape rock from  which he stole the warning bell.      'Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair;    He cursed himself in his wild despair.    The waves poured in on every side,    And the vessel sank beneath the tide.'\"    \"Serve him right too! It was a sneaking rag to play!\" commented Merle.    \"The bell makes me think of an old hermitage,\" said Romola. \"I expect to  see a monk walking along, telling his beads. Who was St. Morval? Didn't  he have a little chapel on the cliffs here?\"    \"Romola always thinks of the Middle Ages,\" laughed Beata. \"That's because  she poses so much for Dad's pictures. It sounds like a church bell under  the sea to me. When we lived at Porthkeverne we were close to the lost  land of Lyonesse, and there was a lovely story about a mermaid. They said  she used to come and sit on a broad flat stone outside the church and  listen to the singing; and the priest heard of it, so one day he came out  and talked to her, and asked her if she wouldn't like to be baptized, and  she said she'd think about it. So she swam away; but she came back again  and again, and it was decided that she was to be baptized on Easter  Sunday. But on Good Friday there was a terrible storm, and the waves came  up and swallowed the whole of the village, so that when the poor mermaid  arrived she found the church sunk under the sea, and the priest and all  the people drowned. There was nobody to baptize her, and there never has  been since, and she swims about the water weeping and singing any little  bits of the service that she can remember. The fishermen said if anybody  was at sea and heard her it was bad luck, and a sign he would certainly  be drowned before long.\"    \"I love the quaint old legends!\" said Mavis. \"I shall always think of  your mermaid now, when I hear the bell. This is our way down to the cove.  It's a most frightful scramble. Can you manage it?\"    The girls went first over grass and gorse, then climbed down a tiny track  so narrow and slippery they were obliged to sit and slide, and finally,  with some difficulty, scrambled on to the grim rugged rocks beneath. They  were on a kind of platform, covered with seaweed and little pools, and  with deep swirling water below.    Beata decided it would be a good place to fish, so they got out their  log-lines. The first and most manifest thing to do was to find bait.  There were plenty of limpets on the rocks, and with penknives they  managed to dislodge some of them. It was only when a limpet was caught  napping that it was possible to secure him: once he sat down tight and  excluded the air from his shell, no amount of pulling could move him. The  victims thus gathered were sacrificed by Beata and Merle, who acted as  high priestesses, and chopped them up, and placed them upon the hooks,  for neither Mavis nor Romola would touch them, and even Fay was not  particularly keen upon this part of the fishing operations. They were  ready at last, and cast their lines. Merle, unfortunately, through lack  of experience, had not unreeled hers far enough, and the heavy weight  sank deeply in the water and jerked the whole thing out of her hands into  the sea.    \"Oh, what a shame! And we've only just paid two and sixpence for it! What  an utter idiot I was! I never thought it would pull like that. See, it's  floating about down there!\"    \"I'll get it for you if I can,\" said Beata. With some manoeuvring she  managed to fling her own line over it and drag it slowly in, losing it  several times but rescuing it in the end.    After that mishap Merle was wiser, and threw with more discretion. Fay  also tried her luck, and the girls sat waiting for bites. But alas! none  came. There were several false alarms, but the lines when hauled in held  nothing more exciting than hunks of seaweed. It was really most  disappointing.    \"I'm afraid they don't like the bait,\" said Beata at last. \"If we could  find a few lob-worms now, it might tempt them. They're evidently rather  dainty.\"    \"And I expect we don't know much about it!\" said Mavis.    \"Well, people have to learn some time, I suppose. You can't tumble to  fishing by instinct!\"    It was decided to go farther along and try to find lob-worms. The  difficulty was to scramble down the rocks on to the sand. From above it  looked quite easy and possible, but at close quarters the crags were very  precipitous. At one point, however, they determined to venture. They sat  on the edge of the sloping rock, let go, and then simply slid down,  hanging on to pieces of ivy and tufts of grass. The cove, when they thus  reached it, was worth the trouble of getting there. Sand-gobies were  darting about in the pools, and came swimming up to fight for the pieces  of limpet which the girls dropped in for them. They found a few lobworms  and re-baited their hooks and cast their lines afresh, but met with no  better success than before.    \"I'm fed up with fishing!\" announced Romola at last. \"Let's go home!\"    She had voiced the general opinion of the party. All immediately began to  wind up their lines.    \"The tide's coming in fast, and we're close to the blow-hole,\" said  Mavis. \"It seems a pity not to stop and watch it.\"    The blow-hole was a curious natural phenomenon. The sea, pouring into a  narrow gully, forced air and water to spurt through an opening at certain  intervals. First a low groaning noise was heard, which waxed louder and  louder until--so Beata declared--it resembled the snoring of Father  Neptune. Then suddenly a shower of spray spurted from the aperture, the  sunshine lighting it with all the prismatic colours of the rainbow. For a  few seconds it played like a fountain, then died down as the wave  receded. The girls were so interested in watching it that they quite  forgot the sea behind them. While their backs were turned to it, the  great strong tide was lapping and swelling in, moving higher and higher  up the rocks, and covering the pools, and creeping into the cove, and  changing the sand and seaweed into a lake. When Mavis happened to look  round she found her basket floating. She started up with a cry. The one  accessible spot where they had climbed down now had a deep pool under it.    \"We must wade!\" gasped Beata, and hurriedly pulling off her shoes and  stockings"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7836"],[0,"Jewish History : An Essay in the Philosophy of History (#12)"],[1,"movement, the Jews yielded to  the vivifying magic of young Arabic culture.    Partly under the influence of the Arabic tendency to split into  religio-philosophic sects, partly from inner causes, Karaism sprang up  in the second half of the eighth century. Its active career began with  a vehement protest against the Talmud as the regulator of life and  thought. It proclaimed the creators of this vast encyclopedia to be  usurpers of spiritual power, and urged a return to the Biblical laws  in their unadulterated simplicity. The weakness of its positive  principles hindered the spread of Karaism, keeping it forever within  the narrow limits of a sect and consigning it to stagnation. What gave  it vogue during the first century of its existence was its negative  strength, its violent opposition to the Talmud, which aroused  strenuous intellectual activity. For a long time it turned Judaism  away from its one-sided Talmudic tendency, and opened up new avenues  of work for it. True to their motto: \"Search diligently in the Holy  Scriptures,\" the adherents of Karaism applied themselves to the  rational study of the Bible, which had come to be, among the  Talmudists, the object of casuistic interpretation and legendary  adornment. By the cultivation of grammar and lexicography as applied  to the Biblical thesaurus of words, they resuscitated the Hebrew  language, which, ousted by the Aramaic dialect, had already sunk into  oblivion. By the same means they laid the foundation of a school of  rejuvenated poetry. In general, thought on religious and philosophic  subjects was promoted to a higher degree by the lively discussions  between them and the Talmudists.    By imperceptible steps Talmudic Judaism, influenced at once by the  enlightened Arabs and the protesting Karaites, departed from the \"four  ells of the Halacha,\" and widened its horizon. Among the spiritual  leaders of the people arose men who occupied themselves not only with  the study of the Talmud but also with a rational exegesis of the  Bible, with philology, poetry, philosophy. The great Gaon Saadiah  (892-942) united within himself all strands of thought. Over and above  a large number of philological and other writings of scientific  purport, he created a momentous religio-philosophic system, with the  aim to clarify Judaism and refine religious conceptions. He was an  encyclopedic thinker, a representative of the highest Jewish culture  and of Arabic culture as well--he wrote his works in Arabic by  preference. In this way Jewish thought gained ground more and more in  the Orient. It was in the West, however, that it attained soon after  to the climax of its development.    Gradually the centre of gravity of Jewry shifted from Asia Minor to  Western Europe. Beginning with the sixth century, the sparsely sown  Jewish population of Occidental Europe increased rapidly in numbers.  In Italy, Byzantium, France, and Visigothic Spain, important Jewish  communities were formed. The medieval intolerance of the Church,  though neither so widespread nor so violent as it later became,  suffered its first outbreak in that early century. The persecutions of  the Jews by the Visigothic kings of Spain and the Bishops Avitus of  Clermont and Agobard in France (sixth to the ninth century) were the  prelude to the more systematic and the more bloody cruelties of  subsequent days. The insignificant numbers of the European Jews and  the insecurity of their condition stood in the way of forming an  intellectual centre of their own. They were compelled to acknowledge  the spiritual supremacy of their Oriental brethren in faith. With the  beginning of the tenth century the situation underwent a change.  Arabic civilization, which had penetrated to Spain in previous  centuries, brought about a radical transformation in the character of  the country. The realm of the fanatic Visigoths, half barbarous and  wholly averse to the light of progress, changed into the prosperous  and civilized Khalifate of the Ommeyyades. Thither the best forces of  Oriental Jewry transferred themselves. With the growth of the Jewish  population in Arabic Spain and the strengthening of its communal  organization, the spiritual centre of the Jewish people gradually  established itself in Spain. The academies of Sura and Pumbeditha  yielded first place to the high schools of Cordova and Toledo.    The Jewry of the East resigned the national hegemony to the Jewry of  the West. The Geonim withdrew in favor of the Rabbis. After centuries  of seclusion, the Jewish spirit once more asserted itself, and enjoyed  a period of efflorescence. The process of national growth became more  complex, more varied.          IX    THE RABBINIC-PHILOSOPHICAL PERIOD, OR THE HEGEMONY OF THE SPANISH JEWS  (980-1492)      The five centuries marked at their beginning by the rise of  Arabic-Jewish civilization in Spain and at their end by the banishment  of the Jews from Spain (980-1492), offer the Jewish historian an  abundance of culture manifestations and intellectual movements so  luxuriant that it is well-nigh impossible to gather them up in one  formula. The monotony formerly prevailing in Jewish national life,  both in its external and in its internal relations, was succeeded by  almost gaily checkered variety. Swept along by the movement towards  enlightenment that dominated their surroundings, the Jews of Arabic  Spain threw themselves into energetic work in all the spheres of life  and thought. While they had political ground more or less firm under  their feet, and for the most part enjoyed peace and liberty, the Jews  in the Christian lands of Europe stood upon volcanic soil, every  moment threatening to swallow them up. Exposed constantly to  persecutions, they lived more or less isolated, and devoted themselves  to one-sided though intense intellectual activity. Sombre shadows and  streaks of bright light alternate with each other in this period. In  its second half, the clouds massed themselves heavily upon the  darkening horizon. Even the \"privileged\" Spanish Jews suffered an  untoward change in their affairs at the beginning of the thirteenth  century: gradually they were withdrawn from under the sovereignty of  the Arabs, and made subject to the power of the Catholic monarchs.  They became thenceforward the equal partners of their brethren in  faith in the rest of Europe. All without distinction had a share in  the spiritual martyrdom which is the greenest bayleaf in the crown of  Jewish history. To think and to suffer became the watchword of the  whole nation.    At first, as we have said, a considerable portion of the Jewish people  enjoyed the happy possibility of thinking. This was during the  classical epoch of the Arabic-Jewish Renaissance, which preceded the  Italian Renaissance by four centuries. There is a fundamental  difference between the two Renaissance periods: the earlier one was  signalized by a re-birth of the sciences and of philosophy, the later  one pre-eminently of the arts and of literature. The eleventh and  twelfth centuries marked the meridian of the intellectual development  of medieval Judaism. As once, in Alexandria, the union of Judaic with  Hellenic culture brought in its train a superabundance of new ideas of  a universal character, so again the amalgamation, on Spanish soil, of  Jewish culture with Arabic gave rise to rich intellectual results,  more lasting and fruitful than the Alexandrian, inasmuch as, in spite  of their universal character, they did not contravene the national  spirit. The Jewish people dropped its misanthropy and its leaning  toward isolation. The Jews entered all sorts of careers: by the side  of influential and cultivated statesmen, such as Chasdai ibn Shaprut  and Samuel Hanagid, at the courts of the Khalifs, stood a brilliant  group of grammarians, poets, and philosophers, like Jonah ibn Ganach,  Solomon Gabirol, and Moses ibn Ezra. The philosophic-critical  scepticism of Abraham ibn Ezra co-existed in peace and harmony with  the philosophic-poetic enthusiasm of Jehuda Halevi. The study of  medicine, mathematics, physics, and astronomy went hand in hand with  the study of the Talmud, which, though it may not have occupied the  first place with the Spanish Jews of this time, by no means  disappeared, as witness the compendium by Alphassi. Unusual breadth  and fulness of the spiritual life is the distinction of the epoch.  This variety of mental traits combined in a marvelous union to form  the great personality of Maimonides, the crown of a glorious period.  With one \"Strong Hand,\" this intellectual giant brought order out of  the Talmudic chaos, which at his word was transformed into a  symmetrical, legal system; with the other, he \"guided the Perplexed\"  through the realm of faith and knowledge. For rationalistic clarity  and breadth of view no counterpart to the religio-philosophic doctrine  which he formulated can be found in the whole extent of medieval  literature. The main feature of the philosophy of Maimonides and of  the systems based upon it is rationalism, not a dry, scholastic,  abstract rationalism, but a living rationalism, embracing the whole  field of the most exalted psychic phenomena. It is not philosophy pure  and simple, but religious philosophy, an harmonization, more or less  felicitous, of the postulates of reason with the dogmas of faith. It  is reason mitigated by faith, and faith regulated by reason. In the  darkness of the middle ages, when the Romish Church impregnated  religion with the crudest superstitions, going so far as to forbid its  adherents to read the Bible, and when the greatest philosopher  representatives of the Church, like Albertus Magnus, would have  rejected offhand, as a childish fancy or, indeed, as an heretical  chimera, any attempt to rescue the lower classes of the people from  their wretched state of spiritual servitude--in a time like this, the  truly majestic spectacle is presented of a"]]]
