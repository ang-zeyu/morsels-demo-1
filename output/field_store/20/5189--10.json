It is not distinctly seen at  a greater distance than 15 leagues, but the granitic mountain  called the Foya de Monchique, situated near the Cape, is  perceptible, as pilots allege, at the distance of 26 leagues. If  this assertion be exact, the Foya is 700 toises (1363 metres), and  consequently 116 toises (225 metres) higher than Vesuvius.    From Corunna to the 36th degree of latitude we had scarcely seen  any organic being, excepting sea-swallows and a few dolphins. We  looked in vain for sea-weeds (fuci) and mollusca, when on the 11th  of June we were struck with a curious sight which afterwards was  frequently renewed in the southern ocean. We entered on a zone  where the whole sea was covered with a prodigious quantity of  medusas. The vessel was almost becalmed, but the mollusca were  borne towards the south-east, with a rapidity four times greater  than the current. Their passage lasted near three quarters of an  hour. We then perceived but a few scattered individuals, following  the crowd at a distance as if tired with their journey. Do these  animals come from the bottom of the sea, which is perhaps in these  latitudes some thousand fathoms deep? or do they make distant  voyages in shoals? We know that the mollusca haunt banks; and if  the eight rocks, near the surface, which captain Vobonne mentions  having seen in 1732, to the north of Porto Santo, really exist, we  may suppose that this innumerable quantity of medusas had been  thence detached; for we were but 28 leagues from the reef. We  found, beside the Medusa aurita of Baster, and the Medusa pelagica  of Bosc with eight tentacula (Pelagia denticulata, Peron), a third  species which resembles the Medusa hysocella, and which Vandelli  found at the mouth of the Tagus. It is known by its brownish-yellow  colour, and by its tentacula, which are longer than the body.  Several of these sea-nettles were four inches in diameter: their  reflection was almost metallic: their changeable colours of violet  and purple formed an agreeable contrast with the azure tint of the  ocean.    In the midst of these medusas M. Bonpland observed bundles of  Dagysa notata, a mollusc of a singular construction, which Sir  Joseph Banks first discovered. These are small gelatinous bags,  transparent, cylindrical, sometimes polygonal, thirteen lines long  and two or three in diameter. These bags are open at both ends. In  one of these openings, we observed a hyaline bladder, marked with a  yellow spot. The cylinders lie longitudinally, one against another,  like the cells of a bee-hive, and form chaplets from six to eight  inches in length. I tried the galvanic electricity on these  mollusca, but it produced no contraction. It appears that the genus  dagysa, formed at the time of Cook's first voyage, belongs to the  salpas (biphores of Bruguiere), to which M. Cuvier joins the Thalia  of Brown, and the Tethys vagina of Tilesius. The salpas journey  also by groups, joining in chaplets, as we have observed of the  dagysa.    On the morning of the 13th of June, in 34 degrees 33 minutes  latitude, we saw large masses of this last mollusc in its passage,  the sea being perfectly calm. We observed during the night, that,  of three species of medusas which we collected, none yielded any  light but at the moment of a very slight shock. This property does  not belong exclusively to the Medusa noctiluca, which Forskael has  described in his Fauna Aegyptiaca, and which Gmelin has applied to  the Medusa pelagica of Loefling, notwithstanding its red tentacula,  and the brownish tuberosities of its body. If we place a very  irritable medusa on a pewter plate, and strike against the plate  with any sort of metal, the slight vibrations of the plate are  sufficient to make this animal emit light. Sometimes, in  galvanising the medusa, the phosphorescence appears at the moment  that the chain closes, though the exciters are not in immediate  contact with the organs of the animal. The fingers with which we  touch it remain luminous for two or three minutes, as is observed  in breaking the shell of the pholades. If we rub wood with the body  of a medusa, and the part rubbed ceases shining, the  phosphorescence returns if we pass a dry hand over the wood. When  the light is extinguished a second time, it can no longer be  reproduced, though the place rubbed be still humid and viscous. In  what manner ought we to consider the effect of the friction, or  that of the shock? This is a question of difficult solution. Is it  a slight augmentation of temperature which favours the  phosphorescence? or does the light return, because the surface is  renewed, by putting the animal parts proper to disengage the  phosphoric hydrogen in contact with the oxygen of the atmospheric  air? I have proved by experiments published in 1797, that the  shining of wood is extinguished in hydrogen gas, and in pure azotic  gas, and that its light reappears whenever we mix with it the  smallest bubble of oxygen gas. These facts, to which several others  may be added, tend to explain the causes of the phosphorescence of  the sea, and of that peculiar influence which the shock of the  waves exercises on the production of light.    When we were between the island of Madeira and the coast of Africa,  we had slight breezes and dead calms, very favourable for the  magnetic observations, which occupied me during this passage. We  were never weary of admiring the beauty of the nights; nothing can  be compared to the transparency and serenity of an African sky. We  were struck with the innumerable quantity of falling stars, which  appeared at every instant. The farther progress we made towards the  south, the more frequent was this phenomenon, especially near the  Canaries. I have observed during my travels, that these igneous  meteors are in general more common and luminous in some regions of  the globe than in others; but I have never beheld them so  multiplied as in the vicinity of the volcanoes of the province of  Quito, and in that part of the Pacific ocean which bathes the  volcanic coasts of Guatimala. The influence which place, climate,  and season appear to exercise on the falling stars, distinguishes  this class of meteors from those to which we trace stones that drop  from the sky (aerolites), and which probably exist beyond the  boundaries of our atmosphere. According to the observations of  Messrs. Benzenberg and Brandes, many of the falling stars seen in  Europe have been only thirty thousand toises high. One was even  measured which did not exceed fourteen thousand toises, or five  nautical leagues. These measures, which can give no result but by  approximation, deserve well to be repeated. In warm climates,  especially within the tropics, falling stars leave a tail behind  them, which remains luminous 12 or 15 seconds: at other times they  seem to burst into sparks, and they are generally lower than those  in the north of Europe. We perceive them only in a serene and azure  sky; they have perhaps never been below a cloud. Falling stars  often follow the same direction for several hours, which direction  is that of the wind. In the bay of Naples, M. Gay-Lussac and myself  observed luminous phenomena very analogous to those which fixed my  attention during a long abode at Mexico and Quito. These meteors  are perhaps modified by the nature of the soil and the air, like  certain effects of the looming or mirage, and of the terrestrial  refraction peculiar to the coasts of Calabria and Sicily.    When we were forty leagues east of the island of Madeira, a  swallow* (* Hirundo rustica, Linn.) perched on the topsail-yard. It  was so fatigued, that it suffered itself to be easily taken. It was  remarkable that a bird, in that season, and in calm weather, should  fly so far. In the expedition of d'Entrecasteaux, a common swallow  was seen 60 leagues distant from Cape Blanco; but this was towards  the end of October, and M. Labillardiere thought it had newly  arrived from Europe. We crossed these latitudes in June, at a  period when the seas had not for a long time been agitated by  tempests. I mention this last circumstance, because small birds and  even butterflies, are sometimes forced out to sea by the  impetuosity of the winds, as we observed in the Pacific ocean, when  we were on the western coast of Mexico.    The Pizarro had orders to touch at the isle of Lancerota, one of  the seven great Canary Islands; and at five in the afternoon of the  16th of June, that island appeared so distinctly in view that I was  able to take the angle of altitude of a conic mountain, which  towered majestically over the other summits, and which we thought  was the great volcano which had occasioned such devastation on the  night of the 1st of September, 1730.    The current drew us toward the coast more rapidly than we wished.  As we advanced, we discovered at first the island of Forteventura,  famous for its numerous camels;* (* These camels, which serve for  labour, and sometimes for food, did not exist till the Bethencourts  made the conquest of the Canaries. In the sixteenth century, asses  were so abundant in the island of Forteventura, that they became  wild and were hunted. Several thousands were killed to save the  harvest. The horses of Forteventura are of singular beauty, and of  the Barbary race.--\"Noticias de la Historia General de las Islas  Canarias\" por Don Jose de Viera, tome 2 page 436.) and a short time  after we saw the small island of Lobos in the channel which  separates Forteventura from Lancerota. We spent part of the night  on deck. The moon illumined the volcanic summits of Lancerota, the  flanks of which, covered with ashes, reflected a silver light.  Antares threw out its resplendent rays near the lunar disk, which  was but a few degrees above the horizon. The night was beautifully  serene and cool.

He considered it quite sensible. He  would now, as it was near the hour of rising, present  the clause in its revised form. He hoped, however, that  their Lordships would find time to think out some further  amendments for the evening sitting.    The clause was then read.    His Grace of Canterbury then moved that the House, in  all humility, adjourn for dinner.          The Conjurer's Revenge    \"Now, ladies and gentlemen,\" said the conjurer, \"having  shown you that the cloth is absolutely empty, I will  proceed to take from it a bowl of goldfish. Presto!\"    All around the hall people were saying, \"Oh, how wonderful!  How does he do it?\"    But the Quick Man on the front seat said in a big whisper  to the people near him, \"He-had-it-up-his-sleeve.\"    Then the people nodded brightly at the Quick Man and  said, \"Oh, of course\"; and everybody whispered round the  hall, \"He-had-it-up-his-sleeve.\"    \"My next trick,\" said the conjurer, \"is the famous  Hindostanee rings. You will notice that the rings are  apparently separate; at a blow they all join (clang,  clang, clang)--Presto!\"    There was a general buzz of stupefaction till the Quick  Man was heard to whisper, \"He-must-have-had-another-lot-  up-his-sleeve.\"    Again everybody nodded and whispered, \"The-rings-were-  up-his-sleeve.\"    The brow of the conjurer was clouded with a gathering  frown.    \"I will now,\" he continued, \"show you a most amusing  trick by which I am enabled to take any number of eggs  from a hat. Will some gentleman kindly lend me his hat?  Ah, thank you--Presto!\"    He extracted seventeen eggs, and for thirty-five seconds  the audience began to think that he was wonderful. Then  the Quick Man whispered along the front bench, \"He-has-a-  hen-up-his-sleeve,\" and all the people whispered it on.  \"He-has-a-lot-of-hens-up-his-sleeve.\"    The egg trick was ruined.    It went on like that all through. It transpired from the  whispers of the Quick Man that the conjurer must have  concealed up his sleeve, in addition to the rings, hens,  and fish, several packs of cards, a loaf of bread, a  doll's cradle, a live guinea-pig, a fifty-cent piece,  and a rocking-chair.    The reputation of the conjurer was rapidly sinking below  zero. At the close of the evening he rallied for a final  effort.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"I will present to you,  in conclusion, the famous Japanese trick recently invented  by the natives of Tipperary. Will you, sir,\" he continued  turning toward the Quick Man, \"will you kindly hand me  your gold watch?\"    It was passed to him.    \"Have I your permission to put it into this mortar and  pound it to pieces?\" he asked savagely.    The Quick Man nodded and smiled.    The conjurer threw the watch into the mortar and grasped  a sledge hammer from the table. There was a sound of  violent smashing, \"He's-slipped-it-up-his-sleeve,\"  whispered the Quick Man.    \"Now, sir,\" continued the conjurer, \"will you allow me  to take your handkerchief and punch holes in it? Thank  you. You see, ladies and gentlemen, there is no deception;  the holes are visible to the eye.\"    The face of the Quick Man beamed. This time the real  mystery of the thing fascinated him.    \"And now, sir, will you kindly pass me your silk hat and  allow me to dance on it? Thank you.\"    The conjurer made a few rapid passes with his feet and  exhibited the hat crushed beyond recognition.    \"And will you now, sir, take off your celluloid collar  and permit me to burn it in the candle? Thank you, sir.  And will you allow me to smash your spectacles for you  with my hammer? Thank you.\"    By this time the features of the Quick Man were assuming  a puzzled expression. \"This thing beats me,\" he whispered,  \"I don't see through it a bit.\"    There was a great hush upon the audience. Then the conjurer  drew himself up to his full height and, with a withering  look at the Quick Man, he concluded:    \"Ladies and gentlemen, you will observe that I have, with  this gentleman's permission, broken his watch, burnt his  collar, smashed his spectacles, and danced on his hat.  If he will give me the further permission to paint green  stripes on his overcoat, or to tie his suspenders in a  knot, I shall be delighted to entertain you. If not, the  performance is at an end.\"    And amid a glorious burst of music from the orchestra  the curtain fell, and the audience dispersed, convinced  that there are some tricks, at any rate, that are not  done up the conjurer's sleeve.          Hints to Travellers    The following hints and observations have occurred to me  during a recent trip across the continent: they are  written in no spirit of complaint against existing railroad  methods, but merely in the hope that they may prove useful  to those who travel, like myself, in a spirit of meek,  observant ignorance.    1. Sleeping in a Pullman car presents some difficulties  to the novice. Care should be taken to allay all sense  of danger. The frequent whistling of the engine during  the night is apt to be a source of alarm. Find out,  therefore, before travelling, the meaning of the various  whistles. One means \"station,\" two, \"railroad crossing,\"  and so on. Five whistles, short and rapid, mean sudden  danger. When you hear whistles in the night, sit up  smartly in your bunk and count them. Should they reach  five, draw on your trousers over your pyjamas and leave  the train instantly. As a further precaution against  accident, sleep with the feet towards the engine if you  prefer to have the feet crushed, or with the head towards  the engine, if you think it best to have the head crushed.  In making this decision try to be as unselfish as possible.  If indifferent, sleep crosswise with the head hanging  over into the aisle.    2. I have devoted some thought to the proper method of  changing trains. The system which I have observed to be  the most popular with travellers of my own class, is  something as follows: Suppose that you have been told on  leaving New York that you are to change at Kansas City.  The evening before approaching Kansas City, stop the  conductor in the aisle of the car (you can do this best  by putting out your foot and tripping him), and say  politely, \"Do I change at Kansas City?\" He says \"Yes.\"  Very good. Don't believe him. On going into the dining-car  for supper, take a negro aside and put it to him as a  personal matter between a white man and a black, whether  he thinks you ought to change at Kansas City. Don't be  satisfied with this. In the course of the evening pass  through the entire train from time to time, and say to  people casually, \"Oh, can you tell me if I change at  Kansas City?\" Ask the conductor about it a few more times  in the evening: a repetition of the question will ensure  pleasant relations with him. Before falling asleep watch  for his passage and ask him through the curtains of your  berth, \"Oh, by the way, did you say I changed at Kansas  City?\" If he refuses to stop, hook him by the neck with  your walking-stick, and draw him gently to your bedside.  In the morning when the train stops and a man calls,  \"Kansas City! All change!\" approach the conductor again  and say, \"Is this Kansas City?\" Don't be discouraged at  his answer. Pick yourself up and go to the other end of  the car and say to the brakesman, \"Do you know, sir, if  this is Kansas City?\" Don't be too easily convinced.  Remember that both brakesman and conductor may be in  collusion to deceive you. Look around, therefore, for  the name of the station on the signboard. Having found  it, alight and ask the first man you see if this is Kansas  City. He will answer, \"Why, where in blank are your blank  eyes? Can't you see it there, plain as blank?\" When you  hear language of this sort, ask no more. You are now in  Kansas and this is Kansas City.    3. I have observed that it is now the practice of the  conductors to stick bits of paper in the hats of the  passengers. They do this, I believe, to mark which ones  they like best. The device is pretty, and adds much to  the scenic appearance of the car. But I notice with pain  that the system is fraught with much trouble for the  conductors. The task of crushing two or three passengers  together, in order to reach over them and stick a ticket  into the chinks of a silk skull cap is embarrassing for  a conductor of refined feelings. It would be simpler if  the conductor should carry a small hammer and a packet  of shingle nails and nail the paid-up passenger to the  back of the seat. Or better still, let the conductor  carry a small pot of paint and a brush, and mark the  passengers in such a way that he cannot easily mistake  them. In the case of bald-headed passengers, the hats  might be politely removed and red crosses painted on the  craniums. This will indicate that they are bald. Through  passengers might be distinguished by a complete coat of  paint. In the hands of a man of taste, much might be  effected by a little grouping of painted passengers and  the leisure time of the conductor agreeably occupied.    4. I have observed in travelling in the West that the  irregularity of railroad accidents is a fruitful cause  of complaint. The frequent disappointment of the holders  of accident policy tickets on western roads is leading  to widespread protest. Certainly the conditions of travel  in the West are altering rapidly and accidents can no  longer be relied upon. This is deeply to be regretted,  in so much as, apart from accidents, the tickets may be  said to be practically valueless.          A Manual of Education    The few selections below are offered as a specimen page  of a little book which I have in course of preparation.    Every man has somewhere in the back of his head the wreck  of a thing which he calls his education. My book is  intended to embody in concise form these remnants of  early instruction."]]]
