Shot a couple of hooligans on my  way to business and was forced to give my card to the police. On  arriving at the office was surprised to find the building on  fire, but was just in time to rescue the confidential treaty  between England and Switzerland. Had this been discovered by the  public, war would infallibly have resulted. Went out to lunch and  saw a runaway elephant in the Strand. Thought little of it at the  time, but mentioned it to my wife in the evening. She agreed that  it was worth recording.\"    TUESDAY.--\"Letter from solicitor informing me that I have come  into L1,000,000 through the will of an Australian gold-digger  named Tomkins. On referring to my diary I find that I saved his  life two years ago by plunging into the Serpentine. This is very  gratifying. Was late at the office as I had to look in at the  Palace on the way, in order to get knighted, but managed to get a  good deal of work done before I was interrupted by a madman with  a razor, who demanded L100. Shot him after a desperate struggle.  Tea at an ABC, where I met the Duke of ---. Fell into the Thames  on my way home, but swam ashore without difficulty.\"    Alas! we cannot do this. Our diaries are very prosaic, very dull  indeed. They read like this:--    Monday.--\"Felt inclined to stay in bed this morning and send an  excuse to the office, but was all right after a bath and  breakfast. Worked till 1.30 and had lunch. Afterwards worked till  five, and had my hair cut on the way home. After dinner read A  Man's Passion, by Theodora Popgood. Rotten. Went to bed at  eleven.\"    Tuesday.--\"Had a letter from Jane. Did some good work in the  morning, and at lunch met Henry, who asked me to play golf with  him on Saturday. Told him I was playing with Peter, but said I  would like a game with him on the Saturday after. However, it  turned out he was playing with William then, so we couldn't fix  anything up. Bought a pair of shoes on my way home, but think  they will be too tight. The man says, though, that they will  stretch.\"    Wednesday.--\"Played dominoes at lunch and won fivepence.\"    If this sort of diary is now falling into decay, the world is not  losing much. But at least it is a harmless pleasure to some to  enter up their day's doings each evening, and in years to come it  may just possibly be of interest to the diarist to know that it  was on Monday, 27th April, that he had his hair cut. Again, if in  the future any question arose as to the exact date of Henry's  decease, we should find in this diary proof that anyhow he was  alive as late as Tuesday, 28th April. That might, though it  probably won't, be of great importance. But there is another sort  of diary which can never be of any importance at all. I make no  apology for giving a third selection of extracts.    Monday.--\"Rose at nine and came down to find a letter from Mary.  How little we know our true friends! Beneath the mask of outward  affection there may lurk unknown to us the serpent's tooth of  jealousy. Mary writes that she can make nothing for my stall at  the bazaar as she has her own stall to provide for. Ate my  breakfast mechanically, my thoughts being far away. What, after  all, is life? Meditated deeply on the inner cosmos till lunch-  time. Afterwards I lay down for an hour and composed my mind. I  was angry this morning with Mary. Ah, how petty! Shall I never be  free from the bonds of my own nature? Is the better self within  me never to rise to the sublime heights of selflessness of which  it is capable? Rose at four and wrote to Mary, forgiving her.  This has been a wonderful day for the spirit.\"    Yes; I suspect that a good many diaries record adventures of the  mind and soul for lack of stirring adventures to the body. If  they cannot say, \"Attacked by a lion in Bond Street to-day,\" they  can at least say, \"Attacked by doubt in St. Paul's Cathedral.\"  Most people will prefer, in the absence of the lion, to say  nothing, or nothing more important than \"Attacked by the  hairdresser with a hard brush\"; but there are others who must get  pen to paper somehow, and who find that only in regard to their  emotions have they anything unique to say.    But, of course, there is ever within the breasts of all diarists  the hope that their diaries may some day be revealed to the  world. They may be discovered by some future generation, amazed  at the simple doings of the twentieth century, or their  publication may be demanded by the next generation, eager to know  the inner life of the great man just dead. Best of all, they may  be made public by the writers themselves in their  autobiographies.    Yes; the diarist must always have his eye on a possible  autobiography. \"I remember,\" he will write in that great work,  having forgotten all about it, \"I distinctly remember\"--and here  he will refer to his diary--\"meeting X. at lunch one Sunday and  saying to him ...\"    What he said will not be of much importance, but it will show you  what a wonderful memory the distinguished author retains in his  old age.          Midsummer Day      There is magic in the woods on Midsummer Day--so people tell me.  Titania conducts her revels. Let others attend her court; for  myself I will beg to be excused. I have no heart for revelling on  Midsummer Day. On any other festival I will be as jocund as you  please, but on the longest day of the year I am overburdened by  the thought that from this moment the evenings are beginning to  draw in. We are on the way to winter.    It is on Midsummer Day, or thereabouts, that the cuckoo changes  his tune, knowing well that the best days are over and that in a  little while it will be time for him to fly away. I should like  this to be a learned article on \"The Habits of the Cuckoo,\" and  yet, if it were, I doubt if I should love him at the end of it.  It is best to know only the one thing of him, that he lays his  eggs in another bird's nest--a friendly idea--and beyond that to  take him as we find him. And we find that his only habit which  matters is the delightful one of saying \"Cuckoo.\"    The nightingale is the bird of melancholy, the thrush sings a  disturbing song of the good times to come, the blackbird whistles  a fine, cool note which goes best with a February morning, and  the skylark trills his way to a heaven far out of the reach of  men; and what the lesser white-throat says I have never rightly  understood. But the cuckoo is the bird of present joys; he keeps  us company on the lawns of summer, he sings under a summer sun in  a wonderful new world of blue and green. I think only happy  people hear him. He is always about when one is doing pleasant  things. He never sings when the sun hides behind banks of clouds,  or if he does, it is softly to himself so that he may not lose  the note. Then \"Cuckoo!\" he says aloud, and you may be sure that  everything is warm and bright again.    But now he is leaving us. Where he goes I know not, but I think  of him vaguely as at Mozambique, a paradise for all good birds  who like their days long. If geography were properly taught at  schools, I should know where Mozambique was, and what sort of  people live there. But it may be that, with all these cuckoos  cuckooing and swallows swallowing from July to April, the country  is so full of immigrants that there is no room for a stable  population. It may also be, of course, that Mozambique is not the  place I am thinking of; yet it has a birdish sound.    The year is arranged badly. If Mr. Willett were alive he would do  something about it. Why should the days begin to get shorter at  the moment when summer is fully arrived? Why should it be  possible for the vicar to say that the evenings are drawing in,  when one is still having strawberries for tea? Sometimes I think  that if June were called August, and April June, these things  would be easier to bear. The fact that in what is now called  August we should be telling each other how wonderfully hot it was  for October would help us to bear the slow approach of winter. On  a Midsummer Day in such a calendar one would revel gladly, and  there would be no midsummer madness.    Already the oak trees have taken on an autumn look. I am told  that this is due to a local irruption of caterpillars, and not to  the waning of the summer, but it has a suspicious air. Probably  the caterpillars knew. It seems strange now to reflect that there  was a time when I liked caterpillars; when I chased them up  suburban streets, and took them home to fondle them; when I knew  them all by their pretty names, assisted them to become  chrysalises, and watched over them in that unprotected state as  if I had been their mother. Ah, how dear were my little charges  to me then! But now I class them with mosquitoes and blight and  harvesters, the pests of the countryside. Why, I would let them  crawl up my arm in those happy days of old, and now I cannot even  endure to have them dropping gently into my hair. And I should  not know what to say to a chrysalis.    There are great and good people who know all about solstices and  zeniths, and they can tell you just why it is that 24th June is  so much hotter and longer than 24th December--why it is so in  England, I should say. For I believe (and they will correct me if  I am wrong) that at the equator the days and nights are always of  equal length. This must make calling almost an impossibility, for  if one cannot say to one's hostess, \"How quickly the days are  lengthening (or drawing in),\" one might as well remain at home.  \"How stationary the days are remaining\" might pass on a first  visit, but the old inhabitants would not like it rubbed into  them. They feel, I am sure, that however saddening a Midsummer  Day may be, an unchanging year is much more intolerable. One can  imagine the superiority of a resident who lived a couple of miles"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5805"],[0,"The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel (#12)"],[1," going like that  of a man fighting for his life. \"Here!... at this gate!... not half an  hour ago ... six men ... carriers ... market gardeners ... I seemed to  know their faces....\"    \"Yes! yes! market gardener's carriers,\" exclaimed the officer gleefully,  \"aristocrats all of them ... and that d--d Scarlet Pimpernel. You've got  them? You've detained them?... Where are they?... Speak, man, in the  name of hell!...\"    \"Gone!\" gasped Bibot. His legs would no longer bear him. He fell  backwards on to a heap of street debris and refuse, from which lowly  vantage ground he contrived to give away the whole miserable tale.    \"Gone! half an hour ago. Their passports were in order!... I seemed to  know their faces! Citizen Marat was here.... He, too--\"    In a moment the officer had once more swung his horse round, so that the  animal reared, with wild forefeet pawing the air, with champing of bit,  and white foam scattered around.    \"A thousand million curses!\" he exclaimed. \"Citizen Bibot, your head  will pay for this treachery. Which way did they go?\"    A dozen hands were ready to point in the direction where the merry party  of carriers had disappeared half an hour ago; a dozen tongues gave  rapid, confused explanations.    \"Into it, my men!\" shouted the officer; \"they were on foot! They can't  have gone far. Remember the Republic has offered ten thousand francs for  the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"    Already the heavy gates had been swung open, and the officer's voice  once more rang out clear through a perfect thunder-clap of fast  galloping hoofs:    \"Ventre a terre! Remember!--ten thousand francs to him who first sights  the Scarlet Pimpernel!\"    The thunder-clap died away in the distance, the dust of four score hoofs  was merged in the fog and in the darkness; the voice of the captain was  raised again through the mist-laden air. One shout ... a shout of  triumph ... then silence once again.    Bibot had fainted on the heap of debris.    His comrades brought him wine to drink. He gradually revived. Hope came  back to his heart; his nerves soon steadied themselves as the heavy  beverage filtrated through into his blood.    \"Bah!\" he ejaculated as he pulled himself together, \"the troopers were  well-mounted ... the officer was enthusiastic; those carriers could not  have walked very far. And, in any case, I am free from blame. Citoyen  Marat himself was here and let them pass!\"    A shudder of superstitious terror ran through him as he recollected the  whole scene: for surely he knew all the faces of the six men who had  gone through the gate. The devil indeed must have given the mysterious  Englishman power to transmute himself and his gang wholly into the  bodies of other people.    More than an hour went by. Bibot was quite himself again, bullying,  commanding, detaining everybody now.    At that time there appeared to be a slight altercation going on, on the  farther side of the gate. Bibot thought it his duty to go and see what  the noise was about. Someone wanting to get into Paris instead of out of  it at this hour of the night was a strange occurrence.    Bibot heard his name spoken by a raucous voice. Accompanied by two of  his men he crossed the wide gates in order to see what was happening.  One of the men held a lanthorn, which he was swinging high above his  head. Bibot saw standing there before him, arguing with the guard by the  gate, the bibulous spokesman of the band of carriers.    He was explaining to the sentry that he had a message to deliver to the  citizen commanding at the Porte Montmartre.    \"It is a note,\" he said, \"which an officer of the mounted guard gave me.  He and twenty troopers were galloping down the great North Road not far  from Barency. When they overtook the six of us they drew rein, and the  officer gave me this note for citizen Bibot and fifty francs if I would  deliver it tonight.\"    \"Give me the note!\" said Bibot calmly.    But his hand shook as he took the paper; his face was livid with fear  and rage.    The paper had no writing on it, only the outline of a small scarlet  flower done in red--the device of the cursed Englishman, the Scarlet  Pimpernel.    \"Which way did the officer and the twenty troopers go,\" he stammered,  \"after they gave you this note?\"    \"On the way to Calais,\" replied the other, \"but they had magnificent  horses, and didn't spare them either. They are a league and more away by  now!\"    All the blood in Bibot's body seemed to rush up to his head, a wild  buzzing was in his ears....    And that was how the Duc and Duchesse de Montreux, with their servants  and family, escaped from Paris on that third day of Nivose in the year I  of the Republic.          III    TWO GOOD PATRIOTS      Being the deposition of citizeness Fanny Roussell, who was brought up,  together with her husband, before the Tribunal of the Revolution on a  charge of treason--both being subsequently acquitted.    My name is Fanny Roussell, and I am a respectable married woman, and as  good a patriot as any of you sitting there.    Aye, and I'll say it with my dying breath, though you may send me to the  guillotine ... as you probably will, for you are all thieves and  murderers, every one of you, and you have already made up your minds  that I and my man are guilty of having sheltered that accursed  Englishman whom they call the Scarlet Pimpernel ... and of having helped  him to escape.    But I'll tell you how it all happened, because, though you call me a  traitor to the people of France, yet am I a true patriot and will prove  it to you by telling you exactly how everything occurred, so that you  may be on your guard against the cleverness of that man, who, I do  believe, is a friend and confederate of the devil ... else how could he  have escaped that time?    Well! it was three days ago, and as bitterly cold as anything that my  man and I can remember. We had no travellers staying in the house, for  we are a good three leagues out of Calais, and too far for the folk who  have business in or about the harbour. Only at midday the coffee-room  would get full sometimes with people on their way to or from the port.    But in the evenings the place was quite deserted, and so lonely that at  times we fancied that we could hear the wolves howling in the forest of  St. Pierre.    It was close on eight o'clock, and my man was putting up the shutters,  when suddenly we heard the tramp of feet on the road outside, and then  the quick word, \"Halt!\"    The next moment there was a peremptory knock at the door. My man opened  it, and there stood four men in the uniform of the 9th Regiment of the  Line ... the same that is quartered at Calais. The uniform, of course, I  knew well, though I did not know the men by sight.    \"In the name of the People and by the order of the Committee of Public  Safety!\" said one of the men, who stood in the forefront, and who, I  noticed, had a corporal's stripe on his left sleeve.    He held out a paper, which was covered with seals and with writing, but  as neither my man nor I can read, it was no use our looking at it.    Hercule--that is my husband's name, citizens--asked the corporal what  the Committee of Public Safety wanted with us poor hoteliers of a  wayside inn.    \"Only food and shelter for to-night for me and my men,\" replied the  corporal, quite civilly.    \"You can rest here,\" said Hercule, and he pointed to the benches in the  coffee-room, \"and if there is any soup left in the stockpot, you are  welcome to it.\"    Hercule, you see, is a good patriot, and he had been a soldier in his  day.... No! no ... do not interrupt me, any of you ... you would only be  saying that I ought to have known ... but listen to the end.    \"The soup we'll gladly eat,\" said the corporal very pleasantly. \"As for  shelter ... well! I am afraid that this nice warm coffee-room will not  exactly serve our purpose. We want a place where we can lie hidden, and  at the same time keep a watch on the road. I noticed an outhouse as we  came. By your leave we will sleep in there.\"    \"As you please,\" said my man curtly.    He frowned as he said this, and it suddenly seemed as if some vague  suspicion had crept into Hercule's mind.    The corporal, however, appeared unaware of this, for he went on quite  cheerfully:    \"Ah! that is excellent! Entre nous, citizen, my men and I have a  desperate customer to deal with. I'll not mention his name, for I see  you have guessed it already. A small red flower, what?... Well, we know  that he must be making straight for the port of Calais, for he has been  traced through St. Omer and Ardres. But he cannot possibly enter Calais  city to-night, for we are on the watch for him. He must seek shelter  somewhere for himself and any other aristocrat he may have with him,  and, bar this house, there is no other place between Ardres and Calais  where he can get it. The night is bitterly cold, with a snow blizzard  raging round. I and my men have been detailed to watch this road, other  patrols are guarding those that lead toward Boulogne and to Gravelines;  but I have an idea, citizen, that our fox is making for Calais, and that  to me will fall the honour of handing that tiresome scarlet flower to  the Public Prosecutor en route for Madame la Guillotine.\"    Now I could not really tell you, citizens, what suspicions had by this  time entered Hercule's head or mine; certainly what suspicions we did  have were still very vague.    I prepared the soup for the men and they ate it heartily, after which my  husband led the way to the outhouse where we sometimes stabled a  traveller's horse when the need arose.    It is nice and dry, and always filled with warm, fresh straw. The  entrance into it immediately faces the road; the corporal declared that  nothing would suit him and his men better.    They retired to rest apparently, but we noticed that two men remained on  the watch just inside the entrance, whilst the two others curled "]]]
