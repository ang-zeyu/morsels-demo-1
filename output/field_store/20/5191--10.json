An estimated 9 million tourists  visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer  and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative advantage has recently eroded  as the economies of neighboring France and Spain have been opened up,  providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs. The banking  sector, with its \"tax haven\" status, also contributes substantially to  the economy. Agricultural production is limited - only 2% of the land  is arable - and most food has to be imported.  The principal livestock  activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of  cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.  Andorra is a member of the EU Customs  Union and is treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods  (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.

A 1994 peace accord between the government and the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) provided for  the integration of former UNITA insurgents into the government and armed  forces. A national unity government was installed in April of 1997, but  serious fighting resumed in late 1998, rendering hundreds of thousands of  people homeless. Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost in fighting  over the past quarter century. The death of Jonas SAVIMBI and a cease  fire with UNITA may bode well for the country.

The House debated for some time, and  finally three acts were passed, called the South Sea Act, the Bank Act,  and the General Fund Act. By the first, the proposals of the South Sea  Company were accepted, and that body held itself ready to advance the  sum of two millions towards discharging the principal and interest of  the debt due by the state for the four lottery funds of the ninth and  tenth years of Queen Anne. By the second act, the Bank received a lower  rate of interest for the sum of 1,775,027 pounds 15 shillings due to it  by the state, and agreed to deliver up to be cancelled as many Exchequer  bills as amounted to two millions sterling, and to accept of an annuity  of one hundred thousand pounds, being after the rate of five per cent,  the whole redeemable at one year's notice. They were further required  to be ready to advance, in case of need, a sum not exceeding 2,500,000  pounds upon the same terms of five per cent interest, redeemable by  Parliament. The General Fund Act recited the various deficiencies, which  were to be made good by the aids derived from the foregoing sources.    The name of the South Sea Company was thus continually before the  public. Though their trade with the South American States produced  little or no augmentation of their revenues, they continued to flourish  as a monetary corporation. Their stock was in high request, and the  directors, buoyed up with success, began to think of new means for  extending their influence. The Mississippi scheme of John Law, which  so dazzled and captivated the French people, inspired them with an  idea that they could carry on the same game in England. The anticipated  failure of his plans did not divert them from their intention. Wise in  their own conceit, they imagined they could avoid his faults, carry on  their schemes for ever, and stretch the cord of credit to its extremest  tension, without causing it to snap asunder.    It was while Law's plan was at its greatest height of popularity, while  people were crowding in thousands to the Rue Quincampoix, and ruining  themselves with frantic eagerness, that the South Sea directors laid  before Parliament their famous plan for paying off the national debt.  Visions of boundless wealth floated before the fascinated eyes of the  people in the two most celebrated countries of Europe. The English  commenced their career of extravagance somewhat later than the French;  but as soon as the delirium seized them, they were determined not to be  outdone. Upon the 22nd of January 1720, the House of Commons resolved  itself into a Committee of the whole House, to take into consideration  that part of the King's speech at the opening of the session which  related to the public debts, and the proposal of the South Sea Company  towards the redemption and sinking of the same. The proposal set forth  at great length, and under several heads, the debts of the state,  amounting to 30,981,712 pounds, which the Company were anxious to take  upon themselves, upon consideration of five per cent. per annum, secured  to them until Midsummer 1727; after which time, the whole was to become  redeemable at the pleasure of the legislature, and the interest to be  reduced to four per cent. The proposal was received with great favour;  but the Bank of England had many friends in the House of Commons, who  were desirous that that body should share in the advantages that were  likely to accrue. On behalf of this corporation it was represented, that  they had performed great and eminent services to the state, in the most  difficult times, and deserved, at least, that if any advantage was to be  made by public bargains of this nature, they should be preferred before  a company that had never done any thing for the nation. The further  consideration of the matter was accordingly postponed for five days.  In the mean time, a plan was drawn up by the Governors of the Bank.  The South Sea Company, afraid that the Bank might offer still more  advantageous terms to the government than themselves, reconsidered their  former proposal, and made some alterations in it, which they hoped would  render it more acceptable. The principal change was a stipulation that  the government might redeem these debts at the expiration of four years,  instead of seven, as at first suggested. The Bank resolved not to be  outbidden in this singular auction, and the Governors also reconsidered  their first proposal, and sent in a new one.    Thus, each corporation having made two proposals, the House began to  deliberate. Mr. Robert Walpole was the chief speaker in favour of the  Bank, and Mr. Aislabie, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the principal  advocate on behalf of the South Sea Company. It was resolved, on the 2nd  of February, that the proposals of the latter were most advantageous  to the country. They were accordingly received, and leave was given to  bring in a bill to that effect.    Exchange Alley was in a fever of excitement. The Company's stock, which  had been at a hundred and thirty the previous day, gradually rose to  three hundred, and continued to rise with the most astonishing rapidity  during the whole time that the bill in its several stages was under  discussion. Mr. Walpole was almost the only statesman in the House who  spoke out boldly against it. He warned them, in eloquent and solemn  language, of the evils that would ensue. It countenanced, he said, \"the  dangerous practice of stockjobbing, and would divert the genius of the  nation from trade and industry. It would hold out a dangerous lure to  decoy the unwary to their ruin, by making them part with the earnings of  their labour for a prospect of imaginary wealth.\" The great principle  of the project was an evil of first-rate magnitude; it was to raise  artificially the value of the stock, by exciting and keeping up a  general infatuation, and by promising dividends out of funds which could  never be adequate to the purpose. In a prophetic spirit he added,  that if the plan succeeded, the directors would become masters of the  government, form a new and absolute aristocracy in the kingdom, and  control the resolutions of the legislature. If it failed, which he was  convinced it would, the result would bring general discontent and ruin  upon the country. Such would be the delusion, that when the evil day  came, as come it would, the people would start up, as from a dream, and  ask themselves if these things could have been true. All his eloquence  was in vain. He was looked upon as a false prophet, or compared to the  hoarse raven, croaking omens of evil. His friends, however, compared him  to Cassandra, predicting evils which would only be believed when they  came home to men's hearths, and stared them in the face at their own  boards. Although, in former times, the House had listened with the  utmost attention to every word that fell from his lips, the benches  became deserted when it was known that he would speak on the South Sea  question.    The bill was two months in its progress through the House of Commons.  During this time every exertion was made by the directors and their  friends, and more especially by the Chairman, the noted Sir John Blunt,  to raise the price of the stock. The most extravagant rumours were in  circulation. Treaties between England and Spain were spoken of, whereby  the latter was to grant a free trade to all her colonies; and the rich  produce of the mines of Potosi-la-Paz was to be brought to England until  silver should become almost as plentiful as iron. For cotton and woollen  goods, with which we could supply them in abundance, the dwellers  in Mexico were to empty their golden mines. The company of merchants  trading to the South Seas would be the richest the world ever saw, and  every hundred pounds invested in it would produce hundreds per annum  to the stockholder. At last the stock was raised by these means to  near four hundred; but, after fluctuating a good deal, settled at three  hundred and thirty, at which price it remained when the bill passed the  Commons by a majority of 172 against 55.    In the House of Lords the bill was hurried through all its stages with  unexampled rapidity. On the 4th of April it was read a first time; on  the 5th, it was read a second time; on the 6th, it was committed; and on  the 7th, was read a third time, and passed.    Several peers spoke warmly against the scheme; but their warnings fell  upon dull, cold ears. A speculating frenzy had seized them as well  as the plebeians. Lord North and Grey said the bill was unjust in its  nature, and might prove fatal in its consequences, being calculated to  enrich the few and impoverish the many. The Duke of Wharton followed;  but, as he only retailed at second-hand the arguments so eloquently  stated by Walpole in the Lower House, he was not listened to with even  the same attention that had been bestowed upon Lord North and Grey. Earl  Cowper followed on the same side, and compared the bill to the famous  horse of the siege of Troy. Like that, it was ushered in and received  with great pomp and acclamations of joy, but bore within it treachery  and destruction. The Earl of Sunderland endeavoured to answer all  objections; and, on the question being put, there appeared only  seventeen peers against, and eighty-three in favour of the project.  The very same day on which it passed the Lords, it received the Royal  assent, and became the law of the land.    It seemed at that time as if the whole nation had turned stockjobbers.  Exchange Alley was every day blocked up by crowds, and Cornhill was  impassable for the number of carriages. Everybody came to purchase  stock. \"Every fool aspired to be a knave.\" In the words of a ballad,  published at the time, and sung about the streets, [\"A South Sea Ballad;  or, Merry Remarks upon Exchange Alley Bubbles.
