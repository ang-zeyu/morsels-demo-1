I said that the book in which the story had appeared was published in  1889. I asked him how long ago it was that he had been on his fishing  tour, because it was important to know in order to bring the charge  home against Jerome. Well, after a bit, I was amazed, and pained, too,  to hear Comrade Bickersdyke urging certain bravoes in the audience to  turn me out. If ever there was a case of biting the hand that fed  him.... Well, well.... By this time the meeting had begun to take sides  to some extent. What I might call my party, the Earnest Investigators,  were whistling between their fingers, stamping on the floor, and  shouting, \"Chestnuts!\" while the opposing party, the bravoes, seemed to  be trying, as I say, to do jiu-jitsu tricks with me. It was a painful  situation. I know the cultivated man of affairs should have passed the  thing off with a short, careless laugh; but, owing to the  above-mentioned alcohol-expert having got both hands under my collar,  short, careless laughs were off. I was compelled, very reluctantly, to  conclude the interview by tapping the bright boy on the jaw. He took  the hint, and sat down on the floor. I thought no more of the matter,  and was making my way thoughtfully to the exit, when a second man of  wrath put the above on my forehead. You can't ignore a thing like that.  I collected some of his waistcoat and one of his legs, and hove him  with some vim into the middle distance. By this time a good many of the  Earnest Investigators were beginning to join in; and it was just there  that the affair began to have certain points of resemblance to a  pantomime rally. Everybody seemed to be shouting a good deal and  hitting everybody else. It was no place for a man of delicate culture,  so I edged towards the door, and drifted out. There was a cab in the  offing. I boarded it. And, having kicked a vigorous politician in the  stomach, as he was endeavouring to climb in too, I drove off home.'    Psmith got up, looked at his forehead once more in the glass, sighed,  and sat down again.    'All very disturbing,' he said.    'Great Scott,' said Mike, 'I wish I'd come. Why on earth didn't you  tell me you were going to rag? I think you might as well have done. I  wouldn't have missed it for worlds.'    Psmith regarded him with raised eyebrows.    'Rag!' he said. 'Comrade Jackson, I do not understand you. You surely  do not think that I had any other object in doing what I did than to  serve Comrade Bickersdyke? It's terrible how one's motives get  distorted in this world of ours.'    'Well,' said Mike, with a grin, 'I know one person who'll jolly well  distort your motives, as you call it, and that's Bickersdyke.'    Psmith looked thoughtful.    'True,' he said, 'true. There is that possibility. I tell you, Comrade  Jackson, once more that my bright young life is being slowly blighted  by the frightful way in which that man misunderstands me. It seems  almost impossible to try to do him a good turn without having the  action misconstrued.'    'What'll you say to him tomorrow?'    'I shall make no allusion to the painful affair. If I happen to meet  him in the ordinary course of business routine, I shall pass some  light, pleasant remark--on the weather, let us say, or the Bank  rate--and continue my duties.'    'How about if he sends for you, and wants to do the light, pleasant  remark business on his own?'    'In that case I shall not thwart him. If he invites me into his private  room, I shall be his guest, and shall discuss, to the best of my  ability, any topic which he may care to introduce. There shall be no  constraint between Comrade Bickersdyke and myself.'    'No, I shouldn't think there would be. I wish I could come and hear  you.'    'I wish you could,' said Psmith courteously.    'Still, it doesn't matter much to you. You don't care if you do get  sacked.'    Psmith rose.    'In that way possibly, as you say, I am agreeably situated. If the New  Asiatic Bank does not require Psmith's services, there are other  spheres where a young man of spirit may carve a place for himself. No,  what is worrying me, Comrade Jackson, is not the thought of the push.  It is the growing fear that Comrade Bickersdyke and I will never  thoroughly understand and appreciate one another. A deep gulf lies  between us. I do what I can do to bridge it over, but he makes no  response. On his side of the gulf building operations appear to be at  an entire standstill. That is what is carving these lines of care on my  forehead, Comrade Jackson. That is what is painting these purple  circles beneath my eyes. Quite inadvertently to be disturbing Comrade  Bickersdyke, annoying him, preventing him from enjoying life. How sad  this is. Life bulges with these tragedies.'    Mike picked up the evening paper.    'Don't let it keep you awake at night,' he said. 'By the way, did you  see that Manchester United were playing this afternoon? They won. You'd  better sit down and sweat up some of the details. You'll want them  tomorrow.'    'You are very right, Comrade Jackson,' said Psmith, reseating himself.  'So the Mancunians pushed the bulb into the meshes beyond the uprights  no fewer than four times, did they? Bless the dear boys, what spirits  they do enjoy, to be sure. Comrade Jackson, do not disturb me. I must  concentrate myself. These are deep waters.'          12. In a Nutshell      Mr Bickersdyke sat in his private room at the New Asiatic Bank with a  pile of newspapers before him. At least, the casual observer would have  said that it was Mr Bickersdyke. In reality, however, it was an active  volcano in the shape and clothes of the bank-manager. It was freely  admitted in the office that morning that the manager had lowered all  records with ease. The staff had known him to be in a bad temper  before--frequently; but his frame of mind on all previous occasions had  been, compared with his present frame of mind, that of a rather  exceptionally good-natured lamb. Within ten minutes of his arrival the  entire office was on the jump. The messengers were collected in a  pallid group in the basement, discussing the affair in whispers and  endeavouring to restore their nerve with about sixpenn'orth of the  beverage known as 'unsweetened'. The heads of departments, to a man,  had bowed before the storm. Within the space of seven minutes and a  quarter Mr Bickersdyke had contrived to find some fault with each of  them. Inward Bills was out at an A.B.C. shop snatching a hasty cup of  coffee, to pull him together again. Outward Bills was sitting at his  desk with the glazed stare of one who has been struck in the thorax by  a thunderbolt. Mr Rossiter had been torn from Psmith in the middle of a  highly technical discussion of the Manchester United match, just as he  was showing--with the aid of a ball of paper--how he had once seen  Meredith centre to Sandy Turnbull in a Cup match, and was now leaping  about like a distracted grasshopper. Mr Waller, head of the Cash  Department, had been summoned to the Presence, and after listening  meekly to a rush of criticism, had retired to his desk with the air of  a beaten spaniel.    Only one man of the many in the building seemed calm and happy--Psmith.    Psmith had resumed the chat about Manchester United, on Mr Rossiter's  return from the lion's den, at the spot where it had been broken off;  but, finding that the head of the Postage Department was in no mood for  discussing football (or any thing else), he had postponed his remarks  and placidly resumed his work.    Mr Bickersdyke picked up a paper, opened it, and began searching the  columns. He had not far to look. It was a slack season for the  newspapers, and his little trouble, which might have received a  paragraph in a busy week, was set forth fully in three-quarters of a  column.    The column was headed, 'Amusing Heckling'.    Mr Bickersdyke read a few lines, and crumpled the paper up with a  snort.    The next he examined was an organ of his own shade of political  opinion. It too, gave him nearly a column, headed 'Disgraceful Scene at  Kenningford'. There was also a leaderette on the subject.    The leaderette said so exactly what Mr Bickersdyke thought himself that  for a moment he was soothed. Then the thought of his grievance  returned, and he pressed the bell.    'Send Mr Smith to me,' he said.    William, the messenger, proceeded to inform Psmith of the summons.    Psmith's face lit up.    'I am always glad to sweeten the monotony of toil with a chat with  Little Clarence,' he said. 'I shall be with him in a moment.'    He cleaned his pen very carefully, placed it beside his ledger, flicked  a little dust off his coatsleeve, and made his way to the manager's  room.    Mr Bickersdyke received him with the ominous restraint of a tiger  crouching for its spring. Psmith stood beside the table with languid  grace, suggestive of some favoured confidential secretary waiting for  instructions.    A ponderous silence brooded over the room for some moments. Psmith  broke it by remarking that the Bank Rate was unchanged. He mentioned  this fact as if it afforded him a personal gratification.    Mr Bickersdyke spoke.    'Well, Mr Smith?' he said.    'You wished to see me about something, sir?' inquired Psmith,  ingratiatingly.    'You know perfectly well what I wished to see you about. I want to hear  your explanation of what occurred last night.'    'May I sit, sir?'    He dropped gracefully into a chair, without waiting for permission,  and, having hitched up the knees of his trousers, beamed winningly at  the manager.    'A deplorable affair,' he said, with a shake of his head. 'Extremely  deplorable. We must not judge these rough, uneducated men too harshly,  however. In a time of excitement the emotions of the lower classes are  easily stirred. Where you or I would--'    Mr Bickersdyke interrupted.    'I do not wish for any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6762"],[0,"Politics: A Treatise on Government (#12)"],[1,"s, as the property  is divided amongst the whole community, be their numbers what they will;  but as it could not then be divided, the supernumeraries, whether they  were many or few, would have nothing at all. But it is more necessary  than even to regulate property, to take care that the increase of the  people should not exceed a certain number; and in determining that,  to take into consideration those children who will die, and also those  women who will be barren; and to neglect this, as is done in several  cities, is to bring certain poverty on the citizens; and poverty is the  cause of sedition and evil. Now Phidon the Corinthian, one of the oldest  legislators, thought the families and the number of the citizens should  continue the same; although it should happen that all should have  allotments at the first, disproportionate to their numbers.    In Plato's Laws it is however different; we shall mention hereafter what  we think would be best in these particulars. He has also neglected in  that treatise to point out how the governors are to be distinguished  from the governed; for he says, that as of one sort of wool the warp  ought to be made, and of another the woof, so ought some to govern, and  others to be governed. But since he admits, that all their property may  be increased fivefold, why should he not allow the same increase to the  country? he ought also to consider whether his allotment of the houses  will be useful to the community, for he appoints two houses to each  person, separate from each other; but it is inconvenient for a person  to inhabit two houses. Now he is desirous to have his whole plan of  government neither a democracy nor an oligarchy, but something between  both, which he calls a polity, for it is to be composed of men-at-arms.  If Plato intended to frame a state in which more than in any other  everything should be common, he has certainly given it a right name;  but if he intended it to be the next in perfection to that which he had  already framed, it is not so; for perhaps some persons will give the  preference to the Lacedaemonian form of government, or some other which  may more completely have attained to the aristocratic form.    Some persons say, that the most perfect government should be composed  of all others blended together, for which reason they commend that  of Lacedaemon; for they say, that this is composed of an oligarchy,  a monarchy, and a democracy, their kings representing the monarchical  part, the senate the oligarchical; and, that in the ephori may be found  the democratical, as these are taken from the people. But some say, that  in the ephori is absolute power, and that it is their common meal and  daily course of life, in which the democratical form is represented.  It is also said in this treatise of [1266a] Laws, that the best form of  government must, be one composed of a democracy and a tyranny; though  such a mixture no one else would ever allow to be any government at all,  or if it is, the worst possible; those propose what is much better who  blend many governments together; for the most perfect is that which is  formed of many parts. But now in this government of Plato's there are  no traces of a monarchy, only of an oligarchy and democracy; though he  seems to choose that it should rather incline to an oligarchy, as is  evident from the appointment of the magistrates; for to choose them by  lot is common to both; but that a man of fortune must necessarily be a  member of the assembly, or to elect the magistrates, or take part in the  management of public affairs, while others are passed over, makes the  state incline to an oligarchy; as does the endeavouring that the  greater part of the rich may be in office, and that the rank of their  appointments may correspond with their fortunes.    The same principle prevails also in the choice of their senate; the  manner of electing which is favourable also to an oligarchy; for all  are obliged to vote for those who are senators of the first class,  afterwards they vote for the same number out of the second, and then out  of the third; but this compulsion to vote at the election of senators  does not extend to the third and fourth classes and the first and second  class only are obliged to vote for the fourth. By this means he says  he shall necessarily have an equal number of each rank, but he is  mistaken--for the majority will always consist of those of the first  rank, and the most considerable people; and for this reason, that  many of the commonalty not being obliged to it, will not attend the  elections. From hence it is evident, that such a state will not consist  of a democracy and a monarchy, and this will be further proved by  what we shall say when we come particularly to consider this form of  government.    There will also great danger arise from the manner of electing the  senate, when those who are elected themselves are afterwards to elect  others; for by this means, if a certain number choose to combine  together, though not very considerable, the election will always fall  according to their pleasure. Such are the things which Plato proposes  concerning government in his book of Laws.          CHAPTER VII      There are also some other forms of government, which have been proposed  either by private persons, or philosophers, or politicians, all of which  come much nearer to those which have been really established, or now  exist, than these two of Plato's; for neither have they introduced the  innovation of a community of wives and children, and public tables for  the women, but have been contented to set out with establishing such  rules as are absolutely necessary.    There are some persons who think, that the first object of government  should be to regulate well everything relating to private property;  for they say, that a neglect herein is the source of all seditions  whatsoever. For this reason, Phaleas the Chalcedonian first proposed,  that the fortunes of the citizens should be equal, which he thought was  not difficult to accomplish when a community was first settled, but  that it was a work of greater difficulty in one that had been long  established; but yet that it might be effected, and an equality of  circumstances introduced by these means, that the rich should give  marriage portions, but never receive any, while the poor should always  receive, but never give.    But Plato, in his treatise of Laws, thinks that a difference in  circumstances should be permitted to a certain degree; but that no  citizen should be allowed to possess more than five times as much as the  lowest census, as we have already mentioned. But legislators who  would establish this principle are apt to overlook what they ought to  consider; that while they regulate the quantity of provisions which each  individual shall possess, they ought also to regulate the number of his  children; for if these exceed the allotted quantity of provision, the  law must necessarily be repealed; and yet, in spite of the repeal, it  will have the bad effect of reducing many from wealth to poverty, so  difficult is it for innovators not to fall into such mistakes. That an  equality of goods was in some degree serviceable to strengthen the bands  of society, seems to have been known to some of the ancients; for Solon  made a law, as did some others also, to restrain persons from possessing  as much land as they pleased. And upon the same principle there are laws  which forbid men to sell their property, as among the Locrians, unless  they can prove that some notorious misfortune has befallen them. They  were also to preserve their ancient patrimony, which custom being broken  through by the Leucadians, made their government too democratic; for  by that means it was no longer necessary to be possessed of a certain  fortune to be qualified to be a magistrate. But if an equality of goods  is established, this may be either too much, when it enables the people  to live luxuriously, or too little, when it obliges them to live  hard. Hence it is evident, that it is not proper for the legislator  to establish an equality of circumstances, but to fix a proper medium.  Besides, if any one should regulate the division of property in such a  manner that there should be a moderate sufficiency for all, it would  be of no use; for it is of more consequence that the citizen should  entertain a similarity of sentiments than an equality of circumstances;  but this can never be attained unless they are properly educated under  the direction of the law. But probably Phaleas may say, that this in  what he himself mentions; for he both proposes a equality of property  and one plan of education in his city. But he should have said  particularly what education he intended, nor is it of any service to  have this to much one; for this education may be one, and yet such as  will make the citizens over-greedy, to grasp after honours, or riches,  or both. Besides, not only an inequality of possessions, but also  of honours, will occasion [1267a] seditions, but this upon contrary  grounds; for the vulgar will be seditious if there be an inequality of  goods, by those of more elevated sentiments, if there is an equality of  honours.      \"When good and bad do equal honours share.\"    For men are not guilty of crimes for necessaries only (for which he  thinks an equality of goods would be a sufficient remedy, as they would  then have no occasion to steal cold or hunger), but that they may enjoy  what they desire, and not wish for it in vain; for if their desire extend  beyond the common necessaries of life, they were be wicked to gratify  them; and not only so, but if their wishes point that way, they will do  the same to enjoy those pleasures which are free from the alloy of pain.  What remedy then shall we find for these three disorders? And first,  to prevent stealing from necessity, let every one be supplied with a  moderate"]]]
