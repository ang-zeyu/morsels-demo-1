Well, the little mouse said to them: \"Leave me  down, and I will get the little box for you.\" So the mouse stole into  the castle, and got hold of the box; and when he was coming down the  stairs, it fell down, and he was very near being caught. He came running  out with it, laughing his best. \"Have you got it?\" Jack said to him; he  said: \"Yes;\" and off they went back again, and left the castle behind.    As they were all of them (Jack, mouse, frog, and eagle) passing over  the great sea, they fell to quarrelling about which it was that got the  little box, till down it slipped into the water. (It was by them looking  at it and handing it from one hand to the other that they dropped the  little box to the bottom of the sea.) \"Well, well,\" said the frog, \"I  knew that I would have to do something, so you had better let me go down  in the water.\" And they let him go, and he was down for three days and  three nights; and up he comes, and shows his nose and little mouth out  of the water; and all of them asked him, Did he get it? and he told  them, No. \"Well, what are you doing there, then?\" \"Nothing at all,\" he  said, \"only I want my full breath;\" and the poor little frog went down  the second time, and he was down for a day and a night, and up he brings  it.    And away they did go, after being there four days and nights; and after  a long tug over seas and mountains, arrive at the palace of the old  King, who is the master of all the birds in the world. And the King  is very proud to see them, and has a hearty welcome and a long  conversation. Jack opens the little box, and told the little men to go  back and to bring the castle here to them; \"and all of you make as much  haste back again as you possibly can.\"    The three little men went off; and when they came near the castle they  were afraid to go to it till the gentleman and lady and all the servants  were gone out to some dance. And there was no one left behind there only  the cook and another maid with her; and the little red men asked them  which would they rather--go, or stop behind? and they both said: \"I will  go with you;\" and the little men told them to run upstairs quick. They  were no sooner up and in one of the drawing-rooms than here comes just  in sight the gentleman and lady and all the servants; but it was too  late. Off the castle went at full speed, with the women laughing at them  through the window, while they made motions for them to stop, but all to  no purpose.    They were nine days on their journey, in which they did try to keep the  Sunday holy, when one of the little men turned to be the priest, the  other the clerk, and third presided at the organ, and the women were  the singers, for they had a grand chapel in the castle already. Very  remarkable, there was a discord made in the music, and one of the little  men ran up one of the organ-pipes to see where the bad sound came  from, when he found out it only happened to be that the two women were  laughing at the little red man stretching his little legs full length  on the bass pipes, also his two arms the same time, with his little red  night-cap, which he never forgot to wear, and what they never witnessed  before, could not help calling forth some good merriment while on the  face of the deep. And poor thing! through them not going on with what  they begun with, they very near came to danger, as the castle was once  very near sinking in the middle of the sea.    At length, after a merry journey, they come again to Jack and the King.  The King was quite struck with the sight of the castle; and going up the  golden stairs, went to see the inside.    The King was very much pleased with the castle, but poor Jack's time of  a twelvemonths and a day was drawing to a close; and he, wishing to  go home to his young wife, gives orders to the three little men to  get ready by the next morning at eight o'clock to be off to the next  brother, and to stop there for one night; also to proceed from there  to the last or the youngest brother, the master of all the mice in the  world, in such place where the castle shall be left under his care until  it's sent for. Jack takes a farewell of the King, and thanks him very  much for his hospitality.    Away went Jack and his castle again, and stopped one night in that  place; and away they went again to the third place, and there left the  castle under his care. As Jack had to leave the castle behind, he had to  take to his own horse, which he left there when he first started.    Now poor Jack leaves his castle behind and faces towards home; and  after having so much merriment with the three brothers every night, Jack  became sleepy on horseback, and would have lost the road if it was not  for the little men a-guiding him. At last he arrived weary and tired,  and they did not seem to receive him with any kindness whatever,  because he had not found the stolen castle; and to make it worse, he was  disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet  him, through being hindered by her parents. But that did not stop long.  Jack put full power on and despatched the little men off to bring the  castle from there, and they soon got there.    Jack shook hands with the King, and returned many thanks for his kingly  kindness in minding the castle for him; and then Jack instructed the  little men to spur up and put speed on. And off they went, and were not  long before they reached their journey's end, when out comes the young  wife to meet him with a fine lump of a young SON, and they all lived  happy ever afterwards.          THE STORY OF THE THREE BEARS    Once upon a time there were Three Bears, who lived together in a house  of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little, Small Wee Bear; and  one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great, Huge Bear. They  had each a pot for their porridge, a little pot for the Little, Small,  Wee Bear; and a middle-sized pot for the Middle Bear, and a great pot  for the Great, Huge Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little  chair for the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the  Middle Bear; and a great chair for the Great, Huge Bear. And they had  each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little, Small, Wee Bear;  and a middle-sized bed for the Middle Bear; and a great bed for the  Great, Huge Bear.    One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and  poured it into their porridge-pots, they walked out into the wood while  the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths, by  beginning too soon to eat it. And while they were walking, a little  old Woman came to the house. She could not have been a good, honest old  Woman; for first she looked in at the window, and then she peeped in at  the keyhole; and seeing nobody in the house, she lifted the latch. The  door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody  any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So the  little old Woman opened the door, and went in; and well pleased she was  when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a good little  old Woman, she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then,  perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good  Bears--a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all  that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, bad old  Woman, and set about helping herself.    So first she tasted the porridge of the Great, Huge Bear, and that was  too hot for her; and she said a bad word about that. And then she tasted  the porridge of the Middle Bear, and that was too cold for her; and she  said a bad word about that too. And then she went to the porridge of the  Little, Small, Wee Bear, and tasted that; and that was neither too hot,  nor too cold, but just right; and she liked it so well, that she ate  it all up: but the naughty old Woman said a bad word about the little  porridge-pot, because it did not hold enough for her.    Then the little old Woman sate down in the chair of the Great, Huge  Bear, and that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair  of the Middle Bear, and that was too soft for her. And then she sate  down in the chair of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and that was neither  too hard, nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and  there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came,  plump upon the ground. And the naughty old Woman said a wicked word  about that too.    Then the little old Woman went upstairs into the bed-chamber in which  the three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great,  Huge Bear; but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay  down upon the bed of the Middle Bear; and that was too high at the foot  for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little, Small, Wee  Bear; and that was neither too high at the head, nor at the foot, but  just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till  she fell fast asleep.    By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool  enough; so they came home to breakfast. Now the little old Woman had  left the spoon of the Great, Huge Bear, standing in his porridge.    \"Somebody has been at my porridge!\"    said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice. And when  the Middle Bear looked at his, he saw that the spoon was standing in it  too. They were wooden spoons; if they had been silver ones, the naughty  old Woman would have put them in her pocket.    \"Somebody has been at my porridge!\"    said the Middle Bear in his middle voice.    Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon  in the porridge-pot, but the porridge was all gone.    \"Somebody has been at my porridge, and has eaten it all up!\"    said "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7440"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#12)"],[1,"tribes,  those of Kenânah, al Hareth Ebn Caaba, and Kendah1 in particular, and in time  became very powerful, and possessed of several towns and fortresses there.  But the Jewish religion was not unknown to the Arabs, at least above a century  before; Abu Carb Asad, taken notice of in the Korân,2 who was king of Yaman,  about 700 years before Mohammed, is said to have introduced Judaism among the  idolatrous Hamyarites.  Some of his successors also embraced the same  religion, one of whom, Yusef, surnamed Dhu Nowâs,3 was remarkable for his zeal  and terrible persecution of all who would not turn Jews, putting them to death  by various tortures, the most common of which was throwing them into a glowing  pit of fire, whence he had the opprobrious appellation of the Lord of the Pit.  This persecution is also mentioned in the Korân.4     Christianity had likewise made a very great progress among this nation  before Mohammed.  Whether St. Paul preached in any part of Arabia, properly so  called,5 is uncertain; but the persecutions and disorders which happened in  the eastern church soon after the beginning of the third century, obliged  great numbers of Christians to seek for shelter in that country of liberty,  who, being for the most part of the Jacobite communion, that sect generally  prevailed among the Arabs.6  The principal tribes that embraced Christianity  were Hamyar, Ghassân, Rabiâ, Taghlab, Bahrâ, Tonûch,7 part of the tribes of  Tay and Kodâa, the inhabitants of Najrân, and the Arabs of Hira.8  As to the  two last, it may be observed that those of Najrân became Christians in the  time of Dhu Nowâs,9 and very probably, if the story be true, were some of  those who were converted on the following occasion, which happened about that  time, or not long before.  The Jews of Hamyar challenged some neighbouring  Christians to a public disputation, which was held sub dio for three days  before the king and his nobility and all the people, the disputants being  Gregentius, bishop of Tephra (which I take to be Dhafâr) for the Christians,  and Herbanus for the Jews.  On the third day, Herbanus, to end the dispute,  de-       4  Al Mostatraf.  5  In his Hist. Relig. Vet.

Spec. p. 63.          manded that Jesus of Nazareth, if he were really living and in heaven, and  could hear the prayers of his worshippers, should appear from heaven in their  sight, and they would then believe in him; the Jews crying out with one voice,  \"Show us your Christ, alas! and we will become Christians.\"  Whereupon, after  a terrible storm of thunder and lightning, Jesus Christ appeared in the air,  surrounded with rays of glory, walking on a purple cloud, having a sword in  his hand, and an inestimable diadem on his head, and spake these words over  the heads of the assembly: \"Behold I appear to you in your sight, I, who was  crucified by your fathers.\"  After which the cloud received him from their  sight.  The Christians cried out, \"Kyrie eleeson,\" i.e., \"Lord, have mercy  upon us;\" but the Jews were stricken blind, and recovered not till they were  all baptized.1     The Christians at Hira received a great accession by several tribes, who  fled thither for refuge from the persecution of Dhu Nowâs.  Al Nooman,  surnamed Abu Kabûs, king of Hira, who was slain a few months before Mohammed's  birth, professed himself a Christian on the following occasion.  This prince,  in a drunken fit, ordered two of his intimate companions, who overcame with  liquor had fallen asleep, to be buried alive.  When he came to himself, he was  extremely concerned at what he had done, and to expiate his crime, not only  raised a monument to the memory of his friends, but set apart two days, one of  which he called the unfortunate, and the other the fortunate day; making it a  perpetual rule to himself, that whoever met him on the former day should be  slain, and his blood sprinkled on the monument, but he that met him on the  other day should be dismissed in safety, with magnificent gifts.  On one of  those unfortunate days there came before him accidentally an Arab, of the  tribe of Tay, who had once entertained this king, when fatigued with hunting,  and separated from his attendants.  The king, who could neither discharge him,  contrary to the order of the day, nor put him to death, against the laws of  hospitality, which the Arabians religiously observe, proposed, as an  expedient, to give the unhappy man a year's respite, and to send him home with  rich gifts for the support of his family, on condition that he found a surety  for his returning at the year's end to suffer death.  One of the prince's  court, out of compassion, offered himself as his surety, and the Arab was  discharged.  When the last day of the term came, and no news of the Arab, the  king, not at all displeased to save his host's life, ordered the surety to  prepare himself to die.  Those who were by represented to the king that the  day was not yet expired, and therefore he ought to have patience till the  evening: but in the middle of their discourse the Arab appeared.  The king,  admiring the man's generosity, in offering himself to certain death, which he  might have avoided by letting his surety suffer, asked him what was his motive  for his so doing? to which he answered, that he had been taught to act in that  manner by the religion he professed; and al Nooman demanding what religion  that was, he replied, the Christian.  Whereupon the king desiring to have the  doctrines of Christianity explained to him, was baptized, he and his subjects;  and not only pardoned the man and his surety, but    1  Vide Gregentii disput. cum Herbano Judæo.         abolished his barbarous custom.1  This prince, however, was not the first  king of Hira who embraced Christianity; al Mondar, his grandfather, having  also professed the same faith, and built large churches in his capital.2     Since Christianity had made so great a progress in Arabia, we may  consequently suppose they had bishops in several parts, for the more orderly  governing of the churches.  A bishop of Dhafâr has been already named, and we  are told that Najrân was also a bishop's see.3  The Jacobites (of which sect  we have observed the Arabs generally were) had two bishops of the Arabs  subject to their Mafriân, or metropolitan of the east; one was called the  bishop of the Arabs absolutely, whose seat was for the most part at Akula,  which some others make the same with Cûfa,4 others a different town near  Baghdâd.5  The other had the title of bishop of the Scenite Arabs, of the  tribe of Thaalab in Hira, or Hirta, as the Syrians call it, whose seat was in  that city.  The Nestorians ahd but one bishop, who presided over both these  dioceses of Hira and Akula, and was immediately subject to their patriarch.6     These were the principal religions which obtained among the ancient Arabs;  but as freedom of thought was the natural consequence of their political  liberty and independence, some of them fell into other different opinions.  The Koreish, in particular, were infected with Zendicism,7 an error supposed  to have very near affinity with that of the Sadducees among the Jews, and,  perhaps, not greatly different from Deism; for there were several of that  tribe, even before the time of Mohammed, who worshipped one GOD, and were free  from idolatry,8 and yet embraced none of the other religions of the country.     The Arabians before Mohammed were, as they yet are, divided into two sorts,  those who dwell in cities and towns, and those who dwell in tents.  The former  lived by tillage, the cultivation of palm trees, breeding and feeding of  cattle, and the exercise of all sorts of trades,1 particularly merchandising,2  wherein they were very eminent, even in the time of Jacob.  The tribe of  Koreish were much addicted to commerce, and Mohammed, in his younger years,  was brought up to the same business; it being customary for the Arabians to  exercise the same trade that their parents did.3  The Arabs who dwelt in  tents, employed themselves in pasturage, and sometimes in pillaging of  passengers; they lived chiefly on the milk and flesh of camels; they often  changed their habitations, as the convenience of water and of pasture for  their cattle invited them, staying in a place no longer than that lasted, and  then removing in search of other.4  They generally wintered in Irâk and the  confines of Syria.  This way of life is what the greater part of Ismael's  posterity have used, as more agreeable to the temper and way of life of their  father; and is so well described by a late author,5 that I cannot do better  than refer the reader to his account of them.       1  Al Meidani and Ahmed Ebn Yusef, apud Poc.
