It will be noticed that, according to Paul, (see Gal. 3:8)      the Gospel was preached to Abraham. We would like to be informed      in what name the Gospel was then preached, whether it was in the      name of Christ or some other name. If in any other name, was it the      Gospel? And if it was the Gospel, and that preached in the name of      Christ, had it any ordinances? If not, was it the Gospel? And if it      had ordinances what were they? Our friends may say, perhaps, that      there were never any ordinances except those of offering sacrifices      before the coming of Christ, and that it could not be possible for      the Gospel to have been administered while the law of sacrifices      of blood was in force. But we will recollect that Abraham offered      sacrifice, and notwithstanding this, had the Gospel preached to      him. That the offering of sacrifice was only to point the mind      forward to Christ, we infer from these remarkable words of Jesus      to the Jews: \"Your Father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he      saw it, and was glad\" (John 8:56.) So, then, because the ancients      offered sacrifice it did not hinder their hearing the Gospel; but      served, as we said before, to open their eyes, and enable them to      look forward to the time of the coming of the Savior, and rejoice      in His redemption. We find also, that when the Israelites came out      of Egypt they had the Gospel preached to them, according to Paul in      his letter to the Hebrews, which says: \"For unto us was the Gospel      preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not      profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it\" (see      Heb. 4:2). It is said again, in Gal. 3:19, that the law (of Moses,      or the Levitical law) was \"added\" because of transgression. What,      we ask, was this law added to, if it was not added to the Gospel?      It must be plain that it was added to the Gospel, since we learn      that they had the Gospel preached to them. From these few facts,      we conclude that whenever the Lord revealed Himself to men in      ancient days, and commanded them to offer sacrifice to Him, that it      was done that they might look forward in faith to the time of His      coming, and rely upon the power of that atonement for a remission      of their sins. And this they have done, thousands who have gone      before us, whose garments are spotless, and who are, like Job,      waiting with an assurance like his, that they will see Him in the      _latter day_ upon the earth, even in their flesh,        We may conclude, that though there were different dispensations,      yet all things which God communicated to His people were calculated      to draw their minds to the great object, and to teach them to rely      upon God alone as the author of their salvation, as contained in      His law.        {18} From what we can draw from the Scriptures relative to the      teachings of heaven, we are induced to think that much instruction      has been given to man since the beginning which we do not possess      now. This may not agree with the opinions of some of our friends      who are bold to say that we have everything written in the Bible      which God ever spoke to man since the world began, and that if he      had ever said anything more we should certainly have received it.      But we ask, does it remain for a people who never had faith enough      to call down one scrap of revelation from heaven, and for all they      have now are indebted to the faith of another people who lived      hundreds and thousands of years before them, does it remain for      them to say how much God has spoken and how much he has not spoken?      We have what we have, and the Bible contains what it does contain:      but to say that God never said anything more to man than is there      recorded, would be saying at once that we have at last received a      revelation; for it must require one to advance thus far, because it      is nowhere said in that volume by the mouth of God, that He would      not, after giving, what is there contained, speak again; and if      any man has found out for a fact that the Bible contains all that      God ever revealed to man he has ascertained it by an immediate      revelation, other than has been previously written by the prophets      and apostles. But through the kind providence of our Father a      portion of His word which He delivered to His ancient saints, has      fallen into our hands, is presented to us with a promise of a      reward if obeyed, and with a penalty if disobeyed. That all are      deeply interested in these laws or teachings, must be admitted by      all who acknowledge their divine authenticity.        It may be proper for us to notice in this place a few of the many      blessings held out in this law of heaven as a reward to those who      obey its teachings. God has appointed a day in which He will judge      the world, and this He has given an assurance of in that He raised      up His Son Jesus Christ from the dead--the point on which the      hope of all who believe the inspired record is founded for their      future happiness and enjoyment; because, \"If Christ be not risen,\"      said Paul to the Corinthians, \"your faith is vain, ye are yet in      your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ have      perished\" (see 1 Cor. 15). If the resurrection from the dead be      not an important point, or item in our faith, we must confess that      we know nothing about it; for if there be no resurrection from the      dead, then Christ has not risen; and if Christ has not risen He      was not the Son of God; and if He was not the Son of God, there      is not nor cannot be a Son of God, if the present book called the      Scriptures is true; because the time has gone by when, according to      that book, He was to make His appearance. On this subject, however,      we are reminded of the words of Peter to the Jewish Sanhedrim, when      {19} speaking of Christ, he says that God raised Him from the dead,      and we (the apostles) are His witnesses of these things, and so is      the Holy Ghost, whom God had given to them that obey Him (see Acts      5). So that after the testimony of the Scriptures on this point,      the assurance is given by the Holy Ghost, bearing witness to those      who obey Him, that Christ Himself has assuredly risen from the      dead; and if He has risen from the dead. He will, by His power,      bring all men to stand before Him: for if He is risen from the      dead the bands of the temporal death are broken that the grave has      no victory, If then, the grave has no victory, those who keep the      sayings of Jesus and obey His teachings have not only a promise of      a resurrection from the dead, but an assurance of being admitted      into His glorious kingdom; for, He himself says, \"Where I am, there      also shall my servant be\" (see John 11).        In the 22nd chapter of Luke's account of the Messiah, we find      the kingdom of heaven likened unto a king who made a marriage      for his son. That this son was the Messiah will not be disputed,      since it was the kingdom of heaven that was represented in the      parable; and that the Saints, or those who are found faithful to      the Lord, are the individuals who will be found worthy to merit a      seat at the marriage supper, is evident from the sayings of John      in the Revelation where he represents the sound which he heard in      heaven to be like a great multitude, or like the voice of mighty      thunderings, saying, the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth. Let us be      glad and rejoice, and give honor to Him; for the marriage of the      Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself ready. And to her was      granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white:      For the fine linen is the righteousness of Saints (Rev. 19).        That those who keep the commandments of the Lord and walk in His      statutes to the end, are the only individuals permitted to sit at      this glorious feast, is evident from the following items in Paul's      last letter to Timothy, which was written just previous to his      death,--he says: \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my      course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me      a crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous Judge shall      give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also      that love His appearing.\" No one who believes the account, will      doubt for a moment this assertion of Paul which was made, as he      knew, just before he was to take his leave of this world. Though he      once, according to his own word, persecuted the Church of God and      wasted it, yet after embracing the faith, his labors were unceasing      to spread the glorious news: and like a faithful soldier, when      called to give his life in the cause which he had espoused, he      laid it down, as he says, with an assurance of an eternal crown.      Follow the labors of this Apostle from the time of his conversion      to the time of his death, and you will have a fair {20} sample      of industry and patience in promulgating the Gospel of Christ.      Derided, whipped, and stoned, the moment he escaped the hands of      his persecutors he as zealously as ever proclaimed the doctrine of      the Savior. And all may know that he did not embrace the faith for      honor in this life, nor for the gain of earthly goods. What, then,      could have induced him to undergo all this toil? It was, as he      said, that he might obtain the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#12)"],[1,"to them, as  they exist unperceived, is that they produce those perceivable effects  which in truth cannot be ascribed to anything but Spirit.    62. (FOURTHLY.)--But, to come nigher the difficulty, it must be observed  that though the fabrication of all those parts and organs be not  absolutely necessary to the producing any effect, yet it is necessary  to the producing of things in a constant regular way according to  the laws of nature. There are certain general laws that run through  the whole chain of natural effects; these are learned by the observation  and study of nature, and are by men applied as well to the framing  artificial things for the use and ornament of life as to the  explaining various phenomena--which explication consists only in  showing the conformity any particular phenomenon has to the general  laws of nature, or, which is the same thing, in discovering the  uniformity there is in the production of natural effects; as will  be evident to whoever shall attend to the several instances wherein  philosophers pretend to account for appearances. That there is a  great and conspicuous use in these regular constant methods of  working observed by the Supreme Agent has been shown in sect. 31.  And it is no less visible that a particular size, figure, motion,  and disposition of parts are necessary, though not absolutely to  the producing any effect, yet to the producing it according to the  standing mechanical laws of nature. Thus, for instance, it cannot be  denied that God, or the Intelligence that sustains and rules the ordinary  course of things, might if He were minded to produce a miracle, cause all  the motions on the dial-plate of a watch, though nobody had ever made the  movements and put them in it: but yet, if He will act agreeably to the  rules of mechanism, by Him for wise ends established and maintained in  the creation, it is necessary that those actions of the watchmaker,  whereby he makes the movements and rightly adjusts them, precede the  production of the aforesaid motions; as also that any disorder in them be  attended with the perception of some corresponding disorder in the  movements, which being once corrected all is right again.    63. It may indeed on some occasions be necessary that the Author of  nature display His overruling power in producing some appearance out of  the ordinary series of things. Such exceptions from the general rules of  nature are proper to surprise and awe men into an acknowledgement of the  Divine Being; but then they are to be used but seldom, otherwise there is  a plain reason why they should fail of that effect. Besides, God seems to  choose the convincing our reason of His attributes by the works of  nature, which discover so much harmony and contrivance in their make, and  are such plain indications of wisdom and beneficence in their Author,  rather than to astonish us into a belief of His Being by anomalous and  surprising events.    64. To set this matter in a yet clearer light, I shall observe that what  has been objected in sect. 60 amounts in reality to no more than  this:--ideas are not anyhow and at random produced, there being a certain  order and connexion between them, like to that of cause and effect; there  are also several combinations of them made in a very regular and  artificial manner, which seem like so many instruments in the hand of  nature that, being hid as it were behind the scenes, have a secret  operation in producing those appearances which are seen on the theatre of  the world, being themselves discernible only to the curious eye of the  philosopher. But, since one idea cannot be the cause of another, to what  purpose is that connexion? And, since those instruments, being barely  inefficacious perceptions in the mind, are not subservient to the  production of natural effects, it is demanded why they are made; or, in  other words, what reason can be assigned why God should make us, upon a  close inspection into His works, behold so great variety of ideas so  artfully laid together, and so much according to rule; it not being  credible that He would be at the expense (if one may so speak) of all  that art and regularity to no purpose.    65. To all which my answer is, first, that the connexion of ideas does  not imply the relation of cause and effect, but only of a mark or sign  with the thing signified. The fire which I see is not the cause of the  pain I suffer upon my approaching it, but the mark that forewarns me of  it. In like manner the noise that I hear is not the effect of this or  that motion or collision of the ambient bodies, but the sign thereof.  Secondly, the reason why ideas are formed into machines, that is,  artificial and regular combinations, is the same with that for combining  letters into words. That a few original ideas may be made to signify a  great number of effects and actions, it is necessary they be variously  combined together. And, to the end their use be permanent and universal,  these combinations must be made by rule, and with wise contrivance. By  this means abundance of information is conveyed unto us, concerning what  we are to expect from such and such actions and what methods are proper  to be taken for the exciting such and such ideas; which in effect is all  that I conceive to be distinctly meant when it is said that, by  discerning a figure, texture, and mechanism of the inward parts of  bodies, whether natural or artificial, we may attain to know the several  uses and properties depending thereon, or the nature of the thing.    66. PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER.--Hence, it is evident  that those things which, under the notion of a cause co-operating  or concurring to the production of effects, are altogether inexplicable,  and run us into great absurdities, may be very naturally explained,  and have a proper and obvious use assigned to them, when they are  considered only as marks or signs for our information. And it is  the searching after and endeavouring to understand those signs  instituted by the Author of Nature, that ought to be the employment of  the natural philosopher; and not the pretending to explain things by  corporeal causes, which doctrine seems to have too much estranged the  minds of men from that active principle, that supreme and wise Spirit \"in  whom we live, move, and have our being.\"    67. TWELFTH OBJECTION.--ANSWER.--In the twelfth place, it may perhaps  be objected that--though it be clear from what has been said that  there can be no such thing as an inert, senseless, extended, solid,  figured, movable substance existing without the mind, such as  philosophers describe Matter--yet, if any man shall leave out of  his idea of matter the positive ideas of extension, figure, solidity  and motion, and say that he means only by that word an inert,  senseless substance, that exists without the mind or unperceived,  which is the occasion of our ideas, or at the presence whereof God is  pleased to excite ideas in us: it doth not appear but that Matter taken  in this sense may possibly exist. In answer to which I say, first, that  it seems no less absurd to suppose a substance without accidents, than it  is to suppose accidents without a substance. But secondly, though we  should grant this unknown substance may possibly exist, yet where can it  be supposed to be? That it exists not in the mind is agreed; and that it  exists not in place is no less certain--since all place or extension  exists only in the mind, as has been already proved. It remains  therefore that it exists nowhere at all.    68. MATTER SUPPORTS NOTHING, AN ARGUMENT AGAINST ITS EXISTENCE.--Let us  examine a little the description that is here given us of  matter. It neither acts, nor perceives, nor is perceived; for this is all  that is meant by saying it is an inert, senseless, unknown substance;  which is a definition entirely made up of negatives, excepting only the  relative notion of its standing under or supporting. But then it must be  observed that it supports nothing at all, and how nearly this comes to  the description of a nonentity I desire may be considered. But, say you,  it is the unknown occasion, at the presence of which ideas are excited in  us by the will of God. Now, I would fain know how anything can be present  to us, which is neither perceivable by sense nor reflexion, nor capable  of producing any idea in our minds, nor is at all extended, nor has any  form, nor exists in any place. The words \"to be present,\" when thus  applied, must needs be taken in some abstract and strange meaning, and  which I am not able to comprehend.    69. Again, let us examine what is meant by occasion. So far as I can  gather from the common use of language, that word signifies either the  agent which produces any effect, or else something that is observed to  accompany or go before it in the ordinary course of things. But when it  is applied to Matter as above described, it can be taken in neither of  those senses; for Matter is said to be passive and inert, and so cannot  be an agent or efficient cause. It is also unperceivable, as being devoid  of all sensible qualities, and so cannot be the occasion of our  perceptions in the latter sense: as when the burning my finger is said to  be the occasion of the pain that attends it. What therefore can be meant  by calling matter an occasion? The term is either used in no sense at  all, or else in some very distant from its received signification.    70. You will Perhaps say that Matter, though it be not perceived by us,  is nevertheless perceived by God, to whom it is the occasion of exciting  ideas in our minds. For, say you, since we observe our sensations to be  imprinted in an orderly and constant manner, it is but reasonable to  suppose there are certain constant and regular occasions of their being  produced. That is to say, that there are certain permanent and distinct  parcels of Matter, corresponding to our "]]]
