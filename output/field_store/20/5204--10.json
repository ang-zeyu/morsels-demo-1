The best peg on which to hang an expedition in the Department of the  South, in those days, was the promise of lumber. Dwelling in the very  land of Southern pine, the Department authorities had to send North for  it, at a vast expense. There was reported to be plenty in the enemy's  country, but somehow the colored soldiers were the only ones who had  been lucky enough to obtain any, thus far, and the supply brought in by  our men, after flooring the tents of the white regiments and our own,  was running low. An expedition of white troops, four companies, with two  steamers and two schooners, had lately returned empty-handed, after a  week's foraging; and now it was our turn. They said the mills were all  burned; but should we go up the St. Mary's, Corporal Sutton was prepared  to offer more lumber than we had transportation to carry. This made  the crowning charm of his suggestion. But there is never any danger of  erring on the side of secrecy, in a military department; and I resolved  to avoid all undue publicity for our plans, by not finally deciding on  any until we should get outside the bar. This was happily approved by  my superior officers, Major-General Hunter and Brigadier-General Saxton;  and I was accordingly permitted to take three steamers, with four  hundred and sixty-two officers and men, and two or three invited  guests, and go down the coast on my own responsibility. We were, in  short, to win our spurs; and if, as among the Araucanians, our spurs  were made of lumber, so much the better. The whole history of the  Department of the South had been defined as \"a military picnic,\" and now  we were to take our share of the entertainment.    It seemed a pleasant share, when, after the usual vexations and delays,  we found ourselves (January 23, 1863) gliding down the full waters of  Beaufort River, the three vessels having sailed at different hours, with  orders to rendezvous at St. Simon's Island, on the coast of Georgia.  Until then, the flagship, so to speak, was to be the \"Ben De Ford,\"  Captain Hallet,--this being by far the largest vessel, and carrying most  of the men. Major Strong was in command upon the \"John Adams,\" an army  gunboat, carrying a thirty-pound Parrott gun, two ten-pound Parrotts,  and an eight-inch howitzer. Captain Trowbridge (since promoted  Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment) had charge of the famous \"Planter,\"  brought away from the Rebels by Robert Small; she carried a ten-pound  Parrott gun, and two howitzers. The John Adams was our main reliance.  She was an old East Boston ferry-boat, a \"double-ender,\" admirable for  river-work, but unfit for sea-service. She drew seven feet of water; the  Planter drew only four; but the latter was very slow, and being obliged  to go to St. Simon's by an inner passage, would delay us from the  beginning. She delayed us so much, before the end, that we virtually  parted company, and her career was almost entirely separated from our  own.    From boyhood I have had a fancy for boats, and have seldom been without  a share, usually more or less fractional, in a rather indeterminate  number of punts and wherries. But when, for the first time, I found  myself at sea as Commodore of a fleet of armed steamers,--for even the  Ben De Ford boasted a six-pounder or so,--it seemed rather an unexpected  promotion. But it is a characteristic of army life, that one adapts  one's self, as coolly as in a dream, to the most novel responsibilities.  One sits on court-martial, for instance, and decides on the life of a  fellow-creature, without being asked any inconvenient questions as to  previous knowledge of Blackstone; and after such an experience, shall  one shrink from wrecking a steamer or two in the cause of the nation? So  I placidly accepted my naval establishment, as if it were a new form of  boat-club, and looked over the charts, balancing between one river and  another, as if deciding whether to pull up or down Lake Quinsigamond. If  military life ever contemplated the exercise of the virtue of humility  under any circumstances this would perhaps have been a good opportunity  to begin its practice. But as the \"Regulations\" clearly contemplated  nothing of the kind, and as I had never met with any precedent which  looked in that direction, I had learned to check promptly all such weak  proclivities.    Captain Hallett proved the most frank and manly of sailors, and did  everything for our comfort. He was soon warm in his praises of the  demeanor of our men, which was very pleasant to hear, as this was the  first time that colored soldiers in any number had been conveyed on  board a transport, and I know of no place where a white volunteer  appears to so much disadvantage. His mind craves occupation, his body is  intensely uncomfortable, the daily emergency is not great enough to call  out his heroic qualities, and he is apt to be surly, discontented, and  impatient even of sanitary rules. The Southern black soldier, on the  other hand, is seldom sea-sick (at least, such is my experience), and,  if properly managed, is equally contented, whether idle or busy; he is,  moreover, so docile that all needful rules are executed with cheerful  acquiescence, and the quarters can therefore be kept clean and  wholesome. Very forlorn faces were soon visible among the officers in  the cabin, but I rarely saw such among the men.    Pleasant still seemed our enterprise, as we anchored at early morning in  the quiet waters of St. Simon's Sound, and saw the light fall softly on  the beach and the low bluffs, on the picturesque plantation-houses which  nestled there, and the graceful naval vessels that lay at anchor before  us. When we afterwards landed the air had that peculiar Mediterranean  translucency which Southern islands wear; and the plantation we visited  had the loveliest tropical garden, though tangled and desolate, which I  have ever seen in the South. The deserted house was embowered In great  blossoming shrubs, and filled with hyacinthine odors, among which  predominated that of the little Chickasaw roses which everywhere bloomed  and trailed around. There were fig-trees and date-palms, crape-myrtles  and wax-myrtles, Mexican agaves and English ivies, japonicas, bananas,  oranges, lemons, oleanders, jonquils, great cactuses, and wild Florida  lilies. This was not the plantation which Mrs. Kemble has since made  historic, although that was on the same island; and I could not waste  much sentiment over it, for it had belonged to a Northern renegade,  Thomas Butler King. Yet I felt then, as I have felt a hundred  times since, an emotion of heart-sickness at this desecration of a  homestead,--and especially when, looking from a bare upper window of the  empty house upon a range of broad, flat, sunny roofs, such as children  love to play on, I thought how that place might have been loved by yet  Innocent hearts, and I mourned anew the sacrilege of war.    I had visited the flag-ship Wabash ere we left Port Royal Harbor, and  had obtained a very kind letter of introduction from Admiral Dupont,  that stately and courtly potentate, elegant as one's ideal French  marquis; and under these credentials I received polite attention from  the naval officers at St. Simon's,--Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Budd, of  the gunboat Potomska, and Acting Master Moses, of the barque Fernandina.  They made valuable suggestions in regard to the different rivers along  the coast, and gave vivid descriptions of the last previous trip up the  St. Mary's undertaken by Captain Stevens, U.S.N., in the gunboat Ottawa,  when he had to fight his way past batteries at every bluff in descending  the narrow and rapid stream. I was warned that no resistance would be  offered to the ascent, but only to our return; and was further cautioned  against the mistake, then common, of underrating the courage of the  Rebels. \"It proved impossible to dislodge those fellows from the banks,\"  my informant said; \"they had dug rifle-pits, and swarmed like hornets,  and when fairly silenced in one direction they were sure to open upon us  from another.\" All this sounded alarming, but it was nine months since  the event had happened; and although nothing had gone up the river  meanwhile, I counted on less resistance now. And something must be  risked anywhere.    We were delayed all that day in waiting for our consort, and  improved our time by verifying certain rumors about a quantity of new  railroad-iron which was said to be concealed in the abandoned Rebel  forts on St. Simon's and Jekyll Islands, and which would have much value  at Port Royal, if we could unearth it. Some of our men had worked upon  these very batteries, so that they could easily guide us; and by the  additional discovery of a large flat-boat we were enabled to go to work  in earnest upon the removal of the treasure. These iron bars, surmounted  by a dozen feet of sand, formed an invulnerable roof for the magazines  and bomb-proofs of the fort, and the men enjoyed demolishing them far  more than they had relished their construction. Though the day was the  24th of January, 1863, the sun was very oppressive upon the sands; but  all were in the highest spirits, and worked with the greatest zeal. The  men seemed to regard these massive bars as their first trophies; and if  the rails had been wreathed with roses, they could not have been got out  in more holiday style. Nearly a hundred were obtained that day,  besides a quantity of five-inch plank with which to barricade the very  conspicuous pilot-houses of the John Adams. Still another day we were  delayed, and could still keep at this work, not neglecting some foraging  on the island from which horses, cattle, and agricultural implements  were to be removed, and the few remaining colored families transferred  to Fernandina. I had now become quite anxious about the missing  steamboat, as the inner passage, by which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/677"],[0,"The Heroes; Or, Greek Fairy Tales for My Children (#12)"],[1,"Achilles, whose bride was silver-footed Thetis, the goddess of  the sea.  And thither came Telamon and Oileus, the fathers of the two  Aiantes, who fought upon the plains of Troy; and Mopsus, the wise  soothsayer, who knew the speech of birds; and Idmon, to whom Phoebus gave  a tongue to prophesy of things to come; and Ancaios, who could read the  stars, and knew all the circles of the heavens; and Argus, the famed  shipbuilder, and many a hero more, in helmets of brass and gold with tall  dyed horse-hair crests, and embroidered shirts of linen beneath their  coats of mail, and greaves of polished tin to guard their knees in fight;  with each man his shield upon his shoulder, of many a fold of tough  bull's hide, and his sword of tempered bronze in his silver-studded belt;  and in his right hand a pair of lances, of the heavy white ash-staves.    So they came down to Iolcos, and all the city came out to meet them, and  were never tired with looking at their height, and their beauty, and  their gallant bearing and the glitter of their inlaid arms.  And some  said, 'Never was such a gathering of the heroes since the Hellens  conquered the land.'  But the women sighed over them, and whispered,  'Alas! they are all going to their death!'    Then they felled the pines on Pelion, and shaped them with the axe, and  Argus taught them to build a galley, the first long ship which ever  sailed the seas.  They pierced her for fifty oars--an oar for each hero  of the crew--and pitched her with coal-black pitch, and painted her bows  with vermilion; and they named her _Argo_ after Argus, and worked at her  all day long.  And at night Pelias feasted them like a king, and they  slept in his palace-porch.    But Jason went away to the northward, and into the land of Thrace, till  he found Orpheus, the prince of minstrels, where he dwelt in his cave  under Rhodope, among the savage Cicon tribes.  And he asked him, 'Will  you leave your mountains, Orpheus, my fellow-scholar in old times, and  cross Strymon once more with me, to sail with the heroes of the Minuai,  and bring home the golden fleece, and charm for us all men and all  monsters with your magic harp and song?'    Then Orpheus sighed, 'Have I not had enough of toil and of weary  wandering, far and wide since I lived in Cheiron's cave, above Iolcos by  the sea?  In vain is the skill and the voice which my goddess mother gave  me; in vain have I sung and laboured; in vain I went down to the dead,  and charmed all the kings of Hades, to win back Eurydice my bride.  For I  won her, my beloved, and lost her again the same day, and wandered away  in my madness, even to Egypt and the Libyan sands, and the isles of all  the seas, driven on by the terrible gadfly, while I charmed in vain the  hearts of men, and the savage forest beasts, and the trees, and the  lifeless stones, with my magic harp and song, giving rest, but finding  none.  But at last Calliope my mother delivered me, and brought me home  in peace; and I dwell here in the cave alone, among the savage Cicon  tribes, softening their wild hearts with music and the gentle laws of  Zeus.  And now I must go out again, to the ends of all the earth, far  away into the misty darkness, to the last wave of the Eastern Sea.  But  what is doomed must be, and a friend's demand obeyed; for prayers are the  daughters of Zeus, and who honours them honours him.'    Then Orpheus rose up sighing, and took his harp, and went over Strymon.  And he led Jason to the south-west, up the banks of Haliacmon and over  the spurs of Pindus, to Dodona the town of Zeus, where it stood by the  side of the sacred lake, and the fountain which breathed out fire, in the  darkness of the ancient oakwood, beneath the mountain of the hundred  springs.  And he led him to the holy oak, where the black dove settled in  old times, and was changed into the priestess of Zeus, and gave oracles  to all nations round.  And he bade him cut down a bough, and sacrifice to  Hera and to Zeus; and they took the bough and came to Iolcos, and nailed  it to the beak-head of the ship.    And at last the ship was finished, and they tried to launch her down the  beach; but she was too heavy for them to move her, and her keel sank deep  into the sand.  Then all the heroes looked at each other blushing; but  Jason spoke, and said, 'Let us ask the magic bough; perhaps it can help  us in our need.'    Then a voice came from the bough, and Jason heard the words it said, and  bade Orpheus play upon the harp, while the heroes waited round, holding  the pine-trunk rollers, to help her toward the sea.    Then Orpheus took his harp, and began his magic song--'How sweet it is to  ride upon the surges, and to leap from wave to wave, while the wind sings  cheerful in the cordage, and the oars flash fast among the foam!  How  sweet it is to roam across the ocean, and see new towns and wondrous  lands, and to come home laden with treasure, and to win undying fame!'    And the good ship _Argo_ heard him, and longed to be away and out at sea;  till she stirred in every timber, and heaved from stem to stern, and  leapt up from the sand upon the rollers, and plunged onward like a  gallant horse; and the heroes fed her path with pine-trunks, till she  rushed into the whispering sea.    Then they stored her well with food and water, and pulled the ladder up  on board, and settled themselves each man to his oar, and kept time to  Orpheus' harp; and away across the bay they rowed southward, while the  people lined the cliffs; and the women wept, while the men shouted, at  the starting of that gallant crew.        PART IV  HOW THE ARGONAUTS SAILED TO COLCHIS      And what happened next, my children, whether it be true or not, stands  written in ancient songs, which you shall read for yourselves some day.  And grand old songs they are, written in grand old rolling verse; and  they call them the Songs of Orpheus, or the Orphics, to this day.  And  they tell how the heroes came to Aphetai, across the bay, and waited for  the south-west wind, and chose themselves a captain from their crew: and  how all called for Heracles, because he was the strongest and most huge;  but Heracles refused, and called for Jason, because he was the wisest of  them all.  So Jason was chosen captain; and Orpheus heaped a pile of  wood, and slew a bull, and offered it to Hera, and called all the heroes  to stand round, each man's head crowned with olive, and to strike their  swords into the bull.  Then he filled a golden goblet with the bull's  blood, and with wheaten flour, and honey, and wine, and the bitter  salt-sea water, and bade the heroes taste.  So each tasted the goblet,  and passed it round, and vowed an awful vow: and they vowed before the  sun, and the night, and the blue-haired sea who shakes the land, to stand  by Jason faithfully in the adventure of the golden fleece; and whosoever  shrank back, or disobeyed, or turned traitor to his vow, then justice  should minister against him, and the Erinnues who track guilty men.    Then Jason lighted the pile, and burnt the carcase of the bull; and they  went to their ship and sailed eastward, like men who have a work to do;  and the place from which they went was called Aphetai, the sailing-place,  from that day forth.  Three thousand years and more they sailed away,  into the unknown Eastern seas; and great nations have come and gone since  then, and many a storm has swept the earth; and many a mighty armament,  to which _Argo_ would be but one small boat; English and French, Turkish  and Russian, have sailed those waters since; yet the fame of that small  _Argo_ lives for ever, and her name is become a proverb among men.    So they sailed past the Isle of Sciathos, with the Cape of Sepius on  their left, and turned to the northward toward Pelion, up the long  Magnesian shore.  On their right hand was the open sea, and on their left  old Pelion rose, while the clouds crawled round his dark pine-forests,  and his caps of summer snow.  And their hearts yearned for the dear old  mountain, as they thought of pleasant days gone by, and of the sports of  their boyhood, and their hunting, and their schooling in the cave beneath  the cliff.  And at last Peleus spoke, 'Let us land here, friends, and  climb the dear old hill once more.  We are going on a fearful journey;  who knows if we shall see Pelion again?  Let us go up to Cheiron our  master, and ask his blessing ere we start.  And I have a boy, too, with  him, whom he trains as he trained me once--the son whom Thetis brought  me, the silver-footed lady of the sea, whom I caught in the cave, and  tamed her, though she changed her shape seven times.  For she changed, as  I held her, into water, and to vapour, and to burning flame, and to a  rock, and to a black-maned lion, and to a tall and stately tree.  But I  held her and held her ever, till she took her own shape again, and led  her to my father's house, and won her for my bride.  And all the rulers  of Olympus came to our wedding, and the heavens and the earth rejoiced  together, when an Immortal wedded mortal man.  And now let me see my son;  for it is not often I shall see him upon earth: famous he will be, but  short-lived, and die in the flower of youth.'    So Tiphys the helmsman steered them to the shore under the crags of  Pelion; and they went up through the dark pine-forests towards the  Centaur's cave.    And they came into the misty hall, beneath the snow-crowned crag; and saw  the great Centaur lying, with his huge limbs spread upon the rock; and  beside him stood Achilles, the child whom no steel could wound, and  played upon his harp right sweetly, while Cheiron watched and smiled.    Then Cheiron leapt up and welcomed them, and kissed them every one, and  set a feast before them of swine's flesh, and venison, and good wine; and  young Achilles served them, and carried the golden goblet round.  And  after supper all the heroes clapped their hands,"]]]
