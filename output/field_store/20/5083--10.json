When discovered by the brethren, an old stone altar  was there, which has since been thrown down. It was the place where  Adam called his posterity together three years before his death and  blessed them; so that holy memories as well as fond anticipations are  associated with the place. W. W. Phelps is the author of the hymn.        CHAPTER VIII.    \"I HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY\"--AMUSING CONVERSATION--VOYAGE TO  ENGLAND--APPOINTED TO PREACH IN LIVERPOOL--PEOPLE PREPARED TO RECEIVE  THE GOSPEL--BEGINS WORK--BAPTISMS.    When Elder Taylor arrived in New York, Elder Woodruff had been there  some time, and was all impatience to embark for England, but as yet the  former had no means with which to pay for his ocean passage. Although  supplied with all the means necessary on his journey thus far, after  paying his cab-fare to the house of Brother Pratt he had but one  cent left. Still he was the last man on earth to plead poverty, and  in answer to inquiries of some of the brethren as to his financial  circumstances, he replied that he had plenty of money.    This was reported to Brother Pratt, who the next day approached Elder  Taylor on the subject:    Elder Pratt: \"Brother Taylor, I hear you have plenty of money?\"    Elder Taylor: \"Yes, Brother Pratt, that's true.\"    Elder Pratt: \"Well, I am about to publish my 'Voice of Warning' and  'Millennial Poems,' I am very much in need of money, and if you could  furnish me two or three hundred dollars I should be very much obliged.\"    Elder Taylor: \"Well, Brother Parley, you are welcome to anything I  have, if it will be of service to you.\"    Elder Pratt: \"I never saw the time when means would be more acceptable.\"    Elder Taylor: \"Then you are welcome to all I have.\"    And putting his hand into his pocket Elder Taylor gave him his copper  cent. A laugh followed.    \"But I thought you gave it out that you had plenty of money,\" said  Parley.    \"Yes, and so I have,\" replied Elder Taylor. \"I am well clothed, you  furnish me plenty to eat and drink and good lodging; with all these  things and a penny over, as I owe nothing, is not that plenty?\"    That evening at a council meeting Elder Pratt proposed that the  brethren assist Elder Taylor with means to pay his passage to England  as Brother Woodruff was prepared and desired to go. To this Elder  Taylor objected and told the brethren if they had anything to give to  let Parley have it, as he had a family to support and needed means for  publishing. At the close of the meeting Elder Woodruff expressed his  regret at the course taken by Elder Taylor, as he had been waiting for  him, and at last had engaged his passage.    Elder Taylor: \"Well, Brother Woodruff, if you think it best for me to  go, I will accompany you.\"    Elder Woodruff: \"But where will you get the money?\"    Elder Taylor: \"Oh, there will be no difficulty about that. Go and take  a passage for me on your vessel, and I will furnish you the means.\"    A Brother Theodore Turley, hearing the above conversation, and thinking  that Elder Taylor had resources unknown to himself or Brother Woodruff,  said: \"I wish I could go with you, I would do your cooking and wait on  you.\"    The passage to be secured was in the steerage--these missionaries were  not going on flowery beds of ease--hence the necessity of such service  as Brother Turley proposed rendering. In answer to this appeal, Elder  Taylor told Brother Woodruff to take a passage for Brother Turley also.    At the time of making these arrangements Elder Taylor had no money, but  the Spirit had whispered him that means would be forthcoming, and when  had that still, small voice failed him! In that he trusted, and he did  not trust in vain. Although he did not ask for a penny of anyone, from  various persons in voluntary donations he received money enough to meet  his engagements for the passage of himself and Brother Turley, but no  more.    Elder Taylor and his two companions embarked on the 10th of December,  1839, and after a very prosperous voyage arrived in Liverpool, January  11th, 1840. Two days later they went to Preston, Lancashire.    In 1837, Apostles Heber C. Kimball and Orson Hyde and several other  Elders had opened the door of the gospel in England, and raised up  several branches of the Church, the principal one being in Preston.  Elder Willard Richards had been left in charge of the mission in  England, after the return of Elder Kimball in the spring of 1838; and  Elder Joseph Fielding, an old Canadian friend of Elder Taylor's,--at  whose instance he had written an account of the restoration of the  gospel to England some years before--presided over the branch at  Preston.    A council of the priesthood within reach was held at Preston, at which  it was decided that Elder Taylor should labor in Liverpool, with Elder  Fielding to assist him. After receiving this assignment the brethren at  once repaired to Liverpool and began their labors.    A few words here relative to the opening of this English mission. In  England, as in Canada, the servants of God found a people looking for  and prepared to receive the gospel. They believed the major part of  those things which the Elders of Israel had come into their midst to  proclaim, as the company of gentlemen did with whom Elder Taylor was  associated in Toronto. The people were in that peculiar frame of mind  that made them realize that great changes in systems were about to take  place. The Spirit of God was moving upon the righteous, and when they  heard the gospel they were ready to receive it.    Among those so situated was a Mr. Matthews, a brother-in-law to Elder  Joseph Fielding, and formerly a Church of England minister; but he  had resigned his position because he saw how far that church had  departed from the gospel of the New Testament; and how destitute it  was of the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost; and because it was not  making any preparations for the coming and reign of Christ on earth.  He had heard the gospel preached by Elders Richards and Goodson, in  Bedfordshire; he testified of its truth to his congregation; and went  so far as to appoint a time when he would be baptized with a number of  his followers. For some cause he failed to put in an appearance at the  appointed time, his mind became darkened and he opposed the Elders, but  adopted their principles and began preaching them on his own account.  In this way he raised up a number of congregations, one of which was  located in Liverpool.    Elder Taylor and his companion diligently searched these people out and  presented the gospel message to them. Some gladly received the word,  and others rejected it with great bitterness. Against some of this  latter class the brethren washed their feet as a witness against them.  [1] The manner in which they complied with this ordinance appointed  unto them is described by Elder Taylor as follows:    \"We washed our feet and then knelt before the Lord and bore testimony  of it, saying: 'O Lord, our Heavenly Father, we Thy servants have borne  testimony to the truth of those things which Thou hast revealed to Mr.  S--, and he has rejected our testimony. O, Father, Thou knowest we have  no hard feelings toward the man; if Thou canst forgive him and lead  him to the truth, do so, we pray Thee. O, Father, we do this that we  may fulfill Thy word, and bear testimony before Thee according to Thy  commandment; and now, O, Lord, we leave him in Thy hands, praying Thee  to guide us into all truth, in the name of Jesus. Amen.'\"    When the Sabbath came they attended services at a chapel in Hope  Street, where Mr. Matthews usually held forth. He was absent on this  occasion, but a young man, whom Elder Taylor describes as very devout,  preached. He lamented the state of the church, its pride, its vanity,  its lack of spiritual power; prayed for the blessings of the Holy Ghost  to be again made manifest, and for the coming of Christ's kingdom.    Such an opening as this was not neglected by Elder Taylor. At the close  of the meeting he arose and requested the privilege of speaking. He  was told, however, that he had better repair to the vestry and there  a hearing would be accorded him. He accepted the proposition. Some  sixteen or twenty class-leaders and elders were present who seemed  anxious to learn what sect the brethren were of. Setting aside that  matter, Elder Taylor thus addressed them:    \"Gentlemen, friends and brethren; I have listened with deep interest  to the things that I have heard this morning. I have observed with  peculiar emotions the deep anxiety, the fervent prayer and the strong  solicitude manifested by you in relation to obtaining the Holy Ghost.  I have been pleased with the correct views you entertain in regard to  the situation of the world. We believe in those things as you do. We  hear that you believe in baptism and the laying on of hands, so also do  we. Brethren and friends, we are the humble followers of Jesus Christ  and are from America. I lately arrived in this place, and have come  five thousand miles without purse or scrip, and I testify to you, my  brethren, that the Lord has revealed Himself from heaven and put us in  possession of these things you are so anxiously looking for and praying  that you may receive.\" (\"Glory be to God,\" was shouted by many present,  and great emotion manifested.)    \"That thing has taken place which is spoken of by John in the  Revelations, where he says: 'I saw another angel fly in the midst of  heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell  upon the earth, and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people,  saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour  of his judgment is come.' Brethren, we the servants of God are come to  this place to warn the inhabitants of their approaching danger, and to  call upon them to repent and be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4532"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone or the Picture That Saved a Fortune (#12)"],[1,"go for a little while, Tom,\" suggested  Ned. \"Come on over to Mr. Damon's. The trouble with you is that  you keep too long at a thing, once you start.\"    \"That's the only way to succeed,\" remarked Tom. \"Really, Ned,  while I feel sorry about the airship, of course, I ought to be  working on my telephone. I'll get the Eagle back sooner or later.\"    \"That's not the way to talk, Tom. Let's follow up this clue.\"    \"Well, if you insist on it I suppose I may as well go. We'll take  the little monoplane. I've fixed her up to carry double. I guess--\"    Tom Swift broke off suddenly, as the telephone at his elbow rang.    \"Hello,\" he said, taking off the receiver. \"Yes, this is Tom  Swift. Oh, good morning, Mrs. Damon! Eh! What's that? Mr. Damon  has disappeared? You don't tell me! Disappeared! Yes, yes, I can  come right over. Be there in a few minutes. Eh? You don't know  what to make of it? Oh, well, maybe it can easily be explained.  Yes, Ned Newton and I will be right over. Don't worry.\"    Tom hung up the receiver and turned to his chum.    \"What do you think of that?\" he asked.    \"What is it?\"    \"Why, Mr. Damon mysteriously vanished last night, and this morning  word came from his bankers that every cent of his fortune had  disappeared! He's lost everything!\"    \"Maybe--maybe--\" hesitated Ned.    \"No, Mr. Damon isn't that kind of a man,\" said Tom, stoutly. \"He  hasn't made away with himself.\"    \"But something is wrong!\"    \"Evidently, and it's up to us to find out what it is. I shouldn't  be surprised but that he knew of this coming trouble and started  out to prevent it if he could.\"    \"But he wouldn't disappear and make his wife worry.\"    \"No, that's so. Well, we'll have to go over there and find out all  about it.\"    \"Say, Tom!\" exclaimed Ned, as they were getting the small, but  swift monoplane ready for the flight, \"could there be any  connection with the disappearance of Mr. Damon and the taking of  the Eagle?\"    Tom started in surprise.    \"How could there be?\" he asked.    \"Oh, I don't know,\" answered Ned. \"It was only an idea.\"    \"Well, we'll see what Mrs. Damon has to say,\" spoke the young  inventor, as he took his seat beside Ned, and motioned to Koku to  twirl the propeller.            CHAPTER XIII    THE TELEPHONE PICTURE      \"Oh, Tom Swift! I'm so glad to see you!\"    Mrs. Damon clasped her arms, in motherly fashion, about the young  inventor. He held her close, and his own eyes were not free from  tears as he witnessed the grief of his best friend's wife.    \"Now, don't worry, Mrs. Damon,\" said Tom, sympathetically.  \"Everything will be all right,\" and he led her to a chair.    \"All right, Tom! How can it be?\" and the lady raised a tear-stained  face. \"My husband has disappeared, without a word! It's just as  if the earth had opened and swallowed him up! I can't find a trace  of him! How can it be all right?\"    \"Well, we'll find him, Mrs. Damon. Don't worry. Ned and I will get  right to work, and I'll have all the police and detectives within  fifty miles on the search--if we have to go that far.\"    \"Oh, it's awfully good of you, Tom. I--I didn't know who else to  turn to in my trouble but you.\"    \"And why shouldn't you come to me? I'd do anything for you and Mr.  Damon. Now tell me all about it.\"    Tom and Ned had just arrived at the Damon home in the airship, to  find the wife of the eccentric man almost distracted over her  husband's strange disappearance.    \"It happened last night,\" Mrs. Damon said, when she was somewhat  composed. \"Last night about twelve o'clock.\"    \"Twelve o'clock!\" cried Tom, in surprise \"Why that's about the  time--\"    He stopped suddenly.    \"What were you going to say?\" asked Mrs. Damon.    \"Oh--nothing,\" answered Tom. \"I--I'll tell you later. Go on,  please.\"    \"It is all so confusing,\" proceeded Mrs. Damon. \"You know my  husband has been in trouble of late--financial trouble?\"    \"Yes,\" responded Tom, \"he mentioned it to me.\"    \"I don't know any of the details,\" sighed Mrs. Damon, \"but I know  he was mixed up with a man named Peters.\"    \"I know him, too,\" spoke Tom, grimly.    \"My husband has been very gloomy of late,\" went on Mrs. Damon. \"He  foolishly entrusted almost his entire fortune to that man, and  last night he told me it was probably all gone. He said he saw  only the barest chance to save it, but that he was going to take  that chance.\"    \"Did he go into details?\" asked Tom.    \"No, that was all he said. That was about ten o'clock. He didn't  want to go to bed. He just sat about, and he kept saying over and  over again: 'Bless my tombstone!' 'Bless the cemetery!' and all  such stuff as that. You know how he was,\" and she smiled through  her tears.    \"Yes,\" said Tom. \"I know. Only it wasn't like him to bless such  grewsome things. He was more jolly.\"    \"He hasn't been, of late,\" sighed his wife. \"Well, he sat about  all the evening, and he kept figuring away, trying, I suppose, to  find some way out of his trouble.\"    \"Why didn't he come to my father?\" cried Tom. \"I told him he could  have all the money he needed to tide him over.\"    \"Well, Mr. Damon was queer that way,\" said his wife. \"He wanted to  be independent. I urged him to call you up, but he said he'd fight  it out alone.\"    \"As I said, we sat there, and he kept feeling more and more blue,  and blessing his funeral, and the hearse and all such things as  that. He kept looking at the clock, too, and I wondered at that.\"    \"'Are you expecting someone?' I asked him. He said he wasn't,  exactly, but I made sure he was, and finally, about half-past  eleven, he put on his hat and went out.\"    \"'Where are you going?' I asked him.\"    \"'Oh, just to get a breath of air. I can't sleep,' he said. I  didn't think much of that, as he often used to go out and walk  about a bit before going to bed. So he went out, and I began to  see about locking up, for I never trust the servants.\"    \"It must have been about an hour later when I heard voices out in  front. I looked, and I saw Mr. Damon talking to a man.\"    \"Who was he?\" asked Tom, eagerly, on the alert for the slightest  clue.    \"I thought at the time,\" said Mrs. Damon, \"that it was one of the  neighbors. I have learned since, however, that it was not. Anyhow,  this man and Mr. Damon stood talking for a little while, and then  they went off together. I didn't think it strange at the time,  supposing he was merely strolling up and down in front with Mr.  Blackson, who lives next door, He often had done that before.\"    \"Well, I saw that the house was locked up, and then I sat down in  a chair to wait for Mr. Damon to come back. I was getting sleepy,  for we don't usually stay up so late. I suppose I must have dozed  off, but I was suddenly awakened by hearing a peculiar noise. I  sat up in alarm, and then I realized that Mr. Damon had not come  in.\"    \"I was frightened then, and I called my maid. It was nearly one  o'clock, and my husband never stays out as late as that. We went  next door, and found that Mr. Blackson had not been out of his  house that evening. So it could not have been he to whom Mr. Damon  was speaking.\"    \"We roused up other neighbors, and they searched all about the  grounds, thinking he might have been overcome by a sudden faint.  But we could not find him. My husband had disappeared--mysteriously  disappeared!\" and the lady broke into sobs.    \"Now don't worry,\" said Tom, soothingly, as he put his arms about  her as he would have done to his own mother, had she been alive,  \"We'll get him back!\"    \"But how can you? No one knows where he is.\"    \"Oh, yes!\" said Tom, confidently, \"Mr. Damon himself knows where  he is, and unless he has gone away voluntarily, I think you will  soon hear from him.\"    \"What do you mean by--voluntarily?\" asked the wife.    \"First let me ask you a question,\" came from Tom. \"You said you  were awakened by a peculiar noise. What sort of a sound was it?\"    \"Why, a whirring, throbbing noise, like--like--\"    She paused for a comparison.    \"Like an airship?\" asked Tom, with a good deal of eagerness.    \"That was it!\" cried Mrs. Damon. \"I was trying to think where I  had heard the sound before. It was just like the noise your  airship makes, Tom!\"    \"That settles it!\" exclaimed the young inventor.    \"Settles what?\" asked Ned.    \"The manner of Mr. Damon's disappearance. He was taken away--or  went away--in my airship--the airship that was stolen from my shed  last night!\"    Mrs. Damon stared at Tom in amazement.    \"Why--why--how could that be?\" she asked.    Quickly Tom told of what had happened at his place.    \"I begin to see through it,\" he said. \"There is some plot here,  and we've got to get to the bottom of it. Mr. Damon either went  with these men in the airship willingly, or he was taken away by  force. I'm inclined to think he went of his own accord, or you  would have heard some outcry, Mrs. Damon.\"    \"Well, perhaps so,\" she admitted. \"But would he go away in that  manner without telling me?\"    \"He might,\" said Tom, willing to test his theory on all sides. \"He  might not have wanted you to worry, for you know you dislike him  to go up an airships.\"    \"Yes, I do. Oh, if I only thought he did go away of his own  accord, I could understand it. He went, if he did, to try and save  his fortune.\"    \"It does look as though he had an appointment with someone, Tom,\"  suggested Ned. \"His looking at the clock, and then going out, and all  that.\"    \"Yes,\" admitted the young inventor, \"and now I'm inclined to  change my theory a bit. It may have been some other airship than  mine that was used.\"    \"How so?\" asked Ned.    \"Because the men who took mine were unprincipled fellows. Mr.  Damon would not have gone away with men who would steal an  airship.\"    \"Not if he knew it,\" admitted Ned. \"Well, then, let's consider two  airships--yours and the other that came to keep the appointment  with Mr. Damon. If the last is true, why should he want to go away  in an"]]]
