Let our letters  suffice and do not address yourself to others, for, by heaven, I  will not give a finger's length of accounting concerning my  doings or omissions to others, not even to the Emperor himself. I  have cares and anxieties of my own and have no use for petulant  letters.\"    (Vienna, September 5, 1781, to his father, who lent a willing ear  to gossips and was never chary of his reproaches. Mozart was  already twenty-five years old.)    145. \"If I were Wiedmer I would demand the following satisfaction  from the Emperor: he should endure 50 strokes at the same place  in my presence and then he should pay me 6,000 ducats. If I could  not obtain this satisfaction I should take none, but thrust a  dagger through his heart at the first opportunity. N.B. He has  already had an offer of 3,000 ducats on condition that he does  not come to Vienna, but permits the matter to drop. The people of  Innsbruck say of Wiedmer: he who was scourged for our sake will  also redeem us.\"    (Vienna, August 8, 1781, to his father. Herr von Wiedmer was a  nobleman and theatre director, who, without cause, had been  sentenced to a whipping by the president, Count Wolkenstein, on  the complaint of another nobleman. [Mozart's bloodthirstiness was  probably due to memories of Arco's kick still rankling in his  heart. It was only after long solicitation from his father that  he abandoned his plan to send Arco the threatened letter.  H.E.K.])    146. \"You perhaps already know that the musico Marquesi--  Marquesius di Milano--was poisoned in Naples; but how! He was  in love with a duchess and her real amant grew jealous and sent  three or four bravos to Marquesi and left him the choice of  drinking poison or being massacred. He chose the poison. Being a  timid Italian he died alone and left his gentlemen murderers to  live in rest and peace. Had they come into my room, I would have  taken a few of them with me into the other world, as long as some  one had to die. Pity for so excellent a singer!\"    (Munich, December 30, 1780, to his father. Mozart, on the whole,  was one of the most peaceable men on earth, but he was not  wanting in personal courage, and he could fly into transports of  rage.)    147. \"If you were to write also to Prince Zeil I should be glad.  But short and good. Do not by any means crawl! That I can not  endure.\"    (Mannheim, December 10, 1777, to his father. Count Ferdinand von  Zeil was Prince Bishop of Chimsee and favorably disposed towards  Mozart, who was hoping for an appointment in Munich. \"If he wants  to do something he can; all Munich told me that.\" Nothing came of  it.)    148. \"Whoever judges me by such bagatelles is also a scamp!\"    (Mozart wrote many occasional pieces for his friends,--fitting  them to the players' capacities. Mozart said that the publisher  who bought some of these \"bagatelles\" and printed them without  applying to him was a scamp (Lump), but took no proceedings  against him.)    149. \"Very well; then I shall earn nothing more, go hungry and  the devil a bit will I care!\"    (Mozart's answer to Hofmeister, the Leipsic publisher, who had  said: \"Write in a more popular style or I can neither print nor  pay for anything of yours.\")        STRIVINGS AND LABORS        150. \"We live in this world only that we may go onward without  ceasing, a peculiar help in this direction being that one  enlightens the other by communicating his ideas; in the sciences  and fine arts there is always more to learn.\"    (Salzburg, September 7, 1776, to Padre Martini of Bologna, whose  opinion he asks concerning a motet which the Archbishop of  Salzburg had faulted.)    151. \"I am just now reading 'Telemachus;' I am in the second  part.\"    (Bologna, September 8, 1770, to his mother and sister.)    152. \"Because you said yesterday that you could understand  anything, and that I might write what I please in Latin,  curiosity has led me to try you with some Latin lines. Have the  kindness when you have solved the problem to send the result to  me by the Hagenauer servant maid.\"    \"Cuperem scire, de qua causa, a quam plurimis adolescentibus  ottium usque adeo aestimetur, ut ipsi se nec verbis, nec  verberibus ab hoc sinant abduci.\"    (The Archiepiscopal concertmaster, aged 13, writes thus to a girl  friend.)    153. \"Since then I have exercised myself daily in the French  language, and already taken three lessons in English. In three  months I hope to be able to read and understand the English books  fairly well.\"    (Vienna, August 17, 1782, to his father. Mozart had given it out  that he intended to go to Paris or London. Prince Kaunitz had  said to Archduke Maximilian that men like Mozart lived but once  in a hundred years, and should not be driven out of Germany.  Mozart, however, writes to his father: \"But I do not want to wait  on charity; I find that, even if it were the Emperor, I am not  dependent on his bounty.\")    154. \"I place my confidence in three friends, and they are strong  and invincible friends, viz: God, your head and my head. True our  heads differ, but each is very good, serviceable, and useful in  its genre, and in time I hope that my head will be as good as  yours in the field in which now yours is superior.\"    (Mannheim, February 28, 1778, to his father.)    155. \"Believe me, I do not love idleness, but work. True it was  difficult in Salzburg and cost me an effort and I could scarcely  persuade myself. Why? Because I was not happy there. You must  admit that, for me at least, there was not a pennyworth of  entertainment in Salzburg. I do not want to associate with many  and of the majority of the rest I am not fond. There is no  encouragement for my talent! If I play, or one of my compositions  is performed, the audience might as well consist of tables and  chairs....In Salzburg I sigh for a hundred amusements, and here  for not one; to live in Vienna is amusement enough.\"    (Vienna, May 26, 1781, to his father, who was concerned as to the  progress making in Vienna.)    156. \"I beg of you, best and dearest of fathers, do not write me  any more letters of this kind,--I conjure you, for they serve no  other purpose than to heat my head and disturb my heart and mood.  And I, who must compose continually, need a clear head and quiet  mood.\"    (Vienna, June 9, 1781, to his father, who had reproached him  because of his rupture with the Archbishop.)    157. \"If there ever was a time when I was not thinking about  marriage it is now. I wish for nothing less than a rich wife, and  if I could make my fortune by marriage now I should perforce have  to wait, because I have very different things in my head. God did  not give me my talent to put it a-dangle on a wife, and spend my  young life in inactivity. I am just beginning life, and shall I  embitter it myself? I have nothing against matrimony, but for me  it would be an evil just now.\"    (Vienna, July 25, 1781, to his father, who was solicitous lest he  fall in love with one of the daughters in the Weber family with  whom he was living. All manner of rumors had been carried to him.  The father persuaded his son to seek other lodgings; but  Constanze Weber eventually became Mozart's wife nevertheless.)    158. \"This sort of composer can do nothing in this genre. He has  no conception of what is wanted. Lord! if God had only given me  such a place in the church and before such an orchestra!\"    (A remark made in Leipsic, in 1789, in reference to a composer  who was suited to comic opera work, but had received an  appointment as Church composer. Mozart examined a mass of his and  said: \"It sounds all very well, but not in church.\" He then  played it through with new words improvised by himself, such as  (in the Cum sancto spiritu) \"Stolen property, gentlemen, but no  offence.\")    159. \"You see my intentions are good; but if you can't, you  can't! I do not want to scribble, and therefore can not send you  the whole symphony before next post day.\"    (Vienna, July 31, 1782, to his father, who had asked for a  symphony for the Hafner family in Salzburg.)    160. \"I do not beg pardon; no! But I beg of Herr Bullinger that  he himself apply to himself for pardon in my behalf, with the  assurance that as soon as I can do so in quiet I shall write to  him. Until now no such occasion has offered itself, for as soon  as I know that in all likelihood I must leave a place I have no  restful hour. And although I still have a modicum of hope, I am  not at ease and shall not be until I know my status.\"    (Mannheim, November 22, 1777, to his father. Abbe Bullinger was  the most intimate friend that the Mozart family had in Salzburg.  Mozart had been negligent in his correspondence.)    161. \"To live well and to live happily are different things, and  the latter would be impossible for me without witchcraft; it  would have to be supernatural; and that is impossible for there  are no witches now-a-days.\"    (Paris, August 7, 1778, to his friend Bullinger, who had sought  to persuade him to return to Salzburg.)    162. \"The Duke de Chabot sat himself down beside me and listened  attentively; and I--I forgot the cold, and the headache and  played regardless of the wretched clavier as I play when I am in  the mood. Give me the best clavier in Europe and at the same time  hearers who understand nothing or want to understand nothing, and  who do not feel what I play with me, and all my joy is gone.\"    (Paris, May 1, 1778, to his father. The Duchess had behaved very  haughtily and kept Mozart sitting in a cold room for a long time  before the Duke came.)

[70] The life of Luca, a life of labour and frugality, with no  adventure and no excitement except what belongs to the trial of  new artistic processes, the struggle with new artistic difficulties,  the solution of purely artistic problems, fills the first seventy  years of the fifteenth century.  After producing many works in  marble for the Duomo and the Campanile of Florence, which  place him among the foremost masters of the sculpture of his age,  he became desirous to realise the spirit and manner of that  sculpture, in a humbler material, to unite its science, its exquisite  and expressive system of low relief, to the homely art of pottery,  to introduce those high qualities into common things, to adorn  and cultivate daily household life.  In this he is profoundly  characteristic of the Florence of that century, of that in it which  lay below its superficial vanity and caprice, a certain old-world  modesty and seriousness and simplicity.  People had not yet  begun to think that what was good art for churches was not so  good, or less fitted, for their own houses.  Luca's new work was  in plain white earthenware at first, a mere rough  imitation of the costly, laboriously wrought marble, finished in a  few hours.  But on this humble path he found his way to a fresh  success, to another artistic grace.  The fame of the oriental  pottery, with its strange, bright colours--colours of art, colours  not to be attained in the natural stone--mingled with the tradition  of the old Roman [71] pottery of the neighbourhood.  The little  red, coral-like jars of Arezzo, dug up in that district from time to  time, are much prized.  These colours haunted Luca's fancy.  \"He  still continued seeking something more,\" his biographer says of  him; \"and instead of making his figures of baked earth simply  white, he added the further invention of giving them colour, to  the astonishment and delight of all who beheld them\"--Cosa  singolare, e multo utile per la state!--a curious thing, and very  useful for summer-time, full of coolness and repose for hand and  eye.  Luca loved the form of various fruits, and wrought them  into all sorts of marvellous frames and garlands, giving them  their natural colours, only subdued a little, a little paler than  nature.    I said that the art of Luca della Robbia possessed in an unusual  measure that special characteristic which belongs to all the work-  men of his school, a characteristic which, even in the absence of  much positive information about their actual history, seems to  bring those work-men themselves very near to us.  They bear the  impress of a personal quality, a profound+ expressiveness, what  the French call intimité, by which is meant some subtler sense of  originality--the seal on a man's work of what is most inward and  peculiar in his moods, and manner of apprehension: it is what we  call expression, carried to its highest intensity of degree.  That  characteristic is rare in poetry, rarer still [72] in art, rarest of all in  the abstract art of sculpture; yet essentially, perhaps, it is the  quality which alone makes work in the imaginative order really  worth having at all.  It is because the works of the artists of the  fifteenth century possess this quality in an unmistakable way that  one is anxious to know all that can be known about them and  explain to one's self the secret of their charm.    1872.      NOTES    71. +The Macmillan edition's misprint \"profund\" is here  corrected to \"profound,\" the spelling of the 1901 edition.        THE POETRY OF MICHELANGELO    [73] CRITICS of Michelangelo have sometimes spoken as if the  only characteristic of his genius were a wonderful strength,  verging, as in the things of the imagination great strength always  does, on what is singular or strange.  A certain strangeness,  something of the blossoming of the aloe, is indeed an element in  all true works of art: that they shall excite or surprise us is  indispensable.  But that they shall give pleasure and exert a  charm over us is indispensable too; and this strangeness must be  sweet also--a lovely strangeness.  And to the true admirers of  Michelangelo this is the true type of the Michelangelesque--  sweetness and strength, pleasure with surprise, an energy of  conception which seems at every moment about to break through  all the conditions of comely form, recovering, touch by touch, a  loveliness found usually only in the simplest natural things--ex  forti dulcedo.    In this way he sums up for them the whole character of medieval  art itself in that which distinguishes it most clearly from classical  work, the presence of a convulsive energy in it, becoming [74]  in lower hands merely monstrous or forbidding, and felt, even in  its most graceful products, as a subdued quaintness or grotesque.  Yet those who feel this grace or sweetness in Michelangelo might  at the first moment be puzzled if they were asked wherein  precisely such quality resided.  Men of inventive temperament--  Victor Hugo, for instance, in whom, as in Michelangelo, people  have for the most part been attracted or repelled by the strength,  while few have understood his sweetness--have sometimes  relieved conceptions of merely moral or spiritual greatness, but  with little aesthetic charm of their own, by lovely accidents or  accessories, like the butterfly which alights on the blood-stained  barricade in Les Misérables, or those sea-birds for whom the  monstrous Gilliatt comes to be as some wild natural thing, so that  they are no longer afraid of him, in Les Travailleurs de la Mer.  But the austere genius of Michelangelo will not depend for its  sweetness on any mere accessories like these.  The world of  natural things has almost no existence for him; \"When one speaks  of him,\" says Grimm, \"woods, clouds, seas, and mountains  disappear, and only what is formed by the spirit of man remains  behind\"; and he quotes a few slight words from a letter of his to  Vasari as the single expression in all he has left of a feeling for  nature.  He has traced no flowers, like those with which Leonardo  stars [75] over his gloomiest rocks; nothing like the fret-work of  wings and flames in which Blake frames his most startling  conceptions.  No forest-scenery like Titian's fills his  backgrounds, but only blank ranges of rock, and dim vegetable  forms as blank as they, as in a world before the creation of the  first five days.    Of the whole story of the creation he has painted only the  creation of the first man and woman, and, for him at least, feebly,  the creation of light.  It belongs to the quality of his genius thus  to concern itself almost exclusively with the making of man.  For  him it is not, as in the story itself, the last and crowning act of a  series of developments, but the first and unique act, the creation  of life itself in its supreme form, off-hand and immediately, in the  cold and lifeless stone.  With him the beginning of life has all the  characteristics of resurrection; it is like the recovery of suspended  health or animation, with its gratitude, its effusion, and  eloquence.  Fair as the young men of the Elgin marbles, the  Adam of the Sistine Chapel is unlike them in a total absence of  that balance and completeness which express so well the  sentiment of a self-contained, independent life.  In that languid  figure there is something rude and satyr-like, something akin to  the rugged hillside on which it lies.  His whole form is gathered  into an expression of mere expectancy and reception; he has  hardly strength enough to lift his finger [76] to touch the finger of  the creator; yet a touch of the finger-tips will suffice.    This creation of life--life coming always as relief or recovery,  and always in strong contrast with the rough-hewn mass in which  it is kindled--is in various ways the motive of all his work,  whether its immediate subject be Pagan or Christian, legend or  allegory; and this, although at least one-half of his work was  designed for the adornment of tombs--the tomb of Julius, the  tombs of the Medici.  Not the Judgment but the Resurrection is  the real subject of his last work in the Sistine Chapel; and his  favourite Pagan subject is the legend of Leda, the delight of the  world breaking from the egg of a bird.  As I have already pointed  out, he secures that ideality of expression which in Greek  sculpture depends on a delicate system of abstraction, and in  early Italian sculpture on lowness of relief, by an incompleteness,  which is surely not always undesigned, and which, as I think, no  one regrets, and trusts to the spectator to complete the half-  emergent form.  And as his persons have something of the  unwrought stone about them, so, as if to realise the expression by  which the old Florentine records describe a sculptor--master of  live stone--with him the very rocks seem to have life.  They have  but to cast away the dust and scurf that they may rise and stand  on their feet.  He loved the very quarries of Carrara, those strange  grey peaks which even at mid-day [77] convey into any scene  from which they are visible something of the solemnity and  stillness of evening, sometimes wandering among them month  after month, till at last their pale ashen colours seem to have  passed into his painting; and on the crown of the head of the  David there still remains a morsel of uncut stone, as if by one  touch to maintain its connexion with the place from which it was  hewn.    And it is in this penetrative suggestion of life that the secret of  that sweetness of his is to be found.  He gives us indeed no lovely  natural objects like Leonardo or Titian, but only the coldest, most  elementary shadowing of rock or tree; no lovely draperies and  comely gestures of life, but only the austere truths of human  nature; \"simple persons\"--as he replied in his rough way to the  querulous criticism of Julius the Second, that there"]]]
