Estos son los que dan fama:             This is the kind that wins fame today:  mientras le soplo la dama,              while I snatch his lady away,  él se arrancará los pelos               he'll be tearing out his hair  encerrado en mi bodega.                 imprisoned in my wine cellar.  ¿Y ella...?

A la cárcel le llevé                    I got him jailed  y salió: llevóme a mí                   and he was bailed: he trapped me  y salí; hallarnos aquí                  and I was bailed;  it was destiny  era fuerza..., ya se ve,                that we'd meet here, neither failed  su parte en la grave apuesta:           to defend his name  defendía cada cual.                     in this serious jest.

Mas por allí un bulto negro             But a dark shadow appears,  se aproxima..., y a mi ver              and in my opinion  es el bulto una mujer.                  the shape is that of a woman.  ¿Otra aventura? Me alegro.              Another adventure? I'm cheered.

Do I look like the devil to you?    DON JUAN: Créolo.                       I think so.    BRÍGIDA: ¡Vaya! ¡Qué cosas tenéis!      Ah, how you speak to me!  Vos sí que sois un diablillo...

BRÍGIDA: Lo veréis.                     You'll see.    DON JUAN:  Descarga, pues, ese pecho.              Unburden yourself then.  ¿Qué hiciste?                           What did you do?    BRÍGIDA: Cuanto me ha dicho             All that your servant told me to.  vuestro paje... ¡Y qué mal bicho        And what a scamp he is, it's true,  es ese Ciutti!                          that Ciutti.    DON JUAN: ¿Qué ha hecho?                What did he do?    BRÍGIDA: ¡Gran bribón!                  He's a great rascal.    DON JUAN: ¿No os ha entregado           Didn't he turn over to you  un bolsillo y un papel?                 a purse and a letter?    BRÍGIDA:  Leyendo estará ahora en él              Doña Inés is getting better  doña Inés.                              acquainted with it right now.    DON JUAN: ¿La has preparado?            Have you prepared her?    BRÍGIDA:  Vaya; y os la he convencido             I have convinced her  con tal maña y de manera                in such a clever way  que irá como una cordera                she'll follow you, any day,  tras vos.                               like a little lamb.    DON JUAN: ¡Tan fácil te ha sido!        Was it that easy for you?    BRÍGIDA:  ¡Bah! Pobre garza enjaulada,            Bah. Poor little bird in a cage  dentro la jaula nacida,                 to be born here and to die,  ¿qué sabe ella si hay más vida          what does she know, at her age,  ni más aire en que volar?               of another life, free, in which to fly?  Si no vio nunca sus plumas              If she's never seen her feathers  del sol a los resplandores,             shine in the sun, poor thing,  ¿qué sabe de los colores                what does she know of the colours  de que se puede ufanar?                 of which her heart might sing?  No cuenta la pobrecilla                 The poor little child is  diez y siete primaveras                 a bare seventeen  y, aún virgen a las primeras            and wholly a virgin  impresiones del amor,                   to love's first idea,  nunca concibió la dicha                 she's never conceived of pleasure,  fuera de su pobre estancia              outside her poor dwelling's measure,  tratada desde su infancia               treated from infancy like a treasure,  con cauteloso rigor.                    with careful strictness, poor dear.  Y tantos años monótonos                 And so many monotonous years  de soledad y convento                   of convent solitude  tenían su pensamiento                   have kept her thoughts subdued,  ceñido a punto tan ruin,                imprisoned in such a ruinous way,  a tan reducido espacio                  captive to such a degree,  y a círculo tan mezquino,               and in such wretched society,  que era el claustro su destino          that the cloister was her destiny,  el altar era su fin.                    devotion was her fate.  \"Aquí está Dios\", la dijeron;           \"God is here,\" they told her;  y ella dijo: \"Aquí le adoro\".           And she said: \"Here I'll adore\"  \"Aquí está el claustro y el coro.\"      Here is the cloister and choir.  Y pensó: \"No hay más allá\".             And thought \"Beyond, there is                                          nothing more.\"  Y sin otras ilusiones                   And without any illusions  que sus sueños infantiles,              more than her childish dreams,  pasó diez y siete abriles               she spent seventeen years growing  sin conocerlo quizá.                    here, almost without knowing.    DON JUAN: ¿Y está hermosa?              And is she beautiful?    BRÍGIDA: ¡Oh! Como un ángel.            Oh, as an angel.    DON JUAN: ¿Y la has dicho...?           And you have unfurled...?    BRÍGIDA: Figuraos                       You may well guess  si habré metido mal caos                how I have stirred wicked chaos  en su cabeza, don Juan.                 inside her head, Don Juan.  La hablé del amor, del mundo,           I spoke to her of love, of the world  de la corte y los placeres,             of pleasures, the court, how gallant  de cuánto con las mujeres               you are, how prodigious a talent  erais pródigo y galán.                  you possess with women.  La dije que erais el hombre             I told her you were the man  por su padre destinado                  chosen for her by her father,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5210"],[0,"The Borough (#12)"],[1,"body no concern have they,  All their inquiry, \"Can the patient pay?  \"And will he swallow draughts until his dying day?\"     Observe what ills to nervous females flow,  When the heart flutters, and the pulse is low;  If once induced these cordial sips to try,  All feel the ease, and few the danger fly;  For, while obtain'd, of drams they've all the force,  And when denied, then drams are the resource.     Nor these the only evils--there are those  Who for the troubled mind prepare repose;  They write:  the young are tenderly address'd,  Much danger hinted, much concern express'd;  They dwell on freedoms lads are prone to take,  Which makes the doctor tremble for their sake;  Still if the youthful patient will but trust  In one so kind, so pitiful, and just;  If he will take the tonic all the time,  And hold but moderate intercourse with crime;  The sage will gravely give his honest word,  That strength and spirits shall be both restored;  In plainer English--if you mean to sin,  Fly to the drops, and instantly begin.     Who would not lend a sympathizing sigh,  To hear yon infant's pity-moving cry?  That feeble sob, unlike the new-born note  Which came with vigour from the op'ning throat,  When air and light first rush'd on lungs and eyes,  And there was life and spirit in the cries;  Now an abortive, faint attempt to weep  Is all we hear; sensation is asleep:  The boy was healthy, and at first express'd  His feelings loudly when he fail'd to rest;  When cramm'd with food, and tighten'd every limb,  To cry aloud was what pertain'd to him;  Then the good nurse (who, had she borne a brain,  Had sought the cause that made her babe complain)  Has all her efforts, loving soul! applied  To set the cry, and not the cause, aside;  She gave her powerful sweet without remorse  The sleeping cordial--she had tried its force,  Repeating oft:  the infant, freed from pain,  Rejected food, but took the dose again,  Sinking to sleep; while she her joy express'd,  That her dear charge could sweetly take his rest:  Soon may she spare her cordial; not a doubt  Remains, but quickly he will resfc without.     This moves our grief and pity, and we sigh  To think what numbers from these causes die;  But what contempt and anger should we show,  Did we the lives of these impostors know!     Ere for the world's I left the cares of school,  One I remember who assumed the fool;  A part well suited--when the idler boys  Would shout around him, and he loved the noise;  They called him Neddy;--Neddy had the art  To play with skill his ignominious part;  When he his trifles would for sale display,  And act the mimic for a schoolboy's pay.  For many years he plied his humble trade,  And used his tricks and talents to persuade;  The fellow barely read, but chanced to look  Among the fragments of a tatter'd book;  Where, after many efforts made to spell  One puzzling word, he found it--oxymel;  A potent thing, 'twas said to cure the ills  Of ailing lungs--the oxymel of squills:  Squills he procured, but found the bitter strong  And most unpleasant; none would take it long;  But the pure acid and the sweet would make  A med'cine numbers would for pleasure take.  There was a fellow near, an artful knave,  Who knew the plan, and much assistance gave;  He wrote the puffs, and every talent plied  To make it sell:  it sold, and then he died.     Now all the profit fell to Ned's control,  And Pride and Avarice quarrell'd for his soul;  When mighty profits by the trash were made,  Pride built a palace, Avarice groan'd and paid;  Pride placed the signs of grandeur all about,  And Avarice barr'd his friends and children out.     Now see him Doctor! yes, the idle fool,  The butt, the robber of the lads at school;  Who then knew nothing, nothing since acquired,  Became a doctor, honour'd and admired;  His dress, his frown, his dignity were such,  Some who had known him thought his knowledge much;  Nay, men of skill, of apprehension quick,  Spite of their knowledge, trusted him when sick;  Though he could neither reason, write, nor spell,  They yet had hope his trash would make them well;  And while they scorn'd his parts, they took his oxymel.     Oh! when his nerves had once received a shock,  Sir Isaac Newton might have gone to Rock:  Hence impositions of the grossest kind,  Hence thought is feeble, understanding blind;  Hence sums enormous by those cheats are made,  And deaths unnumber'd by their dreadful trade.     Alas! in vain is my contempt express'd,  To stronger passions are their words address'd;  To pain, to fear, to terror, their appeal,  To those who, weakly reasoning, strongly feel.     What then our hopes?--perhaps there may by law  Be method found these pests to curb and awe;  Yet in this land of freedom law is slack  With any being to commence attack;  Then let us trust to science--there are those  Who can their falsehoods and their frauds disclose,  All their vile trash detect, and their low tricks expose;  Perhaps their numbers may in time confound  Their arts--as scorpions give themselves the wound;  For when these curers dwell in every place,  While of the cured we not a man can trace,  Strong truth may then the public mind persuade,  And spoil the fruits of this nefarious trade.

HORACE, Satires.             ----------------------    TRADES.    No extensive manufactories in the Borough; yet considerable Fortunes  made there--Ill Judgment of Parents in disposing of their Sons--The  best educated not the most likely to succeed--Instance--Want of  Success compensated by the lenient Power of some Avocations--The  Naturalist--The Weaver an Entomologist, &c.--A Prize Flower--Story  of Walter and William.    OF manufactures, trade, inventions rare,  Steam-towers and looms, you'd know our Borough's share -  'Tis small:  we boast not these rich subjects here,  Who hazard thrice ten thousand pounds a-year;  We've no huge buildings, where incessant noise  Is made by springs and spindles, girls and boys;  Where, 'mid such thundering sounds, the maiden's song  Is \"Harmony in Uproar\" all day long.     Still common minds with us in common trade,  Have gain'd more wealth than ever student made;  And yet a merchant, when he gives his son  His college-learning, thinks his duty done;  A way to wealth he leaves his boy to find,  Just when he's made for the discovery blind.     Jones and his wife perceived their elder boy  Took to his learning, and it gave them joy;  This they encouraged, and were bless'd to see  Their son a fellow with a high degree;  A living fell, he married, and his sire  Declared 'twas all a father could require;  Children then bless'd them, and when letters came,  The parents proudly told each grandchild's name.     Meantime the sons at home in trade were placed,  Money their object--just the father's taste;  Saving he lived and long, and when he died,  He gave them all his fortune to divide:  \"Martin,\" said he, \"at vast expense was taught;  He gain'd his wish, and has the ease he sought.\"     Thus the good priest (the Christian scholar!) finds  \"What estimate is made by vulgar minds;  He sees his brothers, who had every gift  Of thriving, now assisted in their thrift;  While he, whom learning, habits, all prevent,  Is largely mulct for each impediment.     Yet let us own that Trade has much of chance,  Not all the careful by their care advance;  With the same parts and prospects, one a seat  Builds for himself; one finds it in the Fleet.  Then to the wealthy you will see denied  Comforts and joys that with the poor abide:  There are who labour through the year, and yet  No more have gain'd than--not to be in debt:  Who still maintain the same laborious course,  Yet pleasure hails them from some favourite source,  And health, amusements, children, wife, or friend,  With life's dull views their consolations blend.     Nor these alone possess the lenient power  Of soothing life in the desponding hour;  Some favourite studies, some delightful care,  The mind with trouble and distresses share;  And by a coin, a flower, a verse, a boat,  The stagnant spirits have been set afloat;  They pleased at first, and then the habit grew,  Till the fond heart no higher pleasure knew;  Till, from all cares and other comforts freed,  Th' important nothing took in life the lead.     With all his phlegm, it broke a Dutchman's heart,  At a vast price, with one loved root to part;  And toys like these fill many a British mind,  Although their hearts are found of firmer kind.     Oft have I smiled the happy pride to see  Of humble tradesmen, in their evening glee;  When of some pleasing fancied good possess'd,  Each grew alert, was busy, and was bless'd:  Whether the call-bird yield the hour's delight,  Or, magnified in microscope the mite;  Or whether tumblers, croppers, carriers seize  The gentle mind, they rule it and they please.     There is my friend the Weaver:  strong desires  Reign in his breast; 'tis beauty he admires:  See! to the shady grove he wings his way,  And feels in hope the raptures of the day -  Eager he looks:  and soon, to glad his eyes,  From the sweet bower, by nature form'd, arise  Bright troops of virgin moths and fresh-born butterflies;  Who broke that morning from their half-year's sleep,  To fly o'er flowers where they were wont to creep.     Above the sovereign oak, a sovereign skims,  The purple Emp'ror, strong in wing and limbs:  There fair Camilla takes her flight serene,"]]]
