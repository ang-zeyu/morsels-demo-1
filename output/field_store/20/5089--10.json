'Sure he's the friend of the poor,' said one fellow, 'and good luck to  him!'    'Was it any business of ours?' asked another. And another told,  grinning, that it was the famous Captain Freny, who, having bribed the  jury to acquit him two days back at Kilkenny assizes, had mounted his  horse at the gaol door, and the very next day had robbed two barristers  who were going the circuit.    I told this pack of rascals to be off to their work, or they should  taste of my thong, and proceeded, as well as I could, to comfort Mrs.  Fitzsimons under her misfortunes. 'Had she lost much?' 'Everything: her  purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas; her jewels, snuff-boxes,  watches, and a pair of diamond shoe-buckles of the Captain's.' These  mishaps I sincerely commiserated; and knowing her by her accent to be  an Englishwoman, deplored the difference that existed between the  two countries, and said that in OUR country (meaning England) such  atrocities were unknown.    'You, too, are an Englishman?' said she, with rather a tone of surprise.  On which I said I was proud to be such: as, in fact, I was; and I never  knew a true Tory gentleman of Ireland who did not wish he could say as  much.    I rode by Mrs. Fitzsimon's chair all the way to Naas; and, as she had  been robbed of her purse, asked permission to lend her a couple of  pieces to pay her expenses at the inn: which sum she was graciously  pleased to accept, and was, at the same time, kind enough to invite  me to share her dinner. To the lady's questions regarding my birth and  parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune (this  was not true; but what is the use of crying bad fish? my dear mother  instructed me early in this sort of prudence) and good family in the  county of Waterford; that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that  my mother allowed me five hundred per annum. Mrs. Fitzsimons was equally  communicative. She was the daughter of General Granby Somerset of  Worcestershire, of whom, of course, I had heard (and though I had not,  of course I was too well-bred to say so); and had made, as she must  confess, a runaway match with Ensign Fitzgerald Fitzsimons. Had I been  in Donegal?--No! That was a pity. The Captain's father possesses a  hundred thousand acres there, and Fitzsimonsburgh Castle's the finest  mansion in Ireland. Captain Fitzsimons is the eldest son; and, though he  has quarrelled with his father, must inherit the vast property. She went  on to tell me about the balls at Dublin, the banquets at the Castle, the  horse-races at the Phoenix, the ridottos and routs, until I became quite  eager to join in those pleasures; and I only felt grieved to think that  my position would render secrecy necessary, and prevent me from being  presented at the Court, of which the Fitzsimonses were the most elegant  ornaments. How different was her lively rattle to that of the vulgar  wenches at the Kilwangan assemblies! In every sentence she mentioned a  lord or a person of quality. She evidently spoke French and Italian, of  the former of which languages I have said I knew a few words; and, as  for her English accent, why, perhaps I was no judge of that, for, to  say the truth, she was the first REAL English person I had ever met. She  recommended me, further, to be very cautious with regard to the company  I should meet at Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries  abounded; and my delight and gratitude to her may be imagined, when, as  our conversation grew more intimate (as we sat over our dessert), she  kindly offered to accommodate me with lodgings in her own house, where  her Fitzsimons, she said, would welcome with delight her gallant young  preserver.    'Indeed, madam,' said I, 'I have preserved nothing for you.' Which was  perfectly true; for had I not come up too late after the robbery to  prevent the highwayman from carrying off her money and pearls?    'And sure, ma'am, them wasn't much,' said Sullivan, the blundering  servant, who had been so frightened at Freny's approach, and was waiting  on us at dinner. 'Didn't he return you the thirteenpence in copper, and  the watch, saying it was only pinch-beck?'    But his lady rebuked him for a saucy varlet, and turned him out of the  room at once, saying to me when he had gone, 'that the fool didn't  know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the  pocket-book that Freny took from her.'    Perhaps had I been a little older in the world's experience, I should  have begun to see that Madam Fitzsimons was not the person of fashion  she pretended to be; but, as it was, I took all her stories for truth,  and, when the landlord brought the bill for dinner, paid it with the air  of a lord. Indeed, she made no motion to produce the two pieces I had  lent to her; and so we rode on slowly towards Dublin, into which city we  made our entrance at nightfall. The rattle and splendour of the coaches,  the flare of the linkboys, the number and magnificence of the houses,  struck me with the greatest wonder; though I was careful to disguise  this feeling, according to my dear mother's directions, who told me that  it was the mark of a man of fashion never to wonder at anything, and  never to admit that any house, equipage, or company he saw, was more  splendid or genteel than what he had been accustomed to at home.    We stopped, at length, at a house of rather mean appearance, and were  let into a passage by no means so clean as that at Barryville, where  there was a great smell of supper and punch. A stout red-faced man,  without a periwig, and in rather a tattered nightgown and cap, made his  appearance from the parlour, and embraced his lady (for it was Captain  Fitzsimons) with a great deal of cordiality. Indeed, when he saw that a  stranger accompanied her, he embraced her more rapturously than ever.  In introducing me, she persisted in saying that I was her preserver, and  complimented my gallantry as much as if I had killed Freny, instead  of coming up when the robbery was over. The Captain said he knew the  Redmonds of Waterford intimately well: which assertion alarmed me, as I  knew nothing of the family to which I was stated to belong. But I posed  him, by asking WHICH of the Redmonds he knew, for I had never heard his  name in our family. He said he knew the Redmonds of Redmondstown. 'Oh,'  says I, 'mine are the Redmonds of Castle Redmond;' and so I put him off  the scent. I went to see my nag put up at a livery-stable hard by, with  the Captain's horse and chair, and returned to my entertainer.    Although there were the relics of some mutton-chops and onions on a  cracked dish before him, the Captain said, 'My love, I wish I had known  of your coming, for Bob Moriarty and I just finished the most delicious  venison pasty, which his Grace the Lord Lieutenant sent us, with a  flask of Sillery from his own cellar. You know the wine, my dear? But as  bygones are bygones, and no help for them, what say ye to a fine lobster  and a bottle of as good claret as any in Ireland? Betty, clear these  things from the table, and make the mistress and our young friend  welcome to our home.'    Not having small change, Mr. Fitzsimons asked me to lend him a  tenpenny-piece to purchase the dish of lobsters; but his lady, handing  out one of the guineas I had given her, bade the girl get the change  for that, and procure the supper; which she did presently, bringing back  only a very few shillings out of the guinea to her mistress, saying that  the fishmonger had kept the remainder for an old account. 'And the more  great big blundering fool you, for giving the gold piece to him,' roared  Mr. Fitzsimons. I forget how many hundred guineas he said he had paid  the fellow during the year.    Our supper was seasoned, if not by any great elegance, at least by a  plentiful store of anecdotes, concerning the highest personages of the  city; with whom, according to himself, the Captain lived on terms of  the utmost intimacy. Not to be behindhand with him, I spoke of my own  estates and property as if I was as rich as a duke. I told all the  stories of the nobility I had ever heard from my mother, and some that,  perhaps, I had invented; and ought to have been aware that my host  was an impostor himself, as he did not find out my own blunders and  misstatements. But youth is ever too confident. It was some time  before I knew that I had made no very desirable acquaintance in Captain  Fitzsimons and his lady; and, indeed, went to bed congratulating myself  upon my wonderful good luck in having, at the outset of my adventures,  fallen in with so distinguished a couple.    The appearance of the chamber I occupied might, indeed, have led me to  imagine that the heir of Fitzsimonsburgh Castle, county Donegal, was not  as yet reconciled with his wealthy parents; and, had I been an English  lad, probably my suspicion and distrust would have been aroused  instantly. But perhaps, as the reader knows, we are not so particular in  Ireland on the score of neatness as people are in this precise country;  hence the disorder of my bedchamber did not strike me so much. For were  not all the windows broken and stuffed with rags even at Castle Brady,  my uncle's superb mansion? Was there ever a lock to the doors there, or  if a lock, a handle to the lock or a hasp to fasten it to? So, though  my bedroom boasted of these inconveniences, and a few more; though my  counterpane was evidently a greased brocade dress of Mrs. Fitzsimons's,  and my cracked toilet-glass not much bigger than a half-crown, yet I was  used to this sort of ways in Irish houses, and still thought myself in  that of a man of fashion. There was no lock to the drawers, which, when  they DID open, were full of my hostess's rouge-pots, shoes, stays, and  rags; so I allowed my wardrobe to remain in my valise, but set out my  silver"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45590"],[0,"Les Villes tentaculaires, précédées des Campagnes hallucinées (#12)"],[1,"épouvante de grandeur.  Sublime, elle a pour prêtres les génies  Qui communient  De la lumière de ses yeux;  Les temps sont datés d'elle et marchent glorieux,  Selon que son vouloir les prend pour ostiaires;  Son poing crispé saisit les mille éclairs contraires  Et les assemble et les resserre et les unit,  Pour tordre et pour forger d'un coup, tout l'infini.  La rose Egypte et la Grèce dorée  Jadis, aux temps des Dieux, l'ont instaurée  En des temples d'où s'envolait l'oracle;  Et Paris et Florence ont rêvé le miracle  D'être, à leur tour, l'autel où ses pieds clairs,  Vibrants d'ailes, se poseraient sur l'univers.  Aujourd'hui même, elle apparaît dans les fumées  Les yeux offerts, les mains encor fermées,  Le corps exalté d'or et de soleil;  Un feu nouveau d'entre ses doigts vermeils  Glisse et provoque aux conquêtes certaines,  Mais les marteaux brutaux des tapages modernes  Cassent un bruit si fort, sous les cieux ternes,  Que son appel vers ses fervents s'entend à peine.    Et néanmoins elle est la totale harmonie  Qui se transforme et se restaure à l'infini,  Par à travers les mille efforts que l'on croit vains.  Elle est la clef du cycle humain,  Elle suggère à tous l'existence parfaite,  La simple joie et l'effort éperdu,  Vers les temps clairs, baignés de fêle  Et sonores, là-bas, d'un large accord inentendu.  Quiconque espère en elle est au delà de l'heure  Qui frappe aux cadrans noirs de sa demeure;  Et tandis que la foule abat, dans la douleur,  Ses pauvres bras tendus vers la splendeur,  Parfois, déjà, dans le mirage, ou quelque âme s'isole,  La beauté passe--et dit les futures paroles.
