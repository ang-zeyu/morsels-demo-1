If so it  happen, that his Disciple prove of so different a condition, that he  rather love to give eare to an idle fable than to the report of some  noble voiage, or other notable and wise discourse, when he shall  heare it; that at the sound of a Drum or clang of a Trumpet, which  are wont to rowse and arme the youthly heat of his companions,  turneth to another that calleth him to see a play, tumbling, jugling  tricks, or other idle lose-time sports; and who for pleasures sake  doth not deeme it more delightsome to returne all sweatie and wearie  from a victorious combat, from wrestling, or riding of a horse, than  from a Tennis-court or dancing schoole, with the prize or honour of  such exercises; The best remedy I know for such a one is, to put him  prentice to some base occupation, in some good towne or other, yea,  were he the sonne of a Duke; according to Platoes rule, who saith  \"That children must be placed, not according to their fathers  conditions, but the faculties of their mind.\" Since it is  Philosophie that teacheth us to live, and that infancie as well as  other ages, may plainly read her lessons in the same, why should it  not be imparted unto young Schollers?         Vdum et molle lutum est, nunc nunc properandus, et acri       Fingendus sine fine rota.       [Footnote: PES. Sat. iii. 23.]         He's moist and soft mould, and must by and by       Be cast, made up, while wheele whirls readily.    We are taught to live when our life is well-nigh spent. Many  schollers have been infected with that loathsome and marrow-wasting  disease before ever they came to read Aristotles treatise of  Temperance. Cicero was wont to say, \"That could he out-live the  lives of two men, he should never find leasure to study the Lyrike  Poets.\" And I find these Sophisters both worse and more  unprofitable. Our childe is engaged in greater matters; And but the  first fifteene or sixteene yeares of his life are due unto  Pedantisme, the rest unto action: let us therefore imploy so short  time as we have to live in more necessarie instructions. It is an  abuse; remove these thornie quiddities of Logike, whereby our life  can no whit be amended, and betake our selves to the simple  discourses of Philosophy; know how to chuse and fitly to make use of  them: they are much more easie to be conceived than one of Bocace  his tales. A childe comming from nurse is more capable of them, than  he is to learne to read or write. Philosophy hath discourses,  whereof infancie as well as decaying old-age may make good use. I am  of Plutarkes mind, which is, that Aristotle did not so much ammuse  his great Disciple about the arts how to frame Syllogismes, or the  principles of Geometric, as he endevoured to instruct him with good  precepts concerning valour, prowesse, magnanimitie, and temperance,  and an undanted assurance not to feare any thing; and with such  munition he sent him, being yet verie young, to subdue the Empire of  the world, only with 30000 footmen, 4000 horsemen, and 42000 Crownes  in monie. As for other arts and sciences; he saith Alexander  honoured them, and commended their excellencie and comlinesse; but  for any pleasure he tooke in them, his affection could not easily be  drawne to exercise them.           --petite hinc juvenesque senesque       Finem animo certum, miserisque viatica canis.       [Footnote: Sat. v. 64]         Young men and old, draw hence (in your affaires)       Your minds set marke, provision for gray haires.    It is that which Epicurus said in the beginning of his letter to  Memiceus: \"Neither let the youngest shun nor the oldest wearie  himselfe in philosophying, for who doth otherwise seemeth to say,  that either the season to live happily is not yet come, or is  already past.\" Yet would I not have this young gentleman pent-up,  nor carelesly cast-off to the heedlesse choler, or melancholy humour  of the hasty Schoole-master. I would not have his budding spirit  corrupted with keeping him fast-tied, and as it were labouring  fourteene or fifteene houres a day poaring on his booke, as some  doe, as if he were a day-labouring man; neither doe I thinke it fit,  if at any time, by reason of some solitairie or melancholy  complexion, he should be scene with an over-indiscreet application  given to his booke, it should be cherished in him; for, that doth  often make him both unapt for civill conversation and distracts him  from better imployments: How many have I scene in my daies, by an  over-greedy desire of knowledge, become as it were foolish?  Carneades was so deeply plunged, and as I may say besotted in it,  that he could never have leasure to cut his haire, or pare his  nailes: nor would I have his noble manners obscured by the  incivilitie and barbarisme of others. The French wisdome hath long  since proverbially been spoken of as verie apt to conceive study in  her youth, but most unapt to keepe it long. In good truth, we see at  this day that there is nothing lovelier to behold than the young  children of France; but for the most part, they deceive the hope  which was fore-apprehended of them: for when they once become men,  there is no excellencie at all in them. I have heard men of  understanding hold this opinion, that the Colleges to which they are  sent (of which there are store) doe thus besot them: whereas to our  scholler, a cabinet, a gardin, the table, the bed, a solitarinesse,  a companie, morning and evening, and all houres shall be alike unto  him, all places shall be a study for him: for Philosophy (as a  former of judgements, and modeler of customes) shall be his  principall lesson, having the privilege to entermeddle her selfe  with all things, and in all places. Isocrates the Orator, being once  requested at a great banket to speake of his art, when all thought  he had reason to answer, said, \"It is not now time to doe what I  can, and what should now be done, I cannot doe it; For, to present  orations, or to enter into disputation of Rhetorike, before a  companie assembled together to be merrie, and make good cheere,  would be but a medley of harsh and jarring musicke.\" The like may be  said of all other Sciences. But touching Philosophy, namely, in that  point where it treateth of man, and of his duties and offices, it  hath been the common judgement of the wisest, that in regard of the  pleasantnesse of her conversatione, she ought not to be rejected,  neither at banquets nor at sports. And Plato having invited her to  his solemne feast, we see how kindly she entertaineth the companie  with a milde behaviour, fitly suting her selfe to time and place,  notwithstanding it be one of his learned'st and profitable  discourses.         AEque pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aque,       Et neglecta aeque pueris senibusque nocebit.       [Footnote: HOR. 1. i. Epist. 125.]         Poore men alike, alike rich men it easeth,       Alike it, scorned, old and young displeaseth.    So doubtlesse he shall lesse be idle than others; for even as the  paces we bestow walking in a gallerie, although they be twice as  many more, wearie us not so much as those we spend in going a set  journey: So our lesson being past over, as it were, by chance, or  way of encounter, without strict observance of time or place, being  applied to all our actions, shall be digested, and never felt. All  sports and exercises shall be a part of his study; running,  wrestling, musicke, dancing, hunting, and managing of armes and  horses. I would have the exterior demeanor or decencie, and the  disposition of his person to be fashioned together with his mind:  for, it is not a mind, it is not a body that we erect, but it is a  man, and we must not make two parts of him. And as Plato saith, They  must not be erected one without another, but equally be directed, no  otherwise than a couple of horses matched to draw in one selfe-same  teeme. And to heare him, doth he not seeme to imploy more time and  care in the exercises of his bodie: and to thinke that the minde is  together with the same exercised, and not the contrarie? As for  other matters, this institution ought to be directed by a sweet-  severe mildnesse; Not as some do, who in liew of gently-bidding  children to the banquet of letters, present them with nothing but  horror and crueltie. Let me have this violence and compulsion  removed, there is nothing that, in my seeming, doth more bastardise  and dizzie a welborne and gentle nature: If you would have him stand  in awe of shame and punishment, doe not so much enure him to it:  accustome him patiently to endure sweat and cold, the sharpnesse of  the wind, the heat of the sunne, and how to despise all hazards.  Remove from him all nicenesse and quaintnesse in clothing, in lying,  in eating, and in drinking: fashion him to all things, that he prove  not a faire and wanton-puling boy, but a lustie and vigorous boy:  When I was a child, being a man, and now am old, I have ever judged  and believed the same. But amongst other things, I could never away  with this kind of discipline used in most of our Colleges. It had  peradventure been lesse hurtfull, if they had somewhat inclined to  mildnesse, or gentle entreatie. It is a verie prison of captivated  youth, and proves dissolute in punishing it before it be so. Come  upon them when they are going to their lesson, and you heare nothing  but whipping and brawling, both of children tormented, and masters  besotted with anger and chafing. How wide are they, which go about  to allure a childs mind to go to its booke, being yet but tender and  fearefull, with a stearne-frowning countenance, and with hands full  of rods? Oh wicked and pernicious manner of teaching! which  Quintillian hath very wel noted, that this imperious kind of  authoritie,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56684"],[0,"The Lectures on Faith (#12)"],[1,"God, and those who have this  testimony will have faith to lay hold on eternal life, and will be  enabled, through faith, to endure unto the end, and receive the crown  that is laid up for them that love the appearing of our Lord Jesus  Christ. But those who do not make the sacrifice cannot enjoy this  faith, because men are dependent upon this sacrifice in order to obtain  this faith: therefore, they cannot lay hold upon eternal life, because  the revelations of God do not guarantee unto them the authority so to  do, and without this guarantee faith could not exist.    11. All the saints of whom we have account, in all the revelations of  God which are extant, obtained the knowledge which they had of their  acceptance in his sight, through the sacrifice which they offered  unto him: and through the knowledge thus obtained their faith became  sufficiently strong to lay hold upon the promise of eternal life, and  to endure as seeing him who is invisible; and were enabled, through  faith, to combat the powers of darkness, contend against the wiles of  the adversary, overcome the world, and obtain the end of their faith,  even the salvation of their souls.    12. But those who have not made this sacrifice to God, do not know  that the course which they pursue is well pleasing in his sight; for  whatever may be their belief or their opinion, it is a matter of doubt  and uncertainty in their mind; and where doubt and uncertainty are,  there faith is not, nor can it be. For doubt and faith do not exist in  the same person at the same time. So that persons whose minds are under  doubts and fears cannot have unshaken confidence, and where unshaken  confidence is not, there faith is weak, and where faith is weak the  persons will not be able to contend against all the opposition,  tribulations, and afflictions which they will have to encounter in  order to be heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ Jesus; and they  will grow weary in their minds, and the adversary will have power over  them and destroy them.    _Note_. This Lecture is so plain, and the facts set forth so  self-evident, that it is deemed unnecessary to form a catechism upon  it: the student is therefore instructed to commit the whole to memory.        LECTURE SEVENTH.    Of Faith.    SECTION VII.    1. In the preceding lectures, we treated of what faith was, and of the  object on which it rested. Agreeably to our plan, we now proceed to  speak of its effects:    2. As we have seen in our former lectures, that faith was the principle  of action and of power in all intelligent beings, both in heaven and  on earth, it will not be expected that we shall, in a lecture of this  description, attempt to unfold all its effects; neither is it necessary  to our purpose so to do; for it would embrace all things in heaven  and on earth, and encompass all the creations of God, with all their  endless varieties: for no world has yet been framed that was not framed  by faith; neither has there been an intelligent being on any of God's  creations who did not get there by reason of faith, as it existed  in himself or in some other being; nor has there been a change or a  revolution in any of the creatures of God, but it has been effected  by faith: neither will there be a change or a revolution unless it is  effected in the same way, in any of the vast creations of the Almighty;  for it is by faith that the Deity works.    3. Let us here offer some explanation in relation to faith, that  our meaning may be clearly comprehended: We ask, then, what are we  to understand by a man's working by faith? We answer: We understand  that when a man works by faith he works by mental exertion instead of  physical force: it is by words instead of exerting his physical powers,  with which every being works when he works by faith--God said, Let  there be light, and there was light--Joshua spake and the great lights  which God had created stood still--Elijah commanded, and the heavens  were stayed for the space of three years and six months, so that it did  not rain: he again commanded and the heavens gave forth rain--all this  was done by faith; and the Saviour says, If you have faith as a grain  of mustard seed, say to this mountain, remove, and it will remove; or  say to that sycamine tree, Be ye plucked up and planted in the midst of  the sea, and it shall obey you. Faith, then, works by words; and with  these its mightiest works have been, and will be, performed.    4. It surely will not be required of us to prove, that this is the  principle upon which all eternity has acted and will act; for every  reflecting mind must know, that it is by reason of this power that  all the hosts of heaven perform their works of wonder, majesty, and  glory: Angels move from place to place by virtue of this power--it is  by reason of it that they are enabled to descend from heaven to earth;  and were it not for the power of faith they never could be ministering  spirits to them who should be heirs of salvation, neither could they  act as heavenly messengers; for they would be destitute of the power  necessary to enable them to do the will of God.    5. It is only necessary for us to say, that the whole visible creation,  as it now exists, is the effect of faith--It was faith by which it  was framed, and it is by the power of faith that it continues in its  organized form, and by which the planets move round their orbits and  sparkle forth their glory: So, then, faith is truly the first principle  in the science of THEOLOGY, and when understood, leads the mind back to  the beginning, and carries it forward to the end; or in other words,  from eternity to eternity.    6. As faith, then, is the principle by which the heavenly hosts  perform their works, and by which they enjoy all their felicity, we  might expect to find it set forth in a revelation from God as the  principle upon which his creatures, here below, must act, in order to  obtain the felicities enjoyed by the saints in the eternal world, and  that when God would undertake to raise up men for the enjoyment of  himself, he would teach them the necessity of living by faith, and the  impossibility there was of their enjoying the blessedness of eternity  without it, seeing that all the blessings of eternity are the effects  of faith.    7. Therefore, it is said, and appropriately too, that without faith  it is impossible to please God. If it should be asked, Why is it  impossible to please God without faith? The answer would be, because,  without faith it is impossible for men to be saved; and as God desires  the salvation of men, he must of course desire that they should have  faith, and he could not be pleased unless they had, or else he could be  pleased with their destruction.    8. From this we learn that the many exhortations which have been given  by inspired men those who had received the word of the Lord, to have  faith in him, were not mere common-place matters, but were for the  best of all reasons, and that was, because, without it there was no  salvation, neither in this world nor in that which is to come. When men  begin to live by faith they begin to draw near to God; and when faith  is perfected they are like him; and because he is saved they are saved  also; for they will be in the same situation he is in, because they  have come to him; and when he appears they shall be like him, for they  will see him as he is.    9. As all the visible creation is an effect of faith, so is  salvation, also. (We mean salvation in its most extensive latitude of  interpretation, whether it is temporal or spiritual.) In order to have  this subject clearly set before the mind, let us ask what situation  must a person be in, in order to be saved? or what is the difference  between a saved man and one who is not saved? We answer from what we  have before seen of the heavenly worlds, they must be persons who can  work by faith, and who are able, by faith to be ministering spirits  to them who shall be heirs of salvation. And they must have faith to  enable them to act in the presence of the Lord, otherwise they cannot  be saved. And what constitutes the real difference between a saved  person and one not saved, is the difference in the degree of their  faith: one's faith has become perfect enough to Lay hold upon eternal  life, and the other's has not. But to be a little more particular, let  us ask, Where shall we find a prototype into whose likeness we may  be assimilated, in order that we may be made partakers of life and  salvation? or in other words, where shall we find a saved being? for if  we can find a saved being, we may ascertain, without much difficulty,  what all others must be, in order to be saved--they must be like that  individual to be saved: we think, that it will not be a matter of  dispute, that two beings, who are unlike each other, cannot both be  saved; for whatever constitutes the salvation of one, will constitute  the salvation of every creature which will be saved: and if we find  one saved being in all existence, we may see what all others must be,  or else not be saved. We ask, then, where is the prototype? or where  is the saved being? We conclude, as to the answer of this question,  there will be no dispute among those who believe the bible, that it is  Christ: all will agree in this, that he is the prototype or standard  of salvation; or, in other words, that he is a saved being. And if we  should continue our interrogation, and ask how it is that he is saved?  the answer would be, because he is a just and holy being; and if he  were anything different from what he is he would not be saved; for his  salvation depends on his being precisely what he is and nothing else;  for if it were possible for him to change, in the least degree, so sure  he would fail of salvation and lose all his dominion, power, authority  and glory, which constitutes salvation; for salvation consists in the  glory, authority, majesty,"]]]
