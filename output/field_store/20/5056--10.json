That's too bad!\" exclaimed the hunter. \"I wish I could  supply you with a bit of wire, but I haven't any. I'm just walking  about, trying my new gun.\"    \"I shouldn't think you'd find anything to shoot this time of year,\"  remarked Tom.    \"I don't expect to,\" answered the hunter, who had introduced himself  as Theodore Duncan. \"But I have just purchased a new gun, and I  wanted to try it. I expect to do considerable hunting this fall, and  so I'm getting ready for it.\"    \"Do you live near here?\"    \"Well, about ten miles away, on the other side of Lake Carlopa, but  I am fond of long walks in the woods. If you ever get to Waterford I  wish you'd come and see me, Mr. Swift. I have heard of your father.\"    \"I will, Mr. Duncan; but if I don't get something to repair my  machine with I'm not likely to get anywhere right away.\"    \"Well, I wish I could help you, but I haven't the least ingenuity  when it comes to machinery. Now if I could help you track down that  tramp--\"    \"Oh, no, thank you, I'd rather not have anything more to do with  him.\"    \"If I caught sight of him now,\" resumed the hunter, \"I fancy I could  make him halt, and, perhaps, give you back the wire. I'm a pretty  good shot, even if this is a new gun. I've been practicing at  improvised targets all day.\"    \"No; the less I have to do with him, the better I shall like it,\"  answered Tom, \"though I'm much obliged to you. I'll manage somehow  until I get to Pompville.\"    He started off again, the hunter disappearing in the woods, whence  the sound of his gun was again heard.    \"He's a queer chap,\" murmured Tom, \"but I like him. Perhaps I may  see him when I go to Waterford, if I ever do.\"    Tom was destined to see the hunter again, at no distant time, and  under strange circumstances. But now the lad's whole attention was  taken up with the difficulty in which he found himself. Vainly  musing on what object the tramp could have had in breaking off the  wire, the young inventor trudged on.    \"I guess he was one of the gang after dad's invention,\" thought Tom,  \"and he must have wanted to hinder me from getting to Albany, though  why I can't imagine.\" With a dubious shake of his head Tom  proceeded. It was hard work pushing the heavy machine through the  sand, and he was puffing before he had gone very far.    \"I certainly am up against it,\" he murmured. \"But if I can get a bit  of wire in Pompville I'll be all right. If I can't--\"    Just then Tom saw something which caused him to utter an exclamation  of delight.    \"That's the very thing!\" he cried. \"Why didn't I think of it  before?\"    Leaving his motor-cycle standing against a tree Tom hurried to a  fence that separated the road from a field. The fence was a barbed-wire  one, and in a moment Tom had found a broken strand.    \"Guess no one will care if I take a piece of this,\" he reasoned. \"It  will answer until I can get more. I'll have it in place in a jiffy!\"    It did not take long to get his pliers from his toolbag and snip off  a piece of the wire. Untwisting it he took out the sharp barbs, and  then was ready to attach it to the binding posts of the battery box  and the spark plug.    \"Hold on, though!\" he exclaimed as he paused in the work. \"It's got  to be insulated, or it will vibrate against the metal of the machine  and short circuit. I have it! My handkerchief! I s'pose Mrs. Baggert  will kick at tearing up a good one, but I can't help it.\"    Tom took a spare handkerchief from the bundle in which he had a few  belongings carried with the idea of spending the night at an Albany  hotel, and he was soon wrapping strips of linen around the wire,  tying them with pieces of string.    \"There!\" he exclaimed at length. \"That's insulated good enough, I  guess. Now to fasten it on and start.\"    The young inventor, who was quick with tools, soon had the  improvised wire in place. He tested the spark and found that it was  almost as good as when the regular copper conductor was in place.  Then, having taken a spare bit of the barbed-wire along in case of  another emergency, he jumped on the motor-cycle, pedaled it until  sufficient speed was attained, and turned on the power.    \"That's the stuff!\" he cried as the welcome explosions sounded. \"I  guess I've fooled Happy Harry! I'll get to Albany pretty nearly on  time, anyhow. But that tramp surely had me worried for a while.\"    He rode into Pompville, and on inquiring in a plumbing shop managed  to get a bit of copper wire that answered better than did the  galvanized piece from the fence. The readjustment was quickly made,  and he was on his way again. As it was getting close to noon he  stopped near a little spring outside of Pompville and ate a  sandwich, washing it down with the cold water. Then he started for  Centreford.    As he was coming into the city he heard an automobile behind him. He  steered to one side of the road to give the big car plenty of room  to pass, but it did not come on as speedily as he thought it would.  He looked back and saw that it was going to stop near him.  Accordingly he shut off the power of his machine.    \"Is this the road to Centreford?\" asked one of the travelers in the  auto.    \"Straight ahead,\" answered the lad.    At the sound of his voice one of the men in the big touring car  leaned forward and whispered something to one on the front seat. The  second man nodded, and looked closely at Tom. The youth, in turn,  stared at the men. He could not distinguish their faces, as they had  on auto goggles.    \"How many miles is it?\" asked the man who had whispered, and at the  sound of his voice Tom felt a vague sense that he had heard it  before.    \"Three,\" answered the young inventor, and once more he saw the men  whisper among themselves.    \"Thanks,\" spoke the driver of the car, and he threw in the gears. As  the big machine darted ahead the goggles which one of the men wore  slipped off. Tom had a glimpse of his face.    \"Anson Morse!\" he exclaimed. \"If that isn't the man who was sneaking  around dad's motor shop he's his twin brother! I wonder if those  aren't the men who are after the patent model? I must be on my  guard!\" and Tom, watching the car fade out of sight on the road  ahead of him, slowly started his motor-cycle. He was much puzzled  and alarmed.          CHAPTER XIII.    CAUGHT IN A STORM      The more Tom tried to reason out the cause of the men's actions, the  more he dwelt upon his encounter with the tramp, and the harder he  endeavored to seek a solution of the queer puzzle, the more  complicated it seemed. He rode on until he saw in a valley below him  the buildings of the town of Centreford, and, with a view of them, a  new idea came into his mind.    \"I'll go get a good dinner,\" he decided, \"and perhaps that will help  me to think more clearly. That's what dad always does when he's  puzzling over an invention.\" He was soon seated in a restaurant,  where he ate a substantial dinner. \"I'm just going to stop puzzling  over this matter,\" he decided. \"I'll push on to Albany and tell the  lawyer, Mr. Crawford. Perhaps he can advise me.\"    Once this decision was made Tom felt better.    \"That's just what I needed,\" he thought; \"some one to shift the  responsibility upon. I'll let the lawyers do the worrying. That's  what they're paid for. Now for Albany, and I hope I don't have to  stop, except for supper, until I get there. I've got to do some  night riding, but I've got a powerful lamp, and the roads from now  on are good.\"    Tom was soon on his way again. The highway leading to Albany was a  hard, macadam one, and he fairly flew along the level stretches.    \"This is making good time,\" he thought. \"I won't be so very late,  after all; that is, if nothing delays me.\"    The young inventor looked up into the sky. The sun, which had been  shining brightly all day, was now hidden behind a mass of hazy  clouds, for which the rider was duly grateful, as it was becoming  quite warm.    \"It's more like summer than I thought,\" said Tom to himself. \"I  shouldn't be surprised if we got rain to-morrow.\"    Another look at the sky confirmed him in this belief, and he had not  gone on many miles farther when his opinion was suddenly changed.  This was brought about by a dull rumble in the west, and Tom noticed  that a bank of low-lying clouds had formed, the black, inky masses  of vapor being whirled upward as if by some powerful blast.    \"Guess my storm is going to arrive ahead of time,\" he said. \"I'd  better look for shelter.\"    With a suddenness that characterizes summer showers, the whole sky  became overcast. The thunder increased, and the flashes of lightning  became more frequent and dazzling. A wind sprang up and blew clouds  of dust in Tom's face.    \"It certainly is going to be a thunder storm,\" he admitted. \"I'm  bound to be delayed now, for the roads will be mucky. Well, there's  no help for it. If I get to Albany before midnight I'll be doing  well.\"    A few drops of rain splashed on his hands, and as he looked up to  note the state of the sky others fell in his face. They were big  drops, and where they splashed on the road they formed little  globules of mud.    \"I'll head for that big tree,\" thought Tom \"It will give me some  shelter. I'll wait there--\" His words were interrupted by a  deafening crash of thunder which followed close after a blinding  flash. \"No tree for mine!\" murmured Tom. \"I forgot that they're  dangerous in a storm. I wonder where I can stay?\"    He turned on all the power possible and sprinted ahead. Around a  curve in the road he went, leaning over to preserve his balance, and  just as the rain came pelting down in a torrent he saw just ahead of  him a white church on the lonely country road. To one side was a  long shed, where the farmers were in the habit of leaving their  teams when they came to service.    \"Just the thing!\" cried the boy; \"and just in time!\"    He turned his motor-cycle into the yard surrounding the church, and  a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#12)"],[1,"myself.--But, my dear Frankenstein,\" continued he, stopping short, and  gazing full in my face, \"I did not before remark how very ill you  appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for  several nights.\"    \"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one  occupation, that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see:  but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an  end, and that I am at length free.\"    I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to  allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick  pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the  thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my  apartment might still be there, alive, and walking about. I dreaded to  behold this monster; but I feared still more that Henry should see him.  Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the  stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock  of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused; and a cold  shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as children are  accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them  on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the  apartment was empty; and my bed-room was also freed from its hideous  guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have  befallen me; but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I  clapped my hands for joy, and ran down to Clerval.    We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;  but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed  me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse  beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same  place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.  Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival;  but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes  for which he could not account; and my loud, unrestrained, heartless  laughter, frightened and astonished him.    \"My dear Victor,\" cried he, \"what, for God's sake, is the matter? Do not  laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this?\"    \"Do not ask me,\" cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought  I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; \"_he_ can tell.--Oh, save  me! save me!\" I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled  furiously, and fell down in a fit.    Poor Clerval! what must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he  anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was  not the witness of his grief; for I was lifeless, and did not recover my  senses for a long, long time.    This was the commencement of a nervous fever, which confined me for  several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I  afterwards learned that, knowing my father's advanced age, and unfitness  for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make  Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my  disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse  than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not  doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that  he could towards them.    But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and  unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The  form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before  my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words  surprised Henry: he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my  disturbed imagination; but the pertinacity with which I continually  recurred to the same subject, persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed  its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.    By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses, that alarmed and  grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became  capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I  perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared, and that the young  buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a  divine spring; and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I  felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom  disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was  attacked by the fatal passion.    \"Dearest Clerval,\" exclaimed I, \"how kind, how very good you are to me.  This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised  yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you?  I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been  the occasion; but you will forgive me.\"    \"You will repay me entirely, if you do not discompose yourself, but get  well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I  may speak to you on one subject, may I not?\"    I trembled. One subject! what could it be? Could he allude to an object  on whom I dared not even think?    \"Compose yourself,\" said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, \"I  will not mention it, if it agitates you; but your father and cousin  would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own  handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been, and are uneasy at  your long silence.\"    \"Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first  thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love, and  who are so deserving of my love.\"    \"If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to  see a letter that has been lying here some days for you: it is from your  cousin, I believe.\"          CHAPTER VI.      Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my own  Elizabeth:--    \"My dearest Cousin,    \"You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind  Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are  forbidden to write--to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,  is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought  that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained  my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his  encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a  journey; yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it  myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sick bed  has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your  wishes, nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor  cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting  better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in  your own handwriting.    \"Get well--and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home, and  friends who love you dearly. Your father's health is vigorous, and he  asks but to see you,--but to be assured that you are well; and not a  care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would  be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen, and full  of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss, and to enter  into foreign service; but we cannot part with him, at least until his  elder brother return to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a  military career in a distant country; but Ernest never had your powers  of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter;--his time is  spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. I fear  that he will become an idler, unless we yield the point, and permit him  to enter on the profession which he has selected.    \"Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken  place since you left us. The blue lake, and snow-clad mountains, they  never change;--and I think our placid home, and our contented hearts are  regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up my  time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none  but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change has  taken place in our little household. Do you remember on what occasion  Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not; I will relate  her history, therefore, in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a  widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. This girl had  always been the favourite of her father; but, through a strange  perversity, her mother could not endure her, and, after the death of M.  Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this; and, when Justine  was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at  our house. The republican institutions of our country have produced  simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great  monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the  several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither  so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A  servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France  and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of  a servant; a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include  the idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.    \"Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I  recollect you once remarked, that if you were in an ill-humour, one  glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that  Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica--she looked so  frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,  by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which  she had at first intended. This"]]]
