In concluding this report, the judges very much regret the limitation  in time which has prevented them securing position tests of this very  interesting exhibit in horology, as much on account of the exhibitors  as on their own account. Such advances have in the last few years been  made in this science that, in the interest of the public as well as of  the manufacturers, a sufficiency of time is desirable to make tests  in five or six positions, and fourteen days should be allowed to each  position. Tests for heat and cold, and an opportunity to carefully  note barometric and thermometric influences upon the various systems  of adjustment, would be very valuable and interesting.

Corn files and pencils are getting  stale, and an enterprising inhabitant of Dresden has lately brought  out what he calls a \"corn magnet.\" It is evident that it is as unlike  a magnet as possible, for an examination shows that it is made of  sulphur colored with graphite. The directions are to set fire to  one end, and let a drop of the melted sulphur fall upon the corn. A  convenient and agreeable operation, especially if the corn is on  the bottom of the foot. It is needless to say that the corn usually  survives the slight burn and lives to torment the owner again. All  burns, whether by caustic or otherwise, should be avoided.           *       *       *       *       *          EXPERIMENTS ON THE RESISTANCE OF MATERIALS.    Prof. J. Burkitt Webb, C.E., now in Europe, writes as follows:    On the invitation of Prof. Spangenberg we visited the  \"Versuchsstation,\" at the Gewerbe-Akademie, where the important  experiments upon materials for engineering purposes are being made.  These tests are of two kinds--trials of strength and trials of  endurance. The first are made by means of very heavy and accurate  machinery, mostly new within the last two or three years; the latter  are the celebrated \"Dauer-Versuche,\" a description of which we will  reserve for another letter.    The main machine, of which there are three or four duplicates at work  at various points in Germany, is housed in a special building in the  interior court of the academy. It consists of heavy iron \"ways,\" some  fifty feet long, accurately planed and secured to a stone foundation,  with a hydraulic pump and scales at one end, and a number of massive  attachments for subjecting the piece of iron or other material to  various kinds of strains. There are also other instruments which  belong to the machine as delicate as it is heavy, and which are used  for adjusting the parts of the apparatus, reading the results of a  test, or making calculations. This machine differs from others in the  way of measuring the force used. It has been the custom to take  the pressure on the liquid in the hydraulic cylinder, as shown by a  manometer, as the basis of calculation. This introduces an inaccuracy,  as part of this is due to the friction on the piston packing, and the  true pressure is less than that shown by this irregular quantity.  To avoid this difficulty a massive lever is introduced between the  hydraulic press and the point where its pressure is applied. One arm  of this lever is one-eighth inch long, and the other five hundred  times as long, so that to measure a pressure of one hundred tons, four  hundred pounds must be placed on the scale pan which hangs from  the end of the long end of the lever. The fulcrum rests against the  piston, and the short end of the lever is connected by heavy  links with the apparatus by means of which the strain is applied.  Technically speaking the fulcra of scales are \"knife edges,\" but to  convey a pressure of one hundred tons and remain free to move, these  edges must be very obtuse, perhaps 160 deg. to 170 deg.; they must be as  long as possible, some fifteen inches, of the best hardened steel,  accurately ground, and must rest against a hardened plate of steel.  Made with the greatest care the sharp edge under such a pressure will  sometimes make a dent in the plate and the scales are clogged. As  it is very difficult to measure the one-eighth inch with accuracy,  another lever is provided with a ratio of one to ten, and with a  short arm long enough to be made of a certain length with but a small  percentage of error. To test the main lever this occupies essentially  the same place as a sample of iron to be stretched; it is loaded with,  say, two hundred pounds, which it multiplies to a ton; this pressure  is then weighed by placing four pounds upon the main scale pan,  and the fulcrum of the main lever is adjusted until the two weights  balance.    The attachments consist of: I. Jaws for holding round, square, and  flat bars to be submitted to tension. II. Arrangements for holding  beams and columns in various ways at their ends, and compressing them  until they are crushed or \"buckle.\" III. Two massive graduated iron  beams, which are placed crosswise on the \"ways,\" and used for twisting  shafts, railroad axles, etc. IV. A face plate, about four feet square,  for holding plates of boiler iron nearly as large by the perimeter,  and crushing in the middle by forcing various shaped pieces against  it. V. Apparatus for bending a beam by crushing an angular piece into  it; and in the same connection, VI. Shears for cutting off bars of  metal and measuring the force required.    In connection with this main machine were some, quite old, which had  been used in the infancy of the subject by a former professor, and a  new special machine for the same purpose as attachment V., and which  seemed to \"kink\" a piece of railroad iron as if it were only lead. In  this the pressure was obtained by screws.    Among the instruments used for the adjustment of the parts of the  main machine we saw the finest cathetometer we had ever seen. This  instrument, by Breithaupt, in Cassel, has two telescopes, with  micrometer screws with more than one hundred and twenty-five threads  per inch, and scales graduated on glass with more than six hundred and  twenty five divisions to the inch. Another instrument for measuring  the deflection, in two directions at once, of a column under pressure,  has micrometer screws with more than two hundred and fifty threads per  inch. We saw also a planimeter, which not only calculated mechanically  the area of a figure, but gave also its center of gravity, moment  of inertia, etc. We saw also a French calculating machine; the other  apparatus is, we believe, all German. If one is, however, critical, it  will be found in many lines of business that all the fine goods here  are imported, though naturally the Germans are slow to acknowledge it.    We witnessed the experiments on a sample of round iron over an inch  in diameter, and on a piece of iron plate three inches wide by half an  inch thick. It is perhaps needless to say that they seemed to stretch  like putty and to break like thread. The pressure is put on a few  hundred pounds at a time, and the elongation is read by two telescopes  and a scale, which multiply the distance five hundred times. At the  same time the first \"elastic limit\" is watched for. Before this is  arrived at the piece will return to its original length when the  tension is removed; after this the stretching is in part permanent.  One of the facts brought out is that there are _several_ elastic  limits, in copper seven or eight. The appearance of the surface after  the elastic limit is passed and the iron stretches is peculiar. A wavy  appearance is seen, and longitudinal ridges begin to form, due to the  changes going on in the crystals, by which they adapt themselves to  the increased length. After a further general adaptation of structure  becomes impossible, these appearances culminate in the weakest part.  The apparatus for measuring the increase in length has long since been  removed, and the places where it was attached have been filed smooth  to avoid introducing the weak point artificially. The diameter of this  part now reduces rapidly, and the surface becomes rough and the iron  hot--you can see it stretch. When it has reduced twenty-five or more  per cent. it gives way suddenly with a sharp crack. The percentage of  reduction before breaking is now recorded with the observations on the  elasticity and the breaking strain, and the experiment is at an end.  It suggested itself to see if the work done in pulling the iron  apart was fully accounted for by the heat generated. We could easily  calculate the work up to the point of maximum tension, but after this  the force required was not measured; however, a rough calculation  showed that the iron was as hot as required, or at least that the data  would require to be quite complete if any residual was to be found.    Berlin, May 13, 1880.           *       *       *       *       *          ENGINEERING INVENTIONS.    An improved wheel guard, which will push any obstacles on the track  aside, and which can be adjusted to a greater or less height above the  rails, has been patented by Mr. Solomon Brisac, of New York city.  It consists in a wheel guard formed of a metallic box with a beveled  front side, which box is adjustably fastened to the front end of a  recessed plate resting on and partially surrounding the grease box.  The box is braced by means of a rod attached to its forward end and  passing into a socket fastened to the bottom of the car.    An improved water motor, constructed on the general principle of a  rotary engine, in which two compartments are arranged side by side,  with a partition intervening, and in which the sliding pistons in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38516"],[0,"The Children's Life of the Bee (#12)"],[1," yards away from the double walls of the  hive.    This cry, this war-song, has the strangest effect on the workers. It  fills them with terror, it has an almost paralyzing influence upon them.  When she sends it forth, the guards, who the moment before may have been  treating her rather roughly, will at once cease all opposition, and will  wait, with bent heads, in meekest submission, till the dreadful song  shall have stopped.    For two or three days, sometimes even for five, the queen's lament will  be heard, the fierce challenge to her well-guarded rivals. And these, in  their turn, are coming to life; they are beginning to gnaw at the lids  of their cradles. Should they emerge from them while the angry queen is  still near, with her one desire to destroy them, a mighty confusion  would spread itself over the city.    But the spirit of the hive has taken its precautions, and the guards  have received the necessary instructions. They know exactly what must be  done, and when to do it. They are well aware that if the princesses were  to come out of their lodging too soon, they would fall into the hands of  their furious elder sister, who would destroy them one by one. To avoid  this, therefore, the workers keep on adding layers of wax to the cells  as fast as the princesses within are stripping it away; so that all  their gnawing and eagerness are of no avail, and the captives must bide  their time. One of them perhaps will hear the war-cry of her enemy; and  although she has not yet come into contact with life, nor knows what a  hive may be, she answers the challenge from within the depths of her  prison. But her song is different; it is hollow and stifled, for it has  to pass through the walls of a tomb; and when night is falling and  noises are hushed, while high over all is the silence of the stars, the  bee-keeper is able to distinguish, and recognize, this exchange of  challenges between the restlessly wandering queen and the young  princesses still in their prison.    The young queens will have benefited by the long stay in their cradles,  for when at last they come out they are big and strong, and able to fly.  But this period of waiting has also given strength to the first-born  queen, who is now able to face the perils of the voyage. The time has  come, therefore, for the second swarm, called the \"cast,\" to depart,  with the eldest queen at its head. No sooner has she gone than the  workers left in the hive will release one of the princesses from her  cradle; she will at once proceed to show the same murderous desires, to  send forth the same cries of anger, as her sister had done before her,  till at last, after another three or four days, she will leave the hive  in her turn, at the head of the third swarm, to build a new home far  away. A case has been known where a hive, through its swarms and the  swarms of its swarms, was able in a single season to send forth no less  than thirty colonies.    This excessive eagerness, which is known as \"swarming-fever,\" usually  follows a severe winter; and one might almost believe that the bees,  always in touch with the secrets of nature, are conscious of the dangers  that threaten their race. But at ordinary times, when the seasons have  been normal, this \"fever\" will rarely occur in a strong and  well-governed hive; many will swarm only once, and some, indeed, not at  all.    The second swarm will in any event generally be the last, as the bees  will be afraid of unduly impoverishing their city, or it may be that  prudence will be urged upon them by the threatening skies. They will  then allow the third queen to kill the princesses in their cradles;  whereupon the ordinary duties of the hive will at once be resumed, and  the bees will have to work harder than ever in order to provide food for  the larvae and generally to replenish the storehouses before the arrival  of winter.    The second and third swarms will sally forth in the same way as the  first, with the difference only that the bees will be fewer in number,  and that, owing perhaps to less scouts being available, operations will  not be conducted with quite as much prudence and forethought. Also, the  younger queen will be more active and vigorous than her sister, and will  therefore fly much further away, leading the swarm to a considerable  distance from the hive. As a consequence, these second and third swarms  will have greater difficulties to meet, and their fate will be more  uncertain. So all-powerful, however, is the law of the future, that  none of these perils will induce the queen to show the least hesitation.  The bees of the second and third swarms display the same eagerness, the  same enthusiasm, as those of the first; the workers flock round the  fierce young queen, as she gropes her way out of her cell, and there is  not one of them that shrinks from accompanying her on the voyage where  there is so much to lose and so little to gain. Why, one asks, do they  show this amazing zeal; what makes them so cheerfully abandon all their  present happiness? Who is it selects from the crowd those who shall stay  behind, and dictates who are to go? The exiles would seem to belong to  no special class; around the queen who is never to return, veteran  foragers jostle tiny worker-bees who will for the first time be facing  the dizziness of the skies.    We will not attempt to relate the many adventures that these different  swarms will encounter. At times, two of them will join forces; at  others, two or three of the imprisoned princesses will contrive to join  the groups that are forming. The bee-keeper of to-day takes steps to  ensure that the second and third swarms shall always return to the  mother-hive. In that case, the rival queens will face each other on the  comb; the workers will gather around and watch the combat; and, when the  stronger has overcome the weaker, they will remove the bodies, forget  the past, return to their cells and their storehouses, and resume their  peaceful path to the flowers that are awaiting and inviting them.          V    THE MASSACRE OF THE MALES      If the skies remain pure, the air still warm, and pollen and nectar are  plentiful in the flowers, the workers will endure the presence of the  males for a brief space longer. The males are gross feeders, untidy in  their habits, wasteful and greedy; fat and idle, perfectly content to do  nothing but feast and enjoy themselves, they crowd the streets, block up  the passages, and are always in the way; they are a nuisance to the  workers, whom they treat with a certain good-natured arrogance,  apparently never suspecting how scornfully they themselves are  regarded, or the deep and ever-growing hatred to which they give rise.  They are still happily unconscious of the fate in store for them.    Careless of what the workers have to do, the males invariably select the  snuggest and warmest corners of the hive for their pleasant slumbers;  then, having slept their fill, they stroll jauntily to the choicest  cells, where the honey smells sweetest, and proceed to satisfy their  appetite. From noon till three, when the radiant countryside is a-quiver  beneath the blazing stare of a July or August sun, the drones will  saunter on to the threshold, and bask lazily there. They are gorgeous to  look at; their helmet is made of enormous black pearls, they have  doublet of yellowish velvet, two towering plumes and a mantle draped in  four folds. They stroll along, very pleased with themselves, full of  pomp and pride; they brush past the sentry, hustle the sweepers, and get  in the way of the honey-collectors as these return laden with their  humble spoil. Then one by one, they lazily spread their wings, and sail  off to the nearest flower, where they doze till they are awakened by the  fresh afternoon breeze. Thereupon they return to the hive, with the same  pomp and dignified air, sure of themselves and perfectly satisfied; they  make straight for the storehouses, and plunge their head up to the neck  into the vats of honey, taking in nourishment sufficient to restore  their strength that has been exhausted by so much labor; afterwards,  with ponderous steps, seeking the pleasant couch and giving themselves  up to the good, dreamless slumber that shall fold them in its embrace  till it be time for the next meal. But bees are less patient than men;  and one morning the long-expected word of command goes through the hive.  And there is a sudden transformation: the workers, hitherto so gentle  and peaceful, turn into judges, and executioners. We know not whence the  dreadful word issues; it may be that endurance has reached its limit,  and that indignation and anger have bubbled over. At any rate we find a  whole portion of the bee-people giving up their visits to the flowers,  and taking on themselves the administration of stern justice.    An army of furious workers suddenly attacks the great idle drones, as  they lie pleasantly asleep along the honeyed walls, and ruthlessly tear  them from their slumbers. The startled drones wake up, and stare round  in amazement, convinced at first that they must be dreaming, and the  prey of some dreadful nightmare. There must be some shocking mistake;  their muddled brains grope like a stagnant pond into which a moonbeam  has fallen. Their first impulse is to the nearest food-cell, to find  comfort and inspiration there. But gone for them are the days of May  honey, the essence of lime-trees and the fragrant ambrosia of thyme and  sage, of marjoram and white clover; the path that once lay so invitingly  open to the tempting reservoirs of sugar and sweets now bristles with a  burning-bush of poisonous, flaming stings. The air itself is no longer  the same; the dear smell of honey is gone, and in its place only now the  terrible odor of poison, of which thousands of tiny drops glisten at the  tip of the threatening stings. Around them is nothing but fury and  hatred; and before"]]]
