But the theories about Nova Persei have been almost as numerous as the  astronomers who have speculated about it. One of the most startling of  them assumed that the outburst was caused by the running amuck of a  dark star which had encountered another star surrounded with planets,  the renewed outbreaks of light after the principal one had faded being  due to the successive running down of the unfortunate planets! Yet  another hypothesis is based on what we have already said of the tidal  influence that two close approaching suns would have upon each other.  Supposing two such bodies which had become encrusted, but remained  incandescent and fluid within, to approach within almost striking  distance; they would whirl each other about their common center of  gravity, and at the same time their shells would burst under the tidal  strain, and their glowing nuclei being disclosed would produce a great  outburst of light. Applying this theory to a ``nova,'' like that of  1866 in the ``Northern Crown,'' which had been visible as a small star  before the outbreak, and which afterward resumed its former aspect, we  should have to assume that a yet shining sun had been approached by a  dark body whose attraction temporarily burst open its photosphere. It  might be supposed that in this case the dark body was too far advanced  in cooling to suffer the same fate from the tidal pull of its victim.  But a close approach of that kind would be expected to result in the  formation of a binary system, with orbits of great eccentricity,  perhaps, and after the lapse of a certain time the outburst should be  renewed by another approximation of the two bodies. A temporary star  of that kind would rather be ranked as a variable.    The celebrated French astronomer, Janssen, had a different theory of  Nova Persei, and of temporary stars in general. According to his idea,  such phenomena might be the result of chemical changes taking place in  a sun without interference by, or collision with, another body.  Janssen was engaged for many years in trying to discover evidence of  the existence of oxygen in the sun, and he constructed his observatory  on the summit of Mount Blanc specially to pursue that research. He  believed that oxygen must surely exist in the sun since we find so  many other familiar elements included in the constitution of the solar  globe, and as he was unable to discover satisfactory evidence of its  presence he assumed that it existed in a form unknown on the earth. If  it were normally in the sun's chromosphere, or coronal atmosphere, he  said, it would combine with the hydrogen which we know is there and  form an obscuring envelope of water vapor. It exists, then, in a  special state, uncombined with hydrogen; but let the temperature of  the sun sink to a critical point and the oxygen will assume its normal  properties and combine with the hydrogen, producing a mighty outburst  of light and heat. This, Janssen thought, might explain the phenomena  of the temporary stars. It would also, he suggested, account for their  brief career, because the combination of the elements would be quickly  accomplished, and then the resulting water vapor would form an  atmosphere cutting off the radiation from the star within.    This theory may be said to have a livelier human interest than some of  the others, since, according to it, the sun may carry in its very  constitution a menace to mankind; one does not like to think of it  being suddenly transformed into a gigantic laboratory for the  explosive combination of oxygen and hydrogen! But while Janssen's  theory might do for some temporary stars, it is inadequate to explain  all the phenomena of Nova Persei, and particularly the appearance of  the great spiral nebula that seemed to exhale from the heart of the  star. Upon the whole, the theory of an encounter between a star and a  dark nebula seems best to fit the observations. By that hypothesis the  expanding billow of light surrounding the core of the conflagration is  very well accounted for, and the spectroscopic peculiarities are also  explained.    Dr Gustov Le Bon offers a yet more alarming theory, suggesting that  temporary stars are the result of atomic explosion; but we shall touch  upon this more fully in Chapter 14.    Twice in the course of this discussion we have called attention to the  change of color invariably undergone by temporary stars in the later  stages of their career. This was conspicuous with Nova Persei which  glowed more and more redly as it faded, until the nebulous light began  to overpower that of the stellar nucleus. Nothing could be more  suggestive of the dying out of a great fire. Moreover, change of color  from white to red is characteristic of all variable stars of long  period, such as ``Mira'' in Cetus. It is also characteristic of stars  believed to be in the later stages of evolution, and consequently  approaching extinction, like Antares and Betelgeuse, and still more  notably certain small stars which ``gleam like rubies in the field of  the telescope.'' These last appear to be suns in the closing period of  existence as self-luminous bodies. Between the white stars, such as  Sirius and Rigel, and the red stars, such as Aldebaran and Alpha  Herculis, there is a progressive series of colors from golden yellow  through orange to deep red. The change is believed to be due to the  increase of absorbing vapors in the stellar atmosphere as the body  cools down. In the case of ordinary stars these changes no doubt  occupy many millions of years, which represent the average duration of  solar life; but the temporary stars run through similar changes in a  few months: they resemble ephemeral insects -- born in the morning and  doomed to perish with the going down of the sun.    Explosive and Whirling Nebulae    One of the most surprising triumphs of celestial photography was  Professor Keeler's discovery, in 1899, that the great majority of the  nebulae have a distinctly spiral form. This form, previously known in  Lord Rosse's great ``Whirlpool Nebula,'' had been supposed to be  exceptional; now the photographs, far excelling telescopic views in  the revelation of nebular forms, showed the spiral to be the typical  shape. Indeed, it is a question whether all nebulae are not to some  extent spiral. The extreme importance of this discovery is shown in  the effect that it has had upon hitherto prevailing views of solar and  planetary evolution. For more than three-quarters of a century  Laplace's celebrated hypothesis of the manner of origin of the solar  system from a rotating and contracting nebula surrounding the sun had  guided speculation on that subject, and had been tentatively extended  to cover the evolution of systems in general. The apparent forms of  some of the nebulae which the telescope had revealed were regarded, and  by some are still regarded, as giving visual evidence in favor of this  theory. There is a ``ring nebula'' in Lyra with a central star, and a  ``planetary nebula'' in Gemini bearing no little resemblance to the  planet Saturn with its rings, both of which appear to be practical  realizations of Laplace's idea, and the elliptical rings surrounding  the central condensation of the Andromeda Nebula may be cited for the  same kind of proof.    But since Keeler's discovery there has been a decided turning away of  speculation another way. The form of the spiral nebulae seems to be  entirely inconsistent with the theory of an originally globular or  disk-shaped nebula condensing around a sun and throwing or leaving off  rings, to be subsequently shaped into planets. Some astronomers,  indeed, now reject Laplace's hypothesis in toto, preferring to think  that even our solar system originated from a spiral nebula. Since the  spiral type prevails among the existing nebulae, we must make any  mechanical theory of the development of stars and planetary systems  from them accord with the requirements which that form imposes. A  glance at the extraordinary variations upon the spiral which Professor  Keeler's photographs reveal is sufficient to convince one of the  difficulty of the task of basing a general theory upon them. In truth,  it is much easier to criticize Laplace's hypothesis than to invent a  satisfactory substitute for it. If the spiral nebulae seem to oppose it  there are other nebulae which appear to support it, and it may be that  no one fixed theory can account for all the forms of stellar evolution  in the universe. Our particular planetary system may have originated  very much as the great French mathematician supposed, while others  have undergone, or are now undergoing, a different process of  development. There is always a too strong tendency to regard an  important new discovery and the theories and speculations based upon  it as revolutionizing knowledge, and displacing or overthrowing  everything that went before. Upon the plea that ``Laplace only made a  guess'' more recent guesses have been driven to extremes and treated  by injudicious exponents as ``the solid facts at last.''    Before considering more recent theories than Laplace's, let us see  what the nature of the photographic revelations is. The vast celestial  maelstrom discovered by Lord Rosse in the ``Hunting Dogs'' may be  taken as the leading type of the spiral nebulae, although there are  less conspicuous objects of the kind which, perhaps, better illustrate  some of their peculiarities. Lord Rosse's nebula appears far more  wonderful in the photographs than in his drawings made with the aid of  his giant reflecting telescope at Parsonstown, for the photographic  plate records details that no telescope is capable of showing. Suppose  we look at the photograph of this object as any person of common sense  would look at any great and strange natural phenomenon. What is the  first thing that strikes the mind? It is certainly the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6653"],[0,"Voyages of Samuel De Champlain — Volume 01 (#12)"],[1," historical writers have supposed.    It would appear that while the French were carefully surveying the coasts  of New England, in order to fix upon an eligible site for a permanent  colonial settlement, the English were likewise upon the ground, engaged in  a similar investigation for the same purpose. From this period onward, for  more than a century and a half, there was a perpetual conflict and struggle  for territorial possession on the northern coast of America, between these  two great nations, sometimes active and violent, and at others subsiding  into a semi-slumber, but never ceasing until every acre of soil belonging  to the French had been transferred to the English by a solemn international  compact.    On this exploration, Champlain noticed along the coast from Kennebec to  Cape Cod, and described several objects in natural history unknown in  Europe, such as the horse-foot crab, [49] the black skimmer, and the wild  turkey, the latter two of which have long since ceased to visit this  region.    ENDNOTES:    34. _De Monts's Island_. Of this island Champlain says: \"This place was      named by Sieur De Monts the Island of St. Croix.\"--_Vide_ Vol. II. p.      32, note 86. St. Croix has now for a long time been applied as the name      of the river in which this island is found. The French denominated this      stream the River of the Etechemins, after the name of the tribe of      savages inhabiting its shores. _Vide_ Vol. II. p. 31. It continued to      be so called for a long time. Denys speaks of it under this name in      1672. \"Depuis la riviere de Pentagouet, jusques a celle de saint Jean,      il pent y avoir quarante a quarante cinq lieues; la premiere riviere      que l'on rencontre le long de la coste, est celle des Etechemins, qui      porte le nom du pays, depuis Baston jusques au Port royal, dont les      Sauvages qui habitent toute cette etendue, portent aussi le mesme      nom.\"--_Description Geographique et Historique des Costes de L'Amerique      Septentrionale_, par Nicholas Denys, Paris, 1672, p. 29, _et verso_.    35. Champlain had, by his own explorations and by consulting the Indians,      obtained a very full and accurate knowledge of this island at his first      visit, on the 5th of September, 1604, when he named it _Monts-deserts_,      which we preserve in the English form, MOUNT DESERT. He observed that      the distance across the channel to the mainland on the north side was      less than a hundred paces. The rocky and barren summits of this cluster      of little mountains obviously induced him to give to the island its      appropriate and descriptive name _Vide_ Vol. II. p. 39. Dr. Edward      Ballard derives the Indian name of this island, _Pemetiq_, from      _peme'te_, sloping, and _ki_, land. He adds that it probably denoted a      single locality which was taken by Biard's company as the name of the      whole island. _Vide Report of U. S. Coast Survey_ for 1868, p. 253.    36. Penobscot is a corruption of the Abnaki _pa'na8a'bskek_. A nearly exact      translation is \"at the fall of the rock,\" or \"at the descending rock.\"      _Vide Trumball's Ind. Geog. Names_, Collections Conn. His. Society,      Vol. II. p. 19. This name was originally given probably to some part of      the river to which its meaning was particularly applicable. This may      have been at the mouth of the river a Fort Point, a rocky elevation not      less than eighty feet in height. Or it may have been the \"fall of water      coming down a slope of seven or eight feet,\" as Champlain expresses it,      a short distance above the site of the present city of Bangor. That      this name was first obtained by those who only visited the mouth of the      river would seem to favor the former supposition.    37. Dr. Edward Ballard supposes the original name of this stream,      _Kadesquit_, to be derived from _kaht_, a Micmac word, for _eel_,      denoting _eel stream_, now corrupted into _Kenduskeag_. The present      site of the city of Bangor is where Biard intended to establish his      mission in 1613, but he was finally induced to fix it at Mount      Desert--_Vide Relations des Jesuites_, Quebec ed., Vol. I. p. 44.    38. The other gentlemen whose names we have learned were Messieurs      d'Orville, Champdore, Beaumont, la Motte Bourioli, Fougeray or Foulgere      de Vitre, Genestou, Sourin, and Boulay. The orthography of the names,      as they are mentioned from time to time, is various.    39. _Kennebec_. Biard, in the _Relation, de la Nouvelle France, Relations      des Jesuites_, Quebec ed., Vol. I. p. 35, writes it _Quinitequi_, and      Champlain writes it _Quinibequy_ and _Quinebequi_; hence Mr. Trumball      infers that it is probably equivalent in meaning to _quin-ni-pi-ohke_,      meaning \"long water place,\" derived from the Abnaki, _K8      ne-be-ki_.--_Vide Ind. Geog. Names_, Col. Conn. His. Soc. Vol. II. p.      15.    40. _Vide_ Vol. II. note 110.    41. _Sagadahock_. This name is particularly applied to the lower part of      the Kennebec. It is from the Abnaki, _sa'ghede'aki_, \"land at the      mouth.\"--_Vide Indian Geographical Names_, by J. H. Trumball, Col.      Conn. His. Society, Vol. II. p. 30. Dr. Edward Ballard derives it from      _sanktai-i-wi_, to finish, and _onk_, a locative, \"the finishing      place,\" which means the mouth of a river.--_Vide Report of U. S. Coast      Survey_, 1868, p. 258.    42. _Bacchus Island_. This was Richmond's Island, as we have stated in Vol.      II. note 123. It will be admitted that the Bacchus Island of Champlain      was either Richmond's Island or one of those in the bay of the Saco.      Champlain does not give a specific name to any of the islands in the      bay, as may be seen by referring to the explanations of his map of the      bay, Vol. II p. 65. If one of them had been Bacchus Island, he would      not have failed to refer to it, according to his uniform custom, under      that name. Hence it is certain that his Bacchus Island was not one of      those figured on his local map of the bay of the Saco. By reference to      the large map of 1632, it will be seen that Bacchus Island is      represented by the number 50, which is placed over against the largest      island in the neighborhood and that farthest to the east, which, of      course, must be Richmond's Island. It is, however, proper to state that      these reference figures are not in general so carefully placed as to      enable us to rely upon them in fixing a locality, particularly if      unsupported by other evidence. But in this case other evidence is not      wanting.    43. _Vide_ Vol. II. pp. 64-67.    44. _Nicotiana rustica. Vide_, Vol. II. by Charles Pickering, M.D. Boston,      note 130. _Chronological His. Plants_, 1879, p. 741, _et passim_.    45. Daniel Gookin, who wrote in 1674, speaks of the following subdivisions      among the Massachusetts Indians: \"Their chief sachem held dominion over      many other petty governours; as those of Weechagafkas, Neponsitt,      Punkapaog, Nonantam, Nashaway, and some of the Nipmuck people.\"--_Vide      Gookin's His. Col._    46. _Vide_ Vol. II. note 159. _Mushauiwomuk_, which we have converted into      _Shawmut, means_, \"where there is going-by-boat.\" The French, if they      heard the name and learned its meaning, could hardly have failed to see      the appropriateness of it as applied by the aborigines to Boston      harbor.--_Vide Trumball_ in Connecticut Historical Society's      Collections, Vol. II. p. 5.    47. It was probably on this very bluff from which was seen Nauset harbor on      the 19th of July, 1605, and after the lapse of two hundred and seventy      four years, on the 17th of November, 1879 the citizens of the United      States, with the flags of America, France, and England gracefully      waving over their heads, addressed their congratulations by telegraph      to the citizens of France at Brest on the communication between the two      countries that day completed through submarine wires under the auspices      of the \"Compagnie Francaise du Telegraph de Paris a New York.\"    48. _Vide_ Vol. II. p 91, note 176.    49. The Horsefoot-crab, _Limulus polyphemus_. Champlain gives the Indian      name, _siguenoc_. Hariot saw, while at Roanoke Island, in 1585, and      described the same crustacean under the name of _seekanauk_. The Indian      word is obviously the same, the differing French and English      orthography representing the same sound. It thus appears that this      shell-fish was at that time known by the aborigines under the same name      for at least a thousand miles along the Atlantic coast, from the      Kennebec, in Maine, to Roanoke Island, in North Carolina. _Vide      Hariot's Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia_,      Hakluyt, Vol. III. p. 334. See also Vol. II. of this work, notes 171,      172, 173, for some account of the black skimmer and the wild turkey.          CHAPTER IV.

On the 8th of August, the exploring party reached St. Croix. During their  absence, Pont Grave had arrived from France with additional men and  provisions for the colony. As no satisfactory site had been found by De  Monts in his recent tour along the coast, it was determined to remove the  colony temporarily to Port Royal, situated within the bay now known as  Annapolis Basin. The buildings at St. Croix, with the exception of the  store-house, were taken down and transported to the bay. Champlain and Pont  Grave were sent forward to select a place for the settlement, which was  fixed on the north side of the basin, directly opposite to Goat Island,  near or upon the "]]]
