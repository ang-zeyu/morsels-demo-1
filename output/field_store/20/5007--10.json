[8] _But three birds, besides a stray feather or two, are so far known  from the Eocene of North America. One of these is a fowl not very unlike  some of the small curassows of South America; another is a little bird,  supposed to be related to the sparrows, while the third is a large bird  of uncertain relationships._    Several eggs, too--or, rather, casts of eggs--have lately been found in  the Cretaceous and Miocene strata of the West; and, as eggs and birds  are usually associated, we are liable at any time to come upon the bones  of the birds that laid them.    To the writer's mind no thoroughly satisfactory explanation has been  given for the scarcity of bird remains; but the reason commonly advanced  is that, owing to their lightness, dead birds float for a much longer  time than other animals, and hence are more exposed to the ravages of  the weather and the attacks of carrion-feeding animals. It has also been  said that the power of flight enabled birds to escape calamities that  caused the death of contemporary animals; but all birds do not fly; and  birds do fall victims to storms, cold, and starvation, and even perish  of pestilence, like the Cormorants of Bering Island, whose ranks have  twice been decimated by disease.    It is true that where carnivorous animals abound, dead birds do  disappear quickly; and my friend Dr. Stejneger tells me that, while  hundreds of dead sea-fowl are cast on the shores of the Commander  Islands, it is a rare thing to find one after daylight, as the bodies  are devoured by the Arctic foxes that prowl about the shores at night.  But, again, as in the Miocene of Southern France and in the Pliocene of  Oregon, remains of birds are fairly numerous, showing that, under proper  conditions, their bones are preserved for future reference, so that we  may hope some day to come upon specimens that will enable us to round  out the history of bird life in the past.      _REFERENCES_    _The first discovered specimen of Archaeopteryx, Archaeopteryx macrura, is  in the British Museum, the second more complete example is in the Royal  Museum of Natural History, Berlin.

Our acquaintance with the Dinosaurs is comparatively recent, dating from  the early part of the nineteenth century, and in America, at least, the  date may be set at 1818, when the first Dinosaur remains were found in  the Valley of the Connecticut, although they naturally were not  recognized as such, nor had the term been devised. The first Dinosaur  to be formally recognized as representing quite a new order of reptiles  was the carnivorous Megalosaur, found near Oxford, England, in 1824.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.--Thespesius. A Common Herbivorous Dinosaur of  the Cretaceous. _From a drawing by Charles R. Knight._]    For a long time our knowledge of Dinosaurs was very imperfect and  literally fragmentary, depending mostly upon scattered teeth, isolated  vertebrae, or fragments of bone picked up on the surface or casually  encountered in some mine or quarry. Now, however, thanks mainly to the  labors of American palaeontologists, thanks also to the rich deposits of  fossils in our Western States, we have an extensive knowledge of the  Dinosaurs, of their size, structure, habits, and general appearance.    There are to-day no animals living that are closely related to them;  none have lived for a long period of time, for the Dinosaurs came to an  end in the Cretaceous, and it can only be said that the crocodiles, on  the one hand, and the ostriches, on the other, are the nearest existing  relatives of these great reptiles.    For, though so different in outward appearance, birds and reptiles are  structurally quite closely allied, and the creeping snake and the bird  on which it preys are relatives, although any intimate relationship  between them is of the serpent's making, and is strongly objected to by  the bird.    But if we compare the skeleton of a Dinosaur with that of an ostrich--a  young one is preferable--and with those of the earlier birds, we shall  find that many of the barriers now existing between reptiles and birds  are broken down, and that they have many points in common. In fact, save  in the matter of clothes, wherein birds differ from all other animals,  the two great groups are not so very far apart.    The Dinosaurs were by no means confined to North America, although the  western United States seem to have been their headquarters, but ranged  pretty much over the world, for their remains have been found in every  continent, even in far-off New Zealand.    In point of time they ranged from the Trias to the Upper Cretaceous,  their golden age, marking the culminating point of reptilian life, being  in the Jurassic, when huge forms stalked by the sea-shore, browsed amid  the swamps, or disported themselves along the reedy margins of lakes  and rivers.    They had their day, a day of many thousand years, and then passed away,  giving place to the superior race of mammals which was just springing  into being when the huge Dinosaurs were in the heyday of their  existence.    And it does seem as if in the dim and distant past, as in the present,  brains were a potent factor in the struggle for supremacy; for, though  these reptiles were giants in size, dominating the earth through mere  brute force, they were dwarfs in intellect.    The smallest human brain that is thought to be compatible with life  itself weighs a little over ten ounces, the smallest that can exist with  reasoning powers is two pounds; this in a creature weighing from 120 to  150 pounds.    What do we find among Dinosaurs? Thespesius, or Claosaurus, which may  have walked where Baltimore now stands, was twenty-five feet in length  and stood a dozen feet high in his bare feet, had a brain smaller than a  man's clenched fist, weighing less than one pound.    Brontosaurus, in some respects the biggest brute that ever walked, was  but little better off, and Triceratops, and his relatives, creatures  having twice the bulk of an elephant, weighing probably over ten tons,  possessed a brain weighing not over two pounds!    How much of what we term intelligence could such a creature  possess--what was the extent of its reasoning powers? Judging from our  own standpoint and the small amount of intellect apparent in some humans  with much larger brains, these big reptiles must have known just about  enough to have eaten when they were hungry, anything more was  superfluous.    However, intelligence is one thing, life another, and the spinal cord,  with its supply of nerve-substance, doubtless looked after the mere  mechanical functions of life; and while even the spinal cord is in many  cases quite small, in some places, particularly in the sacral region, it  is subject to considerable enlargement. This is notably true of  Stegosaurus, where the sacral enlargement is twenty times the bulk of  the puny brain--a fact noted by Professor Marsh, and seized upon by the  newspapers, which announced that he had discovered a Dinosaur with a  brain in its pelvis.    In their great variety of size and shape the Dinosaurs form an  interesting parallel with the Marsupials of Australia. For just as these  are, as it were, an epitome of the class of mammals, mimicking the  herbivores, carnivores, rodents and even monkeys, so there are  carnivorous and herbivorous Dinosaurs--Dinosaurs that dwelt on land and  others that habitually resided in the water, those that walked upright  and those that crawled about on all fours; and, while there are no hints  that any possessed the power of flight, some members of the group are  very bird-like in form and structure, so much so that it has been  thought that the two may have had a common ancestry.    The smallest of the Dinosaurs whose acquaintance we have made were  little larger than chickens; the largest claim the distinction of being  the largest known quadrupeds that have walked the face of the earth, the  giants not only of their day, but of all time, before whose huge frames  the bones of the Mammoth, that familiar byword for all things great,  seem slight.    For Brontosaurus, the Thunder Lizard, beneath whose mighty tread the  earth shook, and his kindred were from 40 to 60 feet long and 10 to 14  feet high, their thigh bones measuring 5 to 6"]]]
