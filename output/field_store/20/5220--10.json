We had already seen  this conglomerate near the Rio Guayguaza. By a singular disposition of  the ground the port resembles a basin or a little inland lake, the  southern extremity of which is filled with little islands covered with  mangroves. The opening of the port towards the west contributes much  to the smoothness of the water.* (* It is disputed at Porto Cabello  whether the port takes its name from the tranquillity of its waters,  \"which would not move a hair (cabello),\" or (which is more probable)  derived from Antonio Cabello, one of the fishermen with whom the  smugglers of Curacoa had formed a connexion at the period when the  first hamlet was constructed on this half-desert coast.) One vessel  only can enter at a time; but the largest ships of the line can anchor  very near land to take in water. There is no other danger in entering  the harbour than the reefs of Punta Brava, opposite which a battery of  eight guns has been erected. Towards the west and south-west we see  the fort, which is a regular pentagon with five bastions, the battery  of the reef, and the fortifications that surround the ancient town,  founded on an island of a trapezoidal form. A bridge and the fortified  gate of the Staccado join the old to the new town; the latter is  already larger than the former, though considered only as its suburb.  The bottom of the basin or lake which forms the harbour of Porto  Cabello, turns behind this suburb to the south-west. It is a marshy  ground filled with noisome and stagnant water. The town, which has at  present nearly nine thousand inhabitants, owes its origin to an  illicit commerce, attracted to these shores by the proximity of the  town of Burburata, which was founded in 1549. It is only since the  administration of the Biscayans, and of the company of Guipuzcoa, that  Porto Cabello, which was but a hamlet, has been converted into a  well-fortified town. The vessels of La Guayra, which is less a port  than a bad open roadstead, come to Porto Cabello to be caulked and  repaired.    The real defence of the harbour consists in the low batteries on the  neck of land at Punta Brava, and on the reef; but from ignorance of  this principle, a new fort, the Mirador of Solano* has been  constructed at a great expense, on the mountains commanding the suburb  towards the south. (* The Mirador is situate eastward of the Vigia  Alta, and south-east of the battery of the salt-works and the  powder-mill.) More than ten thousand mules are annually exported from  Porto Cabello. It is curious enough to see these animals embarked;  they are thrown down with ropes, and then hoisted on board the vessels  by means of a machine resembling a crane. Ranged in two files, the  mules with difficulty keep their footing during the rolling and  pitching of the ship; and in order to frighten and render them more  docile, a drum is beaten during a great part of the day and night. We  may guess what quiet a passenger enjoys, who has the courage to embark  for Jamaica in a schooner laden with mules.    We left Porto Cabello on the first of March, at sunrise. We saw with  surprise the great number of boats that were laden with fruit to be  sold at the market. It reminded me of a fine morning at Venice. The  town presents in general, on the side towards the sea, a cheerful and  agreeable aspect. Mountains covered with vegetation, and crowned with  peaks called Las Tetas de Ilaria, which, from their outline would be  taken for rocks of a trap-formation, form the background of the  landscape. Near the coast all is bare, white, and strongly illumined,  while the screen of mountains is clothed with trees of thick foliage  that project their vast shadows upon the brown and rocky ground. On  going out of the town we visited an aqueduct that had been just  finished. It is five thousand varas long, and conveys the waters of  the Rio Estevan by a trench to the town. This work has cost more than  thirty thousand piastres; but its waters gush out in every street.    We returned from Porto Cabello to the valleys of Aragua, and stopped  at the Farm of Barbula, near which, a new road to Valencia is in the  course of construction. We had heard, several weeks before, of a tree,  the sap of which is a nourishing milk. It is called the cow-tree; and  we were assured that the negroes of the farm, who drink plentifully of  this vegetable milk, consider it a wholesome aliment. All the milky  juices of plants being acrid, bitter, and more or less poisonous, this  account appeared to us very extraordinary; but we found by experience  during our stay at Barbula, that the virtues of this tree had not been  exaggerated. This fine tree rises like the broad-leaved star-apple.*  (* Chrysophyllum cainito.) Its oblong and pointed leaves, rough and  alternate, are marked by lateral ribs, prominent at the lower surface,  and parallel. Some of them are ten inches long. We did not see the  flower: the fruit is somewhat fleshy, and contains one and sometimes  two nuts. When incisions are made in the trunk of this tree, it yields  abundance of a glutinous milk, tolerably thick, devoid of all  acridity, and of an agreeable and balmy smell. It was offered to us in  the shell of a calabash. We drank considerable quantities of it in the  evening before we went to bed, and very early in the morning, without  feeling the least injurious effect. The viscosity of this milk alone  renders it a little disagreeable. The negroes and the free people who  work in the plantations drink it, dipping into it their bread of maize  or cassava. The overseer of the farm told us that the negroes grow  sensibly fatter during the season when the palo de vaca furnishes them  with most milk. This juice, exposed to the air, presents at its  surface (perhaps in consequence of the absorption of the atmospheric  oxygen) membranes of a strongly animalized substance, yellowish,  stringy, and resembling cheese. These membranes, separated from the  rest of the more aqueous liquid, are elastic, almost like caoutchouc;  but they undergo, in time, the same phenomena of putrefaction as  gelatine. The people call the coagulum that separates by the contact  of the air, cheese. This coagulum grows sour in the space of five or  six days, as I observed in the small portions which I carried to Nueva  Valencia. The milk contained in a stopped phial, had deposited a  little coagulum; and, far from becoming fetid, it exhaled constantly a  balsamic odour. The fresh juice mixed with cold water was scarcely  coagulated at all; but on the contact of nitric acid the separation of  the viscous membranes took place. We sent two bottles of this milk to  M. Fourcroy at Paris: in one it was in its natural state, and in the  other, mixed with a certain quantity of carbonate of soda. The French  consul residing in the island of St. Thomas, undertook to convey them  to him.    The extraordinary tree of which we have been speaking appears to be  peculiar to the Cordillera of the coast, particularly from Barbula to  the lake of Maracaybo. Some stocks of it exist near the village of San  Mateo; and, according to M. Bredemeyer, whose travels have so much  enriched the fine conservatories of Schonbrunn and Vienna, in the  valley of Caucagua, three days journey east of Caracas. This  naturalist found, like us, that the vegetable milk of the palo de vaco  had an agreeable taste and an aromatic smell. At Caucagua, the natives  call the tree that furnishes this nourishing juice, the milk-tree  (arbol del leche). They profess to recognize, from the thickness and  colour of the foliage, the trunks that yield the most juice; as the  herdsman distinguishes, from external signs, a good milch-cow. No  botanist has hitherto known the existence of this plant. It seems,  according to M. Kunth, to belong to the sapota family. Long after my  return to Europe, I found in the Description of the East Indies by  Laet, a Dutch traveller, a passage that seems to have some relation to  the cow-tree. \"There exist trees,\" says Laet,* \"in the province of  Cumana, the sap of which much resembles curdled milk, and affords a  salubrious nourishment.\" (* \"Inter arbores quae sponte hic passim  nascuntur, memorantur a scriptoribus Hispanis quaedam quae lacteum  quemdam liquorem fundunt, qui durus admodum evadit instar gummi, et  suavem odorem de se fundit; aliae quae liquorem quemdam edunt, instar  lactis coagulati, qui in cibis ab ipsis usurpatur sine noxa.\" (Among  the trees growing here, it is remarked by Spanish writers that there  are some which pour out a milky juice which soon grows solid, like  gum, affording a pleasant odour; and also others that give out a  liquid which coagulates like cheese, and which they eat at meals  without any ill effects). Descriptio Indiarum Occidentalium, lib. 18.)    Amidst the great number of curious phenomena which I have observed in  the course of my travels, I confess there are few that have made so  powerful an impression on me as the aspect of the cow-tree. Whatever  relates to milk or to corn, inspires an interest which is not merely  that of the physical knowledge of things, but is connected with  another order of ideas and sentiments. We can scarcely conceive how  the human race could exist without farinaceous substances, and without  that nourishing juice which the breast of the mother contains, and  which is appropriated to the long feebleness of the infant. The  amylaceous matter of corn, the object of religious veneration among so  many nations, ancient and modern, is diffused in the seeds, and  deposited in the roots of vegetables; milk, which serves as an  aliment, appears to us exclusively the produce of animal organization.  Such are the impressions we have received in our earliest infancy:  such is also the source of that astonishment created by the aspect of  the tree just described.

In  her attempts to escape, the poor young woman threw herself from the horse  on which they had placed her, and in so doing wrenched her side. They  then laid her double over the pummel of the saddle, and transported her  through the mosses and moors till the pain of the injury she had suffered  in her side, augmented by the uneasiness of her posture, made her consent  to sit upright. In the execution of this crime they stopped at more  houses than one, but none of the inhabitants dared interrupt their  proceedings. Amongst others who saw them was that classical and  accomplished scholar the late Professor William Richardson of Glasgow,  who used to describe as a terrible dream their violent and noisy entrance  into the house where he was then residing. The Highlanders filled the  little kitchen, brandishing their arms, demanding what they pleased, and  receiving whatever they demanded. James Mhor, he said, was a tall, stern,  and soldier-like man. Robin Oig looked more gentle; dark, but yet ruddy  in complexion--a good-looking young savage. Their victim was so  dishevelled in her dress, and forlorn in her appearance and demeanour,  that he could hardly tell whether she was alive or dead.    The gang carried the unfortunate woman to Rowardennan, where they had a  priest unscrupulous enough to read the marriage service, while James Mhor  forcibly held the bride up before him; and the priest declared the couple  man and wife, even while she protested against the infamy of his conduct.  Under the same threats of violence, which had been all along used to  enforce their scheme, the poor victim was compelled to reside with the  pretended husband who was thus forced upon her. They even dared to carry  her to the public church of Balquhidder, where the officiating clergyman  (the same who had been Rob Roy's pensioner) only asked them if they were  married persons. Robert MacGregor answered in the affirmative; the  terrified female was silent.    The country was now too effectually subjected to the law for this vile  outrage to be followed by the advantages proposed by the actors, Military  parties were sent out in every direction to seize the MacGregors, who  were for two or three weeks compelled to shift from one place to another  in the mountains, bearing the unfortunate Jean Key along with them. In  the meanwhile, the Supreme Civil Court issued a warrant, sequestrating  the property of Jean Key, or Wright, which removed out of the reach of  the actors in the violence the prize which they expected. They had,  however, adopted a belief of the poor woman's spirit being so far broken  that she would prefer submitting to her condition, and adhering to Robin  Oig as her husband, rather than incur the disgrace, of appearing in such  a cause in an open court. It was, indeed, a delicate experiment; but  their kinsman Glengyle, chief of their immediate family, was of a temper  averse to lawless proceedings;* and the captive's friends having had  recourse to his advice, they feared that he would withdraw his protection  if they refused to place the prisoner at liberty.    * Such, at least, was his general character; for when James Mhor, while  perpetrating the violence at Edinbilly, called out, in order to overawe  opposition, that Glengyle was lying in the moor with a hundred men to  patronise his enterprise, Jean Key told him he lied, since she was  confident Glengyle would never countenance so scoundrelly a business.    The brethren resolved, therefore, to liberate the unhappy woman, but  previously had recourse to every measure which should oblige her, either  from fear or otherwise, to own her marriage with Robin Oig. The  cailliachs (old Highland hags) administered drugs, which were designed to  have the effect of philtres, but were probably deleterious. James Mhor at  one time threatened, that if she did not acquiesce in the match she would  find that there were enough of men in the Highlands to bring the heads of  two of her uncles who were pursuing the civil lawsuit. At another time he  fell down on his knees, and confessed he had been accessory to wronging  her, but begged she would not ruin his innocent wife and large family.  She was made to swear she would not prosecute the brethren for the  offence they had committed; and she was obliged by threats to subscribe  papers which were tendered to her, intimating that she was carried off in  consequence of her own previous request.    James Mhor Drummond accordingly brought his pretended sister-in-law to  Edinburgh, where, for some little time, she was carried about from one  house to another, watched by those with whom she was lodged, and never  permitted to go out alone, or even to approach the window. The Court of  Session, considering the peculiarity of the case, and regarding Jean Key  as being still under some forcible restraint, took her person under their  own special charge, and appointed her to reside in the family of Mr.  Wightman of Mauldsley, a gentleman of respectability, who was married to  one of her near relatives. Two sentinels kept guard on the house day and  night--a precaution not deemed superfluous when the MacGregors were in  question. She was allowed to go out whenever she chose, and to see  whomsoever she had a mind, as well as the men of law employed in the  civil suit on either side. When she first came to Mr. Wightman's house  she seemed broken down with affright and suffering, so changed in  features that her mother hardly knew her, and so shaken in mind that she  scarce could recognise her parent. It was long before she could be  assured that she was in perfect safely. But when she at length received  confidence in her situation, she made a judicial declaration, or  affidavit, telling the full history of her wrongs, imputing to fear her  former silence on the subject, and expressing her resolution not to  prosecute those who had injured her, in respect of the oath she had been  compelled to take. From the possible breach of such an oath, though a  compulsory one, she was relieved by the forms of Scottish jurisprudence,  in that respect more equitable than those of England, prosecutions for  crimes being always conducted at the expense and charge of the King,  without inconvenience or cost to the private party who has sustained the  wrong. But the unhappy sufferer did not live to be either accuser or  witness against those who had so deeply injured her.    James Mhor Drummond had left Edinburgh so soon as his half-dead prey had  been taken from his clutches. Mrs. Key, or Wright, was released from her  species of confinement there, and removed to Glasgow, under the escort of  Mr. Wightman. As they passed the Hill of Shotts, her escort chanced to  say, \"this is a very wild spot; what if the MacGregors should come upon  us?\"--\"God forbid!\" was her immediate answer, \"the very sight of them  would kill me.\" She continued to reside at Glasgow, without venturing to  return to her own house at Edinbilly. Her pretended husband made some  attempts to obtain an interview with her, which she steadily rejected.  She died on the 4th October 1751. The information for the Crown hints  that her decease might be the consequence of the usage she received. But  there is a general report that she died of the small-pox. In the  meantime, James Mhor, or Drummond, fell into the hands of justice. He was  considered as the instigator of the whole affair. Nay, the deceased had  informed her friends that on the night of her being carried off, Robin  Oig, moved by her cries and tears, had partly consented to let her  return, when James came up with a pistol in his hand, and, asking whether  he was such a coward as to relinquish an enterprise in which he had  risked everything to procure him a fortune, in a manner compelled his  brother to persevere. James's trial took place on 13th July 1752, and was  conducted with the utmost fairness and impartiality. Several witnesses,  all of the MacGregor family, swore that the marriage was performed with  every appearance of acquiescence on the woman's part; and three or four  witnesses, one of them sheriff-substitute of the county, swore she might  have made her escape if she wished, and the magistrate stated that he  offered her assistance if she felt desirous to do so. But when asked why  he, in his official capacity, did not arrest the MacGregors, he could  only answer, that he had not force sufficient to make the attempt.    The judicial declarations of Jean Key, or Wright, stated the violent  manner in which she had been carried off, and they were confirmed by many  of her friends, from her private communications with them, which the  event of her death rendered good evidence. Indeed, the fact of her  abduction (to use a Scottish law term) was completely proved by impartial  witnesses. The unhappy woman admitted that she had pretended acquiescence  in her fate on several occasions, because she dared not trust such as  offered to assist her to escape, not even the sheriff-substitute.    The jury brought in a special verdict, finding that Jean Key, or Wright,  had been forcibly carried off from her house, as charged in the  indictment, and that the accused had failed to show that she was herself  privy and consenting to this act of outrage. But they found the forcible  marriage, and subsequent violence, was not proved; and also found, in  alleviation of the panel's guilt in the premises, that Jean Key did  afterwards acquiesce in her condition.
