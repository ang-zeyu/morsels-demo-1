Aurelio was a good miniaturist, and in the same  branch Gaspero, a son of Tiburzio, also met with success. In the works of  Bartolommeo we often meet with a sparrow, the symbol of his own name; a  custom derived from the ancients, and followed by many of our own artists.  It is a well-known fact relating to two sculptors, Batraco and Sauro, that  for their proper names they substituted, the former a frog, and the latter  a lizard.         Footnote 13: This worthy writer would appear to have been       aware that he sometimes exceeded due bounds. In the course       of that work we meet with other expressions highly       creditable to Vasari; and it is well known, that having       spoken contemptuously of Raffaello, by designating him       _boccalaio Urbinate_, the potter of Urbino, because some       vases there had been painted from his designs, \"he repented       of the expression so much as to lead him to erase it from as       many copies of the work as he could meet with.\" _Lett.       Pitt._ vol. vii. p. 130.    Dionisio Calvart, born at Antwerp, and hence also called Dionisio the  Fleming, came, when young, into Bologna, and displayed some ability in  landscape painting. In order to become a figure painter, he entered first  the school of Fontana, and next that of Sabbatini, whom he greatly assisted  in his labours for the Vatican. But after quitting also this master, and  occupying himself, some little time, in designing from Raffaello's  pictures, he returned to Bologna, opened a studio, and there educated as  many as a hundred and thirty-seven masters in the art, some of whom were  excellent. He was a fine artist for his age; understood perspective well,  which he acquired from Fontana, and designed both correctly and gracefully  in the taste of Sabbatini. He moreover possessed the art of colouring, in  the taste of his own countrymen, a quality which induced the Bolognese to  regard him as a restorer of their school, which in this branch of painting  had declined. If there were some degree of mannerism in his style, some  action in his figures too little dignified, or too extravagant; the former  was the fault of his age, and the latter of his temperament, which is  described as extremely restless and violent. Notwithstanding, he instructed  his pupils with assiduous care, and from the cartoons of the most  celebrated inventors he gave them lectures in the art. Different  collections abound with his small pictures, painted chiefly on copper,  representing incidents from the Gospel, which attract by the abundance of  the figures, by their spirit, and by the lusciousness of their tints.  Similar commissions in this line were then very frequently given in  Bologna; most times proceeding from the noviciate nuns, who were in the  habit of carrying with them into the cloister similar little paintings to  decorate their lonely cells; and Calvart provided abundance of them, with  the assistance of his young men, whose pieces he retouched; and they  obtained immense circulation both in Italy and Flanders. In particular  those conducted by Albano and Guido, his two pupils, boast the most  attractive graces, and may be known by a certain superior decision,  knowledge, and facility. In the list of his altar-pieces, the S. Michele,  at S. Petronio, and the Purgatory, at the Grazie, bear the palm; and from  these, as well as others, the best disciples of the Caracci confessed the  assistance which they received.    On the rise of the new Bolognese School, the pupils of Calvart for the most  part changed their manner, attaching themselves some to one master, and  some to another. Those who preserved most evident traces of their former  education, in other words, who continued more feeble and less natural than  the Caracceschi, were but few. Malvasia enumerates Gio. Batista Bertusio in  this list, who vainly aspired at resembling Guido, leaving a variety of  paintings both at Bologna and its villages, displaying beauties more  apparent than real. Two other artists, Pier Maria da Crevalcore, a painter  in oil, and Gabriel Ferrantini, known by his frescos, called also Gabriel  degli Occhiali, seem both to have seen, and attempted to imitate the  Caracci. Emilio Savonanzi, a Bolognese noble, attached himself to the art  when nearly arrived at manhood, but he attended Cremonini more than  Calvart; and strongly addicted to changing masters, entered the school of  Lodovico Caracci, next that of Guido at Bologna, of Guercino at Cento, and  finally the studio of Algardi, an excellent sculptor at Rome. By such means  he became a good theorist and an able lecturer, applauded in every  particular of his art; nor was he wanting in good practice, uniting many  styles in one, in which however that of Guido most prevails. Still he was  not equally correct in all his pieces, even betraying feebleness of touch,  and not scrupling to denominate himself an artist of many hands. He resided  at Ancona, next at Camerino, at which places, as well as in the adjacent  districts, he left a variety of works. Of another Bolognese, who flourished  at the same period, there remains at Ancona a picture of the offering of  the Infant Jesus at the Temple, ornamenting the larger altar of S. Jacopo.  The inscription shews him to have resided at Brescia, _F. Tiburtius  Baldinus Bononiensis F. Brixiae_, 1611. This date proves him to have  belonged to the present epoch. His taste, from what I am informed by Sig.  Cav. Boni, extremely well informed on subjects of the fine arts, reminds us  of the excellent school that flourished in 1500: magnificence in the  architecture, great copiousness of composition, and clearness of effect,  except that in the general tone of his tints, and in his fleshes, he is  somewhat cold. One artist there was, who declared that he had laid down for  himself a maxim, never to alter with other styles that of Calvart; and this  was Vincenzo Spisano, called likewise Spisanelli. He however is inferior in  solidity and truth of design, and displays quite as much caprice and  mannerism as any of the practitioners of his time. Nor does he always  preserve the colours peculiar to his school; but deadens them with a leaden  hue, which is still not unpleasing. His altar-pieces, executed at Bologna,  and in the neighbouring cities, are less celebrated than his small pictures  for private ornament, which abound in Bologna, and which he was in the  habit of enlivening with very attractive landscape. It has already been  observed that those who were mannerists in their style, like Zuccaro and  Cesari, always when working on a small scale, improved upon themselves.    Bartolommeo Cesi fills the rank also of head of a school, among those who  cleared the path to the good method pursued by the disciples of the  Caracci. From him Tiarini acquired the art of painting fresco, and his  works gave the first impulse to Guido in attaining to his sweet and  graceful manner. On examining a work by Cesi, it sometimes seems doubtful  whether it may not have been that of Guido when young. He dares little,  copies every thing from nature, selects fine forms of each period of life,  and makes sparing use of the ideal; his lines and folds are few, his  attitudes measured, and his tints more beautiful than strong. He has some  paintings at San Jacopo, and at San Martino, which are extremely pleasing;  and it is said that Guido, during his early youth, was in the habit of  sitting to contemplate them sometimes for hours. His frescos, perhaps,  display more power, where he has introduced many copious histories with  great judgment, variety, and mastery; and such are those of AEneas, in the  Favi palace. His Arch of Forli, painted for Clement VIII., with different  exploits, surprises us even more. Though exposed to the action of the open  air, during so many years, this piece retains the vividness of its tints to  a surprising degree. Malvasia's opinion, in commendation of this artist, is  very remarkable, that he had a manner which at once satisfies, pleases, and  enamours the beholder, as truly exquisite and sweet as any style of the  best Tuscan masters in fresco. In the larger chapel of the Bolognese  monastery of Carthusians, there are distinguished examples in both kinds of  painting; and the describer of the Carthusian monastery, in his account of  them, likewise enumerates Cesi's works for other monasteries of the same  order, those of Ferrara, of Florence, and Siena. He was held in esteem by  the Caracci, and very generally so by the different professors, no less for  the candour of his character, than for his love of the art. To his efforts  it was chiefly owing that the company of painters, in 1595, obtained a  separation from the artificers of swords, of saddles, and of scabbards,  with all of whom they had for centuries been united in the same  corporation, and that a new one being formed of painters and of cotton  manufacturers,[14] it not being possible wholly to exclude the latter, they  were to rank inferior to the artists, or, to use the words of Malvasia,  \"that they should condescend to furnish to the amount of two hundred, or  more, crowns, rich purple cloaks to decorate the wearer of the laurel  crown, preceding their vice steward.\"[15]         Footnote 14: In the original the term used for these cotton       merchants is _bambagiai_.         Footnote 15: In the Italian called _promassaro_.    Cesare Aretusi, a son, perhaps, of Pellegrino Munari,[16] was distinguished  as a colourist in the Venetian taste, but in point of invention weak and  dull; while Gio. Batista Fiorini, on the other hand, was full of fine  conceptions but worthless in his colouring.
