[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7300"],[0,"Woman and the Republic (#12)"],[1," claim that organized  military duty is really practicable for them. And the suffrage proposition  does not look to anything of the kind. The Suffragists demand equal vote  in sending their fathers, brothers, sons, husbands, and lovers to the  military field of action, and propose to be absolutely exempt from equal  share in the duty that that vote now lays upon male voters. Before the law  there could be no distinction of duty on account of race, sex, or previous  condition of servitude. The \"emancipated\" woman would be emancipated into  that which the Declaration of Independence expressly called for, \"the  right and privilege of the people to bear arms.\"    The constitution of Utah says that the State militia is to consist of  \"able-bodied males,\" and I have not yet heard that the women who vote  there have insisted that the word \"male\" be struck out of that clause of  the Constitution. By no means, every woman expects to be exempt. After  women had succeeded in getting the framers of the constitution of every  State to strike out the word \"male,\" from its voting qualification, they  would expect them to insert the word \"male\" in mentioning the service  qualification. O Equality, where is thine equal for granting privilege!  Such chivalry, it would seem, is an insult to the power and intelligence  of the women of Utah, who celebrated their \"enfranchisement\" by a  convention to favor the free coinage of silver, 16 to 1, and whose  behavior on that occasion was, to say the least, boyish. The tax upon time  and strength, and the money loss of citizen service, Suffrage leaders did  not once allude to. They did not, and do not, propose to pay even a double  money tax on account of expected exemption. Little as this would have  availed to meet the actual situation, it would have shown their good will,  and some comprehension of justice, while they talked of an absurd and  intangible \"right.\"    But, it might be said, \"Utah did insert such a clause into her  constitution, and so could other States. It is, after all, common sense  that rules, and men can legislate what they please.\" The law passed by  Utah, which provided that \"male voters must be tax-payers, while female  voters need not be,\" was decided to be unconstitutional, and this one also  may well be. At the end of Utah's Constitution, as of every other, and of  every bill that is passed, occurs or is understood something like this  sentence from the United States Constitution: \"The Congress shall have  power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\" Is it the  \"appropriate legislation\" that gives to Congress, or to any other body,  the power to enforce the article decided upon by a majority? We know that  it is not. It is the men who can enforce it if it is disobeyed. Every day  we see that some laws are \"dead letters,\" not because the legislation  appropriate to their enforcement was not perfect, but because they are not  enforced. When Mr. Roosevelt became Chairman of the Police Commission  there had been for some time a bill, duly legislated, for the enforcement  of the Sunday closing of liquor saloons in New York city. But the saloons  had not been closed. Mr. Roosevelt summoned the police, and proceeded to  enforce the law. If they had refused, the militia stood behind them. Do  you say, \"Very well, if Miss Willard had been Chairman of the  Commissioners she could have done the same.\" There would have been this  great difference. Mr. Roosevelt himself was as much subject to serve at  the call of the law, as were the policemen. He was not a dictator merely,  he was part and parcel of the strength that he invoked. The reason for  obedience rested on the same ground in each case--service in which each  stood equal. It is a specious form of mistake to suppose that \"men can  legislate just what they wish to.\" They can legislate only what the  majority decrees, and they can legislate effectively only what they have  power to enforce. Had the saloon-keepers refused to obey Miss Willard, not  she, but Mr. Roosevelt and other men would have had to enforce the law.    It is absurd in itself, and annoying to Suffrage advocates, to talk about  military duty for woman. Her very nature forbids it. So it is, and so it  does, and therefore it is equally absurd to talk about her attempting to  assume duties whose very nature forbids their being done by her. Were  voting only a matter of obtaining the _opinion_ of women on matters that  concern the country, or concern them (and all matters that concern the  country concern them), all precedent gathered from the treatment of  American women by American men goes to prove that no urging would have  been required to secure for them as large a measure of suffrage as was  consistent with their duties and their desires.    In 1879 an earnest discussion on Woman Suffrage was held in the  legislature of Massachusetts. Four propositions were pending. The first  was that a constitutional amendment should be submitted to the people,  which, if accepted, would decree to women full suffrage. Thomas Wentworth  Higginson, Lucy Stone and William Lloyd Garrison argued the case for the  women. Col. Higginson said that if ability to fight were made the test of  voting \"a large proportion of men, especially of professional men, would  be disfranchised. The report of the Surgeon-General of the United States  showed that of the thousand clergymen who volunteered or were drafted  during the war, 945 were declared to be unfit for service. Of the lawyers  who volunteered or were drafted, 650 were rejected, and of the physicians,  745.\" He added, \"You must go down to the mechanics and laborers before you  can find a class of men a majority of whom will fulfil this requirement.  Of the clergymen who preach that woman suffrage is wrong because women can  do no military duty, only one twentieth would themselves be accepted for  such service. There is but one class of men better fitted than mechanics  for military service, and that is the prize-fighting class, and therefore  the constituency which sent John Morrissey to Congress was the only  constituency that ever carried out this idea to the end.\" Col. Higginson,  who played a gallant part in the Civil War, should have remembered what  poor fighting material the country found in such men as formed the  constituency of John Morrissey. The regiment of Zouaves raised in New York  City by Billy Wilson, the pugilist, was found to be so mischievous, as  well as worthless, that it was shipped to the Dry Tortugas in order to rid  the army of a pest. On the other hand, many of the most gallant as well as  most orderly soldiers came from dry-goods stores and apothecary shops. The  pugilists and roughs are the very ones that are good for nothing as  soldiers; they belong to the class that makes soldiery necessary.    When Col. Higginson can use such logic, it is no wonder that women have  repeated the argument. The question was not whether, because certain men  who were naturally looked upon by the Government as its defenders, and as  such were called upon to fight, proved physically unable, but whether the  Government had a right, because of its very existence, to call upon those  men, and in case of need, to say to them \"Put yourself into physical  condition for this service.\" If it had such a right, by what law under the  constitution of the United States could Lucy Stone ask to vote and not  expect to have her military fitness inquired into, and be asked to put  herself into physical condition for it?    Recalling the action of her grandfather, she, better than some other  women, might have realized the necessity of force for government. Her  defiant spirit might well have descended from that ancestor who led four  hundred men in Shays's Rebellion, when, in the State before whose tribunal  she was speaking, he assisted in preventing court sessions, and swelled  the ranks of the rioters who were decrying taxes and calling for fiat  money, in a land that was impoverished and was struggling for a sound  financial standing after a war that had been waged to guarantee the  blessings of freedom to her and to her children.    As a matter of fact, many of those men whom Col. Higginson referred to as  deemed unfit, did go into immediate training, and \"muscular Christianity\"  would now present to the Surgeon-General a different showing. It was one  of the surprising things, in a statistical way, to find that city-bred  boys stood the marching and exposure of the Civil War campaigns better  than their country brothers, and that the yard-stick turned into as  effective a sword as the pruning-hook. Garrison, who maintained for so  many years that men should not vote because the government was founded on  force, had the grace not to speak on this phase of the question, but he  said it was cruel that women should be disfranchised and classed with  paupers, idiots, and criminals. Senator Hayes asked him if there was no  \"difference between a person who was disfranchised and one who never had  been enfranchised?\" and added that \"he could see no argument for woman  suffrage in the proposition that certain classes of men were not permitted  to vote.\" Neither can I.    The argument for woman suffrage which bases it upon a fancied grouping of  women with the vile and brainless element in the country, appears to me to  be at once the weakest and the meanest of all. When the United States  Government invited its woman citizens to share in making the Columbian  Exposition the most wondrous pageant of any age, they responded from every  town and hamlet by sending of their best. But the national Suffrage  Association, as its official exhibit, gave a picture of the expressive  face of Miss Willard surrounded by ideal heads of a pauper, an idiot, and  a criminal, with a legend recording their belief that it was with these  that American men placed American women.

The Arab necromancer now asked them, in very good Greek, the object of  their visit.    \"We shall not understand much if we are addressed in Greek,\" said  Harkaway; \"try him in Italian.\"    And then they found that the conjurer spoke Italian as well, or better,  than any of the party.    \"Can you tell me,\" said Jack Harkaway, by way of beginning business,  \"if I shall succeed in the present object of my desires or not?\"    The magician bowed his head gravely.    Then he opened a large volume covered with mystic characters.    For a minute or two he appeared to be lost in deep study, and then he  gave his reply.    \"Your desires tend to the downfall of some lawless men, I find,\" he  said, watching them keenly, as if he expected to see them jump up in  surprise at his words.    \"They do.\"    \"And you will not succeed.\"    \"Does your art tell you where I shall fail?\" asked Jack.    \"No; I only see disappointment and trouble for you and yours.\"    \"Dear, dear, how very shocking,\" exclaimed Harkaway, winking at Harvey.    \"Dreadful!\" added Dick, with a terrified look, and putting his tongue  out at the magician.    \"What else does your art tell you?\" demanded Jefferson, who was anxious  to know how far the necromancer would venture to try and humbug them.    \"I see here,\" said the conjurer, drawing his finger along a line of  something on an open \"book of fate,\" that looked like Arabic, \"I see  here that your lives are menaced, one and all, through the keeping of a  wretched man under restraint.\"    The visitors looked at each other and exchanged a smile.    \"Your art is at fault,\" said Jefferson; \"we have no one under  restraint.\"    \"You are in some way connected with it.\"    \"Wrong again.\"    The wizard looked uncomfortable at this.    \"Strange,\" he said, \"and yet I read it here as clearly as you might  yourself if it were written in a book.\"    \"You are mistaken,\" said Jefferson; \"we are in no way concerned in any  thing of the kind.\"    The wizard pored over the mystic tome again.    \"I can say no more then,\" he said, \"for here you are clearly indicated.  You especially are mentioned as being the immediate cause of his  downfall.\"    \"How am I indicated?\" demanded Jefferson.    \"By the letter J.\"    \"Which you take for?\"    \"Your initial.\"    \"Humph! not far out. What an audacious humbug the fellow is,\" said  Jefferson to Jack.    Now, during the foregoing scene, young Jack and Harry Girdwood had  joined the party, and Dick Harvey was observed to be in close  conversation with them.    At this point Harvey turned from the two lads towards Jefferson.    \"The astrologer is right,\" he said, gravely.    \"What the devil do you mean?\" exclaimed Jefferson.    \"You are right, sir,\" added Dick to the magician himself.    The latter bowed.    \"I doubt it not,\" he said; \"the stars do not speak falsely.\"    \"No, no.\"    \"And so you may convince your friend that I say no more nor less than  the truth.\"    \"I can,\" said Dick, in a voice as solemn as that of the necromancer  himself, \"for I am a mesmerist, and I have here with me a clairvoyant  of great power.\"    The conjurer started.    \"Where?\"    \"Here.\"    He held out his hand to young Jack and led him forward.    Harkaway and Jefferson stared again.    \"Hullo!\" ejaculated old Jack; \"what the deuce is madcap Dick up to  now?\"    \"Can't hazard a guess,\" said Jefferson.    \"Mesmerism can not read the future as my art does,\" said the  necromancer.    \"It can,\" said Dick; \"it corroborates all you have said. I'll give you  a proof of it before our friends here.\"    And then, before he could object, Dick made a mesmeric pass or two  across young Jack's face, and immediately it appeared to take effect.    Young Jack's eyes were closed, and for a moment there played about his  mouth a merry smile of mischief, and then he appeared to be in a state  of coma.    Never was mesmerism effected with such little trouble.    \"Now tell me,\" said Dick, with all the tricks of manner of the  professional mesmerist, \"tell me to what this person alludes?\"    \"He speaks of Mathias, the brigand chief.\"    \"True,\" said Dick; \"and will Mathias escape?\"    \"No.\"    \"You hear,\" said Dick, turning towards the necromancer.    \"I do.\"    \"And therefore it is useless to try and effect the liberation of this  Mathias?\"    \"Quite,\" returned young Jack. \"The wizard here is trying all he can  himself, but he will be discovered by the police and thrown into  prison.\"    \"Hah!\" exclaimed Dick, \"do you hear that?\"    \"I do,\" returned the necromancer, \"but it is false.\"    \"It is true,\" said Dick. \"So beware.\"     [Illustration: 'SPEAK,' SAID DICK, MAKING MESMERIC PASSES ACROSS  JACK'S FACE\"--ADV. IN GREECE, VOL. II PAGE 64.]    \"Ask him more,\" said the wizard, eagerly. \"Ask him more.\"    \"What shall I ask?\" demanded Dick.    \"Ask him--yet, mark me, I don't believe a word of it--ask him, for  curiosity, what follows.\"    \"Follows what?\"    \"What he said last.\"    \"You mean what follows being thrown into prison?\" he said,  deliberately.    \"Yes.\"    \"Do you hear?\" said Dick.    \"Yes, master,\" responded young Jack.    \"Speak, then.\"    By this time Harkaway the elder and Jefferson began of course to see  what they were driving at, and they became just as much interested as  the wizard himself in what young Jack was going to say.    \"What follows,\" said young Jack, \"is too dreadful to look at.\"    \"Speak,\" said Dick, with a furious pass across the lad's face. \"Speak,  I command you. What follows?\"    \"I see the wizard hanging by the neck--there,\" and young Jack pointed  straight before him.    The necromancer looked as unhappy as possible when he heard young  Jack's words.    \"Do you know enough,\" asked Dick Harvey, \"or would you learn more yet?\"    The wizard essayed to smile, but it was a sickly attempt, and it died  away in a ghastly manner.    \"I can not believe a word of what you say, but still let him speak on.\"    Dick frowned.    \"If you are a scoffer,\" he said, sternly, \"my clairvoyant will not  speak.\"    \"I am no scoffer,\" returned the necromancer; \"speak on.\"    \"What would you know?\"    \"When is my danger to begin? Let him say that.\"    \"Speak,\" said Dick, making mesmeric passes across Jack's face.    \"He need fear nothing at present,\" said young Jack.    The wizard drew a long breath of relief.    \"The police are below,\" continued young Jack, \"but for ten minutes  there is no danger.\"    \"Ten minutes!\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And after?\" gasped the wizard, breathlessly.    \"Then he is doomed,\" said young Jack, in sepulchral tones. \"The wizard  will be numbered with the dead.\"    Thereupon, the necromancer was taken suddenly queer, and he retreated  with a few confused words of excuse.    \"He's gone,\" said Dick, laughing.    They pushed aside the curtains where the magician had disappeared, and  found that there was a back staircase.    \"There he goes, there he goes!\" cried Harry Girdwood, excitedly.    \"Yes, and he has left his skin,\" said young Jack.    Upon the stairs was the long black velvet robe covered with tin-foil  ornaments, with which the necromancer was wont to frighten the ignorant  and superstitious peasants who came to consult him out of their wits.    \"I'll frighten old Mole with this,\" said young Jack.    \"I don't suppose that they'll try to frighten us again into helping  Mathias, the brigand chief, out of prison,\" said Harkaway, laughing.    \"He shall hang as high as Haman,\" said Jefferson, sternly. \"Of that I  am so determined, that if there were no one else, I would willingly fix  the noose myself. But hang he shall for murdering my poor and noble  friend Brand.\"          CHAPTER X.    THE CONDEMNED CELL--MATHIAS ESCAPED--WHERE HAS HE GONE?--THE  BLOOD ON THE HEARTH--A TALE OF TERROR.      The schemes set on foot by the friends of Mathias for his release were  so many and so unceasing that the greatest precautions had to be taken  to keep him in safety.    Rules were made, and for awhile most rigidly enforced, that not a soul  was to be permitted to visit the prisoner; but the exception proves the  rule, and there was an exception made in favour of a lady who came and  pleaded so earnestly to the governor of the prison that he could not  find the courage to refuse her.    The lady was shown into the cell which Mathias had lately occupied.    Lately? Yes.    The bird had flown.    But how had he got free?    Where had he gone?    Not a soul in the prison had the vaguest notion.    The gaoler stared and gaped like one in a dream.    \"Where is Mathias?\" demanded the woman.    \"That's more than I can guess,\" responded the gaoler, rubbing his eyes  as though he could not believe their evidence.    \"Have you mistaken the cell?\"    \"Not I.\"    \"Has he been removed?\"    \"No.\"    She stared him straight in the face for a moment or two, and then she  burst out into a fit of laughter.    \"Ha, ha, ha! Why, he has escaped. He has escaped. He has beaten your  vigilance--baffled you all in spite of locks, bolts and bars, and all  your watching.\"    The gaoler scratched his head.    \"Let us look.\"    \"Look! why, you can see everything here at a glance--everything. There  are four walls. There is the bedstead; you can see under it. There is  not room for a man to creep under there. There is the fireplace, and  there is the window.\"    \"Ha!\" ejaculated the gaoler, \"the window.\"    \"What then?\"    \"There is no other way; he must have escaped that way, undoubtedly.\"    \"Nonsense,\" said the woman; \"don't you see that is too high up from the  ground.\"    \"He has found a way to climb up there, then.\"    \"But the iron bars are all in their places still.\"    \"True,\" said the gaoler, thoroughly puzzled, \"true. Where can he have  got to?\"    \"It is simple enough.\"    \"How so?\"    \"He never"]]]
