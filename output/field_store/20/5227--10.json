Close upon this  followed (in August, 1837) a proposition to our Government from the  Texan envoy for the annexation of Texas to the United States.  President  Van Buren declined the offer.  The Northern friends of Freedom were as  much opposed to this annexation project as the advocates of Slavery were  anxious for it.  Even such conservative Northern Statesmen as Daniel  Webster strongly opposed the project.  In a speech delivered in New York  [1837], after showing that the chief aim of our Government in the  acquisition of the Territory of Louisiana was to gain command of the  mouths of the great rivers to the sea, and that in the acquisition of  the Floridas our policy was based on similar considerations, Mr. Webster  declared that \"no such necessity, no such policy, requires the  annexation of Texas,\" and that we ought \"for numerous and powerful  reasons to be content with our present boundaries.\"  He recognized that  Slavery already existed under the guarantees of the Constitution and  those guarantees must be fulfilled; that \"Slavery, as it exists in the  States, is beyond the power of Congress.  It is a concern of the States  themselves,\" but \"when we come to speak of admitting new States, the  subject assumes an entirely different aspect.  Our rights and our duties  are then both different.  The Free States, and all the States, are then  at liberty to accept or to reject;\" and he added, \"In my opinion the  people of the United States will not consent to bring into the Union a  new, vastly extensive and Slaveholding country, large enough for a half  a dozen or a dozen States.  In my opinion, they ought not to consent to  it.\"    Farther on, in the same speech--after alluding to the strong feeling in  the Northern States against the extension of Slavery, not only as a  question of politics, but of conscience and religious conviction as  well-he deems him a rash man indeed \"who supposes that a feeling of this  kind is to be trifled with or despised.\"  Said he: \"It will assuredly  cause itself to be respected.  It may be reasoned with; it may be made  willing--I believe it is entirely willing--to fulfill all existing  engagements and all existing duties--to uphold and defend the  Constitution as it is established, with whatever regrets about some  provisions which it does actually contain.  But to coerce it into  silence, to endeavor to restrain its free expression, to seek to  compress and confine it, warm as it is, and more heated as such  endeavors would inevitably render it,--should this be attempted, I know  nothing, even in the Constitution or in the Union itself, which would  not be endangered by the explosion which might follow.\"    In 1840, General Harrison, the Whig candidate, was elected to the  Presidency, but died within a few weeks after his inauguration in 1841,  and was succeeded by John Tyler.  The latter favored the Slave Power;  and on April 12th, 1844, John C.  Calhoun, his Secretary of State,  concluded with Texas a treaty of annexation--which was, however,  rejected by the Senate.  Meanwhile the public mind was greatly agitated  over the annexation and other, questions.         [In the London Index, a journal established there by Jefferson       Davis's agents to support the cause of the rebellious States, a       communication appeared during the early part of the war, Dec.  4,       1861, supposed to have been written by Mr. Mason, of Virginia, in       which he said: \"To tell the Norths, the Butes, the Wedderburns of       the present day, that previous to the year 1839 the sovereign       States of the South had unalterably resolved on the specific ground       of the violation of the Federal Constitution by the tariff of       spoliation which the New England States had imposed upon them--to       secede from the Union; to tell them that in that year the leader of       the South, Calhoun, urged an English gentleman, to whom he had       fully explained the position of the South, and the intolerable       tyranny which the North inflicted upon it, to be the bearer of       credentials from the chief persons of the South, in order to invite       the attention of the British Government to the coming event; that       on his death-bed (Washington, March 31, 1850), he called around him       his political friends--one of whom is now in England--warned them       that in no event could the Union survive the Presidential election       of 1860, though it might possibly break up before that urged them       to be prepared; leaving with his dying words the sacred cause of       Southern secession a solemn legacy in their hands--to have told       this to the Norths and Dartmouths of the present day, with more and       even stronger evidence of the coming events of November, 1860,       would have been like speaking to the stones of the street.  In       November, 1860, they were thoroughly ignorant of all the momentous       antecedents of secession--of their nature, their character, their       bearing, import, and consequences.\"         In the same correspondence the distinguished Rebel emissary       substantially let out the fact that Calhoun was indirectly, through       himself (Mason), in secret communication with the British       Government as far back as 1841, with a view to securing its       powerful aid in his aforesaid unalterable resolve to Secede from       the Union; and then Mr. Mason pleads--but pleads in vain--for the       armed intervention of England at this later day.  Said he:         \"In the year 1841 the late Sir William Napier sent in two plans for       subduing the Union, to the War Office, in the first of which the       South was to be treated as an enemy, in the second as a friend and       ally.  I was much consulted by him as to the second plan and was       referred to by name in it, as he showed by the acknowledgment of       this in Lord Fitzroy Somerset's letter of reply.  This plan fully       provided for the contingency of an invasion of Canada, and its       application would, in eighteen or twenty months, have reduced the       North to a much more impotent condition than it exhibits at       present.  At this very moment the most difficult portion of that       plan has been perfectly accomplished by the South itself; and the       North, in accordance with Sir William Napier's expectations, now       lies helpless before England, and at our absolute mercy.  Nor is       there any doubt of this, and if Lord Palmerston is not aware of it       Mr. Seward certainly is.  We have nothing remaining to do but to       stretch out our arm in the way Sir William Napier proposed, and the       Northern power--power as we ignorantly call it--must come to an       end.  Sir William knew and well estimated the elements of which       that quasi power consisted; and he knew how to apply the       substantive power of England to dissolve it.  In the best interest       of humanity, I venture to say that it is the duty of England to       apply this power without further delay--its duty to itself, to its       starving operatives, to France, to Europe, and to humanity.  And in       the discharge of this great duty to the world at large there will       not even be the dignity of sacrifice or danger.\"]    Threats and counter-threats of Disunion were made on either hand by the  opponents and advocates of Slavery-extension through annexation; nor was  it less agitated on the subject of a Protective Tariff.    The Compromise Tariff of 1833, together with President Jackson's  upheaval of our financial system, produced, as has already been hinted,  terrible commercial disasters. \"In 1840,\" says competent authority, \"all  prices had ruinously fallen; production had greatly diminished, and in  many departments of industry had practically ceased; thousands of  working men were idle, with no hope of employment, and their families  suffering from want.  Our farmers were without markets, their products  rotted in their barns, and their lands, teeming with rich harvests, were  sold by the sheriff for debts and taxes.  The Tariff, which robbed our  industries of Protection failed to supply Government with its necessary  revenues.  The National Treasury in consequence was bankrupt, and the  credit of the Nation had sunk very low.\"    Mr. Clay himself stated \"the average depression in the value of property  under that state of things which existed before the Tariff of 1842 came  to the rescue of the country, at fifty per cent.\"  And hence it was that  Protection was made the chief issue of the Presidential campaign of  1840, which eventuated in the election of Harrison and Tyler, and in the  Tariff Act of August 30, 1842, which revived our trade and industries,  and brought back to the land a full measure of prosperity.  With those  disasters fresh in the minds of the people, Protection continued to be a  leading issue in the succeeding Presidential campaign of 1844--but  coupled with the Texas-annexation issue.  In that campaign Henry Clay  was the candidate of the Whig party and James K. Polk of the Democratic  party.  Polk was an ardent believer in the annexation policy and stood  upon a platform declaring for the \"re-occupation of Oregon and the  re-annexation of Texas at the earliest practicable moment\"--as if the  prefix \"re\" legitimatized the claim in either case; Clay, on the other  hand, held that we had \"fairly alienated our title to Texas by solemn  National compacts, to the fulfilment of which we stand bound by good  faith and National honor;\" that \"Annexation and War with Mexico are  identical,\" and that he was \"not willing to involve this country in a  foreign War for the object of acquiring Texas.\"         [In his letter of April 17, 1844, published in the National       Intelligencer.]    As to the Tariff issue also, Clay was the acknowledged champion of the  American system of Protection, while"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7144"],[0,"While the Billy Boils (#12)"],[1,"\"didn't have one.\"  He volunteered no explanations as to how he expected mother to know the  time, but, perhaps, like many other mites of his kind, he had unbounded  faith in the infinitude of a mother's wisdom. His name was Arvie  Aspinall, please sir, and he lived in Jones's Alley. Father was dead.    A few days later the same paper took great pleasure in stating, in  reference to that \"Touching Incident\" noticed in a recent issue, that  a benevolent society lady had started a subscription among her friends  with the object of purchasing an alarm-clock for the little boy found  asleep at Grinder Bros' workshop door.    Later on, it was mentioned, in connection with the touching incident,  that the alarm-clock had been bought and delivered to the boy's mother,  who appeared to be quite overcome with gratitude. It was learned, also,  from another source, that the last assertion was greatly exaggerated.    The touching incident was worn out in another paragraph, which left no  doubt that the benevolent society lady was none other than a charming  and accomplished daughter of the House of Grinder.      It was late in the last day of the Easter Holidays, during which Arvie  Aspinall had lain in bed with a bad cold. He was still what he called  \"croopy.\" It was about nine o'clock, and the business of Jones's Alley  was in full swing.    \"That's better, mother, I'm far better,\" said Arvie, \"the sugar and  vinegar cuts the phlegm, and the both'rin' cough gits out. It got out to  such an extent for the next few minutes that he could not speak. When he  recovered his breath, he said:    \"Better or worse, I'll have to go to work to-morrow. Gimme the clock,  mother.\"    \"I tell you you shall not go! It will be your death.\"    \"It's no use talking, mother; we can't starve--and--s'posin' somebody  got my place! Gimme the clock, mother.\"    \"I'll send one of the children round to say you're ill. They'll surely  let you off for a day or two.\"    \"Tain't no use; they won't wait; I know them--what does Grinder Bros  care if I'm ill? Never mind, mother, I'll rise above 'em all yet. _Give  me the clock_, mother.\"    She gave him the clock, and he proceeded to wind it up and set the  alarm.    \"There's somethin' wrong with the gong,\" he muttered, \"it's gone wrong  two nights now, but I'll chance it. I'll set the alarm at five, that'll  give me time to dress and git there early. I wish I hadn't to walk so  far.\"    He paused to read some words engraved round the dial:        Early to bed and early to rise      Makes a man healthy and wealthy and wise.    He had read the verse often before, and was much taken with the swing  and rhythm of it. He had repeated it to himself, over and over again,  without reference to the sense or philosophy of it. He had never dreamed  of doubting anything in print--and this was engraved. But now a new  light seemed to dawn upon him. He studied the sentence awhile, and then  read it aloud for the second time. He turned it over in his mind again  in silence.    \"Mother!\" he said suddenly, \"I think it lies.\" She placed the clock on  the shelf, tucked him into his little bed on the sofa, and blew out the  light.    Arvie seemed to sleep, but she lay awake thinking of her troubles. Of  her husband carried home dead from his work one morning; of her eldest  son who only came to loaf on her when he was out of jail; of the second  son, who had feathered his nest in another city, and had no use for her  any longer; of the next--poor delicate little Arvie--struggling manfully  to help, and wearing his young life out at Grinder Bros when he should  be at school; of the five helpless younger children asleep in the next  room: of her hard life--scrubbing floors from half-past five till  eight, and then starting her day's work--washing!--of having to rear her  children in the atmosphere of the slums, because she could not afford to  move and pay a higher rent; and of the rent.    Arvie commenced to mutter in his sleep.    \"Can't you get to sleep, Arvie?\" she asked. \"Is your throat sore? Can I  get anything for you?\"    \"I'd like to sleep,\" he muttered, dreamily, \"but it won't seem more'n a  moment before--before--\"    \"Before what, Arvie?\" she asked, quickly, fearing that he was becoming  delirious.    \"Before the alarm goes off!\"     He was talking in his sleep.    She rose gently and put the alarm on two hours. \"He can rest now,\" she  whispered to herself.    Presently Arvie sat bolt upright, and said quickly, \"Mother! I thought  the alarm went off!\" Then, without waiting for an answer, he lay down as  suddenly and slept.    The rain had cleared away, and a bright, starry dome was over sea and  city, over slum and villa alike; but little of it could be seen from the  hovel in Jones's Alley, save a glimpse of the Southern Cross and a few  stars round it. It was what ladies call a \"lovely night,\" as seen from  the house of Grinder--\"Grinderville\"--with its moonlit terraces and  gardens sloping gently to the water, and its windows lit up for an  Easter ball, and its reception-rooms thronged by its own exclusive set,  and one of its charming and accomplished daughters melting a select  party to tears by her pathetic recitation about a little crossing  sweeper.    There _was_ something wrong with the alarm-clock, or else Mrs Aspinall  had made a mistake, for the gong sounded startlingly in the dead of  night. She woke with a painful start, and lay still, expecting to hear  Arvie get up; but he made no sign. She turned a white, frightened face  towards the sofa where he lay--the light from the alley's solitary lamp  on the pavement above shone down through the window, and she saw that he  had not moved.    Why didn't the clock wake him? He was such a light sleeper! \"Arvie!\"  she called; no answer. \"Arvie!\" she called again, with a strange ring  of remonstrance mingling with the terror in her voice. Arvie never  answered.    \"Oh! my God!\" she moaned.    She rose and stood by the sofa. Arvie lay on his back with his arms  folded--a favourite sleeping position of his; but his eyes were wide  open and staring upwards as though they would stare through ceiling and  roof to the place where God ought to be.        STRAGGLERS      An oblong hut, walled with blue-grey hardwood slabs, adzed at the ends  and set horizontally between the round sapling studs; high roof of the  eternal galvanized iron. A big rubbish heap lies about a yard to the  right of the door, which opens from the middle of one of the side walls;  it might be the front or the back wall--there is nothing to fix it.  Two rows of rough bunks run round three sides of the interior; and a  fire-place occupies one end--the kitchen end. Sleeping, eating, gambling  and cooking accommodation for thirty men in about eighteen by forty  feet.    The rouseabouts and shearers use the hut in common during shearing.  Down the centre of the place runs a table made of stakes driven into the  ground, with cross-pieces supporting a top of half-round slabs set with  the flat sides up, and affording a few level places for soup-plates; on  each side are crooked, unbarked poles laid in short forks, to serve as  seats. The poles are worn smoothest opposite the level places on the  table. The floor is littered with rubbish--old wool-bales, newspapers,  boots, worn-out shearing pants, rough bedding, etc., raked out of the  bunks in impatient search for missing articles--signs of a glad and  eager departure with cheques when the shed last cut out.    To the west is a dam, holding back a broad, shallow sheet of grey water,  with dead trees standing in it.    Further up along this water is a brush shearing-shed, a rough framework  of poles with a brush roof. This kind of shed has the advantage of being  cooler than iron. It is not rain-proof, but shearers do not work in  rainy weather; shearing even slightly damp sheep is considered the  surest and quickest way to get the worst kind of rheumatism. The floor  is covered with rubbish from the roof, and here and there lies a rusty  pair of shears. A couple of dry tar-pots hang by nails in the posts. The  \"board\" is very uneven and must be bad for sweeping. The pens are formed  by round, crooked stakes driven into the ground in irregular lines, and  the whole business reminds us of the \"cubby-house\" style of architecture  of our childhood.    Opposite stands the wool-shed, built entirely of galvanized iron; a  blinding object to start out of the scrub on a blazing, hot day. God  forgive the man who invented galvanized iron, and the greed which  introduced it into Australia: you could not get worse roofing material  for a hot country.    The wool-washing, soap-boiling, and wool-pressing arrangements are  further up the dam. \"Government House\" is a mile away, and is nothing  better than a bush hut; this station belongs to a company. And the  company belongs to a bank. And the banks belong to England, mostly.    Mulga scrub all round, and, in between, patches of reddish sand where  the grass ought to be.    It is New Year's Eve. Half a dozen travellers are camping in the hut,  having a spell. They need it, for there are twenty miles of dry lignum  plain between here and the government bore to the east; and about  eighteen miles of heavy, sandy, cleared road north-west to the next  water in that direction. With one exception, the men do not seem hard  up; at least, not as that condition is understood by the swagmen of  these times. The least lucky one of the lot had three weeks' work in a  shed last season, and there might probably be five pounds amongst the  whole crowd. They are all shearers, or at least they say they are. Some  might be only \"rousers.\"    These men have a kind of stock hope of getting a few stragglers to shear  somewhere; but their main object is to live till next shearing. In order  to do this they must tramp for tucker, and trust to the regulation--and  partly mythical--pint of flour, and bit of meat, or tea and sugar,"]]]
