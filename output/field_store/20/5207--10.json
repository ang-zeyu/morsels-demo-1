[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68"],[0,"Warlord of Mars (#12)"],[1," a short distance from  the wall all about the city, that no enemy may utilize the trees  as a means of ingress.    Several times I attempted to scale the barrier at different points,  but not even my earthly muscles could overcome that cleverly  constructed rampart.  To a height of thirty feet the face of the  wall slanted outward, and then for almost an equal distance it was  perpendicular, above which it slanted in again for some fifteen  feet to the crest.    And smooth!  Polished glass could not be more so.  Finally I had  to admit that at last I had discovered a Barsoomian fortification  which I could not negotiate.    Discouraged, I withdrew into the forest beside a broad highway which  entered the city from the east, and with Woola beside me lay down  to sleep.          A HERO IN KAOL      It was daylight when I was awakened by the sound of stealthy movement  near by.    As I opened my eyes Woola, too, moved and, coming up to his haunches,  stared through the intervening brush toward the road, each hair  upon his neck stiffly erect.    At first I could see nothing, but presently I caught a glimpse of  a bit of smooth and glossy green moving among the scarlet and purple  and yellow of the vegetation.    Motioning Woola to remain quietly where he was, I crept forward to  investigate, and from behind the bole of a great tree I saw a long  line of the hideous green warriors of the dead sea bottoms hiding  in the dense jungle beside the road.    As far as I could see, the silent line of destruction and death  stretched away from the city of Kaol.  There could be but one  explanation.  The green men were expecting an exodus of a body of  red troops from the nearest city gate, and they were lying there  in ambush to leap upon them.    I owed no fealty to the Jeddak of Kaol, but he was of the same race  of noble red men as my own princess, and I would not stand supinely  by and see his warriors butchered by the cruel and heartless demons  of the waste places of Barsoom.    Cautiously I retraced my steps to where I had left Woola, and warning  him to silence, signaled him to follow me.  Making a considerable  detour to avoid the chance of falling into the hands of the green  men, I came at last to the great wall.    A hundred yards to my right was the gate from which the troops  were evidently expected to issue, but to reach it I must pass the  flank of the green warriors within easy sight of them, and, fearing  that my plan to warn the Kaolians might thus be thwarted, I decided  upon hastening toward the left, where another gate a mile away  would give me ingress to the city.    I knew that the word I brought would prove a splendid passport to  Kaol, and I must admit that my caution was due more to my ardent  desire to make my way into the city than to avoid a brush with the  green men.  As much as I enjoy a fight, I cannot always indulge  myself, and just now I had more weighty matters to occupy my time  than spilling the blood of strange warriors.    Could I but win beyond the city's wall, there might be opportunity  in the confusion and excitement which were sure to follow my  announcement of an invading force of green warriors to find my way  within the palace of the jeddak, where I was sure Matai Shang and  his party would be quartered.    But scarcely had I taken a hundred steps in the direction of the  farther gate when the sound of marching troops, the clank of metal,  and the squealing of thoats just within the city apprised me of the  fact that the Kaolians were already moving toward the other gate.    There was no time to be lost.  In another moment the gate would be  opened and the head of the column pass out upon the death-bordered  highway.    Turning back toward the fateful gate, I ran rapidly along the edge  of the clearing, taking the ground in the mighty leaps that had  first made me famous upon Barsoom.  Thirty, fifty, a hundred feet  at a bound are nothing for the muscles of an athletic Earth man  upon Mars.    As I passed the flank of the waiting green men they saw my eyes  turned upon them, and in an instant, knowing that all secrecy was  at an end, those nearest me sprang to their feet in an effort to  cut me off before I could reach the gate.    At the same instant the mighty portal swung wide and the head of  the Kaolian column emerged.  A dozen green warriors had succeeded  in reaching a point between me and the gate, but they had but little  idea who it was they had elected to detain.    I did not slacken my speed an iota as I dashed among them, and as  they fell before my blade I could not but recall the happy memory  of those other battles when Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark, mightiest  of Martian green men, had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through  long, hot Martian days, as together we hewed down our enemies until  the pile of corpses about us rose higher than a tall man's head.    When several pressed me too closely, there before the carved gateway  of Kaol, I leaped above their heads, and fashioning my tactics  after those of the hideous plant men of Dor, struck down upon my  enemies' heads as I passed above them.    From the city the red warriors were rushing toward us, and from  the jungle the savage horde of green men were coming to meet them.  In a moment I was in the very center of as fierce and bloody a  battle as I had ever passed through.    These Kaolians are most noble fighters, nor are the green men of  the equator one whit less warlike than their cold, cruel cousins of  the temperate zone.  There were many times when either side might  have withdrawn without dishonor and thus ended hostilities, but  from the mad abandon with which each invariably renewed hostilities  I soon came to believe that what need not have been more than a  trifling skirmish would end only with the complete extermination  of one force or the other.    With the joy of battle once roused within me, I took keen delight  in the fray, and that my fighting was noted by the Kaolians was  often evidenced by the shouts of applause directed at me.    If I sometimes seem to take too great pride in my fighting ability, it  must be remembered that fighting is my vocation.  If your vocation  be shoeing horses, or painting pictures, and you can do one or  the other better than your fellows, then you are a fool if you are  not proud of your ability.  And so I am very proud that upon two  planets no greater fighter has ever lived than John Carter, Prince  of Helium.    And I outdid myself that day to impress the fact upon the natives  of Kaol, for I wished to win a way into their hearts--and their  city.  Nor was I to be disappointed in my desire.    All day we fought, until the road was red with blood and clogged  with corpses.  Back and forth along the slippery highway the tide  of battle surged, but never once was the gateway to Kaol really in  danger.    There were breathing spells when I had a chance to converse with  the red men beside whom I fought, and once the jeddak, Kulan Tith  himself, laid his hand upon my shoulder and asked my name.    \"I am Dotar Sojat,\" I replied, recalling a name given me by the  Tharks many years before, from the surnames of the first two of  their warriors I had killed, which is the custom among them.    \"You are a mighty warrior, Dotar Sojat,\" he replied, \"and when  this day is done I shall speak with you again in the great audience  chamber.\"    And then the fight surged upon us once more and we were separated,  but my heart's desire was attained, and it was with renewed vigor  and a joyous soul that I laid about me with my long-sword until  the last of the green men had had enough and had withdrawn toward  their distant sea bottom.    Not until the battle was over did I learn why the red troops had  sallied forth that day.  It seemed that Kulan Tith was expecting  a visit from a mighty jeddak of the north--a powerful and the only  ally of the Kaolians, and it had been his wish to meet his guest  a full day's journey from Kaol.    But now the march of the welcoming host was delayed until the  following morning, when the troops again set out from Kaol.  I had  not been bidden to the presence of Kulan Tith after the battle,  but he had sent an officer to find me and escort me to comfortable  quarters in that part of the palace set aside for the officers of  the royal guard.    There, with Woola, I had spent a comfortable night, and rose much  refreshed after the arduous labors of the past few days.  Woola  had fought with me through the battle of the previous day, true to  the instincts and training of a Martian war dog, great numbers of  which are often to be found with the savage green hordes of the  dead sea bottoms.    Neither of us had come through the conflict unscathed, but the  marvelous, healing salves of Barsoom had sufficed, overnight, to  make us as good as new.    I breakfasted with a number of the Kaolian officers, whom I found  as courteous and delightful hosts as even the nobles of Helium, who  are renowned for their ease of manners and excellence of breeding.  The meal was scarcely concluded when a messenger arrived from Kulan  Tith summoning me before him.    As I entered the royal presence the jeddak rose, and stepping from  the dais which supported his magnificent throne, came forward to  meet me--a mark of distinction that is seldom accorded to other  than a visiting ruler.    \"Kaor, Dotar Sojat!\" he greeted me.  \"I have summoned you to receive  the grateful thanks of the people of Kaol, for had it not been for  your heroic bravery in daring fate to warn us of the ambuscade we  must surely have fallen into the well-laid trap.  Tell me more of  yourself--from what country you come, and what errand brings you  to the court of Kulan Tith.\"    \"I am from Hastor,\" I said, for in truth I had a small palace in  that southern city which lies within the far-flung dominions of  the Heliumetic nation.    \"My presence in the land of Kaol is partly due to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6812"],[0,"Abraham Lincoln: a History — Volume 01 (#12)"],[1,"rise, and their domestic affection, which  they did not care to dissemble and conceal like their shy and reticent  neighbors. It was a daily spectacle, which never lost its strangeness  for the Tennesseeans and Kentuckians, to see the Frenchman returning  from his work greeted by his wife and children with embraces of  welcome \"at the gate of his door-yard, and in view of all the  villagers.\" The natural and kindly fraternization of the Frenchmen  with the Indians was also a cause of wonder to the Americans. The  friendly intercourse between them, and their occasional  intermarriages, seemed little short of monstrous to the ferocious  exclusiveness of the Anglo-Saxon. [Footnote: Michelet notices this  exclusiveness of the English, and inveighs against it in his most  lyric style. \"Crime contre la nature! Crime contre l'humanite! Il sera  expie par la sterilite de l'esprit.\"] The Indians in the central part  of Illinois cut very little figure in the reminiscences of the  pioneers; they occupied much the same relation to them as the tramp to  the housewife of to-day. The Winnebago war in 1827 and the Black Hawk  war in 1831 disturbed only the northern portion of the State. A few  scattered and vagrant lodges of Pottawatomies and Kickapoos were all  the pioneers of Sangamon and the neighboring counties ever met. They  were spared the heroic struggle of the advance-guard of civilization  in other States. A woman was sometimes alarmed by a visit from a  drunken savage; poultry and pigs occasionally disappeared when they  were in the neighborhood; but life was not darkened by the constant  menace of massacre. A few years earlier, indeed, the relations of the  two races had been more strained, as may be inferred from an act  passed by the territorial Legislature in 1814, offering a reward of  fifty dollars to any citizen or ranger who should kill or take any  depredating Indian. As only two dollars was paid for killing a wolf,  it is easy to see how the pioneers regarded the forest folk in point  of relative noxiousness. But ten years later a handful only of the  Kickapoos remained in Sangamon County, the specter of the vanished  people. A chief named Machina came one day to a family who were  clearing a piece of timber, and issued an order of eviction in these  words: \"Too much come white man. T'other side Sangamon.\" He threw a  handful of dried leaves in the air to show how he would scatter the  pale faces, but he never fulfilled his threats further than to come in  occasionally and ask for a drink of whisky. That such trivial details  are still related, only shows how barren of incident was the life of  these obscure founders of a great empire. Any subject of conversation,  any cause of sensation, was a godsend. When Vannoy murdered his wife  in Springfield, whole families put on their best clothes and drove  fifty miles through bottomless mud and swollen rivers to see him  hanged.    [Sidenote: Power, \"Early Settlers of Sangamon County,\" p. 88.]    It is curious to see how naturally in such a state of things the  fabric of political society developed itself from its germ. The county  of Sangamon was called by an act of the Legislature in 1821 out of a  verdant solitude of more than a million acres, inhabited by a few  families. An election for county commissioners was ordered; three men  were chosen; they came together at the cabin of John Kelly, at Spring  Creek. He was a roving bachelor from North Carolina, devoted to the  chase, who had built this hut three years before on the margin of a  green-bordered rivulet, where the deer passed by in hundreds, going in  the morning from the shady banks of the Sangamon to feed on the rich  green grass of the prairie, and returning in the twilight. He was so  delighted with this hunters' paradise that he sent for his brothers to  join him. They came and brought their friends, so it happened that in  this immense county, several thousand square miles in extent, the  settlement of John Kelly at Spring Creek was the only place where  there was shelter for the commissioners; thus it became the temporary  county-seat, duly described in the official report of the  commissioners as \"a certain point in the prairie near John Kelly's  field, on the waters of Spring Creek, at a stake marked Z and D (the  initials of the commissioners), to be the temporary seat of justice  for said county; and we do further agree that the said county-seat be  called and known by the name of Springfield.\" In this manner the  future capital received that hackneyed title, when the distinctive and  musical name of Sangamon was ready to their hands. The same day they  agreed with John Kelly to build them a court-house, for which they  paid him forty-two dollars and fifty cents. In twenty-four days the  house was built--one room of rough logs, the jury retiring to any  sequestered glade they fancied for their deliberation. They next  ordered the building of a jail, which cost just twice as much money as  the court-house. Constables and overseers of the poor were appointed,  and all the machinery of government prepared for the population which  was hourly expected. It was taken for granted that malefactors would  come and the constables have employment; and the poor they would have  always with them, when once they began to arrive. This was only a  temporary arrangement, but when, a year or two later, the time came to  fix upon a permanent seat of justice for the county, the resources of  the Spring Creek men were equal to the emergency. When the  commissioners came to decide on the relative merits of Springfield and  another site a few miles away, they led them through brake, through  brier, by mud knee-deep and by water-courses so exasperating that the  wearied and baffled officials declared they would seek no further, and  Springfield became the county-seat for all time; and greater destinies  were in store for it through means not wholly dissimilar. Nature had  made it merely a pleasant hunting-ground; the craft and the industry  of its first settlers made it a capital.    [Sidenote: \"History Of Sangamon County,\" p. 83.]    [Sidenote: \"Old Times in McLean County,\" p. 235.]    [Sidenote: Ford, \"History of Illinois,\" p. 53.]    The courts which were held in these log huts were as rude as might be  expected; yet there is evidence that although there was no superfluity  of law or of learning, justice was substantially administered. The  lawyers came mostly from Kentucky, though an occasional New Englander  confronted and lived down the general prejudice against his region and  obtained preferment. The profits of the profession were inconceivably  small. One early State's Attorney describes his first circuit as a  tour of shifts and privations not unlike the wanderings of a mendicant  friar. In his first county he received a fee of five dollars for  prosecuting the parties to a sanguinary affray. In the next he was  equally successful, but barely escaped drowning in Spoon River. In the  third there were but two families at the county-seat, and no cases on  the docket. Thence he journeyed across a trackless prairie sixty  miles, and at Quincy had one case and gained five dollars. In Pike  County our much-enduring jurist took no cash, but found a generous  sheriff who entertained him without charge. \"He was one of nature's  noblemen, from Massachusetts,\" writes the grateful prosecutor. The  lawyers in what was called good practice earned less than a street-  sweeper to-day. It is related that the famous Stephen A. Douglas once  traveled from Springfield to Bloomington and made an extravagant  speech, and having gained his case received a fee of five dollars. In  such a state of things it was not to be wondered at that the  technicalities of law were held in somewhat less veneration than what  the pioneer regarded as the essential claims of justice. The  infirmities of the jury system gave them less annoyance than they give  us. Governor Ford mentions a case where a gang of horse-thieves  succeeded in placing one of their confederates upon a jury which was  to try them; but he was soon brought to reason by his eleven  colleagues making preparations to hang him to the rafters of the jury  room. The judges were less hampered by the limitations of their legal  lore than by their fears of a loss of popularity as a result of too  definite charges in civil suits, or too great severity in criminal  cases. They grew very dexterous in avoiding any commitment as to the  legal or moral bearings of the questions brought before them. They  generally refused to sum up, or to comment upon evidence; when asked  by the counsel to give instructions they would say, \"Why, gentlemen,  the jury understand this case as well as you or I. They will do  justice between the parties.\" One famous judge, who was afterwards  governor, when sentencing a murderer, impressed it upon his mind, and  wished him to inform his friends, that it was the jury and not the  judge who had found him guilty, and then asked him on what day he  would like to be hanged. It is needless to say that the bench and bar  were not all of this class. There were even at that early day lawyers,  and not a few, who had already won reputation in the older States, and  whose names are still honored in the profession. Cook, McLean,  Edwards, Kane, Thomas, Reynolds, and others, the earliest lawyers of  the State, have hardly been since surpassed for learning and ability.    [Sidenote: Ford, \"History of Illinois,\" p. 31.]    [Sidenote: Ford, p. 81.]    In a community where the principal men were lawyers, where there was  as yet little commerce, and industrial enterprise was unknown, it was  natural that one of the chief interests of life should be the pursuit  of politics. The young State swarmed with politicians; they could be  found chewing and whittling at every cross-roads inn; they were busy  at every horse-race, arranging their plans and extending their  acquaintance; "]]]
