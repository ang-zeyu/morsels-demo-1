It is his usual evening stroll.\"    \"No.\"    \"Perhaps an old lady in a lace shawl, with a fat pug by her side. If  so, you have made an acquaintance with the great Mrs. Hamilton, the  doctor's wife.\"    \"No, it was not anybody's wife, uncle--it was a man. You shan't guess  any more; but what do you say to Lord Leycester?\"    \"Lord Leycester!\" said Mr. Etheridge. \"I did not even know he was at  home. Lord Leycester! And does my picture do him justice?\" he asked,  turning to her with a smile.    She bent over the flowers, ashamed of the meaningless blush which rose  to her face.    \"Yes, uncle, it is like him; but I could not see very distinctly you  know. It was moonlight. He was riding a great, huge chestnut horse.\"    \"I know,\" he murmured, \"and tearing along like a lost spirit. He  flashed past like a meteor, I expect. No, you could not see him, and  cannot judge of my portrait.\"    \"But he didn't flash past. He would have done, no doubt, but the  chestnut declined. I think it was frightened by me, for I was standing  on the bank.\"    \"And he stopped?\" asked Mr. Etheridge. \"It was a wonder; such a little  thing even as the shying of his horse was sufficient to rouse the devil  in him! He stopped!\"    \"Because he was obliged,\" said Stella, in a low voice, a deep blush of  maidenly shame rising to her face, as she remembers that it was she who  had really stopped him.    \"And was he very furious?\"    \"No; the proverbial lamb could not have been more quiet,\" said Stella,  with a musical laugh.    Mr. Etheridge laughed.    \"He must have been in a good humor. It was strange his being out  to-night. The Hall is full of people from town; but it would not matter  to him if he wanted to ride, though the prince himself were there; he  would go. And my picture?\"    \"Did him justice, uncle. Yes, he is very handsome; he wore a loose  velvet coat to-night of a dark purple; I did not know gentlemen wore  such colors now.\"    \"A smoking coat,\" he explained. \"I think I can see him. No doubt he had  obeyed the impulse of the moment--had jumped up and left them there at  the Hall--saddled his own horse and tore away across the river. Well,  you have probably seen the last of him for some time, Stella. He rarely  stays at the Hall more than a day or two. Town has too great a charm  for him.\"    Stella's lips opened, and she was about to reply that he had suddenly  resolved to stay, but something stopped the words on her lips.    Presently there was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Penfold came in with  the candles.    \"You have given me quite a turn, Miss Stella,\" she said, with a smile  of reproach; \"I thought you were lost. Your room is quite ready now,  miss.\"    Stella went up to the old man and kissed him.    \"Good-night, uncle,\" she murmured.    \"Good-night, my child,\" he said, his eyes dwelling on her tenderly, but  with something of the bewildered look clouding them; \"Good-night, and  happy dreams for this, your first night at home.\"    \"At home!\" murmured Stella; \"at home! You are very good to me, uncle,\"  and she kissed him again.    Mrs. Penfold had done wonders in so short a time permitted her, and  Stella found herself standing alone in a tiny room, modestly but  comfortably--oh, so comfortably!--furnished, with its white bed and its  old-fashioned dimity curtains framing the lattice window. As her gaze  wandered round the room, her glorious eyes grew moist. It was all so  sudden, so sweet a contrast to the gaunt, bare room, which, for a weary  year she had shared with a score of girls as miserable as herself; so  sudden that she could scarcely believe it was real.    But youth is ever ready to accept the surprises of life, and she fell  asleep--fell asleep to dream that she was back in the wretched school  in Italy, and chained to a stone wall from which all her efforts to  free herself were unavailing, but presently she thought that a tall,  stalwart figure came riding down on a big chestnut horse, and that with  one sweep of his strong hand he broke her chains asunder, and, lifting  her into his saddle, bore her away. Then the scene changed; she seemed  to be following her rescuer who, with his handsome face turned over his  shoulder, drew her on continually with a strange fascinating smile. All  through her dreams the smiling eyes haunted her, and once she stretched  out her hands to keep it from her, but even in the action the gesture  of repulse turned in a strange, subtle manner to one of entreaty and  welcome, and she drew the smile, as it were, to her bosom, and folded  her hands over it. A girlish fancy, perhaps, but such fancies influence  a life for good or ill, for joy or misery.    Lord Leycester Wyndward, of whose smile Stella was dreaming, had ridden  up the hills, the great chestnut scarcely breaking his pace, but  breathing hard and defiantly from its wide, red nostrils--had ridden  up the hills and through the woods, and reached the open plateau lying  round the Hall.    A noble park occupied the plateau--a park of chestnuts and oaks,  which were the pride of the county. Through the park wound the road,  gleaming white in the moonlight, to the front gates of Wyndward. The  lodge-keeper heard the beat of the chestnut's feet, for which he had  been listening intently, and threw open the gates, and Lord Leycester  entered the grounds. They were vast in extent and exquisitely laid out,  the road winding between a noble avenue of trees that arched overhead.  The present earl's grandfather had gone in for arboriculture, and the  way was lined for fifty feet back with rare shrubs and conifers.    So serpentine was the road that the great gray mansion broke upon the  gaze suddenly, mentally startling him who approached it for the first  time.    To Lord Leycester it was a familiar sight, but familiar as it was he  glanced up at it with what was almost a nod of approval. Like most men  of his nature, he possessed a passionate love and appreciation for the  beautiful, and there was to-night a strange, indefinable fire in his  hot blood which made him more than usually susceptible to the influence  of the scene. A sweeping curve of the road led to the terrace which  stretched along the whole front of the house, and by which the  principal entrance was gained.    Lord Leycester struck off to the right, and entered a modern courtyard,  three sides of which were occupied by the admirable stables. A couple  of grooms had been listening as intently as the lodge-keeper, and as he  entered the yard they hurried forward silently and took the chestnut.  Lord Leycester dropped to the ground, patted the horse, which made a  playfully-affectionate snap at his arm, and, ascending a flight of  steps, entered the lower end of the long hall, which stretched through  the building.    The hall was softly but sufficiently lighted by shaded lamps, supported  by huge figures in bronze, which diffused a charming glow upon the  innumerable pictures upon the panels of dark oak. From the vaulted  roof hung tattered flags, most of them borne by the earlier Wyndwards,  some of them bestowed by the graceful hands of dead and gone princes;  the somewhat gloomy aspect of the place was lightened by the gleaming  armor of the knightly effigies which stood at regular intervals upon  the tesselated floor, and by the deep crimson of the curtains which  screened the heavy doors and tall windows. The whole scene, the very  atmosphere, as it seemed, was characteristic of an ancient and powerful  race. Notwithstanding that the house was full of guests, and that a  brilliant party was at that moment in the drawing-room, not a sound  penetrated the vast hall. The two or three servants who were standing  by the doors or sitting on the benches, talking in hushed voices, were  silent the moment he entered, and one came forward to receive any  commands.    Notwithstanding the brusqueness which is the salient characteristic of  our present life, the old world state and formality still existed at  Wyndward. Be as exacting and capricious as you might, you had no fear  of meeting with inattention or disrespect from the army of servants,  whose one aim and purpose in life seemed to be to minister to the wants  and moods of their superiors.    It was a princely house, conducted in stately fashion, without regard  to cost or trouble, and the servants, from the pages to the countess's  own maid, were as proud of their position, in its degree, as the Lord  of Wyndward of his.    \"Send Oliver to me,\" said Lord Wyndward, as he passed the man. \"I am  going to my room.\"    He went up the stairs, and passing along the principal corridor,  entered a room fronting the park. It was one of a suite which consisted  of a sort of sitting-room, a dressing-room, and beyond a bedroom.    The sitting-room gave pretty plain indications of the owner's tastes  and dispositions.    It was a medley of objects connected with sport and art. Here a set  of boxing-gloves and foils; a gun-rack, well stocked; fishing-rods  and whips hung over the antique fireplace with the wide open hearth  and dog-irons. On one side of the room hung a collection of etchings,  unique and priceless; on another half a dozen gems in oil, while  against the third stood a piano, and an easel upon which rested a  canvas displaying a half-finished Venus rising from her cradle of sea  foam; for upon this, the only son of the house, the partial gods had  bestowed many gifts; any one of which, had he been a poor man, would  have made the world regard him as one of its masters.

But she began promptly, with twice one and went through  it to twelve times twelve. She repeated it simply, but her voice changed  from one tone to another as each in succession grew tired. We had never  dreamed that there was so much in the multiplication table. As she  announced it, the fact that three times three was nine was exquisitely  ridiculous, five times six almost brought tears to our eyes, eight times  seven was the most tragic and frightful thing ever heard of, and twelve  times twelve rang like a trumpet call to victory.    Mr. Campbell nodded his satisfaction.    \"I thought you could do it,\" he said. \"The other day I found this  statement in a book. 'Her voice would have made the multiplication  table charming!' I thought of it when I heard yours. I didn't believe it  before, but I do now.\"    Then he let us go.    \"You see,\" said the Story Girl as we went home, \"you need never be  afraid of people.\"    \"But we are not all Story Girls,\" said Cecily.    That night we heard Felicity talking to Cecily in their room.    \"Mr. Campbell never noticed one of us except the Story Girl,\" she said,  \"but if I had put on MY best dress as she did maybe she wouldn't have  taken all the attention.\"    \"Could you ever do what Betty Sherman did, do you suppose?\" asked Cecily  absently.    \"No; but I believe the Story Girl could,\" answered Felicity rather  snappishly.        CHAPTER VIII. A TRAGEDY OF CHILDHOOD    The Story Girl went to Charlottetown for a week in June to visit Aunt  Louisa. Life seemed very colourless without her, and even Felicity  admitted that it was lonesome. But three days after her departure Felix  told us something on the way home from school which lent some spice to  existence immediately.    \"What do you think?\" he said in a very solemn, yet excited, tone. \"Jerry  Cowan told me at recess this afternoon that he HAD SEEN A PICTURE OF  GOD--that he has it at home in an old, red-covered history of the world,  and has looked at it OFTEN.\"    To think that Jerry Cowan should have seen such a picture often! We were  as deeply impressed as Felix had meant us to be.    \"Did he say what it was like?\" asked Peter.    \"No--only that it was a picture of God, walking in the garden of Eden.\"    \"Oh,\" whispered Felicity--we all spoke in low tones on the subject, for,  by instinct and training, we thought and uttered the Great Name with  reverence, in spite of our devouring curiosity--\"oh, WOULD Jerry Cowan  bring it to school and let us see it?\"    \"I asked him that, soon as ever he told me,\" said Felix. \"He said he  might, but he couldn't promise, for he'd have to ask his mother if  he could bring the book to school. If she'll let him he'll bring it  to-morrow.\"    \"Oh, I'll be almost afraid to look at it,\" said Sara Ray tremulously.    I think we all shared her fear to some extent. Nevertheless, we went to  school the next day burning with curiosity. And we were disappointed.  Possibly night had brought counsel to Jerry Cowan; or perhaps his mother  had put him up to it. At all events, he announced to us that he couldn't  bring the red-covered history to school, but if we wanted to buy the  picture outright he would tear it out of the book and sell it to us for  fifty cents.    We talked the matter over in serious conclave in the orchard that  evening. We were all rather short of hard cash, having devoted most of  our spare means to the school library fund. But the general consensus  of opinion was that we must have the picture, no matter what pecuniary  sacrifices were involved. If we could each give about seven cents we  would have the amount. Peter could only give four, but Dan gave eleven,  which squared matters.    \"Fifty cents would be pretty dear for any other picture, but of course  this is different,\" said Dan.    \"And there's a picture of Eden thrown in, too, you know,\" added  Felicity.    \"Fancy selling God's picture,\" said Cecily in a shocked, awed tone.    \"Nobody but a Cowan would do it, and that's a fact,\" said Dan.    \"When we get it we'll keep it in the family Bible,\" said Felicity.  \"That's the only proper place.\"    \"Oh, I wonder what it will be like,\" breathed Cecily.    We all wondered. Next day in school we agreed to Jerry Cowan's terms,  and Jerry promised to bring the picture up to Uncle Alec's the following  afternoon.    We were all intensely excited Saturday morning. To our dismay, it began  to rain just before dinner.    \"What if Jerry doesn't bring the picture to-day because of the rain?\" I  suggested.    \"Never you fear,\" answered Felicity decidedly. \"A Cowan would come  through ANYTHING for fifty cents.\"    After dinner we all, without any verbal decision about it, washed our  faces and combed our hair. The girls put on their second best dresses,  and we boys donned white collars. We all had the unuttered feeling that  we must do such honour to that Picture as we could. Felicity and Dan  began a small spat over something, but stopped at once when Cecily said  severely,    \"How DARE you quarrel when you are going to look at a picture of God  to-day?\"    Owing to the rain we could not foregather in the orchard, where we had  meant to transact the business with Jerry. We did not wish our grown-ups  around at our great moment, so we betook ourselves to the loft of the  granary in the spruce wood, from whose window we could see the main road  and hail Jerry. Sara Ray had joined us, very pale and nervous, having  had, so it appeared, a difference of opinion with her mother about  coming up the hill in the rain.    \"I'm afraid I did very wrong to come against ma's will,\" she said  miserably, \"but I COULDN'T wait. I wanted to see the picture as soon as  you did.\"    We waited and watched at the window. The valley was full of mist, and  the rain was coming down in slanting lines over the tops of the spruces.  But as we waited the clouds broke away and the sun came out flashingly;  the drops on the spruce boughs glittered like diamonds.    \"I don't believe Jerry can be coming,\" said Cecily in despair. \"I  suppose his mother must have thought it was dreadful, after all, to sell  such a picture.\"    \"There he is now!\" cried Dan, waving excitedly from the window.    \"He's carrying a fish-basket,\" said Felicity. \"You surely don't suppose  he would bring THAT picture in a fish-basket!\"    Jerry HAD brought it in a fish-basket, as appeared when he mounted  the granary stairs shortly afterwards. It was folded up in a newspaper  packet on top of the dried herring with which the basket was filled. We  paid him his money, but we would not open the packet until he had gone.    \"Cecily,\" said Felicity in a hushed tone. \"You are the best of us all.  YOU open the parcel.\"    \"Oh, I'm no gooder than the rest of you,\" breathed Cecily, \"but I'll  open it if you like.\"    With trembling fingers Cecily opened the parcel. We stood around, hardly  breathing. She unfolded it and held it up. We saw it.    Suddenly Sara began to cry.    \"Oh, oh, oh, does God look like THAT?\" she wailed.    Felix and I spoke not. Disappointment, and something worse, sealed our  speech. DID God look like that--like that stern, angrily frowning old  man with the tossing hair and beard of the wood-cut Cecily held.    \"I suppose He must, since that is His picture,\" said Dan miserably.    \"He looks awful cross,\" said Peter simply.    \"Oh, I wish we'd never, never seen it,\" cried Cecily.    We all wished that--too late. Our curiosity had led us into some Holy of  Holies, not to be profaned by human eyes, and this was our punishment.    \"I've always had a feeling right along,\" wept Sara, \"that it wasn't  RIGHT to buy--or LOOK AT--God's picture.\"    As we stood there wretchedly we heard flying feet below and a blithe  voice calling,    \"Where are you, children?\"    The Story Girl had returned! At any other moment we would have rushed to  meet her in wild joy. But now we were too crushed and miserable to move.    \"Whatever is the matter with you all?\" demanded the Story Girl,  appearing at the top of the stairs. \"What is Sara crying about? What  have you got there?\"    \"A picture of God,\" said Cecily with a sob in her voice, \"and oh, it is  so dreadful and ugly. Look!\"    The Story Girl looked. An expression of scorn came over her face.    \"Surely you don't believe God looks like that,\" she said impatiently,  while her fine eyes flashed. \"He doesn't--He couldn't. He is wonderful  and beautiful. I'm surprised at you. THAT is nothing but the picture of  a cross old man.\"    Hope sprang up in our hearts, although we were not wholly convinced.    \"I don't know,\" said Dan dubiously. \"It says under the picture 'God in  the Garden of Eden.' It's PRINTED.\"    \"Well, I suppose that's what the man who drew it thought God was like,\"  answered the Story Girl carelessly. \"But HE couldn't have known any more  than you do. HE had never seen Him.\"    \"It's all very well for you to say so,\" said Felicity, \"but YOU don't  know either. I wish I could believe that isn't like God--but I don't  know what to believe.\"    \"Well, if you won't believe me, I suppose you'll believe the minister,\"  said the Story Girl. \"Go and ask him. He's in the house this very  minute. He came up with us in the buggy.\"    At any other time we would never have dared catechize the minister  about anything. But desperate cases call for desperate measures. We  drew straws to see who should go and do the asking, and the lot fell to  Felix.    \"Better wait until Mr. Marwood leaves, and catch him in the lane,\"  advised the Story Girl. \"You'll have a lot of grown-ups around you in  the house.\"    Felix took her advice. Mr. Marwood, presently walking benignantly  along the lane, was confronted by a fat, small boy with a pale face but  resolute eyes.    The rest of us remained in the background but within hearing.    \"Well, Felix, what is it?\" asked Mr. Marwood kindly.    \"P"]]]
