Now Jinjur lives peacefully on a farm, near here, and raises  fields of cream-puffs, chocolate-caramels and macaroons. They say she's  a pretty good farmer, and in addition to that she's an artist, and  paints pictures so perfect that one can scarcely tell them from nature.  She often repaints my face for me, when it gets worn or mussy, and the  lovely expression I wore when the Giantess transformed me was painted  by Jinjur only a month or so ago.\"    \"It was certainly a pleasant expression,\" agreed Woot.    \"Jinjur can paint anything,\" continued the Scarecrow Bear, with  enthusiasm, as they walked along together. \"Once, when I came to her  house, my straw was old and crumpled, so that my body sagged  dreadfully. I needed new straw to replace the old, but Jinjur had no  straw on all her ranch and I was really unable to travel farther until  I had been restuffed. When I explained this to Jinjur, the girl at once  painted a straw-stack which was so natural that I went to it and  secured enough straw to fill all my body. It was a good quality of  straw, too, and lasted me a long time.\"    This seemed very wonderful to Woot, who knew that such a thing could  never happen in any place but a fairy country like Oz.    The Munchkin Country was much nicer than the Gillikin Country, and all  the fields were separated by blue fences, with grassy lanes and paths  of blue ground, and the land seemed well cultivated. They were on a  little hill looking down upon this favored country, but had not quite  reached the settled parts, when on turning a bend in the path they were  halted by a form that barred their way.    A more curious creature they had seldom seen, even in the Land of Oz,  where curious creatures abound. It had the head of a young  man--evidently a Munchkin--with a pleasant face and hair neatly combed.  But the body was very long, for it had twenty legs--ten legs on each  side--and this caused the body to stretch out and lie in a horizontal  position, so that all the legs could touch the ground and stand firm.  From the shoulders extended two small arms; at least, they seemed small  beside so many legs.    This odd creature was dressed in the regulation clothing of the  Munchkin people, a dark blue coat neatly fitting the long body and each  pair of legs having a pair of sky-blue trousers, with blue-tinted  stockings and blue leather shoes turned up at the pointed toes.    \"I wonder who you are?\" said Polychrome the Canary, fluttering above  the strange creature, who had probably been asleep on the path.    \"I sometimes wonder, myself, who I am,\" replied the many-legged young  man; \"but, in reality, I am Tommy Kwikstep, and I live in a hollow tree  that fell to the ground with age. I have polished the inside of it, and  made a door at each end, and that's a very comfortable residence for me  because it just fits my shape.\"    \"How did you happen to have such a shape?\" asked the Scarecrow Bear,  sitting on his haunches and regarding Tommy Kwikstep with a serious  look. \"Is the shape natural?\"    \"No; it was wished on me,\" replied Tommy, with a sigh. \"I used to be  very active and loved to run errands for anyone who needed my services.  That was how I got my name of Tommy Kwikstep. I could run an errand  more quickly than any other boy, and so I was very proud of myself. One  day, however, I met an old lady who was a fairy, or a witch, or  something of the sort, and she said if I would run an errand for  her--to carry some magic medicine to another old woman--she would grant  me just one Wish, whatever the Wish happened to be. Of course I  consented and, taking the medicine, I hurried away. It was a long  distance, mostly up hill, and my legs began to grow weary. Without  thinking what I was doing I said aloud: 'Dear me; I wish I had twenty  legs!' and in an instant I became the unusual creature you see beside  you. Twenty legs! Twenty on one man! You may count them, if you doubt  my word.\"    \"You've got 'em, all right,\" said Woot the Monkey, who had already  counted them.    \"After I had delivered the magic medicine to the old woman, I returned  and tried to find the witch, or fairy, or whatever she was, who had  given me the unlucky wish, so she could take it away again. I've been  searching for her ever since, but never can I find her,\" continued poor  Tommy Kwikstep, sadly.    \"I suppose,\" said the Tin Owl, blinking at him, \"you can travel very  fast, with those twenty legs.\"    \"At first I was able to,\" was the reply; \"but I traveled so much,  searching for the fairy, or witch, or whatever she was, that I soon got  corns on my toes. Now, a corn on one toe is not so bad, but when you  have a hundred toes--as I have--and get corns on most of them, it is  far from pleasant. Instead of running, I now painfully crawl, and  although I try not to be discouraged I do hope I shall find that witch  or fairy, or whatever she was, before long.\"    \"I hope so, too,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But, after all, you have the  pleasure of knowing you are unusual, and therefore remarkable among the  people of Oz. To be just like other persons is small credit to one,  while to be unlike others is a mark of distinction.\"    \"That sounds very pretty,\" returned Tommy Kwikstep, \"but if you had to  put on ten pair of trousers every morning, and tie up twenty shoes, you  would prefer not to be so distinguished.\"    \"Was the witch, or fairy, or whatever she was, an old person, with  wrinkled skin and half her teeth gone?\" inquired the Tin Owl.    \"No,\" said Tommy Kwikstep.    \"Then she wasn't Old Mombi,\" remarked the transformed Emperor.    \"I'm not interested in who it wasn't, so much as I am in who it was,\"  said the twenty-legged young man. \"And, whatever or whomsoever she was,  she has managed to keep out of my way.\"    \"If you found her, do you suppose she'd change you back into a  two-legged boy?\" asked Woot.    \"Perhaps so, if I could run another errand for her and so earn another  wish.\"    \"Would you really like to be as you were before?\" asked Polychrome the  Canary, perching upon the Green Monkey's shoulder to observe Tommy  Kwikstep more attentively.    \"I would, indeed,\" was the earnest reply.    \"Then I will see what I can do for you,\" promised the Rainbow's  Daughter, and flying to the ground she took a small twig in her bill  and with it made several mystic figures on each side of Tommy Kwikstep.    \"Are you a witch, or fairy, or something of the sort?\" he asked as he  watched her wonderingly.    The Canary made no answer, for she was busy, but the Scarecrow Bear  replied: \"Yes; she's something of the sort, and a bird of a magician.\"    The twenty-legged boy's transformation happened so queerly that they  were all surprised at its method. First, Tommy Kwikstep's last two legs  disappeared; then the next two, and the next, and as each pair of legs  vanished his body shortened. All this while Polychrome was running  around him and chirping mystical words, and when all the young man's  legs had disappeared but two he noticed that the Canary was still busy  and cried out in alarm:    \"Stop--stop! Leave me two of my legs, or I shall be worse off than  before.\"    \"I know,\" said the Canary. \"I'm only removing with my magic the corns  from your last ten toes.\"    \"Thank you for being so thoughtful,\" he said gratefully, and now they  noticed that Tommy Kwikstep was quite a nice looking young fellow.    \"What will you do now?\" asked Woot the Monkey.    \"First,\" he answered, \"I must deliver a note which I've carried in my  pocket ever since the witch, or fairy, or whatever she was, granted my  foolish wish. And I am resolved never to speak again without taking  time to think carefully on what I am going to say, for I realize that  speech without thought is dangerous. And after I've delivered the note,  I shall run errands again for anyone who needs my services.\"    So he thanked Polychrome again and started away in a different  direction from their own, and that was the last they saw of Tommy  Kwikstep.          Chapter Eleven    Jinjur's Ranch      As they followed a path down the blue-grass hillside, the first house  that met the view of the travelers was joyously recognized by the  Scarecrow Bear as the one inhabited by his friend Jinjur, so they  increased their speed and hurried toward it.    On reaching the place, how ever, they found the house deserted. The  front door stood open, but no one was inside. In the garden surrounding  the house were neat rows of bushes bearing cream-puffs and macaroons,  some of which were still green, but others ripe and ready to eat.  Farther back were fields of caramels, and all the land seemed well  cultivated and carefully tended. They looked through the fields for the  girl farmer, but she was nowhere to be seen.    \"Well,\" finally remarked the little Brown Bear, \"let us go into the  house and make ourselves at home. That will be sure to please my friend  Jinjur, who happens to be away from home just now. When she returns,  she will be greatly surprised.\"    \"Would she care if I ate some of those ripe cream-puffs?\" asked the  Green Monkey.    \"No, indeed; Jinjur is very generous. Help yourself to all you want,\"  said the Scarecrow Bear.    So Woot gathered a lot of the cream-puffs that were golden yellow and  filled with a sweet, creamy substance, and ate until his hunger was  satisfied. Then he entered the house with his friends and sat in a  rocking-chair--just as he was accustomed to do when a boy. The Canary  perched herself upon the mantel and daintily plumed her feathers; the  Tin Owl sat on the back of another chair; the Scarecrow squatted on his  hairy haunches in the middle of the room.    \"I believe I remember the girl Jinjur,\" remarked the Canary, in her  sweet voice. \"She cannot help us very much, except to direct us on our  way to Glinda's castle, for she does not understand magic. But she's a  good girl,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/961"],[0,"Glinda of Oz (#12)"],[1,"the good Adepts, who are now fishes,\"  added Ozma. \"It is unfortunate for us that the Queen kept her secrets  so closely guarded, for no one but herself could use any of these  strange things gathered in this room.\"    \"Couldn't we capture the Diamond Swan and make her tell the secrets?\"  asked Dorothy.    \"No; even were we able to capture her, Coo-ee-oh now has forgotten all  the magic she ever knew. But until we ourselves escape from this dome  we could not capture the Swan, and were we to escape we would have no  use for Coo-ee-oh's magic.\"    \"That's a fact,\" admitted Dorothy. \"But--say, Ozma, here's a good idea!  Couldn't we capture the three fishes--the gold and silver and bronze  ones, and couldn't you transform 'em back to their own shapes, and then  couldn't the three Adepts get us out of here?\"    \"You are not very practical, Dorothy dear. It would be as hard for us  to capture the three fishes, from among all the other fishes in the  lake, as to capture the Swan.\"    \"But if we could, it would be more help to us,\" persisted the little  girl.    \"That is true,\" answered Ozma, smiling at her friend's eagerness. \"You  find a way to catch the fish, and I'll promise when they are caught to  restore them to their proper forms.\"    \"I know you think I can't do it,\" replied Dorothy, \"but I'm going to  try.\"    She left the palace and went to a place where she could look through a  clear pane of the glass dome into the surrounding water. Immediately  she became interested in the queer sights that met her view.    The Lake of the Skeezers was inhabited by fishes of many kinds and many  sizes. The water was so transparent that the girl could see for a long  distance and the fishes came so close to the glass of the dome that  sometimes they actually touched it. On the white sands at the bottom of  the lake were star-fish, lobsters, crabs and many shell fish of strange  shapes and with shells of gorgeous hues. The water foliage was of  brilliant colors and to Dorothy it resembled a splendid garden.    But the fishes were the most interesting of all. Some were big and  lazy, floating slowly along or lying at rest with just their fins  waving. Many with big round eyes looked full at the girl as she watched  them and Dorothy wondered if they could hear her through the glass if  she spoke to them. In Oz, where all the animals and birds can talk,  many fishes are able to talk also, but usually they are more stupid  than birds and animals because they think slowly and haven't much to  talk about.    In the Lake of the Skeezers the fish of smaller size were more active  than the big ones and darted quickly in and out among the swaying  weeds, as if they had important business and were in a hurry. It was  among the smaller varieties that Dorothy hoped to spy the gold and  silver and bronze fishes. She had an idea the three would keep  together, being companions now as they were in their natural forms, but  such a multitude of fishes constantly passed, the scene shifting every  moment, that she was not sure she would notice them even if they  appeared in view. Her eyes couldn't look in all directions and the  fishes she sought might be on the other side of the dome, or far away  in the lake.    \"P'raps, because they were afraid of Coo-ee-oh, they've hid themselves  somewhere, and don't know their enemy has been transformed,\" she  reflected.    She watched the fishes for a long time, until she became hungry and  went back to the palace for lunch. But she was not discouraged.    \"Anything new, Ozma?\" she asked.    \"No, dear. Did you discover the three fishes?\"    \"Not yet. But there isn't anything better for me to do, Ozma, so I  guess I'll go back and watch again.\"          Chapter Thirteen    The Alarm Bell      Glinda, the Good, in her palace in the Quadling Country, had many  things to occupy her mind, for not only did she look after the weaving  and embroidery of her bevy of maids, and assist all those who came to  her to implore her help--beasts and birds as well as people--but she  was a close student of the arts of sorcery and spent much time in her  Magical Laboratory, where she strove to find a remedy for every evil  and to perfect her skill in magic.    Nevertheless, she did not forget to look in the Great Book of Records  each day to see if any mention was made of the visit of Ozma and  Dorothy to the Enchanted Mountain of the Flatheads and the Magic Isle  of the Skeezers. The Records told her that Ozma had arrived at the  mountain, that she had escaped, with her companion, and gone to the  island of the Skeezers, and that Queen Coo-ee-oh had submerged the  island so that it was entirely under water. Then came the statement  that the Flatheads had come to the lake to poison the fishes and that  their Supreme Dictator had transformed Queen Coo-ee-oh into a swan.    No other details were given in the Great Book and so Glinda did not  know that since Coo-ee-oh had forgotten her magic none of the Skeezers  knew how to raise the island to the surface again. So Glinda was not  worried about Ozma and Dorothy until one morning, while she sat with  her maids, there came a sudden clang of the great alarm bell. This was  so unusual that every maid gave a start and even the Sorceress for a  moment could not think what the alarm meant.    Then she remembered the ring she had given Dorothy when she left the  palace to start on her venture. In giving the ring Glinda had warned  the little girl not to use its magic powers unless she and Ozma were in  real danger, but then she was to turn it on her finger once to the  right and once to the left and Glinda's alarm bell would ring.    So the Sorceress now knew that danger threatened her beloved Ruler and  Princess Dorothy, and she hurried to her magic room to seek information  as to what sort of danger it was. The answer to her question was not  very satisfactory, for it was only: \"Ozma and Dorothy are prisoners in  the great Dome of the Isle of the Skeezers, and the Dome is under the  water of the lake.\"    \"Hasn't Ozma the power to raise the island to the surface?\" inquired  Glinda.    \"No,\" was the reply, and the Record refused to say more except that  Queen Coo-ee-oh, who alone could command the island to rise, had been  transformed by the Flathead Su-dic into a Diamond Swan.    Then Glinda consulted the past records of the Skeezers in the Great  Book. After diligent search she discovered that Coo-ee-oh was a  powerful sorceress who had gained most of her power by treacherously  transforming the Adepts of Magic, who were visiting her, into three  fishes--gold, silver and bronze--after which she had them cast into the  lake.    Glinda reflected earnestly on this information and decided that someone  must go to Ozma's assistance. While there was no great need of haste,  because Ozma and Dorothy could live in a submerged dome a long time, it  was evident they could not get out until someone was able to raise the  island.    The Sorceress looked through all her recipes and books of sorcery, but  could find no magic that would raise a sunken island. Such a thing had  never before been required in sorcery. Then Glinda made a little  island, covered by a glass dome, and sunk it in a pond near her castle,  and experimented in magical ways to bring it to the surface. She made  several such experiments, but all were failures. It seemed a simple  thing to do, yet she could not do it.    Nevertheless, the wise Sorceress did not despair of finding a way to  liberate her friends. Finally she concluded that the best thing to do  was to go to the Skeezer country and examine the lake. While there she  was more likely to discover a solution to the problem that bothered  her, and to work out a plan for the rescue of Ozma and Dorothy.    So Glinda summoned her storks and her aerial chariot, and telling her  maids she was going on a journey and might not soon return, she entered  the chariot and was carried swiftly to the Emerald City.    In Princess Ozma's palace the Scarecrow was now acting as Ruler of the  Land of Oz. There wasn't much for him to do, because all the affairs of  state moved so smoothly, but he was there in case anything unforeseen  should happen.    Glinda found the Scarecrow playing croquet with Trot and Betsy Bobbin,  two little girls who lived at the palace under Ozma's protection and  were great friends of Dorothy and much loved by all the Oz people.    \"Something's happened!\" cried Trot, as the chariot of the Sorceress  descended near them. \"Glinda never comes here 'cept something's gone  wrong.\"    \"I hope no harm has come to Ozma, or Dorothy,\" said Betsy anxiously, as  the lovely Sorceress stepped down from her chariot.    Glinda approached the Scarecrow and told him of the dilemma of Ozma and  Dorothy and she added: \"We must save them, somehow, Scarecrow.\"    \"Of course,\" replied the Scarecrow, stumbling over a wicket and falling  flat on his painted face.    The girls picked him up and patted his straw stuffing into shape, and  he continued, as if nothing had occurred: \"But you'll have to tell me  what to do, for I never have raised a sunken island in all my life.\"    \"We must have a Council of State as soon as possible,\" proposed the  Sorceress. \"Please send messengers to summon all of Ozma's counsellors  to this palace. Then we can decide what is best to be done.\"    The Scarecrow lost no time in doing this. Fortunately most of the royal  counsellors were in the Emerald City or near to it, so they all met in  the throne room of the palace that same evening.          Chapter Fourteen    Ozma's Counsellors      No Ruler ever had such a queer assortment of advisers as the Princess  Ozma had gathered about her throne. Indeed, in no other country could  such amazing people exist. But Ozma loved them for their peculiarities  and could trust every one of them.    First there was the Tin Woodman. Every bit of him was tin, brightly  polished. All his joints were kept"]]]
