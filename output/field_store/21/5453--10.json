At the foot of the declivity they  mounted their waiting animals and took to the road at a lively trot,  round a bend and into the Notch. The spectacle which they encountered  there was appalling!    Within that defile, barely broad enough for a single gun, were piled the  wrecks of no fewer than four. They had noted the silencing of only the  last one disabled--there had been a lack of men to replace it quickly  with another. The debris lay on both sides of the road; the men had  managed to keep an open way between, through which the fifth piece was  now firing. The men?--they looked like demons of the pit! All were  hatless, all stripped to the waist, their reeking skins black with  blotches of powder and spattered with gouts of blood. They worked like  madmen, with rammer and cartridge, lever and lanyard. They set their  swollen shoulders and bleeding hands against the wheels at each recoil  and heaved the heavy gun back to its place. There were no commands; in  that awful environment of whooping shot, exploding shells, shrieking  fragments of iron, and flying splinters of wood, none could have been  heard. Officers, if officers there were, were indistinguishable; all  worked together--each while he lasted--governed by the eye. When the gun  was sponged, it was loaded; when loaded, aimed and fired. The colonel  observed something new to his military experience--something horrible  and unnatural: the gun was bleeding at the mouth! In temporary default  of water, the man sponging had dipped his sponge into a pool of  comrade's blood. In all this work there was no clashing; the duty of the  instant was obvious. When one fell, another, looking a trifle cleaner,  seemed to rise from the earth in the dead man's tracks, to fall in his  turn.    With the ruined guns lay the ruined men--alongside the wreckage, under  it and atop of it; and back down the road--a ghastly procession!--crept  on hands and knees such of the wounded as were able to move. The  colonel--he had compassionately sent his cavalcade to the right about--  had to ride over those who were entirely dead in order not to crush  those who were partly alive. Into that hell he tranquilly held his way,  rode up alongside the gun, and, in the obscurity of the last discharge,  tapped upon the cheek the man holding the rammer--who straightway fell,  thinking himself killed. A fiend seven times damned sprang out of the  smoke to take his place, but paused and gazed up at the mounted officer  with an unearthly regard, his teeth flashing between his black lips, his  eyes, fierce and expanded, burning like coals beneath his bloody brow.  The colonel made an authoritative gesture and pointed to the rear. The  fiend bowed in token of obedience. It was Captain Coulter.    Simultaneously with the colonel's arresting sign, silence fell upon the  whole field of action. The procession of missiles no longer streamed  into that defile of death, for the enemy also had ceased firing. His  army had been gone for hours, and the commander of his rear-guard, who  had held his position perilously long in hope to silence the Federal  fire, at that strange moment had silenced his own. \"I was not aware of  the breadth of my authority,\" said the colonel to anybody, riding  forward to the crest to see what had really happened. An hour later his  brigade was in bivouac on the enemy's ground, and its idlers were  examining, with something of awe, as the faithful inspect a saint's  relics, a score of straddling dead horses and three disabled guns, all  spiked. The fallen men had been carried away; their torn and broken  bodies would have given too great satisfaction.    Naturally, the colonel established himself and his military family in  the plantation house. It was somewhat shattered, but it was better than  the open air. The furniture was greatly deranged and broken. Walls and  ceilings were knocked away here and there, and a lingering odor of  powder smoke was everywhere. The beds, the closets of women's clothing,  the cupboards were not greatly damaged. The new tenants for a night  made themselves comfortable, and the virtual effacement of Coulter's  battery supplied them with an interesting topic.    During supper an orderly of the escort showed himself into the  dining-room and asked permission to speak to the colonel.    \"What is it, Barbour?\" said that officer pleasantly, having overheard  the request.    \"Colonel, there is something wrong in the cellar; I don't know what--  somebody there. I was down there rummaging about.\"    \"I will go down and see,\" said a staff officer, rising.    \"So will I,\" the colonel said; \"let the others remain. Lead on,  orderly.\"    They took a candle from the table and descended the cellar stairs, the  orderly in visible trepidation. The candle made but a feeble light, but  presently, as they advanced, its narrow circle of illumination revealed  a human figure seated on the ground against the black stone wall which  they were skirting, its knees elevated, its head bowed sharply forward.  The face, which should have been seen in profile, was invisible, for the  man was bent so far forward that his long hair concealed it; and,  strange to relate, the beard, of a much darker hue, fell in a great  tangled mass and lay along the ground at his side. They involuntarily  paused; then the colonel, taking the candle from the orderly's shaking  hand, approached the man and attentively considered him. The long dark  beard was the hair of a woman--dead. The dead woman clasped in her arms  a dead babe. Both were clasped in the arms of the man, pressed against  his breast, against his lips. There was blood in the hair of the woman;  there was blood in the hair of the man. A yard away, near an irregular  depression in the beaten earth which formed the cellar's floor--fresh  excavation with a convex bit of iron, having jagged edges, visible in  one of the sides--lay an infant's foot. The colonel held the light as  high as he could. The floor of the room above was broken through, the  splinters pointing at all angles downward. \"This casemate is not  bomb-proof,\" said the colonel gravely. It did not occur to him that his  summing up of the matter had any levity in it.    They stood about the group awhile in silence; the staff officer was  thinking of his unfinished supper, the orderly of what might possibly be  in one of the casks on the other side of the cellar. Suddenly the man  whom they had thought dead raised his head and gazed tranquilly into  their faces. His complexion was coal black; the cheeks were apparently  tattooed in irregular sinuous lines from the eyes downward. The lips,  too, were white, like those of a stage negro. There was blood upon his  forehead.    The staff officer drew back a pace, the orderly two paces.    \"What are you doing here, my man?\" said the colonel, unmoved.    \"This house belongs to me, sir,\" was the reply, civilly delivered.    \"To you? Ah, I see! And these?\"    \"My wife and child. I am Captain Coulter.\"          THE COUP DE GRACE    The fighting had been hard and continuous; that was attested by all the  senses. The very taste of battle was in the air. All was now over; it  remained only to succor the wounded and bury the dead--to \"tidy up a  bit,\" as the humorist of a burial squad put it. A good deal of \"tidying  up\" was required. As far as one could see through the forests, among the  splintered trees, lay wrecks of men and horses. Among them moved the  stretcher-bearers, gathering and carrying away the few who showed signs  of life. Most of the wounded had died of neglect while the right to  minister to their wants was in dispute. It is an army regulation that  the wounded must wait; the best way to care for them is to win the  battle. It must be confessed that victory is a distinct advantage to a  man requiring attention, but many do not live to avail themselves of it.    The dead were collected in groups of a dozen or a score and laid side by  side in rows while the trenches were dug to receive them.    Some, found at too great a distance from these rallying points, were  buried where they lay. There was little attempt at identification,  though in most cases, the burial parties being detailed to glean the  same ground which they had assisted to reap, the names of the victorious  dead were known and listed. The enemy's fallen had to be content with  counting. But of that they got enough: many of them were counted several  times, and the total, as given afterward in the official report of the  victorious commander, denoted rather a hope than a result.    At some little distance from the spot where one of the burial parties  had established its \"bivouac of the dead,\" a man in the uniform of a  Federal officer stood leaning against a tree. From his feet upward to  his neck his attitude was that of weariness reposing; but he turned his  head uneasily from side to side; his mind was apparently not at rest. He  was perhaps uncertain in which direction to go; he was not likely to  remain long where he was, for already the level rays of the setting sun  straggled redly through the open spaces of the wood and the weary  soldiers were quitting their task for the day. He would hardly make a  night of it alone there among the dead.    Nine men in ten whom you meet after a battle inquire the way to some  fraction of the army--as if any one could know. Doubtless this officer  was lost. After resting himself a moment he would presumably follow one  of the retiring burial squads.    When all were gone he walked straight away into the forest toward the  red west, its light staining his face like blood. The air of confidence  with which he now strode along showed that he was on familiar ground; he  had recovered his bearings. The dead on his right and on his left were  unregarded as he passed.

Hymn 1:145.  Christ and Aaron. Taken from Heb. 7. and 9.    1 Jesus, in thee our eyes behold  A thousand glories more  Than the rich gems and polish'd gold  The sons of Aaron wore.    2 They first their own burnt-offerings brought  To purge themselves from sin;  Thy life was pure without a spot,  And all thy nature clean.    3 [Fresh blood as constant as the day  Was on their altar spilt;  But thy one offering takes away  For ever all our guilt.]    4 [Their priesthood ran thro' several hands.  For mortal was their race;  Thy never-changing office stands  Eternal as thy days.]    5 [Once in the circuit of a year  With blood, but not his own,  Aaron within the veil appears  Before the golden throne;    6 But Christ by his own powerful blood  Ascends above the skies,  And in the presence of our God  Shews his own sacrifice.]    7 Jesus, the King of Glory, reigns  On Sion's heavenly hill,  Looks like a lamb that has been slain,  And wears his priesthood still.    8 He ever lives to intercede  Before his Father's face;  Give him, my soul, thy cause to plead,  Nor doubt the Father's grace.      Hymn 1:146.  Characters of Christ, borrowed from inanimate  things, in scripture.    1 Go, worship at Immanuel's feet,  See in his face what wonders meet;  Earth is too narrow to express  His worth, his glory, or his grace.    2 [The whole creation can afford  But some faint shadows of my Lord:  Nature to make his beauties known  Must mingle colours not her own.]    3 [Is he compar'd to wine or bread?

The world receives  Salvation from his healing leaves;  That righteous branch, that fruitful bough,  Is David's root and offspring too.]    5 [Is he a rose? Not Sharon yields  Such fragrancy in all her fields:  Or if the lily he assume,  The vallies bless the rich perfume.]    6 [Is he a vine? His heavenly root  Supplies the boughs with life and fruit:  O let a lasting union join  My soul the branch to Christ the vine:    7 [Is he the head? Each member lives,  And owns the vital powers he gives;  The saints below, and saints above,  Join'd by his Spirit and his love.]    8 [Is he a fountain? There I bathe,  And heal the plague of sin and death  These waters all my soul renew,  And cleanse my spotted garments too.]    9 [Is he a fire? he'll purge my dross,  But the true gold sustains no loss;  Like a refiner shall he sit,  And tread the refuse with his feet.]    10 [Is he a rock?

He leads to God,  The path is drawn in lines of blood;  There would I walk with hope and zeal,  Till I arrive at Sion's hill.]    12 [Is he a door? I'll enter in  Behold the pastures large and green,  A paradise divinely fair,  None but the sheep have freedom there.]    13 [Is he design'd a corner-stone,  For men to build their heaven upon?

I adore  Th'indwelling majesty and power;  And still to this most holy place,  Whene'er I pray, I turn my face.]    15 [Is he a star? He breaks the night,  Piercing the shades with dawning light;  I know his glories from afar,  I know the bright, the morning-star.]    16 [Is he a sun? His beams are grace,  His course is joy, and righteousness;  Nations rejoice when he appears  To chase their clouds, and dry their tears.    17 O let me climb those higher skies,  Where storms and darkness never rise!

Nor art, nor nature can supply  Sufficient forms of majesty.    2 Bright image of the Father's face,  Shining with undiminish'd rays;  Th' eternal God's eternal Son,  The heir, and partner of his throne.]    3 The King of kings, the Lord most high,  Writes his own Name upon his thigh:  He wears a garment dipt in blood,  And breaks the nations with his rod.    4 Where grace can neither melt nor move  The Lamb resents his injur'd love,  Awakes his wrath without delay,  And Judah's Lion tears the prey.    5 But when for works of peace he comes,  What winning titles he assumes!  \"Light of the World, and Life of Men;\"  Nor bears those characters in vain.    6 With tender pity in his heart  He acts the Mediator's part;  A friend and brother he appears,  And well fulfils the names he wears.    7 At length the Judge his throne ascends,  Divides the rebels from his friends,  And saints in full fruition prove  His rich variety of love.      Hymn 1:148. As the 148th Psalm.  The same.    1 [With cheerful voice I sing  The titles of my Lord,  And borrow all the names  Of honour from his word:  Nature and art  Can ne'er supply  Sufficient forms  Of majesty.    2 In Jesus we behold  His Father's glorious face,  Shining for ever bright  With mild and lovely rays:  Th' eternal God's  Eternal Son  Inherits and  Partakes the throne.]    3 The sovereign King of kings,  The Lord of lords most high,  Writes his own name upon  His garment and his thigh:  His Name is call'd  \"The Word of God;\"  He rules the earth  With iron rod.    4 Where promises and grace  Can neither melt nor move,  The angry Lamb resents  The injuries of his love;  Awakes his wrath  Without delay,  As lions roar  And tear the prey.    5 But when for works of peace  The great Redeemer comes,  What gentle characters,  What titles he assumes!  \"Light of the world,  \"And Life of men\"  "]]]
