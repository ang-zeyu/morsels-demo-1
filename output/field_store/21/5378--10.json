Mr. Stirling conducts his traffic at a higher rate of speed, and  certainly with equal punctuality, with his magnificent single 8 ft.  engines, as Mr. Webb on the North-Western with coupled engines, and the  economy of fuel of the former class over the latter is very remarkable;  this is, no doubt, owing, as has been previously pointed out, to their  ample cylinder power, which permits of the steam being worked at a high  rate of expansion. There is no doubt that if single engines can take the  load they will do so more freely and at a less cost than coupled engines,  burning on the average 2 lb. of coal per mile less with similar trains.  With, regard to loads, it is a question whether any express train should  be made up with more than twenty-five coaches. The Great Northern engine  will take twenty-six and keep time, and the Brighton single engine has  taken the five P.M. express from London Bridge to Brighton, consisting of  twenty-two coaches, at a speed of forty-five miles per hour. Of course  where heavy gradients have to be surmounted, such as those on the Midland  route to Scotland, coupled engines are a necessity. Single engines are  said to slip more than coupled; thus an 8 ft. single Great Northern engine  running down the incline from Potter's Bar to Wood Green with twelve  coaches at the rate of sixty miles an hour was found to be making 242  revolutions per mile instead of 210; and in an experiment tried on the  Midland Railway it was found that a coupled engine with ten coaches at  fifty miles an hour made seventeen extra revolutions a mile, but when the  side rods were removed it made forty-three. The Great Western, Great  Northern, and Brighton mainly employ single engines for their fast  traffic; and the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire have now adopted  the single type in preference to the coupled for their express trains;  while the North-Western, Midland, South-Western, and Chatham adopted the  coupled type. One noticeable feature in modern practice is the increased  height of the center line of boiler; formerly it was the great aim to keep  this low, and numerous schemes to this effect were propounded, but now it  has become generally recognized that a high pitched engine will travel as  steadily and more safely round a curve--given a good road--than a low  pitched one; and thus while in 1850 the average height of the center line  of boilers varied between 5 ft. 3 in. and 6 ft. 3 in., now in the latest  designs it lies between 7 ft. and 7 ft. 6 in. Single frames are very  generally adopted, but double frames and outside bearings to the leading  and trailing wheels, as in the Great Western engines, give great  steadiness in running, and this class has also double bearings to the  driving wheels, thus entailing greater security in case of the facture of  a crank axle. The general adoption of cabs on the foot-plate for the men  is another improvement of late introduction, although at first not  universally appreciated by those for whose comfort it was designed--\"I  felt as if I was in my coffin,\" said an old driver when asked how he liked  the new shelter. Mild steel fire-boxes, which have been employed in  America, are not in favor here, copper being universally used; they have  been tried on the Caledonian, Great Southern and Western, North London,  and North-Western, and were found not to succeed. Brake blocks of cast  iron have now generally superseded wood; steel is being more and more  used, especially on the North Western. There is less use of brasswork for  domes and fittings, although it is claimed for brass that it looks  brighter and can easily be kept clean. There is greater simplicity of  design generally, and the universal substitution of coal as coke for fuel,  with its consequent economy; and last, but not least, the adoption of  standard types of engines, are among the changes which have taken place in  locomotive practice during the past quarter of a century.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--LONDON, CHATHAM, & DOVER RAILWAY.]    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--GREAT EASTERN RAILWAY.]    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--MANCHESTER, SHEFFIELD, AND LINCOLNSHIRE RAILWAY.]    Having now reviewed, as far as the limits of this paper will allow, the  locomotive practice of the present day, the author would in conclusion  draw attention to what may possibly be one course of locomotive  development in the future. Time is money, and it may be in the coming  years that a demand will arise for faster means of transit than that which  we possess at present. How can we meet it? With our railways laid out with  the curves and gradients existing, and with our national gauge, and our  present type of locomotive, no great advance in speed is very probable;  the mean speed of express trains is about fifty miles an hour, and to take  an average train of 200 tons weight at this speed over a level line  requires between 650 and 700 effective horse-power, within the compass of  the best engines of the present day. But if instead of fifty miles an hour  seventy is required, an entirely different state of things obtains. Taking  a train of 100 tons, with engine and tender weighing 75 tons, or 175 tons  gross, the first question to determine will be the train resistance, and  with reference to this we much want careful experiments on the subject,  like those which Sir Daniel Gooch made in 1848, on the Bristol and Exeter  Railway, which are even now the standard authority; the general use of oil  axle-boxes and long bogie coaches, irrespective of other improvements,  would render this course desirable. With regard to the former, they appear  to run with less friction, but are heavier to start, oil boxes in some  experiments made on the South-Western Railway giving a resistance of 2.5  lb. per ton, while grease boxes ranged from 6 lb. to 9 lb. per ton. Again,  the long and heavy bogie Pullman and other coaches have the reputation  among drivers, rightly or wrongly, of being hard to pull. The resistance  of an express train on the Great Western Railway at seventy-five miles an  hour was 42 lb. per ton, and taking 40 lb. per ton for seventy miles an  hour would give a total resistance on the level of 7,000 lb.,  corresponding to 1,400 horse-power--about double the average duty of an  express engine of the present day. The weight on the driving wheels  required would be 183/4 tons, allowing one-sixth for adhesion, about the  same as that on the driving axle of the Bristol and Exeter old bogie  engines. Allowing 21/2 lb. of coal per horse-power per hour would give a  total combustion of 3,500 lb. per hour and to burn this even at the  maximum economic rate of 85 lb. per square foot of grate per hour would  require a grate area of 41 square feet, and about 2,800 square feet of  heating surface. Unless a most exceptional construction combined with  small wheels is adopted, it appears almost impossible to get this amount  on the ordinary gauge. It is true the Wootten locomotives on the  Philadelphia and Reading Railway have fire-boxes with a grate area of as  much as 76 square feet, but these boxes extend clean over the wheels, and  the heating surface in the tubes is only 982 square feet; but although  these engines run at a speed of forty-two miles an hour, they are hardly  the type to be adopted for such a service as is being considered. On the  broad gauge, however, such an engine could easily be designed on the lines  now recognized as being essential for express engines without introducing  any exceptional construction, and there appears but little doubt that were  Brunei's magnificent gauge the national one, competition would have  introduced a higher rate of speed between London and our great towns than  that which obtains at present.    The whole question of the future introduction of trunk lines, exclusively  for fast passenger traffic, is fraught with the highest interest, but it  would be foreign to the subject matter of this paper to enter more fully  on it, the author merely desiring to state his opinion that if the future  trade and wealth of our country require their construction, and if a very  high rate of speed much above our present is to be attained, their gauge  will have to be seriously considered and settled, not by the reasons which  caused the adoption of the present gauge, but by the power required to  carry on the traffic--in fact, to adapt the rail to the engine, and not,  as at present, the engine to the rail. High speed requires great power,  and great power can only be obtained by ample fire-grate area, which for a  steady running engine means a broad gauge. The Gauge Commissioners of 1846  in their report esteemed the importance of the highest speed on express  trains for the accommodation of a comparatively small number of persons,  however desirable that may be to them, as of far less moment than  affording increased convenience to the general commercial traffic of the  country. The commercial traffic of England has grown and prospered under  our present system, and if its ever increasing importance demands high  speed passenger lines, we may rest assured that the ingenuity of man, to  which it is impossible to assign limits, will satisfactorily solve the  problem.           *       *       *       *       *          SCREW STEAM COLLIER FROSTBURG.

The luminous projection apparatus illustrated herewith, when adapted to  a balance of precision, permits of effecting weighings very rapidly. For  the same approximation, the velocity of oscillation becomes five or six  times greater, and, by the method employed, the last centigrammes and  the milligrammes and their fractions are estimated directly, with  immediate verification. As the apparatus is independent of the parts of  the balance, it can be placed on all the existing laboratory balances of  precision.    [Illustration: PROJECTING APPARATUS FOR BALANCES OF PRECISION.]    The modification introduced into the balance consists in the displacing  of the center of gravity of the beam in such a way as to diminish the  sensitiveness, and consequently to obtain a much greater velocity, and  then, by optical means, to considerably increase the amplitude of the  oscillations.    Instead of the oscillations being observed through the microscope, they  are projected upon a divided screen forming a dial, the division of  which is seen by transmitted light.    The apparatus consists of a small achromatic objective placed at the  extremity of the tube of a microscope, in which there is a divided  screen that receives the enlarged image of the reticule fixed upon the  needle. Upon this reticule are projected the rays (condensed by a  powerful lens) that come from a luminous source placed behind the  balance. The focusing is done by means of a rack and pinion.    The luminous source employed is a gas burner with reflector. This is  placed in a walnut box in order to prevent any projection of heat upon  the balance. This burner, thus isolated, is lighted for but one or two  minutes at a maximum, at the end of each weighing. So, on fixing a  thermometer in the cage, we find that no variation, ever so slight,  occurs in the temperature. In order to effect a weighing, the gas being  turned down to a taper, we proceed as with an ordinary balance until the  extremity of the needle no longer emerges from the lower dial. Then we  count the difference of the number of the divisions made by the needle  to the right and left of zero. This difference, multiplied by the  approximate value, in milligrammes, of each division of this dial (value  given by the instrument) immediately gives the number of centigrammes  and milligrammes that must be added to the weights already placed upon  the pan of the balance in order to obtain an equilibrium, to about a  half division of the lower dial.    The value of each division of this dial varies from 3 to 10 milligrammes  according as the balance shows 0.1 or 0.5 milligramme. As the dial has  10 divisions on each side of the central mark, we thus estimate, without  tentatives, the three last centigrammes or the last decigramme,  according to the sensitiveness.    At this moment the doors of the cage are closed, in order to prevent  draughts of air, the gas is turned on by means of a regulating cock, and  the balance is manipulated by first lowering the beam and then bringing  the pans to a standstill. We then read the difference of the divisions  traversed to the left and right upon the luminous dial through the image  of the reticule. The images are reversed upon the dial, but practice  soon causes this petty difficulty to disappear. This number of divisions  indicates the number of milligrammes and fractions of a milligramme by  which it is necessary to shift the counterpoise on its arm in order to  obtain a perfect equilibrium, which latter is verified by a simple  reading. Every half division of the dial corresponds, as to weight, to  the sensitiveness indicated for the instrument.    With a little practice a weighing effected as above described takes but  a quarter or a fifth of the time that it does with an ordinary  balance.--_Revue Industrielle._           *       *       *       *       *          STARCHES FOR THE FINISHING OF COTTON FABRICS.      The starches have been classified by Dr. Muter, according to the  appearance they give under the microscope, into five groups:    _Class I_.--Hilum and concentric rings visible. All the granules, oval  or ovate. Tous-le-mois, potato, arrowroot, etc.    _Class II_.--The concentric rings are all but invisible, the hilum is  stellate. Maize, pea, bean, etc.    _Class III_.--The concentric rings are all but invisible, also the hilum  in the majority of granules. Wheat, barley, rye, chestnut, etc.    _Class IV_.--All the granules truncated at one end. Sago, tapioca, etc.    _Class V_.--All the granules angular in form. Rice, tacca, arrowroot,  oats, etc.    The principal starches used for finishing cotton fabrics are potato  (farina), wheat, Indian corn (maize), rice, tapioca, arrowroot, sago;  the last three not so often as those previously named.

[Footnote: A paper recently read before the Architectural Association,  London.--_From the Architect_.]    By T.R. SPENCE.      I do not propose to enter into any historical details as to the first  and subsequent application of mosaics. In a general sense we understand  mosaic as a combination of various more or less imperishable  materials--fixed together by cement or other adhesive substances--and  laid over walls, floors, etc., with a view to permanent decorative  effect. The substance of the tesserae is of many kinds, namely, glass,  cheap and precious marbles, hard stone, and burnt clay, these mentioned  being mainly in use for architectural purposes. For decorative schemes  we collect as many gradations of color as are obtainable in such durable  materials in their natural or manufactured state, and thus form a color  palette which we regard in the same sense as a painter would his  pigments.    Of course, the first proceeding is to prepare a design on a small scale,  which shall embrace your notions of color only. Then follows a  full-sized cartoon, which I need hardly add shall embrace your best  efforts in drawing. A tracing is made of the latter and transferred to  sheets of cardboard. This cardboard is cut to the size of certain  sections of your design, and, for convenience, should not be more than,  say, 20 in. square. Of course, it will not always be square, but will  bear the same relation to your complete cartoon as a map of the counties  would to that of all England. Now, working from the small design (of  color), the tesserae are cut to the forms required, laid face downward,  and glued on to the cardboard sections containing your enlarged cartoon.  When the design is all worked out on these sections they are ready for  fixing on walls or floor by laying them home on a float of cement. When  the cement sets, the cardboard sticking to the face is washed off, and  the joints of tesserae flushed over with cement and cleaned off, leaving  all joints filled up level.    There are other processes used for the same end. The technical processes  need not occupy our attention at present. There is one process that may  appeal to you, and that is executing the work _in situ_ by floating on a  limited expanse of cement, and sticking on the tesserae at once. It has  the advantage of enabling the artist or architect to see the effect of  his efforts under the fixed conditions of light and height.    I shall confine myself to vitreous or glass mosaic, which for  durability, extended scales of primary colors and their numerous  semi-transparent gradations is unequaled by any substance yet used for  wall or floor decoration. I am surprised, having all these fine  qualities, it is not more used by architects. If you require proofs of  its triumphs, go to St. Mark's, of Venice, and stand under its mellow  golden roof.
