He spent more time at Mrs. Bland's; he walked miles on all the  trails leading out of the valley; he had a care for the condition of his  two horses.    Upon his return from the latest of these tramps Euchre suggested that  they go down to the river to the boat-landing.    \"Ferry couldn't run ashore this mornin',\" said Euchre. \"River gettin'  low an' sand-bars makin' it hard fer hosses. There's a greaser  freight-wagon stuck in the mud. I reckon we might hear news from the  freighters. Bland's supposed to be in Mexico.\"    Nearly all the outlaws in camp were assembled on the riverbank, lolling  in the shade of the cottonwoods. The heat was oppressive. Not an  outlaw offered to help the freighters, who were trying to dig a heavily  freighted wagon out of the quicksand. Few outlaws would work for  themselves, let alone for the despised Mexicans.    Duane and Euchre joined the lazy group and sat down with them. Euchre  lighted a black pipe, and, drawing his hat over his eyes, lay back in  comfort after the manner of the majority of the outlaws. But Duane  was alert, observing, thoughtful. He never missed anything. It was  his belief that any moment an idle word might be of benefit to him.  Moreover, these rough men were always interesting.    \"Bland's been chased across the river,\" said one.    \"New, he's deliverin' cattle to thet Cuban ship,\" replied another.    \"Big deal on, hey?\"    \"Some big. Rugg says the boss hed an order fer fifteen thousand.\"    \"Say, that order'll take a year to fill.\"    \"New. Hardin is in cahoots with Bland. Between 'em they'll fill orders  bigger 'n thet.\"    \"Wondered what Hardin was rustlin' in here fer.\"    Duane could not possibly attend to all the conversation among the  outlaws. He endeavored to get the drift of talk nearest to him.    \"Kid Fuller's goin' to cash,\" said a sandy-whiskered little outlaw.    \"So Jim was tellin' me. Blood-poison, ain't it? Thet hole wasn't bad.  But he took the fever,\" rejoined a comrade.    \"Deger says the Kid might pull through if he hed nursin'.\"    \"Wal, Kate Bland ain't nursin' any shot-up boys these days. She hasn't  got time.\"    A laugh followed this sally; then came a penetrating silence. Some of  the outlaws glanced good-naturedly at Duane. They bore him no ill will.  Manifestly they were aware of Mrs. Bland's infatuation.    \"Pete, 'pears to me you've said thet before.\"    \"Shore. Wal, it's happened before.\"    This remark drew louder laughter and more significant glances at Duane.  He did not choose to ignore them any longer.    \"Boys, poke all the fun you like at me, but don't mention any lady's  name again. My hand is nervous and itchy these days.\"    He smiled as he spoke, and his speech was drawled; but the good humor in  no wise weakened it. Then his latter remark was significant to a class  of men who from inclination and necessity practiced at gun-drawing until  they wore callous and sore places on their thumbs and inculcated in  the very deeps of their nervous organization a habit that made even the  simplest and most innocent motion of the hand end at or near the hip.  There was something remarkable about a gun-fighter's hand. It never  seemed to be gloved, never to be injured, never out of sight or in an  awkward position.    There were grizzled outlaws in that group, some of whom had many notches  on their gun-handles, and they, with their comrades, accorded Duane  silence that carried conviction of the regard in which he was held.    Duane could not recall any other instance where he had let fall a  familiar speech to these men, and certainly he had never before hinted  of his possibilities. He saw instantly that he could not have done  better.    \"Orful hot, ain't it?\" remarked Bill Black, presently. Bill could not  keep quiet for long. He was a typical Texas desperado, had never been  anything else. He was stoop-shouldered and bow-legged from much riding;  a wiry little man, all muscle, with a square head, a hard face partly  black from scrubby beard and red from sun, and a bright, roving, cruel  eye. His shirt was open at the neck, showing a grizzled breast.    \"Is there any guy in this heah outfit sport enough to go swimmin'?\" he  asked.    \"My Gawd, Bill, you ain't agoin' to wash!\" exclaimed a comrade.    This raised a laugh in which Black joined. But no one seemed eager to  join him in a bath.    \"Laziest outfit I ever rustled with,\" went on Bill, discontentedly.  \"Nuthin' to do! Say, if nobody wants to swim maybe some of you'll  gamble?\"    He produced a dirty pack of cards and waved them at the motionless  crowd.    \"Bill, you're too good at cards,\" replied a lanky outlaw.    \"Now, Jasper, you say thet powerful sweet, an' you look sweet, er I  might take it to heart,\" replied Black, with a sudden change of tone.    Here it was again--that upflashing passion. What Jasper saw fit to reply  would mollify the outlaw or it would not. There was an even balance.    \"No offense, Bill,\" said Jasper, placidly, without moving.    Bill grunted and forgot Jasper. But he seemed restless and dissatisfied.  Duane knew him to be an inveterate gambler. And as Benson's place was  out of running-order, Black was like a fish on dry land.    \"Wal, if you-all are afraid of the cairds, what will you bet on?\" he  asked, in disgust.    \"Bill, I'll play you a game of mumbly peg fer two bits.\" replied one.    Black eagerly accepted. Betting to him was a serious matter. The game  obsessed him, not the stakes. He entered into the mumbly peg contest  with a thoughtful mien and a corded brow. He won. Other comrades tried  their luck with him and lost. Finally, when Bill had exhausted their  supply of two-bit pieces or their desire for that particular game, he  offered to bet on anything.    \"See thet turtle-dove there?\" he said, pointing. \"I'll bet he'll scare  at one stone or he won't. Five pesos he'll fly or he won't fly when some  one chucks a stone. Who'll take me up?\"    That appeared to be more than the gambling spirit of several outlaws  could withstand.    \"Take thet. Easy money,\" said one.    \"Who's goin' to chuck the stone?\" asked another.    \"Anybody,\" replied Bill.    \"Wal, I'll bet you I can scare him with one stone,\" said the first  outlaw.    \"We're in on thet, Jim to fire the darnick,\" chimed in the others.    The money was put up, the stone thrown. The turtle-dove took flight, to  the great joy of all the outlaws except Bill.    \"I'll bet you-all he'll come back to thet tree inside of five minnits,\"  he offered, imperturbably.    Hereupon the outlaws did not show any laziness in their alacrity to  cover Bill's money as it lay on the grass. Somebody had a watch, and  they all sat down, dividing attention between the timepiece and the  tree. The minutes dragged by to the accompaniment of various jocular  remarks anent a fool and his money. When four and three-quarter minutes  had passed a turtle-dove alighted in the cottonwood. Then ensued an  impressive silence while Bill calmly pocketed the fifty dollars.    \"But it hadn't the same dove!\" exclaimed one outlaw, excitedly. \"This  'n'is smaller, dustier, not so purple.\"    Bill eyed the speaker loftily.    \"Wal, you'll have to ketch the other one to prove thet. Sabe, pard? Now  I'll bet any gent heah the fifty I won thet I can scare thet dove with  one stone.\"    No one offered to take his wager.    \"Wal, then, I'll bet any of you even money thet you CAN'T scare him with  one stone.\"    Not proof against this chance, the outlaws made up a purse, in no wise  disconcerted by Bill's contemptuous allusions to their banding together.  The stone was thrown. The dove did not fly. Thereafter, in regard to  that bird, Bill was unable to coax or scorn his comrades into any kind  of wager.    He tried them with a multiplicity of offers, and in vain. Then he  appeared at a loss for some unusual and seductive wager. Presently a  little ragged Mexican boy came along the river trail, a particularly  starved and poor-looking little fellow. Bill called to him and gave him  a handful of silver coins. Speechless, dazed, he went his way hugging  the money.    \"I'll bet he drops some before he gits to the road,\" declared Bill.  \"I'll bet he runs. Hurry, you four-flush gamblers.\"    Bill failed to interest any of his companions, and forthwith became  sullen and silent. Strangely his good humor departed in spite of the  fact that he had won considerable.    Duane, watching the disgruntled outlaw, marveled at him and wondered  what was in his mind. These men were more variable than children, as  unstable as water, as dangerous as dynamite.    \"Bill, I'll bet you ten you can't spill whatever's in the bucket thet  peon's packin',\" said the outlaw called Jim.    Black's head came up with the action of a hawk about to swoop.    Duane glanced from Black to the road, where he saw a crippled peon  carrying a tin bucket toward the river. This peon was a half-witted  Indian who lived in a shack and did odd jobs for the Mexicans. Duane had  met him often.    \"Jim, I'll take you up,\" replied Black.    Something, perhaps a harshness in his voice, caused Duane to whirl. He  caught a leaping gleam in the outlaw's eye.    \"Aw, Bill, thet's too fur a shot,\" said Jasper, as Black rested an elbow  on his knee and sighted over the long, heavy Colt. The distance to the  peon was about fifty paces, too far for even the most expert shot to hit  a moving object so small as a bucket.    Duane, marvelously keen in the alignment of sights, was positive that  Black held too high. Another look at the hard face, now tense and dark  with blood, confirmed Duane's suspicion that the outlaw was not aiming  at the bucket at all. Duane leaped and struck the leveled gun out of his  hand. Another outlaw picked it up.    Black fell back astounded. Deprived of his weapon, he did not seem the  same man, or else he was cowed by Duane's significant and formidable  front.

CHAPTER XIV    A SATURDAY RACE      Ada had been watching the others with a contempt she made little attempt  to conceal. When her name was called she walked to the platform and faced  the leader defiantly.    \"What can you do best, Ada?\" came the familiar question.    Ada smiled patronizingly.    \"Spend money,\" she said briefly.    \"Do that,\" said the young leader calmly.    \"How can I spend money here?\" demanded Ada angrily. \"There's nothing to  buy. I call that silly.\"    \"Then you admit you can't spend money?\"    \"No such thing!\" Ada stamped her foot, furious at such stupidity. \"I say  I can't spend it here where there is nothing to buy. You let me go to  Edentown, and I'll show you whether I can spend money or not.\"    \"The order of the first degree of the Mysterious Four is that the  candidate must do what she can do best,\" repeated the veiled figure  insistently. \"What can you do best?\"    \"Sing,\" said Ada sullenly.    \"Then do that.\"    And now the watching girls had what Bobby later admitted was \"the  surprise of their lives.\"    The girl at the piano fingered a chord tentatively, then struck into a  popular song, an appealing little melody, the words a lyric set to music  by a composer with a spark of genius.    \"I picked a rose in my garden fair--\" sang Ada.    She sang without affectation. Her voice was a charming contralto,  evidently partially trained, and promising with coming years to be worth  consideration.    \"But it withered in a day--\" went on the lovely voice.    The girls were absolutely mute. When she had finished the song, and she  gave it all, they burst into a spontaneous storm of applause.    Ada barely acknowledged the hand-clapping. Her face had instantly slipped  back into the old sullen lines.    \"When she can sing like that, shouldn't you think she would be perfectly  happy?\" sighed Betty. \"I'd give anything if I had a voice!\"    As a matter of fact Betty had a clear little contralto of her own and she  sang as naturally as a bird. But there was no denying that Ada's voice  was exceptional.    After the last girl had had her turn the veiled leader mounted the  platform and threw back her swathing net.    \"She's the president of the senior class, Mabel Waters,\" whispered a girl  near Betty.    \"I have the honor to welcome you all as members in good standing of the  novice class, first-degree, Mysterious For,\" announced Miss Waters.  \"That's all there is to the name, girls--when we decided to form a new  society here in school some one asked 'What's it for?' So our  organization became the Mysterious F-O-R, and you'll find out as time  goes on what the answer is. I might say, though, that happiness and good  fellowship and a little spice of sisterliness are what we try to  incorporate in the unwritten bylaws. And now I think Aunt Nancy has some  cake and ice-cream for us.\"    Saturday was a busy day for the one hundred and sixty odd girls who were  enrolled at Shadyside. Penance and pleasure had a way of marking off the  hours. Those who were good were allowed to go twice a month to Edentown,  chaperoned by a teacher, for shopping, moving picture treats, and such  other simple pleasures as the small city afforded. There were always a  number of girls sentenced to \"within bounds,\" which were the spacious  school grounds, for minor sins of omission and commission. Bobby Littell  was usually among these. She was impulsive and heedless, and got herself  into hot water with amazing regularity.    \"Bobby,\" announced Betty, one Saturday morning not long after the  initiation into the Mysterious For, \"don't you think you could manage to  have a good record this coming week? We want to go nutting a week from  to-day, and if you have to stay in bounds it will spoil all the fun.\"    \"I'll try my best,\" promised Bobby solemnly. \"I never mean to do a  thing, Betty. Trouble is, I think afterward. I did want to go to  Edentown to-day, too, but Libbie and Frances have promised to get the  wool for my sweater. Want to come down to the gym? I'm going to drill my  squad this morning.\"    In the gymnasium they found Ada Nansen, also in charge of a squad.    \"She flunked twice in French and was impudent to Madame,\" whispered  Bobby, who knew all the school gossip. \"Mrs. Eustice canceled her  Edentown permit.\"    Ada frankly scowled at the newcomers. She had found the Littell girls  slow to overtures of friendship, and they persisted in displaying an  annoying fancy for the society of Betty and the Guerin girls, who, for  all Ada knew, might be what she described to her mother as \"perfect  nobodies.\" So Ada and Ruth Royal gradually formed a circle of their own  to which gravitated the more snobbish girls, those who fought, openly or  covertly, the rule for simple dressing, and those who found in Ada's  characteristics of petty meanness, worship of money, and social  aspirations a response to similar urgings of their own natures.    \"Well, Bobby, I'm glad to see you and your 'men,'\" said Miss Anderson  briskly. \"I was just saying to Ada that to-day is too beautiful to waste  indoors. I want you all to come out on the campus and we'll have a race.\"    Bobby's squad included Betty--who had refused to leave her chum--the  Guerin girls (who refused to go to Edentown because it was almost  impossible to avoid spending money for little luxuries and for  treats), Constance Howard and Dora Estabrooke, a fat girl who was  good-nature itself.    \"We'll have to use elimination,\" said the teacher when she had her pupils  out on the green level that was back of the gymnasium and walled in by  tall Lombardy poplars planted closely. \"Let's see, twelve of you\" (for  Ada's squad numbered the same). \"I think we'll number off first.\"    The odd numbers in each squad fell out and were matched, and the even  numbers were paired similarly. Betty's rival was a near-sighted girl who  delayed the next step because Miss Anderson discovered that she was  wearing high-heeled shoes.    \"I don't care for those flat things,\" volunteered Violet Canby, as she  departed lockerward at Miss Anderson's stern insistence. \"I have a very  high instep, and they hurt me.\"    Nevertheless, she had to wear them, and the physical instructor put the  others through a rigid inspection, but bloomers and sneakers were all  properly donned.    \"Now,\" said Miss Anderson when Violet had returned minus her pumps, \"try  to remember that it's just like a spelling match, girls; gradually we'll  narrow down to the two best runners.\"    The trial \"heats\" resulted in leaving Betty, Bobby and Norma of the one  squad, and Ada, Ruth and a girl named Edith Harrison, of the other.    Norma was paired with Ruth Royal, and at the signal they got away nicely.  Norma was an excellent runner, and she reached the tape fully three yards  ahead of Ruth. Something in her glowing, happy face, prompted Ruth to  resentment.    \"Oh, well,\" she remarked disdainfully, taking care that her words should  carry clearly, \"I suppose a farmer's daughter does a good deal of running  after cows--they ought to be in training.\"    Norma flushed scarlet.    \"My father is a doctor,\" she said hotly. \"I'm not a farmer's daughter,  but I know splendid girls who are--girls too well-bred to say a thing  like that.\"    Ruth walked away--she was out of the finals now--and Norma went back to  the starting place. She had not recovered her poise when the time came  for her to race Bobby, and that young person won easily only to be  outdistanced by Betty.    Rather to the latter's regret, she found herself the opponent of Ada for  the deciding race.    \"Go it, Betty--beat her!\" whispered Bobby, proud of her chum. \"She and  Ruth Royal have dispositions like vinegar barrels!\"    Betty had often raced with Bob, and she ran like a boy herself--head  down, elbows held in. She was running that way, against Ada, when  something suddenly shunted her off sideways. She fell, landing in a  little heap. High and sharp rose the shrill whistle of the starter.    \"Are you hurt, Betty?\" demanded Miss Anderson, running up to the dazed  girl and lifting her to her feet. \"Ada Nansen that was absolutely the  most unsportsmanlike trick I ever saw. You've lost the race on a foul.  Betty was clearly winning when you tripped her.\"    \"I didn't,\" muttered Ada, but she refused to meet her teacher's eyes.    \"I don't want a race on a foul,\" argued Betty pluckily, for her skinned  elbow was smarting madly. \"Let's begin over.\"    She had her way, too, and this time won without interference, though Ada  was so furious that Bobby was seriously concerned.    \"She looks mad enough to put something in your soup,\" she told Betty, as  they went in to dress and have Betty's elbow attended to. \"What is it,  Caroline?\"    \"Two young gentlemen to see you, Miss Bobby and Miss Betty,\" announced  the maid importantly. \"They is waiting in the parlor. Mrs. Eustice says  you all should go right up.\"    In the parlor the girls found two slim, uniformed young figures who rose  like well-set-up ramrods at their entrance.    \"Bob!\" ejaculated Betty, her voice betraying her pleasure. \"Bob, you look  splendid!\"    Tommy Tucker glanced hopefully at Bobby.    \"Don't I look splendid, too?\" he asked.    \"You're overshadowed by Bob,\" said Bobby mischievously. \"However, when  not compared with him, I dare say you look rather well.\"          CHAPTER XV    NORMA MAKES REPAIRS      This had to content the Tucker twin who took Bobby's chaffing  good-humoredly.    Bob Henderson did indeed look very well. The uniform was most becoming,  and though he was studying hard to make up for lack of preparation, his  clear eyes and skin and firm muscles told of a wise schedule that  included plenty of"]]]
