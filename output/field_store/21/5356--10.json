When it was suggested to Douglass that the  Haytians were given to revolution as a mode of expressing disapproval  of their rulers, he replied that a four years' rebellion had been  fought and two Presidents assassinated in the United States during a  comparatively peaceful political period in Hayti. His last official  connection with the Black Republic was at the World's Columbian  Exposition at Chicago in 1893, where he acted as agent in charge  of the Haytian Building and the very creditable exhibit therein  contained. His stately figure, which age had not bowed, his strong  dark face, and his head of thick white hair made him one of the  conspicuous features of the Exposition; and many a visitor took  advantage of the occasion to recall old acquaintance made in the  stirring anti-slavery days.    In 1878 he revisited the Lloyd plantation in Maryland, where he had  spent part of his youth, and an affecting meeting took place between  him and Thomas Auld, whom he had once called master. Once in former  years he had been sought out by the good lady who in his childhood had  taught him to read. Nowhere more than in his own accounts of these  meetings does the essentially affectionate and forgiving character of  Douglass and his race become apparent, and one cannot refrain from  thinking that a different state of affairs might prevail in the  Southern States if other methods than those at present in vogue were  used to regulate the relations between the two races and their various  admixtures that make up the Southern population.    In June, 1879, a bronze bust of Douglass was erected in Sibley Hall of  Rochester University as a tribute to one who had shed lustre on the  city. In 1882 occurred the death of Douglass's first wife, whom he had  married in New York immediately after his escape from slavery, and who  had been his faithful companion through so many years of stress and  struggle. In the same year his _Life and Times_ was published. In 1884  he married Miss Helen Pitts, a white woman of culture and refinement.  There was some criticism of this step by white people who did not  approve of the admixture of the races, and by colored persons who  thought their leader had slighted his own people when he overlooked  the many worthy and accomplished women among them. But Douglass, to  the extent that he noticed these strictures at all, declared that he  had devoted his life to breaking down the color line, and that he did  not know any more effectual way to accomplish it; that he was white by  half his blood, and, as he had given most of his life to his mothers  race, he claimed the right to dispose of the remnant as he saw fit.    The latter years of his life were spent at his beautiful home known as  Cedar Hill, on Anacostia Heights, near Washington, amid all      \"that which should accompany old age,    As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends.\"    He possessed strong and attractive social qualities, and his home  formed a Mecca for the advanced and aspiring of his race. He was  a skilful violinist, and derived great pleasure from the valuable  instrument he possessed. A wholesome atmosphere always surrounded him.  He had never used tobacco or strong liquors, and was clean of speech  and pure in life.    He died at his home in Washington, February 20, 1895. He had been  perfectly well during the day, and was supposed to be in excellent  health. He had attended both the forenoon and afternoon sessions of  the Women's National Council, then in session at Washington, and had  been a conspicuous figure in the audience. On his return home, while  speaking to his wife in the hallway of his house, he suddenly fell,  and before assistance could be given he had passed away.    His death brought forth many expressions from the press of the land,  reflecting the high esteem in which he had been held by the public  for a generation. In various cities meetings were held, at which  resolutions of sorrow and appreciation were passed, and delegations  appointed to attend his funeral. In the United States Senate a  resolution was offered reciting that in the person of the late  Frederick Douglass death had borne away a most illustrious citizen,  and permitting the body to lie in state in the rotunda of the Capitol  on Sunday. The immediate consideration of the resolution was asked  for. Mr. Gorman, of Maryland, the State which Douglass honored by his  birth, objected; and the resolution went over.    Douglass's funeral took place on February 25, 1895, at the  Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, and was  the occasion of a greater outpouring of colored people than had taken  place in Washington since the unveiling of the Lincoln emancipation  statue in 1878. The body was taken from Cedar Hill to the church at  half-past nine in the morning; and from that hour until noon thousands  of persons, including many white people, passed in double file through  the building and viewed the body, which was in charge of a guard of  honor composed of members of a colored camp of the Sons of Veterans.  The church was crowded when the services began, and several thousands  could not obtain admittance. Delegations, one of them a hundred  strong, were present from a dozen cities. Among the numerous floral  tributes was a magnificent shield of roses, orchids, and palms, sent  by the Haytian government through its minister. Another tribute was  from the son of his old master. Among the friends of the deceased  present were Senators Sherman and Hoar, Justice Harlan of the Supreme  Court, Miss Susan B. Anthony, and Miss May Wright Sewall, president  of the Women's National Council. The temporary pall-bearers were  ex-Senator B. K. Bruce and other prominent colored men of Washington.  The sermon was preached by Rev. J. G. Jenifer. John E. Hutchinson, the  last of the famous Hutchinson family of abolition singers, who with  his sister accompanied Douglass on his first voyage to England, sang  two requiem solos, and told some touching stories of their old-time  friendship. The remains were removed to Douglass's former home in  Rochester, where he was buried with unusual public honors.    In November, 1894, a movement was begun in Rochester, under the  leadership of J. W. Thompson, with a view to erect a monument in  memory of the colored soldiers and sailors who had fallen during the  Civil War. This project had the hearty support and assistance of  Douglass; and upon his death the plan was changed, and a monument to  Douglass himself decided upon. A contribution of one thousand dollars  from the Haytian government and an appropriation of three thousand  dollars from the State of New York assured the success of the plan.  September 15, 1898, was the date set for the unveiling of the  monument; but, owing to delay in the delivery of the statue, only a  part of the contemplated exercises took place. The monument, complete  with the exception of the statue which was to surmount it, was  formally turned over to the city, the presentation speech being made  by Charles P. Lee of Rochester. A solo and chorus composed for the  occasion were sung, an original poem read by T. Thomas Fortune, and  addresses delivered by John C. Dancy and John H. Smyth. Joseph H.  Douglass, a talented grandson of the orator, played a violin solo, and  Miss Susan B. Anthony recalled some reminiscences of Douglass in the  early anti-slavery days.    In June, 1899, the bronze statue of Douglass, by Sidney W. Edwards,  was installed with impressive ceremonies. The movement thus to  perpetuate the memory of Douglass had taken rise among a little band  of men of his own race, but the whole people of Rochester claimed  the right to participate in doing honor to their distinguished  fellow-citizen. The city assumed a holiday aspect. A parade of  military and civic societies was held, and an appropriate programme  rendered at the unveiling of the monument. Governor Roosevelt of New  York delivered an address; and the occasion took a memorable place in  the annals of Rochester, of which city Douglass had said, \"I shall  always feel more at home there than anywhere else in this country.\"    In March, 1895, a few weeks after the death of Douglass, Theodore  Tilton, his personal friend for many years, published in Paris, of  which city he was then a resident, a volume of _Sonnets to the Memory  of Frederick Douglass_, from which the following lines are quoted as  the estimate of a contemporary and a fitting epilogue to this brief  sketch of so long and full a life:      \"I knew the noblest giants of my day,      And _he_ was _of_ them--strong amid the strong:      But gentle too: for though he suffered wrong,    Yet the wrong-doer never heard him say,    'Thee also do I hate.' ...          A lover's lay--      No dirge--no doleful requiem song--      Is what I owe him; for I loved him long;    As dearly as a younger brother may.      Proud is the happy grief with which I sing;    For, O my Country! in the paths of men    There never walked a grander man than he!      He was a peer of princes--yea, a king!    Crowned in the shambles and the prison-pen!    The noblest Slave that ever God set free!\"          Bibliography      The only original sources of information concerning the early life of  Frederick Douglass are the three autobiographies published by him  at various times; and the present writer, like all others who have  written of Mr. Douglass, has had to depend upon this personal record  for the incidents of Mr. Douglass's life in slavery. As to the second  period of his life, his public career as anti-slavery orator and  agitator, the sources of information are more numerous and varied.

I should think  that you could tell by the color of my shell that I have had a fire  lighted on my back many times. In fact, I like it, as I am always  so cold.\"    So the monkeys decided that they would punish Ca Boo-Ug by throwing  him into the pond and drowning him.    \"Boo-hoo!\" cried Ca Boo-Ug, \"don't do that! You will surely kill  me. Please don't do that! Boo-hoo! Boo-hoo!\"    Of course when the monkeys found that Ca Boo-Ug did not wish to be  thrown into the pond, they thought they had found just the way to kill  him. So, in spite of his struggles, they picked him up and threw him  far out into the pond.    To their surprise and chagrin, Ca Boo-Ug stuck his head out of the  water and laughed at them, and then turned around and swam off.    When the monkeys saw how they had been deceived, they were very  much disappointed, and began to plan how they could catch Ca Boo-Ug  again. So they called to a big fish, named Botete, that lived in  the pond:    \"Botete! Drink all you can of the water in the pond and help us  find the bag of gold that we hid in it. If you will help us find it,  you shall have half of the gold.\"    So Botete began to drink the water, and in a little time the pond  was nearly dry. Then the monkeys determined to go down into the pond  and look for Ca Boo-Ug. When he saw them coming, Ca Boo-Ug called  to Salacsacan, the kingfisher, who was sitting on a branch of a tree  which hung over the water:--    \"Salacsacan! Salacsacan! Botete has drunk all the water in the pond,  and if there is no water there will be no fish for you to catch. Fly  down now and peck a hole in Botete, and let the water out, before the  fish are all dead.\" So Salacsacan flew down and pecked a hole in the  side of Botete, and the water rushed out and drowned all the monkeys.    When Ca Boo-Ug saw that the monkeys were all dead, he crawled up on  the bank, and there he lived happily ever after.      Another version ends as follows:--      When the monkeys saw how they had been deceived, they were very  much disappointed and began to plan how they could catch Ca Boo-Ug  again. They decided to drink all the water in the pond, and then they  could catch Ca Boo-Ug before he could escape. So they drank and drank,  until they all burst.    When Ca Boo-Ug saw that the monkeys were all dead, he crawled up on  the bank, and there he lived happily ever after.        W. H. Millington and Berton L. Maxfield.    Brooklyn, N.Y.          PART III    Tagalog Folk-Tales.      CHAPTER 1    Juan Gathers Guavas. [9]    The guavas were ripe, and Juan's father sent him to gather enough  for the family and for the neighbors who came to visit them. Juan  went to the guava bushes and ate all that he could hold. Then he  began to look around for mischief. He soon found a wasp nest and  managed to get it into a tight basket. He gave it to his father  as soon as he reached home, and then closed the door and fastened  it. All the neighbors were inside waiting for the feast of guavas,  and as soon as the basket was opened they began to fight to get out  of the windows. After a while Juan opened the door and when he saw  his parents' swollen faces, he cried out, \"What rich fine guavas  those must have been! They have made you both so very fat.\"      CHAPTER 2    Juan Makes Gulay of his own Child.    After Juan was married about a year a baby was born, and he and  his wife loved it very much. But Juan was always obedient to his  wife, being a fool, and when she told him to make gulay or stew he  inquired of her of what he should make it. She replied of anac, [10]  meaning anac hang gabi. [11] Then she went away for a while, and when  she returned Juan had the gulay ready. She asked for the baby and  was horrified to learn that Juan had made a stew of his own child,  having taken her words literally.      CHAPTER 3    Juan Wins a Wager for the Governor.    Juan was well known for a brave man, though a fool, and the priest and  the governor wished to try him on a wager. The governor told him that  the priest was dead, and ordered him to watch the body in the church  that night. The priest lay down on the bier before the altar, and  after Juan came the priest arose. Juan pushed him down again and ran  out of the church and secured a club. Returning, he said to the priest,  \"You are dead; try to get up again and I will break you to pieces.\" So  Juan proved himself to be a brave man, and the governor won his wager.        CHAPTER 4    Juan Hides the Salt.    Juan's father came into possession of a sack of salt, which used to  be very precious and an expensive commodity. He wished it hidden in a  secure place and so told Juan to hide it till they should need it. Juan  went out and after hunting for a long time hid it in a carabao wallow,  and of course when they went to fetch it again nothing was left but  the sack.      CHAPTER 5    The Man in the Shroud.    Juan, being a joker, once thought to have a little fun at others'  expense, so he robed himself in a shroud, placed a bier by the  roadside, set candles around it, and lay down so that all who went by  should see him and be frightened. A band of robbers went by that way,  and seeing the corpse, besought it to give them luck. As it happened,  they were more than usually fortunate, and when they returned they  began to make offerings to him to secure continuance of their good  fortune. As the entire proceeds of their adventures were held in  common, they soon began to quarrel over the offerings to be made. The  captain became angry, and drew his sword with a threat to run the  corpse through for causing so much dissension among his men.    This frightened the sham dead man to such a degree that he jumped up  and ran away, and the robbers, who were even more frightened than he,  ran the other way, leaving all their plunder.    Juan then returned and gathered all the money and valuables left  behind by the robbers, and carried them home. Now he had a friend  who was very curious to know how he came into possession of so much  wealth, and so Juan told him, only he said nothing about robbers,  but told his friend, whose name was Pedro, that the things were the  direct reward of God for his piety.    Pedro, being afraid of the woods, decided to lie just inside the church  door; besides, that being a more sacred place, he felt sure that God  would favor him even more than Juan. He arranged his bier with the  candles around him, and lay down to await the shower of money that  should reward his devotions. When the sacristan went to the church  to ring the bell for vespers, he saw the body lying there, and not  knowing of any corpse having been carried in, he was frightened  and ran to tell the padre. The padre, when he had seen the body,  said it was a miracle, and that it must be buried within the church,  for the sanctification of the edifice.    But Pedro, now thoroughly frightened, jumped off the bier and ran away,  and the priest and the sacristan ran the other way, so the poor man  never received the reward for his piety, and the church was deprived  of a new patron saint.        CHAPTER 6    The Adventures of Juan.    Juan was lazy, Juan was a fool, and his mother never tired of scolding  him and emphasizing her words by a beating. When Juan went to school  he made more noise at his study than anybody else, but his reading  was only gibberish.    His mother sent him to town to buy meat to eat with the boiled rice,  and he bought a live crab which he set down in the road and told to  go to his mother and be cooked for dinner. The crab promised, but as  soon as Juan's back was turned ran in the other direction.    Juan went home after a while and asked for the crab, but there was  none, and they ate their rice without ulam. [12] His mother then  went herself and left Juan to care for the baby. The baby cried and  Juan examined it to find the cause, and found the soft spot on its  head. \"Aha! It has a boil. No wonder it cries!\" And he stuck a knife  into the soft spot, and the baby stopped crying. When his mother came  back, Juan told her about the boil and that the baby was now asleep,  but the mother said it was dead, and she beat Juan again.    Then she told Juan that if he could do nothing else he could at least  cut firewood, so she gave him a bolo and sent him to the woods.    He found what looked to him like a good tree and prepared to cut it,  but the tree was a magic tree and said to Juan, \"Do not cut me and I  will give you a goat that shakes silver money from its whiskers.\" Juan  agreed, and the bark of the tree opened and the goat came out, and  when Juan told him to shake his whiskers, money dropped out. Juan was  very glad, for at last he had something he would not be beaten for. On  his way home he met a friend, and told him of his good fortune. The  man made him dead drunk and substituted another goat which had not  the ability to shake money from its whiskers, and when the new goat  was tried at home poor Juan was beaten and scolded.    Back he went to the tree, which he threatened to cut down for lying  to him, but the tree said, \"No, do not kill me and I will give you  a magic net which you may cast even on dry ground or into a tree-top  and it will return full of fish,\" and the tree did even so.    Again he met the friend, again he drank tuba [13] until he was dead  drunk, and again a worthless thing was substituted, and on reaching  home he was beaten and scolded.    Once more Juan went to the magic tree, and this time he received a  magic pot, always full of rice; and spoons always full of whatever  ulam might be wished, and these went the way of the other gifts,  to the false friend.    The fourth time he asked of the tree he was given a magic stick  that would without hands beat and kill anything that the owner  wished. \"Only say to it 'Boombye, boomba,' and it"]]]
