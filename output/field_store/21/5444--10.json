The seals of the case were broken and the violin  identified by the widow as that of her husband. The Springers waived all  claim to the violin, and the Court dismissed the indictment against the  defendant and ordered the Stradivarius to be delivered to Mrs. Bott,  with these words:    \"Mrs. Bott, it affords very great pleasure to the Court to give the  violin to you. You have suffered many years of sorrow and trouble in  regard to it.\"    \"Eight years,\" sighed the old lady, clasping the violin in her arms.    \"I wish you a great deal of pleasure in its possession,\" continued the  Recorder.    Thus ended, as a matter of record, the case of The People against  Flechter. For eight years the violin dealer and his family had endured  the agony of disgrace, he had spent a fortune in his defense, and had  nevertheless been convicted of a crime of which he was at last proved  innocent.    Yet, there are those who, when the case is mentioned, shake their heads  wisely, as if to say that the whole story of the lost Stradivarius has  never been told.          IV    The Last of the Wire-Tappers          \"Sir,\" replied the knave unabashed, \"I am one of those who do make a      living by their wits.\"    John Felix, a dealer in automatic musical instruments in New York City,  was swindled out of $50,000 on February 2d, 1905, by what is commonly  known as the \"wire-tapping\" game. During the previous August a man  calling himself by the name of Nelson had hired Room 46, in a building  at 27 East Twenty-second Street, as a school for \"wireless telegraphy.\"  Later on he had installed over a dozen deal tables, each fitted with a  complete set of ordinary telegraph instruments and connected with wires  which, while apparently passing out of the windows, in reality plunged  behind a desk into a small \"dry\" battery. Each table was fitted with a  shaded electric drop-light, and the room was furnished with the ordinary  paraphernalia of a telegraph office. The janitor never observed any  activity in the \"school.\" There seemed to be no pupils, and no one  haunted the place except a short, ill-favored person who appeared  monthly and paid the rent.    On the afternoon of February 1st, 1905, Mr. Felix was called to the  telephone of his store and asked to make an appointment later in the  afternoon, with a gentleman named Nelson who desired to submit to him a  business proposition. Fifteen minutes afterward Mr. Nelson arrived in  person and introduced himself as having met Felix at \"Lou\" Ludlam's  gambling house. He then produced a copy of the _Evening Telegram_ which  contained an article to the effect that the Western Union Telegraph  Company was about to resume its \"pool-room service,\"--that is to say, to  supply the pool rooms with the telegraphic returns of the various  horse-races being run in different parts of the United States. The paper  also contained, in connection with this item of news, a photograph which  might, by a stretch of the imagination, have been taken to resemble  Nelson himself.    Mr. Felix, who was a German gentleman of French sympathies, married to  an American lady, had recently returned to America after a ten years'  sojourn in Europe. He had had an extensive commercial career, was  possessed of a considerable fortune, and had at length determined to  settle in New York, where he could invest his money to advantage and at  the same time conduct a conservative and harmonious business in musical  instruments. Like the Teutons of old, dwelling among the forests of the  Elbe, Mr. Felix knew the fascination of games of chance and he had heard  the merry song of the wheel at both Hambourg and Monte Carlo. In Europe  the pleasures of the gaming table had been comparatively inexpensive,  but in New York for some unknown reason the fickle goddess had not  favored him and he had lost upward of $51,000. \"Zu viel!\" as he himself  expressed it. Being of a philosophic disposition, however, he had  pocketed his losses and contented himself with the consoling thought  that, whereas he might have lost all, he had in fact lost only a part.  It might well have been that had not The Tempter appeared in the person  of his afternoon visitor, he would have remained _in status quo_ for the  rest of his natural life. In the sunny window of his musical store,  surrounded by zitherns, auto-harps, dulcimers, psalteries, sackbuts, and  other instrument's of melody, the advent of Nelson produced the effect  of a sudden and unexpected discord. Felix distrusted him from the very  first.    The \"proposition\" was simplicity itself. It appeared that Mr. Nelson was  in the employ of the Western Union Telegraph Company, which had just  opened a branch office for racing news at 27 East Twenty-second Street.  This branch was under the superintendence of an old associate and  intimate friend of Nelson's by the name of McPherson. Assuming that they  could find some one with the requisite amount of cash, they could all  make their everlasting fortunes by simply having McPherson withhold the  news of some race from the pool rooms long enough to allow one of the  others to place a large bet upon some horse which had in fact already  won and was resting comfortably in the stable. Felix grasped the idea  instantly. At the same time he had his suspicions of his visitor. It  seemed peculiar that he, an inconspicuous citizen who had already lost  $50,000 in gambling houses, should be selected as the recipient of such  a momentous opportunity. Moreover, he knew very well that gentlemen in  gambling houses were never introduced at all. He thought he detected the  odor of a rodent. He naively inquired why, if all these things were so,  Nelson and his friend were not already yet millionaires two or three  times? The answer was at once forthcoming that they _had_ been, but also  had been robbed--unmercifully robbed, by one in whom they had had  confidence and to whom they had entrusted their money.    \"And now we are poor, penniless clerks!\" sighed Nelson, \"and if we  should offer to make a big bet ourselves, the gamblers would be  suspicious and probably refuse to place it.\"    \"I think this looks like a schvindling game,\" said Felix shrewdly. So it  did; so it was.    By and by Felix put on his hat and, escorted by Nelson, paid a visit to  the \"branch office\" at 27 East Twenty-second Street. Where once solitude  had reigned supreme and the spider had spun his web amid the  fast-gathering dust, all was now tumultuous activity. Fifteen busy  operators in eye shades and shirt sleeves took the news hot from the  humming wires and clicked it off to the waiting pool rooms.    \"Scarecrow wins by a neck!\" cried one, \"Blackbird second!\"    \"Make the odds 5 to 3,\" shouted a short, ill-favored man, who sat at a  desk puffing a large black cigar. The place buzzed like a beehive and  ticked like a clockmaker's. It had an atmosphere of breathless  excitement all its own. Felix watched and marvelled, wondering if dreams  came true.    The short, ill-favored man strolled over and condescended to make Mr.  Felix's acquaintance. An hour later the three of them were closeted  among the zitherns. At the same moment the fifteen operators were ranged  in a line in front, of a neighboring bar, their elbows simultaneously  elevated at an angle of forty-five degrees.    Felix still had lingering doubts. Hadn't Mr. McPherson some little  paper--a letter, a bill, a receipt or a check, to show that he was  really in the employ of the Western Union? No, said \"Mac,\" but he had  something better--the badge which he had received as the fastest  operator among the company's employees. Felix wanted to see it, but  \"Mac\" explained that it was locked up in the vault at the Farmers' Loan  and Trust Co. To Felix this had a safe sound--\"Farmers' Trust Co.\" Then  matters began to move rapidly. It was arranged that Felix should go down  in the morning and get $50,000 from his bankers, Seligman and Meyer.  After that he was to meet Nelson at the store and go with him to the  pool room where the big financiers played their money. McPherson was to  remain at the \"office\" and telephone them the results of the races in  advance. By nightfall they would be worth half a million.    \"I hope you have a good large safe,\" remarked Nelson, tentatively. The  three conspirators parted with mutual expressions of confidence and  esteem.    Next morning Mr. Felix went to his bankers and procured $50,000 in five  ten-thousand-dollar bills. The day passed very slowly. There was not  even a flurry in zitherns. He waited impatiently for Nelson who was to  come at five o'clock. At last Nelson arrived and they hurried to the  Fifth Avenue Hotel where the _coup_ was to take place.    And now another marvel. Wassermann Brothers' stock-brokering office,  which closes at three hummed just as the \"office\" had done the evening  before--and with the very same bees, although Felix did not recognize  them. It was crowded with men who struggled violently with one another  in their eagerness to force their bets into the hands of a  benevolent-looking person, who, Felix was informed, was the \"trusted  cashier\" of the establishment. And the sums were so large that even  Felix gasped.    \"Make that $40,000 on Coco!\" cried a bald-headed \"capper.\"    \"Mr. Gates wants to double his bet on Jackstone,--make it $80,000!\"  shrieked another.    \"Gentlemen! Gentlemen!\" begged the \"trusted cashier,\" \"not quite so  fast, if you please. One at a time.\"    \"Sixty thousand on Hesper--for a place!\" bawled one addressed as \"Mr.  Keene,\" while Messrs. \"Ryan,\" \"Whitney,\" \"Belmont,\" \"Sullivan,\"  \"McCarren,\" and \"Murphy\" all made handsome wagers.    From time to time a sporty-looking man standing beside a ticker, shouted  the odds and read off the returns. Felix heard with straining ears:    \"They're off!\"    \"Baby leads at the quarter.\"    \"Susan is gaining!\"    \"They're"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13177"],[0,"Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes and Home Made Candy Recipes (#13)"],[1," fondant  and knead it into a round ball; then roll it lightly under the fingers  into a long strip the shape and size of a lead pencil; form as many of  these strips as desired; cut the strips into two-inch lengths and let  stand to become firm. Have ready the \"Dot\" Chocolate melted over hot  water and in this coat the prepared sticks leaving the surface a little  rough.      ALMOND FONDANT BALLS    [Illustration: ALMOND FONDANT BALLS.]    Roll part of the almond fondant into small balls. Some of the \"Dot\"  Chocolate will be left after dipping the almond chocolate sticks. Remelt  this over hot water, and in it coat the balls lightly. As each ball is  coated with the chocolate drop it onto a plate of chopped pistachio nut  meats or of chopped cocoanut (fresh or dessicated). With a spoon  sprinkle the chopped material over the balls.      WALNUT CREAM-CHOCOLATES    [Illustration: WALNUT CREAM CHOCOLATES.]        2-1/2 cups of granulated sugar,      1/2 a cup of condensed milk,      1/2 a cup of water,      3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of thick caramel syrup,      A little water,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla,      1/2 a pound of Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Put the sugar, condensed milk and water over the fire to boil, stir  gently but often, and let cook to the soft ball stage, or to 238 deg.F. Pour  on a damp marble and let stand undisturbed until cold; turn to a cream,  then gather into a compact mass; cover with a bowl and let stand for  thirty minutes; then knead the cream; put it into a double boiler; add  the caramel syrup and the vanilla; stir constantly while the mixture  becomes warm and thin; add a tablespoonful or two of water, if  necessary, and drop the cream mixture into impressions made in  cornstarch. Use two teaspoons to drop the cream. When the candy is cold,  pick it from the starch. With a small brush remove the starch that  sticks to the candy shapes. Coat each piece with \"Dot\" Chocolate. As  each piece is coated and dropped onto the oil cloth, set half an English  walnut meat upon the top.      TO MOLD CANDY IN STARCH IMPRESSIONS    Many candies, especially such as are of some variety of fondant, are  thin when warm and solidify on the outside when cold, so that they may  be \"dipped\" or coated with chocolate. To shape candy of this sort, fill  a low pan with cornstarch, making it smooth upon the top. Have ready  molds made of plaster paris, glued to a thin strip of wood, press these  into the cornstarch; lift from the starch and repeat the impressions as  many times as the space allows. If molds are not available a thimble,  round piece of wood, or the stopper of an oil or vinegar cruet will  answer the purpose, though the impressions must be made one at a time.      CHOCOLATE BUTTER CREAMS    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE BUTTER CREAMS.]        2-1/2 cups of sugar,      1/2 a cup of water,      1/4 a cup of glucose,      1/4 a cup of butter,      2-1/2 ozs of Baker's Premium Chocolate,      2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla,      1/2 a pound of Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Put the sugar, water, glucose and butter over the fire; stir until the  sugar is melted, then cook to the soft ball degree, or 236 deg. F.; pour on  a damp marble and leave until cold; then pour on the Premium Chocolate,  melted over hot water, and with a spatula turn to a cream. This process  is longer than with the ordinary fondant. Cover the chocolate fondant  with a bowl and let stand for thirty minutes; knead well and set over  the fire in a double boiler; add the vanilla and stir until melted. The  mixture is now ready to be dropped into small impressions in starch;  when cold and brushed free of starch dip in \"Dot\" Chocolate. When  dropping the chocolate mixture into the starch it should be just soft  enough to run level on the top. If too soft it will not hold its shape  in coating.      FONDANT FOR SOFT CHOCOLATE CREAMS        2-1/2 cups of sugar,      1/3 a cup of glucose (pure corn syrup),      1 cup of water.    Put the sugar, glucose and water over the fire and stir until boiling,  then wash down the sides of the saucepan, cover and finish cooking as in  making ordinary fondant. Let cook to 238 deg. F. Turn the syrup onto a damp  marble or platter and _before it becomes cold_ turn to a cream with a  wooden spatula. When the fondant begins to stiffen, scrape at once into  a bowl and cover with a damp cloth, but do not let the cloth touch the  fondant. Use this fondant in the following recipes.      ROSE CHOCOLATE CREAMS        Fondant,      Damask rose color-paste,      1/2 to 1 whole teaspoonful of rose extract,      1/2 a pound of Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Put a part or the whole of the fondant into a double boiler over boiling  water. With the point of a toothpick take up a little of the color-paste  and add to the fondant; add the extract and stir until the mixture is  hot, thin and evenly tinted. With two teaspoons drop the mixture into  impressions made in starch; it should be hot and thin enough to run  level on top. When the shapes are cold, remove from the starch, brush  carefully and coat with \"Dot\" Chocolate.    [Illustration: ROSE AND PISTACHIO CHOCOLATE CREAMS.]      PISTACHIO CHOCOLATE CREAMS        Fondant,      Green color-paste,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract,      1/8 a teaspoonful of almond extract,      Pistachio nuts in slices and halves,      1/2 a pound of Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Using green color-paste, vanilla and almond extract mold the fondant in  long shapes. Put a bit of nut in each impression, before filling it with  fondant. When firm coat with \"Dot\" Chocolate and set half a pistachio  nut on top.      SURPRISE CHOCOLATE CREAMS    [Illustration: SURPRISE CHOCOLATE CREAMS.]        Fondant,      Candied or Maraschino cherries,      Flavoring of almond or vanilla,      Chopped peanuts,      1/2 a pound of Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Melt the fondant over hot water and add the flavoring. Put a bit of  cherry in the bottom of each starch impression, then turn in the melted  fondant, to fill the impressions and have them level on the top. Let the  chocolate, broken in bits, be melted over warm water, then add as many  chopped peanuts as can be well stirred into it; let cool to about 80 deg. F.  and in it drop the creams, one at a time; as coated dispose them on  table oil cloth or waxed paper.      CHOCOLATE PEANUT BRITTLE    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE PEANUT BRITTLE.]        1-1/2 cups of sugar,      2/3 a cup of water,      1/2 a cup of glucose (pure corn syrup),      2 level tablespoonfuls of butter,      1/2 a pound of _raw_ shelled peanuts,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract,      1 level teaspoonful of soda,      1 tablespoonful of cold water,      1/2 a pound or more of Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Put the sugar, water and glucose over the fire; stir till the sugar is  dissolved; wash down the sides of the saucepan with a cloth or the  fingers dipped in cold water, cover and let boil three or four minutes,  then uncover and let cook to 275 deg. F. (when a little is cooled and chewed  it clings but does not stick to the teeth) add the butter and peanuts  and _stir constantly_ until the peanuts are nicely browned (or are of  the color of well roasted peanuts). Dissolve the soda in the cold water,  add the vanilla and the soda and stir vigorously. When the candy is  through foaming, turn it onto a warm and well-oiled marble or platter.  As soon as it has cooled a little on the edges, take hold of it at the  edge and pull out as thin as possible. Loosen it from the receptacle at  the center by running a spatula under it, then turn the whole sheet  upside down, and again pull as thin as possible. Break into small pieces  and when cold coat with \"Dot\" Chocolate prepared as in previous recipes.  Half of a roasted peanut may be set upon each piece as coated. Note that  the peanuts used in the brittle are raw. The small Spanish peanuts are  the best for this purpose. After the peanuts are shelled, cover them  with boiling water, let boil up once, then skim out and push off the  skin, when they are ready to use.      CHOCOLATE POP CORN BALLS    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE POP CORN BALLS.]        1-1/2 cups of sugar,      1/3 a cup of glucose,      2/3 a cup of water,      1/3 a cup of molasses,      3 tablespoonfuls of butter,      3 squares of Baker's Premium Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract,      About 4 quarts of popped corn, well salted.    Set the sugar, glucose and water over the fire, stir until the sugar is  melted, then wash down the sides of the saucepan, cover and let boil  three or four minutes, then remove the cover and let cook without  stirring to the hard ball degree; add the molasses and butter and stir  constantly until brittle in cold water; remove from the fire and, as  soon as the bubbling ceases, add the chocolate, melted over hot water,  and the vanilla; stir, to mix the chocolate evenly through the candy,  then pour onto the popped corn, mixing the two together meanwhile. With  buttered hands lightly roll the mixture into small balls. Press the  mixture together only just enough to hold it in shape. Discard all the  hard kernels in the corn. Have the corn warm and in a warm bowl.      CHOCOLATE MOLASSES KISSES    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE MOLASSES KISSES.]        2 cups of coffee A sugar,      1/3 a cup of glucose, (pure corn syrup),      2/3 a cup of water,      1 cup of molasses,      2 tablespoonfuls of butter,      1/4 a teaspoonful of salt,      4 ounces of Baker's Premium Chocolate,      1 tablespoonful of vanilla extract, or      1 teaspoonful of essence of peppermint.    Put all the ingredients, save the salt, chocolate and flavoring, over  the fire; let boil rapidly to 260 deg.F., or until brittle when tested in  cold water. During the last of the cooking the candy must be stirred  constantly. Pour onto an oiled platter or marble; pour the chocolate,  melted over hot water, above the candy; as the candy cools on the edges,  with a spatula or the"]]]
