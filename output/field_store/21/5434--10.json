But the repetition  in Nature seemed sometimes to be an excited repetition, like that of  an angry schoolmaster saying the same thing over and over again.  The grass seemed signalling to me with all its fingers at once;  the crowded stars seemed bent upon being understood.  The sun would  make me see him if he rose a thousand times.  The recurrences of the  universe rose to the maddening rhythm of an incantation, and I began  to see an idea.         All the towering materialism which dominates the modern mind  rests ultimately upon one assumption; a false assumption.  It is  supposed that if a thing goes on repeating itself it is probably dead;  a piece of clockwork.  People feel that if the universe was personal  it would vary; if the sun were alive it would dance.  This is a  fallacy even in relation to known fact.  For the variation in human  affairs is generally brought into them, not by life, but by death;  by the dying down or breaking off of their strength or desire.  A man varies his movements because of some slight element of failure  or fatigue.  He gets into an omnibus because he is tired of walking;  or he walks because he is tired of sitting still.  But if his life  and joy were so gigantic that he never tired of going to Islington,  he might go to Islington as regularly as the Thames goes to Sheerness.  The very speed and ecstasy of his life would have the stillness  of death.  The sun rises every morning.  I do not rise every morning;  but the variation is due not to my activity, but to my inaction.  Now, to put the matter in a popular phrase, it might be true that  the sun rises regularly because he never gets tired of rising.  His routine might be due, not to a lifelessness, but to a rush  of life.  The thing I mean can be seen, for instance, in children,  when they find some game or joke that they specially enjoy.  A child  kicks his legs rhythmically through excess, not absence, of life.  Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit  fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged.  They always say, \"Do it again\"; and the grown-up person does it  again until he is nearly dead.  For grown-up people are not strong  enough to exult in monotony.  But perhaps God is strong enough  to exult in monotony.  It is possible that God says every morning,  \"Do it again\" to the sun; and every evening, \"Do it again\" to the moon.  It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike;  it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired  of making them.  It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy;  for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we.  The repetition in Nature may not be a mere recurrence; it may be  a theatrical ENCORE.  Heaven may ENCORE the bird who laid an egg.  If the human being conceives and brings forth a human child instead  of bringing forth a fish, or a bat, or a griffin, the reason may not  be that we are fixed in an animal fate without life or purpose.  It may be that our little tragedy has touched the gods, that they  admire it from their starry galleries, and that at the end of every  human drama man is called again and again before the curtain.  Repetition may go on for millions of years, by mere choice, and at  any instant it may stop.  Man may stand on the earth generation  after generation, and yet each birth be his positively last  appearance.         This was my first conviction; made by the shock of my childish  emotions meeting the modern creed in mid-career. I had always vaguely  felt facts to be miracles in the sense that they are wonderful:  now I began to think them miracles in the stricter sense that they  were WILFUL.  I mean that they were, or might be, repeated exercises  of some will.  In short, I had always believed that the world  involved magic:  now I thought that perhaps it involved a magician.  And this pointed a profound emotion always present and sub-conscious;  that this world of ours has some purpose; and if there is a purpose,  there is a person.  I had always felt life first as a story:  and if there is a story there is a story-teller.         But modern thought also hit my second human tradition.  It went against the fairy feeling about strict limits and conditions.  The one thing it loved to talk about was expansion and largeness.  Herbert Spencer would have been greatly annoyed if any one had  called him an imperialist, and therefore it is highly regrettable  that nobody did.  But he was an imperialist of the lowest type.  He popularized this contemptible notion that the size of the solar  system ought to over-awe the spiritual dogma of man.  Why should  a man surrender his dignity to the solar system any more than to  a whale?  If mere size proves that man is not the image of God,  then a whale may be the image of God; a somewhat formless image;  what one might call an impressionist portrait.  It is quite futile  to argue that man is small compared to the cosmos; for man was  always small compared to the nearest tree.  But Herbert Spencer,  in his headlong imperialism, would insist that we had in some  way been conquered and annexed by the astronomical universe.  He spoke about men and their ideals exactly as the most insolent  Unionist talks about the Irish and their ideals.  He turned mankind  into a small nationality.  And his evil influence can be seen even  in the most spirited and honourable of later scientific authors;  notably in the early romances of Mr. H.G.Wells. Many moralists  have in an exaggerated way represented the earth as wicked.  But Mr. Wells and his school made the heavens wicked. We should lift  up our eyes to the stars from whence would come our ruin.         But the expansion of which I speak was much more evil than all this.  I have remarked that the materialist, like the madman, is in prison;  in the prison of one thought.  These people seemed to think it  singularly inspiring to keep on saying that the prison was very large.  The size of this scientific universe gave one no novelty, no relief.  The cosmos went on for ever, but not in its wildest constellation  could there be anything really interesting; anything, for instance,  such as forgiveness or free will.  The grandeur or infinity  of the secret of its cosmos added nothing to it.  It was like  telling a prisoner in Reading gaol that he would be glad to hear  that the gaol now covered half the county.  The warder would  have nothing to show the man except more and more long corridors  of stone lit by ghastly lights and empty of all that is human.  So these expanders of the universe had nothing to show us except  more and more infinite corridors of space lit by ghastly suns  and empty of all that is divine.         In fairyland there had been a real law; a law that could be broken,  for the definition of a law is something that can be broken.  But the machinery of this cosmic prison was something that could  not be broken; for we ourselves were only a part of its machinery.  We were either unable to do things or we were destined to do them.  The idea of the mystical condition quite disappeared; one can neither  have the firmness of keeping laws nor the fun of breaking them.  The largeness of this universe had nothing of that freshness and  airy outbreak which we have praised in the universe of the poet.  This modern universe is literally an empire; that is, it was vast,  but it is not free.  One went into larger and larger windowless rooms,  rooms big with Babylonian perspective; but one never found the smallest  window or a whisper of outer air.         Their infernal parallels seemed to expand with distance;  but for me all good things come to a point, swords for instance.  So finding the boast of the big cosmos so unsatisfactory to my  emotions I began to argue about it a little; and I soon found that  the whole attitude was even shallower than could have been expected.  According to these people the cosmos was one thing since it had  one unbroken rule.  Only (they would say) while it is one thing,  it is also the only thing there is.  Why, then, should one worry  particularly to call it large?  There is nothing to compare it with.  It would be just as sensible to call it small.  A man may say,  \"I like this vast cosmos, with its throng of stars and its crowd  of varied creatures.\"  But if it comes to that why should not a  man say, \"I like this cosy little cosmos, with its decent number  of stars and as neat a provision of live stock as I wish to see\"?  One is as good as the other; they are both mere sentiments.  It is mere sentiment to rejoice that the sun is larger than the earth;  it is quite as sane a sentiment to rejoice that the sun is no larger  than it is.  A man chooses to have an emotion about the largeness  of the world; why should he not choose to have an emotion about  its smallness?         It happened that I had that emotion.  When one is fond of  anything one addresses it by diminutives, even if it is an elephant  or a life-guardsman. The reason is, that anything, however huge,  that can be conceived of as complete, can be conceived of as small.  If military moustaches did not suggest a sword or tusks a tail,  then the object would be vast because it would be immeasurable.  But the  moment you can imagine a guardsman you can imagine a small guardsman.  The moment you really see an elephant you can call it \"Tiny.\"  If you can make a statue of a thing you can make a statuette of it.  These people professed that the universe was one coherent thing;  but they were not fond of the universe.  But I was frightfully fond  of the universe and wanted to address it by a diminutive.  I often  did so; and it never seemed to mind.  Actually and in truth I did feel  that these dim dogmas of vitality were better expressed by calling  the world small than by calling it large.

An' they jest froze up--thet dark set look  thet makes them strange an' different to me. But I could tell the  difference between thet first natural twinge of conscience an' the later  look of some secret thing. An' the difference I caught was thet they  couldn't help themselves. They hadn't no say in the matter. They looked  as if their bein' unfaithful to you was bein' faithful to a higher duty.  An' there's the secret. Why it's as plain as--as sight of my gun here.\"    \"Plain!... My herds to wander in the sage--to be stolen! Jane Withersteen  a poor woman! Her head to be brought low and her spirit broken!... Why,  Judkins, it's plain enough.\"    \"Miss Withersteen, let me get what boys I can gather, an' hold the white  herd. It's on the slope now, not ten miles out--three thousand head,  an' all steers. They're wild, an' likely to stampede at the pop of a  jack-rabbit's ears. We'll camp right with them, en' try to hold them.\"    \"Judkins, I'll reward you some day for your service, unless all is  taken from me. Get the boys and tell Jerd to give you pick of my horses,  except Black Star and Night. But--do not shed blood for my cattle nor  heedlessly risk your lives.\"    Jane Withersteen rushed to the silence and seclusion of her room, and  there could not longer hold back the bursting of her wrath. She went  stone-blind in the fury of a passion that had never before showed its  power. Lying upon her bed, sightless, voiceless, she was a writhing,  living flame. And she tossed there while her fury burned and burned, and  finally burned itself out.    Then, weak and spent, she lay thinking, not of the oppression that would  break her, but of this new revelation of self. Until the last few days  there had been little in her life to rouse passions. Her forefathers  had been Vikings, savage chieftains who bore no cross and brooked no  hindrance to their will. Her father had inherited that temper; and at  times, like antelope fleeing before fire on the slope, his people fled  from his red rages. Jane Withersteen realized that the spirit of wrath  and war had lain dormant in her. She shrank from black depths hitherto  unsuspected. The one thing in man or woman that she scorned above all  scorn, and which she could not forgive, was hate. Hate headed a flaming  pathway straight to hell. All in a flash, beyond her control there  had been in her a birth of fiery hate. And the man who had dragged her  peaceful and loving spirit to this degradation was a minister of God's  word, an Elder of her church, the counselor of her beloved Bishop.    The loss of herds and ranges, even of Amber Spring and the Old Stone  House, no longer concerned Jane Withersteen, she faced the foremost  thought of her life, what she now considered the mightiest problem--the  salvation of her soul.    She knelt by her bedside and prayed; she prayed as she had never prayed  in all her life--prayed to be forgiven for her sin to be immune from  that dark, hot hate; to love Tull as her minister, though she could not  love him as a man; to do her duty by her church and people and those  dependent upon her bounty; to hold reverence of God and womanhood  inviolate.    When Jane Withersteen rose from that storm of wrath and prayer for help  she was serene, calm, sure--a changed woman. She would do her duty as  she saw it, live her life as her own truth guided her. She might never  be able to marry a man of her choice, but she certainly never would  become the wife of Tull. Her churchmen might take her cattle and horses,  ranges and fields, her corrals and stables, the house of Withersteen and  the water that nourished the village of Cottonwoods; but they could not  force her to marry Tull, they could not change her decision or break  her spirit. Once resigned to further loss, and sure of herself, Jane  Withersteen attained a peace of mind that had not been hers for a year.  She forgave Tull, and felt a melancholy regret over what she knew he  considered duty, irrespective of his personal feeling for her. First  of all, Tull, as he was a man, wanted her for himself; and secondly,  he hoped to save her and her riches for his church. She did not believe  that Tull had been actuated solely by his minister's zeal to save her  soul. She doubted her interpretation of one of his dark sayings--that  if she were lost to him she might as well be lost to heaven. Jane  Withersteen's common sense took arms against the binding limits of her  religion; and she doubted that her Bishop, whom she had been taught had  direct communication with God--would damn her soul for refusing to marry  a Mormon. As for Tull and his churchmen, when they had harassed her,  perhaps made her poor, they would find her unchangeable, and then she  would get back most of what she had lost. So she reasoned, true at last  to her faith in all men, and in their ultimate goodness.    The clank of iron hoofs upon the stone courtyard drew her hurriedly  from her retirement. There, beside his horse, stood Lassiter, his dark  apparel and the great black gun-sheaths contrasting singularly with his  gentle smile. Jane's active mind took up her interest in him and her  half-determined desire to use what charm she had to foil his evident  design in visiting Cottonwoods. If she could mitigate his hatred of  Mormons, or at least keep him from killing more of them, not only would  she be saving her people, but also be leading back this bloodspiller to  some semblance of the human.    \"Mornin', ma'am,\" he said, black sombrero in hand.    \"Lassiter I'm not an old woman, or even a madam,\" she replied, with her  bright smile. \"If you can't say Miss Withersteen--call me Jane.\"    \"I reckon Jane would be easier. First names are always handy for me.\"    \"Well, use mine, then. Lassiter, I'm glad to see you. I'm in trouble.\"    Then she told him of Judkins's return, of the driving of the red herd,  of Venters's departure on Wrangle, and the calling-in of her riders.    \"'Pears to me you're some smilin' an' pretty for a woman with so much  trouble,\" he remarked.    \"Lassiter! Are you paying me compliments? But, seriously I've made up  my mind not to be miserable. I've lost much, and I'll lose more.  Nevertheless, I won't be sour, and I hope I'll never be unhappy--again.\"    Lassiter twisted his hat round and round, as was his way, and took his  time in replying.    \"Women are strange to me. I got to back-trailin' myself from them long  ago. But I'd like a game woman. Might I ask, seein' as how you take this  trouble, if you're goin' to fight?\"    \"Fight! How? Even if I would, I haven't a friend except that boy who  doesn't dare stay in the village.\"    \"I make bold to say, ma'am--Jane--that there's another, if you want  him.\"    \"Lassiter!... Thank you. But how can I accept you as a friend? Think!  Why, you'd ride down into the village with those terrible guns and kill  my enemies--who are also my churchmen.\"    \"I reckon I might be riled up to jest about that,\" he replied, dryly.    She held out both hands to him.    \"Lassiter! I'll accept your friendship--be proud of it--return it--if I  may keep you from killing another Mormon.\"    \"I'll tell you one thing,\" he said, bluntly, as the gray lightning  formed in his eyes. \"You're too good a woman to be sacrificed as you're  goin' to be.... No, I reckon you an' me can't be friends on such terms.\"    In her earnestness she stepped closer to him, repelled yet fascinated by  the sudden transition of his moods. That he would fight for her was at  once horrible and wonderful.    \"You came here to kill a man--the man whom Milly Erne--\"    \"The man who dragged Milly Erne to hell--put it that way!... Jane  Withersteen, yes, that's why I came here. I'd tell so much to no other  livin' soul.... There're things such a woman as you'd never dream of--so  don't mention her again. Not till you tell me the name of the man!\"    \"Tell you! I? Never!\"    \"I reckon you will. An' I'll never ask you. I'm a man of strange beliefs  an' ways of thinkin', an' I seem to see into the future an' feel things  hard to explain. The trail I've been followin' for so many years  was twisted en' tangled, but it's straightenin' out now. An', Jane  Withersteen, you crossed it long ago to ease poor Milly's agony. That,  whether you want or not, makes Lassiter your friend. But you cross it  now strangely to mean somethin to me--God knows what!--unless by your  noble blindness to incite me to greater hatred of Mormon men.\"    Jane felt swayed by a strength that far exceeded her own. In a clash of  wills with this man she would go to the wall. If she were to influence  him it must be wholly through womanly allurement. There was that about  Lassiter which commanded her respect. She had abhorred his name; face  to face with him, she found she feared only his deeds. His mystic  suggestion, his foreshadowing of something that she was to mean to him,  pierced deep into her mind. She believed fate had thrown in her way the  lover or husband of Milly Erne. She believed that through her an evil  man might be reclaimed. His allusion to what he called her blindness  terrified her. Such a mistaken idea of his might unleash the bitter,  fatal mood she sensed in him. At any cost she must placate this man; she  knew the die was cast, and that if Lassiter did not soften to a woman's  grace and beauty and wiles, then it would be because she could not make  him.    \"I reckon you'll hear no more such talk from me,\" Lassiter went on,  presently. \"Now, Miss Jane, I rode in to tell you that your herd of  white steers is down on the slope behind them big ridges. An' I seen  somethin' goin' on that'd be mighty interestin' to you, if you could see  it. Have you a field-glass?\"    \"Yes, I have two glasses. I'll get them and ride out with you. Wait,  Lassiter, please,\" she said, and hurried within. Sending word to Jerd to  saddle Black Star and fetch him to the court, she then went "]]]
