Every time I do this, association processes are being set up  in the brain between the auditory centres and the centres of phonation; and  when I try to revive in my silent thoughts the melody again, I do so best  by humming aloud a few bars of the melody to start the revival and then  continuing the revival by maintaining the resonator in the position of  humming the tune, viz. with closed lips, so that the sound waves can only  escape through the nose; under such circumstances the only definite  conscious muscular sensation I have is from the effect of closure of the  lips; the sensations from the larynx are either non-existent or quite  ill-defined, although I hear mentally the tonal sensations of the melody.  No doubt by closing the lips in silent humming I am in some way  concentrating attention to the sensori-motor sphere of phonation and  articulation, and by reactive association with the auditory sphere  reinforcing the tonal sensations in the mind. The vocal cords (ligaments)  themselves contain very few nerve fibres; those that are seen in the deeper  structures of the cords and adjacent parts mainly proceed to the mucous  glands. This fact, which I have ascertained by numerous careful  examinations, is in accordance with the fact that there are no conscious  kinaesthetic impressions of alterations of position and tension of the vocal  cords. A comparative microscopic examination of the tip of the tongue and  the lips shows a remarkable difference, for these structures are beset with  innumerable sensory nerves, whereby every slightest alteration of tension  and minute variations in degrees of pressure of the covering skin is  associated with messages thereon to the brain. The sense of movement in  articulate speech is therefore explained by this fact. There is every  reason then to believe that auditory tonal images are the sole primary and  essential guides to the minute alterations of tension in the muscles of the  larynx necessary for the production of corresponding vocal sounds. By  humming a tune we concentrate our attention and thereby limit the activity  of neural processes to systems and communities of neurones employed for the  perception of tonal images and their activation in motor processes; and  this helps to fix the tune in the memory.          PSYCHIC MECHANISM OF THE VOICE      A musical speaking voice denotes generally a good singing voice, and it  must be remembered that articulation cannot be separated from phonation in  the psychic mechanism. In speaking, we are unconscious of the breath  necessary for the production of the voice. Not so, however, in effective  singing, the management of the breathing being of fundamental importance;  and it is no exaggeration to say that only the individual who knows how to  breathe knows how to sing effectually. A musical ear and sense of rhythm  are innate in some individuals; in others they are not innate and can only  be acquired to a variable degree of perfection by persevering efforts and  practice. The most intelligent persons may never be able to sing in tune,  or even time; the latter (sense of rhythm) is much more easily acquired by  practice than the former (correct intonation). This is easily intelligible,  for rhythmical movement appertains also to speech and other acts of human  beings, e.g. walking, dancing, running, swimming, etc.; moreover,  rhythmical periodicity characterises the beat of the heart and respiration.    But how does a trained singer learn to sing a song or to take part in an  opera? He has to study the performances of two parts for the vocal  instrument--the part written by the composer and the part written by the  poet or dramatist--and in order to present an artistic rendering, the  intellectual and emotional characters of each part must be blended in  harmonious combination. A singer will first read the words and understand  their meaning, then memorise them, so that the whole attention subsequently  may be given to applying the musical part to them and employing with proper  phrasing, which means more than knowing when to breathe; it means imparting  expression and feeling. A clever actor or orator can, if he possess a high  degree of intelligence and a fairly artistic temperament, so modulate his  voice as to convey to his audience the passions and emotions while feeling  none of them himself; so many great singers who are possessed of a good  musical ear, a good memory, and natural intelligence, although lacking in  supreme artistic temperament and conspicuous musical ability, are  nevertheless able to interpret by intonation and articulation the passions  and emotions which the composer has expressed in his music and the poet or  dramatist in his words. The intelligent artist possessed of the musical  ear, the sense of rhythm, and a well-formed vocal organ accomplishes this  by the conscious control and management of his breathing muscles and the  muscles of articulation, which by education and imitation he has brought  under complete control of the will. With him visual symbols of musical  notes are associated with the visual symbols of words in the mind, and the  visual symbols whether of the words or of the musical notes will serve to  revive in memory the sound of the one or the other, or of both. But he  produces that sound by alteration of tension in co-ordinated groups of  muscles necessary for vocalisation, viz. the muscles of phonation in the  larynx, the muscles of articulation in the tongue, lips, jaw, and palate,  and the muscles of costal respiration. _The mind_ of the orator, actor, and  dramatic singer exercises a profound influence upon the respiratory system  of nerves, and thereby produces the necessary variations in the force,  continuance, and volume of air required for vocal expression.    Sir Charles Bell, who discovered the respiratory system of nerves, pointed  out how the lungs, from being in the lower animals merely the means of  oxygenating the blood, become utilised in the act of expelling air from the  body for the production of audible sounds--the elements of human voice and  speech. Likewise he drew attention to the influence which powerful emotions  exercise upon the organ of respiration, including the countenance, e.g. the  dilated nostrils in anger. Again, \"when the voice suffers interruption and  falters, and the face, neck, and chest are animated by strong passion  working from within the breast, language exerts its most commanding  influence.\"    In hemiplegia or paralysis of one half of the body, there is a difference  between the two sides for ordinary automatic unconscious diaphragmatic  breathing and voluntary or costal breathing. Thus in ordinary breathing the  movements are increased on the paralysed side, especially in the upper part  of the chest, while in voluntary breathing they are increased on the sound  side. Hughlings Jackson suggested the following theory to explain these  facts: \"_Ordinary breathing_ is an automatic act governed by the  respiratory centre in the medulla. The respiratory centre is double, each  side being controlled or inhibited by higher centres on the opposite side  of the brain. Voluntary costal breathing, such as is employed in singing,  is of cerebral origin, and controlled by centres on the opposite side of  the brain, the impulses being sent down to the respective centres for the  associated movements of the muscles of articulation, phonation, and  breathing, in the same way as they are sent to the centres for the  movements of the arm or leg. With voluntary breathing the respiratory  centre in the medulla has nothing to do. It is in fact out of gear or  inhibited for the time being, so that the impulses from the brain pass by  or evade it. There are thus two sets of respiratory nerve fibres passing  from the brain--the one inhibiting or controlling to the opposite half of  the respiratory centre in the medulla; the other direct, evading the  respiratory centre and running the same course to the spinal centres for  the respiratory movements as the ordinary motor fibres do to the centres  for other movements. Both sets would be affected by the lesion (or damage)  which produced the hemiplegia. The inhibitory fibres being damaged, the  opposite half of the respiratory centre would be under diminished control  and therefore the movements of ordinary breathing on the paralysed side  would be exaggerated. The damage to the direct fibres would prevent the  passage of voluntary stimuli to the groups of respiratory muscles (as it  would do to the rest of the muscles of the paralysed side), and thus the  voluntary movement of respiration would be diminished--diminished only and  not completely abolished as in the limbs; because according to the theory  of Broadbent, in the case of such closely associated bilateral movements  the lower nervous respiratory centres of both sides would be activated from  either side of the brain.\" This certainly applies also to the muscles of  phonation, but not to the principal muscles of articulation, viz. the  tongue and lips. It is not exactly known what part of the cerebral cortex  controls the associated movements necessary for voluntary costal (rib)  respiration in singing; probably it is localised in the frontal lobe in  front of that part, stimulation of which gives rise to trunk movements  (_vide_ fig. 16). Whatever its situation, it must be connected by  association fibres with the centres of phonation and articulation.    [Illustration: FIG. 18]    [Description: FIG. 18.--The accompanying diagram is an attempt to explain  the course of innervation currents in phonation.    1.

It was the best-concealed nest for that style of position that  I have ever seen.\"    These tiny eggs, almost smaller than those of any European bird that  I know, are broad ovals, sometimes almost globular, but generally  somewhat compressed towards one end, so as to assume something of a  pyriform shape. They are almost entirely glossless, have a pinkish or  at times creamy-white ground, and exhibit a conspicuous reddish or  purple zone towards the large end, composed of multitudes of minute  spots almost confluent, and interspaced with a purplish cloud. Faint  traces of similar excessively minute purple or red points extend more  or less above and below the zone. The eggs vary from 0.53 to 0.58  in length, and from 0.43 to 0.46 in breadth; but the average of  twenty-five is 0.56 nearly by 0.45 nearly.      41.

Mr. Mandelli found a nest of this species at Lebong in Sikhim on the  15th June in a hole in a dead tree, about 5 feet from the ground. The  nest was a mere pad of the soft fur of some animal, in which a  little of the brown silky down from fern-stems and a little moss was  intermingled. It contained three hard-set eggs.    One of these eggs is a very regular oval, scarcely, if at all, pointed  towards the lesser end; the ground-colour is a pure dead white, and  the markings, spots, and specks of pale reddish brown, and underlying  spots of pale purple, are evenly scattered all over the egg; it  measures 0.78 by 0.55.      42.

The Yellow-cheeked Tit is one of the commonest birds in the  neighbourhood of Simla, yet curiously enough I have never found a  nest.    I have had eggs and nest sent me, and I know it breeds throughout the  Western Himalayas, at elevations of from 4000 to 7000 feet; and that  it lays during April and May (and probably other months), making a  soft pad-like nest, composed of hair and fur, in boles in trees and  walls; but I can give no further particulars.    Captain Hutton tells us that it is \"common in the hills throughout  the year. It breeds in April, in which month a nest containing  four fledged young ones was found at 5000 feet elevation; it was  constructed of moss, hair, and feathers, and placed at the bottom of a  deep hole in a stump at the foot of an oak tree.\"    Writing from Dhurmsala, Captain Cock says:--\"Towards the end of April  this bird made its nest in a hole of a tree just below the terrace  of my house. Before the nest was quite finished a pair of _Passer  cinnamomeus_ bullied the old birds out of the place, which they  deserted. After they had left it I cut the nest out and found it  nearly ready to lay in, lined with soft goat-hair and that same dark  fur noticed in the nest of _Parus monticola_.\"    Later he wrote to me that this species \"breeds up at Dhurmsala in  April and May. It chooses an old cleft or natural cavity in a tree,  usually the hill-oak, and makes a nest of wool and fur at the bottom  of the cavity, upon which it lays five eggs much like the eggs of  _Parus monticola_. Perhaps the blotches are a little larger, otherwise  I can see no difference. I noticed on one occasion the male bird carry  wool to the nest, which, when I cut it out the same day, I found  contained hard-set eggs. I used to nail a sheepskin up in a hill-oak,  and watch it with glasses, during April and May, and many a nest have  I found by its help. _Parus atriceps, P. monticola, Machlolophus  xanthogenys, Abrornis albisuperciliaris_, and many others used to  visit it and pull off flocks of wool for their nests. Following up a  little bird with wool in its bill through jungle requires sharp eyes  and is no easy matter at first, but one soon becomes practised at it.\"    The eggs are regular, somewhat elongated ovals, in some cases slightly  compressed towards one end. The ground is white or reddish white, and  they are thickly speckled, spotted, and even blotched with brick-dust  red; they have little or no gloss.    They vary in length from 0.7 to 0.78, and in breadth from 0.52 to  0.55; but I have only measured six eggs.      43. Machlolophus haplonotus (Bl.). _The Southern Yellow Tit_.    _Machlolophus jerdoni (Bl.), Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 280.    Col. E.A. Butler writes:--\"Belgaum, 12th Sept., 1879.--Found a nest of  the Southern Yellow Tit in a hole of a small tree about 10 feet from  the ground. My attention was first attracted to it by seeing the  hen-bird with her wings spread and feathers erect angrily mobbing a  palm-squirrel that had incautiously ascended the tree, and thinking  there must be a nest close by, I watched the sequel, and in a few  seconds the squirrel descended the tree and the Tit disappeared in a  small hole about halfway up. I then put a net over the hole and tapped  the bough to drive her out, but this was no easy matter, for although  the nest was only about 3/4 foot from the entrance, and I made as much  noise as a thick stick could well make against a hollow bough, nothing  would induce her to leave the nest until I had cut a large wedge out  of the branch, with a saw and chisel, close to the nest, when she flew  out into the net.    \"The nest, which contained, to my great disappointment, five young  birds about a week old, was very massively built, and completely  choked up the hollow passage in which it was placed. The foundation  consisted of a quantity of dry green moss, of the kind that natives  bring in from the jungles in the rains, and sell for ornamenting  flower vases, &c. Next came a thick layer of coir, mixed with a few  dry skeleton-leaves and some short ends of old rope and a scrap or two  of paper, and finally a substantial pad of blackish hair, principally  human, but with cow- and horse-hair intermixed, forming a snug little  bed for the young ones. The total depth of the nest exteriorly was at  least 7 inches.    \"The bough, about 8 inches in diameter, was partly rotten and hollow  the whole way down, having a small hole at the side above by which the  birds entered, and another rather larger about a foot below the nest  all choked up with moss that had fallen from the base of the nest. It  is strange that it should have escaped my eye previously, as the tree  overhung my gateway, through which I passed constantly during the day.  Immediately below the nest a large black board bearing my name was  nailed to the tree.    \"At Belgaum, on the 10th July, 1880, I observed a pair of Yellow Tits  building in a crevice of a large banian tree about 9 feet from the  ground. The two birds were flying to and from the nest in company,  the hen carrying building-materials in her beak. I watched the nest  constantly for several days, but never saw the birds near it again  until the 18th inst., when the hen flew out of the hole as I passed  the tree. I visited the spot on the 19th and 20th inst., tapping the  tree loudly with a stick as I passed, but without any result, as the  bird did not fly off the nest.    \"On the 21st, thinking the nest must either be forsaken or contain  eggs, I got up and looked into the hole, and to my surprise found the  hen bird comfortably seated on the nest, notwithstanding the noise I  had been making to try and put her off. As the crevice was too small  to admit my hand, I commenced to enlarge the entrance with a chisel,  the old bird sitting closer than ever the whole time. Finding all  attempts to drive her off the eggs fruitless, I tried to poke her off:  with a piece of stick, whereupon she stuck her head into one of the  far corners and sulked. I then inserted my hand with some difficulty  and drew her gently out of the hole, but as soon as she caught sight  of me, she commenced fighting in the most pugnacious manner, digging  her claws and beak into my hand, and finally breaking loose, flying,  not away as might have been expected, but straight back into the hole  again, to commence sulking once more. Again I drew her out, keeping a  firm hold of one leg until I got her well away from the hole, when I  released her. I then extracted five fresh eggs from the hole by means  of a small round net attached to the loop end of a short piece of  wire. The nest was a simple pad of human and cows' hair, with a few  horsehairs interwoven, and one or two bits of snake's skin in the  lining, having a thin layer of green moss and thin strips of inner  bark below as a foundation--in fact a regular Tit's nest. The eggs, of  the usual parine type, were considerably larger than the eggs of _P.  atriceps_, broad ovals, slightly smaller at one end than the other,  having a white ground spotted moderately thickly all over with reddish  chestnut; no zone or cap, but in some eggs more freely marked at one  end (either small or large end) than the other, some of the markings  almost amounting to blotches and the spots as a rule rather large.\"    Messrs. Davidson and Wenden remark of this bird in the  Deccan:--\"Specimens of this Tit were procured at Lanoli in August and  at Egutpoora in March. They certainly breed at these places, as in  September, at the latter place, W. observed two parent birds with four  young ones capable of flying out very short distances.\"    And Mr. Davidson further states that it is \"common throughout the  district of Western Kandeish. I saw a pair building in the hole of a  large mango tree at Malpur in Pimpalnir in the end of May.\"      44. Lophophanes melanolophus (Vig.). _The Crested Black Tit_.
