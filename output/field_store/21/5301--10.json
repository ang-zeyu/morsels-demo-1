On  his breast hung a medallion bearing a picture of Princess Dorothy of  Oz, and in his hand, as he stood looking at Ojo, was a sharp knife  shaped like a dagger.    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Ojo, greatly astonished at the sight of this stranger;  and then he added: \"Who has saved me, sir?\"    \"Can't you see?\" replied the other, with a smile; \"I'm the Shaggy Man.\"    \"Yes; I can see that,\" said the boy, nodding. \"Was it you who rescued  me from the leaf?\"    \"None other, you may be sure. But take care, or I shall have to rescue  you again.\"    Ojo gave a jump, for he saw several broad leaves leaning toward him;  but the Shaggy Man began to whistle again, and at the sound the leaves  all straightened up on their stems and kept still.    The man now took Ojo's arm and led him up the road, past the last of  the great plants, and not till he was safely beyond their reach did he  cease his whistling.    \"You see, the music charms 'em,\" said he. \"Singing or whistling--it  doesn't matter which--makes 'em behave, and nothing else will. I always  whistle as I go by 'em and so they always let me alone. To-day as I  went by, whistling, I saw a leaf curled and knew there must be  something inside it. I cut down the leaf with my knife and--out you  popped. Lucky I passed by, wasn't it?\"    \"You were very kind,\" said Ojo, \"and I thank you. Will you please  rescue my companions, also?\"    \"What companions?\" asked the Shaggy Man.    \"The leaves grabbed them all,\" said the boy. \"There's a Patchwork Girl  and--\"    \"A what?\"    \"A girl made of patchwork, you know. She's alive and her name is  Scraps. And there's a Glass Cat--\"    \"Glass?\" asked the Shaggy Man.    \"All glass.\"    \"And alive?\"    \"Yes,\" said Ojo; \"she has pink brains. And there's a Woozy--\"    \"What's a Woozy?\" inquired the Shaggy Man.    \"Why, I--I--can't describe it,\" answered the boy, greatly perplexed.  \"But it's a queer animal with three hairs on the tip of its tail that  won't come out and--\"    \"What won't come out?\" asked the Shaggy Man; \"the tail?\"    \"The hairs won't come out. But you'll see the Woozy, if you'll please  rescue it, and then you'll know just what it is.\"    \"Of course,\" said the Shaggy Man, nodding his shaggy head. And then he  walked back among the plants, still whistling, and found the three  leaves which were curled around Ojo's traveling companions. The first  leaf he cut down released Scraps, and on seeing her the Shaggy Man  threw back his shaggy head, opened wide his mouth and laughed so  shaggily and yet so merrily that Scraps liked him at once. Then he took  off his hat and made her a low bow, saying:    \"My dear, you're a wonder. I must introduce you to my friend the  Scarecrow.\"    When he cut down the second leaf he rescued the Glass Cat, and Bungle  was so frightened that she scampered away like a streak and soon had  joined Ojo, when she sat beside him panting and trembling. The last  plant of all the row had captured the Woozy, and a big bunch in the  center of the curled leaf showed plainly where he was. With his sharp  knife the Shaggy Man sliced off the stem of the leaf and as it fell and  unfolded out trotted the Woozy and escaped beyond the reach of any more  of the dangerous plants.          Chapter Eleven    A Good Friend      Soon the entire party was gathered on the road of yellow bricks, quite  beyond the reach of the beautiful but treacherous plants. The Shaggy  Man, staring first at one and then at the other, seemed greatly pleased  and interested.    \"I've seen queer things since I came to the Land of Oz,\" said he, \"but  never anything queerer than this band of adventurers. Let us sit down a  while, and have a talk and get acquainted.\"    \"Haven't you always lived in the Land of Oz?\" asked the Munchkin boy.    \"No; I used to live in the big, outside world. But I came here once  with Dorothy, and Ozma let me stay.\"    \"How do you like Oz?\" asked Scraps. \"Isn't the country and the climate  grand?\"    \"It's the finest country in all the world, even if it is a fairyland,  and I'm happy every minute I live in it,\" said the Shaggy Man. \"But  tell me something about yourselves.\"    So Ojo related the story of his visit to the house of the Crooked  Magician, and how he met there the Glass Cat, and how the Patchwork  Girl was brought to life and of the terrible accident to Unc Nunkie and  Margolotte. Then he told how he had set out to find the five different  things which the Magician needed to make a charm that would restore the  marble figures to life, one requirement being three hairs from a  Woozy's tail.    \"We found the Woozy,\" explained the boy, \"and he agreed to give us the  three hairs; but we couldn't pull them out. So we had to bring the  Woozy along with us.\"    \"I see,\" returned the Shaggy Man, who had listened with interest to the  story. \"But perhaps I, who am big and strong, can pull those three  hairs from the Woozy's tail.\"    \"Try it, if you like,\" said the Woozy.    So the Shaggy Man tried it, but pull as hard as he could he failed to  get the hairs out of the Woozy's tail. So he sat down again and wiped  his shaggy face with a shaggy silk handkerchief and said:    \"It doesn't matter. If you can keep the Woozy until you get the rest of  the things you need, you can take the beast and his three hairs to the  Crooked Magician and let him find a way to extract 'em. What are the  other things you are to find?\"    \"One,\" said Ojo, \"is a six-leaved clover.\"    \"You ought to find that in the fields around the Emerald City,\" said  the Shaggy Man. \"There is a Law against picking six-leaved clovers, but  I think I can get Ozma to let you have one.\"    \"Thank you,\" replied Ojo. \"The next thing is the left wing of a yellow  butterfly.\"    \"For that you must go to the Winkie Country,\" the Shaggy Man declared.  \"I've never noticed any butterflies there, but that is the yellow  country of Oz and it's ruled by a good friend of mine, the Tin Woodman.\"    \"Oh, I've heard of him!\" exclaimed Ojo. \"He must be a wonderful man.\"    \"So he is, and his heart is wonderfully kind. I'm sure the Tin Woodman  will do all in his power to help you to save your Unc Nunkie and poor  Margolotte.\"    \"The next thing I must find,\" said the Munchkin boy, \"is a gill of  water from a dark well.\"    \"Indeed! Well, that is more difficult,\" said the Shaggy Man, scratching  his left ear in a puzzled way. \"I've never heard of a dark well; have  you?\"    \"No,\" said Ojo.    \"Do you know where one may be found?\" inquired the Shaggy Man.    \"I can't imagine,\" said Ojo.    \"Then we must ask the Scarecrow.\"    \"The Scarecrow! But surely, sir, a scarecrow can't know anything.\"    \"Most scarecrows don't, I admit,\" answered the Shaggy Man. \"But this  Scarecrow of whom I speak is very intelligent. He claims to possess the  best brains in all Oz.\"    \"Better than mine?\" asked Scraps.    \"Better than mine?\" echoed the Glass Cat. \"Mine are pink, and you can  see 'em work.\"    \"Well, you can't see the Scarecrow's brains work, but they do a lot of  clever thinking,\" asserted the Shaggy Man. \"If anyone knows where a  dark well is, it's my friend the Scarecrow.\"    \"Where does he live?\" inquired Ojo.    \"He has a splendid castle in the Winkie Country, near to the palace of  his friend the Tin Woodman, and he is often to be found in the Emerald  City, where he visits Dorothy at the royal palace.\"    \"Then we will ask him about the dark well,\" said Ojo.    \"But what else does this Crooked Magician want?\" asked the Shaggy Man.    \"A drop of oil from a live man's body.\"    \"Oh; but there isn't such a thing.\"    \"That is what I thought,\" replied Ojo; \"but the Crooked Magician said  it wouldn't be called for by the recipe if it couldn't be found, and  therefore I must search until I find it.\"    \"I wish you good luck,\" said the Shaggy Man, shaking his head  doubtfully; \"but I imagine you'll have a hard job getting a drop of oil  from a live man's body. There's blood in a body, but no oil.\"    \"There's cotton in mine,\" said Scraps, dancing a little jig.    \"I don't doubt it,\" returned the Shaggy Man admiringly. \"You're a  regular comforter and as sweet as patchwork can be. All you lack is  dignity.\"    \"I hate dignity,\" cried Scraps, kicking a pebble high in the air and  then trying to catch it as it fell. \"Half the fools and all the wise  folks are dignified, and I'm neither the one nor the other.\"    \"She's just crazy,\" explained the Glass Cat.    The Shaggy Man laughed.    \"She's delightful, in her way,\" he said. \"I'm sure Dorothy will be  pleased with her, and the Scarecrow will dote on her. Did you say you  were traveling toward the Emerald City?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Ojo. \"I thought that the best place to go, at first,  because the six-leaved clover may be found there.\"    \"I'll go with you,\" said the Shaggy Man, \"and show you the way.\"    \"Thank you,\" exclaimed Ojo. \"I hope it won't put you out any.\"    \"No,\" said the other, \"I wasn't going anywhere in particular. I've been  a rover all my life, and although Ozma has given me a suite of  beautiful rooms in her palace I still get the wandering fever once in a  while and start out to roam the country over. I've been away from the  Emerald City several weeks, this time, and now that I've met you and  your friends I'm sure it will interest me to accompany you to the great  city of Oz and introduce you to my friends.\"    \"That will be very nice,\" said the boy, gratefully.    \"I hope your friends are not dignified,\" observed Scraps.    \"Some are, and some are not,\" he answered; \"but I never criticise my  friends. If they are really true friends, they may be anything they  like, for all of me.\"    \"There's some sense in that,\" said Scraps, nodding her queer head in  approval. \"Come on, and let's get to the Emerald City as soon as  possible.\" With this she ran up the path, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#12)"],[1,"other, trembling violently.    But soon they gained courage to look more closely at the Peculiar  Person. As he was a type of all the inhabitants of this extraordinary  land whom they afterward met, I will try to tell you what he looked  like.    His face was beautiful, but lacked expression. His eyes were large and  blue in color and his teeth finely formed and white as snow. His hair  was black and bushy and seemed inclined to curl at the ends. So far no  one could find any fault with his appearance. He wore a robe of  scarlet, which did not cover his arms and extended no lower than his  bare knees. On the bosom of the robe was embroidered a terrible  dragon's head, as horrible to look at as the man was beautiful. His  arms and legs were left bare and the skin of one arm was bright yellow  and the skin of the other arm a vivid green. He had one blue leg and  one pink one, while both his feet--which showed through the open  sandals he wore--were jet black.    Betsy could not decide whether these gorgeous colors were dyes or the  natural tints of the skin, but while she was thinking it over the man  who had been called \"Tubekins\" said:    \"Follow me to the Residence--all of you!\"    But just then a Voice exclaimed: \"Here's another of them, Tubekins,  lying in the water of the fountain.\"    \"Gracious!\" cried Betsy; \"it must be Tik-Tok, and he'll drown.\"    \"Water is a bad thing for his clockworks, anyhow,\" agreed Shaggy, as  with one accord they all started for the fountain. But before they  could reach it, invisible hands raised Tik-Tok from the marble basin  and set him upon his feet beside it, water dripping from every joint of  his copper body.    \"Ma--ny tha--tha--tha--thanks!\" he said; and then his copper jaws  clicked together and he could say no more. He next made an attempt to  walk but after several awkward trials found he could not move his  joints.    Peals of jeering laughter from persons unseen greeted Tik-Tok's  failure, and the new arrivals in this strange land found it very  uncomfortable to realize that there were many creatures around them who  were invisible, yet could be heard plainly.    \"Shall I wind him up?\" asked Betsy, feeling very sorry for Tik-Tok.    \"I think his machinery is wound; but he needs oiling,\" replied Shaggy.    At once an oil-can appeared before him, held on a level with his eyes  by some unseen hand. Shaggy took the can and tried to oil Tik-Tok's  joints. As if to assist him, a strong current of warm air was directed  against the copper man which quickly dried him. Soon he was able to say  \"Ma-ny thanks!\" quite smoothly and his joints worked fairly well.    \"Come!\" commanded Tubekins, and turning his back upon them he walked up  the path toward the castle.    \"Shall we go?\" asked Queen Ann, uncertainly; but just then she received  a shove that almost pitched her forward on her head; so she decided to  go. The officers who hesitated received several energetic kicks, but  could not see who delivered them; therefore they also decided--very  wisely--to go. The others followed willingly enough, for unless they  ventured upon another terrible journey through the Tube they must make  the best of the unknown country they were in, and the best seemed to be  to obey orders.          Chapter Eleven    The Famous Fellowship of Fairies      After a short walk through very beautiful gardens they came to the  castle and followed Tubekins through the entrance and into a great  domed chamber, where he commanded them to be seated.    From the crown which he wore, Betsy had thought this man must be the  King of the country they were in, yet after he had seated all the  strangers upon benches that were ranged in a semicircle before a high  throne, Tubekins bowed humbly before the vacant throne and in a flash  became invisible and disappeared.    The hall was an immense place, but there seemed to be no one in it  beside themselves. Presently, however, they heard a low cough near  them, and here and there was the faint rustling of a robe and a slight  patter as of footsteps. Then suddenly there rang out the clear tone of  a bell and at the sound all was changed.    Gazing around the hall in bewilderment they saw that it was filled with  hundreds of men and women, all with beautiful faces and staring blue  eyes and all wearing scarlet robes and jeweled crowns upon their heads.  In fact, these people seemed exact duplicates of Tubekins and it was  difficult to find any mark by which to tell them apart.    \"My! what a lot of Kings and Queens!\" whispered Betsy to Polychrome,  who sat beside her and appeared much interested in the scene but not a  bit worried.    \"It is certainly a strange sight,\" was Polychrome's reply; \"but I  cannot see how there can be more than one King, or Queen, in any one  country, for were these all rulers, no one could tell who was Master.\"    One of the Kings who stood near and overheard this remark turned to her  and said: \"One who is Master of himself is always a King, if only to  himself. In this favored land all Kings and Queens are equal, and it is  our privilege to bow before one supreme Ruler--the Private Citizen.\"    \"Who's he?\" inquired Betsy.    As if to answer her, the clear tones of the bell again rang out and  instantly there appeared seated in the throne the man who was lord and  master of all these royal ones. This fact was evident when with one  accord they fell upon their knees and touched their foreheads to the  floor.    The Private Citizen was not unlike the others, except that his eyes  were black instead of blue and in the centers of the black irises  glowed red sparks that seemed like coals of fire. But his features were  very beautiful and dignified and his manner composed and stately.  Instead of the prevalent scarlet robe, he wore one of white, and the  same dragon's head that decorated the others was embroidered upon its  bosom.    \"What charge lies against these people, Tubekins?\" he asked in quiet,  even tones.    \"They came through the forbidden Tube, O Mighty Citizen,\" was the reply.    \"You see, it was this way,\" said Betsy. \"We were marching to the Nome  King, to conquer him and set Shaggy's brother free, when on a sudden--\"    \"Who are you?\" demanded the Private Citizen sternly.    \"Me? Oh, I'm Betsy Bobbin, and--\"    \"Who is the leader of this party?\" asked the Citizen.    \"Sir, I am Queen Ann of Oogaboo, and--\"    \"Then keep quiet,\" said the Citizen. \"Who is the leader?\"    No one answered for a moment. Then General Bunn stood up.    \"Sit down!\" commanded the Citizen. \"I can see that sixteen of you are  merely officers, and of no account.\"    \"But we have an Army,\" said General Clock, blusteringly, for he didn't  like to be told he was of no account.    \"Where is your Army?\" asked the Citizen.    \"It's me,\" said Tik-Tok, his voice sounding a little rusty. \"I'm the  on-ly Pri-vate Sol-dier in the par-ty.\"    Hearing this, the Citizen rose and bowed respectfully to the Clockwork  Man.    \"Pardon me for not realizing your importance before,\" said he. \"Will  you oblige me by taking a seat beside me on my throne?\"    Tik-Tok rose and walked over to the throne, all the Kings and Queens  making way for him. Then with clanking steps he mounted the platform  and sat on the broad seat beside the Citizen.    Ann was greatly provoked at this mark of favor shown to the humble  Clockwork Man, but Shaggy seemed much pleased that his old friend's  importance had been recognized by the ruler of this remarkable country.  The Citizen now began to question Tik-Tok, who told in his mechanical  voice about Shaggy's quest of his lost brother, and how Ozma of Oz had  sent the Clockwork Man to assist him, and how they had fallen in with  Queen Ann and her people from Oogaboo. Also he told how Betsy and Hank  and Polychrome and the Rose Princess had happened to join their party.    \"And you intended to conquer Ruggedo, the Metal Monarch and King of the  Nomes?\" asked the Citizen.    \"Yes. That seemed the on-ly thing for us to do,\" was Tik-Tok's reply.  \"But he was too clev-er for us. When we got close to his cav-ern he  made our path lead to the Tube, and made the op-en-ing in-vis-i-ble, so  that we all fell in-to it be-fore we knew it was there. It was an eas-y  way to get rid of us and now Rug-gedo is safe and we are far a-way in a  strange land.\"    The Citizen was silent a moment and seemed to be thinking. Then he said:    \"Most noble Private Soldier, I must inform you that by the laws of our  country anyone who comes through the Forbidden Tube must be tortured  for nine days and ten nights and then thrown back into the Tube. But it  is wise to disregard laws when they conflict with justice, and it seems  that you and your followers did not disobey our laws willingly, being  forced into the Tube by Ruggedo. Therefore the Nome King is alone to  blame, and he alone must be punished.\"    \"That suits me,\" said Tik-Tok. \"But Rug-ge-do is on the o-ther side of  the world where he is a-way out of your reach.\"    The Citizen drew himself up proudly.    \"Do you imagine anything in the world or upon it can be out of the  reach of the Great Jinjin?\" he asked.    \"Oh! Are you, then, the Great Jinjin?\" inquired Tik-Tok.    \"I am.\"    \"Then your name is Ti-ti-ti-Hoo-choo?\"    \"It is.\"    Queen Ann gave a scream and began to tremble. Shaggy was so disturbed  that he took out a handkerchief and wiped the perspiration from his  brow. Polychrome looked sober and uneasy for the first time, while  Files put his arms around the Rose Princess as if to protect her. As  for the officers, the name of the great Jinjin set them moaning and  weeping at a great rate and every one fell upon his knees before the  throne, begging for mercy. Betsy was worried at seeing her companions  so disturbed, but did not know what it was all about. Only Tik-Tok was  unmoved at the discovery.    \"Then,\" said he, \"if you are Ti-ti-ti-Hoo-choo, and think Rug-ge-do is  to blame, I am sure that"]]]
