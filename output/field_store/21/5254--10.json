Listen, O  Krishna, to what I for one think. O Janardana, desisting from this act  seemeth to me to be beneficial. My heart to-day is afflicted. The  Rajasuya appeareth to me difficult of accomplishment.'\"    Vaisampayana said,--\"Arjuna who had obtained that excellent of bows and  that couple of inexhaustible quivers, and that car with that banner, as  also that assembly room, now addressed Yudhishthira and said,--'I have  obtained, O king, a bow and weapons and arrows and energy and allies  and dominions and fame and strength. Those are always difficult of  acquisition, however much they may be desired. Learned men of repute  always praise in good society nobleness of descent. But nothing is  equal to might. Indeed, O monarch, there is nothing I like more than  prowess. Born in a race noted for its valour, one that is without  valour is scarcely worthy of regard. One, however, possessed of valour,  that is born in a race not noted for it, is much superior to the  former. He, O king, is a Kshatriya in every thing who increaseth his  fame and possessions by the subjugation of his enemies. And he that is  possessed of valour, though destitute of all (other) merits, will  vanquish his foes. One, however, that is destitute of valour, though  possessed of every (other) merit, can scarcely accomplish anything.  Every merit exists by the side of valour in an incipient state.  Concentration of attention, exertion and destiny exist as the three  causes of victory. One, however, that is possessed of valour doth not  yet deserve success if he acts carelessly. It is for this that an enemy  endued with strength sometimes suffers death at the hands of his foes.  As meanness overtakes the weak, so folly sometimes overtakes the  strong. A king, therefore, that is desirous of victory, should avoid  both these causes of destruction. If, for the purpose of our sacrifice,  we endeavour to slay Jarasandha and rescue the kings kept by him for a  cruel purpose, there is no higher act which we could employ ourselves  in. If, however, we do not undertake the task, the world will always  think us incompetent. We have certainly the competence, O king! Why  should you, therefore, regard us as incompetent? Those that have become  Munis desirous of achieving tranquillity of souls, obtain yellow robes  with ease. So if we vanquish the foe, the imperial dignity will easily  be ours. We shall, therefore fight the foe.'      SECTION XVII    \"Vasudeva said,--'Arjuna hath indicated what the inclination should be  of one that is born in the Bharata race, especially of one who is the  son of Kunti. We know not when death will overtake us, in the night or  in the day. Nor have we ever heard that immortality hath been achieved  by desisting from fight. This, therefore, is the duty of men, viz., to  attack all enemies in accordance with the principles laid down in the  ordinance. This always gives satisfaction to the heart. Aided by good  policy, if not frustrated by Destiny, an undertaking becomes crowned  with success. If both parties aided by such means encounter each other,  one must obtain ascendency over the other, for both cannot win or lose.  A battle however, if directed by bad policy which again is destitute of  the well-known arts, ends in defeat or destruction. If, again, both  parties are equally circumstanced, the result becomes doubtful. Both,  however, cannot win. When such is the case, why should we not, aided by  good policy, directly approach the foe; and destroy him, like the  current of the river uprooting a tree? If, disguising our own faults,  we attack the enemy taking advantage of his loopholes, why should we  not succeed? Indeed, the policy of intelligent men, is that one should  not fight openly with foes that are exceedingly powerful and are at the  head of their well-arrayed forces. This too is my opinion. If, however,  we accomplish our purpose secretly entering the abode of our foe and  attacking his person, we shall never earn obloquy. That bull among  men--Jarasandha--alone enjoyeth unfaded glory, like unto him who is the  self in the heart of every created being. But I see his destruction  before me. Desirous of protecting our relatives we will either slay him  in battle or shall ascend to heaven being ourselves slain in the end by  him.'    \"Yudhishthira said--'O Krishna, who is this Jarasandha? What is his  energy and what is his prowess, that having touched thee he hath not  been burnt like an insect at the touch of fire?'    \"Krishna said,--'Hear, O monarch, who Jarasandha is; what his energy;  and what is his prowess; and why also he hath been spared by us, even  though he hath repeatedly offended us. There was a mighty king of the  name of Vrihadratha, the lord of the Magadhas. Proud in battle, he had  three Akshauhinis of troops. Handsome and endued with energy, possessed  of affluence and prowess beyond measure, and always bearing on his  person marks indicating installation at sacrifices. He was like a  second Indra. In glory he was like unto Suryya, in forgiveness like  unto the Earth, in wrath like unto the destroyer Yama and in wealth  like unto Vaisravana. And O thou foremost of the Bharata race, the  whole earth was covered by his qualities that descended upon him from a  long line of ancestors, like the rays emerging from the sun. And, O  bull of the Bharata race, endued with great energy that monarch married  two twin daughters of the king of Kasi, both endued with the wealth of  beauty. And that bull among men made an engagement in secret with his  wives that he would love them equally and would never show a preference  for either. And the lord of the earth in the company of his two dearly  loved wives, both of whom suited him well, passed his days in joy like  a mighty elephant in the company of two cow-elephants, or like the  ocean in his personified form between Ganga and Yamuna (also in their  personified forms). The monarch's youth however, passed away in the  enjoyment of his possessions, without any son being born unto him to  perpetuate his line. The best of monarch failed to obtain a son to  perpetuate his race, even by means of various auspicious rites, and  homas, and sacrifices performed with the desire for having an  offspring. One day the king heard that the high-souled Chanda-kausika,  the son of Kakshivat of the illustrious Gautama race, having desisted  from ascetic penances had come in course of his wanderings to his  capital and had taken his seat under the shade of a mango tree. The  king went unto that Muni accompanied by his two wives, and worshipping  him with jewels and valuable presents gratified him highly. That best  of Rishis truthful in speech and firmly attached to truth, then told  the king,--\"O king of kings, I have been pleased with thee. O thou of  excellent vows, solicit thou a boon.\" King Vrihadratha then, with his  wives, bending low unto that Rishi, spoke these words choked with tears  in consequence of his despair of obtaining a child.--\"O holy one  forsaking my kingdom I am about to go into the woods to practise  ascetic penances. I am very unfortunate for I have no son. What shall I  do, therefore, with my kingdom or with a boon?\"'    \"Krishna continued,--'Hearing these words (of the king), the Muni  controlling his outer senses entered into meditation, sitting in the  shade of that very mango tree where he was. And there fell upon the lap  of the seated Muni a mango that was juicy and untouched by the beak of  a parrot or any other bird. That best of Munis, taking up the fruit and  mentally pronouncing certain mantras over it, gave it unto the king as  the means of his obtaining an incomparable offspring. And the great  Muni, possessed also of extraordinary wisdom, addressing the monarch,  said,--\"Return, O king, thy wish is fulfilled. Desist, O king, from  going (into the woods)\".--Hearing these words of the Muni and  worshipping his feet, the monarch possessed of great wisdom, returned  to his own abode. And recollecting his former promise (unto them) the  king gave, O bull of the Bharata race, unto his two wives that one  fruit. His beautiful queens, dividing that single fruit into two parts,  ate it up. In consequence of the certainty of the realisation of the  Muni's words and his truthfulness, both of them conceived, as an effect  of their having eaten that fruit. And the king beholding them in that  state became filled with great joy. Then, O wise monarch, some time  after, when the time came, each of the queens brought forth a  fragmentary body. And each fragment had one eye, one arm, one leg, half  a stomach, half a face, and half an anus. Beholding the fragmentary  bodies, both the mothers trembled much. The helpless sisters then  anxiously consulted each other, and sorrowfully abandoned those  fragments endued with life. The two midwives (that waited upon the  queens) then carefully wrapping up the still-born (?) fragments went  out of the inner apartments (of the palace) by the back door and  throwing away the bodies, returned in haste. A little while after, O  tiger among men, a Rakshasa woman of the name of Jara living upon flesh  and blood, took up the fragments that lay on a crossing. And impelled  by force of fate, the female cannibal united the fragments for facility  of carrying them away. And, O bull among men, as soon as the fragments  were united they formed a sturdy child of one body (endued with life).  Then, O king, the female cannibal, with eyes expanded in wonder, found  herself unable to carry away that child having a body as hard and  strong as the thunder-bolt. That infant then closing his fists red as  copper and inserting them into its mouth, began to roar terribly as  rain-charged clouds. Alarmed at the sound, the inmates of the palace, O  tiger among men, suddenly came out with the king, O slayer of all foes.  The helpless and disappointed and sad queens also,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7978"],[0,"Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of (#12)"],[1,"to this time by the Tuscaroras, led the  colonists to conclude that it was the Tuscaroras who caused the disaster,  and to them was directed the feud of the colonists.    A little previous to these disorders, it seems that there were some white  men, as our tradition states, with long coats and wide brimmed hats,  visited several nations of the Indians in that neighborhood, and appeared  to be very friendly toward them, wished them success in everything, and  told them that those settlers who were on the borders of their lands and  constantly encroaching and committing depredations upon the Indians, were  not of the government, but were merely squatters, who settled there of  their own accord, and if they were cut off, there would be none to avenge  them, and were advised to do so.    It has always been a question in my mind who those white men were, to  give such rash advice. Were they Quakers? But what motive had they in  advising, from which so great a disaster was the result? Or, were they  men in disguise, from the county of Bath, in which the massacre was  committed, to make the Indians believe that they were Quakers, as the two  counties were in arms against each other at that time.    To coroborate the tradition above, I would call your attention to part of  a letter from President Pollock to Lord Craven, in the year 1712, who  attributes the calamity thus:    \"Our divisions,\" says he, \"chiefly occasioned by the Quakers and some  other ill-disposed persons, have been the cause of all the troubles, for  the Indians were informed by some of the traders that the people who  lived here are only a few vagabonds, who had run away from other  governments and settled here of their own accord, without any authority,  so that if they were cut off, there would be none to revenge them. This  with their seeing our differences rise to such a heighth, that consisting  of two counties only, were in arms one against the other, encouraged them  to fall upon the county of Bath, expecting it would have no assistance  from this nor any other of the English plantations. This is the chief  cause that moved the Indians to rise against us, as far as I understand.\"    The Tuscaroras never had the inclination of cutting off the inhabitance  of the pale faces. Nevertheless, they did not always remain idle or  unconcerned spectators of the feuds and dissensions that so long  prevailed among the white people, toward the red men. The successive and  regular encroachments, on their hunting grounds and plantations, which  the increase of the European population occasioned, had not always been  submitted to without murmur.    Although they were pleased with the neighbors, from whom they had trade  for their furs, and could procure spirituous liquors and other articles,  which tended to the gratification of their real or imaginary wants. And  they were required to surrender larger and larger portions of their  domain, and at last, the removal of families from the neighborhood of  their long cherished memories of the graves of their ancestors, to the  more distant and less valuable tracts of land. Other causes of animosity  and ill-will were not wanting. Their hunters were shot down like so many  beasts, at the edge of the settlement, killed in their wigwams, their  young females' chastity violated, and many other things might be related,  which their tradition shows. But I have neither heart nor inclination to  bring to a resurrection the long gone-by memories of our forefathers. I  would that all were cast into oblivion, where might not be found neither  trace nor track; but rather that the chain of friendship which has  existed for more than a century between the Tuscaroras and the United  States Government may be made brighter and brighter as time rolls on.    I have said that the Tuscaroras never had the inclination of cutting off  the first colonies, and if that were their desire, how readily would they  have excepted the advice of President Thomas Carey, through one of his  counsel--Edward Porter--in the year 1710, of which you will find in  Martin's History of North Carolina a difficulty between Gov. Hyde and the  above, to-wit: \"Before any relief could be sent he attempted the landing  of some of his men under fire of his brig, but they were repulsed by the  militia of the neighborhood, which Gov. Hyde had time to collect. They  returned on board, and their Chief sought a safe retreat in the swamps of  the Tar river, where he raised his standard and endeavored to bring the  Tuscarora Indians into an alliance. For this purpose he dispatched to  them Edward Porter, one of his counsel, who endeavored by promises of  great rewards to induce them to cut off all the inhabitants of that part  of the province who adhered to Gov. Hyde. This was acceded to by some of  his young warriors, but when the matter was debated in council the old  men dissuaded them from listening to Porter.\"    Now, did not some of Carey's men go afterwards to some of the neighboring  Indian nations and induced them, in the year 1710, to commit the  massacre?    I suppose to the critical reader, and to the people generally, my writing  will appear to them fictitious, because of their first impression, which  has been taught them by many historians. Historians generally have given  only one side of the story, and have avoided, as much as possible, to  give the history of the wrongs done to the Tuscaroras, but they are very  scrupulous to preserve the history of the capture of Lawson, his  execution and of the massacre, which they allege to have been committed  by the Tuscaroras, and are styled by many as being inimical, haughty,  jealous, warlike bloodhounds, bloodthirsty and scarcely to be human.  These are the first impressions made by the historians upon the mind of  the world. I suppose, for the purpose of getting a general verdict, that  it was right; that they were crushed as a nation, their domain snatched  from them, driven into the cold world, and not a word has been written by  historians, or the Tuscaroras themselves, to vindicate their cause.    But with all the great tide of prejudiced feelings towards the  Tuscaroras, I have ventured to write their history as I have received it,  and think it to be true.    After the massacre, and the Tuscaroras heard it reported that they were  charged with being the author of the disaster, they immediately sent  messengers and denied the charge of having officially taken any part in  the disorder, but acknowledged that a few of the reckless and lawless  warriors did take part against their admonitions, but they were willing  to make all the restoration that was in their power to do, and would  fight for them if necessary. At different times they petitioned,  remonstrated and supplicated for peace, which was slighted and  disregarded, and only produced more violence and insult.    Notice what Governor Spotswood, of Virginia, said concerning the  Tuscaroras, to wit:    \"On the first of the disaster I sent a detachment of the militia to the  tributary Indians of this province to prevent them from joining in the  war, and understanding that the Indians in some of the Tuscarora towns  had refused to march against the whites, sent a messenger to invite them,  with the rest of the friendly tribes, to a conference at the Nottoway  line, on the southern border of Virginia, where he met them on the 7th of  November.\"    \"The Governor, after entering into some conversation with the Chiefs, had  the pleasure of finding the report which his messengers had made, from  their observations while in the Tuscarora towns, that they were very  desirous of continuing in peace, and were greatly concerned that any of  their nation should have joined in the massacre.\"    The Chiefs, after accounting for the delay that occurred, expressed the  desire of the Indians of their towns to continue in strict friendship  with the whites, and assist them in chastising the authors of the late  disorder.    \"But now an unfortunate difference arose between the Governor and the  burgesses, the latter insisting on the passage of a bill for raising an  army in Virginia, without trusting to the sincerity of the profession of  the Tuscarora Chiefs. The Governor refusing to accede to this  proposition, and declining to co-operate in their plans, the dispute  ended by a dissolution of the assembly.\"    There was at one time a treaty of peace concluded between the Sachems and  Chiefs of the Tuscaroras and Governor Spotswood, of Virginia, and one of  the conditions of the treaty was to help in chastising the authors of the  late massacre. In conformity with this pledge the Tuscaroras made an  attack on the Mattamuskeets, where they obtained thirty scalps and  presented them to the authorities of the whites, of which they pretended  to be pleased. I don't doubt but that they were really pleased, but not  with any good feelings towards the Tuscaroras. I suppose the object was  to get all the other Indian nations alienated from them, so that in due  time they might be easily conquered, because they were the nation that  the whites seemed bent on destroying. The Tuscaroras had faith in the  treaty, but only to disappoint them in the thought of having the dark  cloud which hung so glowingly over them taken away. It is said by  historians that the Tuscaroras disregarded the treaty and began  hostilities. But I will relate a tradition, handed down from generation  to generation, which is as follows, to wit:    Some little time after the treaty concluded, several white men went into  one of their towns and said that they were sent by the government to  distribute among them an annuity of goods in token of friendship; and  also said, \"In token of your sincerity to the treaty of peace, you will  all repair to a place where there is a cord stretched out in a straight  line, you must all take hold of the line with your right hand, and all  those that refuse to take"]]]
