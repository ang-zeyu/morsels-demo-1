These things endeared Isis to  the people everywhere, and as she herself had not suffered death like  Osiris, she came to be regarded as the eternal mother of life and of  all living things.  She was the creatress of crops, she produced fruit,  vegetables, plants of all kinds and trees, she made cattle prolific,  she brought men and women together and gave them offspring, she was the  authoress of all love, virtue, goodness and happiness.  She made the  light to shine, she was the spirit of the Dog-star which heralded the  Nile-flood, she was the source of the power in the beneficent light of  the moon; and finally she took the dead to her bosom and gave them  peace, and introduced them to a life of immortality and happiness  similar to that which she had bestowed upon Osiris.    The message of the cult of Isis as preached by her priests was one of  hope and happiness, and coming to the Greeks and Romans, as it did, at  a time when men were weary of their national cults, and when the  speculations of the philosophers carried no weight with the general  public, the people everywhere welcomed it with the greatest enthusiasm.  From Egypt it was carried to the Islands of Greece and to the mainland,  to Italy, Germany, France, Spain and Portugal, and then crossing the  western end of the Mediterranean it entered North Africa, and with  Carthage as a centre spread east and west along the coast.  Wherever  the cult of Isis came men accepted it as something which supplied what  they thought to be lacking in their native cults; rich and poor, gentle  and simple, all welcomed it, and the philosopher as well as the  ignorant man rejoiced in the hope of a future life which it gave to  them.  Its Egyptian origin caused it to be regarded with the  profoundest interest, and its priests were most careful to make the  temples of Isis quite different from those of the national gods, and to  decorate them with obelisks, sphinxes, shrines, altars, etc., which  were either imported from temples in Egypt, or were copied from  Egyptian originals.  In the temples of Isis services were held at  daybreak and in the early afternoon daily, and everywhere these were  attended by crowds of people.  The holy water used in the libations and  for sprinkling the people was Nile water, specially imported from  Egypt, and to the votaries of the goddess it symbolized the seed of the  god Osiris, which germinated and brought forth fruit through the spells  of the goddess Isis.  The festivals and processions of Isis were  everywhere most popular, and were enjoyed by learned and unlearned  alike.  In fact, the Isis-play which was acted annually in November,  and the festival of the blessing of the ship, which took place in the  spring, were the most important festivals of the year.  Curiously  enough, all the oldest gods and goddesses of Egypt passed into absolute  oblivion, with the exception of Osiris (Sarapis), Isis, Anubis the  physician, and Harpokrates, the child of Osiris and Isis, and these,  from being the ancestral spirits of a comparatively obscure African  tribe in early dynastic times, became for several hundreds of years the  principal objects of worship of some of the most cultured and  intellectual nations.  The treatise of Plutarch De Iside helps to  explain how this came about, and for those who study the Egyptian  Legend of Isis and Osiris the work has considerable importance.            THE HISTORY OF CREATION--A.          THE BOOK OF KNOWING THE EVOLUTIONS[FN#49] OF RA, AND OF OVERTHROWING  APEP.        [FN#49]  Kheperu.  The verb Kheper means \"to make, to form, to produce,  to become, and to roll;\" kheperu here means \"the things which come into  being through the rollings of the ball of the god Kheper (the roller),\"  i.e., the Sun.        [These are] the words which the god Neb-er-tcher spake after he had  come into being:--\"I am he who came into being in the form of the god  Khepera, and I am the creator of that which came into being, that is to  say, I am the creator of everything which came into being: now the  things which I created, and which came forth out of my month after that  I had come into being myself were exceedingly many.  The sky (or  heaven) had not come into being, the earth did not exist, and the  children of the earth[FN#50], and the creeping, things, had not been  made at that time.  I myself raised them up from out of Nu[FN#51], from  a state of helpless inertness.  I found no place whereon I could stand.  I worked a charm[FN#52] upon my own heart (or, will), I laid the  foundation [of things] by Maat,[FN#53] and I made everything which had  form.  I was [then] one by myself, for I had not emitted from myself  the god Shu, and I had not spit out from myself the goddess Tefnut; and  there existed no other who could work with me.  I laid the foundations  [of things] in my own heart, and there came into being multitudes of  created things, which came into being from the created things which  were born from the created things which arose from what they brought  forth.  I had union with my closed hand, and I embraced my shadow as a  wife, and I poured seed into my own mouth, and I sent forth from myself  issue in the form of the gods Shu and Tefnut. Saith my father Nu:--My  Eye was covered up behind them (i.e., Shu. and Tefnut), but after two  hen periods had passed from the time when they departed from me, from  being one god I became three gods, and I came into being in the earth.  Then Shu and Tefnut rejoiced from out of the inert watery mass wherein  they I were, and they brought to me my Eye (i.e., the Sun). Now after  these things I gathered together my members, and I wept over them, and  men and women sprang into being from the tears which came forth from my  Eye.  And when my Eye came to me, and found that I had made another  [Eye] in place where it was (i.e., the Moon), it was wroth with (or,  raged at) me, whereupon I endowed it (i.e., the second Eye) with [some  of] the splendour which I had made for the first [Eye], and I made it  to occupy its place in my Face, and henceforth it ruled throughout all  this earth.\"        [FN#50]  i.e., serpents and snakes, or perhaps plants.

[FN#53]  i.e., by exact and definite rules.        \"When there fell on them their moment[FN#54] through plant-like clouds,  I restored what had been taken away from them, and I appeared from out  of the plant-like clouds.  I created creeping things of every kind, and  everything which came into being from them.  Shu and Tefnut brought  forth [Seb and] Nut; and Seb and Nut brought forth Osiris, and Heru-  khent-an-maati,[FN#55] and Set, and Isis, and Nephthys[FN#56] at one  birth, one after the other, and they produced their multitudinous  offspring in this earth.\"        [FN#54]  i.e., the period of calamity wherein their light was veiled  through plant-like clouds.

THE BOOK OF KNOWING THE EVOLUTIONS OF RA, AND OF OVERTHROWING APEP.        [These are] the words of the god Neb-er-tcher, who said: \"I am the  creator of what hath come into being, and I myself came into being  under the form of the god Khepera, and I came into being in primeval  time.  I came into being in the form of Khepera, and I am the creator  of what did come into being, that is to say, I formed myself out of the  primeval matter, and I made and formed myself out of the substance  which existed in primeval time.  My name is AUSARES (i.e., Osiris), who  is the primeval matter of primeval matter.  I have done my will in  everything in this earth.  I have spread myself abroad therein, and I  have made strong my hand.  I was ONE by myself, for they (i.e., the  gods) had not been brought forth, and I had emitted from myself neither  Shu nor Tefnut.  I brought my own name[FN#57] into my mouth as a word  of power, and I forthwith came into being under the form of things  which are and under the form of Khepera.  I came into being from out of  primeval matter, and from the beginning I appeared under the form of  the multitudinous things which exist; nothing whatsoever existed at  that time in this earth, and it was I who made whatsoever was made.  I  was ONE: by myself, and there was no other being who worked with me in  that place.  I made all the things under the forms of which I appeared  then by means of the Soul-God which I raised into firmness at that time  from out of Nu, from a state of inactivity.  I found no place  whatsoever there whereon I could stand, I worked by the power of a  spell by means of my heart, I laid a foundation [for things] before me,  and whatsoever was made, I made.  I was ONE by myself, and I laid the  foundation of things [by means of] my heart, and I made the other  things which came into being, and the things of Khepera which were made  were manifold, and their offspring came into existence from the things  to which they gave birth.  I it was who emitted Shu, and I it was who  emitted Tefnut, and from being the ONE, god (or, the only god) I became  three gods; the two other gods who came into being on this earth sprang  from me, and Shu and Tefnut rejoiced (or, were raised up) from out of  Nu in which they were. Now behold, they brought my Eye to me after two  hen periods since the time when they went forth from me. I gathered  together my members which had appeared in my own body, and afterwards  I had union with my hand, and my heart (or, will) came unto me from out  of my hand, and the seed fell into my mouth, and I emitted from myself  the gods Shu and Tefnut, and so from being the ONE god (or, the only,  god) I became three gods; thus the two other gods who came into being  on this earth sprang from me, and Shu and Tefnut"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9457"],[0,"Travels in Arabia; comprehending an account of those territories in Hedjaz which (#12)"],[1," nevertheless established several  manufactures, which render them, in some parts of the country, entirely  independent of foreign supplies. The inhabitants of the Hedjaz appear to  have only two occupations; commerce, and the pasture of cattle. The  first engrosses the mind of almost every town-inhabitant, not excepting  even the olemas, or learned men. Every one endeavours to employ whatever  capital he possesses in some advantageous traffic, that he may live  without much bodily exertion; for these people seem to be as averse to  the latter as they are eager to endure all the anxieties and risks  inseparable from the former. It is even difficult to find persons who  will perform the common    [p.45] labour of porters, &c.: those who follow similar occupations are  for the most part foreigners from Egypt or Syria, and negro pilgrims,  who thus earn a very comfortable livelihood, and generally make but a  temporary stay at Djidda. The only race of Arabians whom I have found  more industrious than the others, are the people of Hadramaut, or, as  they are called, El Hadáreme. Many of them act as servants in the  merchants houses, as door-keepers, messengers, and porters, in which  latter character they are preferred to all others for their honesty and  industry. Almost every considerable town in the East has its particular  race of porters: at Aleppo, the Armenians of the mountains of Asia Minor  are in request for this office; at Damascus, the people of Mount  Libanus; at Cairo, the Berábera Nubians; at Mekka and Djidda, the  Hadáreme, who, like those of Syria, are mountaineers. It is well known  that similar qualifications recommend my countrymen, the Alpine  mountaineers, to the same offices at Paris. There is another striking  similarity among the natives of all these countries; they generally  return home with their gains, and pass the remainder of their days with  their families. Notwithstanding this source, there is a great and almost  absolute want of free servants in the Hedjaz. No man who has been born  in one of the holy cities, will act as a menial servant, unless he be  driven to it by the fear of dying from want of food; and no sooner is he  in good condition, than he ceases to labour, and either turns pedlar or  beggar. The number of beggars at Mekka and Djidda is very great, and it  is a common remark among the merchants of the latter place, that a  Djiddawy will never work while he can possibly maintain himself by  begging. Mendicity is much encouraged by the pilgrims, who are fond of  displaying their charity on first touching holy ground at this place.    Respecting the people of Djidda and their character, I shall have  occasion to make further observations in describing the inhabitants of  Mekka, whom generally they resemble. In fact, all the    [p.46] respectable families have houses at both places, and frequently  pass from one to the other.    Djidda is governed by a pasha of three tails, who takes precedence of  most others, from the connexion of this place with the holy cities; but  the government of it is an honour little esteemed by the Turkish  grandees, who have always regarded Djidda as a place rather of exile  than of preferment, and it has often been conferred on disgraced  statesmen. The Pasha styles himself not only Wály or governor of Djidda,  but of Sowakin and Habesh; and in support of this title, keeps custom-  house officers at Sowakin and Massoua, which, prior to the government of  Mohammed Aly, were entirely dependent on the sherif.    The pashalik of Djidda was reduced to perfect insignificance by the  power of the sherif of Mekka; and the title had become merely an  honorary distinction, enjoyed by the individual on whom it had been  bestowed, while he resided in some provincial town of Turkey or at  Constantinople, without ever attempting to take possession of his  government. There was, however, an exception in 1803, when, after the  total evacuation of Egypt by the French, Sherif Pasha went to Djidda  with a body of four or five hundred soldiers; but like all his  predecessors, he became the mere instrument of Sherif Ghaleb, and in  1804 his career was terminated by sudden death-the fate of many former  Pashas both of Djidda and of Mekka.    According to the orders of the Sultan, whose nominal supremacy over the  Hedjaz was recognised until the last Wahaby conquest, the revenue  arising from the customs collected at Djidda should have been divided  equally between the Pasha and the sherif of Mekka, while the former was  to have exclusively the command of the town. When the Turks began to  subdue Asia, the sherif received only one third of this revenue, and it  was not until the year of the Hedjira 1042 that he obtained the  half. [Vide Asámi, History of the Hedjaz.] Subsequently,    [p.47] however, the sherif not only usurped the government of Djidda,  but also applied the customs wholly to his own use, the Pasha being  rendered altogether dependent upon his bounty.    Soon after the death of Sherif Pasha, the Sherif Ghaleb was obliged to  surrender Mekka to the Wahabys, having been besieged, the preceding  year, in Djidda, by Saoud. He then openly declared himself a proselyte  to the Wahaby faith, and a subject of the Wahaby chief, though he still  retained full possession of Djidda and the produce of its customs, which  formed the principal part of his income. The Wahabys did not enter the  town, which ostensibly declared in favour of their doctrines. The  Turkish soldiers were now obliged to retire towards Egypt, or elsewhere;  and from that period till 1811 all Turkish authority was entirely  excluded from the Hedjaz.    In 1811, Mohammed Aly Pasha commenced his operations against the  Wahabys, by sending a body of troops under the command of his son  Tousoun Bey, who was defeated in the passes between Yembo and Medina. A  second, in 1812, was more successful: while Tousoun, in September of  that year, took Medina, Mustafa Bey, the Pashas brother-in-law,  proceeded directly with the cavalry under his command to Djidda, Mekka,  and Tayf; all which surrendered, almost without bloodshed. The Sherif  Ghaleb, who, from the moment he began to apprehend the probable success  of Alys expedition, had entered into a secret correspondence with  Egypt, now openly declared himself a friend to the Turks, who entered  Djidda as friends. The title of Pasha of Djidda was soon after conferred  by the Porte upon Tousoun, as a reward for his services. The details of  this war will be given in another place; I shall, therefore, only  mention here, that after the Osmanlys, or Turks, entered Djidda, a  quarrel arose between the Pasha and the sherif respecting the customs,  which were to be divided between them, but which the Pasha, being now  superior in power, kept wholly to himself. He sent the sherif as  prisoner to Turkey, and    [p.48] since that event, the town has continued wholly at his disposal,  the new sherif, Yahya, being a servant in the pay of Tousoun.    Djidda, in the time of Sherif Ghaleb, was governed either by himself,  when he resided there, or, during his absence, by an officer called  Vizir, under whose orders the police of the town was placed; while the  collection of the customs (gumruk) was entrusted to another officer,  called the gumrukdjy; and the police of the harbour to the Emir el  Bahhr, or the Chief of the Sea, a title equivalent to harbour-  master. In later times the vizir was a black slave of Ghaleb, and much  detested for his pride and despotic conduct. Ghaleb seldom resided in  Djidda, his continual intrigues with the Bedouins, and his schemes  against the Wahaby tribes, requiring his presence in the more central  position of Mekka.    The form of government which existed under Ghaleb has not been changed  by the Osmanlys. It happened that Tousoun Pasha could seldom reside in  his capital, being placed under the command of his father, who received  from the Porte the entire direction of the Hedjaz war, and the disposal  of all the resources of that country. Tousoun was more usefully employed  in moving about with the troops under his command, till he returned to  Cairo in the autumn of 1815. Since the year 1812, a military commander  has always resided in the town, with a garrison of two or three hundred  men, which the Pasha takes care to change every three or four months.  The collection of the customs, the entire regulation of civil affairs,  the correspondence with Cairo and Mekka, the conveyance of troops,  stores, and government merchandize between Egypt and Djidda, and the  Pashas treasury, are in the hands of this commander, whose name is Seyd  Ali Odjakly. His father was from Asia Minor, and belonged to the corps  of Janissaries (Odjak), whence his son takes the epithet of Odjakly. He  is disliked by the merchants of Djidda, because they remember his  selling nuts in the streets about twenty years ago. In the time of  Sherif Ghaleb,    [p.49] he was employed by him in his private commercial affairs; and as  he possesses great talents and activity, joined to a good knowledge of  the Turkish language, Mohammed Ali could with difficulty have pitched  upon a person more competent to fill the post which he now holds.    The public revenue of Djidda arises almost exclusively from the customs,  called here ashour, or tithes. This ought legally to be, as I was  informed, ten per cent. upon all imported goods; but, in consequence of  abuses which have been long practised, some articles of merchandize are  charged much higher, while others pay less. During the latter period of  the sherifs power, coffee was charged at five dollars the quintal,  which may be computed as fifteen to twenty per cent. Spices pay somewhat  less than ten per cent.; India piece-goods something more. Great  irregularity, therefore, exists in levying the customs; and it is in the  power of the officer of customs to favour his friends without incurring  any"]]]
