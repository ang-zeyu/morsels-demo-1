This they carry down to  the maritime towns, and the proceeds are invested in cotton cloths and  brass utensils, dried fish, and other commodities, with which the  _tavalams_ supply the secluded villages of the interior.    _The Buffalo_.--Buffaloes abound in all parts of Ceylon, but they are  only to be seen in their native wildness in the vast solitudes of the  northern and eastern provinces, where rivers, lagoons, and dilapidated  tanks abound. In these they delight to immerse themselves, till only  their heads appear above the surface; or, enveloped in mud to protect  themselves from the assaults of insects, they luxuriate in the long  sedges by the water margins. When the buffalo is browsing, a crow will  frequently be seen stationed on its back, engaged in freeing it from the  ticks and other pests which attach themselves to its leathery hide, the  smooth brown surface of which, unprotected by hair, shines with an  unpleasant polish in the sunlight. When in motion a buffalo throws back  its clumsy head till the huge horns rest on its shoulders, and the nose  is presented in a line with the eyes.    The temper of the wild buffalo is morose and uncertain, and such is its  strength and courage that in the Hindu epic of the Ramayana its  onslaught is compared to that of the tiger.[1] It is never quite safe to  approach them, if disturbed in their pasture or alarmed from their  repose in the shallow lakes. On such occasions they hurry into line,  draw up in defensive array, with a few of the oldest bulls in advance;  and, wheeling in circles, their horns clashing with a loud sound as they  clank them together in their rapid evolutions, they prepare for attack;  but generally, after a menacing display the herd betake themselves to  flight; then forming again at a safer distance, they halt as before,  elevating their nostrils, and throwing back their heads to take a  defiant survey of the intruders. The true sportsman rarely molests them,  so huge a creature affording no worthy mark for his skill, and their  wanton slaughter adds nothing to the supply of food for their assailant.    [Footnote 1: CAREY and MARSHMAN'S Transl. vol. i. p. 430, 447.]    In the Hambangtotte country, where the Singhalese domesticate buffaloes,  and use them to assist in the labour of the rice lands, the villagers  are much annoyed by the wild ones, that mingle with the tame when sent  out to the woods to pasture; and it constantly happens that a savage  stranger, placing himself at the head of the tame herd, resists the  attempts of the owners to drive them homewards at sunset. In the  districts of Putlam and the Seven Corles, buffaloes are generally used  for draught; and in carrying heavy loads of salt from the coast towards  the interior, they drag a cart over roads which would defy the weaker  strength of bullocks.    In one place between Batticaloa and Trincomalie I found the natives  making an ingenious use of them when engaged in shooting water-fowl in  the vast salt marshes and muddy lakes. Being an object to which the  birds are accustomed, the Singhalese train the buffalo to the sport,  and, concealed behind, the animal browsing listlessly along, they guide  it by ropes attached to its horns, and thus creep undiscovered within  shot of the flock. The same practice prevails, I believe, in some of the  northern parts of India, where they are similarly trained to assist the  sportsman in approaching deer. One of these \"sporting buffaloes\" sells  for a considerable sum.    In the thick forests which cover the Passdun Corle, to the east, and  south of Caltura, the natives use the sporting buffalo in another way,  to assist in hunting deer and wild hogs. A bell is attached to its neck,  and a box or basket with one side open is securely strapped on its back.  This at nightfall is lighted by flambeaux of wax, and the buffalo  bearing it, is driven slowly into the jungle. The huntsmen, with their  fowling pieces, keep close under the darkened side, and as it moves  slowly onwards, the wild animals, startled by the sound, and bewildered  by the light, steal cautiously towards it in stupified fascination. Even  the snakes, I am assured, will be attracted by this extraordinary  object; and the leopard too falls a victim to curiosity.    There is a peculiarity in the formation of the buffalo's foot, which,  though it must have attracted attention, I have never seen mentioned by  naturalists. It is equivalent to the arrangement which distinguishes the  foot of the reindeer from that of the stag and the antelope. In the  latter, the hoofs, being constructed for lightness and flight, are  compact and vertical; but, in the reindeer, the joints of the tarsal  bones admit of lateral expansion, and the front hoofs curve upwards,  while the two secondary ones behind (which are but slightly developed in  the fallow deer and others of the same family) are prolonged vertically  till, in certain positions, they are capable of being applied to the  ground, thus adding to the circumference and sustaining power of the  foot. It has been usually suggested as the probable design of this  structure, that it is to enable the reindeer to shovel away the snow in  order to reach the lichens beneath it; but I apprehend that another use  of it has been overlooked, that of facilitating its movements in search  of food by increasing the difficulty of its sinking in the snow.    A formation precisely analogous in the buffalo seems to point to a  corresponding design. The ox, whose life is spent on firm ground, has  the bones of the foot so constructed as to afford the most solid support  to an animal of its great weight; but in the buffalo, which delights in  the morasses on the margins of pools and rivers, the construction of the  foot resembles that of the reindeer. The tarsi in front extend almost  horizontally from the upright bones of the leg, and spread apart widely  on touching the ground; the hoofs are flattened and broad, with the  extremities turned upwards; and the false hoofs behind descend till they  make a clattering sound as the animal walks. In traversing the marshes,  this combination of abnormal incidents serves to give extraordinary  breadth to the foot, and not only prevents the buffalo from sinking  inconveniently in soft ground[1], but at the same time presents no  obstacle to the withdrawal of its foot from the mud.    [Footnote 1: PROFESSOR OWEN has noticed a similar fact regarding the  rudiments of the second and fifth digits in the instance of the elk and  bison, which have them largely expanded where they inhabit swampy  ground; whilst they are nearly obliterated in the camel and dromedary,  that traverse arid deserts.--OWEN _on Limbs_, p. 34; see also BELL _on  the Hand_, ch. iii.]    The buffalo, like the elk, is sometimes found in Ceylon as an albino,  with purely white hair and a pink iris.    _Deer_.--\"Deer,\" says the truthful old chronicler, Robert Knox, \"are in  great abundance in the woods, from the largeness of a cow to the  smallness of a hare, for here is a creature in this land no bigger than  the latter, though every part rightly resembleth a deer: it is called  _meminna_, of a grey colour, with white spots and good meat.\"[1] The  little creature which thus dwelt in the recollection of the old man, as  one of the memorials of his long captivity, is the small \"musk deer\"[2]  so called in India, although neither sex is provided with a musk-bag.  The Europeans in Ceylon know it by the name of the \"moose deer;\" and in  all probability the terms _musk_ and _moose_ are both corruptions of the  Dutch word \"_muis_,\" or \"mouse\" deer, a name particularly applicable to  the timid and crouching attitudes and aspect of this beautiful little  creature. Its extreme length never reaches two feet; and of those which  were domesticated about my house, few exceeded ten inches in height,  their graceful limbs being of proportionate delicacy. It possesses long  and extremely large tusks, with which it can inflict a severe bite. The  interpreter moodliar of Negombo had a _milk white_ meminna in 1847,  which he designed to send home as an acceptable present to Her Majesty,  but it was unfortunately killed by an accident.[3]    [Footnote 1: KNOX'S _Relation, &c._, book i. c. 6.]    [Footnote 2: Moschus meminna.]    [Footnote 3: When the English look possession of Kandy, in 1803, they  found \"five beautiful milk-white deer in the palace, which was noted as  a very extraordinary thing.\"--_Letter_ in Appendix to PERCIVAL'S  _Ceylon_, p. 428. The writer does not say of what species they were.]    [Illustration: \"MOOSE\" DEER (MOSCHUS MEMINNA)]    _Ceylon Elk_.--In the mountains, the Ceylon elk[1], which reminds one of  the red deer of Scotland, attains the height of four or five feet; it  abounds in all shady places that are intersected by rivers; where,  though its chase affords an endless resource to the sportsman, its  venison scarcely equals in quality the inferior beef of the lowland ox.  In the glades and park-like openings that diversify the great forests of  the interior, the spotted Axis troops in herds as numerous as the fallow  deer in England: but, in journeys through the jungle, when often  dependent on the guns of our party for the precarious supply of the  table, we found the flesh of the Axis[2] and the Muntjac[3] a sorry  substitute for that of the pea-fowl, the jungle-cock, and flamingo. The  occurrence of albinos is very frequent in troops of the axis. Deer's  horns are an article of export from Ceylon, and considerable quantities  are annually sent to the United Kingdom.    [Footnote 1: Rusa Aristotelis. Dr. GRAY has lately shown that this is  the great _axis_ of Cuvier.--_Oss. Foss._ 502. t. 39; f. 10: The  Singhalese, on following the elk, frequently effect their approaches by  so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13331"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Chichester (1901) (#13)"],[1,"a few feet below the parapet was  renewed at the same time. The flying-buttresses are thirteenth-century  additions of the same date as the vaults within; and those three  nearest the transept abut on parts of the twelfth-century flat  buttresses. The flat projection was continued up to the parapet at a  later date, probably when the parapet itself was built on. But the  fourth buttress also abuts upon a slightly projecting flat strip of  buttressing. In this case, however, but not in the others, the flat  strip and the flying-buttress are of the same width and built as one  piece of structure. The third and fourth flying-buttresses have a  secondary, and apparently later, arch of fine grained white stone  beneath their larger arches.    The copings on the backs of these buttresses are not weathered like  those of the nave, and, except the one next the transept, each is  covered with lead. There are no pinnacles to them above the aisle  wall. The fourteenth-century builders had not touched them, as they  did those south of the nave. There are, too, no gutters along their  backs. It is curious that this method of carrying the water away from  the upper roofs over the lower ones should not have been adopted when  the parapets were put up.    [Illustration: THE CHOIR AND CENTRAL TOWER FROM THE SOUTH-EAST. _S.B.  Bolas & Co., photo_.]    The outer wall of the choir aisle is one of the most interesting  portions of the building, from an archaeological as well as an  architectural standpoint. It shows three of the arched heads of small  twelfth-century windows that used to light the earlier triforium  gallery. One of these has now a fifteenth-century insertion beneath  it. This is in the second bay from the transept. It is a small window  with a cusped head and a square label-mould above it. In the same area  of walling there are shown the levels of the cut string-course that  ran along under the sills of the twelfth-century aisle windows. It is  the same string and at the same level as it appears upon the  south-west angle of the transept and the south-west tower of the west  front. It shows, too, in the second bay, the level of the old abaci  which ran across from each capital in the window jambs and stopped  against the sides of the buttresses. There is also the continuous  chamfer course that ran along the walls above the heads of these aisle  windows. In proof of these things there is even now one of these same  old windows in almost its original state within the little chamber  known as the priest-vicars' vestry. This window is in the bay of aisle  walling immediately against the transept wall. The string-courses of  the old windows were continued round the later buttresses. In the  fourth bay, above the point of the window arch, the curve of the  original apse of the ambulatory is just traceable; but beyond this  point eastwards the twelfth-century walling has disappeared until we  meet it again in the lady-chapel. There is a small buttress in the  fourth bay marking the junction between the two periods of masonry. In  the second and third bays part of the twelfth-century top to the aisle  walls remains. The roof may have had eaves originally, but now there  is a parapet of about the same date as the present buttresses; and the  projection of this parapet is carried upon the corbels that were  carved and built in before the second fire occurred. The space between  each corbel is bridged over by small single stones cut out to the  shape of a semicircular arch.    The windows in the second, third, and fourth bays differ in size and  shape from each other; that in the second bay has a pointed arch and  no tracery, square abaci and the remains of carved capitals. The angle  shafts and bases are gone. They were all inserted at about the same  time; but that in the third bay has had some poor modern tracery  without cusps added to it, and that in the fourth bay is a more  recent, insertion than the one next to it. In the third and fourth  bays just above the low chamfered base of the wall are three  semicircular markings cut on the wall, but there is nothing to explain  their existence. In the fourth bay close beneath the sill of the  window is a stone built into the wall, upon which a dedication cross  is cut. At the fifth bay the east walk of the cloisters joins the wall  of the aisle; its roof partly hides a window, above which is a square  panel of the fifteenth century. This panel indicates the position of a  window, for the jambs and mullions of its tracery may be seen within  the church. They are rebated for shutters, the old hooks for which  also remain. The south-east angle turret of the presbytery has lately  been rebuilt; so also has that on the north-east angle. They are each  of them octagonal in form, but differ in detail, in imitation of those  they replace.    The large rose window in the gable of the #East End# is of about  the same date as the vaulting over the south transept, since they  possess kindred details. In design it is a simple circle, with seven  others within it of equal diameter. Portions of the coping of an  earlier and lower pointed gable are bedded in the wall. Under the  string beneath the rose window are three windows grouped as a triplet,  with no label moulding. The centre light is higher than the others.  Though each has been much repaired, the early thirteenth-century  detail has been retained. The abaci of the capitals are square. The  windows have no tracery, and are probably quite fifty years earlier in  date than the large rose above them.    The exterior of the small chapel to the south has a square weathered  angle buttress. On its south side is a window of the same date as the  rest of the chapel, and like the triplet in the gable of the  presbytery in character and date. Its east end has been altered since  the chapel was finished. First a small rose window, recently renewed,  of the same date and type as that in the presbytery gable, was  inserted under the earlier narrow window close to the gable point;  then the original east window was removed, and a larger one was put  in, having three lights and a traceried head with cusped work of late  fourteenth-or early fifteenth-century work. The sill of the old window  was lowered to give more length. Most of the window now to be seen is  the result of recent restoration. Parts of the old string-courses  remain in the walling.    The south side of the #Lady-Chapel# beyond the chapel just  described has four bays. In each of these is a large three-light  window. The western and smallest one was probably first inserted. Then  the two eastern ones were put in when the two east bays were added to  the older lady-chapel. The other window appears the latest of the  four; or else may it not be that before deciding to lengthen the  lady-chapel, the builders first began only with the idea of inserting  some new windows in the older walls? But before this scheme had been  executed they concluded that they would add bodily to the chapel; and  in order to allow the chapel to continue in use while this was being  done, they built the extension first outside, then built up the  connection with the original walls, and inserted their latest window.  Two of the buttresses on this wall are flat. In this they are like  those of the twelfth century; but their upper parts were rebuilt when  the parapet was made. The others are later, and have more projection.  On the north and south of the lady-chapel the wall is finished by a  parapet. It is the same in detail and design as that on the south wall  of the presbytery. So it is probable that Bishop Gilbert de S.  Leophardo, when he lengthened the lady-chapel, caused other work to be  done at the same time.    [Illustration: WINDOWS OF THE LADY-CHAPEL, SOUTH SIDE. _S.B. Bolas &  Co., photo_.]    The lady-chapel has been much restored in many ways, but the old  parapet remains in part on the north side. The tracery of the windows  is interesting, as it shows early examples of cusped forms. The east  end of the lady-chapel has a five-light window, which has been much  repaired. It has been in a measure imitated from the others in the  chapel.    The description of the south side of the chapel applies generally to  the north side. But the windows in two cases have been much more  restored. The chapel north of the lady-chapel has an angle turret like  that on the south. Its east and north windows are fifteenth-century  insertions. And it has a little rose window in the gable not yet  restored, though soon, by decay, it will have disappeared. The smaller  window above it is blocked up. On its north side there is neither a  gutter nor a parapet; but perhaps this is better than the foolish  cornice, with rosettes in it, which has been placed on the wall of the  south chapel to carry a gutter.    The details of the north wall of the presbytery are similar to those  described on the south. But there are no sub-arches to any of the  flying buttresses, and the slopes of each are protected by lead  coverings. And in the exterior of the north aisle the same elements of  structure and design may be discovered, even to the presence of  twelfth-century remains, the curve of the old encircling apse, and the  position of the first sills, abaci, and string-courses. But it should  be noticed that in the eastern bay of this aisle externally, where on  the south there is a fifteenth-century solid square panel, on the  north there is a small round-headed window. But this little window is  of no earlier date than the walls in which it is set. The second and  third windows from the east buttress of the presbytery aisle are  insertions of fifteenth-century type; but they have been so much  renewed and restored that only in the third one does there appear to  be any portion of the original tracery remaining. On the north side of  the choir and presbytery are four very fine old lead rain-water heads  and square lead"]]]
