The manner of the cure was  this; he put a ring that had under the seal a root of one of those sorts  mentioned by Solomon, to the nostrils of the demoniac, after which he  drew out the demon through his nostrils: and when the man fell down  immediately, he abjured him to return unto him no more, making still  mention of Solomon, and reciting the incantations which he composed.\"(2)    (1) H. C. AGRIPPA: _Occult Philosophy_, bk. i. chap. xlvii. (WHITEHEAD'S  edition, pp. 141 and 142).    (2) FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS: _The Antiquities of the Jews_ (trans. by W.  WHISTON), bk. viii. chap. ii., SE 5 (45) to (47).    Enough has been said already to indicate the general nature of  talismanic magic. No one could maintain otherwise than that much of it  is pure nonsense; but the subject should not, therefore, be dismissed as  valueless, or lacking significance. It is past belief that amulets and  talismans should have been believed in for so long unless they APPEARED  to be productive of some of the desired results, though these may have  been due to forces quite other than those which were supposed to be  operative. Indeed, it may be said that there has been no widely held  superstition which does not embody some truth, like some small specks of  gold hidden in an uninviting mass of quartz. As the poet BLAKE put it:  \"Everything possible to be believ'd is an image of truth\";(1) and the  attempt may here be made to extract the gold of truth from the quartz of  superstition concerning talismanic magic. For this purpose the various  theories regarding the supposed efficacy of talismans must be examined.      (1) \"Proverbs of Hell\" (_The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_).      Two of these theories have already been noted, but the doctrine of  effluvia admittedly applied only to a certain class of amulets, and, I  think, need not be seriously considered. The \"astral-spirit theory\" (as  it may be called), in its ancient form at any rate, is equally untenable  to-day. The discoveries of new planets and new metals seem destructive  of the belief that there can be any occult connection between planets,  metals, and the days of the week, although the curious fact discovered  by Mr OLD, to which I have referred (footnote, p. 63@@@), assuredly  demands an explanation, and a certain validity may, perhaps, be allowed  to astrological symbolism. As concerns the belief in the existence  of what may be called (although the term is not a very happy one)  \"discarnate spirits,\" however, the matter, in view of the modern  investigation of spiritistic and other abnormal psychical phenomena,  stands in a different position. There can, indeed, be little doubt that  very many of the phenomena observed at spiritistic seances come under  the category of deliberate fraud, and an even larger number, perhaps,  can be explained on the theory of the subconscious self. I think,  however, that the evidence goes to show that there is a residuum of  phenomena which can only be explained by the operation, in some way,  of discarnate intelligences.(1) Psychical research may be said to  have supplied the modern world with the evidence of the existence of  discarnate personalities, and of their operation on the material plane,  which the ancient world lacked. But so far as our present subject is  concerned, all the evidence obtainable goes to show that the phenomena  in question only take place in the presence of what is called \"a  medium\"--a person of peculiar nervous or psychical organisation.  That this is the case, moreover, appears to be the general belief of  spiritists on the subject. In the sense, then, in which \"a talisman\"  connotes a material object of such a nature that by its aid the powers  of discarnate intelligences may become operative on material things, we  might apply the term \"talisman\" to the nervous system of a medium:  but then that would be the only talisman. Consequently, even if one is  prepared to admit the whole of modern spiritistic theory, nothing is  thereby gained towards a belief in talismans, and no light is shed upon  the subject.      (1) The publications of The Society for Psychical Research, and  FREDERICK MYERS' monumental work on _Human Personality and its Survival  of Bodily Death_, should be specially consulted. I have attempted a  brief discussion of modern spiritualism and psychical research in my  _Matter, Spirit, and the Cosmos_ (1910), chap. ii.      Another theory concerning talismans which commended itself to many of  the old occult philosophers, PARACELSUS for instance, is what may be  called the \"occult force\" theory. This theory assumes the existence of  an occult mental force, a force capable of being exerted by the human  will, apart from its usual mode of operation by means of the body. It  was believed to be possible to concentrate this mental energy and infuse  it into some suitable medium, with the production of a talisman, which  was thus regarded as a sort of accumulator for mental energy. The theory  seems a fantastic one to modern thought, though, in view of the many  startling phenomena brought to light by psychical research, it is not  advisable to be too positive regarding the limitations of the powers of  the human mind. However, I think we shall find the element of truth in  the otherwise absurd belief in talismans by means of what may be called,  not altogether fancifully perhaps, a transcendental interpretation of  this \"occult force\" theory. I suggest, that is, that when a believer  makes a talisman, the transference of the occult energy is ideal, not  actual; that the power, believed to reside in the talisman itself, is  the power due to the reflex action of the believer's mind. The power  of what transcendentalists call \"the imagination\" cannot be denied; for  example, no one can deny that a man with a firm conviction that such a  success will be achieved by him, or such a danger avoided, will be far  more likely to gain his desire, other conditions being equal, than one  of a pessimistic turn of mind. The mere conviction itself is a factor in  success, or a factor in failure, according to its nature; and it seems  likely that herein will be found a true explanation of the effects  believed to be due to the power of the talisman.    On the other hand, however, we must beware of the exaggerations into  which certain schools of thought have fallen in their estimates of the  powers of the imagination. These exaggerations are particularly  marked in the views which are held by many nowadays with regard to  \"faith-healing,\" although the \"Christian Scientists\" get out of the  difficulty--at least to their own satisfaction--by ascribing their  alleged cures to the Power of the Divine Mind, and not to the power of  the individual mind.    Of course the real question involved in this \"transcendental theory  of talismans\" as I may, perhaps, call it, is that of the operation of  incarnate spirit on the plane of matter. This operation takes place only  through the medium of the nervous system, and it has been suggested,(1)  to avoid any violation of the law of the conservation of energy, that  it is effected, not by the transference, as is sometimes supposed, of  energy from the spiritual to the material plane, but merely by means  of directive control over the expenditure of energy derived by the body  from purely physical sources, _e.g_. the latent chemical energy bound up  in the food eaten and the oxygen breathed.      (1) _Cf_ Sir OLIVER LODGE: _Life and Matter_ (1907), especially chap.  ix.; and W. HIBBERT, F.I.C.: _Life and Energy_ (1904).      I am not sure that this theory really avoids the difficulty which it is  intended to obviate;(1) but it is at least an interesting one, and  at any rate there may be modes in which the body, under the directive  control of the spirit, may expend energy derived from the material  plane, of which we know little or nothing. We have the testimony of many  eminent authorities(2) to the phenomenon of the movement of physical  objects without contact at spiritistic seances. It seems to me that the  introduction of discarnate intelligences to explain this phenomenon is  somewhat gratuitous--the psychic phenomena which yield evidence of the  survival of human personality after bodily death are of a different  character. For if we suppose this particular phenomenon to be due to  discarnate spirits, we must, in view of what has been said concerning  \"mediums,\" conclude that the movements in question are not produced by  these spirits DIRECTLY, but through and by means of the nervous  system of the medium present. Evidently, therefore, the means for the  production of the phenomenon reside in the human nervous system (or, at  any rate, in the peculiar nervous system of \"mediums\"), and all that  is lacking is intelligence or initiative to use these means. This  intelligence or initiative can surely be as well supplied by the  sub-consciousness as by a discarnate intelligence. Consequently, it does  not seem unreasonable to suppose that equally remarkable phenomena may  have been produced by the aid of talismans in the days when these  were believed in, and may be produced to-day, if one has sufficient  faith--that is to say, produced by man when in the peculiar condition of  mind brought about by the intense belief in the power of a talisman. And  here it should be noted that the term \"talisman\" may be applied to  any object (or doctrine) that is believed to possess peculiar power or  efficacy. In this fact, I think, is to be found the peculiar danger of  erroneous doctrines which promise extraordinary benefits, here and now  on the material plane, to such as believe in them. Remarkable results  may follow an intense belief in such doctrines, which,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12753"],[0,"The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (#13)"],[1,"of his hand, and said, \"Knight, why dost thou so watch  me? be ashamed, and eat thy meat, and do that which thou camest for.\"    \"Thou sayest well,\" cried Sir Balin, rising fiercely; \"now will I  straightway do that which I came to do, as thou shalt find.\" With that he  whirled his sword aloft and struck him downright on the head, and clove  his skull asunder to the shoulder.    \"Give me the truncheon,\" cried out Sir Balin to his lady, \"wherewith he  slew thy knight.\" And when she gave it him--for she had always carried it  about with her, wherever she had gone--he smote him through the body with  it, and said, \"With that truncheon didst thou treacherously murder a good  knight, and now it sticketh in thy felon body.\"    Then he called to the father of the wounded son, who had come with him to  Listeniss, and said, \"Now take as much blood as thou wilt, to heal thy son  withal.\"    But now arose a terrible confusion, and all the knights leaped from the  table to slay Balin, King Pelles himself the foremost, who cried out,  \"Knight, thou hast slain my brother at my board; die, therefore, die, for  thou shalt never leave this castle.\"    \"Slay me, thyself, then,\" shouted Balin.    \"Yea,\" said the king, \"that will I! for no other man shall touch thee, for  the love I bear my brother.\"    Then King Pelles caught in his hand a grim weapon and smote eagerly at  Balin, but Balin put his sword between his head and the king's stroke, and  saved himself but lost his sword, which fell down smashed and shivered  into pieces by the blow. So being weaponless he ran to the next room to  find a sword, and so from room to room, with King Pelles after him, he in  vain ever eagerly casting his eyes round every place to find some weapon.    At last he ran into a chamber wondrous richly decked, where was a bed all  dressed with cloth of gold, the richest that could be thought of, and one  who lay quite still within the bed; and by the bedside stood a table of  pure gold borne on four silver pillars, and on the table stood a  marvellous spear, strangely wrought.    When Sir Balin saw the spear he seized it in his hand, and turned upon  King Pelles, and smote at him so fiercely and so sore that he dropped  swooning to the ground.    But at that Dolorous and awful Stroke the castle rocked and rove  throughout, and all the walls fell crashed and breaking to the earth, and  Balin himself fell also in their midst, struck as it were to stone, and  powerless to move a hand or foot. And so three days he lay amidst the  ruins, until Merlin came and raised him up and brought him a good horse,  and bade him ride out of that land as swiftly as he could.    [Illustration: The castle rocked and rove throughout, and all the walls  fell crashed and breaking to the earth.]    \"May I not take the damsel with me I brought hither?\" said Sir Balin.    \"Lo! where she lieth dead,\" said Merlin. \"Ah, little knowest thou, Sir  Balin, what thou hast done; for in this castle and that chamber which thou  didst defile, was the blood of our Lord Christ! and also that most holy  cup--the Sangreal--wherefrom the wine was drunk at the last supper of our  Lord. Joseph of Arimathea brought it to this land, when first he came here  to convert and save it. And on that bed of gold it was himself who lay,  and the strange spear beside him was the spear wherewith the soldier  Longus smote our Lord, which evermore had dripped with blood. King Pelles  is the nearest kin to Joseph in direct descent, wherefore he held these  holy things in trust; but now have they all gone at thy dolorous stroke,  no man knoweth whither; and great is the damage to this land, which until  now hath been the happiest of all lands, for by that stroke thou hast  slain thousands, and by the loss and parting of the Sangreal the safety of  this realm is put in peril, and its great happiness is gone for evermore.\"    Then Balin departed from Merlin, struck to his soul with grief and sorrow,  and said, \"In this world shall we meet never more.\"    So he rode forth through the fair cities and the country, and found the  people lying dead on every side. And all the living cried out on him as he  passed, \"O Balin, all this misery hast thou done! For the dolorous stroke  thou gavest King Pelles, three countries are destroyed, and doubt not but  revenge will fall on thee at last!\"    When he had passed the boundary of those countries, he was somewhat  comforted, and rode eight days without adventure. Anon he came to a cross,  whereon was written in letters of gold, \"It is not for a knight alone to  ride towards this castle.\" Looking up, he saw a hoary ancient man come  towards him, who said, \"Sir Balin le Savage, thou passest thy bounds this  way; therefore turn back again, it will be best for thee;\" and with these  words he vanished.    Then did he hear a horn blow as it were the deathnote of some hunted  beast. \"That blast,\" said Balin, \"is blown for me, for I am the prey;  though yet I be not dead.\" But as he spoke he saw a hundred ladies with a  great troop of knights come forth to meet him, with bright faces and  great welcome, who led him to the castle and made a great feast, with  dancing and minstrelsy and all manner of joy.    Then the chief lady of the castle said, \"Knight with the two swords, thou  must encounter and fight with a knight hard by, who dwelleth on an island,  for no man may pass this way without encountering him.\"    \"It is a grievous custom,\" answered Sir Balin.    \"There is but one knight to defeat,\" replied the lady.    \"Well,\" said Sir Balin, \"be it as thou wilt. I am ready and quite willing,  and though my horse and my body be full weary, yet is my heart not weary,  save of life. And truly I were glad if I might meet my death.\"    \"Sir,\" said one standing by, \"methinketh your shield is not good; I will  lend you a bigger.\"    \"I thank thee, sir,\" said Balin, and took the unknown shield and left his  own, and so rode forth, and put himself and horse into a boat and came to  the island.    As soon as he had landed, he saw come riding towards him, a knight dressed  all in red, upon a horse trapped in the same colour. When the red knight  saw Sir Balin, and the two swords he wore, he thought it must have been  his brother (for the red knight was Sir Balan), but when he saw the  strange arms on his shield, he forgot the thought, and came against him  fiercely. At the first course they overthrew each other, and both lay  swooning on the ground; but Sir Balin was the most hurt and bruised, for  he was weary and spent with travelling. So Sir Balan rose up first to his  feet and drew his sword, and Sir Balin painfully rose against him and  raised his shield.    Then Sir Balan smote him through the shield and brake his helmet; and Sir  Balin, in return, smote at him with his fated sword, and had wellnigh  slain his brother. So they fought till their breaths failed.    Then Sir Balin, looking up, saw all the castle towers stand full of  ladies. So they went again to battle, and wounded each other full sore,  and paused, and breathed again, and then again began the fight; and this  for many times they did, till all the ground was red with blood. And by  now, each had full grievously wounded the other with seven great wounds,  the least of which might have destroyed the mightiest giant in the world.  But still they rose against each other, although their hauberks now were  all unnailed, and they smiting at each other's naked bodies with their  sharp swords. At the last, Sir Balan, the younger brother, withdrew a  little space and laid him down.    Then said Sir Balin le Savage, \"What knight art thou? for never before  have I found a knight to match me thus.\"    \"My name,\" said he, all faintly, \"is Balan, brother to the good knight Sir  Balin.\"    \"Ah, God!\" cried Balin, \"that ever I should see this day!\" and therewith  fell down backwards in a swoon.    Then Sir Balan crept with pain upon his feet and hands, and put his  brother's helmet off his head, but could not know him by his face, it was  so hewed and bloody. But presently, when Sir Balin came to, he said, \"Oh!  Balan, mine own brother, thou hast slain me, and I thee! All the wide  world saw never greater grief!\"    \"Alas!\" said Sir Balan, \"that I ever saw this day; and through mishap  alone I knew thee not, for when I saw thy two swords, if it had not been  for thy strange shield, I should have known thee for my brother.\"    \"Alas!\" said Balin, \"all this sorrow lieth at the door of one unhappy  knight within the castle, who made me change my shield. If I might live, I  would destroy that castle and its evil customs.\"    \"It were well done,\" said Balan, \"for since I first came hither I have  never been able to depart, for here they made me fight with one who kept  this island, whom I slew, and by enchantment I might never quit it more;  nor couldst thou, brother, hadst thou slain me, and escaped with thine own  life.\"    Anon came the lady of the castle, and when she heard their talk, and saw  their evil case, she wrung her hands and wept bitterly. So Sir Balan  prayed the lady of her gentleness that, for his true service, she would  bury them both together in that place. This she granted, weeping full  sore, and said it should be done right solemnly and richly, and in the  noblest manner possible. Then did they send for a priest, and received the  holy sacrament at his hands. And Balin said, \"Write over us upon our tomb,  that here two brethren slew each other; then shall never good knight or  pilgrim pass this way but he will pray for both our souls.\" And anon Sir  Balan died, but Sir Balin died not till the midnight after; and then they  both were buried.    On the morrow of their death came Merlin, and took Sir Balin's sword and  fixed on it a new pommel, and set it in a mighty stone, which then, by  magic, he made float upon the water. And so, for many years, it floated to  and fro around the island, till it swam down the"]]]
