The numbers  5 and 7--those which occur oftenest--are the most satisfactory because  being of small quantity, they are easily grasped by the eye, and being  odd, they yield a center or axis, so necessary in every architectural  composition. Next in value are the lowest multiples of these numbers  and the least common multiples of any two of them, because the  eye, with a little assistance, is able to resolve them into their  constituent factors. It is part of the art of architecture to  render such assistance, for the eye counts always, consciously or  unconsciously, and when it is confronted with a number of units  greater than it can readily resolve, it is refreshed and rested if  these units are so grouped and arranged that they reveal themselves as  factors of some higher quantity.    [Illustration 82]    [Illustration 83: A NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF GOTHIC TRACERY]    There is a raison d'etre for string courses other than to mark the  position of a floor on the interior of a building, and for quoins and  pilasters other than to indicate the presence of a transverse wall.  These sometimes serve the useful purpose of so subdividing a facade  that the eye estimates the number of its openings without conscious  effort and consequent fatigue (Illustration 82). The tracery of Gothic  windows forms perhaps the highest and finest architectural expression  of number (Illustration 83). Just as thirst makes water more sweet, so  does Gothic tracery confuse the eye with its complexity only the more  greatly to gratify the sight by revealing the inherent simplicity in  which this complexity has its root. Sometimes, as in the case of  the Venetian Ducal Palace, the numbers involved are too great for  counting, but other and different arithmetical truths are portrayed;  for example, the multiplication of the first arcade by 2 in  the second, and this by 3 in the cusped arches, and by 4 in the  quatrefoils immediately above.    [Illustration 84: NUMERATION IN GROUPS EXPRESSED ARCHITECTURALLY]    [Illustration 85: ARCHITECTURAL ORNAMENT CONSIDERED AS THE  OBJECTIFICATION OF NUMBER. MULTIPLICATION IN GROUPS OF FIVE; TWO;  THREE; ALTERNATION OF THREE AND SEVEN]    [Illustration 86]    Seven is proverbially the perfect number. It is of a quantity  sufficiently complex to stimulate the eye to resolve it, and yet so  simple that it can be analyzed at a glance; as a center with two equal  sides, it is possessed of symmetry, and as the sum of an odd and even  number (3 and 4) it has vitality and variety. All these properties a  work of architecture can variously reveal (Illustration 77). Fifteen,  also, is a number of great perfection. It is possible to arrange the  first 9 numbers in the form of a \"magic\" square so that the sum of  each line, read vertically, horizontally or diagonally, will be 15.  Thus:         4    9    2   =  15       3    5    7   =  15       8    1    6   =  15      --   --   --      15   15   15    Its beauty is portrayed geometrically in the accompanying figure which  expresses it, being 15 triangles in three groups of 5 (Illustration  86). Few arrangements of openings in a facade better satisfy the eye  than three superimposed groups of five (Illustrations 76-80). May not  one source of this satisfaction dwell in the intrinsic beauty of the  number 15?    In conclusion, it is perhaps well that the reader be again reminded  that these are the by-ways, and not the highways of architecture: that  the highest beauty comes always, not from beautiful numbers, nor  from likenesses to Nature's eternal patterns of the world, but from  utility, fitness, economy, and the perfect adaptation of means to  ends. But along with this truth there goes another: that in every  excellent work of architecture, in addition to its obvious and  individual beauty, there dwells an esoteric and universal beauty,  following as it does the archetypal pattern laid down by the Great  Architect for the building of that temple which is the world wherein  we dwell.          VII    FROZEN MUSIC      In the series of essays of which this is the final one, the author has  undertaken to enforce the truth that evolution on any plane and on  any scale proceeds according to certain laws which are in reality only  ramifications of one ubiquitous and ever operative law; that this law  registers itself in the thing evolved, leaving stamped thereon as it  were fossil footprints by means of which it may be known. In the arts  the creative spirit of man is at its freest and finest, and nowhere  among the arts is it so free and so fine as in music. In music  accordingly the universal law of becoming finds instant, direct  and perfect self-expression; music voices the inner nature of the  _will-to-live_ in all its moods and moments; in it form, content,  means and end are perfectly fused. It is this fact which gives  validity to the before quoted saying that all of the arts \"aspire  toward the condition of music.\" All aspire to express the law, but  music, being least encumbered by the leaden burden of materiality,  expresses it most easily and adequately. This being so there is  nothing unreasonable in attempting to apply the known facts of musical  harmony and rhythm to any other art, and since these essays concern  themselves primarily with architecture, the final aspect in which  that art will be presented here is as \"frozen music\"--ponderable form  governed by musical law.    Music depends primarily upon the equal and regular division of time  into beats, and of these beats into measures. Over this soundless and  invisible warp is woven an infinitely various melodic pattern, made  up of tones of different pitch and duration arithmetically related  and combined according to the laws of harmony. Architecture,  correspondingly, implies the rhythmical division of space, and  obedience to laws numerical and geometrical. A certain identity  therefore exists between simple harmony in music, and simple  proportion in architecture. By translating the consonant  tone-intervals into number, the common denominator, as it were, of  both arts, it is possible to give these intervals a spatial, and  hence an architectural, expression. Such expression, considered as  proportion only and divorced from ornament, will prove pleasing to  the eye in the same way that its correlative is pleasing to the ear,  because in either case it is not alone the special organ of sense  which is gratified, but the inner Self, in which all senses are one.  Containing within itself the mystery of number, it thrills responsive  to every audible or visible presentment of that mystery.    [Illustration 87]    If a vibrating string yielding a certain musical note be stopped in  its center, that is, divided by half, it will then sound the octave  of that note. The numerical ratio which expresses the interval of  the octave is therefore 1:2. If one-third instead of one-half of the  string be stopped, and the remaining two-thirds struck, it will yield  the musical fifth of the original note, which thus corresponds to the  ratio 2:3. The length represented by 3:4 yields the fourth; 4:5 the  major third; and 5:6 the minor third. These comprise the principal  consonant intervals within the range of one octave. The ratios of  inverted intervals, so called, are found by doubling the smaller  number of the original interval as given above: 2:3, the fifth, gives  3:4, the fourth; 4:5, the major third, gives 5:8, the minor sixth;  5:6, the minor third, gives 6:10, or 3:5, the major sixth.    [Illustration 88: ARCHITECTURE AS HARMONY]    Of these various consonant intervals the octave, fifth, and major  third are the most important, in the sense of being the most perfect,  and they are expressed by numbers of the smallest quantity, an odd  number and an even. It will be noted that all the intervals above  given are expressed by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, except the  minor sixth (5:8), and this is the most imperfect of all consonant  intervals. The sub-minor seventh, expressed by the ratio 4:7 though  included among the dissonances, forms, according to Helmholtz, a more  perfect consonance with the tonic than does the minor sixth.    A natural deduction from these facts is that relations of  architectural length and breadth, height and width, to be \"musical\"  should be capable of being expressed by ratios of quantitively small  numbers, preferably an odd number and an even. Although generally  speaking the simpler the numerical ratio the more perfect the  consonance, yet the intervals of the fifth and major third (2:3 and  4:5), are considered to be more pleasing than the octave (1:2), which  is too obviously a repetition of the original note. From this it is  reasonable to assume (and the assumption is borne out by experience),  that proportions, the numerical ratios of which the eye resolves too  readily, become at last wearisome. The relation should be felt rather  than fathomed. There should be a perception of identity, and also  of difference. As in music, where dissonances are introduced to give  value to consonances which follow them, so in architecture simple  ratios should be employed in connection with those more complex.    [Illustration 89]    Harmonics are those tones which sound with, and reinforce any musical  note when it is sounded. The distinguishable harmonics of the tonic  yield the ratios 1:2, 2:3, 3:4, 4:5, and 4:7. A note and its harmonics  form a natural chord. They may be compared to the widening circles  which appear in still water when a stone is dropped into it, for when  a musical sound disturbs the quietude of that pool of silence which  we call the air, it ripples into overtones, which becoming fainter  and fainter, die away into silence. It would seem reasonable to assume  that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#13)"],[1,"on  the stage; she preferred to chatter and laugh with the Lord Chamberlain.  But, as the play went on, her mood changed; her attention was fixed, and  then she laughed no more. Yet she was puzzled; it seemed a strange, a  horrible business. What did Lord M. think? Lord M. thought it was a  very fine play, but to be sure, \"a rough, coarse play, written for  those times, with exaggerated characters.\" \"I'm glad you've seen it,\" he  added. But, undoubtedly, the evenings which she enjoyed most were those  on which there was dancing. She was always ready enough to seize  any excuse--the arrival of cousins--a birthday--a gathering of young  people--to give the command for that. Then, when the band played, and  the figures of the dancers swayed to the music, and she felt her own  figure swaying too, with youthful spirits so close on every side--then  her happiness reached its height, her eyes sparkled, she must go on and  on into the small hours of the morning. For a moment Lord M. himself was  forgotten.    V    The months flew past. The summer was over: \"the pleasantest summer I  EVER passed in MY LIFE, and I shall never forget this first summer of  my reign.\" With surprising rapidity, another summer was upon her. The  coronation came and went--a curious dream. The antique, intricate,  endless ceremonial worked itself out as best it could, like some machine  of gigantic complexity which was a little out of order. The small  central figure went through her gyrations. She sat; she walked; she  prayed; she carried about an orb that was almost too heavy to hold; the  Archbishop of Canterbury came and crushed a ring upon the wrong finger,  so that she was ready to cry out with the pain; old Lord Rolle tripped  up in his mantle and fell down the steps as he was doing homage; she  was taken into a side chapel, where the altar was covered with a  table-cloth, sandwiches, and bottles of wine; she perceived Lehzen in an  upper box and exchanged a smile with her as she sat, robed and crowned,  on the Confessor's throne. \"I shall ever remember this day as the  PROUDEST of my life,\" she noted. But the pride was soon merged once more  in youth and simplicity. When she returned to Buckingham Palace at  last she was not tired; she ran up to her private rooms, doffed her  splendours, and gave her dog Dash its evening bath.    Life flowed on again with its accustomed smoothness--though, of course,  the smoothness was occasionally disturbed. For one thing, there was the  distressing behaviour of Uncle Leopold. The King of the Belgians had  not been able to resist attempting to make use of his family position  to further his diplomatic ends. But, indeed, why should there be any  question of resisting? Was not such a course of conduct, far from being  a temptation, simply \"selon les regles?\" What were royal marriages  for, if they did not enable sovereigns, in spite of the hindrances of  constitutions, to control foreign politics? For the highest purposes,  of course; that was understood. The Queen of England was his niece--more  than that--almost his daughter; his confidential agent was living, in  a position of intimate favour, at her court. Surely, in such  circumstances, it would be preposterous, it would be positively  incorrect, to lose the opportunity of bending to his wishes by means  of personal influence, behind the backs of the English Ministers, the  foreign policy of England.    He set about the task with becoming precautions. He continued in his  letters his admirable advice. Within a few days of her accession, he  recommended the young Queen to lay emphasis, on every possible occasion,  upon her English birth; to praise the English nation; \"the Established  Church I also recommend strongly; you cannot, without PLEDGING yourself  to anything PARTICULAR, SAY TOO MUCH ON THE SUBJECT.\" And then \"before  you decide on anything important I should be glad if you would consult  me; this would also have the advantage of giving you time;\" nothing was  more injurious than to be hurried into wrong decisions unawares. His  niece replied at once with all the accustomed warmth of her affection;  but she wrote hurriedly--and, perhaps, a trifle vaguely too. \"YOUR  advice is always of the GREATEST IMPORTANCE to me,\" she said.    Had he, possibly, gone too far? He could not be certain; perhaps  Victoria HAD been hurried. In any case, he would be careful; he would  draw back--\"pour mieux sauter\" he added to himself with a smile. In his  next letters he made no reference to his suggestion of consultations  with himself; he merely pointed out the wisdom, in general, of refusing  to decide upon important questions off-hand. So far, his advice was  taken; and it was noticed that the Queen, when applications were made to  her, rarely gave an immediate answer. Even with Lord Melbourne, it was  the same; when he asked for her opinion upon any subject, she would  reply that she would think it over, and tell him her conclusions next  day.    King Leopold's counsels continued. The Princess de Lieven, he said,  was a dangerous woman; there was reason to think that she would make  attempts to pry into what did not concern her, let Victoria beware. \"A  rule which I cannot sufficiently recommend is NEVER TO PERMIT people  to speak on subjects concerning yourself or your affairs, without you  having yourself desired them to do so.\" Should such a thing occur,  \"change the conversation, and make the individual feel that he has made  a mistake.\" This piece of advice was also taken; for it fell out as the  King had predicted. Madame de Lieven sought an audience, and appeared  to be verging towards confidential topics; whereupon the Queen, becoming  slightly embarrassed, talked of nothing but commonplaces. The individual  felt that she had made a mistake.    The King's next warning was remarkable. Letters, he pointed out, are  almost invariably read in the post. This was inconvenient, no doubt; but  the fact, once properly grasped, was not without its advantages. \"I will  give you an example: we are still plagued by Prussia concerning those  fortresses; now to tell the Prussian Government many things, which we  SHOULD NOT LIKE to tell them officially, the Minister is going to write  a despatch to our man at Berlin, sending it BY POST; the Prussians ARE  SURE to read it, and to learn in this way what we wish them to hear.  Analogous circumstances might very probably occur in England. I tell you  the TRICK,\" wrote His Majesty, \"that you should be able to guard against  it.\" Such were the subtleties of constitutional sovereignty.    It seemed that the time had come for another step. The King's next  letter was full of foreign politics--the situation in Spain and  Portugal, the character of Louis Philippe; and he received a favourable  answer. Victoria, it is true, began by saying that she had shown the  POLITICAL PART of his letter to Lord Melbourne; but she proceeded to a  discussion of foreign affairs. It appeared that she was not unwilling  to exchange observations on such matters with her uncle. So far so good.  But King Leopold was still cautious; though a crisis was impending  in his diplomacy, he still hung back; at last, however, he could keep  silence no longer. It was of the utmost importance to him that, in his  manoeuvrings with France and Holland, he should have, or at any rate  appear to have, English support. But the English Government appeared to  adopt a neutral attitude; it was too bad; not to be for him was to  be against him, could they not see that? Yet, perhaps, they were only  wavering, and a little pressure upon them from Victoria might still  save all. He determined to put the case before her, delicately yet  forcibly--just as he saw it himself. \"All I want from your kind  Majesty,\" he wrote, \"is, that you will OCCASIONALLY express to your  Ministers, and particularly to good Lord Melbourne, that, as far as it  is COMPATIBLE with the interests of your own dominions, you do NOT wish  that your Government should take the lead in such measures as might in a  short time bring on the DESTRUCTION of this country, as well as that of  your uncle and his family.\" The result of this appeal was unexpected;  there was dead silence for more than a week. When Victoria at last  wrote, she was prodigal of her affection. \"It would, indeed, my dearest  Uncle, be VERY WRONG of you, if you thought my feelings of warm and  devoted attachment to you, and of great affection for you, could be  changed--nothing can ever change them\"--but her references to foreign  politics, though they were lengthy and elaborate, were non-committal in  the extreme; they were almost cast in an official and diplomatic form.  Her Ministers, she said, entirely shared her views upon the subject; she  understood and sympathised with the difficulties of her beloved uncle's  position; and he might rest assured \"that both Lord Melbourne and Lord  Palmerston are most anxious at all times for the prosperity and welfare  of Belgium.\" That was all. The King in his reply declared himself  delighted, and re-echoed the affectionate protestations of his niece.  \"My dearest and most beloved Victoria,\" he said, \"you have written me  a VERY DEAR and long letter, which has given me GREAT PLEASURE AND  SATISFACTION.\" He would not admit that he had had a rebuff.    A few months later the crisis came. King Leopold determined to make a  bold push, and to carry Victoria with him, this time, by a display of  royal vigour and avuncular authority. In an abrupt, an almost peremptory  letter, he laid his case, once more, before his niece. \"You know from  experience,\" he wrote, \"that I NEVER ASK ANYTHING OF YOU... But, as I  said before, if we are not careful we may see serious consequences which  may affect more or less everybody, and THIS ought to be the object  of our most anxious attention. I remain, my dear Victoria, your  affectionate uncle, Leopold R.\" The Queen immediately despatched this"]]]
