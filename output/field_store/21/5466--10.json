A.W., aged 50, a writer and lecturer, physically and mentally      energetic and enjoying good health. He is, however, very      emotional and of nervous temperament, but self-controlled. Though      physically well developed, the sexual organs are small. He is      married to an attractive woman, to whom he is much attached, and      has two healthy children.        At 10 or 12 years of age he had a frequent desire to be whipped,      his parents never having struck him, and on one occasion he asked      a brother to go with him to the closet to get him to whip him on      the posterior; but on arrival he was too shy to make the request.      He did not recognize the cause of these desires, knowing nothing      of such things except from the misinformation of his      school-fellows' talk. As far as he can remember, he was an      entirely normal, healthy boy up to the age of about 15, when his      attention was arrested by an advertisement of a quack medicine      for the results of \"youthful excesses.\"        Being a city boy, he was unfamiliar with the coupling even of      animals, had never had a conscious erection and did not know of      frictional excitement. Experiment, however, resulted in an      orgasm, and, though believing that it was wicked or at least weak      and degrading, he indulged in masturbation at intervals, usually      about six times a month, and has continued even up to the      present.        He had an abnormally small opening in the prepuce, making the      uncovering of the glans almost impossible. (At the age of about      37, he himself slit the prepuce by three or four cuts of a      scissors at intervals of about ten days. This was followed by a      marked decrease in desire, especially as he shortly afterwards      learned the importance of local cleanliness.) While in college at      about the age of 19 he began to have nocturnal emissions      occasionally and once or twice a week when at stool. Alarmed by      these, he consulted a physician, who warned him of the danger,      gave him bromide and prescribed cold bathing of the parts, with a      hard, cool bed. These stopped the emissions.        He never had connection with women until the age of about 25, and      then only three times until his marriage at 30 years of age,      being deterred partly by conscientious scruples, but more by      shyness and convention, and deriving very little pleasure from      these instances. Even since marriage he has derived more pleasure      from sexual excitement than from coitus, and can maintain      erection for as long as two hours.        He has always been accustomed to torture himself in various      ingenious ways, nearly always connected with sex. He would burn      his skin deeply with red hot wire in inconspicuous places. These      and similar acts were generally followed by manual excitation      nearly always brought to a climax.        He considers that he is attracted to refined and intellectual      women. But he is without very ardent desires, having several      times gone to bed with attractive women who stripped themselves      naked, but without attempting any sexual intercourse with them.      He became interested in the \"Karezza\" theory and has tried to      practice it with his wife, but could never entirely control the      emission.        He has hired a masseur to whip him, as children are whipped, with      a heavy dog whip, which caused pleasurable excitement. During      this time he had relations with his wife generally about once a      week without any great ecstasy. She was cold and sexually slow,      owing to conventional sex repression and to an idea that the      whole thing was \"like animals\" and to fear of child-bearing,      usually necessitating the use of a cover or withdrawal. It was      only eight years after their marriage that she desired and      obtained a child. During these years he would often stick pins      through his mammae and tie them together by a string round the      pins drawn so short as to cause great pain and then indulge      himself in the sexual act. He used strong wooden clips with a      tack fixed in them, so as to pierce and pinch the mammae, and once      he drove a pin entirely through the penis itself, then obtaining      orgasm by friction. He was never able to get an automatic      emission in this way, though he often tried, not even by walking      briskly during an erection.    In another class of cases a purely ideal symbolism may be present by means  of a fetich which acts as a powerful stimulus without itself being felt to  possess any attraction. A good illustration of this condition is furnished  by a case which has been communicated to me by a medical correspondent in  New Zealand.        \"The patient went out to South Africa as a trooper with the      contingent from New Zealand, throwing up a good position in an      office to do so. He had never had any trouble as regards      connection with women before going out to South Africa. While in      active service at the front he sustained a nasty fall from his      horse, breaking his leg. He was unconscious for four days, and      was then invalided down to Cape Town. Here he rapidly got well,      and his accustomed health returning to him he started having what      he terms 'a good time.' He repeatedly went to brothels, but was      unable to have more than a temporary erection, and no ejaculation      would take place. In one of these places he was in company with a      drunken trooper, who suggested that they should perform the      sexual act with their boots and spurs (only) on. My patient, who      was also drunk, readily assented, and to his surprise was enabled      to perform the act of copulation without any difficulty at all.      He has repeatedly tried since to perform the act without any      spurs, but is quite unable to do so; with the spurs he has no      difficulty at all in obtaining all the gratification he desires.      His general health is good. His mother was an extremely nervous      woman, and so is his sister. His father died when he was quite      young. His only other relation in the colony is a married sister,      who seems to enjoy vigorous health.\"    The consideration of the cases here brought forward may suffice to show  that beyond those fetichisms which find their satisfaction in the  contemplation of a part of the body or a garment, there is a more subtle  symbolism. The foot is a center of force, an agent for exerting pressure,  and thus it furnishes a point of departure not alone for the merely static  sexual fetich, but for a dynamic erotic symbolization. The energy of its  movements becomes a substitute for the energy of the sexual organs  themselves in coitus, and exerts the same kind of fascination. The young  girl (page 35) \"who seemed to have a passion for treading upon things  which would scrunch or yield under her foot,\" already possessed the germs  of an erotic symbolism which, under the influence of circumstances in  which she herself took an active part, developed into an adequate method  of sexual gratification.[23] The youth who was her partner learned, in the  same way, to find an erotic symbolism in all the pressure reactions of  attractive feminine feet, the swaying of a carriage beneath their weight,  the crushing of the flowers on which they tread, the slow rising of the  grass which they have pressed. Here we have a symbolism which is  altogether different from that fetichism which adores a definite object;  it is a dynamic symbolism finding its gratification in the spectacle of  movements which ideally recall the fundamental rhythm and pressure  reactions of the sexual process.    We may trace a very similar erotic symbolism in an absolutely normal form.  The fascination of clothes in the lover's eyes is no doubt a complex  phenomenon, but in part it rests on the aptitudes of a woman's garments to  express vaguely a dynamic symbolism which must always remain indefinite  and elusive, and on that account always possess fascination. No one has so  acutely described this symbolism as Herrick, often an admirable  psychologist in matters of sexual attractiveness. Especially instructive  in this respect are his poems, \"Delight in Disorder,\" \"Upon Julia's  Clothes,\" and notably \"Julia's Petticoat.\" \"A sweet disorder in the  dress,\" he tells us, \"kindles in clothes a wantonness;\" it is not on the  garment itself, but on the character of its movement that he insists; on  the \"erring lace,\" the \"winning wave\" of the \"tempestuous petticoat;\" he  speaks of the \"liquefaction\" of clothes, their \"brave vibration each way  free,\" and of Julia's petticoat he remarks with a more specific symbolism  still,        \"Sometimes 'twould pant and sigh and heave,       As if to stir it scarce had leave;       But having got it, thereupon,       'Twould make a brave expansion.\"    In the play of the beloved woman's garment, he sees the whole process of  the central act of sex, with its repressions and expansions, and at the  sight is himself ready to \"fall into a swoon.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [13] G. Stanley Hall, _Adolescence_, vol. ii, p. 113. It will be noted  that the hand does not appear among the parts of the body which are  normally of supreme interest. An interest in the hand is by no means  uncommon (it may be noted, for instance, in the course of History XII in  Appendix B to vol. iii of these _Studies_), but the hand does not possess  the mystery which envelops the foot, and hand-fetichism is very much less  frequent than foot-fetichism, while glove-fetichism is remarkably rare. An  interesting case of hand-fetichism, scarcely reaching morbid intensity, is  recorded by Binet, _Etudes de Psychologie Experimentale_, pp. 13-19; and  see Krafft-Ebing, _Op. cit._, pp. 214"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13615"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 6 (#13)"],[1,"or of bad heredity are not seldom sexually      precocious, but, on the other hand, Moll has known children of      eight or nine with strongly developed sexual impulses, who yet      become finely developed men.        Rudimentary sexual activities in childhood, accompanied by sexual      feelings, must indeed--when they are not too pronounced or too      premature--be regarded as coming within the normal sphere, though      when they occur in children of bad heredity they are not without      serious risks. But in healthy children, after the age of seven or      eight, they tend to produce no evil results, and are strictly of      the nature of play. Play, both in animals and men, as Groos has      shown with marvelous wealth of illustration, is a beneficent      process of education; the young creature is thereby preparing      itself for the exercise of those functions which in later life it      must carry out more completely and more seriously. In his _Spiele      der Menschen_, Groos applies this idea to the sexual play of      children, and brings forward quotations from literature in      evidence. Keller, in his \"Romeo und Juliet auf dem Dorfe,\" has      given an admirably truthful picture of these childish      love-relationships. Emil Schultze-Malkowsky (_Geschlecht und      Gesellschaft_, Bd. ii, p. 370) reproduces some scenes from the      life of a little girl of seven clearly illustrating the exact      nature of the sexual manifestation at this age.        A kind of rudimentary sexual intercourse between children, as      Bloch has remarked (_Beitraege_, etc., Bd. ii, p. 254), occurs in      many parts of the world, and is recognized by their elders as      play. This is, for instance, the case among the Bawenda of the      Transvaal (_Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_, 1896, Heft 4, p. 364),      and among the Papuans of Kaiser-Wilhelms-Land, with the approval      of the parents, although much reticence is observed (id., 1889,      Heft 1, p. 16). Godard (_Egypte et Palestine_, 1867, p. 105)      noted the sexual play of the boys and girls in Cairo. In New      Mexico W.A. Hammond (_Sexual Impotence_, p. 107) has seen boys      and girls attempting a playful sexual conjunction with the      encouragement of men and women, and in New York he has seen boys      and girls of three and four doing the same in the presence of      their parents, with only a laughing rebuke. \"Playing at pa and      ma\" is indeed extremely common among children in genuine      innocence, and with a complete absence of viciousness; and is by      no means confined to children of low social class. Moll remarks      on its frequency (_Libido Sexualis_, Bd. i, p. 277), and the      committee of evangelical pastors, in their investigation of      German rural morality (_Die Geschlechtliche-sittliche      Verhaeltnisse_, Bd. i, p. 102) found that children who are not yet      of school age make attempts at coitus. The sexual play of      children is by no means confined to father and mother games;      frequently there are games of school with the climax in exposure      and smackings, and occasionally there are games of being doctors      and making examinations. Thus a young English woman says: \"Of      course, when we were at school [at the age of twelve and earlier]      we used to play with one another, several of us girls; we used to      go into a field and pretend we were doctors and had to examine      one another, and then we used to pull up one another's clothes      and feel each other.\"        These games do not necessarily involve the cooeperation of the      sexual impulse, and still less have they any element of love. But      emotions of love, scarcely if at all distinguishable from adult      sexual love, frequently appear at equally early ages. They are of      the nature of play, in so far as play is a preparation for the      activities of later life, though, unlike the games, they are not      felt as play. Ramdohr, more than a century ago (_Venus Urania_,      1798), referred to the frequent love of little boys for women.      More usually the love is felt towards individuals of the opposite      or the same sex who are not widely different in age, though      usually older. The most comprehensive study of the matter has      been made by Sanford Bell in America on a basis of as many as      2,300 cases (S. Bell, \"A Preliminary Study of the Emotion of Love      Between the Sexes,\" _American Journal Psychology_, July, 1902).      Bell finds that the presence of the emotion between three and      eight years of age is shown by such actions as hugging, kissing,      lifting each other, scuffling, sitting close to each other,      confessions to each other and to others, talking about each other      when apart, seeking each other and excluding the rest, grief at      separation, giving gifts, showing special courtesies to each      other, making sacrifices for each other, exhibiting jealousy. The      girls are, on the whole, more aggressive than the boys, and less      anxious to keep the matter secret. After the age of eight, the      girls increase in modesty and the boys become still more      secretive. The physical sensations are not usually located in the      sexual organs; erection of the penis and hyperaemia of the female      sexual parts Bell regards as marking undue precocity. But there      is diffused vascular and nervous tumescence and a state of      exaltation comparable, though not equal, to that experienced in      adolescent and adult age. On the whole, as Bell soundly      concludes, \"love between children of opposite sex bears much the      same relation to that between adults as the flower does to the      fruit, and has about as little of physical sexuality in it as an      apple-blossom has of the apple that develops from it.\" Moll also      (op. cit. p. 76) considers that kissing and other similar      superficial contacts, which he denominates the phenomena of      contrectation, constitute most frequently the first and sole      manifestation of the sexual impulse in childhood.        It is often stated that it is easier for children to preserve      their sexual innocence in the country than in the town, and that      only in cities is sexuality rampant and conspicuous. This is by      no means true, and in some respects it is the reverse of the      truth. Certainly, hard work, a natural and simple life, and a      lack of alert intelligence often combine to keep the rural lad      chaste in thought and act until the period of adolescence is      completed. Ammon, for instance, states, though without giving      definite evidence, that this is common among the Baden      conscripts. Certainly, also, all the multiple sensory excitements      of urban life tend to arouse the nervous and cerebral      excitability of the young at a comparatively early age in the      sexual as in other fields, and promote premature desires and      curiosities. But, on the other hand, urban life offers the young      no gratification for their desires and curiosities. The publicity      of a city, the universal surveillance, the studied decorum of a      population conscious that it is continually exposed to the gaze      of strangers, combine to spread a veil over the esoteric side of      life, which, even when at last it fails to conceal from the young      the urban stimuli of that life, effectually conceals, for the      most part, the gratifications of those stimuli. In the country,      however, these restraints do not exist in any corresponding      degree; animals render the elemental facts of sexual life clear      to all; there is less need or regard for decorum; speech is      plainer; supervision is impossible, and the amplest opportunities      for sexual intimacy are at hand. If the city may perhaps be said      to favor unchastity of thought in the young, the country may      certainly be said to favor unchastity of act.        The elaborate investigations of the Committee of Lutheran pastors      into sexual morality (_Die Geschlechtich-sittliche Verhaeltnisse      im Deutschen Reiche_), published a few years ago, demonstrate      amply the sexual freedom in rural Germany, and Moll, who is      decidedly of opinion that the country enjoys no relative freedom      from sexuality, states (op. cit., pp. 137-139, 239) that even the      circulation of obscene books and pictures among school-children      seems to be more frequent in small towns and the country than in      large cities. In Russia, where it might be thought that urban and      rural conditions offered less contrast than in many countries,      the same difference has been observed. \"I do not know,\" a Russian      correspondent writes, \"whether Zola in _La Terre_ correctly      describes the life of French villages. But the ways of a Russian      village, where I passed part of my childhood, fairly resemble      those described by Zola. In the life of the rural population into      which I was plunged everything was impregnated with erotism. One      was surrounded by animal lubricity in all its immodesty. Contrary      to the generally received opinion, I believe that a child may      preserve his sexual innocence more easily in a town than in the      country. There are, no doubt, many exceptions to this rule. But      the functions of the sexual life are generally more concealed in      the towns than in the fields. Modesty (whether or not of the      merely superficial and exterior kind) is more developed among      urban populations. In speaking of sexual things in the towns      people veil their thought more; even the lower class in towns      employ more restraint, more euphemisms, than peasants. Thus in      the towns a child may easily fail to comprehend when risky      subjects are talked of in his presence. It may be said that the      corruption of towns, though more concealed, is all the deeper.   "]]]
