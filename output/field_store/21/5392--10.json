The brilliant young student discovered here a stimulating  leader whose wit, finish, and elegance responded in full measure to  the hitherto unsatisfied cravings of his own nature. Although Heine  had become a very altered person at the time of writing his _Romantic  School_ (1836), this book throws a scintillating illumination upon  certain sides of Schlegel's temperament, and offers a vivid impression  of his living personality.    In these last decades of his life Schlegel turned, as had his younger  brother, to the inviting field of Sanskrit literature and philology,  and extracted large and important treasures which may still be  reckoned among mankind's valued resources. When all discount has been  made on the side of a lack of specific gravity in Wilhelm Schlegel's  character, it is only just to assert that throughout his long and  prolific life he wrought with incalculable effect upon the  civilization of modern Europe as a humanizer of the first importance.    Ludwig Tieck (1773-1853) is reckoned by many students of the Romantic  period to be the best and most lasting precipitate which the entire  movement has to show. For full sixty years a most prolific writer, and  occupied in the main with purely literary production, it is not  strange that he came to be regarded as the poetic mouthpiece of the  school.    His birth was in a middle-class family of Berlin. A full university  training at Halle, Goettingen and Erlangen was accorded him, during  which he cannot be said to have distinguished himself by any triumph  in the field of formal studies, but in the course of which he  assimilated at first hand the chief modern languages of culture,  without any professional guidance. At an early stage in his growth he  discovered and fed full upon Shakespeare. As a university student he  also fell in love with the homely lore of German folk-poetry. In 1794  he came back to Berlin, and turned to rather banal hack-writing for  the publisher Nicolai, chief of all exponents of rationalism.  Significant was his early rehabilitation of popular folk-tales and  chapbooks, as in _The Wonderful Love-Story of Beautiful Magelone and  Count Peter of Provence_ (1797). The stuff was that of one of the  prose chivalry-stories of the middle ages, full of marvels, seeking  the remote among strange hazards by land and sea. The tone of Tieck's  narrative is childlike and naive, with rainbow-glows of the bliss of  romantic love, glimpses of the poetry and symbolism of Catholic  tradition, and a somewhat sugary admixture of the spirit of the  _Minnelied_, with plenty of refined and delicate sensuousness. With  the postulate that song is the true language of life, the story is  sprinkled with lyrics at every turn. The whole adventure is into the  realm of dreams and vague sensations.    Tieck must have been liberally baptized with Spree-water, for the  instantaneous, corrosive Berlin wit was a large part of his endowment.  His cool irony associated him more closely to the Schlegels than to  Novalis, with his life-and-death consecrations. His absurd  play-within-a-play, _Puss in Boots_ (1797), is delicious in its  bizarre ragout of satirical extravaganzas, where the naive and the  ironic lie side by side, and where the pompous seriousness of certain  complacent standards is neatly excoriated.    Such publications as the two mentioned were hailed with rejoicing by  the Schlegels, who at once adopted Tieck as a natural ally. Even more  after their own hearts was the long novel, _Franz Sternbald's  Wanderings_ (1798), a vibrant confession, somewhat influenced by  _Wilhelm Meister_, of the Religion of Art (or the Art of Religion):  \"Devout worship is the highest and purest joy in Art, a joy of which  our natures are capable only in their purest and most exalted  hours.\"    [Illustration: #A WANDERER LOOKS INTO A LANDSCAPE# MORITZ VON SCHWIND]    Sternbald, a pupil of Albrecht Duerer, makes a roving journey to the  Low Countries, the Rhine, and Italy, in order to deepen his artistic  nature. The psychology of the novel is by no means always true to the  spirit of the sixteenth century; in fact a good part of the story  reflects aristocratic French chateau-life in the eighteenth century.  The intensities of romantic friendship give a sustained thrill, and  the style is rhythmic, though the action is continually interrupted by  episodes, lyrics, and discourses. In the unworldliness, the delicacy  of sensibility, and the somewhat vague outlines of the story one may  be reminded, at times, of _The Marble Faun_. Its defense of German  Art, as compared with that of the Italian Renaissance, is its chief  message.    This novel has been dwelt upon because of its direct influence upon  German painting and religion. A new verb, \"_sternbaldisieren_,\" was  coined to parody a new movement in German art toward the medieval,  religious spirit. It is this book which Heine had in mind when he  ridiculed Tieck's \"silly plunge into medieval naivete.\" Overbeck and  Cornelius in Rome, with their pre-Raphaelite, old-German and  catholicizing tendencies, became the leaders of a productive school.  Goethe scourged it for its \"mystic-religious\" aspirations, and  demanded a more vigorous, cheerful and progressive outlook for German  painting.    Having already formed a personal acquaintance with Friedrich Schlegel  in Berlin, Tieck moved to Jena in 1799, came into very close relations  with Fichte, the Schlegels, and Novalis, and continued to produce  works in the spirit of the group, notably the tragedy _Life and Death  of Saint Genoveva_ (1800). His most splendid literary feat at this  period, however, was the translation of _Don Quixote_ (1799-1801), a  triumph over just those subtle difficulties which are well-nigh  insurmountable, a rendering which went far beyond any mere literalness  of text, and reproduced the very tone and aura of its original.    In 1803 he published a graceful little volume of typical  _Minnelieder_, renewed from the middle high-German period. The note of  the book (in which Runge's copperplate outlines are perhaps as  significant as the poems) is spiritualized sex-love: the utterance of  its fragrance and delicacy, its unique place in the universe as a  pathway to the Divine--a point of view to which the modern mind is  prone to take some exceptions, considering a religion of erotics  hardly firm enough ground to support an entire philosophy of living.  All the motives of the old court-lyric are well represented--the  torments and rewards of love, the charm of spring, the refinements of  courtly breeding--and the sophisticated metrical forms are handled  with great virtuosity. Schiller, it is true, compared them to the  chatter of sparrows, and Goethe also paid his compliments to the  \"sing-song of the Minnesingers,\" but it was this same little book  which first gave young Jakob Grimm the wish to become acquainted with  these poets in their original form.    That eminently \"Romantic\" play, _Emperor Octavian_ (1804), derived  from a familiar medieval chap-book, lyric in tone and loose in form,  is a pure epitome of the movement, and the high-water mark of Tieck's  apostleship and service. Here Tieck shows his intimate sense of the  poetry of inanimate nature; ironic mockery surrenders completely to  religious devotion; the piece is bathed in--      The light that never was on sea or land,    The consecration and the poet's dream.    It is in the prologue to this play that personified Romance declares  her descent from Faith, her father, and Love, her mother, and  introduces the action by the command:      \"Moonshine-lighted magic night    Holding every sense in thrall;    World, which wondrous tales recall,    Rise, in ancient splendors bright!\"    During a year's residence in Italy Tieck applied himself chiefly to  reading old-German manuscripts, in the Library of the Vatican, and  wavered upon the edge of a decision to devote himself to Germanic  philology.    [Illustration: #A CHAPEL IN THE FOREST# MORITZ VON SCHWIND]    The loss to science is not serious, for Tieck hardly possessed the  grasp and security which could have made him a peer of the great  pioneers in this field. From the time of his leaving for Italy,  Tieck's importance for the development of Romanticism becomes  comparatively negligible.    After a roving existence of years, during which he lived in Vienna,  Munich, Prague and London, he made a settled home in Dresden. Here he  had an enviable place in the very considerable literary and artistic  group, and led an existence of almost suspiciously \"reasonable\"  well-being, from a Romantic view-point. The \"dramatic evenings\" at his  home, in which he read plays aloud before a brilliant gathering, were  a feature of social life. For seventeen years he had an influential  position as \"dramaturg\" of the Royal Theatre, it being his duty to  pass on plays to be performed and to decide upon suitable actors for  the parts.    During his long residence in Dresden Tieck produced a very large  number of short stories (_Novellen_) which had a decided vogue, though  they differ widely from his earlier writings in dealing with real,  contemporary life.    It is pleasant to record that the evening of Tieck's long life was  made secure from anxieties by a call to Berlin from Friedrich Wilhelm  IV., the \"Romantic king.\" His last eleven years were spent there in  quiet and peace, disturbed only by having to give dramatic readings  before a self-sufficient court circle which was imperfectly equipped  for appreciating the merits of Tieck's performances.    The early Romantic movement found its purest expression in the person  and writings of Friedrich von Hardenberg, better known under"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12083"],[0,"Eric; Or, Little (#13)"],[1,"on't call that swearing, do you? You're so strict, so  religious, you know. I love you for it, but then, there are none like  you. Nobody thinks anything of swearing here.\"    Russell was silent.    \"Besides, what can be the harm of it? it means nothing. I was thinking  the other night, and I concluded that you and Owen are the only two  fellows here who don't swear.\"    Russell still said nothing.    \"And, after all, I didn't swear; I only called that fellow a surly  devil.\"    \"O, hush! Eric, hush!\" said Russell sadly. \"You wouldn't have said so  half-a-year ago.\"    Eric knew what he meant. The image of his father and mother rose before  him, as they sate far away in their lonely Indian home, thinking of him,  praying for him, centring all their hopes in him. In him!--and he knew  how many things he was daily doing and saying, which would cut them to  the heart. He knew that all his moral consciousness was fast vanishing,  and leaving him a bad and reckless boy.    In a moment, all this passed through his mind. He remembered how shocked  he had been at swearing at first; and even when it became too familiar  to shock him, how he determined never to fall into the habit himself.  Then he remembered how gradually it had become quite a graceful sound in  his ears; a sound of entire freedom and independence of moral restraint;  an open casting off, as it were, of all authority, so that he had begun  to admire it, particularly in Duncan, and above all, in his new hero,  Upton; and he recollected how, at last, an oath had one day slipped out  suddenly in his own words, and how strange it sounded to him, and how  Upton smiled to hear it, though conscience had reproached him bitterly;  but now that he had done it once, it became less dreadful, and gradually  grew common enough, till even conscience hardly reminded him that he was  doing wrong.    He thought of all this, and hung his head. Pride struggled with him for  a moment, but at length he answered, \"O Edwin, I fear I am getting  utterly bad; I wish I were more like you,\" he added, in a low sad tone.    \"Dear Eric, I have no right to say it, full of faults as I am myself;  but you will be so much happier, if you try not to yield to all the bad  things round us. Remember, I know more of school than you.\"    The two boys strolled on silently. That night Eric knelt at his bedside,  and prayed as he had not done for many a long day.        CHAPTER IX    \"DEAD FLIES,\" OR \"YE SHALL BE AS GODS\"    \"In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night.\" PROV.  vii. 9.    At Roslyn, even in summer, the hour for going to bed was half-past nine.  It was hardly likely that so many boys, overflowing with turbulent life,  should lie down quietly, and get to sleep. They never dreamt of doing  so. Very soon after the masters were gone, the sconces were often  relighted, sometimes in separate dormitories, sometimes in all of them,  and the boys amused themselves by reading novels or making a row. They  would play various games about the bedrooms, vaulting or jumping over  the beds, running races in sheets, getting through the windows upon the  roofs, to frighten the study-boys with sham ghosts, or playing the  thousand other pranks which suggested themselves to the fertile  imagination of fifteen. But the favorite amusement was a bolstering  match. One room would challenge another, and, stripping the covers off  their bolsters, would meet in mortal fray. A bolster well wielded,  especially when dexterously applied to the legs, is a very efficient  instrument to bring a boy to the ground; but it doesn't hurt very much,  even when the blows fall on the head. Hence these matches were excellent  trials of strength and temper, and were generally accompanied with  shouts of laughter, never ending until one side was driven back to its  own room. Many a long and tough struggle had Eric enjoyed, and his  prowess was so universally acknowledged, that his dormitory, No. 7, was  a match for any other, and far stronger in this warfare than most of the  rest. At bolstering, Duncan was a perfect champion; his strength and  activity were marvellous, and his mirth uproarious. Eric and Graham  backed him up brilliantly; while Llewellyn and Attlay, with sturdy  vigor, supported the skirmishers. Bull, the sixth boy in No. 7, was the  only _faineant_ among them, though he did occasionally help to keep off  the smaller fry.    Happy would it have been for all of them if Bull had never been placed  in No. 7; happier still if he had never come to Roslyn school. Backward  in work, overflowing with vanity at his supposed good looks, of mean  disposition and feeble intellect, he was the very worst specimen of a  boy that Eric had ever seen. Not even Barker so deeply excited Eric's  repulsion and contempt. And yet, since the affair of Upton, Barker and  Eric were declared enemies, and, much to the satisfaction of the latter,  never spoke to each other; but with Bull--much as he inwardly loathed  him--he was professedly and apparently on good terms. His silly love of  universal popularity made him accept and tolerate the society even of  this worthless boy.    Any two boys talking to each other about Bull would probably profess to  like him \"well enough,\" but if they were honest, they would generally  end by allowing their contempt.    \"We've got a nice set in No. 7, haven't we?\" said Duncan to Eric one  day.    \"Capital. Old Llewellyn's a stunner, and I like Attlay and Graham.\"    \"Don't you like Bull then?\"    \"O yes; pretty well.\"    The two boys looked each other in the face, then, like the confidential  augurs, burst out laughing.    \"You know you detest him,\" said Duncan.    \"No, I don't. He never did me any harm that I know of.\"    \"Him!--well, _I_ detest him.\"    \"Well!\" answered Eric, \"on coming to think of it, so do I. And yet he is  popular enough in the school. I wonder how that is.\"    \"He's not _really_ popular. I've often noticed that fellows pretty  generally despise him, yet somehow don't like to say so.\"    \"Why do you dislike him, Duncan?\"    \"I don't know. Why do you?\"    \"I don't know either.\"    Neither Eric nor Duncan meant this answer to be false, and yet if they  had taken the trouble to consider, they would have found out in their  secret souls the reasons of their dislike.    Bull had been to school before, and of this school he often bragged as  the acme of desirability and wickedness. He was always telling boys what  they did at \"his old school,\" and he quite inflamed the minds of such as  fell under his influence by marvellous tales of the wild and wilful  things which he and his former school-fellows had done. Many and many a  scheme of sin and mischief, at Roslyn was suggested, planned, and  carried out on the model of Bull's reminiscences of his previous life.    He had tasted more largely of the tree of the knowledge of evil than any  other boy, and strange to say, this was the secret why the general odium  was never expressed. He claimed his guilty experience so often as a  ground of superiority, that at last the claim was silently allowed. He  spoke from the platform of more advanced iniquity, and the others  listened first curiously, then eagerly to his words.    \"Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\" Such was the temptation  which assailed the other boys in dormitory No. 7; and Eric among the  number. Bull was the tempter. Secretly, gradually, he dropped into their  too willing ears the poison of his polluting acquirements.    In brief, Bull was cursed with a degraded and corrupting mind.    I hurry over a part of my subject inconceivably painful; I hurry over  it, but if I am to perform my self-imposed duty of giving a true picture  of what school life _sometimes_ is, I must not pass it by altogether.    The first time that Eric heard indecent words in dormitory No. 7, he was  shocked beyond bound or measure. Dark though it was, he felt himself  blushing scarlet to the roots of his hair, and then growing pale again,  while a hot dew was left upon his forehead. Bull was the speaker; but  this time there was a silence, and the subject instantly dropped. The  others felt that \"a new boy\" was in the room; they did not know how he  would take it; they were unconsciously abashed.    Besides, though they had themselves joined in such conversation before,  they did not love it, and on the contrary, felt ashamed of yielding  to it.    Now, Eric, now or never! Life and death, ruin and salvation, corruption  and purity, are perhaps in the balance together, and the scale of your  destiny may hang on a single word of yours. Speak out, boy! Tell these  fellows that unseemly words wound your conscience; tell them that they  are ruinous, sinful, damnable; speak out and save yourself and the rest.  Virtue is strong and beautiful, Eric, and vice is downcast in her awful  presence. Lose your purity of heart, Eric, and you have lost a jewel  which the whole world, if it were \"one entire and perfect chrysolite,\"  cannot replace.    Good spirits guard that young boy, and give him grace in this his hour  of trial! Open his eyes that he may see the fiery horses and the fiery  chariots of the angels who would defend him, and the dark array of  spiritual foes who throng around his bed. Point a pitying finger to the  yawning abyss of shame, ruin, and despair that even now perhaps is being  cleft under his feet. Show him the garlands of the present and the past,  withering at the touch of the Erinnys in the future. In pity, in pity  show him the canker which he is introducing into the sap of the tree of  life, which shall cause its root to be hereafter as bitterness, and its  blossom to go up as dust.    But the sense of sin was on Eric's mind. How _could_ he speak? was not  his own language sometimes profane? How--how could he profess to reprove  another boy on the ground of morality, when he himself said did things  less ruinous perhaps, but equally forbidden?    For half an"]]]
