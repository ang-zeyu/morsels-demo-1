[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11352"],[0,"Germany and the Next War (#13)"],[1,"  Rome, the sacred seat of the world-empire, and standing at the head of a  Church which claimed universality, they, too, laid hold in their own way  of the idea of universal imperium. The notion was one of the boldest  creations of the human intellect--to found and maintain a  world-sovereignty almost wholly by the employment of spiritual powers.    Naturally these Papal pretensions led to feuds with the Empire. The  freedom of secular aspirations clashed with the claims of spiritual  dominion. In the portentous struggle of the two Powers for the  supremacy, a struggle which inflicted heavy losses on the German Empire,  the Imperial cause was worsted. It was unable to mould the widely  different and too independent subdivisions of the empire into a  homogeneous whole, and to crush the selfish particularism of the  estates. The last Staufer died on the scaffold at Naples under the axe  of Charles of Anjou, who was a vassal of the Church.    The great days of the German-Roman Empire were over. The German power  lay on the ground in fragments. A period of almost complete anarchy  followed. Dogmatism and lack of patriotic sentiment, those bad  characteristics of the German people, contributed to extend this  destruction to the economic sphere. The intellectual life of the German  people deteriorated equally. At the time when the Imperial power was  budding and under the rule of the highly-gifted Staufers, German poetry  was passing through a first classical period. Every German country was  ringing with song; the depth of German sentiment found universal  expression in ballads and poems, grave or gay, and German idealism  inspired the minnesingers. But with the disappearance of the Empire  every string was silent, and even the plastic arts could not rise above  the coarseness and confusion of the political conditions. The material  prosperity of the people indeed improved, as affairs at home were better  regulated, and developed to an amazing extent; the Hanseatic League bore  its flag far and wide over the northern seas, and the great  trade-routes, which linked the West and Orient, led from Venice and  Genoa through Germany. But the earlier political power was never again  attained.    Nevertheless dislike of spiritual despotism still smouldered in the  breasts of that German people, which had submitted to the Papacy, and  was destined, once more to blaze up into bright flames, and this time in  the spiritual domain. As she grew more and more worldly, the Church had  lost much of her influence on men's minds. On the other hand, a refining  movement had grown up in humanism, which, supported by the spirit of  antiquity, could not fail from its very nature to become antagonistic to  the Church. It found enthusiastic response in Germany, and was joined by  everyone whose thoughts and hopes were centred in freedom. Ulrich von  Hutten's battle-cry, \"I have dared the deed,\" rang loud through the  districts of Germany.    Humanism was thus in a sense the precursor of the Reformation, which  conceived in the innermost heart of the German people, shook Europe to  her foundations. Once more it was the German people which, as formerly  in the struggle between the Arian Goths and the Orthodox Church, shed  it's heart's blood in a religious war for spiritual liberty, and now for  national independence also. No struggle more pregnant with consequences  for the development of humanity had been fought out since the Persian  wars. In this cause the German people nearly disappeared, and lost all  political importance. Large sections of the Empire were abandoned to  foreign States. Germany became a desert. But this time the Church did  not remain victorious as she did against the Arian Goths and the  Staufers. It is true she was not laid prostrate; she still remained a  mighty force, and drew new strength from the struggle itself.  Politically the Catholic States, under Spanish leadership, won an  undisputed supremacy. But, on the other hand, the right to spiritual  freedom was established. This most important element of civilization was  retained for humanity in the reformed Churches, and has become ever  since the palladium of all progress, though even after the Peace of  Westphalia protracted struggles were required to assert religious  freedom.    The States of the Latin race on their side now put forward strong claims  to the universal imperium in order to suppress the German ideas of  freedom. Spain first, then France: the two soon quarrelled among  themselves about the predominance. At the same time, in Germanized  England a firs-class Protestant power was being developed, and the age  of discoveries, which coincided roughly with the end of the Reformation  and the Thirty Years' War, opened new and unsuspected paths to human  intellect and human energy. Political life also acquired a fresh  stimulus. Gradually a broad stream of immigrants poured into the  newly-discovered districts of America, the northern part of which fell  to the lot of the Germanic and the southern part to that of the Latin  race. Thus was laid the foundation of the great colonial empires, and  consequently, of world politics. Germany remained excluded from this  great movement, since she wasted her forces in ecclesiastical disputes  and religious wars. On the other hand, in combination with England, the  Low Countries and Austria, which latter had at the same time to repel  the inroad of Turks from the East, she successfully curbed the French  ambition for sovereignty in a long succession of wars. England by these  wars grew to be the first colonial and maritime power in the world.  Germany forfeited large tracts of territory, and lost still more in  political power. She broke up into numerous feeble separate States,  which were entirely void of any common sympathy with the German cause.  But this very disintegration lent her fresh strength. A centre of  Protestant power was established in the North--i.e., Prussia.    After centuries of struggle the Germans had succeeded in driving back the  Slavs, who poured in from the East, in wrestling large tracts from them,  and in completely Germanizing them. This struggle, like that with the  niggard soil, produced a sturdy race, conscious of its strength, which  extended its power to the coasts of the Baltic, and successfully planted  Germanic culture in the far North. The German nation was finally  victorious also against Swedes, who disputed the command of the Baltic.  In that war the Great Elector had laid the foundations of a strong  political power, which, under his successors, gradually grew into an  influential force in Germany. The headship of Protestant Germany  devolved more and more on this state, and a counterpoise to Catholic  Austria grew up. This latter State had developed out of Germany into an  independent great Power, resting its supremacy not only on a German  population, but also on Hungarians and Slavs. In the Seven Years' War  Prussia broke away from Catholic Austria and the Empire, and confronted  France and Russia as an independent Protestant State.    But yet another dark hour was in store for Germany, as she once more  slowly struggled upwards. In France the Monarchy has exhausted the  resources of the nation for its own selfish ends. The motto of the  monarchy, _L'etat c'est moi,_ carried to an extreme, provoked a  tremendous revulsion of ideas, which culminated in the stupendous  revolution of 1789, and everywhere in Europe, and more specially in  Germany, shattered and swept away the obsolete remnants of medievalism.  The German Empire as such disappeared; only fragmentary States survived,  among which Prussia alone showed any real power. France once again under  Napoleon was fired with the conception of the universal imperium, and  bore her victorious eagles to Italy, Egypt, Syria, Germany, and Spain,  and even to the inhospitable plains of Russia, which by a gradual  political absorption of the Slavonic East, and a slow expansion of power  in wars with Poland, Sweden, Turkey, and Prussia, had risen to an  important place among the European nations. Austria, which had become  more and more a congeries of different nationalities, fell before the  mighty Corsican. Prussia, which seemed to have lost all vigour in her  dream of peace, collapsed before his onslaught.    But the German spirit emerged with fresh strength from the deepest  humiliation. The purest and mightiest storm of fury against the yoke of  the oppressor that ever honoured an enslaved nation burst out in the  Protestant North. The wars of liberation, with their glowing enthusiasm,  won back the possibilities of political existence for Prussia and for  Germany, and paved the way for further world-wide historical  developments.    While the French people in savage revolt against spiritual and secular  despotism had broken their chains and proclaimed their _rights,_ another  quite different revolution was working in Prussia--the revolution of  _duty_. The assertion of the rights of the individual leads ultimately  to individual irresponsibility and to a repudiation of the State.  Immanuel Kant, the founder of critical philosophy, taught, in opposition  to this view, the gospel of moral duty, and Scharnhorst grasped the idea  of universal military service. By calling upon each individual to  sacrifice property and life for the good of the community, he gave the  clearest expression to the idea of the State, and created a sound basis  on which the claim to individual rights might rest at the same time  Stein laid the foundations of self-employed-government in Prussia.    While measures of the most far-reaching historical importance were thus  being adopted in the State on which the future fate of Germany was to  depend, and while revolution was being superseded by healthy progress, a  German Empire of the first rank, the Empire of intellect, grew up in the  domain of art and science, where German character and endeavour "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11365"],[0,"The Fern Lover's Companion (#13)"],[1,"ght,\" but soon smitten by the early  frosts they wither and disappear. The interrupted fern is rather common in  damp, rocky woods and pastures; Newfoundland to Minnesota, south to North  Carolina and Missouri. Although fond of moisture it is easily cultivated  and its graceful outlines make it worthy of a prominent place in the  fern garden. Var. _dubia_ has the pinnules of the sterile frond widely  separated, and the upper-middle ones much elongated. Southern Vermont.    [Illustration: Interrupted Fern with the Fertile Pinnules Spread Open]    (3) CINNAMON FERN. BRAKES    _Osmunda cinnamomea_    Fronds one to six feet long, pinnate. Pinnae lanceolate, pinnatifid with  oblong, obtuse divisions. Fertile pinnae on separate fronds, which are  contracted and covered with brown sporangia.    [Illustration: Cinnamon Fern. Leaf Gradations]    [Illustration: Cinnamon Fern. Gradations from Sterile to Fertile Fronds]    [Illustration: Cinnamon Fern, var. _frondosa_]    Each fertile frond springs up at first outside the sterile ones, but is  soon surrounded and overtopped by them and finds itself in the center of  a charming circle of green leaves curving gracefully outwards. In a short  time, however, it withers and hangs down or falls to the ground. The large,  conspicuous clusters of cinnamon ferns give picturesqueness to many a  moist, hillside pasture and swampy woodyard. In its crosier stage it is  wrapped in wool, which falls away as the fronds expand, but leaves, at the  base of each pinna, a tiny tuft, as if to mark its identity.    [Illustration: Cinnamon Fern, var. _incisa_ (Maine)]    Many people in the country call the cinnamon fern the \"buckhorn brake,\" and  eat with relish the tender part which they find deep within the crown at  the base of the unfolding fronds. This is known as the \"heart of Osmund.\"  The fern, itself, with its tall, recurving leaves makes a beautiful  ornament for the shady lawn, and like the interrupted fern is easy to  cultivate. The spores of all the _osmundas_ are green, and need to  germinate quickly or they lose their vitality. Common in low and swampy  grounds in eastern North America and South America and Japan. May. Some  think it was this species which was coupled with the serpent in the old  rhyme,      \"Break the first brake you see,    Kill the first snake you see,    And you will conquer every enemy.\"    [Illustration: Osmunda cinnamomea, var. _glandulosa_ (From Waters's  \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]    Var. _frondosa_ has its fronds partly sterile below and irregularly fertile  towards the summit.    Var. _incisa_ has the inner pinnules of some of the pinnae more or less  cut-toothed.    Var. _glandulosa_ has glandular hairs on the pinnae, rachis and even the  stipes of the sterile frond. This is known only on the coastal plain from  Rhode Island to Maryland.          III    CURLY GRASS FAMILY    SCHIZAEACEAE    CURLY GRASS. _Schizaea pusilla_      Small, slender ferns with linear or thready leaves, the sterile, one to  two inches high and tortuous or \"curled like corkscrews\"; fertile fronds  longer, three to five inches, and bearing at the top about five pairs of  minute, fruited pinnae. Sporangia large, ovoid, sessile in a double row  along the single vein of the narrow divisions of the fertile leaves, and  provided with a complete apical ring. (_Schizaea_, from a Greek root meaning  to split, alluding to the cleft leaves of foreign species.)    [Illustration: Curly Grass. _Schizaea pusilla_]    The curly grass is so minute that it is difficult to distinguish it when  growing amid its companion plants, the grasses, mosses, sundews, club  mosses, etc. The sterile leaves are evergreen. Pine barrens of New Jersey,  Grand Lake, Nova Scotia, and in New Brunswick. Several new stations for the  curly grass have recently been discovered in the southwest counties of Nova  Scotia by the Gray Herbarium expedition, mostly in bogs and hollows of  sandy peat or sphagnum.    [Illustration: Sporangia of Curly Grass]    CLIMBING FERN. HARTFORD FERN    _Lygodium palmatum_      \"And where upon the meadow's breast    The shadow of the thicket lies.\"    BRYANT.    Fronds slender, climbing or twining, three to five feet long. The lower  pinnae (frondlets) sterile, roundish, five to seven lobed, distant in pairs  with simple veins; the upper fertile, contracted, several times forked,  forming a terminal panicle; the ultimate segments crowded, and bearing  the sporangia, which are similar to those of curly grass, and fixed to a  veinlet by the inner side next the base, one or rarely two covered by each  indusium. (From the Greek meaning like a willow twig [pliant], alluding to  the flexible stipes.)    [Illustration: Climbing Fern. _Lygodium palmatum_]    Fifty years ago this beautiful fern was more common than at present. There  was a considerable colony in a low, alluvial meadow thicket at North  Hadley, Mass., not far from Mt. Toby, where we collected it freely in 1872.  Many used to decorate their homes with its handsome sprays, draping it  gracefully over mirrors and pictures. It was known locally as the Hartford  fern. Greedy spoilers ruthlessly robbed its colonies and it became scarce,  at least in the Mt. Toby region. In Connecticut a law was enacted in 1867  for its protection and with good results. But as Mr. C.A. Weatherby states  in the American Fern Journal (Vol. II, No. 4), the encroachments of tillage  (mainly of tobacco, which likes the same soil), are forcing it from its  cherished haunts, thus jeopardizing its survival. Doubtless an aggressive  agriculture is in part responsible for its scarcity in the more northern  locality. It is still found here and there in New England, New York and New  Jersey; also in Kentucky, Tennessee and Florida, but is nowhere common.  The fertile portion dies when the spores mature, but the sterile frondlets  remain green through the winter. A handsome species for the fernery in the  house or out of doors.          IV      ADDER'S TONGUE FAMILY    _OPHIOGLOSSACEAE_    Plants more or less fern-like consisting of a stem with a single leaf. In  _Ophioglossum_ the leaf or sterile segment is entire, the veins reticulated  and the sporangia in a simple spike. In _Botrychium_ the sterile segment is  more or less incised, the veins free, and the sori in a panicle or compound  or rarely simple spike. Sporangia naked, opening by a transverse slit.  Spores copious, sulphur-yellow.    ADDER'S TONGUE. _Ophioglossum vulgatum_    Rootstock erect, fleshy. Stem simple, two to ten inches high, bearing  one smooth, entire leaf about midway, and a terminal spike embracing the  sporangia, coherent in two ranks on its edges. (Generic name from the Greek  meaning the tongue of a snake, in allusion to the narrow spike of the  sporangia.)    In moist meadows or rarely on dry slopes. \"Overlooked rather than rare.\"  New England states and in general widely distributed. July. Often grows  in company with the ragged orchis. The ancient ointment known as \"adder's  speare ointment\" had the adder's tongue leaves as a chief ingredient, and  is said to be still used for wounds in English villages.      \"For them that are with newts or snakes or adders stung,    He seeketh out a herb that's called adder's tongue.\"    [Illustration: Adder's Tongue. _Ophioglossum vulgatum_]    Var. _minus_, smaller; fronds often in pairs. The sterile segment  yellowish-green, attached usually much below the middle of the plant. Sandy  ground, New Hampshire to New Jersey.    Var. _Engelmanni_. (Given specific rank in Gray.) Has the sterile segment  thicker and cuspidate, the stipe slender and the secondary veins forming  a fine network within the meshes of the principal ones. Virginia and  westward.    Var. _arenarium_. (From the Latin, _arena_, meaning sand, being found in  a sandy soil.) Probably a depauperate form of _Ophioglossum vulgatum_ and  about half as large. A colony of these ferns was discovered growing in poor  soil at Holly Beach, New Jersey.          KEY TO THE GRAPE FERNS    (_Botrychium_)    Plant large, fruiting in June, sterile part much divided:                                                    Rattlesnake Fern.  Plant smaller:      Fruiting in autumn, sterile part long-stalked, triangular.                                                    Common Grape Fern.      Fruiting in summer:          Plant fleshy, sterile part mostly with lunate segments.                                                             Moonwort.          Plant less fleshy, segments not lunate:              Sterile part short-stalked above the middle of the stem.                                                       Matricary Fern.              Sterile part stalked usually below middle of stem.                                                    Little Grape Fern.              Sterile part sessile near the top of the stem.                                              Lance-leaved Grape Fern.        GRAPE FERNS    _Botrychium_    Rootstock very short, erect with clustered fleshy roots; the base of the  sheathed stalk containing the bud for the next year's frond. Fertile frond  one to three pinnate, the contracted divisions bearing a double row of  sessile, naked, globular sporangia, opening transversely into two valves.  Sterile segment of the frond ternately or pinnately divided or compound.  Veins free. Spores copious, sulphur yellow. (The name in Greek means a  cluster of grapes, alluding to the grape-like clusters of the sporangia.)    (1) MOONWORT. _Botrychium Lunaria_    Very fleshy, three to ten inches high, sterile segment subsessile, borne  near the middle of the plant, oblong, simple pinnate with three to eight  pairs of lunate or fan-shaped divisions, obtusely crenate, the veins  repeatedly forking; fertile segment panicled, two to three pinnate.
