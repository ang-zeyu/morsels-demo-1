This quality and  the rapid setting, tenacity, and strength of brickwork in cement make it  a most valuable material to use in those buildings or parts of a  building where great steadiness and strength are wanted, and in sewage  and dock work, where there is water to contend with. A good many cements  made from natural stones used to be employed, such as Medina, Harwich,  Atkinson's, or Roman cement. The last named is the only one which is now  much employed, except locally. It has the quality of setting with  exceptional rapidity, and is on that account sometimes the best material  to employ; but for almost every purpose the artificial compound known as  Portland cement is preferable.    Portland cement is made largely near Rochester. Its materials are simple  and cheap. They may, without much departure from the truth, be said to  be Thames mud and chalk; but the process of manufacture requires care  and thoroughness. The article supplied, when of the best quality, has  great strength, and is quick setting, and is far better than what was  manufactured from stones in which the ingredients existed in a state of  nature. In England we slake our lime and make use of it while it is  fresh; but it may interest you to know that the custom in Italy and  parts of France is different. There it is customary to slake the lime  long before it is wanted, and to deposit it in a pit and cover it up  with earth. In this condition it is left for months--I believe in Italy  for a year--and when taken out it is stiff, but still a pasty substance.  It is beaten, and more water added, and it is then made into mortar with  sand. It is claimed for mortar made in this way that is exceptionally  strong.    Now that we have considered bricks and partly considered mortar, it  remains to pay some attention to brickwork. The simplest and most  familiar work for a bricklayer to do is to build a wall. In doing this  his object should be to make it as stout as possible for the thickness,  and this stoutness can only be obtained by interlacing the bricks. If  they were simply laid on the top of each other, the wall would be no  more than a row of disconnected piles of bricks liable to tumble down.  When the whole is so adjusted that throughout the entire wall the joints  in one course shall rest on solid bricks and shall be covered by solid  bricks again--in short, when the whole shall break joint--then this wall  is said to be properly bonded, and has as much stability given to it as  it can possibly possess. There are two systems of bonding in use in  London, know as English bond and Flemish bond. English bond is the  method which we find followed in ancient brickwork in this country.    In this system a course of bricks is laid across the wall, showing their  heads at the surface, hence called \"headers,\" and next above comes a  course of bricks stretching lengthways at the wall, called stretchers,  and so on alternately. With the Dutch fashions came in Flemish bond, in  which, in each course, a header and a stretcher alternate. In either  case, at the corners, a quarter-brick called a closer has to be used in  each alternate course to complete the breaking joint. There is not much  to choose between these methods where the walls are only one brick  thick. But where they are thicker the English has a decided advantage,  for in walls built in Flemish bond of one and a half brick thickness or  more there must be a few broken bricks, or bats, and there is a strong  temptation to make use of many. If this takes place, the wall is  unsound.    Many of the failures of brickwork in London houses arise from the  external walls, where they are 11/2 bricks thick, being virtually in two  skins; the inner 9 in. does the whole of the work of supporting floors  and roof, and when it begins to fail, the outer face bulges off like a  large blister. I have known cases where this had occurred, and where  there was no header brick for yards, so that one could pass a 5 ft. rod  into the space between the two skins and turn it about. This is rather  less easy to accomplish with English bond, and there are other  advantages in the use of that bond which make it decidedly preferable,  and it is now coming back into very general use. There are some odd  varieties of bond, such as garden bond and chimney bond. But of these I  only wish to draw your attention to what is called cross bond. The name  is not quite a happy one. Diagonal bond is hardly better. The thing  itself is to be often met with on the Continent, and it is almost  unknown here. But it would be worth introducing, as the effect of it is  very good.    French cross bond, otherwise diagonal bond _(liaison en croix)_, is  English bond, but with the peculiarity that in every fourth course one  header is made use of in the stretcher course at the quoin. The result  is that the stretchers break joint with each other, and all the joints  range themselves in diagonal lines, and if in any part of the work  headers of a different brick are introduced, the appearance of a cross  is at once brought out; and even without this the diagonal arrangement  of joints is very perceptible and pleasing.    Besides wall building, the bricklayer has many other works to perform.  He has to form fireplaces, flues, chimneys, and the flat trimmer arches  which support the hearth, and has to set the stove, kitchen range,  copper, etc., in a proper manner. He has to form various ornamental  features and much else, some of which we shall have an opportunity of  noticing rather later. The strangest business, however, which is  intrusted to the bricklayer is building downward--by the method known as  underpinning--so that if a foundation has failed, a sounder one at a  greater depth may be reached; or if a basement is required under an  existing building which has none, the space may be excavated and the new  walls built so as to maintain the old.    This work has to be done with great caution, and bit by bit, and is  usually left to experienced hands. The mode in which the mortar joints  of a brick wall are finished where they show on the external or internal  face is a matter worth a moment's attention. It is important that the  joints of the work shall be so finished as to keep out wet and to be as  durable as possible, and it is desirable that they should improve, or at  any rate not disfigure, the appearance of the work.    The method which architects strongly advocate is that the joints shall  be struck as the work proceeds--that is, that very shortly after a brick  is laid, and while the mortar is yet soft, the bricklayer shall draw his  trowel, or a tool made for the purpose, across it, to give it a smooth  and a sloping surface. This is best when the joint is what is called a  weather joint--i.e., one in which the joint slopes outward. Sloping it  inward is not good, as it lets in wet; finishing it with a hollow on the  face is often practiced, and is not bad. Bricklayers, however, most of  them prefer that the mortar joints should be raked out and pointed--that  is to say, an inch or an inch and a half of the mortar next the outer  face be scratched out and replaced with fresh mortar, and finished to a  line.    In cases where the brickwork is exposed to frost, this proceeding cannot  be avoided, because the frost damages the external mortar of the joints.  But the bricklayers prefer it at all seasons of the year, partly because  brickwork is more quickly done if joints are not struck at the time;  partly because they can, if they like, wash the whole surface of the  work with ocher, or other color, to improve the tint; and partly  because, whether the washing is done or not, it smartens up the  appearance of the work. The misfortune is that this pointing, instead of  being the edge of the same mortar that goes right through, is only the  edge of a narrow strip, and does not hold on to the old undisturbed  mortar, and so is far less sound, and far more liable to decay. There is  a system of improving the appearance of old, decayed work by raking out  and filling up the joint, and then making a narrow mortar joint in the  middle of this filling in, and projecting from the face. This is called  tuck pointing. It is very specious, but it is not sound work.    Brick arches are constantly being turned, and of many sorts. An arch  consists of a series of wedge shaped blocks, known as voussoirs,  arranged in a curve, and so locking one another together that unless the  abutments from which the arch springs give way, it will not only carry  itself, but sustain a heavy load. It is a constant practice to cut  bricks to this shape and build them into an arch, and these are  sometimes cut and rubbed; sometimes, when the work is rougher, they are  axed. But in order to save the labor of cutting, arches are sometimes  turned with the bricks left square, and the joints wedge shaped. In this  case the rings should be only half a brick each, so that the wedge need  not be so very much wider at back than at face, and they are set in  cement, as that material adheres so closely and sets so hard. Arches of  two or more half-brick rings in cement are good construction, and are  also used for culvert work.    A less satisfactory sort of arch is what is called the flat arch. Here,  instead of being cambered as it ought to be, the soffit is straight; but  the brickwork being deep, there is room enough for a true arch that does  the work, and for useless material to hang from it. These arches are  generally rubbed or axed, and are very common at the openings of  ordinary windows. But no one who has studied construction can look at  them without a kind of wish for at least a slight rise, were it only two  inches. Sometimes when these straight arches are to be plastered over  they are constructed in a very clumsy manner, which is anything but  sound, and from time to time they give way."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1152"],[0,"The Story of the Volsungs (Volsunga Saga); with Excerpts from the Poetic Edda (#13)"],[1,"to the stock thereof, and  neither burst the sword nor brake it. Then he praised the sword much,  and thereafter went to the river with a lock of wool, and threw it up  against the stream, and it fell asunder when it met the sword. Then was  Sigurd glad, and went home.    But Regin said, \"Now whereas I have made the sword for thee, belike thou  wilt hold to thy troth given, and wilt go meet Fafnir?\"    \"Surely will I hold thereto,\" said Sigurd, \"yet first must I avenge my  father.\"    Now Sigurd the older he grew, the more he grew in the love of all men,  so that every child loved him well.        CHAPTER XVI. The prophecy of Grifir.    There was a man hight Grifir,(1) who was Sigurd's mother's brother, and  a little after the forging of the sword Sigurd went to Grifir, because  he was a man who knew things to come, and what was fated to men: of him  Sigurd asked diligently how his life should go; but Grifir was long  or he spake, yet at the last, by reason of Sigurd's exceeding great  prayers, he told him all his life and the fate thereof, even as  afterwards came to pass. So when Grifir had told him all even as he  would, he went back home; and a little after he and Regin met.    Then said Regin, \"Go thou and slay Fafnir, even as thou hast given thy  word.\"    Sigurd said, \"That work shall be wrought; but another is first to be  done, the avenging of Sigmund the king and the other of my kinsmen who  fell in that their last fight.\"        ENDNOTES:    (1)  Called \"Gripir\" in the Edda.        CHAPTER XVII. Of Sigurd's Avenging of Sigmund his Father.    Now Sigurd went to the kings, and spake thus--    \"Here have I abode a space with you, and I owe you thanks and reward,  for great love and many gifts and all due honour; but now will I away  from the land and go meet the sons of Hunding, and do them to wit that  the Volsungs are not all dead; and your might would I have to strengthen  me therein.\"    So the kings said that they would give him all things soever that  he desired, and therewith was a great army got ready, and all things  wrought in the most heedful wise, ships and all war-gear, so that his  journey might be of the stateliest: but Sigurd himself steered the  dragon-keel which was the greatest and noblest; richly wrought were  their sails, and glorious to look on.    So they sail and have wind at will; but when a few days were overpast,  there arose a great storm on the sea, and the waves were to behold even  as the foam of men's blood; but Sigurd bade take in no sail, howsoever  they might be riven, but rather to lay on higher than heretofore. But  as they sailed past the rocks of a ness, a certain man hailed the ships,  and asked who was captain over that navy; then was it told him that the  chief and lord was Sigurd, the son of Sigmund, the most famed of all the  young men who now are.    Then said the man, \"Naught but one thing, certes, do all say of him, that  none among the sons of kings may be likened unto him; now fain were I  that ye would shorten sail on some of the ships, and take me aboard.\"    Then they asked him of his name, and he sang--         \"Hnikar I hight,       When I gladdened Huginn,       And went to battle,       Bright son of Volsung;       Now may ye call       The carl on the cliff top,       Feng or Fjolnir:       Fain would I with you.\"    They made for land therewith, and took that man aboard.    Then quoth Sigurd,(1) as the song says--           \"Tell me this, O Hnikar,         Since full well thou knowest       Fate of Gods, good and ill of mankind,         What best our hap foresheweth,         When amid the battle       About us sweeps the sword edge.\"    Quoth Hnikar--           \"Good are many tokens         If thereof men wotted       When the swords are sweeping:         Fair fellow deem I         The dark-winged raven,       In war, to weapon-wielder.           \"The second good thing:         When abroad thou goest       For the long road well arrayed,         Good if thou seest         Two men standing,       Fain of fame within the forecourt.           \"A third thing:         Good hearing,         The wolf a howling       Abroad under ash boughs;         Good hap shalt thou have         Dealing with helm-staves,       If thou seest these fare before thee.           \"No man in fight         His face shall turn         Against the moon's sister         Low, late-shining,         For he winneth battle         Who best beholdeth         Through the midmost sword-play,         And the sloping ranks best shapeth.           \"Great is the trouble         Of foot ill-tripping,       When arrayed for fight thou farest,         For on both sides about         Are the D?sir (2) by thee,       Guileful, wishful of thy wounding.           \"Fair-combed, well washen         Let each warrior be,       Nor lack meat in the morning,         For who can rule         The eve's returning,       And base to fall before fate grovelling.\"    Then the storm abated, and on they fared till they came aland in the  realm of Hunding's sons, and then Fjolnir vanished away.    Then they let loose fire and sword, and slew men and burnt their abodes,  and did waste all before them: a great company of folk fled before the  face of them to Lyngi the King, and tell him that men of war are in the  land, and are faring with such rage and fury that the like has never  been heard of; and that the sons of King Hunding had no great forecast  in that they said they would never fear the Volsungs more, for here was  come Sigurd, the son of Sigmund, as captain over this army.    So King Lyngi let send the war-message all throughout his realm, and has  no will to flee, but summons to him all such as would give him aid. So  he came against Sigurd with a great army, he and his brothers with him,  and an exceeding fierce fight befell; many a spear and many an arrow  might men see there raised aloft, axes hard driven, shields cleft and  byrnies torn, helmets were shivered, skulls split atwain, and many a man  felled to the cold earth.    And now when the fight has long dured in such wise, Sigurd goes forth  before the banners, and has the good sword Gram in his hand, and smites  down both men and horses, and goes through the thickest of the throng  with both arms red with blood to the shoulder; and folk shrank aback  before him wheresoever he went, nor would either helm or byrny hold  before him, and no man deemed he had ever seen his like. So a long while  the battle lasted, and many a man was slain, and furious was the onset;  till at last it befell, even as seldom comes to hand, when a land army  falls on, that, do whatso they might, naught was brought about; but so  many men fell of the sons of Hunding that the tale of them may not be  told; and now whenas Sigurd was among the foremost, came the sons of  Hunding against him, and Sigurd smote therewith at Lyngi the king, and  clave him down, both helm and head, and mail-clad body, and thereafter  he smote Hjorward his brother atwain, and then slew all the other sons  of Hunding who were yet alive, and the more part of their folk withal.    Now home goes Sigurd with fair victory won, and plenteous wealth and  great honour, which he had gotten to him in this journey, and feasts  were made for him against he came back to the realm.    But when Sigurd had been at home but a little, came Regin to talk with  him, and said--    \"Belike thou wilt now have good will to bow down Fafnir's crest  according to thy word plighted, since thou hast thus revenged thy father  and the others of thy kin.\"    Sigurd answered, \"That will we hold to, even as we have promised, nor  did it ever fall from our memory.\"        ENDNOTES:    (1)  This and verses following were inserted from the \"Reginsmal\"         by the translators.    (2)  \"D?sir\", sing. \"D?s\".  These are the guardian beings who         follow a man from his birth to his death.  The word         originally means sister, and is used throughout the Eddaic         poems as a dignified synonym for woman, lady.        CHAPTER XVIII. Of the Slaying of the Worm Fafnir.    Now Sigurd and Regin ride up the heath along that same way wherein  Fafnir was wont to creep when he fared to the water; and folk say that  thirty fathoms was the height of that cliff along which he lay when he  drank of the water below. Then Sigurd spake:    \"How sayedst thou, Regin, that this drake (1) was no greater than other  lingworms; methinks the track of him is marvellous great?\"    Then said Regin, \"Make thee a hole, and sit down therein, and whenas  the worm comes to the water, smite him into the heart, and so do him to  death, and win thee great fame thereby.\"    But Sigurd said, \"What will betide me if I be before the blood of the  worm?\"    Says Regin, \"Of what avail to counsel thee if thou art still afeard of  everything? Little art thou like thy kin in stoutness of heart.\"    Then Sigurd rides right over the heath; but Regin gets him gone, sore  afeard.    But Sigurd fell to digging him a pit, and whiles he was at that work,  there came to him an old man with a long beard, and asked what he  wrought there, and he told him.    Then answered the old man and said, \"Thou doest after sorry counsel:  rather dig thee many pits, and let the blood run therein; but sit thee  down in one thereof, and so thrust the worm's heart through.\"    And therewithal he vanished away; but Sigurd made the pits even as it  was shown to him.    Now crept the worm down to his place of watering, and the earth shook  all about him, and he snorted forth venom on all the way before him as  he went; but Sigurd neither trembled nor was adrad at the roaring of  him. So whenas the worm crept over the pits, Sigurd thrust his sword  under his left shoulder, so that it sank in up to the hilts; then up  leapt Sigurd from the pit and drew the sword back again unto him, and  therewith was his arm all bloody, up to the very shoulder.    Now when that mighty worm was ware that he"]]]
