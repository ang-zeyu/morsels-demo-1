I  was nearly crazy when the men sauntered in with the dogs in tow. Oh,  say!\"    Browning fell over limply in his chair, as if the memory of what  followed was too much for him.    \"You have had a real warm time of it,\" grinned Swallows.    \"Warm! Warm! My boy, it was warm! Two of the women were showing me their  cats. The dogs saw the cats; the cats saw the dogs. One of the cats made  a flying leap for a dog. The other fled, and the other dog pursued. The  seven women shrieked all together, and the two men swore and tried to  catch the dogs. The other cats escaped from the baskets in which they  were confined. Warm! Say!\"    The king of the sophomores mopped his face with his handkerchief. He  seemed on the verge of utter collapse.    The listening lads could not entirely restrain their laughter. The  picture Browning presented and the incident he was relating were  altogether too ludicrous.    \"Talk about rackets!\" he wearily continued; \"we had one then and there.  The cats yowled and the dogs howled. The women fell over each other and  screamed blue murder. The men chased the dogs and roared blue blazes.  And the wind blew hard!    \"One of the cats alighted on an old lady's head. The cat's mistress  grabbed her and took her away. The cat had socked her claws into the old  lady's wig, and it came off, leaving her almost as bare as a billiard  ball. Oh, marmer!    \"Two of the cats fell to tearing the fur out of each other. Some of them  walked on the ceiling, like flies, in their endeavors to get away from  the dogs. One of them pounced on a dog's back and rode him around the  room, as if she were a circus performer. The other dog chased a cat  under the bed, and they were having it there. Oh, they didn't do a  thing--not a thing!    \"After a while one of the men captured one of the dogs and dragged him  toward the door. The other man saw him and made a rush for him. 'Drop  that dawg!' he yelled. 'It's my dawg!' the other man yelled back. And  then the other man howled, 'You're another. It's my dawg!'    \"Right away after that there was trouble between the owners of the dogs.  They tried to hurt each other, and they succeeded very well. One of them  had both eyes blacked, while the other lost two teeth, had his lips  split and his nose knocked out of plumb. But they smashed the stuffing  out of the furniture while they were doing it.    \"I climbed up on something in one corner and did my best to cheer them  on. I sincerely hoped both would be killed. The dogs seemed to feel it  their duty to enter into the spirit of the occasion, and they chewed  each other more or less.    \"Then the police came in. I came near landing in the station house,  along with the two men who were fighting, but they concluded not to  pinch me. The women departed after having once more expressed their  opinion all around concerning me.    \"When they were gone Hartwick came out of the clothespress. We sat down  amid the ruins and said over some words that will not bear repetition.    \"That's the whole of the cat-and-dog story. I've never been able to  prove that Merriwell put the advertisement into the paper, but it is all  settled in my mind. It was directly after this that I went into  training.\"    Some of the sophs laughed and some showed indignation.    \"It was a very nawsty thing to do,\" declared Paulding.    \"I can't help laughing over it.\" chuckled Tad Horner. \"But of course you  ought to get back at Merriwell.\"    \"Well, I shall do my best.\"    \"I don't think you need to train to do that trick,\" said Punch  Swallows. \"A man who can knock out Kid Lajoie ought to polish off a  freshman in a minute.\"    \"You haven't seen Merriwell fight?\"    \"No.\"    \"I have.\"    \"He is clever?\"    \"He is a corker. Of course I believe I can do him, but I want to do him  easy, and that is why I am training.\"    Another party of sophomores came in.    \"It is Harrison and his crowd,\" said Parker, \"and I'm blowed if they  haven't got Roll Ditson with them! That cad of a freshman has succeeded  in getting in here again.\"    \"Ditson hates Merriwell, don't yer know,\" said Paulding. \"He pretends to  be friendly with Merry, but he's ready to do him any time.\"          CHAPTER XI    \"LAMBDA CHI!\"      Ditson had fawned around Browning a great deal since entering college,  with the result that the king of the sophomores came to entertain a  feeling of absolute disgust for the fellow. The very sight of Ditson  made the \"king\" feel as if he would enjoy giving him a good \"polishing  off.\"    But Bruce was no bully, although he was a leader of the sophomores. He  had proved his ability to fight when it was necessary, but no one could  say that he ever showed any inclination to do bodily harm to one who was  weak and peaceable.    During his freshman year Browning had originated any number of wild  projects for sport, and he had always succeeded in carrying them through  successfully. Thus it came about that he was called the \"king,\" and his  companions continued to call him that when he became a sophomore.    But now there was a man in college who had fairly outwitted Browning on  several occasions, and so it came about that the king was aroused  against Frank Merriwell.    Browning keenly felt the sting of being beaten at his own game, and he  was obliged to confess to himself that Merriwell had accomplished the  trick.    But our hero was not inclined to let Bruce alone. He did not wait for  the king to become aggressive; he set about keeping Bruce in hot water,  and he succeeded very well.    The other freshmen, stimulated by the example of one who was distinctly  a leader among them, carried on such an energetic campaign against the  sophomores that the latter found themselves almost continually on the  defensive.    Such a thing had never before been known at Yale and the sophs were  highly indignant. They informed the freshmen that they were altogether  too fresh. They said the freshmen were breaking a time-honored custom,  and it must be stopped.    But the triumphant freshmen kept right on, laughing in the faces of  their angry foes.    It was expected that Browning would not delay about getting back at  Merriwell and his friends, and the admirers of the king were surprised  when he seemed to remain inactive.    Then it came out that Bruce was in training, and it was said that he was  putting himself in condition to give Merriwell the worst licking of his  life.    Frank heard about it, but he did not seem disturbed in the least.  Whenever any one spoke to him about it he merely smiled.    Among the freshmen there were some who believed Merriwell able to hold  his own against Browning. They were Harry Rattleton, Jack Diamond and  one or two more.    Diamond and Merriwell were not friendly, but they had ceased to be open  enemies. For the time being the hatchet was buried, and there was peace  between them.    But the two did not become friends. Merriwell continued to assert that  Diamond had sand, and Diamond was ready to back his judgment in saying  that Merriwell was a match for any man in Yale.    Morey's was a sophomore resort. Juniors and seniors patronized the  place, but a freshman was not allowed there unless invited to accompany  some of the regular frequenters of the place.    Ditson was ambitious. He was not satisfied to associate with those of  his own class, but he wanted it thought he was such a fine fellow that  the sophomores picked him up for his company.    Thus it happened that he had succeeded in getting into Morey's several  times, but he was killing his own chances of ever having any popularity,  although he did not know it.    Browning was angry when he saw the fellow come in. He called one of the  sophs over and said:    \"Say, what are you bringing it in here again for, my boy? It's been here  too many times already.\"    \"Who--Ditson?\"    \"Sure.\"    \"We're working him.\"    \"Working him? He's working you--for the drinks.\"    \"That's all right. He's telling us what he knows about Merriwell. If  there is anything in that fellow's history that we can use as a sore  spot, we may be able to suppress him.\"    \"All right,\" scowled Browning. \"Go ahead and pump the crooked sneak, but  don't swallow his lies. I don't believe he knows anything at all about  Merriwell.\"    A few minutes later the soph returned and said:    \"I don't think he knows much about him, myself, but he says he's down at  Billy's now--or was an hour ago. We might get a chance to Lambda Chi him  a little.\"    Browning seemed to arouse himself.    \"That's right,\" he agreed. \"We'll go down to Billy's.\"    The party filed out of Morey's and Browning took the lead. Ditson went  along with them as if he was a sophomore. He seemed to feel himself  highly honored, but Browning had hard work to choke back his absolute  contempt for the fellow.    As they went along, it was arranged that Ditson should go into Billy's  and see if Merriwell was there. One of the sophomores should accompany  him. If Merriwell was there and he should come out alone or in company  with one or two others, he was to be captured. Browning had a plan that  should be carried out if the capture was made.    Ditson seemed to think he was doing something very smart and cunning in  betraying a fellow freshman into the hands of the sophomores. He fancied  he was making himself solid with Browning's crowd.    Billy's was reached, and one of the sophs went in with Ditson, while the  others kept out of sight nearby.    After a little the soph came out and reported that Merriwell and  Rattleton were in there. He had treated the house, but Merriwell had  absolutely declined to take anything.    \"Oh, yes,\" nodded Browning. \"They say he never drinks. That's how he  keeps himself in such fine condition all the time. He will not smoke,  either, and he takes his exercise regularly. He is really a remarkable  freshie.\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1112"],[0,"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (#13)"],[1,"it.      Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

How canst thou try them so?      Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own      fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not      with me.      Cap.

I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell      And gave him what becomed love I might,      Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.      Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.      This is as't should be. Let me see the County.      Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.      Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,      All our whole city is much bound to him.      Jul.

Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,      I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;      For I have need of many orisons      To move the heavens to smile upon my state,      Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.

I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins      That almost freezes up the heat of life.      I'll call them back again to comfort me.      Nurse!- What should she do here?      My dismal scene I needs must act alone.      Come, vial.      What if this mixture do not work at all?      Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?      No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.                                               Lays down a dagger.      What if it be a poison which the friar      Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,      Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd      Because he married me before to Romeo?      I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,      For he hath still been tried a holy man.      I will not entertain so bad a thought.      How if, when I am laid into the tomb,      I wake before the time that Romeo      Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!      Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,      To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,      And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?      Or, if I live, is it not very like      The horrible conceit of death and night,      Together with the terror of the place-      As in a vault, an ancient receptacle      Where for this many hundred years the bones      Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;      Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,      Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,      At some hours in the night spirits resort-      Alack, alack, is it not like that I,      So early waking- what with loathsome smells,      And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,      That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-      O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,      Environed with all these hideous fears,      And madly play with my forefathers' joints,      And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,      And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone      As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?      O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost      Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body      Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!      Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;      But I will watch you from such watching now.                                            Exeunt Lady and Nurse.      Cap.

I have a head, sir, that will find out logs      And never trouble Peter for the matter.      Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!      Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.      The County will be here with music straight,      For so he said he would.                         Play music.      I hear him near.      Nurse! Wife!

You take your pennyworths now!      Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,      The County Paris hath set up his rest      That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!      Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!      I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!      Ay, let the County take you in your bed!      He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?                                       [Draws aside the curtains.]      What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?      I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
