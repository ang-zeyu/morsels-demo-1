[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8556"],[0,"The History of England from the Norman Conquest to the Death of John (1066-1216) (#12)"],[1,"1067 had been to discuss this matter with the Roman authorities,  quite as much as to get the pallium for the new Archbishop of Rouen. Now  the time had come for action.    Three legates of the pope were at Winchester, and there a council was  summoned to meet them. Two of the legates were cardinals, then a  relatively less exalted rank in the Church than later, but making plain  the direct support of the pope. The other was Ermenfrid, Bishop of Sion,  or Sitten, in what is now the Swiss canton of the Vallais. He had already  been in England eight years earlier as a papal legate, and he would bring  to this council ideas derived from local observation, as well as tried  diplomatic skill. Before the council met, the papal sanction of the  Conquest was publicly proclaimed, when the cardinal legates placed the  crown on the king's head at the Easter festival. On the octave of Easter,  in 1070, the council met. Its first business was to deal with the case of  Stigand. Something like a trial seems to have been held, but its result  could never have been in doubt. He was deprived of the archbishopric,  and, with that, of his other preferments, on three grounds: he had held  Winchester along with the primacy; he had held the primacy while Robert  was still the rightful archbishop according to the laws of the Church;  and he had obtained his pallium and his only recognition from the  antipope Benedict X. His brother, the Bishop of Elmham, was also deposed,  and some abbots at the same time.    An English chronicler of a little later date, Florence of Worcester,  doubtless representing the opinion of those contemporaries who were  unfavourable to the Normans, believed that for many of these depositions  there were no canonical grounds, but that they were due to the king's  desire to have the help of the Church in holding and pacifying his new  kingdom. We may admit the motive and its probable influence on the acts  of the time, without overlooking the fact that there would be likely to  be an honest difference in the interpretation of canonical rights and  wrongs on the Norman and the English sides, and that the Normans were  more likely to be right according to the prevailing standard of the  Church. The same chronicler gives us interesting evidence of the  contemporary native feeling about this council, and the way the rights of  the English were likely to be treated by it, in recording the fact that  it was thought to be a bold thing for the English bishop Wulfstan, of  Worcester, to demand his rights in certain lands which Aldred had kept in  his possession when he was transferred from the see of Worcester to the  archbishopric of York. The case was postponed, until there should be an  archbishop of York to defend the rights of his Church, but the brave  bishop had nothing to lose by his boldness. The treatment of the Church  throughout his reign is evidence of William's desire to act according to  established law, though it is also evidence of his ruling belief that the  new law was superior to the old, if ever a conflict arose between them.    Shortly after, at Whitsuntide, another council met at Windsor, and  continued the work. The cardinals had returned to Rome, but Ermenfrid was  still present. Further vacancies were made in the English Church in the  same way as by the previous council--by the end of the year only two, or  at most three, English bishops remained in office--but the main business  at this time was to fill vacancies. A new Archbishop of York, Thomas,  Canon of Bayeux, was appointed, and three bishops, Winchester, Selsey,  and Elmham, all of these from the royal chapel. But the most important  appointment of the time was that of Lanfranc, Abbot of St. Stephen's at  Caen, to be Archbishop of Canterbury. With evident reluctance he accepted  this responsible office, in which his work was destined to be almost as  important in the history of England as William's own. Two papal legates  crossing from England, Ermenfrid and a new one named Hubert, a synod of  the Norman clergy, Queen Matilda, and her son Robert, all urged him to  accept, and he yielded to their solicitation.    Lanfranc was at this time sixty-five years of age. An Italian by birth,  he had made good use of the advantages which the schools of that land  offered to laymen, but on the death of his father, while still a young  man, he had abandoned the path of worldly promotion which lay open before  him in the profession of the law, in which he had followed his father,  and had gone to France to teach and finally to become a monk. By 1045 he  was prior of the abbey of Bec, and within a few years he was famous  throughout the whole Church as one of its ablest theologians. In the  controversy with Berengar of Tours, on the nature of the Eucharist, he  had argued with great skill in favour of transubstantiation. Still more  important was the fact that his abilities and ideas were known to  William, who had long relied upon his counsel in the government of the  duchy, and that entire harmony of action was possible between them. He  has been called William's \"one friend,\" and while this perhaps unduly  limits the number of the king's friends, he was, in the greatest affairs  of his reign, his firm supporter and wise counsellor.    From the moment of his consecration, on August 29, 1070, the reformation  of the English Church went steadily on, until it was as completely  accomplished as was possible. The first question to be settled was perhaps  the most important of all, the question of unity of national organization.  The new Archbishop of York refused Lanfranc's demand that he should take  the oath of obedience to Canterbury, and asserted his independence and  coordinate position, and laid claim to three bordering bishoprics as  belonging to his metropolitan see,--Worcester, Lichfield, and Dorchester.  The dispute was referred to the king, who arranged a temporary compromise  in favour of Lanfranc, and then carried to the pope, by whom it was again  referred back to be decided by a council in England. This decision was  reached at a council in Windsor at Whitsuntide in 1072, and was in favour  of Lanfranc on all points, though it seems certain that the victory was  obtained by an extensive series of forgeries of which the archbishop  himself was probably the author.[4] It must be added, however, that the  moral judgment of that age did not regard as ours does such forgeries in  the interest of one's Church. If the decision was understood at the time  to mean that henceforth all archbishops of York should promise canonical  obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury, it did not permanently secure  that result. But the real point at issue in this dispute, at least for the  time being, was no mere matter of rank or precedence; it was as necessary  to the plans of Lanfranc and of the Church that his authority should be  recognized throughout the whole kingdom as it was to those of William. Nor  was the question without possible political significance. The political  independence of the north--still uncertain in its allegiance--would be far  easier to establish if it was, to begin with, ecclesiastically  independent.    Hardly less important than the settlement of this matter was the  establishment of the legislative independence of the Church. From the two  legatine councils of 1070, at Winchester and Windsor, a series begins of  great national synods, meeting at intervals to the end of the reign.  Complete divorce from the State was not at first possible. The council  was held at a meeting of the court, and was summoned by the king. He was  present at the sessions, as were also lay magnates of the realm, but the  questions proper to the council were discussed and decided by the  churchmen alone, and were promulgated by the Church as its own laws. This  was real legislative independence, even if the form of it was somewhat  defective, and before very long, as the result of this beginning, the  form came to correspond to the reality, and the process became as  independent as the conclusion.    William's famous ordinance separating the spiritual and temporal courts  decreed another extensive change necessary to complete the independence  of the Church in its legal interests. The date of this edict is not  certain, but it would seem from such evidence as we have to have been  issued not very long after the meeting of the councils of 1070. It  withdrew from the local popular courts, the courts of the hundred, all  future enforcement of the ecclesiastical laws, subjected all offenders  against these laws to trial in the bishop's court, and promised the  support of the temporal authorities to the processes and decisions of the  Church courts. This abolishing by edict of so important a prerogative of  the old local courts, and annulling of so large a part of the old law,  was the most violent and serious innovation made by the Conqueror in the  Saxon judicial system; but it was fully justified, not merely by the more  highly developed law which came into use as a result of the change, but  by the necessity of a stricter enforcement of that law than would ever be  possible through popular courts.    With these more striking changes went others, less revolutionary but  equally necessary to complete the new ecclesiastical system. The Saxon  bishops had many of them had their seats in unimportant places in their  dioceses, tending to degrade the dignity almost to the level of a rural  bishopric. The Norman prelates by degrees removed the sees to the chief  towns, changing the names with the change of place. Dorchester was  removed to Lincoln, Selsey to Chichester, Sherborne to Old Sarum, and  Elmham by two removes to Norwich. The new cities were the centres of life  and influence, and they were more suitable residences for barons of the  king, as the Norman bishops were. The inner organization of these  bishoprics was also improved. Cathedral chapters "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8559"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 360, November 25, 1882 (#12)"],[1,"has borne this out, for men who have been compelled  to live without nitrogenous food by dire necessity, and criminals on  whom the experiment has been tried, have all perished sooner or later in  consequence. When nitrogenous substances are used in the body, they  are, of course, broken up and oxidized, or perhaps we ought to say more  accurately, they take the place of the tissues of the body which wear  away and are carried off by oxidation and other chemical changes.    Now, modern science tell us that such changes are accompanied with  manifestations of energy in some form or other, most frequently in  that of heat, and we must look, therefore, upon nitrogenous food  as contributing to the energy of the body in addition to its other  functions.    What are the substances which we may class as nitrogenous. In the first  place, we have the typical example of the purest form in _albumin_,  or white of egg; and from this the name is now given to the class of  _albuminates_. The animal albuminates are: Albumin from eggs, fibrin  from muscles, or flesh, myosin, or synronin, also from animals, casein  (or cheesy matter) from milk, and the nitrogenous substances from blood.  In the vegetable kingdom, we have glutin, or vegetable fibrin, which is  the nourishing constituent of wheat, barley, oats, etc.; and legumin,  or vegetable casein, which is the peculiar substance found in peas and  beans. The other organic constituents--viz., the fats and the starches  and sugars--contain no nitrogen, and were at one time thought to be  concerned in producing animal heat.    We now know--thanks to the labors of Joule, Lyon Playfair, Clausius,  Tyndall, Helmholtz, etc.--that heat itself is a mode of motion, a form  of convertible energy, which can be made to do useful or productive  work, and be expressed in terms of actual work done. Modern experiment  shows that all our energy is derived from that of food, and, in  particular from the non-nitrogenous part of it, that is, the fat,  starch, and sugar. The nutrition of man is best maintained when he is  provided with a due admixture of all the four classes of aliment which  we have mentioned, and not only that, but he is also better off if he  has a variety of each class. Thus he may and ought to have albumen,  fibrine, gluten, and casein among the albuminates, or at least two of  them; butter and lard, or suet, or oil among the fats; starch of wheat,  potato, rice, peas, etc., and cane-sugar, and milk-sugar among the  carbo-hydrates. The salts cannot be replaced, so far as we know. Life  may be maintained in fair vigor for some time on albuminates only, but  this is done at the expense of the tissues, especially the fat of the  body, and the end must soon come; with fat and carbo hydrates alone  vigor may also be maintained for some time, at the expense of the  tissues also, but the limit is a near one, In either of these cases we  suppose sufficient water and salts to be provided.    We must now inquire into the quantities of food necessary; and this  necessitates a little consideration of the way in which the work of  the body is carried on. We must look upon the human body exactly as a  machine; like an engine with which we are all so familiar. A certain  amount of work requires to be done, say, a certain number of miles of  distance to be traversed; we know that to do this a certain number of  pounds, or hundredweights, or tons of coal must be put into the fire of  the boiler in order to furnish the requisite amount of energy through  the medium of steam. This amount of fuel must bear a certain proportion  to the work, and also to the velocity with which it is done, so both  quantity and time have to be accounted for.    No lecture on diet would be complete without a reference to the vexed  question of alcohol. I am no teetotal advocate, and I repudiate the  rubbish too often spouted from teetotal platforms, talk that is,  perhaps, inseparable from the advocacy of a cause that imports a good  deal of enthusiasm. I am at one, however, in recognizing the evils of  excess, and would gladly hail their diminution. But I believe that  alcohol properly used may be a comfort and a blessing, just as I know  that improperly used it becomes a bane and a curse. But we are now  concerned with it as an article of diet in relation to useful work, and  it may be well to call attention markedly to the fact that its use in  this way is very limited. The experiments of the late Dr. Parkes, made  in our laboratory, at Netley, were conclusive on the point, that beyond  an amount that would be represented by about one and a half to two pints  of beer, alcohol no longer provided any convertible energy, and that,  therefore, to take it in the belief that it did do so is an error.  It may give a momentary stimulus in considerable doses, but this is  invariably followed by a corresponding depression, and it is a maxim now  generally followed, especially on service, never to give it before or  during work. There are, of course, some persons who are better without  it altogether, and so all moderation ought to be commended, if not  enjoyed.    There are other beverages which are more useful than the alcoholic,  as restoratives, and for support in fatigue. Tea and coffee are  particularly good. Another excellent restorative is a weak solution  of Liebig's extract of meat, which has a remarkable power of removing  fatigue. Perhaps one of the most useful and most easily obtainable is  weak oatmeal gruel, either hot or cold. With regard to tobacco, it also  has some value in lessening fatigue in those who are able to take it,  but it may easily be carried to excess. Of it we may say, as of alcohol,  that in moderation it seems harmless, and even useful to some extent,  but, in excess, it is rank poison.    There is one other point which I must refer to, and which is especially  interesting to a great seaport like this. This is the question of  scurvy--a question of vital importance to a maritime nation. A paper  lately issued by Mr. Thomas Gray, of the Board of Trade, discloses the  regrettable fact that since 1873 there has been a serious falling off,  the outbreaks of scurvy having again increased until they reached  ninety-nine in 1881. This, Mr. Gray seems to think, is due to a neglect  of varied food scales; but it may also very probably have arisen from  the neglect of the regulation about lime-juice, either as to issue or  quality, or both. But it is also a fact of very great importance that  mere monotony of diet has a most serious effect upon health; variety  of food is not merely a pandering to gourmandism or greed, but a real  sanitary benefit, aiding digestion and assimilation. Our Board of Trade  has nothing to do with the food scales of ships, but Mr. Gray hints that  the Legislature will have to interfere unless shipowners look to it  themselves. The ease with which preserved foods of all kinds can be  obtained and carried now removes the last shadow of an excuse for  backwardness in this matter, and in particular the provision of a large  supply of potatoes, both fresh and dried, ought to be an unceasing care;  this is done on board American ships, and to this is doubtless owing in  a great part the healthiness of their crews. Scurvy in the present  day is a disgrace to shipowners and masters; and if public opinion is  insufficient to protect the seamen, the legislature will undoubtedly  step in and do so.    And now let me close by pointing out that the study of this commonplace  matter of eating and drinking opens out to us the conception of the  grand unity of nature; since we see that the body of man differs in no  way essentially from other natural combinations, but is subject to  the same universal physical laws, in which there is no blindness, no  variableness, no mere chance, and disobedience of which is followed as  surely by retribution as even the keenest eschatologist might desire.           *       *       *       *       *          RATTLESNAKE POISON.    By HENRY H. CROFT.      Some time since, in a paper to which I am unfortunately unable to refer,  a French chemist affirmed that the poisonous principle in snakes, or  eliminated by snakes, was of the nature of an alkaloid, and gave a name  to this class of bodies.    Mr. Pedler has shown that snake poison is destroyed or neutralized  by means of platinic chloride, owing probably to the formation of an  insoluble double platinic chloride, such as is formed with almost if not  all alkaloids.    In this country (Texas) where rattlesnakes are very common, and persons  camping out much exposed to their bites, a very favorite anecdote, or  _remedia_ as the Mexicans cull it, is a strong solution of iodine in  potassium iodide.[1]    [Footnote 1: The solution is applied as soon as possible to the wound,  preferably enlarged, and a few drops taken internally. The common  Mexican _remedia_ is the root of the _Agave virginica_ mashed or chewed  and applied to the wound, while part is swallowed.    Great faith is placed in this root by all residents here, who are seldom  I without it, but, I have had no experience of it myself; and the  internal administration is no doubt useless.    Even the wild birds know of this root; the queer paisano (? ground  woodpecker) which eats snakes, when wounded by a _vibora de cascabel_,  runs into woods, digs up and eats a root of the agave, just like the  mongoose; but more than that, goes back, polishes off his enemy, and  eats him. This has been told me by Mexicans who, it may be remarked, are  not _always_ reliable.]    I have had occasion to prove the efficacy of this mixture in two cases  of _cascabel_ bites, one on a buck, the other on a dog; and it occurred  to me that the same explanation of its action might be given as above  for the platinum salt, viz., the formation of an insoluble iodo compound  as with ordinary alkaloids if the snake poison really belongs to this  class.
