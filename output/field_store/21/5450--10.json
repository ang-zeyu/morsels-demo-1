A seat was offered to the parrot, who took it,  and, with his beak in the air, thus delivered his mission:--    'King Silver-sides!--My master, the King Jewel-plume, Lord of Lords,  bids thee, if life and lands be dear to thee, to come and make homage at  his august feet; and failing this to get thee gone from Camphor-island.'    'S'death!' exclaimed the Rajah, 'is there none that will silence this  traitor?'    'Give the sign, your Majesty,' said the Crow, starting up, 'and I will  despatch this audacious bird.'    'Sir,' said the Goose, 'be calm! and Sire, deign to listen--        ''Tis no Council where no Sage is--'tis no Sage that fears not Law;      'Tis no Law which Truth confirms not--'tis no Truth which Fear can              awe.'    An ambassador must speak unthreatened--        'Though base be the Herald, nor hinder nor let,        For the mouth of a king is he;      The sword may be whet, and the battle set,        But the word of his message is free.'    Thereat the Rajah and Night-cloud resumed their composure; and the  Parrot took his departure, escorted by the Minister, and presented with  complimentary gifts of gold and jewels. On reaching the palace of  Jewel-plume, the King demanded his tidings, and inquired of the country  he had visited.    'War must be prepared, may it please you,' said the Parrot: 'the  country is a country of Paradise.'    'Prepare for war, then!' said the King.    'We must not enter on it in the face of destiny,' interposed the  Vulture-Minister, whose title was 'Far-sight.'    'Let the Astrologer then discover a favorable conjuncture for the  expedition, and let my forces be reviewed meantime,' said the King.    'We must not march without great circumspection,' observed Far-sight.    'Minister!' exclaimed the King, 'you chafe me. Say, however, with what  force we should set out.'    'It should be well selected, rather than unwieldy,' replied the  Vulture--        'Better few and chosen fighters than of shaven crowns a host,      For in headlong flight confounded, with the base the brave are lost.'    And its commanders must be judiciously appointed; for it is said--        'Ever absent, harsh, unjustly portioning the captured prey--      These, and cold or laggard leaders make a host to melt away.'    'Ah!' interrupted the Rajah, 'what need of so much talk? We will go,  and, if Vachaspati please, we will conquer.'    Shortly afterwards the Spy returned to Camphor-island. 'King  Silver-sides,' he cried, 'the Rajah, Jewel-plume, is on his way hither,  and has reached the Ghauts. Let the fort be manned, for that Vulture is  a great minister; and I have learned, too, that there is one among us  who is in his pay.'    'King!' said the Goose, 'that must be the Crow.'    'But whence, then, did he show such willingness to punish the Parrot?'  objected his Majesty. 'Besides, war was declared long after the Crow  came to Court.'    'I misdoubt him,' said the Minister, 'because he is a stranger.'    'But strangers surely may be well-disposed,' replied the King. 'How say  the books?--        'Kind is kin, howe'er a stranger--kin unkind is stranger shown;      Sores hurt, though the body breeds them--drugs relieve, though              desert-grown.'    Have you never heard of King Sudraka and the unknown Servant, who gave  his son's life for the King?    'Never,' answered the Goose.      THE STORY OF THE FAITHFUL RAJPOOT    \"I will tell you the tale,\" said the King, \"as I heard it from  'Lilyflower,' daughter of the Flamingo 'White-flag,' of whom I was once  very fond:--A soldier presented himself one morning at King Sudraka's  gate, and bade the porter procure an audience for 'Vira-vara, a  Rajpoot,'[19] who sought employment. Being admitted to the presence, he  thus addressed the King:--    'If your Highness needs an attendant, behold one!'    'What pay do you ask?' inquired the King.    'Five hundred pieces of gold a day,' said Vira-vara.    'And your accoutrements?' asked the King.    'Are these two arms, and this sabre, which serve for a third,' said  Vira-vara, rolling up his sleeve.    'I cannot entertain you,' rejoined his Majesty; and thereupon the  Rajpoot made salaam, and withdrew. Then said the Ministers, 'If it  please your Majesty, the stipend is excessive, but give him pay for four  days, and see wherein he may deserve it.' Accordingly, the Rajpoot was  recalled, and received wages for four days, with the complimentary  betel.--Ah! the rare betel! Truly say the wise of it--        'Betel-nut is bitter, hot, sweet, spicy, binding, alkaline--      A demulcent--an astringent--foe to evils intestine;      Giving to the breath a fragrance--to the lips a crimson red;      A detergent, and a kindler of Love's flame that lieth dead.      Praise the gods for the good Betel!--these be thirteen virtues given,      Hard to meet in one thing blended, even in their happy heaven.'    'Now the King narrowly watched the spending of Vira-vara's pay, and  discovered that he bestowed half in the service of the Gods and the  support of Brahmans, a fourth part in relieving the poor, and reserved a  fourth for his sustenance and recreation. This daily division made, he  would take his stand with his sabre at the gate of the palace; retiring  only upon receiving the royal permission.    'It was on the fourteenth night of the dark half of the month that King  Sudraka heard below a sound of passionate sobbing. 'Ho! there,' he  cried, 'who waits at the gate?'    'I,' replied Vira-vara, 'may it please you.'    'Go and learn what means this weeping,' said the King.    'I go, your Majesty,' answered the Rajpoot, and therewith departed.    'No sooner was he gone than the King repented him of sending one man  alone into a night so dark that a bodkin might pierce a hole in it, and  girding on his scimitar, he followed his guard beyond the city gates.  When Vira-vara had gone thus far he encountered a beautiful and  splendidly dressed lady who was weeping bitterly; and accosting her, he  requested to know her name, and why she thus lamented.    'I am the Fortune of the King Sudraka,' answered she; 'a long while I  have lived happily in the shadow of his arm; but on the third day he  will die, and I must depart, and therefore lament I.'    'Can nothing serve, Divine Lady, to prolong thy stay?' asked the  Rajpoot.    'It might be,' replied the Spirit, 'if thou shouldst cut off the head of  thy first-born Shaktidhar, that hath on his body the thirty-two  auspicious marks of greatness. Were his head offered to the all-helpful  Durga, the Rajah should live a hundred years, and I might tarry beside  him.'    'So speaking, she disappeared, and Vira-vara retraced his steps to his  own house and awoke his wife and son. They arose, and listened with  attention until Vira-vara had repeated all the words of the vision. When  he had finished, Shaktidhar exclaimed, 'I am thrice happy to be able to  save the state of the King. Kill me, my father, and linger not; to give  my life in such a cause is good indeed,' 'Yes,' said the Mother, 'it is  good, and worthy of our blood; how else should we deserve the King's  pay?' Being thus agreed, they repaired together at once to the temple of  the Goddess Durga, and having paid their devotions and entreated the  favor of the deity on behalf of the King, Vira-vara struck off his son's  head, and laid it as an offering upon the shrine. That done, Vira-vara  said, 'My service to the King is accomplished, and life without my boy  is but a burden,' and therewith he plunged his sword in his own breast  and fell dead. Overpowered with grief for her husband and child, the  mother also withdrew the twice-blooded weapon, and slew herself with it  on the bodies of Vira-vara and Shaktidhar.    'All this was heard and seen by King Sudraka, and he stood aghast at the  sad sight. 'Woe is me!' he exclaimed--        'Kings may come, and Kings may go;      What was I, to bring these low?      Souls so noble, slain for me,      Were not, and will never be!'    What reck I of my realm, having lost these?' and thereat he drew his  scimitar to take his own life also. At that moment there appeared to him  the Goddess, who is Mistress of all men's fortunes. 'Son,' said she,  staying his lifted hand, 'forbear thy rash purpose, and bethink thee of  thy kingdom.'    \"The Rajah fell prostrate before her, and cried--'O Goddess! I am done  with life and wealth and kingdom! If thou hast compassion on me, let my  death restore these faithful ones to life; anywise I follow the path  they have marked,' 'Son,' replied the Goddess, 'thine affection is  pleasing to me: be it as thou wilt! The Rajpoot and his house shall be  rendered alive to thee.' Then the King departed, and presently saw  Vira-vara return, and take up again his station as before at the  palace-gate.    'Ho! there, Vira-vara!' cried the King, 'what meant the weeping?'    'Let your Majesty rest well!' answered the Rajpoot, 'it was a woman who  wept, and disappeared on my approach.' This answer completed the Rajah's  astonishment and delight; for we know--        'He is brave whose tongue is silent of the trophies of his sword;      He is great whose quiet bearing marks his greatness well assured.'    So when the day was come, he called a full council, and, declaring  therein all the events of the night, he invested the faithful guard with  the sovereignty of the Carnatic.    \"Thus, then,\" concluded King Silver-sides, \"in entertaining strangers a  man may add to his friends.\"    \"It may well be,\" replied the Goose; \"but a Minister should advise what  is expedient, and not what is pleasing in sentiment:--        'When the Priest, the Leech, the Vizir of a King his flatterers be,      Very soon the King will part with health, and wealth, and piety.'    'Let it pass, then,' said Silver-sides, 'and turn we to the matter in  hand. King Jewel-plume is even now pitched under the Ghauts. What think  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13272"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 2 (#13)"],[1," reproaches for my apparent negligence, you having sent me the money  and as yet received nothing in return. Unfair as this may appear, I know  you would be mollified towards me in a few minutes were we to meet.    Everything is now ready for you, except selecting the songs, but at all  events you shall receive one more than our agreement. I can send you more  _bagatelles_ than I promised, as I have got ten others beside; if you write  to me immediately, I will send you these, or as many as you wish for, along  with the rest.    My health, indeed, is not entirely reestablished by the baths, yet on the  whole I think I have improved. I had another annoyance here, owing to a  person having engaged an unsuitable lodging for me, which is hard on me, as  I cannot yet accustom myself to it, and my occupations are thus sadly  deranged.    The case with regard to the Mass stands thus: I finished one long ago, and  another is in progress. There is always a certain degree of gossip about  people of our class, which has, no doubt, misled you. I don't yet know  which you are to get. Besieged on all sides, I am almost forced to testify  the reverse of the _dictum_ that \"the spirit cannot be weighed.\" I send you  my best wishes, and trust that time will foster a beneficial and honorable  connection between us.    BEETHOVEN.      311.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    I was extremely unwell both yesterday and the day before; unfortunately  there was no one whom I could send to apprise Y.R.H. of the fact. As I felt  better towards evening, I went into the town to make Schlemmer correct the  Sonata.[1] He was not at home, so I requested him to come here to-day. I  send the Sonata by him, and will come in to-day before four o'clock to wait  on Y.R.H.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: The C minor pianoforte Sonata, Op. 111?]      312.    TO HERR PETERS.    Vienna, December 20, 1822.    I take advantage of a moment's leisure to-day to answer your letter. Not  one of all the works that are your property is unfinished, but time is too  precious to particularize all the details that prevent the copying and  sending off the music to you. I recollect in a former letter having offered  you some more _bagatelles_, but I by no means press you to take them. If  you wish only to have the four, so be it; but in that case I must make a  different selection. Herr ---- has not as yet got anything from me. Herr  ---- begged me to make him a present of the songs for the \"Journal de la  Mode,\" which, in fact, I did not write for money; indeed, I find it quite  impossible to act in every case according to so much _per cent_. It is  painful for me to calculate in this manner oftener than is absolutely  necessary. My position is far from being so brilliant as you think, &c.,  &c. It is not possible to listen to all these proposals at once, being far  too numerous, but many cannot be refused. A commission is not always quite  in accordance with the inclinations of an author. If my salary were not so  far reduced as to be no salary at all,[1] I would write nothing but  symphonies for a full orchestra, and church music, or at most quartets.    Of my minor works, you can still have Variations for two oboes and one  English horn, on the theme from \"Don Giovanni,\" \"_La ci darem la mano_,\"  and a Gratulation Minuet for a full orchestra. I should be glad, likewise,  to have your opinion about the full edition of my works.    In the most desperate haste, your obedient    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: It was reduced from 4000 gulden to 800.]      313.    TO F. RIES,--LONDON    Vienna, December 20, 1822.    MY DEAR RIES,--    I have been so overburdened with work that I am only now able to reply to  your letter of November 15. I accept with pleasure the proposal to write a  new symphony for the Philharmonic Society. Although the prices given by the  English cannot be compared with those paid by other nations, still I would  gladly write even gratis for those whom I consider the first artists in  Europe--were I not still, as ever, the poor Beethoven.    If I were only in London, what would I not write for the Philharmonic! For  Beethoven, thank God! can write--if he can do nothing in the world besides!  If Providence only vouchsafes to restore my health, which is at least  improving, I shall then be able to respond to the many proposals from all  parts of Europe, and even North America, and may thus perhaps be some day  in clover.      314.    TO IGNAZ RITTER VON SEYFRIED.    1822.    MY DEAR AND WORTHY BROTHER IN APOLLO,--    I heartily thank you for the trouble you have taken in aiding my  _charitable work_.[1] I rejoice that its success is universally admitted,  and hope you will never fail to let me know when it is in my power to serve  you by my poor talents. The worthy municipal corporation is, no doubt,  thoroughly convinced of my good-will; in order to give fresh proofs of it,  we ought to have a friendly interview as to the mode in which I can best  serve the corporation. When such a master as yourself takes an interest in  us, our pinions ought never to droop.    I am, with the warmest esteem,    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Seyfried, at a concert for the benefit of the Burgher  Hospital, performed Beethoven's grand fugue _Fest Ouverture_ (in C major,  in Op. 124), 1822, in celebration of the opening of the new Josephstadt  Theatre. The written parts were returned to him with the grateful thanks of  the committee.]          THIRD PART      LIFE'S TROUBLES AND CLOSE.  1823 TO 1827.          315.    TO ZELTER.[1]    Vienna, Feb. 8, 1823.    MY BRAVE COLLEAGUE IN ART,--    I write, having a favor to ask of you, for we are now so distant from each  other that we can no longer converse together, and, indeed, unhappily, we  can seldom write either. I have written a grand mass, which might also be  given as an oratorio (for the benefit of the poor, a good established  custom here). I do not wish to publish it in the usual way, but to dispose  of it to some of the leading courts alone. I ask fifty ducats for it. No  copies are to be sold except those subscribed for, so that the mass will  be, as it were, in manuscript; but there must be a fair number of  subscribers, if any profit is to accrue to the author. I have made an  application to the Prussian embassy here, to know if the King of Prussia  would vouchsafe to take a copy, and I have also written to Prince  Radziwill, to ask him to interest himself in the affair. I beg you likewise  to do what you can for me. It is a work that might likewise be useful to  the Academy of Singing, for there is scarcely any portion of it that could  not be almost entirely executed by voices. The more these are increased and  multiplied in combination with instruments, the more effective would be the  result. It ought to be appropriate also as an oratorio, for such societies  as those for the benefit of the poor require marks of this kind. Having  been an invalid for some years past, and consequently my position anything  but brilliant, I have had recourse to this scheme. I have written much; but  as to profits, they are nearly _nil_! The more do I look upwards; but both  for his own sake, and that of others, man is obliged to turn his eyes  earthwards; for this, too, is part of the destiny of humanity. I embrace  you, my dear fellow-artist, and am, with sincere esteem,    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Zelter was in Vienna in 1819.]      316.    TO F. RIES,--LONDON.    ... Manage this as soon as you can for your poor friend. I also expect my  travelling route from you. Things have become quite too bad here, and I am  fleeced worse than ever. If I do not go at all, lo! and behold a _crimen  laesae_!... As it seems that you wish soon to have a dedication from me, I  gladly comply with your request, much more so than with that of any great  man; though, _entre nous_, the devil alone can tell how soon one may fall  into their hands! The dedication to you will be written on the new  symphony; and I hope I shall at length receive yours to me.    B. is to open the letter he took charge of for the King [George IV.], in  which he will see what I have written to His Majesty on the subject of the  \"Battle of Vittoria.\" The tenor of the enclosed is the same; but not a word  as to the mass.[1] Our amiable friend B. must try to get me at least a  battle-axe or a turtle for it! The engraved copy of the score of \"The  Battle\" must also be presented to the King. This letter will cost you a  good deal [seventeen shillings]; but I beg you will deduct it from your  remittance to me. How much I regret being so troublesome! May God prosper  you!    Say all that is amiable to your wife till I come myself. Beware! you think  me old; but I am a young veteran!    Yours, as ever,    B.    [Footnote 1: On February 24, 1823, Beethoven wrote to the King of England  that, so far back as 1813, he had sent him \"Wellington's Victory,\" but  never had received any communication on the subject; he, therefore, now  sent an engraved copy of the work, which had been intended for him since  1815. He closed the letter by saying: \"Convinced of the discrimination and  kindness which your Majesty has always evinced in protecting and  encouraging art and artists, the undersigned ventures to hope that your  Majesty will graciously take the matter into consideration, and vouchsafe  to comply with his respectful solicitation.\"]      317.

MY VERY BEST OPTIMUS OPTIME,--    Pray try to hunt out a philanthropist who will advance me some money on a  bank-share, that I may not put the generosity of my friends too much to the  test, nor myself be placed in difficulty by the delay of this money, for  which I have to thank the fine plans and arrangements of my precious  brother.
