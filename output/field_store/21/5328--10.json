Them sacks look good to me.\"    Lenore waited with some perturbation. She had a guilty conscience and  she feared he meant to quiz her about her sudden change of front  regarding the Bend trip. So she could not look up and she could not say  a word.    \"Jake says that Nash has been tryin' to make up to you. Any sense in  what he says?\" asked her father, bluntly.    \"Why, hardly. Oh, I've noticed Nash is--is rather fresh, as Rose calls  it,\" replied Lenore, somewhat relieved at this unexpected query.    \"Yes, he's been makin' eyes at Rose. She told me,\" replied Anderson.    \"Discharge him,\" said Lenore, forcibly.    \"So I ought. But let me tell you, Lenore. I've been hopin' to get Nash  dead to rights.\"    \"What more do you want?\" she demanded.    \"I mean regardin' his relation to the I.W.W.... Listen. Here's the  point. Nash has been tracked an' caught in secret talks with prominent  men in this country. Men of foreign blood an' mebbe foreign sympathies.  We're at the start of big an' bad times in the good old U.S. No one can  tell how bad. Well, you know my position in the Golden Valley. I'm  looked to. Reckon this I.W.W. has got me a marked man. I'm packin' two  guns right now. An' you bet Jake is packin' the same. We don't travel  far apart any more this summer.\"    Lenore had started shudderingly and her look showed her voiceless fear.    \"You needn't tell your mother,\" he went on, more intimately. \"I can  trust you an' ... To come back to Nash. He an' this Glidden--you  remember, one of those men at Dorn's house--they are usin' gold. They  must have barrels of it. If I could find out where that gold comes from!  Probably they don't know. But I might find out if men here in our own  country are hatchin' plots with the I.W.W.\"    \"Plots! What for?\" queried Lenore, breathlessly.    \"To destroy my wheat, to drive off or bribe the harvest-hands, to  cripple the crop yield in the Northwest; to draw the militia here; in  short, to harass an' weaken an' slow down our government in its  preparation against Germany.\"    \"Why, that is terrible!\" declared Lenore.    \"I've a hunch from Jake--there's a whisper of a plot to put me out of  the way,\" said Anderson, darkly.    \"Oh--good Heavens! You don't mean it!\" cried Lenore, distractedly.    \"Sure I do. But that's no way for Anderson's daughter to take it. Our  women have got to fight, too. We've all got to meet these German hired  devils with their own weapons. Now, lass, you know you'll get these  wheatlands of mine some day. It's in my will. That's because you, like  your dad, always loved the wheat. You'd fight, wouldn't you, to save  your grain for our soldiers--bread for your own brother Jim--an' for  your own land?\"    \"Fight! Would I?\" burst out Lenore, with a passionate little cry.    \"Good! Now you're talkin'!\" exclaimed her father.    \"I'll find out about this Nash--if you'll let me,\" declared Lenore, as  if inspired.    \"How? What do you mean, girl?\"    \"I'll encourage him. I'll make him think I'm a wishy-washy moonstruck  girl, smitten with him. All's fair in war!... If he means ill by my  father--\"    Anderson muttered low under his breath and his big hand snapped hard at  the nodding goldenrod.    \"For my sake--to help me--you'd encourage Nash--flirt with him a  little--find out all you could?\"    \"Yes, I would!\" she cried, deliberately. But she wanted to cover her  face with her hands. She trembled slightly, then grew cold, with a  sickening disgust at this strange, new, uprising self.    \"Wait a minute before you say too much,\" went on Anderson. \"You're my  best-beloved child, my Lenore, the lass I've been so proud of all my  life. I'd spill blood to avenge an insult to you.... But, Lenore, we've  entered upon a terrible war. People out here, especially the women,  don't realize it yet. But you must realize it. When I said good-by to  Jim, my son, I--I felt I'd never look upon his face again!... I gave him  up. I could have held him back--got exemption for him. But, no, by God!  I gave him up--to make safety and happiness and prosperity for--say,  your children, an' Rose's, an' Kathleen's.... I'm workin' now for the  future. So must every loyal man an' every loyal woman! We love our own  country. An' I ask you to see as I see the terrible danger to that  country. Think of you an' Rose an' Kathleen bein' treated like those  poor Belgian girls! Well, you'd get that an' worse if the Germans won  this war. An' the point is, for us to win, every last one of us must  fight, sacrifice to that end, an' hang together.\"    Anderson paused huskily and swallowed hard while he looked away across  the fields. Lenore felt herself drawn by an irresistible power. The west  wind rustled through the waving wheat. She heard the whir of the  threshers. Yet all seemed unreal. Her father's passion had made this  place another world.    \"So much for that,\" resumed Anderson. \"I'm goin' to do my best. An' I  may make blunders. I'll play the game as it's dealt out to me. Lord  knows I feel all in the dark. But it's the nature of the effort, the  spirit, that'll count. I'm goin' to save most of the wheat on my  ranches. An' bein' a Westerner who can see ahead, I know there's goin'  to be blood spilled.... I'd give a lot to know who sent this Nash spyin'  on me. I'm satisfied now he's an agent, a spy, a plotter for a gang  that's marked me. I can't prove it yet, but I feel it. Maybe nothin'  worth while--worth the trouble--will ever be found out from him. But I  don't figure that way. I say play their own game an' take a chance....  If you encouraged Nash you'd probably find out all about him. The worst  of it is could you be slick enough? Could a girl as fine an' square an'  high-spirited as you ever double-cross a man, even a scoundrel like  Nash? I reckon you could, considerin' the motive. Women are  wonderful.... Well, if you can fool him, make him think he's a winner,  flatter him till he swells up like a toad, promise to elope with him, be  curious, jealous, make him tell where he goes, whom he meets, show his  letters, all without ever sufferin' his hand on you, I'll give my  consent. I'd think more of you for it. Now the question is, can you do  it?\"    \"Yes,\" whispered Lenore.    \"Good!\" exploded Anderson, in a great relief. Then he began to mop his  wet face. He arose, showing the weight of heavy guns in his pockets, and  he gazed across the wheat-fields. \"That wheat'll be ripe in a week. It  sure looks fine.... Lenore, you ride back home now. Don't let Jake pump  you. He's powerful curious. An' I'll go give these I.W.W.'s a first dose  of Anderson.\"    He turned away without looking at her, and he hesitated, bending over to  pluck a stem of goldenrod.    \"Lass--you're--you're like your mother\", he said, unsteadily. \"An' she  helped me win out durin' my struggle here. You're brave an' you're big.\"    Lenore wanted to say something, to show her feeling, to make her task  seem lighter, but she could not speak.    \"We're pards now--with no secrets\", he continued, with a different note  in his voice. \"An' I want you to know that it ain't likely Nash or  Glidden will get out of this country alive.\"          CHAPTER VII    Three days later, Lenore accompanied her father on the ride to the Bend  country. She sat in the back seat of the car with Jake--an arrangement  very gratifying to the cowboy, but received with ill-concealed  displeasure by the driver, Nash. They had arranged to start at sunrise,  and it became manifest that Nash had expected Lenore to sit beside him  all during the long ride. It was her father, however, who took the front  seat, and behind Nash's back he had slyly winked at Lenore, as if to  compliment her on the evident success of their deep plot. Lenore, at the  first opportunity that presented, shot Nash a warning glance which was  sincere enough. Jake had begun to use keen eyes, and there was no  telling what he might do.    The morning was cool, sweet, fresh, with a red sun presaging a hot day.  The big car hummed like a droning bee and seemed to cover the miles as  if by magic. Lenore sat with face uncovered, enjoying the breeze and the  endless colorful scene flashing by, listening to Jake's amusing  comments, and trying to keep back thought of what discovery might await  her before the end of this day.    Once across the Copper River, they struck the gradual ascent, and here  the temperature began to mount and the dust to fly. Lenore drew her  veils close and, leaning comfortably back, she resigned herself to wait  and to endure.    By the flight of a crow it was about a hundred miles from Anderson's  ranch to Palmer; but by the round-about roads necessary to take the  distance was a great deal longer. Lenore was well aware when they got up  on the desert, and the time came when she thought she would suffocate.  There appeared to be intolerable hours in which no one spoke and only  the hum and creak of the machine throbbed in her ears. She could not see  through her veils and did not part them until a stop was made at Palmer.    Her father got out, sputtering and gasping, shaking the dust in clouds  from his long linen coat. Jake, who always said he lived on dust and  heat, averred it was not exactly a regular fine day. Lenore looked out,  trying to get a breath of air. Nash busied himself with the hot engine.    The little country town appeared dead, and buried under dust. There was  not a person in sight nor a sound to be heard. The sky resembled molten  lead, with a blazing center too bright for the gaze of man.    Anderson and Jake went into the little hotel to get some refreshments.  Lenore preferred to stay in the car, saying she wanted only a cool  drink. The moment the two men were out of sight Nash straightened up to  gaze darkly and hungrily at Lenore.    \"This's a good a chance as we'll get,\" he said, in an eager, hurried  whisper.    \"For what?\" asked Lenore, aghast.    \"To run off,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],[0,"Town Geology (#13)"],[1,"matter.  But it is certain   that most of these sands were deposited in a very shallow water, and   very near to land.  Sand and pebbles, as I said in my first paper,   could not be carried far out to sea; and some of the beds of the   Bunter are full of rounded pebbles.  Nay, it is certain that their   surface was often out of water.  Of that you may see very pretty   proofs.  You find these sands ripple-marked, as you do shore-sands   now.  You find cracks where the marl mud has dried in the sun:  and,   more, you find the little pits made by rain.  Of that I have no   doubt.  I have seen specimens, in which you could not only see at a   glance that the marks had been made by the large drops of a shower,   but see also from what direction the shower had come.  These delicate   markings must have been covered up immediately with a fresh layer of   mud or sand.  How long since?  How long since that flag had seen the   light of the sun, when it saw it once again, restored to the upper   air by the pick of the quarryman?  Who can answer that?  Not I.    Fossils are very rare in these sands; it is not easy to say why.  It   may be that the red oxide of iron in them has destroyed them.  Few or   none are ever found in beds in which it abounds.  It is curious, too,   that the Keuper, which is all but barren of fossils in England, is   full of them in Wurtemberg, reptiles, fish, and remains of plants   being common.  But what will interest the reader are the footprints   of a strange beast, found alike in England and in Germany--the   Cheirotherium, as it was first named, from its hand-like feet; the   Labyrinthodon, as it is now named, from the extraordinary structure   of its teeth.  There is little doubt now, among anatomists, that the   bones and teeth of the so-called Labyrinthodon belong to the animal   which made the footprints.  If so, the creature must have been a   right loathly monster.  Some think him to have been akin to lizards;   but the usual opinion is that he was a cousin of frogs and toads.    Looking at his hands and other remains, one pictures him to oneself   as a short, squat brute, as big as a fat hog, with a head very much   the shape of a baboon, very large hands behind and small ones in   front, waddling about on the tide flats of a sandy sea, and dragging   after him, seemingly, a short tail, which has left its mark on the   sand.  What his odour was, whether he was smooth or warty, what he   ate, and in general how he got his living, we know not.  But there   must have been something there for him to eat; and I dare say that he   was about as happy and about as intellectual as the toad is now.    Remember always that there is nothing alive now exactly like him, or,   indeed, like any animal found in these sandstones.  The whole animal   world of this planet has changed entirely more than once since the   Labyrinthodon waddled over the Cheshire flats.  A lizard, for   instance, which has been found in the Keuper, had a skull like a   bird's, and no teeth--a type which is now quite extinct.  But there   is a more remarkable animal of which I must say a few words, and one   which to scientific men is most interesting and significant.    Both near Warwick, and near Elgin in Scotland, in Central India, and   in South Africa, fossil remains are found of a family of lizards   utterly unlike anything now living save one, and that one is crawling   about, plentifully I believe--of all places in the world--in New   Zealand.  How it got there; how so strange a type of creature should   have died out over the rest of the world, and yet have lasted on in   that remote island for long ages, ever since the days of the New Red   sandstone, is one of those questions--quite awful questions I   consider them--with which I will not puzzle my readers.  I only   mention it to show them what serious questions the scientific man has   to face, and to answer, if he can.  Only the next time they go to the   Zoological Gardens in London, let them go to the reptile-house, and   ask the very clever and courteous attendant to show them the   Sphenodons, or Hatterias, as he will probably call them--and then   look, I hope with kindly interest, at the oldest Conservatives they   ever saw, or are like to see; gentlemen of most ancient pedigree, who   have remained all but unchanged, while the whole surface of the globe   has changed around them more than once or twice.    And now, of course, my readers will expect to hear something of the   deposits of rock-salt, for which Cheshire and its red rocks are   famous.  I have never seen them, and can only say that the salt does   not, it is said by geologists, lie in the sandstone, but at the   bottom of the red marl which caps the sandstone.  It was formed most   probably by the gradual drying up of lagoons, such as are depositing   salt, it is said now, both in the Gulf of Tadjara, on the Abyssinian   frontier opposite Aden, and in the Runn of Cutch, near the Delta of   the Indus.  If this be so, then these New Red sandstones may be the   remains of a whole Sahara--a sheet of sandy and all but lifeless   deserts, reaching from the west of England into Germany, and rising   slowly out of the sea; to sink, as we shall find, beneath the sea   again.    And now, as to the vast period of time--the four or five worlds, as I   called it--which elapsed between the laying down of the New Red   sandstones and the laying down of the boulder-clays.    I think this fact--for fact it is--may be better proved by taking   readers an imaginary railway journey to London from any spot in the   manufacturing districts of central England--begging them, meanwhile,   to keep their eyes open on the way.    And here I must say that I wish folks in general would keep their   eyes a little more open when they travel by rail.  When I see young   people rolling along in a luxurious carriage, their eyes and their   brains absorbed probably in a trashy shilling novel, and never lifted   up to look out of the window, unconscious of all that they are   passing--of the reverend antiquities, the admirable agriculture, the   rich and peaceful scenery, the like of which no country upon earth   can show; unconscious, too, of how much they might learn of botany   and zoology, by simply watching the flowers along the railway banks   and the sections in the cuttings:  then it grieves me to see what   little use people make of the eyes and of the understanding which God   has given them.  They complain of a dull journey:  but it is not the   journey which is dull; it is they who are dull.  Eyes have they, and   see not; ears have they, and hear not; mere dolls in smart clothes,   too many of them, like the idols of the heathen.    But my readers, I trust, are of a better mind.  So the next time they   find themselves running up southward to London--or the reverse way--  let them keep their eyes open, and verify, with the help of a   geological map, the sketch which is given in the following pages.    Of the \"Black Countries\"--the actual coal districts I shall speak   hereafter.  They are in England either shores or islands yet   undestroyed, which stand out of the great sea of New Red sandstone,   and often carry along their edges layers of far younger rocks, called   now Permian, from the ancient kingdom of Permia, in Russia, where   they cover a vast area.  With them I will not confuse the reader just   now, but will only ask him to keep his eye on the rolling plain of   New Red sands and marls past, say, Birmingham and Warwick.  After   those places, these sands and marls dip to the south-east, and other   rocks and soils appear above them, one after another, dipping   likewise towards the south-east--that is, toward London.    First appear thin layers of a very hard blue limestone, full of   shells, and parted by layers of blue mud.  That rock runs in a broad   belt across England, from Whitby in Yorkshire, to Lyme in   Dorsetshire, and is known as Lias.  Famous it is, as some readers may   know, for holding the bones of extinct monsters--Ichthyosaurs and   Plesiosaurs, such as the unlearned may behold in the lake at the   Crystal Palace.  On this rock lie the rich cheese pastures, and the   best tracts of the famous \"hunting shires\" of England.    Lying on it, as we go south-eastward, appear alternate beds of sandy   limestone, with vast depths of clay between them.  These \"oolites,\"   or freestones, furnish the famous Bath stone, the Oxford stone, and   the Barnack stone of Northamptonshire, of which some of the finest   cathedrals are built--a stone only surpassed, I believe, by the Caen   stone, which comes from beds of the same age in Normandy.  These   freestones and clays abound in fossils, but of kinds, be it   remembered, which differ more and more from those of the lias   beneath, as the beds are higher in the series, and therefore nearer.    There, too, are found principally the bones of that extraordinary   flying lizard, the Pterodactyle, which had wings formed out of its   fore-legs, on somewhat the same plan as those of a bat, but with one   exception.  In the bat, as any one may see, four fingers of the hand   are lengthened to carry the wing, while the first alone is left free,   as a thumb:  but in the Pterodactyle, the outer or \"little\" finger   alone is lengthened, and the other four fingers left free--one of   those strange instances in nature of the same effect being produced   in widely different plants and animals, and yet by slightly different   means, on which a whole chapter of natural philosophy--say, rather,   natural theology--will have to be written some day.    But now consider what this Lias, and the Oolites and clays upon it   mean.  They mean that the New Red sandstone, after it had been dry   land, or all but dry land (as is proved by the footprints of animals   and the deposits of salt), was sunk again beneath the sea.  Each   deposit of limestone signifies a long"]]]
