[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11242"],[0,"The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti (#13)"],[1,"in Florence was convened at the Opera  del Duomo to consider where it should be placed.    We possess full minutes of this meeting, and they are so curious that  I shall not hesitate to give a somewhat detailed account of the  proceedings. Messer Francesco Filarete, the chief herald of the  Signory, and himself an architect of some pretensions, opened the  discussion in a short speech to this effect: \"I have turned over in my  mind those suggestions which my judgment could afford me. You have two  places where the statue may be set up: the first, that where the  Judith stands; the second, in the middle of the courtyard where the  David is. The first might be selected, because the Judith is an omen  of evil, and no fit object where it stands, we having the cross and  lily for our ensign; besides, it is not proper that the woman should  kill the male; and, above all, this statue was erected under an evil  constellation, since you have gone continually from bad to worse since  then. Pisa has been lost too. The David of the courtyard is imperfect  in the right leg; and so I should counsel you to put the Giant in one  of these places, but I give the preference myself to that of the  Judith.\" The herald, it will be perceived, took for granted that  Michelangelo's David would be erected in the immediate neighbourhood  of the Palazzo Vecchio. The next speaker, Francesco Monciatto, a  wood-carver, advanced the view that it ought to be placed in front of  the Duomo, where the Colossus was originally meant to be put up. He  was immediately followed, and his resolution was seconded, by no less  personages than the painters Cosimo Rosselli and Sandro Botticelli.  Then Giuliano da San Gallo, the illustrious architect, submitted a  third opinion to the meeting. He began his speech by observing that he  agreed with those who wished to choose the steps of the Duomo, but due  consideration caused him to alter his mind. \"The imperfection of the  marble, which is softened by exposure to the air, rendered the  durability of the statue doubtful. He therefore voted for the middle  of the Loggia dei Lanzi, where the David would be under cover.\" Messer  Angelo di Lorenzo Manfidi, second herald of the Signory, rose to state  a professional objection. \"The David, if erected under the middle arch  of the Loggia, would break the order of the ceremonies practised there  by the Signory and other magistrates. He therefore proposed that the  arch facing the Palazzo (where Donatello's Judith is now) should be  chosen.\" The three succeeding speakers, people of no great importance,  gave their votes in favour of the chief herald's resolution. Others  followed San Gallo, among whom was the illustrious Lionardo da Vinci.  He thought the statue could be placed under the middle arch of the  Loggia without hindrance to ceremonies of state. Salvestro, a  jeweller, and Filippino Lippi, the painter, were of opinion that the  neighbourhood of the Palazzo should be adopted, but that the precise  spot should be left to the sculptor's choice. Gallieno, an  embroiderer, and David Ghirlandajo, the painter, suggested a new  place--namely, where the lion or Marzocco stood on the Piazza. Antonio  da San Gallo, the architect, and Michelangelo, the goldsmith, father  of Baccio Bandinelli, supported Giuliano da San Gallo's motion. Then  Giovanni Piffero--that is, the father of Benvenuto Cellini--brought  the discussion back to the courtyard of the palace. He thought that in  the Loggia the statue would be only partly seen, and that it would run  risks of injury from scoundrels. Giovanni delle Corniole, the  incomparable gem-cutter, who has left us the best portrait of  Savonarola, voted with the two San Galli, \"because he hears the stone  is soft.\" Piero di Cosimo, the painter, and teacher of Andrea del  Sarto, wound up the speeches with a strong recommendation that the  choice of the exact spot should be left to Michelangelo Buonarroti.  This was eventually decided on, and he elected to have his David set  up in the place preferred by the chief herald--that is to say, upon  the steps of the Palazzo Vecchio, on the right side of the entrance.    The next thing was to get the mighty mass of sculptured marble safely  moved from the Duomo to the Palazzo. On the 1st of April, Simone del  Pollajuolo, called Il Cronaca, was commissioned to make the necessary  preparations; but later on, upon the 30th, we find Antonio da San  Gallo, Baccio d'Agnolo, Bernardo della Ciecha, and Michelangelo  associated with him in the work of transportation. An enclosure of  stout beams and planks was made and placed on movable rollers. In the  middle of this the statue hung suspended, with a certain liberty of  swaying to the shocks and lurches of the vehicle. More than forty men  were employed upon the windlasses which drew it slowly forward. In a  contemporary record we possess a full account of the transit: \"On the  14th of May 1504, the marble Giant was taken from the Opera. It came  out at 24 o'clock, and they broke the wall above the gateway enough to  let it pass. That night some stones were thrown at the Colossus with  intent to harm it. Watch had to be kept at night; and it made way very  slowly, bound as it was upright, suspended in the air with enormous  beams and intricate machinery of ropes. It took four days to reach the  Piazza, arriving on the 18th at the hour of 12. More than forty men  were employed to make it go; and there were fourteen rollers joined  beneath it, which were changed from hand to hand. Afterwards, they  worked until the 8th of June 1504 to place it on the platform  _(ringhiero)_ where the Judith used to stand. The Judith was removed  and set upon the ground within the palace. The said Giant was the work  of Michelangelo Buonarroti.\"    Where the masters of Florence placed it, under the direction of its  maker, Michelangelo's great white David stood for more than three  centuries uncovered, open to all injuries of frost and rain, and to  the violence of citizens, until, for the better preservation of this  masterpiece of modern art, it was removed in 1873 to a hall of the  Accademia delle Belle Arti. On the whole, it has suffered very little.  Weather has slightly worn away the extremities of the left foot; and  in 1527, during a popular tumult, the left arm was broken by a huge  stone cast by the assailants of the palace. Giorgio Vasari tells us  how, together with his friend Cecchino Salviati, he collected the  scattered pieces, and brought them to the house of Michelangelo  Salviati, the father of Cecchino. They were subsequently put together  by the care of the Grand Duke Cosimo, and restored to the statue in  the year 1543.      III    In the David Michelangelo first displayed that quality of  _terribilita_, of spirit-quailing, awe-inspiring force, for which he  afterwards became so famous. The statue imposes, not merely by its  size and majesty and might, but by something vehement in the  conception. He was, however, far from having yet adopted those  systematic proportions for the human body which later on gave an air  of monotonous impressiveness to all his figures. On the contrary, this  young giant strongly recalls the model; still more strongly indeed  than the Bacchus did. Wishing perhaps to adhere strictly to the  Biblical story, Michelangelo studied a lad whose frame was not  developed. The David, to state the matter frankly, is a colossal  hobbledehoy. His body, in breadth of the thorax, depth of the abdomen,  and general stoutness, has not grown up to the scale of the enormous  hands and feet and heavy head. We feel that he wants at least two  years to become a fully developed man, passing from adolescence to the  maturity of strength and beauty. This close observance of the  imperfections of the model at a certain stage of physical growth is  very remarkable, and not altogether pleasing in a statue more than  nine feet high. Both Donatello and Verocchio had treated their Davids  in the same realistic manner, but they were working on a small scale  and in bronze. I insist upon this point, because students of  Michelangelo have been apt to overlook his extreme sincerity and  naturalism in the first stages of his career.    Having acknowledged that the head of David is too massive and the  extremities too largely formed for ideal beauty, hypercriticism can  hardly find fault with the modelling and execution of each part. The  attitude selected is one of great dignity and vigour. The heroic boy,  quite certain of victory, is excited by the coming contest. His brows  are violently contracted, the nostrils tense and quivering, the eyes  fixed keenly on the distant Philistine. His larynx rises visibly, and  the sinews of his left thigh tighten, as though the whole spirit of  the man were braced for a supreme endeavour. In his right hand, kept  at a just middle point between the hip and knee, he holds the piece of  wood on which his sling is hung. The sling runs round his back, and  the centre of it, where the stone bulges, is held with the left hand,  poised upon the left shoulder, ready to be loosed. We feel that the  next movement will involve the right hand straining to its full extent  the sling, dragging the stone away, and whirling it into the air;  when, after it has sped to strike Goliath in the forehead, the whole  lithe body of the lad will have described a curve, and recovered its  perpendicular position on the two firm legs. Michelangelo invariably  chose some decisive moment; in the action he had to represent; and  though he was working here under difficulties, owing to the  limitations of the damaged block at his disposal, he contrived to  suggest the imminence of swift and sudden energy which shall disturb  the equilibrium of his young giant's pose. Critics of this statue,  deceived by its superficial resemblance to some Greek athletes at  rest, have neglected the candid realism of the momentary act  foreshadowed.

By the way, you never guessed  that simple little puzzle as to how I found that this _was_ a murder, did  you? You see it now, of course?\"    \"Something to do with that apple you stole, I suppose?\"    \"Something to do with it? I should think so, you worthy innocent. Just  ring your bell; we'll borrow Mrs. Clayton's sewing-machine oil again. On  the night we broke into Foggatt's room you saw the nutshells and the  bitten remains of an apple on the sideboard, and you remembered it; and  yet you couldn't see that in that piece of apple possibly lay an important  piece of evidence. Of course I never expected you to have arrived at any  conclusion, as I had, because I had ten minutes in which to examine that  apple, and to do what I did with it. But, at least, you should have seen  the possibility of evidence in it.    \"First, now, the apple was white. A bitten apple, as you must have  observed, turns of a reddish brown color if left to stand long. Different  kinds of apples brown with different rapidities, and the browning always  begins at the core. This is one of the twenty thousand tiny things that  few people take the trouble to notice, but which it is useful for a man in  my position to know. A russet will brown quite quickly. The apple on the  sideboard was, as near as I could tell, a Newtown pippin or other apple of  that kind, which will brown at the core in from twenty minutes to half an  hour, and in other parts in a quarter of an hour more. When we saw it, it  was white, with barely a tinge of brown about the exposed core. Inference,  somebody had been eating it fifteen or twenty minutes before, perhaps a  little longer--an inference supported by the fact that it was only partly  eaten.    \"I examined that apple, and found it bore marks of very irregular teeth.  While you were gone, I oiled it over, and, rushing down to my rooms, where  I always have a little plaster of Paris handy for such work, took a mold  of the part where the teeth had left the clearest marks. I then returned  the apple to its place for the police to use if they thought fit. Looking  at my mold, it was plain that the person who had bitten that apple had  lost two teeth, one at top and one below, not exactly opposite, but nearly  so. The other teeth, although they would appear to have been fairly sound,  were irregular in size and line. Now, the dead man had, as I saw, a very  excellent set of false teeth, regular and sharp, with none missing.  Therefore it was plain that somebody _else_ had been eating that apple. Do  I make myself clear?\"    \"Quite! Go on!\"    \"There were other inferences to be made--slighter, but all pointing the  same way. For instance, a man of Foggatt's age does not, as a rule, munch  an unpeeled apple like a school-boy. Inference, a young man, and healthy.  Why I came to the conclusion that he was tall, active, a gymnast, and  perhaps a sailor, I have already told you, when we examined the outside of  Foggatt's window. It was also pretty clear that robbery was not the  motive, since nothing was disturbed, and that a friendly conversation had  preceded the murder--witness the drinking and the eating of the apple.  Whether or not the police noticed these things I can't say. If they had  had their best men on, they certainly would, I think; but the case, to a  rough observer, looked so clearly one of accident or suicide that possibly  they didn't.    \"As I said, after the inquest I was unable to devote any immediate time to  the case, but I resolved to keep my eyes open. The man to look for was  tall, young, strong and active, with a very irregular set of teeth, a  tooth missing from the lower jaw just to the left of the center, and  another from the upper jaw a little farther still toward the left. He  might possibly be a person I had seen about the premises (I have a good  memory for faces), or, of course, he possibly might not.    \"Just before you returned from your holiday I noticed a young man at  Luzatti's whom I remembered to have seen somewhere about the offices in  this building. He was tall, young, and so on, but I had a client with me,  and was unable to examine him more narrowly; indeed, as I was not exactly  engaged on the case, and as there are several tall young men about, I took  little trouble. But to-day, finding the same young man with a vacant seat  opposite him, I took the opportunity of making a closer acquaintance.\"    \"You certainly managed to draw him out.\"    \"Oh, yes; the easiest person in the world to draw out is a cyclist. The  easiest cyclist to draw out is, of course, the novice, but the next  easiest is the veteran. When you see a healthy, well-trained-looking man,  who, nevertheless, has a slight stoop in the shoulders, and, maybe, a  medal on his watch-guard, it is always a safe card to try him first with a  little cycle-racing talk. I soon brought Mr. Mason out of his shell, read  his name on his medal, and had a chance of observing his teeth--indeed, he  spoke of them himself. Now, as I observed just now, there are several  tall, athletic young men about, and also there are several men who have  lost teeth. But now I saw that this tall and athletic young man had lost  exactly _two_ teeth--one from the lower jaw, just to the left of the  center, and another from the upper jaw, farther still toward the left!  Trivialities, pointing in the same direction, became important  considerations. More, his teeth were irregular throughout, and, as nearly  as I could remember it, looked remarkably like this little plaster mold of  mine.\"    He produced from his pocket an irregular lump of plaster, about three  inches long. On one side of this appeared in relief the likeness of two  irregular rows of six or eight teeth, minus one in each row, where a deep  gap was seen, in the position spoken of by my friend. He proceeded:    \"This was enough at least to set me after this young man. But he gave me  the greatest chance of all when he turned and left his apple (eaten  unpeeled, remember!--another important triviality) on his plate. I'm  afraid I wasn't at all polite, and I ran the risk of arousing his  suspicions, but I couldn't resist the temptation to steal it. I did, as  you saw, and here it is.\"    He brought the apple from his coat-pocket. One bitten side, placed against  the upper half of the mold, fitted precisely, a projection of apple  filling exactly the deep gap. The other side similarly fitted the lower  half.    \"There's no getting behind that, you see,\" Hewitt remarked. \"Merely  observing the man's teeth was a guide, to some extent, but this is as  plain as his signature or his thumb impression. You'll never find two men  _bite_ exactly alike, no matter whether they leave distinct teeth-marks or  not. Here, by the by, is Mrs. Clayton's oil. We'll take another mold from  this apple, and compare _them_.\"    He oiled the apple, heaped a little plaster in a newspaper, took my  water-jug, and rapidly pulled off a hard mold. The parts corresponding to  the merely broken places in the apple were, of course, dissimilar; but as  to the teeth-marks, the impressions were identical.    \"That will do, I think,\" Hewitt said. \"Tomorrow morning, Brett, I shall  put up these things in a small parcel, and take them round to Bow Street.\"    \"But are they sufficient evidence?\"    \"Quite sufficient for the police purpose. There is the man, and all the  rest--his movements on the day and so forth--are simple matters of  inquiry; at any rate, that is police business.\"           *       *       *       *       *    I had scarcely sat down to my breakfast on the following morning when  Hewitt came into the room and put a long letter before me.    \"From our friend of last night,\" he said; \"read it.\"    This letter began abruptly, and undated, and was as follows:      \"TO MARTIN HEWITT, ESQ.    \"SIR: I must compliment you on the adroitness you exhibited this evening  in extracting from me my name. The address I was able to balk you of for  the time being, although by the time you read this you will probably have  found it through the _Law List_, as I am an admitted solicitor. That,  however, will be of little use to you, for I am removing myself, I think,  beyond the reach even of your abilities of search. I knew you well by  sight, and was, perhaps, foolish to allow myself to be drawn as I did.  Still, I had no idea that it would be dangerous, especially after seeing  you, as a witness with very little to say, at the inquest upon the  scoundrel I shot. Your somewhat discourteous seizure of my apple at first  amazed me--indeed, I was a little doubtful as to whether you had really  taken it--but it was my first warning that you might be playing a deep  game against me, incomprehensible as the action was to my mind. I  subsequently reflected that I had been eating an apple, instead of taking  the drink he first offered me, in the dead wretch's rooms on the night he  came to his merited end. From this I assume that your design was in some  way to compare what remained of the two apples--although I do not presume  to fathom the depths of your detective system. Still, I have heard of many  of your cases, and profoundly admire the keenness you exhibit. I am  thought to be a keen man myself, but, although I was able, to some extent,  to hold my own to-night, I admit that your acumen in this case alone is  something beyond me.    \"I do not know by whom you are commissioned to hunt me, nor to what extent  you may be acquainted with my connection with the creature I killed. I  have sufficient respect for you, however, to wish that you should not  regard me as a vicious criminal, and a couple of hours to spare in which  to offer you an explanation that will convince you that such is not  altogether the case. A hasty and violent temper I admit possessing; but  even now I can not forget the one"]]]
