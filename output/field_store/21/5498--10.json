The first were their various residences and  outposts, and the second their grand fastness and safe retreat.    They had so long held the Swamp and felt it to be their very own in  every part and suburb--including Olifant's grounds and buildings--that  they would have resented the appearance of another rabbit even about the  adjoining barnyard.    Their claim, that of long, successful occupancy, was exactly the same as  that by which most nations hold their land, and it would be hard to find  a better right.    During the time of the January thaw the Olifants had cut the rest of the  large wood about the pond and curtailed the Cottontails' domain on all  sides. But they still clung to the dwindling Swamp, for it was their  home and they were loath to move to foreign parts. Their life of daily  perils went on, but they were still fleet of foot, long of wind, and  bright of wit. Of late they had been somewhat troubled by a mink that  had wandered up-stream to their quiet nook. A little judicious guidance  had transferred the uncomfortable visitor to Olifant's hen-house. But  they were not yet quite sure that he had been properly looked after. So  for the present they gave up using the ground-holes, which were, of  course, dangerous blind-alleys, and stuck closer than ever to the briers  and the brush-piles that were left.    That first snow had quite gone and the weather was bright and warm until  now. Molly, feeling a touch of rheumatism, was somewhere in the lower  thicket seeking a tea-berry tonic. Rag was sitting in the weak sunlight  on a bank in the east side. The smoke from the familiar gable chimney of  Olifant's house came fitfully drifting a pale blue haze through the  under-woods and showing as a dull brown against the brightness of the  sky. The sun-gilt gable was cut off midway by the banks of brier-brush,  that purple in shadow shone like rods of blazing crimson and gold in the  light. Beyond the house the barn with its gable and roof, new gilt as  the house, stood up like a Noah's ark.    The sounds that came from it, and yet more the delicious smell that  mingled with the smoke, told Rag that the animals were being fed cabbage  in the yard. Rag's mouth watered at the idea of the feast. He blinked  and blinked as he snuffed its odorous promises, for he loved cabbage  dearly. But then he had been to the barnyard the night before after a  few paltry clover-tops, and no wise rabbit would go two nights running  to the same place.    Therefore he did the wise thing. He moved across where he could not  smell the cabbage and made his supper of a bundle of hay that had been  blown from the stack. Later, when about to settle for the night, he was  joined by Molly, who had taken her tea-berry and then eaten her frugal  meal of sweet birch near the Sunning Bank.    Meanwhile the sun had gone about his business elsewhere, taking all his  gold and glory with him. Off in the east a big black shutter came  pushing up and rising higher and higher; it spread over the whole sky,  shut out all light, and left the world a very gloomy place indeed. Then  another mischief-maker, the wind, taking advantage of the sun's absence,  came on the scene and set about brewing trouble. The weather turned  colder and colder; it seemed worse than when the ground had been covered  with snow.    \"Isn't this terribly cold? How I wish we had our stove-pipe brush-pile,\"  said Rag.    \"A good night for the pine-root hole,\" replied Molly, \"but we have not  yet seen the pelt of that mink on the end of the barn, and it is not  safe till we do.\"    The hollow hickory was gone--in fact at this very moment its trunk,  lying in the wood-yard, was harboring the mink they feared. So the  Cottontails hopped to the south side of the pond and, choosing a  brush-pile, they crept under and snuggled down for the night, facing the  wind but with their noses in different directions so as to go out  different ways in case of alarm. The wind blew harder and colder as the  hours went by, and about midnight a fine, icy snow came ticking down on  the dead leaves and hissing through the brush heap. It might seem a poor  night for hunting, but that old fox from Springfield was out. He came  pointing up the wind in the shelter of the Swamp and chanced in the lee  of the brush-pile, where he scented the sleeping Cottontails. He halted  for a moment, then came stealthily sneaking up toward the brush under  which his nose told him the rabbits were crouching. The noise of the  wind and the sleet enabled him to come quite close before Molly heard  the faint crunch of a dry leaf under his paw. She touched Rag's  whiskers, and both were fully awake just as the fox sprang on them; but  they always slept with their legs ready for a jump. Molly darted out  into the blinding storm. The fox missed his spring, but followed like a  racer, while Rag dashed off to one side.    There was only one road for Molly; that was straight up the wind, and  bounding for her life she gained a little over the unfrozen mud that  would not carry the fox, till she reached the margin of the pond. No  chance to turn now, on she must go.    Splash! splash! through the weeds she went, then plunge into the deep  water.    And plunge went the fox close behind. But it was too much for Reynard on  such a night. He turned back, and Molly, seeing only one course,  struggled through the reeds into the deep water and struck out for the  other shore. But there was a strong headwind. The little waves, icy  cold, broke over her head as she swam, and the water was full of snow  that blocked her way like soft ice, or floating mud. The dark line of  the other shore seemed far, far away, with perhaps the fox waiting for  her there.    But she laid her ears flat to be out of the gale, and bravely put forth  all her strength with wind and tide against her. After a long, weary  swim in the cold water, she had nearly reached the farther reeds when a  great mass of floating snow barred her road; then the wind on the bank  made strange, fox-like sounds that robbed her of all force, and she was  drifted far backward before she could get free from the floating bar.    Again she struck out, but slowly--oh so slowly now. And when at last she  reached the lee of the tall reeds, her limbs were numbed, her strength  spent, her brave little heart was sinking, and she cared no more whether  the fox were there or not. Through the reeds she did indeed pass, but  once in the weeds her course wavered and slowed, her feeble strokes no  longer sent her landward, and the ice forming around her, stopped her  altogether. In a little while the cold, weak limbs ceased to move, the  furry nose-tip of the little mother Cottontail wobbled no more, and the  soft brown eyes were closed in death.           *       *       *       *       *    But there was no fox waiting to tear her with ravenous jaws. Rag had  escaped the first onset of the foe, and as soon as he regained his wits  he came running back to change-off and so help his mother. He met the  old fox going round the pond to meet Molly and led him far and away,  then dismissed him with a barbed-wire gash on his head, and came to the  bank and sought about and trailed and thumped, but all his searching was  in vain; he could not find his little mother. He never saw her again,  and never knew whither she went, for she slept her never-waking sleep in  the ice-arms of her friend the Water that tells no tales.    Poor little Molly Cottontail! She was a true heroine, yet only one of  unnumbered millions that without a thought of heroism have lived and  done their best in their little world, and died. She fought a good fight  in the battle of life. She was good stuff; the stuff that never dies.  For flesh of her flesh and brain of her brain was Rag. She lives in him,  and through him transmits a finer fibre to her race.    And Rag still lives in the Swamp. Old Olifant died that winter, and the  unthrifty sons ceased to clear the Swamp or mend the wire fences. Within  a single year it was a wilder place than ever; fresh trees and brambles  grew, and falling wires made many Cottontail castles and last retreats  that dogs and foxes dared not storm. And there to this day lives Rag. He  is a big, strong buck now and fears no rivals. He has a large family of  his own, and a pretty brown wife that he got no one knows where. There,  no doubt, he and his children's children will flourish for many years  to come, and there you may see them any sunny evening if you have learnt  their signal code, and choosing a good spot on the ground, know just how  and when to thump it.          VIXEN    THE SPRINGFIELD FOX    I      The hens had been mysteriously disappearing for over a month; and when I  came home to Springfield for the summer holidays it was my duty to find  the cause. This was soon done. The fowls were carried away bodily one at  a time, before going to roost, or else after leaving, which put tramps  and neighbors out of court; they were not taken from the high perches,  which cleared all coons and owls; or left partly eaten, so that weasels,  skunks, or minks were not the guilty ones, and the blame, therefore, was  surely left at Reynard's door.    The great pine wood of Erindale was on the other bank of the river, and  on looking carefully about the lower ford I saw a few fox-tracks and a  barred feather from one of our Plymouth Rock chickens. On climbing the  farther bank in search of more clews, I heard a great outcry of crows  behind me, and turning, saw a number of these birds darting down at  something in the ford. A better view showed that it was the old story,  thief catch thief, for there in the middle of the ford was a fox with  something in his jaws--he was returning from our barnyard with another  hen. The crows, though shameless robbers themselves, are ever first to  cry 'Stop thief,' and yet more than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14241"],[0,"More English Fairy Tales (#13)"],[1,"could not hear any one. So upstairs he went, and he found a great  room with three beds in it; one was a big bed, and one was a middling  bed, and one was a little white bed; and he climbed up into the big bed,  but it was so hard and lumpy and uncomfortable that he jumped down again  at once, and tried the middling bed. That was rather better, but he  could not get comfortably in it, so after turning about a little while  he got up and went to the little bed; and that was so soft and so warm  and so nice that he fell fast asleep at once.    And after a time the Bears came home, and when they got into the hall  the big Bear went to his chair and said, \"WHO'S BEEN SITTING IN MY  CHAIR?\" and the middling Bear said, \"WHO'S BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR?\"  and the little Bear said, \"_Who's been sitting in my chair and has  broken it all to pieces?_\" And then they went to have their milk, and  the big Bear said, \"WHO'S BEEN DRINKING MY MILK?\" and the middling Bear  said, \"WHO'S BEEN DRINKING MY MILK?\" and the little Bear said, \"_Who's  been drinking my milk and has drunk it all up?_\" Then they went upstairs  and into the bedroom, and the big Bear said, \"WHO'S BEEN SLEEPING IN MY  BED?\" and the middling Bear said, \"WHO'S BEEN SLEEPING IN MY BED?\" and  the little Bear said, \"_Who's been sleeping in my bed?--and see here he  is!_\" So then the Bears came and wondered what they should do with him;  and the big Bear said, \"Let's hang him!\" and then the middling Bear  said, \"Let's drown him!\" and then the little Bear said, \"Let's throw him  out of the window.\" And then the Bears took him to the window, and the  big Bear took two legs on one side and the middling Bear took two legs  on the other side, and they swung him backwards and forwards, backwards  and forwards, and out of the window. Poor Scrapefoot was so frightened,  and he thought every bone in his body must be broken. But he got up and  first shook one leg--no, that was not broken; and then another, and that  was not broken; and another and another, and then he wagged his tail and  found there were no bones broken. So then he galloped off home as fast  as he could go, and never went near the Bears' Castle again.          The Pedlar of Swaffham      In the old days when London Bridge was lined with shops from one end to  the other, and salmon swam under the arches, there lived at Swaffham, in  Norfolk, a poor pedlar. He'd much ado to make his living, trudging about  with his pack at his back and his dog at his heels, and at the close of  the day's labour was but too glad to sit down and sleep. Now it fell out  that one night he dreamed a dream, and therein he saw the great bridge  of London town, and it sounded in his ears that if he went there he  should hear joyful news. He made little count of the dream, but on the  following night it come back to him, and again on the third night.    Then he said within himself, \"I must needs try the issue of it,\" and so  he trudged up to London town. Long was the way and right glad was he  when he stood on the great bridge and saw the tall houses on right hand  and left, and had glimpses of the water running and the ships sailing  by. All day long he paced to and fro, but he heard nothing that might  yield him comfort. And again on the morrow he stood and he gazed--he  paced afresh the length of London Bridge, but naught did he see and  naught did he hear.    Now the third day being come as he still stood and gazed, a shopkeeper  hard by spoke to him.    \"Friend,\" said he, \"I wonder much at your fruitless standing. Have you  no wares to sell?\"    \"No, indeed,\" quoth the pedlar.    \"And you do not beg for alms.\"    \"Not so long as I can keep myself.\"    \"Then what, I pray thee, dost thou want here, and what may thy business  be?\"    \"Well, kind sir, to tell the truth, I dreamed that if I came hither, I  should hear good news.\"    Right heartily did the shopkeeper laugh.    \"Nay, thou must be a fool to take a journey on such a silly errand. I'll  tell thee, poor silly country fellow, that I myself dream too o' nights,  and that last night I dreamt myself to be in Swaffham, a place clean  unknown to me, but in Norfolk if I mistake not, and methought I was in  an orchard behind a pedlar's house, and in that orchard was a great  oak-tree. Then meseemed that if I digged I should find beneath that tree  a great treasure. But think you I'm such a fool as to take on me a long  and wearisome journey and all for a silly dream. No, my good fellow,  learn wit from a wiser man than thyself. Get thee home, and mind thy  business.\"    When the pedlar heard this he spoke no word, but was exceeding glad in  himself, and returning home speedily, digged underneath the great  oak-tree, and found a prodigious great treasure. He grew exceeding rich,  but he did not forget his duty in the pride of his riches. For he built  up again the church at Swaffham, and when he died they put a statue of  him therein all in stone with his pack at his back and his dog at his  heels. And there it stands to this day to witness if I lie.          The Old Witch      Once upon a time there were two girls who lived with their mother and  father. Their father had no work, and the girls wanted to go away and  seek their fortunes. Now one girl wanted to go to service, and her  mother said she might if she could find a place. So she started for the  town. Well, she went all about the town, but no one wanted a girl like  her. So she went on farther into the country, and she came to the place  where there was an oven where there was lots of bread baking. And the  bread said, \"Little girl, little girl, take us out, take us out. We have  been baking seven years, and no one has come to take us out.\" So the  girl took out the bread, laid it on the ground, and went on her way.  Then she met a cow, and the cow said, \"Little girl, little girl, milk  me, milk me! Seven years have I been waiting, and no one has come to  milk me.\" The girl milked the cow into the pails that stood by. As she  was thirsty she drank some, and left the rest in the pails by the cow.  Then she went on a little bit farther, and came to an apple tree, so  loaded with fruit that its branches were breaking down, and the tree  said, \"Little girl, little girl, help me shake my fruit. My branches are  breaking, it is so heavy.\" And the girl said, \"Of course I will, you  poor tree.\" So she shook the fruit all off, propped up the branches, and  left the fruit on the ground under the tree. Then she went on again till  she came to a house. Now in this house there lived a witch, and this  witch took girls into her house as servants. And when she heard that  this girl had left her home to seek service, she said that she would try  her, and give her good wages. The witch told the girl what work she was  to do. \"You must keep the house clean and tidy, sweep the floor and the  fireplace; but there is one thing you must never do. You must never look  up the chimney, or something bad will befall you.\"    So the girl promised to do as she was told, but one morning as she was  cleaning, and the witch was out, she forgot what the witch said, and  looked up the chimney. When she did this a great bag of money fell down  in her lap. This happened again and again. So the girl started to go off  home.    When she had gone some way she heard the witch coming after her. So she  ran to the apple tree and cried:         \"Apple-tree, apple-tree hide me,        So the old witch can't find me;        If she does she'll pick my bones,        And bury me under the marble stones.\"    So the apple-tree hid her. When the witch came up she said:    [Illustration:         \"Tree of mine, tree of mine,        Have you seen a girl        With a willy-willy wag, and a long-tailed bag,        Who's stole my money, all I had?\"]         \"Tree of mine, tree of mine,        Have you seen a girl        With a willy-willy wag, and a long-tailed bag,        Who's stole my money, all I had?\"    And the apple-tree said, \"No, mother; not for seven year.\"    When the witch had gone down another way, the girl went on again, and  just as she got to the cow heard the witch coming after her again, so  she ran to the cow and cried:         \"Cow, cow, hide me,        So the old witch can't find me;        If she does she'll pick my bones,        And bury me under the marble stones.\"    So the cow hid her.    When the old witch came up, she looked about and said to the cow:         \"Cow of mine, cow of mine,        Have you seen a girl        With a willy-willy wag, and a long-tailed bag,        Who's stole my money, all I had?\"    And the cow said, \"No, mother, not for seven year.\"    When the witch had gone off another way, the little girl went on again,  and when she was near the oven she heard the witch coming after her  again, so she ran to the oven and cried:         \"Oven, oven, hide me,        So the old witch can't find me;        If she does she'll break my bones,        And bury me under the marble stones.\"    And the oven said, \"I've no room, ask the baker,\" and the baker hid her  behind the oven.    When the witch came up she looked here and there and everywhere, and  then said to the baker:         \"Man of mine, man of mine,        Have you seen a girl,        With a willy-willy wag, and a long-tailed bag,        Who's stole my money, all I had?\"    So the baker said, \"Look in the oven.\" The old witch went to look, and  the oven said, \"Get in and look in the furthest corner.\" The witch did  so, and when she was inside the oven shut her door, and the witch was  kept there for a very long time.    The girl then went off again, and reached her home with her money bags,  married a rich man, and lived happy ever afterwards.    The other sister then thought she would go and do the same. And she went  the same way. But when she reached the oven, and the bread said, \"Little  girl, little girl, take us out. Seven years have we been baking, and no  one has come"]]]
