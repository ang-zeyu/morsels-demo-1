The flying sparks of the torch burnt him badly in  several places, but he did not much mind this, and he dared not stop to  dress his wounds for fear that his pursuers would yet overtake him.    \"Fortunately he succeeded in reaching his distant home. There at the shore  to welcome his return was Nokomis, who had been full of anxiety about him.  She carefully dressed his burnt face and hands and gladly received the gift  of the fire, which has been such a blessing to the Indians ever since.    \"At first there was a good deal of trouble among the Indians to keep the  fire burning. Sometimes the watchers appointed to look after it, especially  in the summer months, would forget to add fresh fuel, or would go to sleep  and neglect it. Then they would have to send off to some perhaps distant  wigwam, where the people had been more careful, and secure some live coals  from them.    \"Nanahboozhoo was troubled about this. He feared that if it were allowed to  die out at the same time in all of the wigwams he might not be so  successful again if he had to try to get a fresh supply from the fierce old  man and his now wrathful daughters. So he went out into the woods and at  length a good spirit came to him in a dream and told him of various ways in  which the fire could be obtained. He showed him how it could be made, by  rapid friction, with dry sticks. Another way he revealed to him was by the  striking together of a flint stone and a piece of iron; sparks of fire  could thus be produced which, caught in punk, would soon become a blaze. So  now the Indians do not have to cover up the fires as they were formerly  obliged to do; thanks to Nanahboozhoo's dreams, they can make it fresh  whenever they want it.\"    \"Hurrah for Nanahboozhoo for his good work this time!\" said Sagastao.    \"Well, I think he was a mean fellow, to so fool those two nice girls who  took him in and warmed him when he was a poor little wet shivering rabbit!\"  said Minnehaha.    \"Took him in?\" the lad retorted. \"Well, I guess it was well he was able to  take them in as he did, by setting fire to that old grass in the meadow,  for if he had not done so they would soon have had his scalp.\"    But here Minnehaha appealed to Souwanas, and said:    \"I have been wondering how it was the old man and his daughters got the  fire in the first place from out of the underground. Will you not tell us  that story some time?\"    The old man looked grave and was silent for a minute or two, then he  replied:    \"I think you had better ask Kinnesasis. He knows the story better than I  do, for in his youth he traveled far West, into the land of the high  mountains, where the legend is that the fire was stolen out of the center  of the earth.\"    \"All right. Thank you, Souwanas. We are going to take Kinnesasis some  presents, and while there we will ask him for the story.\"    Here an Indian lad rushed into the wigwam with the word that Kennedy was  coming with their cariole. The children were well wrapped up, and soon with  their usual happy, \"Wat cheer! Wat cheer!\" they were speeding homeward.          CHAPTER IX.      Kinnesasis--How the Coyote Obtained the Fire from the  Interior of the Earth.    A great time the children had in the wigwam of Kinnesasis. He was such a  jolly little old Indian, and he was specially happy to-day when the  children opened out the gifts and presented them. He was more than  delighted with a suit of black clothes sent him from a distance by friends  who had heard about him and his needs. He quickly put on the whole suit,  which fitted him very nicely, and then much amused the children by saying:    \"I am sure the man who made these clothes is in heaven, or, if not yet  dead, he will go to heaven when he dies.\"    \"Why, Kinnesasis, it is the kind friends who sent you these clothes you  ought to thank, and not make such a fuss over the man who made them; he was  paid for making them,\" said Sagastao. But Kinnesasis could only think of  the man who made the suit of which he was so proud.    Kinnesasis's old wife was, if possible, still more delighted with her  presents than the old man with his. She and Minnehaha were always the best  of friends, and now as the child handed her gift after gift of warm  clothing and food her joy knew no bounds, and, old as she was, when some  warm shoes were given her, she sprang up and began singing an Indian song,  while with all the agility of a young maiden she spun around the wigwam in  rhythmic measure to her words, which, roughly translated, are as follows:      \"The Good Spirit has pity on me,    Though for days I had little to eat,    I was wretched and sad in my heart,    I was cold, O so cold! in my feet.      \"But now I have plenty of meat,    Clothes for my body, shoes for my feet,    I'll not grumble, nor sorrow, but praise    The Good Spirit the rest of my days.\"    \"Well done!\" shouted the children when the old woman stopped. They were  greatly delighted with her performance. Kinnesasis, however, who, as well  as his wife, was now a church member, professed to be much shocked at  seeing her thus dancing, as though in the wild excitement of the Ghost  Dance. But both Sagastao and Minnehaha stood up for the old wife. They said  the words she sang were good enough for the church, any day, and they were  sure nobody could find fault with her thus showing how glad and thankful  she was.    And nobody ever did find fault and soon was the affair almost forgotten,  for now the merry jingling of more dog bells was heard, and who should come  into the wigwam of Kinnesasis but the parents of Sagastao and Minnehaha!    Cordially were they greeted. At first it was difficult for them to  recognize the staid little gentleman in his full suit of broadcloth as the  lively but generally ill-clothed Kinnesasis. The visitors--who quickly saw  and were delighted with the transformation--greeted him as though he were  some distinguished stranger. This vastly amused the children. Screaming  with laughter at Kinnesasis's pretense of keeping up the farce, they  shouted out, \"Why, this is only our dear old Kinnesasis. He is no great  stranger. It is only Kinnesasis with his new clothes.\"    \"Well,\" then was asked, \"who is that charming old lady over there with such  a fine shawl and brilliant handkerchief on, and such fancy new shoes on her  feet? Surely she is a stranger.\"    \"No! No!\" the children again shouted. \"Why, that is Kinnesasis's wife, with  her new presents on! My! doesn't she look nice!\"    Here the little ones seized hold of the happy old Indian woman and made her  get up and show herself off in her new apparel, of which she was just as  proud as Kinnesasis.    \"And she gave us such a jolly dance in them, papa! Wouldn't you like to see  her do it again?\" cried Minnehaha.    But here Kinnesasis, pretending to be shocked beyond measure, in a most  diplomatic manner directed the attention of the parents to some other  matter, and so the mischievous child did not succeed in making a church  scandal by inducing one of the flock to dance before the missionary.    \"Tell us, Kinnesasis,\" said Sagastao, \"how it was that that old man and his  daughters first obtained the fire which Nanahboozhoo so cleverly stole from  them and gave to the Indians long ago.\"    At first Kinnesasis hesitated about telling the old legend, saying that he  did not think the father and mother of the children would care for such  stories.    \"Don't they, though!\" cried the children. \"You don't know them very well,  then, if you don't know that they like stories just about as well as we  do.\"    And with this they at once appealed to the parents, who of course sided  with them and expressed their desire to listen to this story that the  children had told them they were to hear from dear old Kinnesasis.    Throwing some more logs on the fire, around which the white visitors with  the Indians gathered, Kinnesasis began:    \"It was long ago, when I was a young lad, that I heard the story from the  old story-tellers of our people. I had traveled with my father for many  days far toward the setting sun. We reached the land of the great  mountains, and there, with our people of those regions, we spent some  moons. It was while we were among them that I heard from the ancient  story-teller the legend of how the fire was stolen from the center of the  earth, where it was kept hidden away from the human family.    \"That there was such a thing as fire was well known. It had been seen  bursting out of the tops of distant mountains, and there had been times in  great thunderstorms, when the lightning had set fire to dead trees--and  indeed in this latter way the Indians had become acquainted with its value  to the human race. But they had not taken care to keep it burning, and no  one had been appointed to specially look after it.    \"The reason why fire had not been from the first given to men was because  when the race was created the fire was not much needed. The earth was then  much warmer than it is now. There was no snow or ice ever seen except on  the tops of the very highest mountains. Great animals now all dead, and  others that could only live in the hottest countries, lived all over these  great lands. Then there was abundance of fruit and nuts and roots that were  all very good for food. Then some great disaster happened to the world and  soon it began to grow colder and many animals, and even families, perished.  Snow and ice appeared where they were never seen before. There was great  suffering from the cold. The hunters began to kill the animals for food.

But Wilbur  learning of Orvilles disaster, and reproached as far behind him, rose to  the situation, and in a few days, was ahead of anything Orville had  done, to the great joy of his brother. The rest you know. Wilbur in  France and Rome earned his conracts, and came home with Orville and  their Sister Katharine, and they were hailed at the depot of his city,  with the ringing of bells, the firing of cannon, and by over a thousand  people, and the same at home, at the noon hour, and at night more than  ten thousand people came out as old friends and neighbors to see them,  the most splendid illumination of the street, and decoration of the  buildings for three squares, being the order of the occasion. The city  brought them on their arrival, home in a train of coaches, thier  carriage being drawn with four white horses, in which rode with them  their father and two favorite grandchildren, Leontine and Horace Wright.    The boys were natural workmen in wood or metal. Their father's family,  their mother's family (and the mother herself) were inventive and  ingenius. The father at eighteen years invented a type-writer, having  never heard. It is useless to develop inheritance in their invention.
