But--Paul\"--and the voice becomes still softer--\"it is a bit  better for _others_' sake that it remain: the plan in My heart _through  you_ for thousands, yes, unnumbered thousands, Paul, can so best be worked  out.\" That was the first part of what He said. And Paul lies thinking with  a deep tinge of awe over his spirit. Then after a bit in yet quieter voice  He went on to say, \"I will be so close to your side; you shall have such  revelations of My glory that the pain will be clear overlapped, Paul; the  glory shall outstrip the eating thorn point.\"    I can see old Paul one night in his own hired house in Rome. It is late,  after a busy day; the auditors have all gone. He is sitting on an old  bench, slowing down before seeking sleep. One arm is around Luke, dear  faithful Doctor Luke, and the other around young Timothy, not quite so  young now. And with eyes that glisten, and utterance tremulous with  emotion he is just saying:--\"And dear old friends, do you know, I would  not have missed this thorn, for the wondrous glory\"--and his heart gets  into his voice, there is a touch of the hoarseness of deep emotion, and a  quavering of tone, so he waits a moment--\"the wondrous _glory-presence of  Jesus_ that came with it.\"    And so out of the experience came a double blessing. There was a much  fuller working of God's plan for His poor befooled world. And there was an  unspeakable nearness of intimacy with his Lord for Paul. _The man was  answered and the petition denied that the larger plan of service might be  carried out_.        <u>Shaping a Prayer on the Anvil of the Knees.</u>      The last of these pictures is like Raphael's Sistine Madonna in the  Dresden gallery; it is in a room by itself. One enters with a holy hush  over his spirit, and, with awe in his eyes, looks at _Jesus in  Gethsemane_. There is the Kidron brook, the gentle rise of ground, the  grove of gnarled knotty old olive trees. The moon above is at the full.  Its brightness makes these shadowed recesses the darker; blackly dark.  Here is a group of men lying on the ground apparently asleep. Over yonder  deeper in among the trees a smaller group reclines motionless. They, too,  sleep. And, look, farther in yet is that lone figure; all alone; nevermore  alone; save once--on the morrow.    There is a foreshadowing of this Gethsemane experience in the requested  interview of the Greeks just a few intense days before. In the vision  which the Greeks unconsciously brought the agony of the olive grove began.  The climax is among these moon-shadowed trees. How sympathetic those inky  black shadows! It takes bright light to make black shadows. Yet they were  not black enough. Intense men can get so absorbed in the shadows as to  forget the light.    This great Jesus! Son of God: God the Son. The Son of Man: God--a man! No  draughtsman's pencil ever drew the line between His divinity and humanity;  nor ever shall. For the union of divine and human is itself divine, and  therefore clear beyond human ken. Here His humanity stands out,  pathetically, luminously stands out. Let us speak of it very softly and  think with the touch of awe deepening for this is holiest ground. The  battle of the morrow is being fought out here. Calvary is in Gethsemane.  The victory of the hill is won in the grove.    It is sheer impossible for man with sin grained into his fibre through  centuries to understand the horror with which a sinless one thinks of  actual contact with sin. As Jesus enters the grove that night it comes in  upon His spirit with terrific intensity that He is actually coming into  contact--with a meaning quite beyond us--coming into contact with sin. In  some way all too deep for definition He is to be \"made sin.\"[23] The  language used to describe His emotions is so strong that no adequate  English words seem available for its full expression. An indescribable  horror, a chill of terror, a frenzy of fright seizes Him. The poisonous  miasma of sin seems to be filling His nostrils and to be stifling Him. And  yonder alone among the trees the agony is upon Him. The extreme grips Him.  May there not yet possibly be some other way rather than _this--this!_ A  bit of that prayer comes to us in tones strangely altered by deepest  emotion. \"_If it be possible--let this cup pass_.\" There is still a  clinging to a possibility, some possibility other than that of this  nightmare vision. The writer of the Hebrews lets in light here. The strain  of spirit almost snaps the life-thread. And a parenthetical prayer for  strength goes up. And the angels come with sympathetic strengthening. With  what awe must they have ministered! Even after that some of the red life  slips out there under the trees. By and by a calmer mood asserts itself,  and out of the darkness a second petition comes. It tells of the tide's  turning, and the victory full and complete. _A changed, petition_ this!  \"_Since this cup may not pass_--since only thus _can_ Thy great plan for a  world be wrought out--_Thy--will_\"--slowly but very distinctly the words  come--\"_Thy--will--be--done._\"    _The changed prayer was wrought out upon His knees!_ With greatest  reverence, and a hush in our voices, let us say that there alone with the  Father came the clearer understanding of the Father's actual will under  these circumstances.        \"Into the woods my Master went      Clean forspent, forspent;      Into the woods my Master came      Forspent with love and shame.      But the olives they were not blind to Him,      The little gray leaves were kind to Him;      The thorn-tree had a mind to Him      When into the woods He came.        \"Out of the woods my Master went      And He was well content;      Out of the woods my Master came      Content with death and shame.      When death and shame would woo Him last      From under the trees they drew Him last      'Twas on a tree they slew Him--last      When out of the woods He came.\"[24]    True prayer is wrought out upon the knees alone with God. With deepest  reverence, and in awed tones, let it be said, that _that was true of  Jesus_ in the days of His humanity. How infinitely more of us!    Shall we not plan to meet God alone, habitually, with the door shut, and  the Book open, and the will pliant so we may be trained for this holy  partnership of prayer. Then will come the clearer vision, the broader  purpose, the truer wisdom, the real unselfishness, the simplicity of  claiming and expecting, the delights of fellowship in service with Him;  then too will come great victories for God in His world. Although we  shall not begin to know by direct knowledge a tithe of the story until the  night be gone and the dawning break and the ink-black shadows that now  stain the earth shall be chased away by the brightness of His presence.          The Great Outside Hindrance        <u>The Traitor Prince.</u>      There remains yet a word to be said about hindrances. It is a most  important word; indeed the climactic word. What has been said is simply  clearing the way for what is yet to be said. A very strange phase of  prayer must be considered here. Strange only because not familiar. Yet  though strange it contains the whole heart of the question. Here lies the  fight of the fight. One marvels that so little is said of it. For if there  were clear understanding here, and then faithful practicing, there would  be mightier defeats and victories: defeats for the foe; victories for our  rightful prince, Jesus.    The intense fact is this: _Satan has the power to hold the answer  back--for awhile; to delay the result--for a time_. He has not the power  to hold it back finally, _if_ some one understands and prays with quiet,  steady persistence. The real pitch of prayer therefore is Satanward.    Our generation has pretty much left this individual Satan out. It is  partly excusable perhaps. The conceptions of Satan and his hosts and  surroundings made classical by such as Dante and Milton and Dore have  done much to befog the air. Almost universally they have been taken  literally whether so meant or not. One familiar with Satan's  characteristics can easily imagine his cunning finger in that. He is  willing even to be caricatured, or to be left out of reckoning, if so he  may tighten his grip.    These suggestions of horns and hoofs, of forked tail and all the rest of  it seek to give material form to this being. They are grotesque to an  extreme, and therefore caricatures. A caricature so disproportions and  exaggerates as to make hideous or ridiculous. In our day when every  foundation of knowledge is being examined there has been a natural but  unthinking turning away from the very being of Satan through these  representations of him. Yet where there is a caricature there must be a  true. To revolt from the true, hidden by a caricature, in revolting from  the caricature is easy, but is certainly bad. It is always bad to have the  truth hid from our eyes.    It is refreshing and fascinating to turn from these classical caricatures  to the scriptural conception of Satan. In this Book he is a being of great  beauty of person, of great dignity of position even yet, endowed with most  remarkable intellectual powers, a prince, at the head of a most  remarkable, compact organization which he has wielded with phenomenal  skill and success in furthering his ambitious purposes.    And he is not chained yet. I remember a conversation with a young  clergyman one Monday morning in the reading-room of a Young Men's  Christian Association. It was in a certain mining town in the southwest,  which is as full of evil resorts as such places usually are. The day  before, Sunday, had been one of special services, and we had both been  busy and were a bit weary. We were slowing down and chatting leisurely. I  remarked to my friend, \"What a glad day it will be when the millennium  comes!\" He quickly replied, \"I think this is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13202"],[0,"\"Co. Aytch,\" Maury Grays, First Tennessee Regiment (#13)"],[1,"der,  and grabbed at my gun.  He divined my motive, and fired.  The ball missed  its aim.  He put spurs to his horse, but I pulled down on him, and almost  tore the fore shoulder of his horse entirely off, but I did not capture  the spy, though I captured the horse, bridle and saddle.  Major Allen,  of the Twenty-seventh Tennessee Regiment, took the saddle and bridle,  and gave me the blanket.  I remember the blanket had the picture of a  \"big lion\" on it, and it was almost new.  When we fell back, as the  Yankee sharpshooters advanced, we left the poor old horse nipping the  short, dry grass.  I saw a Yankee skirmisher run up and grab the horse  and give a whoop as if he had captured a Rebel horse.  But they continued  to advance upon us, we firing and retreating slowly.  We had several  pretty sharp brushes with them that day.  I remember that they had to  cross an open field in our front, and we were lying behind a fence,  and as they advanced, we kept up firing, and would run them back every  time, until they brought up a regiment that whooped, and yelled, and  charged our skirmish line, and then we fell back again.  I think we must  have killed a good many in the old field, because we were firing all the  time at the solid line as they advanced upon us.      BATTLE OF MURFREESBORO    The next day, the Yankees were found out to be advancing.  Soon they came  in sight of our picket.  We kept falling back and firing all day, and  were relieved by another regiment about dark.  We rejoined our regiment.  Line of battle was formed on the north bank of Stone's River--on the  Yankee side.  Bad generalship, I thought.    It was Christmas.  John Barleycorn was general-in-chief.  Our generals,  and colonels, and captains, had kissed John a little too often.  They  couldn't see straight.  It was said to be buckeye whisky.  They couldn't  tell our own men from Yankees.  The private could, but he was no general,  you see.  But here they were--the Yankees--a battle had to be fought.  We were ordered forward.  I was on the skirmish line.  We marched plumb  into the Yankee lines, with their flags flying.    I called Lieutenant-Colonel Frierson's attention to the Yankees, and he  remarked, \"Well, I don't know whether they are Yankees or not, but if  they are, they will come out of there mighty quick.\"    The Yankees marched over the hill out of sight.    We were ordered forward to the attack.  We were right upon the Yankee  line on the Wilkerson turnpike.  The Yankees were shooting our men down  by scores.  A universal cry was raised, \"You are firing on your own men.\"  \"Cease firing, cease firing,\" I hallooed; in fact, the whole skirmish  line hallooed, and kept on telling them that they were Yankees, and to  shoot; but the order was to cease firing, you are firing on your own men.    Captain James, of Cheatham's staff, was sent forward and killed in his  own yard.  We were not twenty yards off from the Yankees, and they were  pouring the hot shot and shells right into our ranks; and every man was  yelling at the top of his voice, \"Cease firing, you are firing on your  own men; cease firing, you are firing on your own men.\"    Oakley, color-bearer of the Fourth Tennessee Regiment, ran right up in  the midst of the Yankee line with his colors, begging his men to follow.  I hallooed till I was hoarse, \"They are Yankees, they are Yankees; shoot,  they are Yankees.\"    The crest occupied by the Yankees was belching loud with fire and smoke,  and the Rebels were falling like leaves of autumn in a hurricane.  The leaden hail storm swept them off the field.  They fell back and  re-formed.  General Cheatham came up and advanced.  I did not fall back,  but continued to load and shoot, until a fragment of a shell struck me on  the arm, and then a minnie ball passed through the same paralyzing my arm,  and wounded and disabled me.  General Cheatham, all the time, was calling  on the men to go forward, saying, \"Come on, boys, and follow me.\"    The impression that General Frank Cheatham made upon my mind, leading  the charge on the Wilkerson turnpike, I will never forget.  I saw either  victory or death written on his face.  When I saw him leading our brigade,  although I was wounded at the time, I felt sorry for him, he seemed so  earnest and concerned, and as he was passing me I said, \"Well, General,  if you are determined to die, I'll die with you.\"  We were at that time  at least a hundred yards in advance of the brigade, Cheatham all the time  calling upon the men to come on.  He was leading the charge in person.  Then it was that I saw the power of one man, born to command, over a  multitude of men then almost routed and demoralized.  I saw and felt that  he was not fighting for glory, but that he was fighting for his country  because he loved that country, and he was willing to give his life for  his country and the success of our cause.  He deserves a wreath of  immortality, and a warm place in every Southron's heart, for his brave  and glorious example on that bloody battlefield of Murfreesboro.  Yes,  his history will ever shine in beauty and grandeur as a name among the  brightest in all the galaxy of leaders in the history of our cause.    Now, another fact I will state, and that is, when the private soldier was  ordered to charge and capture the twelve pieces of artillery, heavily  supported by infantry, Maney's brigade raised a whoop and yell, and  swooped down on those Yankees like a whirl-a-gust of woodpeckers in a  hail storm, paying the blue coated rascals back with compound interest;  for when they did come, every man's gun was loaded, and they marched upon  the blazing crest in solid file, and when they did fire, there was a  sudden lull in the storm of battle, because the Yankees were nearly all  killed.  I cannot remember now of ever seeing more dead men and horses  and captured cannon, all jumbled together, than that scene of blood and  carnage and battle on the Wilkerson turnpike.  The ground was literally  covered with blue coats dead; and, if I remember correctly, there were  eighty dead horses.    By this time our command had re-formed, and charged the blazing crest.    The spectacle was grand.  With cheers and shouts they charged up the hill,  shooting down and bayoneting the flying cannoneers, General Cheatham,  Colonel Field and Joe Lee cutting and slashing with their swords.  The victory was complete.  The whole left wing of the Federal army was  driven back five miles from their original position.  Their dead and  wounded were in our lines, and we had captured many pieces of artillery,  small arms, and prisoners.    When I was wounded, the shell and shot that struck me, knocked me  winding.  I said, \"O, O, I'm wounded,\" and at the same time I grabbed  my arm.  I thought it had been torn from my shoulder.  The brigade had  fallen back about two hundred yards, when General Cheatham's presence  reassured them, and they soon were in line and ready to follow so brave  and gallant a leader, and had that order of \"cease firing, you are firing  on your own men,\" not been given, Maney's brigade would have had the  honor of capturing eighteen pieces of artillery, and ten thousand  prisoners.  This I do know to be a fact.    As I went back to the field hospital, I overtook another man walking  along.  I do not know to what regiment he belonged, but I remember of  first noticing that his left arm was entirely gone.  His face was as  white as a sheet.  The breast and sleeve of his coat had been torn away,  and I could see the frazzled end of his shirt sleeve, which appeared to  be sucked into the wound.  I looked at it pretty close, and I said \"Great  God!\" for I could see his heart throb, and the respiration of his lungs.  I was filled with wonder and horror at the sight.  He was walking along,  when all at once he dropped down and died without a struggle or a groan.  I could tell of hundreds of such incidents of the battlefield, but tell  only this one, because I remember it so distinctly.      ROBBING A DEAD YANKEE    In passing over the battlefield, I came across a dead Yankee colonel.  He had on the finest clothes I ever saw, a red sash and fine sword.  I particularly noticed his boots.  I needed them, and had made up my mind  to wear them out for him.  But I could not bear the thought of wearing  dead men's shoes.  I took hold of the foot and raised it up and made one  trial at the boot to get it off.  I happened to look up, and the colonel  had his eyes wide open, and seemed to be looking at me.  He was stone  dead, but I dropped that foot quick.  It was my first and last attempt  to rob a dead Yankee.    After the battle was over at Murfreesboro, that night, John Tucker and  myself thought that we would investigate the contents of a fine brick  mansion in our immediate front, but between our lines and the Yankees',  and even in advance of our videts.  Before we arrived at the house we saw  a body of Yankees approaching, and as we started to run back they fired  upon us.  Our pickets had run in and reported a night attack.  We ran  forward, expecting that our men would recognize us, but they opened fire  upon us.  I never was as bad scared in all my whole life, and if any  poor devil ever prayed with fervency and true piety, I did it on that  occasion.  I thought, \"I am between two fires.\"  I do not think that a  flounder or pancake was half as flat as I was that night; yea, it might  be called in music, low flat.          CHAPTER VII    SHELBYVILLE      It is a bad thing for an army to remain too long at one place.  The men  soon become discontented and unhappy, and we had no diversion or pastime  except playing poker and chuck-a-luck.  All the money of the regiment had  long ago been spent, but grains of corn represented dollars, and with  these we would play as earnestly and as zealously as if they were so much  money, sure enough.
