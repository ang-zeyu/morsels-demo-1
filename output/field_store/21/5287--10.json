Thus they made the Divinity appear improvident, by continually  employing him to destroy the work of his own hands: they, in fact, taxed  him with impotence, by the perpetual non-performance of those projects  of which their own imbecillity, their own erring judgment, had vainly  supposed him to be the contriver.    To solve these difficulties, man created enemies to the Divinity, who  although subordinate to the supreme God, were nevertheless competent  to disturb his empire, to frustrate his views. Can any thing be worse  conceived, can any thing be more truly derogatory to the great _Parent  of parents_, than thus to make him resemble a king, who is surrounded  with adversaries, willing to dispute with him his diadem? Such, however,  is the origin of the _Fable of the Titanes_, or of the _rebellious  angels_, whose presumption caused them to be plunged into the abyss  of misery--who were changed into _demons_, or into evil genii: these  according to their mythology, had no other functions, than to render  abortive the projects of the Divinity; to seduce, to raise to rebellion,  those who were his subjects. Miserable invention, feeble subterfuge,  for the vices of mankind, although decorated with all the beauty of  language. Can then sublimity of versification, the harmony of numbers,  reconcile man to the idea that the puny offspring of natural causes is  adequate for a single instant to dispute the commands, to thwart the  desires, to render nugatory the decrees of a Being whose wisdom is of  the most polished perfection; whose goodness is boundless; whose power  must be more capacious than the human mind can possibly conceive?    In consequence of this _Fable of the Titanes_, the monarch of nature was  represented as perpetually in a scuffle with the enemies he had himself  created; as unwilling totally to subdue those with whom these fabulists  have described him as dividing his authority--partaking his supreme  power. This again was borrowed from the conduct of earthly monarchs,  who, when they find a potent enemy, make a treaty with him; but this was  quite unnecessary for the great _Cause of causes_; and only shows that  man is utterly incapable of forming any other ideas than those which he  derives from the situation of those of his own race, or of the beings  by whom he is surrounded. According to this fable the subjects of the  universal Monarch were never properly submitted to his authority; like  an earthly king, he was in a continual state of hostility, and punished  those who had the misfortune to enter into the conspiracies of the  enemies of his glory: seeing that human legislators put forth laws,  issued decrees, they established similar institutions for the Divinity;  established oracles; his ministers pretended, through these mysterious  mediums, to convey to the people his heavenly mandates, to unveil his  concealed intentions: the ignorant multitude received these without  examination, they did not perceive that it was man, and not the  Divinity, who thus spoke to them; they did not feel that it must be  impossible for weak creatures to act contrary to the will of God.    The _Fable of the Titanes, or rebellious angels_, is extremely ancient;  very generally diffused over the world; it serves for the foundation  of the theology of the Brachmins of Hindostan: according to these, all  living bodies are animated by _fallen angels_, who under these forms  expiate their rebellion. These contradictory notions were the basis of  nearly all the superstitions of the world; by these means they imagined  they accounted for the origin of evil--demonstrated the cause why the  human species experience misery. In short, the conduct of the most  arbitrary tyrants of the earth was but too frequently brought forth, too  often acted upon, in forming the character of the Divinity, held forth  to the worship of man: their imperfect jurisprudence was the source from  whence they drew that which they ascribed to their god. Pagan theology  was remarkable for displaying in the character of their divinities the  most dissolute vices; for making them vindictive; for causing them to  punish with extreme rigour those, crimes which the oracles predicted; to  doom to the most lasting torments those who sinned without knowing their  transgression; to hurl vengeance on those who were ignorant of their  obscure will, delivered in language which set comprehension at defiance;  unless it was by the priest who both made and fulminated it. It was upon  these unreasonable notions, that the theologians founded the worship  which man ought to render to the Divinity. Do not then let us be at all  surprised if the superstitious man was in a state of continual alarm:  if he experienced trances--if his mind was ever in the most tormenting  dread; the idea of his gods recalled to him unceasingly, that of a  pitiless tyrant who sported with the miseries of his subjects; who,  without being conscious of their own wrong, might at each moment incur  his displeasure: he could not avoid feeling that although they had  formed the universe entirely for man, yet justice did not regulate the  actions of these powerful beings, or rather those of the priests; but he  also believed that their elevated rank placed them infinitely above the  human species, that therefore they might afflict him at their pleasure.    It is then for want of considering good and evil as equally necessary;  it is for want of attributing them to their true causes, that man has  created to himself fictitious powers, malicious divinities, respecting  whom it is found so difficult to undeceive him. Nevertheless, in  contemplating nature, he would have been able to have perceived, that  _physical evil_ is a necessary consequence of the peculiar properties of  some beings; he would have acknowledged that plague, contagion,  disease, are due to physical causes under particular circumstances;  to combinations, which, although extremely natural, are fatal to his  species; he would have sought--in the bosom of nature herself the  remedies suitable to diminish these evils, or to have caused the  cessation of those effects under which he suffered: he would have  seen in like manner that _moral evil_ was the necessary consequence  of defective institutions; that it was not to the Divinity, but to the  injustice of his fellows he ought to ascribe those wars, that  poverty, those famines, those reverses of fortune, those multitudinous  calamities, those vices, those crimes, under which he so frequently  groans. Thus to rid himself of these evils he would not have uselessly  extended his trembling hands towards shadows incapable of relieving him;  towards beings who were not the authors of his sorrows; he would have  sought remedies for these misfortunes in a more rational  administration of justice--in more equitable laws--in more I reasonable  institutions--in a greater degree of benevolence towards his fellow  man--in a more punctual performance of his own duties.    As these gods were generally depicted to man as implacable to his  frailties as they denounced nothing but the most dreadful punishments  against those who involuntarily offended, it is not at all surprising  that the sentiment of fear prevailed over that of love: the gloomy  ideas presented to his mind were calculated to make him tremble, without  making him better; an attention to this truth will serve to explain the  foundation of that fantastical, irrational, frequently cruel worship,  which was paid to these divinities; he often committed the most cruel  extravagancies against his own person, the most hideous crimes against  the person of others, under the idea that in so doing, he disarmed the  anger, appeased the justice, recalled the clemency, deserved the mercy  of his gods.    In general, the superstitious systems of man, his human and other  sacrifices, his prayers, his ceremonies, his customs; have had only for  their object either to divert the fury of his gods, whom he believed he  had offended; to render them propitious to his own selfish views; or  to excite in them that good disposition towards himself, which his own  perverse mode of thinking made him imagine they bestowed exclusively on  others: on the other hand, the efforts, the subtilties of theology, have  seldom had any other end, than to reconcile in the divinities it has  pourtrayed, those discordant ideas which its own dogmas has raised in  the minds of mortals. From what has preceded, it may fairly be concluded  that ethnic theology undermined itself by its own inconsistencies;  that the art of composing chimeras may therefore with great justice be  defined to be that of combining those qualities which are impossible to  be reconciled with each other.            CHAP. III.    _Of the confused and contradictory Ideas of Theology._      Every thing that has been said, proves pretty clearly, that, in despite  of all his efforts, man has never been able to prevent himself from  drawing together from his own peculiar nature, the qualities he has  assigned to the Being who governs the universe. The contradictions  necessarily resulting from the incompatible assemblage of these human  qualities, which cannot become suitable to the same subject, seeing  that the existence of one destroys the existence of the other, have  been shewn:--the theologians themselves have felt the insurmountable  difficulties which their divinities presented to reason: they were  so substantive, that as they felt the impossibility of withdrawing  themselves out of the dilemma, they endeavoured to prevent man  from reasoning, by throwing his mind into confusion--by continually  augmenting the perplexity of those ideas, already so discordant, which  they offered him of the gods. By these means they enveloped them in  mystery, covered them with dense clouds, rendered them inaccessible to  mankind: thus they themselves became the interpreters, the masters of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8911"],[0,"Explorations in Australia (#12)"],[1,"ved; my men had gone over to the range, and had searched every  creek, but without success. When found, the runaway animals were standing  on a rise looking very miserable and at a loss what to do; they had  skirted the hill as far down as Mount Delusion. The men took them to the  last water, remained there through the night, and left for this place  this morning. I will give them an hour's rest, and go to the springs  to-night. Arrived at the springs at sundown; they are about nine miles  from Decoy Hill.    Monday, 18th April, Same Place. Resting horses. I went to the top of  Mount Attraction, accompanied by Herrgott, to see what appearance the  country had to the north of west. I observed a high red table-topped hill  bearing 276 degrees from this point, for which I started in search of  water. I had a good view of the country all round; it seems very low to  the westward with low ranges and valleys between; plenty of salt bush and  grass. There is copper with the ironstone on the top of Mount Attraction;  native copper is adhering to the sides of the large pieces of ironstone.  No water. Changed our course to north one mile and a half, thence to  north-east five miles, thence to the springs, but could neither find  water nor Major Warburton's tracks. To-day's journey forty-five miles.  Arrived at the springs after dark.    Tuesday, 19th April, Springs. To the south of our tracks yesterday there  was the appearance of a gum creek, and I think it advisable to send  Herrgott to-day to examine it for water. It would be a great advantage  for stock going to the new country. Seen from a little distance these  springs, at which we are camped, resemble a salt lagoon covered with  salt, which however is not the case; it is the white quartz which gives  them that appearance. There are seven small hillocks from which flow the  springs; their height above the plain is about eight feet, and they are  surrounded with a cake of saltpetre, but the water is very good indeed,  and there is an unlimited supply. Herrgott has taken a sketch of them. He  has returned from examining the gum creek, but can find no water. I must  push on to-morrow for Finniss Springs, and trust to find water on the  way.    Wednesday, 20th April, Same Place. Started at 7.30 on a bearing of 275  degrees over a stony, undulating country with plenty of grass and salt  bush, but no water. At twenty miles we saw a smoke raised by the blacks  to the south of our line, under the range. Camped at 5.15 under a low  range about thirty feet high and very perpendicular, running nearly  north-east and south-west. Distance to-day, thirty-three miles.    Thursday, 21st April. Started at daybreak this morning. Same course. Cut  Major Warburton's tracks at two miles, and changed to his course, 252  degrees. At one mile, saw Finniss Springs a mile and a half to the south  of us; went down to them and camped. There is an immense quantity of  water flowing from them. I shall raise a large cone of stones upon the  hill, which is very prominent and can be seen from a long distance.    Friday, 22nd April, Finniss Springs. Went to the top of Hermit Hill,  whence I obtained a very extensive view of Lake Torrens from north-west  to north-east. Mount Hermit is surrounded by low hills, and in the far  distance there seems to be rising ground. To the south are broken hills,  the termination of the Mount North-west range. I shall examine that part  of the country to-morrow. Between this and the lake (Eyre) to the north  the country is very rough--broken cliffs, with sand; the good country  does not extend more than three miles. The springs are very numerous all  round this mount, and seem to drain into the lake; they give out an  immense quantity of water, and there are many streams of water running  from them. The ground is covered round about the springs with a cake of  soda and saltpetre. I intended to have moved on to Gregory Creek this  afternoon, but took the precaution to send my stockman to see in what  state the water was. He reports the water in the creek to be quite salt,  and many of the small fish dead; he also found some very perfect fossil  shells, the mussel and oyster; they have now become a solid limestone;  they were found in a large circular piece of limestone.    Saturday, 23rd April, Finniss Springs. Started at 8 a.m. with Herrgott to  examine the country south of this. Between this and the range the land is  good in places. It is a little rotten and stony, but the range is a  beautiful grass country to the very top. In the creeks the grass and  other plants are growing luxuriantly, but we could find no water. I was  unable to prosecute the search as far as I wished, in consequence of my  horse having lost a shoe and becoming quite lame, which forced me to  return to the camp, where we arrived at 9 p.m. The view from a high  conical hill of white granite with black spots at the north-west point of  the range, is very extensive, except to the south, which is limited. We  saw smoke in one of the creeks to the east; but as I was anxious to  examine the creek to the south-west, which we saw from the top of the  conical hill, I did not go to where the smoke was rising, thinking that  the blacks might only be hunting. I therefore crossed the hills to the  creek over a good feeding country, timbered with box and gum-trees. We  expected to find water in it, from the great number of birds of all  descriptions that were flying about; we followed it down, but were  unsuccessful, although the birds continued all the way. There must be  water about the hills in some place. At sundown, my horse becoming very  lame, I was forced reluctantly to return. The flow of the waters is  northward into North Lake Torrens. On Monday I shall start again to the  south-west, and leave the examination of the range to the south-east  until my return.    Sunday, 24th April, Finniss Springs. Latitude, 29 degrees 33 minutes 30  seconds. Rested.    Monday, 25th April, Finniss Springs. As it seemed likely to rain, in  which case the country would be very soft, I started at 9.30 on a bearing  of 242 degrees for Chambers Creek. After three miles of gravelly soil and  scanty feed we came to the banks of the two creeks passed by Major  Warburton, splendidly grassed, but the water very salt. They flow into  Lake Torrens. After leaving these creeks we had four miles of sand hills,  very rich with feed, thence over some stony ground to the creek, all  good; my course brought me about three-quarters of a mile to the south of  the creek, which I expected. Distance from the springs to this water  hole, two miles; this is a very long water hole, with plenty of water in  it, and the feed good. We saw some fresh tracks of natives to-day, but  did not meet with any of them.    Tuesday, 26th April, Chambers Creek. I intend to remain here to-day to  fix this place and examine the country about it. Latitude, 29 degrees 39  minutes 9 seconds. I sent Campbell (my stockman) in one direction, and  Muller (the botanist) in another; they report quantities of water, also a  great deal of salt water, with plenty of salt for the use of stations,  with abundance of feed. The stockman saw numerous fresh tracks, but did  not see any natives. The fires were still burning. Muller saw an old man,  a woman, and a child. They were very much frightened, and when he  approached, they called out \"Pompoy!\" and moved their hands for him not  to come any nearer. As they seemed quite unwilling to hold any  conversation, he left them.    Wednesday, 27th April, Chambers Creek. Started at sunrise this morning,  accompanied by my botanist. After travelling thirty miles in a fruitless  search for water, we camped upon a large stony plain with plenty of  vegetation. The horses were very much tired by reason of the heavy sand.  We could see no sign of Lake Torrens. Latitude, 29 degrees 53 minutes 58  seconds.    Thursday, 28th April, Large Stony Plain. Saddled by break of day. Changed  my course to see if the water is still at Yarra Wirta. In order to avoid  the heavy sand hills, which will not do for the horses if there is no  water, I steered for the creek, struck it a little to the north of where  I crossed it on my former expedition, and followed it down. Passed my  former encampment, and found no water there, but on following it down to  where I considered it permanent, I found water still there. I shall give  the horses the afternoon to recruit, and start early in the morning.  Distance to-day, twenty-three miles.    Friday, 29th April, Chambers Creek. Started at sunrise for about a mile  to that part of the north shore of the lake opposite to where the Yarra  Wirta empties itself into it. The country close to the lake is very stony  and scanty of feed; there is some water in it, but it is very salt; a few  salt creeks run into it, but no great body of water. I ascended a hill  for which I had been steering, and obtained an observation of the sun and  bearings. Latitude, 30 degrees 8 minutes 11 seconds. There is no  appearance of any lake between this point and Mount Deception; it appears  to be a stony plain with some ridges of sand hills. This hill, which I  have named Mount Polly, for distinction, is the easternmost of the  flat-topped hills on the north side of the lake, and is a spur from the  Stuart range. It is very stony, and there is grass nearly to the top; it  is very level, and extends for six miles in a north-westerly direction. I  saw that there was little prospect of my obtaining water to-night; and  knowing that the natives had been seen within a few miles of the camp, I  felt anxious about the safety of my party. I determined to proceed  towards the camp on a north-westerly course. Arrived at the creek at  11.30 p.m. and found all right; the natives had paid them a visit, as I  anticipated, but my people could get no information from them. They were  six in number; one was very forward, wishing to examine"]]]
