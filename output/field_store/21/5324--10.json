For thereon is my mind alone intent.\"       He straight replied:  \"That spirit, from whose cheek  The beard sweeps o'er his shoulders brown, what time  Graecia was emptied of her males, that scarce  The cradles were supplied, the seer was he  In Aulis, who with Calchas gave the sign  When first to cut the cable.  Him they nam'd  Eurypilus:  so sings my tragic strain,  In which majestic measure well thou know'st,  Who know'st it all.  That other, round the loins  So slender of his shape, was Michael Scot,  Practis'd in ev'ry slight of magic wile.       \"Guido Bonatti see:   Asdente mark,  Who now were willing, he had tended still  The thread and cordwain; and too late repents.       \"See next the wretches, who the needle left,  The shuttle and the spindle, and became  Diviners:  baneful witcheries they wrought  With images and herbs.  But onward now:  For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine  On either hemisphere, touching the wave  Beneath the towers of Seville.  Yesternight  The moon was round.  Thou mayst remember well:  For she good service did thee in the gloom  Of the deep wood.\"  This said, both onward mov'd.        CANTO XXI    THUS we from bridge to bridge, with other talk,  The which my drama cares not to rehearse,  Pass'd on; and to the summit reaching, stood  To view another gap, within the round  Of Malebolge, other bootless pangs.       Marvelous darkness shadow'd o'er the place.       In the Venetians' arsenal as boils  Through wintry months tenacious pitch, to smear  Their unsound vessels; for th' inclement time  Sea-faring men restrains, and in that while  His bark one builds anew, another stops  The ribs of his, that hath made many a voyage;  One hammers at the prow, one at the poop;  This shapeth oars, that other cables twirls,  The mizen one repairs and main-sail rent  So not by force of fire but art divine  Boil'd here a glutinous thick mass, that round  Lim'd all the shore beneath.  I that beheld,  But therein nought distinguish'd, save the surge,  Rais'd by the boiling, in one mighty swell  Heave, and by turns subsiding and fall.  While there  I fix'd my ken below, \"Mark! mark!\" my guide  Exclaiming, drew me towards him from the place,  Wherein I stood.  I turn'd myself as one,  Impatient to behold that which beheld  He needs must shun, whom sudden fear unmans,  That he his flight delays not for the view.  Behind me I discern'd a devil black,  That running, up advanc'd along the rock.  Ah! what fierce cruelty his look bespake!  In act how bitter did he seem, with wings  Buoyant outstretch'd and feet of nimblest tread!  His shoulder proudly eminent and sharp  Was with a sinner charg'd; by either haunch  He held him, the foot's sinew griping fast.       \"Ye of our bridge!\" he cried, \"keen-talon'd fiends!  Lo! one of Santa Zita's elders!  Him  Whelm ye beneath, while I return for more.  That land hath store of such.  All men are there,  Except Bonturo, barterers: of 'no'  For lucre there an 'aye' is quickly made.\"       Him dashing down, o'er the rough rock he turn'd,  Nor ever after thief a mastiff loos'd  Sped with like eager haste.  That other sank  And forthwith writing to the surface rose.  But those dark demons, shrouded by the bridge,  Cried \"Here the hallow'd visage saves not: here  Is other swimming than in Serchio's wave.  Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not,  Take heed thou mount not o'er the pitch.\"  This said,  They grappled him with more than hundred hooks,  And shouted:  \"Cover'd thou must sport thee here;  So, if thou canst, in secret mayst thou filch.\"  E'en thus the cook bestirs him, with his grooms,  To thrust the flesh into the caldron down  With flesh-hooks, that it float not on the top.       Me then my guide bespake:  \"Lest they descry,  That thou art here, behind a craggy rock  Bend low and screen thee; and whate'er of force  Be offer'd me, or insult, fear thou not:  For I am well advis'd, who have been erst  In the like fray.\"  Beyond the bridge's head  Therewith he pass'd, and reaching the sixth pier,  Behov'd him then a forehead terror-proof.       With storm and fury, as when dogs rush forth  Upon the poor man's back, who suddenly  From whence he standeth makes his suit; so rush'd  Those from beneath the arch, and against him  Their weapons all they pointed.  He aloud:  \"Be none of you outrageous:  ere your time  Dare seize me, come forth from amongst you one,  Who having heard my words, decide he then  If he shall tear these limbs.\"  They shouted loud,  \"Go, Malacoda!\"  Whereat one advanc'd,  The others standing firm, and as he came,  \"What may this turn avail him?\" he exclaim'd.       \"Believ'st thou, Malacoda!  I had come  Thus far from all your skirmishing secure,\"  My teacher answered, \"without will divine  And destiny propitious?  Pass we then  For so Heaven's pleasure is, that I should lead  Another through this savage wilderness.\"       Forthwith so fell his pride, that he let drop  The instrument of torture at his feet,  And to the rest exclaim'd: \"We have no power  To strike him.\"  Then to me my guide:  \"O thou!  Who on the bridge among the crags dost sit  Low crouching, safely now to me return.\"       I rose, and towards him moved with speed:  the fiends  Meantime all forward drew:  me terror seiz'd  Lest they should break the compact they had made.  Thus issuing from Caprona, once I saw  Th' infantry dreading, lest his covenant  The foe should break; so close he hemm'd them round.       I to my leader's side adher'd, mine eyes  With fixt and motionless observance bent  On their unkindly visage.  They their hooks  Protruding, one the other thus bespake:  \"Wilt thou I touch him on the hip?\"  To whom  Was answer'd:  \"Even so; nor miss thy aim.\"       But he, who was in conf'rence with my guide,  Turn'd rapid round, and thus the demon spake:  \"Stay, stay thee, Scarmiglione!\"  Then to us  He added:  \"Further footing to your step  This rock affords not, shiver'd to the base  Of the sixth arch.  But would you still proceed,  Up by this cavern go:  not distant far,  Another rock will yield you passage safe.  Yesterday, later by five hours than now,  Twelve hundred threescore years and six had fill'd  The circuit of their course, since here the way  Was broken.  Thitherward I straight dispatch  Certain of these my scouts, who shall espy  If any on the surface bask.  With them  Go ye:  for ye shall find them nothing fell.  Come Alichino forth,\" with that he cried,  \"And Calcabrina, and Cagnazzo thou!  The troop of ten let Barbariccia lead.  With Libicocco Draghinazzo haste,  Fang'd Ciriatto, Grafflacane fierce,  And Farfarello, and mad Rubicant.  Search ye around the bubbling tar.  For these,  In safety lead them, where the other crag  Uninterrupted traverses the dens.\"       I then:  \"O master! what a sight is there!  Ah! without escort, journey we alone,  Which, if thou know the way, I covet not.  Unless thy prudence fail thee, dost not mark  How they do gnarl upon us, and their scowl  Threatens us present tortures?\"  He replied:  \"I charge thee fear not:  let them, as they will,  Gnarl on:  't is but in token of their spite  Against the souls, who mourn in torment steep'd.\"       To leftward o'er the pier they turn'd; but each  Had first between his teeth prest close the tongue,  Toward their leader for a signal looking,  Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave.        CANTO XXII    IT hath been heretofore my chance to see  Horsemen with martial order shifting camp,  To onset sallying, or in muster rang'd,  Or in retreat sometimes outstretch'd for flight;  Light-armed squadrons and fleet foragers  Scouring thy plains, Arezzo! have I seen,  And clashing tournaments, and tilting jousts,  Now with the sound of trumpets, now of bells,  Tabors, or signals made from castled heights,  And with inventions multiform, our own,  Or introduc'd from foreign land; but ne'er  To such a strange recorder I beheld,  In evolution moving, horse nor foot,  Nor ship, that tack'd by sign from land or star.       With the ten demons on our way we went;  Ah fearful company!  but in the church  With saints, with gluttons at the tavern's mess.       Still earnest on the pitch I gaz'd, to mark  All things whate'er the chasm contain'd, and those  Who burn'd within.  As dolphins, that, in sign  To mariners, heave high their arched backs,  That thence forewarn'd they may advise to save  Their threaten'd vessels; so, at intervals,  To ease the pain his back some sinner show'd,  Then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance.       E'en as the frogs, that of a wat'ry moat  Stand at the brink, with the jaws only out,  Their feet and of the trunk all else concealed,  Thus on each part the sinners stood, but soon  As Barbariccia was at hand, so they  Drew back under the wave.  I saw, and yet  My heart doth stagger, one, that waited thus,  As it befalls that oft one frog remains,  While the next springs away:  and Graffiacan,  Who of the fiends was nearest, grappling seiz'd  His clotted locks, and dragg'd him sprawling up,  That he appear'd to me an otter.  Each  Already by their names I knew, so well  When they were chosen, I observ'd, and mark'd  How one the other call'd. \"O Rubicant!  See that his hide thou with thy talons flay,\"  Shouted together all the cursed crew.       Then I:  \"Inform thee, master!  if thou may,  What wretched soul is this, on whom their hand  His foes have laid.\"  My leader to his side  Approach'd, and whence he came inquir'd, to whom  Was answer'd thus:  \"Born in Navarre's domain  My mother plac'd me in a lord's retinue,  For she had borne me to a losel vile,  A spendthrift of his substance and himself.  The good king Thibault after that I serv'd,  To peculating here my thoughts were turn'd,  Whereof I give account in this dire heat.\"       Straight Ciriatto, from whose mouth a tusk  Issued on either side, as from a boar,  Ript him with one of these.  'Twixt evil claws"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10084"],[0,"Kazan (#13)"],[1,"I love you, too.\" He laid his hand caressingly on Kazan's head.  \"Wonder how he'll take to life down there?\" he asked. \"He has always  been used to the forests. It'll seem mighty strange.\"    \"And so--have I--always been used to the forests,\" whispered Joan. \"I  guess that's why I love Kazan--next to you and the baby. Kazan--dear old  Kazan!\"    This time Kazan felt and scented more of that mysterious change in the  cabin. Joan and her husband talked incessantly of their plans when they  were together; and when the man was away Joan talked to the baby, and to  him. And each time that he came down to the cabin during the week that  followed, he grew more and more restless, until at last the man noticed  the change in him.    \"I believe he knows,\" he said to Joan one evening. \"I believe he knows  we're preparing to leave.\" Then he added: \"The river was rising again  to-day. It will be another week before we can start, perhaps longer.\"    That same night the moon flooded the top of the Sun Rock with a golden  light, and out into the glow of it came Gray Wolf, with her three little  whelps toddling behind her. There was much about these soft little balls  that tumbled about him and snuggled in his tawny coat that reminded  Kazan of the baby. At times they made the same queer, soft little  sounds, and they staggered about on their four little legs just as  helplessly as baby Joan made her way about on two. He did not fondle  them, as Gray Wolf did, but the touch of them, and their babyish  whimperings, filled him with a kind of pleasure that he had never  experienced before.    The moon was straight above them, and the night was almost as bright as  day, when he went down again to hunt for Gray Wolf. At the foot of the  rock a big white rabbit popped up ahead of him, and he gave chase. For  half a mile he pursued, until the wolf instinct in him rose over the  dog, and he gave up the futile race. A deer he might have overtaken, but  small game the wolf must hunt as the fox hunts it, and he began to slip  through the thickets slowly and as quietly as a shadow. He was a mile  from the Sun Rock when two quick leaps put Gray Wolf's supper between  his jaws. He trotted back slowly, dropping the big seven-pound snow-shoe  hare now and then to rest.    When he came to the narrow trail that led to the top of the Sun Rock he  stopped. In that trail was the warm scent of strange feet. The rabbit  fell from his jaws. Every hair in his body was suddenly electrified into  life. What he scented was not the scent of a rabbit, a marten or a  porcupine. Fang and claw had climbed the path ahead of him. And then,  coming faintly to him from the top of the rock, he heard sounds which  sent him up with a terrible whining cry. When he reached the summit he  saw in the white moonlight a scene that stopped him for a single moment.  Close to the edge of the sheer fall to the rocks, fifty feet below, Gray  Wolf was engaged in a death-struggle with a huge gray lynx. She was  down--and under, and from her there came a sudden sharp terrible cry of  pain.    Kazan flew across the rock. His attack was the swift silent assault of  the wolf, combined with the greater courage, the fury and the strategy  of the husky. Another husky would have died in that first attack. But  the lynx was not a dog or a wolf. It was \"Mow-lee, the swift,\" as the  Sarcees had named it--the quickest creature in the wilderness. Kazan's  inch-long fangs should have sunk deep in its jugular. But in a  fractional part of a second the lynx had thrown itself back like a huge  soft ball, and Kazan's teeth buried themselves in the flesh of its neck  instead of the jugular. And Kazan was not now fighting the fangs of a  wolf in the pack, or of another husky. He was fighting claws--claws that  ripped like twenty razor-edged knives, and which even a jugular hold  could not stop.    Once he had fought a lynx in a trap, and he had not forgotten the lesson  the battle had taught him. He fought to pull the lynx _down_, instead of  forcing it on its back, as he would have done with another dog or a  wolf. He knew that when on its back the fierce cat was most dangerous.  One rip of its powerful hindfeet could disembowel him.    Behind him he heard Gray Wolf sobbing and crying, and he knew that she  was terribly hurt. He was filled with the rage and strength of two dogs,  and his teeth met through the flesh and hide of the cat's throat. But  the big lynx escaped death by half an inch. It would take a fresh grip  to reach the jugular, and suddenly Kazan made the deadly lunge. There  was an instant's freedom for the lynx, and in that moment it flung  itself back, and Kazan gripped at its throat--_on top_.    The cat's claws ripped through his flesh, cutting open his side--a  little too high to kill. Another stroke and they would have cut to his  vitals. But they had struggled close to the edge of the rock wall, and  suddenly, without a snarl or a cry, they rolled over. It was fifty or  sixty feet to the rocks of the ledge below, and even as they pitched  over and over in the fall, Kazan's teeth sank deeper. They struck with  terrific force, Kazan uppermost. The shock sent him half a dozen feet  from his enemy. He was up like a flash, dizzy, snarling, on the  defensive. The lynx lay limp and motionless where it had fallen. Kazan  came nearer, still prepared, and sniffed cautiously. Something told him  that the fight was over. He turned and dragged himself slowly along the  ledge to the trail, and returned to Gray Wolf.    Gray Wolf was no longer in the moonlight. Close to the two rocks lay the  limp and lifeless little bodies of the three pups. The lynx had torn  them to pieces. With a whine of grief Kazan approached the two boulders  and thrust his head between them. Gray Wolf was there, crying to herself  in that terrible sobbing way. He went in, and began to lick her bleeding  shoulders and head. All the rest of that night she whimpered with pain.  With dawn she dragged herself out to the lifeless little bodies on the  rock.    And then Kazan saw the terrible work of the lynx. For Gray Wolf was  blind--not for a day or a night, but blind for all time. A gloom that no  sun could break had become her shroud. And perhaps again it was that  instinct of animal creation, which often is more wonderful than man's  reason, that told Kazan what had happened. For he knew now that she was  helpless--more helpless than the little creatures that had gamboled in  the moonlight a few hours before. He remained close beside her all  that day.    [Illustration: Kazan gripped at its throat]    Vainly that day did Joan call for Kazan. Her voice rose to the Sun Rock,  and Gray Wolf's head snuggled closer to Kazan, and Kazan's ears dropped  back, and he licked her wounds. Late in the afternoon Kazan left Gray  Wolf long enough to run to the bottom of the trail and bring up the  snow-shoe rabbit. Gray Wolf muzzled the fur and flesh, but would not  eat. Still a little later Kazan urged her to follow him to the trail. He  no longer wanted to stay at the top of the Sun Rock, and he no longer  wanted Gray Wolf to stay there. Step by step he drew her down the  winding path away from her dead puppies. She would move only when he was  very near her--so near that she could touch his scarred flank with her  nose.    They came at last to the point in the trail where they had to leap down  a distance of three or four feet from the edge of a rock, and here Kazan  saw how utterly helpless Gray Wolf had become. She whined, and crouched  twenty times before she dared make the spring, and then she jumped  stiff-legged, and fell in a heap at Kazan's feet. After this Kazan did  not have to urge her so hard, for the fall impinged on her the fact that  she was safe only when her muzzle touched her mate's flank. She followed  him obediently when they reached the plain, trotting with her  foreshoulder to his hip.    Kazan was heading for a thicket in the creek bottom half a mile away,  and a dozen times in that short distance Gray Wolf stumbled and fell.  And each time that she fell Kazan learned a little more of the  limitations of blindness. Once he sprang off in pursuit of a rabbit, but  he had not taken twenty leaps when he stopped and looked back. Gray Wolf  had not moved an inch. She stood motionless, sniffing the air--waiting  for him! For a full minute Kazan stood, also waiting. Then he returned  to her. Ever after this he returned to the point where he had left Gray  Wolf, knowing that he would find her there.    All that day they remained in the thicket. In the afternoon he visited  the cabin. Joan and her husband were there, and both saw at once  Kazan's torn side and his lacerated head and shoulders.    \"Pretty near a finish fight for him,\" said the man, after he had  examined him. \"It was either a lynx or a bear. Another wolf could not do  that.\"    For half an hour Joan worked over him, talking to him all the time, and  fondling him with her soft hands. She bathed his wounds in warm water,  and then covered them with a healing salve, and Kazan was filled again  with that old restful desire to remain with her always, and never to go  back into the forests. For an hour she let him lie on the edge of her  dress, with his nose touching her foot, while she worked on baby things.  Then she rose to prepare supper, and Kazan got up--a little wearily--and  went to the door. Gray Wolf and the gloom of the night were calling him,  and he answered that call with a slouch of his shoulders and a drooping  head. Its old thrill was gone. He watched his chance, and went out  through the door. The moon had risen when he rejoined Gray Wolf. She  greeted his return with a low whine of joy, and muzzled him with her  blind face. In her helplessness she looked happier than Kazan in all his  strength.    From now on, during the days that followed, it was a last great fight  between blind and faithful Gray Wolf and the woman.
