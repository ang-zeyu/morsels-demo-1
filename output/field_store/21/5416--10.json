[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1261"],[0,"Betty Zane (#13)"],[1,"with your Indianized brother, Isaac. He is  the finest fellow, as well as the most interesting, I ever knew. I  like Colonel Zane immensely too. The dark, quiet fellow, Jack, or  John, they call him, is not like your other brothers. The hunter,  Wetzel, inspires me with awe. Everyone has been most kind to me and  I have almost forgotten that I was a wanderer.\"    \"I am glad to hear that,\" said Betty.    \"Miss Zane,\" continued Alfred, \"doubtless you have heard that I came  West because I was compelled to leave my home. Please do not believe  everything you hear of me. Some day I may tell you my story if you  care to hear it. Suffice it to say now that I left my home of my own  free will and I could go back to-morrow.\"    \"I did not mean to imply--\" began Betty, coloring.    \"Of course not. But tell me about yourself. Is it not rather dull  and lonesome here for you?\"    \"It was last winter. But I have been contented and happy this  summer. Of course, it is not Philadelphia life, and I miss the  excitement and gayety of my uncle's house. I knew my place was with  my brothers. My aunt pleaded with me to live with her and not go to  the wilderness. I had everything I wanted there--luxury, society,  parties, balls, dances, friends--all that the heart of a girl could  desire, but I preferred to come to this little frontier settlement.  Strange choice for a girl, was it not?\"    \"Unusual, yes,\" answered Alfred, gravely. \"And I cannot but wonder  what motives actuated our coming to Fort Henry. I came to seek my  fortune. You came to bring sunshine into the home of your brother,  and left your fortune behind you. Well, your motive has the element  of nobility. Mine has nothing but that of recklessness. I would like  to read the future.\"    \"I do not think it is right to have such a wish. With the veil  rolled away could you work as hard, accomplish as much? I do not  want to know the future. Perhaps some of it will be unhappy. I have  made my choice and will cheerfully abide by it. I rather envy your  being a man. You have the world to conquer. A woman--what can she  do? She can knead the dough, ply the distaff, and sit by the lattice  and watch and wait.\"    \"Let us postpone such melancholy thoughts until some future day. I  have not as yet said anything that I intended. I wish to tell you  how sorry I am that I acted in such a rude way the night your  brother came home. I do not know what made me do so, but I know I  have regretted it ever since. Will you forgive me and may we not be  friends?\"    \"I--I do not know,\" said Betty, surprised and vaguely troubled by  the earnest light in his eyes.    \"But why? Surely you will make some little allowance for a naturally  quick temper, and you know you did not--that you were--\"    \"Yes, I remember I was hasty and unkind. But I made amends, or at  least, I tried to do so.\"    \"Try to overlook my stupidity. I will not give up until you forgive  me. Consider how much you can avoid by being generous.\"    \"Very well, then, I will forgive you,\" said Betty, who had arrived  at the conclusion that this young man was one of determination.    \"Thank you. I promise you shall never regret it. And the sprained  ankle? It must be well, as I noticed you danced beautifully.\"    \"I am compelled to believe what the girls say--that you are inclined  to the language of compliment. My ankle is nearly well, thank you.  It hurts a little now and then.\"    \"Speaking of your accident reminds me of the day it happened,\" said  Alfred, watching her closely. He desired to tease her a little, but  he was not sure of his ground. \"I had been all day in the woods with  nothing but my thoughts--mostly unhappy ones--for company. When I  met you I pretended to be surprised. As a matter of fact I was not,  for I had followed your dog. He took a liking to me and I was  extremely pleased, I assure you. Well, I saw your face a moment  before you knew I was as near you. When you heard my footsteps you  turned with a relieved and joyous cry. When you saw whom it was your  glad expression changed, and if I had been a hostile Wyandot you  could not have looked more unfriendly. Such a woeful, tear-stained  face I never saw.\"    \"Mr. Clarke, please do not speak any more of that,\" said Betty with  dignity. \"I desire that you forget it.\"    \"I will forget all except that it was I who had the happiness of  finding you and of helping you. I cannot forget that. I am sure we  should never have been friends but for that accident.\"    \"There is Isaac. He is looking for me,\" answered Betty, rising.    \"Wait a moment longer--please. He will find you,\" said Alfred,  detaining her. \"Since you have been so kind I have grown bolder. May  I come over to see you to-morrow?\"    He looked straight down into the dark eyes which wavered and fell  before he had completed his question.    \"There is Isaac. He cannot see me here. I must go.\"    \"But not before telling me. What is the good of your forgiving me if  I may not see you. Please say yes.\"    \"You may come,\" answered Betty, half amused and half provoked at his  persistence. \"I should think you would know that such permission  invariably goes with a young woman's forgiveness.\"    \"Hello, here you are. What a time I have had in finding you,\" said  Isaac, coming up with flushed face and eyes bright with excitement.  \"Alfred, what do you mean by hiding the belle of the dance away like  this? I want to dance with you, Betts. I am having a fine time. I  have not danced anything but Indian dances for ages. Sorry to take  her away, Alfred. I can see she doesn't want to go. Ha! Ha!\" and  with a mischievous look at both of them he led Betty away.    Alfred kept his seat awhile lost in thought. Suddenly he remembered  that it would look strange if he did not make himself agreeable, so  he got up and found a partner. He danced with Alice, Lydia, and the  other young ladies. After an hour he slipped away to his room. He  wished to be alone. He wanted to think; to decide whether it would  be best for him to stay at the fort, or ride away in the darkness  and never return. With the friendly touch of Betty's hand the  madness with which he had been battling for weeks rushed over him  stronger than ever. The thrill of that soft little palm remained  with him, and he pressed the hand it had touched to his lips.    For a long hour he sat by his window. He could dimly see the broad  winding river, with its curtain of pale gray mist, and beyond, the  dark outline of the forest. A cool breeze from the water fanned his  heated brow, and the quiet and solitude soothed him.        CHAPTER IV.    \"Good morning, Harry. Where are you going so early?\" called Betty  from the doorway.    A lad was passing down the path in front of Colonel Zane's house as  Betty hailed him. He carried a rifle almost as long as himself.    \"Mornin', Betty. I am goin' 'cross the crick fer that turkey I hear  gobblin',\" he answered, stopping at the gate and smiling brightly at  Betty.    \"Hello, Harry Bennet. Going after that turkey? I have heard him  several mornings and he must be a big, healthy gobbler,\" said  Colonel Zane, stepping to the door. \"You are going to have company.  Here comes Wetzel.\"    \"Good morning, Lew. Are you too off on a turkey hunt?\" said Betty.    \"Listen,\" said the hunter, as he stopped and leaned against the  gate. They listened. All was quiet save for the tinkle of a cow-bell  in the pasture adjoining the Colonel's barn. Presently the silence  was broken by a long, shrill, peculiar cry.    \"Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug-chug.\"    \"Well, it's a turkey, all right, and I'll bet a big gobbler,\"  remarked Colonel Zane, as the cry ceased.    \"Has Jonathan heard it?\" asked Wetzel.    \"Not that I know of. Why do you ask?\" said the Colonel, in a low  tone. \"Look here, Lew, is that not a genuine call?\"    \"Goodbye, Harry, be sure and bring me a turkey,\" called Betty, as  she disappeared.    \"I calkilate it's a real turkey,\" answered the hunter, and motioning  the lad to stay behind, he shouldered his rifle and passed swiftly  down the path.    Of all the Wetzel family--a family noted from one end of the  frontier to the other--Lewis was as the most famous.    The early history of West Virginia and Ohio is replete with the  daring deeds of this wilderness roamer, this lone hunter and  insatiable Nemesis, justly called the greatest Indian slayer known  to men.    When Lewis was about twenty years old, and his brothers John and  Martin little older, they left their Virginia home for a protracted  hunt. On their return they found the smoking ruins of the home, the  mangled remains of father and mother, the naked and violated bodies  of their sisters, and the scalped and bleeding corpse of a baby  brother.    Lewis Wetzel swore sleepless and eternal vengeance on the whole  Indian race. Terribly did he carry out that resolution. From that  time forward he lived most of the time in the woods, and an Indian  who crossed his trail was a doomed man. The various Indian tribes  gave him different names. The Shawnees called him \"Long Knife;\" the  Hurons, \"Destroyer;\" the Delawares, \"Death Wind,\" and any one of  these names would chill the heart of the stoutest warrior.    To most of the famed pioneer hunters of the border, Indian fighting  was only a side issue--generally a necessary one--but with Wetzel it  was the business of his life. He lived solely to kill Indians. He  plunged recklessly into the strife, and was never content unless  roaming the wilderness solitudes, trailing the savages to their very  homes and ambushing the village bridlepath like a panther waiting  for his prey. Often in the gray of the morning the Indians, sleeping  around their camp fire, were awakened by a horrible, screeching  yell. They started up in terror only to fall victims to the tomahawk  of their merciless foe, or to hear a rifle shot and get a glimpse of  a form with flying black hair disappearing with wonderful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#13)"],[1,"ark, quiet glance was  dreamy and sad, and in it was the sombre, brooding strength of the  desert.    Twilight and falling dew sent them back to the camp. Piute and Peon were  skinning coyotes by the blaze of the fire. The night wind had not yet  risen; the sheep were quiet; there was no sound save the crackle of  burning cedar sticks. Jack began to talk; he had to talk, so, addressing  Piute and the dumb peon, he struck at random into speech, and words  flowed with a rush. Piute approved, for he said \"damn\" whenever his  intelligence grasped a meaning, and the peon twisted his lips and fixed  his diamond eyes upon Hare in rapt gaze. The sound of a voice was  welcome to the sentinels of that lonely sheep-range. Jack talked of  cities, of ships, of people, of simple things in the life he had left,  and he discovered that Mescal listened. Not only did she listen; she  became absorbed; it was romance to her, fulfilment of her vague dreams.  Nor did she seek her tent till he ceased; then with a startled \"good-  night\" she was gone.    From under the snugness of his warm blankets Jack watched out the last  wakeful moments of that day of days. A star peeped through the fringe of  cedar foliage. The wind sighed, and rose steadily, to sweep over him  with breath of ice, with the fragrance of juniper and black sage and a  tang of cedar.    But that day was only the beginning of eventful days, of increasing  charm, of forgetfulness of self, of time that passed unnoted. Every  succeeding day was like its predecessor, only richer. Every day the  hoar-frost silvered the dawn; the sheep browsed; the coyotes skulked in  the thickets; the rifle spoke truer and truer. Every sunset Mescal's  changing eyes mirrored the desert. Every twilight Jack sat beside her in  the silence; every night, in the camp-fire flare, he talked to Piute and  the peon.    The Indians were appreciative listeners, whether they understood Jack or  not, but his talk with them was only a presence. He wished to reveal the  outside world to Mescal, and he saw with pleasure that every day she  grew more interested.    One evening he was telling of New York City, of the monster buildings  where men worked, and of the elevated railways, for the time was the  late seventies and they were still a novelty. Then something  unprecedented occurred, inasmuch as Piute earnestly and vigorously  interrupted Jack, demanding to have this last strange story made more  clear. Jack did his best in gesture and speech, but he had to appeal to  Mescal to translate his meaning to the Indian. This Mescal did with  surprising fluency. The result, however, was that Piute took exception  to the story of trains carrying people through the air. He lost his grin  and regarded Jack with much disfavor. Evidently he was experiencing the  bitterness of misplaced trust.    \"Heap damn lie!\" he exclaimed with a growl, and stalked off into the  gloom.    Piute's expressive doubt discomfited Hare, but only momentarily, for  Mescal's silvery peal of laughter told him that the incident had brought  them closer together. He laughed with her and discovered a well of  joyousness behind her reserve. Thereafter he talked directly to Mescal.  The ice being broken she began to ask questions, shyly at first, yet  more and more eagerly, until she forgot herself in the desire to learn  of cities and people; of women especially, what they wore and how they  lived, and all that life meant to them.    The sweetest thing which had ever come to Hare was the teaching of this  desert girl. How naive in her questions and how quick to grasp she was!  The reaching out of her mind was like the unfolding of a rose. Evidently  the Mormon restrictions had limited her opportunities to learn.    But her thought had striven to escape its narrow confines, and now,  liberated by sympathy and intelligence, it leaped forth.    Lambing-time came late in May, and Mescal, Wolf, Piute and Jack knew no  rest. Night-time was safer for the sheep than the day, though the  howling of a thousand coyotes made it hideous for the shepherds. All in  a day, seemingly, the little fleecy lambs came, as if by magic, and  filled the forest with piping bleats. Then they were tottering after  their mothers, gamboling at a day's growth, wilful as youth--and the  carnage began. Boldly the coyotes darted out of thicket and bush, and  many lambs never returned to their mothers. Gaunt shadows hovered always  near; the great timber-wolves waited in covert for prey. Piute slept not  at all, and the dog's jaws were flecked with blood morning and night.  Jack hung up fifty-four coyotes the second day; the third he let them  lie, seventy in number. Many times the rifle-barrel burned his hands.  His aim grew unerring, so that running brutes in range dropped in their  tracks. Many a gray coyote fell with a lamb in his teeth.    One night when sheep and lambs were in the corral, and the shepherds  rested round the camp-fire, the dog rose quivering, sniffed the cold  wind, and suddenly bristled with every hair standing erect.    \"Wolf!\" called Mescal.    The sheep began to bleat. A rippling crash, a splintering of wood, told  of an irresistible onslaught on the corral fence.    \"Chus--chus!\" exclaimed Piute.    Wolf, not heeding Mescal's cry, flashed like lightning under the cedars.  The rush of the sheep, pattering across the corral was succeeded by an  uproar.    \"Bear! Bear!\" cried Mescal, with dark eyes on Jack. He seized his rifle.    \"Don't go,\" she implored, her hand on his arm. \"Not at night--remember  Father Naab said not.\"    \"Listen! I won't stand that. I'll go. Here, get in the tree--quick!\"    \"No--no--\"    \"Do as I say!\" It was a command. The girl wavered. He dropped the rifle,  and swung her up. \"Climb!\"    \"No--don't go--Jack!\"    With Piute at his heels he ran out into the darkness.              VI. THE WIND IN THE CEDARS    PIUTE'S Indian sense of the advantage of position in attack stood Jack  in good stead; he led him up the ledge which overhung one end of the  corral. In the pale starlight the sheep could be seen running in bands,  massing together, crowding the fence; their cries made a deafening din.    The Indian shouted, but Jack could not understand him. A large black  object was visible in the shade of the ledge. Piute fired his carbine.  Before Jack could bring his rifle up the black thing moved into  startlingly rapid flight. Then spouts of red flame illumined the corral.  As he shot, Jack got fleeting glimpses of the bear moving like a dark  streak against a blur of white. For all he could tell no bullet took  effect.    When certain that the visitor had departed Jack descended into the  corral. He and Piute searched for dead sheep, but, much to their  surprise, found none. If the grizzly had killed one he must have taken  it with him; and estimating his strength from the gap he had broken in  the fence, he could easily have carried off a sheep. They repaired the  break and returned to camp.    \"He's gone, Mescal. Come down,\" called Jack into the cedar. \"Let me help  you--there! Wasn't it lucky? He wasn't so brave. Either the flashes from  the guns or the dog scared him. I was amazed to see how fast he could  run.\"    Piute found woolly brown fur hanging from Wolf's jaws.    \"He nipped the brute, that's sure,\" said Jack. \"Good dog! Maybe he kept  the bear from-- Why Mescal! you're white--you're shaking. There's no  danger. Piute and I'll take turns watching with Wolf.\"    Mescal went silently into her tent.    The sheep quieted down and made no further disturbance that night. The  dawn broke gray, with a cold north wind. Dun-colored clouds rolled up,  hiding the tips of the crags on the upper range, and a flurry of snow  whitened the cedars. After breakfast Jack tried to get Wolf to take the  track of the grizzly, but the scent had cooled.    Next day Mescal drove the sheep eastward toward the crags, and about the  middle of the afternoon reached the edge of the slope. Grass grew  luxuriantly and it was easy to keep the sheep in. Moreover, that part of  the forest had fewer trees, and scarcely any sage or thickets, so that  the lambs were safer, barring danger which might lurk in the seamed and  cracked cliffs overshadowing the open grassy plots. Piute's task at the  moment was to drag dead coyotes to the rim, near at hand, and throw them  over. Mescal rested on a stone, and Wolf reclined at her feet.    Jack presently found a fresh deer track, and trailed it into the cedars,  then up the slope to where the huge rocks massed.    Suddenly a cry from Mescal halted him; another, a piercing scream of  mortal fright, sent him flying down the slope. He bounded out of the  cedars into the open.    The white, well-bunched flock had spread, and streams of jumping sheep  fled frantically from an enormous silver-backed bear.    As the bear struck right and left, a brute-engine of destruction, Jack  sent a bullet into him at long range. Stung, the grizzly whirled, bit at  his side, and then reared with a roar of fury.    But he did not see Jack. He dropped down and launched his huge bulk for  Mescal. The blood rushed back to Jack's heart, and his empty veins  seemed to freeze.    The grizzly hurdled the streams of sheep. Terror for Mescal dominated  Jack; if he had possessed wings he could not have flown quickly enough  to head the bear. Checking himself with a suddenness that fetched him to  his knees, he levelled the rifle. It waved as if it were a stick of  willow. The bead-sight described a blurred curve round the bear. Yet he  shot--in vain--again--in vain.    Above the bleat of sheep and trample of many hoofs rang out Mescal's  cry, despairing.    She had turned, her hands over her breast. Wolf spread his legs before  her and crouched to spring, mane erect, jaws wide.    By some lightning flash of memory, August Naab's words steadied Jack's  shaken nerves. He aimed low and ahead of the running bear. Down the  beast went in a sliding"]]]
