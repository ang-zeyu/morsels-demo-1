Greek mythology had its source in the legends of a remote  antiquity,--probably among the Pelasgians, the early inhabitants of  Greece, which they brought with them in their migration from their  original settlement, or perhaps from Egypt and Phoenicia. Herodotus--and  he is not often wrong--ascribes a great part of the mythology which the  Greek poets elaborated to a Phoenician or Egyptian source. The legends  have also some similarity to the poetic creations of the ancient  Persians, who delighted in fairies and genii and extravagant exploits,  like the labors of Hercules The faults and foibles of deified mortals  were transmitted to posterity and incorporated with the attributes of  the supreme divinity, and hence the mixture of the mighty and the mean  which marks the characters of the Iliad and Odyssey. The Greeks adopted  Oriental fables, and accommodated them to those heroes who figured in  their own country in the earliest times. \"The labors of Hercules  originated in Egypt, and relate to the annual progress of the sun in  the zodiac. The rape of Proserpine, the wanderings of Ceres, the  Eleusinian mysteries, and the orgies of Bacchus were all imported from  Egypt or Phoenicia, while the wars between the gods and the giants were  celebrated in the romantic annals of Persia. The oracle of Dodona was  copied from that of Ammon in Thebes, and the oracle of Apollo at Delphos  has a similar source.\"    Behind the Oriental legends which form the basis of Grecian mythology  there was, in all probability, in those ancient times before the  Pelasgians were known as Ionians and the Hellenes as Dorians, a mystical  and indefinite idea of supreme power,--as among the Persians, the  Hindus, and the esoteric priests of Egypt. In all the ancient religions  the farther back we go the purer and loftier do we find the popular  religion. Belief in supreme deity underlies all the Eastern theogonies,  which belief, however, was soon perverted or lost sight of. There is  great difference of opinion among philosophers as to the origin of  myths,--whether they began in fable and came to be regarded as history,  or began as human history and were poetized into fable. My belief is  that in the earliest ages of the world there were no mythologies. Fables  were the creations of those who sought to amuse or control the people,  who have ever delighted in the marvellous. As the magnificent, the  vast, the sublime, which was seen in Nature, impressed itself on the  imagination of the Orientals and ended in legends, so did allegory in  process of time multiply fictions and fables to an indefinite extent;  and what were symbols among Eastern nations became impersonations in the  poetry of Greece. Grecian mythology was a vast system of impersonated  forces, beginning with the legends of heroes and ending with the  personification of the faculties of the mind and the manifestations of  Nature, in deities who presided over festivals, cities, groves, and  mountains, with all the infirmities of human nature, and without calling  out exalted sentiments of love or reverence. They are all creations of  the imagination, invested with human traits and adapted to the genius of  the people, who were far from being religious in the sense that the  Hindus and Egyptians were. It was the natural and not the supernatural  that filled their souls. It was art they worshipped, and not the God who  created the heavens and the earth, and who exacts of his creatures  obedience and faith.    In regard to the gods and goddesses of the Grecian Pantheon, we observe  that most of them were immoral; at least they had the usual infirmities  of men. They are thus represented by the poets, probably to please the  people, who like all other peoples had to make their own conceptions of  God; for even a miraculous revelation of deity must be interpreted by  those who receive it, according to their own understanding of the  qualities revealed. The ancient Romans, themselves stern, earnest,  practical, had an almost Oriental reverence for their gods, so that  their Jupiter (Father of Heaven) was a majestic, powerful, all-seeing,  severely just national deity, regarded by them much as the Jehovah of  the Hebrews was by that nation. When in later times the conquest of  Eastern countries and of Macedon and Greece brought in luxury, works of  art, foreign literature, and all the delightful but enervating  influences of aestheticism, the Romans became corrupted, and gradually  began to identify their own more noble deities with the beautiful but  unprincipled, self-indulgent, and tricky set of gods and goddesses of  the Greek mythology.    The Greek Zeus, with whom were associated majesty and dominion, and who  reigned supreme in the celestial hierarchy,--who as the chief god of the  skies, the god of storms, ruler of the atmosphere, was the favorite  deity of the Aryan race, the Indra of the Hindus, the Jupiter of the  Romans,--was in his Grecian presentment a rebellious son, a faithless  husband, and sometimes an unkind father. His character was a combination  of weakness and strength,--anything but a pattern to be imitated, or  even to be reverenced. He was the impersonation of power and dignity,  represented by the poets as having such immense strength that if he had  hold of one end of a chain, and all the gods held the other, with the  earth fastened to it, he would be able to move them all.    Poseidon (Roman Neptune), the brother of Zeus, was represented as the  god of the ocean, and was worshipped chiefly in maritime States. His  morality was no higher than that of Zeus; moreover, he was rough,  boisterous, and vindictive. He was hostile to Troy, and yet  persecuted Ulysses.    Apollo, the next great personage of the Olympian divinities, was more  respectable morally than his father. He was the sun-god of the Greeks,  and was the embodiment of divine prescience, of healing skill, of  musical and poetical productiveness, and hence the favorite of the  poets. He had a form of ideal beauty, grace, and vigor, inspired by  unerring wisdom and insight into futurity. He was obedient to the will  of Zeus, to whom he was not much inferior in power. Temples were erected  to this favorite deity in every part of Greece, and he was supposed to  deliver oracular responses in several cities, especially at Delphos.    Hephaestus (Roman Vulcan), the god of fire, was a sort of jester at the  Olympian court, and provoked perpetual laughter from his awkwardness and  lameness. He forged the thunderbolts for Zeus, and was the armorer of  heaven. It accorded with the grim humor of the poets to make this clumsy  blacksmith the husband of Aphrodite, the queen of beauty and of love.    Ares (Roman Mars), the god of war, was represented as cruel, lawless,  and greedy of blood, and as occupying a subordinate position, receiving  orders from Apollo and Athene.    Hermes (Roman Mercury) was the impersonation of commercial dealings, and  of course was full of tricks and thievery,--the Olympian man of  business, industrious, inventive, untruthful, and dishonest. He was also  the god of eloquence.    Besides these six great male divinities there were six goddesses, the  most important of whom was Hera (Roman Juno), wife of Zeus, and hence  the Queen of Heaven. She exercised her husband's prerogatives, and  thundered and shook Olympus; but she was proud, vindictive, jealous,  unscrupulous, and cruel,--a poor model for women to imitate. The Greek  poets, however, had a poor opinion of the female sex, and hence  represent this deity without those elements of character which we most  admire in woman,--gentleness, softness, tenderness, and patience. She  scolded her august husband so perpetually that he gave way to complaints  before the assembled deities, and that too with a bitterness hardly to  be reconciled with our notions of dignity. The Roman Juno, before the  identification of the two goddesses, was a nobler character, being the  queen of heaven, the protectress of virgins and of matrons, and was also  the celestial housewife of the nation, watching over its revenues and  its expenses. She was the especial goddess of chastity, and loose women  were forbidden to touch her altars.    Athene (Roman Minerva) however, the goddess of wisdom, had a character  without a flaw, and ranked with Apollo in wisdom. She even expostulated  with Zeus himself when he was wrong. But on the other hand she had few  attractive feminine qualities, and no amiable weaknesses.    Artemis (Roman Diana) was \"a shadowy divinity, a pale reflection of her  brother Apollo.\" She presided over the pleasures of the chase, in which  the Greeks delighted,--a masculine female who took but little interest  in anything intellectual.    Aphrodite (Roman Venus) was the impersonation of all that was weak and  erring in the nature of woman,--the goddess of sensual desire, of mere  physical beauty, silly, childish, and vain, utterly odious in a moral  point of view, and mentally contemptible. This goddess was represented  as exerting a great influence even when despised, fascinating yet  revolting, admired and yet corrupting. She was not of much importance  among the Romans,--who were far from being sentimental or  passionate,--until the growth of the legend of their Trojan origin.  Then, as mother of Aeneas, their progenitor, she took a high rank, and  the Greek poets furnished her character.    Hestia (Roman Vesta) presided over the private hearths and homesteads of  the Greeks, and imparted to them a sacred character. Her personality was  vague, but she represented the purity which among both Greeks and Romans  is attached to home"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10478"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 02: Jewish Heroes and Prophets (#13)"],[1,"of the Almighty  to the end of time.    The Ten Commandments seem to be the foundation of the subsequent and  more minute code which Moses gave to the Jews; and it is interesting to  see how its great principles have entered, more or less, into the laws  of Christian nations from the decline of the Roman Empire, into the  Theodosian code, the laws of Charlemagne, of Ina, of Alfred, and  especially into the institutions of the Puritans, and of all other sects  and parties wherever the Bible is studied and revered. They seem to be  designed not merely for Jews, but for Gentiles also, since there is no  escape from their obligation. They may seem severe in some of their  applications, but never unjust; and as long as the world endures, the  relations between man and man are to be settled on lofty moral grounds.  An elevated morality is the professed aim of all enlightened lawgivers;  and the prosperity of nations is built upon it, for it is righteousness  which exalteth them. Culture is desirable; but the welfare of nations is  based on morals rather than on aesthetics. On this point Moses, or even  Epictetus, is a greater authority than Goethe. All the ordinances of  Moses tend to this end. They are the publication of natural  religion,--that God is a rewarder of virtuous actions, and punishes  wicked deeds. Moses, from first to last, insists imperatively on the  doctrine of personal responsibility to God, which doctrine is the  logical sequence of belief in Him as the moral governor of the world.  And in enforcing this cardinal truth he is dogmatic and dictatorial, as  a prophet and ambassador of the Most High should be.    It is a waste of time to use arguments in the teaching of the primal  principles which appeal to consciousness; and I am not certain but that  elaborate and metaphysical reasoning on the nature and attributes of God  weakens rather than strengthens the belief in Him, since He is a power  made known by revelation, and received and accepted by the soul at once,  if received at all. Among the earliest noticeable corruptions of the  Church was the introduction of Greek philosophy to harmonize and  reconcile with it the truths of the gospel, which to a certain class  ever have been, and ever will be, foolishness. The speculations and  metaphysics of theologians, I verily believe, have done more harm than  good,--from Athanasius to Jonathan Edwards,--whenever they have brought  the aid of finite reason to support the ultimate truths declared by an  infinite and almighty mind. Moses does not reason, nor speculate, nor  refine; he affirms, and appeals to the law written on the heart,--to the  consciousness of mankind. What he declares to be duties are not even to  be discussed. They are to be obeyed with unhesitating obedience, since  no discussion or argument can make them clearer or more imperative. The  obligation to obey them is seen and felt at once, as soon as they are  declared. What he says in regard to the relations of master and servant;  to injuries inflicted on the body; to the respect due to parents; to the  protection of the widow, the fatherless, and the unfortunate; to  delicacy in the treatment of women; to unjust judgments; to bribery and  corruption; to revenge, hatred, and covetousness; to falsehood and  tale-bearing; to unchastity, theft, murder, and adultery,--can never be  gainsaid, and would have been accepted by Roman jurists as readily as by  modern legislators; yea, they would not be disputed by savages, if they  acknowledged a God at all. The elevated morality of the ethical code of  Moses is its most striking feature, since it appeals to the universal  heart, and does not conflict with some of the ethical teachings of those  great lights of the Pagan world to whose consciousness God has been  revealed. Moses differs from them only in the completion and scope and  elevation of his system, and in its freedom from the puerilities and  superstitions which they blended with their truths, and from which he  was emancipated by inspiration. Brahma and Confucius and Socrates taught  some great truths which Moses would accept, but they taught errors  likewise. He taught no errors, though he permitted some sins which in  the beginning did not exist,--such, for instance, as polygamy. Christ  came not to destroy his law, but to fulfil it and complete it. In two  things especially, how emphatic his teaching and how permanent his  influence!--in respect to the observance of the Sabbath and the  relations of the sexes. To him, more than to any man in the world's  history, do we owe the elevation of woman, and the sanctity and blessing  of a day of rest. In the awful sacredness of the person, and in the  regular resort to the sanctuary of God, we see his immortal authority  and his permanent influence.    The other laws which Moses promulgated are more special and minute, and  seem to be intended to preserve the Jews from idolatry, the peculiar sin  of the surrounding nations; and also, more directly, to keep alive the  recognition of a theocratic government.    Thus the ceremonial or ritualistic law--an important part of the Mosaic  Code--constantly points to Jehovah as the King of the Jews, as well as  their Supreme Deity, for whose worship the rites and ceremonies are  devised with great minuteness, to keep His _personality_ constantly  before their minds. Moreover, all their rites and ceremonies were  typical and emblematical of the promised Saviour who was to arise; in a  more emphatic sense their King, and not merely their own Messiah, but  the Redeemer of the whole race, who should reign finally as King of  kings and Lord of lords. And hence these rites and sacrifices, typical  of Him who should offer Himself as a sacrifice for the sins of the  world, are not supposed to be binding on other nations after the great  sacrifice has been made, and the law of Moses has been fulfilled by  Jesus and the new dispensation has been established. We see a  complicated and imposing service, with psalms and hymns, and beautiful  robes, and smoking altars,--all that could inspire awe and reverence. We  behold a blazing tabernacle of gold and silver and precious woods and  gorgeous tapestries, with inner and secret recesses to contain the ark  and the tables of stone, the mysterious rod, the urn of manna, the book  of the covenant, the golden throne over-canopied by cherubs with  outstretched wings, and the mercy-seat for the Shekinah who sat between  the cherubim. The sacred and costly vessels, the candlesticks of pure  and beaten gold, the lamps, the brazen sea, the embroidered vestments of  the priests, the breastplate of precious stones, the golden chains, the  emblematic rings, the ephods and mitres and girdles, the various altars  for sacrifice, the burnt-offerings, peace-offerings, meat-offerings, and  sin-offerings, the consecrated cakes and animals for sacrifice, the  rites for cleansing leprosy and all uncleanliness, the grand atonements  and solemn fasts and festivals,--all were calculated to make a strong  impression on a superstitious people. The rites and ceremonies of the  Jews were so attractive that they made up for all other amusements and  spectacles; they answered the purpose of the Gothic churches and  cathedrals of Europe in the Middle Ages, when these were the chief  attractions of the period. There is nothing absurd in ritualism among  ignorant and superstitious people, who are ever most easily impressed  through their senses and imagination. It was the wisdom of the Middle  Ages,--the device of popes and bishops and abbots to attract and  influence the people. But ritualism--useful in certain ages and  circumstances, certainly in its most imposing forms, if I may say  it--does not seem to be one of the peculiarities of enlightened ages;  even the ritualism of the wilderness lost much of its hold upon the Jews  themselves after their captivity, and still more when Greek and Roman  civilization had penetrated to Jerusalem. The people who listened to  Peter and Paul could no longer be moved by imposing rites, even as the  European nations--under the preaching of Luther, Knox, and Latimer--lost  all relish for the ceremonies of the Middle Ages. What, then, are we to  think of the revival of observances which lost their force three hundred  years ago, unless connected with artistic music? It is music which  vitalizes ritualistic worship in our times, as it did in the times of  David and Solomon. The vitality of the Jewish ritual, when the nation  had emerged from barbarism, was in its connections with a magnificent  psalmody. The Psalms of David appeal to the heart and not to the senses.  The ritualism of the wilderness appealed to the senses and not to the  heart; and this was necessary when the people had scarcely emerged from  barbarism, even as it was deemed necessary amid the turbulence and  ignorance of the tenth century.    In the ritualism which Moses established there was the absence of  everything which would recall the superstitions and rites, or even the  doctrines, of the Egyptians. In view of this, we account partially for  the almost studied reticence in respect to a future state, upon which  hinged many of the peculiarities of Egyptian worship. It would have been  difficult for Moses to have recognized the future state, in the  degrading ignorance and sensualism of the Jews, without associating with  it the tutelary deities of the Egyptians and all the absurdities  connected with the doctrine of metempsychosis, which consigned the  victims of future punishment to enter the forms of disgusting and  hideous animals, thereby blending with the sublime doctrine of a future  state the most degrading superstitions. Bishop Warburton seizes on the  silence of Moses respecting a future state to prove, by a learned yet  sophistical argument, his divine legation, _because_ he ignored what so  essentially entered into the religion of Egypt. But whether Moses  purposely "]]]
