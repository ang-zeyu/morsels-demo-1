Then with the  alteration of the force of the current of air, which of course regulated  the centrifugal force, alternating thicknesses of film were obtained,  causing a varying display of beautiful colors and combinations of colors.  This last experiment also tended to prove that the bands of color are not  arranged in a certain order, but vary according to the thickness of the  film, a conclusion arrived at by Brewster, who observed that if a film  reflecting certain colors be carefully inverted so as not to disturb the  gravity, the colors reflected are also inverted. Lord Rayleigh explained  the phenomenon by referring to Young's wave theory of light. He regarded  the film as having two surfaces from which light is reflected, an anterior  exterior surface and a posterior interior surface. If a ray of light be  thrown upon the film, a part of the light is reflected from the first  surface, but the greater part is transmitted, and some of this is reflected  from the second surface, passes back through the film, and is combined with  the light reflected from the first surface. If then the light reflected  from the second surface be in the same state of vibration as that reflected  from the first surface, the effect of their combination will be to increase  the amount of light reflected from the first surface, but if otherwise, the  effect will be a partial neutralization of the light reflected from the  first surface. That is to say, if the retardation of the light which is  reflected from the second surface, owing to its twice traversing the  thickness of the film, be equivalent to a wave length of the vibration of  the light, it will increase the intensity of the light reflected from the  first surface. If, however, the retardation be only equivalent to half a  wave length, the intensity of the light will be decreased. Thus, then, with  a ray of monochromatic light it will be seen that the effect of difference  in the thickness of the film will be to alter the intensity of the  reflected ray, but with a white light composed of several colors the result  will be more complicated. As each color has a different wave length in  vibration, it will be seen that each color will act independently of the  others, and a certain thickness of film which, upon the combination of the  two reflected rays, will cause one particular color to be intensified, will  at the same time cause the other colors to be more or less obscured.    Thus as the thickness of the film is altered different colors preponderate,  causing the appearance of rings or bands, according to the nature of the  experiment. The dark appearance on the screen corresponding to the thinnest  part of the film is probably due to refraction of the ray of light  reflected from the second surface, consequent in its passing from a rare  into a denser medium, and again from the denser medium into the rare, which  refraction Lord Rayleigh considers to effect a retardation equivalent to  half a wave length. Lord Rayleigh supported this theory of the formation of  Newton's rings by several interesting experiments. A beam of light was  intercepted by two of Nicol's prisms, one of which acted as a polarizer and  the other as an analyzer of the light, so that no light was able to pass  through both on to the screen. Between the two prisms a double refractive  lens was now placed, in this case a double concave lens of selenite, when  the same series of concentric rings observed with the film of air was  obtained on the screen, only much more intense, while a wedge of selenite  gave the bands of color in the same order as with the soap bubble.    But perhaps the most striking proof of the dependence of the colors upon  the thickness of the film was shown by the reflection of a beam of light  from a piece of mica composed of twenty-four very attenuated plates  overlapping each other. With each layer a marked gradation in color was  visible.    The remainder of the lecture was devoted to an explanation of the  determination of the chromatic relations of the colors of the spectrum.  Lord Rayleigh at this point made a rather startling statement that any  color can be produced by two other colors. As an example of such a  formation, a ray of white light was passed separately through a solution of  yellow chromate of potash and an alkaline litmus solution, throwing  respectively a yellow and violet-blue color upon the screen. When the ray  was made to pass through the two solutions successively, an orange-yellow  color was obtained upon the screen, which color Lord Rayleigh asserted to  be made up of red and green rays. To prove this, the ray of white light was  decomposed by means of a prism, and the decomposed rays passed through the  two solutions. The one solution was found to exclude all the yellow and  orange rays from the spectrum, while the other excluded all the blue and  violet rays, so that when the ray had passed through both solutions, only  the red and green rays were left. If, instead of allowing the decomposed  ray of light to pass through a slit, and thus obtain definite bands in the  spectrum, the ray was passed through a circular hole, the red and green  colors overlapped each other on the screen, forming by their combination  the identical orange-yellow color obtained with the primary white light. It  was then stated that if three definite positions be taken in a spectrum in  the red, green, and violet bands respectively, and these positions be  represented by the corners of an equilateral triangle (Clerk Maxwell's  triangle), it has been mathematically determined in what position within  this triangle the colors of Newton's rings would fall. Lord Rayleigh, by  means of a diagram and the selenite wedge, showed that the relations to the  three standard colors in practice were identical with the position assigned  them by theory.    In conclusion, the lecturer showed a piece of glass, the surface of which  had been decomposed, a ray of light transmitted through which showed upon  the screen patches of very pure color. These he considered to be due to the  glass consisting of a number of thin plates, some of which had been removed  by the decomposition.           *       *       *       *       *          BELT JOINTS.      From time to time, serious accidents have taken place, and the progress of  work stopped, by the sudden snapping of driving belts in machinery, and, as  a general rule, it is found that the collapse is attributable either to  faulty leather or insecure joining. A great improvement of the leather  intended for belts has been brought about during the last few years, by the  introduction of improved processes for currying and the subsequent  treatment. Paterson has worked successfully a patent for rendering belt  leather more pliable, and lessening the tendency to stretch. Under this  treatment the leather is either curried or rough dried, and then soaked in  a solution of wood, resin, and gum thus, or frankincense, first melted  together, and then dissolved, by the application of heat, in boiled or  linseed oil. The leather, after this process, is soaked in petroleum or  carbon bisulphide containing a little India-rubber solution, and is finally  washed with petroleum benzoline. Should the mixture be found to be too  thick, it is thinned down with benzoline spirit until it is about the  consistency of molasses at the ordinary temperature. The leather so  prepared is not liable to stretch, and can be joined in the usual way by  copper riveting, or the ends can be sewn. A good material for smaller  belts, and for strings and bands for connecting larger ones, is that  recently patented by Vornberger, in which the gut of cattle is the basis.  After careful cleansing, the gut is split up into strands, and treated with  a bath of pearlash water for several days. The strands are then twisted  together, and after being dipped in a solution of Condy's fluid, are dried.  They are then sulphured in a wooden box for twenty-four hours, after which  the twisting can be completed. They are by this process rendered pliable,  and can be used in this state for stitching the leather ends of larger  belts, or can be stiffened by plunging them into a bath of isinglass and  white wine vinegar. After drying they are susceptible of a fine polish,  emery cloth being usually employed, and the final \"finish\" is given to the  material with gum arabic and oil.    Canvas and woven fabrics, coated with India-rubber, are also now being used  for driving belts and for covering machine rollers. As this material can be  made in one piece, without the necessity of a joint, it is uniform in  strength, and is recommended as a substitute for leather belts requiring  joints. A patented material of this description is due to Zingler, who  boils the canvas or similar woven fabric under pressure in a solution of  tungstate of soda for three hours. It is then transferred to a bath of  acetate of lead solution, and drained, dried, and stretched. When in this  condition it is coated, by means of a spreading machine, with repeated  layers of a composition consisting of India-rubber, antimony sulphide,  peroxide of iron, sulphur, lime, asbestos, chalk, sulphate of zinc, and  carbonate of magnesia. When a sufficient thickness of this composition has  been applied, it is vulcanized under pressure at a temperature of 250 deg. F.,  or a little higher. The material produced in this manner is said to have  the strength and durability of the best leather belts. Attempts have  recently been made to obtain a glue suitable for joining the ends of  driving belts, without the use of metal fastenings or sewing, and Messrs.  David Kirkaldy & Son have reported favorably on such a belt glue, which is  being introduced by Mr. W.V. Van Wyk, of 30 and 31 Newgate street, E.C.

The answer came deliberately, \"Yes, she has evidently been battered to  death.\"    Mr. Gryce's lips closed with grim decision. \"A most brutal murder,\" said  he and lifting up the cloth with a hand that visibly trembled, he softly  covered her face.    \"Well,\" said I as we slowly paced back up the pier, \"there is one thing  certain, she is not the one who disappeared from Mr. Blake's house.\"    \"I am not so sure of that.\"    \"How!\" said I. \"You believed Fanny lied when she gave that description  of the missing girl upon which we have gone till now?\"    Mr. Gryce smiled, and turning back, beckoned to the official behind us.  \"Let me have that description,\" said he, \"which I distributed among the  Harbor Police some days ago for the identification of a certain corpse I  was on the lookout for.\"    The man opened his coat and drew out a printed paper which at Mr.  Gryce's word he put into my hand. It ran as follows:        Look out for the body of a young girl, tall, well shaped but thin,      of fair complexion and golden hair of a peculiar bright and      beautiful color, and when found, acquaint me at once.                                                              G.    \"I don't understand,\" began I.    But Mr. Gryce tapping me on the arm said in his most deliberate tones,  \"Next time you examine a room in which anything of a mysterious nature  has occurred, look under the bureau and if you find a comb there with  several long golden hairs tangled in it, be very sure before you draw  any definite conclusions, that your Fannys know what they are talking  about when they declare the girl who used that comb had black hair on  her head.\"        CHAPTER X. THE SECRET OF MR. BLAKE'S STUDIO      \"Mr. Blake is at dinner, sir, with company, but I will call him if you  say so.\"    \"No,\" returned Mr. Gryce; \"show us into some room where we can be  comfortable and we will wait till he has finished.\"    The servant bowed, and stepping forward down the hall, opened the door  of a small and cosy room heavily hung with crimson curtains. \"I will  let him know that you are here,\" said he, and vanished towards the  dining-room.    \"I doubt if Mr. Blake will enjoy the latter half of his bill of fare as  much as the first,\" said I, drawing up one of the luxurious arm-chairs  to the side of my principal. \"I wonder if he will break away from his  guests and come in here?\"    \"No; if I am not mistaken we shall find Mr. Blake a man of nerve. Not a  muscle of his face will show that he is disturbed.\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"I dread it.\"    Mr. Gryce looked about on the gorgeous walls and the rich old fashioned  furniture that surrounded him, and smiled one of his grimmest smiles.    \"Well, you may,\" said he.    The next instant a servant stood in the doorway, bearing to our great  astonishment, a tray well set with decanter and glasses.    \"Mr. Blake's compliments, gentlemen,\" said he, setting it down on the  table before us. \"He hopes you will make yourselves at home and he will  see you as soon as possible.\"    The humph! of Mr. Gryce when the servant had gone would have done your  soul good, also the look he cast at the pretty Dresden Shepherdess on  the mantel-piece, as I reached out my hand towards the decanter. Somehow  it made me draw back.    \"I think we had better leave his wine alone,\" said he.    And for half an hour we sat there, the wine untouched between us,  listening alternately to the sound of speech-making and laughter that  came from the dining-room, and the solemn ticking of the clock as it  counted out the seconds on the mantel-piece. Then the guests came in  from the table, filing before us past the open door on their way to  the parlors. They were all gentlemen of course--Mr. Blake never invited  ladies to his house--and gentlemen of well known repute. The dinner had  been given in honor of a certain celebrated statesman, and the character  of his guests was in keeping with that of the one thus complimented.    As they went by us gaily indulging in the jokes and light banter with  which such men season a social dinner, I saw Mr. Gryce's face grow sober  by many a shade; and when in the midst of it all, we heard the voice  of Mr. Blake rise in that courteous and measured tone for which it  is distinguished, I saw him reach forward and grasp his cane with an  uneasiness I had never seen displayed by him before. But when some time  later, the guests having departed, the dignified host advanced with some  apology to where we were, I never beheld a firmer look on Mr. Gryce's  face than that with which he rose and confronted him. Mr. Blake's own  had not more character in it.    \"You have called at a rather inauspicious time, Mr. Gryce,\" said the  latter, glancing at the card which he held in his hand. \"What may your  business be? Something to do with politics, I suppose.\"    I surveyed the man in amazement. Was this great politician stooping  to act a part, or had he forgotten our physiognomies as completely as  appeared?    \"Our business is not politics,\" replied Mr. Gryce; \"but fully as  important. May I request the doors be closed?\"    I thought Mr. Blake looked surprised, but he immediately stepped to the  door and shut it. Then coming back, he looked at Mr. Gryce more closely  and a change took place in his manner.    \"I think I have seen you before,\" said he.    Mr. Gryce bowed with just the suspicion of a smile. \"I have had the  honor of consulting you before in this very house,\" observed he.    A look of full recognition passed over the dignified countenance of the  man before us.    \"I remember,\" said he, shrugging his shoulders in the old way. \"You are  interested in some servant girl or other who ran away from this house a  week or so ago. Have you found her?\" This with no apparent concern.    \"We think we have,\" rejoined Mr. Gryce with some solemnity. \"The river  gives up its prey now and then, Mr. Blake.\"    Still only that look of natural surprise.    \"Indeed! You do not mean to say she has drowned herself? I am sorry for  that, a girl who had once lived in my house. What trouble could she have  had to drive her to such an act?\"    Mr. Gryce advanced a step nearer the gentleman.    \"That is what we have come here to learn,\" said he with a deliberation  that yet was not lacking in the respect due to a man so universally  esteemed as Mr. Blake. \"You who have seen her so lately ought to be able  to throw some light upon the subject at least.\"    \"Mr.--\" he again glanced at the card, \"Mr. Gryce,--excuse me--I believe  I told you when you were here before that I had no remembrance of this  girl at all. That if such a person was in my house I did not know it,  and that all questions put to me on that subject would be so much labor  thrown away.\"    Mr. Gryce bowed. \"I remember,\" said he. \"I was not alluding to any  connection you may have had with the girl in this house, but to the  interview you were seen to have with her on the corner of Broome Street  some days ago. You had such an interview, did you not?\"    A flush, deep as it was sudden, swept over Mr. Blake's usually unmoved  cheek. \"You are transgressing sir,\" said he and stopped. Though a man of  intense personal pride, he had but little of that quality called temper,  or perhaps if he had, thought it unwise to display it on this occasion.  \"I saw and spoke to a girl on the corner of that street some days ago,\"  he went on more mildly, \"but that she was the one who lived here,  I neither knew at the time nor feel willing to believe now without  positive proof.\" Then in a deep ringing tone the stateliness of which it  would be impossible to describe, he inquired, \"Have the city authorities  presumed to put a spy on my movements, that the fact of my speaking to  a poor forsaken creature on the corner of the street should be not only  noted but remembered?\"    \"Mr. Blake,\" observed Mr. Gryce, and I declare I was proud of my  superior at that moment, \"no man who is a true citizen and a  Christian should object to have his steps followed, when by his own  thoughtlessness, perhaps, he has incurred a suspicion which demands it.\"    \"And do you mean to say that I have been followed,\" inquired he,  clenching his hand and looking steadily, but with a blanching cheek,  first at Mr. Gryce then at me.    \"It was indispensable,\" quoth that functionary gently.    The outraged gentleman riveted his gaze upon me. \"In town and out of  town?\" demanded he.    I let Mr. Gryce reply. \"It is known that you have lately sought to visit  the Schoenmakers,\" said he.    Mr. Blake drew a deep breath, cast his eyes about the handsome apartment  in which we were, let them rest for a moment upon a portrait that graced  one side of the wall, and which was I have since learned a picture of  his father, and slowly drew forward a chair. \"Let me hear what your  suspicions are,\" said he.    I noticed Mr. Gryce colored at this; he had evidently been met in a  different way from what he expected. \"Excuse me,\" said he, \"I do not say  I have any suspicions; my errand is simply to notify you of the death of  the girl you were seen to speak with, and to ask whether or not you  can give us any information that can aid us in the matter before the  coroner.\"    \"You know I have not. If I have been as closely followed as you say, you  must know why I spoke to that girl and others, why I went to the house  of the Schoenmakers and--Do you know?\" he suddenly inquired.    Mr. Gryce was not the man to answer such a question as that. He eyed the  rich signet ring that adorned the hand of the gentleman before him and  suavely smiled. \"I am ready to listen to any explanations,\" said he.    Mr. Blake's haughty countenance became almost stern. \"You consider you  have a right to demand them; let me hear why.\"    \"Well,\" said Mr. Gryce with a change of tone, \"you shall.
