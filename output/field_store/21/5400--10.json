The meal, consisting of coffee, chipped  venison, and a thin wafer bread made from corn and reheated over  coals, was disposed of with relish. The two Americans sauntered around  for some distance, and on their return to the cabin found Tiburcio  enjoying his siesta under a near-by pecan tree.    Their horses refreshed and rested, they resaddled, crossing the  stream, intending to return to the ranchito by evening. After leaving  the bottoms of the creek, Tiburcio showed the young man a trail made  by the javeline, and he was surprised to learn that an animal with so  small a foot was a dangerous antagonist, on account of its gregarious  nature. Proceeding they came to several open prairies, in one of  which they saw a herd of antelope, numbering forty to fifty, making  a beautiful sight as they took fright and ran away. Young Wells  afterward learned that distance lent them charms and was the greatest  factor in their beauty. As they rode from one vantage-point to another  for the purpose of sight-seeing, the afternoon passed rapidly.    Later, through the interpreter he inquired of Tiburcio if his services  could be secured as guide, cook, and companion for the winter, since  he had fully made up his mind to occupy the cabin. Tiburcio was  overjoyed at the proposition, as it was congenial to his tastes,  besides carrying a compensation. Definite arrangements were now  made with him, and he was requested to be on hand in the morning. On  reaching the ranchito, young Wells's decision was announced to their  host of the night previous, much to the latter's satisfaction. During  the evening the two Americans planned to return to the village in the  morning for the needed supplies. Tiburcio was on hand at the appointed  time, and here unconsciously the young man fortified himself in the  old hunter's confidence by intrusting him with the custody of his gun,  blankets, and several other articles until he should return.    A week later found the young hunter established in the cabin with the  interpreter and Tiburcio. A wagon-load of staple supplies was snugly  stored away for future use, and they were at peace with the world.  By purchase Wells soon had several saddle ponies, and the old hunter  adding his pack of javeline dogs, they found themselves well equipped  for the winter campaign.    Hunting, in which the young man was an apt scholar, was now the order  of the day. Tiburcio was an artist in woodcraft as well as in  his knowledge of the habits of animals and birds. On chilly or  disagreeable days they would take out the pack of dogs and beat the  thickets for the javeline. It was exciting sport to bring to bay a  drove of these animals. To shoot from horseback lent a charm, yet made  aim uncertain, nor was it advisable to get too close range. Many a  young dog made a fatal mistake in getting too near this little animal,  and the doctoring of crippled dogs became a daily duty. All surplus  game was sent to the ranchito below, where it was always appreciated.    At first the young man wrote regularly long letters home, but as it  took Tiburcio a day to go to the post-office, he justified himself  in putting writing off, sometimes several weeks, because it ruined  a whole day and tired out a horse to mail a letter. Hardships were  enjoyed. They thought nothing of spending a whole night going from one  turkey roost to another, if half a dozen fine birds were the reward.  They would saddle up in the evening and ride ten miles, sleeping  out all night by a fire in order to stalk a buck at daybreak, having  located his range previously.    Thus the winter passed, and as the limit of the young man's vacation  was near at hand, Wells wrote home pleading for more time, telling his  friends how fast he was improving, and estimating that it would take  at least six months more to restore him fully to his former health.  This request being granted, he contented himself by riding about the  country, even visiting cattle ranches south on the Frio River. Now and  then he would ride into San Antonio for a day or two, but there  was nothing new to be seen there, and his visits were brief. He had  acquired a sufficient knowledge of Spanish to get along now without an  interpreter.    When the summer was well spent, he began to devise some excuse to give  his parents for remaining another winter. Accordingly he wrote his  father what splendid opportunities there were to engage in cattle  ranching, going into detail very intelligently in regard to  the grasses on the tract and the fine opportunity presented for  establishing a ranch. The water privileges, the faithfulness of  Tiburcio, and other minor matters were fully set forth, and he  concluded by advising that they buy or start a brand of cattle on this  grant. His father's reply was that he should expect his son to return  as soon as the state of his health would permit. He wished to be a  dutiful son, yet he wished to hunt just one more winter.    So he felt that he must make another tack to gain his point. Following  letters noted no improvement in his health. Now, as the hunting season  was near at hand, he found it convenient to bargain with a renegade  doctor, who, for the consideration offered, wrote his parents that  their son had recently consulted him to see if it would be  advisable to return to a rigorous climate in his present condition.  Professionally he felt compelled to advise him not to think of leaving  Texas for at least another year. To supplement this, the son wrote  that he hoped to be able to go home in the early spring. This had the  desired effect. Any remorse of conscience he may have felt over the  deception resorted to was soon forgotten in following a pack of hounds  or stalking deer, for hunting now became the order of the day. The  antlered buck was again in his prime. His favorite range was carefully  noted. Very few hunts were unrewarded by at least one or more shots  at this noble animal. With an occasional visitor, the winter passed  as had the previous one. Some congenial spirit would often spend a few  days with them, and his departure was always sincerely regretted.    The most peculiar feature of the whole affair was the friendship of  the young man for Tiburcio. The latter was the practical hunter, which  actual experience only can produce. He could foretell the coming of  a norther twenty-four hours in advance. Just which course deer would  graze he could predict by the quarter of the wind. In woodcraft he was  a trustworthy though unquoted authority. His young patron often showed  him his watch and explained how it measured time, but he had no use  for it. He could tell nearly enough when it was noon, and if the  stars were shining he knew midnight within a few minutes. This he had  learned when a shepherd. He could track a wounded deer for miles, when  another could not see a trace of where the animal had passed. He could  recognize the footprint of his favorite saddle pony among a thousand  others. How he did these things he did not know himself. These  companions were graduates of different schools, extremes of different  nationalities. Yet Alexander Wells had no desire to elevate the old  hunter to his own standard, preferring to sit at his feet.    But finally the appearance of blades of grass and early flowers  warned them that winter was gone and that spring was at hand. Their  occupation, therefore, was at an end. Now how to satisfy the folks  at home and get a further extension of time was the truant's supreme  object. While he always professed obedience to parental demands, yet  rebellion was brewing, for he did not want to go East--not just yet.  Imperative orders to return were artfully parried. Finally remittances  were withheld, but he had no use for money. Coercion was bad policy  to use in his case. Thus a third and a fourth winter passed, and the  young hunter was enjoying life on the Salado, where questions of state  and nation did not bother him.    But this existence had an end. One day in the spring a conveyance  drove up to the cabin, and an elderly, well-dressed woman alighted.  With the assistance of her driver she ran the gauntlet of dogs and  reached the cabin door, which was open. There, sitting inside on a  dry cow-skin which was spread on the clay floor, was the object of  her visit, surrounded by a group of Mexican companions, playing a game  called monte. The absorbing interest taken in the cards had prevented  the inmates of the jacal from noticing the lady's approach until  she stood opposite the door. On the appearance of a woman, the game  instantly ceased. Recognition was mutual, but neither mother nor son  spoke a word. Her eye took in the surroundings at a glance. Finally  she spoke with a half-concealed imperiousness of tone, though her  voice was quiet and kindly.    \"Alexander, if you wish to see your mother, come to San Antonio, won't  you, please?\" and turning, she retraced her steps toward the carriage.    Her son arose from his squatting posture, hitching up one side of his  trousers, then the other, for he was suspenderless, and following at  a distance, scratching his head and hitching his trousers alternately,  he at last managed to say, \"Ah, well--why--if you can wait a few  moments till I change my clothes, I'll--I'll go with you right now.\"    This being consented to, he returned to the cabin, made the necessary  change, and stood before them a picture of health, bewhiskered and  bronzed like a pirate. As he was halfway to the vehicle, he turned  back, and taking the old black hands of Tiburcio in his own, said in  good Spanish, though there was a huskiness in his voice, \"That lady  is my mother. I may never see you again. I don't think I will. You may  have for your own everything I leave.\"    There were tears in the old hunter's eyes as he relinquished young  Wells's hands and watched him fade from his sight.

Attests, John Allyn Secy\"      \"It has been heretofore noted that during her trial--from the records of  which the foregoing testimony has been taken--the prisoner Mercy  Disborough was subjected to a search for witch marks by a committee of  women, faithfully sworn narrowly and truly to inspect and search. This  indignity was repeated, and the women agreed \"that there is found on her  boddy as before they found, and nothing else.\" But the accused in order  to her further detection was subjected to another test of English  parentage, recommended by the authorities and embodied in the criminal  codes. It was the notorious water test, or ordeal by water. September  15, 1692, this test was made, chiefly on the testimony of a young girl  subject to epileptic fits and hysterics, who was carried into the  meetinghouse where the examination was being held. Thus runs the record:      _Daniel Westcott's \"gerle\"--Scenes in the meeting house--\"Ye  girl\"--Mercy's voice--Usual paroxisme_    \"The afflicted person being carried into ye meeting house & Mercy  Disbrow being under examination by ye honable court & whilst she was  speaking ye girl came to her sences, & sd she heard Mercy Disbrow saying  withall where is she, endeavoring to raise herself, with her masters  help got almost up, in ye open view of present, & Mercy Disbrow looking  about on her, she immediately fel down into a fit again. A 2d time she  came to herself whilst in ye meeting house, & askd whers Mercy, I hear  her voice, & with that turned about her head (she lying with her face  from her) & lookd on her, then laying herself down in like posture as  before sd tis she, Ime sure tis she, & presently fell into a like  paroxisme or fit as she usually is troubled with.\"    Mercy Disborough, and another woman on trial at the same time  (Elizabeth Clauson), were put to the test together, and two eyewitnesses  of the sorry exhibition of cruelty and delusion made oath that they saw  Mercy and Elizabeth bound hand and foot and put into the water, and that  they swam upon the water like a cork, and when one labored to press them  into the water they buoyed up like cork.[G]    [Footnote G: Depositions of Abram Adams and Jonathan Squire, September  15, 1692.]      At the close of the trial the jury disagreed and the prisoner was  committed \"to the common goale there to be kept in safe custody till a  return may be made to the General Court for further direction what shall  be don in this matter;\" and the gentlemen of the jury were also to be  ready, when further called by direction of the General Court, to perfect  their verdict. The General Court ordered the Special Court to meet again  \"to put an issue to those former matters.\"    October 28, 1692, this entry appears of record:    \"The jury being called to make a return of their indictment that had  been committed to them concerning Mercy Disborough, they return that  they find the prisoner guilty according to the indictment of familiarity  with Satan. The jury being sent forth upon a second consideration of  their verdict returned that they saw no reason to alter their verdict,  but to find her guilty as before. The court approved of their verdict  and the Governor passed sentence of death upon her.\"    The hesitation of the jury to agree upon a verdict, the reference to the  General Court for more specific authority to act, all point to serious  question of the evidence, the motives of witnesses, the value of the  traditional and lawful tests of the guilt of the accused.    In the search for facts which the old records certify to at this late  day, one is deeply impressed by the wisdom and potency of the sober  afterthought and conclusions of some of the clergy, lawyers, and men of  affairs, who sat as judges and jurors in the witch trials, which led  them to weigh and analyze the evidence, spectral and otherwise, and so  call a halt in the prosecutions and convictions.    What some of the Massachusetts men did and said in the contemporaneous  outbreak at Salem has been shown, but nowhere is the reaction there more  clearly illustrated than in the statement of Reverend John  Hale--great-grandsire of Nathan Hale, the revolutionary hero--the long  time pastor at Beverly Farms, who from personal experience became  convinced of the grave errors at the Salem trials, and in his _Modest  Inquiry_ in 1697 said:    \"Such was the darkness of that day, the tortures and lamentations of the  afflicted, and the power of former precedents, that we walked in the  clouds and could not see our way.... observing the events of that sad  catastrophe,--Anno 1692,--I was brought to a more strict scanning of the  principles I had imbibed, and by scanning to question, and by  questioning at length to reject many of them.\" _Nathan Hale_ (p. 10),  Johnston.    But no utterance takes higher rank, or deserves more consideration in  its appeal to sanity, justice, and humanity, than the declaration of  certain ministers and laymen of Connecticut, in giving their advice and  \"reasons\" for a cessation of the prosecutions for witchcraft in the  colonial courts, and for reprieving Mercy Disborough under sentence of  death. This is the remarkable document:    \"Filed: The ministers aduice about the witches in Fayrfield, 1692.    \"As to ye evidences left to our consideration respecting ye two women  suspected of witchcraft at Fairfield we offer    \"1.
