The chief clue is afforded by the pottery (see below, V), sherds of  which, large and small, are strewn in considerable numbers on every  ancient site. Scarabs, seals, bronze implements, iron fragments,  beads, bone ornaments, and the like may also be noticed. A trained  eye is essential even for such surface finds: one man may walk over a  mound and find nothing, another may walk in his steps and gather  quite an interesting harvest of small objects.    Surface indications of buried buildings (or rather foundations) may  be noted both on the top and on the sides of a tell. Lines of wall  may not infrequently be traced. Often the vegetation growing on the  surface indicates the presence of structures underneath (either by  burnt-up patches amid luxuriant growths, or vice versa).    4. Surface exploration of a khirbet.  The task here is, generally sneaking, simpler. In a khirbet there is  usually no great depth of accumulation; indeed, the bare rock  frequently crops up in the middle of such a site. There is,  therefore, as a rule only one historical period represented.  Potsherds, coins (Roman, Jewish, Byzantine, early Islamic, sometimes  Crusader), tesserae of mosaic pavements, fragments of iron nails,  beads, minute metal ornaments (as bronze wire finger-rings) are to be  picked up on khirbet sites.    The remains of walls are usually more easily traceable in khirbet  than in tell sites, though much damage has been done by quarrying for  modern buildings. These walls should be carefully examined: buildings  other than mere houses (churches, synagogues, baths) may sometimes be  detected. Cisterns should be noted. Some of these are not very  obvious and the traveller should be on his guard against falling into  them.    All stones should be examined, as there is a chance of finding  inscriptions.    5. In all work on ancient sites the investigator must make a point of  noting everything, irrespective of its apparent importance, and of  carefully training a critical judgement in interpreting his  observations. It is impossible to lay down general principles that  govern every case completely: every site presents its own individual  problems.      III. Rock-cut Tombs.    1. All Palestine is honeycombed with rock-cut tombs, which form a  fascinating and inexhaustible field of study. Unfortunately all that  are in the least degree visible have long ago been rifled, and in  recent years those pests, the curio-hunting tourists, have done  incalculable harm by stimulating the native tomb-robber and dealer.    2. The explorer of rock-cut tombs must be indifferent to mud, damp,  evil smells, noxious insects, and other discomforts, and he must be  prepared to squeeze through very narrow passages, much clogged with  earth. He is recommended to be on his guard against scorpions and  snakes.    3. A plan and vertical section of the tomb should be drawn. The  measurements should be taken carefully, not only for the sake of the  accuracy of the plan, but also for metrological purposes.    4. The rock outside the entrance of the tomb-chamber should be  examined. It often shows rebating or other cutting, designed to  receive the foundations of a masonry mausoleum (resembling in general  style the rock-hewn monuments in the Kedron Valley at Jerusalem). As  a rule such structures have been entirely destroyed for the sake of  their stones.    5. The tool-marks of the tomb-quarriers should be examined, as they  sometimes reveal interesting technical points.    6. Every inch of the surface of the excavation, inside and out, must  be examined for ornaments, symbols, or inscriptions. These may be  either cut or painted, and often are very inconspicuous. Ornaments  are usually floral in type, though in late tombs figure-subjects are  occasionally to be found. Symbols are either Jewish (the seven-  branched candlestick) or Christian (the cross, A-omega, or the like).  Inscriptions are not necessarily formally cut: they are sometimes  mere scratched graffiti, which would be sure to escape notice unless  carefully looked for (as in the so-called 'Tombs of the Prophets' on  the Mount of Olives).    7. Dating of tombs.  The savage rifling to which Palestinian tombs have been subjected has  much reduced the material available for dating them. The following  general principles apply to Southern Palestine: those in Northern  Palestine and Syria still await a more exact study:    The earliest tombs known in the country were mere natural caves, into  which the dead were cast, often very unceremoniously.    In the Second Semitic Period (circa 1800-1400 B.C.) hewn chambers  began to be used. These are in the form of cylindrical shafts with a  doorway at the bottom leading sideways into the burial-chamber.  Natural caves are still frequently used.    In the Third Semitic Period (circa 1400-1000 B.C.) the shaft: form  disappears and an artificial cave, rudely hewn out, takes its place.  The entrance is in the side of the chamber, though not necessarily at  the level of the floor. Rude shelves for the reception of the bodies  are sometimes, but not always, cut in the sides of the chamber.    In the Fourth Semitic Period (circa 1000-550 B.C.) the tomb-  chambers are of the same kind, but are as a rule smaller.    In Southern Palestine the well-made tomb-chambers, such as are to be  seen in great numbers around Jerusalem, are all post-exilic. There is  an immense variety in plan, some tombs being single chambers, others  complications of several chambers. The late excavation absurdly  called the 'Tombs of the Kings' at Jerusalem is quite a labyrinth of  rockcut chambers. In exploring such a structure a careful search  should be made for devices for deluding thieves: special precautions  are sometimes taken to conceal the entrance to inner groups of  chambers. There are some interesting examples of this in the cemetery  in the _Wadi er-Rababi_, south of Jerusalem. However, all tombs of  this period fall into two groups, _kok_ tombs and _arcosolium_ tombs.  In the former the receptacles for bodies are of the kind known by the  Hebrew name _kokim_--shafts, of a size to accommodate one body  (sometimes large enough for two or three) driven horizontally into  the wall of the chamber. In the normal _kok_ tomb-chamber there are  nine _kokim_, three in each wall except the wall containing the  entrance doorway. But there are many other arrangements. In the  'Tombs of the Judges' there is a double row of _kokim_ in the  entrance chamber. The explorer should not forget that a _kok_  sometimes contains a secret entrance to further chambers at its inner  end. In _arcosolium_ tombs the receptacles are benches cut in the  wall, like the berths in a steamer's cabin. These are sometimes sunk,  so as to resemble rock-cut sarcophagi.    The late tombs round Jerusalem are in the form of caves driven  horizontally into the hill-sides. Further south, e.g. in the region  round Beit Jibrin, they are more frequently sunk vertically, the  entrance being in the roof of the burial chamber, or approached by a  square shaft (a reversion to the Second Semitic form, except that  these latter have _round_ shafts).      IV. Caves.  The history of the artificial caves hewn in the soft limestone of  Palestine, is quite unknown. The caves of the neighbourhood of Beit  Jibrin provide ample material for several months' exploration.    Though the caves are labyrinthine there is little fear of an explorer  losing his way: he should, however, be well provided with lights, as  it would be extremely awkward to be left in the innermost recess of a  cave consisting of ten or a dozen chambers united by narrow creep-  passages, without adequate illumination. There are occasionally  unexpected and dangerous pitfalls: and hyenas and serpents often  shelter in the caves. The present writer has explored many of them  entirely alone, but this is, on the whole, not to be recommended.    Besides planning the cave, its walls should be searched for  inscriptions, &c. It should be remembered, however, that these may  have been added at any time and do not necessarily belong to the  original excavation. Symbols, apparently of a phallic nature, are  sometimes cut on the walls, as well as crosses and other Christian  devices, and Cufic inscriptions. Frequently the walls are pitted with  the loculi of a columbarium, which, however, appear to be too small  to receive cinerary urns and must be intended for some other purpose.      V. Pottery.     Owing to the importance of the subject a special section on Pottery  is given here, and the two accompanying plates (XII) show some of the  commonest types of vessels. But the student cannot learn all he will  need to know of Palestinian pottery from a few pages of print. A  representative series of specimens will be found in the Jerusalem  Museum: he may supplement his study of these by the perusal of  reports on excavations, such as Petrie, _Tell el-Hesy_ (pp. 40-50);  Bliss, _A Mound of Many Cities_ (passim); _Excavations in Palestine_  (pp. 71-141); Macalister, _Excavation of Gezer_ (vol. ii, pp.  128-239; and plates); Sellin, _Jericho_; Schumacher, _Tell  et-Mutasellim_.    Pre-Semitic Period (down to circa 2000 B.C.).  Ware hand-modelled, without wheel, coarse, gritty, and generally  soft-baked and very porous. The section of a clean fracture is  usually of a dirty yellowish colour, resembling in appearance coarse  oatmeal porridge. Bases usually flat, loop-handles or wavy handles on  the bodies of the vessels: mouths wide and lips curved outward. The  body of the vessel often decorated with drip lines or with a criss-  cross, in red paint.    First Semitic Period (circa 2000-1800 B.C.).  Similar to the last: but the potter's wheel is used, and horizontal  painted and moulded rope-like ornament also found. Combed ornament  and burnished lines frequent.

One of the women slaves had been  very sick and she was unable to work just as fast as he thought she  ought to. He had driven her all day with no results. That night after  completeing our work he called us all together. He made me hold a light,  while he whipped her and then made one of the slaves pour salt water on  her bleeding back. My innerds turn yet at that sight.    \"At the beginning of the Civil War I was still at this place as a slave.  It looked at the first of the war as if the south would win, as most of  the big battles were won by the South. This was because we slaves stayed  at home and tended the farms and kept their families.    \"To eliminate this solid support of the South, the Emancipation Act was  passed, freeing all slaves. Most of the slaves were so ignorant they did  not realize they were free. The planters knew this and as Kentucky never  seceeded from the Union, they would send slaves into Kentucky from other  states in the south and hire them out to plantations. For these reasons  I did not realize that I was free untill 1864. I immediately resolved to  run away and join the Union Army and so my brother and I went to  Owensburg, Ky. and tried to join. My brother was taken, but I was  refused as being too young. I [HW: tried] at Evansville, Terre Haute and  Indianapolis but was unable to get in. I then tried to find work and was  finally hired by a man at $7.00 a month. That was my first independent  job. From then on I went from one job to another working as general  laborer.    \"I married at 24 years of age and had four children. My wife has been  dead for 12 years and 8 months. Mr. Miller, always remember that:      \"The brightest man, the prettiest flower     May be cut down, and withered in an hour.\"    \"Today, I am the only surviving member who helped organize the second  Baptist Church here in Lafayette, 64 years ago. I've tried to live  according to the way the Lord would wish, God Bless you.\"      \"The clock of Life is wound but once.     Today is yours, tomorrow is not.     No one knows when the hands will stop.\"          Cecil Miller  Dist. #3  Tipp. Co. [TR: Tippecanoe Co.]    NEGRO FOLKLORE  MR. JOHN FIELDS, EX-SLAVE  2120 N. 20th St. Lafayette, Indiana    [Illustration: John W. Fields]      Mr. Fields says that all negro slaves were ardent believers in ghosts,  supernatual powers, tokens and \"signs.\" The following story illustrates  the point.    \"A turkey gobbler had mysteriously disappeared from one of the  neighboring plantations and the local slaves were accused of commeting  the fowl to a boiling pot. A slave convicted of theft was punished  severly. As all of the slaves denied any knowledge of the turkey's  whereabouts, they were instructed to make a search of the entire  plantation.\"    \"On one part of the place there was a large peach orchard. At the time  the trees were full of the green fruit. Under one of the trees there was  a large cabinet or \"safe\" as they were called. One of the slaves  accidently opened the safe and, Behold, there was Mr. Gobbler peacefully  seated on a number of green peaches.    \"The negro immediately ran back and notified his master of the  discovery. The master returned to the orchard with the slave to find  that the negro's wild tale was true. A turkey gobbler sitting on a nest  of green peaches. A bad omen.    \"The master had a son who had been seriously injured some time before by  a runaway team, and a few days after this unusual occurence with the  turkey, the son died. After his death, the word of the turkey's nesting  venture and the death of the master's son spread to this four winds,  and for some time after this story was related wherever there was a  public gathering with the white people or the slave population.\"    All through the south a horseshoe was considered an omen of good luck.  Rare indeed was the southern home that did not have one nailed over the  door. This insured the household and all who entered of plesant  prospects while within the home. If while in the home you should perhaps  get into a violent argument, never hit the other party with a broom as  it was a sure indication of bad luck. If Grandad had the rheumatics, he  would be sure of relief if he carried a buckeye in his pocket.    Of all the Ten Commandments, the one broken most by the negro was: Thou  Shalt Not Steal This was due mostly to the insufficent food the slaves  obtained. Most of the planters expected a chicken to suddenly get  heavenly aspirations once in a while, but as Mr. Fields says, \"When a  beautiful 250 pound hog suddenly tries to kidnap himself, the planter  decided to investigate.\" It occured like this:    A 250 pound hog had been fruitless. The planter was certain that the  culprit was among his group of slaves, so he decided to personally  conduct a quiet investigation.    One night shortly after the moon had risen in the sky, two of the  negroes were seated at a table in one of the cabins talking of the  experiences of the day. A knock sounded on the door. Both slaves jumped  up and cautiously peeked out of the window. Lo there was the master  patiently waiting for an answer. The visiting negro decided that the  master must not see both of them and he asked the other to conceal him  while the master was there. The other slave told him to climb into the  attic and be perfectly quiet. When this was done, the tenant of the  cabin answered the door.    The master strode in and gazed about the cabin. He then turned abruptly  to the slave and growled, 'Alright, where is that hog you stoled.'  'Massa, replied the negro, 'I know nothing about no hog. The master was  certain that the slave was lying and told him so in no uncertain terms.  The terrified slave said, 'Massa, I know nothing of any hog. I never  seed him. The Good Man up above knows I never seed him. HE knows every  thing and HE knows I didn't steal him; The man in the attic by this time  was aroused at the misunderstood conversation taking place below him.  Disregarding all, he raised his voice and yelled, 'He's a liar, Massa,  he knows just as much about it as I do.'    Most of the strictly negro folklore has faded into the past. The younger  negro generations who have been reared and educated in the north have  lost this bearing and assumed the lore of the local white population  through their daily contact with the whites. The older negro natives of  this section are for the most part employed as domestics and through  this channel rapidly assimilated the employers viewpoint in most of his  beliefs and conversations.          Ex-Slave Stories  District 5  Vanderburgh County  Lauana Creel    INDIANS MADE SLAVES AMONG THE NEGROES.  INTERVIEWS WITH GEORGE FORTMAN  Cor. Bellemeade Ave. and Garvin St.  Evansville, Indiana, and other interested citizens      \"The story of my life, I will tell to you with sincerest respect to all  and love to many, although reviewing the dark trail of my childhood and  early youth causes me great pain.\" So spoke George Fortman, an aged man  and former slave, although the history of his life reveals that no Negro  blood runs through his veins.    \"My story necessarily begins by relating events which occurred in 1838,  when hundreds of Indians were rounded up like cattle and driven away  from the valley of the Wabash. It is a well known fact recorded in the  histories of Indiana that the long journey from the beautiful Wabash  Valley was a horrible experience for the fleeing Indians, but I have the  tradition as relating to my own family, and from this enforced flight  ensued the tragedy of my birth.\"    The aged ex-slave reviews tradition. \"My two ancestors, John Hawk, a  Blackhawk Indian brave, and Racheal, a Chackatau maiden had made  themselves a home such as only Indians know, understand and enjoy. He  was a hunter and a fighter but had professed faith in Christ through the  influence of the missionaries. My greatgrandmother passed the facts on  to her children and they have been handed down for four generations. I,  in turn, have given the traditions to my children and grandchildren.    \"No more peaceful home had ever offered itself to the red man than the  beautiful valley of the Wabash river. Giant elms, sycamores and maple  trees bordered the stream while the fertile valley was traversed with  creeks and rills, furnishing water in abundance for use of the Indian  campers.    \"The Indians and the white settlers in the valley transacted business  with each other and were friendly towards each other, as I have been  told by my mother, Eliza, and my grandmother, Courtney Hawk.    \"The missionaries often called the Indian families together for the  purpose of teaching them and the Indians had been invited, prior to  being driven from the valley, to a sort of festival in the woods. They  had prepared much food for the occasion. The braves had gone on a long  hunt to provide meat and the squaws had prepared much corn and other  grain to be used at the feast. All the tribes had been invited to a  council and the poor people were happy, not knowing they were being  deceived.    \"The decoy worked, for while the Indians were worshiping God the meeting  was rudely interrupted by orders of the Governor of the State. The  Governor, whose duty it was to give protection to the poor souls,  caused them to be taken captives and driven away at the point of swords  and guns.    \"In vain, my grandmother said, the Indians prayed to be let return to  their homes. Instead of being given their liberty, some several hundred  horses and ponies were captured to be used in transporting the Indians  away from the valley. Many of the aged Indians and many innocent  children died on the long journey and traditional stories speak of that  journey as the 'trail of death.'\"    \"After long weeks of flight, when the homes of the Indians had been  reduced to ashes, the long trail still carried them away from their "]]]
