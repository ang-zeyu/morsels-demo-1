Death and pain of every kind  were fully represented in that gruesome collection.    That it had a fascination for Oolanga goes without saying.  He was never  tired of visiting the museum in the tower, and spent endless hours in  inspecting the exhibits, till he was thoroughly familiar with every  detail of all of them.  He asked permission to clean and polish and  sharpen them--a favour which was readily granted.  In addition to the  above objects, there were many things of a kind to awaken human fear.  Stuffed serpents of the most objectionable and horrid kind; giant insects  from the tropics, fearsome in every detail; fishes and crustaceans  covered with weird spikes; dried octopuses of great size.  Other things,  too, there were, not less deadly though seemingly innocuous--dried fungi,  traps intended for birds, beasts, fishes, reptiles, and insects; machines  which could produce pain of any kind and degree, and the only mercy of  which was the power of producing speedy death.    Caswall, who had never before seen any of these things, except those  which he had collected himself, found a constant amusement and interest  in them.  He studied them, their uses, their mechanism--where there was  such--and their places of origin, until he had an ample and real  knowledge of all concerning them.  Many were secret and intricate, but he  never rested till he found out all the secrets.  When once he had become  interested in strange objects, and the way to use them, he began to  explore various likely places for similar finds.  He began to inquire of  his household where strange lumber was kept.  Several of the men spoke of  old Simon Chester as one who knew everything in and about the house.  Accordingly, he sent for the old man, who came at once.  He was very old,  nearly ninety years of age, and very infirm.  He had been born in the  Castle, and had served its succession of masters--present or absent--ever  since.  When Edgar began to question him on the subject regarding which  he had sent for him, old Simon exhibited much perturbation.  In fact, he  became so frightened that his master, fully believing that he was  concealing something, ordered him to tell at once what remained unseen,  and where it was hidden away.  Face to face with discovery of his secret,  the old man, in a pitiable state of concern, spoke out even more fully  than Mr. Caswall had expected.    \"Indeed, indeed, sir, everything is here in the tower that has ever been  put away in my time except--except--\" here he began to shake and tremble  it--\"except the chest which Mr. Edgar--he who was Mr. Edgar when I first  took service--brought back from France, after he had been with Dr.  Mesmer.  The trunk has been kept in my room for safety; but I shall send  it down here now.\"    \"What is in it?\" asked Edgar sharply.    \"That I do not know.  Moreover, it is a peculiar trunk, without any  visible means of opening.\"    \"Is there no lock?\"    \"I suppose so, sir; but I do not know.  There is no keyhole.\"    \"Send it here; and then come to me yourself.\"    The trunk, a heavy one with steel bands round it, but no lock or keyhole,  was carried in by two men.  Shortly afterwards old Simon attended his  master.  When he came into the room, Mr. Caswall himself went and closed  the door; then he asked:    \"How do you open it?\"    \"I do not know, sir.\"    \"Do you mean to say that you never opened it?\"    \"Most certainly I say so, your honour.  How could I?  It was entrusted to  me with the other things by my master.  To open it would have been a  breach of trust.\"    Caswall sneered.    \"Quite remarkable!  Leave it with me.  Close the door behind you.  Stay--did no one ever tell you about it--say anything regarding it--make  any remark?\"    Old Simon turned pale, and put his trembling hands together.    \"Oh, sir, I entreat you not to touch it.  That trunk probably contains  secrets which Dr. Mesmer told my master.  Told them to his ruin!\"    \"How do you mean?  What ruin?\"    \"Sir, he it was who, men said, sold his soul to the Evil One; I had  thought that that time and the evil of it had all passed away.\"    \"That will do.  Go away; but remain in your own room, or within call.  I  may want you.\"    The old man bowed deeply and went out trembling, but without speaking a  word.          CHAPTER XII--THE CHEST OPENED      Left alone in the turret-room, Edgar Caswall carefully locked the door  and hung a handkerchief over the keyhole.  Next, he inspected the  windows, and saw that they were not overlooked from any angle of the main  building.  Then he carefully examined the trunk, going over it with a  magnifying glass.  He found it intact: the steel bands were flawless; the  whole trunk was compact.  After sitting opposite to it for some time, and  the shades of evening beginning to melt into darkness, he gave up the  task and went to his bedroom, after locking the door of the turret-room  behind him and taking away the key.    He woke in the morning at daylight, and resumed his patient but  unavailing study of the metal trunk.  This he continued during the whole  day with the same result--humiliating disappointment, which overwrought  his nerves and made his head ache.  The result of the long strain was  seen later in the afternoon, when he sat locked within the turret-room  before the still baffling trunk, distrait, listless and yet agitated,  sunk in a settled gloom.  As the dusk was falling he told the steward to  send him two men, strong ones.  These he ordered to take the trunk to his  bedroom.  In that room he then sat on into the night, without pausing  even to take any food.  His mind was in a whirl, a fever of excitement.  The result was that when, late in the night, he locked himself in his  room his brain was full of odd fancies; he was on the high road to mental  disturbance.  He lay down on his bed in the dark, still brooding over the  mystery of the closed trunk.    Gradually he yielded to the influences of silence and darkness.  After  lying there quietly for some time, his mind became active again.  But  this time there were round him no disturbing influences; his brain was  active and able to work freely and to deal with memory.  A thousand  forgotten--or only half-known--incidents, fragments of conversations or  theories long ago guessed at and long forgotten, crowded on his mind.  He  seemed to hear again around him the legions of whirring wings to which he  had been so lately accustomed.  Even to himself he knew that that was an  effort of imagination founded on imperfect memory.  But he was content  that imagination should work, for out of it might come some solution of  the mystery which surrounded him.  And in this frame of mind, sleep made  another and more successful essay.  This time he enjoyed peaceful  slumber, restful alike to his wearied body and his overwrought brain.    In his sleep he arose, and, as if in obedience to some influence beyond  and greater than himself, lifted the great trunk and set it on a strong  table at one side of the room, from which he had previously removed a  quantity of books.  To do this, he had to use an amount of strength which  was, he knew, far beyond him in his normal state.  As it was, it seemed  easy enough; everything yielded before his touch.  Then he became  conscious that somehow--how, he never could remember--the chest was open.  He unlocked his door, and, taking the chest on his shoulder, carried it  up to the turret-room, the door of which also he unlocked.  Even at the  time he was amazed at his own strength, and wondered whence it had come.  His mind, lost in conjecture, was too far off to realise more immediate  things.  He knew that the chest was enormously heavy.  He seemed, in a  sort of vision which lit up the absolute blackness around, to see the two  sturdy servant men staggering under its great weight.  He locked himself  again in the turret-room, and laid the opened chest on a table, and in  the darkness began to unpack it, laying out the contents, which were  mainly of metal and glass--great pieces in strange forms--on another  table.  He was conscious of being still asleep, and of acting rather in  obedience to some unseen and unknown command than in accordance with any  reasonable plan, to be followed by results which he understood.  This  phase completed, he proceeded to arrange in order the component parts of  some large instruments, formed mostly of glass.  His fingers seemed to  have acquired a new and exquisite subtlety and even a volition of their  own.  Then weariness of brain came upon him; his head sank down on his  breast, and little by little everything became wrapped in gloom.    He awoke in the early morning in his bedroom, and looked around him, now  clear-headed, in amazement.  In its usual place on the strong table stood  the great steel-hooped chest without lock or key.  But it was now locked.  He arose quietly and stole to the turret-room.  There everything was as  it had been on the previous evening.  He looked out of the window where  high in air flew, as usual, the giant kite.  He unlocked the wicket gate  of the turret stair and went out on the roof.  Close to him was the great  coil of cord on its reel.  It was humming in the morning breeze, and when  he touched the string it sent a quick thrill through hand and arm.  There  was no sign anywhere that there had been any disturbance or displacement  of anything during the night.    Utterly bewildered, he sat down in his room to think.  Now for the first  time he _felt_ that he was asleep and dreaming.  Presently he fell asleep  again, and slept for a long time.  He awoke hungry and made a hearty  meal.  Then towards evening, having locked himself in, he fell asleep  again.  When he woke he was in darkness, and was quite at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],[0,"Ronicky Doone (#13)"],[1,"a moment's thought.  \"And, outside of that, I suppose a girl will fight the hardest to  marry the gent she loves.\"    \"And to keep from marrying a man she doesn't love, as she'd try to  keep from death?\"    \"Sure,\" said Ronicky. \"But these days a girl don't have to marry that  way.\"    \"I am going to marry the man with the sneer,\" she said simply enough,  and with dull, patient eyes she watched the face of Ronicky wrinkle  and grow pale, as if a heavy fist had struck him.    \"You?\" he asked. \"You marry him?\"    \"Yes,\" she whispered.    \"And you hate the thought of him!\"    \"I--I don't know. He's kind--\"    \"You hate him,\" insisted Ronicky. \"And he's to have you, that  cold-eyed snake, that devil of a man?\" He moved a little, and she  turned toward him, smiling faintly and allowing the light to come more  clearly and fully on her face. \"You're meant for a king o' men, lady;  you got the queen in you--it's in the lift of your head. When you find  the gent you can love, why, lady, he'll be pretty near the richest man  in the world!\"    The ghost of a flush bloomed in her cheeks, but her faint smile did  not alter, and she seemed to be hearing him from far away. \"The man  with the sneer,\" she said at length, \"will never talk to me like that,  and still--I shall marry him.\"    \"Tell me your name,\" said Ronicky Doone bluntly.    \"My name is Ruth Tolliver.\"    \"Listen to me, Ruth Tolliver: If you was to live a thousand years, and  the gent with the smile was to keep going for two thousand, it'd never  come about that he could ever marry you.\"    She shook her head, still watching him as from a distance.    \"If I've crossed the country and followed a hard trail and come here  tonight and stuck my head in a trap, as you might say, for the sake of  a gent like Bill Gregg--fine fellow though he is--what d'you think I  would do to keep a girl like you from life-long misery?\"    And he dwelt on the last word until the girl shivered.    \"It's what it means,\" said Ronicky Doone, \"life-long misery for you.  And it won't happen--it can't happen.\"    \"Are you mad--are you quite mad?\" asked the girl. \"What on earth have  I and my affairs got to do with you? Who are you?\"    \"I dunno,\" said Ronicky Doone. \"I suppose you might say I'm a champion  of lost causes, lady. Why have I got something to do with you? I'll  tell you why: Because, when a girl gets past being just pretty and  starts in being plumb beautiful, she lays off being the business of  any one gent--her father or her brother--she starts being the business  of the whole world. You see? They come like that about one in ten  million, and I figure you're that one, lady.\"    The far away smile went out. She was looking at him now with a sort of  sad wonder. \"Do you know what I am?\" she said gravely.    \"I dunno,\" said Ronicky, \"and I don't care. What you do don't count.  It's the inside that matters, and the inside of you is all right.  Lady, so long as I can sling a gun, and so long as my name is Ronicky  Doone, you ain't going to marry the gent with the smile.\"    If he expected an outbreak of protest from her he was mistaken. For  what she said was: \"Ronicky Doone! Is that the name? Ronicky Doone!\"  Then she smiled up at him. \"I'm within one ace of being foolish and  saying--But I won't.\"    She made a gesture of brushing a mist away from her and then stepped  back a little. \"I'm going down to see the man with the smile, and I'm  going to tell him that Harry Morgan is not in his room, that he didn't  answer my knock, and then that I looked around through the house and  didn't find him. After that I'm coming back here, Ronicky Doone, and  I'm going to try to get an opportunity for you to talk to Caroline  Smith.\"    \"I knew you'd change your mind,\" said Ronicky Doone.    \"I'll even tell you why,\" she said. \"It isn't for your friend who's  asleep, but it's to give you a chance to finish this business and come  to the end of this trail and go back to your own country. Because,  if you stay around here long, there'll be trouble, a lot of trouble,  Ronicky Doone. Now stay here and wait for me. If anyone taps at the  door, you'd better slip into that closet in the corner. Will you  wait?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And you'll trust me?\"    \"To the end of the trail, lady.\"    She smiled at him again and was gone.    Now the house was perfectly hushed. He went to the window and looked  down to the quiet street with all its atmosphere of some old New  England village and eternal peace. It seemed impossible that in the  house behind him there were--    He caught his breath. Somewhere in the house the muffled sound of a  struggle rose. He ran to the door, thinking of Ruth Tolliver at once,  and then he shrank back again, for a door was slammed open, and a  voice shouted--the voice of a man: \"Help! Harrison! Lefty! Jerry!\"    Other voices answered far away; footfalls began to sound. Ronicky  Doone knew that Harry Morgan, his victim, had at last recovered and  managed to work the cords off his feet or hands, or both.    Ronicky stepped back close to the door of the closet and waited. It  would mean a search, probably, this discovery that Morgan had been  struck down in his own room by an unknown intruder. And a search  certainly would be started at once. First there was confusion, and  then a clear, musical man's voice began to give orders: \"Harrison,  take the cellar. Lefty, go up to the roof. The rest of you take the  rooms one by one.\"    The search was on.    \"Don't ask questions,\" was the last instruction. \"When you see someone  you don't know, shoot on sight, and shoot to kill. I'll do the  explaining to the police--you know that. Now scatter, and the man who  brings him down I'll remember. Quick!\"    There was a new scurry of footfalls. Ronicky Doone heard them approach  the door of the girl's room, and he slipped into the closet. At once a  cloud of soft, cool silks brushed about him, and he worked back until  his shoulders had touched the wall at the back of the closet. Luckily  the enclosure was deep, and the clothes were hanging thickly from the  racks. It was sufficient to conceal him from any careless searcher,  but it would do no good if any one probed; and certainly these men  were not the ones to search carelessly.    In the meantime it was a position which made Ronicky grind his teeth.  To be found skulking among woman's clothes in a closet--to be dragged  out and stuck in the back, no doubt, like a rat, and thrown into the  river, that was an end for Ronicky Doone indeed!    He was on the verge of slipping out and making a mad break for the  door of the house and trying to escape by taking the men by surprise,  when he heard the door of the girl's room open.    \"Some ex-pugilist,\" he heard a man's voice saying, and he recognized  it at once as belonging to him who had given the orders. He  recognized, also, that it must be the man with the sneer.    \"You think he was an amateur robber and an expert prize fighter?\"  asked Ruth Tolliver.    It seemed to Ronicky Doone that her voice was perfectly controlled  and calm. Perhaps it was her face that betrayed emotion, for after a  moment of silence, the man answered.    \"What's the matter? You're as nervous as a child tonight, Ruth?\"    \"Isn't there reason enough to make me nervous?\" she demanded. \"A  robber--Heaven knows what--running at large in the house?\"    \"H'm!\" murmured the man. \"Devilish queer that you should get so  excited all at once. No, it's something else. I've trained you too  well for you to go to pieces like this over nothing. What is it,  Ruth?\"    There was no answer. Then the voice began again, silken-smooth and  gentle, so gentle and kindly that Ronicky Doone started. \"In the old  days you used to keep nothing from me; we were companions, Ruth. That  was when you were a child. Now that you are a woman, when you feel  more, think more, see more, when our companionship should be like a  running stream, continually bringing new things into my life, I find  barriers between us. Why is it, my dear?\"    Still there was no answer. The pulse of Ronicky Doone began to  quicken, as though the question had been asked him, as though he  himself were fumbling for the answer.    \"Let us talk more freely,\" went on the man. \"Try to open your mind to  me. There are things which you dislike in me; I know it. Just what  those things are I cannot tell, but we must break down these foolish  little barriers which are appearing more and more every day. Not  that I mean to intrude myself on you every moment of your life. You  understand that, of course?\"    \"Of course,\" said the girl faintly.    \"And I understand perfectly that you have passed out of childhood into  young womanhood, and that is a dreamy time for a girl. Her body is  formed at last, but her mind is only half formed. There is a pleasant  mist over it. Very well, I don't wish to brush the mist away. If I  did that I would take half that charm away from you--that elusive  incompleteness which Fragonard and Watteau tried to imitate, Heaven  knows with how little success. No, I shall always let you live your  own life. All that I ask for, my dear, are certain meeting places. Let  us establish them before it is too late, or you will find one day that  you have married an old man, and we shall have silent dinners. There  is nothing more wretched than that. If it should come about, then you  will begin to look on me as a jailer. And--\"    \"Don't!\"    \"Ah,\" said he very tenderly, \"I knew that I was feeling toward the  truth. You are shrinking from me, Ruth, because you feel that I am too  old.\"    \"No, no!\"    Here a hand pounded heavily on the door.    \"The idiots have found something,\" said the man of the sneer. \"And now  they have come to talk about their cleverness, like a rooster crowing  over a grain of corn.\" He raised his voice. \"Come in!\"    And Ronicky Doone heard a panting voice a moment later exclaim: \"We've  got him!\"          Chapter Twelve      _The Strange "]]]
