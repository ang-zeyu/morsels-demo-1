Deal thus with children, thus with wife; thus  with office, thus with wealth--and one day thou wilt be meet to share  the Banquets of the Gods. But if thou dost not so much as touch that  which is placed before thee, but despisest it, then shalt thou not only  share the Banquets of the Gods, but their Empire also.          CLX    Remember that thou art an actor in a play, and of such sort as the  Author chooses, whether long or short. If it be his good pleasure to  assign thee the part of a beggar, a ruler, or a simple citizen, thine it  is to play it fitly. For thy business is to act the part assigned thee,  well: to choose it, is another's.          CLXI    Keep death and exile daily before thine eyes, with all else that men  deem terrible, but more especially Death. Then wilt thou never think a  mean though, nor covet anything beyond measure.          CLXII    As a mark is not set up in order to be missed, so neither is such a  thing as natural evil produced in the World.          CLXIII    Piety toward the Gods, to be sure, consists chiefly in thinking rightly  concerning them--that they are, and that they govern the Universe with  goodness and justice; and that thou thyself art appointed to obey them,  and to submit under all circumstances that arise; acquiescing cheerfully  in whatever may happen, sure it is brought to pass and accomplished by  the most Perfect Understanding. Thus thou wilt never find fault with the  Gods, nor charge them with neglecting thee.          CLXIV    Lose no time in setting before you a certain stamp of character and  behaviour both when by yourself and in company with others. Let silence  be your general rule; or say only what is necessary and in few words. We  shall, however, when occasion demands, enter into discourse sparingly.  avoiding common topics as gladiators, horse-races, athletes; and  the perpetual talk about food and drink. Above all avoid speaking of  persons, either in way of praise or blame, or comparison.    If you can, win over the conversation of your company to what it should  be by your own. But if you find yourself cut off without escape among  strangers and aliens, be silent.          CLXV    Laughter should not be much, nor frequent, nor unrestrained.          CLXVI    Refuse altogether to take an oath if you can, if not, as far as may be.          CLXVII    Banquets of the unlearned and of them that are without, avoid. But  if you have occasion to take part in them, let not your attention be  relaxed for a moment, lest you slip after all into evil ways. For you  may rest assured that be a man ever so pure himself, he cannot escape  defilement if his associates are impure.          CLXVIII    Take what relates to the body as far as the bare use warrants--as meat,  drink, raiment, house and servants. But all that makes for show and  luxury reject.          CLXIX    If you are told that such an one speaks ill of you, make no defence  against what was said, but answer, He surely knew not my other faults,  else he would not have mentioned these only!          CLXX    When you visit any of those in power, bethink yourself that you will not  find him in: that you may not be admitted: that the door may be shut in  your face: that he may not concern himself about you. If with all this,  it is your duty to go, bear what happens, and never say to yourself,  It was not worth the trouble! For that would smack of the foolish and  unlearned who suffer outward things to touch them.          CLXXI    In company avoid frequent and undue talk about your own actions and  dangers. However pleasant it may be to you to enlarge upon the risks  you have run, others may not find such pleasure in listening to your  adventures. Avoid provoking laughter also: it is a habit from which  one easily slides into the ways of the foolish, and apt to diminish the  respect which your neighbors feel for you. To border on coarse talk is  also dangerous. On such occasions, if a convenient opportunity offer,  rebuke the speaker. If not, at least by relapsing into silence,  colouring, and looking annoyed, show that you are displeased with the  subject.          CLXXII    When you have decided that a thing ought to be done, and are doing it,  never shun being seen doing it, even though the multitude should be  likely to judge the matter amiss. For if you are not acting rightly,  shun the act itself; if rightly, however, why fear misplaced censure?          CLXXIII    It stamps a man of mean capacity to spend much time on the things of the  body, as to be long over bodily exercises, long over eating, long over  drinking, long over other bodily functions. Rather should these  things take the second place, while all your care is directed to the  understanding.          CLXXIV    Everything has two handles, one by which it may be borne, the other by  which it may not. If your brother sin against you lay not hold of it by  the handle of injustice, for by that it may not be borne: but rather by  this, that he is your brother, the comrade of your youth; and thus you  will lay hold on it so that it may be borne.          CLXXV    Never call yourself a Philosopher nor talk much among the unlearned  about Principles, but do that which follows from them. Thus at a  banquet, do not discuss how people ought to eat; but eat as you ought.  Remember that Socrates thus entirely avoided ostentation. Men would come  to him desiring to be recommended to philosophers, and he would conduct  them thither himself--so well did he bear being overlooked. Accordingly  if any talk concerning principles should arise among the unlearned, be  you for the most part silent. For you run great risk of spewing up what  you have ill digested. And when a man tells you that you know nothing  and you are not nettled at it, then you may be sure that you have begun  the work.          CLXXVI    When you have brought yourself to supply the needs of the body at small  cost, do not pique yourself on that, nor if you drink only water, keep  saying on each occasion, I drink water! And if you ever want to practise  endurance and toil, do so unto yourself and not unto others--do not  embrace statues!          CLXXVII    When a man prides himself on being able to understand and interpret the  writings of Chrysippus, say to yourself:--    If Chrysippus had not written obscurely, this fellow would have had  nothing to be proud of. But what is it that I desire? To understand  Nature, and to follow her! Accordingly I ask who is the Interpreter.  On hearing that it is Chrysippus, I go to him. But it seems I do not  understand what he wrote. So I seek one to interpret that. So far there  is nothing to pride myself on. But when I have found my interpreter,  what remains is to put in practice his instructions. This itself is the  only thing to be proud of. But if I admire the interpretation and that  alone, what else have I turned out but a mere commentator instead of  a lover of wisdom?--except indeed that I happen to be interpreting  Chrysippus instead of Homer. So when any one says to me, Prithee, read  me Chrysippus, I am more inclined to blush, when I cannot show my deeds  to be in harmony and accordance with his sayings.          CLXXVIII    At feasts, remember that you are entertaining two guests, body and soul.  What you give to the body, you presently lose; what you give to the  soul, you keep for ever.          CLXXIX    At meals, see to it that those who serve be not more in number than  those who are served. It is absurd for a crowd of persons to be dancing  attendance on half a dozen chairs.          CLXXX    It is best to share with your attendants what is going forward, both in  the labour of preparation and in the enjoyment of the feast itself. If  such a thing be difficult at the time, recollect that you who are  not weary are being served by those that are; you who are eating and  drinking by those who do neither; you who are talking by those who are  silent; you who are at ease by those who are under constraint. Thus no  sudden wrath will betray you into unreasonable conduct, nor will you  behave harshly by irritating another.          CLXXXI    When Xanthippe was chiding Socrates for making scanty preparation for  entertaining his friends, he answered:--\"If they are friends of ours  they will not care for that; if they are not, we shall care nothing for  them!\"          CLXXXII    Asked, Who is the rich man? Epictetus replied, \"He who is content.\"          CLXXXIII    Favorinus tells us how Epictetus would also say that there were two  faults far graver and fouler than any others--inability to bear, and  inability to forbear, when we neither patiently bear the blows that  must be borne, nor abstain from the things and the pleasures we ought to  abstain from. \"So,\" he went on, \"if a man will only have these two words  at heart, and heed them carefully by ruling and watching over himself,  he will for the most part fall into no sin, and his life will be  tranquil and serene.\" He meant the words [Greek: Anechou kai  apechou]--\"Bear and Forbear.\"          CLXXXIV    On all occasions these thoughts should be at hand:--         Lead me, O God, and Thou, O Destiny       Be what it may the goal appointed me,       Bravely I'll follow; nay, and if I would not,       I'd prove a coward, yet must follow still!    Again:         Who to Necessity doth bow aright,       Is learn'd in wisdom and the things of God.    Once more:--         Crito, if this be God's will, so let it be. As for me,       Anytus and Meletus can indeed put me to death, but injure me,       never!          CLXXXV    We shall then be like Socrates, when we can indite hymns of praise to  the Gods in prison.          CLXXXVI    It is hard to combine and unite these two qualities, the carefulness  of one who is affected by circumstances, and the intrepidity of one  who heeds them not. But it is not impossible: else were happiness also  impossible. We should act as "]]]
