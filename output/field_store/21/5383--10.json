Those  who had firmness enough to abstain from it took a larger quantity of wine.  We tried to eat sword-belts and cartouch-boxes. We succeeded in swallowing  some little morsels. Some eat linen. Others pieces of leather from the  hats, on which there was a little grease, or rather dirt. We were obliged  to give up these last means. A sailor attempted to eat excrements, but he  could not succeed.    The day was calm and fine: a ray of hope allayed our uneasiness for a  moment. We still expected to see the boats or some vessels; we addressed  our prayers to the Eternal, and placed our confidence in him. The half of  our men were very weak, and bore on all their features the stamp of  approaching dissolution. The evening passed over, and no assistance came.  The darkness of this third night increased our alarm; but the wind was  slight, and the sea less agitated. We took some moment's repose: a repose  which was still more terrible than our situation the preceding day; cruel  dreams added to the horrors of our situation. Tormented by hunger and  thirst, our plaintive cries sometimes awakened from his sleep, the wretch  who was reposing close to us. We were even now up to our knees in the  water, so that we could only repose standing, pressed against each other to  form a solid mass. The fourth morning's sun, after our departure, at length  rose on our disaster, and shewed us ten or twelve of our companions  extended lifeless on the rail. This sight affected us the more as it  announced to us that our bodies, deprived of existence, would soon be  stretched on the same place. We gave their bodies to the sea for a grave;  reserving only one, destined to feed those who, the day before, had clasped  his trembling hands, vowing him an eternal friendship. This day was fine;  our minds, longing for more agreeable sensations, were harmonized by the  soothing aspect of nature, and admitted a ray of hope. About four in the  afternoon a circumstance occurred which afforded us some consolation: a  shoal of flying fish passed under the raft, and as the extremities left an  infinite number of vacancies between the pieces which composed it, the fish  got entangled in great numbers. We threw ourselves upon them, and caught a  considerable quantity: we took near two hundred and put them in an empty  cask;[25] as we caught them we opened them to take out what is called the  milt. This food seemed delicious to us; but one man would have wanted a  thousand. Our first impulse was to address new thanksgivings to God for  this unexpected benefit.    An ounce of gunpowder had been found in the morning, and dried in the sun,  during the day, which was very fine; a steel, some gun-flints and tinder  were also found in the same parcel. After infinite trouble we succeeded in  setting fire to some pieces of dry linen. We made a large hole in one side  of an empty cask, and placed at the bottom of it several things which we  wetted, and on this kind of scaffolding we made our fire: we placed it on a  barrel that the seawater might not put out our fire. We dressed some fish,  which we devoured with extreme avidity; but our hunger was so great and our  portion of fish so small, that we added to it some human flesh, which  dressing rendered less disgusting; it was this which the officers touched,  for the first time. From this day we continued to use it; but we could not  dress it any more, as we were entirely deprived of the means; our barrel  catching fire we extinguished it without being able to save any thing  whereby to light it again next day. The powder and the tinder were entirely  consumed. This repast gave us all fresh strength to bear new fatigues. The  night was tolerable, and would have appeared happy had it not been  signalised by a new massacre.    Some Spaniards, Italians, and Negroes, who had remained neuter in the first  mutiny, and some of whom had even ranged themselves on our side,[26] formed  a plot to throw us all into the sea, hoping to execute their design by  falling on us by surprise. These wretches suffered themselves to be  persuaded by the negroes, who assured them that the coast was extremely  near, and promised, that when they were once on shore, they would enable  them to traverse Africa without danger. The desire of saving themselves, or  perhaps the wish to seize on the money and valuables, which had been put  into a bag, hung to the mast,[27] had inflamed the imagination of these  unfortunate wretches. We were obliged to take our arms again; but how were  we to discover the guilty? they were pointed out to us, by our sailors, who  remained faithful, and ranged themselves near us; one of them had refused  to engage in the plot. The first signal, for combat, was given by a  Spaniard, who, placing himself behind the mast, laid fast hold of it, made  the sign of the Cross with one hand, invoking the name of God, and held a  knife in the other: the sailors seized him, and threw him into the sea. The  servant of an officer of the troops on board was in the plot. He was an  Italian from the light artillery of the Ex-King of his country. When he  perceived that the plot was discovered, he armed himself with the last  boarding-axe that there was on the raft, wrapped himself in a piece of  drapery, which he wore folded over his breast, and, of his own accord,  threw himself into the sea. The mutineers rushed forward to avenge their  comrades, a terrible combat again ensued, and both sides fought with  desperate fury. Soon the fatal raft was covered with dead bodies, and  flowing with blood which, ought to have been shed in another cause, and by  other hands. In this tumult cries, with which we were familiar, were  renewed, and we heard the imprecations of the horrid rage which demanded  the head of Lieutenant Danglas! Our readers know that we could not satisfy  this mad rage, because the victim, demanded, had fled the dangers to which  we were exposed; but even if this officer had remained among us, we should  most certainly have defended his life at the expence of our own, as we did  that of Lieutenant Lozach. But it was not for him that we were reduced to  exert, against these madmen, all the courage we possessed.    We again replied to the cries of the assailants, that he whom they demanded  was not with us; but we had no more success in persuading them; nothing  could make them recollect themselves; we were obliged to continue to combat  them, and to oppose force to those over whom reason had lost all its  influence. In this confusion the unfortunate woman was, a second time,  thrown into the sea. We perceived it, and Mr. Coudin, assisted by some  workmen, took her up again, to prolong, for a few moments, her torments and  her existence.    In this horrible night, Lavillette gave further proofs of the rarest  intrepidity. It was to him, and to some of those who have escaped the  consequences of our misfortunes, that we are indebted for our safety. At  length, after unheard-of efforts, the mutineers were again repulsed, and  tranquillity restored. After we had escaped this new danger, we endeavoured  to take some moment's repose. The day at length rose on us for the fifth  time. We were now only thirty left; we had lost four or five of our  faithful sailors; those who survived were in the most deplorable state; the  sea-water had almost entirely excoriated our lower extremities; we were  covered with contusions or wounds, which, irritated by the salt-water,  made us utter every moment piercing cries; so that there were not above  twenty of us who were able to stand upright or walk. Almost our whole stock  was exhausted; we had no more wine than was sufficient for four days, and  we had not above a dozen fish left. In four days, said we, we shall be in  want of every thing, and death will be unavoidable. Thus arrived the  seventh day since we had been abandoned; we calculated that, in case the  boats had not stranded on the coast, they would want, at least, three or  four times twenty-four hours to reach St. Louis. Time was further required  to equip ships, and for these ships to find us; we resolved to hold out as  long as possible. In the course of the day, two soldiers slipped behind the  only barrel of wine we had left; they had bored a hole in it, and were  drinking by means of a reed; we had all sworn, that he who should employ  such means should be punished with death. This law was instantly put in  execution, and the two trespassers were thrown into the sea.[28]    This same day terminated the existence of a child, twelve years of age,  named Leon; he died away like a lamp which ceases to burn for want of  aliment. Every thing spoke in favor of this amiable young creature, who  merited a better fate. His angelic countenance, his melodious voice, the  interest inspired by his youth, which was increased by the courage he had  shown, and the services he had performed, for he had already made, in the  preceding year, a campaign in the East Indies, all this filled us with the  tenderest interest for this young victim, devoted to a death so dreadful  and premature. Our old soldiers, and our people in general, bestowed upon  him all the care which they thought calculated to prolong his existence. It  was in vain; his strength, at last, forsook him. Neither the wine, which we  gave him without regret, nor all the means which could be employed, could  rescue him from his sad fate; he expired in the arms of Mr. Coudin, who had  not ceased to shew him the kindest attention. As long as the strength of  this young marine had allowed him to move, he ran continually from one side  to the other, calling, with loud cries, for his unhappy mother, water, and  food. He walked, without discrimination, over the feet and legs of his  companions in misfortune, who, in their turn, uttered cries of anguish,  which were every moment repeated.

So I went alone.\"    \"Describe exactly what took place.\"    Margaret Halley stared reflectively at the blotting-pad for a moment,  and then described a typical seance at Kazmah's. In conclusion:    \"As I came away,\" she said, \"I bought a bottle of every kind of perfume  on sale, some of the incense, and also a box of sweetmeat; but they all  proved to be perfectly harmless. I analyzed them.\"    Kerry's eyes glistened with admiration.    \"We could do with you at the Yard, miss,\" he said. \"Excuse me for saying  so.\"    Margaret smiled rather wanly.    \"Now--this man Kazmah,\" resumed the Chief Inspector. \"Did you ever see  him again?\"    \"Never. I have been trying for months and months to find out who he is.\"    Kerry's face became very grim.    \"About ten trained men are trying to find that out at the present  moment!\" he rapped. \"Do you think he wore a make-up?\"    \"He may have done so,\" Margaret admitted. \"But his features were  obviously undisguised, and his eyes one would recognize anywhere. They  were larger than any human eyes I have ever seen.\"    \"He couldn't have been the Egyptian who looked after the shop, for  instance?\"    \"Impossible! He did not remotely resemble him. Besides, the man to whom  you refer remained outside to receive other visitors. Oh, that's out of  the question, Inspector.\"    \"The light was very dim?\"    \"Very dim indeed, and Kazmah never once raised his head. Indeed, except  for a dignified gesture of greeting and one of dismissal, he never  moved. His immobility was rather uncanny.\"    Kerry began to pace up and down the narrow room, and:    \"He bore no resemblance to the late Sir Lucien Pyne, for instance?\" he  rapped.    Margaret laughed outright and her laughter was so inoffensive and so  musical that the Chief Inspector laughed also.    \"That's more hopeless than ever!\" she said. \"Poor Sir Lucien had strong,  harsh features and rather small eyes. He wore a moustache, too. But Sir  Lucien, I feel sure, was one of Kazmah's clients.\"    \"Ah!\" said Kerry. \"And what leads you to suppose Miss Halley, that this  Kazmah dealt in drugs?\"    \"Well, you see, Rita Irvin was always going there to buy perfumes, and  she frequently sent her maid as well.\"    \"But\"--Kerry stared--\"you say that the perfume was harmless.\"    \"That which was sold to casual visitors was harmless, Inspector. But I  strongly suspect that regular clients were supplied with something quite  different. You see, I know no fewer than thirty unfortunate women in  the West End of London alone who are simply helpless slaves to  various drugs, and I think it more than a coincidence that upon their  dressing-tables I have almost invariably found one or more of Kazmah's  peculiar antique flasks.\"    Chief Inspector Kerry's jaw muscles protruded conspicuously.    \"You speak of patients?\" he asked.    Margaret nodded her head.    \"When a woman becomes addicted to the drug habit,\" she explained, \"she  sometimes shuns her regular medical adviser. I have many patients who  came to me originally simply because they dared not face their family  doctor. In fact, since I gave up Army work, my little practice has  threatened to develop into that of a drug-habit specialist.\"    \"Have you taxed any of these people with obtaining drugs from Kazmah?\"    \"Not directly. It would have been undiplomatic. But I have tried to  surprise them into telling me. Unfortunately, these poor people are as  cunning as any other kind of maniac, for, of course, it becomes a form  of mania. They recognize that confession might lead to a stoppage of  supplies--the eventuality they most dread.\"    \"Did you examine the contents of any of these flasks found on  dressing-tables?\"    \"I rarely had an opportunity; but when I did they proved to contain  perfume when they contained anything.\"    \"H'm,\" mused Kerry, and although in deference to Margaret, he had denied  himself chewing-gum, his jaws worked automatically. \"I gather that Mrs.  Monte Irvin had expressed a wish to see you last night?\"    \"Yes. Apparently she was threatened with a shortage of cocaine.\"    \"Cocaine was her drug?\"    \"One of them. She had tried them all, poor, silly girl! You must  understand that for a habitual drug-taker suddenly to be deprived of  drugs would lead to complete collapse, perhaps death. And during the  last few days I had noticed a peculiar nervous symptom in Rita Irvin  which had interested me. Finally, the day before yesterday, she  confessed that her usual source of supply had been closed to her. Her  words were very vague, but I gathered that some form of coercion was  being employed.\"    \"With what object?\"    \"I have no idea. But she used the words, 'They will drive me mad,' and  seemed to be in a dangerously nervous condition. She said that she was  going to make a final attempt to obtain a supply of the poison which had  become indispensable to her. 'I cannot do without it!' she said. 'But if  they refuse, will you give me some?'\"    \"What did you say?\"    \"I begged of her, as I had done on many previous occasions, to place  herself in my hands. But she evaded a direct answer, as is the way of  one addicted to this vice. 'If I cannot get some by tomorrow,' she said,  'I shall go mad, or dead. Can I rely on you?'\"    \"I told her that I would prescribe cocaine for her on the distinct  understanding that from the first dose she was to place herself under my  care for a cure.\"    \"She agreed?\"    \"She agreed. Yesterday afternoon, while I was away at an important case,  she came here. Poor Rita!\" Margaret's soft voice trembled. \"Look--she  left this note.\"    From a letter-rack she took a square sheet of paper and handed it to  the Chief Inspector. He bent his fierce eyes upon the writing--large,  irregular and shaky.    \"'Dear Margaret,'\" he read aloud. \"'Why aren't you at home? I am wild  with pain, and feel I am going mad. Come to me directly you return, and  bring enough to keep me alive. I--', Hullo! there's no finish!\"    He glanced up from the page. Margaret Halley's eyes were dim.    \"She despaired of my coming and went to Kazmah,\" she said. \"Can you  doubt that that was what she went for?\"    \"No!\" snapped Kerry savagely, \"I can't. But do you mean to tell me, Miss  Halley, that Mrs. Irvin couldn't get cocaine anywhere else? I know for  a fact that it's smuggled in regularly, and there's more than one  receiver.\"    Margaret looked at him strangely.    \"I know it, too, Inspector,\" she said quietly. \"Owing to the lack  of enterprise on the part of our British drug-houses, even reputable  chemists are sometimes dependent upon illicit stock from Japan and  America. But do you know that the price of these smuggled drugs has  latterly become so high as to be prohibitive in many cases?\"    \"I don't. What are you driving at, miss?\"    \"At this: Somebody had made a corner in contraband drugs. The most  wicked syndicate that ever was formed has got control of the lives of,  it may be, thousands of drug-slaves!\"    Kerry's teeth closed with a sharp snap.    \"At last,\" he said, \"I see where the smart from the Home office comes  in.\"    \"The Secretary of State has appointed a special independent commissioner  to inquire into this hellish traffic,\" replied Margaret quietly. \"I  am glad to say that I have helped in getting this done by the  representations which I have made to my uncle, Lord Wrexborough. But I  give you my word, Inspector Kerry, that I have withheld nothing from you  any more than from him.\"    \"Him!\" snapped Kerry, eyes fiercely ablaze.    \"From the Home Office representative--before whom I have already given  evidence.\"    Chief Inspector Kerry took up his hat, cane and overall from the chair  upon which he had placed them and, his face a savage red mask, bowed  with a fine courtesy. He burned to learn particulars; he disdained to  obtain them from a woman.    \"Good morning, Miss Halley,\" he said. \"I am greatly indebted to you.\"    He walked stiffly from the room and out of the flat without waiting for  a servant to open the door.          PART SECOND--MRS. SIN        CHAPTER XII. THE MAID OF THE MASQUE    The past life of Mrs. Monte Irvin, in which at this time three distinct  groups of investigators became interested--namely, those of Whitehall,  Scotland Yard, and Fleet Street--was of a character to have horrified  the prudish, but to have excited the compassion of the wise.    Daughter of a struggling suburban solicitor, Rita Esden, at the age of  seventeen, from a delicate and rather commonplace child began to develop  into a singularly pretty girl of an elusive and fascinating type of  beauty, almost ethereal in her dainty coloring, and possessed of large  and remarkably fine eyes, together with a wealth of copper-red hair, a  crown which seemed too heavy for her slender neck to support. Her father  viewed her increasing charms and ever-growing list of admirers with the  gloomy apprehension of a disappointed man who had come to look upon each  gift of the gods as a new sorrow cunningly disguised. Her mother, on the  contrary, fanned the girl's natural vanity and ambition with a success  which rarely attended the enterprises of this foolish old woman, and  Rita proving to be endowed with a moderately good voice, a stage career  was determined upon without reference to the contrary wishes of Mr.  Esden.    Following the usual brief \"training\" which is counted sufficient for an  aspirant to musical comedy honors, Rita, by the prefixing of two letters  to her name, set out to conquer the play-going world as Rita Dresden.    Two years of hard work and disappointment served to dispel the girl's  illusions. She learned to appreciate at its true value that masculine  admiration which, in an unusual degree, she had the power to  excite. Those of her admirers who were in a position to assist her  professionally were only prepared to use their influence upon terms  which she was unprepared to accept. Those"]]]
