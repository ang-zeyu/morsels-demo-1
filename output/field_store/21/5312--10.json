I saw nothing of the vintage, as  my visit was in the spring, but I tasted the product and found it good. The  Arab vine-owners sell the grapes to Jews, who extract the juice. Still  there is room for enterprise here, and it is regrettable that few seem to  think of Hebron when planning the regeneration of Judea. True, I should  regret the loss of primitiveness here, as I said at the outset, but when  the lives of men are concerned, esthetics must go to the wall. The Jewish  quarter was enlarged in 1875, but it is still inadequate. The Society  Lemaan Zion has done a little to introduce modern education, but neither  the Alliance nor the Anglo-Jewish Association has a school here. Lack of  means prevents the necessary efforts from being made. Most deplorable is  the fact connected with the hospital. In a beautiful sunlit road above the  mosque, amid olive groves, is the Jewish hospital, ready for use,  well-built, but though the very beds were there when T saw it, no patients  could be received, as there were no funds. The Jewish doctor was doing a  wonderful work. He had exiled himself from civilized life, as we Westerns  understand it; his children had no school to which to go; he felt himself  stagnating, without intellectual intercourse with his equals, yet active,  kindly, uncomplaining--one of those everyday martyrs whom one meets so  often among the Jews of Judea, men who day by day see their ambitions  vanishing under the weight of a crushing duty. It was sad to see how he  lingered over the farewell when I left him. I said that his house had  seemed an oasis in the desert to me, that I could never forget the time  spent with him. \"And what of me?\" he answered. \"Your visit has been an  oasis in the desert to me, but you go and the desert remains.\" Surely, the  saddest thing in life is this feeling that one's own uninteresting,  commonplace self should mean so much to others. I call it sad, because so  few of us realize what we may mean to others, being so absorbed in our  selfish thought of what others mean to us.    There are two industries in Hebron besides the vintage. It supplies most of  the skin-bottles used in Judea, and a good deal of glassware, including  lamps, is manufactured there. The Hebron tannery is a picturesque place,  but no Jews are employed in it. Each bottle is made from an entire  goat-skin, from which only the head and feet are removed. The lower  extremities are sewn up, and the neck is drawn together to form the neck of  the water bottle. Some trade is also done here in wool, which the Arabs  bring in and sell at the market held every Friday. In ancient times the  sheep used in the Temple sacrifices were obtained from Hebron. Besides the  tannery, the glass factories are worth a visit. The one which I saw was in  a cavern, lit only by the glow of the central furnace. Seated round the  hearth (I am following Gautier's faithful description of the scene) and  served by two or three boys, were about ten workmen, making many-colored  bracelets and glass rings, which varied in size from small finger rings to  circlets through which you could easily put your arm. The workmen are  provided with two metal rods and a pair of small tongs, and they ply these  primitive instruments with wonderful dexterity. They work very hard, at  least fifteen hours a day, for five days a week.    This is one of the curiosities of the East. Either the men there are  loafers, or they work with extraordinary vigor. There is nothing between  doing too much and doing nothing. The same thing strikes one at Jaffa. The  porters who carry your baggage from the landing stage to the steamer do  more work than three English dock laborers. They carry terrific weights.  When a family moves, a porter carries all the furniture on his back. Yet  side by side with these overworked men, Jaffa is crowded with idlers, who  do absolutely nothing. Such are the contrasts of the surprising Orient.    Many of the beads and rosaries taken to Europe by pious pilgrims are made  in Hebron, just as the mother of pearl relics come chiefly from Bethlehem,  where are made also the tobacco-jars of Dead Sea stone. Hebron does a fair  trade with the Bedouins, but on the whole it is quite unprogressive. At  first sight this may seem rather an unpleasant fact for lovers of peace.  Hebron has for many centuries been absolutely free from the ravages of war,  yet it stagnates. Peace is clearly not enough for progress. As the  Rabbinical phrase well puts it, \"Peace is the vessel which holds all other  good\"--without peace this other good is spilt, but peace is after all the  containing vessel, not the content of happiness.    I have left out, in the preceding narrative, the visit paid to the Haram  erected over the Cave of Machpelah. The mosque is an imposing structure,  and rises above the houses on the hill to the left as you enter from  Jerusalem. The walls of the enclosure and of the mosque are from time to  time whitewashed, so that the general appearance is somewhat dazzling. It  has already been mentioned that certain repairs were effected in 1894-5.  The work was done by the lads of the Technical School in Jerusalem; they  made an iron gate for Joseph's tomb,--the Moslems believe that Joseph is  buried in Hebron,--and they made one gate for Abraham's tomb, one gate and  three window gratings for Isaac's tomb, and one gate and two window  gratings for Rebekah's tomb. This iron work, it is satisfactory to  remember, was rendered possible by the splendid machinery sent out to the  school from London by the Anglo-Jewish Association. The ordinary Jewish  visitor is not allowed to enter the enclosure at all. I was stopped at the  steps, where the custodian audaciously demanded a tip for not letting me  in. The tombs within are not the real tombs of the Patriarchs; they are  merely late erections over the spots where the Patriarchs lie buried.    No one has ever doubted that Machpelah is actually at this site, but the  building is, of course, not Patriarchal in age. The enclosure is as old as  the Wailing Wall at Jerusalem. It belongs to the age of Herod; we see the  same cyclopean stones, with the same surface draftings as at Jerusalem. Why  Herod built this edifice seems clear. Hebron was the centre of Idumean  influence, and Herod was an Idumean. He had a family interest in the place,  and hence sought to beautify it. No Jew or Christian can enter the  enclosure except by special irade; even Sir Moses Montefiore was refused  the privilege. Rather, one should say, the Moslem authorities wished to let  Sir Moses in, but they were prevented by the mob from carrying out their  amiable intentions. The late English King Edward VII and the present King  George V were privileged to enter the structure. Mr. Elkan Adler got in at  the time when the _Alliance_ workmen were repairing the gates, but there is  nothing to see of any interest. No one within historical times has  penetrated below the mosque, to the cavern itself. We still do not know  whether it is called Machpelah because the Cave is double vertically or  double horizontally.    The outside is much more interesting than the inside. Half way up the steps  leading into the mosque, there is a small hole or window at which many Jews  pray, and into which, it is said, all sorts of things, including letters to  the Patriarchs, are thrown, especially by women. In the Middle Ages, they  spread at this hole a tender calf, some venison pasties, and some red  pottage, every day, in honor of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the food was  eaten by the poor. It is commonly reported, though I failed to obtain any  local confirmation of the assertion, that the Jews still write their names  and their requests on strips of paper and thrust them into this hole. The  Moslems let down a lamp through the hole, and also cast money into it,  which is afterwards picked up by little boys as it is required for the  purposes of the mosque and for repairing the numerous tombs of prophets and  saints with which Hebron abounds. If you were to believe the local  traditions, no corpses were left for other cemeteries. The truth is that  much obscurity exists as to the identity even of modern tombs, for Hebron  preserves its old custom, and none of the Jewish tombs to this day bear  epitaphs. What a mass of posthumous hypocrisy would the world be spared if  the Hebron custom were prevalent everywhere! But it is obvious that the  method lends itself to inventiveness, and as the tombs are unnamed, local  guides tell you anything they choose about them, and you do not believe  them even when they are speaking the truth.    There is only one other fact to tell about the Cave. The Moslems have a  curious dread of Isaac and Rebekah, they regard the other Patriarchs as  kindly disposed, but Isaac is irritable, and Rebekah malicious. It is told  of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, he who \"feared neither man nor devil,\" that when  he was let down into the Cave by a rope, he surprised Rebekah in the act of  combing her hair. She resented the intrusion, and gave him so severe a box  on the ears that he fell down in a fit, and could be rescued alive only  with much difficulty. It is with equal difficulty that one can depart, with  any reverence left, from the mass of legend and childishness with which one  is crushed in such places. One escapes with the thought of the real  Abraham, his glorious service to humanity, his lifelong devotion to the  making of souls, to the spread of the knowledge of God. One recalls the  Abraham who, in the Jewish tradition, is the type of unselfishness, of  watchfulness on behalf of his descendants, the marks of whose genuine  relationship to the Patriarch are a generous eye and a humble spirit. As  one turns from Hebron, full of such happy memories, one forms the resolve  not to rely solely on an appeal to the Patriarch's merits, but to strive to  do something oneself for the Jewish cause,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],[0,"Introductory American History (#12)"],[1,"favored by the emperors, but before the fourth century    closed the old religion was forbidden. In later days worshipers of the    Roman gods were mostly country people, called in Latin _pagani_, and    therefore their religion was called \"paganism.\"    HOW THE CHURCH WAS RULED. One of the reasons why the Christians had    been successful in their struggle with the Roman emperors was that they    were united under wise and brave leaders. The Christians in each large    city were ruled by a bishop, and the bishops of several cities were    directed by an archbishop. In the western part of the empire the bishop    of Rome, who was called the pope, was honored as the chief of the    bishops and archbishops, and the successor of the Apostle Peter. In the    eastern part the archbishops or patriarchs of Constantinople and    Alexandria and Jerusalem honored the pope, but claimed to be equal in    authority with him.      There were also two kinds of clergy, parish priests and monks. The    priests were pastors of ordinary parishes, but the monks lived in groups    in buildings called monasteries. Sometimes their purpose was to dwell    far from the bustle and wrongs of ordinary life and give themselves to    prayer and fasting; sometimes they acted as a brotherhood of teachers in    barbarous communities, teaching the people better methods of farming,    and carrying the arts of civilized life beyond the borders of    the empire.

CHAPTER X      EMIGRANTS A THOUSAND YEARS AGO    THE MIDDLE AGES. It was more than a thousand years from the time of    Constantine to the time of Columbus. This period is called \"Mediaeval,\"    or the \"Middle Ages.\" During these long centuries the ancient civilized    world of the Roman Empire was much changed. The Roman or Greek cities on    the southern shores of the Mediterranean were captured by Arabs or    Moors. The Moors conquered the larger part of Spain. The eastern lands    of Palestine and Asia Minor fell into the hands of the Turks. The Turks,    the Moors, and the Arabs were followers of the \"prophet\" Mohammed, who    died in the year 632. The Mohammedans were enemies of the Christians.    WESTERN EUROPE. The other part of the European world was also    changed. The countries on the shores of the Atlantic were now more    important than those on the shores of the Mediterranean. The names of    the different countries were changed. Instead of Gallia or Gaul, there    was France; instead of Britannia, England; for Hispania, Spain; for    Germania, Deutschland or Germany. Italy, the center of the old empire,    was finally divided into several states--city republics like Genoa and    Venice, provinces ruled by the pope, and other territories ruled by    dukes, princes, or kings.    FATE OF CIVILIZATION. The most important question to ask is, How    much of the manner of living or civilization of the Greeks and the    Romans did the later Europeans still retain? The answer is found in the    history of the Middle Ages. In this history is also found what men added    to that which they had learned from the Greeks and the Romans. The    emigrants to America were to carry with them knowledge which not even    the wisest men of the ancient world had possessed.      [Illustration: WALL OF AURELIAN This wall enclosed the ancient    city of Rome. It was about thirteen miles in circumference, fifty-five    feet high, and had three hundred towers]    MEDIAEVAL GERMAN EMIGRANTS. The first part of the history of the    Middle Ages explains how the German peoples from whom most of our    forefathers were descended began to move from the northern forests    towards the borders of the Roman Empire. Many thousand men had already    crossed the Rhine and the Danube to serve in the Roman armies. Sometimes    an unusually strong and skilful warrior would be made a general. Germans    had also crossed the Rhine to work as farmers on the estates of the rich    Gallic nobles. Other Germans, called Goths, worked in Constantinople and    the cities of the East as masons, porters, and water-carriers. The    Romans had owned so many slaves that they had lost the habit of work and    were glad to hire these foreigners.    STORY OF ULFILAS. Many of the Goths who lived north of the Danube    had forsaken their old gods and become Christians. They were taught by    Bishop Ulfilas, once a captive among them, afterward a missionary. He    translated the Bible into the Gothic language, and this translation is    the most ancient specimen of German that we possess. Many of the other    German tribes learned about Christianity from the Goths, and although    they might be enemies of the Roman government, they were not enemies of    the Church.    THE GOTHS INVADE THE ROMAN EMPIRE. The Roman emperors tried to    prevent the northern tribes from crossing the frontier in great numbers,    because, once across, if they did not find work and food, they became    plunderers. Not many years after Constantine's death, a million Goths    had passed the Danube and had plundered the country almost to the walls    of Constantinople. This was not like the invasion of a regular army,    which comes to fight battles and to arrange terms of peace.      The Goths, and the Germans who soon followed their example, moved as a    whole people, with their wives and children, their cattle, and the few    household goods they owned. Wherever they wished to settle they demanded    of the Romans one third, sometimes two thirds, of the land. They soon    learned to be good neighbors of the older inhabitants, although at first    they were little better than robbers. Alaric, one of the leaders of the    Goths, led them into Italy and in the year 410 captured Rome. Alaric did    not injure the buildings much, and he kept his men from robbing the    churches. Some of the other barbarous tribes who roamed about plundering    villages and attacking cities did far greater damage. The Roman    government grew weaker and weaker, until one by one the provinces fell    into the hands of German kings.    BEGINNINGS OF ENGLAND, FRANCE, AND GERMANY. Britain was attacked by    the Angles and Saxons from the shores of Germany across the North Sea.    They drove away the inhabitants or made slaves of    them and settled upon the lands they had seized. The country was then    called Angle-land or England, and the people Anglo-Saxons or Englishmen.      The Roman provinces in Gaul were gradually conquered by the Franks from    the borders of the Rhine, and they gave the name France to the land.      At about the same time the other German tribes that had remained in    Germany united under one king.    THE RESULT OF BARBARIAN ATTACKS. The part of the ancient world    which lay about Constantinople was less changed than the rest during the    Middle Ages. The walls of Constantinople were high and thick, and they    withstood attack after attack until 1453. Within their shelter men    continued to live much as they had lived in Ancient Times. A few    delighted to study the writings of the ancient Greeks. In Italy and the    other countries of western Europe most of the cities were in ruins. The    ancient baths, amphitheaters, aqueducts, and palaces of Rome crumbled    and fell. The mediaeval Romans also used huge buildings like the    Colosseum as quarries of cut stone and burned the marble for lime. This    was done in every country where Roman buildings existed.      [Illustration: THE AMPHITHEATER AT ARLES]      The amphitheater at Arles in southern France had a still stranger    fortune. It was used at one time as a citadel, at another as a prison    and gradually became the home of hundreds of the criminals and the poor    of the city. \"Every archway held its nest of human outcasts. From stone    to stone they cast their rotting beams and plaster and burrowed into the    very entrails of the enormous building to seek a secure retreat from the    pursuit of the officers of the law.\"      Few persons traveled from Constantinople to Italy or France, and few    from western Europe visited Constantinople. The men of Italy and France    and England did not know how to read Greek. Many of them also ceased to    read the writings of the ancient Romans.      [Illustration: ST. MARTIN'S CHURCH, CANTERBURY, ENGLAND This    church is on the site of a chapel built in the sixth century.

Christianity had spread    throughout the Roman Empire, and it became the religion of all the    tribes who founded kingdoms of their own upon the ruins of the Empire.    The Angles and Saxons, when they invaded Britain, were still worshipers    of the gods Wodan and Thor. They had never learned from the Goths of    Ulfilas anything about Christianity.      One day in the slave market at Rome three fair-haired boys were offered    for sale. Gregory, a noble Roman, who had become a monk and was the    "]]]
