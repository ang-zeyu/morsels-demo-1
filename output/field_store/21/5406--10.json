I say he must be stopped,      This Mosby--caged, and hair close cropped.\"    \"Of course; but what's that dangling there\"    \"Where?\" \"From the tree--that gallows-bough;   A bit of frayed bark, is it not\"  \"Ay--or a rope; did _we_ hang last?--    Don't like my neckerchief any how\"      He loosened it: \"O ay, we'll stop      This Mosby--but that vile jerk and drop!\"[23]    By peep of light they feed and ride,    Gaining a grove's green edge at morn,  And mark the Aldie hills upread  And five gigantic horsemen carved    Clear-cut against the sky withdrawn;      Are more behind? an open snare?      Or Mosby's men but watchmen there?    The ravaged land was miles behind,    And Loudon spread her landscape rare;  Orchards in pleasant lowlands stood,  Cows were feeding, a cock loud crew,    But not a friend at need was there;      The valley-folk were only good      To Mosby and his wandering brood.    What best to do? what mean yon men?    Colonel and Guide their minds compare;  Be sure some looked their Leader through;  Dismsounted, on his sword he leaned    As one who feigns an easy air;      And yet perplexed he was they knew--      Perplexed by Mosby's mountain-crew.    The Major hemmed as he would speak,    But checked himself, and left the ring  Of cavalrymen about their Chief--  Young courtiers mute who paid their court    By looking with confidence on their king;      They knew him brave, foresaw no grief--      But Mosby--the time to think is brief.    The Surgeon (sashed in sacred green)    Was glad 'twas not for _him_ to say  What next should be; if a trooper bleeds,  Why he will do his best, as wont,    And his partner in black will aid and pray;      But judgment bides with him who leads,      And Mosby many a problem breeds.    The Surgeon was the kindliest man    That ever a callous trace professed;  He felt for him, that Leader young,  And offered medicine from his flask:    The Colonel took it with marvelous zest.      For such fine medicine good and strong,      Oft Mosby and his foresters long.    A charm of proof. \"Ho, Major, come--    Pounce on yon men! Take half your troop,  Through the thickets wind--pray speedy be--  And gain their read. And, Captain Morn,    Picket these roads--all travelers stop;      The rest to the edge of this crest with me,      That Mosby and his scouts may see.\"    Commanded and done. Ere the sun stood steep,    Back came the Blues, with a troop of Grays,  Ten riding double--luckless ten!--  Five horses gone, and looped hats lost,    And love-locks dancing in a maze--      Certes, but sophomores from the glen      Of Mosby--not his veteran men.    \"Colonel,\" said the Major, touching his cap,    \"We've had our ride, and here they are\"  \"Well done! how many found you there\"  \"As many as I bring you here\"    \"And no one hurt?\" \"There'll be no scar--      One fool was battered.\" \"Find their lair\"      \"Why, Mosby's brood camp every where.\"    He sighed, and slid down from his horse,    And limping went to a spring-head nigh.  \"Why, bless me, Major, not hurt, I hope\"  \"Battered my knee against a bar    When the rush was made; all right by-and-by.--      Halloa! they gave you too much rope--      Go back to Mosby, eh? elope?\"    Just by the low-hanging skirt of wood    The guard, remiss, had given a chance  For a sudden sally into the cover--  But foiled the intent, nor fired a shot,    Though the issue was a deadly trance;      For, hurled 'gainst an oak that humped low over,      Mosby's man fell, pale as a lover.    They pulled some grass his head to ease    (Lined with blue shreds a ground-nest stirred).  The Surgeon came--\"Here's a to-do\"  \"Ah!\" cried the Major, darting a glance,    \"This fellow's the one that fired and spurred      Down hill, but met reserves below--      My boys, not Mosby's--so we go!\"    The Surgeon--bluff, red, goodly man--    Kneeled by the hurt one; like a bee  He toiled. The pale young Chaplain too--  (Who went to the wars for cure of souls,    And his own student-ailments)--he      Bent over likewise; spite the two,      Mosby's poor man more pallid grew.    Meanwhile the mounted captives near    Jested; and yet they anxious showed;  Virginians; some of family-pride,  And young, and full of fire, and fine    In open feature and cheek that glowed;      And here thralled vagabonds now they ride--      But list! one speaks for Mosby's side.    \"Why, three to one--your horses strong--    Revolvers, rifles, and a surprise--  Surrender we account no shame!  We live, are gay, and life is hope;    We'll fight again when fight is wise.      There are plenty more from where we came;      But go find Mosby--start the game!\"    Yet one there was who looked but glum;    In middle-age, a father he,  And this his first experience too:  \"They shot at my heart when my hands were up--    This fighting's crazy work, I see\"      But noon is high; what next do?      The woods are mute, and Mosby is the foe.    \"Save what we've got,\" the Major said;    \"Bad plan to make a scout too long;  The tide may turn, and drag them back,  And more beside. These rides I've been,    And every time a mine was sprung.      To rescue, mind, they won't be slack--      Look out for Mosby's rifle-crack.\"    \"We'll welcome it! give crack for crack!    Peril, old lad, is what I seek\"  \"O then, there's plenty to be had--  By all means on, and have our fill\"    With that, grotesque, he writhed his neck,      Showing a scar by buck-shot made--      Kind Mosby's Christmas gift, he said.    \"But, Colonel, my prisoners--let a guard    Make sure of them, and lead to camp.  That done, we're free for a dark-room fight  If so you say.\" The other laughed;    \"Trust me, Major, nor throw a damp.      But first to try a little sleight--      Sure news of Mosby would suit me quite.\"    Herewith he turned--\"Reb, have a dram\"    Holding the Surgeon's flask with a smile  To a young scapegrace from the glen.  \"O yes!\" he eagerly replied,    \"And thank you, Colonel, but--any guile?      For if you think we'll blab--why, then      You don't know Mosby or his men.\"    The Leader's genial air relaxed.    \"Best give it up,\" a whisperer said.  \"By heaven, I'll range their rebel den\"  \"They'll treat you well,\" the captive cried;    \"They're all like us--handsome--well bred:      In wood or town, with sword or pen,      Polite is Mosby, bland his men.\"    \"Where were you, lads, last night?--come, tell\"    \"We?--at a wedding in the Vale--  The bridegroom our comrade; by his side  Belisent, my cousin--O, so proud    Of her young love with old wounds pale--      A Virginian girl! God bless her pride--      Of a crippled Mosby-man the bride!\"    \"Four wall shall mend that saucy mood,    And moping prisons tame him down\"  Said Captain Cloud. \"God help that day\"  Cried Captain Morn, \"and he so young.    But hark, he sings--a madcap one\"      \"_O we multiply merrily in the May,      The birds and Mosby's men, they say!_\"    While echoes ran, a wagon old,    Under stout guard of Corporal Chew  Came up; a lame horse, dingy white,  With clouted harness; ropes in hand,    Cringed the humped driver, black in hue;      By him (for Mosby's band a sight)      A sister-rebel sat, her veil held tight.    \"I picked them up,\" the Corporal said,    \"Crunching their way over stick and root,  Through yonder wood. The man here--Cuff--  Says they are going to Leesburg town\"    The Colonel's eye took in the group;      The veiled one's hand he spied--enough!      Not Mosby's. Spite the gown's poor stuff,    Off went his hat: \"Lady, fear not;    We soldiers do what we deplore--  I must detain you till we march\"  The stranger nodded. Nettled now,    He grew politer than before:--      \"'Tis Mosby's fault, this halt and search\"      The lady stiffened in her starch.    \"My duty, madam, bids me now    Ask what may seem a little rude.  Pardon--that veil--withdraw it, please  (Corporal! make every man fall back);    Pray, now I do but what I should;      Bethink you, 'tis in masks like these      That Mosby haunts the villages.\"    Slowly the stranger drew her veil,    And looked the Soldier in the eye--  A glance of mingled foul and fair;  Sad patience in a proud disdain,    And more than quietude. A sigh      She heaved, and if all unaware,      And far seemed Mosby from her care.    She came from Yewton Place, her home,    So ravaged by the war's wild play--  Campings, and foragings, and fires--  That now she sought an aunt's abode.    Her Kinsmen? In Lee's army, they.      The black? A servant, late her sire's.      And Mosby? Vainly he inquires.    He gazed, and sad she met his eye;    \"In the wood yonder were you lost\"  No; at the forks they left the road  Because of hoof-prints (thick they were--    Thick as the words in notes thrice crossed),      And fearful, made that episode.      In fear of Mosby? None she showed.    Her poor attire again he scanned:    \"Lady, once more; I grieve to jar  On all sweet usage, but must plead  To have what peeps there from your dress;    That letter--'tis justly prize of war\"      She started--gave it--she must need.      \"'Tis not from Mosby? May I read?\"    And straight such matter he perused    That with the Guide he went apart.  The Hospital Steward's turn began:  \"Must squeeze this darkey; every tap    Of knowledge we are bound to start\"      \"Garry,\" she said, \"tell all you can      Of Colonel Mosby--that brave man.\"    \"Dun know much, sare; and missis here    Know less dan me. But dis I know--\"  \"Well, what?\" \"I dun know what I know\"  \"A knowing answer!\" The hump-back coughed,    Rubbing his yellowish wool like tow.      \"Come--Mosby--tell!\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],[0,"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#13)"],[1,"s.    \"Have you trifled with her, as you have with so many others? Tell  me. I know you don't lie.\"    \"No.\"    \"Then what do you mean?\"    \"Nothing much, Jim, except I'm really not worthy of her. I'm no  good, you know, and she ought to get a fellow like--like you.\"    \"Absurd! You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\"    \"Never mind me. See here; don't you admire her?\"    \"Why--why, yes,\" stammered Jim, flushing a dark, guilty red at the  direct question. \"Who could help admiring her?\"    \"That's what I thought. And I know she admires you for qualities  which I lack. Nell's like a tender vine just beginning to creep  around and cling to something strong. She cares for me; but her love  is like the vine. It may hurt her a little to tear that love away,  but it won't kill her; and in the end it will be best for her. You  need a good wife. What could I do with a woman? Go in and win her,  Jim.\"    \"Joe, you're sacrificing yourself again for me,\" cried Jim, white to  the lips. \"It's wrong to yourself and wrong to her. I tell you---\"    \"Enough!\" Joe's voice cut in cold and sharp. \"Usually you influence  me; but sometimes you can't; I say this: Nell will drift into your  arms as surely as the leaf falls. It will not hurt her--will be best  for her. Remember, she is yours for the winning.\"    \"You do not say whether that will hurt you,\" whispered Jim.    \"Come--we'll find Colonel Zane,\" said Joe, opening the door.    They went out in the hallway which opened into the yard as well as  the larger room through which the colonel had first conducted them.  As Jim, who was in advance, passed into this apartment a trim figure  entered from the yard. It was Nell, and she ran directly against  him. Her face was flushed, her eyes were beaming with gladness, and  she seemed the incarnation of girlish joy.    \"Oh, Joe,\" was all she whispered. But the happiness and welcome in  that whisper could never have been better expressed in longer  speech. Then slightly, ever so slightly, she tilted her sweet face  up to his.    It all happened with the quickness of thought. In a single instant  Jim saw the radiant face, the outstretched hands, and heard the glad  whisper. He knew that she had a again mistaken him for Joe; but for  his life he could not draw back his head. He had kissed her, and  even as his lips thrilled with her tremulous caress he flushed with  the shame of his deceit.    \"You're mistaken again--I'm Jim,\" he whispered.    For a moment they stood staring into each other's eyes, slowly  awakening to what had really happened, slowly conscious of a sweet,  alluring power. Then Colonel Zane's cheery voice rang in their ears.    \"Ah, here's Nellie and your brother! Now, lads, tell me which is  which?'    \"That's Jim, and I'm Joe,\" answered the latter. He appeared not to  notice his brother, and his greeting to Nell was natural and hearty.  For the moment she drew the attention of the others from them.    Joe found himself listening to the congratulations of a number of  people. Among the many names he remembered were those of Mrs. Zane,  Silas Zane, and Major McColloch. Then he found himself gazing at the  most beautiful girl he had ever seen in his life.    \"My only sister, Mrs. Alfred Clarke--once Betty Zane, and the  heroine of Fort Henry,\" said Colonel Zane proudly, with his arm  around the slender, dark-eyed girl.    \"I would brave the Indians and the wilderness again for this  pleasure,\" replied Joe gallantly, as he bowed low over the little  hand she cordially extended.    \"Bess, is dinner ready?\" inquired Colonel Zane of his comely wife.  She nodded her head, and the colonel led the way into the adjoining  room. \"I know you boys must be hungry as bears.\"    During the meal Colonel Zane questioned his guests about their  journey, and as to the treatment they had received at the hands of  the Indians. He smiled at the young minister's earnestness in regard  to the conversion of the redmen, and he laughed outright when Joe  said \"he guessed he came to the frontier because it was too slow at  home.\"    \"I am sure your desire for excitement will soon be satisfied, if  indeed it be not so already,\" remarked the colonel. \"But as to the  realization of your brother's hopes I am not so sanguine.  Undoubtedly the Moravian missionaries have accomplished wonders with  the Indians. Not long ago I visited the Village of Peace--the Indian  name for the mission--and was struck by the friendliness and  industry which prevailed there. Truly it was a village of peace. Yet  it is almost to early to be certain of permanent success of this  work. The Indian's nature is one hard to understand. He is naturally  roving and restless, which, however, may be owing to his habit of  moving from place to place in search of good hunting grounds. I  believe--though I must confess I haven't seen any pioneers who share  my belief--that the savage has a beautiful side to his character. I  know of many noble deeds done by them, and I believe, if they are  honestly dealt with, they will return good for good. There are bad  ones, of course; but the French traders, and men like the Girtys,  have caused most of this long war. Jonathan and Wetzel tell me the  Shawnees and Chippewas have taken the warpath again. Then the fact  that the Girtys are with the Delawares is reason for alarm. We have  been comparatively quiet here of late. Did you boys learn to what  tribe your captors belong? Did Wetzel say?\"    \"He did not; he spoke little, but I will say he was exceedingly  active,\" answered Joe, with a smile.    \"To have seen Wetzel fight Indians is something you are not likely  to forget,\" said Colonel Zane grimly. \"Now, tell me, how did those  Indians wear their scalp-lock?\"    \"Their heads were shaved closely, with the exception of a little  place on top. The remaining hair was twisted into a tuft, tied  tightly, and into this had been thrust a couple of painted pins.  When Wetzel scalped the Indians the pins fell out. I picked one up,  and found it to be bone.\"    \"You will make a woodsman, that's certain,\" replied Colonel Zane.  \"The Indians were Shawnee on the warpath. Well, we will not borrow  trouble, for when it comes in the shape of redskins it usually comes  quickly. Mr. Wells seemed anxious to resume the journey down the  river; but I shall try to persuade him to remain with us awhile.  Indeed, I am sorry I cannot keep you all here at Fort Henry, and  more especially the girls. On the border we need young people, and,  while I do not want to frighten the women, I fear there will be more  than Indians fighting for them.\"    \"I hope not; but we have come prepared for anything,\" said Kate,  with a quiet smile. \"Our home was with uncle, and when he announced  his intention of going west we decided our duty was to go with him.\"    \"You were right, and I hope you will find a happy home,\" rejoined  Colonel Zane. \"If life among the Indians, proves to be too hard, we  shall welcome you here. Betty, show the girls your pets and Indian  trinkets. I am going to take the boys to Silas' cabin to see Mr.  Wells, and then show them over the fort.\"    As they went out Joe saw the Indian guide standing in exactly the  same position as when they entered the building.    \"Can't that Indian move?\" he asked curiously.    \"He can cover one hundred miles in a day, when he wants to,\" replied  Colonel Zane. \"He is resting now. An Indian will often stand or sit  in one position for many hours.\"    \"He's a fine-looking chap,\" remarked Joe, and then to himself: \"but  I don't like him. I guess I'm prejudiced.\"    \"You'll learn to like Tome, as we call him.\"    \"Colonel Zane, I want a light for my pipe. I haven't had a smoke  since the day we were captured. That blamed redskin took my tobacco.  It's lucky I had some in my other pack. I'd like to meet him again;  also Silvertip and that brute Girty.\"    \"My lad, don't make such wishes,\" said Colonel Zane, earnestly. \"You  were indeed fortunate to escape, and I can well understand your  feelings. There is nothing I should like better than to see Girty  over the sights of my rifle; but I never hunt after danger, and to  look for Girty is to court death.\"    \"But Wetzel---\"    \"Ah, my lad, I know Wetzel goes alone in the woods; but then, he is  different from other men. Before you leave I will tell you all about  him.\"    Colonel Zane went around the corner of the cabin and returned with a  live coal on a chip of wood, which Joe placed in the bowl of his  pipe, and because of the strong breeze stepped close to the cabin  wall. Being a keen observer, he noticed many small, round holes in  the logs. They were so near together that the timbers had an odd,  speckled appearance, and there was hardly a place where he could  have put his thumb without covering a hole. At first he thought they  were made by a worm or bird peculiar to that region; but finally lie  concluded that they were bullet-holes. He thrust his knife blade  into one, and out rolled a leaden ball.    \"I'd like to have been here when these were made,\" he said.    \"Well, at the time I wished I was back on the Potomac,\" replied  Colonel Zane.    They found the old missionary on the doorstep of the adjacent cabin.  He appeared discouraged when Colonel Zane interrogated him, and said  that he was impatient because of the delay.    \"Mr. Wells, is it not possible that you underrate the danger of your  enterprise?\"    \"I fear naught but the Lord,\" answered the old man.    \"Do you not fear for those with you?\" went on the colonel earnestly.  \"I am heart and soul with you in your work, but want to impress upon  you that the time is not propitious. It is a long journey to the  village, and the way is beset with dangers of which you have no  idea. Will you not remain here with me for a few weeks, or, at  least, until my scouts report?\"    \"I thank you; but go I will.\"    \"Then let me entreat you to remain here a few days, so that I may  send my brother Jonathan and Wetzel with you.
