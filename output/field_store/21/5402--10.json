Mostly, though, I was sold when I cut  up\".    \"I was a young man\", he continues, \"and didn't see why I should be  anybody's slave. I'd run away every chance I got. Sometimes they near  killed me, but mostly they just sold me. I guess I was pretty husky, at  that.\"    \"They never did get their money's worth out of me, though. I worked as  long as they stood over me, then I ran around with the gals or sneaked  off to the woods. Sometimes they used to put dogs on me to get me back.    \"When they finally sold me to a man up in Suwannee County--his name was  Harris--I thought it would be the end of the world. We had heard about  him all the way up in Virginia. They said he beat you, starved you and  tied you up when you didn't work, and killed you if you ran away.    \"But I never had a better master. He never beat me, and always fed all  of us. 'Course, we didn't get too much to eat; corn meal, a little piece  of fat meat now and then, cabbages, greens, potatoes, and plenty of  molasses. When I worked up at 'the house' I et just what the master et;  sometimes he would give it to me his-self. When he didn't, I et it  anyway.    \"He was so good, and I was so scared of him, till I didn't ever run away  from his place\", Ambrose reminisces; \"I had somebody there that I liked,  anyway. When he finally went to the war, he sold me back to a man in  North Carolina, in Hornett County. But the war was near over then; I  soon was as free as I am now.    \"I guess we musta celebrated 'Mancipation about twelve times in Hornett  County. Every time a bunch of No'thern sojers would come through they  would tell us we was free and we'd begin celebratin'. Before we would  get through somebody else would tell us to go back to work, and we would  go. Some of us wanted to jine up with the army, but didn't know who was  goin' to win and didn't take no chances.    \"I was 21 when freedom finally came, and that time I didn't take no  chances on 'em taking it back again. I lit out for Florida and wound up  in Madison County. I had a nice time there; I got married, got a plenty  of work, and made me a little money. I fixed houses, built 'em, worked  around the yards, and did everything. My first child was already born; I  didn't know there was goin' to be 37 more, though. I guess I would have  stopped right there....    \"I stayed in Madison County until they started to working concrete rock  down here. I heard about it and thought that would be a good way for me  to feed all them two dozen children I had. So I came down this side.  That was about 20 years ago.    \"I got married again after I got here; right soon after. My wife now is  30 years old; we already had 13 children together. (His wife is a  slight, girlish-looking woman; she says she was 13 when she married  Douglass, had her first child that year. Eleven of her thirteen are  still living.)    \"Yossuh, I ain't long stopped work. I worked here in the phosphate mine  until last year, when they started to paying pensions. I thought I  would get one, but all I got was some PWA work, and this year they told  me I was too old for that. I told 'em I wasn't but 91, but they didn't  give nothin' else. I guess I'll get my pension soon, though. My oldest  boy ought to get it, too; he's sixty-five.\"          FOLK STUFF, FLORIDA    Jules A.

This may be briefly summed up in the general  statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings  of growth, the heavier, harder, stronger, and stiffer the wood.  This, it must be remembered, applies only to ring-porous woods  such as oak, ash, hickory, and others of the same group, and is,  of course, subject to some exceptions and limitations.    In ring-porous woods of good growth it is usually the middle  portion of the ring in which the thick-walled, strength-giving  fibres are most abundant. As the breadth of ring diminishes,  this middle portion is reduced so that very slow growth produces  comparatively light, porous wood composed of thin-walled vessels  and wood parenchyma. In good oak these large vessels of the  early wood occupy from 6 to 10 per cent of the volume of the  log, while in inferior material they may make up 25 per cent or  more. The late wood of good oak, except for radial grayish  patches of small pores, is dark colored and firm, and consists  of thick-walled fibres which form one-half or more of the wood.  In inferior oak, such fibre areas are much reduced both in  quantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result  of rate of growth.    Wide-ringed wood is often called \"second-growth,\" because the  growth of the young timber in open stands after the old trees  have been removed is more rapid than in trees in the forest, and  in the manufacture of articles where strength is an important  consideration such \"second-growth\" hardwood material is  preferred. This is particularly the case in the choice of  hickory for handles and spokes. Here not only strength, but  toughness and resilience are important. The results of a series  of tests on hickory by the U.S. Forest Service show that \"the  work or shock-resisting ability is greatest in wide-ringed wood  that has from 5 to 14 rings per inch, is fairly constant from 14  to 38 rings, and decreases rapidly from 38 to 47 rings. The  strength at maximum load is not so great with the most  rapid-growing wood; it is maximum with from 14 to 20 rings per  inch, and again becomes less as the wood becomes more closely  ringed. The natural deduction is that wood of first-class  mechanical value shows from 5 to 20 rings per inch and that  slower growth yields poorer stock. Thus the inspector or buyer  of hickory should discriminate against timber that has more than  20 rings per inch. Exceptions exist, however, in the case of  normal growth upon dry situations, in which the slow-growing  material may be strong and tough.\"[20]    [Footnote 20: Bul. 80: The commercial hickories, pp. 48-50.]    The effect of rate of growth on the qualities of chestnut wood  is summarized by the same authority as follows: \"When the rings  are wide, the transition from spring wood to summer wood is  gradual, while in the narrow rings the spring wood passes into  summer wood abruptly. The width of the spring wood changes but  little with the width of the annual ring, so that the narrowing  or broadening of the annual ring is always at the expense of the  summer wood. The narrow vessels of the summer wood make it  richer in wood substance than the spring wood composed of wide  vessels. Therefore, rapid-growing specimens with wide rings have  more wood substance than slow-growing trees with narrow rings.  Since the more the wood substance the greater the weight, and  the greater the weight the stronger the wood, chestnuts with  wide rings must have stronger wood than chestnuts with narrow  rings. This agrees with the accepted view that sprouts (which  always have wide rings) yield better and stronger wood than  seedling chestnuts, which grow more slowly in diameter.\"[21]    [Footnote 21: Bul. 53: Chestnut in southern Maryland, pp.  20-21.]    In diffuse-porous woods, as has been stated, the vessels or  pores are scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in  the early wood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, not  the same as in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly  the conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that  such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when  very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood,  strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is  prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of  texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases  occur when there is little contrast between the late wood of one  season's growth and the early wood of the next.        HEARTWOOD AND SAPWOOD      Examination of the end of a log of many species reveals a  darker-colored inner portion--the _heartwood_, surrounded by a  lighter-colored zone--the _sapwood_. In some instances this  distinction in color is very marked; in others, the contrast is  slight, so that it is not always easy to tell where one leaves  off and the other begins. The color of fresh sapwood is always  light, sometimes pure white, but more often with a decided tinge  of green or brown.    Sapwood is comparatively new wood. There is a time in the early  history of every tree when its wood is all sapwood. Its  principal functions are to conduct water from the roots to the  leaves and to store up and give back according to the season the  food prepared in the leaves. The more leaves a tree bears and  the more thrifty its growth, the larger the volume of sapwood  required, hence trees making rapid growth in the open have  thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species  growing in dense forests. Sometimes trees grown in the open may  become of considerable size, a foot or more in diameter, before  any heartwood begins to form, for example, in second-growth  hickory, or field-grown white and loblolly pines.    As a tree increases in age and diameter an inner portion of the  sapwood becomes inactive and finally ceases to function. This  inert or dead portion is called heartwood, deriving its name  solely from its position and not from any vital importance to  the tree, as is shown by the fact that a tree can thrive with  its heart completely decayed. Some, species begin to form  heartwood very early in life, while in others the change comes  slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such trees as  chestnut, black locust, mulberry, Osage orange, and sassafras,  while in maple, ash, gum, hickory, hackberry, beech, and  loblolly pine, thick sapwood is the rule.    There is no definite relation between the annual rings of growth  and the amount of sapwood. Within the same species the  cross-sectional area of the sapwood is roughly proportional to  the size of the crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more  of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets  larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase  materially in volume. Sapwood is thicker in the upper portion of  the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the  diameter of the upper sections are less.    When a tree is very young it is covered with limbs almost, if  not entirely, to the ground, but as it grows older some or all  of them will eventually die and be broken off. Subsequent growth  of wood may completely conceal the stubs which, however, will  remain as knots. No matter how smooth and clear a log is on the  outside, it is more or less knotty near the middle. Consequently  the sapwood of an old tree, and particularly of a forest-grown  tree, will be freer from knots than the heartwood. Since in most  uses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and  interfere with its ease of working and other properties, it  follows that sapwood, because of its position in the tree, may  have certain advantages over heartwood.    It is really remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees  remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is  hundreds of years, and in a few instances thousands of years,  old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire,  insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay,  which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk.  The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels  remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages,  however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely  to its relative age and position.    If a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of  soil and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid  growth in youth, and gradually decline. The annual rings of  growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become  narrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down  on the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that  unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from  year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner. As a  tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual  wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the  width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so  much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle  for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth  may alternate. Some trees, such as southern oaks, maintain the  same width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole,  however, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the  growth rings decreases.    It is evident that there may be decided differences in the grain  of heartwood and sapwood cut from a large tree, particularly one  that is overmature. The relationship between width of growth  rings and the mechanical properties of wood is discussed under  Rate of Growth. In this connection, however, it may be stated  that as a general rule the wood laid on late in the life of a  tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than  that produced earlier. It follows that in a large log the"]]]
