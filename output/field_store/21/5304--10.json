Hence then the primeval islands had their gradual origin, were raised  but a few feet above the level of the sea, and were not exposed to the  great or sudden variations of heat and cold, as is so well explained in  Mr. Whitehurst's Theory of the Earth, chap. xvi. Whence the paradise of  the sacred writers, and the golden age of the profane ones, seems to  have had a real existence. As there can be no rainbow, when the heavens  are covered with clouds, because the sun-beams are then precluded from  falling upon the rain-drops opposite to the eye of the spectator, the  rainbow is a mark of gentle or partial showers. Mr. Whitehurst has  endeavoured to show that the primitive islands were only moistened by  nocturnal dews and not by showers, as occurs at this day to the Delta of  Egypt; and is thence of opinion, that the rainbow had no existence till  after the production of mountains and continents. As the salt of the sea  has been gradually accumulating, being washed down into it from the  recrements of animal and vegetable bodies, the sea must originally have  been as fresh as river water; and as it is not yet saturated with salt,  must become annually more saline. See note on l. 119 of this Canto.]             \"O'er those blest isles no ice-crown'd mountains tower'd,   40  No lightnings darted, and no tempests lower'd;       Soft fell the vesper-drops, condensed below,       Or bent in air the rain-refracted bow;       Sweet breathed the zephyrs, just perceiv'd and lost;       And brineless billows only kiss'd the coast;   45  Round the bright zodiac danced the vernal hours,       And Peace, the Cherub, dwelt in mortal bowers!             \"So young DIONE, nursed beneath the waves,       And rock'd by Nereids in their coral caves,       Charm'd the blue sisterhood with playful wiles,   50  Lisp'd her sweet tones, and tried her tender smiles.       Then, on her beryl throne by Triton's borne,       Bright rose the Goddess like the Star of morn;       When with soft fires the milky dawn He leads,       And wakes to life and love the laughing meads;--   55  With rosy fingers, as uncurl'd they hung       Round her fair brow, her golden locks she wrung;       O'er the smooth surge on silver sandals flood,       And look'd enchantment on the dazzled flood.--       The bright drops, rolling from her lifted arms,   60  In slow meanders wander o'er her charms,       Seek round her snowy neck their lucid track,       Pearl her white shoulders, gem her ivory back,       Round her fine waist and swelling bosom swim,       And star with glittering brine each crystal limb.--   65  --The immortal form enamour'd Nature hail'd,       And Beauty blazed to heaven and earth, unvail'd.      [_So young Dione_. l. 47. There is an antient gem representing Venus  rising out of the ocean supported by two Tritons. From the formality of  the design it would appear to be of great antiquity before the  introduction of fine taste into the world. It is probable that this  beautiful allegory was originally an hieroglyphic picture (before the  invention of letters) descriptive of the formation of the earth from the  ocean, which seems to have been an opinion of many of the most antient  philosophers.]             III. \"You! who then, kindling after many an age,       Saw with new fires the first VOLCANO rage,       O'er smouldering heaps of livid sulphur swell   70  At Earth's firm centre, and distend her shell,       Saw at each opening cleft the furnace glow,       And seas rush headlong on the gulphs below.--       GNOMES! how you shriek'd! when through the troubled air       Roar'd the fierce din of elemental war;   75  When rose the continents, and sunk the main,       And Earth's huge sphere exploding burst in twain.--       GNOMES! how you gazed! when from her wounded side       Where now the South-Sea heaves its waste of tide,       Rose on swift wheels the MOON'S refulgent car,   80  Circling the solar orb; a sister-star,       Dimpled with vales, with shining hills emboss'd,       And roll'd round Earth her airless realms of frost.      [_The first volcano_. l. 68. As the earth before the existence of  earthquakes was nearly level, and the greatest part of it covered with  sea; when the first great fires began deep in the internal parts of it,  those parts would become much expanded; this expansion would be  gradually extended, as the heat increased, through the whole terraqueous  globe of 7000 miles diameter; the crust would thence in many places open  into fissures, which by admitting the sea to flow in upon the fire,  would produce not only a quantity of steam beyond calculation by its  expansion, but would also by its decomposition produce inflammable air  and vital air in quantities beyond conception, sufficient to effect  those violent explosions, the vestiges of which all over the world  excite our admiration and our study; the difficulty of understanding how  subterraneous fires could exist without the presence of air has  disappeared since Dr. Priestley's discoveries of such great quantities  of pure air which constitute all the acids, and consequently exist in  all saline bodies, as sea-salt, nitre, lime-stone, and in all calciform  ores, as manganese, calamy, ochre, and other mineral substances. See an  ingenious treatise by Mr. Michel on earthquakes in the Philos. Trans.    In these first tremendous ignitions of the globe, as the continents were  heaved up, the vallies, which now hold the sea, were formed by the earth  subsiding into the cavities made by the rising mountains; as the steam,  which raised them condensed; which would thence not have any caverns of  great extent remain beneath them, as some philosophers have imagined.  The earthquakes of modern days are of very small extent indeed compared  to those of antient times, and are ingeniously compared by M. De Luc to  the operations of a mole-hill, where from a small cavity are raised from  time to time small quantities of lava or pumice stone. Monthly Review,  June, 1790.]    [_The moon's refulgent car_. l. 79. See additional notes, No. XV. on  solar volcanos.]    [_Her airless realms of frost_. l. 82. If the moon had no atmosphere at  the time of its elevation from the earth; or if its atmosphere was  afterwards stolen from it by the earth's attraction; the water on the  moon would rise quickly into vapour; and the cold produced by a certain  quantity of this evaporation would congeal the remainder of it. Hence it  is not probable that the moon is at present inhabited, but as it seems  to have suffered and to continue to suffer much by volcanos, a  sufficient quantity of air may in process of time be generated to  produce an atmosphere; which may prevent its heat from so easily  escaping, and its water from so easily evaporating, and thence become  fit for the production of vegetables and animals.    That the moon possesses little or no atmosphere is deduced from the  undiminished lustre of the stars, at the instant when they emerge from  behind her disk. That the ocean of the moon is frozen, is confirmed from  there being no appearance of lunar tides; which, if they existed, would  cover the part of her disk nearest the earth. See note on Canto III. l.  61.]              \"GNOMES! how you trembled! with the dreadful force       When Earth recoiling stagger'd from her course;   85  When, as her Line in slower circles spun,       And her shock'd axis nodded from the sun,       With dreadful march the accumulated main       Swept her vast wrecks of mountain, vale, and plain;       And, while new tides their shouting floods unite,   90  And hail their Queen, fair Regent of the night;       Chain'd to one centre whirl'd the kindred spheres,       And mark'd with lunar cycles solar years.      [_When earth recoiling_. l. 84. On supposition that the moon was thrown  from the earth by the explosion of water or the generation of other  vapours of greater power, the remaining part of the globe would recede  from its orbit in one direction as the moon receded in another, and that  in proportion to the respective momentum of each, and would afterwards  revolve round their common centre of gravity.    If the moon rose from any part of the earth except exactly at the line  or poles, the shock would tend to turn the axis of the earth out of its  previous direction. And as a mass of matter rising from deep parts of  the globe would have previously acquired less diurnal velocity than the  earth's surface from whence it rose, it would receive during the time of  its rising additional velocity from the earth's surface, and would  consequently so much retard the motion of the earth round its axis.    When the earth thus receded the shock would overturn all its buildings  and forests, and the water would rush with inconceivable violence over  its surface towards the new satellite, from two causes, both by its not  at first acquiring the velocity with which the earth receded, and by the  attraction of the new moon, as it leaves the earth; on these accounts at  first there would be but one tide till the moon receded to a greater  distance, and the earth moving round a common centre of gravity between  them, the water on the side furthest from the moon would acquire a  centrifugal force in respect to this common centre between itself and  the moon.]             IV. \"GNOMES! you then bade dissolving SHELLS distil       From the loose summits of each shatter'd hill,   95  To each fine pore and dark interstice flow,       And fill with liquid chalk the mass below.

Turn the meat several times in the pot. When all is  done, serve up the meat and vegetables together, and the gravy in  a boat, having first skimmed it.    This is a good family dish.    You may add turnips (pared and sliced) to the other vegetables.    Fresh pork may be stewed in this manner, or with sweet potatoes.      TO STEW A ROUND OF BEEF.    Trim off some pieces from a round of fresh beef--take out the bone  and break it. Put the bone and the trimmings into a pan with some  cold water, and add an onion, a carrot, and a turnip all cut in  pieces, and a bunch, of sweet herbs. Simmer them for an hour, and  having skimmed it well, strain off the liquid. Season the meat  highly with what is called kitchen pepper, that is, a mixture, in  equal quantities, of black or white pepper, allspice, cinnamon,  cloves, ginger and nutmeg, all finely powdered. Fasten it with  skewers, and tie it firmly round with tape. Lay skewers in the  bottom of the stew-pan; place the beef upon them, and then pour  over it the gravy you have prepared from the bone and trimmings.  Simmer it about an hour and a half, and then turn the meat over,  and add to it three carrots, three turnips, and two onions all  sliced, and a glass of tarragon vinegar. Keep the lid close,  except when you are skimming off the fat. Let the meat stew till  it is thoroughly done and tender throughout. The time will depend  on the size of the round. It may require from five or six to eight  hours.    Just before you take it up, stir into the gravy a table-spoonful  or two of mushroom catchup, a little made mustard, and a piece of  butter rolled in flour.    Send it to table hot, with the gravy poured round it.      ANOTHER WAY TO STEW A ROUND OF BEEF,    Take a round of fresh beef (or the half of one if it is very  large) and remove the bone. The day before you cook it, lay it in  a pickle made of equal proportions of water and vinegar with salt  to your taste. Next morning take it out of the pickle, put it into  a large pot or stew-pan, and just cover it with water. Put in with  it two or three large onion a few cloves, a little whole black  pepper, and a large glass of port or claret. If it is a whole  round of beef allow two glasses of wine. Stew it slowly for at  least four hours or more, in proportion to its size. It must be  thoroughly done, and tender all through. An hour before you send  it to table take the meat out of the pot, and pour the gravy into  a pan. Put a large lump of butter into the pot, dredge the beef  with flour, and return it to the pot to brown, turning it often to  prevent its burning. Or it will be better to put it into a Dutch  oven. Cover the lid with hot coals, renewing them as they go out.  Take the gravy that you poured from the meat, and skim off all the  fat. Put it into a sauce-pan, and mix with it a little butter  rolled in flour, and add some more cloves and wine. Give it a boil  up. If it is not well browned, burn some sugar on a hot shovel,  and stir it in.    If you like it stuffed, have ready when you take the meat out of  the pickle, a force-meat of grated bread crumbs, sweet herbs,  butter, spice, pepper and salt, and minced parsley, mixed with  beaten yolk of egg. Fill with this the opening from whence you  took the bone, and bind a tape firmly round the meat.      BEEF BOUILLI.    Take part of a round of fresh beef (or if you prefer it a piece of  the flank or brisket) and rub it with salt. Place skewers in the  bottom of the stew-pot, and lay the meat upon them with barely  water enough to cover it. To enrich the gravy you may add the  necks and other trimmings of whatever poultry you may happen to  have; also the root of a tongue, if convenient. Cover the pot, and  set it over a quick fire. When it boils and the scum has risen,  skim it well, and then diminish the fire so that the meat shall  only simmer; or you may set the pot on hot coals. Then put in four  or five carrots sliced thin, a head of celery cut up, and four or  fire sliced turnips. Add a bunch of sweet herbs, and a small  table-spoonful of black pepper-corns tied in a thin muslin rag. Let  it stew slowly for four or fire hours, and then add a dozen very  small onions roasted and peeled, and a large table-spoonful of  capers or nasturtians. You may, if you choose, stick a clove in  each onion. Simmer it half an hour longer, then take up the meat,  and place-it in a dish, laying the vegetables round it. Skim and  strain the gravy; season it with catchup, and made mustard, and  serve it up in a boat. Mutton may be cooked in this manner.      HASHED BEEF.    Take some roast beef that has been very much under-done,  and having cut off the fat and skin, put the trimmings  with the bones broken up into a stew-pan with two large  onions sliced, a few sliced potatoes, and a bunch of sweet  herbs. Add about a pint of warm water, or broth if you have  it. This is to make the gravy. Cover it closely, and let it  simmer for about an hour. Then skim and strain it, carefully  removing every particle of fat.    Take another stew-pot, and melt in it a piece of butter,  about the size of a large walnut. When it has melted, shake  in a spoonful of flour. Stir it a few minutes, and then add  to it the strained gravy. Let it come to a boil, and then put  to it a table-spoonful of catchup, and the beef cut either in  thin small slices or in mouthfuls. Let it simmer from five to  ten minutes, but do not allow it to boil, lest (having been  cooked already) it should become tasteless and insipid.  Serve it up in a deep dish with thin slices of toast cut into  triangular or pointed pieces, the crust omitted. Dip the toast in  the gravy, and lay the pieces in regular order round the sides of  the dish.    You may hash mutton or veal in the same manner, adding sliced  carrots, turnips, potatoes, or any vegetables you please. Tomatas  are an improvement.    To hash cold meat is an economical way of using it; but there is  little or no nutriment in it after being twice cooked, and the  natural flavour is much impaired by the process.    Hashed meat would always be much better if the slices were cut  from the joint or large piece as soon as it leaves the table, and  soaked in the gravy till next day.      BEEF CAKES.    Take some cold roast beef that has been under-done, and mince it  very fine. Mix with it grated bread crumbs, and a little chopped  onion and parsley. Season it with pepper and salt, and moisten it  with some beef-dripping and a little walnut or onion pickle. Some  scraped cold tongue or ham will be found an improvement. Make it  into broad flat cakes, and spread a coat of mashed potato thinly  on the top and bottom of each. Lay a small bit of butter on the  top of every cake, and set them in an oven to warm and brown.    Beef cakes are frequently a breakfast dish.    Any other cold fresh meat may be prepared in the same manner.    Cold roast beef may be cut into slices, seasoned with salt and  pepper, broiled a few minutes over a clear fire, and served up hot  with a little butter spread on them.      TO ROAST A BEEF'S HEART.    Cut open the heart, and (having removed the ventricles) soak it in  cold water to free it from the blood, Parboil it about ten  minutes. Prepare, a force-meat of grated bread crumbs, butter or  minced suet, sweet marjoram and parsley chopped fine, a little  grated lemon-peel, nutmeg, pepper, and salt to your taste, and  some yolk of egg to bind the ingredients. Stuff the heart with the  force-meat, and secure the opening by tying a string around it.  Put it on a spit, and roast it till it is tender throughout.    Add to the gravy a piece of butter rolled in flour, and a glass of  red wine. Serve up the heart very hot in a covered dish. It chills  immediately.    Eat currant jelly with it.    Boiled beef's heart is frequently used in mince pies.      TO STEW A BEEF'S HEART.    Clean the heart, and cut it lengthways into large pieces. Put them  into a pot with a little salt and pepper, and cover them with cold  water. Parboil them for a quarter of an hour, carefully skimming  off the blood that rises to the top. Then take them out, cut them,  into mouthfuls, and having strained the liquid, return them to it,  adding a head or two of chopped celery, a few sliced onions, a  dozen potatoes pared and quartered, and a piece of butter rolled  in flour. Season with whole pepper, and a few cloves if you like.  Let it stew slowly till all the pieces of heart and the vegetables  are quite tender.    You may stew a beef's kidney in the same manner.    The heart and liver of a calf make a good dish cooked as above.      TO DRESS BEEF KIDNEY.    Having soaked a fresh kidney in cold water and dried it in a  cloth, cut it into mouthfuls, and then mince it fine. Dust it with  flour. Put some butter into a stew-pan over a moderate fire, and  when it boils put in the minced kidney. When you have browned it  in the butter, sprinkle on a little salt and cayenne pepper, and  pour in a very little boiling water. Add a glass of champagne or  other wine, or a large tea-spoonful of mushroom catchup, or of  walnut pickle. Cover the pan closely, and let it stew till the  kidney is tender. Send it to table hot in a covered dish. It is  eaten generally at breakfast.      TO BOIL TRIPE.    Wash it well in warm water, and trim it nicely, taking off all the  fat. Cut it into small pieces, and put it on to boil five hours  before dinner, in water enough to cover it very well. After it has  boiled four hours, pour off the water, season the tripe with  pepper and salt, and put it into a pot with milk and water mixed  in equal quantities. Boil it an hour in the milk and water.    Boil in a sauce-pan ten or a dozen onions. When they are quite  soft, drain them in a cullender, and mash them. Wipe out your  sauce-pan and put them on again, with a bit of butter rolled in  flour, and a wine-glass of cream or milk. Let them boil up, and  add them to the tripe"]]]
