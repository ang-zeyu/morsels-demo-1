[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],[0,"The Night Horseman (#13)"],[1,"a shot-gun; in another was a pile of  provisions--bacon, flour, salt, meal, and little else. Spices and  condiments were apparently unknown to this hermit; nor was there even  the inevitable coffee, nor any of the molasses or other sweets which the  tongue of the desert-mountainer cannot resist. Flour, meat, and water,  it seemed, made up the entire fare of the trapper. For cookery there was  an unboarded space in the very centre of the floor with a number of  rocks grouped around in the hole and blackened with soot. The smoke  must rise, therefore, and escape through the small hole in the centre of  the roof. The length of stove-pipe which showed on the roof must have  been simply the inhabitant's idea of giving the last delicate touch of  civilisation; it was like a tassel to the cap of the Turk.    As Haw-Haw's observations reached this point his sharp ear caught the  faint whinny of the big horse outside. He started like one caught in a  guilty act, and sprang to the lantern. However, with his hands upon it  he thought better of it, and he placed the light against the wall; then  he turned to the entrance and looked anxiously up the hillside.    What he saw was a form grotesque beyond belief. It seemed to be some  gigantic wild beast--mountain lion or great bear, though of a size  beyond credence--which slowly sprawled down the slope walking erect upon  its hind feet with its forelegs stretched out horizontal, as if it were  warning all who might behold it away. Haw-Haw grew pale and  involuntarily reached for his gun as he first beheld this apparition,  but instantly he saw the truth. It was a man who carried a burden down  the mountain-side. The burden was the carcass of a bear; the man had  drawn the forelegs over his shoulders--his jutting elbows making what  had seemed the outstretched arms--and above the head of the  burden-bearer rose the great head of the bear. As the man came closer  the animal's head flopped to one side and a red tongue lolled from its  mouth. Haw-Haw Langley moved back step by step through the cabin until  his shoulders struck the opposite wall, and at the same time Mac Strann  entered the room. He had no ear for his visitor's hail, but cast his  burden to the floor. It dropped with a shock that shook the house from  the rattling stove-pipe to the crackling boards. For a moment Mac Strann  regarded his prey. Then he stooped and drew open the great jaws. The  mouth within was not so red as the bloody hands of Mac Strann; and the  big, white fangs, for some reason, did not seem terrible in comparison  with the hunter. Having completed his survey he turned slowly upon  Haw-Haw Langley and lowered his eyebrows to stare.    So doing, the light for the first time struck full upon his face.  Haw-Haw Langley bit his thin lips and his eyes widened almost to the  normal.    For the ugliness of Mac Strann was that most terrible species of  ugliness--not disfigured features but a discord which pervaded the man  and came from within him--like a sound. Feature by feature his face was  not ugly. The mouth was very large, to be sure, and the jaw too heavily  square, and the nose needed somewhat greater length and less width for  real comeliness. The eyes were truly fine, being very large and black,  though when Mac Strann lowered his bush of brows his eyes were  practically reduced to gleams of light in the consequent shadow. There  was a sharp angle in his forehead, the lines of it meeting in the centre  and shelving up and down. One felt, unpleasantly, that there were heavy  muscles overlaying that forehead. One felt that to the touch it would be  a pad of flesh, and it gave to Mac Strann, more than any other feature,  a peculiar impression of resistless physical power.    In the catalogue of his features, indeed, there was nothing severely  objectionable; but out of it came a feeling of _too much strength!_ A  glance at his body reinsured the first thought. It was not normal. His  shirt bulged tightly at the shoulders with muscles. He was not  tall--inches shorter than his brother Jerry, for instance--but the bulk  of his body was incredible. His torso was a veritable barrel that bulged  out both in the chest and the back. And even the tremendous thighs of  Mac Strann were perceptibly bowed out by the weight which they had to  carry. And there was about his management of his arms a peculiar  awkwardness which only the very strongest of men exhibit--as if they  were burdened by the weight of their mere dangling hands.    This giant, having placed his eyes in shadow, peered for a long moment  at Haw-Haw Langley, but very soon his glance began to waver. It flashed  towards the wall--it came back and rested upon Langley again. He was  like a dog, restless under a steady stare. And as Haw-Haw Langley noted  this a glitter of joy came in his beady eyes.    \"You're Jerry's man,\" said Mac Strann at length.    There was about his voice the same fleshy quality that was in his face;  it came literally from his stomach, and it made a peculiar rustling  sound such as comes after one has eaten sticky sweet things. People  could listen to the voice of Mac Strann and forget that he was speaking  words. The articulation ran together in a sort of glutinous mass.    \"I'm a friend of Jerry's,\" said the other. \"I'm Langley.\"    The big man stretched out his hand. The hair grew black, down to the  knuckles; the blood of the bear still streaked it; it was large enough  to be an organism with independent life. But when Langley, with some  misgiving, trusted his own bony fingers within that grasp, in was only  as if something fleshy, soft, and bloodless had closed over them. When  his hand was released he rubbed it covertly against his trowser leg--to  remove dirt--restore the circulation. He did not know why.    \"Who's bothering Jerry?\" asked Mac Strann. \"And where is he?\"    He went to the wall without waiting for an answer and took down the  saddle. Now the cowpuncher's saddle is a heavy mass of leather and  steel, and the saddle of Mac Strann was far larger than the ordinary.  Yet he took down the saddle as one might remove a card from a rack.  Haw-Haw Langley moved towards the door, to give himself a free space for  exit.    \"Jerry's hurt,\" he said, and he watched.    There was a ripple of pain on the face of Mac Strann.    \"Hoss kicked him--fall on him?\" he asked.    \"It weren't a hoss.\"    \"Huh? A cow?\"    \"It weren't no cow. It weren't no animal.\"    Mac Strann faced full upon Langley. When he spoke it seemed as if it  were difficult for him to manage his lips. They lifted an appreciable  space before there was any sound.    \"What was it?\"    \"A man.\"    Langley edged back towards the door.    \"What with?\"    \"A gun.\"    And Langley saw the danger that was coming even before Mac Strann moved.  He gave a shrill yelp of terror and whirled and sprang for the open. But  Mac Strann sprang after him and reached. His whole body seemed to  stretch like an elastic thing, and his arm grew longer. The hand  fastened on the back of Langley, plucked him up, and jammed him against  the wall. Haw-Haw crumpled to the floor.    He gasped: \"It weren't me, Mac. For Gawd's sake, it weren't me!\"    His face was a study. There was abject terror in it, and yet there was  also a sort of grisly joy, and his eyes feasted on the silent agony of  Mac Strann.    \"Where?\" asked Mac Strann.    \"Mac,\" pleaded the vulture who cringed on the floor, \"gimme your word  you ain't goin' to hold it agin me.\"    \"Tell me,\" said the other, and he framed the face of the vulture between  his large hands. If he pressed the heels of those hands together bones  would snap, and Haw-Haw Langley knew it. And yet nothing but a wild  delight could have set that glitter in his little eyes, just as nothing  but a palsy of terror could have set his limbs twitching so.    \"Who shot him from behind?\" demanded the giant.    \"It wasn't from behind,\" croaked the bearer of ill-tidings. \"It was from  the front.\"    \"While he wasn't looking?\"    \"No. He was beat to the draw.\"    \"You're _lyin'_ to me,\" said Mac Strann slowly.    \"So help me God!\" cried Langley.    \"Who done it?\"    \"A little feller. He ain't half as big as me. He's got a voice like  Kitty Jackson, the school-marm; and he's got eyes like a starved  pup. It was him that done it.\"    The eyes of Mac Strann grew vaguely meditative.    \"Nope,\" he mused, in answer to his own thoughts, \"I won't use no rope.  I'll use my hands. Where'd the bullet land?\"    A fresh agony of trembling shook Langley, and a fresh sparkle came in  his glance.    \"Betwixt his ribs, Mac. And right on through. And it come out his back!\"    But there was not an answering tremor in Mac Strann. He let his hands  fall away from the face of the vulture and he caught up the saddle.  Langley straightened himself. He peered anxiously at Strann, as if he  feared to miss something.    \"I dunno whether he's livin' right now, or not,\" suggested Haw-Haw.    But Mac Strann was already striding through the door.           *       *       *       *       *    Sweat was pouring from the lather-flecked bodies of their horses when  they drew rein, at last, at the goal of their long, fierce ride; and  Haw-Haw slunk behind the broad form of Mac Strann when the latter strode  into the hotel. Then the two started for the room in which, they were  told, lay Jerry Strann.    \"There it is,\" whispered Haw-Haw, as they reached the head of the  stairs. \"The door's open. If he was dead the door would be closed, most  like.\"    They stood in the hall and looked in upon a strange picture, for flat in  the bed lay Jerry Strann, his face very white and oddly thin, and over  him leaned the man who had shot him down.    They heard Dan Barry's soft, gentle voice query: \"How you feelin' now,  partner?\"    He leaned close beside the other, his fingers upon the wrist of Jerry.    \"A pile better,\" muttered Jerry Strann. \"Seems like I got more'n a  fightin' chance to pull "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12443"],[0,"The Jute Industry: From Seed to Finished Cloth (#13)"],[1,"and at uniform speed.    During the operation, the measuring roller and its subsequent train  of wheels and shafts indicates the length of yarn which has passed  over, also the number of \"cuts\" or \"pieces\" of any desired length; in  addition, part of the measuring and marking mechanism uses an  ink-pad to mark the yarn at the end of each cut, such mark to act as  a guide for the weaver, and to indicate the length of warp which has  been woven. Thus if the above warp were intended to be five cuts,  each 120 yards, or 600 yards in all, the above apparatus would  measure and indicate the yards and cuts, and would introduce a mark  at intervals of 120 yards on some of the threads. And all this is  done without stopping the machine. At the time of marking, or  immediately before or after, just as desired, a bell is made to ring  automatically so that the attendant is warned when the mark on the  warp is about to approach the loom beam. This bell is shown in Fig.  29, near the right-hand curved outer surface of the central frame.    As in hand warping or in linking, a single-thread lease is made at  the end of the desired length of warp, or else what is known as a  pair of \"clasp-rods\" is arranged to grip the sheet of warp threads.    After the loom beam, with its length of warp, has been removed from  the machine, the threads are either drawn through the eyes or mails  of the cambs (termed gears, healds or heddles in other districts)  and through the weaving reed, or else they are tied to the ends of  the threads of the previous warp which, with the weft, has been  woven into cloth. These latter threads are still intact in the cambs  and reed in the loom.          CHAPTER XIV.  TYING-ON, DRAWING-IN, AND WEAVING    If all the threads of the newly-dressed warp can be tied on to the  ends of the warp which has been woven, it is only necessary, when  the tying-on process is completed, to rotate the loom beam slowly,  and simultaneously to draw forward the threads until all the knots  have passed through the cambs and the reed, and sufficiently far  forward to be clear of the latter when it approaches its full forward,  or beating up, position during the operation of weaving.    If, on the other hand, the threads of the newly-dressed, or  newly-beamed, warp had to be drawn-in and reeded, these operations  would be performed in the drawing-in and reeding department, and,  when completed, the loom beam with its attached warp threads, cambs  and reed, would be taken bodily to the loom where the \"tenter,\"  \"tackler\" or \"tuner\" adjusts all the parts preparatory to the actual  operation of weaving. The latter work is often termed \"gaiting a web.\"    There is a great similarity in many of the operations of weaving the  simpler types of cloth, although there may be a considerable  difference in the appearance of the cloths themselves. In nearly all  the various branches of the textile industry the bulk of the work in  the weaving departments of such branches consists of the manufacture  of comparatively simple fabrics. Thus, in the jute industry, there  are four distinct types of cloth which predominate over all others;  these types are known respectively as hessian, bagging, tarpauling  and sacking. In addition to these main types, there are several  other simple types the structure of which is identical with one or  other of the above four; while finally there are the more elaborate  types of cloth which are embodied in the various structures of  carpets and the like.    It is obviously impossible to discuss the various makes in a work of  this kind; the commoner types are described in _Jute and Linen  Weaving Calculations and Structure of Fabrics_; and the more  elaborate ones, as well as several types of simple ones, appear in  _Textile Design: Pure and Applied_, both by T. Woodhouse and T.  Milne.    Six distinct types of jute fabrics are illustrated in Fig. 32. The  technical characteristics of each are as follows--    [Illustration: FIG. 32 SIX DISTINCT KINDS OF TYPICAL JUTE FABRICS]    H.--An ordinary \"HESSIAN\" cloth made from comparatively fine single    warp and single weft, and the threads interlaced in the simplest    order, termed \"plain weave.\" A wide range of cloths is made from the    scrims or net-like fabrics to others more closely woven than that    illustrated.    B.--A \"BAGGING\" made from comparatively fine single warp arranged in    pairs and then termed \"double warp.\" The weft is thick, and the    weave is also plain.    T.--A \"TARPAULING\" made from yarns similar to those in bagging,    although there is a much wider range in the thickness of the weft.    It is a much finer cloth than the typical bagging, but otherwise the    structures are identical.    S.--A striped \"SACKING\" made from comparatively fine warp yarns,    usually double as in bagging, but occasionally single, with medium    or thick weft interwoven in 3-leaf or 4-leaf twill order. The weaves    are shown in Fig. 33.    C.--One type of \"CARPET\" cloth made exclusively from two-ply or    two-fold coloured warp yarns, and thick black single weft yarns. The    threads and picks are interwoven in two up, two down twill, directed    to right and then to left, and thus forming a herring-bone pattern,    or arrow-head pattern.    P.-An uncut pile fabric known as \"BRUSSELLETTE.\" The figuring warp    is composed of dyed and printed yarns mixed to form an indefinite    pattern, and works in conjunction with a ground warp and weft. The    weave is again plain, although the structure of the fabric is quite    different from the other plain cloths illustrated. The cloth is    reversible, the two sides being similar structure but differing    slightly in colour ornamentation.    As already indicated, there are several degrees of fineness or  coarseness in all the groups, particularly in the types marked H, B,  T and S. The structure or weave in all varieties of any one group is  constant and as stated.    All the weaves are illustrated in the usual technical manner in Fig.  33, and the relation between the simplest of these weaves and the  yarns of the cloth is illustrated in Fig. 34. In Fig. 33, the unit  weaves in A, B, C, D, E and F are shown in solid squares, while the  repetitions of the units in each case are represented by the dots.    [Illustration: FIG. 33 POINT-PAPER DESIGNS SHOWING WEAVERS FOR  VARIOUS CLOTHS]    [Illustration: FIG. 34 DIAGRAMMATIC VIEWS OF THE STRUCTURE OF PLAIN  CLOTH]    A is the plain weave, 16 units shown, and used for fabrics H and P,  Fig. 32.    B is the double warp plain wave, 8 units shown, and shows the method  of interlacing the yarns h patterns B and T, Fig. 32. When the warp  is made double as indicated in weave _B_, the effect in the cloth  can be produced by using the mechanical arrangements employed for  weave _A_. Hence, the cloths _H_, _B_ and _T_ can be woven without  any mechanical alteration in the loom.    _C_ is the 3-leaf double warp sacking weave and shows 4 units;  since each pair of vertical rows of small squares consists of two  identical single rows, they may be represented as at _D_. The actual  structure of the cloth _S_ in Fig. 32 is represented on design paper  at _C_, Fig. 33.    _D_ is the single warp 3-leaf sacking weave, 4 units shown, but  the mechanical parts for weaving both _C_ and _D_ remain constant.    _E_ is the double warp 4-leaf sacking, 2 units shown, while    _F_ is the single warp 4-leaf sacking, 4 units shown.    The patterns or cloths for _E_ and _F_ are not illustrated.    _G_ is a \"herring-bone\" design on 24 threads and 4 picks, two  units shown. It is typical of the pattern represented at _C_, Fig. 32,  and involves the use of 4 leaves in the loom.    The solid squares in weave _A_, Fig. 33, are reproduced in the  left-hand bottom corner of Fig. 34. A diagrammatic plan of a plain  cloth produced by this simple order of interlacing is exhibited in  the upper part by four shaded threads of warp and four black picks  of weft (the difference is for distinction only). The left-hand  intersection shows one thread interweaving with all the four picks,  while the bottom intersection shows all the four threads  interweaving with one pick. The two arrows from the weave or design  to the thread and pick respectively show the connection, and it will  be seen that a mark (solid) on the design represents a warp thread  on the surface of the cloth, while a blank square represents a weft  shot on the surface, and _vice versa_.    A weaving shed full of various types of looms, and all driven by  belts from an overhead shaft, is illustrated in Fig. 35. The loom in  the foreground is weaving a 3-leaf sacking similar to that  illustrated at _S_, Fig. 32. while the appearance of a full weaver's  warp beam is shown distinctly in the second loom in Fig. 35. There  are hundreds of looms in this modern weaving shed.    [Illustration: FIG. 35 WEAVING SHED WITH BELT-DRIVEN LOOMS]    During the operation of weaving, the shuttle, in which is placed a  cop of weft, similar to that on the cop winding machine in Fig. 25,  and with the end of the weft threaded through the eye of the shuttle,  is driven alternately from side to side of the cloth through the  opening or \"shed\" formed by two layers of the warp. The positions of  the threads in these two layers are represented by the designs, see  Fig. 33, and while one layer occupies a high position in the loom  the other layer occupies a low position. The threads of the warp are  placed in these two positions by the leaves of the camb (termed  healds and also gears in other districts) and it is between these  two layers that the shuttle passes, forms a selvage at the edge each  time it makes a journey across, and leaves a trail or length of weft  each journey. The support or lay upon which the shuttle travels  moves back to provide room for the shuttle to pass between the two  layers of threads, and after the shuttle reaches the end of each"]]]
