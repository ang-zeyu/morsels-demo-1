I do not, O Suta, think life  worth much, having fled from the field like a coward, and my back  pierced, with the arrows (of the enemy)! Hast thou ever seen me, O son  of Suta, fly in fear from the field of battle like a coward? O son of  Daruka, it behoved thee not to forsake the battle, while my desire of  fight was not yet gratified! Do thou, therefore, go back to the  field.\"'\"      SECTION XIX    \"Vasudeva continued, 'Thus addressed, the son of Suta race replied in  haste unto Pradyumna, that foremost of all endued with strength, in  these sweet words, \"O son of Rukmini, I fear not to guide the horses on  the field of battle, and I am acquainted also with the customs of the  Vrishnis in war! It is not otherwise in the least! But, O thou blest  with length of days, those that guide the car are taught that the  warrior on the car is, by all means, to be protected by his charioteer!  Thou wert also much afflicted! Thou wert much wounded by the arrows shot  by Salwa. Thou wert also deprived of thy senses, O hero! Therefore is it  that I retired from the field. But, O chief of the Satwatas, now that  thou hast regained thy senses without much ado, do thou, O son of  Kesava, witness my skill in guiding the horses! I have been begotten by  Daruka, and I have been duly trained! I will now penetrate into the  celebrated array of Salwa without fear!\"'    \"Vasudeva continued, 'Saying this, O hero, the charioteer, pulling the  reins, began to lead the horses with speed towards the field of battle.  And, O king, struck with the whip and pulled by the reins those  excellent steeds seemed to be flying in the air, performing various  beautiful motions, now circular, now similar, now dissimilar, now to the  right, now to the left. And, O king, those steeds understanding as it  were the intention of Daruka's son endued with such lightness of hand,  burned with energy, and seemed to go without touching the ground with  their feet! That bull among men wheeled round Salwa's host so easily  that they who witnessed it wondered exceedingly. And the lord of Saubha,  unable to bear that manoeuvre of Pradyumna, instantly sent three shafts  at the charioteer of his antagonist! The charioteer, however, without  taking any note of the force of those arrows, continued to go along the  right. Then the lord of Saubha, O hero, again discharged at my son by  Rukmini, a shower of various kinds of weapons! But that slayer of  hostile heroes, the son of Rukmini, showing with a smile his lightness  of hand, cut all those weapons off as they reached him. Finding his  arrows cut by Pradyumna, the lord of Saubha, having recourse to the  dreadful illusion natural to _Asuras_ began to pour a thick shower of  arrows. But cutting into pieces those powerful Daitya weapons shot at  him in mid-career by means of his _Brahma_ weapon, Pradyumna discharged  winged shafts of other kings. And these delighting in blood, warding off  the shafts of Daitya, pierced his head, bosom and face. And at those  wounds Salwa fell down senseless. And on the mean-minded Salwa falling  down, afflicted with Pradyumna's arrows, the son of Rukmini aimed  another arrow at him, capable of destroying every foe. And beholding  that arrow worshipped by all the Dasarhas, and flaming like fire and  fatal as a venomous snake, fixed on the bow-string, the firmament was  filled with exclamations of _Oh!_ and _Alas!_ Then all the celestials  with Indra and the lord of treasures (Kubera) at their head sent Narada  and the god of wind endued with the speed of the mind. And these two  approaching the son of Rukmini delivered unto him the message of the  celestial, saying, O hero, king Salwa is not to be slain by thee! Do  thou draw back the arrow. He is unslayable by thee in fight! There  breatheth not a person who cannot be killed by that arrow! O thou of  mighty arms, the Creator hath ordained his death at the hands of  Krishna, the son of Devaki! Let this be not falsified!--Thereupon with a  glad heart, Pradyumna withdrew that best of arrows from his excellent  bow and deposited it back in his quiver. And then, O foremost of kings,  the mighty Salwa, afflicted with the arrows of Pradyumna, rose  disheartened, and speedily went away. Then O king, the wicked Salwa,  thus afflicted by the Vrishnis, mounted on his car of precious metals,  and leaving Dwaraka scudded through the skies!'\"      SECTION XX    \"Vasudeva said, 'When Salwa had left the city of the Anarttas, I  returned to it, O king, on the completion of thy great _Rajasuya_  sacrifice! On my arrival I found Dwaraka shorn of its splendour, and, O  great monarch, there were not sounds of Vedic recitation or sacrificial  offering. And the excellent damsels were all destitute of ornaments, and  the gardens were devoid of beauty. And alarmed by the aspect, I asked  the son of Hridika saying, \"Why is it that the men and women of the city  of the Vrishnis are so woe-begone, O tiger among men?\" O thou best of  kings thus asked the son of Hridika (Kritavarman) relate to me in detail  the invasion of the city by Salwa, and his subsequent departure from it.  And, O thou foremost of Bharatas, hearing all, even then I made up my  mind to slay Salwa. And encouraging the citizens, O best of Bharatas, I  cheerfully addressed king Ahuka, and Anakdundhuvi, and the chief heroes  of the Vrishni race, saying, \"Do ye, O bulls among the Yadavas, stay in  the city, taking every care, and know that I go to slay Salwa! I return  not to the city of Dwaravati without slaying him. I will again come to  ye having compassed the destruction of Salwa together with his car of  precious metals. Do ye strike up the sharp and middle and flat notes of  the Dundhuvi so dreadful to foes!\" And O thou bull of the Bharata race,  thus adequately encouraged by me, those heroes cheerfully said unto me,  \"Go and slay the enemies!\" And thus receiving the benedictions of those  warriors with glad hearts, and causing the Brahmanas to utter auspicious  words and bowing down to the best of the regenerate ones, and to Siva  also, I set out on my car unto which were yoked the horses _Saivya_, and  _Sugriva_, filling all sides with the clatter (of my wheels) and blowing  that best of conchs, the _Panchajanya_! And, O king, O tiger among men,  accompanied by my redoubted and victorious army consisting of the four  kinds of the forces so persevering in battle, I set out. And leaving  many countries, and mountains, crowned with trees, and pieces of water,  and streams, I at last arrived at the country of Matrikavarta. It is  there, O thou tiger among men, that I heard that Salwa was coursing on  his car of precious metals near the ocean, and I followed in his  pursuit. And, O thou slayer of thy foes, having reached the main, Salwa  on his car of costly metals was in the midst of the deep heaving with  billows! And on seeing me from a distance, O Yudhishthira, that one of  wicked soul himself challenged me repeatedly to the fight. And many  arrows capable of piercing to the quick, discharged from my bow reached  not his car. And at this I was wroth! And, O king, that essentially  sinful wretch of a Daitya's son of irrepressible energy, on his part  began to shoot thousand upon thousands of arrows in torrents! And, O  Bharata, he rained shafts upon my soldiers and upon my charioteer and  upon my steeds! But without thinking of the shafts, we continued the  conflict. Then the warriors following Salwa poured on me straight arrows  by thousands. And the Asuras covered my horses and my car and Daruka  with arrows capable of piercing the very vitals. And, O hero, I could  not at that time see either my horses, or my car, or my charioteer  Daruka! And I with my army was covered with weapons. And, O son of  Kunti, superhumanly skilled in weapons, I also let fly from my bow  arrows by tens of thousands, inspiring them with _mantras_! But as that  car of costly metals was in the sky, full two miles off, it could not, O  Bharata, be seen by my troops. They could therefore only remaining on  the field of battle look on like spectators in a place of amusement,  cheering me on by shouts loud as the roar of the lion, and also by the  sound of their clapping. And the tinted arrows shot by the fore-part of  hand penetrated into the bodies of the Danavas like biting insects. And  then arose cries in the car of precious metals from those that were  dying of wounds by those sharp arrows and falling into the waters of the  mighty ocean. And the Danavas deprived of their arms, necks, and wearing  the form of _Kavandhas_,--fell, sending up tremendous roars. And as they  fell they were devoured by animals living in the waters of the ocean.  And then I powerfully blew the _Panchajanya_ obtained from the waters  and graceful as the lotus-stalk and white as milk or the _Kunda_ flower  or the moon or silver. And seeing his soldiers fall, Salwa the possessor  of the car of precious metals, began to fight with the help of illusion.  And then he began to ceaselessly hurl at me maces, and ploughshares, and  winged darts and lances, and javelins, and battle-axes, and swords and  arrows blazing like javelins and thunderbolts, and nooses, and broad  swords, and bullets from barrels, and shafts, and axes, and rockets. And  permitting them to come towards me, I soon destroyed them all by  counter-illusion. And on this illusion being rendered ineffectual, he  began the contest with mountain peaks. And, O Bharata, then there was  darkness and light alternately, and the day was now fair, and now  gloomy, and now hot, and now cold. And there was a perfect shower of  coals, and ashes, and weapons. And creating such illusion the enemy  fought with me. And ascertaining it I destroyed his illusion by  counter-illusion. And in the due time I showered arrows all round. And  then, O mighty king, the dome of heaven blazed as with a hundred suns,  and, O son of Kunti, with one hundred moons, and thousands and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11924"],[0,"The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry (#13)"],[1,"and finally, collect together but not marry sixteen  thousand one hundred virgin daughters of different kings. Krishna will  then attack him and at Earth's own behest, will kill Naraka and take to  Dwarka all the imprisoned girls. Earth says, 'Why should I ever tell  anyone to kill my own son?' and is silent. None the less the boon is  granted, the conditions are in due course fulfilled and after a furious  encounter with Naraka at his city of Pragjyotisha,[38] Krishna is once  again victorious. During the battle, Muru or Mura, the arch demon, aided  by seven sons, strenuously defends the city. Krishna kills him by cutting  off his five heads but has then to resist whole armies of demons assembled  by the sons. When these also have been destroyed, Krishna meets Naraka and  after a vicious contest finally kills him, recovering in consequence the  earrings of Aditi and the canopy of Indra. Naraka's palace is then opened  and reveals the bevy of imprisoned girls. As they gaze on Krishna, their  reactions are reminiscent of the cowgirls'. They implore Krishna to take  them away and allow them to lavish on him their impassioned love. Krishna  agrees, chariots are sent for and the vast concourse of passion-stricken  girls is transported to Dwarka. Here Krishna marries them, showering  affection on each of the sixteen thousand and one hundred 'and displaying  unceasing love for his eight queens.'    Such an incident revives an aspect of Krishna's early character which up  to the present has been somewhat obscured by other events. Besides slaying  demons he has all along been sensitive to feminine needs, arousing in  women passionate adoration and at the same time fulfilling the most  intense of their physical desires. It is these qualities which  characterize his later career.    Having on one occasion given Rukmini, his first consort, a flower of the  heavenly wishing tree,[39] Krishna finds that he has aroused the jealousy  of his third consort, Satyabhama. To please her, he accordingly undertakes  to get for her not merely a flower or branch but the tree itself. He  therefore goes to Vaikuntha, the paradise of Vishnu, and takes the  opportunity to return the earrings of Aditi and place the canopy over the  lord of the gods. He then sends a message to Indra asking for the tree.  Indra as the tree's custodian recalls his former discomfiture in Brindaban  when Krishna had abolished his worship and venerated the hill Govardhana  in his place. Despite his subsequent surrender to Krishna, and abject  worship of him, Indra is still incensed and bluntly refuses. Krishna then  goes to the tree, wounds its guardians and bears the tree away. Indra is  tempted to do battle but realizing Krishna's superior power calls off his  hosts. Back in Dwarka, Krishna instals the tree in Satyabhama's palace but  returns it to Indra a year later.    On another occasion, Krishna and Rukmini are making love on a golden bed  in a palace bedecked with gems. The sheets are white as foam and are  decorated with flowers. Pictures have been painted on the walls and every  aid to pleasure has been provided. Rukmini is lovelier than ever, while  Krishna, 'the root of joy,' dazzles her with a face lovely as the moon, a  skin the colour of clouds, a peacock crown, a long garland of flowers and  a scarf of yellow silk. As he lies, he is 'the sea of beauty, the light of  the three worlds.' After making love, Krishna suddenly asks Rukmini why  she preferred him to Sisupala. He points out that he is not a king and is  therefore quite unworthy of her, that since he has rescued her from  Sisupala, her wish has been accomplished and it is best that she should  now leave him and marry a prince of the royal blood who will be worthy of  her name. Rukmini is stunned at the suggestion. She collapses on the  floor, her hair obscuring her lovely face. Krishna raises her up, sits her  on his knees, and strokes her cheeks. When at length Rukmini revives,  Krishna hastens to explain that he was only jesting and that in view of  her deep love he will never abandon her. Rukmini assures him that nowhere  in the world is there Krishna's equal. The beggars who recited his praises  and from whom she first heard his name, were in fact Brahma and Siva. All  the gods revere him. To adore him is the only joy. Those who love Krishna  alone are happy. If blinded by pride a man forgets him, Krishna abases  him. It was because Rukmini besought his compassion that Krishna has loved  her. Hearing her simple sincerity, Krishna is greatly moved and says,  'Love of my heart, you know me through and through. You have given  yourself to me, adored me and known my love. I shall love you always.'  Rukmini hears him with deep contentment and the two make love.    Such a declaration however is not intended to imply a cold neglect of his  other wives for it is part of Krishna's role that he should please and  satisfy all. Accordingly, when Narada, the sage, makes one of his  recurring appearances--this time in order to investigate how Krishna  contrives to keep happy so vast a concourse of women--he finds Krishna  everywhere. With Rukmini he reclines at ease, with Jambhavati he plays  dice, at Satyabhama's house, he is having his body rubbed with oil, at  Kalindi's, he is asleep. In this way, wherever Narada goes, he finds  Krishna with one or other of his queens. In fact, the same 'delusive'  powers which he had earlier employed when dancing with the  cowgirls--making each believe he was dancing with her and her alone--are  now being used to satisfy his wives.    In this way Krishna continues to live. Sometimes his wives caress his  body, ply him with delicacies or swathe him in perfumed garments.  Sometimes to ease their passion they make little figures of him or let  themselves be dressed by him. One night they go with him to a tank and  there make love in the water. Everything in the scene reminds them of  their love and they address first a _chakai_ bird. 'O _chakai_ bird, when  you are parted from your mate, you spend the whole night sadly calling and  never sleeping. Speak to us of your beloved. We are Krishna's  slave-girls.' They speak to the sea. 'O sea, you lie awake night and day,  heaving sighs. Do you grieve for a loved one who is far away?' Then they  see the moon. 'O moon, why do you grow thin? Are you also filled with  longing? Are you fascinated by Krishna?' In this way they address birds,  hills and rivers, seeking from each some consolation for their frenzied  love.    In due course, each of the sixteen thousand one hundred and eight bears  Krishna ten sons and one daughter and each is beautiful as himself.    [Footnote 36: Plate 18.]    [Footnote 37: Lanka--modern Ceylon.]    [Footnote 38: Note 12.]    [Footnote 39: A sight of the heavenly wishing-tree, the _kalpa_ or  _parijata_, which grew in Indra's heaven, was believed to make the old  young.]        (iii) Last Phases      This gradual expansion of his marital state takes Krishna even farther  from the adoring loves of his youth, the cowgirls of Brindaban. Indeed for  months on end it is as if he has dismissed them from his mind. One day he  and Balarama are sitting together when Balarama reminds him of their  promise that after staying for a time in Mathura they will assuredly visit  them. Krishna, it is clear, cannot go himself, but Balarama is less  impeded and with Krishna's approval, he takes a ploughshare and pestle,  mounts a chariot and speeds on his way.    As he nears Brindaban, the familiar scenes greet him. The cowherds and  cowgirls come into view, but instead of joy there is general despair. The  cows low and pant, rejecting the grass. The cowherds are still discussing  Krishna's deeds and the cowgirls cannot expel him from their minds. As  Balarama enters their house, Nanda and Yasoda weep with joy. Balarama is  plied with questions about Krishna's welfare and when he answers that all  is well, Yasoda describes the darkness that has descended on them since  the joy of their hearts left. Balarama now meets the cowgirls. Their hair  is disordered, they are no longer neat and smart. Their minds are not in  their work and despite Krishna's absence, they are filled with passionate  longings and frenzied desires. Some of them marvel at Krishna's love and  count it good even to have known him. Others bitterly upbraid Krishna for  deserting them. Balarama explains that his visit is to show them that  Krishna has not entirely forgotten them and as proof he offers to re-enact  the circular dance and himself engage with them as lover.    In this way the circular dance is once again performed. The full moon  pours down, the cowgirls deck themselves and songs rise in the air. Flutes  and drums play and in the midst of the throng Balarama sings and dances,  clasping the cowgirls to him, making love and rousing them to ecstasy.  Night after night the dance is performed, while each day Balarama comforts  Nanda and Yasoda with news of Krishna. One night as his visit is ending,  he feels exhausted and commands the river Jumna to change its course and  bathe him with its water. The Jumna fails to comply, so Balarama draws the  river towards him with his plough and bathes in its stream. From that time  on, the Jumna's course is changed. His exhaustion now leaves him and he  gratifies the cowgirls with fresh passion. With this incident his visit  ends. He bids farewell to Nanda, Yasoda and the cowgirls and leaving the  forest returns to Dwarka.    Krishna's relations with the cowgirls are now completely ended, but on one  last occasion he happens to meet them. News has come that the sun will  soon be eclipsed and accordingly, Krishna and Balarama take the Yadavas on  pilgrimage. They choose a certain holy place, Kurukshetra, and assembling  all their queens and wives, make the slow journey to it. When they  arrive, a festival is in progress. They bathe and make offerings. While  they are still encamped, other kings come "]]]
