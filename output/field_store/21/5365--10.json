Person Interviewed: James Baker         Aged: 81  Home: With daughter who owns home at 941 Wade St.      The outskirts of eastern Hot Springs resemble a vast  checkerboard--patterned in Black and White. Within two blocks of a house  made of log-faced siding--painted a spotless white and provided with  blue shutters will be a shack which appears to have been made from the  discard of a dozen generations of houses.    Some of the yards are thick with rusting cans, old tires and  miscelaneous rubbish. Some of them are so gutted by gully wash that any  attempt at beautification would be worse than useless. Some are  swept--farm fashion--free from surface dust and twigs. Some  attempt--others achieve grass and flowers. Vegetable gardens are far  less frequent then they should be, considering space left bare.    The interviewer frankly lost her way several times. One improper  direction took her fully half a mile beyond her destination. From a  hilltop she could look down on less elevated hills and into narrow  valleys. The impression was that of a cheaply painted back-drop designed  for a \"stock\" presentation of \"Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch.\"    Moving along streets, alleys and paths backward \"toward town\" the  interviewer reached another hill. Almost a quarter of a mile away she  spied an old colored man sunning himself on the front porch of a well  kept cottage. Somthing about his white hair and erectly-slumped bearing  screamed \"Ex-slave\" even at that distance. A negro youth was passing.    \"I beg your pardon, can you tell me where to find Wade Street and James  Baker?\" \"Ya--ya--ya--s ma'am. Dat--dat--dat's de house over  da--da--da--da--r. He--he--he lives at his daughter's\" \"Could that be he  on the porch?\" \"Ya--ya--yas ma'am. Dat--dat--dat's right.\"    \"Yes, ma'am I'm James Baker. Yes ma'am I remembers about the war. You  want to talk to me about it. Let me get you a chair. You'd rather sit  right there on the step? All right ma'am.    I was born in Hot Spring county, below Melvern it was. I was borned on  the farm of a man named Hammonds. But I was pretty little when he sold  me to some folks named Fenton. Wasn't with them so very long. You know  how it goes--back in them days. When a girl or a boy would marry, why  they'd givem them as many black folks as they could spare. I was give to  one of the daughters when she married. She was Mrs. Samuel Gentry.    I wasn't so very big before the war. So I didn't have to work in the  fields. Just sort of played around. Can't remember very much about what  happened then. We never did see no fighting about. They was men what  passed through. They was soldiers. They come backwards and forewards. I  was about as big as that boy you see there\"--pointing to a lad about 8  years old--\"some of them they was dressed in blue--sort of blue. We was  told that they was Federals. Then some of them was in grey--them was the  Southerners.    No, we wasn't scared of them--either of them. They didn't never bother  none of us. Didn't have anything to be scared of not at all. It wasn't  really Malvern we was at--that was sort of before Malvern come to be.  Malvern didn't grow up until after the railroad come through. The town  was across the river, sort of this side. It was called Rockport.  Ma'am--you know about Rockport\"--a delighted chuckle. \"Yes, ma'am, don't  many folks now-a-days know about Rockport. Yes ma'am the river is pretty  shoaly right there. Pretty shoaly. Yes ma'am there was lots of doings  around Rockport. Yes ma'am. Dat's right. Before Garland county was made,  Rockport was the capitol O--I mean de county seat of Hot Spring County.  Hot Springs was in that county at that time. There was big doings in  town when they held court. Real big doings.    No, ma'am I didn't do nothing much when the war was over. No, I didn't  go to be with my daddy. I moved over to live with a man I called Uncle  Billy--Uncle Billy Bryant he was. He had all his family with him. I  stayed with him and did what he told me to--'til I grew up. He was  always good to me--treated me like his own children.    Uncle Billy lived at Rockport. I liked living with him. I remember the  court house burned down--or blowed down--seems like to me it burned  down. Uncle Billy got the job of cleaning bricks. I helped him. That was  when they moved over to Malvern--the court house I mean. No--no they  didn't. Not then, that was later--they didn't build the railroad until  later. They built it back--sort of simple like--built it down by Judge  Kieth's.    No ma'am. I don't remember nothing about when they built the railroad.  You see we lived across the river--and I guess--well I just didn't know  nothing about it. But Rockport wasn't no good after the railroad come  in. They moved the court house and most of the folks moved away. There  wasn't nothing much left.    I started farming around there some. I moved about quite a bit. I lived  down sort of by Benton too for quite a spell. I worked around at most  any kind of farming.    'Course most of the time we was working at cotton and corn. I's spent  most of my life farming. I like it. Moved around pretty considerable.  Sometimes I hired out--sometimes I share cropped--sometimes I worked  thirds and fourths. What does I mean by hired out--I means worked for  wages. Which way did I like best--I'll take share-cropping. I sort of  like share-cropping.    I been in Hot Springs for 7 years. Come to be with my daughter.\" (An  interruption by a small negro girl--neatly dressed and bright-eyed. Not  content with watching from the sidelines she had edged closer and  squatted comfortably within a couple of feet of the interviewer. A wide,  pearly grin, a wee pointing forefinger and, \"Granddaddy, that lady's got  a tablet just like Aunt Ellen. See, Granddaddy.\") \"You mustm't bother  the lady. Didn't your mother tell you not to stop folks when they is  talking.\"--the voice was kindly and there was paternal pride in it. A  nickle--tendered the youngster by the interviewer--and guaranteed to  produce a similar tablet won a smile and childish silence.    \"Yes, ma'am, I lives with my daughter--her name is Lulu Mitchell. She  owns her house--yes ma'am it helps. But it's sure hard to get along.  Seems like it's lots harder now than it used to be when I was gitting  started. Lulu works--she irons. Another daughter lives right over there.  Her name's Ellen. She works too--at what she can get to do. She owns her  house too.    Three of my daughters is living. Been married twice--I has. Didn't stay  with the last one long. Yes ma'am I been coming backwards and forewards  to Hot Springs all my life--you might say. 'Twasn't far over and I kept  a'coming back. Been living all around here. It's pretty nice being with  my daughter. She's good to me. I loves my granddaughter. We has a pretty  hard time--Harder dan what I had when I was young--but then it do seem  like it's harder to earn money dan what it was when I was young.\"          Interviewer: R.S.

Throughout this book we have had to refer frequently to the \"gods\" of  Egypt; it is now time to explain who and what they were. We have already  shown how much the monotheistic side of the Egyptian religion resembles  that of modern Christian nations, and it will have come as a surprise to  some that a people, possessing such exalted ideas of God as the  Egyptians, could ever have become the byword they did through their  alleged worship of a multitude of \"gods\" in various forms. It is quite  true that the Egyptians paid honour to a number of gods, a number so  large that the list of their mere names would fill a volume, but it is  equally true that the educated classes in Egypt at all times never  placed the \"gods\" on the same high level as God, and they never imagined  that their views on this point could be mistaken. In prehistoric times  every little village or town, every district and province, and every  great city, had its own particular god; we may go a step farther, and  say that every family of any wealth and position had its own god. The  wealthy family selected some one to attend to its god, and to minister  unto his wants, and the poor family contributed, according to its means,  towards a common fund for providing a dwelling-house for the god, and  for vestments, etc. But the god was an integral part of the family,  whether rich or poor, and its destiny was practically locked up with  that of the family. The overthrow of the family included the overthrow  of the god, and seasons of prosperity resulted in abundant offerings,  new vestments; perhaps a new shrine, and the like. The god of the  village, although he was a more important being, might be led into  captivity along with the people of the village, but the victory of his  followers in a raid or fight caused the honours paid to him to be  magnified and enhanced his renown.    The gods of provinces or of great cities were, of course, greater than  those of villages and private families, and in the large houses  dedicated to them, _i.e._, temples, a considerable number of them,  represented by statues, would be found. Sometimes the attributes of one  god would be ascribed to another, sometimes two or more gods would be  \"fused\" or united and form one, sometimes gods were imported from remote  villages and towns and even from foreign countries, and occasionally a  community or town would repudiate its god or gods, and adopt a brand new  set from some neighbouring district Thus the number of the gods was  always changing, and the relative position of individual gods was always  changing; an obscure and almost unknown, local god to-day might through a  victory in war become the chief god of a city, and on the other hand, a  god worshipped with abundant offerings and great ceremony one month  might sink into insignificance and become to all intents and purposes a  dead god the next. But besides family and village gods there were  national gods, and gods of rivers and mountains, and gods of earth and  sky, all of which taken together made a formidable number of \"divine\"  beings whose good-will had to be secured, and whose ill-will must be  appeased. Besides these, a number of animals as being sacred to the gods  were also considered to be \"divine,\" and fear as well as love made the  Egyptians add to their numerous classes of gods.    The gods of Egypt whose names are known to us do not represent all those  that have been conceived by the Egyptian imagination, for with them as  with much else, the law of the survival of the fittest holds good. Of  the gods of the prehistoric man we know nothing, but it is more than  probable that some of the gods who were worshipped in dynastic times  represent, in a modified form, the deities of the savage, or  semi-savage, Egyptian that held their influence on his mind the longest.  A typical example of such a god will suffice, namely Thoth, whose  original emblem was the dog-headed ape. In very early times great  respect was paid to this animal on account of his sagacity,  intelligence, and cunning; and the simple-minded Egyptian, when he heard  him chattering just before the sunrise and sunset, assumed that he was  in some way holding converse or was intimately connected with the sun.  This idea clung to his mind, and we find in dynastic times, in the  vignette representing the rising sun, that the apes, who are said to be  the transformed openers of the portals of heaven, form a veritable  company of the gods, and at the same time one of the most striking  features of the scene. Thus an idea which came into being in the most  remote times passed on from generation to generation until it became  crystallized in the best copies of the Book of the Dead, at a period  when Egypt was at its zenith of power and glory. The peculiar species of  the dog-headed ape which is represented in statues and on papyri is  famous for its cunning, and it was the words which it supplied to Thoth,  who in turn transmitted them to Osiris, that enabled Osiris to be \"true  of voice,\" or triumphant, over his enemies. It is probably in this  capacity, _i.e._, as the friend of the dead, that the dog-headed ape  appears seated upon the top of the standard of the Balance in which the  heart of the deceased is being weighed against the feather symbolic of  Ma[=a]t; for the commonest titles of the god are \"lord of divine books,\"  \"lord of divine words,\" _i.e._, the formulae which make the deceased to  be obeyed by friend and foe alike in the next world. In later times,  when Thoth came to be represented by the ibis bird, his attributes were  multiplied, and he became the god of letters, science, mathematics,  etc.; at the creation he seems to have played a part not unlike that of  \"wisdom\" which is so beautifully described by the writer of Proverbs  (see Chap. VIII. vv. 23-31).    Whenever and wherever the Egyptians attempted to set up a system of gods  they always found that the old local gods had to be taken into  consideration, and a place had to be found for them in the system. This  might be done by making them members of triads, or of groups of nine  gods, now commonly called \"enneads\"; but in one form or other they had  to appear. The researches made during the last few years have shown that  there must have been several large schools of theological thought in  Egypt, and of each of these the priests did their utmost to proclaim the  superiority of their gods. In dynastic times there must have been great  colleges at Heliopolis, Memphis, Abydos, and one or more places in the  Delta, not to mention the smaller schools of priests which, probably  existed at places on both sides of the Nile from Memphis to the south.  Of the theories and doctrines of all such schools and colleges, those of  Heliopolis have survived in the completest form, and by careful  examination of the funeral texts which were inscribed on the monuments  of the kings of Egypt of the Vth and VIth dynasties we can say what  views they held about many of the gods. At the outset we see that the  great god of Heliopolis was Temu or Atmu, the setting sun, and to him  the priests of that place ascribed the attributes which rightly belong  to R[=a], the Sun-god of the day-time. For some reason or other they  formulated the idea of a company of the gods, nine in number, which was  called the \"great company _(paut)_ of the gods,\" and at the head of this  company they placed the god Temu. In Chapter XVII of the Book of the  Dead [Footnote: See _Chapters of Coming Forth by Day_, p. 49.] we find  the following passage:--      \"I am the god Temu in his rising; I am the only One. I came into being    in Nu. I am R[=a] who rose in the beginning.\"    Next comes the question, \"But who is this?\" And the answer is: \"It is  R[=a] when at the beginning he rose in the city of Suten-henen  (Heracleopolis Magna) crowned like a king in rising. The pillars of the  god Shu were not as yet created when he was upon the staircase of him  that dwelleth in Khemennu (Hermopolis Magna).\" From these statements we  learn that Temu and R[=a] were one and the same god, and that he was the  first offspring of the god Nu, the primeval watery mass out of which all  the gods came into being. The text continues: \"I am the great god Nu who  gave birth to himself, and who made his names to come into being and to  form the company of the gods. But who is this? It is R[=a], the creator  of the names of his members which came into being in the form of the  gods who are in the "]]]
