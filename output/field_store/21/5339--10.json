He was  a lawyer, a historian, and a poet; he received his education at the  university of Oxford, but of what college he was Wood himself has not  been able to discover; he removed from thence to Lincolns'-Inn, where,  by a diligent application to the law, he made considerable progress in  his profession, and by the patronage of that great minister Cromwell  Earl of Essex, who was himself a man of astonishing abilities, he soon  made a figure at the bar. He was the menial servant of King Henry  VIII.[2] and discharged his trust both in time of war and peace with  great honour and gallantry, and shared that monarch's favour in a very  considerable degree, who made him a grant in his own country, as an  evidence of his affection for him. This grant of the King's happened  in the year 1535; and yet in seven years afterwards, either thro' want  of economy, or by a boundless confidence in his friends, he reduced  his affairs to a very indifferent situation, which, perhaps, might  be the reason, why he procured himself to be chosen Member for the  Borough of Plymouth in the county of Devon,[3] in the Parliament  summoned the thirty-third year of that King's reign. During the  Sessions he had the misfortune to be arrested by an officer belonging  to the Sheriffs of London, and carried to the counter, then in  Bread-street. No sooner had the House of Commons got notice of this  insult offered to one of their Members, than they immediately enacted  a settled rule, which from that accident took place, with respect to  privilege, and ever since that time the Members of the House have  been exempt from arrests for debt. His Majesty likewise resented  the affront offered to his servant, and with the concurrence of the  Parliament proceeded very severely against the Sheriffs.    Hollinshed in his chronicle, vol 2, p. 955, gives a very full account  of it. Sir Thomas Moils, knight, then Speaker of the House, gave a  special order to the Serjeant of the Parliament to repair to  the Compter, and there demand the delivery of the prisoner. But  notwithstanding this high authority, the officers in the city refused  to obey the command, and after many altercations, they absolutely  resisted the Serjeant, upon which a fray ensued within the  Compter-gates, between Ferrars and the officers, not without mutual  hurt, so that the Serjeant was driven to defend himself with his mace  of arms, and had the crown of it broken with warding off a stroke; the  Sheriffs of London so far from appeasing, fomented the quarrel, and  with insolent language refused to deliver their prisoner: Upon which  the Serjeant, thus abused, returned to the House and related what had  happened. This circumstance so exasperated the Burgesses, that they  all rose and went into the Upper House, and declared they would  transact no more business till their Member was restored to them. They  then commanded their Serjeant again to go to the Compter with his  mace, and make a second demand by their authority.--The Sheriffs  hearing that the Upper House hid concerned themselves in it, and being  afraid of their resentment, restored the prisoner before the Serjeant  had time to return to the Compter; but this did not satisfy the  Burgesses, they summoned the Sheriffs before them, together with one  White, who in contempt of their dignity had taken out a writ against  Ferrars, and as a punishment for their insolence, they were sent to  the Tower; and ever since that period, the power and privilege of the  Commons have been on the increase.    Ferrars continued in high favour with Henry during the remainder of  his reign, and seems to have stood upon good terms with Somerset Lord  Protector in the beginning of Edward VI. since it appears that he  attended the Protector in quality of one of the Commissioners of the  Army, in his expedition into Scotland in 1548,[4] which, perhaps,  might be owing to his being about the person of Prince Edward in his  father's life-time. Another instance of this happened about four years  afterwards, at a very critical juncture, for when the unfortunate Duke  of Somerset lay under sentence of death, and it was observed that the  people murmured and often gave testimonies of discontent, and that the  King himself was very uneasy, those about him studied every method  to quiet and amuse the one, to entertain and divert the other[5]. In  order to this, at the entrance of Christmas holidays, Mr. Ferrars  was proclaimed Lord Misrule, that is a kind of Prince of sports and  pastimes, which office he discharged for twelve days together at  Greenwich with great magnificence and address, and entirely to the  King's satisfaction.    In this character, attended by the politest part of the Court, he made  an excursion to London, where he was splendidly entertained by the  Lord Mayor, and when he took his leave he had presents given him in  token of respect. But notwithstanding he made so great figure in  the diversions at court, yet he was no idle spectator of political  affairs, and maintained his reputation with the learned world. He  wrote the reign of Queen Mary, which tho' published in the name of  Richard Grafton, in his chronicles; yet was certainly the performance  of Ferrars, according to the annals of Stow, p. 632, whose authority  in this case is very high. Our author was an historian, a lawyer, and  a politician even in his poetry, as appears from these pieces of his  which are inserted in the Mirror of Magistrates, and which are not  inferior to any others that have found a place there[6]. In the early  part of his life he wrote some tracts on his own profession, which  gained him great reputation, and which discover that he was a lover  of liberty, and not disposed to sacrifice to the crown the rights and  properties of the subject. It seldom happens that when a man often  changes his situation, or is forced to do so, that he continues  to preserve the good opinion of different parties, but this was a  happiness which Ferrars enjoyed. He was consulted by the learned as a  candid critic, admired and loved by all who conversed with him.    With respect to the time of our author's death, we cannot be  absolutely certain; all we know is, that he died in the year 1579, at  his house in Flamstead in Hertfordshire, and was buried in the parish  church; for as Wood informs us, on the eighteenth of May the same  year a commission was granted from the prerogative, to administer the  goods, debts, chattles, etc. of George Ferrars lately deceased[7].  None of our authors deliver any thing as to Mr. Ferrars's religion,  but it is highly probable that he was a zealous Protestant: not from  his accepting grants of Abbey-lands, for that is but a precarious  proof, but from his coming into the world under the protection of  Thomas Lord Cromwell, who was certainly persuaded of the truth of the  protestant religion.    Having this occasion to mention Thomas Lord Cromwell, the famous Earl  of Essex, who was our author's warmest patron, I am persuaded my  readers will forgive me a digression which will open to them the  noblest instance of gratitude and honour in that worthy nobleman, that  ever adorned the page of an historian, and which has been told with  rapture by all who have writ of the times, particularly by Dr. Burnet  in his history of the Reformation, and Fox in his Martyrology.--Thomas  Lord Cromwell was the son of a Blacksmith at Putney, and was a soldier  under the duke of Bourbon at the sacking of Rome in the year 1527.  While he was abroad in a military character, in a very low station, he  fell sick, and was unable to follow the army; he was observed one  day by an Italian merchant to walk very pensive, and had all the  appearance of penury and wretchedness: The merchant enquired of  him the place of his birth, and fortune, and upon conversing with  Cromwell, was so well pleased with the account he gave of himself,  that he supplied him with money and credit to carry him to England.  Cromwell afterwards made the most rapid progress in state-preferments  ever known. Honours were multiplied thick upon him, and he came to  have the dispensing of his sovereign's bounty. It happened, that this  Italian merchant's circumstances decayed, and he came to England to  sollicit the payment of some debts due to him by his correspondents;  who finding him necessitous, were disposed to put him off, and take  the advantage of his want, to avoid payment. This not a little  embarrassed the foreigner, who was now in a situation forlorn enough.  As providence would have it, lord Cromwell, then Earl of Essex, riding  to court, saw this merchant walking with a dejected countenance, which  put him in mind of his former situation. He immediately ordered one  of his attendants to desire the merchant to come to his house. His  lordship asked the merchant whether he knew him? he answered no:  Cromwell then related the circumstance of the merchant's relieving  a certain Englishman; and asked if he remembered it? The merchant  answered, that he had always made it his business to do good, but did  not remember that circumstance.--His lordship then enquired the reason  of his coming to England, and upon the merchant's telling him his  story, he so interested himself, as soon to procure the payment of all  his debts.--Cromwell then informed the merchant, that he was himself  the person he had thus relieved; and for every Ducat which the  merchant had given him, he returned to the value of a hundred, telling  him, that this was the payment of his debt. He then made him a  munificent present, and asked him whether he chose to settle in  England, or return to his own country. The foreigner chose the latter,  and returned to spend the remainder of his days in competence and  quiet, after having experienced in lord Essex as high an instance of  generosity and gratitude as perhaps ever was known. This noble act of  his lordship, employed, says Burnet, the pens of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106"],[0,"Jungle Tales of Tarzan (#13)"],[1,"of the tree which overhung the palisade and  disappeared from the sight of the villagers.    All the way back to the stamping ground of the apes, Tarzan sought for  an explanation of the strange power which had stayed his hand and  prevented him from slaying Mbonga.  It was as though someone greater  than he had commanded him to spare the life of the old man.  Tarzan  could not understand, for he could conceive of nothing, or no one, with  the authority to dictate to him what he should do, or what he should  refrain from doing.    It was late when Tarzan sought a swaying couch among the trees beneath  which slept the apes of Kerchak, and he was still absorbed in the  solution of his strange problem when he fell asleep.    The sun was well up in the heavens when he awoke.  The apes were astir  in search of food.  Tarzan watched them lazily from above as they  scratched in the rotting loam for bugs and beetles and grubworms, or  sought among the branches of the trees for eggs and young birds, or  luscious caterpillars.    An orchid, dangling close beside his head, opened slowly, unfolding its  delicate petals to the warmth and light of the sun which but recently  had penetrated to its shady retreat.  A thousand times had Tarzan of  the Apes witnessed the beauteous miracle; but now it aroused a keener  interest, for the ape-man was just commencing to ask himself questions  about all the myriad wonders which heretofore he had but taken for  granted.    What made the flower open? What made it grow from a tiny bud to a  full-blown bloom? Why was it at all? Why was he?  Where did Numa, the  lion, come from? Who planted the first tree? How did Goro get way up  into the darkness of the night sky to cast his welcome light upon the  fearsome nocturnal jungle? And the sun! Did the sun merely happen there?    Why were all the peoples of the jungle not trees? Why were the trees  not something else? Why was Tarzan different from Taug, and Taug  different from Bara, the deer, and Bara different from Sheeta, the  panther, and why was not Sheeta like Buto, the rhinoceros? Where and  how, anyway, did they all come from--the trees, the flowers, the  insects, the countless creatures of the jungle?    Quite unexpectedly an idea popped into Tarzan's head.  In following out  the many ramifications of the dictionary definition of GOD he had come  upon the word CREATE--\"to cause to come into existence; to form out of  nothing.\"    Tarzan almost had arrived at something tangible when a distant wail  startled him from his preoccupation into sensibility of the present and  the real.  The wail came from the jungle at some little distance from  Tarzan's swaying couch.  It was the wail of a tiny balu.  Tarzan  recognized it at once as the voice of Gazan, Teeka's baby.  They had  called it Gazan because its soft, baby hair had been unusually red, and  GAZAN in the language of the great apes, means red skin.    The wail was immediately followed by a real scream of terror from the  small lungs.  Tarzan was electrified into instant action.  Like an  arrow from a bow he shot through the trees in the direction of the  sound.  Ahead of him he heard the savage snarling of an adult she-ape.  It was Teeka to the rescue.  The danger must be very real.  Tarzan  could tell that by the note of rage mingled with fear in the voice of  the she.    Running along bending limbs, swinging from one tree to another, the  ape-man raced through the middle terraces toward the sounds which now  had risen in volume to deafening proportions.  From all directions the  apes of Kerchak were hurrying in response to the appeal in the tones of  the balu and its mother, and as they came, their roars reverberated  through the forest.    But Tarzan, swifter than his heavy fellows, distanced them all.  It was  he who was first upon the scene.  What he saw sent a cold chill through  his giant frame, for the enemy was the most hated and loathed of all  the jungle creatures.    Twined in a great tree was Histah, the snake--huge, ponderous,  slimy--and in the folds of its deadly embrace was Teeka's little balu,  Gazan.  Nothing in the jungle inspired within the breast of Tarzan so  near a semblance to fear as did the hideous Histah.  The apes, too,  loathed the terrifying reptile and feared him even more than they did  Sheeta, the panther, or Numa, the lion.  Of all their enemies there was  none they gave a wider berth than they gave Histah, the snake.    Tarzan knew that Teeka was peculiarly fearful of this silent, repulsive  foe, and as the scene broke upon his vision, it was the action of Teeka  which filled him with the greatest wonder, for at the moment that he  saw her, the she-ape leaped upon the glistening body of the snake, and  as the mighty folds encircled her as well as her offspring, she made no  effort to escape, but instead grasped the writhing body in a futile  effort to tear it from her screaming balu.    Tarzan knew all too well how deep-rooted was Teeka's terror of Histah.  He scarce could believe the testimony of his own eyes then, when they  told him that she had voluntarily rushed into that deadly embrace.  Nor  was Teeka's innate dread of the monster much greater than Tarzan's own.  Never, willingly, had he touched a snake.  Why, he could not say, for  he would admit fear of nothing; nor was it fear, but rather an inherent  repulsion bequeathed to him by many generations of civilized ancestors,  and back of them, perhaps, by countless myriads of such as Teeka, in  the breasts of each of which had lurked the same nameless terror of the  slimy reptile.    Yet Tarzan did not hesitate more than had Teeka, but leaped upon Histah  with all the speed and impetuosity that he would have shown had he been  springing upon Bara, the deer, to make a kill for food.  Thus beset the  snake writhed and twisted horribly; but not for an instant did it loose  its hold upon any of its intended victims, for it had included the  ape-man in its cold embrace the minute that he had fallen upon it.    Still clinging to the tree, the mighty reptile held the three as though  they had been without weight, the while it sought to crush the life  from them.  Tarzan had drawn his knife and this he now plunged rapidly  into the body of the enemy; but the encircling folds promised to sap  his life before he had inflicted a death wound upon the snake.  Yet on  he fought, nor once did he seek to escape the horrid death that  confronted him--his sole aim was to slay Histah and thus free Teeka and  her balu.    The great, wide-gaping jaws of the snake turned and hovered above him.  The elastic maw, which could accommodate a rabbit or a horned buck with  equal facility, yawned for him; but Histah, in turning his attention  upon the ape-man, brought his head within reach of Tarzan's blade.  Instantly a brown hand leaped forth and seized the mottled neck, and  another drove the heavy hunting knife to the hilt into the little brain.    Convulsively Histah shuddered and relaxed, tensed and relaxed again,  whipping and striking with his great body; but no longer sentient or  sensible.  Histah was dead, but in his death throes he might easily  dispatch a dozen apes or men.    Quickly Tarzan seized Teeka and dragged her from the loosened embrace,  dropping her to the ground beneath, then he extricated the balu and  tossed it to its mother.  Still Histah whipped about, clinging to the  ape-man; but after a dozen efforts Tarzan succeeded in wriggling free  and leaping to the ground out of range of the mighty battering of the  dying snake.    A circle of apes surrounded the scene of the battle; but the moment  that Tarzan broke safely from the enemy they turned silently away to  resume their interrupted feeding, and Teeka turned with them,  apparently forgetful of all but her balu and the fact that when the  interruption had occurred she just had discovered an ingeniously hidden  nest containing three perfectly good eggs.    Tarzan, equally indifferent to a battle that was over, merely cast a  parting glance at the still writhing body of Histah and wandered off  toward the little pool which served to water the tribe at this point.  Strangely, he did not give the victory cry over the vanquished Histah.  Why, he could not have told you, other than that to him Histah was not  an animal.  He differed in some peculiar way from the other denizens of  the jungle.  Tarzan only knew that he hated him.    At the pool Tarzan drank his fill and lay stretched upon the soft grass  beneath the shade of a tree.  His mind reverted to the battle with  Histah, the snake.  It seemed strange to him that Teeka should have  placed herself within the folds of the horrid monster.  Why had she  done it? Why, indeed, had he? Teeka did not belong to him, nor did  Teeka's balu.  They were both Taug's. Why then had he done this thing?  Histah was not food for him when he was dead.  There seemed to Tarzan,  now that he gave the matter thought, no reason in the world why he  should have done the thing he did, and presently it occurred to him  that he had acted almost involuntarily, just as he had acted when he  had released the old Gomangani the previous evening.    What made him do such things? Somebody more powerful than he must force  him to act at times.  \"All-powerful,\" thought Tarzan.  \"The little bugs  say that God is all-powerful. It must be that God made me do these  things, for I never did them by myself.  It was God who made Teeka rush  upon Histah.  Teeka would never go near Histah of her own volition.  It  was God who held my knife from the throat of the old Gomangani.  God  accomplishes strange things for he is 'all-powerful.' I cannot see Him;  but I know that it must be God who does these things.  No Mangani, no  Gomangani, no Tarmangani could do them.\"    And the flowers--who made them grow? Ah, now it was all explained--the  flowers, the trees, the moon, the sun, himself, every living creature  in the jungle--they were"]]]
