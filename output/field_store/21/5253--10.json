As she appeared  brighter or darker, they exulted or lamented; but when gathering clouds  had utterly bereft them of her sight, and they believed her now buried  in everlasting darkness; then, as minds once thoroughly dismayed are  pliant to superstition, they bewailed \"their own eternal sufferings  thus portended, and that against their misdeeds the angry Deities  were contending.\" Drusus, who thought it behoved him to improve this  disposition of theirs, and to reap the fruits of wisdom from the  operations of chance; ordered certain persons to go round, and apply  to them from tent to tent. For this purpose, he called and employed  the Centurion Julius Clemens, and whoever else were by honest methods  acceptable to the multitude. These insinuated themselves everywhere,  with those who kept watch, or were upon patrol, or guarded the gates;  soothing all with hopes, and by terrors rousing them. \"How long,\" said  they, \"shall we hold the son of our Emperor thus besieged? Where will  our broils and wild contentions end? Shall we swear allegiance to  Percennius and Vibulenus? Will Vibulenus and Percennius support us with  pay during our service, and reward us with lands when dismissed? In  short, shall two common men dispossess the Neros and the Drusi, and to  themselves assume the Empire of the Roman People? Let us be wiser; and  as we were the last to revolt, be the first to relent. Such demands, as  comprise terms for all, are ever slowly accorded; but particulars may,  when they please, merit instant favour, and instantly receive it.\"  These reasonings alarmed them, and filled them with mutual jealousies.  Presently the fresh soldiers forsook the veterans, and one legion  separated from another; then by degrees returned the love of duty and  obedience. They relinquished the guard of the gates: and the Eagles  and other ensigns, which in the beginning of the tumult they had thrown  together, were now restored each to its distinct station.    Drusus, as soon as it was day, summoned an assembly, and though  unskilled in speaking, yet with a haughtiness inherent in his blood,  rebuked their past and commended their present behaviour. \"With threats  and terrors,\" he said, \"it was impossible to subdue him; but if he saw  them reclaimed to submission, if from them he heard the language of  supplicants, he would send to his father to accept with a reconciled  spirit the petitions of the legions,\" Hence, at their entreaty, for  their deputy to Tiberius the same Blesus was again despatched, and with  him Lucius Apronius, a Roman Knight of the cohort of Drusus; and Justus  Catonius, a Centurion of the first order. There followed great debates  in the council of Drusus, while some advised \"to suspend all proceeding  till the return of the deputies, and by a course of courtesy the while  to soothe the soldiers; others maintained, that remedies more potent  must needs be applied: in a multitude, was to be found nothing on this  side extremes; always imperious where they are not awed, and to be  without danger despised when frightened: to their present terror from  superstition was to be added the dread of their General, by his dooming  to death the authors of the sedition.\" Rather prompt to rigorous  counsels was the genius of Drusus: Vibulenus and Percennius were  produced, and by his command executed; it is by many recounted, that in  his own tent they were secretly despatched and buried; by others, that  their bodies were ignominiously thrown over the entrenchments, for a  public spectacle of terror.    Search was then made for other remarkable incendiaries. Some were caught  skulking without the camp, and there by the Centurions or Praetorian  soldiers slain; others were by their several companies delivered up, as  a proof of their own sincere faith. The consternation of the soldiers  was heightened by the precipitate accession of winter, with rains  incessant and so violent, that they were unable to stir from their  tents, or maintain common intercourse, nay, scarce to preserve their  standards, assaulted continually by tempestuous winds and raging floods.  Dread besides of the angry Gods still possessed them; nor was it at  random, they thought, that such profane traitors were thus visited  with black eclipses and roaring tempests; neither against these their  calamities was there other relief than the relinquishing of a camp by  impiety contaminated and accursed, and after expiation of their guilt  returning to their several garrisons. The eighth legion departed first;  and then the fifteenth: the ninth, with earnest clamours, pressed  for continuing there till the letters from Tiberius arrived; but when  deserted by the other two, their courage failed, and by following of  their own accord, they prevented the shame of being forced. Drusus  seeing order and tranquillity restored, without staying for the return  of the deputies, returned himself to Rome.    Almost at the same time, and from the same causes, the legions in  Germany raised an insurrection, with greater numbers, and thence with  more fury. Passionate too were their hopes that Germanicus would never  brook the rule of another, but yield to the spirit of the legions, who  had force sufficient to bring the whole Empire under his sway. Upon  the Rhine were two armies; that called the higher, commanded by Caius  Silius, Lieutenant-General; the lower, by Aulus Caecina: the command in  chief rested in Germanicus, then busy collecting the tribute in Gaul.  The forces however under Silius, with cautious ambiguity, watched the  success of the revolt which others began: for the soldiers of the lower  army had broken out into open outrages, which took its rise from the  fifth legion, and the one-and-twentieth; who after them drew the first,  and twentieth. These were altogether upon the frontiers of the Ubians,  passing the campaign in utter idleness or light duty: so that upon the  news that Augustus was dead, the whole swarm of new soldiers lately  levied in the city, men accustomed to the effeminacies of Rome, and  impatient of every military hardship, began to possess the ignorant  minds of the rest with many turbulent expectations, \"that now was  presented the lucky juncture for veterans to demand entire dismission;  the fresh soldiers, larger pay; and all, some mitigation of their  miseries; as also to return due vengeance for the cruelties of the  Centurions.\" These were not the harangues of a single incendiary, like  Percennius amongst the Pannonian legions; nor uttered, as there, in the  ears of men who, while they saw before their eyes armies greater than  their own, mutinied with awe and trembling: but here was a sedition of  many mouths, filled with many boasts, \"that in their hands lay the power  and fate of Rome; by their victories the empire was enlarged, and from  them the Caesars took, as a compliment, the surname of Germanicus.\"    Neither did Caecina strive to restrain them. A madness so extensive had  bereft him of all his bravery and firmness. In this precipitate frenzy  they rushed at once, with swords drawn, upon the Centurions, the eternal  objects of their resentment, and always the first victims to their  vengeance. Them they dragged to the earth, and upon each bestowed  a terrible portion of sixty blows; a number proportioned to that of  Centurions in a legion. Then bruised, mangled, and half expiring, as  they were, they cast them all out of the camp, some into the stream  of the Rhine. Septimius, who had for refuge fled to the tribunal of  Caecina, and lay clasping his feet, was demanded with such imperious  vehemence, that he was forced to be surrendered to destruction. Cassius  Cherea (afterwards famous to posterity for killing Caligula), then a  young man of undaunted spirit, and one of the Centurions, boldly opened  himself a passage with his sword through a crowd of armed foes striving  to seize him. After this no further authority remained to the Tribunes,  none to the Camp-Marshals. The seditious soldiers were their own  officers; set the watch, appointed the guard, and gave all orders proper  in the present exigency; hence those who dived deepest into the spirit  of the soldiery, gathered a special indication how powerful and obdurate  the present insurrection was like to prove; for in their conduct were no  marks of a rabble, where every man's will guides him, or the instigation  of a few controls the whole. Here, all at once they raged, and all at  once kept silence; with so much concert and steadiness, that you would  have believed them under the sovereign direction of one.    To Germanicus the while, then receiving, as I have said, the tribute in  Gaul, news were brought of the decease of Augustus; whose grand-daughter  Agrippina he had to wife, and by her many children: he was himself the  grandson of Livia, by her son Drusus, the brother of Tiberius; but ever  under heavy anxiety from the secret hate which his uncle and grandmother  bore him: hate the more virulent as its grounds were altogether  unrighteous; for, dear and adored was the memory of his father Drusus  amongst the Roman People, and from him was firmly expected that had he  succeeded to the Empire, he would have restored public liberty: hence  their zeal for Germanicus, and of him the same hopes conceived; as  from his youth he possessed a popular spirit, and marvellous affability  utterly remote from the comportment and address of Tiberius, ever "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7960"],[0,"Early European History (#12)"],[1,"as the builders of these mighty  structures. The most celebrated monarch of this line was the Pharaoh whom  the Greeks called Cheops. The Great Pyramid near Memphis, erected for his  tomb, remains a lasting witness to his power.    [Illustration: TWO FAMOUS PHARAOHS    Khufu (Cheops) builder of the Great Pyramid    Menephtah the supposed Pharaoh of the Exodus]    [Illustration: THE GREAT PYRAMID  The pyramid when completed had a height of 481 feet. It is now 451 feet  high. Its base covers about thirteen acres. Some of the blocks of white  limestone used in construction weigh fifty tons. The facing of polished  stone was gradually removed for building purposes by the Arabs. On the  northern side of the pyramid a narrow entrance once carefully concealed,  opens into tortuous passages which lead to the central vault. Here the  sarcophagus of the king was placed. This chamber was long since entered  and its contents rifled.]    [Illustration: THE GREAT SPHINX  This colossal figure, human headed and lion bodied, is hewn from the  natural rock. The body is about 150 feet long, the paws 50 feet, the head  30 feet. The height from the base to the top of the head is 70 feet.  Except for its head and shoulders the figure has been buried for centuries  in the desert sand. The eyes, nose and beard have been mutilated by the  Arabs. The face is probably that of one of the pyramid kings.]    AFTER THE PYRAMID KINGS    For a long time after the epoch of the pyramid kings the annals of Egypt  furnish a record of quiet and peaceful progress. The old city of Memphis  gradually declined in importance and Thebes in Upper Egypt became the  capital. The vigorous civilization growing up in Egypt was destined,  however, to suffer a sudden eclipse. About 1800 B.C. barbarous tribes from  western Asia burst into the country, through the isthmus of Suez, and  settled in the Delta. The Hyksos, as they are usually called, extended  their sway over all Egypt. At first they ruled harshly, plundering the  cities and enslaving the inhabitants, but in course of time the invaders  adopted Egyptian culture and their kings reigned like native Pharaohs. The  Hyksos are said to have introduced the horse and military chariot into  Egypt. A successful revolt at length expelled the intruders and set a new  line of Theban monarchs on the throne.    THE EGYPTIAN EMPIRE    The overthrow of the Hyksos marked a new era in the history of Egypt. From  a home-loving and peaceful people the Egyptians became a warlike race,  ambitious for glory. The Pharaohs raised powerful armies and by extensive  conquests created an Egyptian Empire, reaching from the Nile to the  Euphrates.    IMPERIAL SPLENDOR OF EGYPT    This period of the imperial greatness of Egypt is the most splendid in its  history. An extensive trade with Cyprus, Crete, and other Mediterranean  Islands introduced many foreign luxuries. The conquered territories in  Syria paid a heavy tribute of the precious metals, merchandise, and  slaves. The forced labor of thousands of war captives enabled the Pharaohs  to build public works in every part on their realm. Even the ruins of  these stupendous structures are enough to indicate the majesty and power  of ancient Egypt.    RAMESES II, ABOUT 1292-1225 B.C.    Of all the conquering Pharaohs none won more fame than Rameses II, who  ruled for nearly seventy years. His campaigns in Syria were mainly against  the Hittites, a warlike people who had moved southward from their home in  Asia Minor and sought to establish themselves in the Syrian lands. Rameses  does not appear to have been entirely successful against his foes. We find  him at length entering into an alliance with \"the great king of the  Hittites,\" by which their dominion over northern Syria was recognized. In  the arts of peace Rameses achieved a more enduring renown. He erected many  statues and temples in various parts of Egypt and made Thebes, his  capital, the most magnificent city of the age.    [Illustration: HEAD OF MUMMY OF RAMESES II (Museum of Gizeh)  The mummy was discovered in 1881 AD in an underground chamber near the  site of Thebes. With it were the coffins and bodies of more than a score  of royal personages. Rameses II was over ninety years of age at the time  of his death. In spite of the somewhat grotesque disguise of  mummification, the face of this famous Pharaoh still wears an aspect of  majesty and pride.]    DECLINE OF THE EGYPTIAN POWER    Rameses II was the last of the great Pharaohs. After his death the empire  steadily declined in strength. The Asiatic possessions fell away, never to  be recovered. By 1100 B.C. Egypt had been restricted to her former  boundaries in the Nile valley. The Persians, in the sixth century, brought  the country within their own vast empire.      10. THE PHOENICIANS AND THE HEBREWS    THE PHOENICIANS    The Phoenicians were the first Syrian people to assume importance. Their  country was a narrow stretch of coast, about one hundred and twenty miles  in length, seldom more than twelve miles in width, between the Lebanon  Mountains and the sea. This tiny land could not support a large  population. As the Phoenicians increased in numbers, they were obliged to  betake themselves to the sea. The Lebanon cedars furnished soft, white  wood for shipbuilding, and the deeply indented coast offered excellent  harbors. Thus the Phoenicians became preeminently a race of sailors. Their  great cities, Sidon and Tyre, established colonies throughout the  Mediterranean and had an extensive commerce with every region of the known  world.    THE HEBREWS    The Hebrews lived south of Phoenicia in the land of Canaan, west of the  Jordan River Their history begins with the emigration of twelve Hebrew  tribes (called Israelites) from northern Arabia to Canaan. In their new  home the Israelites gave up the life of wandering shepherds and became  farmers. They learned from the Canaanites to till the soil and to dwell in  towns and cities.    PERIOD OF THE JUDGES    The thorough conquest of Canaan proved to be no easy task. At first the  twelve Israelitish tribes formed only a loose and weak confederacy without  a common head. \"In those days there was no king in Israel, every man did  what was right in his own eyes.\" [10] The sole authority was that held by  valiant chieftains and law-givers, such as Samson, Gideon, and Samuel, who  served as judges between the tribes and often led them in successful  attacks upon their foes. Among these were the warlike Philistines, who  occupied the southwestern coast of Canaan. To resist the Philistines with  success it was necessary to have a king who could bring all the scattered  tribes under his firm, well-ordered rule.    REIGNS OF SAUL AND DAVID    In Saul, \"a young man and a goodly,\" the warriors of Israel found a leader  to unite them against their enemies. His reign was passed in constant  struggles with the Philistines. David, who followed him, utterly destroyed  the Philistine power and by further conquests extended the boundaries of  the new state. For a capital city he selected the ancient fortress of  Jerusalem. Here David built himself a royal palace and here he fixed the  Ark, the sanctuary of Jehovah. Jerusalem became to the Israelites their  dearest possession and the center of their national life.    [Illustration: Map, CANAAN as Divided among THE TRIBES]    REIGN OF SOLOMON, ABOUT 955-925 B.C.    The reign of Solomon, the son and successor of David, was the most  splendid period in Hebrew history. His kingdom stretched from the Red Sea  and the peninsula of Sinai northward to the Lebanon Mountains and the  Euphrates. With the surrounding peoples Solomon was on terms of friendship  and alliance. He married an Egyptian princess, a daughter of the reigning  Pharaoh. He joined with Hiram, king of Tyre, in trading expeditions on the  Red Sea and Indian Ocean. The same Phoenician monarch supplied him with  the \"cedars of Lebanon,\" with which he erected at Jerusalem a famous  temple for the worship of Jehovah. A great builder, a wise administrator  and governor, Solomon takes his place as a typical Oriental despot, the  most powerful monarch of the age.    [Illustration: A PHOENICIAN WAR GALLEY  From a slab found at Nineveh in the palace of the Assyrian king,  Sennacherib. The vessel shown is a bireme with two decks. On the upper  deck are soldiers with their shields hanging over the side. The oarsmen  sit on the lower deck, eight at each side. The crab catching the fish is a  humorous touch.]    SECESSION OF THE TEN TRIBES, ABOUT 925 B.C.    But the political greatness of the Hebrews was not destined to endure. The  people were not ready to bear the burdens of empire. They objected to the  standing army, to the forced labor on public buildings, and especially to  the heavy taxes. The ten northern tribes seceded shortly after Solomon's  death and established the independent kingdom of Israel, with its capital  at Samaria. The two southern tribes, Judah and Benjamin, formed the  kingdom of Judea, and remained loyal to the successors of Solomon.    [Illustration: Map, SOLOMON'S KINGDOM]    DECLINE OF THE HEBREW POWER    The two small Hebrew kingdoms could not resist their powerful neighbors.  About two centuries after the secession of the Ten Tribes, the Assyrians  overran Israel. Judea was subsequently conquered by the Babylonians. Both  countries in the end became a part of the Persian Empire.      11. THE ASSYRIANS    GREATNESS OF ASSYRIA, 745-626 B.C.    Assyria, lying east of the Tigris River, was colonized at an early date by  emigrants from Babylonia. After the Assyrians freed themselves from  Babylonian control, they entered upon a series of sweeping conquests.  Every Asiatic state felt their heavy hand. The Assyrian kings created a  huge empire stretching from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf, the  Mediterranean, and the Nile.
