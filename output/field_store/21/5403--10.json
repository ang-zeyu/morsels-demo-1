Mix in the same manner equal quantities of butter and flour, taking  care to have the flour dried for a short time before the fire; it may  be folded and rolled five or six times. This paste is well suited to  vol-au-vents and tartlets; an egg well beaten and mixed with the paste  is sometimes added.           *       *       *       *       *    PLAIN SHORT CRUST.    Put half a pound of fresh butter to a pound of flour, add the yolks of  two eggs and a little powdered sugar, mix into a paste with water, and  roll out once.           *       *       *       *       *    EGG PASTE, CALLED IN MODERN COOKERY NOUILLES.    This is formed by making a paste of flour and beaten eggs, without  either butter or water; it must be rolled out extremely thin and left  to dry; it may then be cut into narrow strips or stamped with paste  cutters. It is more fashionable in soups than vermicelli.           *       *       *       *       *    BEEF DRIPPING PASTE.    Mix half a pound of clarified dripping into one pound of flour; work  it into a paste with water, and roll out twice. This is a good paste  for a common meat pie.           *       *       *       *       *    GLAZE FOR PASTRY.    When the pastry is nearly baked, brush it over with white of egg,  cover it thickly with sifted sugar, and brown it in the oven, or it  may be browned with a salamander.    For savory pies beat the yolk of an egg, dip a paste-brush into it,  and lay it on the crust before baking.           *       *       *       *       *    FRUIT TARTS OR PIES.    A fruit tart is so common a sweet that it is scarcely necessary to  give any directions concerning it. Acid fruits are best stewed before  putting into a pie: the usual proportions are half a pound of sugar  to a quart of fruit--not quite so much if the fruit is ripe; the fruit  should be laid high in the middle of the dish, to make the pie a good  shape. It is the fashion to lay over the crust, when nearly baked,  an icing of the whites of eggs whisked with sugar; the tart or pie is  then replaced in the oven.           *       *       *       *       *    A VERY FINE SAVOURY PIE.    Lay a fine veal cutlet, cut in pieces and seasoned, at the bottom of  the dish; lay over it a layer of smoked beef fat, then a layer of fine  cold jelly made from gravy-beef and veal, then hard boiled eggs in  slices, then chicken or sweetbread, and then again the jelly, and  so on till the dish is filled; put no water, and season highly with  lemon-juice, essence of mushroom, pepper, salt, and nutmeg; also,  if approved, a blade of mace: small cakes of fine forcemeat are an  improvement; cover with a fine puff paste, and brush over with egg,  and bake.           *       *       *       *       *    TARTLETS.    Make a very rich light puff paste, and roll it out to half an inch of  thickness; it should be cut with fluted paste-cutters, lightly baked,  and the centre scooped out afterwards, and the sweetmeat or jam  inserted; a pretty dish of pastry may be made by cutting the paste in  ribbons of three inches in length, and one and a half in width; bake  them lightly, and pile them one upon another, with jam between each,  in the form of a cone.           *       *       *       *       *    CHEESECAKES.    Warm four ounces of butter, mix it with the same quantity of  loaf-sugar sifted, grate in the rind of three lemons, squeeze in  the juice of one, add three well-beaten eggs, a little nutmeg, and  a spoonful of brandy; put this mixture into small tins lined with a  light puff paste, and bake.    Cheesecakes can be varied by putting almonds beaten instead of the  lemon, or by substituting Seville oranges, and adding a few slices of  candied orange and lemon peel.           *       *       *       *       *    GIBLET PIE.    Prepare the giblets as for \"_stewed giblets_\" they should then be laid  in a deep dish, covered with a puff paste, and baked.           *       *       *       *       *    MOLINA PIE.    Mince finely cold veal or chicken, with smoked beef or tongue; season  well, add lemon-juice and a little nutmeg, let it simmer in a small  quantity of good beef or veal gravy; while on the fire, stir in the  yolks of four eggs, put it in a dish to cool, and then cover with a  rich pastry, and bake it.           *       *       *       *       *    VOL AU VENT.    This requires the greatest lightness in the pastry, as all depends  upon its rising when baked; it should be rolled out about an inch and  a half in thickness, cut it with a fluted tin of the size of the dish  in which it is to be served. Also cut a smaller piece, which must be  rolled out considerably thinner than an inch, to serve as a lid for  the other part; bake both pieces, and when done, scoop out the  crumb of the largest, and fill it with a white fricassee of chicken,  sweetbread, or whatever may be selected; the sauce should be well  thickened, or it would soften, and run through the crust.           *       *       *       *       *    A VOL-AU-VENT OF FRUIT.    It is now the fashion to fill _vol-au-vents_ with fruits richly stewed  with sugar until the syrup is almost a jelly; it forms a very pretty  entremet.           *       *       *       *       *    PETITS VOL-AU-VENTS.    These are made in the same way, but cut in small rounds, the crumb  of the larger is scooped out, and the hollow filled with any of the  varieties of patty preparations or preserved fruits.           *       *       *       *       *    MINCE PIES.    Grease and line tin patty-pans with a fine puff paste rolled out thin;  fill them with mince-meat, cover them with another piece of paste,  moisten the edges, close them carefully, cut them evenly round, and  bake them about half an hour in a well-heated oven.           *       *       *       *       *    PATTY MEATS    May be prepared from any dressed materials, such as cold dressed veal,  beef and mutton, poultry, sweetbreads, and fish; the chief art is to  mince them properly, and give them the appropriate flavor and sauce;  for veal, sweetbreads, and poultry, which may be used together or  separately, the usual seasonings are mace, nutmeg, white pepper, salt,  mushrooms minced, or in powder, lemon-peel, and sometimes the juice also;  the mince is warmed in a small quantity of white sauce, not too thin,  and the patty crusts, when ready baked, are filled with it.    For beef and mutton the seasonings are salt, pepper, allspice, a few  sweet herbs powdered, with the addition, if approved, of a little  ketchup; the mince must be warmed in strong well-thickened beef gravy.    If the mince is of fish, season with anchovy sauce, nutmeg,  lemon-peel, pepper and salt; warm it, in a sauce prepared with butter,  flour, and milk or cream, worked together smoothly and stirred till  it thickens; the mince is then simmered in it for a few minutes, till  hot; the seasonings may be put with the sauces, instead of with the  mince.          CHAPTER VII.      Sweet Dishes, Puddings, Cakes, &c.    GENERAL REMARKS.    The freshness of all ingredients for puddings is of great importance.    Dried fruits should be carefully picked, and sometimes washed and  should then be dried. Rice, sago, and all kinds of seed should be  soaked and well washed before they are mixed into puddings.    Half an hour should be allowed for boiling a bread pudding in a half  pint basin, and so on in proportion.    All puddings of the custard kind require gentle boiling, and when  baked must be set in a moderate oven. By whisking to a solid froth the  whites of the eggs used for any pudding, and stirring them into it at  the moment of placing it in the oven, it will become exceedingly light  and rise high in the dish.    All baked puddings should be baked in tin moulds in the form of a deep  pie dish, but slightly fluted, it should be well greased by pouring  into it a little warmed butter, and then turned upside down for a  second, to drain away the superfluous butter; then sprinkle, equally  all over, sifted white sugar, or dried crumbs of bread, then pour the  pudding mixture into the mould; it should, when served, be turned  out of the mould, when it will look rich and brown, and have the  appearance of a cake.    To ensure the lightness of cakes, it is necessary to have all the  ingredients placed for an hour or more before the fire, that they may  all be warm and of equal temperature; without this precaution, cakes  will be heavy even when the best ingredients are employed. Great  care and experience are required in the management of the oven; to  ascertain when a cake is sufficiently baked, plunge a knife into it,  draw it instantly away, when, if the blade is sticky, return the cake  to the oven; if, on the contrary, it appears unsoiled the cake is  ready.    The lightness of cakes depends upon the ingredients being beaten  well together. All stiff cakes may be beaten with the hand, but pound  cakes, sponge, &c., should be beaten with a whisk or spoon.           *       *       *       *       *    BOLA D'AMOR.    The recipe for this much celebrated and exquisite confection is  simpler than may be supposed from its elaborate appearance, it  requires chiefly care, precision, and attention. Clarify two pounds of  white sugar; to ascertain when it is of a proper consistency, drop a  spoonful in cold water, form it into a ball, and try if it sounds  when struck against a glass; when it is thus tested, take the yolks  of twenty eggs, mix them up gently and pass them through a sieve,  then have ready a funnel, the hole of which must be about the size of  vermicelli; hold the funnel over the sugar, while it is boiling over a  charcoal fire; pour the eggs through, stirring the sugar all the time,  and taking care to hold the funnel at such a distance from the sugar,  as to admit of the egg dropping into it. When the egg has been a few  minutes in the sugar, it will be hard enough to take out with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1233"],[0,"The Origin and Nature of the Emotions; Miscellaneous Papers (#13)"],[1,"they subject themselves  to self-injury. Now, since both psychic and mechanical stimuli cause motor  action by the excitation ofprecisely the same mechanism in the brain,  and since the more rapid release of energy from psychic stimuli  submerges the physical stimuli and prevents pain, it would seem  that pain must be a phenomenon which is associated with the process  of releasing energy by the brain-cells. Were physical injury inflicted  in a quiescent state equal to that inflicted in the emotional state,  great pain and intense muscular action would be experienced.  Now the emotions are as purely motor excitants as is pain.  The dynamic result is the same the principal difference being the greater  suddenness and the absolute specificity of the pain stimuli as compared  with the more complex and less peremptory stimuli of the emotions.  A further evidence that pain is a product of the release of brain-cell  energy is the probability that if one could pierce the skin at  many points on a limb in such a manner that antagonistic points  only were equally and simultaneously stimulated, then an equilibrium  in the governing brain- cells would be established and neither  pain nor motion would follow.  An absolute test of this assumption  cannot be made but it is supported by the obtainable evidence.  We will now turn to a new viewpoint, a practical as well as a  fascinating one, which can best be illustrated by two case histories:  A man, seventy-eight years old, whose chief complaint was obstinate  constipation, was admitted to the medical ward of the Lakeside Hospital  several years ago.  The abdomen was but slightly distended;  there was no fever, no increased leukocytosis, no muscular rigidity,  and but slight general tenderness.  He claimed to have lost in weight  and strength during the several months previous to his admission.  A tentative diagnosis of malignant tumor of the large intestine was made,  but free movements weresecured rather easily, and we abandoned  the idea of an exploratory operation.  The patient gradually failed  and died without a definite diagnosis having been made by either  the medical or the surgical service.  At autopsy there was found  a wide-spread peritonitis arising from a perforated appendix.  A child, several years old, was taken ill with some indefinite disease.  A number of the ablest medical and surgical consultants of a leading  medical center thoroughly and repeatedly investigated the case.  Although they could make no definite diagnosis they all  agreed that the trouble surely could not be appendicitis  because there was neither muscular rigidity nor tenderness.  The autopsy showed a gangrenous appendix and general peritonitis.  How can these apparently anomalous cases be explained?  These two cases are illustrations of the same principle that underlies  the freedom from pain which results from the use of narcotics  and anesthetics, the same principle that explains the fact that  cholecystitis may occur in the aged without any other local symptoms  than the presence of a mass and perhaps very slight tenderness;  and that accounts in general for the lack of well-expressed disease  phenomena in senility and in infancy.  The reason why the aged,  the very young, and the subjects of general paresis show but few  symptoms of disease is that in senility the brain is deteriorated,  while in infancy the brain is so undeveloped that the mechanism  of association is inactive, hence pain and tenderness,  which are among the oldest of the associations, are wanting.  Senility and infancy are by nature normally narcotized.  The senile are passing through the twilight into the night;  while infants are traversing through the dawn into the day.  Hence it is that the diagnosis of injury and disease in the extremes  oflife is beset by especial difficulties, since the entire body  is as silent as are the brain, the pericardium, the mediastinum,  and other symptomless areas.  For the same reason, when a patient  who is seriously ill with a painful disease turns upon the physician  a glowing eye and an eager face, and remarks how comfortable he feels,  then the end is near.  This is a brilliant and fateful clinical mirage.  When one reflects on the vast amount of evidence as to the origin  and the purpose of pain, he is forced to conclude that pain is  a phenomenon of motor stimulation, and that its principal role is  the protection of the individual against the gross and the microscopic  enemies in his environment.  The benefits of pain are especially  manifested in the urgent muscular actions by means of which the body  moves away from physical injury; obstructions of the hollow  viscera are overcome; rest is compelled in the acute infections--  the infected points are held rigidly quiet, the muscles of the abdomen  are fixed, and harmful peristalsis is arrested in peritonitis;  while there is absolutely no pain in the diseases or injuries  which affect those regions of the body in which in the course  of evolution no pain receptors were placed, or in those diseases  in which muscular inhibition or contraction is of no help.  In a biologic sense pain is closely associated with the emotional stimuli,  for both pain and the emotions incite motor activity for the good  of the individual.  The frequent occurrence of post-operative and  post- traumatic pain is accounted for by the fact that the operation  or the injury has lowered the threshold of the brain- cells to trauma;  the brain and not the local sensitive field is the site of the pain.  I have found that, by blockingthe field of operation with  local anesthesia, post-operative pain is diminished; that is,  since the local anesthesia prevents the strong stimuli of the  trauma from reaching the brain, its threshold is not lowered.  There is a close resemblance between the phenomena of pain habit,  of education, of physical training, of love and of hate.  In education,  in pain habit, in all emotional relations, a low brain- cell threshold  is established which facilitates the reception of specific stimuli;  all these processes are motor acts, or are symbolic of motor acts,  and we may be trained to perceive misfortune and pain as readily as we  are trained to perceive mathematical formulae or moral precepts.  In each and every case, readiness of perception depends, as it seems to me,  upon a modified state of the brain-cells, their threshold especially,  the final degree of perception possible in any individual being perhaps  based on the type of potential molecules of which the brain is built.  We must believe also that every impression is permanent, as only thus  could an individual animal or a man be fitted by his own experience  for life's battles.  LAUGHTER AND CRYING What is laughter?  What is its probable origin, its distribution, and its purpose?  Laughter is an involuntary rhythmic contraction of certain  respiratory muscles, usually accompanied by certain vocal sounds.  It is a motor act of the respiratory apparatus primarily, although if  intense it may involve not only the extraordinary muscles of respiration,  but most of the muscles of the body.  There are many degrees  of laughter, from the mere brightening of the eyes, a fleeting smile,  tittering andgiggling, to hysteric and convulsive laughter.  Under certain circumstances, laughter may be so intense and  so long continued that it leads to considerable exhaustion.  The formation of tears is sometimes associated with laughter.  When integrated with laughter, the nervous system can perform  no other function.  Crying is closely associated with laughter,  and in children especially laughter and crying are readily interchanged.  We postulate that laughter and weeping serve a useful purpose.  According to Darwin, only man and monkeys laugh (Fig. 26);  other animals exhibit certain types of facial expression accompanying  various emotions, but laughter in the sense in which that word  is commonly used is probably an attribute of the primates only,  although it is probable that many animals find substitutes for laughter.  The proneness of man to laughter is modified by age, sex, training,  mental state, health, and by many other factors.  Healthy, happy children  are especially prone to laughter, while disease, strong emotions,  fatigue, and age diminish laughter.  Women laugh more than do men.  The healthy, happy maturing young woman perhaps laughs most, especially  when she is slightly embarrassed.  What causes laughter?  Good news,  high spirits, tickling, hearing and seeing others laugh; droll stories;  flashes of wit; passages of humor; averted injury; threatened breach  of the conventions; and numerous other causes might be added.  It is obvious that laughter may be produced by diverse influences,  many of which are so unlike each other that it would at first sight  seem improbable that a single general principle underlies all.  Before presenting a hypothesis which harmonizes most of the facts,  and which mayoffer an explanation of the origin and purpose of laughter,  let us return for a moment to some previous considerations--  that man is essentially a motor being; that all his responses to  the physical forces of his environment are motor; {illust. caption  = FIG.  26.--LAUGHING CHIMPANZEE.  \"Mike,\" the clever chimpanzee  in the London Zoo, evidently enjoys a joke as well as any one else.  (Photo by Underwood and Underwood, N. Y.)}      that thoughts and words even are symbolic of motor acts;  that in the emotions of fear, of anger, and of sexual love  the whole body is integrated for acts which are not performed.  These integrations stimulate the brain-cells, the ductless glands,  and other parts, and the energizing secretions, among which are epinephrin,  thyroid and hypophyseal secretions, are thrown into the blood-stream,  while that most available fuel, glycogen, is also mobilized in the blood.
