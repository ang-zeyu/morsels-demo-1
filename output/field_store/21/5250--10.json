But Deirdre did not wish to go with Ferchar Mac Ro, and she tried every  prayer to turn Naois from going with him--she said:    \"I saw a vision, Naois, and do you interpret it to me,\" said  Deirdre--then she sang:      O Naois, son of Uisnech, hear    What was shown in a dream to me.      There came three white doves out of the South      Flying over the sea,    And drops of honey were in their mouth      From the hive of the honey-bee.      O Naois, son of Uisnech, hear,    What was shown in a dream to me.      I saw three grey hawks out of the south      Come flying over the sea,    And the red red drops they bare in their mouth      They were dearer than life to me.    Said Naois:--      It is nought but the fear of woman's heart,    And a dream of the night, Deirdre.    \"The day that Connachar sent the invitation to his feast will be  unlucky for us if we don't go, O Deirdre.\"    \"You will go there,\" said Ferchar Mac Ro; \"and if Connachar show  kindness to you, show ye kindness to him; and if he will display wrath  towards you display ye wrath towards him, and I and my three sons will  be with you.\"    \"We will,\" said Daring Drop. \"We will,\" said Hardy Holly. \"We will,\"  said Fiallan the Fair.    \"I have three sons, and they are three heroes, and in any harm or  danger that may befall you, they will be with you, and I myself will be  along with them.\" And Ferchar Mac Ro gave his vow and his word in  presence of his arms that, in any harm or danger that came in the way  of the sons of Uisnech, he and his three sons would not leave head on  live body in Erin, despite sword or helmet, spear or shield, blade or  mail, be they ever so good.    Deirdre was unwilling to leave Alba, but she went with Naois. Deirdre  wept tears in showers and she sang:      Dear is the land, the land over there,      Alba full of woods and lakes;    Bitter to my heart is leaving thee,      But I go away with Naois.    Ferchar Mac Ro did not stop till he got the sons of Uisnech away with  him, despite the suspicion of Deirdre.      The coracle was put to sea,      The sail was hoisted to it;    And the second morrow they arrived      On the white shores of Erin.    As soon as the sons of Uisnech landed in Erin, Ferchar Mac Ro sent word  to Connachar, king of Ulster, that the men whom he wanted were come,  and let him now show kindness to them. \"Well,\" said Connachar, \"I did  not expect that the sons of Uisnech would come, though I sent for them,  and I am not quite ready to receive them. But there is a house down  yonder where I keep strangers, and let them go down to it today, and my  house will be ready before them tomorrow.\"    But he that was up in the palace felt it long that he was not getting  word as to how matters were going on for those down in the house of the  strangers. \"Go you, Gelban Grednach, son of Lochlin's King, go you down  and bring me information as to whether her former hue and complexion  are on Deirdre. If they be, I will take her out with edge of blade and  point of sword, and if not, let Naois, son of Uisnech, have her for  himself,\" said Connachar.    Gelban, the cheering and charming son of Lochlin's King, went down to  the place of the strangers, where the sons of Uisnech and Deirdre were  staying. He looked in through the bicker-hole on the door-leaf. Now she  that he gazed upon used to go into a crimson blaze of blushes when any  one looked at her. Naois looked at Deirdre and knew that some one was  looking at her from the back of the door-leaf. He seized one of the  dice on the table before him and fired it through the bicker-hole, and  knocked the eye out of Gelban Grednach the Cheerful and Charming, right  through the back of his head. Gelban returned back to the palace of  King Connachar.    \"You were cheerful, charming, going away, but you are cheerless,  charmless, returning. What has happened to you, Gelban? But have you  seen her, and are Deirdre's hue and complexion as before?\" said  Connachar.    \"Well, I have seen Deirdre, and I saw her also truly, and while I was  looking at her through the bicker-hole on the door, Naois, son of  Uisnech, knocked out my eye with one of the dice in his hand. But of a  truth and verity, although he put out even my eye, it were my desire  still to remain looking at her with the other eye, were it not for the  hurry you told me to be in,\" said Gelban.    \"That is true,\" said Connachar; \"let three hundred bravo heroes go down  to the abode of the strangers, and let them bring hither to me Deirdre,  and kill the rest.\"    Connachar ordered three hundred active heroes to go down to the abode  of the strangers and to take Deirdre up with them and kill the rest.  \"The pursuit is coming,\" said Deirdre.    \"Yes, but I will myself go out and stop the pursuit,\" said Naois.    \"It is not you, but we that will go,\" said Daring Drop, and Hardy  Holly, and Fiallan the Fair; \"it is to us that our father entrusted  your defence from harm and danger when he himself left for home.\" And  the gallant youths, full noble, full manly, full handsome, with  beauteous brown locks, went forth girt with battle arms fit for fierce  fight and clothed with combat dress for fierce contest fit, which was  burnished, bright, brilliant, bladed, blazing, on which were many  pictures of beasts and birds and creeping things, lions and  lithe-limbed tigers, brown eagle and harrying hawk and adder fierce;  and the young heroes laid low three-thirds of the company.    Connachar came out in haste and cried with wrath: \"Who is there on the  floor of fight, slaughtering my men?\"    \"We, the three sons of Ferchar Mac Ro.\"    \"Well,\" said the king, \"I will give a free bridge to your grandfather,  a free bridge to your father, and a free bridge each to you three  brothers, if you come over to my side tonight.\"    \"Well, Connachar, we will not accept that offer from you nor thank you  for it. Greater by far do we prefer to go home to our father and tell  the deeds of heroism we have done, than accept anything on these terms  from you. Naois, son of Uisnech, and Allen and Arden are as nearly  related to yourself as they are to us, though you are so keen to shed  their blood, and you would shed our blood also, Connachar.\" And the  noble, manly, handsome youths with beauteous, brown locks returned  inside. \"We are now,\" said they, \"going home to tell our father that  you are now safe from the hands of the king.\" And the youths all fresh  and tall and lithe and beautiful, went home to their father to tell  that the sons of Uisnech were safe. This happened at the parting of the  day and night in the morning twilight time, and Naois said they must go  away, leave that house, and return to Alba.    Naois and Deirdre, Allan and Arden started to return to Alba. Word came  to the king that the company he was in pursuit of were gone. The king  then sent for Duanan Gacha Druid, the best magician he had, and he  spoke to him as follows:--\"Much wealth have I expended on you, Duanan  Gacha Druid, to give schooling and learning and magic mystery to you,  if these people get away from me today without care, without  consideration or regard for me, without chance of overtaking them, and  without power to stop them.\"    \"Well, I will stop them,\" said the magician, \"until the company you  send in pursuit return.\" And the magician placed a wood before them  through which no man could go, but the sons of Uisnech marched through  the wood without halt or hesitation, and Deirdre held on to Naois's  hand.    \"What is the good of that? that will not do yet,\" said Connachar. \"They  are off without bending of their feet or stopping of their step,  without heed or respect to me, and I am without power to keep up to  them or opportunity to turn them back this night.\"    \"I will try another plan on them,\" said the druid; and he placed before  them a grey sea instead of a green plain. The three heroes stripped and  tied their clothes behind their heads, and Naois placed Deirdre on the  top of his shoulder.      They stretched their sides to the stream,      And sea and land were to them the same,    The rough grey ocean was the same      As meadow-land green and plain.    \"Though that be good, O Duanan, it will not make the heroes return,\"  said Connachar; \"they are gone without regard for me, and without  honour to me, and without power on my part to pursue them or to force  them to return this night.\"    \"We shall try another method on them, since yon one did not stop them,\"  said the druid. And the druid froze the grey ridged sea into hard rocky  knobs, the sharpness of sword being on the one edge and the poison  power of adders on the other. Then Arden cried that he was getting  tired, and nearly giving over. \"Come you, Arden, and sit on my right  shoulder,\" said Naois. Arden came and sat, on Naois's shoulder. Arden  was long in this posture when he died; but though he was dead Naois  would not let him go. Allen then cried out that he was getting faint  and nigh-well giving up. When Naois heard his prayer, he gave forth the  piercing sigh of death, and asked Allen to lay hold of him and he would  bring him to land.    Allen was not long when the weakness of death came on him and his hold  failed. Naois looked around, and when he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7896"],[0,"The Eight Strokes of the Clock (#12)"],[1,"her efforts, she burst into  a fit of the wildest laughter:    \"Forgive me,\" she said, her eyes filled with tears, \"do forgive me; it's  too much for my nerves....\"    \"Don't apologize, madame,\" said the young man, gently, in a voice free  from resentment. \"I warned you that my story was laughable; I, better than  any one, know how absurd, how nonsensical it is. Yes, the whole thing is  perfectly grotesque. But believe me when I tell you that it was no fun in  reality. It seems a humorous situation and it remains humorous by the force  of circumstances; but it is also horrible. You can see that for yourself,  can't you? The two mothers, neither of whom was certain of being a mother,  but neither of whom was certain that she was not one, both clung to Jean  Louis. He might be a stranger; on the other hand, he might be their own  flesh and blood. They loved him to excess and fought for him furiously.  And, above all, they both came to hate each other with a deadly hatred.  Differing completely in character and education and obliged to live  together because neither was willing to forego the advantage of her  possible maternity, they lived the life of irreconcilable enemies who can  never lay their weapons aside.... I grew up in the midst of this hatred and  had it instilled into me by both of them. When my childish heart, hungering  for affection, inclined me to one of them, the other would seek to inspire  me with loathing and contempt for her. In this manor-house, which they  bought on the old doctor's death and to which they added the two wings, I  was the involuntary torturer and their daily victim. Tormented as a child,  and, as a young man, leading the most hideous of lives, I doubt if any one  on earth ever suffered more than I did.\"    \"You ought to have left them!\" exclaimed Hortense, who had stopped  laughing.    \"One can't leave one's mother; and one of those two women was my mother.  And a woman can't abandon her son; and each of them was entitled to believe  that I was her son. We were all three chained together like convicts, with  chains of sorrow, compassion, doubt and also of hope that the truth might  one day become apparent. And here we still are, all three, insulting one  another and blaming one another for our wasted lives. Oh, what a hell! And  there was no escaping it. I tried often enough ... but in vain. The broken  bonds became tied again. Only this summer, under the stimulus of my love  for Genevieve, I tried to free myself and did my utmost to persuade the two  women whom I call mother. And then ... and then! I was up against their  complaints, their immediate hatred of the wife, of the stranger, whom I  was proposing to force upon them.... I gave way. What sort of a life would  Genevieve have had here, between Madame d'Imbleval and Madame Vaurois? I  had no right to victimize her.\"    Jean Louis, who had been gradually becoming excited, uttered these last  words in a firm voice, as though he would have wished his conduct to  be ascribed to conscientious motives and a sense of duty. In reality,  as Renine and Hortense clearly saw, his was an unusually weak nature,  incapable of reacting against a ridiculous position from which he had  suffered ever since he was a child and which he had come to look upon as  final and irremediable. He endured it as a man bears a cross which he has  no right to cast aside; and at the same time he was ashamed of it. He had  never spoken of it to Genevieve, from dread of ridicule; and afterwards, on  returning to his prison, he had remained there out of habit and weakness.    He sat down to a writing-table and quickly wrote a letter which he handed  to Renine:    \"Would you be kind enough to give this note to Mlle. Aymard and beg her  once more to forgive me?\"    Renine did not move and, when the other pressed the letter upon him, he  took it and tore it up.    \"What does this mean?\" asked the young man.    \"It means that I will not charge myself with any message.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because you are coming with us.\"    \"I?\"    \"Yes. You will see Mlle. Aymard to-morrow and ask for her hand in  marriage.\"    Jean Louis looked at Renine with a rather disdainful air, as though he were  thinking:    \"Here's a man who has not understood a word of what I've been explaining to  him.\"    But Hortense went up to Renine:    \"Why do you say that?\"    \"Because it will be as I say.\"    \"But you must have your reasons?\"    \"One only; but it will be enough, provided this gentleman is so kind as to  help me in my enquiries.\"    \"Enquiries? With what object?\" asked the young man.    \"With the object of proving that your story is not quite accurate.\"    Jean Louis took umbrage at this:    \"I must ask you to believe, monsieur, that I have not said a word which is  not the exact truth.\"    \"I expressed myself badly,\" said Renine, with great kindliness. \"Certainly  you have not said a word that does not agree with what you believe to be  the exact truth. But the truth is not, cannot be what you believe it to  be.\"    The young man folded his arms:    \"In any case, monsieur, it seems likely that I should know the truth better  than you do.\"    \"Why better? What happened on that tragic night can obviously be known to  you only at secondhand. You have no proofs. Neither have Madame d'Imbleval  and Madame Vaurois.\"    \"No proofs of what?\" exclaimed Jean Louis, losing patience.    \"No proofs of the confusion that took place.\"    \"What! Why, it's an absolute certainty! The two children were laid in the  same cradle, with no marks to distinguish one from the other; and the nurse  was unable to tell....\"    \"At least, that's her version of it,\" interrupted Renine.    \"What's that? Her version? But you're accusing the woman.\"    \"I'm accusing her of nothing.\"    \"Yes, you are: you're accusing her of lying. And why should she lie? She  had no interest in doing so; and her tears and despair are so much evidence  of her good faith. For, after all, the two mothers were there ... they saw  the woman weeping ... they questioned her.... And then, I repeat, what  interest had she ...?\"    Jean Louis was greatly excited. Close beside him, Madame d'Imbleval and  Madame Vaurois, who had no doubt been listening behind the doors and who  had stealthily entered the room, stood stammering, in amazement:    \"No, no ... it's impossible.... We've questioned her over and over again.  Why should she tell a lie?...\"    \"Speak, monsieur, speak,\" Jean Louis enjoined. \"Explain yourself. Give your  reasons for trying to cast doubt upon an absolute truth!\"    \"Because that truth is inadmissible,\" declared Renine, raising his voice  and growing excited in turn to the point of punctuating his remarks by  thumping the table. \"No, things don't happen like that. No, fate does not  display those refinements of cruelty and chance is not added to chance with  such reckless extravagance! It was already an unprecedented chance that, on  the very night on which the doctor, his man-servant and his maid were out  of the house, the two ladies should be seized with labour-pains at the same  hour and should bring two sons into the world at the same time. Don't let  us add a still more exceptional event! Enough of the uncanny! Enough of  lamps that go out and candles that refuse to burn! No and again no, it  is not admissable that a midwife should become confused in the essential  details of her trade. However bewildered she may be by the unforeseen  nature of the circumstances, a remnant of instinct is still on the alert,  so that there is a place prepared for each child and each is kept distinct  from the other. The first child is here, the second is there. Even if they  are lying side by side, one is on the left and the other on the right.  Even if they are wrapped in the same kind of binders, some little detail  differs, a trifle which is recorded by the memory and which is inevitably  recalled to the mind without any need of reflection. Confusion? I refuse  to believe in it. Impossible to tell one from the other? It isn't true. In  the world of fiction, yes, one can imagine all sorts of fantastic accidents  and heap contradiction on contradiction. But, in the world of reality, at  the very heart of reality, there is always a fixed point, a solid nucleus,  about which the facts group themselves in accordance with a logical order.  I therefore declare most positively that Nurse Boussignol could not have  mixed up the two children.\"    All this he said decisively, as though he had been present during the night  in question; and so great was his power of persuasion that from the very  first he shook the certainty of those who for more than a quarter of a  century had never doubted.    The two women and their son pressed round him and questioned him with  breathless anxiety:    \"Then you think that she may know ... that she may be able to tell us....?\"    He corrected himself:    \"I don't say yes and I don't say no. All I say is that there was something  in her behaviour during those hours that does not tally with her statements  and with reality. All the vast and intolerable mystery that has weighed  down upon you three arises not from a momentary lack of attention but from  something of which we do not know, but of which she does. That is what I  maintain; and that is what happened.\"    Jean Louis said, in a husky voice:    \"She is alive.... She lives at Carhaix.... We can send for her....\"    Hortense at once proposed:    \"Would you like me to go for her? I will take the motor and bring her back  with me. Where does she live?\"    \"In the middle of the town, at a little draper's shop. The chauffeur will  show you. Mlle. Boussignol: everybody knows her....\"    \"And, whatever you do,\" added Renine, \"don't warn her in any way. If she's  uneasy, so much the better. But don't let her know what we want with her.\"    Twenty minutes passed in absolute silence. Renine paced the room, in which  the fine old furniture, the handsome"]]]
