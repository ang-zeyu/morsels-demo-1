At first he had a great  part of a mind not to proclaim the Fair, but second thought told him  that men would laugh at him and say among themselves that he was afraid  of Robin Hood, so he put that thought by.  At last he fixed in his mind  that he would offer such a prize as they would not care to shoot for. At  such times it had been the custom to offer a half score of marks or a  tun of ale, so this year he proclaimed that a prize of two fat steers  should be given to the best bowman.    When Robin Hood heard what had been proclaimed he was vexed, and said,  \"Now beshrew this Sheriff that he should offer such a prize that none  but shepherd hinds will care to shoot for it! I would have loved nothing  better than to have had another bout at merry Nottingham Town, but if I  should win this prize nought would it pleasure or profit me.\"    Then up spoke Little John:  \"Nay, but hearken, good master,\" said he,  \"only today Will Stutely, young David of Doncaster, and I were at the  Sign of the Blue Boar, and there we heard all the news of this merry  Fair, and also that the Sheriff hath offered this prize, that we of  Sherwood might not care to come to the Fair; so, good master, if thou  wilt, I would fain go and strive to win even this poor thing among the  stout yeomen who will shoot at Nottingham Town.\"    \"Nay, Little John,\" quoth Robin, \"thou art a sound stout fellow, yet  thou lackest the cunning that good Stutely hath, and I would not have  harm befall thee for all Nottinghamshire.  Nevertheless, if thou wilt  go, take some disguise lest there be those there who may know thee.\"    \"So be it, good master,\" quoth Little John, \"yet all the disguise that I  wish is a good suit of scarlet instead of this of Lincoln green. I will  draw the cowl of my jacket about my head so that it will hide my brown  hair and beard, and then, I trust, no one will know me.\"    \"It is much against my will,\" said Robin Hood, \"ne'ertheless, if thou  dost wish it, get thee gone, but bear thyself seemingly, Little John,  for thou art mine own right-hand man and I could ill bear to have harm  befall thee.\"    So Little John clad himself all in scarlet and started off to the Fair  at Nottingham Town.    Right merry were these Fair days at Nottingham, when the green before  the great town gate was dotted with booths standing in rows, with tents  of many-colored canvas, hung about with streamers and garlands of  flowers, and the folk came from all the countryside, both gentle and  common. In some booths there was dancing to merry music, in others  flowed ale and beer, and in others yet again sweet cakes and barley  sugar were sold; and sport was going outside the booths also, where some  minstrel sang ballads of the olden time, playing a second upon the harp,  or where the wrestlers struggled with one another within the sawdust  ring, but the people gathered most of all around a raised platform where  stout fellows played at quarterstaff.    So Little John came to the Fair.  All scarlet were his hose and jerkin,  and scarlet was his cowled cap, with a scarlet feather stuck in the side  of it.  Over his shoulders was slung a stout bow of yew, and across his  back hung a quiver of good round arrows.  Many turned to look after such  a stout, tall fellow, for his shoulders were broader by a palm's-breadth  than any that were there, and he stood a head taller than all the other  men. The lasses, also, looked at him askance, thinking they had never  seen a lustier youth.    First of all he went to the booth where stout ale was sold and, standing  aloft on a bench, he called to all that were near to come and drink with  him.  \"Hey, sweet lads!\" cried he \"who will drink ale with a stout  yeoman?  Come, all!  Come, all! Let us be merry, for the day is sweet  and the ale is tingling. Come hither, good yeoman, and thou, and thou;  for not a farthing shall one of you pay.  Nay, turn hither, thou lusty  beggar, and thou jolly tinker, for all shall be merry with me.\"    Thus he shouted, and all crowded around, laughing, while the brown ale  flowed; and they called Little John a brave fellow, each swearing that  he loved him as his own brother; for when one has entertainment with  nothing to pay, one loves the man that gives it to one.    Then he strolled to the platform where they were at cudgel play, for he  loved a bout at quarterstaff as he loved meat and drink; and here befell  an adventure that was sung in ballads throughout the mid-country for  many a day.    One fellow there was that cracked crowns of everyone who threw cap into  the ring.  This was Eric o' Lincoln, of great renown, whose name had  been sung in ballads throughout the countryside. When Little John  reached the stand he found none fighting, but only bold Eric walking up  and down the platform, swinging his staff and shouting lustily, \"Now,  who will come and strike a stroke for the lass he loves the best, with a  good Lincolnshire yeoman?  How now, lads?  Step up! Step up!  Or else  the lasses' eyes are not bright hereabouts, or the blood of Nottingham  youth is sluggish and cold. Lincoln against Nottingham, say I!  For no  one hath put foot upon the boards this day such as we of Lincoln call a  cudgel player.\"    At this, one would nudge another with his elbow, saying, \"Go thou, Ned!\"  or \"Go thou, Thomas!\" but no lad cared to gain a cracked crown for  nothing.    Presently Eric saw where Little John stood among the others, a head and  shoulders above them all, and he called to him loudly, \"Halloa, thou  long-legged fellow in scarlet! Broad are thy shoulders and thick thy  head; is not thy lass fair enough for thee to take cudgel in hand for  her sake? In truth, I believe that Nottingham men do turn to bone and  sinew, for neither heart nor courage have they!  Now, thou great lout,  wilt thou not twirl staff for Nottingham?\"    \"Ay,\" quoth Little John, \"had I but mine own good staff here, it would  pleasure me hugely to crack thy knave's pate, thou saucy braggart! I wot  it would be well for thee an thy cock's comb were cut!\" Thus he spoke,  slowly at first, for he was slow to move; but his wrath gathered headway  like a great stone rolling down a hill, so that at the end he was full  of anger.    Then Eric o' Lincoln laughed aloud.  \"Well spoken for one who fears to  meet me fairly, man to man,\" said he.  \"Saucy art thou thine own self,  and if thou puttest foot upon these boards, I will make thy saucy tongue  rattle within thy teeth!\"    \"Now,\" quoth Little John, \"is there never a man here that will lend me a  good stout staff till I try the mettle of yon fellow?\" At this, half a  score reached him their staves, and he took the stoutest and heaviest of  them all.  Then, looking up and down the cudgel, he said, \"Now, I have  in my hand but a splint of wood--a barley straw, as it were--yet I trow  it will have to serve me, so here goeth.\" Thereupon he cast the cudgel  upon the stand and, leaping lightly after it, snatched it up in his hand  again.    Then each man stood in his place and measured the other with fell looks  until he that directed the sport cried, \"Play!\"  At this they stepped  forth, each grasping his staff tightly in the middle. Then those that  stood around saw the stoutest game of quarterstaff that e'er Nottingham  Town beheld.  At first Eric o' Lincoln thought that he would gain an  easy advantage, so he came forth as if he would say, \"Watch, good  people, how that I carve you this cockerel right speedily\"; but he  presently found it to be no such speedy matter.  Right deftly he struck,  and with great skill of fence, but he had found his match in Little  John.  Once, twice, thrice, he struck, and three times Little John  turned the blows to the left hand and to the right. Then quickly and  with a dainty backhanded blow, he rapped Eric beneath his guard so  shrewdly that it made his head ring again. Then Eric stepped back to  gather his wits, while a great shout went up and all were glad that  Nottingham had cracked Lincoln's crown; and thus ended the first bout of  the game.    Then presently the director of the sport cried, \"Play!\" and they came  together again; but now Eric played warily, for he found his man was of  right good mettle, and also he had no sweet memory of the blow that he  had got; so this bout neither Little John nor the Lincoln man caught a  stroke within his guard.  Then, after a while, they parted again, and  this made the second bout.    Then for the third time they came together, and at first Eric strove to  be wary, as he had been before; but, growing mad at finding himself so  foiled, he lost his wits and began to rain blows so fiercely and so fast  that they rattled like hail on penthouse roof; but, in spite of all, he  did not reach within Little John's guard. Then at last Little John saw  his chance and seized it right cleverly. Once more, with a quick blow,  he rapped Eric beside the head, and ere he could regain himself, Little  John slipped his right hand down to his left and, with a swinging blow,  smote the other so sorely upon the crown that down he fell as though he  would never move again.    Then the people shouted so loud that folk came running from all about to  see what was the ado; while Little John leaped down from the stand and  gave the staff back to him that had lent it to him. And thus ended the  famous bout between Little John and Eric o' Lincoln of great renown.    But now the time had come when those who were to shoot with the longbow  were to take their places, so the people began flocking to the butts  where the shooting was to be.  Near the target, in a good place, sat the  Sheriff upon a raised dais, with many gentlefolk"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1015"],[0,"The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life (#13)"],[1,"American Desert--extending for hundreds of miles to the  Arkansas on the one side, and the Missouri on the other. Before us and  behind us, the level monotony of the plain was unbroken as far as the  eye could reach. Sometimes it glared in the sun, an expanse of hot,  bare sand; sometimes it was veiled by long coarse grass. Huge skulls  and whitening bones of buffalo were scattered everywhere; the ground  was tracked by myriads of them, and often covered with the circular  indentations where the bulls had wallowed in the hot weather. From every  gorge and ravine, opening from the hills, descended deep, well-worn  paths, where the buffalo issue twice a day in regular procession down  to drink in the Platte. The river itself runs through the midst, a thin  sheet of rapid, turbid water, half a mile wide, and scarce two feet  deep. Its low banks for the most part without a bush or a tree, are of  loose sand, with which the stream is so charged that it grates on  the teeth in drinking. The naked landscape is, of itself, dreary and  monotonous enough, and yet the wild beasts and wild men that frequent  the valley of the Platte make it a scene of interest and excitement to  the traveler. Of those who have journeyed there, scarce one, perhaps,  fails to look back with fond regret to his horse and his rifle.    Early in the morning after we reached the Platte, a long procession of  squalid savages approached our camp. Each was on foot, leading his horse  by a rope of bull-hide. His attire consisted merely of a scanty cincture  and an old buffalo robe, tattered and begrimed by use, which hung  over his shoulders. His head was close shaven, except a ridge of hair  reaching over the crown from the center of the forehead, very much like  the long bristles on the back of a hyena, and he carried his bow and  arrows in his hand, while his meager little horse was laden with dried  buffalo meat, the produce of his hunting. Such were the first specimens  that we met--and very indifferent ones they were--of the genuine savages  of the prairie.    They were the Pawnees whom Kearsley had encountered the day before, and  belonged to a large hunting party known to be ranging the prairie in the  vicinity. They strode rapidly past, within a furlong of our tents,  not pausing or looking toward us, after the manner of Indians when  meditating mischief or conscious of ill-desert. I went out and met them;  and had an amicable conference with the chief, presenting him with  half a pound of tobacco, at which unmerited bounty he expressed much  gratification. These fellows, or some of their companions had committed  a dastardly outrage upon an emigrant party in advance of us. Two men,  out on horseback at a distance, were seized by them, but lashing their  horses, they broke loose and fled. At this the Pawnees raised the yell  and shot at them, transfixing the hindermost through the back with  several arrows, while his companion galloped away and brought in the  news to his party. The panic-stricken emigrants remained for several  days in camp, not daring even to send out in quest of the dead body.    The reader will recollect Turner, the man whose narrow escape was  mentioned not long since. We heard that the men, whom the entreaties  of his wife induced to go in search of him, found him leisurely driving  along his recovered oxen, and whistling in utter contempt of the Pawnee  nation. His party was encamped within two miles of us; but we passed  them that morning, while the men were driving in the oxen, and the women  packing their domestic utensils and their numerous offspring in the  spacious patriarchal wagons. As we looked back we saw their caravan  dragging its slow length along the plain; wearily toiling on its way, to  found new empires in the West.    Our New England climate is mild and equable compared with that of the  Platte. This very morning, for instance, was close and sultry, the sun  rising with a faint oppressive heat; when suddenly darkness gathered in  the west, and a furious blast of sleet and hail drove full in our faces,  icy cold, and urged with such demoniac vehemence that it felt like a  storm of needles. It was curious to see the horses; they faced about  in extreme displeasure, holding their tails like whipped dogs, and  shivering as the angry gusts, howling louder than a concert of wolves,  swept over us. Wright's long train of mules came sweeping round before  the storm like a flight of brown snowbirds driven by a winter tempest.  Thus we all remained stationary for some minutes, crouching close to our  horses' necks, much too surly to speak, though once the captain looked  up from between the collars of his coat, his face blood-red, and the  muscles of his mouth contracted by the cold into a most ludicrous grin  of agony. He grumbled something that sounded like a curse, directed  as we believed, against the unhappy hour when he had first thought of  leaving home. The thing was too good to last long; and the instant the  puffs of wind subsided we erected our tents, and remained in camp for  the rest of a gloomy and lowering day. The emigrants also encamped near  at hand. We, being first on the ground, had appropriated all the wood  within reach; so that our fire alone blazed cheerfully. Around it soon  gathered a group of uncouth figures, shivering in the drizzling rain.  Conspicuous among them were two or three of the half-savage men who  spend their reckless lives in trapping among the Rocky Mountains, or  in trading for the Fur Company in the Indian villages. They were all  of Canadian extraction; their hard, weather-beaten faces and bushy  mustaches looked out from beneath the hoods of their white capotes with  a bad and brutish expression, as if their owner might be the willing  agent of any villainy. And such in fact is the character of many of  these men.    On the day following we overtook Kearsley's wagons, and thenceforward,  for a week or two, we were fellow-travelers. One good effect, at least,  resulted from the alliance; it materially diminished the serious fatigue  of standing guard; for the party being now more numerous, there were  longer intervals between each man's turns of duty.        CHAPTER VII    THE BUFFALO      Four days on the Platte, and yet no buffalo! Last year's signs of them  were provokingly abundant; and wood being extremely scarce, we found an  admirable substitute in bois de vache, which burns exactly like peat,  producing no unpleasant effects. The wagons one morning had left the  camp; Shaw and I were already on horseback, but Henry Chatillon still  sat cross-legged by the dead embers of the fire, playing pensively with  the lock of his rifle, while his sturdy Wyandotte pony stood quietly  behind him, looking over his head. At last he got up, patted the neck of  the pony (whom, from an exaggerated appreciation of his merits, he had  christened \"Five Hundred Dollar\"), and then mounted with a melancholy  air.    \"What is it, Henry?\"    \"Ah, I feel lonesome; I never been here before; but I see away yonder  over the buttes, and down there on the prairie, black--all black with  buffalo!\"    In the afternoon he and I left the party in search of an antelope; until  at the distance of a mile or two on the right, the tall white wagons  and the little black specks of horsemen were just visible, so slowly  advancing that they seemed motionless; and far on the left rose the  broken line of scorched, desolate sand-hills. The vast plain waved with  tall rank grass that swept our horses' bellies; it swayed to and fro in  billows with the light breeze, and far and near antelope and wolves were  moving through it, the hairy backs of the latter alternately appearing  and disappearing as they bounded awkwardly along; while the antelope,  with the simple curiosity peculiar to them, would often approach as  closely, their little horns and white throats just visible above the  grass tops, as they gazed eagerly at us with their round black eyes.    I dismounted, and amused myself with firing at the wolves. Henry  attentively scrutinized the surrounding landscape; at length he gave a  shout, and called on me to mount again, pointing in the direction of the  sand-hills. A mile and a half from us, two minute black specks  slowly traversed the face of one of the bare glaring declivities, and  disappeared behind the summit. \"Let us go!\" cried Henry, belaboring the  sides of Five Hundred Dollar; and I following in his wake, we galloped  rapidly through the rank grass toward the base of the hills.    From one of their openings descended a deep ravine, widening as it  issued on the prairie. We entered it, and galloping up, in a moment were  surrounded by the bleak sand-hills. Half of their steep sides were bare;  the rest were scantily clothed with clumps of grass, and various uncouth  plants, conspicuous among which appeared the reptile-like prickly-pear.  They were gashed with numberless ravines; and as the sky had suddenly  darkened, and a cold gusty wind arisen, the strange shrubs and the  dreary hills looked doubly wild and desolate. But Henry's face was all  eagerness. He tore off a little hair from the piece of buffalo robe  under his saddle, and threw it up, to show the course of the wind. It  blew directly before us. The game were therefore to windward, and it was  necessary to make our best speed to get around them.    We scrambled from this ravine, and galloping away through the hollows,  soon found another, winding like a snake among the hills, and so deep  that it completely concealed us. We rode up the bottom of it, glancing  through the shrubbery at its edge, till Henry abruptly jerked his rein,  and slid out of his saddle. Full a quarter of a mile distant, on the  outline of the farthest hill, a long procession of buffalo were walking,  in Indian file, with the utmost gravity and deliberation; then more  appeared, clambering from a hollow not far off, and ascending, one  behind the"]]]
