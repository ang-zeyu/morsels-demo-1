He was now in London as agent for Pennsylvania  and Massachusetts. His scientific and literary reputation gave him great  influence. He was examined at the bar of the House of Commons. Many  questions and answers were arranged beforehand between Franklin and his  friends in the House. But many questions were answered on the spur of  the moment. Before the passage of the Stamp Act the feeling of the  colonists toward Britain had been \"the best in the world.\" So Franklin  declared. But now, he said, it was greatly altered. Still an army sent  to America would find no rebellion there. It might, indeed, make one. In  conclusion, he said the repeal of the act would not make the colonists  any more willing to pay taxes.    [Sidenote: Fall of Grenville.]    [Sidenote: Repeal of the Stamp Act, 1766.]    [Sidenote: The Declaratory Act, 1766.]    113. Repeal of the Stamp Act, 1766.--It chanced that at this moment  George III and George Grenville fell out. The king dismissed the  minister, and gave the Marquis of Rockingham the headship of a new set  of ministers. Now Rockingham and his friends needed aid from somebody to  give them the strength to outvote Grenville and the Tories. So when the  question of what should be done about the Stamp Act came up, they  listened most attentively to what Mr. Pitt had to say. That great man  said that the Stamp Act should be repealed wholly and at once. At the  same time another law should be passed declaring that Parliament had  power to legislate for the colonies in all cases whatsoever. The  Rockinghams at once did as Mr. Pitt suggested. The Stamp Act was  repealed. The Declaratory Act was passed. In the colonies Pitt was  praised as a deliverer. Statues of him were placed in the streets,  pictures of him were hung in public halls. But, in reality, the passage  of the Declaratory Act was the beginning of more trouble.    [Sidenote: The Chatham Ministry.]    [Sidenote: The Townshend Acts, 1767. _McMaster_, 117-118.]    114. The Townshend Acts, 1767.--The Rockingham ministers did what  Mr. Pitt advised them to do. He then turned them out and made a ministry  of his own. He was now Earl of Chatham, and his ministry was the Chatham  Ministry. The most active of the Chatham ministers was Charles  Townshend. He had the management of the finances and found them very  hard to manage. So he hit upon a scheme of laying duties on wine, oil,  glass, lead, painter's colors, and tea imported into the colonies. Mr.  Pitt had said that Parliament could regulate colonial trade. The best  way to regulate trade was to tax it. At the same time that Townshend  brought in this bill, he brought in others to reorganize the colonial  customs service and make it possible to collect the duties. He even  provided that offences against the revenue laws should be tried by  judges appointed directly by the king, without being submitted to a jury  of any kind.    [Sidenote: The Sugar Act.]    [Sidenote: Enforcement of the Navigation Acts.]    115. Colonial Opposition, 1768.--Many years before this, Parliament  had made a law taxing all sugar brought into the continental colonies,  except sugar that had been made in the British West Indies. Had this law  been carried out, the trade of Massachusetts and other New England  colonies would have been ruined. But the law was not enforced. No one  tried to enforce it, except during the few months of vigor at the time  of the arguments about writs of assistance. As the taxes were not  collected, no one cared whether they were legal or not. Now it was plain  that this tax and the Townshend duties were to be collected. The  Massachusetts House of Representatives drew up a circular letter to the  other colonial assemblies asking them to join in opposing the new taxes.  The British government ordered the House to recall the letter. It  refused and was dissolved. The other colonial assemblies were directed  to take no notice of the circular letter. They replied at the first  possible moment and were dissolved.    [Sidenote: Seizure of the sloop _Liberty_, 1768.]    116. The New Customs Officers at Boston, 1768.--The chief office of  the new customs organization was fixed at Boston. Soon John Hancock's  sloop, _Liberty_, sailed into the harbor with a cargo of Madeira wine.  As Hancock had no idea of paying the duty, the customs officers seized  the sloop and towed her under the guns of a warship which was in the  harbor. Crowds of people now collected. They could not recapture the  _Liberty_. They seized one of the war-ship's boats, carried it to the  Common, and had a famous bonfire. All this confusion frightened the  chief customs officers. They fled to the castle in the harbor and wrote  to the government for soldiers to protect them.    [Illustration: ONE OF JOHN HANCOCK'S BILL-HEADS.]    [Sidenote: Virginia Resolves, 1769.]    117. The Virginia Resolves of 1769.--Parliament now asked the king  to have colonists, accused of certain crimes, brought to England for  trial. This aroused the Virginians. They passed a set of resolutions,  known as the Virginia Resolves of 1769. These resolves asserted: (1)  that the colonists only had the right to tax the colonists; (2) that the  colonists had the right to petition either by themselves or with the  people of other colonies; and (3) that no colonist ought to be sent to  England for trial.    [Sidenote: Non-Importation Agreements, 1769.]    [Sidenote: Partial repeal of the Townshend Acts, 1770.]    118. Non-Importation Agreements, 1769.--When he learned what was  going on, the governor of Virginia dissolved the assembly. But the  members met in the Raleigh tavern near by. There George Washington laid  before them a written agreement to use no British goods upon which  duties had been paid. They all signed this agreement. Soon the other  colonies joined Virginia in the Non-Importation Agreement. English  merchants found their trade growing smaller and smaller. They could not  even collect their debts, for the colonial merchants said that trade in  the colonies was so upset by the Townshend Acts that they could not sell  their goods, or collect the money owing to them. The British merchants  petitioned Parliament to repeal the duties, and Parliament answered them  by repealing all the duties except the tax on tea.

The Soldiers at New York and Boston.--Soldiers had been  stationed at New York ever since the end of the French war because that  was the most central point on the coast. The New Yorkers did not like to  have the soldiers there very well, because Parliament expected them to  supply the troops with certain things without getting any money in  return. The New York Assembly refused to supply them, and Parliament  suspended the Assembly's sittings. In 1768 two regiments came from New  York to Boston to protect the customs officers.    [Sidenote: The Boston Massacre, 1770. _Higginson_, 166-169; _McMaster_,  118.]    120. The Boston Massacre, 1770.--There were not enough soldiers at  Boston to protect the customs officers--if the colonists really wished  to hurt them. There were quite enough soldiers at Boston to get  themselves and the colonists into trouble. On March 5, 1770, a crowd  gathered around the soldiers stationed on King's Street, now State  Street. There was snow on the ground, and the boys began to throw snow  and mud at the soldiers. The crowd grew bolder. Suddenly the soldiers  fired on the people. They killed four colonists and wounded several  more. Led by Samuel Adams, the people demanded the removal of the  soldiers to the fort in the harbor. Hutchinson was now governor. He  offered to send one regiment out of the town. \"All or none,\" said Adams,  and all were sent away.    [Sidenote: Town Committees of Correspondence.]    [Sidenote: Colonial Committees of Correspondence, 1769.]    121. Committees of Correspondence.--Up to this time the resistance  of the colonists had been carried on in a haphazard sort of way. Now  Committees of Correspondence began to be appointed. These committees  were of two kinds. First there were town Committees of Correspondence.  These were invented by Samuel Adams and were first appointed in  Massachusetts. But more important were the colonial Committees of  Correspondence. The first of these was appointed by Virginia in 1769. At  first few colonies followed Massachusetts and Virginia in appointing  committees. But as one act of tyranny succeeded another, other colonies  fell into line. By 1775 all the colonies were united by a complete  system of Committees of Correspondence.    [Sidenote: The tax on tea. _McMaster_, 119.]    122. The Tea Tax.--Of all the Townshend duties only the tax on tea  was left. It happened that the British East India Company had tons of  tea in its London storehouses and was greatly in need of money. The  government told the company that it might send tea to America without  paying any taxes in England, but the three-penny colonial tax would have  to be paid in the colonies. In this way the colonists would get their  tea cheaper than the people of England. But the colonists were not to be  bribed into paying the tax in any such way. The East India Company sent  over ship-loads of tea. The tea ships were either sent back again or the  tea was stored in some safe place where no one could get it.

The agents of the East India Company refused to resign. The  collector of the customs refused to give the ships permission to sail  away before the tea was landed.

If the lady be light, you must take care not to give her too much  impetus in mounting. We have known a lady nearly thrown over her horse  by a misplaced zeal of this kind.    In riding with a lady, never permit her to pay the tolls.    If a gate has to be opened, we need hardly observe that it is your  place to hold it open till the lady has passed through.    In driving, a gentleman places himself with his back to the horses,  and leaves the best seat for the ladies.    If you are alone in a carriage with a lady, never sit beside her,  unless you are her husband, father, son, or brother. Even though  you be her affianced lover, you should still observe this rule of  etiquette. To do otherwise, would be to assume the unceremonious air  of a husband.    When the carriage stops, the gentleman should alight first, in order  to assist the lady.    To get in and out of a carriage gracefully is a simple but important  accomplishment. If there is but one step, and you are going to take  your seat facing the horses, put your left foot on the step and enter  the carriage with your right in such a manner as to drop at once  into your seat. If you are about to sit with your back to the horses,  reverse the process. As you step into the carriage, be careful to keep  your back towards the seat you are about to occupy, so as to avoid the  awkwardness of turning when you are once in.    A gentleman cannot be too careful to avoid stepping on ladies'  dresses when he gets in or out of a carriage. He should also beware of  shutting them in with the door.           *       *       *       *       *    IX.--MORNING AND EVENING PARTIES.      The morning party is a modern invention; it was unknown to our fathers  and mothers, and even to ourselves, till quite lately. A morning party  is seldom given out of the season--that is to say, during any months  except those of May, June, and July. It begins about two o'clock and  ends about five, and the entertainment consists for the most part  of conversation, music, and (if there be a garden) croquet, lawn  billiards, archery, &c. \"Aunt Sally\" is now out of fashion. The  refreshments are given in the form of a _dejeuner a la fourchette_.    Elegant morning dress, general good manners, and some acquaintance  with the topics of the day and the games above named, are all the  qualifications especially necessary to a gentleman at a morning party.    An evening party begins about nine o'clock, p.m., and ends about  midnight, or somewhat later. Good breeding neither demands that you  should present yourself at the commencement, nor remain till the close  of the evening. You come and go as may be most convenient to you, and  by these means are at liberty, during the height of the season when  evening parties are numerous, to present yourself at two or three  houses during a single evening.    Always put your gloves on before entering the drawing-room, and be  careful that there is no speck of mud upon your boots or trousers.    When your name is announced, look for the lady of the house and pay  your respects to her before you even seem to see any other of  your friends who may be in the room. At very large and fashionable  receptions, the hostess is generally to be found near the door. Should  you, however, find yourself separated by a dense crowd of guests, you  are at liberty to recognize those who are near you, and those whom you  encounter as you make your way slowly through the throng.    General salutations of the company are now wholly disused. In society,  a man only recognizes his own friends and acquaintances.    If you are at the house of a new acquaintance and find yourself among  entire strangers, remember that by so meeting under one roof you are  all in a certain sense made known to one another, and should therefore  converse freely, as equals. To shrink away to a side-table and affect  to be absorbed in some album or illustrated work; or, if you find one  unlucky acquaintance in the room, to fasten upon him like a drowning  man clinging to a spar, are _gaucheries_ which no shyness can excuse.  An easy and unembarrassed manner, and the self-possession requisite  to open a conversation with those who happen to be near you, are the  indispensable credentials of a well-bred man.    At an evening party, do not remain too long in one spot. To be  afraid to move from one drawing-room to another is the sure sign of a  neophyte in society.    If you have occasion to use your handkerchief, do so as noiselessly as  possible. To blow your nose as if it were a trombone, or to turn your  head aside when using your handkerchief, are vulgarities scrupulously  to be avoided.    Never stand upon the hearth-rug with your back to the fire, either  in a friend's house or your own. We have seen even well-bred men at  evening parties commit this selfish and vulgar solecism.    Never offer any one the chair from which you have just risen, unless  there be no other disengaged.    If when supper is announced no lady has been especially placed under  your care by the hostess, offer your arm to whichever lady you may  have last conversed with.    If you possess any musical accomplishments, do not wait to be pressed  and entreated by your hostess, but comply immediately when she pays  you the compliment of inviting you to play or sing. Remember, however,  that only the lady of the house has the right to ask you. If others do  so, you can put them off in some polite way; but must not comply till  the hostess herself invites you.    If you sing comic songs, be careful that they are of the most  unexceptionable kind, and likely to offend neither the tastes nor  prejudices of the society in which you find yourself. At an evening  party given expressly in honour of a distinguished lady of colour,  we once heard a thoughtless amateur dash into the broadly comic, but  terribly appropriate nigger song of \"Sally come up.\" Before he had  got through the first verse, he had perceived his mistake, and was  so overwhelmed with shame that he could scarcely preserve sufficient  presence of mind to carry him through to the end.    If the party be of a small and social kind, and those games called by  the French _les jeux innocents_ are proposed, do not object to join in  them when invited. It may be that they demand some slight exercise  of wit and readiness, and that you do not feel yourself calculated to  shine in them; but it is better to seem dull than disagreeable, and  those who are obliging can always find some clever neighbour to assist  them in the moment of need. The game of \"consequences\" is one which  unfortunately gives too much scope to liberty of expression. If you  join in this game, we cannot too earnestly enjoin you never to write  down one word which the most pure-minded woman present might not read  aloud without a blush. Jests of an equivocal character are not only  vulgar, but contemptible.    Impromptu charades are frequently organized at friendly parties.  Unless you have really some talent for acting and some readiness of  speech, you should remember that you only put others out and expose  your own inability by taking part in these entertainments. Of course,  if your help is really needed and you would disoblige by refusing, you  must do your best, and by doing it as quietly and coolly as possible,  avoid being awkward or ridiculous.    Should an impromptu polka or quadrille be got up after supper at a  party where no dancing was intended, be sure not to omit putting on  gloves before you stand up. It is well always to have a pair of white  gloves in your pocket in case of need; but even black are better under  these circumstances than none.    Even though you may take no pleasure in cards, some knowledge of the  etiquette and rules belonging to the games most in vogue is necessary  to you in society. If a fourth hand is wanted at a rubber, or if the  rest of the company sit down to a round game, you would be deemed  guilty of an impoliteness if you refused to join.    The games most commonly played in society are whist, loo,  _vingt-et-un_, and speculation.    Whist requires four players.[A] A pack of cards being spread upon the  table with their faces downwards, the four players draw for partners.  Those who draw the two highest cards and those who draw the two lowest  become partners. The lowest of all claims the deal.    Married people should not play at the same table, unless where the  party is so small that it cannot be avoided. This rule supposes  nothing so disgraceful to any married couple as dishonest collusion;  but persons who play regularly together cannot fail to know so much  of each other's mode of acting, under given circumstances, that  the chances no longer remain perfectly even in favour of their  adversaries.    Never play for higher stakes than you can afford to lose without  regret. Cards should be resorted to for amusement only; for  excitement, never.    No well-bred person ever loses temper at the card-table. You have no  right to sit down to the game unless you can bear a long run of ill  luck with perfect composure, and are prepared cheerfully to pass over  any blunders that your partner may chance to make.    If you are an indifferent player, make a point of saying so before  you join a party at whist. If the others are fine players they will  be infinitely more obliged to you for declining than accepting their  invitation. In any case you have no right to spoil their pleasure by  your bad play.    Never let even politeness induce you to play for very high stakes.  Etiquette is the minor morality of life; but it never should be  allowed to outweigh the higher code of right and wrong.    Be scrupulous to observe silence when any of the company are playing  or singing. Remember that they are doing this for the amusement"]]]
