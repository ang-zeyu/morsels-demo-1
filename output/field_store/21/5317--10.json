I had almost given her up; for I didn't believe that  old father of hers would let her come,\" cried Lucy, catching sight of  Glossy and her rider just entering the avenue; and she sprang up in  such haste as to upset half the men upon the board.    \"Hollo! see what you've done!\" exclaimed Harry. \"Why, it's Elsie, sure  enough!\" and he hastily followed in the wake of his sister, who had  already flown to meet and welcome her friend; while Herbert started up  to a sitting posture, and looked enviously after them.    \"Archie, John,\" he called, \"one of you please be good enough to hand  me my crutch and cane. Dear me, what a thing it is to be a cripple!\"    \"I'll get 'em, Herbie, this minute! Don't you try to step without  'em,\" said Archie, jumping up to hand them.    But Elsie had already alighted from her horse with Harry's assistance,  and shaken hands with him, returned Lucy's rapturous embrace as warmly  as it was given, and stepped upon the veranda with her before Herbert  was fairly upon his feet. As she caught sight of him she hurried  forward, her sweet face full of tender pity.    \"Oh, don't try to come to meet me, Herbert,\" she said, holding out her  little gloved hand; \"I know your poor limb is worse than usual, and  you, must not exert yourself for an old friend like me.\"    \"Ah,\" he said, taking the offered hand, and looking at its owner with  a glad light in his eyes, \"How like you that is, Elsie! You always  were more thoughtful of others than any one else I ever knew. Yes, my  limb is pretty bad just now; but the doctor thinks he'll conquer the  disease yet; at least so far as to relieve me of the pain I suffer.\"    \"I hope so, indeed. How patiently you have borne it all these long  years,\" she answered with earnest sympathy of tone and look.    \"So he has; he deserves the greatest amount of credit for it,\" said  Lucy, as John and Archie in turn claimed Elsie's attention for a  moment. \"But come now, let me take you to mamma and grandma, and then  to your own room. Aunt Chloe and your luggage will be along presently,  I suppose.\"    \"Yes, they are coming up the avenue now.\"    Lucy led the way to a large pleasant, airy apartment in one of the  wings of the building, where they found Mrs. Carrington busily  occupied in cutting out garments for her servants, her parents Mr. and  Mrs. Norris with her, the one reading a newspaper, the other knitting.  All three gave the young guest a very warm welcome. She was evidently  a great favorite with the whole family.    These greetings and the usual mutual inquiries in regard to the health  of friends and relatives having been exchanged, Elsie was next carried  off by Lucy to the room prepared for her special use during her stay  at Ashlands. It also was large, airy, and cheerful, on the second  floor--opening upon a veranda on one side, on the other into a similar  apartment occupied by Lucy herself. Pine India matting, furniture of  some kind of yellow grained wood, snowy counterpanes, curtains and  toilet covers gave them both an air of coolness and simple elegance,  while vases of fresh flowers upon the mantels shed around a slight but  delicious perfume.    Of course the two girls were full of lively, innocent chat. In the  midst of it Elsie exclaimed, \"Oh, Lucy! I have just the loveliest book  you ever read! a present from Mr. Travilla the other day, and I've  brought it along. Papa had begun it, but he is so kind he insisted I  should bring it with me; and so I did.\"    \"Oh, I'm glad! we haven't had anything new in the story-book line for  some time. Have you read it yourself?\"    \"Partly; but it is worth reading several times; and I thought we would  enjoy it all together--one reading aloud.\"    \"Oh, 'tis just the thing! I'm going to help mamma to-day with the  sewing, and a nice book read aloud will make it quite enjoyable. We'll  have you for reader, Elsie, if you are agreed.\"    \"Suppose we take turns sewing and reading? I'd like to help your  mamma, too.\"    \"Thank you; well, we'll see. Herbert's a good reader, and I daresay  will be glad to take his turn at it too. Ah, here comes your baggage  and Aunt Chloe following it. Here, Bob and Jack,\" to the two stalwart  black fellows who were carrying the trunk, \"set it in this corner. How  d'ye do, Aunt Chloe?\"    \"Berry well, tank you, missy,\" replied the old nurse, dropping a  courtesy. \"I'se berry glad to see you lookin' so bright dis here  mornin'.\"    \"Thank you. Now make yourself at home and take good care of your young  mistress.\"    \"Dat I will, missy; best I knows how. Trus' dis chile for dat.\"    Elsie's riding habit was quickly exchanged for a house dress, her  hair made smooth and shining as its wont, and securing her book she  returned with Lucy to the lower veranda, where they found Herbert  still extended upon his sofa.    His face brightened at sight of Elsie. He had laid aside his book, and  was at work with his knife upon a bit of soft pine wood. He whiled  away many a tedious hour by fashioning in this manner little boxes,  whistles, sets of baby-house furniture, etc., etc., for one and  another of his small friends. Books, magazines, and newspapers filled  up the larger portion of his time, but could not occupy it all, for,  as he said, he must digest his mental food, and he liked to have  employment for his fingers while doing so.    \"Please be good enough to sit where I can look at you without too  great an effort, won't you?\" he said, smiling up into Elsie's face.    \"Yes, if that will afford you any pleasure,\" she answered lightly, as  Lucy beckoned to a colored girl, who stepped forward and placed a low  rocking chair at the side of the couch.    \"There, that is just right. I can have a full view of your face by  merely raising my eyes,\" Herbert said with satisfaction, as Elsie  seated herself in it. \"What, you have brought a book?\"    \"Yes,\" and while Elsie went on to repeat the substance of what she  had told Lucy, the latter slipped away to her mamma's room to make  arrangements about the work, and ask if they would not all like to  come and listen to the reading.    \"Is it the kind of book to interest an old body like me?\" asked Mrs.  Norris.    \"I don't know, grandma; but Elsie says Mr. Travilla and her papa were  both delighted with it. Mr. Dinsmore, though, had not read the whole  of it.\"    \"Suppose we go and try it for a while then,\" said Mr. Morris, laying  down his paper. \"If our little Elsie is to be the reader, I for one am  pretty sure to enjoy listening, her voice is so sweet-toned and her  enunciation so clear and distinct.\"    \"That's you, grandpa!\" cried Lucy, clapping her hands in applause.  \"Yes, you'd better all come, Elsie is to be the reader at the start;  she says she does not mind beginning the story over again.\"    Mrs. Carrington began gathering up her work, laying the garments  already cut out in a large basket, which was then carried by her maid  to the veranda. In a few moments Elsie had quite an audience gathered  about her, ere long a deeply interested one; scissors or needle had  now and again to be dropped to wipe away a falling tear, and the voice  of the reader needed steadying more than once or twice. Then Herbert  took his turn at the book, Elsie hers with the needle, Mrs. Carrington  half reluctantly yielding to her urgent request to be allowed to  assist them.    So the morning, and much of the afternoon also, passed most  pleasantly, and not unprofitably either. A walk toward sundown, and  afterward a delightful moonlight ride with Harry Carrington and  Winthrop Lansing, the son of a neighboring planter, finished the  day, and Elsie retired to her own room at her usual early hour. Lucy  followed and kept her chatting quite a while, for which Elsie's tender  conscience reproached her somewhat; yet she was not long in falling  asleep after her head had once touched her pillow.    The next day was passed in a similar manner, still more time being  given to the reading, as they were able to begin it earlier: yet the  book was not finished; but on the morning of the next day, which was  Friday, Lucy proposed that, if the plan was agreeable to Elsie, they  should spend an hour or two in a new amusement; which was no other  than going into the dominions of Aunt Viney, the cook, and assisting  in beating eggs and making cake.    Elsie was charmed with the idea, and it was immediately carried out,  to the great astonishment of Chloe, Aunt Viney, and all her sable  tribe.    \"Sho, Miss Lucy! what fo' you go for to fotch de company right yere  into dis yere ole dirty kitchen?\" cried Aunt Viney, dropping a hasty  courtesy to Elsie, then hurrying hither and thither in the vain effort  to set everything to rights in a moment of time. \"Clar out o' yere,  you, Han an' Scip,\" she cried, addressing two small urchins of dusky  hue and driving them before her as she spoke, \"dere aint no room yere  fo' you, an' kitchens aint no place for darkies o' your size or sect.  I'll fling de dishcloth at yo' brack faces ef yo' comes in agin fo'  you sent for. I 'clare Miss Elsie, an' Miss Lucy, dose dirty niggahs  make sich a muss in yere, dere aint a char fit for you to set down  in,\" she continued, hastily cleaning two, and wiping them with her  apron. \"I'se glad to see you, ladies, but ef I'd knowed you was  a-comin' dis kitchen shu'd had a cleanin' up fo' shuah.\"    \"You see, Aunt Viney, you ought to keep it in order, and then you  would be ready for visitors whenever they happened to come,\" said Lucy  laughingly. \"Why, you're really quite out of breath with whisking  about so fast. We've come to help you.\"    The fat old negress, still panting from her unwonted exertions,  straightened herself, pushed back her turban, and gazed in round-eyed  wonder upon her young mistress.    \"What! Missy help ole Aunt Viney wid dose lily-white hands? Oh, go  'long! you's jokin' dis "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9966"],[0,"The Spartan Twins (#12)"],[1," around the hearth fire that night.  Lydia had prepared a wonderful feast to greet the travelers. There were  roast chicken, and sausages too, and goat's milk, and figs. They opened  the basket by fire-light, and if all the Christmases of your whole life  had been rolled into one, it couldn't have been more wonderful to you  than the gifts of Pericles were to Dion and Daphne. There was a soft robe  of scarlet for each of them, with golden clasps to fasten it. There were  a purse of gold coins and two beautiful parchment books--all written by  hand, for of course there were no printed books in those days. There were  gifts for their Father and Mother, too, and, best of all, a letter  written with Pericles' own hand and addressed to \"Euripides the Poet, of  Salamis.\" With it came a note to Melas, saying he might read the letter,  as he wished him to know its contents. This was the letter:--    \"Pericles the Archon to Euripides the Poet, Greetings.    \"The bearers of this letter are friends of mine who have rendered me a  great service. By their timely warning I was enabled to foil a plot to  make me appear to the public as an enemy of the Gods. As sufficient  recompense I commend them to your friendship. No greater service can be  rendered Athens than to raise up noble and patriotic defenders. To this  end I commit these children to your guidance, the girl no less than  the boy. Give them, I beg, the benefit of your wisdom, since they have  proven themselves worthy of such honor, and Athens shall one day thank  you for this service.\"    And so it was that Dion and Daphne, the Spartans, not only mastered the  learning of their time, but also became the friends of Pericles the  Athenian and of Euripides the Poet, and perhaps now wander with them in  the Elysian Fields.           *       *       *       *       *    A study period for the working out of the pronunciation of the more  difficult names and words will be the only preparation for reading _The  Spartan Twins_ needed by the average fifth grade class. The story can  usually be read at sight in the sixth grade.    It will admirably supplement the study of Greek History in these grades.  The essential thing is for the teacher to provide the proper background  for the story. The value in the history of the Greeks lies in the lessons  of bravery and of love of country that it brings us, and in the  inspiration and beauty of the myths, dramas, poems, and orations, the  statues and temples that survive to our time. The fundamental aim in its  study in the fifth and sixth grades is not so much to store the child's  mind with details as to make such impressions as will guide him to a  later appreciation of why we remember the Greeks, and what we have  learned from them.    In these days of a \"new internationalism,\" the teacher's most immediate  duty is to bring her pupils to a realization of what Americanism and  democracy mean, and that each is a development from the past. To do this,  she should explain that before there were immigrants, there were  discoverers and colonists, from Spain, England, and France; and that  these countries had their origin in colonies from Rome, herself a colony  from Greece. The teacher should explain that the spirit in these ancient  cities that inspired colonization, trade, and empire was the inherent and  ineradicable desire of men, first, for the opportunity of ruling  themselves, and then to establish bonds of union against foreign  aggression. Children will then perceive that the ancient Greeks were men  quite like ourselves; and that they began the ways of government which we  have, and which our forefathers brought to America. So much for what we  learned from the Greeks.    As to why we remember them, let the teacher recall the stories already  familiar through supplementary reading in literature, the Golden Fleece,  Hercules, the Siege of Troy, the Wanderings of Ulysses; let her point out  Greek cities which still exist, Athens, Marseilles, Alexandria,  Constantinople; let her tell the stories of Marathon, of Leonidas and  Thermopylae, and of Salamis; let her show pictures of Athens, the most  splendid city of ancient Greece, of the Acropolis, the Parthenon, the  Venus of Milo, the Hermes of Praxiteles, the Discus Thrower, and so on.    This book affords opportunity to contrast the way in which children were  brought up in Sparta with the way in which they were brought up in  Athens. The ideals of these two city-states also may be contrasted.  Although cities might have separate interests, it should be shown that  throughout Greece there were interests in common, of which the people  were reminded through the Olympic games.    The teacher is referred to the following volumes for further assistance  in re-creating the atmosphere of ancient Greece:--    Tappan's _The Story of the Greek People_, _Old World Hero Stories_, and  _Our European Ancestors_; Hawthorne's _Wonder-Book_ and _Tanglewood  Tales_; Peabody's _Old Creek Folk Stories_; Bryant's translation of the  _Odyssey_ and of the _Iliad_; Palmer's translation of the _Odyssey_;  Hopkinson's _Greek Leaders_; Plutarch's _Alexander the Great_; Marden's  _Greece and the AEgean Islands_; Hurll's _Greek Sculpture_ and _How to  Show Pictures to Children_; _Masterpieces of Greek Literature_.    Like all the other Volumes in the \"Twins Series,\" _The Spartan Twins_  furnishes ample subjects for dramatization. The unique illustrations  should be of assistance, and other illustrations in most of the books  referred to above also will help to show scenery, costumes, furniture,  and utensils.    The story will suggest many topics for class discussion, and in addition  such questions as the following will help the pupils to visualize the  Greece of the past:--    1. Why would ancient Greece have been a pleasant country to live in?    2. How would it affect your home town if it were shut off from all  others?    3. Judging from the Greek stories, what sort of men did they regard as  heroes? What sort of men do we regard as heroes to-day?    4. In the stories of gods and heroes, are there scenes that would make  good pictures?    5. Imagine you are Pericles, and make a speech telling the Athenians why  they ought to beautify their city.    6. What could be done to beautify the place in which you live?    7. Which one of the Greeks or their heroes do you regard as the greatest  man? Why?    8. What was good and what was not good in the training of the Spartan  boys?    9. In what respects was the training of the Athenian boys better?    10. How do the ideas of one child become known to other children? How  do the ideas of one country become known to other countries?    11. Had the Greeks good reasons for emigrating?    12. Imagine that you are an ancient Greek and tell why you became a  colonist."]]]
