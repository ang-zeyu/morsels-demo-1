I was root  Of that ill plant, whose shade such poison sheds  O'er all the Christian land, that seldom thence  Good fruit is gather'd.  Vengeance soon should come,  Had Ghent and Douay, Lille and Bruges power;  And vengeance I of heav'n's great Judge implore.  Hugh Capet was I high: from me descend  The Philips and the Louis, of whom France  Newly is govern'd; born of one, who ply'd  The slaughterer's trade at Paris.  When the race  Of ancient kings had vanish'd (all save one  Wrapt up in sable weeds) within my gripe  I found the reins of empire, and such powers  Of new acquirement, with full store of friends,  That soon the widow'd circlet of the crown  Was girt upon the temples of my son,  He, from whose bones th' anointed race begins.  Till the great dower of Provence had remov'd  The stains, that yet obscur'd our lowly blood,  Its sway indeed was narrow, but howe'er  It wrought no evil: there, with force and lies,  Began its rapine; after, for amends,  Poitou it seiz'd, Navarre and Gascony.  To Italy came Charles, and for amends  Young Conradine an innocent victim slew,  And sent th' angelic teacher back to heav'n,  Still for amends.  I see the time at hand,  That forth from France invites another Charles  To make himself and kindred better known.  Unarm'd he issues, saving with that lance,  Which the arch-traitor tilted with; and that  He carries with so home a thrust, as rives  The bowels of poor Florence.  No increase  Of territory hence, but sin and shame  Shall be his guerdon, and so much the more  As he more lightly deems of such foul wrong.  I see the other, who a prisoner late  Had steps on shore, exposing to the mart  His daughter, whom he bargains for, as do  The Corsairs for their slaves.  O avarice!  What canst thou more, who hast subdued our blood  So wholly to thyself, they feel no care  Of their own flesh?  To hide with direr guilt  Past ill and future, lo! the flower-de-luce  Enters Alagna! in his Vicar Christ  Himself a captive, and his mockery  Acted again!  Lo! to his holy lip  The vinegar and gall once more applied!  And he 'twixt living robbers doom'd to bleed!  Lo! the new Pilate, of whose cruelty  Such violence cannot fill the measure up,  With no degree to sanction, pushes on  Into the temple his yet eager sails!    \"O sovran Master! when shall I rejoice  To see the vengeance, which thy wrath well-pleas'd  In secret silence broods?--While daylight lasts,  So long what thou didst hear of her, sole spouse  Of the Great Spirit, and on which thou turn'dst  To me for comment, is the general theme  Of all our prayers: but when it darkens, then  A different strain we utter, then record  Pygmalion, whom his gluttonous thirst of gold  Made traitor, robber, parricide: the woes  Of Midas, which his greedy wish ensued,  Mark'd for derision to all future times:  And the fond Achan, how he stole the prey,  That yet he seems by Joshua's ire pursued.

So shook not Delos, when Latona there  Couch'd to bring forth the twin-born eyes of heaven.    Forthwith from every side a shout arose  So vehement, that suddenly my guide  Drew near, and cried: \"Doubt not, while I conduct thee.\"  \"Glory!\" all shouted (such the sounds mine ear  Gather'd from those, who near me swell'd the sounds)  \"Glory in the highest be to God.\"  We stood  Immovably suspended, like to those,  The shepherds, who first heard in Bethlehem's field  That song: till ceas'd the trembling, and the song  Was ended: then our hallow'd path resum'd,  Eying the prostrate shadows, who renew'd  Their custom'd mourning.  Never in my breast  Did ignorance so struggle with desire  Of knowledge, if my memory do not err,  As in that moment; nor through haste dar'd I  To question, nor myself could aught discern,  So on I far'd in thoughtfulness and dread.

When lo! even as Luke relates, that Christ  Appear'd unto the two upon their way,  New-risen from his vaulted grave; to us  A shade appear'd, and after us approach'd,  Contemplating the crowd beneath its feet.  We were not ware of it; so first it spake,  Saying, \"God give you peace, my brethren!\" then  Sudden we turn'd: and Virgil such salute,  As fitted that kind greeting, gave, and cried:  \"Peace in the blessed council be thy lot  Awarded by that righteous court, which me  To everlasting banishment exiles!\"    \"How!\" he exclaim'd, nor from his speed meanwhile  Desisting, \"If that ye be spirits, whom God  Vouchsafes not room above, who up the height  Has been thus far your guide?\"  To whom the bard:  \"If thou observe the tokens, which this man  Trac'd by the finger of the angel bears,  'Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just  He needs must share.

But, if thou know,  Instruct us for what cause, the mount erewhile  Thus shook and trembled: wherefore all at once  Seem'd shouting, even from his wave-wash'd foot.\"    That questioning so tallied with my wish,  The thirst did feel abatement of its edge  E'en from expectance.  He forthwith replied,  \"In its devotion nought irregular  This mount can witness, or by punctual rule  Unsanction'd; here from every change exempt.  Other than that, which heaven in itself  Doth of itself receive, no influence  Can reach us.

Purification by the will alone  Is prov'd, that free to change society  Seizes the soul rejoicing in her will.  Desire of bliss is present from the first;  But strong propension hinders, to that wish  By the just ordinance of heav'n oppos'd;  Propension now as eager to fulfil  Th' allotted torment, as erewhile to sin.

Therefore thou felt'st  The mountain tremble, and the spirits devout  Heard'st, over all his limits, utter praise  To that liege Lord, whom I entreat their joy  To hasten.\"  Thus he spake: and since the draught  Is grateful ever as the thirst is keen,  No words may speak my fullness of content.    \"Now,\" said the instructor sage, \"I see the net  That takes ye here, and how the toils are loos'd,  Why rocks the mountain and why ye rejoice.

While the Constitution apparently only deals with the practical and  essential details of government, yet underlying these simply but  wonderfully phrased delegations of power is a broad and accurate  political philosophy, which goes far to state the \"law and the  prophets\" of free government.    These essential principles of the Constitution may be briefly summarized  as follows:        1.      _The first is representative government_.    Nothing is more striking in the debates of the convention than the  distrust of its members, with few exceptions, of what they called  \"democracy.\" By this term they meant the power of the people to  legislate directly and without the intervention of chosen  representatives. They believed that the utmost concession that could be  safely made to democracy was the power to select suitable men to  legislate for the common good, and nothing is more striking in the  Constitution than the care with which they sought to remove the powers  of legislation from the _direct_ action of the people. Nowhere in the  instrument is there a suggestion of the initiative or referendum.    Even an amendment to the Constitution could not be directly proposed by  the people in the exercise of their residual power or adopted by them.  As previously said, it could only be proposed by two-thirds of the House  and the Senate, and then could only become effective, if ratified by  three-fourths of the States, acting, not by a popular vote, but through  their chosen representatives either in their legislatures or special  conventions. Thus they denied the power of a majority to alter even the  form of government. Moreover, they gave to the President the power to  nullify laws passed by a majority of the House and Senate by his simple  veto, and yet, fearful of an unqualified power of the President in this  respect, they provided that the veto itself should be vetoed, if  two-thirds of the Senate and House concurred in such action. Moreover,  the great limitations of the Constitution, which forbid the majority, or  even the whole body of the House and Senate, to pass laws either for  want of authority or because they impair fundamental rights of  individuals, are as emphatic a negation of an absolute democracy as can  be found in any form of government.    Measured by present-day conventions of democracy, the Constitution is an  undemocratic document. The framers believed in representative  government, to which they gave the name \"Republicanism\" as the  antithesis to \"democracy.\" The members of the Senate were to be selected  by State legislatures, and the President himself was, as originally  planned, to be selected by an electoral college similar to the College  of Cardinals.    The debates are full of utterances which explain this attitude of mind.  Mr. Gerry said: \"The evils we experience flow from the excesses of  democracy. The people are the dupes of pretended patriots.\" Mr.  Randolph, the author of the Virginia plan, observed that the general  object of the Constitution was to provide a cure for the evils under  which the United States laboured; that in tracing these evils to their  origin every man had found it in the tribulation and follies of  democracy; that some check, therefore, was to be sought for against this  tendency of our Government.    Alexander Hamilton remarked, on June 18, that--        \"the members most tenacious of republicanism were as loud as any in      declaiming against the evils of democracy.\"    He added:        \"Give all the power to the many and they will oppress the few. Give      all the power to the few and they will oppress the many. Both ought,      therefore, to have the power that each may defend itself against the      other.\"    Perhaps the attitude of the members is thus best expressed by James  Madison, in the 10th of the Federalist papers:        \"A pure democracy, by which I mean a State consisting of a small      number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in      person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. Such      democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention,      and have often been found incompatible with the personal security      and rights of property, and have generally been as short in their      lives as they have been violent in their deaths.\"    Undoubtedly, the framers of the Constitution in thus limiting popular  rule did not take sufficient account of the genius of an  English-speaking people. A few of their number recognized this.  Franklin, a self-made man, believed in democracy and doubted the  efficacy of the Constitution unless it was, like a pyramid, broad-based  upon the will of the people.    Colonel Mason, of Virginia, who was also of the Jeffersonian school of  political philosophy, said:        \"Notwithstanding the oppression and injustice experienced among us      from democracy, the genius of the people is in favour of it, and the      genius of the people must be consulted.\"    In this they were true prophets, for the American people have refused to  limit democracy as narrowly and rigidly as the framers of the  Constitution clearly intended. The most notable illustration of this is  the selection of the President. It was never contemplated that the  people should directly select the President, but that a chosen body of  electors should, with careful deliberation, make this momentous choice.  While, in form, the system persists to this day, from the very beginning  the electors simply vote as the people who select them desire. It should  here be noted that Thomas Jefferson, the great Democrat and draftsman of  the Declaration of Independence, was not a member of the convention.  During its sessions he was in France. He was instrumental in securing  the first ten Amendments and the subsequent adaptation of the  Constitution to meet the democratic instincts of the American people is  largely due to his great leadership.    Moreover, the spirit of representative government has greatly changed  since the Constitution was adopted. The ideal of the earlier time was  that so nobly expressed by Edmund Burke in his address to the electors  of Bristol, for the framers believed that a representative held a  judicial position of the most sacred character, and that he should vote  as his judgment and conscience dictated without respect to the wishes of  his constituents. To-day, and notably in the last half century, the  contrary belief, due largely to Jefferson's political ideals, has so  influenced American politics that the representatives of the people,  either in the legislature or the executive departments of the  government, are considered by the masses as only the mouthpieces of the  people who select them, and to ignore their wishes is regarded as  virtually a betrayal of a trust and the negation of democracy.    For this change in attitude there has been much justification, for in my  country, as elsewhere, the people do not always select their best men as  representatives, and, with the imperfections of human nature, there has  been so much of ignorance and, at times, venality, that the instinct of  the people is to take the conduct of affairs into their own hands. On  the other hand, this change of attitude has led, in many instances, to  government by organized minorities, for, with the division of the masses  into political parties, it is easy for an organized minority to hold the  balance of power, and thus impress its will upon majorities. Time may  yet vindicate the theory of the framers that the limit of democracy is  the selection of true and tried representatives.        2.      _The second and most novel principle of the Constitution is its dual  form of Government._    This did constitute a unique contribution to the science of politics.  This was early recognized by de Tocqueville, one of the most acute  students of the Constitution, who said that it was based \"upon a wholly,  novel theory, which may be considered a great discovery in modern  political science.\"    Previous to the Constitution it had not been thought possible to divide  sovereignty, or at least to have two different sovereignties moving as  planets in the same orbit. Therefore, all previous federated governments  had been based upon the plan that a league could only effect its will  through the constituent States and that the citizens in these States  owed no direct allegiance to the league, but only to the States of which  they were members. The Constitution, however, developed the idea of a  dual citizenship. While the people remained citizens of their respective  States in the sphere of government which was reserved to the States, yet  they directly became citizens of the central government, and, as such,  ceased to be citizens of the several States in the sphere of government  delegated to the central power; and this allegiance was enforced by the  direct action of the central government on the citizens as individuals.  Thus has been developed one of the most intricately complex governmental  systems in the world.    At the time of the adoption of the Constitution this division of  jurisdiction was quite feasible, for, geographically, the various States  were widely separated, and the lack of economic contact made it easy for  each government to function without serious conflict. The framers,  however, did not sufficiently reckon with the mechanical changes in  society that were then beginning. They did not anticipate, and could not  have anticipated, the centripetal influences of steam and electricity  which have woven the American people into an indissoluble unit for  commercial and many other purposes. As a result many laws of the Federal  Government, in their incidences in this complex age, directly impinge  upon rights of the "]]]
