[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10163"],[0,"Mohammedanism (#13)"],[1,"the Middle Ages had no political significance,  although they had intimate relations with the Zaidites of Southern Arabia.  As first Egypt and afterwards Turkey made their protectorate over the holy  cities more effective, the princes of Mecca became orthodox.    The Zaidites, who settled in Yemen from the ninth century on, are really  Shi'ites, although of the most moderate kind. Without striving after  expansion outside Arabia, they firmly refuse to give up their own Khalifate  and to acknowledge the sovereignty of any non-Alid ruler; the efforts of  the Turks to subdue them or to make a compromise with them have had no  lasting results. This is the principal obstacle against their being  included in the orthodox community, although their admission is defended,  even under present circumstances, by many non-political Moslim scholars.  The Zaidites are the remnant of the original Arabian Shi'ah, which for  centuries has counted adherents in all parts of the Moslim world, and some  of whose tenets have penetrated Mohammedan orthodoxy. The almost general  veneration of the sayyids and sherifs, as the descendants of Mohammed are  entitled, is due to this influence.    The Shi'ah outside Arabia, whose adherents used to be persecuted by the  official authorities, not without good cause, became the receptacle of all  the revolutionary and heterodox ideas maintained by the converted peoples.  Alongside of the _visible_ political history of Islam of the first  centuries, these circles built up their evolution of the _unseen_  community, the only true one, guided by the Holy Family, and the reality  was to them a continuous denial of the postulates of religion. Their first  _imam_ or successor of the Prophet was Ali, whose divine right had been  unjustly denied by the three usurpers, Abu Bakr, Omar, and Othman, and who  had exercised actual authority for a few years in constant strife with  Kharijites and Omayyads. The efforts of his legitimate successors to assert  their authority were constantly drowned in blood; until, at last, there  were no more candidates for the dangerous office. This prosaic fact was  converted by the adherents of the House of Mohammed into the romance,  that the last _imam_ of a line of _seven_ according to some, and _twelve_  according to others, had disappeared in a mysterious way, to return at the  end of days as Mahdi, the Guided One, who should restore the political  order which had been disturbed ever since Mohammed's death. Until his  reappearance there is nothing left for the community to do but to await  his advent, under the guidance of their secular rulers (e.g., the shahs of  Persia) and enlightened by their authoritative scholars (_mujtahids_), who  explain faith and law to them from the tradition of the Sacred Family.  The great majority of Mohammedans, as they do not accept this legitimist  theory, are counted by the Shi'ah outside Arabia as unclean heretics, if  not as unbelievers.    At the beginning of the fifteenth century this Shi'ah found its political  centre in Persia, and opposed itself fanatically to the Sultan of Turkey,  who at about the same time came to stand at the head of orthodox Islam.  All differences of doctrine were now sharpened and embittered by political  passion, and the efforts of single enlightened princes or scholars to  induce the various peoples to extend to each other, across the political  barriers, the hand of brotherhood in the principles of faith, all failed.  It is only in the last few years that the general political distress of  Islam has inclined the estranged relatives towards reconciliation.    Besides the veneration of the Alids, orthodox Islam has adopted another  Shiitic element, the expectation of the Mahdi, which we have just  mentioned. Most Sunnites expect that at the end of the world there will  come from the House of Mohammed a successor to him, guided by Allah, who  will maintain the revealed law as faithfully as the first four khalifs did  according to the idealized history, and who will succeed with God's help in  making Islam victorious over the whole world. That the chiliastic kingdom  of the Mahdi must in the end be destroyed by Anti-Christ, in order that  Jesus may be able once more to re-establish the holy order before the  Resurrection, was a necessary consequence of the amalgamation of the  political expectations formed under Shi'itic influence, with eschatological  conceptions formerly borrowed by Islam from Christianity.    The orthodox Mahdi differs from that of the Shi'ah in many ways. He is not  an _imam_ returning after centuries of disappearance, but a descendant of  Mohammed, coming into the world in the ordinary way to fulfill the ideal of  the Khalifate. He does not re-establish the legitimate line of successors  of the Prophet; but he renews the glorious tradition of the Khalifate,  which after the first thirty years was dragged into the general  deterioration, common to all human things. The prophecies concerning his  appearance are sometimes of an equally supernatural kind as those of the  Shiites, so that the period of his coming has passed more and more  from the political sphere to which it originally belonged, into that of  eschatology. Yet, naturally, it is easier for a popular leader to make  himself regarded as the orthodox Mahdi than to play the part of the  returned _imam_. Mohammedan rulers have had more trouble than they cared  for with candidates for the dignity of the Mahdi; and it is not surprising  that in official Turkish circles there is a tendency to simplify the  Messianic expectation by giving the fullest weight to this traditional  saying of Mohammed \"There is no mahdi but Jesus,\" seeing that Jesus must  come from the clouds, whereas other mahdis may arise from human society.    In the orthodox expectation of the Mahdi the Moslim theory has most sharply  expressed its condemnation of the later political history of Islam. In the  course of the first century after the Hijrah the Qoran scholars (_garis_)  arose; and these in turn were succeeded by the men of tradition (_ahl  al-hadith_) and by the canonists (_faqihs_) of later times. These learned  men (_ulama'_) would not endure any interference with their right to state  with authority what Islam demanded of its leaders. They laid claim to an  interpretative authority concerning the divine law, which bordered upon  supreme legislative power; their agreement (Ijma') was that of the  infallible community. But just as beside this legislative agreement, a  dogmatic and a mystic agreement grew up, in the same way there was a  separate Ijma' regarding the political government, upon which the canonists  could exercise only an indirect influence. In other words since the  accession of the Omayyad khalifs, the actual authority rested in the hands  of dynasties, and under the Abbasids government assumed even a despotic  character. This relation between the governors and governed, originally  alien to Islam, was not changed by the transference of the actual power  into the hands of _wezirs_ and officers of the bodyguard; nor yet by  the disintegration of the empire into a number of small despotisms, the  investiture of which by the khalif became a mere formality. Dynastic and  political questions were settled in a comparatively small circle, by court  intrigue, stratagems, and force; and the canonists, like the people, were  bound to accept the results. Politically inclined interpreters of the law  might try to justify their compulsory assent to the facts by theories about  the Ijma' of the notables residing in the capital, who took the urgent  decisions about the succession, which decisions were subsequently confirmed  by general homage to the new prince; but they had no illusions about the  real influence of the community upon the choice of its leader. The most  independent scholars made no attempt to disguise the fact that the course  which political affairs had taken was the clearest proof of the moral  degeneration which had set in, and they pronounced an equally bold and  merciless criticism upon the government in all its departments. It became  a matter of course that a pious scholar must keep himself free from all  intercourse with state officials, on pain of losing his reputation.    The bridge across the gulf that separated the spiritual from the temporal  authorities was formed by those state officials who, for the practice  of their office, needed a knowledge of the divine law, especially the  _qadhis_. It was originally the duty of these judges to decide all legal  differences between Mohammedans, or men of other creeds under Mohammedan  protection, who called for their decision. The actual division between the  rulers and the interpreters of the law caused an ever-increasing limitation  of the authority of the _qadhis_. The laws of marriage, family, and  inheritance remained, however, their inalienable territory; and a number  of other matters, in which too great a religious interest was involved to  leave them to the caprice of the governors or to the customary law outside  Islam, were usually included. But as the _qadhis_ were appointed by the  governors, they were obliged in the exercise of their office to give due  consideration to the wishes of their constituents; and moreover they were  often tainted by what was regarded in Mohammedan countries as inseparable  from government employment: bribery.    On this account, the canonists, although it was from their ranks that the  officials of the _qadhi_ court were to be drawn, considered no words too  strong to express their contempt for the office of _qadhi_. In handbooks  of the Law of all times, the _qadhis \"of our time\"_ are represented as  unscrupulous beings, whose unreliable judgments were chiefly dictated by  their greed. Such an opinion would not have acquired full force, if it  had not been ascribed to Mohammed; in fact, the Prophet, according to a  tradition, had said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10166"],[0,"What Germany Thinks; Or, The War as Germans see it (#13)"],[1,"unwell and  remained sitting, an indiscretion which he truthfully says \"nearly cost  him his life.\" Three skull wounds several inches long, his body beaten  black and blue, and ruined clothes, was the punishment for not joining  in with the \"hurrah-patriots.\"    Dozens of similar instances might be cited, but for the sake of  impartiality it is preferable to allow a German to generalize: \"The rage  of the populace has found vent not only against foreigners, but also  against good German patriots, indeed even against German officers.\"[33]    [Footnote 33: _Leipziger Volkszeitung_, August 12th.]    Probably one of the most glaring instances of German indifference to  brutality is afforded by the following incident. A commercial traveller  named Luederitz, aged twenty-three, murdered his sweetheart in a Leipzig  hotel by strangling her with his necktie. He alleged that he had killed  the girl at her wish, and the judge sentenced him to three years, six  months' imprisonment--not even penal servitude! The report  concludes[34]: \"As the accused has been called up to serve in the army,  he was allowed to go free for the present.\" Which means that if he  survives the war he may be called upon to undergo his sentence.    [Footnote 34: Ibid., August 28th.]    A South German newspaper[35] advised \"German wives and maidens to avoid  wearing striking costumes, dresses and hats. Such restrictions are not  only desirable in the serious time through which our dear Fatherland is  passing, but such precautions are urgently necessary in the interests of  personal safety. For amidst the excitement which has unfortunately taken  possession of our people, ladies are not safe, either from insult or  assault, in spite of the fact that the police do their best to protect  them.\"    [Footnote 35: _Muenchen-Augsburger Abendzeitung_, August 5th.]    These are the bare facts, in a very limited selection, as regards German  brutality towards Germans. In the light of these events the question  suggests itself: How did foreigners fare in the midst of this  _Kulturvolk_? The answer is simple and expressive: \"Not half has ever  been told;\" yet the German newspapers contain more than sufficient  materials to prove that the floodgates of barbarism were opened wide.    When martial law was proclaimed the Berlin Government caused official  announcements to be issued throughout the whole country, requesting the  public to assist in preventing tunnels, bridges, railways, etc., from  being destroyed by foreign agents and spies. The whole country at once  became a detective office of madmen!    Ample proof is at hand to show that this lashing of the public mind into  brutal fury was the calculated work of the German authorities. \"We are  now absolutely dependent upon reports issued by the authorities; we do  not know whether they are correct or whether they are merely intended to  inflame public opinion. Thus reports have been officially circulated of  Russian patrols crossing our frontiers, and from Nuremberg of French  airmen dropping bombs on the railways in that neighbourhood, whereupon  diplomatic relations with both countries were broken off.\"[36]    [Footnote 36: _Leipziger Volkszeitung_, August 3rd.]    The whole Press, with the exception of at least some Social Democratic  organs, joined in a chorus of hatred and suspicion against Russians  residing in Germany. In bitterness towards the Russian State the  Socialist journals were solid in their hostility, but the author has  only discovered expressions of abhorrence in their columns concerning  the ill-treatment, even murder, of innocent foreigners in Germany. This  fact must be recorded to their honour.    \"Certain circles of Leipzig's population are at present possessed by  patriotic delirium and at the same time by a spy-mania which luxuriates  like tropical vegetation. In reality, love of Fatherland is something  quite other than those feelings which find expression in the present  noisy and disgusting scenes. These mob patriots must remember that in  their mad attacks on 'Serbs' and 'Russians'--that is to say, everybody  who has black hair and a beard, whom they at once conclude must belong  to those nations--they are endangering the lives of hundreds of  thousands of Germans in France and Russia.\"[37]    [Footnote 37: Ibid., August 4th.]    On the following day the same journal contained another detailed report:  \"In spite of official appeals to the public to display self-possession  in these serious times, the nationalist mob continues to behave in the  most scandalous manner, both in the streets and public restaurants, etc.  The wildest outbreaks of brutal passions occur, and no one with black  hair and dark complexion is secure from outbursts of rage on the part of  the fanatics. Shortly before 5 p.m. yesterday a gentleman in the uniform  of a German artillery officer was sitting with a lady in the Cafe  Felsche; apparently somebody 'denounced' him for a Russian officer in  disguise. The police accompanied by army officers arrested and led him  into the street, where they were received by a yelling crowd. The  enraged mob forced its way past the guards and beat the 'spy' with  sticks, umbrellas, etc., till streams of blood ran down his face, his  uniform being torn to shreds. The officers and police guarding him drew  their weapons, but were unable to protect him from further brutal  treatment; indeed, it was with the greatest difficulty that they  succeeded in bringing him to a place of safety.\"[38]    [Footnote 38: The unfortunate suspect was in truth a German officer.]    On the last page of the same edition there is an advertisement which  helps to explain why the appeals for cool blood were useless.      \"APPEAL!\"      \"Among the foreigners in our country, especially Russians, there are a    large number who, it is to be feared, are guilty of espionage and    attempts to disturb our mobilization. While the Russians engaged in    work on our farms may be allowed to continue their work in peace, it    is necessary to watch carefully those who are studying here, or are    permanent residents.      \"I call upon the inhabitants to take part in the task of observation,    and when strong suspicion is aroused to see to it that the suspects    are arrested and handed over to the civil authorities.      \"The protection of our railway lines and stations, telegraph wires,    etc., demands the most careful attention during the next few days.                  \"VON LAFFERT,                \"General in Command.    \"Leipzig, August 4th.\"    An interesting contrast to the above is a police order, issued by the  Director of the Stuttgart police.[39]    [Footnote 39: _Leipziger Neuesten Nachrichten_, August 9th.]      \"Policemen! The populace is going absolutely mad. The streets are    crowded with old women of both sexes who have nothing else to do but    disgrace themselves. Each sees in his neighbour a Russian or French    spy, and imagines that it is his duty to thrash both him _and_ the    policeman who intervenes, till the blood flows; if not that, then at    least to cause an enormous crowd to gather in giving the alleged spy    over to the police. Clouds become hostile airmen, stars are mistaken    for airships and the cross-bars of bicycles are thought to be bombs;    bridges have been blown up, telegraph and telephone wires cut in the    middle of Stuttgart; spies have been shot and water supplies poisoned!    It is impossible to imagine what will happen when serious events    really come.      \"It has been proved that up till now there has not been the slightest    reason for all this alarm; but yet, judging by appearances, we are    living in a huge lunatic asylum. Everyone, if he is not a coward or a    dangerous idler, should be quietly doing his duty, for the times are    already serious enough.      \"Policemen! continue to keep your heads cool. Be men as you were    formerly, and not women. Do not allow yourselves to be frightened at    straws; keep your eyes open and do your duty!      \"BILLINGER,      \"Director of Police.      \"Stuttgart.\"    It is not surprising that this humorous police commander expressed his  indignation in the forceful Swabian manner. Here are a few telegrams  which had been sent to Berlin from Stuttgart, or still more probable,  manufactured by the official Press Bureau in Berlin.    \"A considerable number of Russians and French--including several  women--have been arrested in Stuttgart to-day under the suspicion of  practising espionage. One of these arrests was made in the top-floor of  the Central Post Office, where the apparatus connected with the  telegraph office are to be found.    \"More arrests are about to be made in the environs. It has been  established that numerous attempts have been made during the last few  days to blow up the railway bridges. In Freudenstadt a gypsy's wagon was  seized which contained a quantity of explosives.\"[40]    [Footnote 40: _Berliner Tageblatt_, August 3rd.]    \"Some of our contemporaries (Oh, shade of Pecksniff!--Author) announced  yesterday that in Stuttgart eighty, according to other reports, ninety  millions in French gold had been seized. In answer to our inquiry at the  principal office of the Wuertemberg State Railways we were informed that  the statements are pure inventions.\"[41]    [Footnote 41: _Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger_, August 4th.]    Another Socialist paper which denounced this campaign of lies in its  columns deserves quotation. \"The spy-mania luxuriates; every Russian is  in danger of assault by over-heated patriots. The nation, however, ought  to know that the Russians in our midst are labourers, students,  travellers and business men; it is exceeding rare for one of this class,  to sell himself to the scoundrels who follow the dirty practices of  espionage.    \"Civilization and good-breeding demand that everyone should respect the  dictates of international law, and treat the peaceful citizens "]]]
