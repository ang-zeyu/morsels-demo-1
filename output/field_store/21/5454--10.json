Their life was ordered  by the ringing of the bell to start certain activities, such as  prayer; meals; meetings; work in the fields, gardens, or  workshops; and copying and illuminating books. They chanted to pay  homage and to communicate with God or his saints. They taught  justice, piety, chastity, peace, and charity; and cared for the  sick. Caring for the sick entailed mostly praying to God as it was  thought that only God could cure. They bathed a few times a year.  They got their drinking water from upstream of where they had  located their latrines over running water. The large monasteries  had libraries, dormitories, guesthouses, kitchens, butteries to  store wine, bakehouses, breweries, dairies, granaries, barns,  fishponds, orchards, vineyards, gardens, workshops, laundries,  lavatories with long stone or marble washing troughs, and towels.  Slavery was diminished by the church by excommunication for the  sale of a child over seven. The clergy taught that manumission of  slaves was good for the soul of the dead, so it became frequent in  wills. The clergy were to abstain from red meat and wine and were  to be celibate. But there were periods of laxity. Punishment was  by the cane or scourge.    The Archbishop of Canterbury began anointing new kings at the time  of coronation to emphasize that the king was ruler by the grace of  God. As God's minister, the king could only do right. From 973,  the new king swore to protect the Christian church, to prevent  inequities to all subjects, and to render good justice, which  became a standard oath.    There was a celestial hierarchy, with heavenly hosts in specific  places. The heavenly bodies revolved in circles around the  earthly world on crystal spheres of their own, which were serene,  harmonious, and eternal. This contrasted with the change, death,  and decay that occurred in the earthly world. Also in this world,  Aristotle's four elements of earth, air, fire, and water sought  their natural places, e.g. bubbles of air rising through water.  The planets were called wanderers because their motion did not  fit the circular scheme.    God intervened in daily life, especially if worshipped. Saints  such as Bede and Hilda performed miracles, especially ones of  curing. Their spirits could be contacted through their relics,  which rested at the altars of churches. When someone was said to  have the devil in him, people took it quite literally. A real Jack  Frost nipped noses and fingers and made the ground too hard to  work. Little people, elves, trolls, and fairies inhabited the  fears and imaginings of people. The forest was the mysterious home  of spirits. People prayed to God to help them in their troubles  and from the work of the devil. Since natural causes of events  were unknown, people attributed events to wills like their own.  Illness was thought to be caused by demons. People hung charms  around their neck for cure and treatments of magic and herbs were  given. Some had hallucinogenic effects, which were probably useful  for pain. For instance, the remedy for \"mental vacancy and folly\"  was a drink of \"fennel, agrimony, cockle, and marche\". Blood-  letting by leeches and cautery were used for most maladies, which  were thought to be caused by imbalance of the four bodily humors:  sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic. These four humors  reflected the four basic elements air, water, fire, and earth.  Blood was hot and moist like air; phlegm was cold and moist like  water; choler or yellow bile was hot and dry like fire; and  melancholy or black bile was cold and dry like earth. Bede had  explained that when blood predominates, it makes people joyful,  glad, sociable, laughing, and talking a great deal. Phlegm renders  them slow, sleepy, and forgetful. Red cholic makes them thin,  though eating much, swift, bold, wrathful, and agile. Black cholic  makes them serious of settled disposition, even sad. To relieve  brain pressure and/or maybe to exorcise evil spirits, holes were  made in skulls by a drill with a metal tip that was caused to turn  back and forth by a strap wrapped around a wooden handle. A king's  daughter Edith inspired a cult of holy wells, whose waters were  thought to alleviate eye conditions. Warmth and rest were also  used for illness. Agrimony boiled in milk was thought to relieve  impotence in men.    It was known that the liver casted out impurities in the blood.  The stages of fetal growth were known. The soul was not thought to  enter a fetus until after the third month, so presumably abortions  within three months were allowable.    The days of the week were Sun day, Moon day, Tiw's day (Viking god  of war), Woden's day (Viking god of victory, master magician,  calmer of storms, and raiser of the dead), Thor's day (Viking god  of thunder), Frig's day (Viking goddess of fertility and growing  things), and Saturn's day (Roman god). Special days of the year  were celebrated: Christmas, the birthday of Jesus Christ; the  twelve days of Yuletide (a Viking tradition) when candles were lit  and houses decorated with evergreen and there were festivities  around the burning of the biggest log available; Plough Monday for  resumption of work after Yuletide; February 14th with a feast  celebrating Saint Valentinus, a Roman bishop martyr who had  married young lovers in secret when marriage was forbidden to  encourage men to fight in war; New Year's Day on March 25th when  seed was sown and people banged on drums and blew horns to banish  spirits who destroy crops with disease; Easter, the day of the  resurrection of Jesus Christ; Whitsunday, celebrating the descent  of the Holy Spirit on the apostles of Jesus and named for the  white worn by baptismal candidates; May Day when flowers and  greenery was gathered from the woods to decorate houses and  churches, Morris dancers leapt through their villages with bells,  hobby horses, and waving scarves, and people danced around a May  pole holding colorful ribbons tied at the top so they became  entwined around the pole; Lammas on August 1st, when the first  bread baked from the wheat harvest was consecrated; Harvest Home  when the last harvest load was brought home while an effigy of a  goddess was carried with reapers singing and piping behind, and  October 31st, the eve of the Christian designated All Hallow Day,  which then became known as All Hallow Even, or Halloween. People  dressed as demons, hobgoblins, and witches to keep spirits away  from possessing them. Trick or treating began with Christian  beggars asking for \"soul cake\" biscuits in return for praying for  dead relatives. Ticktacktoe and backgammon were played. There were  riddles such as:        I am a strange creature, for I satisfy women ...      I grow very tall, erect in a bed.      I'm hairy underneath. From time to time      A beautiful girl, the brave daughter      Of some fellow dares to hold me      Grips my reddish skin, robs me of my head      And puts me in the pantry. At once that girl      With plaited hair who has confined me      Remembers our meeting. Her eye moistens.      What am I?      An onion.        A man came walking where he knew      She stood in a corner, stepped forwards;      The bold fellow plucked up his own      Skirt by hand, stuck something stiff      Beneath her belt as she stood,      Worked his will. They both wiggled.      The man hurried; his trusty helper      Plied a handy task, but tired      At length, less strong than she,      Weary of the work. Thick beneath      Her belt swelled the thing good men      Praise with their hearts and purses.      What am I?      A milk churn.    The languages of invaders had produced a hybrid language that was  roughly understood throughout the country. The existence of  Europe, Africa, Asia, and India were known. Jerusalem was thought  to be at the center of the world. There was an annual tax of a  penny on every hearth, Peter's pence, to be collected and sent to  the pope in Rome. Ecclesiastical benefices were to pay church-  scot, a payment in lieu of first fruits of the land, to the pope.                                      - The Law -    The king and witan deliberated on the making of new laws, both  secular and spiritual, at the regularly held witanagemot. There  was a standard legal requirement of holding every man accountable,  though expressed in different ways, such as the following three:    Every freeman who does not hold land must find a lord to answer  for him. The act of homage was symbolized by holding his hands  together between those of his lord. Every lord shall be personally  responsible as surety for the men of his household. [This included  female lords.] (King Athelstan)    \"And every man shall see that he has a surety, and this surety  shall bring and keep him to [the performance of] every lawful  duty.    1.  And if anyone does wrong and escapes, his surety shall incur      what the other should have incurred.    2.  If the case be that of a thief and his surety can lay hold of      him within twelve months, he shall deliver him up to justice,      and what he has paid shall be returned to him.\" (King Edgar)    Every freeman who holds land, except lords with considerable  landed property, must be in a local tithing, usually ten to twelve  men, in which they serve as personal sureties for each other's  peaceful behavior. If one of the ten landholders in a tithing is  accused of an offense, the others have to produce him in court or  pay a fine plus pay the injured party for the offense, unless they  could prove that they had no complicity in it. If the man is found  guilty but can not pay, his tithing must pay his fine. The chief  officer is the \"tithing man\" or \"capital pledge\". There were  probably ten tithings in a hundred. (King Edward the Confessor).    Everyone was to take an oath not to steal, which one's surety  would compel one to keep.

This is one of the oldest forms of Yogi  breathing, and is quite important and valuable, and is well worthy of  acquirement. But it is quite amusing to the Yogis to know that to the  Western world this method is often held out as being the \"whole  secret\" of Yogi Breathing. To the minds of many Western readers, \"Yogi  Breathing\" suggests nothing more than a picture of a Hindu, sitting  erect, and alternating nostrils in the act of breathing. \"Only this  and nothing more.\" We trust that this little work will open the eyes  of the Western world to the great possibilities of Yogi Breathing, and  the numerous methods whereby it may be employed.    (11) THE GRAND YOGI PSYCHIC BREATH.    The Yogis have a favorite form of psychic breathing which they  practice occasionally, to which has been given a Sanscrit term of  which the above is a general equivalent. We have given it last, as it  requires practice on the part of the student in the line of rhythmic  breathing and mental imagery, which he has now acquired by means of  the preceding exercises. The general principles of the Grand Breath  may be summed up in the old Hindu saying: \"Blessed is the Yogi who can  breathe through his bones.\" This exercise will fill the entire system  with prana, and the student will emerge from it with every bone,  muscle, nerve, cell, tissue, organ and part energized and attuned by  the prana and the rhythm of the breath. It is a general housecleaning  of the system, and he who practices it carefully will feel as if he  had been given a new body, freshly created, from the crown of his head  to the tips of his toes. We will let the exercise speak for itself.         (1) Lie in a relaxed position, at perfect ease.         (2) Breathe rhythmically until the rhythm is perfectly       established.         (3) Then, inhaling and exhaling, form the mental image of       the breath being drawn up through the bones of the legs, and       then forced out through them; then through the bones of the       arms; then through the top of the skull; then through the       stomach; then through the reproductive region; then as if it       were traveling upward and downward along the spinal column;       and then as if the breath were being inhaled and exhaled       through every pore of the skin, the whole body being filled       with prana and life.         (4) Then (breathing rhythmically) send the current of prana       to the Seven Vital Centers, in turn, as follows, using the       mental picture as in previous exercises:              (a) To the forehead.              (b) To the back of the head.              (c) To the base of the brain.              (d) To the Solar Plexus.              (e) To the Sacral Region (lower part of the spine).              (f) To the region of the navel.              (g) To the reproductive region.         Finish by sweeping the current of prana, to and fro from       head to feet several times.         (5) Finish with Cleansing Breath.          CHAPTER XVI.      YOGI SPIRITUAL BREATHING.    The Yogis not only bring about desired mental qualities and properties  by will-power coupled with rhythmic breathing, but they also develop  spiritual faculties, or rather aid in their unfoldment, in the same  way. The Oriental philosophies teach that man has many faculties which  are at present in a dormant state, but which will become unfolded as  the race progresses. They also teach that man, by the proper effort of  the will, aided by favorable conditions, may aid in the unfoldment of  these spiritual faculties, and develop them much sooner than in the  ordinary process of evolution. In other words, one may even now  develop spiritual powers of consciousness which will not become the  common property of the race until after long ages of gradual  development under the law of evolution. In all of the exercises  directed toward this end, rhythmic breathing plays an important part.  There is of course no mystic property in the breath itself which  produces such wonderful results, but the rhythm produced by the Yogi  breath is such as to bring the whole system, including the brain,  under perfect control, and in perfect harmony, and by this means, the  most perfect condition is obtained for the unfoldment of these latent  faculties.    In this work we cannot go deeply into the philosophy of the East  regarding spiritual development, because this subject would require  volumes to cover it, and then again the subject is too abstruse to  interest the average reader. There are also other reasons, well known  to occultists, why this knowledge should not be spread broadcast at  this time. Rest assured, dear student, that when the time comes for  you to take the next step, the way will be opened out before you.  \"When the chela (student) is ready, the guru (master) appears.\" In  this chapter we will give you directions for the development of two  phases of spiritual consciousness, i.e., (1) the consciousness of the  identity of the Soul, and (2) the consciousness of the connection of  the Soul with the Universal Life. Both of the exercises given below  are simple, and consist of mental images firmly held, accompanied with  rhythmic breathing. The student must not expect too much at the start,  but must make haste slowly, and be content to develop as does the  flower, from seed to blossom.      SOUL CONSCIOUSNESS.    The real Self is not the body or even the mind of man. These things  are but a part of his personality, the lesser self. The real Self is  the Ego, whose manifestation is in individuality. The real Self is  independent of the body, which it inhabits, and is even independent of  the mechanism of the mind, which it uses as an instrument. The real  Self is a drop from the Divine Ocean, and is eternal and  indestructible. It cannot die or be annihilated, and no matter what  becomes of the body, the real Self still exists. It is the Soul. Do  not think of your Soul as a thing apart from you, for YOU are the  Soul, and the body is the unreal and transitory part of you which is  changing in material every day, and which you will some day discard.  You may develop the faculties so that they will be conscious of the  reality of the Soul, and its independence of the body. The Yogi plan  for such development is by meditation upon the real Self or Soul,  accompanied by rhythmic breathing. The following exercise is the  simplest form.    EXERCISE.--Place your body in a relaxed, reclining position. Breathe  rhythmically, and meditate upon the real Self, thinking of yourself as  an entity independent of the body, although inhabiting it and being  able to leave it at will. Think of yourself, not as the body, but as a  spirit, and of your body as but a shell, useful and comfortable, but  not a part of the real You. Think of yourself as an independent being,  using the body only as a convenience. While meditating, ignore the  body entirely, and you will find that you will often become almost  entirely unconscious of it, and will seem to be out of the body to  which you may return when you are through with the exercise.    This is the gist of the Yogi meditative breathing methods, and if  persisted in will give one a wonderful sense of the reality of the  Soul, and will make him seem almost independent of the body. The sense  of immortality will often come with this increased consciousness, and  the person will begin to show signs of spiritual development which  will be noticeable to himself and others. But he must not allow  himself to live too much in the upper regions, or to despise his body,  for he is here on this plane for a purpose, and he must not neglect  his opportunity to gain the experiences necessary to round him out,  nor must he fail to respect his body, which is the Temple of the  Spirit.      THE UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS.    The Spirit in man, which is the highest manifestation of his Soul, is  a drop in the ocean of Spirit, apparently separate and distinct, but  yet really in touch with the ocean itself, and with every other drop  in it. As man unfolds in spiritual consciousness he becomes more and  more aware of his relation to the Universal Spirit, or Universal Mind  as some term it. He feels at times as if he were almost at-one-ment  with it, and then again he loses the sense of contact and  relationship. The Yogis seek to attain this state of Universal  Consciousness by meditation and rhythmic breathing, and many have thus  attained the highest degree of spiritual attainment possible to man in  this stage of his existence. The student of this work will not need  the higher instruction regarding adeptship at this time, as he has  much to do and accomplish before he reaches that stage, but it may be  well to initiate him into the elementary stages of the Yogi exercises  for developing Universal Consciousness, and if he is in earnest he  will discover means and methods whereby he may progress. The way is  always opened to him who is ready to tread the path. The following  exercise will be found to do much toward developing the Universal  Consciousness in those who faithfully practice it.    EXERCISE.--Place your body in a reclining, relaxed position. Breathe  rhythmically, and meditate upon your relationship with the Universal  Mind of which you are but an atom. Think of yourself as being in touch  with All, and at-one-ment with All. See All as One, and your Soul as a  part of that One. Feel that you are receiving the vibrations from the  great Universal Mind, and are partaking of its power and strength and  wisdom. The two following lines of meditation may be followed.    (a) With each inhalation, think of yourself as drawing in to yourself  the strength and power of the Universal Mind. When exhaling think of  yourself as passing out to others that same power, at the same time  being filled with love for every living thing, and desiring that it be  a partaker of the same"]]]
