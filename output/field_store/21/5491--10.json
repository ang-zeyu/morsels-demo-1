The young man boldly said, \"I will conceal nothing from you, for you  seem more like a king than Amulius. You hear and judge before you  punish, but he gives men up to be punished without a trial. Formerly we  (for we are twins) understood that we were the sons of Faustulus and  Laurentia, the king's servants; but now that we are brought before you  as culprits, and are falsely accused and in danger of our lives, we have  heard great things about ourselves. Whether they be true or not, we must  now put to the test. Our birth is said to be a secret, and our nursing  and bringing up is yet stranger, for we were cast out to the beasts and  the birds, and were fed by them, suckled by a she-wolf, and fed with  morsels of food by a woodpecker as we lay in our cradle beside the great  river. Our cradle still exists, carefully preserved, bound with brazen  bands, on which is an indistinct inscription, which hereafter will serve  as a means by which we may be recognised by our parents, but to no  purpose if we are dead.\" Numitor, considering the young man's story, and  reckoning up the time from his apparent age, willingly embraced the hope  which was dawning on his mind, and considered how he might obtain a  secret interview with his daughter and tell her of all this; for she was  still kept a close prisoner.    VIII. Faustulus, when he heard of Remus being captured and delivered up  to Numitor, called upon Romulus to help him, and told him plainly all  about his birth; although previously he had hinted so much, that any one  who paid attention to his words might have known nearly all about it;  and he himself with the cradle ran to Numitor full of hopes and fears,  now that matters had come to a critical point. He was viewed with  suspicion by the guards at the king's gate, and while they were treating  him contemptuously, and confusing him by questions, they espied the  cradle under his cloak. Now it chanced that one of them had been one of  those who had taken the children to cast them away, and had been present  when they were abandoned. This man, seeing the cradle and recognising it  by its make and the inscription on it, suspected the truth, and at once  told the king and brought the man in to be examined. Faustulus, in those  dire straits, did not altogether remain unshaken, and yet did not quite  allow his secret to be wrung from him. He admitted that the boys were  alive, but said that they were living far away from Alba, and that he  himself was bringing the cradle to Ilia, who had often longed to see and  touch it to confirm her belief in the life of her children. Now Amulius  did what men generally do when excited by fear or rage. He sent in a  great hurry one who was a good man and a friend of Numitor, bidding him  ask Numitor whether he had heard anything about the survival of the  children. This man on arrival, finding Numitor all but embracing Remus,  confirmed his belief that he was his grandson, and bade him take his  measures quickly, remaining by him himself to offer assistance. Even had  they wished it, there was no time for delay; for Romulus was already  near, and no small number of the citizens, through hatred and fear of  Amulius, were going out to join him. He himself brought no small force,  arrayed in companies of a hundred each. Each of these was led by a man  who carried a bundle of sticks and straw upon a pole. The Latins called  these _manipla_; and from this these companies are even at the present  day called _maniples_ in the Roman army. Now as Remus raised a revolt  within, while Romulus assailed the palace without, the despot was  captured and put to death without having been able to do anything, or  take any measures for his own safety.    The greater part of the above story is told by Fabius Pictor and Diokles  of Peparethos, who seem to have been the first historians of the  foundation of Rome. The story is doubted by many on account of its  theatrical and artificial form, yet we ought not to disbelieve it when  we consider what wondrous works are wrought by chance, and when, too, we  reflect on the Roman Empire, which, had it not had a divine origin,  never could have arrived at its present extent.    IX. After the death of Amulius, and the reorganisation of the kingdom,  the twins, who would not live in Alba as subjects, and did not wish to  reign there during the life of their grandfather, gave up the sovereign  power to him, and, having made a suitable provision for their mother,  determined to dwell by themselves, and to found a city in the parts in  which they themselves had been reared; at least, this is the most  probable of the various reasons which are given. It may also have been  necessary, as many slaves and fugitives had gathered round them, either  that they should disperse these men and so lose their entire power, or  else go and dwell alone amongst them. It is clear, from the rape of the  Sabine women, that the citizens of Alba would not admit these outcasts  into their own body, since that deed was caused, not by wanton  insolence, but by necessity, as they could not obtain wives by fair  means; for after carrying the women off they treated them with the  greatest respect. Afterwards, when the city was once founded, they made  it a sanctuary for people in distress to take refuge in, saying that it  belonged to the god Asylus; and they received in it all sorts of  persons, not giving up slaves to their masters, debtors to their  creditors, or murderers to their judges, but saying that, in accordance  with a Pythian oracle, the sanctuary was free to all; so that the city  soon became full of men, for they say that at first it contained no less  than a thousand hearths. Of this more hereafter. When they were  proceeding to found the city, they at once quarrelled about its site.  Romulus fixed upon what is now called Roma Quadrata, a square piece of  ground, and wished the city to be built in that place; but Remus  preferred a strong position on Mount Aventino, which, in memory of him,  was called the Remonium, and now is called Rignarium.    They agreed to decide their dispute by watching the flight of birds, and  having taken their seats apart, it is said that six vultures appeared to  Remus, and afterwards twice as many to Romulus. Some say that Remus  really saw his vultures, but that Romulus only pretended to have seen  them, and when Remus came to him, then the twelve appeared to Romulus;  for which reason the Romans at the present day draw their auguries  especially from vultures. Herodorus of Pontus says that Hercules  delighted in the sight of a vulture, when about to do any great action.  It is the most harmless of all creatures, for it injures neither crops,  fruit, nor cattle, and lives entirely upon dead corpses. It does not  kill or injure anything that has life, and even abstains from dead birds  from its relationship to them. Now eagles, and owls, and falcons, peck  and kill other birds, in spite of Aeschylus's line,        \"Bird-eating bird polluted e'er must be.\"    Moreover, the other birds are, so to speak, ever before our eyes, and  continually remind us of their presence; but the vulture is seldom seen,  and it is difficult to meet with its young, which has suggested to some  persons the strange idea that vultures come from some other world to pay  us their rare visits, which are like those occurrences which, according  to the soothsayers, do not happen naturally or spontaneously, but by the  interposition of Heaven.    X. When Remus discovered the deceit he was very angry, and, while  Romulus was digging a trench round where the city wall was to be built,  he jeered at the works, and hindered them. At last, as he jumped over  it, he was struck dead either by Romulus himself, or by Celer, one of  his companions. In this fight, Faustulus was slain, and also Pleistinus,  who is said to have been Faustulus's brother and to have helped him in  rearing Romulus and his brother. Celer retired into Tyrrhenia, and from  him the Romans call quick sharp men _Celeres_; Quintus Metellus, who,  when his father died, in a very few days exhibited a show of gladiators,  was surnamed Celer by the Romans in their wonder at the short time he  had spent in his preparations.    XI. Romulus, after burying Remus and his foster-parents in the Remurium,  consecrated his city, having fetched men from Etruria, who taught him  how to perform it according to sacred rites and ceremonies, as though  they were celebrating holy mysteries. A trench was dug in a circle round  what is now the Comitium, and into it were flung first-fruits of all  those things which are honourable and necessary for men. Finally each  man brought a little of the earth of the country from which he came, and  flung it into one heap and mixed it all together. They call this pit by  the same name as the heavens, _Mundus_. Next, they drew the outline of  the city in the form of a circle, with this place as its centre. And  then the founder, having fitted a plough with a brazen ploughshare, and  yoked to it a bull and a cow, himself ploughs a deep furrow round the  boundaries. It is the duty of his attendants to throw the clods inwards,  which the plough turns up, and to let none of them fall outwards. By  this line they define the extent of the fortifications, and it is called  by contraction, Pomoerium, which means behind the walls or beyond the  walls (_post moenia_). Wherever they intend to place a gate they take  off the ploughshare, and carry the plough over, leaving a space. After  this ceremony they consider the entire wall sacred, except"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14056"],[0,"The French Impressionists (1860-1900) (#13)"],[1," of the men of the soil, which have made Millet's  noble glory. At the time when, about 1885, the neo-Impressionists whom  we shall study later on invented the Pointillist method, M. Pissarro  tried it and applied it judiciously, with the patient, serious and  slightly anxious talent, by which he is distinguished. Recently, in a  series of pictures representing views of Paris (the boulevards and the  Avenue de l'Opera) M. Pissarro has shewn rare vision and skill and has  perhaps signed his most beautiful and personal paintings. The  perspective, the lighting, the tones of the houses and of the crowds,  the reflections of rain or sunshine are intensely true; they make one  feel the atmosphere, the charm and the soul of Paris. One can say of  Pissarro that he lacks none of the gifts of his profession. He is a  learned, fruitful and upright artist. But he has lacked originality; he  always recalls those whom he admires and whose ideas he applies boldly  and tastefully. It is probable that his conscientious nature has  contributed not little towards keeping him in the second rank.  Incapable, certainly, of voluntarily imitating, this excellent and  diligent painter has not had the sparks of genius of his friends, but  all that can be given to a man through conscientious study, striving  after truth and love of art, has been acquired by M. Pissarro. The rest  depended on destiny only. There is no character more worthy of respect  and no effort more meritorious than his, and there can be no better  proof of his disinterestedness and his modesty, than the fact that,  although he has thirty years of work behind him, an honoured name and  white hair, M. Pissarro did not hesitate to adopt, quite frankly, the  technique of the young Pointillist painters, his juniors, because it  appeared to him better than his own. He is, if not a great painter, at  least one of the most interesting rustic landscape painters of our  epoch. His visions of the country are quite his own, and are a  harmonious mixture of Classicism and Impressionism which will secure one  of the most honourable places to his work.    [Illustration: PISSARRO    RUE DE L'EPICERIE, ROUEN]    [Illustration: PISSARRO    BOULEVARDE MONTMARTRE]    [Illustration: PISSARRO    THE BOILDIEAUX BRIDGE AT ROUEN]    [Illustration: PISSARO    THE AVENUE DE L'OPERA]    There has, perhaps, been more original individuality in the landscape  painter Alfred Sisley. He possessed in the highest degree the feeling  for light, and if he did not have the power, the masterly passion of  Claude Monet, he will at least deserve to be frequently placed by his  side as regards the expression of certain combinations of light. He did  not have the decorative feeling which makes Monet's landscapes so  imposing; one does not see in his work that surprising lyrical  interpretation which knows how to express the drama of the raging waves,  the heavy slumber of enormous masses of rock, the intense torpor of the  sun on the sea. But in all that concerns the mild aspects of the _Ile de  France_, the sweet and fresh landscapes, Sisley is not unworthy of being  compared with Monet. He equals him in numerous pictures; he has a  similar delicacy of perception, a similar fervour of execution. He is  the painter of great, blue rivers curving towards the horizon; of  blossoming orchards; of bright hills with red-roofed hamlets scattered  about; he is, beyond all, the painter of French skies which he presents  with admirable vivacity and facility. He has the feeling for the  transparency of atmosphere, and if his technique allies him directly  with Impressionism, one can well feel, that he painted spontaneously and  that this technique happened to be adapted to his nature, without his  having attempted to appropriate it for the sake of novelty. Sisley has  painted a notable series of pictures in the quaint village of Moret on  the outskirts of the Forest of Fontainebleau, where he died at a ripe  age, and these canvases will figure among the most charming landscapes  of our epoch. Sisley was a veteran of Impressionism. At the Exhibition  of 1900, in the two rooms reserved for the works of this school, there  were to be seen a dozen of Sisley's canvases. By the side of the finest  Renoirs, Monets and Manets they kept their charm and their brilliancy  with a singular flavour, and this was for many critics a revelation as  to the real place of this artist, whom they had hitherto considered as a  pretty colourist of only relative importance.    [Illustration: SISLEY    SNOW EFFECT]    [Illustration: SISLEY    BOUGIVAL, AT THE WATER'S EDGE]    [Illustration: SISLEY    BRIDGE AT MORET]    Paul Cezanne, unknown to the public, is appreciated by a small group of  art lovers. He is an artist who lives in Provence, away from the world;  he is supposed to have served as model for the Impressionist painter  Claude Lantier, described by Zola in his celebrated novel \"L'Oeuvre.\"  Cezanne has painted landscapes, rustic scenes and still-life pictures.  His figures are clumsy and brutal and inharmonious in colour, but his  landscapes have the merit of a robust simplicity of vision. These  pictures are almost primitive, and they are loved by the young  Impressionists because of their exclusion of all \"cleverness.\" A charm  of rude simplicity and sincerity can be found in these works in which  Cezanne employs only just the means which are indispensable for his end.  His still-life pictures are particularly interesting owing to the  spotless brilliancy of their colours, the straightforwardness of the  tones, and the originality of certain shades analogous to those of old  faience. Cezanne is a conscientious painter without skill, intensely  absorbed in rendering what he sees, and his strong and tenacious  attention has sometimes succeeded in finding beauty. He reminds more of  an ancient Gothic craftsman, than of a modern artist, and he is full of  repose as a contrast to the dazzling virtuosity of so many painters.    [Illustration: CEZANNE    DESSERT]    Berthe Morisot will remain the most fascinating figure of  Impressionism,--the one who has stated most precisely the femineity of  this luminous and iridescent art. Having married Eugene Manet, the  brother of the great painter, she exhibited at various private  galleries, where the works of the first Impressionists were to be  seen, and became as famous for her talent as for her beauty. When Manet  died, she took charge of his memory and of his work, and she helped with  all her energetic intelligence to procure them their just and final  estimation. Mme. Eugene Manet has certainly been one of the most  beautiful types of French women of the end of the nineteenth century.  When she died prematurely at the age of fifty (in 1895), she left a  considerable amount of work: gardens, young girls, water-colours of  refined taste, of surprising energy, and of a colouring as  distinguished, as it is unexpected. As great grand-daughter of  Fragonard, Berthe Morisot (since we ought to leave her the name with  which her respect for Manet's great name made her always sign her works)  seemed to have inherited from her famous ancestor his French  gracefulness, his spirited elegance, and all his other great qualities.  She has also felt the influence of Corot, of Manet and of Renoir. All  her work is bathed in brightness, in azure, in sunlight; it is a woman's  work, but it has a strength, a freedom of touch and an originality,  which one would hardly have expected. Her water-colours, particularly,  belong to a superior art: some notes of colour suffice to indicate sky,  sea, or a forest background, and everything shows a sure and masterly  fancy, for which our time can offer no analogy. A series of Berthe  Morisot's works looks like a veritable bouquet whose brilliancy is due  less to the colour-schemes which are comparatively soft, grey and blue,  than to the absolute correctness of the values. A hundred canvases, and  perhaps three hundred water-colours attest this talent of the first  rank. Normandy coast scenes with pearly skies and turquoise horizons,  sparkling Nice gardens, fruit-laden orchards, girls in white dresses  with big flower-decked hats, young women in ball-dress, and flowers are  the favourite themes of this artist who was the friend of Renoir, of  Degas and of Mallarme.    [Illustration: BERTHE MORISOT    MELANCHOLY]    [Illustration: BERTHE MORISOT    YOUNG WOMAN SEATED]    Miss Mary Cassatt will deserve a place by her side. American by birth,  she became French through her assiduous participation in the exhibitions  of the Impressionists. She is one of the very few painters whom Degas  has advised, with Forain and M. Ernest Rouart. (This latter, a painter  himself, a son of the painter and wealthy collector Henri Rouart, has  married Mme. Manet's daughter who is also an artist.) Miss Cassatt has  made a speciality of studying children, and she is, perhaps, the artist  of this period who has understood and expressed them with the greatest  originality. She is a pastellist of note, and some of her pastels are as  good as Manet's and Degas's, so far as broad execution and brilliancy  and delicacy of tones are concerned. Ten years ago Miss Cassatt  exhibited a series of ten etchings in colour, representing scenes of  mothers and children at their toilet. At that time this _genre_ was  almost abandoned, and Miss Cassatt caused astonishment by her boldness  which faced the most serious difficulties. One can relish in this  artist's pictures, besides the great qualities of solid draughtsmanship,  correct values, and skilful interpretation of flesh and stuffs, a  profound sentiment of infantile life, childish gestures, clear and  unconscious looks, and the loving expression of the mothers. Miss  Cassatt is the painter and psychologist of babies and young mothers whom  she likes to depict in the freshness of an orchard, or against  backgrounds of the flowered hangings of"]]]
