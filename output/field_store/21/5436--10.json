Your female \"help,\" too, dearly  loves a good tall pile to work at and, as a rule, her notions of the  centre of gravity are not accurate, leading often to a general  downfall, and the damage of many a corner. Again, if not supervised and  instructed, she is very apt to rub the dust into, instead of off, the  edges. Each volume should be held tightly, so as to prevent the leaves  from gaping, and then wiped from the back to the fore-edge. A soft brush  will be found useful if there is much dust. The whole exterior should  also be rubbed with a soft cloth, and then the covers should be opened  and the hinges of the binding examined; for mildew WILL assert itself  both inside and outside certain books, and that most pertinaciously. It  has unaccountable likes and dislikes. Some bindings seem positively to  invite damp, and mildew will attack these when no other books on the  same shelf show any signs of it. When discovered, carefully wipe it  away, and then let the book remain a few days standing open, in the  driest and airiest spot you can select. Great care should be taken not  to let grit, such as blows in at the open window from many a dusty road,  be upon your duster, or you will probably find fine scratches, like an  outline map of Europe, all over your smooth calf, by which your heart  and eye, as well as your book, will be wounded.    \"Helps\" are very apt to fill the shelves too tightly, so that to extract  a book you have to use force, often to the injury of the top-bands.  Beware of this mistake. It frequently occurs through not noticing that  one small book is purposely placed at each end of the shelf, beneath the  movable shelf-supports, thus not only saving space, but preventing the  injury which a book shelf-high would be sure to receive from uneven  pressure.    After all, the best guide in these, as in many other matters, is \"common  sense,\" a quality which in olden times must have been much more \"common\"  than in these days, else the phrase would never have become rooted in  our common tongue.    Children, with all their innocence, are often guilty of book-murder. I  must confess to having once taken down \"Humphrey's History of Writing,\"  which contains many brightly-coloured plates, to amuse a sick daughter.  The object was certainly gained, but the consequences of so bad a  precedent were disastrous. That copy (which, I am glad to say, was  easily re-placed), notwithstanding great care on my part, became soiled  and torn, and at last was given up to Nursery martyrdom. Can I regret  it? surely not, for, although bibliographically sinful, who can weigh  the amount of real pleasure received, and actual pain ignored, by the  patient in the contemplation of those beautifully-blended colours?    A neighbour of mine some few years ago suffered severely from a  propensity, apparently irresistible, in one of his daughters to tear his  library books. She was six years old, and would go quietly to a shelf  and take down a book or two, and having torn a dozen leaves or so down  the middle, would replace the volumes, fragments and all, in their  places, the damage being undiscovered until the books were wanted for  use. Reprimand, expostulation and even punishment were of no avail; but  a single \"whipping\" effected a cure.    Boys, however, are by far more destructive than girls, and have,  naturally, no reverence for age, whether in man or books. Who does not  fear a schoolboy with his first pocket-knife? As Wordsworth did not  say:--                  \"You may trace him oft       By scars which his activity has left       Upon our shelves and volumes. * * *       He who with pocket-knife will cut the edge       Of luckless panel or of prominent book,       Detaching with a stroke a label here, a back-band there.\"                               _Excursion III, 83_.    Pleased, too, are they, if, with mouths full of candy, and sticky  fingers, they can pull in and out the books on your bottom shelves,  little knowing the damage and pain they will cause. One would fain cry  out, calling on the Shade of Horace to pardon the false quantity--         \"Magna movet stomacho fastidia, si puer unctis       Tractavit volumen manibus.\"  _Sat. IV_.      What boys CAN do may be gathered from the following true story, sent me  by a correspondent who was the immediate sufferer:--    One summer day he met in town an acquaintance who for many years had  been abroad; and finding his appetite for old books as keen as ever,  invited him home to have a mental feed upon \"fifteeners\" and other  bibliographical dainties, preliminary to the coarser pleasures enjoyed  at the dinner-table. The \"home\" was an old mansion in the outskirts  of London, whose very architecture was suggestive of black-letter and  sheep-skin. The weather, alas! was rainy, and, as they approached the  house, loud peals of laughter reached their ears. The children were  keeping a birthday with a few young friends. The damp forbad all outdoor  play, and, having been left too much to their own devices, they had  invaded the library. It was just after the Battle of Balaclava, and the  heroism of the combatants on that hard-fought field was in everybody's  mouth. So the mischievous young imps divided themselves into two  opposing camps--Britons and Russians. The Russian division was just  inside the door, behind ramparts formed of old folios and quartos taken  from the bottom shelves and piled to the height of about four feet.  It was a wall of old fathers, fifteenth century chronicles, county  histories, Chaucer, Lydgate, and such like. Some few yards off were the  Britishers, provided with heaps of small books as missiles, with which  they kept up a skirmishing cannonade against the foe. Imagine the  tableau! Two elderly gentlemen enter hurriedly, paterfamilias receiving,  quite unintentionally, the first edition of \"Paradise Lost\" in the  pit of his stomach, his friend narrowly escaping a closer personal  acquaintance with a quarto Hamlet than he had ever had before. Finale:  great outburst of wrath, and rapid retreat of the combatants, many  wounded (volumes) being left on the field.        POSTSCRIPTUM.    ALTHOUGH, strictly speaking, the following anecdote does not illustrate  any form of real injury to books, it is so racy, and in these days of  extravagant biddings so tantalizing, that I must step just outside the  strict line of pertinence in order to place it on record, It was sent  to me, as a personal experience, by my friend, Mr. George Clulow,  a well-known bibliophile, and \"Xylographer\" to \"Ye Sette of ye Odde  Volumes.\" The date is 1881. He writes:--    \"_Apropos_ of the Gainsborough 'find,' of which you tell in 'The Enemies  of Books,' I should like to narrate an experience of my own, of some  twenty years ago:    \"Late one evening, at my father's house, I saw a catalogue of a sale of  furniture, farm implements and books, which was announced to take place  on the following morning at a country rectory in Derbyshire, some four  miles from the nearest railway station.    \"It was summer time--the country at its best--and with the attraction  of an old book, I decided on a day's holiday, and eight o'clock the next  morning found me in the train for C----, and after a variation in  my programme, caused by my having walked three miles west before I  discovered that my destination was three miles east of the railway  station, I arrived at the rectory at noon, and found assembled some  thirty or forty of the neighbouring farmers, their wives, men-servants  and maid-servants, all seemingly bent on a day's idling, rather than  business. The sale was announced for noon, but it was an hour later  before the auctioneer put in an appearance, and the first operation in  which he took part, and in which he invited my assistance, was to make  a hearty meal of bread and cheese and beer in the rectory kitchen. This  over, the business of the day began by a sundry collection of pots,  pans, and kettles being brought to the competition of the public,  followed by some lots of bedding, etc. The catalogue gave books as the  first part of the sale, and, as three o'clock was reached, my patience  was gone, and I protested to the auctioneer against his not selling in  accordance with his catalogue. To this he replied that there was not  time enough, and that he would sell the books to-morrow! This was too  much for me, and I suggested that he had broken faith with the buyers,  and had brought me to C---- on a false pretence. This, however, did not  seem to disturb his good humour, or to make him unhappy, and his answer  was to call 'Bill,' who was acting as porter, and to tell him to give  the gentleman the key of the 'book room,' and to bring down any of the  books he might pick out, and he 'would sell 'em.' I followed 'Bill,' and  soon found myself in a charming nook of a library, full of books,  mostly old divinity, but with a large number of the best miscellaneous  literature of the sixteenth century, English and foreign. A very short  look over the shelves produced some thirty Black Letter books, three or  four illuminated missals, and some book rarities of a more recent date.  'Bill' took them downstairs, and I wondered what would happen! I was  not long in doubt, for book by book, and in lots of two and three, my  selection was knocked down in rapid succession, at prices varying from  1_s_. 6_d_. to 3_s_. 6_d_., this latter sum seeming to be the utmost  limit to the speculative turn of my competitors. The _bonne bouche_ of  the lot was, however, kept back by the auctioneer, because, as he said,  it was 'a pretty book,' and I began to respect his critical judgment,  for 'a pretty book' it was, being a large paper copy of Dibdin's  Bibliographical Decameron, three volumes, in the original binding.  Suffice it to say that, including "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13029"],[0,"The Art of the Moving Picture (#13)"],[1,"of Sidney Carton or Faust's Marguerite or the like.    All this, to make sharper the fact that the murder of Becket the  archbishop is a climax. The great Church and hierarchy are profaned. The  audience feels the same thrill of horror that went through Christendom.  We understand why miracles were wrought at the martyr's tomb.    In the motion pictures the entrance of a child into the world is a mere  family episode, not a climax, when it is the history of private people.  For instance, several little strangers come into the story of Enoch  Arden. They add beauty, and are links in the chain of events. Still they  are only one of many elements of idyllic charm in the village of Annie.  Something that in real life is less valuable than a child is the goal of  each tiny tableau, some coming or departure or the like that affects the  total plot. But let us imagine a production that would chronicle the  promise to Abraham, and the vision that came with it. Let the film show  the final gift of Isaac to the aged Sarah, even the boy who is the  beginning of a race that shall be as the stars of heaven and the sands of  the sea for multitude. This could be made a pageant of power and glory.  The crowd-emotions, patriotic fires, and religious exaltations on which  it turns could be given in noble procession and the tiny fellow on the  pillow made the mystic centre of the whole. The story of the coming of  Samuel, the dedicated little prophet, might be told on similar terms.    The real death in the photoplay is the ritualistic death, the real birth  is the ritualistic birth, and the cathedral mood of the motion picture  which goes with these and is close to these in many of its phases, is an  inexhaustible resource.    The film corporations fear religious questions, lest offence be given to  this sect or that. So let such denominations as are in the habit of  cooperating, themselves take over this medium, not gingerly, but  whole-heartedly, as in mediaeval time the hierarchy strengthened its hold  on the people with the marvels of Romanesque and Gothic architecture.  This matter is further discussed in the seventeenth chapter, entitled  \"Progress and Endowment.\"    But there is a field wherein the commercial man will not be accused of  heresy or sacrilege, which builds on ritualistic birth and death and  elements akin thereto. This the established producer may enter without  fear. Which brings us to The Battle Hymn of the Republic, issued by the  American Vitagraph Company in 1911. This film should be studied in the  High Schools and Universities till the canons of art for which it stands  are established in America. The director was Larry Trimble. All honor to  him.    The patriotism of The Battle Hymn of the Republic, if taken literally,  deals with certain aspects of the Civil War. But the picture is  transfigured by so marked a devotion, that it is the main illustration in  this work of the religious photoplay.    The beginning shows President Lincoln in the White House brooding over  the lack of response to his last call for troops. (He is impersonated by  Ralph Ince.) He and Julia Ward Howe are looking out of the window on a  recruiting headquarters that is not busy. (Mrs. Howe is impersonated by  Julia S. Gordon.) Another scene shows an old mother in the West refusing  to let her son enlist. (This woman is impersonated by Mrs. Maurice.) The  father has died in the war. The sword hangs on the wall. Later Julia Ward  Howe is shown in her room asleep at midnight, then rising in a trance and  writing the Battle Hymn at a table by the bed.    The pictures that might possibly have passed before her mind during the  trance are thrown upon the screen. The phrases they illustrate are not in  the final order of the poem, but in the possible sequence in which they  went on the paper in the first sketch. The dream panorama is not a  literal discussion of abolitionism or states' rights. It illustrates  rather the Hebraic exultation applied to all lands and times. \"Mine eyes  have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord\"; a gracious picture of the  nativity. (Edith Storey impersonates Mary the Virgin.) \"I have seen him  in the watchfires of a hundred circling camps\" and \"They have builded him  an altar in the evening dews and damps\"--for these are given symbolic  pageants of the Holy Sepulchre crusaders.    Then there is a visible parable, showing a marketplace in some wicked  capital, neither Babylon, Tyre, nor Nineveh, but all of them in essential  character. First come spectacles of rejoicing, cruelty, and waste. Then  from Heaven descend flood and fire, brimstone and lightning. It is like  the judgment of the Cities of the Plain. Just before the overthrow, the  line is projected upon the screen: \"He hath loosed the fateful lightning  of his terrible swift sword.\" Then the heavenly host becomes gradually  visible upon the air, marching toward the audience, almost crossing the  footlights, and blowing their solemn trumpets. With this picture the line  is given us to read: \"Our God is marching on.\" This host appears in the  photoplay as often as the refrain sweeps into the poem. The celestial  company, its imperceptible emergence, its spiritual power when in the  ascendant, is a thing never to be forgotten, a tableau that proves the  motion picture a great religious instrument.    Then comes a procession indeed. It is as though the audience were  standing at the side of the throne at Doomsday looking down the hill of  Zion toward the little earth. There is a line of those who are to be  judged, leaders from the beginning of history, barbarians with their  crude weapons, classic characters, Caesar and his rivals for fame;  mediaeval figures including Dante meditating; later figures, Richelieu,  Napoleon. Many people march toward the strange glorifying eye of the  camera, growing larger than men, filling the entire field of vision,  disappearing when they are almost upon us. The audience weighs the worth  of their work to the world as the men themselves with downcast eyes seem  to be doing also. The most thrilling figure is Tolstoi in his peasant  smock, coming after the bitter egotists and conquerors. (The  impersonation is by Edward Thomas.) I shall never forget that presence  marching up to the throne invisible with bowed head. This procession is  to illustrate the line: \"He is sifting out the hearts of men before his  Judgment Seat.\" Later Lincoln is pictured on the steps of the White  House. It is a quaint tableau, in the spirit of the old-fashioned Rogers  group. Yet it is masterful for all that. Lincoln is taking the chains  from a cowering slave. This tableau is to illustrate the line: \"Let the  hero born of woman crush the serpent with his heel.\" Now it is the end of  the series of visions. It is morning in Mrs. Howe's room. She rises. She  is filled with wonder to find the poem on her table.    Written to the rousing glory-tune of John Brown's Body the song goes over  the North like wildfire. The far-off home of the widow is shown. She and  the boy read the famous chant in the morning news column. She takes the  old sword from the wall. She gives it to her son and sends him to enlist  with her blessing. In the next picture Lincoln and Mrs. Howe are looking  out of the window where was once the idle recruiting tent. A new army is  pouring by, singing the words that have rallied the nation. Ritualistic  birth and death have been discussed. This film might be said to  illustrate ritualistic birth, death, and resurrection.    The writer has seen hundreds of productions since this one. He has  described it from memory. It came out in a time when the American people  paid no attention to the producer or the cast. It may have many technical  crudities by present-day standards. But the root of the matter is there.  And Springfield knew it. It was brought back to our town many times. It  was popular in both the fashionable picture show houses and the cheapest,  dirtiest hole in the town. It will soon be reissued by the Vitagraph  Company. Every student of American Art should see this film.    The same exultation that went into it, the faculty for commanding the  great spirits of history and making visible the unseen powers of the  air, should be applied to Crowd Pictures which interpret the  non-sectarian prayers of the broad human race.    The pageant of Religious Splendor is the final photoplay form in the  classification which this work seeks to establish. Much of what follows  will be to reenforce the heads of these first discourses. Further comment  on the Religious Photoplay may be found in the eleventh chapter, entitled  \"Architecture-in-Motion.\"          CHAPTER VIII    SCULPTURE-IN-MOTION      The outline is complete. Now to reenforce it. Pictures of Action Intimacy  and Splendor are the foundation colors in the photoplay, as red, blue,  and yellow are the basis of the rainbow. Action Films might be called the  red section; Intimate Motion Pictures, being colder and quieter, might be  called blue; and Splendor Photoplays called yellow, since that is the hue  of pageants and sunshine.    Another way of showing the distinction is to review the types of gesture.  The Action Photoplay deals with generalized pantomime: the gesture of the  conventional policeman in contrast with the mannerism of the stereotyped  preacher. The Intimate Film gives us more elusive personal gestures: the  difference between the table manners of two preachers in the same  restaurant, or two policemen. A mark of the Fairy Play is the gesture of  incantation, the sweep of the arm whereby Mab would transform a prince  into a hawk. The other Splendor Films deal with the total gestures of  crowds: the pantomime of a torch-waving mass of men, the drill of an army  on the march, or the bending of the heads of a congregation receiving the  benediction.    Another way to demonstrate the thesis is to use the old classification of  poetry: dramatic,"]]]
