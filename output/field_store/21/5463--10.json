For  Sunday wear the men were given white cotton shirts and the women white  cotton dresses. All clothing was made on the plantation by those women  who were too old for field work.    In the same manner that clothing was sufficient, so was food plentiful.  At the end of each week each family was given 4 lbs. of meat, 1 peck of  meal, and some syrup. Each person in a family was allowed to raise a  garden and so they had vegetables whenever they wished to. In addition  to this they were allowed to raise chickens, to hunt and to fish.  However, none of the food that was secured in any of the ways mentioned  above could be sold. When anyone wished to hunt, Mr. Coxton supplied the  gun and the shot.    Although the slaves cooked for themselves, their breakfast and dinner  were usually sent to them in the fields after it had been prepared in  the cook house. The reason for this was that they had to get up too soon  in the morning, and at noon too much time would be lost if they were  permitted to go to their cabins for lunch.    The children who were too young to work in the field were cared for by  some old slave who likewise was unable to do field work. The children  were usually fed pot liquor, corn bread, milk, syrup, and vegetables.  Each one had his individual cup to eat from. The food on Sunday was  usually no different from that of any other day of the week. However,  Mr. Bland says that they never had to break in the smokehouse because of  hunger.    When asked to describe the living quarters of the slaves on his  plantation he looked around his room and muttered: \"Dey wuz a lot better  than dis one.\" Some of the cabins were made of logs and some of  weatherboards. The chinks in the walls were sealed with mud. In some  instances boards were used on the inside to keep the weather out. There  were usually two windows, shutters being used in the place of window  panes. The chimney and fireplace were made of mud and stones. All  cooking was done at the fireplace as none of them were provided with  stoves. Iron cooking utensils were used. To boil food a pot was hung  over the fire by means of a hook. The remaining furniture was a bench  which served as a chair, and a crude bed. Rope running from side to side  served as bed springs. The mattress was made of straw or hay. For  lighting purposes, pine knots and candles were used. The slaves on the  Coxton plantation were also fortunate in that all cabins had good  floors. All cabins and their furnishings were built by the slaves who  learned the use of hammer and saw from white artisans whom Mr. Coxton  employed from time to time. Mr. Bland remarked that his father was a  blacksmith, having learned the trade in this manner.    A doctor was employed regularly by Mr. Coxton to minister to the needs  of the slaves in time of illness. \"We also had our own medicine,\" says  Mr. Bland. At different times excursions were made to the woods where  \"yarbs\" (herbs) were gathered. Various kinds of teas and medicines were  made by boiling these roots in water. The usual causes of illness on  this plantation were colds, fevers, and constipation. Castor oil and  salts were also used to a great extent. If an individual was too ill to  work an older slave had to nurse this person.    No effort was made by Mr. Coxton to teach his slaves anything except  manual training. A slave who could use his hands at skilled work was  more valuable than the ordinary field hand. If, however, a slave secured  a book, Mr. Coxton would help him learn to read it. Above all, religious  training was not denied. As a matter of fact, Mr. Coxton required each  one of his servants to dress in his Sunday clothes and to go to church  every Sunday. Services for all were held at the white church--the slaves  sitting on one side and the masters on the other. All preaching was done  by a white pastor.    No promiscuous relationships were allowed. If a man wanted to marry he  merely pointed out the woman of his choice to the master. He in turn  called her and told her that such and such an individual wished her for  a wife. If she agreed they were pronounced man and wife and were  permitted to live together.    The slaves on his plantation were great believers in roots and their  values in the use of conjuring people.    Mr. Bland doesn't remember ever seeing anyone sold by Mr. Coxton, but he  heard that on other nearby plantations slaves were placed on an auction  block and sold like cattle.    None of the slaves were ever whipped or beaten by Mr. Coxton or by  anyone else. If a rule was broken the offender was called before Mr.  Coxton where he was talked to. In some cases a whipping was promised and  that ended the matter. The \"Paddie Rollers\" whipped the slaves from  other plantations when they were caught off of their premises without a  \"pass\" but this was never the case when a slave belonging to Mr. Coxton  broke this rule. Mr. Bland remembers that once he and some of his fellow  slaves were away from home without a pass when they were seen by the  \"Paddie Rollers\" who started after them. When they were recognized as  belonging to Mr. Coxton one of them (Paddie Rollers) said: \"Don't bother  them; that's them d---- 'free niggers'.\" The Paddie Rollers were not  allowed to come on the Coxton plantation to whip his slaves or any other  owner's slaves who happened to be visiting at the time. Mr. Coxton  required that they all be on the plantation by nightfall.    (The above seems to be rather conclusive proof of Mr. Coxton's influence  in the community.) [TR: Parentheses added by hand.]    Whenever a slave committed a crime against the State, his master usually  had to pay for the damage done or pay the slave's fine. It was then up  to him to see that the offender was punished.    Mr. Coxton once saw him (Mr. Bland) beat another slave (who was a guest  at a frolic) when this visitor attempted to draw a pistol on him. Mr.  Bland was upheld in his action and told by Mr. Coxton that he had better  always fight back when anyone struck him, whether the person was white  or black. Further, if he (Mr. Coxton) heard of his not fighting back a  whipping would be in store for him.    Mr. Coxton was different from some of the slave owners in that he gave  the head of each family spending money at Christmas time--the amount  varying with the size of the family.    \"When the Civil war was begun the master seemed to be worried all the  time\" states Mr. Bland. \"He was afraid that we would be freed and then  he would have to hire us to do his work.\"    When asked to describe his feelings about the war and the possibility of  his being freed, Mr. Bland said that he had no particular feeling of  gladness at all. The outcome of the war did not interest him at all  because Mr. Coxton was such a good master he didn't care whether he was  freed or not. His fellow slaves felt the same way.    When Sherman and the Yankees were marching through they took all of the  live stock but bothered nothing else. The buildings on the adjoining  plantation were all burned. A small skirmish took place about 2 miles  away from Mr. Coxton's plantation when the Yankees and Confederates met.  Mr. Coxton's two sons took part in the war.    Mr. Bland was taken by Sherman's army to Savannah and then to Macon. He  says that he saw President Jeff Davis give up his sword to General  Sherman in surrender.    After the war Mr. Coxton was still well off in spite of the fact that he  had lost quite a bit of money as a result of the war. He saved a great  deal of his cash by burying it when Sherman came through. The cattle  might have been saved if he (Mr. Bland) could have driven them into the  woods before he was seen by some of the soldiers.    At the close of the war Mr. Coxton informed all the slaves that they  were free to go where they wished, but they all refused to leave. Most  of them died on the plantation. Mr. Bland says that when he became of  age his former master gave him a wagon, two mules, a horse and buggy and  ten pigs.    Mr. Bland thinks that old age is a characteristic in his family. His  grandmother lived to be 115 years old and his mother 107 years old.  Although in his 80's, Mr. Bland is an almost perfect picture of health.  He thinks that he will live to become at least 100 years old because he  is going to continue to live as sane a life as he has in the past.          J.R. Jones    RIAS BODY, Ex-Slave.  Place of birth: Harris County, near Waverly Hall, Georgia  Date of birth: April 9, 1846  Present residence: 1419-24th Street, Columbus, Georgia  Interviewed: July 24, 1936  [JUL 8, 1937]      Rias Body was born the slave property of Mr. Ben Body, a Harris County  planter. He states that he was about fifteen years old when the Civil  War started and, many years ago, his old time white folks told him that  April 9, 1846, was the date of his birth.    The \"patarolers,\" according to \"Uncle\" Rias, were always quite active in  ante-bellum days. The regular patrol consisted of six men who rode  nightly, different planters and overseers taking turns about to do  patrol duty in each militia district in the County.    All slaves were required to procure passes from their owners or their  plantation overseers before they could go visiting or leave their home  premises. If the \"patarolers\" caught a \"Nigger\" without a pass, they  whipped him and sent him home. Sometimes, however, if the \"Nigger\"  didn't run and told a straight story, he was let off with a lecture and  a warning. Slave children, though early taught to make themselves  useful, had lots of time for playing and frolicking with the white  children.    Rias was a great hand to go seining with a certain clique of white boys,  who always gave him a generous or better than equal share of the fish  caught.    At Christmas, every slave on the Body plantation received a present.

I've struck it, all right!\"    It was as he had said. The projectile, driven with almost irresistible  force, had bitten its way through the armor plate, but a projection at  the base of the shell had prevented it from completely passing through.  Then, with the energy almost unabated, the projectile had torn the  plate loose and hurled it, together with its own body, into the solid  earth of the hillside.  There, as Koku held them up, they could all see  the shell imbedded in the plate, the point sticking out on the other  side, as a boy might spear an apple with a sharp stick.    \"Bless my spectacle case!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"This is the greatest ever!\"    \"It sure is,\" agreed Ned. \"Tom, my boy, I guess you can now make the  longest shots on record.\"    \"I can as soon as I get my giant cannon, perhaps,\" admitted the young  inventor. \"I think I have solved the problem of the explosive. Now to  work on the cannon.\"    An examination of the gauges, which, being attached to the cannon and  plate by electric wires, were not damaged when the blast came, showed  that Tom's wildest hopes had been confirmed.  He had the most powerful  explosive ever made--or at least as far as he had any knowledge, and he  had had samples of all the best makes.    Concerning Tom's powder, or explosive, I will only say that he kept the  formula of it secret from all save his father. All that he would admit,  when the government experts asked him about it, later, was that the  base was not nitro-glycerine, but that this entered into it. He agreed,  however, in case his gun was accepted by the government, to disclose  the secret to the ordnance officers.    But Tom's work was only half done. It was one thing to have a powerful  explosive, but there must be some means of utilizing it safely--some  cannon in which it could be fired to send a projectile farther than any  cannon had ever sent one. And to do this much work was necessary.    Tom figured and planned, far into the night, for many weeks after that.  He had to begin all over again, working from the basis of the power of  his new explosive. And he had many new problems to figure out.    But finally he had constructed--on paper--a gun that was to his liking.  The most exhaustive figuring proved that it had a margin of safety that  would obviate all danger of its bursting, even with an accidental  over-charge.    \"And the next thing is to get the gun cast,\" said Tom to Ned one day.    \"Are you going to do it in your shops?\" his chum asked.    \"No; it would be out of the question for me. I haven't the facilities.  I'm going to give the contract to the Universal Steel Company. We'll  pay them a visit in a day or two.\"    But even the great facilities of the steel corporation proved almost  inadequate for Tom's giant cannon. When he showed the drawings, on  which he had already secured a patent, the manager balked.    \"We can't cast that gun here!\" he said.    \"Oh, yes, you can!\" declared Tom, who had inspected the plant.  \"I'll  show you how.\"    \"Why, we haven't a mould big enough for the central core,\" was another  objection.    \"Then we'll make one,\" declared Tom \"We'll dig a pit in the earth, and  after it is properly lined we can make the cast there.\"    \"I never thought of that!\" exclaimed the manager. \"Perhaps it can be  done.\"    \"Of course it can!\" cried Tom. \"Do you think you can shrink on the  jackets, and rifle the central tube?\"    \"Oh, yes, we can do that. The initial cast was what stumped me.  But  we'll go ahead now.\"    \"And you can wind the breech with wire, and braze it on; can't you?\"  persisted Tom.    \"Yes, I think so. Are you going to have a wire-wound gun?\"    \"That, in combination with a steel-jacketed one. I'm going to take no  chances with 'Swiftite'!\" laughed Tom, for so he had named his new  explosive, in honor of his father, who had helped him with the formula.    \"It must be mighty powerful,\" exclaimed the manager.    \"It is,\" said Tom, simply.    I am not going to tire my readers with the details leading up to the  casting of Tom's big cannon. Sufficient to say that the general plan,  in brief, was this: A hole would be dug in the earth, in the center of  the largest casting shop--a hole as deep as the gun was to be long.  This was about one hundred feet, though the gun, when finished, would  be somewhat shorter than this. An allowance was to be made for cutting.    In the center of this hole would be a small \"core\" made of asbestos and  concrete mixed. Around this would be poured the molten steel from great  caldrons. It would flow into the hole.  The sides of earth--lined with  fire-clay--would hold it in, and the middle core would make a hole  throughout the length of the central part of the gun. Afterward this  hole would be bored and rifled to the proper calibre.    After this central part was done, steel jackets or sleeves would be put  on, red-hot, and allowed to shrink. Then would come a winding of wire,  to further strengthen the tube, and then more sleeves or jackets. In  this way the gun would be made very strong.    As the greatest pressure would come at the breech, or in the powder  chamber there, the gun would be thickest at this point, decreasing in  size to the muzzle.    It took many weary weeks to get ready for the first cast, but finally  Tom received word that it was to be made, and with Ned, and Mr. Damon,  he proceeded to the plant of the steel concern.    There was some delay, but finally the manager gave the word.  Tom and  his friends, standing on a high gallery, watched the tapping of the  combined furnaces that were to let the molten steel into the caldrons.  There were several of these, and their melted contents were to be  poured into the mould at the same time.    Out gushed the liquid steel, giving off a myriad of sparks. The  workers, as well as the visitors, had to wear violet-tinted glasses to  protect their eyes from the glare.    \"Hoist away!\" cried the manager, and the electric cranes started off  with the caldrons of liquid fire, weighing many tons.    \"Pour!\" came the command, and into the pit in the earth splashed the  melted steel that was to form the big cannon. From each caldron there  issued a stream of liquid metal of intense heat. There were numerous  explosions as the air bubbles burst--explosions almost like a battery  in action.    \"So far so good!\" exclaimed the manager, with a sigh of relief as the  last of the melted stuff ran into the mould. \"Now, when it cools, which  won't be for some days, we'll see what we have.\"    \"I hope it contains no flaws,\" spoke Tom, \"That is the worst of big  guns--you never can tell when a flaw will develop. But I hope--\"    Tom was interrupted by the sound of a dispute at one of the outer doors  of the shop.    \"But I tell you I must go in--I belong here in!\" a voice cried.  It had  a German accent, and at the sound of it Tom and Ned looked at each  other.    \"Who is there?\" asked the manager sharply of the foreman..    \"Oh, a crazy German. He belongs in one of the other shops, and I guess  he's mixed up. He thinks he belongs here. I sent him about his  business.\"    \"That is right,\" remarked the manager. \"I gave orders, at your  request,\" he said to Tom, \"that no one but the men in this part of the  plant were to be present at the casting. I can't understand what that  fellow wanted.\"    \"I think I can,\" murmured Tom, to himself.          CHAPTER XIV    A NIGHT INTRUDER      \"Tom, aren't you going to try to get a look at that German?\" whispered  Ned, as he and his chum came down from the elevated gallery at the  conclusion of the cast. \"I mean the one who tried to get in!\"    \"I'd like to, Ned, but I don't want to arouse any suspicion,\" replied  Tom. \"I've got to stay here a while yet, and arrange about shrinking on  the jackets, after the core is rifled. I don't see how--\"    \"I'll slip out and see if I can get a peep at him,\" went on Ned. \"If  it's like the one Koku described, we'll know that he's still after you.\"    \"All right, Ned. Do as you like, only be cautious.\"    \"I will,\" promised Tom's chum. So, while the young inventor was busy  arranging details with the steel manager, Ned slipped out of a side  door of the casting shop, and looked about the yard. He saw a little  group of workmen surrounding a man who appeared to be angry.    \"I dell you dot is my shop!\" one of the men was heard to exclaim--a man  whom the others appeared to dragging away with main force.    \"And I tell you, Baudermann, that you're mistaken!\" insisted one,  evidently a foreman. \"I told you to work in the brazing department.  What do you want to try to force your way into the heavy casting  department for? Especially when we're doing one of the biggest jobs  that we ever handled--making the new Swift cannon.\"    \"Oh, iss dot vot vas going on in dere?\" asked the man addressed as  Baudermann. \"Shure den, I makes a misdake. I ask your pardon, Herr  Blackwell. I to mine own apartment will go. But I dinks my foreman  sends me to dot place,\" and he indicated the casting shop from which he  had just been barred.    \"All right!\" exclaimed the foreman. \"Don't make that mistake again, or  I'll dock you for lost time.\"    \"Only just a twisted German employee, I guess,\" thought Ned, as he was  about to turn back. \"I was mistaken. He probably didn't understand  where he was sent.\"    He passed by the group of men, who, laughing and jeering at the German,  were showing him where to go. He seemed to be a new hand in the works.    But as Ned passed he got one look at the man's face. Instead of a  stupid countenance, for one instant he had a glimpse of the sharpest,  brightest eyes he had ever looked into. And they were hard, cruel eyes,  too, with a glint of daring in them. And, as Ned glanced at his figure,  he thought he detected a trace of military stiffness--none of the  stoop-shouldered slouch that is always the mark of a moulder. The  fellow's hands, too, though black and grimy,"]]]
