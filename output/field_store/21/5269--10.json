Without animal flesh I do not know what I should have done here. The  water was so nitrous I could not drink it. To quench my thirst, I  threw it in gulps down my throat; and rice, when boiled in it,  resembled salts and senna. After returning from sport one day, the  interpreter brought up one of the camel-drivers, to be punished for  having stolen some deer flesh when sent to clean it. He was a Midgar,  or low-caste fellow, who does not object to indulge in cannibalism  when hard pressed by hunger. I would not decide the case myself, but  handed him over, much against his wish, to the _tender_ mercies of the  interpreter and two other men whom the sultan, at parting, appointed  judges on any sudden occasion. It was everybody's interest to make him  guilty, and therefore he was condemned to find two sheep, to be killed  and eaten in the camp. Another case of theft, much more vexatious than  this, occurred when I first arrived here, and turned off some spare  camel-drivers, who took away all the packing-ropes with them, and I  have been obliged to employ the remaining men ever since in chewing  acacia bark into fibres to make new ones.    I was now becoming so much alarmed at the Abban's delay and tricks,  that I wrote a letter to Lieutenant Playfair, Assistant Political  Resident at Aden, complaining of what he had done, saying I felt very  uncertain of being able to reach Berbera by the time appointed, and  requesting him to send a letter of remonstrance to the sultan. This I  forwarded by a man called Abdie, _vi√¢_ Bunder Gori. Prudence would  have suggested my returning with the letter, for I had now received  intelligence that the Abban was in his home, and after experience  gained by the tragedies on the coast, I could have expected no good  from him. But as long as life and time lasted, I was resolved to go  ahead.    It was very remarkable to see the great length of time animals in this  country can exist, even under hard work, without drinking water. In an  ordinary way, the Somali water camels only twice a-month, donkeys four  times, sheep every fourth day, and ponies only once in two days, and  even object to doing it oftener, when the water is plentiful, lest the  animals should lose their hardihood. I do not think antelopes could  possibly get at water for several months together, as every drop of  water in the country is guarded by the Somali. We were now in \"the  land of honey,\" and the Somali nomads constantly came to me to borrow  my English pickaxe for digging it out of the ground; for the bees of  this country, instead of settling in the boughs of trees, as they do  in England, work holes in the ground like wasps, or take advantage  more generally of chinks or fissures in the rocks to build their combs  and deposit their wax. It was a great treat to get a little of this  sweet nutriment, to counteract the salts which prevail in all the  spring waters of the interior. When out shooting specimens, I often  saw the Somali chasing down the Salt's antelopes on foot.    I killed many of them myself right and left, when running like hares,  with common shot, much to the astonishment of the Somali, for they are  too small a mark for their bow-and-arrow shooting. The little  creatures cannot stand travelling in the mid-day sun, and usually lie  about under favouring trees which line the watercourses. Knowing this  weakness, the cunning Somali hunter watches him down from feeding to  his favourite haunts, and, after the sun shines strong enough, quietly  disturbs him; then, as he trots away to search for another shady bush,  they follow gently after to prevent his resting. In the course of an  hour or so, the terrified animal, utterly exhausted, rushes from bush  to bush, throwing itself down under each in succession, until at  length it gets captured.    Somali, from their roving habits of life, are as keen and cunning  sportsmen as any in the world. They told me of many dodges they  adopted for killing elephants, ostriches, and gazelles, which they do  as follows:--If an elephant is ever seen upon the plains, a large body  of men assemble on foot, armed with spears, bows, and sharp  double-edged knives, with one man mounted on a white horse, to act as  teaser. This man commences by riding in front of the animal, to  irritate and absorb his entire attention by riding in repeated circles  just in front of him. When the huge beast shows signs of distress by  fruitlessly charging on his nimble adversary, the footmen rush in upon  him from behind, and hamstring him with their knives, and then with  great facility soon despatch him with their arrows and spears.    Ostriches, again, are killed in two ways; the more simple one is by  finding out what places they usually resort to in search of food, and  then throwing down some tempting herb of strong poisonous properties,  which they eagerly eat and die from. The other method adopted in  catching them is not so easy, but is managed with great effect. The  ostrich is, as is generally known, a remarkably shy bird, and is so  blind at night it cannot feed. Again, the Somali pony, though  wonderfully hardy and enduring, is not swift; therefore, to  accommodate existing power to knowledge of these various weaknesses,  the Somali provides himself with a pony, and provisions for two or  three days, and begins his hunt by showing himself at such a  considerable distance from the birds he has formed his design upon,  that they quietly stalk off, and he, at the same rate, follows after,  but never draws near enough to scare them out of sight of him. At  night, the birds stop in consequence of the darkness, but cannot feed.  He, on the other hand, dismounts to rest and feed with his pony, and  resumes the chase the following day. After the second or third day,  when he and the pony are as fresh as ever, the ostriches, from  constant fasting, become so weak, he is able to ride in amongst them,  and knock down one by one as many as may be in the flock. The flesh is  eaten, and the feathers are taken to the sea-coast for transportation  to the Aden market. I once saw a donkey-load of feathers carried to  market that had been taken in this way.    There are two methods, also, of killing gazelles; the more usual one  is effected by two men walking into a bushy ground to search for them,  and when discovered, walking in such large circles around them as will  not scare them; gradually they draw their circles in, until a favoured  bush, down wind, is found, which the herd is most likely, when once  moved, to pass by, and behind this one of the men stops, with his bow  and arrows, whilst the second one, without ever stopping to create  alarm, continues drawing in the circles of circumvention until he  induces the gazelles to walk up to the bush his friend is concealed  in, when one or more may be easily shot. The other plan for killing  them is extremely artful, and is done on horseback, and therefore on  the open plain. Fleet animals, like antelopes and gazelles, always  endeavour to head across their pursuers, no matter in which direction  they go. The Somali, therefore, taking advantage of this habit, when  they wish to catch them on ponies, which are not half so swift as the  gazelles in fair open chase, economise their strength by directing  their animals' heads towards the leading gazelle, and thus inducing  the herd, as they continue heading on, to describe double the  circumference of ground their ponies have to traverse. In process of  time, the gazelles, by their extra exertions, begin to flag and drop,  and the hunters rush in upon them, and cut them up in detail.    20th.--To-day the young prince, Abdullah, returned to say the  Dulbahantas had been conferred with, and had shown the strongest  objections to my seeing their country, enumerating at the same time  all their reasonings, such as I had already heard; but added, as a  great concession on their part, as a particular favour they wished to  show to my Abban, that I might be permitted to advance a little way to  the next valley; but then only on condition that I would surrender to  them the whole of my remaining property.    I now heard more particulars of the Dulbahantas' fights, and the  manner in which they first originated. For full thirteen years they  had been disputing amongst themselves, and many cabals had sprung out  of it. Whilst these intrigues were gaining ground, a minor chief,  named Ali Haram, with a powerful support in connections, about five  years ago determined on alienating himself from the yoke of the  government, which was headed by an old Gerad, called Mahamed Ali, the  rightful and hereditary chief. Since then the original kingdom has  been divided into two portions, called the Northern and Southern  Dulbahantas; but although the northerners declare themselves  independent, the chief of the south still fights for his lawful  rights, and at this present time had driven the northerners, with all  their cattle and stock, to Jid Ali Tug, the next valley beyond this,  which I was now desirous of visiting. Ali Haram was an old man, and  consequently incapacitated from taking an active part in these  tumultuous filibusterings; he had therefore, since his first accession  to power, deputed a son called Mahamed Ali Gerad to act as Regent in  his stead, and this was the man of whom the Warsingali spoke to me at  Bunder Gori so disparagingly.    21st.--I was now preparing to start again westward, when an order came  from the Abban to my men, that no property should accompany me,  excepting what little I felt disposed to part with in presents to the  Dulbahantas; as an Akil, by name Husayn Hadji, the senior man present  at Jid Ali, had decided, as a final measure, on seizing everything I  brought with me immediately I set foot in Jid Ali.
