At present you are but exhausting yourselves in vain, and  the sea will soon get up so much that it will be impossible to use  the oars.\"    \"So be it,\" Harold replied; and at the master's orders the oars  were laid in, and the men prepared to get sail upon her. A sailor  climbed up the mast and fastened the stays close to the point which  was broken off. Then another joined him, and a block was lashed to  the mast just below the stays, and the halliards were rove through  it; then Edred brought out a small sail, and this was hoisted, and  the vessel, which had before been rolling heavily, began to glide  swiftly through the water. They had had the satisfaction of seeing  that their consorts, although like themselves nearly capsized by  the squall, had suffered no damage, but after lowering their sails  and yards to the deck, had succeeded in rowing into the bay, their  lighter hull and draught enabling the oars to drive them through  the water in the teeth of the wind.    \"She is going along finely now,\" Wulf said.    \"Yes,\" Beorn agreed; \"but before night there is like to be a sea  that will try her.\"    Harold held a consultation with the master, and presently all the  men were called to work. The great sail was unrolled from its yard  and a portion cut off, somewhat wider than the beam of the boat,  and in length reaching from the bow to the mast. Nails and hammers  were brought up from the little cabin, and the canvas was stretched  from bulwark to bulwark and strongly nailed to the wood on either  side, oars being first lashed across at short intervals to support  it.    \"I suppose that is for us to lie under, Master Wulf?\" Osgod said.  \"It is a pity it was not erected before, for there is not a man on  board who is not drenched to the skin.\"    \"It is not put there to keep you dry, Osgod, but to keep the waves  from coming into the ship. But she goes over them well. The wind  is getting up, Osgod, and we shall have a great sea presently.\"    \"Then why don't we turn and sail back again? It seems to me to be  folly to be running away from the land if such is going to be the  weather.\"    \"How can we sail back again? Do you not see that it is the wind  that is blowing us off, and the vessel must go as the wind takes  her. One can go a little this way or that, but no man ever yet  sailed in the teeth of the wind.\"    \"This is the first time I have ever been to sea,\" Osgod said, \"and  I trust it will be the last. The tossing of the ship makes me  strangely giddy, and many of the servants are downright ill with  it. Why men should go on the water when they can walk upon the land  is more than I can say. I think I will go and lie down under the  shelter of the sail, for indeed I feel as if I were about to die.\"    Wulf himself was feeling strangely uncomfortable. As long as they  had been at work he had not felt unwell, for the necessity of holding  on to the bulwarks or ropes, and the excitement of their strange  position, had saved him from experiencing many qualms; but both he  and Beorn were soon glad to follow Osgod's example, and to lie down  on the boards under the rowers' benches. Fiercer and fiercer blew  the wind, more and more violent became the motion of the ship;  masses of water fell on the canvas forward, as she plunged into the  waves, and would have soon beaten it in had it not been for the  support of the oars. By evening most of the men were lying under  the shelter, while Harold's brother and friends had retired to the  little cabin in the stern. The earl himself remained by the side  of the ship-master, who had taken his place close to the tiller,  which was worked by four men.    \"Think you that she will weather it, Edred?\"    \"I have little fear about that, my lord. She is a staunch boat, and  I have been aboard her in seas as heavy as this. Besides, that  thought of yours of stretching the canvas across her bow has greatly  improved her chances. The water runs off as fast as it falls on it,  and none comes on board. Had it not been for this every man would  have had to bail all night. No, I have no fear of her weathering  the gale. What I am afraid of is, that if this wind continues to  blow we shall assuredly be lost on the coast of Normandy.\"    \"That would be an ill fortune, indeed, for I know that the Normans  count all that are cast on their shores as lawful prey; and even  if we reach the land in safety and escape murder at the hands of  the lord of the soil and his people, I may fall into the hands of  Duke William, who is assuredly no friend of mine, seeing that I  stand in the way of his designs upon the throne of England. Truly  it was an evil moment when the thought of taking to the sea occurred  to me, and I would give a broad slice of my earldom to be back at  Bosham.\"    Hour by hour the waves increased in size and violence, and often  poured in over the sides. The number of men on board was too great  for all to work effectively. They therefore were divided into two  parties, one being engaged in bailing while the other lay under  cover, the change being made every hour. Wulf preferred working  to lying still, for as the craft rolled the water washed over them,  while the din of the waves striking the ship's side, and the cataracts  of spray falling on to the canvas above were deafening, and it was  impossible to get a moment's sleep. All were glad when morning  broke, although the scene that met their eyes was the reverse of  comforting. Small as was the amount of sail the vessel tore through  the water under the pressure of the following wind. Great waves  with white crests pursued her, and as they neared her stern it  seemed to Wulf that they must inevitably fall over and crush her.  The spray torn from the crest by the wind filled the air. The wind  shrieked in the cordage, and the vessel creaked and groaned as she  rolled from side to side.    \"I would not have believed if I had not seen it, that the sea could  be so violent and ill-behaved,\" Wulf shouted to Osgod, who was then  standing beside him.    \"If my clothes were but dry and my stomach full I would not mind  so much,\" Osgod replied; \"but to be drenched in water all night and  to have nought to eat in the morning, takes the courage out of one  mightily. How long, think you, will this go on?\"    \"That no one can say. It may last two or three days.\"    \"And no food all that time!\" Osgod exclaimed in dismay.    \"We could stand that well enough, Osgod; but I do not think there  is much chance of our being called upon to do so, for I heard one  of the sailors say that unless the storm abates marvellously we are  likely to be cast upon the French coast before nightfall.\"    \"I should be glad to be cast anywhere so it were out of this. At  least, whether it be France or England, there must be food to be  had on shore.\"    \"You do not understand, Osgod. Unless we happen to be cast upon a  shelving coast with sand or gravel the craft may be dashed to pieces,  and all lose their lives; for assuredly none could swim long in  such a sea as this.\"    \"Well, we must hope that we shall find a shore such as you speak  of,\" Osgod said tranquilly; \"but for my part, I am content to take  the risk rather than wait another three days before getting anything  to eat.\"    \"And I would rather fast for a week than run the risk of the ship  being broken up on the rocks,\" Wulf replied. \"I can swim but little  even in calm water, and I am sure that I could do nothing among  those waves.\"    \"I can swim, and will look after you,\" Osgod said confidently. \"I  used to swim every day in the Thames.\"    Wulf shook his head. \"I daresay you might look after me if I fell  into the Thames, Osgod, but it is a very different thing in a sea  like this. These waves would dash a swimmer hither and thither as  if he were but a chip of wood; besides, the spray would smother  him. Even at this height above the water it is difficult to breathe  when one turns round and faces the wind. I think that our only  hope lies in running upon a flat shore, where the waves will wash  the vessel up so high that we may be able to leap out from the bow  on to the land beyond the reach of their fury.\"    Late in the afternoon one of the sailors on the poop astern shouted  out that land was visible, and it was not long before it could be  seen from the deck. All eyes were directed anxiously towards it.    \"It is a rocky coast,\" Edred said, \"but the rocks are not high, and  if we can manage to direct the vessel between two of them we may  escape. At present it is needful that most of the crew should keep  in the stern, but when we are about to strike they must all run  suddenly forward, so as to leap out as soon as she touches the  ground. There will be but little time given to them, for assuredly  the seas will batter her to pieces the moment she falls among the  rocks.\"    Harold issued the order. All were to remain at their posts until  he gave the word, and were then to run forward. The master scanned  the shore anxiously.    \"See you, my lord, that opening right ahead of us? It seems to me  barely the width of the ship, but if I can direct her truly between  the rocks methinks that most of the crew will gain the land. I shall  myself take the helm. That is my duty and my right, and should I  not succeed in making the shore, I shall at least die well contented  with the thought that you who are the hope of England will be saved.\"    \"I would fain stay with you, Edred.\"    \"That cannot be, my lord. As it is my duty to stay by the ship to  the last, so it is your first duty to save your life for England.  I need no aid, for the vessel steers well, and by the help of a  rope round the tiller I can manage her alone. Farewell, my lord,  if we are not to meet again on earth. A very few minutes will decide  our fate.\"    \"Swimming will be of no use there, Osgod,\" Wulf said. \"Look how  the spray dashes itself "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],[0,"Milton (#12)"],[1,"in Shakspeare and Jonson, on the ground  that repartee is the accomplishment of lighter thinkers and a less  earnest age. So of Milton's pamphlets it must be said that he was not  fencing for pastime, but fighting for all he held most worthy. He had  to think only of making his blows tell. When a battle is raging, and  my friends are sorely pressed, am I not to help because good manners  forbid the shedding of blood?    No good man can, with impunity, addict himself to party. And the best  men will suffer most, because their conviction of the goodness of  their cause is deeper. But when one with the sensibility of a poet  throws himself into the excitements of a struggle, he is certain to  lose his balance. The endowment of feeling and imagination which  qualifies him to be the ideal interpreter of life, unfits him  for participation in that real life, through the manoeuvres and  compromises of which reason is the only guide, and where imagination  is as much misplaced as it would be in a game of chess. \"The ennobling  difference between one man and another is that one feels more than  another.\" Milton's capacity of emotion, when once he became champion  of a cause, could not be contained within the bounds of ordinary  speech. It breaks into ferocious reprobation, into terrific blasts of  vituperation, beneath which the very language creaks, as the timbers  of a ship in a storm. Corruptio optimi pessima. The archangel  is recognisable by the energy of his malice. Were all those  accomplishments; those many studious years hiving wisdom, the  knowledge of all the tongues, the command of all the thoughts of  all the ages, and that wealth of English expression--were all these  acquirements only of use, that their possessor might vie in defamation  with an Edwards or a Du Moulin?    For it should be noted that these pamphlets, now only serving as a  record of the prostitution of genius to political party, were, at the  time at which they appeared, of no use to the cause in which they  were written. Writers, with a professional tendency to magnify their  office, have always been given to exaggerate the effect of printed  words. There are examples of thought having been influenced by  books. But such books have been scientific, not rhetorical. Milton's  pamphlets are not works of speculation, or philosophy, or learning, or  solid reasoning on facts. They are inflammatory appeals, addressed to  the passions of the hour. He who was meditating the erection of an  enduring creation, such as the world \"would not willingly let die,\"  was content to occupy himself with the most ephemeral of all hackwork.  His own polemical writings may be justly described in the words he  himself uses of a book by one of his opponents, as calculated \"to  gain a short, contemptible, and soon-fading reward, not to stir the  constancy and solid firmness of any wise man ... but to catch the  worthless approbation of an inconstant, irrational, and image-doting  rabble.\"    It would have been not unnatural that the public school and university  man, the admirer of Shakspeare and the old romances, the pet of  Italian academies, the poet-scholar, himself the author of two Masks,  who was nursing his wings for a new flight into the realms of verse,  should have sided with the cavaliers against the Puritans, with the  party of culture and the humanities against the party which shut up  the theatres and despised profane learning. But we have seen that  there was another side to Milton's mind. This may be spoken of as his  other self, the Puritan self, and regarded as in internal conflict  with the poet's self. His twenty years' pamphlet warfare may be  presented by his biographer as the expression of the Puritanic Milton,  who shall have been driven back upon his suppressed instincts as a  poet by the ruin of his political hopes. This chart of Milton's life  is at once simple and true. But like all physiological diagrams it  falls short of the subtlety and complexity of human character. A study  of the pamphlets will show that the poet is all there, indeed only too  openly for influence on opinion, and that the blighted hope of  the patriot lends a secret pathos to _Paradise Lost_ and _Samson  Agonistes_.    This other element in Milton is not accurately named Puritanism. Even  the term republicanism is a coarse and conventional description of  that sentiment which dominated his whole being, and which is the  inspiration at once of his poetry and of his prose. To give a name  to this sentiment, I must call it the love of liberty. It was an  aspiration at once real and vague, after a new order of things, an  order in which the old injustices and oppressions should cease; after  a new Jerusalem, a millennium, a Utopia, an Oceana. Its aim was to  realise in political institutions that great instauration of which  Bacon dreamed in the world of intelligence. It was much more negative  than affirmative, and knew better, as we all do, how good was hindered  than how it should be promoted. \"I did but prompt the age to _quit  their clogs_.\" Milton embodied, more perfectly than any of his  cotemporaries, this spirit of the age. It is the ardent aspiration,  after the pure and noble life, the aspiration which stamps every line  he wrote, verse or prose, with a dignity as of an heroic age. This  gives consistency to all his utterances. The doctrinaire republican of  to-day cannot understand how the man who approved the execution of the  would-be despot Charles Stuart, should have been the hearty supporter  of the real autocrat Oliver Cromwell. Milton was not the slave of a  name. He cared not for the word republic, so as it was well with the  commonwealth. Parliaments or single rulers, he knew, are \"but means  to an end; if that end was obtained, no matter if the constitutional  guarantees exist or not. Many of Milton's pamphlets are certainly  party pleadings, choleric, one-sided, personal. But through them all  runs the one redeeming characteristic--that they are all written  on the side of liberty. He defended religious liberty against the  prelates, civil liberty against the crown, the liberty of the  press against the executive, liberty of conscience against the  Presbyterians, and domestic liberty against the tyranny of canon law.  Milton's pamphlets might have been stamped with the motto which Selden  inscribed (in Greek) in all his books, \"Liberty before everything.\"    One virtue these pamphlets possess, the virtue of style. They are  monuments of our language so remarkable that Milton's prose works must  always be resorted to by students, as long as English remains a medium  of ideas. Yet even on the score of style, Milton's prose is subject to  serious deductions. His negligence is such as to amount to an absence  of construction. He who, in his verse, trained the sentence with  delicate sensibility to follow his guiding hand into exquisite syntax,  seems in his prose writing to abandon his meaning to shift for itself.  Here Milton compares disadvantageously with Hooker. Hooker's elaborate  sentence, like the sentence of Demosthenes, is composed of parts  so hinged, of clauses so subordinated to the main thought, that we  foresee the end from the beginning, and close the period with a sense  of perfect roundness and totality. Milton does not seem to have any  notion of what a period means. He begins anywhere, and leaves off, not  when the sense closes, but when he is out of breath. We might have  thought this pell-mell huddle of his words was explained, if not  excused, by the exigencies of the party pamphlet, which cannot wait.  But the same asyntactle disorder is equally found in the _History of  Britain_, which he had in hand for forty years. Nor is it only the  Miltonic sentence which is incoherent; the whole arrangement of his  topics is equally loose, disjointed, and desultory. His inspiration  comes from impulse. Had he stayed to chastise his emotional writing by  reason and the laws of logic, he would have deprived himself of the  sources of his strength.    These serious faults are balanced by virtues of another kind. Putting  Bacon aside, the condensed force and poignant brevity of whose  aphoristic wisdom has no parallel in English, there is no other  prosaist who possesses anything like Milton's command over the  resources of our language. Milton cannot match the musical harmony and  exactly balanced periods of his predecessor Hooker. He is without  the power of varied illustration, and accumulation of ornamental  circumstance, possessed by his contemporary, Jeremy Taylor  (1613-1667). But neither of these great writers impresses the reader  with a sense of unlimited power such as we feel to reside in Milton.  Vast as is the wealth of magnificent words which he flings with both  hands carelessly upon the page, we feel that there is still much more  in reserve.    The critics have observed (Collier's _Poetical Decameron_) that as  Milton advanced in life he gradually disused the compound words he  had been in the habit of making for himself. However this may be, his  words are the words of one who made a study of the language, as a  poet studies language, searching its capacities for the expression of  surging emotion. Jeremy Taylor's prose is poetical prose. Milton's  prose is not poetical prose, but a different thing, the prose of a  poet; not like Taylor's, loaded with imagery on the outside; but  coloured by imagination from within. Milton is the first English  writer who, possessing in the ancient models a standard of the effect  which could be produced by choice of words, set himself to the  conscious study of our native tongue with a firm faith in its as yet  undeveloped powers as an instrument of thought.    The words in Milton's poems have been counted, and it appears that he  employs 8000, while Shakspeare's plays and poems yield about 15,000.  From this it might be inferred that the Miltonic vocabulary is only  half as"]]]
