He was just over the hill from the coulee where they were camped,  so it's bound to be the same animal. It's a fact, he didn't have much  covering--just something hung over his shoulders. And he was sure  wild, for soon as he seen us he humped himself and got into the brush.  We could hear him go crashing away like a whole bunch of elephants.  It's a damn' shame he got away on us,\" Pink sighed regretfully. \"We  was going to rope him and put him in a cage; we could sure uh made  money on him, at two bits a look.\"    Happy Jack continued to eye the three distrustfully. Too often had he  been the victim of their humor for him now to believe implicitly in  their ignorance. It was too good to be real, it seemed to him. Still,  if by any good luck it _were_ real, he hated to think what would  happen if they ever found out the truth. He eased the clothing  cautiously away from his smarting back, and stared hard into a coulee.    \"It was likely some sheepherder gone clean nutty,\" mused Irish.    \"Well, the most uh them wouldn't have far to go,\" ventured Happy Jack,  thinking of the Swede.    \"What we ought to do,\" said Pink, keen for the chase, \"is for the  whole bunch of us to come down here and round him up. Wonder if we  couldn't talk Chip into laying off for a day or so; there's no herd to  hold. I sure would like to get a good look at him.\"    \"Somebody ought to take him in,\" observed Irish longingly. \"He ain't  safe, running around loose like that. There's no telling what he might  do. The way them campers read his brand, he's plumb dangerous to meet  up with alone. It's lucky you didn't run onto him, Happy.\"    \"Well, I didn't,\" growled Happy Jack. \"And what's more, I betche there  ain't any such person.\"    \"Don't call us liars to our faces, Happy,\" Weary reproved. \"We told  yuh, a dozen times, that we saw him ourselves. Yuh might be polite  enough to take our word for it.\"    \"Aw, gwan!\" Happy Jack grunted, still not quite sure of how much--or  how little--they knew. While they discussed further the wild man, he  watched furtively for the surreptitious lowering of lids that would  betray their insincerity. When they appealed to him for an opinion of  some phase of the subject, he answered with caution. He tried to turn  the talk to his experiences on the Shonkin range, and found the wild  man cropping up with disheartening persistency. He shifted often in  the saddle, because of the deep sunburns which smarted continually and  maddeningly. He wondered if the boys had used all of that big box of  carbolic salve which used to be kept in a corner of the mess-box; and  was carbolic salve good for sun-blisters? He told himself gloomily  that if there was any of it left, and if it were good for his ailment,  there wouldn't be half enough of it, anyway. He estimated unhappily  that he would need about two quarts.    When they reached camp, the welcome of Happy Jack was overshadowed and  made insignificant by the strange story of the wild man. Happy Jack,  mentally and physically miserable, was forced to hear it all told over  again, and to listen to the excited comments of the others. He was  sick of the subject. He had heard enough about the wild man, and he  wished fervently that they would shut up about it. He couldn't see  that it was anything to make such a fuss about, anyway. And he wished  he could get his hands on that carbolic salve, without having the  whole bunch rubbering around and asking questions about something that  was none of their business. He even wished, in that first bitter hour  after he had eaten and while they were lying idly in the shady spots,  that he was back on the Shonkin range with an alien crew.    It was perhaps an hour later that Pink, always of an investigative  turn of mind, came slipping quietly up through the rose bushes from  the creek. The Happy Family, lying luxuriously upon the grass, were  still discussing the latest excitement. Pink watched his chance and  when none but Weary observed him jerked his head mysteriously toward  the creek.    Weary got up, yawned ostentatiously, and sauntered away in the wake of  Pink. \"What's the matter, Cadwolloper?\" he asked, when he was close  enough. \"Seen a garter snake?\" Pink was notoriously afraid of snakes.    \"You come with me, and I'll show yuh the wild man,\" he grinned.    \"Mama!\" ejaculated Weary, and followed stealthily where Pink led.    Some distance up the creek Pink signalled caution, and they crept like  Indians on hands and knees through the grass. On the edge of the high  bank they stopped, and Pink motioned. Weary looked over and came near  whooping at the sight below. He gazed a minute, drew back and put his  face close to the face of Pink.    \"Cadwolloper, go get the bunch!\" he commanded in a whisper, and Pink,  again signalling needlessly for silence, slipped hastily away from the  spot.    Happy Jack, secure in the seclusion offered by the high bank of the  creek, ran his finger regretfully around the inside of the carbolic  salve box, eyed the result dissatisfiedly, and applied the finger  carefully to a deep cut on his knee. He had got that cut while going  up the bluff, just after leaving the tent where had been the shrieking  females. He wished there was more salve, and he picked up the cover of  the box and painstakingly wiped out the inside; the result was  disheartening.    He examined his knee dolefully. It was beginning to look inflamed, and  it was going to make him limp. He wondered if the boys would notice  anything queer about his walk. If they did, there was the conventional  excuse that his horse had fallen down with him--Happy Jack hoped that  it would be convincing. He took up the box again and looked at the  shining emptiness of it. It had been half full--not enough, by a long  way--and maybe some one would wonder what had become of it. Darn a  bunch that always had to know everything, anyway!    Happy Jack, warned at last by that unnamed instinct which tells of a  presence unseen, turned around and looked up apprehensively. The Happy  Family, sitting in a row upon their heels on the bank, looked down at  him gravely and appreciatively.    \"There's a can uh wagon dope, up at camp,\" Cal Emmett informed him  sympathetically.    \"Aw--\" Happy Jack began, and choked upon his humiliation.    \"I used to know a piece uh poetry about a fellow like Happy,\" Weary  remarked sweetly. \"It said        _'He raised his veil, the maid turned slowly round_      _Looked at him, shrieked, and fell upon the ground.'_    Only, in this case,\" Weary smiled blandly down upon him, \"Happy didn't  have no veil.\"    \"Aw, gwan!\" adjured Happy Jack helplessly, and reached for his  clothes, while the Happy Family chorused a demand for explanations.           *       *       *       *       *          A TAMER OF WILD ONES.      When the days grow crisp at each end and languorous in the middle;  when a haze ripples the skyline like a waving ribbon of faded blue;  when the winds and the grasses stop and listen for the first on-rush  of winter, then it is that the rangeland takes on a certain  intoxicating unreality, and range-wild blood leaps with desire to do  something--anything, so it is different and irresponsible and not  measured by precedent or prudence.    In days like that one grows venturesome and ignores difficulties and  limitations with a fine disregard for probable consequences, a mental  snapping of fingers. On a day like that, the Happy Family, riding  together out of Dry Lake with the latest news in mind and speech,  urged Andy Green, tamer of wild ones, to enter the rough-riding  contest exploited as one of the features of the Northern Montana Fair,  to be held at Great Falls in two weeks. Pink could not enter, because  a horse had fallen with him and hurt his leg, so that he was picking  the gentlest in his string for daily riding. Weary would not, because  he had promised his Little Schoolma'am to take care of himself and not  take any useless risks; even the temptation of a two-hundred-dollar  purse could not persuade him that a rough-riding contest is perfectly  safe and without the ban. But Andy, impelled by the leaping blood of  him and urged by the loyal Family, consented and said he'd try it a  whirl, anyway.    They had only ridden four or five miles when the decision was reached,  and they straightway turned back and raced into Dry Lake again, so  that Andy might write the letter that clinched matters. Then, whooping  with the sheer exhilaration of living, and the exultation of being  able to ride and whoop unhindered, they galloped back to camp and let  the news spread as it would. In a week all Chouteau County knew that  Andy Green would ride for the purse, and nearly all Chouteau County  backed him with all the money it could command; certainly, all of it  that knew Andy Green and had seen him ride, made haste to find someone  who did not know him and whose faith in another contestant was strong,  and to bet all the money it could lay hands upon.    For Andy was one of those mild-mannered men whose genius runs to  riding horses which object violently to being ridden; one of those  lucky fellows who never seems to get his neck broken, however much he  may jeopardize it; and, moreover, he was that rare genius, who can  make a \"pretty\" ride where other broncho-fighters resemble nothing so  much as a scarecrow in a cyclone. Andy not only could ride--he could  ride gracefully. And the reason for that, not many knew: Andy, in the  years before he wandered to the range, had danced, in spangled tights,  upon the broad rump of a big gray horse which galloped around a  saw-dust ring with the regularity of movement that suggested a  machine, while a sober-clothed man in the center cracked a whip and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13678"],[0,"Chapters on Jewish Literature (#13)"],[1,"  1850); I.

The greatest Jew of the Middle Ages, Moses, the son of Maimon, was born  in Cordova, in 1135, and died in Fostat in 1204. His father Maimon was  himself an accomplished scientist and an enlightened thinker, and the  son was trained in the many arts and sciences then included in a liberal  education. When Moses was thirteen years old, Cordova fell into the  hands of the Almohades, a sect of Mohammedans, whose creed was as pure  as their conduct was fanatical. Jews and Christians were forced to  choose conversion to Islam, exile, or death. Maimon fled with his  family, and, after an interval of troubled wanderings and painful  privations, they settled in Fez, where they found the Almohades equally  powerful and equally vindictive. Maimon and his son were compelled to  assume the outward garb of Mohammedanism for a period of five years.  From Fez the family emigrated in 1165 to Palestine, and, after a long  period of anxiety, Moses Maimonides settled in Egypt, in Fostat, or Old  Cairo.    In Egypt, another son of Maimon, David, traded in precious stones, and  supported his learned brother. When David was lost at sea, Maimonides  earned a living as a physician. His whole day was occupied in his  profession, yet he contrived to work at his books during the greater  part of the night. His minor works would alone have brought their author  fame. His first great work was completed in 1168. It was a Commentary on  the Mishnah, and was written in Arabic. But Maimonides' reputation rests  mainly on two books, the one written for the many, the other for the  few. The former is his \"Strong Hand\" (_Yad Hachazaka_), the latter his  \"Guide of the Perplexed\" (_Moreh Nebuchim_).    The \"Strong Hand\" was a gigantic undertaking. In its fourteen books  Maimonides presented a clearly-arranged and clearly-worded summary of  the Rabbinical Halachah, or Law. In one sense it is an encyclopedia, but  it is an encyclopedia written with style. For its power to grapple with  vast materials, this code has few rivals and no superiors in other  literatures. Maimonides completed its compilation in 1180, having spent  ten years over it. During the whole of that time, he was not only a  popular doctor, but also official Rabbi of Cairo. He received no salary  from the community, for he said, \"Better one penny earned by the work of  one's hands, than all the revenues of the Prince of the Captivity, if  derived from fees for teaching or acting as Rabbi.\" The \"Strong Hand,\"  called also \"Deuteronomy\" (_Mishneh Torah_), sealed the reputation of  Maimonides for all time. Maimonides was indeed attacked, first, because  he asserted that his work was intended to make a study of the Talmud  less necessary, and secondly, because he gave no authorities for his  statements, but decided for himself which Talmudical opinions to accept,  which to reject. But the severest scrutiny found few real blemishes and  fewer actual mistakes. \"From Moses to Moses there arose none like  Moses,\" was a saying that expressed the general reverence for  Maimonides. Copies of the book were made everywhere; the Jewish mind  became absorbed in it; his fame and his name \"rang from Spain to India,  from the sources of the Tigris to South Arabia.\" Eulogies were showered  on him from all parts of the earth. And no praise can say more for this  marvellous man than the fact that the incense burned at his shrine did  not intoxicate him. His touch became firmer, his step more resolute.  But he went on his way as before, living simply and laboring  incessantly, unmoved by the thunders of applause, unaffected by the  feebler echoes of calumny. He corresponded with his brethren far and  near, answered questions as Rabbi, explained passages in his Commentary  on the Mishnah or his other writings, entered heartily into the  controversies of the day, discussed the claims of a new aspirant to the  dignity of Messiah, encouraged the weaker brethren who fell under  disfavor because they had been compelled to become pretended converts to  Islam, showed common-sense and strong intellectual grasp in every line  he wrote, and combined in his dealings with all questions the rarely  associated qualities, toleration and devotion to the truth. Yet he felt  that his life's work was still incomplete. He loved truth, but truth for  him had two aspects: there was truth as revealed by God, there was truth  which God left man to discover for himself. In the mind of Maimonides,  Moses and Aristotle occupied pedestals side by side. In the \"Strong  Hand,\" he had codified and given orderly arrangement to Judaism as  revealed in Bible and tradition; he would now examine its relations to  reason, would compare its results with the data of philosophy. This he  did in his \"Guide of the Perplexed\" (_Moreh Nebuchim_). Maimonides here  differed fundamentally from his immediate predecessors. Jehuda Halevi,  in his _Cuzari_, was poet more than philosopher. The _Cuzari_ was a  dialogue based on the three principles, that God is revealed in history,  that Jerusalem is the centre of the world, and that Israel is to the  nations as the heart to the limbs. Jehuda Halevi supported these ideas  with arguments deduced from the philosophy of his day, he used reason as  the handmaid of theology. Maimonides, however, like Saadiah, recognized  a higher function for reason. He placed reason on the same level as  revelation, and then demonstrated that his faith and his reason taught  identical truths. His work, the \"Guide of the Perplexed,\" written in  Arabic in about the year 1190, is based, on the one hand, on the  Aristotelian system as expounded by Arabian thinkers, and, on the other  hand, on a firm belief in Scripture and tradition. With a masterly hand,  Maimonides summarized the teachings of Aristotle and the doctrines of  Moses and the Rabbis. Between these two independent bodies of truths he  found, not contradiction, but agreement, and he reconciled them in a way  that satisfied so many minds that the \"Guide\" was translated into Hebrew  twice during his life-time, and was studied by Mohammedans and by  Christians such as Thomas Aquinas. With general readers, the third part  was the most popular. In this part Maimonides offered rational  explanations of the ceremonial and legislative details of the Bible.    For a long time after the death of Maimonides, which took place in 1204,  Jewish thought found in the \"Guide\" a strong attraction or a violent  repulsion. Commentaries on the _Moreh_, or \"Guide,\" multiplied apace.  Among the most original of the philosophical successors of Maimonides  there were few Jews but were greatly influenced by him. Even the famous  author of \"The Wars of the Lord,\" Ralbag, Levi, the son of Gershon  (Gersonides), who was born in 1288, and died in 1344, was more or less  at the same stand-point as Maimonides. On the other hand, Chasdai  Crescas, in his \"Light of God,\" written between 1405 and 1410, made a  determined attack on Aristotle, and dealt a serious blow at Maimonides.  Crescas' work influenced the thought of Spinoza, who was also a close  student of Maimonides. A pupil of Crescas, Joseph Albo (1380-1444) was  likewise a critic of Maimonides. Albo's treatise, \"The Book of  Principles\" (_Ikkarim_), became a popular text-book. It was impossible  that the reconciliation of Aristotle and Moses should continue to  satisfy Jewish readers, when Aristotle had been dethroned from his  position of dictator in European thought. But the \"Guide\" of Maimonides  was a great achievement for its spirit more than for its contents. If it  inevitably became obsolete as a system of theology, it permanently acted  as an antidote to the mysticism which in the thirteenth century began to  gain a hold on Judaism, and which, but for Maimonides, might have  completely undermined the beliefs of the Synagogue. Maimonides remained  the exemplar of reasoning faith long after his particular form of  reasoning had become unacceptable to the faithful.          BIBLIOGRAPHY    MAIMONIDES.    Graetz.--III, 14.
