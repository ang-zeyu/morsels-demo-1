Now a very important question arises, for which I would for a moment  ask the close attention of your Lordships, because I am sure that both  here and elsewhere it will be argued that the necessity, and the facts  that caused the necessity, of bringing forward strong repressive  machinery should arrest our policy of reforms. That has been stated,  and I dare say many people will assent to it. Well, the Government of  India and myself have from the very first beginning of this unsettled  state of things, never varied in our determination to persevere in the  policy of reform.    I put two plain questions to your Lordships. I am sick of all the  retrograde commonplaces about the weakness of concession to violence  and so on. Persevering in our plan of reform is not a concession to  violence. Reforms that we have publicly announced, adopted, and worked  out for more than two years--how is it a concession to violence, to  persist in those reforms? It is simply standing to your guns. A number  of gentlemen, of whom I wish to speak with all respect, addressed a  very courteous letter to me the other day that appeared in the public  prints, exhorting me to remember that Oriental countries inevitably  and invariably interpret kindness as fear. I do not believe it. The  Founder of Christianity arose in an Oriental country, and when I am  told that Orientals always mistake kindness for fear, I must repeat  that I do not believe it, any more than I believe the stranger saying  of Carlyle, that after all the fundamental question between any two  human beings is--Can I kill thee, or canst thou kill me? I do not  agree that any organised society has ever subsisted upon either of  those principles, or that brutality is always present as a fundamental  postulate in the relations between rulers and ruled.    My first question is this. There are alternative courses open to us.  We can either withdraw our reforms, or we can persevere in them. Which  would be the more flagrant sign of weakness--to go steadily on with  your policy of reform in spite of bombs, or to let yourself openly  be forced by bombs and murder clubs to drop your policy? My second  question is--Who would be best pleased if I were to announce to your  Lordships that the Government have determined to drop the reforms?  Why, it is notorious that those who would be best pleased would be the  extremists and irreconcilables, just because they know well that for  us to do anything to soften estrangement, and appease alienation  between the European and native populations, would be the very best  way that could be adopted to deprive them of fuel for their sinister  and mischievous designs. I hope your Lordships will agree in that, and  I should like to add one reason which I am sure will weigh very much  with you. I do not know whether your Lordships have read the speech  made last Friday by Sir Norman Baker, the new Lieutenant-Governor of  Bengal, in the Council at Calcutta, dealing with the point that I am  endeavouring to present. In a speech of great power and force, he said  that these repressive measures did not represent even the major part  of the true policy dealing with the situation. The greater task, he  said, was to adjust the machinery of government, so that their Indian  fellow-subjects might be allotted parts which a self-respecting people  could fill, and that when the constitutional reforms were announced,  as they would be shortly, he believed that the task of restoring order  would be on the road to accomplishment. For a man holding such  a position to make such a statement at that moment, is all the  corroboration that we need for persisting in our policy of reform. I  have talked with Indian experts of all kinds concerning reforms. I  admit that some have shaken their heads; they did not like reforms  very warmly. But when I have asked, \"Shall we stand still, then?\"  there is not one of those experienced men who has not said, \"That is  quite impossible. Whatever else we do, we cannot stand still.\"    I should not be surprised if there are here some who say: You ought to  have some very strong machinery for putting down a free Press. A long  time ago a great Indian authority, Sir Thomas Munro, used language  which I will venture to quote, not merely for the purpose of this  afternoon's exposition, but in order that everybody who listens and  reads may feel the formidable difficulties that our predecessors have  overcome, and that we in our turn mean to try to overcome. Sir Thomas  Munro said--        \"We are trying an experiment never yet tried in the      world--maintaining a foreign dominion by means of a native army;      and teaching that army, through a free Press, that they ought to      expel us, and deliver their country.\"    He went on to say--        \"A tremendous revolution may overtake us, originating in a free      Press.\"    I recognise to the full the enormous force of a declaration of that  kind. But let us look at it as practical men, who have got to deal  with the government of the country. Supposing you abolish freedom of  the Press or suspend it, that will not end the business. You will  have to shut up schools and colleges, for what would be the use of  suppressing newspapers, if you do not shut the schools and colleges?  Nor will that be all. You will have to stop the printing of unlicensed  books. The possession of a copy of Milton, or Burke, or Macaulay,  or of Bright's speeches, and all that flashing array of writers and  orators who are the glory of our grand, our noble English tongue--the  possession of one of these books will, on this peculiar and puerile  notion of government, be like the possession of a bomb, and we shall  have to direct the passing of an Explosives Books Act. All this and  its various sequels and complements make a policy if you please. But  after such a policy had produced a mute, sullen, muzzled, lifeless  India, we could hardly call it, as we do now the brightest jewel in  the Imperial Crown. No English Parliament will ever permit such a  thing.    I do not think I need go through all the contents of the dispatch  of the Governor-General and my reply, containing the plan of His  Majesty's Government, which will be in your Lordships' hands very  shortly. I think your Lordships will find in them a well-guarded  expansion of principles that were recognised in 1861, and are still  more directly and closely connected with us now by the action of Lord  Lansdowne in 1892. I have his words, and they are really as true a key  to the papers in our hands as they were to the policy of the noble  Marquess at that date. He said--        \"We hope, however, that we have succeeded in giving to our      proposals a form sufficiently definite to secure a satisfactory      advance in the representation of the people in our legislative      Councils, and to give effect to the principle of selection as far      as possible on the advice of such sections of the community as are      likely to be capable of assisting us in that manner.\"    Then you will find that another Governor-General in Council in India,  whom I greatly rejoice to see still among us, my noble friend the  Marquess of Ripon, said in 1882--        \"It is not primarily with a view to the improvement of      administration, that this measure is put forward, it is chiefly      desirable as an instrument of political and popular education\"    The doctrines announced by the noble Marquess opposite, and by  my noble friend, are the standpoint from which we approached the  situation and framed our proposals.    I will not trouble the House by going through the history of the  course of the proceedings--that will be found in the Papers. I believe  the House will be satisfied, just as I am satisfied, with the candour  and patience that have been bestowed on the preparation of the scheme  in India, and I hope I may add it has been treated with equal patience  and candour here; and the end of it is that, though some points of  difference arose, though the Government of India agreed to drop  certain points of their scheme--the Advisory Councils, for example--on  the whole there was remarkable agreement between the Government of  India and myself as to the best way of dealing with these proceedings  as to Legislative Councils. I will enumerate the points very shortly,  and though I am afraid it may be tedious, I hope your Lordships will  not find the tedium unbearable, because, after all, what you are  beginning to consider to-day, is the turning over of a fresh leaf  in the history of British responsibility to India. There are only a  handful of distinguished members of this House who understand the  details of Indian Administration, but I will explain them as shortly  as I can.    This is a list of the powers which we shall have to acquire from  Parliament when we bring in a Bill. I may say that we do not propose  to bring in a Bill this session. That would be idle. I propose to  bring in a Bill next year. This is the first power we shall come  to Parliament for. At present the maximum and minimum numbers of  Legislative Councils are fixed by statute. We shall come to Parliament  to authorise an increase in the numbers of those Councils, both the  Viceroy's Council and the Provincial Councils. Secondly, the members  are now nominated by the head of the Government, either the Viceroy or  the Lieutenant-Governor. No election takes place in the strict sense  of the term. The nearest approach to it is the nomination by the  Viceroy, upon the recommendation of a majority of voters of certain  public bodies. We do not propose to ask Parliament to abolish  nomination. We do propose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10985"],[0,"The Infant System (#13)"],[1," particularly designed to amuse children, for  which reason they are generally represented during the Christmas  holidays, If, however, they were merely intended to _amuse_ them, they  who have introduced them have, perhaps, gained their object; but what  kind of _instruction_ they afford, I shall here attempt to shew. I  do not recollect to have seen a pantomime myself without _pilfering_  being introduced under every possible form, such as shop lifting,  picking pockets, &c. &c. Can it then be for a moment supposed  improbable that children, after having witnessed these exhibitions,  should endeavour to put the thing into practice, whenever an  opportunity offers, and try whether they cannot take a handkerchief  from a gentleman's pocket with the same ease and dexterity as the  clown in the play did; or, if unsuccessful in this part of the  business, that they should try their prowess in carrying off a  shoulder of mutton from a butcher's shop,--a loaf from a baker,--or  lighter articles from the pastry-cools, fruiterer, or linen-draper?  For, having seen the dexterity of the clown, in these cases, they will  not be at a loss for methods to accomplish, by sleight of hand, their  several purposes. In my humble opinion, children cannot go to a better  place for instruction in these matters, or to a place more calculated  to teach them the art of pilfering to perfection, than to the theatre,  when pantomimes are performed. To say that the persons who write and  introduce these pieces are in want of _sense_, may not be true; but I  must charge them with a want of sufficient thought, right feeling and  principle, in not calculating on their baneful effects on the rising  generation, for whose amusement it appears they are chiefly produced.  Many unfortunate persons, who have heard sentence of death passed upon  them, or who are now suffering under the law, in various ways, have  had to lament that the _first seeds of vice were sown in their minds  while viewing the pilfering tricks of clowns in pantomimes_. Alas!  too little do we calculate on the direful effects of this species of  amusement on the future character of the young. We first permit their  minds to be poisoned, by offering them the draught, and then punish  them by law for taking it. Does not the wide world afford a variety  of materials sufficient for virtuous imitation, without descending to  that which is vicious? It is much easier to make a pail of pure water  foul, than it is to make a pail of foul water pure. It must not be  supposed that I wish to sweep off every kind of amusement from the  juvenile part of society, but I do wish to sweep off all that has a  pernicious tendency. The limits which I have prescribed to myself will  not allow me to enter more at large into this subject; otherwise  I could produce a number of facts which would prove, most  unquestionably, the propriety of discontinuing these exhibitions.    A conversation which I once heard between some boys who were playing  at what is called _pitch-in-the-hole_, will prove the truth of my  assertions. \"Bill,\" said one of the boys to the other, \"when did you  go to the play last?\" \"On Monday night,\" was the reply. \"Did you see  the new pantomime?\"--\"Yes.\" \"Well, did you see any fun?\"--\"Yes, I  believe I did too. I saw the clown _bone_ a whole _hank_ of sausages,  and put them into his pocket, and then pour the gravy in after them.  You would have split your sides with laughing, had you been there.  A.B. and C.D. were with me, and they laughed as much as I did.  And what do you think A.B. did the next night?\"--\"How should I  know.\"--\"Why,\" replied the other, \"he and C.D. _boned_ about two  pounds of sausages from a pork shop, and we had them for supper.\" This  conversation I heard from a window, which looked into a ruinous place  where boys assembled to toss up for money, and other games. This fact  alone, without recording any more, is sufficient to show the evil of  which I have been speaking. And I do most sincerely hope that those  persons who have any influence over the stage, will use their utmost  endeavours, speedily, to expunge every thing thus calculated to  promote evil inclinations in the minds of children, and vicious habits  in the lives of men.    It is not impossible that scenic exhibitions might be made a most  powerful means of instruction to the young, and tend to promote virtue  and happiness, as well as be a means of rational amusement, but as  they now exist, their extirpation is desirable.    As I have had much experience from being brought up in London, I am  perfectly aware of the evil impressions and dangerous temptations that  the children of the poor are liable to fall into; and therefore most  solemnly affirm that nothing in my view would give so much happiness  to the community at large, as the taking care of the affections of the  infant children of the poor.    There is, moreover, a practice very prevalent among the poor, which  does greater mischief than the people are generally aware of, and that  is, sending their children to the _pawnbrokers_. It is well known that  many persons send children, scarcely seven years of age, to these  people, with pledges of various sorts, a thing that cannot be too  severely condemned. I know an instance of a little boy finding a shawl  in the street; and being in the habit of going to the pawnbroker's  for his mother, instead of taking the shawl home to his parents, he  actually pawned it and spent all the money, which might never have  been known by his parents, had not the mother found the duplicate in  his pocket. It is evident, then, that many parents have no one but  themselves to blame for the misconduct of their children; for had this  child not been accustomed to go to such a place _for his parents_, he  would never have thought of going there _for himself_; and the shawl  most likely would have been carried home to _them_. Indeed, there  is no knowing where such a system will end, for if the children are  suffered to go to such places, they may in time pledge that which does  not belong to them; and so easy is the way of turning any article  into money, that we find most young thieves, of both sexes, when  apprehended, have some duplicates about them. Those persons,  therefore, who take pledges of children (contrary to the act of  parliament, whether they know it or not,) ought to be severely  reprimanded; for I am persuaded, that such conduct is productive of  very great mischief indeed.    Taking children to _fairs_, is another thing which is also productive  of much harm. At the commencement of the first school, seventy or  eighty children were frequently absent whenever there was a fair near  London; but the parents were afterwards cured of this, and we seldom  had above twenty absentees at fair-time. Several of the children have  told me that their parents wished to take them, but they requested to  be permitted to come to school instead. Indeed the parents, finding  that they can enjoy themselves better without their children, are very  willing to leave them at school.    It is a difficult matter to persuade grown persons of the impropriety  of attending fairs, who have been accustomed to it when children;  but children are easily persuaded from it; for if they are properly  entertained at school, they will not have the least desire to go to  such places.    I cannot quit this subject without relating one or two more very bad  habits to which children are addicted, and which are, perhaps, fit  subjects for the consideration of the _Mendicity Society_. As it is  the object of that society to clear the streets of beggars, it would  be well if they would put a stop to those juvenile beggars, many of  whom are children of respectable parents, who assemble together  to build what they call a GROTTO; to the great annoyance of all  passengers in the street. However desirous persons may be of  encouraging ingenuity in children, I think it is doing them much harm  to give them money when they ask for it in this way. Indeed it would  appear, that some of the children have learned the art of begging so  well, that they are able to vie with the most experienced mendicants.  Ladies in particular are very much annoyed by children getting before  them and asking for money; nor will they take the answer given them,  but put their hats up to the ladies' faces, saying, \"Please, ma'am,  remember the grotto;\" and when told by the parties that they have  no money to give, they will still continue to follow, and be as  importunate as any common beggar. However innocent and trifling this  may appear to some, I am inclined to believe that such practices tend  to evil, for they teach children to be mean, and may cause some of  them to choose begging rather than work. I think that the best way to  stop this species of begging is, never to give them any thing. A fact  which came under my own observation will shew that the practice may  be productive of mischief. A foreign gentleman walking up Old Street  Road, was surrounded by three or four boys, saying, \"Please, sir,  remember the grotto.\"--\"Go away,\" was the reply, \"I will give you  none.\" To this followed, \"Do, pray sir, remember the grotto.\" \"No, I  tell you, I will give you nothing.\" \"Do, sir, only once a-year.\" At  length, I believe, he put something into one of their hats, and thus  got rid of them; but he had scarcely gone 200 yards, before he came  to another grotto, and out sallied three more boys, with the same  importunate request: he replied, \"I will give you nothing; plague have  you and your grotto.\" The boys however persevered, till the gentleman,  having lost all patience, gave one of them a gentle tap to get out of  the way, but the boy being on the side of the foot-path fell into the  mud, which had been scraped off the road, and in this pickle followed  the gentleman, bellowing out, \"That man knocked me down in the mud,  and I had done nothing to him.\""]]]
