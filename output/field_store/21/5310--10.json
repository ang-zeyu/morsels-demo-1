I had disliked  and distrusted Bedr el Gemaly, but I had associated my distaste for him  with Fenton's affairs. It had not occurred to me that Biddy's fears  meant more than a nervous woman's vague forebodings. During the few  hideous years of hide-and-seek she had passed in trying to protect the  traitor, Richard O'Brien, she had no doubt had real enough reason to  dread a spy in every stranger; but I had cheerfully advised her \"not to  be morbid\" when she spoke of herself as a dangerous companion, or  stopped me with a gasp in the midst of what seemed an innocent question  about her stepdaughter. Could it be possible that her alarms might  after all be justified, and that the powerful association betrayed by  O'Brien would visit his sins on his widow and daughter? That American  accent of Gemaly's! He admitted having been in New York. Of course, he  had made acquaintances there. My thoughts flashed back to the meeting  at the railway train. Could the fellow have found out in advance that I  was with Mrs. O'Brien, [alias Jones] and her friends? It seemed as if  such knowledge could have reached land ahead of us only by miracle. But  there was always Marconi. Perhaps news of Miss Gilder had been sent by  wireless to Alexandria, with our humbler names starred as satellites of  that bright planet. If this were so, Bedr, instructed from afar to  watch Richard O'Brien's widow, might easily have been clever enough to  suborn a messenger waiting for one Ernest Borrow.    \"What are you mumbling about?\" Anthony wanted to know, when I forgot to  answer. \"Have I put some idea that you don't like into your head?\"    \"I was turning your question over in it,\" I explained, \"and wondering  what to answer. Of course, Miss Gilder's rather important, and I  believe her father's obsession used to be when she was a child, that  she'd be kidnapped for ransom. The 'little sprite of a woman' you  admire so much, knew the Gilders in those days. She says that the  unfortunate baby used to be dragged about in a kind of caged  perambulator, and that some of her nurses were female detectives in  disguise, with revolvers under their white aprons. No wonder the girl  revels in emancipation and travel! I should think, now she's grown up  to twenty-one years and five foot eight or nine of height, without  being kidnapped, there's not much danger so long as she keeps in the  boundaries of civilization. Still, one never knows, in such a queer  world as ours, where newspapers live on happenings we'd laugh to scorn  if they came out of novel writers' brains.\"    \"That's the only incentive you can suggest for spying, unconnected with  my affairs?\"    I hesitated, for Biddy's secret was not my secret, and it seemed that I  had no right to pass it on, even to my best friend. I must ask Biddy's  permission before telling Fenton that Mrs. Jones was the widow of the  informer Richard O'Brien; that she feared over-subtlety on the part of  the enemy might confuse her girl travelling companion with Esme  O'Brien, hidden in a convent school near Monaco. \"It's just credible  that there may be other incentives,\" I said. \"But I must confess, I'd  rather believe that Armenian spies were on the track of Ahmed Antoun,  who can take care of himself, than after poor Miss Gilder or--any of  her party.\"    \"What's the name of the laughing sprite?\" suddenly asked Fenton.    \"Mrs.--er--Jones. Brigit Jones.\"    \"Where's her husband?\"    \"In his grave.\"    \"Oh! Well, his widow looks ready to bubble over with the joy of life,  so I suppose we can't associate spies or anything shady with her?  That's too much to hope for?\"    \"Why to 'hope' for?\"    \"It would make her too interesting.\"    \"Look here, my dear fellow, you can't have them both!\"    The dark eyes of Antoun lit with a spark of surprise and laughter. \"I  don't want either, thanks. I admire flowers, but I never gather them. I  leave them growing. However, you might tell me which one you want for  your own buttonhole?\" \"Really, I don't know,\" I mumbled, taken aback.  \"All I do know is, it's not likely I can get either.\"    Anthony stared at me with a curious expression, then abruptly changed  the subject. \"You've heard of Sir Marcus Lark?\" he asked.    \"Of course,\" said I, surprised at this question sandwiched into our  affairs. Sir Marcus Lark is a man who has had his finger in many pies,  but I didn't see how he could poke one into ours. Everybody knows Sir  M. A. Lark, given a baronetcy by the Radicals some years ago in return  for services to the party--starting and running a newspaper which must  have cost him fifty thousand pounds before it began to pay. He has  financed theatres, and vegetarian restaurants; he owns cocoa  plantations and factories, and a garden city; he has a racing yacht  which once beat the German Emperor's; he owns two hotels; he has  written a book of travel; his name as a director is sought by financial  companies; he has lent money to a distressed South American government  in the making; and though the success of his enterprises has sometimes  hung in the balance for months or years, his wonderful luck seems  invariably to triumph in the end; so much so, that \"Lark's Luck\" has  become a well-known heading for newspaper columns, in the middle of  which his photograph is inset. At the mention of his name, the oft-seen  picture rose before my eyes--a big man, anywhere between thirty-six and  fifty--good head, large forehead, curly hair, kind eyes, pugnacious  nose, conceited smile under waxed moustache, heavy jaw, unconquerable  chin, and prize-fighter's neck and shoulders. \"What has Sir Marcus Lark  to do with us?\" \"He's in Egypt--in Cairo just now; and--he's got our  mountain.\"    \"Good heavens!\" I stared blankly at Anthony, seeing not his dark face  under the green turban, but that everlasting, ever-smiling newspaper  block portrait. Down toppled our castle in the air, Anthony's and  mine--the shining castle which had been the lodestone of my journey to  Egypt, the secret hope and romance of our two lives, for all those  months since Anthony first read the Ferlini papers and began  negotiations with the Egyptian Government.    \"It's all up then,\" I said, when I felt that I could speak without  betraying palsy of the jaw. \"We're done!\"    \"I'm not sure of that,\" Fenton answered. \"If I had been, I shouldn't  have broken the news so brutally. It's on the cards that we may be able  to bring the thing off yet.\"    \"But how, if that bounder has got the place for himself? He must have  found out the truth about it somehow, or he wouldn't have bothered. And  if he knows what we know--or think we know--he certainly won't give up  to us what he's grabbed for himself. A beastly shame we should have  been let in like this, after being given to understand that it would be  all right.\"    \"Lark must have had a pull of some sort, I haven't learned what; but I  will. The one hope is, that he hasn't stumbled onto the secret.\"    \"What! You think he hit on our pitch by a mere coincidence--an  accident?\"    \"No. There's not a shadow of doubt that he had a special motive for  wanting _our_ mountain and no other.\" \"Have you formed an idea what the  motive is, if not the same as ours?\"    \"I've heard his version from his own lips. It's rather astounding. And  I want you to hear it from him, too.\"    \"You've met him!\"    \"Yesterday at Shepheard's, before I went in for this dressing-up  business. Lark heard I had wired for a room at the hotel, and was lying  in wait for me on the terrace when I got back from the Agency. We had a  talk. I'd heard just before, the news about the mountain. But he  explained. Now he wants to see you. He's got something special to say,  and I've made an appointment for you with him at two o'clock.\"          CHAPTER VI    THE GREAT SIR MARCUS      The appointment was at the Semiramis Hotel, where Sir Marcus Lark was  staying. I went with my mind an aching void, and my heart a cold boiled  potato. I can think of nothing more disagreeable! For not a word more  would Fenton let drop as to the great man's business with us or the  Mountain of the Golden Pyramid.    I sent up my card, and a few minutes later was shown into a private  salon more appropriate to a beautiful young duchess than to a middle-aged,  bumptious financier. It was pale green and white, full of lilies  and fragrance, and an immense French window opened out upon a roofed  loggia overlooking the Nile. This would have been the ideal environment  for our Gilded Rose; and I felt more venomous than before, if possible,  toward the rich bounder who posed against such an unsuitable  background. I thought, as the door of the salon was opened for me by  the smart Arab servant, that the room was untenanted, and that Sir  Marcus Lark meant to keep me waiting; but there he was, on the balcony,  gazing in rapture at the shining river. As if he were capable of  raptures, he, an earth-bound worm! But there was no mistaking that  back, those shoulders, or the face, as the big body turned. He advanced  through the open window, holding out a hand as big as a steak. He was  exactly like his photograph, except that there was even more of him  than I had been led to expect. The pretty room was net small, but  entering, he seemed to turn it into a doll's house parlour. \"Six foot  two, if he's an inch!\" I said to myself, longing to play David to his  Goliath. \"Big, rich, common brute!\" I thought. \"You snatch our mountain  out of our mouths, and then you send for us as if we were servants--men  whose boots you ought to be blacking!\" I was vindictive. I stared him  straight between the eyes--where a stone from David's sling would have  fitted in neatly.    The eyes were wide apart, and kinder than in the photographs. They were  even curiously innocent, and boyish. His grin of greeting made the  large, waxed black"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#12)"],[1,"you in German as well as with a revolver.\"    \"We thought it was German,\" rejoined Levy, with dexterity. \"It might  'ave been 'Industani or 'Eathen Chinee for all I know! But there was no  error about the revolver. I can see it covering me, and his shooting eye  looking along the barrel into mine--as plainly as I'm looking into yours  now, Mr. Raffles.\"    Raffles laughed outright.    \"I hope I'm a pleasanter spectacle, Mr. Levy? I remember your telling me  that the other fellow looked the most colossal cut-throat.\"    \"So he did,\" said Levy; \"he looked a good deal worse than he need to have  done. His face was blackened and disguised, but his teeth were as white  as yours are.\"    \"Any other little point in common?\"    \"I had a good look at the hand that pointed the revolver.\"    Raffles held out his hands.    \"Better have a good look at mine.\"    \"His were as black as his face, but even yours are no smoother or  better kept.\"    \"Well, I hope you'll clap the bracelets on them yet, Mr. Levy.\"    \"You'll get your wish, I promise you, Mr. Raffles.\"    \"You don't mean to say you've spotted your man?\" cried A.J. airily.    \"I've got my eye on him!\" replied Dan Levy, looking Raffles through  and through.    \"And won't you tell us who he is?\" asked Raffles, returning that deadly  look with smiling interest, but answering a tone as deadly in one that  maintained the note of persiflage in spite of Daniel Levy.    For Levy alone had changed the key with his last words; to that point I  declare the whole passage might have gone for banter before the keenest  eyes and the sharpest ears in Europe. I alone could know what a duel the  two men were fighting behind their smiles. I alone could follow the finer  shades, the mutual play of glance and gesture, the subtle tide of covert  battle. So now I saw Levy debating with himself as to whether he should  accept this impudent challenge and denounce Raffles there and then. I saw  him hesitate, saw him reflect. The crafty, coarse, emphatic face was  easily read; and when it suddenly lit up with a baleful light, I felt we  might be on our guard against something more malign than mere reckless  denunciation.    \"Yes!\" whispered a voice I hardly recognised. \"Won't you tell us  who it was?\"    \"Not yet,\" replied Levy, still looking Raffles full in the eyes. \"But I  know all about him now!\"    I looked at Miss Belsize; she it was who had spoken, her pale face set,  her pale lips trembling. I remembered her many questions about Raffles  during the morning. And I began to wonder whether after all I was the  only entirely understanding witness of what had passed here in the  firelit hall.    Mr. Garland, at any rate, had no inkling of the truth. Yet even in that  kindly face there was a vague indignation and distress, though it passed  almost as our eyes met. Into his there had come a sudden light; he sprang  up as one alike rejuvenated and transfigured; there was a quick step in  the porch, and next instant the truant Teddy was in our midst.    Mr. Garland met him with outstretched hand but not a question or a  syllable of surprise; it was Teddy who uttered the cry of joy, who stood  gazing at his father and raining questions upon him as though they had  the hall to themselves. What was all this in the evening papers? Who had  put it in? Was there any truth in it at all?    \"None, Teddy,\" said Mr. Garland, with some bitterness; \"my health was  never better in my life.\"    \"Then I can't understand it,\" cried the son, with savage simplicity. \"I  suppose it's some rotten practical joke; if so, I would give something to  lay hands on the joker!\"    His father was still the only one of us he seemed to see, or could bring  himself to face in his distress. Not that young Garland had the  appearance of one who had been through fresh vicissitudes; on the  contrary, he looked both trimmer and ruddier than overnight; and in his  sudden fit of passionate indignation, twice the man that one remembered  so humiliated and abased.    Raffles came forward from the fireside.    \"There are some of us,\" said he, \"who won't be so hard on the beggar  for bringing you back from Lord's at last! You must remember that I'm  the only one here who has been up there at all, or seen anything of  you all day.\"    Their eyes met; and for one moment I thought that Teddy Garland was going  to repudiate this cool _suggestio falsi_, and tell us all where he had  really been; but that was now impossible without giving Raffles away, and  then there was his Camilla in evident ignorance of the disappearance  which he had expected to find common property. The double circumstance  was too strong for him; he took her hand with a confused apology which  was not even necessary. Anybody could see that the boy had burst among us  with eyes for his father only, and thoughts of nothing but the report  about his health; as for Miss Belsize, she looked as though she liked him  the better for it, or it may have been for an excitability rare in him  and rarely becoming. His pink face burnt like a flame. His eyes were  brilliant; they met mine at last, and I was warmly greeted; but their  friendly light burst into a blaze of wrath as almost simultaneously they  fell upon his bugbear in the background.    \"So you've kept your threat, Mr. Levy!\" said young Garland, quietly  enough once he had found his voice.    \"I generally do,\" remarked the money-lender, with a malevolent laugh.    \"His threat!\" cried Mr. Garland sharply. \"What are you talking  about, Teddy?\"    \"I will tell you,\" said the young man. \"And you, too!\" he added almost  harshly, as Camilla Belsize rose as though about to withdraw. \"You may as  well know what I am--while there's time. I got into debt--I borrowed from  this man.\"    \"You borrowed from him?\"    It was Mr. Garland speaking in a voice hard to recognise, with an  emphasis harder still to understand; and as he spoke he glared at Levy  with new loathing and abhorrence.    \"Yes,\" said Teddy; \"he had been pestering me with his beastly circulars  every week of my first year at Cambridge. He even wrote to me in his own  fist. It was as though he knew something about me and meant getting me in  his clutches; and he got me all right in the end, and bled me to the last  drop as I deserved. I don't complain so far as I'm concerned. It serves  me right. But I did mean to get through without coming to you again,  father! I was fool enough to tell him so the other day; that was when he  threatened to come to you himself. But I didn't think he was such a brute  as to come to-day!\"    \"Or such a fool?\" suggested Raffles, as he put a piece of paper into  Teddy's hands.    It was his own original promissory note, the one we had recovered from  Dan Levy in the morning. Teddy glanced at it, clutched Raffles by the  hand, and went up to the money-lender as though he meant to take him by  the throat before us all.    \"Does this mean that we're square?\" he asked hoarsely.    \"It means that you are,\" replied Dan Levy.    \"In fact it amounts to your receipt for every penny I ever owed you?\"    \"Every penny that you owed me, certainly.\"    \"Yet you must come to my father all the same; you must have it both  ways--your money and your spite as well!\"    \"Put it that way if you like,\" said Levy, with a shrug of his massive  shoulders. \"It isn't the case, but what does that matter so long as  you're 'appy?\"    \"No,\" said Teddy through his teeth; \"nothing matters now that I've come  back in time.\"    \"In time for what?\"    \"To turn you out of the house if you don't clear out this instant!\"    The great gross man looked upon his athletic young opponent, and folded  his arms with a guttural chuckle.    \"So you mean to chuck me out, do you?\"    \"By all my gods, if you make me, Mr. Levy! Here's your hat; there's the  door; and never you dare to set foot in this house again.\"    The money-lender took his shiny topper, gave it a meditative polish with  his sleeve, and actually went as bidden to the threshold of the porch;  but I saw the suppression of a grin beneath the pendulous nose, a cunning  twinkle in the inscrutable eyes, and it did not astonish me when the  fellow turned to deliver a Parthian shot. I was only surprised at the  harmless character of the shot.    \"May I ask whose house it is?\" were his words, in themselves notable  chiefly for the aspirates of undue deliberation.    \"Not mine, I know; but I'm the son of the house,\" returned Teddy  truculently, \"and out you go!\"    \"Are you so sure that it's even your father's house?\" inquired Levy with  the deadly suavity of which he was capable when he liked. A groan from  Mr. Garland confirmed the doubt implied in the words.    \"The whole place is his,\" declared the son, with a sort of nervous  scorn--\"freehold and everything.\"    \"The whole place happens to be _mine_--'freehold and everything!'\"  replied Levy, spitting his iced poison in separate syllables. \"And as for  clearing out, that'll be your job, and I've given you a week to do it  in--the two of you!\"    He stood a moment in the open doorway, towering in his triumph, glaring  on us all in turn, but at Raffles longest and last of all.    \"And you needn't think you're going to save the old man,\" came with  a passionate hiss, \"like you did the son--_because I know all about  you now_!\"          CHAPTER VIII    The State of the Case      Of course I made all decent haste from the distressing scene, and of  course Raffles stayed behind at the solicitation of his unhappy friends.  I was sorry to desert him in view of one aspect of the case; but I was  not sorry to dine quietly at the club after the alarms and excitements  of that disastrous day. The strain had been the greater after sitting up  all night, and I for one could barely realise all that had happened in  the twenty-four hours. It seemed incredible that the same midsummer  night and day should have seen the return of Raffles and our orgy at the  club to which"]]]
