With respect to the _loss_ of _liberty_, which is the second  consideration in the punishment, it is evident that men bear nothing  worse; that there is nothing, that they lay more at heart; and that they  have shewn, by many and memorable instances, that even death is to be  preferred. How many could be named here, who, having suffered the  _loss_ of _liberty_, have put a period to their existence! How  many, that have willingly undergone the hazard of their lives to destroy  a tyrant! How many, that have even gloried to perish in the attempt! How  many bloody and publick wars have been undertaken (not to mention the  numerous _servile_ insurrections, with which history is stained)  for the cause of _freedom_!    But if nothing is dearer than _liberty_ to men, with which, the  barren rock is able to afford its joys, and without which, the glorious  fun shines upon them but in vain, and all the sweets and delicacies of  life are tasteless and unenjoyed; what punishment can be more severe  than the loss of so great a blessing? But if to this _deprivation_  of _liberty_, we add the agonizing pangs of _banishment_; and  if to the complicated stings of both, we add the incessant _stripes,  wounds_, and _miseries_, which are undergone by those, who are  sold into this horrid _servitude_; what crime can we possibly  imagine to be so enormous, as to be worthy of so great a punishment?    How contrary then to reason, justice, and nature, must those act, who  apply this, the severest of human punishments, to the most insignificant  offence! yet such is the custom with the Africans: for, from the time,  in which the Europeans first intoxicated the African princes with their  foreign draughts, no crime has been committed, no shadow of a crime  devised, that has not immediately been punished with _servitude_.    But for what purpose is the punishment applied? Is it applied to amend  the manners of the criminal, and thus render him a better subject? No,  for if you banish him, he can no longer be a subject, and you can no  longer therefore be solicitous for his morals. Add to this, that if you  banish him to a place, where he is to experience the hardships of want  and hunger (so powerfully does hunger compel men to the perpetration of  crimes) you force him rather to corrupt, than amend his manners, and to  be wicked, when he might otherwise be just.    Is it applied then, that others may be deterred from the same  proceedings, and that crimes may become less frequent? No, but that  _avarice_ may be gratified; that the prince may experience the  emoluments of the sale: for, horrid and melancholy thought! the more  crimes his subjects commit, the richer is he made; the more  _abandoned_ the subject, the _happier_ is the prince!    Neither can we allow that the punishment thus applied, tends in any  degree to answer _publick happiness_; for if men can be sentenced  to slavery, right or wrong; if shadows can be turned into substances,  and virtues into crimes; it is evident that none can be happy, because  none can be secure.    But if the punishment is infinitely greater than the offence, (which has  been shewn before) and if it is inflicted, neither to amend the  criminal, nor to deter others from the same proceedings, nor to advance,  in any degree, the happiness of the publick, it is scarce necessary to  observe, that it is totally unjust, since it is repugnant to  _reason_, the dictates of _nature_, and the very principles of  _government_.             *        *        *        *        *        CHAP. VII.    We come now to the fourth and last order of slaves, to _prisoners of  war_. As the _sellers_ lay a particular stress on this order of  men, and infer much, from its _antiquity_, in support of the  justice of their cause, we shall examine the principle, on which it  subsisted among the ancients. But as this principle was the same among  all nations, and as a citation from many of their histories would not be  less tedious than unnecessary, we shall select the example of the Romans  for the consideration of the case.    The law, by which prisoners of war were said to be sentenced to  servitude, was the _law of nations_[043]. It was so called from the  universal concurrence of nations in the custom. It had two points in  view, the _persons_ of the _captured_, and their _effects_; both  of which it immediately sentenced, without any of the usual  forms of law, to be the property of the _captors_.    The principle, on which the law was established, was the _right of  capture_. When any of the contending parties had overcome their  opponents, and were about to destroy them, the right was considered to  commence; a right, which the victors conceived themselves to have, to  recall their swords, and, from the consideration of having saved the  lives of the vanquished, when they could have taken them by the laws of  war, to commute _blood_ for _service_. Hence the Roman lawyer,  Pomponius, deduces the etymology of _slave_ in the Roman language.  \"They were called _servi_[044], says he, from the following  circumstance. It was usual with our commanders to take them prisoners,  and sell them: now this circumstance implies, that they must have been  previously _preserved_, and hence the name.\" Such then was the  _right of capture_. It was a right, which the circumstance of  _taking_ the vanquished, that is, of _preserving_ them alive,  gave the conquerors to their persons. By this right, as always including  the idea of a previous preservation from death, the vanquished were said  _to be slaves_[045]; and, \"as all slaves,\" says Justinian, \"are  themselves in the power of others, and of course can have nothing of  their own, so their effects followed the condition of their persons, and  became the property of the captors.\"    To examine this right, by which the vanquished were said to be slaves,  we shall use the words of a celebrated Roman author, and apply them to  the present case[046]. \"If it is lawful,\" says he, \"to deprive a man of  his life, it is certainly not inconsistent with nature to rob him;\" to  rob him of his liberty. We admit the conclusion to be just, if the  supposition be the same: we allow, if men have a right to commit that,  which is considered as a greater crime, that they have a right, at the  same instant, to commit that, which is considered as a less. But what  shall we say to the _hypothesis_? We deny it to be true. The voice  of nature is against it. It is not lawful to kill, but on  _necessity_. Had there been a necessity, where had the wretched  captive survived to be broken with chains and servitude? The very act of  saving his life is an argument to prove, that no such necessity existed.  The _conclusion_ is therefore false. The captors had no right to  the _lives_ of the captured, and of course none to their  _liberty_: they had no right to their _blood_, and of course  none to their _service_. Their right therefore had no foundation in  justice. It was founded on a principle, contrary to the law of nature,  and of course contrary to that law, which people, under different  governments, are bound to observe to one another.    It is scarce necessary to observe, as a farther testimony of the  injustice of the measure, that the Europeans, after the introduction of  Christianity, exploded this principle of the ancients, as frivolous and  false; that they spared the lives of the vanquished, not from the sordid  motives of _avarice_, but from a conscientiousness, that homicide  could only be justified by _necessity_; that they introduced an  _exchange_ of prisoners, and, by many and wise regulations,  deprived war of many of its former horrours.    But the advocates for slavery, unable to defend themselves against these  arguments, have fled to other resources, and, ignorant of history, have  denied that the _right of capture_ was the true principle, on which  slavery subsisted among the ancients. They reason thus. \"The learned  Grotius, and others, have considered slavery as the just consequence of  a private war, (supposing the war to be just and the opponents in a  state of nature), upon the principles of _reparation_ and  _punishment_. Now as the law of nature, which is the rule of  conduct to individuals in such a situation, is applicable to members of  a different community, there is reason to presume, that these principles  were applied by the ancients to their prisoners of war; that their  _effects_ were confiscated by the right of _reparation_, and  their _persons_ by the right of _punishment_.\"--    But, such a presumption is false. The _right of capture_ was the  only argument, that the ancients adduced in their defence. Hence  Polybius; \"What must they, (the Mantinenses) suffer, to receive the  punishment they deserve? Perhaps it will be said, _that they must be  sold, when they are taken, with their wives and children into  slavery_: But this is not to be considered as a punishment, since  even those suffer it, by the laws of war, who have done nothing that is  base.\" The truth is, that both the _offending_ and the _offended_  parties, whenever they were victorious, inflicted slavery  alike. But if the _offending_ party inflicted slavery on  the persons of the vanquished, by what right did they inflict it? It  must be answered from the presumption before-mentioned, \"by the right of  _reparation_, or of _punishment:_\" an answer plainly absurd  and contradictory, as it supposes the _aggressor_ to have a  _right_, which the _injured_ only could possess.    Neither is the argument less fallacious than the presumption, in  applying these principles, which in a _publick_ war could belong to  the _publick_ only, to the persons of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10633"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#13)"],[1,"sequence, we sacrifice our reason, our humanity, our      Christianity, to an unnatural sordid gain. We teach other      nations to despise and trample under foot all the obligations of      social virtue. We take the most effectual method to prevent the      propagation of the Gospel, by representing it as a scheme of      power and barbarous oppression, and an enemy to the natural      privileges and rights of man.\"        \"Perhaps all that I have now offered may be of very little      weight to restrain this enormity, this aggravated iniquity.      However, I shall still have the satisfaction of having entered      my private protest against a practice which, in my opinion, bids      that God, who is the God and Father of the Gentiles unconverted      to Christianity, most daring and bold defiance, and spurns at      all the principles both of natural and revealed religion.\"      The next author is Sir Richard Steele, who, by means of the affecting  story of Inkle and Yarico, holds up this trade again to our abhorrence.    In the year 1735, Atkins, who was a surgeon in the navy, published his  _Voyage to Guinea, Brazil, and the West Indies, in his Majesty's ships  Swallow and Weymouth_. In this work he describes openly the manner of  making the natives slaves, such as by kidnapping, by unjust accusations  and trials, and by other nefarious means. He states also the cruelties  practised upon them by the white people, and the iniquitous ways and  dealings of the latter, and answers their argument, by which they  insinuated that the condition of the Africans was improved by their  transportation to other countries.    From this time, the trade beginning to be better known, a multitude of  persons of various stations and characters sprung up, who by exposing  it, are to be mentioned among the forerunners and coadjutors in the  cause.    Pope, in his _Essay on Man_, where he endeavours to show that happiness  in the present depends, among other things, upon the hope of a future  state, takes an opportunity of exciting compassion in behalf of the poor  African, while he censures the avarice and cruelty of his master:--        Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutored mind    Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;    His soul proud Science never taught to stray    Far as the solar walk, or milky-way;    Yet simple Nature to his hope was given    Behind the cloud-topt hill an humbler heaven;    Some safer world in depth of woods embraced,    Some happier island in the watery waste,    Where slaves once more their native land behold,    No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.      Thomson also, in his _Seasons_, marks this traffic as destructive and  cruel, introducing the well-known fact of sharks following the vessels  employed in it:--        Increasing still the sorrows of those storms,    His jaws horrific arm'd with three-fold fate,    Here dwells the direful shark. Lured by the scent    Of steaming crowds, of rank disease, and death;    Behold! he rushing cuts the briny flood,    Swift as the gale can bear the ship along,    And from the partners of that cruel trade;    Which spoils unhappy Guinea of her sons,    Demands his share of prey, demands themselves.    The stormy fates descend: one death involves    Tyrants and slaves; when straight their mangled limbs    Crashing at once, he dyes the purple seas    With gore, and riots in the vengeful meal.      Neither was Richard Savage forgetful in his poems of the _Injured  Africans_: he warns their oppressors of a day of retribution for their  barbarous conduct. Having personified Public Spirit, he makes her speak  on the subject in the following manner:--        Let by my specious name no tyrants rise,    And cry, while they enslave, they civilize!    Know, Liberty and I are still the same    Congenial--ever mingling flame with flame!    Why must I Afric's sable children see    Vended for slaves, though born by nature free,    The nameless tortures cruel minds invent    Those to subject whom Nature equal meant?    If these you dare (although unjust success    Empowers you now unpunished, to oppress),    Revolving empire you and yours may doom--    (Rome all subdu'd--yet Vandals vanquish'd Rome)    Yes--Empire may revolt--give them the day,    And yoke may yoke, and blood may blood repay.      Wallis, in his _System of the Laws of Scotland_, maintains, that  \"neither men nor governments have a right to sell those of their own  species. Men and their liberty are neither purchaseable nor saleable.\"  And, after arguing the case, he says, \"This is the law of nature, which  is obligatory on all men, at all times, and in all places.--Would not  any of us, who should be snatched by pirates from his native land, think  himself cruelly abused, and at all times entitled to be free? Have not  these unfortunate Africans, who meet with the same cruel fate, the same  right? Are they not men as well as we? And have they not the same  sensibility? Let us not, therefore, defend or support an usage, which is  contrary to all the laws of humanity.\"    In the year 1750, the reverend Griffith Hughes, rector of St. Lucy, in  Barbados, published his Natural History of that island. He took an  opportunity, in the course of it, of laying open to the world the  miserable situation of the poor Africans, and the waste of them by hard  labour and other cruel means, and he had the generosity to vindicate  their capacities from the charge, which they who held them in bondage  brought against them, as a justification of their own wickedness in  continuing to deprive them of the rights of men.    Edmund Burke, in his account of the European settlements, (for this work  is usually attributed to him,) complains \"that the Negroes in our  colonies endure a slavery more complete, and attended with far worse  circumstances, than what any people in their condition suffer, in any  other part of the world, or have suffered in any other period of time.  Proofs of this are not wanting. The prodigious waste, which we  experience in this unhappy part of our species, is a full and melancholy  evidence of this truth.\" And he goes on to advise the planters, for the  sake of their own interest, to behave like good men, good masters, and  good Christians, and to impose less labour upon their slaves, and to  give them recreation on some of the grand festivals, and to instruct  them in religion, as certain preventives of their decrease.    An anonymous author of a pamphlet, entitled, _An Essay in Vindication of  the Continental Colonies of America_, seems to have come forward next.  Speaking of slavery there, he says, \"It is shocking to humanity,  violative of every generous sentiment, abhorrent utterly from the  Christian religion.--There cannot be a more dangerous maxim than that  necessity is a plea for injustice, for who shall fix the degree of this  necessity? What villain so atrocious, who may not urge this excuse, or,  as Milton has happily expressed it,      And with necessity,    The tyrant's plea, excuse his devilish deed?      \"That our colonies,\" he continues, \"want people, is a very weak argument  for so inhuman a violation of justice.--Shall a civilized, a Christian  nation encourage slavery, because the barbarous, savage, lawless African  hath done it? To what end do we profess a religion whose dictates we so  flagrantly violate? Wherefore have we that pattern of goodness and  humanity, if we refuse to follow it? How long shall we continue a  practice which policy rejects, justice condemns, and piety revolts at?\"    The poet Shenstone, who comes next in order, seems to have written an  elegy on purpose to stigmatize this trade. Of this elegy I shall copy  only the following parts:--        See the poor native quit the Libyan shores,    Ah! not in love's delightful fetters bound!    No radiant smile his dying peace restores,    No love, nor fame, nor friendship, heals his wound.      Let vacant bards display their boasted woes;    Shall I the mockery of grief display?    No; let the muse his piercing pangs disclose,    Who bleeds and weeps his sum of life away!      On the wild heath in mournful guise he stood,    Ere the shrill boatswain gave the hated sign;    He dropt a tear unseen into the flood,    He stole one secret moment to repine--      \"Why am I ravish'd from my native strand?    What savage race protects this impious gain?    Shall foreign plagues infest this teeming land,    And more than sea-born monsters plough the main?      Here the dire locusts' horrid swarms prevail;    Here the blue asps with livid poison swell;    Here the dry dipsa writhes his sinuous mail;    Can we not here secure from envy dwell?      When the grim lion urged his cruel chase,    When the stern panther sought his midnight prey;    What fate reserved me for this Christian race?    O race more polished, more severe than they!      Yet shores there are, bless'd shores for us remain,    And favour'd isles, with golden fruitage crown'd,    Where tufted flow'rets paint the verdant plain,    And every breeze shall medicine every wound.\"      In the year 1755, Dr. Hayter, bishop of Norwich, preached a sermon  before the _Society for the Propagation of the Gospel_, in which he bore  his testimony against the continuance of this trade.    Dyer, in his poem called _The Fleece_, expresses his sorrow on account  of this barbarous trade, and looks forward to a day of retributive  justice on account of the introduction of such an evil.    In the year 1760, a pamphlet appeared, entitled, _Two Dialogues on the  Man-trade_, by John Philmore. This name is supposed to be an assumed  one. The author, however, discovers himself to have been both an able  and a zealous advocate in favour of the African race.    Malachi Postlethwaite, in his _Universal Dictionary of Trade and  Commerce_, proposes a number of queries on the subject of the Slave  Trade.
