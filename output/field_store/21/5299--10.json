[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#12)"],[1," tonight, if the King enters alone  by that gate, turns to the right, and walks twenty yards, he will find  a summerhouse, approached by a flight of six steps. If he mounts and  enters, he will find someone who will tell him what touches most dearly  his life and his throne. This is written by a faithful friend. He must  be alone. If he neglects the invitation his life will be in danger. Let  him show this to no one, or he will ruin a woman who loves him: Black  Michael does not pardon.\"    \"No,\" observed Sapt, as I ended, \"but he can dictate a very pretty  letter.\"    I had arrived at the same conclusion, and was about to throw the letter  away, when I saw there was more writing on the other side.    \"Hallo! there's some more.\"    \"If you hesitate,\" the writer continued, \"consult Colonel Sapt--\"    \"Eh,\" exclaimed that gentleman, genuinely astonished. \"Does she take me  for a greater fool than you?\"    I waved to him to be silent.    \"Ask him what woman would do most to prevent the duke from marrying his  cousin, and therefore most to prevent him becoming king? And ask if her  name begins with--A?\"    I sprang to my feet. Sapt laid down his pipe.    \"Antoinette de Mauban, by heaven!\" I cried.    \"How do you know?\" asked Sapt.    I told him what I knew of the lady, and how I knew it. He nodded.    \"It's so far true that she's had a great row with Michael,\" said he,  thoughtfully.    \"If she would, she could be useful,\" I said.    \"I believe, though, that Michael wrote that letter.\"    \"So do I, but I mean to know for certain. I shall go, Sapt.\"    \"No, I shall go,\" said he.    \"You may go as far as the gate.\"    \"I shall go to the summer-house.\"    \"I'm hanged if you shall!\"    I rose and leant my back against the mantelpiece.    \"Sapt, I believe in that woman, and I shall go.\"    \"I don't believe in any woman,\" said Sapt, \"and you shan't go.\"    \"I either go to the summer-house or back to England,\" said I.    Sapt began to know exactly how far he could lead or drive, and when he  must follow.    \"We're playing against time,\" I added. \"Every day we leave the King  where he is there is fresh risk. Every day I masquerade like this, there  is fresh risk. Sapt, we must play high; we must force the game.\"    \"So be it,\" he said, with a sigh.    To cut the story short, at half-past eleven that night Sapt and I  mounted our horses. Fritz was again left on guard, our destination not  being revealed to him. It was a very dark night. I wore no sword, but I  carried a revolver, a long knife, and a bull's-eye lantern. We arrived  outside the gate. I dismounted. Sapt held out his hand.    \"I shall wait here,\" he said. \"If I hear a shot, I'll--\"    \"Stay where you are; it's the King's only chance. You mustn't come to  grief too.\"    \"You're right, lad. Good luck!\"    I pressed the little gate. It yielded, and I found myself in a wild sort  of shrubbery. There was a grass-grown path and, turning to the right as  I had been bidden, I followed it cautiously. My lantern was closed, the  revolver was in my hand. I heard not a sound. Presently a large dark  object loomed out of the gloom ahead of me. It was the summer-house.  Reaching the steps, I mounted them and found myself confronted by a  weak, rickety wooden door, which hung upon the latch. I pushed it open  and walked in. A woman flew to me and seized my hand.    \"Shut the door,\" she whispered.    I obeyed and turned the light of my lantern on her. She was in evening  dress, arrayed very sumptuously, and her dark striking beauty was  marvellously displayed in the glare of the bull's-eye. The summer-house  was a bare little room, furnished only with a couple of chairs and a  small iron table, such as one sees in a tea garden or an open-air cafe.    \"Don't talk,\" she said. \"We've no time. Listen! I know you, Mr.  Rassendyll. I wrote that letter at the duke's orders.\"    \"So I thought,\" said I.    \"In twenty minutes three men will be here to kill you.\"    \"Three--the three?\"    \"Yes. You must be gone by then. If not, tonight you'll be killed--\"    \"Or they will.\"    \"Listen, listen! When you're killed, your body will be taken to a low  quarter of the town. It will be found there. Michael will at once  arrest all your friends--Colonel Sapt and Captain von Tarlenheim  first--proclaim a state of siege in Strelsau, and send a messenger to  Zenda. The other three will murder the King in the Castle, and the duke  will proclaim either himself or the princess--himself, if he is strong  enough. Anyhow, he'll marry her, and become king in fact, and soon in  name. Do you see?\"    \"It's a pretty plot. But why, madame, do you--?\"    \"Say I'm a Christian--or say I'm jealous. My God! shall I see him marry  her? Now go; but remember--this is what I have to tell you--that never,  by night or by day, are you safe. Three men follow you as a guard. Is it  not so? Well, three follow them; Michael's three are never two hundred  yards from you. Your life is not worth a moment if ever they find you  alone. Now go. Stay, the gate will be guarded by now. Go down softly, go  past the summer-house, on for a hundred yards, and you'll find a ladder  against the wall. Get over it, and fly for your life.\"    \"And you?\" I asked.    \"I have my game to play too. If he finds out what I have done, we shall  not meet again. If not, I may yet--But never mind. Go at once.\"    \"But what will you tell him?\"    \"That you never came--that you saw through the trick.\"    I took her hand and kissed it.    \"Madame,\" said I, \"you have served the King well tonight. Where is he in  the Castle?\"    She sank her voice to a fearful whisper. I listened eagerly.    \"Across the drawbridge you come to a heavy door; behind that lies--Hark!  What's that?\"    There were steps outside.    \"They're coming! They're too soon! Heavens! they're too soon!\" and she  turned pale as death.    \"They seem to me,\" said I, \"to be in the nick of time.\"    \"Close your lantern. See, there's a chink in the door. Can you see  them?\"    I put my eye to the chink. On the lowest step I saw three dim figures. I  cocked my revolver. Antoinette hastily laid her hand on mine.    \"You may kill one,\" said she. \"But what then?\"    A voice came from outside--a voice that spoke perfect English.    \"Mr. Rassendyll,\" it said.    I made no answer.    \"We want to talk to you. Will you promise not to shoot till we've done?\"    \"Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Detchard?\" I said.    \"Never mind names.\"    \"Then let mine alone.\"    \"All right, sire. I've an offer for you.\"    I still had my eye to the chink. The three had mounted two steps more;  three revolvers pointed full at the door.    \"Will you let us in? We pledge our honour to observe the truce.\"    \"Don't trust them,\" whispered Antoinette.    \"We can speak through the door,\" said I.    \"But you might open it and fire,\" objected Detchard; \"and though we  should finish you, you might finish one of us. Will you give your honour  not to fire while we talk?\"    \"Don't trust them,\" whispered Antoinette again.    A sudden idea struck me. I considered it for a moment. It seemed  feasible.    \"I give my honour not to fire before you do,\" said I; \"but I won't let  you in. Stand outside and talk.\"    \"That's sensible,\" he said.    The three mounted the last step, and stood just outside the door. I  laid my ear to the chink. I could hear no words, but Detchard's head was  close to that of the taller of his companions (De Gautet, I guessed).    \"H'm! Private communications,\" thought I. Then I said aloud:    \"Well, gentlemen, what's the offer?\"    \"A safe-conduct to the frontier, and fifty thousand pounds English.\"    \"No, no,\" whispered Antoinette in the lowest of whispers. \"They are  treacherous.\"    \"That seems handsome,\" said I, reconnoitering through the chink. They  were all close together, just outside the door now.    I had probed the hearts of the ruffians, and I did not need Antoinette's  warning. They meant to \"rush\" me as soon as I was engaged in talk.    \"Give me a minute to consider,\" said I; and I thought I heard a laugh  outside.    I turned to Antoinette.    \"Stand up close to the wall, out of the line of fire from the door,\" I  whispered.    \"What are you going to do?\" she asked in fright.    \"You'll see,\" said I.    I took up the little iron table. It was not very heavy for a man of my  strength, and I held it by the legs. The top, protruding in front of  me, made a complete screen for my head and body. I fastened my closed  lantern to my belt and put my revolver in a handy pocket. Suddenly I saw  the door move ever so slightly--perhaps it was the wind, perhaps it was  a hand trying it outside.    I drew back as far as I could from the door, holding the table in the  position that I have described. Then I called out:    \"Gentlemen, I accept your offer, relying on your honour. If you will  open the door--\"    \"Open it yourself,\" said Detchard.    \"It opens outwards,\" said I. \"Stand back a little, gentlemen, or I shall  hit you when I open it.\"    I went and fumbled with the latch. Then I stole back to my place on  tiptoe.    \"I can't open it!\" I cried. \"The latch has caught.\"    \"Tut! I'll open it!\" cried Detchard. \"Nonsense, Bersonin, why not? Are  you afraid of one man?\"    I smiled to myself. An instant later the door was flung back. The gleam  of a lantern showed me the three close together outside, their  revolvers levelled. With a shout, I charged at my utmost pace across the  summer-house and through the doorway. Three shots rang out and battered  into my shield. Another moment, and I leapt out and the table caught  them full and square, and in a tumbling, swearing, struggling mass, they  and I and that brave table, rolled down the steps of the summerhouse to  the ground below. Antoinette de Mauban shrieked, but I rose to my feet,  laughing aloud.    De Gautet and Bersonin lay like men stunned. Detchard was under the  table, but, as I rose, he pushed it from him and fired again. I raised  my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/950"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Runabout; Or, The Speediest Car on the Road (#12)"],[1,"told that Tom  Swift still lived.    Mr. Damon never guided a car better than he did his auto that day.  Several speed laws were broken, but no one appeared to stop them, and,  in record time they had the young inventor at the physician's house.  Fortunately Dr. Whiteside was at home, and, under his skillful  treatment Tom was soon out of danger. His heart action was properly  started, and then it was only a question of time. As the doctor had  plenty of room it was decided to let the lad remain that night, and Tom  was soon installed in a spare bedroom, with the doctor's pretty  daughter to wait on him occasionally.    \"Oh, I'm all right,\" the youth insisted, when Miss Whiteside told him  it was time for his medicine. \"I'm all right.\"    \"You're not!\" she declared. \"I ought to know, for I'm going to be a  nurse, some day, and help papa. Now take this or I'll have to hold your  nose, as they do the baby's,\" and she held out a spoonful of unpleasant  looking mixture, extending her dainty forefinger and thumb of her other  hand, as if to administer dire punishment to Tom, if he did not obey.    \"Well, I give in to superior strength,\" he said with a laugh, as he  noted, with approval, the laughing face of his nurse.    Then he fell into a deep sleep, and was so much better the next morning  that he could be taken home in Mr. Damon's auto.    \"But mind, no hard work for three or four days,\" insisted the  physician. \"I want your heart to get in shape for that big race you  were telling me about. The shock was a severe strain to it.\"    Tom promised, reluctantly, and, though he did no work, his first act,  on reaching home, was to go out to the shop, to inspect the battery and  motor. To his surprise the motor was running for the lad had  established the connection, in spite of his shock and his father and  Mr. Sharp had decided to let the machinery run until he came back.    \"And look at the record it's made!\" cried Tom delightedly as he glanced  at the gauge. \"Better than I figured on. That battery is a wonder. I'll  have the fastest electric runabout you ever saw.\"    \"If the wires don't get crossed again,\" put in Mr. Sharp.  \"You'd  better make an examination, Tom,\" and, for the first time, the young  inventor learned how he had been shocked.    \"Crossed wires! I should say they were crossed!\" he exclaimed as he  looked at the switches and copper conductors. \"Somebody has been  tampering with them. No wonder I was shocked!\"    \"Who did it?\" asked Mr. Sharp.    Tom considered for a moment, before answering. Then he said:    \"I believe it was Addison Berg. He must have wanted to do some damage,  to get even with us for getting that treasure away from him.\"    \"Berg?\" questioned the balloonist, and Tom told of the night he had  been tripped into the brook, and exhibited the watch charm he had  secured. Mr. Sharp recognized it at once. A further examination  confirmed the belief that the submarine agent had sneaked into Tom's  workshop, and had altered the wires.    \"They were all right when I came out of the shop that night,\" declared  Tom. \"I left the old connections just as I thought I had arranged them,  and only added the new ones, when I went to try my battery. The old  connections were crossed, but I didn't notice it. Then when I turned on  the current I got the shock. I don't s'pose Berg thought I'd be so  nearly killed. Probably he wanted to burn out my motor, and spoil it.  If it was Andy Foger I could understand it, but a man like Berg--\"    \"He's probably wild with anger because his submarine got the worst of  it in the race for the gold,\" interrupted the balloonist. \"Well, we'll  have to be on our guard, that's all.  What was the matter with  Eradicate, that he didn't see him enter the shop?\"    \"Rad went to a colored dance that night,\" said Tom. \"I let him off. But  after this I'll have the shop guarded night and day. My motor might  have been ruined, if that first charge hadn't gone through my body  instead of into the machinery.\"  The improper connections were soon  removed and others substituted.    It was agreed between Tom and Mr. Sharp that they would say nothing  regarding Mr. Berg to Mr. Swift. The aeronaut caused cautious inquiries  to be made, and learned that the agent had been discharged by the  submarine firm, because of some wrong-doing in connection with the  craft Wonder, and it was surmised that the agent believed Tom to be at  the bottom of his troubles.    In a few days the young inventor was himself again, and as further  trials of his battery showed it to be even better than its owner hoped,  arrangements were made for testing it in the car on the road.    The runabout was nearly finished, but it lacked a coat of varnish, and  some minor details, when Tom, assisted by his father, Mr. Sharp and Mr.  Jackson, one morning, about a week later, installed the motor and  battery units. It did not take long to gear up the machinery, connect  the battery and, though the car was rather a crude looking affair, Tom  decided to give it a tryout.    \"Want to come along, Dad?\" he asked, as he tightened up some binding  posts, and looked to see that the steering wheel, starting and reverse  levers worked properly, and that the side chains were well lubricated.    \"Not the first time,\" replied his father. \"Let's see how it runs with  you, first.\"    \"Oh, I want some sort of a load in it,\" went on the lad. \"It won't be a  good test unless I have a couple of others besides myself. How about  you, Mr. Damon?\" for the old gentleman was spending a few days at the  Swift homestead.    \"Bless my shoe buttons! I'll come!\" was the ready answer.  \"After the  experience I've been through in the airship and submarine, nothing can  scare me. Lead on, I'll follow!\"    \"I don't suppose you'll hang back after that; will you, Mr. Sharp?\"  asked the lad, with a laugh.    \"I don't dare to, for the sake of my reputation,\" was the reply, for  the balloonist who had made many ascensions, and dropped thousands of  feet in parachutes, was naturally a brave man.    So he and Mr. Damon climbed into the rear seats of the odd-looking  electric car, while Tom took his place at the steering wheel.    \"Are you all ready?\" he asked.    \"Let her go!\" fired back Mr. Sharp.    \"Bless my galvanometer, don't go too fast on the start,\" cautioned Mr.  Damon, nervously.    \"I'll not,\" agreed the young inventor. \"I want to get it warmed up  before I try any speeding.\"    He turned on the current. There was a low, humming purr, which  gradually increased to a whine, and the car moved slowly forward.  It  rolled along the gravel driveway to the road, Tom listening to every  sound of the machinery, as a mother listens to the breathing of a child.    \"She's moving!\" he cried.    \"But not much faster than a wheelbarrow,\" said his father, who  sometimes teased his son.    \"Wait!\" cried the youth.    Tom turned more current into the motor. The purring and humming  increased, and the car seemed to leap forward. It was in the road now,  and, once assured that the steering apparatus was working well, Tom  suddenly turned on much more speed.    So quickly did the electric auto shoot forward that Mr. Damon and Mr.  Sharp were jerked back against the cushions of the rear seats.    \"Here! What are you doing?\" inquired Mr. Sharp.    \"I'm going to show you a little speed,\" answered Tom.    The car was now moving rapidly, and there was a smoothness and  lightness to its progress that was absent from a gasolene auto.  There  was no vibration from the motor. Faster and faster it ran, until it was  moving at a speed scarcely less than that of Mr. Damon's car, when it  was doing its best. Of course that was not saying much, for the car  owned by the odd gentleman was not a very powerful one, but it could  make fast time occasionally.    \"Is this the best you can do?\" asked Mr. Damon. \"Not that it isn't  fast,\" he hastened to add, \"and I was wondering if it was your limit.\"    \"Not half!\" cried Tom, as he turned on a little more power.  \"I'm not  trying for a record to-day. I just want to see how the battery and  motor behaves.\"    \"Pretty well, I should say,\" commented Mr. Sharp.    \"I'm satisfied--so far,\" agreed the lad.    They were now moving along the highway at a good speed--moving almost  silently, too, for the motor, save for a low hum, made no noise. So  quiet was the car, in fact, that it was nearly the cause of a disaster.  Tom was so interested in the performance of his latest invention, that,  before he knew it, he had come up behind a farmer, driving a team of  skittish horses. As the big machine went past them, giving no warning  of its approach, the steeds reared up, and would have bolted, but for  the prompt action of the driver.    \"Hey!\" he cried, angrily, as Tom speeded past, \"don't you know you got  to give warnin' when you're comin' with one of them ther gol-swizzled  things! By Jehossephat I'll have th' law on ye ef ye do thet ag'in!\"    \"I forgot to ring the bell,\" apologized Tom, as he sent out a peal from  the gong, and then, he let out a few more amperes, and the speed  increased.    \"Hold on! I guess this is fast enough!\" cried Mr. Damon, as his hat  blew off.    \"Fast?\" answered Tom. \"This is nothing to what I'll do when I use the  full power. Then I'll--\"    He was interrupted by a sharp report, and a vivid flash of fire on a  switch board near the steering wheel. The motor gave a sort of groan,  and stopped, the car rolling on a little way, and then becoming  stationary.    \"Bless my collar button!\" ejaculated Mr. Damon.    \"What's the matter?\" inquired Mr. Sharp.    \"Some sort of a blow-out,\" answered Tom ruefully, as he shoved the  starting handle over, trying to move the car. But it would not budge.  The new auto had \"gone dead\" on her first tryout. The young inventor  was grievously disappointed.          CHAPTER XIII    TOWED BY A MULE      \"Bless my gizzard! Is it anything serious?\" asked Mr. Damon.  \"Will it"]]]
