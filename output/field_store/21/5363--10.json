This is an ancient system  which the British government has never interfered with, and any  attempt to modify or change it would undoubtedly be resisted.  At the same time the rents are largely regulated by the taxes.  These customs, which have come down from the Mogul empire, have  been defined and strengthened by time and experience. Nearly  every province has its own and different laws and customs on  the subject, but the variation is due not to legislation, but  to public sentiment. The tenant as well as the landlord insists  that the assessments of taxes shall be made before the rent rate  is determined, and this occurs in almost every province, although  variations in rent and changes of proprietorship and tenantry  very seldom occur. Wherever there has been a change during the  present generation it has been in favor of the tenants. The rates  of rent and taxation naturally vary according to the productive  power of the land, the advantages of climate and rainfall, the  facilities for reaching market and other conditions. But the  average tax represents about two-thirds of a rupee per acre, or  21 cents in American money.    We have been accustomed to consider India a great wheat producing  country, and you often hear of apprehension on the part of American  political economists lest its cheap labor and enormous area should  give our wheat growers serious competition. But there is not  the slightest ground for apprehension. While the area planted  to wheat in India might be doubled, and farm labor earns only  a few cents a day, the methods of cultivation are so primitive  and the results of that cheap labor are comparatively so small,  that they can never count seriously against our wheat farms which  are tilled and harvested with machinery and intelligence. No  article in the Indian export trade has been so irregular or has  experienced greater vicissitudes than wheat. The highest figure  ever reached in the value of exports was during the years 1891-92,  when there was an exceptional crop, and the exports reached  $47,500,000. The average for the preceding ten years was $25,970,000,  while the average for the succeeding ten years, ending 1901-02,  was only $12,740,000. This extraordinary decrease was due to  the failure of the crop year after year and the influence of  the famines of 1897 and 1900. The bulk of the wheat produced  in India is consumed within the districts where it is raised,  and the average size of the wheat farms is less than five acres.  More than three-fourths of the India wheat crop is grown on little  patches of ground only a few feet square, and sold in the local  markets. The great bulk of the wheat exported comes from the large  farms or is turned in to the owners of land rented to tenants  for shares of the crops produced.    The coal industry is becoming important. There are 329 mines  in operation, which yielded 7,424,480 tons during the calendar  year of 1902, an increase of nearly 1,000,000 tons in the five  years ending 1903. It is a fair grade of bituminous coal and  does well for steaming purposes. Twenty-eight per cent of the  total output was consumed by the local railway locomotives in  1902, and 431,552 tons was exported to Ceylon and other neighboring  countries. The first mine was opened in India as long ago as  1820, but it was the only one worked for twenty years, and the  development of the industry has been very slow, simply keeping  pace with the increase of railways, mills, factories and other  consumers. But the production is entirely sufficient to meet  the local demand, and only 23,417 tons was imported in 1902,  all of which came as ballast. The industry gives employment to  about 98,000 persons. Most of the stock in the mining companies  is owned by private citizens of India. The prices in Calcutta  and Bombay vary from $2.30 to $2.85 a ton.    India is rich in mineral deposits, but few of them have been  developed, chiefly on account of the lack of capital and enterprise.  After coal, petroleum is the most important item, and in 1902  nearly 57,000,000 gallons was refined and sold in the India market,  but this was not sufficient to meet half the demand, and about  81,000,000 gallons was imported from the United States and Russia.    Gold mining is carried on in a primitive way in several of the  provinces, chiefly by the washing of river sand. Valuable gold  deposits are known to exist, but no one has had the enterprise  or the capital to undertake their development, simply because  costly machinery is required and would call for a heavy investment.  Most of the gold washing is done by natives with rude, home-made  implements, and the total production reported for 1902 was 517,639  ounces, valued at $20 an ounce. This, however, does not tell  more than half the story. It represents only the amount of gold  shipped out of the country, while at least as much again, if  not more, was consumed by local artisans in the manufacture of  the jewelry which is so popular among the natives. When a Hindu  man or woman gets a little money ahead he or she invariably buys  silver or gold ornaments with it, instead of placing it in a  savings bank or making other investments. Nearly all women and  children that you see are loaded with silver ornaments, their  legs and feet as well as their hands and arms, and necklaces of  silver weighing a pound or more are common. Girdles of beautifully  wrought silver are sometimes worn next to the bare skin by ordinary  coolies working on the roads or on the docks of the rivers, and  in every town you visit you will find hundreds of shops devoted  to the sale of silver and gold adornments of rude workmanship  but put metal. The upper classes invest their savings in gold  and precious stones for similar reasons. There is scarcely a  family of the middle class without a jewel case containing many  articles of great value, while both the men and women of the rich  and noble castes own and wear on ceremonial occasions amazing  collections of precious stones and gold ornaments which have  been handed down by their ancestors who invested their surplus  wealth in them at a time when no safe securities were to be had  and savings banks had not been introduced into India. A large  proportion of the native gold is consumed by local artisans in  the manufacture of these ornaments, and is not counted in the  official returns. An equal amount, perhaps, is worked up into  gold foil and used for gilding temples, palaces and the houses  of the rich. Like all orientals, the Indians are very fond of  gilding, and immense quantities of pure gold leaf are manufactured  in little shops that may be seen in every bazaar you visit.    India now ranks second among the manganese ore producing countries  of the world, and has an inexhaustible supply of the highest  grade. The quality of the ores from the central provinces permits  their export in the face of a railway haul of 500 miles and sea  transportation to England, Belgium, Germany and the United States,  but, speaking generally, the mineral development of India has  not yet begun.          V    TWO HINDU WEDDINGS    There was a notable wedding at Baroda, the capital of one of the  Native States of the same name, while we were in India, and the  Gaikwar, as the ruling prince is called, expressed a desire for us  to be present. He has a becoming respect for and appreciation of  the influence and usefulness of the press, and it was a pleasure  to find so sensible a man among the native rulers. But, owing  to circumstances over which we had no control, we had to deny  ourselves the gratification of witnessing an event which few  foreigners have ever been allowed to see. It is a pity winter  is so short in the East, for there are so many countries one  cannot comfortably visit any other time of year.    Baroda is a non-tributary, independent native state of the first  rank, lying directly north of the province of Bombay, and its  ruler is called a \"gaikwar,\" which signifies \"cowherd,\" and the  present possessor of that title is one of the biggest men in the  empire, one of the richest and one of the greatest swells. He  is entitled to a salute of twenty-one guns, an honor conferred  upon only two other native princes, the Maharajah of Mysore and  the Nizam of Hyderabad. He is one of the ablest and one of the  most progressive of the native princes. His family trace their  descent back to the gods of mythology, but he is entirely human  himself, and a handsome man of middle age. When we saw him for  the first time he had half a dozen garlands of flowers hanging  around his neck, and three or four big bouquets in his hand,  which, according to the custom of the country, had been presented  to him by affectionate friends. It was he who presented to the City  of Bombay the beautiful statue of Queen Victoria which ornaments  the principal public square. It is one of the finest monuments to  be seen anywhere, and expressed his admiration of his empress,  who had shown particular interest in his career. The present  gaikwar was placed upon the throne in 1874 by Lord Northbrook,  when he was Viceroy of India, to succeed Malhar Rao, one of those  fantastic persons we read about in fairy stories but seldom find  in real life. For extravagant phantasies and barbaric splendors  he beat the world. He surpassed even those old spendthrifts of  the Roman Empire, Nero, Caligula and Tiberius. He spent a million  of rupees to celebrate the marriage ceremonies of a favorite  pigeon of his aviary, which was mated with one belonging to his  prime minister. But the most remarkable of his extravagant freaks  was a rug and two pillow covers of pearls, probably the greatest  marvel of all fabrics that were ever woven since the world was  made.    The carpet, ten feet six inches by six feet"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11224"],[0,"Utilitarianism (#13)"],[1,"this should be done by the tribunals. We forego that  gratification on account of incidental inconveniences. We should be glad  to see just conduct enforced and injustice repressed, even in the  minutest details, if we were not, with reason, afraid of trusting the  magistrate with so unlimited an amount of power over individuals. When  we think that a person is bound in justice to do a thing, it is an  ordinary form of language to say, that he ought to be compelled to do  it. We should be gratified to see the obligation enforced by anybody who  had the power. If we see that its enforcement by law would be  inexpedient, we lament the impossibility, we consider the impunity given  to injustice as an evil, and strive to make amends for it by bringing a  strong expression of our own and the public disapprobation to bear upon  the offender. Thus the idea of legal constraint is still the generating  idea of the notion of justice, though undergoing several transformations  before that notion, as it exists in an advanced state of society,  becomes complete.    The above is, I think, a true account, as far as it goes, of the origin  and progressive growth of the idea of justice. But we must observe, that  it contains, as yet, nothing to distinguish that obligation from moral  obligation in general. For the truth is, that the idea of penal  sanction, which is the essence of law, enters not only into the  conception of injustice, but into that of any kind of wrong. We do not  call anything wrong, unless we mean to imply that a person ought to be  punished in some way or other for doing it; if not by law, by the  opinion of his fellow creatures; if not by opinion, by the reproaches of  his own conscience. This seems the real turning point of the distinction  between morality and simple expediency. It is a part of the notion of  Duty in every one of its forms, that a person may rightfully be  compelled to fulfil it. Duty is a thing which may be _exacted_ from a  person, as one exacts a debt. Unless we think that it might be exacted  from him, we do not call it his duty. Reasons of prudence, or the  interest of other people, may militate against actually exacting it; but  the person himself, it is clearly understood, would not be entitled to  complain. There are other things, on the contrary, which we wish that  people should do, which we like or admire them for doing, perhaps  dislike or despise them for not doing, but yet admit that they are not  bound to do; it is not a case of moral obligation; we do not blame them,  that is, we do not think that they are proper objects of punishment. How  we come by these ideas of deserving and not deserving punishment, will  appear, perhaps, in the sequel; but I think there is no doubt that this  distinction lies at the bottom of the notions of right and wrong; that  we call any conduct wrong, or employ instead, some other term of dislike  or disparagement, according as we think that the person ought, or ought  not, to be punished for it; and we say that it would be right to do so  and so, or merely that it would be desirable or laudable, according as  we would wish to see the person whom it concerns, compelled or only  persuaded and exhorted, to act in that manner.[C]    This, therefore, being the characteristic difference which marks off,  not justice, but morality in general, from the remaining provinces of  Expediency and Worthiness; the character is still to be sought which  distinguishes justice from other branches of morality. Now it is known  that ethical writers divide moral duties into two classes, denoted by  the ill-chosen expressions, duties of perfect and of imperfect  obligation; the latter being those in which, though the act is  obligatory, the particular occasions of performing it are left to our  choice; as in the case of charity or beneficence, which we are indeed  bound to practise, but not towards any definite person, nor at any  prescribed time. In the more precise language of philosophic jurists,  duties of perfect obligation are those duties in virtue of which a  correlative right resides in some person or persons; duties of imperfect  obligation are those moral obligations which do not give birth to any  right. I think it will be found that this distinction exactly coincides  with that which exists between justice and the other obligations of  morality. In our survey of the various popular acceptations of justice,  the term appeared generally to involve the idea of a personal right--a  claim on the part of one or more individuals, like that which the law  gives when it confers a proprietary or other legal right. Whether the  injustice consists in depriving a person of a possession, or in breaking  faith with him, or in treating him worse than he deserves, or worse than  other people who have no greater claims, in each case the supposition  implies two things--a wrong done, and some assignable person who is  wronged. Injustice may also be done by treating a person better than  others; but the wrong in this case is to his competitors, who are also  assignable persons. It seems to me that this feature in the case--a  right in some person, correlative to the moral obligation--constitutes  the specific difference between justice, and generosity or beneficence.  Justice implies something which it is not only right to do, and wrong  not to do, but which some individual person can claim from us as his  moral right. No one has a moral right to our generosity or beneficence,  because we are not morally bound to practise those virtues towards any  given individual. And it will be found, with respect to this as with  respect to every correct definition, that the instances which seem to  conflict with it are those which most confirm it. For if a moralist  attempts, as some have done, to make out that mankind generally, though  not any given individual, have a right to all the good we can do them,  he at once, by that thesis, includes generosity and beneficence within  the category of justice. He is obliged to say, that our utmost exertions  are due to our fellow creatures, thus assimilating them to a debt; or  that nothing less can be a sufficient _return_ for what society does for  us, thus classing the case as one of gratitude; both of which are  acknowledged cases of justice. Wherever there is a right, the case is  one of justice, and not of the virtue of beneficence: and whoever does  not place the distinction between justice and morality in general where  we have now placed it, will be found to make no distinction between them  at all, but to merge all morality in justice.    Having thus endeavoured to determine the distinctive elements which  enter into the composition of the idea of justice, we are ready to enter  on the inquiry, whether the feeling, which accompanies the idea, is  attached to it by a special dispensation of nature, or whether it could  have grown up, by any known laws, out of the idea itself; and in  particular, whether it can have originated in considerations of general  expediency.    I conceive that the sentiment itself does not arise from anything which  would commonly, or correctly, be termed an idea of expediency; but that,  though the sentiment does not, whatever is moral in it does.    We have seen that the two essential ingredients in the sentiment of  justice are, the desire to punish a person who has done harm, and the  knowledge or belief that there is some definite individual or  individuals to whom harm has been done.    Now it appears to me, that the desire to punish a person who has done  harm to some individual, is a spontaneous outgrowth from two sentiments,  both in the highest degree natural, and which either are or resemble  instincts; the impulse of self-defence, and the feeling of sympathy.    It is natural to resent, and to repel or retaliate, any harm done or  attempted against ourselves, or against those with whom we sympathize.  The origin of this sentiment it is not necessary here to discuss.  Whether it be an instinct or a result of intelligence, it is, we know,  common to all animal nature; for every animal tries to hurt those who  have hurt, or who it thinks are about to hurt, itself or its young.  Human beings, on this point, only differ from other animals in two  particulars. First, in being capable of sympathizing, not solely with  their offspring, or, like some of the more noble animals, with some  superior animal who is kind to them, but with all human, and even with  all sentient beings. Secondly, in having a more developed intelligence,  which gives a wider range to the whole of their sentiments, whether  self-regarding or sympathetic. By virtue of his superior intelligence,  even apart from his superior range of sympathy, a human being is capable  of apprehending a community of interest between himself and the human  society of which he forms a part, such that any conduct which threatens  the security of the society generally, is threatening to his own, and  calls forth his instinct (if instinct it be) of self-defence. The same  superiority of intelligence, joined to the power of sympathizing with  human beings generally, enables him to attach himself to the collective  idea of his tribe, his country, or mankind, in such a manner that any  act hurtful to them rouses his instinct of sympathy, and urges him to  resistance.    The sentiment of justice, in that one of its elements which consists of  the desire to punish, is thus, I conceive, the natural feeling of  retaliation or vengeance, rendered by intellect and sympathy applicable  to those injuries, that is, to those hurts, which wound us through, or  in common with, society at large. This sentiment, in itself, has nothing  moral in it; what is moral is, the exclusive subordination of it to the  social sympathies, so as to wait on and obey their call. For the natural  feeling tends to make us resent indiscriminately whatever any one does  that is"]]]
