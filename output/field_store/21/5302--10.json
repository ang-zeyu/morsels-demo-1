The children quickly discovered the strangers and  ran toward them with exclamations of astonishment, so that Trot and her  friends became the center of a curious group, all chattering excitedly.  Cap'n Bill's wooden leg seemed to arouse the wonder of the children, as  they could not understand why he had not two meat legs. This attention  seemed to please the old sailor, who patted the heads of the children  kindly and then, raising his hat to the woman, he inquired:    \"Can you tell us, madam, just what country this is?\"    She stared hard at all three of the strangers as she replied briefly:  \"Jinxland.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Cap'n Bill, with a puzzled look. \"And where is  Jinxland, please?\"    \"In the Quadling Country,\" said she.    \"What!\" cried Trot, in sudden excitement. \"Do you mean to say this is  the Quadling Country of the Land of Oz?\"    \"To be sure I do,\" the woman answered. \"Every bit of land that is  surrounded by the great desert is the Land of Oz, as you ought to know  as well as I do; but I'm sorry to say that Jinxland is separated from  the rest of the Quadling Country by that row of high mountains you see  yonder, which have such steep sides that no one can cross them. So we  live here all by ourselves, and are ruled by our own King, instead of  by Ozma of Oz.\"    \"I've been to the Land of Oz before,\" said Button-Bright, \"but I've  never been here.\"    \"Did you ever hear of Jinxland before?\" asked Trot.    \"No,\" said Button-Bright.    \"It is on the Map of Oz, though,\" asserted the woman, \"and it's a fine  country, I assure you. If only,\" she added, and then paused to look  around her with a frightened expression. \"If only--\" here she stopped  again, as if not daring to go on with her speech.    \"If only what, ma'am?\" asked Cap'n Bill.    The woman sent the children into the house. Then she came closer to the  strangers and whispered: \"If only we had a different King, we would be  very happy and contented.\"    \"What's the matter with your King?\" asked Trot, curiously. But the  woman seemed frightened to have said so much. She retreated to her  porch, merely saying:    \"The King punishes severely any treason on the part of his subjects.\"    \"What's treason?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"In this case,\" replied Cap'n Bill, \"treason seems to consist of  knockin' the King; but I guess we know his disposition now as well as  if the lady had said more.\"    \"I wonder,\" said Trot, going up to the woman, \"if you could spare us  something to eat. We haven't had anything but popcorn and lemonade for  a long time.\"    \"Bless your heart! Of course I can spare you some food,\" the woman  answered, and entering her cottage she soon returned with a tray loaded  with sandwiches, cakes and cheese. One of the children drew a bucket of  clear, cold water from a spring and the three wanderers ate heartily  and enjoyed the good things immensely.    When Button-Bright could eat no more he filled the pockets of his  jacket with cakes and cheese, and not even the children objected to  this. Indeed they all seemed pleased to see the strangers eat, so Cap'n  Bill decided that no matter what the King of Jinxland was like, the  people would prove friendly and hospitable.    \"Whose castle is that, yonder, ma'am?\" he asked, waving his hand toward  the towers that rose above the trees.    \"It belongs to his Majesty, King Krewl.\" she said.    \"Oh, indeed; and does he live there?\"    \"When he is not out hunting with his fierce courtiers and war  captains,\" she replied.    \"Is he hunting now?\" Trot inquired.    \"I do not know, my dear. The less we know about the King's actions the  safer we are.\"    It was evident the woman did not like to talk about King Krewl and so,  having finished their meal, they said good-bye and continued along the  pathway.    \"Don't you think we'd better keep away from that King's castle, Cap'n?\"  asked Trot.    \"Well,\" said he, \"King Krewl would find out, sooner or later, that we  are in his country, so we may as well face the music now. Perhaps he  isn't quite so bad as that woman thinks he is. Kings aren't always  popular with their people, you know, even if they do the best they know  how.\"    \"Ozma is pop'lar,\" said Button-Bright.    \"Ozma is diff'rent from any other Ruler, from all I've heard,\" remarked  Trot musingly, as she walked beside the boy. \"And, after all, we are  really in the Land of Oz, where Ozma rules ev'ry King and ev'rybody  else. I never heard of anybody getting hurt in her dominions, did you,  Button-Bright?\"    \"Not when she knows about it,\" he replied. \"But those birds landed us  in just the wrong place, seems to me. They might have carried us right  on, over that row of mountains, to the Em'rald City.\"    \"True enough,\" said Cap'n Bill; \"but they didn't, an' so we must make  the best of Jinxland. Let's try not to be afraid.\"    \"Oh, I'm not very scared,\" said Button-Bright, pausing to look at a  pink rabbit that popped its head out of a hole in the field near by.    \"Nor am I,\" added Trot. \"Really, Cap'n, I'm so glad to be anywhere at  all in the wonderful fairyland of Oz that I think I'm the luckiest girl  in all the world. Dorothy lives in the Em'rald City, you know, and so  does the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and Tik-Tok and the Shaggy  Man--and all the rest of 'em that we've heard so much about--not to  mention Ozma, who must be the sweetest and loveliest girl in all the  world!\"    \"Take your time, Trot,\" advised Button-Bright. \"You don't have to say  it all in one breath, you know. And you haven't mentioned half of the  curious people in the Em'rald City.\"    \"That 'ere Em'rald City,\" said Cap'n Bill impressively, \"happens to be  on the other side o' those mountains, that we're told no one is able to  cross. I don't want to discourage of you, Trot, but we're a'most as  much separated from your Ozma an' Dorothy as we were when we lived in  Californy.\"    There was so much truth in this statement that they all walked on in  silence for some time. Finally they reached the grove of stately trees  that bordered the grounds of the King's castle. They had gone halfway  through it when the sound of sobbing, as of someone in bitter distress,  reached their ears and caused them to halt abruptly.          Chapter Ten    Pon, the Gardener's Boy      It was Button-Bright who first discovered, lying on his face beneath a  broad spreading tree near the pathway, a young man whose body shook  with the force of his sobs. He was dressed in a long brown smock and  had sandals on his feet, betokening one in humble life. His head was  bare and showed a shock of brown, curly hair. Button-Bright looked down  on the young man and said:    \"Who cares, anyhow?\"    \"I do!\" cried the young man, interrupting his sobs to roll over, face  upward, that he might see who had spoken. \"I care, for my heart is  broken!\"    \"Can't you get another one?\" asked the little boy.    \"I don't want another!\" wailed the young man.    By this time Trot and Cap'n Bill arrived at the spot and the girl  leaned over and said in a sympathetic voice:    \"Tell us your troubles and perhaps we may help you.\"    The youth sat up, then, and bowed politely. Afterward he got upon his  feet, but still kept wringing his hands as he tried to choke down his  sobs. Trot thought he was very brave to control such awful agony so  well.    \"My name is Pon,\" he began. \"I'm the gardener's boy.\"    \"Then the gardener of the King is your father, I suppose,\" said Trot.    \"Not my father, but my master,\" was the reply    \"I do the work and the gardener gives the orders. And it was not my  fault, in the least, that the Princess Gloria fell in love with me.\"    \"Did she, really?\" asked the little girl.    \"I don't see why,\" remarked Button-Bright, staring at the youth.    \"And who may the Princess Gloria be?\" inquired Cap'n Bill.    \"She is the niece of King Krewl, who is her guardian. The Princess  lives in the castle and is the loveliest and sweetest maiden in all  Jinxland. She is fond of flowers and used to walk in the gardens with  her attendants. At such times, if I was working at my tasks, I used to  cast down my eyes as Gloria passed me; but one day I glanced up and  found her gazing at me with a very tender look in her eyes. The next  day she dismissed her attendants and, coming to my side, began to talk  with me. She said I had touched her heart as no other young man had  ever done. I kissed her hand. Just then the King came around a bend in  the walk. He struck me with his fist and kicked me with his foot. Then  he seized the arm of the Princess and rudely dragged her into the  castle.\"    \"Wasn't he awful!\" gasped Trot indignantly.    \"He is a very abrupt King,\" said Pon, \"so it was the least I could  expect. Up to that time I had not thought of loving Princess Gloria,  but realizing it would be impolite not to return her love, I did so. We  met at evening, now and then, and she told me the King wanted her to  marry a rich courtier named Googly-Goo, who is old enough to be  Gloria's father. She has refused Googly-Goo thirty-nine times, but he  still persists and has brought many rich presents to bribe the King. On  that account King Krewl has commanded his niece to marry the old man,  but the Princess has assured me, time and again, that she will wed only  me. This morning we happened to meet in the grape arbor and as I was  respectfully saluting the cheek of the Princess, two of the King's  guards seized me and beat me terribly before the very eyes of Gloria,  whom the King himself held back so she could not interfere.\"    \"Why, this King must be a monster!\" cried Trot.    \"He is far worse than that,\" said Pon, mournfully.    \"But, see here,\" interrupted Cap'n Bill, who had listened carefully to  Pon. \"This King may not be so much to blame, after all. Kings are proud  folks, because they're so high an' mighty, an' it isn't reasonable for  a royal Princess to marry a common gardener's boy.\"    \"It isn't right,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/959"],[0,"The Lost Princess of Oz (#12)"],[1,"his courtesy, and mounting their own animals rode  to the farther side of the city and right through the Wall of Illusion  out into the open country.  \"I'm glad we got away so easily,\" said  Betsy.  \"I didn't like those queer-shaped people.\"    \"Nor did I,\" agreed Dorothy. \"It seems dreadful to be lined with sheets  of pure gold and have nothing to eat but thistles.\"    \"They seemed happy and contented, though,\" remarked the Wizard, \"and  those who are contented have nothing to regret and nothing more to wish  for.\"          CHAPTER 10    TOTO LOSES SOMETHING      For a while the travelers were constantly losing their direction, for  beyond the thistle fields they again found themselves upon the  turning-lands, which swung them around one way and then another.  But  by keeping the City of Thi constantly behind them, the adventurers  finally passed the treacherous turning-lands and came upon a stony  country where no grass grew at all.  There were plenty of bushes,  however, and although it was now almost dark, the girls discovered some  delicious yellow berries growing upon the bushes, one taste of which  set them all to picking as many as they could find.  The berries  relieved their pangs of hunger for a time, and as it now became too  dark to see anything, they camped where they were.    The three girls lay down upon one of the blankets--all in a row--and  the Wizard covered them with the other blanket and tucked them in.  Button-Bright crawled under the shelter of some bushes and was asleep  in half a minute.  The Wizard sat down with his back to a big stone and  looked at the stars in the sky and thought gravely upon the dangerous  adventure they had undertaken, wondering if they would ever be able to  find their beloved Ozma again.  The animals lay in a group by  themselves, a little distance from the others.    \"I've lost my growl!\" said Toto, who had been very silent and sober all  that day.  \"What do you suppose has become of it?\"    \"If you had asked me to keep track of your growl, I might be able to  tell you,\" remarked the Lion sleepily.  \"But frankly, Toto, I supposed  you were taking care of it yourself.\"    \"It's an awful thing to lose one's growl,\" said Toto, wagging his tail  disconsolately.  \"What if you lost your roar, Lion?  Wouldn't you feel  terrible?\"    \"My roar,\" replied the Lion, \"is the fiercest thing about me.  I depend  on it to frighten my enemies so badly that they won't dare to fight me.\"    \"Once,\" said the Mule, \"I lost my bray so that I couldn't call to Betsy  to let her know I was hungry.  That was before I could talk, you know,  for I had not yet come into the Land of Oz, and I found it was  certainly very uncomfortable not to be able to make a noise.\"    \"You make enough noise now,\" declared Toto.  \"But none of you have  answered my question: Where is my growl?\"    \"You may search ME,\" said the Woozy.  \"I don't care for such things,  myself.\"    \"You snore terribly,\" asserted Toto.    \"It may be,\" said the Woozy.  \"What one does when asleep one is not  accountable for.  I wish you would wake me up sometime when I'm snoring  and let me hear the sound.  Then I can judge whether it is terrible or  delightful.\"    \"It isn't pleasant, I assure you,\" said the Lion, yawning.    \"To me it seems wholly unnecessary,\" declared Hank the Mule.    \"You ought to break yourself of the habit,\" said the Sawhorse.  \"You  never hear me snore, because I never sleep.  I don't even whinny as  those puffy meat horses do.  I wish that whoever stole Toto's growl had  taken the Mule's bray and the Lion's roar and the Woozy's snore at the  same time.\"    \"Do you think, then, that my growl was stolen?\"    \"You have never lost it before, have you?\" inquired inquired the  Sawhorse.    \"Only once, when I had a sore throat from barking too long at the moon.\"    \"Is your throat sore now?\" asked the Woozy.    \"No,\" replied the dog.    \"I can't understand,\" said Hank, \"why dogs bark at the moon.  They  can't scare the moon, and the moon doesn't pay any attention to the  bark.  So why do dogs do it?\"    \"Were you ever a dog?\" asked Toto.    \"No indeed,\" replied Hank.  \"I am thankful to say I was created a  mule--the most beautiful of all beasts--and have always remained one.\"    The Woozy sat upon his square haunches to examine Hank with care.  \"Beauty,\" he said, \"must be a matter of taste.  I don't say your  judgment is bad, friend Hank, or that you are so vulgar as to be  conceited.  But if you admire big, waggy ears and a tail like a  paintbrush and hoofs big enough for an elephant and a long neck and a  body so skinny that one can count the ribs with one eye shut--if that's  your idea of beauty, Hank, then either you or I must be much mistaken.\"    \"You're full of edges,\" sneered the Mule. \"If I were square as you are,  I suppose you'd think me lovely.\"    \"Outwardly, dear Hank, I would,\" replied the Woozy. \"But to be really  lovely, one must be beautiful without and within.\"    The Mule couldn't deny this statement, so he gave a disgusted grunt and  rolled over so that his back was toward the Woozy.  But the Lion,  regarding the two calmly with his great, yellow eyes, said to the dog,  \"My dear Toto, our friends have taught us a lesson in humility.  If the  Woozy and the Mule are indeed beautiful creatures as they seem to  think, you and I must be decidedly ugly.\"    \"Not to ourselves,\" protested Toto, who was a shrewd little dog.  \"You  and I, Lion, are fine specimens of our own races.  I am a fine dog, and  you are a fine lion.  Only in point of comparison, one with another,  can we be properly judged, so I will leave it to the poor old Sawhorse  to decide which is the most beautiful animal among us all. The Sawhorse  is wood, so he won't be prejudiced and will speak the truth.\"    \"I surely will,\" responded the Sawhorse, wagging his ears, which were  chips set in his wooden head.  \"Are you all agreed to accept my  judgment?\"    \"We are!\" they declared, each one hopeful.    \"Then,\" said the Sawhorse, \"I must point out to you the fact that you  are all meat creatures, who tire unless they sleep and starve unless  they eat and suffer from thirst unless they drink.  Such animals must  be very imperfect, and imperfect creatures cannot be beautiful.  Now, I  am made of wood.\"    \"You surely have a wooden head,\" said the Mule.    \"Yes, and a wooden body and wooden legs, which are as swift as the wind  and as tireless.  I've heard Dorothy say that 'handsome is as handsome  does,' and I surely perform my duties in a handsome manner. Therefore,  if you wish my honest judgment, I will confess that among us all I am  the most beautiful.\"    The Mule snorted, and the Woozy laughed; Toto had lost his growl and  could only look scornfully at the Sawhorse, who stood in his place  unmoved.  But the Lion stretched himself and yawned, saying quietly,  \"Were we all like the Sawhorse, we would all be Sawhorses, which would  be too many of the kind.  Were we all like Hank, we would be a herd of  mules; if like Toto, we would be a pack of dogs; should we all become  the shape of the Woozy, he would no longer be remarkable for his  unusual appearance.  Finally, were you all like me, I would consider  you so common that I would not care to associate with you.  To be  individual, my friends, to be different from others, is the only way to  become distinguished from the common herd.  Let us be glad, therefore,  that we differ from one another in form and in disposition. Variety is  the spice of life, and we are various enough to enjoy one another's  society; so let us be content.\"    \"There is some truth in that speech,\" remarked Toto reflectively. \"But  how about my lost growl?\"    \"The growl is of importance only to you,\" responded the Lion, \"so it is  your business to worry over the loss, not ours.  If you love us, do not  afflict your burdens on us; be unhappy all by yourself.\"    \"If the same person stole my growl who stole Ozma,\" said the little  dog, \"I hope we shall find him very soon and punish him as he deserves.  He must be the most cruel person in all the world, for to prevent a dog  from growling when it is his nature to growl is just as wicked, in my  opinion, as stealing all the magic in Oz.\"          CHAPTER 11    BUTTON-BRIGHT LOSES HIMSELF      The Patchwork Girl, who never slept and who could see very well in the  dark, had wandered among the rocks and bushes all night long, with the  result that she was able to tell some good news the next morning. \"Over  the crest of the hill before us,\" she said, \"is a big grove of trees of  many kinds on which all sorts of fruits grow.  If you will go there,  you will find a nice breakfast awaiting you.\"  This made them eager to  start, so as soon as the blankets were folded and strapped to the back  of the Sawhorse, they all took their places on the animals and set out  for the big grove Scraps had told them of.    As soon as they got over the brow of the hill, they discovered it to be  a really immense orchard, extending for miles to the right and left of  them.  As their way led straight through the trees, they hurried  forward as fast as possible.  The first trees they came to bore  quinces, which they did not like.  Then there were rows of citron trees  and then crab apples and afterward limes and lemons.  But beyond these  they found a grove of big, golden oranges, juicy and sweet, and the  fruit hung low on the branches so they could pluck it easily.    They helped themselves freely and all ate oranges as they continued on  their way.  Then, a little farther along, they came to some trees  bearing fine, red apples, which they also feasted on, and the Wizard  stopped here long enough to tie a lot of the apples in one end of a  blanket.    \"We do not know what will happen to us after we leave this delightful  orchard,\" he said, \"so I think it wise to carry a supply of apples with  us.  We can't starve as long as we have apples, you know.\"    Scraps wasn't riding "]]]
