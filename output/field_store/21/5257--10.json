And the LORD             answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he             slew the Gibeonites.    10:021:002 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now             the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the             remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn             unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the             children of Israel and Judah.)    10:021:003 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for             you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may             bless the inheritance of the LORD?    10:021:004 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor             gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill             any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I             do for you.    10:021:005 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that             devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining             in any of the coasts of Israel,    10:021:006 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will             hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD             did choose. And the king said, I will give them.    10:021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son             of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them,             between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.    10:021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,             whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five             sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for             Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:    10:021:009 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and             they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell             all seven together, and were put to death in the days of             harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley             harvest.    10:021:010 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it             for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until             water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither             the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of             the field by night.    10:021:011 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the             concubine of Saul, had done.    10:021:012 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of             Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had             stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines             had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in             Gilboa:    10:021:013 And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones             of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that             were hanged.    10:021:014 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the             country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his             father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And             after that God was intreated for the land.    10:021:015 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and             David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against             the Philistines: and David waxed faint.    10:021:016 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight             of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in             weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have             slain David.    10:021:017 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the             Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto             him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that             thou quench not the light of Israel.    10:021:018 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle             with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite             slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.    10:021:019 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines,             where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the             brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was             like a weaver's beam.    10:021:020 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great             stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot             six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to             the giant.    10:021:021 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the             brother of David slew him.    10:021:022 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the             hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.    10:022:001 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the             day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his             enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:    10:022:002 And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my             deliverer;    10:022:003 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and             the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my             saviour; thou savest me from violence.    10:022:004 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall             I be saved from mine enemies.    10:022:005 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly             men made me afraid;    10:022:006 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death             prevented me;    10:022:007 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God:             and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did             enter into his ears.    10:022:008 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven             moved and shook, because he was wroth.    10:022:009 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his             mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.    10:022:010 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was             under his feet.    10:022:011 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon             the wings of the wind.    10:022:012 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,             and thick clouds of the skies.    10:022:013 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.    10:022:014 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his             voice.    10:022:015 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and             discomfited them.    10:022:016 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the             world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the             blast of the breath of his nostrils.    10:022:017 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;    10:022:018 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated             me: for they were too strong for me.    10:022:019 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was             my stay.    10:022:020 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,             because he delighted in me.    10:022:021 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according             to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.    10:022:022 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly             departed from my God.    10:022:023 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes,             I did not depart from them.    10:022:024 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine             iniquity.    10:022:025 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my             righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.    10:022:026 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with             the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.    10:022:027 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the             froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.    10:022:028 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are             upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.    10:022:029 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my             darkness.    10:022:030 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I             leaped over a wall.    10:022:031 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:             he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.    10:022:032 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our             God?    10:022:033 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.    10:022:034 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my             high places.    10:022:035 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken             by mine arms.    10:022:036 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy             gentleness hath made me great.    10:022:037 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not             slip.    10:022:038 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned             not again until I had consumed them.    10:022:039 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could             not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.    10:022:040 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that             rose up against me hast thou subdued"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8018"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 18: Job (#12)"],[1,"8:038:041 Who provideth for the raven his food?

   18:039:002 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou             the time when they bring forth?    18:039:003 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they             cast out their sorrows.    18:039:004 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;             they go forth, and return not unto them.    18:039:005 Who hath sent out the wild ass free?

   18:039:010 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or             will he harrow the valleys after thee?    18:039:011 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt             thou leave thy labour to him?    18:039:012 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and             gather it into thy barn?    18:039:013 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and             feathers unto the ostrich?

wilt thou condemn me,             that thou mayest be righteous?    18:040:009 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice             like him?    18:040:010 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array             thyself with glory and beauty.    18:040:011 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that             is proud, and abase him.    18:040:012 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread             down the wicked in their place.    18:040:013 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in             secret.    18:040:014 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand             can save thee.    18:040:015 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass             as an ox.    18:040:016 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the             navel of his belly.    18:040:017 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are             wrapped together.    18:040:018 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like             bars of iron.    18:040:019 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make             his sword to approach unto him.    18:040:020 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the             beasts of the field play.    18:040:021 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and             fens.    18:040:022 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of             the brook compass him about.    18:040:023 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth             that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.    18:040:024 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.    18:041:001 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?

or his head with             fish spears?    18:041:008 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.    18:041:009 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down             even at the sight of him?    18:041:010 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to             stand before me?    18:041:011 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is             under the whole heaven is mine.    18:041:012 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely             proportion.    18:041:013 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to             him with his double bridle?    18:041:014 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible             round about.    18:041:015 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close             seal.    18:041:016 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.    18:041:017 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they             cannot be sundered.    18:041:018 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the             eyelids of the morning.    18:041:019 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap             out.    18:041:020 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or             caldron.    18:041:021 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.    18:041:022 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy             before him.    18:041:023 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in             themselves; they cannot be moved.    18:041:024 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of             the nether millstone.    18:041:025 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason             of breakings they purify themselves.    18:041:026 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear,             the dart, nor the habergeon.    18:041:027 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.    18:041:028 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with             him into stubble.    18:041:029 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a             spear.    18:041:030 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things             upon the mire.    18:041:031 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like             a pot of ointment.    18:041:032 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep             to be hoary.    18:041:033 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.    18:041:034 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the             children of pride.    18:042:001 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,    18:042:002 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can             be withholden from thee.    18:042:003 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore             have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for             me, which I knew not.    18:042:004 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,             and declare thou unto me.    18:042:005 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine             eye seeth thee.    18:042:006 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in"]]]
