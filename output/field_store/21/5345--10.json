[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10738"],[0,"Mahomet, Founder of Islam (#13)"],[1,"the hand to salute him was he the first to relinquish his grasp.\"    He lived openly among his disciples, holding frequent converse with them,  mending his own clothes and even shoes, a frugal liver and a fervent  preacher of the flaming faith within him. He became at this time  betrothed to Ayesha, the splendid woman, now just a merry child, who was  to keep her reigning place in his affections until the end of his life.  Daughter of Abu Bekr, she united in herself for Mahomet both policy and  attractiveness, for by this betrothal he became of blood-kin with Abu  Bekr, and thereby strengthened his friend's allegiance. The union marks  the inauguration of his policy of marriage alliances by which he bound  the supporters of his Faith more closely to him, either through his own  marriage with their daughters, or the bestowal of his offspring upon  them.    Ayesha was lovely and imperious, with a luxurious but shrewd nature,  and her counsel was always sought by Mahomet. Other women appeared  frequently like comets in his sky, flamed for a little into brightness  and disappeared into conjugal obscurity, but Ayesha's star remained fixed,  even if it was transitorily eclipsed by the brilliance of a new-comer.  Sexual relations held for Mahomet towards the end of his life a peculiar  potency, born of his intense energetic nature. He sought the society of  woman because of the mental clarity that for him followed any expression  of emotion. He was one of those men who must express--the artist, in fact;  but an artist who used the medium of action, not that of literature,  painting, or music. \"Poete, il ne connut que la poesie d'action,\" and like  Napoleon, his introspection was completely overshadowed by his consuming  energy. Therefore emotion was to him unconsciously the means by which this  immortal energy of mind could be conserved, and he used it unsparingly.    Ayesha has revealed for us the most intimate details of Mahomet's life,  and it is due to her that later traditions are enabled to represent him  as a man among men. He appears to us fierce and subtle, by turns  impetuous and calculating, a man who never missed an opportunity, and  gauged exactly the efforts needed to compass any intention. To him \"every  fortress had its key, and every man his price.\" He was as keen a  politician us he was a religious reformer, but before all he paid homage  to the sword, prime artificer in his career of conquest. But in those  confidently intimate traditions handed down to us from his immediate  entourage, and especially from Ayesha, we find him alternately passionate  and gentle, wearing his power with conscious authority, mild in his  treatment of the poor, terrible to his enemies, autocratic, intolerant,  with a strange magnetism that bound men to him. The mystery enveloping  great men even in their lifetime, among primitive races, creeps  down in these documents to hide much of his personality from us, but his  works proclaim his energy and tireless organising powers, even if the  mythical, allegoric element predominates in the earlier traditions. The  man who undertook and achieved the gigantic task of organising a new  social and political as well as religious order may be justly credited  with calling forth and centering in himself the vivid imaginations of  that most credulous age.    The year 620-621 passed chiefly in expectation of the Greater Pilgrimage,  when the disciples from Medina were to come to report progress and to  confirm their faith. The momentous time arrived, and Mahomet went almost  fearfully to meet the nucleus of his future kingdom in Acaba, a valley  near Mina. But his fears were groundless, for the little party had been  faithful to their leader, and had also increased their numbers.    They met in secret, and we may picture them a little diffident in so  strange a place, ever expectant of the swift descent of the Kureisch and  their own annihilation. Withal they were enthusiastic and confident of  their leader. One is irresistibly reminded, in reading of this meeting,  of that little outcast band from Judea which ultimately prevailed over  Caesar Imperator through its mighty quality of faith. The accredited words  of the first pledge given at Acaba are traditionally extant; they combine  curiously religious, moral, and social covenants, and assert even at that  early stage the headship of the Prophet over his servants:    \"We will not worship any but God; we will not steal, neither will we  commit adultery nor kill our children; we will not slander in any wise,  nor will we disobey the Prophet in anything that is right.\"    The converts then departed to their native city, for Mahomet did not deem  the time yet ripe enough for migration thither. He possessed the  difficult art of waiting until the effectual time should arrive, and  there is no doubt that by now he had formed definite plans to set up his  rule in Medina when there should be sufficient supporters there to  guarantee his success. Musab, a Meccan convert of some learning, was  deputed to accompany the Medinan citizens to their city and give  instruction therein to all who were willing to study the Muslim creed.    For yet another year Mahomet was to possess his soul in patience, but it  was with feelings of far greater confidence that he awaited the passing  of time. More than ever he became sure of the guiding hand of Allah, that  pointed indisputably to the stranger city as the goal of his strivings.  This city held a goodly proportion of Jews, therefore the connection  between his faith and that of Judaism must be continually emphasised.    We have seen how large a space Jewish legend and history fill in the  contemporary suras of the Kuran, and Mahomet's friendship with Israel  increased noticeably during his last two years at Mecca. He paid them the  honour of taking Jerusalem as his Kibla, or Holy Place, to which all  Believers turn in prayer, and the starting-place for his immortal  Midnight Journey was the Sacred City encompassing the Temple of the Lord.    No account of this journey appears except in the traditions crystallized  by Al Bokharil, but there is one short mention of it in the Kuran, Sura  xviii.    \"Glory be to him who carried his servant by night from the sacred temple  of Mecca to the temple that is more remote, i.e. Jerusalem.\"    The vision, however, looms so large in his followers' minds, and  exercised so profound an influence over their regard for Mahomet, that it  throws some light, upon the measure of his ascendancy during his last  years at Mecca, and establishes beyond dispute the inspired character of  his Prophetship in the imaginations of the few Believers. There have been  solemn and wordy disputes by theologians as to whether he made the  journey in the flesh, or whether his spirit alone crossed the dread  portals dividing our night from the celestial day.    He was lying in the Kaaba, so runs the legend, when the Angel of the Lord  appeared to him, and after having purged his heart of all sin, carried  him to the Temple at Jerusalem. He penetrated its sacred enclosure and  saw the beast Borak, \"greater than ass, smaller than mule,\" and was told  to mount. The Faithful still show the spot at Jerusalem where his steed's  hoof marked the ground as he spurned it with flying feet. With Gabriel by  his side, mounted on a beast mighty in strength, Mahomet scaled the  appalling spaces and came at last to the outer Heaven, before the gate  that guards the celestial realms. The angel knocked upon the brazen doors  and a voice within cried:    \"Who art thou, and who is with thee?\"    \"I am Gabriel,\" came the answer, \"and this is Mahomet.\"    And behold, the brazen gates that may not be unclosed for mortal man were  flung wide, and Mahomet entered alone with the angel. He penetrated to  the first Heaven and saw Adam, who interrogated him in the same words,  and received the same reply. And all the heavenly hierarchies, even unto  the seventh Heaven, John and Jesus, Joseph, Enoch, Aaron, Moses, Abraham,  acknowledged Mahomet in the same words, until the two came to \"the tree  called Sedrat,\" beyond which no man may pass and live, whose fruits are  shining serpents, and whose leaves are great beasts, round which flow  four rivers, the Nile and the Euphrates guarding it without, and within  these the celestial streams that water Paradise, too wondrous for a name.    Awed but undaunted, Mahomet passed alone beyond the sacred tree, for even  the Angel could not bear any longer so fierce a glory, and came to  Al-M'amur, even the Hall of Heavenly Audience, where are seventy thousand  angels. He mounted the steps of the throne between their serried ranks,  until at the touch of Allah's awful hand he stopped and felt its icy  coldness penetrate to his heart. He was given milk, wine, or honey to  drink, and he chose milk.    \"Hadst thou chosen honey, O Mahomet,\" said Allah, \"all thy people would be  saved, now only a part shall find perfection.\"    And Mahomet was troubled.    \"Bid my people pray to Me fifty times a day.\"    At the resistless mandate Mahomet turned and retraced his steps to the  seventh Heaven, where dwelt Abraham.    \"The people of the earth will be in nowise constrained to pray fifty  times a day. Return thou and beg that the number be lessened.\"    So Mahomet returned again and again at Abraham's command, until he had  reduced the number to five, which the father of his people considered  was sufficient burden for his feeble subjects to bear. Wherefore the five  periods set apart for prayer in the Muslim faith are proportionately  sacred, and with this divine mandate the vision ceased.    With his hopes now set on founding an earthly dominion with the help of  Allah, he had perforce to consider the political situation, and to mature  his policy for dealing with it as soon as events proved favourable.

And all the  while he kept drawing up closer to Mr. Glennie, until the two stood very  near each other.    There was a great difference between them; the one short and blustering,  with a red face turned up; the other tall and craning down, ill-clad,  ill-fed, and pale. Maskew had in his left hand a basket, with which he  went marketing of mornings, for he made his own purchases, and liked  fish, as being cheaper than meat. He had been chaffering with the  fishwives this very day, and was bringing back his provend with him when  he visited our school.    Then he said to Mr. Glennie: 'Now, Sir Parson, the law has given into  your fool's hands a power over this churchyard, and 'tis your trade to  stop unseemly headlines from being set up within its walls, or once set  up, to turn them out forthwith. So I give you a week's grace, and if  tomorrow sennight yon stone be not gone, I will have it up and flung in  pieces outside the wall.'    Mr. Glennie answered him in a low voice, but quite clear, so that we  could hear where we sat: 'I can neither turn the stone out myself, nor  stop you from turning it out if you so mind; but if you do this thing,  and dishonour the graveyard, there is One stronger than either you or I  that must be reckoned with.'    I knew afterwards that he meant the Almighty, but thought then that  'twas of Elzevir he spoke; and so, perhaps, did Mr. Maskew, for he fell  into a worse rage, thrust his hand in the basket, whipped out a great  sole he had there, and in a twinkling dashes it in Mr. Glennie's face,  with a 'Then, take that for an unmannerly parson, for I would not foul my  fist with your mealy chops.'    But to see that stirred my choler, for Mr. Glennie was weak as wax, and  would never have held up his hand to stop a blow, even were he strong as  Goliath. So I was for setting on Maskew, and being a stout lad for my  age, could have had him on the floor as easy as a baby; but as I rose  from my seat, I saw he held Grace by the hand, and so hung back for a  moment, and before I got my thoughts together he was gone, and I saw the  tail of Grace's cape whisk round the screen door.    A sole is at the best an ugly thing to have in one's face, and this sole  was larger than most, for Maskew took care to get what he could for his  money, so it went with a loud smack on Mr. Glennie's cheek, and then fell  with another smack on the floor. At this we all laughed, as children  will, and Mr. Glennie did not check us, but went back and sat very quiet  at his desk; and soon I was sorry I had laughed, for he looked sad, with  his face sanded and a great red patch on one side, and beside that the  fin had scratched him and made a blood-drop trickle down his cheek. A few  minutes later the thin voice of the almshouse clock said twelve, and away  walked Mr. Glennie without his usual 'Good day, children', and there was  the sole left lying on the dusty floor in front of his desk.    It seemed a shame so fine a fish should be wasted, so I picked it up and  slipped it in my desk, sending Fred Burt to get his mother's gridiron  that we might grill it on the schoolroom fire. While he was gone I went  out to the court to play, and had not been there five minutes when back  comes Maskew through our playground without Grace, and goes into the  schoolroom. But in the screen at the end of the room was a chink, against  which we used to hold our fingers on bright days for the sun to shine  through, and show the blood pink; so up I slipped and fixed my eye to the  hole, wanting to know what he was at. He had his basket with him, and I  soon saw he had come back for the sole, not having the heart to leave so  good a bit of fish. But look where he would, he could not find it, for he  never searched my desk, and had to go off with a sour countenance; but  Fred Burt and I cooked the sole, and found it well flavoured, for all it  had given so much pain to Mr. Glennie.    After that Grace came no more to school, both because her father had  said she should not, and because she was herself ashamed to go back  after what Maskew had done to Mr. Glennie. And then it was that I took to  wandering much in the Manor woods, having no fear of man-traps, for I  knew their place as soon as they were put down, but often catching sight  of Grace, and sometimes finding occasion to talk with her. Thus time  passed, and I lived with Elzevir at the Why Not?, still going to school  of mornings, but spending the afternoons in fishing, or in helping him  in the garden, or with the boats. As soon as I got to know him well, I  begged him to let me help run the cargoes, but he refused, saying I was  yet too young, and must not come into mischief. Yet, later, yielding to  my importunity, he consented; and more than one dark night I was in the  landing-boats that unburdened the lugger, though I could never bring  myself to enter the Mohune vault again, but would stand as sentry at the  passage-mouth. And all the while I had round my neck Colonel John  Mohune's locket, and at first wore it next myself, but finding it black  the skin, put it between shirt and body-jacket. And there by dint of  wear it grew less black, and showed a little of the metal underneath,  and at last I took to polishing it at odd times, until it came out quite  white and shiny, like the pure silver that it was. Elzevir had seen this  locket when he put me to bed the first time I came to the Why Not? and  afterwards I told him whence I got it; but though we had it out more  than once of an evening, we could never come at any hidden meaning.  Indeed, we scarce tried to, judging it to be certainly a sacred charm to  keep evil spirits from Blackbeard's body.          CHAPTER 7    AN AUCTION    What if my house be troubled with a rat,  And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats  To have it baned--_Shakespeare_      One evening in March, when the days were lengthening fast, there came a  messenger from Dorchester, and brought printed notices for fixing to the  shutters of the Why Not? and to the church door, which said that in a  week's time the bailiff of the duchy of Cornwall would visit Moonfleet.  This bailiff was an important person, and his visits stood as events in  village history. Once in five years he made a perambulation, or journey,  through the whole duchy, inspecting all the Royal property, and arranging  for new leases. His visits to Moonfleet were generally short enough, for  owing to the Mohunes owning all the land, the only duchy estate there was  the Why Not? and the only duty of the bailiff to renew that five-year  lease, under which Blocks had held the inn, father and son, for  generations. But for all that, the business was not performed without  ceremony, for there was a solemn show of putting up the lease of the inn  to the highest bidder, though it was well understood that no one except  Elzevir would make an offer.    So one morning, a week later, I went up to the top end of the village  to watch for the bailiff's postchaise, and about eleven of the forenoon  saw it coming down the hill with four horses and two postillions.  Presently it came past, and I saw there were two men in it--a clerk  sitting with his back to the horses, and in the seat opposite a little  man in a periwig, whom I took for the bailiff. Then I ran down to my  aunt's house, for Elzevir had asked me to beg one of her best winter  candles for a purpose which I will explain presently. I had not seen  Aunt Jane, except in church, since the day that she dismissed me, but  she was no stiffer than usual, and gave me the candle readily enough.  'There,' she said, 'take it, and I wish it may bring light into your  dark heart, and show you what a wicked thing it is to leave your own  kith and kin and go to dwell in a tavern.' I was for saying that it was  kith and kin that left me, and not I them; and as for living in a  tavern, it was better to live there than nowhere at all, as she would  wish me to do in turning me out of her house; but did not, and only  thanked her for the candle, and was off.    When I came to the inn, there was the postchaise in front of the door,  the horses being led away to bait, and a little group of villagers  standing round; for though the auction of the Why Not? was in itself a  trite thing with a foregone conclusion, yet the bailiff's visit always  stirred some show of interest. There were a few children with their noses  flattened against the windows of the parlour, and inside were Mr. Bailiff  and Mr. Clerk hard at work on their dinner. Mr. Bailiff, who was, as I  guessed, the little man in the periwig, sat at the top of the table, and  Mr. Clerk sat at the bottom, and on chairs were placed their hats, and  travelling-cloaks, and bundles of papers tied together with green tape.  You may be sure that Elzevir had a good dinner for them, with hot rabbit  pie and cold round of brawn, and a piece of blue vinny, which Mr. Bailiff  ate heartily, but his clerk would not touch, saying he had as lief chew  soap. There was also a bottle of Ararat milk, and a flagon of ale, for we  were afraid to set French wines before them, lest they should fall to  wondering how they were come by.    Elzevir took the candle, chiding me a little for being late, and set it  in a brass candlestick in the middle of the table. Then Mr. Clerk takes a  little rule from his pocket, measures an inch down on the candle, sticks  into the grease at that point a scarf-pin with an onyx head that Elzevir  lent him, and lights the wick. Now the reason of this was, that the  custom ran in Moonfleet when either land or lease was put up to bidding,  to stick a pin in a candle; and so long as the pin held firm, it was open  to any to make a better offer, but when the flame burnt down and the pin  fell out, then land or lease fell to the last bidder. So after dinner was  over and the table cleared, Mr. Clerk takes out a roll of papers and"]]]
