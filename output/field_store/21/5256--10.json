And Isaac             said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.    01:026:010 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one             of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou             shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.    01:026:011 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth             this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.    01:026:012 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year             an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.    01:026:013 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he             became very great:    01:026:014 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and             great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.    01:026:015 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in             the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped             them, and filled them with earth.    01:026:016 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much             mightier than we.    01:026:017 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley             of Gerar, and dwelt there.    01:026:018 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had             digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines             had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called             their names after the names by which his father had called             them.    01:026:019 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a             well of springing water.    01:026:020 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,             saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well             Esek; because they strove with him.    01:026:021 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he             called the name of it Sitnah.    01:026:022 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for             that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth;             and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we             shall be fruitful in the land.    01:026:023 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.    01:026:024 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am             the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,             and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant             Abraham's sake.    01:026:025 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the             LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants             digged a well.    01:026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his             friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.    01:026:027 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye             hate me, and have sent me away from you?    01:026:028 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee:             and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt             us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;    01:026:029 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and             as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee             away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.    01:026:030 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.    01:026:031 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to             another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him             in peace.    01:026:032 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,             and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and             said unto him, We have found water.    01:026:033 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is             Beersheba unto this day.    01:026:034 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the             daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of             Elon the Hittite:    01:026:035 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.    01:027:001 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes             were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest             son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,             here am I.    01:027:002 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my             death:    01:027:003 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and             thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;    01:027:004 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me,             that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.    01:027:005 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau             went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.    01:027:006 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard             thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,    01:027:007 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat,             and bless thee before the LORD before my death.    01:027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I             command thee.    01:027:009 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of             the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,             such as he loveth:    01:027:010 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and             that he may bless thee before his death.    01:027:011 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother             is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:    01:027:012 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him             as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a             blessing.    01:027:013 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:             only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.    01:027:014 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and             his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.    01:027:015 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which             were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her             younger son:    01:027:016 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,             and upon the smooth of his neck:    01:027:017 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had             prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.    01:027:018 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,             Here am I; who art thou, my son?    01:027:019 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I             have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit             and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.    01:027:020 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it             so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God             brought it to me.    01:027:021 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may             feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.    01:027:022 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him,             and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the             hands of Esau.    01:027:023 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his             brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.    01:027:024 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.    01:027:025 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's             venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near             to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.    01:027:026 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss             me, my son.    01:027:027 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of             his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my             son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:    01:027:028 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness             of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:    01:027:029 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord             over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:             cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that             blesseth thee.    01:027:030 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of             blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the             presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in             from his hunting.    01:027:031 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his             father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat             of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.    01:027:032 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said,             I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.    01:027:033 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is             he that hath taken venison, and brought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8003"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 3: Leviticus (#12)"],[1,"ighbour's wife,             the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.    03:020:011 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered             his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to             death;

for the crown of the anointing oil of             his God is upon him: I am the LORD.    03:021:013 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.    03:021:014 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these             shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own             people to wife.    03:021:015 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the             LORD do sanctify him.    03:021:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:021:017 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their             generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to             offer the bread of his God.    03:021:018 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not             approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose,             or any thing superfluous,    03:021:019 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,    03:021:020 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye,             or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;    03:021:021 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest             shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by             fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the             bread of his God.    03:021:022 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and             of the holy.    03:021:023 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the             altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my             sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.    03:021:024 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all             the children of Israel.    03:022:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:022:002 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate             themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and             that they profane not my holy name in those things which they             hallow unto me: I am the LORD.    03:022:003 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your             generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the             children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his             uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my             presence: I am the LORD.    03:022:004 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a             running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he             be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the             dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;    03:022:005 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be             made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness,             whatsoever uncleanness he hath;    03:022:006 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until             even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his             flesh with water.    03:022:007 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall             afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.    03:022:008 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall             not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.    03:022:009 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin             for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do             sanctify them.    03:022:010 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of             the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy             thing.    03:022:011 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of             it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his             meat.    03:022:012 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she             may not eat of an offering of the holy things.    03:022:013 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have             no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her             youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be             no stranger eat thereof.    03:022:014 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall             put the fifth part"]]]
