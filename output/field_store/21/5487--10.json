Reduced to a single float, the breakwater might remain under the  waves too long, but, owing to the two others, it rights itself, warps  around, and always presents the spur of its sharp roof to the wave.    In order to prevent the breakwaters from clashing against each other, they  are united end to end in a very simple and ingenious manner. From each of  them there starts a deeply inserted iron bar which terminates in a journal  that permits the breakwater to oscillate. Between these two bars there is  a sort of swivel, whose pieces, in playing upon one another, give the  breakwaters elasticity, while always holding them apart (Fig. 4). From  each side of the swivel start the branches of a stirrup iron to which the  anchorage chain is attached. This latter is of steel, without solderings,  and it is so perfectly constructed that no breakage need be feared. To the  other extremity of the chain is attached an anchor having two flukes,  which both engage with the bottom.    Mr. Froideville proposes to set up two lines of these breakwaters, for a  length of about 71/2 kilometers, starting at the north from Cape Heve,  taking in depths of 15 meters (the best that are found in the Little  Roadstead), passing in front of the Eclat shoal and the heights, and  ending opposite the entrance of the present port.    The first row is designed for breaking the force of the waves, and the  second for lending its aid in times of high tempests, and stopping the  surge that has escaped from the first.    The extreme simplicity of this project has permitted its promoter to  affirm that in a few months, and with nine millions, he can inclose the  Havre roadstead.    The Little Roadstead, being thenceforward protected, will become an  excellent port of refuge in bad weather. In addition, a system of  lighters, or, better, a few floats connected with the shore and forming a  rock, will permit vessels to take on their cargoes with great rapidity.    Mr. Froideville's project presents the further advantage of rendering it  easier to put the port of Havre quickly in defense. A certain number of  floating batteries, anchored behind the breakwaters and protecting the  advances of torpedo boats by means of their firing, would make a  formidable defense. Not having to perform any evolutions, they might  without danger be invested with armor plate thicker than that of ordinary  ironclads. In order to complete the system, there might be erected upon  the Eclat shoal an ironclad fort like that which defends the entrance of  Portsmouth.    An English chronicler of the fourteenth century, in speaking of his  country, places it above all others, and declares that men are handsomer,  whiter, and purer blooded there than elsewhere, and he says that this is  so \"because it is so.\" We would not like to imitate his naive reasoning,  and yet, for defending the very original system proposed by Mr.  Froideville, we have only our conviction, which we share, moreover, with a  large number of sea-faring men and engineers. Mathematics are powerless to  predict to us with accuracy the manner in which the floating breakwaters  will behave, but experiment remains. Let the promoter of the project,  then, be given authority to inclose a few hundred meters, and if, as we  suppose, the breakwaters shall remain immovable in a northwester, a  maritime revolution will have been brought about.--_La Nature._           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED CATCH BASIN.      In 1882, M. Bacle published in _Le Genie Civil_ a study of the sewer  systems in some of the large foreign cities. There may be found there a  description of the Liernur system at Amsterdam, Leyden, and Dordrecht, in  Holland, and in certain cities of Germany and the United States.    [Illustration: IMPROVED CATCH BASIN.]    This system consists in the employment of two distinct systems of ducts,  one for the discharges from water-closets and the other for household  wastes, rain water, and the discharges from factories when sufficiently  purified. This arrangement allows the employment of sewers of small  section, provided that it shall be unnecessary to enter them for the  purpose of cleansing them. It has been necessary, therefore, to provide  inlets with a separating apparatus called \"gully\" or \"catch basin,\" which  retains as completely as possible all solid matter, mud, excrement, and  _debris_ of every kind which maybe floated in by street washing or by  rain-water, and which may be capable of causing stoppages in the sewers,  the choking up being followed by fermentation and the emanation of noxious  vapors.    M.C. Pieper of Berlin suggests a device for a catch basin, which appears  to meet the requirements. It is in the form of a cylindrical metal box,  enlarged in its upper section to receive a filtering cylinder of  perforated sheet iron, which occupies almost the upper half of the device  and rests upon the smaller lower part. The entire apparatus is covered by  a movable funnel, through which enter water and any rubbish which it may  carry with it. From one side a tube allows the liquid to be discharged,  while a siphon placed on the opposite side serves the same purpose under  certain circumstances, as will be explained.    Figure 1 represents the apparatus discharging under normal conditions. The  heavy matter, sand, stones, etc., falls to the bottom into a receptacle  which can be lifted out from time to time and emptied. The lighter buoyant  matters, straw, vegetable _debris_, paper, etc., remain at the surface,  and are retained by the filter; the water passing through the holes in the  sheet iron rushes in a filtered condition through the annular space which  exists in the upper part between the two cylinders, and escapes by the  waste-pipe when the water reaches a proper level. If at a given moment the  quantity of water flowing in is too much to be discharged through this  waste-pipe, the level of the water mounts in the cylinder until it reaches  the top of the siphon. Immediately the siphon comes into play and empties  the upper part of the apparatus, and the filtered water contained in the  annular space already mentioned quickly re-enters the cylinder through the  perforated sheet iron, and in so doing cleans out the perforations with  considerable energy. This second period is represented in the second  figure.    The mouth of the siphon being placed above the movable basket, the heavy  matters contained in the latter are not in the least disturbed, and the  metallic screen placed over the mouth prevents the entrance of any  floating matters. When siphonic action ceases, the water in the short arm  of the siphon empties itself into the main receptacle, and by so doing  cleanses the screen. During a rain or the washing of the streets, the  siphon can work in concurrence with the ordinary discharge-pipe. It is  evident of course that these two--pipes can be placed on the same side of  the apparatus, if this prove the most convenient arrangement.    We will add that this apparatus can be applied not only to the Liernur  system, but also can be used for preventing the entrance of obstructions  into sewers of the ordinary type, where the grade is small or where the  quantity of water is insufficient; and if we adopt the system of  \"everything to the sewer,\" can we not find in the employment of this  apparatus an element for the realization of the famous formula, \"Always in  circulation, and never in stagnation?\"--_Le Genie Civil._           *       *       *       *       *          [Concluded from SUPPLEMENT No. 454, page 7249.]    WATER-POWER WITH HIGH PRESSURES AND WROUGHT-IRON WATER-PIPE.    By HAMILTON SMITH, JR., M. Am. Soc. C.E.    METHODS OF CONDUCTING WATER AND TRANSMITTING POWER.      A description of the mode of using water-power for driving the North  Bloomfield tunnel in California, some years since, will give a good  illustration of some of the advantages of the hurdy-gurdy. This tunnel was  originally about 8,000 feet long, through a slate highly metamorphosed,  with its general line passing under a good-sized stream, at a depth of  about 190 feet. There were eight working-shafts, each about 200 feet deep,  which, with the lower entrance or portal, gave sixteen working faces.  Diamond drills were used at the lower heading requiring power; the other  fifteen headings were driven by hand-work. It was uncertain how much water  would be encountered; but from the location, it was evident that a large  quantity might be struck in any shaft, and hence it became necessary to  have ample power at hand at each opening, in readiness for such an  emergency. A pipe main was laid along the general line of the tunnel, with  its pen-stock 285 feet vertical above the surface at the upper shaft, and  549 feet above the lowest shaft. It was made of single riveted sheet-iron,  of No. 14 (Birmingham) gauge, in lengths of 20 feet, put together  stove-pipe fashion, with the joints made tight by cloth tarred strips and  pine wedges. This pipe had a diameter of 15 inches at the pen-stock,  diminishing from this to 13, 11, and 7 inches at its lower end. From it,  short branches, 7 inches in diameter, were extended to the several shafts.  It was in one place carried across the stream by a light suspension  bridge, some 150 feet long, the trunk of a tree on each side forming a  convenient tower. The aggregate length of the main and branches was 9,960  feet, with some 2,500 feet additional, for the branch to the diamond  drills. The pipe was laid on the surface of the ground, its only  protection being in places a couple of 11/2-inch planks tacked together, and  placed over it; the range of temperature was from 10 degrees to 107  degrees Fahr. (in the shade). It was inspected by the foreman of the  tunnel-work as he daily walked over the line; besides "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14"],[0,"The 1990 CIA World Factbook (#13)"],[1,"Executive branch: British monarch, governor general, prime minister,  deputy prime minister, Cabinet    Legislative branch: bicameral Federal Parliament consists of an upper  house or Senate and a lower house or House of Representatives    Judicial branch: High Court    Leaders:  Chief of State--Queen ELIZABETH II (since February 1952),  represented by Governor General William George HAYDEN (since NA February 1989);    Head of Government--Prime Minister Robert James Lee HAWKE (since  11 March 1983); Deputy Prime Minister Paul KEATING (since 3 April 1990)    Political parties and leaders: government--Australian Labor  Party, Robert Hawke; opposition--Liberal Party, Andrew Peacock;  National Party, Charles Blunt; Australian Democratic Party, Janine Haines    Suffrage: universal and compulsory at age 18    Elections:  Senate--last held 11 July 1987 (next to be held by 12 May 1990);  results--Labor 43%, Liberal-National 42%, Australian Democrats 8%,  independents 2%;  seats--(76 total) Labor 32, Liberal-National 34, Australian  Democrats 7, independents 3;    House of Representatives--last held 24 March 1990 (next to be  held by November 1993);  results--Labor 39.7%, Liberal-National 43%, Australian Democrats  and independents 11.1%;  seats--(148 total) Labor 78, Liberal-National 69, independent 1    Communists: 4,000 members (est.)
