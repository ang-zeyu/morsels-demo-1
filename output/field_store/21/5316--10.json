PRUNE WHIP.--A very dainty prune dessert can be made from stewed  prunes by reducing the prunes to a pulp and then adding the whites of  eggs. Directions for this dessert follow:    PRUNE WHIP  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 c. prune pulp  1/4 c. powdered sugar  2 egg whites  Whipped cream    Make the prune pulp by removing the seeds from stewed prunes and forcing  the prunes through a sieve or a ricer. Mix the powdered sugar with the  pulp. Beat the whites of the eggs until they are stiff and then  carefully fold them into the prune pulp. Chill and serve with  whipped cream.      RAISINS    131. RAISINS are the dried fruit of various kinds of grapes that contain  considerable sugar and are cured in the sun or in an oven. They come  principally from the Mediterranean region and from California. They have  an extensive use in cookery, both as a confection and an ingredient in  cakes, puddings, and pastry. In food value, raisins are very high and  contain sugar in the form of glucose; however, their skins are coarse  cellulose and for this reason are likely to be injurious to children if  taken in too large quantities. They are also valuable as a laxative and  in adding variety to the diet if they are well cooked before they  are served.    Like other dried fruits, raisins should be washed thoroughly before they  are used. They may then be soaked in warm water and stewed in exactly  the same way as prunes. Sugar may or may not be added, as desired.  Sultana raisins, which are the seedless variety, are especially  desirable for stewing, although they may be used for any of the other  purposes for which raisins are used.      DRIED APPLES, APRICOTS, AND PEACHES    132. Apples, apricots, and peaches are fruits that are used extensively  in their dried form. They enable the housewife to supply her family with  fruit during seasons when it is impossible to obtain fresh fruit. They  may also be used to take the place of canned fruit, especially when the  supply is low or has been exhausted. Besides their use as a sauce, they  may be used for pies and various desserts.    133. These fruits, which may all be used in just the same way, should be  soaked before stewing and should be stewed according to the directions  for the preparation and cooking of prunes. Then sufficient sugar to make  them sweet should be added. If they are desired for sauce, they may be  used without any further preparation. However, they may be substituted  for fresh fruit in recipes that call for any of them or for prunes. For  instance, dried apricots, after being stewed, may be passed through a  sieve to make a puree and may then be used to make apricot whip or  souffle according to the directions given for other similar desserts.  The flavor of apricots is very strong and a small amount of the pulp  will flavor a large quantity of ice cream, sherbet, or water ice.           *       *       *       *       *    FRUIT AND FRUIT DESSERTS    EXAMINATION QUESTIONS    (1) To what are the flavors and odors of fruits chiefly due?

The various methods of preserving perishable foods in the home for  winter use originated because of necessity. In localities where the  seasons for fruits and vegetables are short, the available supply in  early times was limited to its particular season. Then foods had to be  preserved in some way to provide for the season of scarcity. It was not  possible, as it is now, to obtain foods in all parts of the country from  localities that produce abundantly or have long seasons, because there  were no means of rapid transportation, no cold storage, nor no  commercial canning industries.    2. In the small towns and farming communities, the first preservation  methods for meats, as well as for fruits and vegetables, were pickling,  curing, drying, and preserving. Not until later was canning known. It  was this preserving of foodstuffs in the home that led to the  manufacture and commercial canning of many kinds of edible materials.  These industries, however, are of comparatively recent origin, the first  canning of foods commercially having been done in France about a hundred  years ago. At that time glass jars were utilized, but it was not until  tin cans came into use later in England that commercial canning met with  much favor.    3. Both canning in the home and commercial canning have had many  drawbacks, chief among which was spoiling. It was believed that the  spoiling of canned foods was due to the presence of air in the jars or  cans, and it is only within the last 50 years that the true cause of  spoiling, namely, the presence of bacteria, has been understood. Since  that time methods of canning that are much more successful have been  originated, and the present methods are the result of the study of  bacteria and their functions in nature. It is now definitely known that  on this knowledge depends the success of the various canning methods.    4. Since commercial canning provides nearly every kind of foodstuff, and  since cold storage and rapid transportation make it possible to supply  almost every locality with foods that are out of season, it has not been  deemed so necessary to preserve foods in the home. Nevertheless, the  present day brings forth a new problem and a new attitude toward the  home preservation of foods. There are three distinct reasons why foods  should be preserved in the home. The first is to bring about _economy_.  If fruits, vegetables, and other foods can be procured at a price that  will make it possible to preserve them in the home at a lower cost than  that of the same foods prepared commercially, it will pay from an  economical standpoint. The second is to promote _conservation_; that is,  to prevent the wasting of food. When fruits and vegetables are  plentiful, the supply is often greater than the demand for immediate  consumption. Then, unless the surplus food is preserved in some way for  later use, there will be a serious loss of food material. The third is  to produce _quality_. If the home-canned product can be made superior to  that commercially preserved, then, even at an equal or a slightly higher  cost, it will pay to preserve food in the home.    5. Of the methods of preserving perishable foods, only two, namely,  canning and drying, are considered in this Section. Before satisfactory  methods of canning came into use, drying was a common method of  preserving both fruits and vegetables, and while it has fallen into  disuse to a great extent in the home, much may be said for its value.  Drying consists merely in evaporating the water contained in the food,  and, with the exception of keeping it dry and protected from vermin, no  care need be given to the food in storage. In the preparation of dried  food for the table, it is transformed into its original composition by  the addition of water, in which it is usually soaked and then cooked.    The drying of food is simple, and no elaborate equipment is required for  carrying out the process. Dried food requires less space and care in  storage than food preserved in any other way, and both paper and cloth  containers may be used in storing it. When storage space is limited, or  when there is a very large quantity of some such food as apples or  string beans that cannot be used or canned at once, it is advisable to  dry at least a part of them. When used in combination with canning,  drying offers an excellent means of preserving foods and thus adding to  their variety.    6. Canning has a greater range of possibilities than drying. A larger  number of foods can be preserved in this way, and, besides, the foods  require very little preparation, in some cases none at all, when they  are removed from the cans.

The Macquarie, like other Australian  rivers, has a peculiar character, and this was soon apparent in the reeds  and lofty yarra trees growing on reedy plats, and not, as usual in other  rivers, on the edge of water-worn banks. The channel was here deep and  dry. We found this day, in the scrubs by Marra Creek, the ACACIA  SALICINA, whereof the wood has a strong perfume resembling violets, also  a new small-leaved KOCHIA with intricate branches.[*] Thermometer at  sunrise, 47 deg.; at 4 P. M., 77 deg.; at 9, 57 deg.;--with wet bulb, 56 deg..    [* K. THYMIFOLIA (Lindl. MS.); fruticosa, ramosissima, ramulis intricatis  pubescentibus, foliis carnosis obtusis teretibus fructibusque glabris.]    13TH FEBRUARY.--I was again laid up with the MALADIE DU PAYS--sore eyes.  Mr. Stephenson took a ride for me to the summit of Mount Foster, and to  various cattle stations about its base, with some questions to which I  required answers, about the river and stations on it lower down. But no  one could tell what the western side of the marshes was like, as no  person had passed that way; the country being more open on the eastern  side, where only the stations were situated; Mr. Kinghorne's at Graway,  about five miles from our camp, being the lowest down on the west bank.  Mr. Stephenson returned early, having met two of the mounted police. To  my most important question--what water was to be found lower down in the  river--the reply was very satisfactory; namely, \"plenty, and a FLOOD  COMING DOWN from the Turmountains.\" The two policemen said they had  travelled twenty miles with it, on the day previous, and that it would  still take some time to arrive near our camp. About noon the drays  arrived in good order, having been encamped where there was no water  about six miles short of our camp, the whole distance travelled, from  Cannonba to the Macquarie, having been about nineteen miles. In the  afternoon two of the men taking a walk up the river, reported on their  return, that the flood poured in upon them when in the river bed, so  suddenly, that they narrowly escaped it. Still the bed of the Macquarie  before our camp continued so dry and silent, that I could scarcely  believe the flood coming to be real, and so near to us, who had been put  to so many shifts for want of water. Towards evening, I stationed a man  with a gun a little way up the river, with orders to fire on the flood's  appearance, that I might have time to run to the part of the channel  nearest to our camp, and witness what I had so much wished to see, as  well from curiosity as urgent need. The shades of evening came, however,  but no flood, and the man on the look-out returned to the camp. Some  hours later, and after the moon had risen, a murmuring sound like that of  a distant waterfall, mingled with occasional cracks as of breaking  timber, drew our attention, and I hastened to the river bank. By very  slow degrees the sound grew louder, and at length, so audible as to draw  various persons besides from the camp to the river-side. Still no flood  appeared, although its approach was indicated by the occasional rending  of trees with a loud noise. Such a phenomenon in a most serene moonlight  night was quite new to us all. At length, the rushing sound of waters and  loud cracking of timber, announced that the flood was in the next bend.  It rushed into our sight, glittering in the moonbeams, a moving cataract,  tossing before it ancient trees, and snapping them against its banks. It  was preceded by a point of meandering water, picking its way, like a  thing of life, through the deepest parts of the dark, dry, and shady bed,  of what thus again became a flowing river. By my party, situated as we  were at that time, beating about the country, and impeded in our journey,  solely by the almost total absence of water--suffering excessively from  thirst and extreme heat,--I am convinced the scene never can be  forgotten. Here came at once abundance, the product of storms in the far  off mountains, that overlooked our homes. My first impulse was to have  welcomed this flood on our knees, for the scene was sublime in itself,  while the subject--an abundance of water sent to us in a desert--greatly  heightened the effect to our eyes. Suffice it to say, I had witnessed  nothing of such interest in all my Australian travels. Even the heavens  presented something new, at least uncommon, and therefore in harmony with  this scene; the variable star ARGUS had increased to the first magnitude,  just above the beautiful constellation of the southern cross, which  slightly inclined over the river, in the only portion of sky seen through  the trees. That very red star, thus rapidly increasing in magnitude,  might, as characteristic of her rivers, be recognized as the star of  Australia, when Europeans cross the Line. The river gradually filled up  the channel nearly bank high, while the living cataract travelled onward,  much slower than I had expected to see it; so slowly, indeed, that more  than an hour after its first arrival, the sweet music of the head of the  flood was distinctly audible from my tent, as the murmur of waters, and  the diapason crash of logs, travelled slowly through the tortuous  windings of the river bed. I was finally lulled to sleep by that melody  of living waters, so grateful to my ear, and evidently so unwonted in the  dry bed of the thirsty Macquarie. Thermometer, at sunrise, 47 deg.; at noon,  79 deg.; at 4 P. M., 88 deg.; at 9, 63 deg.;--with wet bulb, 57 deg..    14TH FEBRUARY.--The river had risen to within six feet of the top of the  banks, and poured its turbid waters along in fulness and strength, but no  longer with noise. All night that body of water had been in motion  downwards, and seemed to me enough to deluge the whole country to the  Darling, and correct at least any saltness in its waters, if stagnant; a  probability which had greatly reconciled me to the necessity for changing  the line of my intended route, as the waters above the junction of the  Castlereagh had never been known to become salt. We proceeded, falling  soon into a cart track which led us to Graway, Mr. Kinghorne's  cattlestation, and we encamped about five miles beyond it, near a bend of  the river. We were already in the midst of reeds, but these had been so  generally burnt, that we had little difficulty in crossing those parts of  the marshes. The IMPERATA ARUNDINACEA, with its long head of white silky  flowers, was common, and a straggling naked branched species of dock, on  the parts unburnt. Thermometer at sunrise, 54 deg.; at noon, 91 deg.; at 4 P. M.,  82 deg.; at 9, 72 deg.;--with wet bulb, 60 deg.. Height above the level of the sea,  475 feet.    15TH FEBRUARY.--Mr. Kinghorne obligingly accompanied me this day, and  guided us across arms of the marshy ground. I was very glad to have his  assistance, for I saw no line of trees as on other rivers, nor other  objects by which I could pursue its course or keep near its waters; trees  of the aquatic sort and reeds grew together. At one time nothing was  visible to the eastward but a vast sea of reeds extending to the horizon.  Where the long reeds remained unburnt, they presented a most formidable  impediment, especially to men on foot and sheep, and twenty of these got  astray as the party passed through. We encamped on a bank of rather firm  ground, in lat. 30 deg. 53' 55\" S. The grass was very rich on some parts of  open plains near the marshes, and the best was the PANICUM LOEVINODE of  Dr. Lindley, mentioned in my former journals[*] as having been found  pulled, and laid up in heaps for some purpose we could not then discover.  Mr. Kinghorne now informed me that it was called by the natives \"coolly,\"  and that the gins gather it in great quantities, and pound the seeds  between stones with water, forming a kind of paste or bread; thus was  clearly explained the object of those heaps of this grass which we had  formerly seen on the banks of the Darling. There they had formed the  native's harvest field. There also I observed a brome grass, probably not  distinct from the BROODS AUSTRALIS of Brown; it called to mind the  squarrose brome grass of Europe. Thermometer at sunrise, 59 deg.; at noon,  87 deg.; at 4, 89 deg.; at 9, 73 deg.;--with wet bulb, 66 deg..    [* Vol. i. p. 237.]    16TH FEBRUARY.--Mr. Kinghorne set out with a man of our party to examine  Duck Creek, a native boy having told him that water was to be found in it  lower down. I sent back early this morning, our native, with the store-  keeper, some of the men, and the shepherd, to look for the lost sheep in  the reeds, and Yuranigh fortunately found them out, still not very far  from the spot where they had been separated from the rest of the flock.  Our greatest difficulty in these marshes was the watering of the cattle.  We had still the Macquarie at hand--deep, muddy, and stagnant--not above  thirty feet wide, the banks so very soft that men could scarcely approach  the water without sinking to the knees. We could water the horses with  buckets, but not the bullocks. The great labour of filling one of the  half-boats, and giving the cattle water by that means, was inevitable,  and this operation took up three hours of the morning; a wheel required  repair, the box having been broken yesterday. I for these reasons found  it advisable to halt this day, which I did very reluctantly. At sunset,  Mr. Kinghorne returned, having found no water in the \"Marra,\" (Duck  Creek).    Among the grasses growing among the reeds, we perceived the ANDROPOGON  SERICEUS and an ERIANTHUS, which appeared to differ from E. FULVUS in  having no hair upon the knees. The smooth variety of the European LYTHRUM  SALICARIA, raised its crimson spikes of flowers among the reeds of the  Macquarie, as it does in England on the banks of the Thames. We saw also  MORGANIA FLORIBUNDA, SENECIO BRACHYLOENUS (D. C.), a variety with toothed  leaves, also a"]]]
