Make a hole in your flour,  and pour in your yeast and eggs, and as much milk just warm, as will  make it into a light paste.

I think there must be a  special Providence that watches over wandering naturalists and directs them  to such men as Kellogg, for without divine aid they could never be found.  When we last saw him, he stood on the stone steps of the water front waving  his hat as we slipped away on the tide, to board the S.S. _Haitan_ for  Hongkong.          CHAPTER VIII      THE WOMEN OF CHINA    _Y.B.A._    The schools for native girls at Foochow and Yen-ping interested us greatly,  even when we first came to China, but we could not appreciate then as we  did later the epoch-making step toward civilization of these institutions.    How much the missionaries are able to accomplish from a religious  standpoint is a question which we do not wish to discuss, but no one who  has ever lived among them can deny that the opening of schools and the  diffusing of western knowledge are potent factors in the development of the  people. The Chinese were not slow even in the beginning to see the  advantages of a foreign education for their boys and now, along the coast  at least, some are beginning to make sacrifices for their daughters as  well. The Woman's College, which was opened recently in Foochow, is one of  the finest buildings of the Republic, and when one sees its bright-faced  girls dressed in their quaint little pajama-like garments, it is difficult  to realize that outside such schools they are still slaves in mind and body  to those iron rules of Confucius which have molded the entire structure of  Chinese society for over 2400 years.    The position of women in China today, and the rules which govern the  household of every orthodox Chinese, are the direct heritage of  Confucianism. The following translation by Professor J. Legge from the  _Narratives of the Confucian School_, chapter 26, is illuminating:        Confucius said: \"Man is the representative of heaven and is supreme      over all things. Woman yields obedience to the instructions of man and      helps to carry out his principles. On this account she can determine      nothing of herself and is subject to the rule of the three obediences.        \"(1) When young she must obey her father and her elder brother;        \"(2) When married, she must obey her husband;        \"(3) When her husband is dead she must obey her son.        \"She may not think of marrying a second time. No instructions or orders      must issue from the harem. Women's business is simply the preparation      and supplying of drink and food. Beyond the threshold of her apartments      she shall not be known for evil or for good. She may not cross the      boundaries of a state to attend a funeral. She may take no steps on her      own motive and may come to no conclusion on her own deliberation.\"        The grounds for divorce as stated by Confucius are:        \"(1) Disobedience to her husband's parents;        \"(2) Not giving birth to a son;        \"(3) Dissolute conduct;        \"(4) Jealousy of her husband's attentions (to the other inmates at his      harem);        \"(5) Talkativeness, and        \"(6) Thieving.\"    A Chinese bride owes implicit obedience to her mother-in-law, and as she is  often reared by her husband's family, or else married to him as a mere  child, and is under the complete control of his mother for a considerable  period of her existence, her life in many instances is one of intolerable  misery. There is generally little or no consideration for a girl under the  best of circumstances until she becomes the mother of a male child; her  condition then improves but she approaches happiness only when she in turn  occupies the enviable position of mother-in-law.    It is difficult to imagine a life of greater dreariness and vacuity than  that of the average Chinese woman. Owing to her bound feet and resultant  helplessness, if she is not obliged to work she rarely stirs from the  narrow confinement of her courtyard, and perhaps in her entire life she may  not go a mile from the house to which she was brought a bride, except for  the periodical visits to her father's home.    It has been aptly said that there are no real homes in China and it is not  surprising that, ignored and despised for centuries, the Chinese woman  shows no ability to improve the squalor of her surroundings. She passes her  life in a dark, smoke-filled dwelling with broken furniture and a mud  floor, together with pigs, chickens and babies enjoying a limited sphere of  action under the tables and chairs, or in the tumble-down courtyard  without. Her work is actually never done and a Chinese bride, bright and  attractive at twenty, will be old and faded at thirty.    But without doubt the crowning evil which attends woman's condition in  China is foot binding, and nothing can be offered in extenuation of this  abominable custom. It is said to have originated one thousand years before  the Christian era and has persisted until the present day in spite of the  efforts directed against it. The Empress Dowager issued edicts strongly  advising its discontinuation, the \"Natural Foot Society,\" which was formed  about fifteen years ago, has endeavored to educate public opinion, and the  missionaries refuse to admit girls so mutilated to their schools; but  nevertheless the reform has made little progress beyond the coast cities.  \"Precedent\" and the fear of not obtaining suitable husbands for their  daughters are responsible for the continuation of the evil, and it is  estimated that there are still about seventy-four millions of girls and  women who are crippled in this way.    The feet are bandaged between the ages of five and seven. The toes are bent  under the sole of the foot and after two or three years the heel and instep  are so forced together that a dollar can be placed in the cleft; gradually  also the lower limbs shrink away until only the bones remain.    The suffering of the children is intense. We often passed through streets  full of laughing boys and tiny girls where others, a few years older, were  sitting on the doorsteps or curbstones holding their tortured feet and  crying bitterly. In some instances out-houses are constructed a  considerable distance from the family dwelling where the girls must sleep  during their first crippled years in order that their moans may not disturb  the other members of the family. The child's only relief is to hang her  feet over the edge of the bed in order to stop the circulation and induce  numbness, or to seek oblivion from opium.    If the custom were a fad which affected only the wealthy classes it would  be reprehensible enough, but it curses rich and poor alike, and almost  every day we saw heavily laden coolie women steadying themselves by means  of a staff, hobbling stiff-kneed along the roads or laboring in the fields.    Although the agitation against foot binding is undoubtedly making itself  felt to a certain extent in the coast provinces, in Yün-nan the horrible  practice continues unabated. During the year in which we traveled through a  large part of the province, wherever there were Chinese we saw bound feet.  And the fact that virtually _every_ girl over eight years old was mutilated  in this way is satisfactory evidence that reform ideas have not penetrated  to this remote part of the Republic.    I know of nothing which so rouses one's indignation because of its  senselessness and brutality, and China can never hope to take her place  among civilized nations until she has abandoned this barbarous custom and  liberated her women from their infamous subjection.    There has been much criticism of foreign education because the girls who  have had its advantages absorb western ideas so completely that they  dislike to return to their homes where the ordinary conditions of a Chinese  household exist. Nevertheless, if the women of China are ever to be  emancipated it must come through their own education as well as that of the  men.    One of the first results of foreign influence is to delay marriage, and in  some instances the early betrothal with its attendant miseries. The evil  which results from this custom can hardly be overestimated. It happens not  infrequently that two children are betrothed in infancy, the respective  families being in like circumstances at the time. The opportunity perhaps  is offered to the girl to attend school and she may even go through  college, but an inexorable custom brings her back to her parents' home,  forces her to submit to the engagement made in babyhood and perhaps ruins  her life through marriage with a man of no higher social status or  intelligence than a coolie.    Among the few girls imbued with western civilization a spirit of revolt is  slowly growing, and while it is impossible for them to break down the  barriers of ages, yet in many instances they waive aside what would seem an  unsurmountable precedent and insist upon having some voice in the choosing  of their husbands.    While in Yen-ping we were invited to attend the semi-foreign wedding of a  girl who had been brought up in the Woman's School and who was qualified to  be a \"Bible Woman\" or native Christian teacher. It was whispered that she  had actually met her betrothed on several occasions, but on their wedding  day no trace of recognition was visible, and the marriage was performed  with all the punctilious Chinese observances compatible with a Christian  ceremony.    Precedent required of this little bride, although she might have been  radiantly happy at heart, and undoubtedly was, to appear tearful and  shrinking and as she was escorted up the aisle by her bridesmaid one might  have thought she was being led to slaughter. White is not becoming to the  Chinese and besides it is a sign of mourning, so she had chosen pink for  her wedding gown and had a brilliant pink veil over her carefully oiled  hair.    After"]]]
