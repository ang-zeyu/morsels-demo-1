Half an hour away from the town are situated two large dingy buildings.  Here the traveler is transferred to the care of the miners. These men  wear dark and generally steel-blue colored jackets, of ample girth,  descending to the hips, with pantaloons of a similar hue, a leather  apron tied on behind, and a rimless green felt hat which resembles a  decapitated nine-pin. In such a garb, with the exception of the  \"back-leather,\" the visitor is also clad, and a miner, his \"leader,\"  after lighting his mine-lamp, conducts him to a gloomy entrance  resembling a chimney-hole, descends as far as the breast, gives him a  few directions relative to grasping the ladder, and requests him to  follow fearlessly. The affair is entirely devoid of danger, though it at  first appears quite otherwise to those unacquainted with the mysteries  of mining. Even the putting on of the dark convict-dress awakens very  peculiar sensations. Then one must clamber down on all fours, the dark  hole is so _very_ dark, and Lord only knows how long the ladder may be!  But we soon remark that this is not the only ladder descending into the  black eternity, for there are many, of from fifteen to twenty rounds  apiece, each standing upon a board capable of supporting a man, and from  which a new hole leads in turn to a new ladder. I first entered the  \"Caroline,\" the dirtiest and most disagreeable Caroline with whom I ever  had the pleasure of becoming acquainted. The rounds of the ladders were  covered with wet mud. And from one ladder we descend to another with the  guide ever in advance, continually assuring us that there was no danger  so long as we held firmly to the rounds and did not look at our feet,  and that we must not for our lives tread on the side plank, where the  buzzing barrel-rope runs, and where two weeks ago a careless man was  knocked down, unfortunately breaking his neck by the fall. Far below is  a confused rustling and humming, and we continually bump against beams  and ropes which are in motion, winding up and raising barrels of broken  ore or of water. Occasionally we pass galleries hewn in the rock, called  \"stulms,\" where the ore may be seen growing, and where some solitary  miner sits the livelong day, wearily hammering pieces from the walls. I  did not descend to those deepest depths where it is reported that the  people on the other side of the world, in America, may be heard crying,  \"Hurrah for Lafayette!\" Between ourselves, where I did go seemed to me  deep enough in all conscience; there was an endless roaring and  rattling, uncanny sounds of machinery, the rush of subterranean streams,  sickening clouds of ore-dust continually rising, water dripping on all  sides, and the miner's lamp gradually growing dimmer and dimmer. The  effect was really benumbing, I breathed with difficulty, and had trouble  in holding to the slippery rounds. It was not _fright_ which overpowered  me, but, oddly enough, down there in the depths, I remembered that a  year before, about the same time, I had been in a storm on the North  Sea, and I now felt that it would be an agreeable change could I feel  the rocking of the ship, hear the wind with its thunder-trumpet tones,  while amid its lulls sounded the hearty cry of the sailors, and all  above was freshly swept by God's own free air--yes, sir! Panting for  air, I rapidly climbed several dozens of ladders, and my guide led me  through a narrow and very long gallery toward the \"Dorothea\" mine. Here  it was airier and fresher, and the ladders were cleaner, though at the  same time longer and steeper, than in the \"Caroline.\" I felt revived and  more cheerful, particularly as I again observed traces of human beings.  Far below I saw wandering, wavering lights; miners with their lamps came  upwards one by one with the greeting, \"Good luck to you!\" and, receiving  the same salutation from us, went onwards and upwards. Something like a  friendly and quiet, yet, at the same time, painful and enigmatical  recollection flitted across my mind as I met the deep glances and  earnest pale faces of these young and old men, mysteriously illuminated  by their lanterns, and thought how they had worked all day in lonely and  secret places in the mines, and how they now longed for the blessed  light of day and for the glances of wives and children.    My guide himself was an absolutely honest, thoroughly loyal German  specimen. With inward joy he pointed out to me the \"place\" where the  Duke of Cambridge, when he visited the mines, dined with all his train,  and where the long wooden table yet stands; with the accompanying great  chair, made of ore, in which the Duke sat. \"This is to remain as an  eternal memorial,\" said the good miner, and he related with enthusiasm  how many festivities had then taken place, how the entire \"stulm\" had  been adorned with lamps, flowers, and decorations of leaves; how a miner  boy had played on the cithern and sung; how the dear, delighted, fat  Duke had drained many healths, and what a number of miners (himself  especially) would cheerfully die for the dear, fat Duke, and for the  whole house of Hanover. I am moved to my very heart when I see loyalty  thus manifested in all its natural simplicity. It is such a beautiful  sentiment, and such a purely _German_ sentiment! Other people may be  wittier, more intelligent, and more agreeable, but none is so faithful  as the real German race. Did I not know that fidelity is as old as the  world, I would believe that a German heart had invented it. German  fidelity is no modern \"Yours very truly,\" or \"I remain your humble  servant.\" In your courts, ye German princes, ye should cause to be sung,  and sung again, the old ballad of _The Trusty Eckhart and the Base  Burgund_ who slew Eckhart's seven children, and still found him  faithful. Ye have the truest people in the world, and ye err when ye  deem that the old, intelligent, trusty hound has suddenly gone mad, and  snaps at your sacred calves!    And, like German fidelity, the little mine-lamp has guided us  quietly and securely, without much flickering or flaring, through  the labyrinth of shafts and stulms. We ascend out of the gloomy  mountain-night--sunlight flashes around--\"Good luck to you!\"    Most of the miners dwell in Clausthal, and in the adjoining small town  of Zellerfeld. I visited several of these brave fellows, observed their  little households, heard many of their songs, which they skilfully  accompany with their favorite instrument, the cithern, and listened to  old mining legends, and to their prayers which they are accustomed to  offer daily in company ere they descend the gloomy shaft; and many a  good prayer did I offer up with them! One old climber even thought that  I ought to remain among them, and become a man of the mines; but as I  took my leave notwithstanding, he gave me a message to his brother, who  dwelt near Goslar, and many kisses for his darling niece.    Tranquil even to stagnation as the life of these people may appear, it  is, nevertheless, a real and vivid life. That ancient trembling crone  who sits behind the stove opposite the great clothes-press may have been  there for a quarter of a century, and all her thinking and feeling is,  beyond a doubt, intimately blended with every corner of the stove and  the carvings of the press. And clothes-press and stove _live_--for a  human being hath breathed into them a portion of her soul.    It was only in such deeply contemplative life as this, in such \"direct  relationship\" between man and the things of the outer world, that the  German fairy tale could originate, the peculiarity of which consists in  the fact that in it not only animals and plants, but also objects  apparently inanimate, speak and act. To thoughtful harmless people in  the quiet homeliness of their lowly mountain cabins or forest huts, the  inner life of these objects was gradually revealed; they acquired a  necessary and consistent character, a sweet blending of fantastic humor  and purely human sentiment, and thus we find in the fairy tale--as  something marvelous and yet at the same time quite natural--the pin and  the needle wandering forth from the tailor's home and losing their way  in the dark; the straw and the coal seeking to cross the brook and  coming to grief; the dust-pan and broom quarreling and fighting on the  stairs. Thus the mirror, when interrogated, shows the image of the  fairest lady, and even drops of blood begin to utter obscure and fearful  words of the deepest compassion. And this is the reason why our life in  childhood is so infinitely significant, for then all things are of the  same importance, nothing escapes our attention, there is equality in  every impression; while, when more advanced in years, we must act with  design, busy ourselves more exclusively with particulars, carefully  exchange the pure gold of observation for the paper currency of book  definitions, and win in _breadth_ of life what we lost in depth.    _Now,_ we are grown-up, respectable people, we often inhabit new  dwellings; the housemaid daily cleans them and changes at her will the  position of the furniture, which interests us but little, as it is  either new or may belong today to Jack, tomorrow to Isaac. Even our very  clothes are strange to us; we hardly know how many buttons there are on  the coat we wear--for we change our garments as often as possible, and  none of them remains deeply identified with our external or inner  history. We can hardly remember how that brown vest once looked, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12519"],[0,"The Virginia Housewife; Or, Methodical Cook (#13)"],[1,"over  them, and serve them up hot.           *       *       *       *       *    TO DRESS DUCKS WITH ONIONS.    Stuff the ducks as before, cut the roots off small onions, blanch them  in scalding water, then pick and put them into a stew pan with a little  gravy, set them over a gentle fire, and let them simmer; when they are  done, thicken them with cream and flour, and when the ducks are roasted,  dish them, pour the ragout of onions over, and serve them up hot.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST A CALF'S HEAD.    Wash and pick the head very nicely; having taken out the brains and  tongue, prepare a good quantity of forced meat, with veal and suet well  seasoned; fill the hole of the head with this forced meat, skewer and  tie it together upon the spit, and roast it for an hour and a half. Beat  up the brains with a little sage and parsley shred fine, a little salt,  and the yelks of two or three eggs; boil the tongue, peel, and cut it  into large dice, fry that with the brains, also some of the forced meat  made up into balls, and slices of bacon. Let the sauce be strong gravy,  with oysters, mushrooms, capers, and a little white wine thickened.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE A DISH OF CURRY AFTER THE EAST INDIAN MANNER.    Cut two chickens as for fricassee, wash them clean, and put them in a  stew pan with as much water as will cover them; sprinkle them with a  large spoonful of salt, and let them boil till tender, covered close all  the time, and skim them well; when boiled enough, take up the chickens,  and put the liquor of them into a pan, then put half a pound of fresh  butter in the pan, and brown it a little; put into it two cloves of  garlic, and a large onion sliced, and let these all fry till brown,  often shaking the pan; then put in the chickens, and sprinkle over them  two or three spoonsful of curry powder; then cover the pan close, and  let the chickens do till brown, often shaking the pan; then put in the  liquor the chickens were boiled in, and let all stew till tender; if  acid is agreeable squeeze the juice of a lemon or orange in it.           *       *       *       *       *    DISH OF RICE TO BE SERVED UP WITH THE CURRY, IN A DISH BY ITSELF.    Take half a pound of rice, wash it clean in salt and water--then put it  into two quarts of boiling water, and boil it briskly twenty minutes;  strain it through a colander and shake it into a dish, but do not touch  it with your fingers nor with a spoon.    Beef, veal, mutton, rabbits, fish, &c. may be curried and sent to table  with or without the dish of rice.    Curry powder is used as a fine flavoured seasoning for fish, fowls,  steaks, chops, veal cutlets, hashes, minces, alamodes, turtle soup, and  in all rich dishes, gravies, sauce, &c. &c.           *       *       *       *       *    OCHRA AND TOMATOS.    Take an equal quantity of each, let the ochra be young, slice it, and  skin the tomatos; put them into a pan without water, add a lump of  butter, an onion chopped fine, some pepper and salt, and stew them one  hour.           *       *       *       *       *    GUMBO--A WEST INDIA DISH.    Gather young pods of ochra, wash them clean, and put them in a pan with  a little water, salt and pepper, stew them till tender, and serve them  with melted butter. They are very nutritious, and easy of digestion.           *       *       *       *       *    PEPPER POT.    Boil two or three pounds of tripe, cut it in pieces, and put it on the  fire with a knuckle of veal, and a sufficient quantity of water; part of  a pod of pepper, a little spice, sweet herbs according to your taste,  salt, and some dumplins; stew it till tender, and thicken the gravy with  butter and flour.           *       *       *       *       *    SPANISH METHOD OF DRESSING GIBLETS.    Take the entrails of fat full grown fowls, empty them of their  contents--open them with a sharp knife, scrape off the inner coat; wash  them clean, and put them on to boil with the liver, gizzard, and other  giblets; add salt, pepper, and chopped onion--when quite tender, set  them by to cool; put some nice dripping or butter in a pan, when it  boils put the giblets, add salt, fry them a nice brown; when nearly  done, break six eggs in a bowl, beat them a little, pour them over the  giblets, stir them for a few minutes, and serve them up.           *       *       *       *       *    PASTE FOR MEAT DUMPLINS.    Chop half a pound of suet very fine--add one and a quarter pound of  flour, and a little salt--mix it up with half a pint of milk, knead it  till it looks light; take a bowl of proper size, rub the inside with  butter, roll out the paste and lay it in; parboil beef steaks,  mutton-chops, or any kind of meat you like; season it and lay it in the  bowl--fill it with rich gravy, close the paste over the top--get a very  thick cloth that will keep out the water; wet and flour it, place it  over the top of the bowl--gather it at bottom and tie it very securely;  the water must boil when you put it in--when done, dip the top in cold  water for a moment, that the cloth may not stick to the paste; untie and  take it off carefully--put a dish on the bowl and turn it over--if  properly made, it will come out without breaking; have gravy in a boat  to eat with it.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE AN OLLO--A SPANISH DISH.    Take two pounds beef, one pound mutton, a chicken, or half a pullet, and  a small piece of pork; put them into a pot with very little water, and  set it on the fire at ten o'clock, to stew gently; you must sprinkle  over it an onion chopped small, some pepper and salt, before you pour in  the water; at half after twelve, put into the pot two or three apples or  pears, peeled and cut in two, tomatos with the skin taken off, cimblins  cut in pieces, a handful of mint chopped, lima beans, snaps, and any  kind of vegetable you like; let them all stew together till three  o'clock; some cellery tops cut small, and added at half after two, will  improve it much.           *       *       *       *       *    ROPA VEIJA--SPANISH.    Peel the skin from ripe tomatos, put them in a pan with a spoonful of  melted butter, some pepper and salt, shred cold meat or fowl; put it in,  and fry it sufficiently.           *       *       *       *       *    CHICKEN PUDDING, A FAVOURITE VIRGINIA DISH.    Beat ten eggs very light, add to them a quart of rich milk, with a  quarter of a pound of butter melted, and some pepper and salt; stir in  as much flour as will make a thin good batter; take four young chickens,  and after cleaning them nicely, cut off the legs, wings, &c. put them  all in a sauce pan, with some salt and water, and a bundle of thyme and  parsley, boil them till nearly done, then take the chicken from the  water and put it in the batter pour it in a dish, and bake it; send nice  white gravy in a boat.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE POLENTA.    Put a large spoonful of butter in a quart of water, wet your corn meal  with cold water in a bowl, add some salt, and make it quite smooth, then  put it in the buttered water when it is hot, let it boil, stirring it  continually till done; as soon as you can handle it, make it into a  ball, and let it stand till quite cold--then cut it in thin slices, lay  them in the bottom of a deep dish so as to cover it, put on it slices of  cheese, and on that a few bits of butter; then mush, cheese and butter,  until the dish is full; put on the top thin slices of cheese and butter,  put the dish in a quick oven; twenty or thirty minutes will bake it.           *       *       *       *       *    MACARONI.    Boil as much macaroni as will fill your dish, in milk and water, till  quite tender; drain it on a sieve sprinkle a little salt over it, put a  layer in your dish then cheese and butter as in the polenta, and bake it  in the same manner.           *       *       *       *       *    MOCK MACARONI.    Break some crackers in small pieces, soak them in milk until they are  soft; then use them as a substitute for macaroni.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE CROQUETS.    Take cold fowl or fresh meat of any kind, with slices of ham, fat and  lean--chop them together very fine, add half as much stale bread grated,  salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, a tea-spoonful of made mustard, a  table-spoonful of catsup, and a lump of butter; knead all well together  till it resembles sausage meat, make them in cakes, dip them in the yelk  of an egg beaten, cover them thickly with grated bread, and fry them a  light brown.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE VERMECELLI.    Beat two or three fresh eggs quite light, make them into a stiff paste  with flour, knead it well, and roll it out very thin, cut it in narrow  strips, give them a twist, and dry them quickly on tin sheets. It is an  excellent ingredient in most soups, particularly those that are thin.  Noodles are made in the same manner, only instead of strips they should  be cut in tiny squares and dried. They are also good in soups.           *       *       *       *       *    COMMON PATTIES.    Take some veal, fat and lean, and some slices of boiled ham, chop them  very fine, and season it with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, and a small  quantity of parsley and thyme minced very fine; with a little gravy make  some paste, cover the bottoms of small moulds, fill them with the meat,  put thin lids on, and bake them crisp; five is enough for a side dish.           *       *       *       *       *    EGGS IN CROQUETS.    Boil eighteen eggs, separate the yelks and whites, and cut them in dice;  pour over them a sauce a-la-creme, _(see sauce a-la-creme,)_ add a  little grated bread, mix all well together, and let it get cold; put in  some salt and pepper, make them into cakes, cover them well on both  sides with grated bread, let them stand an hour, and fry them a nice"]]]
