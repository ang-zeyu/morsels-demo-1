Then comes Dhull Dhull,[7]--the name of Hosein's horse at  Kraabaallah;--that selected for the present purpose is a handsome white  Arab, caparisoned according to the olden style of Arabia: due care is  taken to represent the probable sufferings of both animal and rider, by  the bloody horsecloth--the red-stained legs--and the arrows apparently  sticking in several parts of his body; on the saddle is fixed a turban in  the Arabian style, with the bow and arrows;--the bridle, &c. are of very  rich embroidery; the stirrups and mountings of solid silver. The horse and  all its attire are given after Mahurrum, in charity, to a poor Syaad.  Footmen, with the afthaadah[8] and chowrie[9]--peculiar emblems of royalty  in India--attend Dhull Dhull. The friends of the family walk near the  horse; then servants of all classes, to fill up the parade, and many  foot-soldiers, who occasionally fire singly, giving to the whole  description a military effect.    I have seen many other processions on these fifth days of Mahurrum--they  all partake of one style,--some more splendid than others; and the very  poor people parade their banners, with, perhaps, no other accompaniment  than a single drum and fife, and the owner supporting his own banner.    My next letter will contain the procession of Mayndhie, which forms a  grand feature of Mahurrum display on the seventh night.    P.S.--The Najoomee are men generally with some learning, who, for their  supposed skill in astrology, have, in all ages since Mahumud's death, been  more or less courted and venerated by the Mussulmaun people;--I should say,  with those who have not the fear of God stronger in their hearts than the  love of the world and its vanities;--the really religious people  discountenance the whole system and pretended art of the astrologer.    It is wonderful the influence a Najoom acquires in the houses of many  great men in India;--wherever one of these idlers is entertained he is the  oracle to be consulted on all occasions, whether the required solution be  of the utmost importance, or the merest trifling subject. I know those who  submit, with a childlike docility, to the Najoom's opinion, when their  better reason, if allowed to sway, would decide against the astrologer's  prediction. If Najoom says it is not proper for Nuwaub Sahib, or his Begum,  to eat, to drink, to sleep, to take medicine, to go from home, to give  away or accept a gift, or any other action which human reason is the best  guide to decide upon, Najoom has said it,--and Najoom must be right.  Najoom can make peace or war, in the family he overrules, at his pleasure;  and many are the houses divided against themselves by the wicked influence  of a bad man, thus exercising his crafty wiles over the weakness of his  credulous master.--So much for Najoomee; and now for my second notice of  the Eunuchs:--[10]    They are in great request among the highest order of people, and from  their long sojourn in a family, this class of beings are generally  faithfully attached to the interest and welfare of their employer; they  are much in the confidence of their master and mistress, and very seldom  betray their trust. Being frequently purchased, whilst children, from the  base wretches who have stolen them in infancy from the parental roof, they  often grow up to a good old age with the family by whom they are adopted;  they enjoy many privileges denied to other classes of slaves;--are  admitted at all hours and seasons to the zeenahnahs; and often, by the  liberality of their patrons, become rich and honourable;--still 'he is but  a slave', and when he dies, his property reverts to his owner.    In Oude there have been many instances of Eunuchs arriving to great honour,  distinctions, and vast possessions. Al Mauss Ali Khaun[11] was of the  number, within the recollection of many who survive him; he was the  favoured Eunuch of the House of Oude; a person of great attainments, and  gifted with a remarkably superior mind, he was appointed Collector over an  immense tract of country, by the then reigning Nuwaub, whose councils he  benefited by his great judgment. He lived to a good old age, in the  unlimited confidence of his prince, and enjoyed the good will and  affection of all who could appreciate what is valuable in honest integrity.  He died as he had lived, in the most perfect resignation to whatever was  the will of God, in whose mercy he trusted through time, and for eternity.  Many of the old inhabitants speak of him with veneration and respect,  declaring he was the perfect pattern for good Mussulmauns to imitate.    Another remarkable Eunuch, Affrine Khaun,[12] of the Court of Oude, is  well remembered in the present generation also,--the poor having lost a  kind benefactor, and the rich a sensible companion, by his death. His vast  property he had willed to others than the sovereign ruler of Oude (whose  property he actually was), who sent, as is usual in these cases, to take  possession of his estate, immediately after his death; the gates were  barred, and the heirs the Eunuch had chosen to his immense wealth had  taken possession; which I am not aware was disputed afterwards by the  reigning Nuwaub, although by right of the Mussulmaun law, the Nuwaub owned  both the slave and the slave's wealth.    This accounts, perhaps, for the common practice in the higher circles of  the Mussulmaun population, of heaping ornaments and riches on favourite  slaves; the wealth thus expended at one time, is but a loan in the hands  of safe keepers, to revert again to the original proprietor whenever  required by the master, or no longer of service to the slave, who has  neither power to bestow, nor heirs to benefit from the property he may  leave when he dies.    I have frequently observed, among the most exalted ladies, that their  female slaves are very often superbly dressed; and, on occasions of  marriage ceremonies, or other scenes of festivity, they seem proud of  taking them in their suite, handsomely dressed, and richly adorned with  the precious metals, in armlets, bangles, chains, &c.; the lady thus  adding to her own consequence by the display of her attendant slaves. The  same may be observed with regard to gentlemen, who have men-slaves  attending them, and who are very frequently attired in costly dresses,  expensive shawls, and gold ornaments.

[3] Asaf-ud-daula, eldest son of Nawab Shuja'-ud-daula, on whose      death in 1775 he succeeded. He changed the seat of government      from Faizabad to Lucknow, where he died in 1797, and was      buried in the Imambara. He is principally remembered for      his liberality. The merchants, on opening their shops, used to      sing:          _Jisko na de Maula,        Tisko de Asaf-ud-daula_.        Who from Heaven nought receiveth,        To him Asaf-ud-daula giveth.    [4] Mr. H.C. Irwin informs me that the Dargah is situated on the      Crommelin Road, rather more than a mile south-west of the      Machhi Bhawan fort. It was here that Nawab Sa'adat      'Al'i, on his accession, vowed that he would reform his      ways--an intention which was not realized.

It is often confounded with Buraq, the      Assyrian-looking gryphon on which he alleged that he flew to      Mecca.    [8] _Aftabgir_, 'a sun-screen'; see p. 47.    [9] _Chaunri_, the bushy tail of the yak, used as a fly-flapper.    [10] Writing in 1849, General Sleeman remarks that Dom singers and eunuchs      are the virtual rulers of Oudh.--_A Journey through Oudh_, i, introd.      lxi, 178.    [11] Almas ['the diamond'] 'Ali Khan, known as Miyan ['Master']      Almas, according to General Sleeman, was 'the greatest and best man      of any note that Oude has produced. He held for about forty years      Miyanganj and other districts, yielding to the Oude  Government an      annual revenue of more than eighty lacs of rupees [about L850,000].      During this time he kept the people secure in life and property, and      as happy as people in such a state of society can be; and the whole      country under his charge was during his lifetime a garden. He lived      here in great magnificence, and was often visited by his sovereign.'      (Ibid., i. 320 f.). Lord Valentia more than once speaks highly of him      (_Travels_, i. 136, 241). He also notes that the Nawab was      anxiously watching for his death, because, being a slave, under      Muhammadan law his estates reverted to the Crown.--See N.B.E. Baillie,      _Digest of Moohummudan Law_ (1875), 367 f.    [12] Afrin Khan, 'lord of praise', Mr. Irwin informs me, is      mentioned in the _Tarikh Farahbakhsh_ (tr. W. Hoey, 129) as      engaged in negotiations when Nawab Asaf-ud-daula, at the      instigation of Warren Hastings and Haidar Beg, was attempting to      extort money from the Nawab Begam.

Psalm 46:1. First Part.  The church's safety and triumph  among national desolations.    1 God is the refuge of his saints,  When storms of sharp distress invade;  Ere we can offer our complaints  Behold him present with his aid.    2 Let mountains from their seats be hurl'd  Down to the deep, and buried there;  Convulsions shake the solid world,  Our faith shall never yield to fear.    3 Loud may the troubled ocean roar,  In sacred peace our souls abide,  While every nation, every shore,  Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide.    4 There is a stream whose gentle flow  Supplies the city of our God;  Life, love, and joy still gliding thro',  And watering our divine abode.    5 That sacred stream, thine holy word,  That all our raging fear controls:  Sweet peace thy promises afford,  And give new strength to fainting souls.    6 Sion enjoys her monarch's love,  Secure against a threatening hour;  Nor can her firm foundations move,  Built on his truth, and arm'd with pow'r.      Psalm 46:2. Second Part.  God fights for his church.    1 Let Sion in her King rejoice,  Tho' tyrants rage and kingdoms rise;  He utters his almighty voice,  The nations melt, the tumult dies.    2 The Lord of old for Jacob fought,  And Jacob's God is still our aid;  Behold the works his hand has wrought,  What desolations he has made!    3 From sea to sea, thro' all the shores,  He makes the noise of battle cease;  When from on high his thunder roars,  He awes the trembling world to peace.    4 He breaks the bow, he cuts the spear,  Chariots he burns with heavenly flame;  Keep silence all the earth, and hear  The sound and glory of his Name.    5 \"Be still, and learn that I am God,  \"I'll be exalted o'er the lands,  \"I will be known and fear'd abroad,  \"But still my throne in Sion stands.\"    6 O Lord of hosts, almighty King,  While we so near thy presence dwell,  Our faith shall sit secure, and sing  Defiance to the gates of hell.      Psalm 47.  Christ ascending and reigning.    1 O for a shout of sacred joy  To God the sovereign King!  Let every land their tongues employ,  And hymns of triumph sing.    2 Jesus our God ascends on high,  His heavenly guards around  Attend him rising thro' the sky,  With trumpet's joyful sound.    3 While angels shout and praise their King,  Let mortals learn their strains;  Let all the earth his honour sing;  O'er all the earth he reigns.    4 Rehearse his praise with awe profound,  Let knowledge lead the song,  Nor mock him with a solemn sound  Upon a thoughtless tongue.    5 In Israel stood his ancient throne,  He lov'd that chosen race;  But now he calls the world his own,  And heathens taste his grace.    6 The British islands are the Lord's,  There Abraham's God is known,  While powers and princes, shields and swords,  Submit before his throne.      Psalm 48:1. 1-8. First Part.  The church is the honour and safety of a nation.    1 [Great is the Lord our God,  And let his praise be great;  He makes his churches his abode,  His most delightful seat.    2 These temples of his grace,  How beautiful they stand!  The honours of our native place,  And bulwarks of our land.]    3 In Sion God is known  A refuge in distress;  How bright has his salvation shone  Thro' all her palaces!    4 When kings against her join'd,  And saw the Lord was there,  In wild confusion of the mind  They fled with hasty tear.    5 When navies tall and proud  Attempt to spoil our peace,  He sends his tempests roaring loud,  And sinks them in the seas.    6 Oft have our fathers told,  Our eyes have often seen,  How well our God secures the fold  Where his own sheep have been.    7 In every new distress  We'll to his house repair.  We'll think upon his wondrous grace,  And seek deliverance there.      Psalm 48:2. 10-14. Second Part.  The beauty of the church; or,  Gospel worship and order.    1 Far as thy name is known  The world declares thy praise;  Thy saints, O Lord, before thy throne  Their songs of honour raise.    2 With joy let Judah stand  On Sion's chosen hill,  Proclaim the wonders of thy hand,  And counsels of thy will.    3 Let strangers walk around  The city where we dwell,  Compass and view thine holy ground,  And mark the building well.    4 The orders of thy house,  The worship of thy court,  The cheerful songs, the solemn vows;  And make a fair report.    5 How decent and how wise!  How glorious to behold!  Beyond the pomp that charms the eyes,  And rites adorn'd with gold.    6 The God we worship now  Will guide us till we die,  Will be our God while here below,  And ours above the sky.      Psalm 49:1. 8-14. First Part. C. M.  Pride and death; or, The vanity of life and riches.    1 Why doth the man of riches grow  To insolence and pride,  To see his wealth and honours flow  With every rising tide?    2 [Why doth he treat the poor with scorn,  Made of the self-same clay,  And boast as tho' his flesh was born  Of better dust than they?]    3 Not all his treasures can procure  His soul a short reprieve,  Redeem from death one guilty hour,  Or make his brother live.    4 [Life is a blessing can't be sold,  The ransom is too high;  Justice will ne'er be brib'd with gold  That man may never die.]    5 He sees the brutish and the wise,  The timorous and the brave,  Quit their possessions, close their eyes,  And hasten to the grave.    6 Yet 'tis his inward thought and pride,--  \"My house shall ever stand;  \"And that my name may long abide,  \"I'll give it to my land.\"    7 Vain are his thoughts, his hopes are lost,  How soon his memory dies!  His name is written in the dust  Where his own carcase lies.    PAUSE.    8 This is the folly of their way;  And yet their sons, as vain,  Approve the words their fathers say,  And act their works again.    9 Men void of wisdom and of grace,  If honour raise them high.  Live like the beast, a thoughtless race,  And like the beast they die.    10 Laid in the grave like silly sheep,  Death feeds upon them there,  Till the last trumpet break their sleep  In terror and despair.      Psalm 49:2. 14 15. Second Part. C. M.  Death and the resurrection.    1 Ye sons of pride, that hate the just,  And trample on the poor,  When death has brought you down to dust,  Your pomp shall rise no more,    2 The last great day shall change the scene;  When will that hour appear?  When shall the just revive, and reign  O'er all that scorn'd them here?    3 God will my naked soul receive,  When sep'rate from the flesh;  And break the prison of the grave  To raise my bones afresh.    4 Heaven is my everlasting home,  Th' inheritance is sure;  Let men of pride their rage resume,  But I'll repine no more.      Psalm 49:3. L. M.  The rich sinner's death, and the saint's resurrection.    1 Why do the proud insult the poor,  And boast the large estates they have?  How vain are riches to secure  Their haughty owners from the grave!    2 They can't redeem one hour from death,  With all the wealth in which they trust;  Nor give a dying brother breath,  When God commands him down to dust.    3 There the dark earth and dismal shade  Shall clasp their naked bodies round;  That flesh, so delicately fed,  Lies cold, and moulders in the ground.    4 Like thoughtless sheep the sinner dies,  Laid in the grave for worms to eat;  The saints shall in the morning rise,  And find th' oppressor at their feet.    5 His honours perish in the dust,  And pomp and beauty, birth and blood:  That glorious day exalts the just  To full dominion o'er the proud.    6 My Saviour shall my life restore,  And raise me from my dark abode;  My flesh and soul shall part no more,  But dwell for ever near my God.      Psalm 50:1. 1-6. First Part. C. M.  The last judgment; or, The saints rewarded.    1 The Lord, the Judge, before his throne,  Bids the whole earth draw nigh,  The nations near the rising sun,  And near the western sky.    2 No more shall bold blasphemers say,  \"Judgment will ne'er begin,\"  No more abuse his long delay  To impudence and sin.    3 Thron'd on a cloud our God shall come,  Bright flames prepare his way,  Thunder and darkness, fire and storm,  Lead on the dreadful day.    4 Heaven from above his call shall hear,  Attending angels come,  And earth and hell shall know and fear  His justice and their doom.    5 \"But gather all my saints,\" he cries,  \"That made their peace with God,  \"By the Redeemer's sacrifice,  \"And seal'd it with his blood.    6 \"Their faith and works brought forth to light  \"Shall make the world confess  \"My sentence of reward is right,  \"And heaven adore my grace.\"      Psalm 50:2. 8 10 11 14 15 23.  Second Part. C. M.  Obedience is better than sacrifice.    1 Thus saith the Lord, \"the spacious fields  \"And flocks and herds are mine  \"O'er all the cattle of the hills  \"I claim a right divine.    2 \"I ask no sheep for sacrifice,  \"Nor bullocks burnt with fire;  \"To hope and love, to pray and praise,  \"Is all that I require.    3 \"Call upon me when trouble's near,  \"My hand shall set thee free;  \"Then shall thy thankful lips declare  \"The honour due to me.    4 \"The man that offers humble praise,  \"He glorifies me best;  \"And those that tread my holy ways  \"Shall my salvation taste.\"      Psalm 50:3. 1 5 8 16 21 22. 3d Part. C. M.  The judgement of hypocrites.    1 When Christ to judgment shall descend  And saints surround their Lord,  He calls the nations to attend,  And hear his awful word.    2 \"Not for the want of bullocks slain  \"Will I the world reprove;  \"Altars and rites and forms are vain,  \"Without the fire of love.    3 \"And what have hypocrites to do  \"To bring their sacrifice?  \"They call my statutes"]]]
