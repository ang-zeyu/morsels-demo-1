Great Prince, I hear the voice of the matron Gautami. She is  coming this way to inquire after my health. Hasten and conceal  yourself behind the branches.    KING.

[_Sprinkling_ [S']AKOONTALA on the head_.]    The day is closing, my child; come, let us go to the cottage.                                               [_They all move away_.

KING.              [_Returning to his former seat in the arbour. Sighing_.    Alas! how many are the obstacles to the accomplishment of our  wishes!      Albeit she did coyly turn away    Her glowing cheek, and with her fingers guard    Her pouting lips, that murmured a denial    In faltering accents, she did yield herself    A sweet reluctant captive to my will.    As eagerly I raised her lovely face;    But ere with gentle force I stole the kiss,    Too envious Fate did mar my daring purpose.    Whither now shall I betake myself? I will tarry for a brief space  in this bower of creepers, so endeared to me by the presence of  my beloved [S']akoontala.                                                    [_Looking round_.      Here printed on the flowery couch I see    The fair impression of her slender limbs;    Here is the sweet confession of her love,    Traced with her nail upon the lotus-leaf;    And yonder are the withered lily-stalks    That graced her wrist. While all around I view    Things that recall her image, can I quit    This bower, e'en though its living be fled?    A VOICE IN THE AIR.    Great King,      Scarce is our evening sacrifice begun,    When evil demons, lurid as the clouds    That gather round the dying orb of day,    Cluster in hideous troops, obscene and dread,    About our altars, casting far and near    Terrific shadows, while the sacred fire    Sheds a pale lustre o'er their ghostly shapes.    KING.    I come to the rescue, I come.                                                             [_Exit_.           *       *       *       *       *          PRELUDE TO ACT IV.      SCENE.--_The Garden of the Hermitage_.    _Enter_ PRIYAMVADA and ANASUYA in the act of gathering flowers_.    ANASUYA.    Although, dear Priyamvada, it rejoices my heart to think that  [S']akoontala has been happily united to a husband in every respect  worthy of her, by the form of marriage prevalent among Indra's  celestial musicians, nevertheless, I cannot help feeling somewhat  uneasy in my mind.    PRIYAMVADA.    How so?    ANASUYA.    You know that the pious King was gratefully dismissed by the  hermits on the successful termination of their sacrificial rites.  He has now returned to his capital, leaving [S']akoontala under our  care; and it may be doubted whether, in the society of his royal  consorts, he will not forget all that has taken place in this  hermitage of ours.    PRIYAMVADA.    On that score be at ease. Persons of his noble nature are not so  destitute of all honourable feeling. I confess, however, that  there is one point about which I am rather anxious. What, think  you, will Father Kanwa say when he hears what has occurred?    ANASUYA.    In my opinion, he will approve the marriage.    PRIYAMVADA.    What makes you think so?    ANASUYA.    From the first, it was always his fixed purpose to bestow the  maiden on a husband worthy of her; and since heaven has given her  such a husband, his wishes have been realized without any trouble  to himself.    PRIYAMVADA.                      [_Looking at the flower-basket_.    We have gathered flowers enough for the sacred offering, dear  Anasuya.    ANASUYA.    Well, then, let us now gather more, that we may have wherewith to  propitiate the guardian-deity of our dear [S']akoontala.    PRIYAMVADA.    By all means.                                          [_They continue gathering_.    A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.    Ho there! See you not that I am here!    ANASUYA.    That must be the voice of a guest announcing his arrival.    PRIYAMVADA.    Surely, [S']akoontala is not absent from the cottage.    [_Aside_.]    Her heart at least is absent, I fear.    ANASUYA.    Come along, come along; we have gathered flowers  enough.                                                   [_They move away_.    THE SAME VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.    Woe to thee, maiden, for daring to slight a guest like me!      Shall I stand here unwelcomed--even I,    A very mine of penitential merit,    Worthy of all respect? Shalt thou, rash maid,    Thus set at nought the ever sacred ties    Of hospitality? and fix thy thoughts    Upon the cherished object of thy love,    While I am present? Thus I curse thee, then--    He, even he of whom thou thinkest, he    Shall think no more of thee; nor in his heart    Retain thine image. Vainly shalt thou strive    To waken his remembrance of the past;    He shall disown thee, even as the sot,    Roused from his midnight drunkenness, denies    The words he uttered in his revellings.    PRIYAMVADA.    Alas! alas! I fear a terrible misfortune has occurred.  [S']akoontala, from absence of mind, must have offended some guest  whom she was bound to treat with respect.    [_Looking behind the scenes_.]    Ah! yes; I see; and no less a person than the great sage  Durvasas[57], who is known to be most irascible. He it is that  has just cursed her, and is now retiring with hasty strides,  trembling with passion, and looking as if nothing could turn him.  His wrath is like a consuming fire.    ANASUYA.    Go quickly, dear Priyamvada, throw yourself at his feet, and  persuade him to come back, while I prepare a propitiatory  offering[59] for him, with water and refreshments.    PRIYAMVADA.    I will.                                                             [_Exit_.    ANASUYA.    [_Advancing hastily a few steps and stumbling_.    Alas! alas! this comes of being in a hurry. My foot has slipped,  and my basket of flowers has fallen from my hand.                                          [_Stays to gather them up_.    PRIYAMVADA.                               [_Re-entering_    Well, dear Anasuya, I have done my best; but what living being  could succeed in pacifying such a cross-grained, ill-tempered old  fellow? However, I managed to mollify him a little.    ANASUYA                                               [_Smiling_.    Even a little was much for him. Say on.    PRIYAMVADA.    When he refused to turn back, I implored his forgiveness in these  words: 'Most venerable sage, pardon, I beseech you, this first  offence of a young and inexperienced girl, who was ignorant of  the respect due to your saintly character and exalted rank.'    ANASUYA    And what did he reply?    PRIYAMVADA.    'My word must not be falsified; but, at the sight of the ring of  recognition the spell shall cease.' So saying, he disappeared.    ANASUYA.    Oh! then we may breathe again; for, now I think of it, the King  himself, at his departure, fastened on [S']akoontala's finger, as a  token of remembrance, a ring on which his own name was engraved.  She has, therefore, a remedy for her misfortune at her own  command.    PRIYAMVADA.    Come, dear Anasuya, let us proceed with our religious duties.                                                  [_They walk round_.    PRIYAMVADA.                             [_Looking off the stage_.    See, Anasuya, there sits our dear friend, motionless as a statue,  resting her face on her left hand, her whole mind absorbed in  thinking of her absent husband. She can pay no attention to  herself, much less to a stranger.    ANASUYA.    Priyamvada, let this affair never pass our lips. We must spare  our dear friend's feelings. Her constitution is too delicate to  bear much emotion.    PRIYAMVADA.    I agree with you. Who would think of watering a tender jasmine  with hot water?        ACT IV.    Scene.--_The Neighbourhood of the Hermitage.    Enter one of_ Kanwa's Pupils _just arisen from his couch at the  dawn of day_.    PUPIL.    My master, the venerable Kanwa, who is but lately returned from  his pilgrimage, has ordered me to ascertain how the time goes. I  have therefore come into the open air to see if it be still dark.     [_Walking and looking about_.]    Oh! the dawn has already broken.      Lo! in one quarter of the sky, the Moon,    Lord of the herbs and night-expanding flowers,    Sinks towards his bed behind the western hills;    While in the east, preceded by the Dawn,    His blushing charioteer[59], the glorious Sun    Begins his course, and far into the gloom    Casts the first radiance of his orient beams.

You remember Mr. Marchmont, the solicitor?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"He called this morning to ask me to lunch with him and a new client at  the 'Cheshire Cheese.' I accepted and notified him that I should bring  you.\"    \"Why the 'Cheshire Cheese'?\" I asked.    \"Why not? Marchmont's reasons for the selection were, first, that his  client has never seen an old-fashioned London tavern, and second, that  this is Wednesday and he, Marchmont, has a gluttonous affection for a  really fine beef-steak pudding. You don't object, I hope?\"    \"Oh, not at all. In fact, now that you mention it, my own sensations  incline me to sympathize with Marchmont. I breakfasted rather early.\"    \"Then come,\" said Thorndyke. \"The assignation is for one o'clock, and,  if we walk slowly, we shall just hit it off.\"    We sauntered up Inner Temple Lane, and, crossing Fleet Street, headed  sedately for the tavern. As we entered the quaint old-world dining-room,  Thorndyke looked round and a gentleman, who was seated with a companion  at a table in one of the little boxes or compartments, rose and saluted  us.    \"Let me introduce you to my friend Mr. Stephen Blackmore,\" he said as we  approached. Then, turning to his companion, he introduced us by our  respective names.    \"I engaged this box,\" he continued, \"so that we might be private if we  wished to have a little preliminary chat; not that beef-steak pudding is  a great help to conversation. But when people have a certain business  in view, their talk is sure to drift towards it, sooner or later.\"    Thorndyke and I sat down opposite the lawyer and his client, and we  mutually inspected one another. Marchmont I already knew; an elderly,  professional-looking man, a typical solicitor of the old school;  fresh-faced, precise, rather irascible, and conveying a not unpleasant  impression of taking a reasonable interest in his diet. The other man  was quite young, not more than five-and-twenty, and was a fine  athletic-looking fellow with a healthy, out-of-door complexion and an  intelligent and highly prepossessing face. I took a liking to him at the  first glance, and so, I saw, did Thorndyke.    \"You two gentlemen,\" said Blackmore, addressing us, \"seem to be quite  old acquaintances. I have heard so much about you from my friend, Reuben  Hornby.\"    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Marchmont, \"that was a queer case--'The Case of the Red  Thumb Mark,' as the papers called it. It was an eye-opener to  old-fashioned lawyers like myself. We've had scientific witnesses  before--and bullied 'em properly, by Jove! when they wouldn't give the  evidence that we wanted. But the scientific lawyer is something new. His  appearance in court made us all sit up, I can assure you.\"    \"I hope we shall make you sit up again,\" said Thorndyke.    \"You won't this time,\" said Marchmont. \"The issues in this case of my  friend Blackmore's are purely legal; or rather, there are no issues at  all. There is nothing in dispute. I tried to prevent Blackmore from  consulting you, but he wouldn't listen to reason. Here! Waiter! How much  longer are we to be waiters? We shall die of old age before we get our  victuals!\"    The waiter smiled apologetically. \"Yessir!\" said he. \"Coming now, sir.\"  And at this very moment there was borne into the room a Gargantuan  pudding in a great bucket of a basin, which being placed on a  three-legged stool was forthwith attacked ferociously by the  white-clothed, white-capped carver. We watched the process--as did every  one present--with an interest not entirely gluttonous, for it added a  pleasant touch to the picturesque old room, with its sanded floor, its  homely, pew-like boxes, its high-backed settles and the friendly  portrait of the \"great lexicographer\" that beamed down on us from the  wall.    \"This is a very different affair from your great, glittering modern  restaurant,\" Mr. Marchmont remarked.    \"It is indeed,\" said Blackmore, \"and if this is the way in which our  ancestors lived, it would seem that they had a better idea of comfort  than we have.\"    There was a short pause, during which Mr. Marchmont glared hungrily at  the pudding; then Thorndyke said:    \"So you refused to listen to reason, Mr. Blackmore?\"    \"Yes. You see, Mr. Marchmont and his partner had gone into the matter  and decided that there was nothing to be done. Then I happened to  mention the affair to Reuben Hornby, and he urged me to ask your advice  on the case.\"    \"Like his impudence,\" growled Marchmont, \"to meddle with my client.\"    \"On which,\" continued Blackmore, \"I spoke to Mr. Marchmont and he agreed  that it was worth while to take your opinion on the case, though he  warned me to cherish no hopes, as the affair was not really within your  specialty.\"    \"So you understand,\" said Marchmont, \"that we expect nothing. This is  quite a forlorn hope. We are taking your opinion as a mere formality, to  be able to say that we have left nothing untried.\"    \"That is an encouraging start,\" Thorndyke remarked. \"It leaves me  unembarrassed by the possibility of failure. But meanwhile you are  arousing in me a devouring curiosity as to the nature of the case. Is it  highly confidential? Because if not, I would mention that Jervis has now  joined me as my permanent colleague.\"    \"It isn't confidential at all,\" said Marchmont. \"The public are in full  possession of the facts, and we should be only too happy to put them in  still fuller possession, through the medium of the Probate Court, if we  could find a reasonable pretext. But we can't.\"    Here the waiter charged our table with the fussy rapidity of the  overdue.    \"Sorry to keep you waiting, sir. Rather early, sir. Wouldn't like it  underdone, sir.\"    Marchmont inspected his plate critically and remarked:    \"I sometimes suspect these oysters of being mussels; and I'll swear the  larks are sparrows.\"    \"Let us hope so,\" said Thorndyke. \"The lark is better employed 'at  Heaven's gate singing' than garnishing a beef-steak pudding. But you  were telling us about your case.\"    \"So I was. Well it's just a matter of--ale or claret? Oh, claret, I  know. You despise the good old British John Barleycorn.\"    \"He that drinks beer thinks beer,\" retorted Thorndyke. \"But you were  saying that it is just a matter of--?\"    \"A matter of a perverse testator and an ill-drawn will. A peculiarly  irritating case, too, because the defective will replaces a perfectly  sound one, and the intentions of the testator were--er--were--excellent  ale, this. A little heady, perhaps, but sound. Better than your sour  French wine, Thorndyke--were--er--were quite obvious. What he evidently  desired was--mustard? Better have some mustard. No? Well, well! Even a  Frenchman would take mustard. You can have no appreciation of flavour,  Thorndyke, if you take your victuals in that crude, unseasoned state.  And, talking of flavour, do you suppose that there is really any  difference between that of a lark and that of a sparrow?\"    Thorndyke smiled grimly. \"I should suppose,\" said he, \"that they were  indistinguishable; but the question could easily be put to the test of  experiment.\"    \"That is true,\" agreed Marchmont, \"and it would really be worth trying,  for, as you say, sparrows are more easily obtainable than larks. But,  about this will. I was saying--er--now, what was I saying?\"    \"I understood you to say,\" replied Thorndyke, \"that the intentions of  the testator were in some way connected with mustard. Isn't that so,  Jervis?\"    \"That was what I gathered,\" said I.    Marchmont gazed at us for a moment with a surprised expression and then,  laughing good-humouredly, fortified himself with a draught of ale.    \"The moral of which is,\" Thorndyke added, \"that testamentary  dispositions should not be mixed up with beef-steak pudding.\"    \"I believe you're right, Thorndyke,\" said the unabashed solicitor.  \"Business is business and eating is eating. We had better talk over our  case in my office or your chambers after lunch.\"    \"Yes,\" said Thorndyke, \"come over to the Temple with me and I will give  you a cup of coffee to clear your brain. Are there any documents?\"    \"I have all the papers here in my bag,\" replied Marchmont; and the  conversation--such conversation as is possible \"when beards wag all\"  over the festive board--drifted into other channels.    As soon as the meal was finished and the reckoning paid, we trooped out  of Wine Office Court, and, insinuating ourselves through the line of  empty hansoms that, in those days, crawled in a continuous procession  on either side of Fleet Street, betook ourselves by way of Mitre Court  to King's Bench Walk. There, when the coffee had been requisitioned and  our chairs drawn up around the fire, Mr. Marchmont unloaded from his bag  a portentous bundle of papers, and we addressed ourselves to the  business in hand.    \"Now,\" said Marchmont, \"let me repeat what I said before. Legally  speaking, we have no case--not the ghost of one. But my client wished to  take your opinion, and I agreed on the bare chance that you might detect  some point that we had overlooked. I don't think you will, for we have  gone into the case very thoroughly, but still, there is the  infinitesimal chance and we may as well take it. Would you like to read  the two wills, or shall I first explain the circumstances?\"    \"I think,\" replied Thorndyke, \"a narrative of the events in the order of  their occurrence would be most helpful. I should like to know as much as  possible about the testator before I examine the documents.\"    \"Very well,\" said Marchmont. \"Then I will begin with a recital of the  circumstances, which, briefly stated, are these: My client, Stephen  Blackmore, is the son of Mr. Edward Blackmore, deceased. Edward  Blackmore had two brothers who survived him, John, the elder, and  Jeffrey, the younger."]]]
