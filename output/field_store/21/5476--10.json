This was the signal agreed on  with the Tchouktchas, who were to camp where there was plenty of wood.    Every hand was raised to urge on the dogs to this point, and at last,  from the summit of a hill of ice they saw the shore and the blaze of  the fire. The wind was toward them, and the atmosphere heavy. The dogs  smelled the distant camp, and darted almost recklessly forward. At  last they sank near to the Tchouktcha huts, panting and exhausted.    Their allies of the spring were true; they gave them food, of  which both man and beast ate greedily, and then sought repose. The  Tchouktchas had then formed their journey with wonderful success and  rapidity, and had found time to lay in a pretty fair stock of fish.  This they freely shared with Ivan and his party, and were delighted  when he abandoned to them all his tobacco and rum, and part of his  tea.    The Tchouktchas had been four years absent in their wanderings, and  were eager to get home once more to the land of the reindeer, and to  their friends. They were perhaps the greatest travelers of a tribe  noted for its facility of locomotion. And so, with warm expressions  of esteem and friendship on both sides, the two parties separated--the  men of the east making their way on foot, toward the Straits of  Behring.           *       *       *       *       *    VIII.--THE VOYAGE HOME.    Under considerable disadvantages did Sakalar, Ivan, and their friends  prepare for the conclusion of their journey. Their provisions were  very scanty, and their only hope of replenishing their stores was on  the banks of the Vchivaya River, which being in some places pretty  rapid might not be frozen over. Sakalar and his friends determined to  strike out in a straight line. Part of the ivory had to be concealed  and abandoned, to be fetched another time; but as their stock of  provisions was so small, they were able to take the principal part. It  had been resolved, after some debate, to make in a direct line for the  Vchivaya river, and thence to Vijnei-Kolimsk. The road was of a most  difficult, and, in part, unknown character; but it was imperative to  move in as straight a direction as possible. Time was the great enemy  they had to contend with, because their provisions were sufficient for  a limited period only.    The country was at first level enough, and the dogs, after their  rest, made sufficiently rapid progress. At night they had reached the  commencement of a hilly region, while in the distance could be seen  pretty lofty mountains. According to a plan decided on from the first,  the human members of the party were placed at once on short allowance,  while the dogs received as much food as could be reasonably given.  At early dawn the tent was struck, and the dogs were impelled along  the banks of a small river completely frozen. Indeed, after a short  distance, it was taken as the smoothest path. But at the end of a  dozen miles they found themselves in a narrow gorge between two  hills; at the foot of a once foaming cataract, now hard frozen. It  was necessary to retreat some miles, and gain the land once more. The  only path which was now found practicable was along the bottom of some  pretty steep rocks. But the track got narrower and narrower, until the  dogs were drawing along the edge of a terrific precipice with not four  feet of holding. All alighted, and led the dogs, for a false step was  death. Fortunately the path became no narrower, and in one place it  widened out and made a sort of hollow. Here a bitter blast, almost  strong enough to cast them from their feet, checked further progress,  and on that naked spot, under a projecting mass of stone, without  fire, did the whole party halt. Men and dogs huddled together for  warmth, and all dined on raw and frozen fish. A few hours of sleep,  however, were snatched; and then, as the storm abated, they again  advanced. The descent was soon reached, and led into a vast plain  without tree or bush. A range of snow-clad hills lay before them, and  through a narrow gully between two mountains was the only practicable  pathway. But all hearts were gladdened by the welcome sight of some  _argali_, or Siberian sheep, on the slope of a hill. These animals are  the only winter game, bears, and wolves excepted. Kolina was left with  the dogs, and the rest started after the animals, which were pawing in  the snow for some moss or half-frozen herbs. Every caution was used  to approach them against the wind, and a general volley soon sent them  scampering away to the mountain-tops, leaving three behind.    But Ivan saw that he had wounded another, and away he went in chase.  The animal ascended a hill, and then halted. But seeing a man coming  quickly after him, it turned and fled down the opposite side. Ivan was  instantly after him. The descent was steep, but the hunter saw only  the argili, and darted down. He slid rather than ran with fearful  rapidity, and passed the sheep by, seeking to check himself too late.  A tremendous gulf was before him, and his eyes caught an instant  glance of a deep distant valley. Then he saw no more until he found  himself lying still. He had sunk, on the very brink of the precipice,  into a deep snow bank formed by some projecting rock, and had only  thus been saved from instant death. Deeply grateful, Ivan crept  cautiously up the hill-side, though not without his prize, and  rejoined his companions.    The road now offered innumerable difficulties, it was rough and  uneven--now hard, now soft. They made but slow progress for the next  three days, while their provisions began to draw to an end. They had  at least a dozen days more before them. All agreed that they were now  in the very worst difficulty they had been in. That evening they dined  on the last meal of mutton and fish; they were at the foot of a lofty  hill, which they determined to ascend while strength was left. The  dogs were urged up the steep ascent, and after two hours' toil, they  reached the summit. It was a table-land, bleak and miserable, and the  wind was too severe to permit camping. On they pushed, and camped a  little way down its sides.    The next morning the dogs had no food, while the men had nothing but  large draughts of warm tea. But it was impossible to stop. Away they  hurried, after deciding that, if nothing turned up the next morning,  two or three of the dogs must be killed to save the rest. Little was  the ground they got over, with hungry beasts and starving men, and  all were glad to halt near a few dried larches. Men and dogs eyed each  other suspiciously, The animals, sixty-four in number, had they not  been educated to fear man, would have soon settled the matter. But  there they lay, panting and faint--to start up suddenly with a fearful  howl. A bear was on them. Sakalar fired, and then in rushed the dogs,  savage and fierce. It was worse than useless, it was dangerous, for  the human beings of the party to seek to share this windfall. It was  enough that the dogs had found something to appease their hunger.    Sakalar, however, knew that his faint and weary companions could not  move the next day if tea alone were their sustenance that night. He  accordingly put in practice one of the devices of his woodcraft. The  youngest of the larches was cut down, and the coarse outside bark was  taken off. Then every atom of the soft bark was peeled off the tree,  and being broken into small pieces, was cast into the boiling pot,  already full of water. The quantity was great, and made a thick  substance. Round this the whole party collected, eager for the moment  when they could fall to. But Sakalar was cool and methodical even in  that terrible hour. He took a spoon, and quietly skimmed the pot,  to take away the resin that rose to the surface. Then gradually the  bark melted away, and presently the pot was filled by a thick paste,  and looked not unlike glue. All gladly ate, and found it nutritive,  pleasant, and warm. They felt satisfied when the meal was over, and  were glad to observe that the dogs returned to the camp completely  satisfied also, which, under the circumstances, was matter of great  gratification.    In the morning, after another mess of larch-bark soup, and after a  little tea, the adventurers again advanced on their journey. They were  now in an arid, bleak, and terrible plain of vast extent. Not a tree,  not a shrub, not an elevation was to be seen. Starvation was again  staring them in the face, and no man knew when this dreadful plain  would end. That night the whole party cowered in their tent without  fire, content to chew a few tea-leaves preserved from the last meal.  Serious thoughts were now entertained of abandoning their wealth in  that wild region. But as none pressed the matter very hardly, the  ledges were harnessed again next morning, and the dogs driven on. But  man and beast were at the last gasp, and not ten miles were traversed  that day, the end of which brought them to a large river, on the  borders of which were some trees. Being wide and rapid, it was not  frozen, and there was still hope, The seine was drawn from a sledge,  and taken into the water. It was fastened from one side to another of  a narrow gut, and there left. It was of no avail examining it until  morning, for the fish only come out at night.    There was not a man of the party who had his exact sense about him,  while the dogs lay panting on the snow, their tongues hanging out,  their eyes glaring with almost savage fury. The trees round the bank  were large and dry, and not one had an atom of soft bark on it. All  the resource they had was to drink huge draughts of tea, and then  seek sleep. Sakalar set the example, and the Kolimsk men, to whom such  scenes were not new, followed his advice; but Ivan walked up and down  before the tent. A huge fire had been made, which was amply fed by the  wood of the river bank, and it blazed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13722"],[0,"Youth and Sex: Dangers and Safeguards for Girls and Boys (#13)"],[1,"fondness for girls, deceitfulness. Of these results, the  loss of will-power leaves the boy a prey not only to the temptations  of impurity, but to every other form of temptation: the deceitfulness  destroys his self-respect and turns his life into a sham.\"    Of incomparably greater importance than Acton's wide but abnormal  experience and my own narrow but normal experience is the experience  of Dr. Clement Dukes, which is very wide and perfectly normal. No man  has probably been in so good a position for forming an estimate as he  has been. Dr. Dukes thus sums up his opinion: \"The harm which results  is moral, intellectual, and physical. _Physically_ it is a frequent  drain at a critical time of life when nature is providing for growth  and development, and is ill able to bear it; it is a powerful nervous  shock to the system ill-prepared to meet it.... It also causes  muscular and mental debility, loss of spirit and manliness, and  occasional insanity, suicide and homicide. Moreover it leads to  further uncontrollable passions in early manhood.... Further, this  vice enfeebles the _intellectual_ powers, inducing lethargy and  obtuseness, and incapacity for hard mental work. And last, and most of  all, it is an _immorality_ which stains the whole character and  undermines the life.\"    In this passage Dr. Dukes refers to the intellectual and moral harm of  self-abuse as well as to its physical consequences. Intimately  connected as these are with one another, I am here attempting to give  them separate treatment. It is, however, impossible to treat perverted  sex-knowledge and self-abuse separately; for though in young boys they  are found independently of one another, and sometimes co-exist in  elder boys without any intimate conscious association, their results  are identical. In the following pages, therefore, I shall refer to  them jointly as impurity.    The earliest evil which springs from impurity is the destruction of  the intimacy which has hitherto existed between the boy and his  parents. Closely associated with this is that duplicity of life which  results from secrets which may be shared with the coarse but must be  jealously concealed from everyone who is respected. Untold harm  follows these changes in a lad. Hitherto he has had nothing to conceal  from his mother--unless, indeed, his parents have been foolish enough  to drive him into deception by undue severity over childish mistakes,  and accidents, and moral lapses. Every matter which has occupied his  thoughts he has freely shared with those who can best lead him into  the path of moral health.    Henceforth all is changed. The lad has his own inner life which he  must completely screen from the kind eyes which have hitherto been his  spiritual lights. Concealment is soon found to be an easy thing. Acts  and words are things of which others may take cognisance; the inner  life no one can ever know. A world is opened to the lad in which the  restraints of adult opinion are not felt at all and the guidance and  inspiration of a father's or mother's love never come. How completely  this is the case in regard to impurity the reader will hardly doubt if  he remembers that all parents believe their boys to be innocent, and  that some 90 per cent. of them are hopelessly hoodwinked. But this  double life is not long confined to the subject of purity. The  concealment which serves one purpose excellently can be made to serve  another; and henceforth parents and adult friends need never know  anything but what they are told. It is a sad day for the mother when  first she realises that the old frankness has gone; it is a very, very  much sadder day for the boy. There is no fibre of his moral being but  is, or will be, injured by this divorce of home influences and by this  ever-accumulating burden of guilty memories. \"His mother may not know  why this is so,\" writes Canon Lyttelton; \"the only thing she may be  perfectly certain of is that the loss will never be quite made up as  long as life shall last.\"    Another injury done by impurity to the growing mind of the lad is  that, in all matters relating to sex, he learns to look merely for  personal enjoyment. In every other department of life he is moved by  a variety of motives: by the desire to please, the desire to excel, by  devotion to duty, by the love of truth, and by many other desires.  Even in gratifying the appetite most nearly on the same plane as the  sexual appetite--namely, that of hunger--he has more or less regard  for his own well-being, more or less consideration for the wishes of  others, and a constant desire to attain the standard expected of him.  Meanwhile, as regards the sexual appetite--the racial importance of  which is great; and the regulation of which is of infinite importance  for himself, for those who may otherwise become its victims, for the  wife he may one day wed, and for the children, legitimate or  illegitimate, that he may beget--his one idea is personal enjoyment.  One deplorable result of this idea will be adverted to in the next  chapter.    When boyish impurity involves a coarse way of looking at sexual  relations, as it always must when these are matters of common talk and  jest, the boy suffers a loss which prejudicially affects the whole  tone of his mind and every department of his conduct--I mean the loss  of reverence. It is those things alone which are sacred to us, those  things about which we can talk only with friends, and about which we  can jest with no one, that have inspiration in them, that can give us  power to follow our ideals and to lay a restraining hand on the brute  within us. Fortunately the self-control which manifests itself in  heroism, in good form, and in the sportsmanlike spirit is sacred to  almost all. To most, a mother's love is sacred. To many, all that is  implied in the word religion. To a few, sexual passion and the great  manifestations of human genius in poetry, music, painting, sculpture,  and architecture. Exactly in proportion as these things are profaned  by jest and mockery, is the light of the soul quenched and man  degraded to the level of the beast. Considering how large a part the  sex-passion plays in the lives of most men and women; considering how  it permeates the literature and art of the World and is--as the basis  of the home--the most potent factor in social life, its profanation is  a terrible loss, and the habit of mind which such profanation  engenders cannot fail to weaken the whole spirit of reverence. I must  confess that the man who jests over sex relations is to me  incomparably lower than the man who sustains clean but wholly  illegitimate sex relations; and while I am conscious of a strong  movement of friendship towards a lad who has admitted impurity in his  life but retains reverence for purity, it is hard to feel anything but  repulsion towards one who profanes the subject of sex with coarse and  ribald talk.    As a result of the two evils of which I have now spoken, together with  the physical effects of masturbation, young men become powerless to  face the sexual temptations of manhood; and many, who in all other  relations of life are admirable, sink in this matter into the mire of  prostitution or the less demoralising, but far crueller, sin of  seduction.    Thrown on the streets, usually through no fault of her own, often  merely from an over-trustful love, the prostitute sinks to the lowest  depths of degradation and despair. It is not merely that she sells to  every comer, clean or bestial, without even the excuse of appetite or  of passion, what should be yielded alone to love; but it is also that  to do this she poisons body and mind with spirit-drinking, leads a  life of demoralising indolence and self-indulgence, is cut off from  all decent associations, and sinks, under the combined influence of  these things and of fell disease, into a loathsome creature whom not  the lowest wants; sinks into destitution, misery, suicide, or the  outcast's early grave. Writing of the young man who is familiar with  London, the Headmaster of Eton says: \"He cannot fail to see around him  a whole world of ruined life--a ghastly varnish of gaiety spread over  immeasurable tracts of death and corruption; a state of things so  heart-rending and so hopeless that on calm consideration of it the  brain reels, and sober-minded people who, from motives of pity, have  looked the hideous evil in the face, have asserted that nothing in  their experience has seemed to threaten them so nearly with a loss of  reason.\"    Into the contamination of this inferno, into active support of this  cruel infamy, many and many a young man is led by the impurity of his  boyhood. Such at least is the conclusion of some who know boys best.  Thus Dr. Dukes writes:    \"This evil, of which I have spoken so long and so freely, is, I  believe, _the root of the evil of prostitution_ and similar vices; and  if this latter evil is to be mitigated, it can only be, to my mind,  by making the life of the schoolboy purer.    \"How is it possible to put a stop to this terrible social evil? How is  it possible to _elevate women_ while the demand for them for base  purposes is so great? We must go to the other end of the scale and  make men better; we must train young boys more in purity of life and  chastity BEFORE their passions become uncontrollable.    \"Whereas the cry of every moralist and philanthropist is, 'Let us put  a stop to this prostitution, open and clandestine.' This cannot be  effected at present, much as it is to be desired; the demand for it is  too great, even possibly greater than the supply. If we wish to  eradicate it, we must go to the fountainhead and make those who create  the demand purer, so that, the demand falling off, the supply will be  curtailed.\"[C]    [Footnote C: _The Preservation of Health_, p. 161.]    To this I venture to add that by teaching chastity we not merely  decrease the demand"]]]
