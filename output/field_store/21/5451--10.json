In  spite of Leopold Mozart's remonstrance, the young people were married  August 16, 1782.    Constanza, though a devoted wife, was inexperienced in home keeping.  The young couple were soon involved in many financial troubles  from which there seemed no way out, except by means of some Court  appointment. This the Emperor in spite of his sincere interest in the  composer, seemed disinclined to give.    Mozart now thought seriously of a journey to London and Paris, but  his father's urgent appeal that he would wait and exercise patience,  delayed him. Meanwhile he carried out an ardent desire to pay a visit  to his father and sister in Salzburg, to present to them his bride.  It was a very happy visit, and later on, when Mozart and his wife were  again settled in Vienna, they welcomed the father on a return visit.  Leopold found his son immersed in work, and it gladdened his heart to  see the appreciation in which his playing and compositions were held.  One happy evening they spent with Josef Haydn who, after hearing some  of Mozart's quartets played, took the father aside, saying: \"I declare  before God, as a man of honor, that your son is the greatest composer  I know, either personally or by reputation. He has taste, but more  than that the most consummate knowledge of the art of composition.\"    This happy time was to be the last meeting between father and son.  Soon after Leopold's return to Salzburg, he was stricken with illness,  and passed away May 28, 1787. The news reached the composer shortly  after he had achieved one of the greatest successes of his life. The  performances of his latest opera, \"The Marriage of Figaro,\" had been  hailed with delight by enthusiastic crowds in Vienna and Prague; its  songs were heard at every street corner, and village ale house. \"Never  was anything more complete than the triumph of Mozart and his 'Nozze  di Figaro,'\" wrote a singer and friend.--\"And for Mozart himself, I  shall never forget his face when lighted up with the glowing rays of  genius; it is as impossible to describe as to paint sunbeams.\"    Despite the success of Figaro, Mozart was still a poor man, and must  earn his bread by giving music lessons. Finally the Emperor, hoping  to keep him in Germany, appointed him Chamber-composer at a salary  of about eighty pounds a year. It must have seemed to Mozart and his  friends a beggarly sum for the value his Majesty professed to set upon  the composer's services to art. \"Too much for the little I am asked to  produce, too little for what I could produce,\" were the bitter words  he penned on the official return stating the amount of his salary.    Mozart was inclined to be somewhat extravagant in dress and household  expenditure, also very generous to any one who needed assistance.  These trials, added to the fact that his wife was frequently in  ill health, and not very economical, served to keep the family in  continual straits. Occasionally they were even without fire or food,  though friends always assisted such dire distress. Mozart's father had  declared procrastination was his son's besetting sin. Yet the son was  a tireless worker, never idle. In September, 1787, he was at Prague,  writing the score of his greatest opera, \"Don Giovanni\"; the time was  short, as the work was to be produced October 29. On the evening of  the 28th it was found he had not yet written the overture. It only  had to be written down, for this wonderful genius had the music quite  complete in his head. He set to work, while his wife read fairy tales  aloud to keep him awake, and gave him strong punch at intervals. By  seven o'clock next morning the score was ready for the copyist. It was  played in the evening without rehearsal, with the ink scarcely dry on  the paper.    Even the successes of \"Don Giovanni,\" which was received with thunders  of applause, failed to remedy his desperate financial straits. Shortly  after this his pupil and patron, Prince Karl Lichnowsky, proposed he  should accompany him to Berlin. Mozart gladly consented, hoping for  some betterment to his fortunes. The King of Prussia received him  with honor and respect and offered him the post of Capellmeister, at  a salary equal to about three thousand dollars. This sum would have  liberated him from all his financial embarrassments, and he was  strongly tempted to accept. But loyalty to his good Emperor Josef  caused him to decline the offer.    The month of July, 1791, found Mozart at home in Vienna at work on a  magic opera to help his friend Salieri, who had taken a little theater  in the suburb of Wieden. One day he was visited by a stranger, a tall  man, who said he came to commission Mozart to compose a Requiem. He  would neither give his own name nor that of the person who had sent  him.    Mozart was somewhat depressed by this mysterious commission; however  he set to work on the Requiem at once. The composing of both this and  the fairy opera was suddenly interrupted by a pressing request that he  would write an opera for the coronation of Leopold II at Prague. The  ceremony was fixed for September 6, so no time was to be lost. Mozart  set out at once for Prague. The traveling carriage was at the door.  As he was about to enter it, the mysterious stranger suddenly appeared  and enquired for the Requiem. The composer could only promise to  finish on his return, when hastily entering his carriage, he drove  away.    The new opera, \"La Clemenza di Tito,\" was finished in time and  performed, but was received somewhat indifferently. Mozart returned to  Vienna with spirits depressed and body exhausted by overwork. However,  he braced himself anew, and on September 30th, the new fairy opera,  the \"Magic Flute,\" was produced, and its success increased with each  performance.    The Requiem was not yet finished and to this work Mozart now turned.  But the strain and excitement he had undergone for the past few months  had done their work: a succession of fainting spells overcame him, and  the marvelous powers which had always been his seemed no longer at his  command. He feared he would not live to complete the work. \"It is for  myself I am writing the Requiem,\" he said sadly to Constanza, one day.    On the evening of December 4, friends who had gathered at his bedside,  handed him, at his desire, the score of the Requiem, and, propped up  by pillows he tried to sing one of the passages. The effort was too  great; the manuscript slipped from his nerveless hand and he fell back  speechless with emotion. A few hours later, on the morning of December  5, 1791, this great master of whom it was prophesied that he would  cause all others to be forgotten, passed from the scene of his many  struggles and greater triumphs.          VII    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN      The Shakespeare of the realm of music, as he has been called, first  saw the light on December 16, 1770, in the little University town  of Bonn, on the Rhine. His father, Johann Beethoven, belonged to the  court band of the Elector of Cologne. The family were extremely poor.  The little room, where the future great master was born, was so low,  that a good-sized man could barely stand upright in it. Very small  it was too, and not very light either, as it was at the back of the  building and looked out on a walled garden.    The fame of young Mozart, who was acclaimed everywhere as a marvelous  prodigy, had naturally reached the father's ears. He decided to train  the little Ludwig as a pianist, so that he should also be hailed as  a prodigy and win fame and best of all money for the poverty-stricken  family. So the tiny child was made to practice scales and finger  exercises for hours together. He was a musically gifted child, but how  he hated those everlasting tasks of finger technic, when he longed to  join his little companions, who could run and play in the sunshine. If  he stopped his practice to rest and dream a bit, the stern face of his  father would appear at the doorway, and a harsh voice would call out,  \"Ludwig! what are you doing? Go on with your exercises at once. There  will be no soup for you till they are finished.\"    The father, though harsh and stern, wished his boy to have as thorough  a knowledge of music as his means would permit. The boy was also sent  to the public school, where he picked up reading and writing, but did  not make friends very quickly with the other children. The fact  was the child seemed wholly absorbed in music; of music he dreamed  constantly; in the companionship of music he never could be lonely.    When Ludwig was nine his father, regarding him with satisfaction and  some pride, declared he could teach him no more--and another master  must be found. Those childhood years of hard toil had resulted in  remarkable progress, even with the sort of teaching he had received.  The circumstances of the family had not improved, for poverty had  become acute, as the father became more and more addicted to drink.  Just at this time, a new lodger appeared, who was something of a  musician, and arranged to teach the boy in part payment for his room.  Ludwig wondered if he would turn out to be a more severe taskmaster  than his father had been. The times and seasons when his instruction  was given were at least unusual. Tobias Pfeiffer, as the new lodger  was called, soon discovered that father Beethoven generally spent his  evenings at the tavern. As an act of kindness, to keep his drunken  landlord out of the way of the police, Tobias used to go to the tavern  late at night and bring him safely home. Then he would go to the  bedside of the sleeping boy, and awake him by telling him it was time  for practice. The two would go to the living room, where they would  play together for several hours, improvising on original themes and  playing duets. This went on for about a year; meanwhile Ludwig studied  Latin, French, Italian and logic. He also had organ lessons.    Things were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13300"],[0,"The Doctrine and Practice of Yoga (#13)"],[1,"at the lower end of your being, but  should be transmuted into creative activity mentally and spiritually. Get  a clean body, first. You can get it by fasting, breathing and exercise.    FASTING AND SELF-CONTROL.    If you feel heavy in body and brain, if you feel mentally sluggish it  is a sure indication that your system is \"clogged\" with waste matter, due  to partial or total inactivity of the physical channels of elimination.  You have been indulging in high living and gluttony or you have been  indulging in physical gratifications and have thus exhausted the vital  fibres of your body. Perhaps you have drunk very little water which is  nature's demand for cleaning the vessels of the body. Perhaps you have  exercised little and thus the supply of oxygen required for burning off  carbon and energising the blood has been rather limited. Mental  depression, 'weak nerves,' melancholy, despair, fear, lack of  concentration and lots of other mental weakness are due to a clogging of  the system with accumulated refuse. In brief, the following are a few of  the benefits derivable from scientific fasting:--(1) It gives nature a  chance to \"Clean Up.\" The day of fasting is a day of physical \"house  cleaning.\" (2) Like the galvanic battery the body \"recuperates\" its  energies. Strength is invariably restored to one's powers of digestion  after a careful fast. No case of dyspepsia, constipation, etc., there is,  but can benefit or be totally and radically cured by fasting. Fasting  will increase powers of assimilation, quicken hunger, purify and  strengthen the nerves and raise your health in all ways. (3) By gaining  control over appetite you gain control over your lower nature. It is a  splendid drill for your Will. You shall gain in spiritual strength. You  shall grow positive to your flesh and its cravings. Jesus Christ fasted  for 40 days in order to prepare himself to face his great trial and  temptation. Our Yogis are all great fasters.    HOW TO FAST.    Don't undertake too much. If you have never observed a fast begin  with a 24 hour fast. Drink at least 5, if possible, 8 tumblers of pure  water at frequent intervals slowly. Keep yourself gently active and  occupied the whole day, mentally and physically. You may feel a feeling  of faintness, all-goneness and an irresistible craving for food. These  are mischievous pranks of a cultivated and pampered and artificial  appetite. Drink water slowly but don't give your body anything else.  Always keep before yourself the distinction between the regal \"I--am--I\"  the soul and the carnal, sensating animal known as the body. The great  point of achievement during a fast lies in thinking high thoughts and  forgetting the demands of the flesh. Don't think of your fast. If you  do think say to yourself \"this is to develop my will.\" Breathe plenty of  fresh air. Exercise gently and walk. I have seen educated men afraid to  go out for a walk during a day's religious fast \"lest they should feel  hungry.\" O shame! You can't control a little hunger! You should  bathe daily thoroughly early in the morning, fast or no fast.    And don't be afraid. \"Man liveth not by bread alone but by very  word that proceeds from the mouth of God\"--said Christ. Starvation  may kill off your body but not fasting. Deny the power of all disease  and weakness over yourself. Your mind is master of your body. Assert  this mental control. Lastly, during a fast, your body is sensitive to  your suggestions. Fill your mind with incessant affirmations of courage.  Think courage, say courage, act courage. Take time by the forelock.  Force your suggestions upon body and brain right now.    HOW TO BREAK A FAST.    When breaking a fast, be sure to control re-action. Eat very lightly  and only sensible food. Now that you have a clean body, stay clean  You can train yourself to fast for 40 days at a stretch.    TRANSMUTING SEX-ENERGY.    Here is some sensible advice from a leading thinker and teacher:  To be a perfect Bramhacharin (a regenerate).    1. You must have a clean, healthy body; 2. Good breathing capacity and  some control over same; 3. A strong will such as can move body and mind;  4. Assiduous cultivation of the intellectual side; 5. Control over  emotions; 6. A fearless mind; 7. Great determination; 8. and abstemious  living and high thinking.    The Yogis possess great knowledge regarding the use and abuse of  the reproductive principle in both sexes. Some hints of this esoteric  knowledge have filtered out and have been used by Western writers on  the subject, and much good has been accomplished in this way. In this  little book we cannot do more than touch upon the subject, and omitting  all except a bare mention of theory, we will give a practical breathing  exercise whereby the student will be enabled to transmute the  re-productive energy into vitality for the entire system, instead of  dissipating and wasting it in lustful indulgence in or out of the  marriage relations. The reproductive energy is creative energy, and may  be taken up by the system and transmuted into strength and vitality, thus  serving the purpose of regeneration instead of generation. If the young  men of the Western world understood these underlying principles they  would be saved much misery and unhappiness in after years, and would be  stronger mentally, morally and physically.    This transmutation of the reproductive energy gives more vitality to  those practising it. They will be filled with great vital force, which  will radiate from them and will manifest in what has been called  \"personal magnetism.\" The energy thus transmuted may be turned into new  channels and used to great advantage. Nature has condensed one of its  most powerful manifestations of prana into productive energy, as its  purpose is to create. The greatest amount of vital force is concentrated  in the smallest area. The re-productive organism is the most powerful  storage factory in animal life, and its force can be drawn upward and  used, as well as expended in the ordinary functions of reproduction, or  wasted in vicious lust. The majority of our students know something of  the theories of regeneration, and we can do little more than to state the  above facts, without attempting to prove them.    The Yogi exercise for transmuting re-productive energy is simple. It is  coupled with rhythmic breathing, and can be easily performed. It may be  practised at any time, but is especially recommended when one feels the  instinct more strongly, at which time the re-productive energy is  manifesting and may be most easily transmuted for regenerative purpose.  The exercise is as follows:--    Keep the mind fixed on the idea of energy, and away from ordinary  sexual thoughts and imaginings. If these thoughts come into the mind  do not be discouraged, but regard them as manifestations of a force which  you intend using for the purpose of strengthening the body and mind.  Lie passively or sit erect, and fix your mind on the idea of drawing the  re-productive energy upward to the Solar Plexus, where it will be  transmuted and stored away as a reserve force of vital energy. Then  breathe rhythmically, forming the mental image of drawing up the  re-productive energy with each inhalation. With each inhalation make a  command of the Will that the energy be drawn upward from the  re-productive organisation to the Solar Plexus. If the rhythm is fairly  established and the mental image is clear, you will be conscious of the  upward passage of the energy, and will feel its stimulating effect. If  you desire an increase in mental force, you may draw it up to the brain  instead of to the Solar Plexus, by giving the mental command and holding  the mental image of the transmission to the brain.    The man or woman doing mental creative work, or bodily creative work will  be able to use this creative energy in their work by following the above  exercise, drawing up the energy with the inhalation and sending it forth  with the exhalation. In this last form of exercise only such portions as  are needed in the work will pass into the work being done, the balance  remaining stored up in the Solar Plexus.    You will understand, of course, that it is not the reproductive fluids  which are drawn up and used, but the etheric prana energy which animates  the latter, the soul of the reproductive organism, as it were. It is  usual to allow the head to bend forward easily and naturally during the  transmuting exercise.    Practise this Breathing Exercise sturdily. Be heroic. Learn to make 100  Pranayams at a sitting, but do not rush things. Deep breathing exercise,  Will-Culture, regular Meditation and a clean normal mode of living when  combined with much thinking will surely awaken your Latent Powers. Be not  worried if progress be a bit slow at first. Keep up cheerful and work  patiently. Things cannot but come your way if you don't give up but  preserve to the last. Have infinite and unbounded faith in yourself. And,  lastly, if you want to grow space in Wisdom and Power, persevere in deep  breathing. Pranayam is the key to all spiritual success. \"Spirituality is  fullness of Breath.\" Almost all forms or Mental and physical weakness are  due to imperfect and shallow breathing. Of all these instructions you  practise nothing but the Breathing Exercise, your gain shall be great but  in order to get all the results you must practise all the instructions  regularly and methodically.    Your sex-force is under the direction of your sub-conscious mind which is  quite amenable to your authoritative suggestions. Get control through  your sub-consciousness. All you have to do is to let it to do its own  work without adverse and negative suggestions and fear-thoughts. Say \"No\"  vigorously to all adverse thoughts and shake them off from you. All  health comes by letting nature alone.    BREATHING EXERCISE.    Find a quiet place as far as possible, where the air is pure and the"]]]
