No  man has been my friend, for I've spent my time fighting them and  breaking them. And I've despised women too much to love them.\"    The tears rose to her eyes as she spoke: \"I pity you from the bottom of  my soul!\"    \"Pity? Me? By God, Kate, you'll teach me to hate you!\"    \"I can't help it. Why, if you have never loved, you have never lived!\"    \"You talk like a girl in a Sunday school! Ha, have I never lived? Men  were made strong so that a stronger man should be their master; and  women--\"    \"And women, Angus?\"    \"All women are fools; one woman is divine!\"    The yearning of his eyes gave a bitter meaning to his words, and she  was shaken like a leaf blown here and there by contrary winds.  Unheeded, the sudden tropic night swooped upon them like the shadow of  a giant bird, and as the dark increased, they saw the glimmering of the  fire upon the hill. She rose, and he followed her until they reached  the upward slope.    Then he said: \"You will want to be alone with him for a time. Can you  find the rest of the way?\"    \"Yes. You'll come soon?\"    \"I'll come soon, but I have to be by myself for a while. I may hate you  for it afterward, but now I'm weak and soft inside--like a child--and I  only wish for your happiness.\"    \"God bless you, Angus!\"    \"God help me,\" he answered harshly, and stepped into the blank night of  the shadow of the trees.    Harrigan shook his head in wonder when he saw her coming alone. He had  built up the fire and heaped fresh fuel in towering piles nearby. The  flames shot up twenty and thirty feet, making a wide signal across the  sea.    \"He's gone off by himself again?\" questioned the Irishman.    She complained: \"I can't understand him. Will he be always like this?  What shall I do, Dan?\"    He met her appeal with a smile, but the blue eyes went cold at once and  he sighed. It would never do to have the two sitting silent beside that  fire. The brooding of McTee would excite no suspicions in the mind of  Harrigan, but the quiet of the Irishman would be sure to excite the  suspicions of the other.    \"Will you do something for me, Dan?\"    He looked up with a whimsical yearning.    \"Teach McTee manners? Aye, with all me heart!\"    She laughed: \"No; but cheer him up. You said that if you were in his  place, you'd be singing all the time.\"    \"And I would.\"    \"Then sing for me--for Angus and me--tonight when we're sitting by the  fire. He's fallen into a brooding melancholy, and I can't altogether  trust him. Can you understand?\"    \"And I'm to do the cheering up?\"    \"You won't fail me?\"    He turned and occupied himself for a moment by hurling great armfuls of  wood upon the fire. The flames burst up with showering sparks, roaring  and leaping. Then, as if inspired by the sight, he came to her with his  head tilting back in the way he had.    \"I'll do it--I'll sing my heart out for you.\"    As McTee came up, the three sat down; a strange group, for the two men  stared fixedly before them at the fire, conscientiously avoiding any  movement of the eyes toward Kate and the other; and she sat between  them, watching each of them covertly and humming all the while as if  from happiness. Each of them thought the humming a love song meant for  the ears of the other. Finally McTee turned and stared curiously, first  at Kate and then at Harrigan. Manifestly he could not understand either  their silence or their aloofness. It was for the Scotchman that she  would have to play her role; Harrigan was blind. The Irishman also, as  if he felt the eyes of McTee, turned his head. Kate nodded  significantly and moved closer to him.    Obedient to his promise, he turned away again and raised his head to  sing. Alternate light and shadow swept across his face and made fire  and dark in his hair as the wind tossed the flame back and forth. At  the other side of her McTee rested upon one elbow. Whenever she turned  her head, she caught the steel-cold glitter of his eyes.    The first note from Harrigan's lips was low and faltering and off key;  she trembled lest McTee should understand, but the Scotchman attributed  the emotion to another cause. As his singing continued, moreover, it  increased in power and steadiness. One thing, however, she had not  counted on, and that was the emotion of Harrigan. Every one of his  songs carried on the theme of love in a greater or less degree, and now  his own singing swept him beyond the bounds of caution; he turned  directly to Kate and sang for her alone \"Kathleen Mavourneen.\" There  was love and farewell at once in his singing, there was yearning and  despair.    She knew that a crisis had come, and that McTee was pressed to the  limits of his endurance. The game had gone too far, and yet she dared  not appear indifferent to the singing. That would have been too direct  a betrayal, so she sat with her head back and a smile on her lips.    There was a groan and a stifled curse. McTee rose; the song died in the  throat of Harrigan.          CHAPTER 15      \"Is this what you feared?\" said the Scotchman. \"Is this what you wanted  protection against? No; you're in league together to torture me, and  all this time you've been laughing up your sleeves at my expense!\"    \"At your expense?\" growled Harrigan, rising in turn. \"Is it at your  expense that I've been sittin' here breakin' me heart with singin' love  tunes for you an' the girl?\"    She sprang up in an agony of fear.    \"Go! Go!\" she begged of McTee. \"If you doubt me, go, and when you come  back calm, I will explain.\"    He brushed her to one side and made a step toward Harrigan.    \"Love songs for _me?_\" he repeated incredulously.    \"Aye, love songs for you. Ye black swine, ye could not be happy till I  was brought in to be the piper while you an' Kate danced!\"    \"While I and Kate danced?\" thundered McTee. \"My God, man--\"    He broke off short, and a cruel light of understanding was in his eyes.    \"Harrigan,\" he said quietly, \"did Kate tell you she loved me?\"    \"Ye fool! Why else am I sittin' here singin' for your sake? Would I not  rather be amusin' myself by takin' the hollow of your throat under my  thumbs--so?\"    McTee laughed softly, and Kate could not meet his eye.    \"Well?\" he said.    \"Yes, I lied to you.\"    She turned to Harrigan: \"And to you. Don't you see? I found you on the  verge of a fight, and I knew that in it you would both be killed. What  else could I do? I hoped that for my sake you would spare each other.  Was it wrong of me, Dan? Angus, will you forgive me?\"    Harrigan raised his arms high above his head and stretched like one  from whose wrists the manacles have been unlocked after a long  imprisonment.    \"McTee, are ye ready? There's a weight gone off my  soul!\"    \"Harrigan, I've been a driver of men, but this girl has put me under  the whip. When I'm through with you, I'm coming back to her.\"    \"It'll be your ghost that returns.\"    Kate hesitated one instant as if to judge which was the greatest force  toward evil. Then she dropped to her knees and caught the hands of  McTee, those strong, cruel hands.    \"If you will not fight, I'll--I'll be kind to you, I'll be everything  you ask of me--\"    \"You're pleading for him?\"    \"No, no! For him and for you; for your two souls!\"    \"Bah! Mine was lost long ago, and I'll answer that there's a claim on  Harrigan filed away in hell. He's too strong to have lived clean.\"    \"Angus, we're all alone here--on the rim of the world, you've said--and  in places like this the eye of God is on you.\"    He laughed brutally: \"If He sees me, He'll look the other way.\"    \"Have done with the chatter,\" broke in Harrigan. \"Ah-h, McTee, I see  where my hands'll fit on your throat.\"    \"Come,\" McTee answered without raising his voice; \"there's a corner of  the beach where a current stands in close by the shore. You've been a  traveling man, Harrigan. When I've killed you, I'll throw your body  into the sea, and the tide will take you out to see the rest of the  world.\"    \"Come,\" said Harrigan; \"I'd as soon finish you there as here, and when  you're dead, I'll sit you up against a tree and come down every day to  watch you rot.\"    The girl fell to the ground between them with her face buried in her  arms, silent. The two men lowered their eyes for a moment upon her, and  then turned and walked down the hill, going shoulder to shoulder like  friends. So they came out upon the beach and walked along it until they  reached the point of which McTee had spoken.    It was a level, hard-packed stretch of sand which offered firm footing  and no rocks over which one of the fighters might stumble at a critical  moment.    \"Tis a lovely spot,\" sighed Harrigan. \"Captain, you're a jewel of a man  to have thought of it.\"    \"Aye, this is no deck at sea that can heave and twist and spoil my  work.\"    \"It is not; and the palms of my hands are almost healed. Had you  thought of that, captain?\"    \"As you lie choking, Harrigan, think of the girl. The minute I've  heaved you into the sea, I go back to her.\"    The hard breathing of the Irishman filled up the interval.    \"I see one thing clear. It's that I'll have to kill you slow. A man  like you, McTee, ought to taste his death a while before it comes. Come  to me ar-rms, captain, I've a little secret to whisper in your ear.  Whisht! 'Twill not be long in the tellin'!\"    McTee replied with a snarl, and the two commenced to circle slowly,  drawing nearer at every step. On the very edge of leaping forward,  Harrigan was astonished to see McTee straighten from his crouch and  point out to sea.    \"The eye of God!\" muttered the Scotchman. \"She was right!\"    Harrigan jumped back lest this should prove a maneuver to place him off  his guard, and then looked in the indicated direction. It was true; a  point of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#12)"],[1,"the conditions of the main body of the  Jewish people. The fortunate find, a few years back, of a hoard of  Aramaic papyri at Elephantine has given us an unexpected acquaintance  with the conditions of the Jewish colony in Upper Egypt during the fifth  and fourth centuries, and furnished a new chapter in the history of the  Diaspora. But this is an archeological substitute for literary history.    The conquest of the East by Alexander the Great and the consequent  interchange of Hellenic and Oriental culture gave a great impulse to  historical writing among all peoples. Moved by a cosmopolitan  enthusiasm, each nation was anxious to make its past known to the  others, to assert its antiquity, and to prove that, if its present was  not very glorious, it had at one time played a brilliant part in  civilization. The Greek people, too, with their intense love of  knowledge, were eager to learn the ideas and experiences of the various  nations and races who had now come into their ken.    Hence, on the one hand, there appeared works on universal history by  Greek polymaths, such as Hecataeus of Abdera, Theophrastus, the pupil of  Aristotle, and Ptolemy, the comrade of Alexander; and, on the other  hand, a number of national histories were written, also in Greek, but by  Hellenized natives, such as the Chaldaica of Berosus, the Aegyptiaca of  Manetho, and the Phoenician chronicles of Dius and Menander. The people  of Israel figured incidentally in several of these works, and Manetho  went out of his way to include in the history of his country a lying  account of the Exodus, which was designed to hold up the ancestors of  the Jews to opprobrium. From the Hellenic and philosophical writers they  received more justice. Their remarkable loyalty to their religion and  their exalted conception of the Deity moved partly the admiration,  partly the amazement of these early encyclopedists, who regarded them as  a philosophical people devoted to a higher life. The Hellenistic Jews  were led later by the sympathetic attitude of Hecataeus to add to his  history spurious chapters, in which he was made to deal more  eulogistically with their beliefs and history, and they circulated  oracles and poems in the names of fabled seers of prehistoric  times--Orpheus and the Sibyl--which conveyed some of the religious and  moral teachings of Judaism. Nor were they slow to adapt their own  chronicles for the Greek world or to take their part in the literary  movement of the time. In Palestine, indeed, the Jews remained devoted to  religious thought, and never made history a serious interest. But in  Alexandria, after translating the Scriptures into Greek in the middle of  the third century, they began, in imitation of their neighbors, to  embellish their antiquities in the Greek style, and present them more  thoroughly according to Greek standards of history.    A collection of extracts from the works of the Hellenistic Jews was made  by a Gentile compiler of the first century B.C.E., Alexander, surnamed  Polyhistor. Though his book has perished, portions of it with fragments  of these extracts have been preserved in the chronicles of the  ecclesiastical historian Eusebius, who wrote in the fourth century C.E.  They prove the existence of a very considerable array of historical  writers, who would seem to have been poor scholars of Greek, but  ingenious chronologists and apologists. The earliest of the adapters, of  whose work fragments have been thus preserved to us, is one Demetrius,  who, in the reign of Ptolemy II, at the end of the third century B.C.E.,  wrote a book on the Jewish kings. It was rather a chronology than a  connected narrative, and Demetrius amended the dates given in the Bible  according to a system of his own. This does not appear to have been very  exact, but such as it was it appealed to Josephus, who in places follows  it without question. Chronology was a matter of deep import in that  epoch, because it was one of the most galling and frequent charges  against the Jews that their boasted antiquity was fictitious. To rebut  this attack, the Jewish chroniclers elaborated the chronological  indications of their long history, and brought them into relation with  the annals of their neighbors.    Demetrius is followed by Eupolemus and Artapanus, who treated the Bible  in a different fashion. They freely handled the Scripture narrative, and  methodically embellished it with fictitious additions, for the greater  glory, as they intended, of their people. They imitated the ways of  their opponents, and as these sought to decry their ancestors by  malicious invention, so they contrived to invest them with fictitious  greatness. Eupolemus represents Abraham as the discoverer of Chaldean  astrology, and identifies Enoch with the Greek hero Atlas, to whom the  angel of God revealed the celestial lore. Elsewhere he inserts into the  paraphrase of the Book of Kings a correspondence between Solomon and  Hiram (king of Tyre), in order to show the Jewish hegemony over the  Phoenicians. Artapanus, professing to be a pagan writer, shows how the  Egyptians were indebted to the founders of Israel for their scientific  knowledge and their most prized institutions: Abraham instructed King  Pharethothis in astrology; Joseph taught the Egyptian priests  hieroglyphics, and built the Pyramids; Moses (who is identified with the  Greek seer Musaeus) not only conquered the Ethiopians, and invented  ship-building and philosophy, but taught the Egyptian priests their  deeper wisdom, and was called by them Hermes, because of his skill in  interpreting ([Greek: Hermaeneia]) the holy documents. Fiction fostered  fiction, and the inventions of pagan foes stimulated the exaggerations  of Jewish apologists. The fictitious was mixed with the true, and the  legendary material which Artapanus added to his history passed into the  common stock of Jewish apologetics.    The great national revival that followed on the Maccabean victories  induced both within and without Palestine the composition of works of  contemporary national history. For a period the Jews were as proud of  their present as of their past. It was not only that their princes, like  the kings of other countries, desired to have their great deeds  celebrated, but the whole people was conscious of another God-sent  deliverance and of a clear manifestation of the Divine Power in their  affairs, which must be recorded for the benefit of posterity. The First  Book of the Maccabees, which was originally written in Hebrew, and the  Chronicles of King John Hyrcanus[1] bear witness to this outburst of  patriotic self-consciousness in Palestine; and the Talmud[2] contains a  few fragments of history about the reign of Alexander Jannaeus, which  may have formed part of a larger chronicle. The story of the Maccabean  wars was recorded also at great length by a Hellenistic Jew, Jason of  Cyrene, and it is generally assumed that an abridgment of it has come  down to us in the Second Book of the Maccabees.    [Footnote 1: They are referred to at the end of the book. Comp. I Macc.  xvi. 23f.]    [Footnote 2: Kiddushin, 66a.]    In Palestine, however, the historical spirit did not flourish for long.  The interest in the universal lesson prevailed over that in the  particular fact, and the tradition that was treasured was not of  political events but of ethical and legal teachings. Moral rather than  objective truth was the study of the schools, and when contemporary  events are described, it is in a poetical, rhapsodical form, such as we  find in the Psalms of Solomon, which recount Pompey's invasion of  Jerusalem.[1] The only historical records that appear to have been  regularly kept are the lists of the priests and their genealogy, and a  calendar of fasts and of days on which fasting was prohibited because of  some happy event to be commemorated.    [Footnote 1: See above, p. 14.]    In the Diaspora, on the other hand, and especially at Alexandria, which  was the center of Hellenistic Jewry, history was made to serve a  practical purpose. It was a weapon in the struggle the Jews were  continually waging against their detractors, as well as in their  missionary efforts to spread their religion. It became consciously and  essentially apologetic, the end being persuasion rather than truth. Fact  and fiction were inextricably combined, and the difference between them  neglected.    The story of the translation of the Septuagint by the Jewish sages sent  to Alexandria at the invitation of King Ptolemy, which is recounted in  the Letter of Aristeas, is an excellent example of this kind of history.  It is decked out with digressions about the topography of Jerusalem and  the architecture of the Temple, and an imaginative display of Jewish wit  and wisdom at a royal symposium. The Third Book of the Maccabees, which  professes to describe a persecution of the Jews in Egypt under one of  the Ptolemies, is another early example of didactic fiction that has  been preserved to us. The one sober historical work produced by a Jewish  writer between the composition of the two Books of the Maccabees and of  the _Wars_ of Josephus was the account given by Philo of Alexandria of  the Jewish persecutions that took place in the reigns of Tiberius and  Gaius. It was originally contained in five books, of which only the  second and third have been preserved. They deal respectively with the  riots at Alexandria that took place when Flaccus was governor, and with  the Jewish embassy to Gaius when that Emperor issued his order that his  image should be set up in the Temple at Jerusalem and in the great  synagogue of Alexandria. Philo wrote a full account of the events in  which he himself had been called upon to play a part. He is always at  pains to point the moral and enforce the lesson, but his work has a  definite historical value, and contains many valuable details about  Jewish life in the Diaspora.    But if the "]]]
