Thus arose  his _Divan_ (1819), in which he imitated the oriental costume, but not  the form. His aim was to reproduce in German verse the peculiar savor  of the Orientals, with their unique blend of sensuality, wit, and  mystic philosophy. But the feeling--the inner experience--was all his  own. The best book of the _Divan_, the one called _Suleika_, was  inspired by a very real liking for Marianne Willemer, a talented lady  who played the love-game with him and actually wrote some of the poems  long ascribed to Goethe himself.    At last, in 1824, when he was seventy-five years old, he came back  once more to his _Faust_, the completion of which had long floated  before his mind as a duty that he owed to himself and to the world.  There was no longer any doubt as to what his great life-work was to  be. With admirable energy and with perfect clarity of vision he  addressed himself to the gigantic task, the general plan of which and  many of the details had been thought out long before. It was finished  in the summer of 1831. About sixty years after he had penned the first  words of Faust, the disgruntled pessimist at war with life, he took  leave of him as a purified soul mounting upward among the saints  toward the Ineffable Light, under the mystic guidance of the  Eternal-Womanly.    Goethe died March 18, 1832. The story that his last words were \"more  light\" is probably nothing more than a happy invention.    Admirers of the great German see more in him than the author of the  various works which have been all too briefly characterized in the  preceding sketch. His is a case where, in very truth, the whole is  more than the sum of the parts. Goethe is the representative of an  epoch. He stands for certain ideals which are not those of the present  hour, but which it was of inestimable value to the modern man to have  thus nobly worked out and exemplified in practice. Behind and beneath  his writings, informing them and giving them their value for  posterity, is a wonderful personality which it is a delight and an  education to study in the whole process of its evolution. By way of  struggle, pain and error, like his own Faust, he arrived at a view of  life, in which he found inspiration and inner peace. It is outlined in  the verses which he placed before his short poems as a sort of motto:      Wide horizon, eager life,    Busy years of honest strife,    Ever seeking, ever founding,    Never ending, ever rounding,    Guarding tenderly the old,    Taking of the new glad hold,    Pure in purpose, light of heart,    Thus we gain--at least a start.    [Illustration:  THE DEATH OF GOETHE Fritz Fleischer]        POEMS    GREETING AND DEPARTURE[4] (1771)      My heart throbbed high: to horse, away then!      Swift as a hero to the fight!    Earth in the arms of evening lay then,      And o'er the mountains hung the night,    Now could I see like some huge giant      The haze-enveloped oak-tree rise,    While from the thicket stared defiant      The darkness with its hundred eyes.      The cloud-throned moon from his dominion      Peered drowsily through veils of mist.    The wind with gently-wafting pinion      Gave forth a rustling strange and whist.    With shapes of fear the night was thronging      But all the more my courage glowed;    My soul flamed up in passionate longing      And hot my heart with rapture flowed.      I saw thee; melting rays of pleasure      Streamed o'er me from thy tender glance,    My heart beat only to thy measure,      I drew my breath as in a trance.    The radiant hue of spring caressing      Lay rosy on thy upturned face,    And love--ye gods, how rich the blessing!      I dared not hope to win such grace.      To part--alas what grief in this is!--      In every look thy heart spoke plain.    What ecstasy was in thy kisses!      What changing thrill of joy and pain!      I went. One solace yet to capture,      Thine eyes pursued in sweet distress.    But to be loved, what holy rapture!      To love, ah gods, what happiness!    [Illustration: THE HEATHROSE K. Kogler]      THE HEATHROSE[5] (1771)      Once a boy a Rosebud spied,      Heathrose fair and tender,    All array'd in youthful pride,--    Quickly to the spot he hied,      Ravished by her splendor.    Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,      Heathrose fair and tender!    Said the boy, \"I'll now pick thee      Heathrose fair and tender!\"    Rosebud cried \"And I'll prick thee,    So thou shalt remember me,      Ne'er will I surrender!\"    Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,      Heathrose fair and tender!    But the wanton plucked the rose,      Heathrose fair and tender;    Thorns the cruel theft oppose,    Brief the struggle and vain the woes,      She must needs surrender.    Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,      Heathrose fair and tender!      MAHOMET'S SONG[6] (1773)    [This song was intended to be introduced in a dramatic poem entitled  _Mahomet_, the plan of which was not carried out by Goethe. He  mentions that it was to have been sung by Ali toward the end of the  piece, in honor of his master, Mahomet, shortly before his death, and  when at the height of his glory, of which it is typical.]      See the rock-born stream!    Like the gleam    Of a star so bright!    Kindly spirits    High above the clouds    Nourished him while youthful    In the copse between the cliffs.      Young and fresh,    From the clouds he danceth    Down upon the marble rocks;    Then tow'rd heaven    Leaps exulting.      Through the mountain-passes    Chaseth he the color'd pebbles,    And, advancing like a chief,    Draws his brother streamlets with him    In his course.      In the vale below    'Neath his footsteps spring the flowers,    And the meadow    In his breath finds life.      Yet no shady vale can stay him,    Nor can flowers,    Round his knees all softly twining    With their loving eyes detain him;    To the plain his course he taketh,    Serpent-winding.      Eager streamlets    Join his waters. And now moves he    O'er the plain in silv'ry glory,    And the plain in him exults,    And the rivers from the plain,    And the streamlets from the mountain,    Shout with joy, exclaiming: \"Brother,    Brother, take thy brethren with thee.    With thee to thine aged father,    To the everlasting ocean,    Who, with arms outstretching far,    Waiteth for us;    Ah, in vain those arms lie open    To embrace his yearning children;    For the thirsty sand consumes us    In the desert waste; the sunbeams    Drink our life-blood; hills around us    Into lakes would dam us! Brother,    Take thy brethren of the plain,    Take thy brethren of the mountain    With thee, to thy father's arms!\"--      Let all come, then!--    And now swells he    Lordlier still; yea, e'en a people    Bears his regal flood on high!    And in triumph onward rolling,    Names to countries gives he,--cities    Spring to light beneath his foot.      Ever, ever, on he rushes,    Leaves the towers' flame-tipp'd summits,    Marble palaces, the offspring    Of his fulness, far behind.      Cedar-houses bears the Atlas    On his giant shoulders; flutt'ring    In the breeze far, far above him    Thousand flags are gaily floating,    Bearing witness to his might.      And so beareth he his brethren,    All his treasures, all his children,    Wildly shouting, to the bosom    Of his long-expectant sire.      PROMETHEUS[7] (1774)      Cover thy spacious heavens, Zeus,    With clouds of mist,    And, like the boy who lops    The thistles' heads,    Disport with oaks and mountain-peaks;    Yet thou must leave      My earth still standing;    My cottage too, which was not raised by thee,    Leave me my hearth,    Whose kindly glow    By thee is envied.      I know nought poorer    Under the sun, than ye gods!    Ye nourish painfully,    With sacrifices    And votive prayers,    Your majesty;    Ye would e'en starve,    If children and beggars    Were not trusting fools.    While yet a child,    And ignorant of life,    I turned my wandering gaze    Up tow'rd the sun, as if with him    There were an ear to hear my wailing,    A heart, like mine    To feel compassion for distress.      Who help'd me    Against the Titans' insolence?    Who rescued me from certain death,    From slavery?    Didst thou not do all this thyself,    My sacred glowing heart?    And glowedst, young and good,    Deceived with grateful thanks    To yonder slumbering one?      I honor thee! and why?    Hast thou e'er lighten'd the sorrows    Of the heavy laden?    Hast thou e'er dried up the tears    [Illustration: PROMETHEUS Titian.]      Of the anguish-stricken?    Was I not fashion'd to be a man    By omnipotent Time,    And by eternal Fate,    Masters of me and thee?      Didst thou e'er fancy    That life I should learn to hate,    And fly to deserts,    Because not all    My blossoming dreams grew ripe?      Here sit I, forming mortals    After my image;    A race resembling me,    To suffer, to weep,    To enjoy, to be glad,    And thee to scorn,    As I!      THE WANDERER'S NIGHT-SONG[8] (1776)      Thou who comest from on high,      Who all woes and sorrows stillest,    Who, for two-fold misery,      Hearts with twofold balsam fillest,    Would this constant strife would cease!      What avails the joy and pain?    Blissful Peace,      To my bosom come again!      THE SEA-VOYAGE[9] (1776)      Many a day and night my bark stood ready laden;    Waiting fav'ring winds, I sat with true friends round me,    Pledging me to patience and to courage,    In the haven.      And they spoke thus with impatience twofold:    \"Gladly pray we for thy rapid passage,    Gladly for thy happy voyage; fortune    In the distant world is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11128"],[0,"The Red Thumb Mark (#13)"],[1,"in every respect.    \"And you are of opinion that the mark on the paper that was found in Mr.  Hornby's safe, was made by the prisoner's left thumb?\" the magistrate  asked in dry and business-like tones.    \"I am certain of it.\"    \"You are of opinion that no mistake is possible?\"    \"No mistake is possible, your worship. It is a certainty.\"    The magistrate looked at Anstey inquiringly, whereupon the barrister  rose.  \"We reserve our defence, your worship.\"    The magistrate then, in the same placid, business-like manner, committed  the prisoner for trial at the Central Criminal Court, refusing to accept  bail for his appearance, and, as Reuben was led forth from the dock, the  next case was called.    By special favour of the authorities, Reuben was to be allowed to make  his journey to Holloway in a cab, thus escaping the horrors of the  filthy and verminous prison van, and while this was being procured, his  friends were permitted to wish him farewell.    \"This is a hard experience, Hornby,\" said Thorndyke, when we three were,  for a few moments, left apart from the others; and as he spoke the  warmth of a really sympathetic nature broke through his habitual  impassivity. \"But be of good cheer; I have convinced myself of your  innocence and have good hopes of convincing the world--though this is  for your private ear, you understand, to be mentioned to no one.\"    Reuben wrung the hand of this \"friend in need,\" but was unable, for the  moment, to speak; and, as his self-control was evidently strained to the  breaking point, Thorndyke, with a man's natural instinct, wished him a  hasty good-bye, and passing his hand through my arm, turned away.    \"I wish it had been possible to save the poor fellow from this delay,  and especially from the degradation of being locked up in a jail,\" he  exclaimed regretfully as we walked down the street.    \"There is surely no degradation in being merely accused of a crime,\" I  answered, without much conviction, however. \"It may happen to the best  of us; and he is still an innocent man in the eyes of the law.\"    \"That, my dear Jervis, you know, as well as I do, to be mere casuistry,\"  he rejoined. \"The law professes to regard the unconvicted man as  innocent; but how does it treat him? You heard how the magistrate  addressed our friend; outside the court he would have called him _Mr_.  Hornby. You know what will happen to Reuben at Holloway. He will be  ordered about by warders, will have a number label fastened on to his  coat, he will be locked in a cell with a spy-hole in the door, through  which any passing stranger may watch him; his food will be handed to him  in a tin pan with a tin knife and spoon; and he will be periodically  called out of his cell and driven round the exercise yard with a mob  composed, for the most part, of the sweepings of the London slums. If he  is acquitted, he will be turned loose without a suggestion of  compensation or apology for these indignities or the losses he may have  sustained through his detention.\"    \"Still I suppose these evils are unavoidable,\" I said.    \"That may or may not be,\" he retorted. \"My point is that the presumption  of innocence is a pure fiction; that the treatment of an accused man,  from the moment of his arrest, is that of a criminal. However,\" he  concluded, hailing a passing hansom, \"this discussion must be adjourned  or I shall be late at the hospital. What are you going to do?\"    \"I shall get some lunch and then call on Miss Gibson to let her know the  real position.\"    \"Yes, that will be kind, I think; baldly stated, the news may seem  rather alarming. I was tempted to thrash the case out in the police  court, but it would not have been safe. He would almost certainly have  been committed for trial after all, and then we should have shown our  hand to the prosecution.\"    He sprang into the hansom and was speedily swallowed up in the traffic,  while I turned back towards the police court to make certain inquiries  concerning the regulations as to visitors at Holloway prison. At the  door I met the friendly inspector from Scotland Yard, who gave me the  necessary information, whereupon with a certain homely little French  restaurant in my mind I bent my steps in the direction of Soho.          CHAPTER VII    SHOALS AND QUICKSANDS      When I arrived at Endsley Gardens, Miss Gibson was at home, and to my  unspeakable relief, Mrs. Hornby was not. My veneration for that lady's  moral qualities was excessive, but her conversation drove me to the  verge of insanity--an insanity not entirely free from homicidal  tendencies.    \"It is good of you to come--though I thought you would,\" Miss Gibson  said impulsively, as we shook hands. \"You have been so sympathetic and  human--both you and Dr. Thorndyke--so free from professional stiffness.  My aunt went off to see Mr. Lawley directly we got Walter's telegram.\"    \"I am sorry for her,\" I said (and was on the point of adding \"and him,\"  but fortunately a glimmer of sense restrained me); \"she will find him  dry enough.\"    \"Yes; I dislike him extremely. Do you know that he had the impudence to  advise Reuben to plead 'guilty'?\"    \"He told us he had done so, and got a well-deserved snubbing from  Thorndyke for his pains.\"    \"I am so glad,\" exclaimed Miss Gibson viciously. \"But tell me what has  happened. Walter simply said 'Transferred to higher court,' which we  agreed was to mean, 'Committed for trial.' Has the defence failed? And  where is Reuben?\"    \"The defence is reserved. Dr. Thorndyke considered it almost certain  that the case would be sent for trial, and that being so, decided that  it was essential to keep the prosecution in the dark as to the line of  defence. You see, if the police knew what the defence was to be they  could revise their own plans accordingly.\"    \"I see that,\" said she dejectedly, \"but I am dreadfully disappointed. I  had hoped that Dr. Thorndyke would get the case dismissed. What has  happened to Reuben?\"    This was the question that I had dreaded, and now that I had to answer  it I cleared my throat and bent my gaze nervously on the floor.    \"The magistrate refused bail,\" I said after an uncomfortable pause.    \"Well?\"    \"Consequently Reuben has been--er--detained in custody.\"    \"You don't mean to say that they have sent him to prison?\" she exclaimed  breathlessly.    \"Not as a convicted prisoner, you know. He is merely detained pending  his trial.\"    \"But in prison?\"    \"Yes,\" I was forced to admit; \"in Holloway prison.\"    She looked me stonily in the face for some seconds, pale and wide-eyed,  but silent; then, with a sudden catch in her breath, she turned away,  and, grasping the edge of the mantel-shelf, laid her head upon her arm  and burst into a passion of sobbing.    Now I am not, in general, an emotional man, nor even especially  impulsive; but neither am I a stock or a stone or an effigy of wood;  which I most surely must have been if I could have looked without being  deeply moved on the grief, so natural and unselfish, of this strong,  brave, loyal-hearted woman. In effect, I moved to her side and, gently  taking in mine the hand that hung down, murmured some incoherent words  of consolation in a particularly husky voice.    Presently she recovered herself somewhat and softly withdrew her hand,  as she turned towards me drying her eyes.    \"You must forgive me for distressing you, as I fear I have,\" she said;  \"for you are so kind, and I feel that you are really my friend and  Reuben's.\"    \"I am indeed, dear Miss Gibson,\" I replied, \"and so, I assure you, is my  colleague.\"    \"I am sure of it,\" she rejoined. \"But I was so unprepared for this--I  cannot say why, excepting that I trusted so entirely in Dr.  Thorndyke--and it is so horrible and, above all, so dreadfully  suggestive of what may happen. Up to now the whole thing has seemed like  a nightmare--terrifying, but yet unreal. But now that he is actually in  prison, it has suddenly become a dreadful reality and I am overwhelmed  with terror. Oh! poor boy! What will become of him? For pity's sake, Dr.  Jervis, tell me what is going to happen.\"    What could I do? I had heard Thorndyke's words of encouragement to  Reuben and knew my colleague well enough to feel sure that he meant all  he had said. Doubtless my proper course would have been to keep my own  counsel and put Miss Gibson off with cautious ambiguities. But I could  not; she was worthy of more confidence than that.    \"You must not be unduly alarmed about the future,\" I said. \"I have it  from Dr. Thorndyke that he is convinced of Reuben's innocence, and is  hopeful of being able to make it clear to the world. But I did not have  this to repeat,\" I added, with a slight qualm of conscience.    \"I know,\" she said softly, \"and I thank you from my heart.\"    \"And as to this present misfortune,\" I continued, \"you must not let it  distress you too much. Try to think of it as of a surgical operation,  which is a dreadful thing in itself, but is accepted in lieu of  something which is immeasurably more dreadful.\"    \"I will try to do as you tell me,\" she answered meekly; \"but it is so  shocking to think of a cultivated gentleman like Reuben, herded with  common thieves and murderers, and locked in a cage like some wild  animal. Think of the ignominy and degradation!\"    \"There is no ignominy in being wrongfully accused,\" I said--a little  guiltily, I must own, for Thorndyke's words came back to me with all  their force. But regardless of this I went on: \"An acquittal will  restore him to his position with an unstained character, and nothing but  the recollection of a passing inconvenience to look back upon.\"    She gave her eyes a final wipe, and resolutely put away her  handkerchief.    \"You have given me back my courage,\" she said, \"and chased away my  terror. I cannot tell you how I feel your goodness, nor have I any  thank-offering to make, except the promise to be brave and patient"]]]
