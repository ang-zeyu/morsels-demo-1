But assuming that a color scale can be established which would yield  a color correlative to any musical note or chord, there still remains  the matter of _values_ to be dealt with. In the musical scale there is  a practical equality of values: one note is as potent as another. In  a color scale, on the other hand, each note (taken at its greatest  intensity) has a positive value of its own, and they are all  different. These values have no musical correlatives, they belong to  color _per se_. Every colorist knows that the whole secret of beauty  and brilliance dwells in a proper understanding and adjustment of  values, and music is powerless to help him here. Let us therefore  defer the discussion of this musical parallel, which is full of  pitfalls, until we have made some examination into such simple  emotional reactions as color can be discovered to yield. The musical  art began from the emotional response to certain simple tones and  combinations, and the delight of the ear in their repetition and  variation.    On account of our undeveloped sensitivity, the emotional reactions  to color are found to be largely personal and whimsical: one person  \"loves\" pink, another purple, or green. Color therapeutics is too  new a thing to be relied upon for data, for even though colors  are susceptible of classification as sedative, recuperative and  stimulating, no two classifications arrived at independently would be  likely to correspond. Most people appear to prefer bright, pure  colors when presented to them in small areas, red and blue being  the favourites. Certain data have been accumulated regarding the  physiological effect and psychological value of different colors, but  this order of research is in its infancy, and we shall have recourse,  therefore, to theory, in the absence of any safer guide.    One of the theories which may be said to have justified itself in  practice in a different field is that upon which is based Delsarte's  famous art of expression. It has schooled some of the finest actors  in the world, and raised others from mediocrity to distinction. The  Delsarte system is founded upon the idea that man is a triplicity of  physical, emotional, and intellectual qualities or attributes, and  that the entire body and every part thereof conforms to, and expresses  this triplicity. The generative and digestive region corresponds with  the physical nature, the breast with the emotional, and the head  with the intellectual; \"below\" represents the nadir of ignorance and  dejection, \"above\" the zenith of wisdom and spiritual power.  This seems a natural, and not an arbitrary classification, having  interesting confirmations and correspondencies, both in the outer  world of form, and in the inner world of consciousness. Moreover, it  is in accord with that theosophic scheme derived from the ancient and  august wisdom of the East, which longer and better than any other  has withstood the obliterating action of slow time, and is even now  renascent. Let us therefore attempt to classify the colors of the  spectrum according to this theory, and discover if we can how nearly  such a classification is conformable to reason and experience.    The red end of the spectrum, being lowest in vibratory rate, would  correspond to the physical nature, proverbially more sluggish than the  emotional and mental. The phrase \"like a red rag to a bull,\" suggests  a relation between the color red and the animal consciousness  established by observation. The \"low-brow\" is the dear lover of the  red necktie; the \"high-brow\" is he who sees violet shadows on the  snow. We \"see red\" when we are dominated by ignoble passion. Though  the color green is associated with the idea of jealousy, it is  associated also with the idea of sympathy, and jealousy in the last  analysis is the fear of the loss of sympathy; it belongs, at all  events to the mediant, or emotional group of colors; while blue and  violet are proverbially intellectual and spiritual colors, and  their place in the spectrum therefore conforms to the demands of our  theoretical division. Here, then, is something reasonably certain,  certainly reasonable, and may serve as an hypothesis to be confirmed  or confuted by subsequent research. Coming now finally to the  consideration of the musical parallel, let us divide a color scale of  twelve steps or semi-tones into three groups; each group, graphically  portrayed, subtending one-third of the arc of a circle. The first or  red group will be related to the physical nature, and will consist of  purple-red, red, red-orange, and orange. The second, or green group  will be related to the emotional nature, and will consist of yellow,  yellow-green, green, and green-blue. The third, or blue group will be  related to the intellectual and spiritual nature, and will consist  of blue, blue-violet, violet and purple. The merging of purple into  purple-red will then correspond to the meeting place of the  highest with the lowest, \"spirit\" and \"matter.\" We conceive of this  meeting-place symbolically as the \"heart\"--the vital centre. Now  \"sanguine\" is the appropriate name associated with the color of  the blood--a color between purple and purple-red. It is logical,  therefore, to regard this point in our color-scale as its  tonic--\"middle C\"--though each color, just as in music each note, is  itself the tonic of a scale of its own.    Mr. Louis Wilson--the author of the above \"ophthalmic color scale\"  makes the same affiliation between sanguine, or blood color, and  middle C, led thereto by scientific reasons entirely unassociated with  symbolism. He has omitted orange-yellow and violet-purple; this  makes the scale conform more exactly with the diatonic scale of  two tetra-chords; it also gives a greater range of purples, a color  indispensable to the artist. Moreover, in the scale as it stands, each  color is exactly opposite its true spectral complementary.    The color scale being thus established and broadly divided, the next  step is to find how well it justifies itself in practice. The most  direct way would be to translate the musical chords recognized and  dealt with in the science of harmony into their corresponding color  combinations.    For the benefit of such readers as have no knowledge of musical  harmony it should be said that the entire science of harmony is based  upon the _triad_, or chord of three notes, and that there are various  kinds of triads: the major, the minor, the augmented, the diminished,  and the altered. The major triad consists of the first note of the  diatonic scale, or tonic; its third, and its fifth. The minor triad  differs from the major only in that the second member is lowered a  semi-tone. The augmented triad differs from the major only in that the  third member is raised a semi-tone. The diminished triad differs from  the minor only in that the third member is lowered a semi-tone. The  altered triad is a chord different by a semi-tone from any of the  above.    The major triad in color is formed by taking any one of the twelve  color-centers of the ophthalmic color scale as the first member of  the triad; and, reading up the scale, the fifth step (each step  representing a semi-tone) determines the second member, while the  third member is found in the eighth step. The minor triad in color is  formed by lowering the second member of the major triad one step; the  augmented triad by raising the third member of the major triad one  step, and the diminished triad by lowering the third member of the  minor triad one step.    [Illustration: Figure 18. MAJOR TRIAD, MINOR TRIAD, AUGMENTED TRIAD,  DIMINISHED TRIAD]    These various triads are shown graphically in Figure 18 as  triangles within a circle divided into twelve equal parts, each part  representing a semi-tone of the chromatic scale. It is seen at a  glance that in every case each triad has one of its notes (an apex) in  or immediately adjacent to a different one of the grand divisions of  the colour scale hereinbefore established and described, and that the  same thing would be true in any \"key\": that is, by any variation of  the point of departure.    This certainly satisfies the mind in that it suggests variety in  unity, balance, completeness, and in the actual portrayal, in color,  of these chords in any \"key\" this judgment is confirmed by the eye,  provided that the colors have been thrown into proper _harmonic  suppression_. By this is meant such an adjustment of relative values,  or such an establishment of relative proportions as will produce the  maximum of beauty of which any given combination is capable. This  matter imperatively demands an aesthetic sense the most sensitive.    So this \"musical parallel,\" interesting and reasonable as it is, will  not carry the color harmonist very far, and if followed too literally  it is even likely to hamper him in the higher reaches of his art,  for some of the musical dissonances are of great beauty in color  translation. All that can safely be said in regard to the musical  parallel in its present stage of development is that it simplifies and  systematizes color knowledge and experiment and to a beginner it is  highly educational.    If we are to have color symphonies, the best are not likely to be  those based on a literal translation of some musical masterpiece into  color according to this or any theory, but those created by persons  who are emotionally reactive to this medium, able to imagine in color,  and to treat it imaginatively. The most beautiful mobile color effects  yet witnessed by the author were produced on a field "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],[0,"Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#13)"],[1,"method alone,  but the rule has so many exceptions that we cannot safely lay it down as  a principle. Wherever we go we are impressed by the fact that pattern is  one thing, the utilization of pattern quite another. A few further  examples of the multiple expression of identical functions in other  languages than English may help to make still more vivid this idea of  the relative independence of form and function.    In Hebrew, as in other Semitic languages, the verbal idea as such is  expressed by three, less often by two or four, characteristic  consonants. Thus, the group _sh-m-r_ expresses the idea of \"guarding,\"  the group _g-n-b_ that of \"stealing,\" _n-t-n_ that of \"giving.\"  Naturally these consonantal sequences are merely abstracted from the  actual forms. The consonants are held together in different forms by  characteristic vowels that vary according to the idea that it is desired  to express. Prefixed and suffixed elements are also frequently used. The  method of internal vocalic change is exemplified in _shamar_ \"he has  guarded,\" _shomer_ \"guarding,\" _shamur_ \"being guarded,\" _shmor_ \"(to)  guard.\" Analogously, _ganab_ \"he has stolen,\" _goneb_ \"stealing,\"  _ganub_ \"being stolen,\" _gnob_ \"(to) steal.\" But not all infinitives are  formed according to the type of _shmor_ and _gnob_ or of other types of  internal vowel change. Certain verbs suffix a _t_-element for the  infinitive, e.g., _ten-eth_ \"to give,\" _heyo-th_ \"to be.\" Again, the  pronominal ideas may be expressed by independent words (e.g., _anoki_  \"I\"), by prefixed elements (e.g., _e-shmor_ \"I shall guard\"), or by  suffixed elements (e.g., _shamar-ti_ \"I have guarded\"). In Nass, an  Indian language of British Columbia, plurals are formed by four distinct  methods. Most nouns (and verbs) are reduplicated in the plural, that is,  part of the radical element is repeated, e.g., _gyat_ \"person,\"  _gyigyat_ \"people.\" A second method is the use of certain characteristic  prefixes, e.g., _an'on_ \"hand,\" _ka-an'on_ \"hands\"; _wai_ \"one paddles,\"  _lu-wai_ \"several paddle.\" Still other plurals are formed by means of  internal vowel change, e.g., _gwula_ \"cloak,\" _gwila_ \"cloaks.\" Finally,  a fourth class of plurals is constituted by such nouns as suffix a  grammatical element, e.g., _waky_ \"brother,\" _wakykw_ \"brothers.\"    From such groups of examples as these--and they might be multiplied _ad  nauseam_--we cannot but conclude that linguistic form may and should be  studied as types of patterning, apart from the associated functions. We  are the more justified in this procedure as all languages evince a  curious instinct for the development of one or more particular  grammatical processes at the expense of others, tending always to lose  sight of any explicit functional value that the process may have had in  the first instance, delighting, it would seem, in the sheer play of its  means of expression. It does not matter that in such a case as the  English _goose_--_geese_, _foul_--_defile_, _sing_--_sang_--_sung_ we  can prove that we are dealing with historically distinct processes,  that the vocalic alternation of _sing_ and _sang_, for instance, is  centuries older as a specific type of grammatical process than the  outwardly parallel one of _goose_ and _geese_. It remains true that  there is (or was) an inherent tendency in English, at the time such  forms as _geese_ came into being, for the utilization of vocalic change  as a significant linguistic method. Failing the precedent set by such  already existing types of vocalic alternation as _sing_--_sang_--_sung_,  it is highly doubtful if the detailed conditions that brought about the  evolution of forms like _teeth_ and _geese_ from _tooth_ and _goose_  would have been potent enough to allow the native linguistic feeling to  win through to an acceptance of these new types of plural formation as  psychologically possible. This feeling for form as such, freely  expanding along predetermined lines and greatly inhibited in certain  directions by the lack of controlling types of patterning, should be  more clearly understood than it seems to be. A general survey of many  diverse types of languages is needed to give us the proper perspective  on this point. We saw in the preceding chapter that every language has  an inner phonetic system of definite pattern. We now learn that it has  also a definite feeling for patterning on the level of grammatical  formation. Both of these submerged and powerfully controlling impulses  to definite form operate as such, regardless of the need for expressing  particular concepts or of giving consistent external shape to particular  groups of concepts. It goes without saying that these impulses can find  realization only in concrete functional expression. We must say  something to be able to say it in a certain manner.    Let us now take up a little more systematically, however briefly, the  various grammatical processes that linguistic research has established.  They may be grouped into six main types: word order; composition;  affixation, including the use of prefixes, suffixes, and infixes;  internal modification of the radical or grammatical element, whether  this affects a vowel or a consonant; reduplication; and accentual  differences, whether dynamic (stress) or tonal (pitch). There are also  special quantitative processes, like vocalic lengthening or shortening  and consonantal doubling, but these may be looked upon as particular  sub-types of the process of internal modification. Possibly still other  formal types exist, but they are not likely to be of importance in a  general survey. It is important to bear in mind that a linguistic  phenomenon cannot be looked upon as illustrating a definite \"process\"  unless it has an inherent functional value. The consonantal change in  English, for instance, of _book-s_ and _bag-s_ (_s_ in the former, _z_  in the latter) is of no functional significance. It is a purely  external, mechanical change induced by the presence of a preceding  voiceless consonant, _k_, in the former case, of a voiced consonant,  _g_, in the latter. This mechanical alternation is objectively the same  as that between the noun _house_ and the verb _to house_. In the latter  case, however, it has an important grammatical function, that of  transforming a noun into a verb. The two alternations belong, then, to  entirely different psychological categories. Only the latter is a true  illustration of consonantal modification as a grammatical process.    The simplest, at least the most economical, method of conveying some  sort of grammatical notion is to juxtapose two or more words in a  definite sequence without making any attempt by inherent modification of  these words to establish a connection between them. Let us put down two  simple English words at random, say _sing praise_. This conveys no  finished thought in English, nor does it clearly establish a relation  between the idea of singing and that of praising. Nevertheless, it is  psychologically impossible to hear or see the two words juxtaposed  without straining to give them some measure of coherent significance.  The attempt is not likely to yield an entirely satisfactory result, but  what is significant is that as soon as two or more radical concepts are  put before the human mind in immediate sequence it strives to bind them  together with connecting values of some sort. In the case of _sing  praise_ different individuals are likely to arrive at different  provisional results. Some of the latent possibilities of the  juxtaposition, expressed in currently satisfying form, are: _sing praise  (to him)!_ or _singing praise, praise expressed in a song_ or _to sing  and praise_ or _one who sings a song of praise_ (compare such English  compounds as _killjoy_, i.e., _one who kills joy_) or _he sings a song  of praise (to him)_. The theoretical possibilities in the way of  rounding out these two concepts into a significant group of concepts or  even into a finished thought are indefinitely numerous. None of them  will quite work in English, but there are numerous languages where one  or other of these amplifying processes is habitual. It depends entirely  on the genius of the particular language what function is inherently  involved in a given sequence of words.    Some languages, like Latin, express practically all relations by means  of modifications within the body of the word itself. In these, sequence  is apt to be a rhetorical rather than a strictly grammatical principle.  Whether I say in Latin _hominem femina videt_ or _femina hominem videt_  or _hominem videt femina_ or _videt femina hominem_ makes little or no  difference beyond, possibly, a rhetorical or stylistic one. _The woman  sees the man_ is the identical significance of each of these sentences.  In Chinook, an Indian language of the Columbia River, one can be equally  free, for the relation between the verb and the two nouns is as  inherently fixed as in Latin. The difference between the two languages  is that, while Latin allows the nouns to establish their relation to  each other and to the verb, Chinook lays the formal burden entirely on  the verb, the full content of which is more or less adequately rendered  by _she-him-sees_. Eliminate the Latin case suffixes (_-a_ and _-em_)  and the Chinook pronominal prefixes (_she-him-_) and we cannot afford to  be so indifferent to our word order. We need to husband our resources.  In other words, word order takes on a real functional value. Latin and  Chinook are at one extreme. Such languages as Chinese, Siamese, and  Annamite, in which each and every word, if it is to function properly,  falls into its assigned place, are at the other extreme. But the  majority of languages fall between these two extremes. In English, for  instance, it may make little grammatical difference whether I say  _yesterday the man saw the dog_ or _the man saw the dog yesterday_, but  it is not a"]]]
