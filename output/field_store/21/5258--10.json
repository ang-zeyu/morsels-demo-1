Selah.    19:062:005 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from             him.    19:062:006 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall             not be moved.    19:062:007 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,             and my refuge, is in God.    19:062:008 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart             before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.    19:062:009 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree             are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether             lighter than vanity.    19:062:010 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if             riches increase, set not your heart upon them.    19:062:011 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power             belongeth unto God.    19:062:012 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to             every man according to his work.    19:063:001 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul             thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and             thirsty land, where no water is;    19:063:002 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the             sanctuary.    19:063:003 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall             praise thee.    19:063:004 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands             in thy name.    19:063:005 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my             mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:    19:063:006 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the             night watches.    19:063:007 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy             wings will I rejoice.    19:063:008 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth             me.    19:063:009 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the             lower parts of the earth.    19:063:010 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for             foxes.    19:063:011 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by             him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall             be stopped.    19:064:001 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear             of the enemy.    19:064:002 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the             insurrection of the workers of iniquity:    19:064:003 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to             shoot their arrows, even bitter words:    19:064:004 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they             shoot at him, and fear not.    19:064:005 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of             laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?    19:064:006 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:             both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart,             is deep.    19:064:007 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they             be wounded.    19:064:008 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:             all that see them shall flee away.    19:064:009 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for             they shall wisely consider of his doing.    19:064:010 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in             him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.    19:065:001 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall             the vow be performed.    19:065:002 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.    19:065:003 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou             shalt purge them away.    19:065:004 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach             unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be             satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy             temple.    19:065:005 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God             of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of             the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:    19:065:006 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded             with power:    19:065:007 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their             waves, and the tumult of the people.    19:065:008 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy             tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening             to rejoice.    19:065:009 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly             enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water:             thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.    19:065:010 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the             furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou             blessest the springing thereof.    19:065:011 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop             fatness.    19:065:012 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little             hills rejoice on every side.    19:065:013 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are             covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.    19:066:001 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:    19:066:002 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.    19:066:003 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the             greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves             unto thee.    19:066:004 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee;             they shall sing to thy name. Selah.    19:066:005 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing             toward the children of men.    19:066:006 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood             on foot: there did we rejoice in him.    19:066:007 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations:             let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.    19:066:008 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise             to be heard:    19:066:009 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to             be moved.    19:066:010 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver             is tried.    19:066:011 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon             our loins.    19:066:012 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through             fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a             wealthy place.    19:066:013 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee             my vows,    19:066:014 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I             was in trouble.    19:066:015 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the             incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.    19:066:016 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what             he hath done for my soul.    19:066:017 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my             tongue.    19:066:018 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:    19:066:019 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of             my prayer.    19:066:020 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his             mercy from me.    19:067:001 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to             shine upon us; Selah.    19:067:002 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among             all nations.    19:067:003 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise             thee.    19:067:004 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt             judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon             earth. Selah.    19:067:005 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise             thee.    19:067:006 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own             God, shall bless us.    19:067:007 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear             him.    19:068:001 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also             that hate him flee before him.    19:068:002 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth             before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of             God.    19:068:003 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God:             yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.    19:068:004 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth             upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.    19:068:005 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God             in his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],[0,"The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#12)"],[1,"is half    eatenwhich is a consideration of the most serious importance.

I endeavoured to    persuade Ernest Dummkopf, our manager, to lend us the classical    dresses for our marriage.  Think of the effect of a real Athenian    wedding procession cavorting through the streets of Speisesaal!    Torches burningcymbals bangingflutes tootlingcitharae    twangingand a throng of fifty lovely Spartan virgins capering    before us, all down the High Street, singing \"Eloia! Eloia!
