They shivered at the  cold, to which they were not accustomed; they grumbled at the snow  which, by covering their playground, kept them from their usual  out-of-door sports, and held them for a time prisoners within the dark  schoolrooms.    Suddenly Napoleon had an inspiration.    \"What is snow for, my brothers,\" he exclaimed, \"if not to be used? Let  us use it. What say you to a snow fort and a siege? Who will join me?\"    It was a novel idea; and, with all the boyish love for something new and  exciting, the boys of Brienne entered into the plan at once. \"The fort,  the fort, young Straw-nose!\" they cried. \"Show us what to do! Let us  build it at once!\"    With Napoleon as director, they straightway set to work. The boy had an  excellent head for such things; and his mathematical knowledge, together  with the preparatory study in fortifications he had already pursued in  the school, did him good service.    He was not satisfied with simply piling up mounds of snow. He built  regular works on a scientific plan. The snow \"packed well,\" and the  boys worked like beavers. With spades and brooms and hands and homemade  wooden shovels, they built under Napoleon's directions a snow fort that  set all Brienne wondering and admiring. There were intrenchments and  redoubts, bastions and ramparts, and all the parts and divisions and  defences that make up a real fort.    It took some days to build this wonderful fort. For the boys could only  work in their hours of recess. But at last, when all was ready, Napoleon  divided the schoolboys into two unequal portions. The smaller number  was to hold the fort as defenders; the larger number was to form the  besieging force. At the head of the besiegers was Napoleon. Who was  captain of the fort I do not know. His name has not come down to us.    But the story of the Snow-ball Fight has. For days the battle raged. At  every recess hour the forces gathered for the exciting sport. The rule  was that when once the fort was captured, the besiegers were to become  its possessors, and were, in turn, to defend it from its late occupants,  who were now the attacking army, increased to the required number by  certain of the less skilful fighters in the successful army.    Napoleon was in his element. He was an impetuous leader; but he was  skilful too; he never lost his head.    [Illustration: \"_As leader of the storming-party  he would direct the attack_\"]    Again and again, as leader of the storming-party, he would direct  the attack; and at just the right moment, in the face of a shower  of snow-balls, he would dash from his post of observation, head the  assaulting army, and scaling the walls with the fire of victory in his  eye and the shout of encouragement on his lips, would lead his soldiers  over the ramparts, and  with a last dash drive the defeated  defenders out from the fortification.    The snow held for nearly ten days; the fight kept up as long as the snow  walls, often repaired and strengthened, would hold together.    The thaw, that relentless enemy of all snow sports, came to the  attack at last, and gradually dismantled the fortifications; snow for  ammunition grew thin and poor, and gravel became more and more a part of  the snow-ball manufacture.    Napoleon tried to prevent this, for he knew the danger from such  missiles. But often, in the heat of battle, his commands were  disregarded. One boy especially--the same Bouquet who had scaled his  hedge and brought him into trouble--was careless or vindictive in this  matter.    On the last day of the snow, Napoleon saw young Bouquet packing  snow-balls with dirt and gravel, and commanded him to stop. But Bouquet  only flung out a hot \"I won't!\" at the commander, and launched his  gravel snow-ball against the decaying fort.    Napoleon was just about to head the grand assault. \"To the rear with  you! to the rear, Bouquet! You are disqualified!\" he cried.    But Bouquet was insubordinate. He did not intend to be cheated out of  his fun by any orders that \"Straw-nose\" should give him. Instead of  obeying his commander, he sang out a contemptuous refusal, and dashed  ahead, as if to supplant his general in the post of leader of the  assault.    Napoleon had no patience with disobedience. The insubordination and  insolence of Bouquet angered him; and darting forward, he collared his  rebellious subordinate, and flung him backward down the slushy rampart.    \"Imbecile!\" he cried. \"Learn to obey! Drag him to the rear, Lauriston.\"    The fort was carried. But \"General Thaw\" was too strong for the young  soldiers; and that night, a rain setting in, finished the destruction of  the now historic snow-fort of Brienne School.    Bouquet, smarting under what he considered the disgrace that had been  put upon him before his playmates, accosted Napoleon that night in the  hall. \"Bah, then, smarty Straw-nose!\" he cried; \"you are a beast. How  dare you lay hands on me, a Frenchman?\"    \"Because you would not obey orders,\" Napoleon replied. \"Was not I in  command?\"    \"You!\" sneered Bouquet; \"and who are you to command? A runaway Corsican,  a brigand, and the son of a brigand, like all Corsicans.\"    \"My father is not a brigand,\" returned Napoleon. \"He is a  gentleman--which you are not.\"    \"I am no gentleman, say you?\" cried the enraged French boy. \"Why, young  Straw-nose, my ancestors were gentlemen under great King Louis when  yours were tending sheep on your Corsican hills. My father is an officer  of France; yours is\"--    \"Well, sir, and what is mine?\" said Napoleon defiantly.    \"Yours,\" Bouquet laughed with a mocking and cruel sneer, \"yours is but a  lackey, a beggar in livery, a miserable tip-staff!\"    Napoleon flung himself at the insulter of his father in a fury; but he  was caught back by those standing by, and saved from the disgrace of  again breaking the rules by fighting in the school-hall.    All night, however, he brooded over Bouquet's taunting words, and the  desire for revenge grew hot within him.    The boy had said his father was no gentleman. No gentleman, indeed!  Bouquet should see that he knew how gentlemen should act. He would not  fall upon him, and beat him as he deserved. He would conduct himself  as all gentlemen did. He would challenge to a duel the insulter of his  father.    This was the custom. The refuge of all gentlemen who felt themselves  insulted, disgraced, or persecuted in those days, was to seek vengeance  in a personal encounter with deadly weapons, called a duel. It is a  foolish and savage way of seeking redress; but even today it is resorted  to by those who feel themselves ill treated by their \"equals.\" So  Napoleon felt that he was doing the only wise and gentlemanly thing  possible.    But, even then duelling was against the law. It was punished when men  were caught at it; for schoolboys, it was considered an unheard-of  crime.    [Illustration: _Napoleon sends his Challenge_.]    Still, though against the law, all men felt that it was the only way  to salve their wounded honor. Napoleon felt it would be the only manly  course open to him; so, early next morning, he despatched his friend  Bourrienne with a note to Bouquet. That note was a \"cartel,\" or  challenge. It demanded that Mr. Bouquet should meet Mr. Bonaparte at  such time and place as their seconds might select, there to fight with  swords until the insult that Mr. Bouquet had put upon Mr. Bonaparte  should be wiped out in blood.    There was ferocity for you! But it was the fashion.    \"Mr. Bouquet,\" however, had no desire to meet the fiery young Corsican  at swords' points. So, instead of meeting his adversary, he sneaked off  to one of the teachers, who, as we know, most disliked Napoleon, and  complained that the Corsican, Bonaparte, was seeking his life, and meant  to kill him.    At once Napoleon was summoned before the indignant instructor.    \"So, sir!\" cried the teacher, \"is this the way you seek to become a  gentleman and officer of your king? You would murder a schoolmate; you  would force him to a duel! No denial, sir; no explanation. Is this so,  or not so?\"    Once more Napoleon saw that words or remonstrances would be in vain.    \"It is so,\" he replied. \"Can we, then, never work out your Corsican  brutality?\" said the teacher. \"Go, sir! you are to be imprisoned until  fitting sentence for your crime can be considered.\"    And once again poor Napoleon went into the school lock-up, while  Bouquet, who was the most at fault, went free.    There was almost a rebellion in school over the imprisonment of the  successful general who had so bravely fought the battles of the  snow-fort.    Napoleon passed a day in the lock-up; then he was again summoned before  the teacher who had thus punished him.    \"You are an incorrigible, young Bonaparte,\" said the teacher.  \"Imprisonment can never cure you. Through it, too, you go free from your  studies and tasks. I have considered the proper punishment. It is this:  you are to put on to-day the penitent's woollen gown; you are to kneel  during dinner-time at the door of the dining-room, where all may see  your disgrace and take warning therefrom; you are to eat your dinner on  your knees. Thereafter, in presence of your schoolmates assembled in the  dining-room, you are to apologize to Mr. Bouquet, and ask pardon from  me, as representing the school, for thus breaking the laws and acting as  a bully and a murderer. Go, sir, to your room, and assume the penitent's  gown.\"    Napoleon, as I have told you, was a high-spirited boy, and keenly felt  disgrace. This sentence was as humiliating and mortifying as anything  that could be put upon him. Rebel at it as he might, he knew that he  would be forced to do it; and, distressed beyond measure at thought of  what he must go through, he sought his room, and flung himself on his  bed in an agony of tears. He actually had what in these days we call a  fit of hysterics.    While thus \"broken up,\" his room"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/949"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat; Or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure (#12)"],[1,"not shout out some such  expression as \"Shiver my timbers!\" or \"Keel-haul the main braces,  there, you lubber!\" But Captain Weston was not that kind of a sailor,  though his usually quiet demeanor could be quickly dropped on  necessity, as Tom learned later.    A few minutes more and the waters closed over the top of the conning  tower. The Advance was completely submerged.  Through the thick glass  windows of the pilot house the occupants looked out into the greenish  water that swirled about them; but it could not enter. Then, as the  boat went lower, the light from above gradually died out, and the  semi-darkness gave place to gloom.    \"Turn on the electrics and the searchlight, Tom,\" directed his father.    There was the click of a switch, and the conning tower was flooded with  light. But as this had the effect of preventing the three from peering  out into the water, just as one in a lighted room cannot look out into  the night, Tom shut them off and switched on the great searchlight.  This projected its powerful beams straight ahead and there, under the  ocean, was a pathway of illumination for the treasure-seekers.    \"Fine!\" cried Captain Weston, with more enthusiasm than he had yet  manifested. \"That's great, if you don't mind me mentioning it. How deep  are we?\"    Tom glanced at a gage on the side of the pilot tower.    \"Only about sixty feet,\" he answered.    \"Then don't go any deeper!\" cried the captain hastily. \"I know these  waters around here, and that's about all the depth you've got. You'll  be on the bottom in a minute.\"    \"I intend to get on the bottom after a while,\" said Mr. Swift, \"but not  here. I want to try for a greater distance under water before I come to  rest on the ocean's bed. But I think we are deep enough for a test.  Tom, close the tank intake pipes and we'll see how the Advance will  progress when fully submerged.\"    The hissing stopped, and then, wishing to see how the motors and other  machinery would work, the aged inventor and his son, accompanied by  Captain Weston, descended from the conning tower, by means of an inner  stairway, to the interior of the ship. The submarine could be steered  and managed from below or above. She was now floating about sixty-five  feet below the surface of the bay.    \"Well, how do you like it?\" asked Tom of Mr. Damon, as he saw his  friend in an easy chair in the living-room or main cabin of the craft,  looking out of one of the plate-glass windows on the side.    \"Bless my spectacles, it's the most wonderful thing I ever dreamed of!\"  cried the queer character, as he peered at the mass of water before  him. \"To think that I'm away down under the surface, and yet as dry as  a bone. Bless my necktie, but it's great! What are we going to do now?\"    \"Go forward,\" replied the young inventor.    \"Perhaps I had better make an observation,\" suggested Captain Weston,  taking his telescope from under his arm, where he had carried it since  entering the craft, and opening it. \"We may run afoul of something, if  you don't mind me mentioning such a disagreeable subject.\" Then, as he  thought of the impossibility of using his glass under water, he closed  it.    \"I shall have little use for this here, I'm afraid,\" he remarked with a  smile. \"Well, there's some consolation.  We're not likely to meet many  ships in this part of the ocean. Other vessels are fond enough of  remaining on the surface. I fancy we shall have the depths to  ourselves, unless we meet a Government submarine, and they are hardly  able to go as deep as we can. No, I guess we won't run into anything  and I can put this glass away.\"    \"Unless we run into Berg and his crowd,\" suggested Tom in a low voice.    \"Ha! ha!\" laughed Captain Weston, for he did not want Mr. Swift to  worry over the unscrupulous agent. \"No, I don't believe we'll meet  them, Tom. I guess Berg is trying to work out the longitude and  latitude I gave him. I wish I could see his face when he realizes that  he's been deceived by that fake map.\"    \"Well, I hope he doesn't discover it too soon and trail us,\" went on  the lad. \"But they're going to start the machinery now. I suppose you  and I had better take charge of the steering of the craft. Dad will  want to be in the engine-room.\"    \"All right,\" replied the captain, and he moved forward with the lad to  a small compartment, shut off from the living-room, that served as a  pilot house when the conning tower was not used. The same levers,  wheels and valves were there as up above, and the submarine could be  managed as well from there as from the other place.    \"Is everything all right?\" asked Mr Swift as he went into the  engine-room, where Garret Jackson and Mr. Sharp were busy with oil cans.    \"Everything,\" replied the balloonist. \"Are you going to start now?\"    \"Yes, we're deep enough for a speed trial. We'll go out to sea,  however, and try for a lower depth record, as soon as there's enough  water. Start the engine.\"    A moment later the powerful electric currents were flowing into the  forward and aft plates, and the Advance began to gather way, forging  through the water.    \"Straight ahead, out to sea, Tom,\" called his father to him.    \"Aye, aye, sir,\" responded the youth.    \"Ha! Quite seaman-like, if you don't mind a reference to it,\" commented  Captain Weston with a smile. \"Mind your helm, boy, for you don't want  to poke her nose into a mud bank, or run up on a shoal.\"    \"Suppose you steer?\" suggested the lad. \"I'd rather take lessons for a  while.\"    \"All right. Perhaps it will be safer. I know these waters from the top,  though I can't say as much for the bottom.  However, I know where the  shoals are.\"    The powerful searchlight was turned, so as to send its beams along the  path which the submarine was to follow, and then, as she gathered  speed, she shot ahead, gliding through the waters like a fish.    Mr. Damon divided his time between the forward pilot-room, the  living-apartment, and the place where Mr. Swift, Garret Jackson and Mr.  Sharp were working over the engines. Every few minutes he would bless  some part of himself, his clothing, or the ship. Finally the old man  settled down to look through the plate-glass windows in the main  apartment.    On and on went the submarine. She behaved perfectly, and was under  excellent control. Some times Tom, at the request of his father, would  send her toward the surface by means of the deflecting rudder. Then she  would dive to the bottom again. Once, as a test, she was sent obliquely  to the surface, her tower just emerging, and then she darted downward  again, like a porpoise that had come up to roll over, and suddenly  concluded to seek the depths. In fact, had any one seen the maneuver  they would have imagined the craft was a big fish disporting itself.    Captain Weston remained at Tom's side, giving him instructions, and  watching the compass in order to direct the steering so as to avoid  collisions. For an hour or more the craft was sent almost straight  ahead at medium speed.  Then Mr. Swift, joining his son and the  captain, remarked:    \"How about depth of water here, Captain Weston?\"    \"You've got more than a mile.\"    \"Good! Then I'm going down to the bottom of the sea! Tom, fill the  tanks still more.    \"Aye, aye, sir,\" answered the lad gaily. \"Now for a new experience!\"    \"And use the deflecting rudder, also,\" advised his father.  \"That will  hasten matters.\"    Five minutes later there was a slight jar noticeable.    \"Bless my soul! What's that?\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Have we hit something?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Tom with a smile.    \"What, for gracious sake?\"    \"The bottom of the sea. We're on the bed of the ocean.\"          Chapter Twelve    For a Breath of Air      They could hardly realize it, yet the depth-gage told the story. It  registered a distance below the surface of the ocean of five thousand  seven hundred feet--a little over a mile. The Advance had actually come  to rest on the bottom of the Atlantic.    \"Hurrah!\" cried Tom. \"Let's get on the diving suits, dad, and walk  about on land under water for a change.\"    \"No,\" said Mr. Swift soberly. \"We will hardly have time for that now.  Besides, the suits are not yet fitted with the automatic air-tanks, and  we can't use them. There are still some things to do before we start on  our treasure cruise.  But I want to see how the plates are standing  this pressure.\"    The Advance was made with a triple hull, the spaces between the layers  of plates being filled with a secret material, capable of withstanding  enormous pressure, as were also the plates themselves. Mr. Swift, aided  by Mr. Jackson and Captain Weston, made a thorough examination, and  found that not a drop of water had leaked in, nor was there the least  sign that any of the plates had given way under the terrific strain.    \"She's as tight as a drum, if you will allow me to make that  comparison,\" remarked Captain Weston modestly. \"I couldn't ask for a  dryer ship.\"    \"Well, let's take a look around by means the searchlight and the  observation windows, and then we'll go back,\" suggested Mr. Swift. \"It  will take about two days to get the stores and provisions aboard and  rig up the diving suits; then we will start for the sunken treasure.\"    There were several powerful searchlights on the Advance, so arranged  that the bow, stern or either side could be illuminated independently.  There were also observation windows near each light.    In turn the powerful rays were cast first at the bow and then aft. In  the gleams could be seen the sandy bed of the ocean, covered with  shells of various kinds. Great crabs walked around on their long,  jointed legs, and Tom saw some lobsters that would have brought joy to  the heart of a fisherman.    \"Look at the big fish!\" cried Mr. Damon suddenly, and he pointed to  some dark, shadowy forms that swam up to the glass windows, evidently  puzzled by the light.    \"Porpoises,\" declared Captain Weston"]]]
