The authorities searched for Sokol badges or membership      cards, and those who were found to have these in their possession were      severely punished. The members of the Sokol societies as long as they      were in the army were invariably subjected to ill-treatment and      persecution. They were transferred to do heavy work, and not      recommended for promotion, and in every way treated more brutally than      other soldiers. In the case of both civil and military trials, one of      the most important questions asked, was whether the accused belonged to      any Sokol society, and if the accused did belong to a society this      always went against him.    _Bohemian History_        \"Every possible means was employed to wipe out the memory of important      events in Bohemian history. Not only were historical books (like      Luetzow's _Bohemia_ and others) confiscated, but even scientific      lectures on John Hus and the Hussite movement were prohibited. The      metal memorial plate with the names of Bohemian lords executed in 1621      inscribed upon it was removed from the Town Hall, and that part of the      square which showed the spot on which they were executed was ordered to      be repaved.        \"In order to destroy the idea that the Czechs are of Slav origin, any      use of red, blue and white colours was prohibited. Varnishes in these      colours were not allowed to be used. The street plates of pre-war times      had to be repainted in black and yellow. Newspaper posters, match-boxes      and other articles were not allowed to be sold or exhibited, if they      were painted in the Slav tricolours.    _The Suppression of Czech Literature_        \"More than two hundred books published before the war were confiscated.      The tendency of this action was clear. The government wanted to destroy      the memory of the glorious past of Bohemia, of John Hus and the Hussite      movement, of the suffering of the Czech nation after the defeat of the      White Mountain, to restrict all progressive and liberal movements and      to kill the 'Sokol' idea, and further to destroy the consciousness that      Czechs and Slovaks are the same nation and belong to the great Slav      family. The apostles of this idea were proclaimed traitors, especially      Dr. Kramar, J.S. Machar and others. These persecutions cover a great      period before the war, and the following is a list of the books      suppressed (follows a list comprising eleven foolscap columns). The      government treated the Czech nation with special brutality. The      persecutions in Bohemia were opposed not only to the liberal ideas of      Czechs, but especially to their national feelings. The anxiety of the      censor for the safety of the monarchy often bordered on absurdity. The      word 'shocking' was deleted from a play, for instance, because it was      English. _Henry IV_. was not allowed to be played 'until we reach a      settlement with England,' and it was only when it was reported by the      Vienna and Berlin papers that the prohibition was withdrawn.    _Persecution of the Czech Press_        \"The Czech press was persecuted in a peculiar manner. Its editors were      not allowed to receive papers from neutral countries and to express      their own opinions as regards the propaganda of the Czechs abroad.      Under threats of suppression of the journals and imprisonment of the      editors, the journals were obliged to print and publish articles      supplied to them by the police, without mentioning the source from      whence they came. The articles had to be put in in such a way that they      appeared as if they were the editors' views. The articles betrayed the      low intellectual level of the authors who lacked any knowledge of Czech      affairs. Such articles which the Czech journals were compelled to      publish were, for instance: 'In Foreign Pay,' published March 25, 1916;      'The Czechs in America against Masaryk's Agents,' published in all      Czech papers on April 8, 1916; on January 16, 1917, the article 'Our      Answer to the Quadruple Entente.'        \"The Police Directorate ordered first that such articles should appear      on the same day in all papers and in the same wording, but recognising      the stupidity of such an action, they compelled only one journal to      publish them and the others had to 'quote' from them.        \"Preventive censorship was established and a number of articles were      passed by the censor for publication in Czech papers only when proofs      were supplied that the articles had already appeared in some other      journal in Austria. _Independent articles or reports were not allowed      to be published_. The _Narodni Listy_ was treated with special spite by      the censorship.        \"_Almost ninety important journals were suppressed by the government_,      the majority of them without any apparent reason or justification.    _The Suppression of Czech School and National Literature_        \"Words, sentences or whole paragraphs in school books were found      objectionable, since they were alleged to propagate Pan-Slavism and to      encourage in the pupils hostile feelings against Austria's allies.      According to the official ideas about Austrian patriotism, purely      educational paragraphs were considered as wanting in patriotic feeling;      not only literary but also historical paragraphs were 'corrected,' and      official advice was issued as to how to write handbooks on patriotic      lines on special subjects, as for instance on natural history, physics,      geometry, etc. The foundations of all knowledge to be supplied to the      pupils in the public schools had to reflect the spirit of the world      war.        \"Numerous folk-songs with absolutely no political tendency in them were      confiscated, merely because they expressed the Czech national spirit.      All songs were suppressed which mentioned the word Slav--'The Slav      Linden Tree'--the army or the Allies. Even if the publishers offered to      publish new editions without the objectionable songs they were not      allowed to do so, and were asked to put in more 'loyal songs' and to      replace melancholy songs with cheerful ones.        \"In every secondary school a zealous library revision was started and      many books were removed, so that these libraries lost all their value      for the students. The Czech youth must not know the principal works      either of their own or foreign literature. Certain libraries had to be      deprived of some hundreds of books. All this happened at a time when      the discussions here and abroad were taking place about the importance      of raising the standard of knowledge of the educated classes.        \"The opening of Czech minority schools has been postponed since the      beginning of 1914. Consequently the Czech School Society must keep them      up and pay the expenses in connection with them, amounting to a loss of      more than two million kronen up till now. On the other hand, many      German schools have been established in Bohemia.        \"The steps which are being taken against Czech schools in Lower      Austria, especially in Vienna, are not only contrary to the standing      laws but also to the decisions of the ministry concerned.        \"We conclude by asking:        \"Are the above facts of systematic persecution of the Czech nation      during the war known to your Excellency?        \"Is your Excellency prepared to investigate them thoroughly?        \"Is your Excellency prepared to stop the persecution of the Czech      nation and the wrongs suffered by us through these proceedings?        \"_In Vienna, June_ 6, 1917.\"    [Footnote 1: For the full text of this document see Dr. Benes' _Bohemia's  Case for Independence_.]        V    HOW THE CZECHO-SLOVAKS AT HOME ASSISTED THE ALLIES    From the foregoing chapters it is clear that by continuous misrule and by  the attempt to reduce the Czecho-Slovak nation to impotence through  terrorism and extermination during this war, the Habsburgs have created a  gulf between themselves and their Czecho-Slovak subjects which can never  again be bridged over. Realising this, and seeing that since Austria has  voluntarily sold herself to Berlin their only hope for a better future lies  in the destruction of the political system called Austria-Hungary, the  Czecho-Slovaks have from the beginning staked their all on the victory of  the Entente, towards which they have contributed with all possible means at  their disposal.    1. Since they could not think of revolting, the Czecho-Slovaks at home  tried to paralyse the power of Austria in every way. Not only individuals  but also Czech banks and other institutions refused to subscribe to the war  loans. Their newspapers published official reports with reluctance, and  between the lines laid stress on news unfavourable to Austria so as to keep  up the spirit of the people. Czech peasants refused to give up provisions,  and thus the Czechs, who already before the war boycotted German goods,  accelerated the present economic and financial ruin of Austria.    2. Politically, too, they contributed to the internal confusion of the Dual  Monarchy, and to-day their opposition forms a real menace to the existence  of Austria. Czech political leaders unanimously refused to sign any  declaration of loyalty to Austria, and they never issued a single protest  against Professor Masaryk and his political and military action abroad. On  several occasions they even publicly expressed their sympathies and  approval of this action. For nearly three years they prevented the opening  of the Austrian Parliament which would have been to their prejudice. Only  after the Russian Revolution, when Austria began to totter and her rulers  were apprehensive lest events in Russia should have a repercussion in the  Dual Monarchy, did the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9662"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (#12)"],[1,"of quantity and number. In reality, there is  scarcely a proposition in Euclid so simple, as not to consist of more  parts, than are to be found in any moral reasoning which runs not into  chimera and conceit. Where we trace the principles of the human mind  through a few steps, we may be very well satisfied with our progress;  considering how soon nature throws a bar to all our enquiries concerning  causes, and reduces us to an acknowledgment of our ignorance. The chief  obstacle, therefore, to our improvement in the moral or metaphysical  sciences is the obscurity of the ideas, and ambiguity of the terms. The  principal difficulty in the mathematics is the length of inferences and  compass of thought, requisite to the forming of any conclusion. And,  perhaps, our progress in natural philosophy is chiefly retarded by the  want of proper experiments and phaenomena, which are often discovered by  chance, and cannot always be found, when requisite, even by the most  diligent and prudent enquiry. As moral philosophy seems hitherto to have  received less improvement than either geometry or physics, we may  conclude, that, if there be any difference in this respect among these  sciences, the difficulties, which obstruct the progress of the former,  require superior care and capacity to be surmounted.    49. There are no ideas, which occur in metaphysics, more obscure and  uncertain, than those of _power, force, energy_ or _necessary  connexion_, of which it is every moment necessary for us to treat in all  our disquisitions. We shall, therefore, endeavour, in this section, to  fix, if possible, the precise meaning of these terms, and thereby remove  some part of that obscurity, which is so much complained of in this  species of philosophy.    It seems a proposition, which will not admit of much dispute, that all  our ideas are nothing but copies of our impressions, or, in other words,  that it is impossible for us to _think_ of any thing, which we have not  antecedently _felt_, either by our external or internal senses. I have  endeavoured[10] to explain and prove this proposition, and have expressed  my hopes, that, by a proper application of it, men may reach a greater  clearness and precision in philosophical reasonings, than what they have  hitherto been able to attain. Complex ideas may, perhaps, be well known  by definition, which is nothing but an enumeration of those parts or  simple ideas, that compose them. But when we have pushed up definitions  to the most simple ideas, and find still some ambiguity and obscurity;  what resource are we then possessed of? By what invention can we throw  light upon these ideas, and render them altogether precise and  determinate to our intellectual view? Produce the impressions or  original sentiments, from which the ideas are copied. These impressions  are all strong and sensible. They admit not of ambiguity. They are not  only placed in a full light themselves, but may throw light on their  correspondent ideas, which lie in obscurity. And by this means, we may,  perhaps, attain a new microscope or species of optics, by which, in the  moral sciences, the most minute, and most simple ideas may be so  enlarged as to fall readily under our apprehension, and be equally known  with the grossest and most sensible ideas, that can be the object of  our enquiry.        [10] Section II.    50. To be fully acquainted, therefore, with the idea of power or  necessary connexion, let us examine its impression; and in order to find  the impression with greater certainty, let us search for it in all the  sources, from which it may possibly be derived.    When we look about us towards external objects, and consider the  operation of causes, we are never able, in a single instance, to  discover any power or necessary connexion; any quality, which binds the  effect to the cause, and renders the one an infallible consequence of  the other. We only find, that the one does actually, in fact, follow the  other. The impulse of one billiard-ball is attended with motion in the  second. This is the whole that appears to the _outward_ senses. The mind  feels no sentiment or _inward_ impression from this succession of  objects: Consequently, there is not, in any single, particular instance  of cause and effect, any thing which can suggest the idea of power or  necessary connexion.    From the first appearance of an object, we never can conjecture what  effect will result from it. But were the power or energy of any cause  discoverable by the mind, we could foresee the effect, even without  experience; and might, at first, pronounce with certainty concerning it,  by mere dint of thought and reasoning.    In reality, there is no part of matter, that does ever, by its sensible  qualities, discover any power or energy, or give us ground to imagine,  that it could produce any thing, or be followed by any other object,  which we could denominate its effect. Solidity, extension, motion; these  qualities are all complete in themselves, and never point out any other  event which may result from them. The scenes of the universe are  continually shifting, and one object follows another in an uninterrupted  succession; but the power of force, which actuates the whole machine, is  entirely concealed from us, and never discovers itself in any of the  sensible qualities of body. We know, that, in fact, heat is a constant  attendant of flame; but what is the connexion between them, we have no  room so much as to conjecture or imagine. It is impossible, therefore,  that the idea of power can be derived from the contemplation of bodies,  in single instances of their operation; because no bodies ever discover  any power, which can be the original of this idea.[11]        [11] Mr. Locke, in his chapter of power, says that, finding      from experience, that there are several new productions in      nature, and concluding that there must somewhere be a power      capable of producing them, we arrive at last by this reasoning      at the idea of power. But no reasoning can ever give us a new,      original, simple idea; as this philosopher himself confesses.      This, therefore, can never be the origin of that idea.    51. Since, therefore, external objects as they appear to the senses,  give us no idea of power or necessary connexion, by their operation in  particular instances, let us see, whether this idea be derived from  reflection on the operations of our own minds, and be copied from any  internal impression. It may be said, that we are every moment conscious  of internal power; while we feel, that, by the simple command of our  will, we can move the organs of our body, or direct the faculties of our  mind. An act of volition produces motion in our limbs, or raises a new  idea in our imagination. This influence of the will we know by  consciousness. Hence we acquire the idea of power or energy; and are  certain, that we ourselves and all other intelligent beings are  possessed of power. This idea, then, is an idea of reflection, since it  arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and on the  command which is exercised by will, both over the organs of the body and  faculties of the soul.    52. We shall proceed to examine this pretension; and first with regard  to the influence of volition over the organs of the body. This  influence, we may observe, is a fact, which, like all other natural  events, can be known only by experience, and can never be foreseen from  any apparent energy or power in the cause, which connects it with the  effect, and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other. The  motion of our body follows upon the command of our will. Of this we are  every moment conscious. But the means, by which this is effected; the  energy, by which the will performs so extraordinary an operation; of  this we are so far from being immediately conscious, that it must for  ever escape our most diligent enquiry.    For _first_; is there any principle in all nature more mysterious than  the union of soul with body; by which a supposed spiritual substance  acquires such an influence over a material one, that the most refined  thought is able to actuate the grossest matter? Were we empowered, by a  secret wish, to remove mountains, or control the planets in their orbit;  this extensive authority would not be more extraordinary, nor more  beyond our comprehension. But if by consciousness we perceived any power  or energy in the will, we must know this power; we must know its  connexion with the effect; we must know the secret union of soul and  body, and the nature of both these substances; by which the one is able  to operate, in so many instances, upon the other.    _Secondly_, We are not able to move all the organs of the body with a  like authority; though we cannot assign any reason besides experience,  for so remarkable a difference between one and the other. Why has the  will an influence over the tongue and fingers, not over the heart or  liver? This question would never embarrass us, were we conscious of a  power in the former case, not in the latter. We should then perceive,  independent of experience, why the authority of will over the organs of  the body is circumscribed within such particular limits. Being in that  case fully acquainted with the power or force, by which it operates, we  should also know, why its influence reaches precisely to such  boundaries, and no farther.    A man, suddenly struck with palsy in the leg or arm, or who had newly  lost those members, frequently endeavours, at first to move them, and  employ them in their usual offices. Here he is as much conscious of  power to command such limbs, as a man in perfect health is conscious of  power to actuate any member which remains in its natural state and  condition. But consciousness never deceives. Consequently, neither in  the one case nor in the other, are we ever conscious of any power. We  learn the"]]]
