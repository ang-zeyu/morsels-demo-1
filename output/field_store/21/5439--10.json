But, in that case, we must  presume, as I have not touched the safe, that the thing was taken from me  and put in the safe to compromise me. But I did not have a finger in this  pie until yesterday; and it is impossible that, during last night, when I  saw nobody, any one can have had time to prepare and contrive such a  determined plot against me. So--\"    The Prefect of Police interrupted this silent monologue by repeating:    \"What would be your opinion?\"    \"There would be an undeniable connection between that person's presence  in the house and the two crimes that had been committed.\"    \"Consequently, we should have the right at least to suspect the person?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"That is your view?\"    \"Decidedly.\"    M. Desmalions produced a piece of tissue paper from his pocket and took  from it a little blue stone, which he displayed.    \"Here is a turquoise which we found in the safe. It belongs, without a  shadow of a doubt, to the ring which you are wearing on your finger.\"    Don Luis was seized with a fit of rage. He half grated, through his  clenched teeth:    \"Oh, the rascals! How clever they are! But no, I can't believe--\"    He looked at his ring, which was formed of a large, clouded, dead  turquoise, surrounded by a circle of small, irregular turquoises, also of  a very pale blue. One of these was missing; and the one which M.  Desmalions had in his hand fitted the place exactly.    \"What do you say?\" asked M. Desmalions.    \"I say that this turquoise belongs to my ring, which was given me by  Cosmo Mornington on the first occasion that I saved his life.\"    \"So we are agreed?\"    \"Yes, Monsieur le Prefet, we are agreed.\"    Don Luis Perenna began to walk across the room, reflecting. The movement  which the two detectives made toward the two doors told him that his  arrest was provided for. A word from M. Desmalions, and Sergeant Mazeroux  would be forced to take his chief by the collar.    Don Luis once more gave a glance toward his former accomplice. Mazeroux  made a gesture of entreaty, as though to say:    \"Well, what are you waiting for? Why don't you give up the criminal?  Quick, it's time!\"    Don Luis smiled.    \"What's the matter?\" asked the Prefect, in a tone that now entirely  lacked the sort of involuntary politeness which he had shown since the  commencement of the examination.    \"The matter? The matter?--\"    Perenna seized a chair by the back, spun it round and sat down upon it,  with the simple remark:    \"Let's talk!\"    And this was said in such a way and the movement executed with so much  decision that the Prefect muttered, as though wavering:    \"I don't quite see--\"    \"You soon will, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    And, speaking in a slow voice, laying stress on every syllable that he  uttered, he began:    \"Monsieur le Prefet, the position is as clear as daylight. Yesterday  evening you gave me an authorization which involves your responsibility  most gravely. The result is that what you now want, at all costs and  without delay, is a culprit. And that culprit is to be myself. By way of  incriminating evidence, you have the fact of my presence here, the fact  the door was locked on the inside, the fact that Sergeant Mazeroux was  asleep while the crime was committed, and the fact of the discovery of  the turquoise in the safe. All this is crushing, I admit. Added to it,\"  he continued, \"we have the terrible presumption that I had every interest  in the removal of M. Fauville and his son, inasmuch as, if there is no  heir of Cosmo Mornington's in existence, I come into a hundred million  francs. Exactly. There is therefore nothing for me to do, Monsieur le  Prefet, but to go with you to the lockup or else--\"    \"Or else what?\"    \"Or else hand over to you the criminal, the real criminal.\"    The Prefect of Police smiled and took out his watch.    \"I'm waiting,\" he said.    \"It will take me just an hour, Monsieur le Prefet, and no more, if you  give me every latitude. And the search of the truth, it seems to me, is  worth a little patience.\"    \"I'm waiting,\" repeated M. Desmalions.    \"Sergeant Mazeroux, please tell Silvestre, the manservant, that Monsieur  le Prefet wishes to see him.\"    Upon a sign from M. Desmalions, Mazeroux went out.    Don Luis explained his motive.    \"Monsieur le Prefet, whereas the discovery of the turquoise constitutes  in your eyes an extremely serious proof against me, to me it is a  revelation of the highest importance. I will tell you why. That turquoise  must have fallen from my ring last evening and rolled on the carpet.    \"Now there are only four persons,\" he continued, \"who can have noticed  this fall when it happened, picked up the turquoise and, in order to  compromise the new adversary that I was, slipped it into the safe. The  first of those four persons is one of your detectives, Sergeant Mazeroux,  of whom we will not speak. The second is dead: I refer to M. Fauville. We  will not speak of him. The third is Silvestre, the manservant. I should  like to say a few words to him. I shall not take long.\"    Silvestre's examination, in fact, was soon over. He was able to prove  that, pending the return of Mme. Fauville, for whom he had to open the  door, he had not left the kitchen, where he was playing at cards with the  lady's maid and another manservant.    \"Very well,\" said Perenna. \"One word more. You must have read in this  morning's papers of the death of Inspector Verot and seen his portrait.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Do you know Inspector Verot?\"    \"No.\"    \"Still, it is probable that he came here yesterday, during the day.\"    \"I can't say,\" replied the servant. \"M. Fauville used to receive many  visitors through the garden and let them in himself.\"    \"You have no more evidence to give?\"    \"No.\"    \"Please tell Mme. Fauville that Monsieur le Prefet would be very much  obliged if he could have a word with her.\"    Silvestre left the room.    The examining magistrate and the public prosecutor had drawn nearer in  astonishment.    The Prefect exclaimed:    \"What, Monsieur! You don't mean to pretend that Mme. Fauville is  mixed up--\"    \"Monsieur le Prefet, Mme. Fauville is the fourth person who may have seen  the turquoise drop out of my ring.\"    \"And what then? Have we the right, in the absence of any real proof,  to suppose that a woman can kill her husband, that a mother can  poison her son?\"    \"I am supposing nothing, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"Then--?\"    Don Luis made no reply. M. Desmalions did not conceal his irritation.  However, he said:    \"Very well; but I order you most positively to remain silent. What  questions am I to put to Mme. Fauville?\"    \"One only, Monsieur le Prefet: ask Mme. Fauville if she knows any one,  apart from her husband, who is descended from the sisters Roussel.\"    \"Why that question?\"    \"Because, if that descendant exists, it is not I who will inherit the  millions, but he; and then it will be he and not I who would be  interested in the removal of M. Fauville and his son.\"    \"Of course, of course,\" muttered M. Desmalions. \"But even so, this  new trail--\"    Mme. Fauville entered as he was speaking. Her face remained charming and  pretty in spite of the tears that had reddened her eyelids and impaired  the freshness of her cheeks. But her eyes expressed the scare of terror;  and the obsession of the tragedy imparted to all her attractive  personality, to her gait and to her movements, something feverish and  spasmodic that was painful to look upon.    \"Pray sit down, Madame,\" said the Prefect, speaking with the height  of deference, \"and forgive me for inflicting any additional emotion  upon you. But time is precious; and we must do everything to make  sure that the two victims whose loss you are mourning shall be  avenged without delay.\"    Tears were still streaming from her beautiful eyes; and, with a sob, she  stammered:    \"If the police need me, Monsieur le Prefet--\"    \"Yes, it is a question of obtaining a few particulars. Your husband's  mother is dead, is she not?\"    \"Yes, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"Am I correct in saying that she came from Saint-Etienne and that her  maiden name was Roussel?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Elizabeth Roussel?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Had your husband any brothers or sisters?\"    \"No.\"    \"Therefore there is no descendant of Elizabeth Roussel living?\"    \"No.\"    \"Very well. But Elizabeth Roussel had two sisters, did she not?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Ermeline Roussel, the elder, went abroad and was not heard of again. The  other, the younger--\"    \"The other was called Armande Roussel. She was my mother.\"    \"Eh? What do you say?\"    \"I said my mother's maiden name was Armande Roussel, and I married my  cousin, the son of Elizabeth Roussel.\"    The statement had the effect of a thunderclap. So, upon the death of  Hippolyte Fauville and his son Edmond, the direct descendants of the  eldest sister, Cosmo Mornington's inheritance passed to the other  branch, that of Armande Roussel; and this branch was represented so far  by Mme. Fauville!    The Prefect of Police and the examining magistrate exchanged glances  and both instinctively turned toward Don Luis Perenna, who did not  move a muscle.    \"Have you no brother or sister, Madame?\" asked the Prefect.    \"No, Monsieur le Prefet, I am the only one.\"    The only one! In other words, now that her husband and son were dead,  Cosmo Mornington's millions reverted absolutely and undeniably to her, to  her alone.    Meanwhile, a hideous idea weighed like a nightmare upon the magistrates  and they could not rid themselves of it: the woman sitting before them  was the mother of Edmond Fauville. M. Desmalions had his eyes on Don Luis  Perenna, who wrote a few words on a card and handed it to the Prefect.    M. Desmalions, who was gradually resuming toward Don Luis his courteous  attitude of the day before, read it, reflected a moment, and put this  question to Mme. Fauville:    \"What was your son Edmond's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13065"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 1 (#13)"],[1,"gave him five florins a month, solely  to induce him to stay with me. I cannot refuse to believe this trait of  generosity, but I do not choose that it should be repeated. Farewell! I  thank you for your friendship, and hope soon to see you.    Yours ever,    BEETHOVEN.      55.    TO ZMESKALL.[1]    April 16, 1809.    If I cannot come to-day, dear Zmeskall which is very possible, ask Baroness  von ---- [name illegible] to give you the pianoforte part of the Trios, and  be so good as to send them and the other parts to me to-day.    In haste, your    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: April 16, 1809. By the Terzetts he no doubt means the Trios,  Op. 70, dedicated to Countess Erdoedy.]      56.    TO ZMESKALL.    April 17, 1809.    DEAR Z.,--    A suitable lodging has just been found out for me, but I need some one to  help me in the affair. I cannot employ my brother, because he only  recommends what costs least money. Let me know, therefore, if we can go  together to look at the house. It is in the Klepperstall.[1]    [Footnote 1: An der Moelker Bastei.]      57.    TO ZMESKALL.    April 25, 1809.    I shall be glad, right glad, to play. I send you the violoncello part; if  you find that you can manage it, play it yourself, or let old Kraft[1] do  so. I will tell you about the lodging when we meet.    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Anton Kraft (and likewise his son, Nicolaus Kraft) was a most  admirable violoncello-player, with whom Beethoven from the earliest days of  his residence in Vienna had played a great deal at Prince Lichnowsky's.  Kraft was at that time in Prince Lobkowitz's band.]      58.    TO ZMESKALL.[1]    May 14, 1809.    MY DEAR LITTLE MUSICAL OLD COUNT!--    I think after all it would be advisable to let old Kraft play, as the trios  are to be heard for the first time (in society), and you can play them  afterwards; but I leave it all to your own option. If you meet with any  difficulties, one of which may possibly be that Kraft and S. [Schuppanzigh]  do not harmonize well together, then Herr v. Zmeskall must distinguish  himself, not as a mere musical Count, but as an energetic musician.    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Kraft and Schuppanzigh were then each giving quartet  _soirees_.]      59.    TO FREIHERR V. HAMMER-PURGSTALL.[1]    1809.    I feel almost ashamed of your complaisance and kindness in permitting me to  see the MS. of your as yet unknown literary treasures. Pray receive my  sincere thanks. I also beg to return both your operettas. Wholly engrossed  by my professional avocations, it is impossible for me to give an opinion,  especially with regard to the Indian Operetta; as soon as time permits, I  will call on you for the purpose of discussing this subject, and also the  Oratorio of \"The Deluge.\" Pray always include me among the warm admirers of  your great talents.    I am, sir, with sincere esteem, your obedient    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: I see in Schindler's _Beethoven_, that he wished to have \"an  Indian Chorus of a religious character\" from this renowned Orientalist,  who, in sending his _Persian Operetta_, written \"rather with an ideal than  a musical object,\" and likewise an oratorio, _The Deluge_,  remarks:--\"Should you not find these works in all respects executed quite  to your taste, still I feel convinced that through the genius of a  Beethoven alone can music portray the rising of the great flood and the  pacifying of the surging waters.\"]      60.    TO FREIHERR V. HAMMER-PURGSTALL.[1]    1809.    Forgive me, my dear H----, for not having brought you the letter for Paris.  I have been, and still am, so much occupied, that day after day I am  obliged to delay writing it, but you shall have it to-morrow, even if I am  unable to come myself to see you, which I am most anxious to do.    There is another matter that I would most earnestly press on you; perhaps  you might succeed in doing something for a _poor unfortunate man_. I allude  to Herr Stoll, son of the celebrated physician. With many persons the  question is whether a man has been ruined by his own fault or by that of  others, but this is not so with either you or me; it is sufficient that  Stoll is unfortunate, and looks on a journey to Paris as his sole resource,  having last year made many influential acquaintances, who, when he goes  there, are to endeavor to procure him a professorship in Westphalia. Stoll  has therefore applied to Herr v. Neumann, in the State Chancery Office, to  send him with a government courier to Paris, but the latter refuses to take  him for less than twenty-five louis d'or. Now I request you, my dear  friend, to speak to Herr v. Neumann to arrange, if possible, that the  courier should either take Stoll _gratis_, or for a small sum. I am  persuaded that if there is nothing particular against it, you will be glad  to interest yourself in poor Stoll. I return to the country to-day, but  hope soon to be so fortunate as to enjoy an hour of your society. In the  mean time I send you my best wishes, and beg you will believe in the  sincere esteem of    Your obedient    LUDWIG v. BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Reichardt states that Stoll was in Vienna in the spring of  1809, which fixes the date of this letter. Napoleon bestowed a pension on  the young poet (who appears to have gone to Paris), mistaking him for his  father, the celebrated physician.]      61.    TO BARONESS VON DROSSDICK.    MY ESTEEMED THERESE,--    You will receive with this what I promised. Had not many serious obstacles  intervened, I would have sent you more, in order to show you that where my  friends are concerned _I always perform more than I promise_. I hope, and  do not doubt, that you are agreeably occupied and enjoying society, but not  too much, I trust, to prevent your thinking of us. It would show too much  confidence in you, or too high an estimation of my own merits, were I to  attribute the sentiment to you, \"That people are not together only when  present, but that the absent and the dead also live with us.\" Who could  ascribe such a thought to the volatile Therese, who takes the world so  lightly? Among your various occupations, do not forget the piano, or  rather, music in general, for which you have so fine a talent: why not then  seriously cultivate it? You, who have so much feeling for the good and the  beautiful, should strive to recognize the perfections of so charming an  art, which in return always casts so bright a reflection on us.    I live in entire quiet and solitude, and even though occasional flashes of  light arouse me, still since you all left this I feel a hopeless void which  even my art, usually so faithful to me, has not yet triumphed over. Your  pianoforte is ordered, and you shall soon have it. What a difference you  must have discovered between the treatment of the theme I extemporized on  the other evening and the mode in which I have recently written it out for  you? You must explain this yourself, only do not find the solution in the  punch! How happy you are to get away so soon to the country! I cannot enjoy  this luxury till the 8th. I look forward to it with the delight of a child.  What happiness I shall feel in wandering among groves and woods, and among  trees, and plants, and rocks! No man on earth can love the country as I do!  Thickets, trees, and rocks supply the echo man longs for!    You shall soon receive some more of my compositions, which will not cause  you to complain so much of difficulties. Have you read Goethe's \"Wilhelm  Meister,\" and Schlegel's \"Translations of Shakspeare\"? People have so much  leisure in the country, that perhaps you would like me to send you these  works? It happens that I have an acquaintance in your neighborhood; so  perhaps you may see me some morning early for half an hour, after which I  must be off again. You will also observe that I intend to bore you for as  short a time as possible.[1]    Commend me to the regard of your father and mother, though I have as yet no  right to claim it. Remember me also to your cousin M. [Mathilde]. Farewell,  my esteemed Therese; I wish you all the good and charm that life can offer.  Think of me kindly, and forget my follies. Rest assured that no one would  more rejoice to hear of your happiness, even were you to feel no interest  in your devoted servant and friend,    BEETHOVEN.    N.B. It would be very amiable in you to write me a few lines, to say if I  can be of any use to you here.    [Footnote 1: Herr v. Malfatti Rohrenbach, nephew of the renowned physician  who was so prominent in Beethoven's last illness, lately related to me in  Vienna as follows:--Beethoven went to pay a visit to young Frau Therese,  Baroness Drossdick, at Moedling, but not finding her at home, he tore a  sheet of music-paper out of a book, and wrote some music to a verse of  Matthisson's, and on the other side, inscribed, in large letters, \"To my  dear Therese.\" The \"Mathilde\" mentioned farther on was, according to  Baermann, a Baroness Gleichenstein. [See No. 45.]]      62.    A MDLLE. MDLLE. DE GERARDI.[1]    DEAR MDLLE. G.,--    I cannot with truth deny that the verses you sent have considerably  embarrassed me. It causes a strange sensation to see and hear yourself  praised, and yet to be conscious of your own defects, as I am. I consider  such occurrences as mere incitements to strive to draw nearer the  unattainable goal set before us by Art and Nature, difficult as it may be.  These verses are truly beautiful, with the exception of one fault that we  often find in poets, which is, their being misled by Fancy to believe that  they really do see and hear _what they wish to see and hear_, and yet even  this is far below their ideal. You may well believe that I wish to become  acquainted with the poet or poetess; pray receive also yourself my thanks  for the kindly feeling you show towards your sincere friend,    L. V. BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Nothing has hitherto been ascertained"]]]
