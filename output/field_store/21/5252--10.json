Weissman had told  me the range would be about 500 metres--30 seconds--31--32--33--has he  missed?--34--35--3--A dull rumble comes through the water and the  whole boat shakes. Hurra! we have hit, and the order \"Surface\" comes  along the voice pipe.    The cheerful voice of the blower is heard, evacuating the tanks; I run  to the conning tower and closely follow Weissman up the ladder. At last  I am on the bridge. There she is! What a sight!    I feel that I shall never forget what she looked like, though, if all  goes well, I shall see many another fine ship go to her grave.    But she was my first; I felt the same sensation when, as a boy, I shot  my first roe-deer in the Black Forest, one instant a living thing  beautiful to perfection, the next my rifle spoke and a bleeding carcase  lay beneath the fine trees. So with this ship. I am a sailor, and to  every sailor every ship that floats has, as it were, a soul, a  personality, an entity; to carry the analogy further, a merchant craft  is like some fat beast of utility, an ox, a cow, or a sheep, whilst a  warship is a lion if she is a battleship, a leopard if she is a light  cruiser, etc.; in all cases worthy game.    But War has little use for sentimentality! and in my usual wandering  manner I see that I have meandered from the point and quite forgotten  what she did look like.    What I saw was this:    I saw that the steamer had been hit forward on the starboard side. The  upper portion of the stem piece was almost down to the water level, her  foremost hold was obviously filling rapidly. Her stern was high out of  water, the red ensign of England flapping impotently on the ensign  staff. Her propeller, which was still slowly revolving, thrashed the  water, and this heightened the impression that I was watching the  struggles of a dying animal. The propeller was revolving in spasmodic  jerks, due, I imagine, to the fast failing steam only forcing the  cranks over their dead centres with an effort.    A boat was being lowered with haste from the two davits abreast the  funnel on one side, but when she was full of men and, due to the angle  of the ship, well down by the bow, someone inboard let go the foremost  fall or else it broke, for the bows of the boat fell downwards and half  a dozen figures were projected in grotesque attitudes into the sea. For  a few seconds the boat swung backwards and forwards, like a pendulum.    When she came to rest, hanging vertically downwards from the stern, I  noticed that a few men were still clinging like flies to her thwarts.  Truly, anything is better than the Atlantic in winter. Meanwhile the  ship had ceased to sink as far as outward signs went.    I mentioned this to Von Weissman, who was at my side with a slight  smile on his face, amused doubtless at the eagerness with which I  watched every detail of this, to me, novel tragedy. He answered me that  I need not worry, that she was being supported by an air lock somewhere  forward, that the water was slowly creeping into her and her boilers  would probably soon go.    This remarkable man was absolutely correct.    There was an interval of about five minutes, during which another boat,  evidently successfully lowered from the other side, came round her  stern, picked up one or two men from the water and also collected the  survivors in the hanging boat; then the steamer suddenly sank another  two feet, there was a dull rumbling, as of heavy machinery falling from  a height, a muffled report, a cloud of steam and smoke, a sucking noise  and then a pool in the water, in the middle of which odd bits of wood  and other buoyant debris kept on bobbing up. Nothing else!    No! I am wrong, there were two other things: a U-boat, representing the  might of Germany, and a whaler with perhaps twenty men in it,  representing the plight of England!    As she went I felt hushed and solemn, it was an impressive moment; a  slight chuckle came from imperturbable Weissman; he had seen too many  go to think much of it, and he gave an order for the helm to be put  over, so that we might approach the whaler.    They were horribly overcrowded, and were engaged in trying to sort  themselves into some sort of order. We passed by them at 50 yards and  Weissman, seizing his megaphone, shouted in English: \"Goodbye! steer  west for America!\" A cold horror gripped my heart. It was an awful  moment. I dare not write the thoughts that entered my head.    I turned away my head and faced aft, that he should not see my face;  looking back I saw the whaler rocking dangerously in our wash, and then  a commotion took place in her stern, from which a huge bearded man  arose and, shaking his fist in our direction, shouted something or  other before his companions pulled him down.    Von Weissman heard and his lips narrowed in. I held my breath in  suspense, but he evidently decided against what he had been about to  do, for with the order, \"Course north! ten knots,\" he went below.    I remained on deck watching the rapidly receding whaler through my  glasses until she was a mere speck--alone on the ocean, 150 miles from  land, Then the navigator came up, and with strangely mixed feelings of  exultant joy and depressing sorrow I went below.    Von Weissman was in the wardroom. I watched him unobserved. He was  humming a tune to himself and had just completed putting a green dot on  the chart. This done he lay back on the settee and closed his  eyes--strange, insoluble man!    For long hours I could not forget that whaler; I see it now as I write.  I suppose I shall get used to it all. What would Zoe say?    The most wonderful thing about man is that he can stand the strain of  his own invention of modern war!           *       *       *       *       *    I am rather tired to-night, but must just jot down briefly what has  taken place to-day, as there is never any time in the daylight hours.    Soon after dawn, at about 8 a.m., we sighted a fair-sized steamer of  about 3,000 tons, which we sunk, but I cannot say what she looked like,  or whether anyone escaped, as we never came to the surface at all, Von  Weissman sighting smoke on the western horizon just as he hit her. We  accordingly steered in that direction. However, I think she went almost  at once as Von Weissman put a dot (black) on the chart as we made  towards number 3.    I very much wanted to know whether there were any survivors, but I did  not like to ask him at the time and he has been in such an infernal  temper ever since that I haven't had a suitable opportunity.    The cause of his rage was as follows:    Steamer number 3 turned out to be a fine fat chap (of the Clan Line,  Von Weissman said, when we first sighted her). We moved in to attack  and fired our port bow tube. I waited in vain by the tubes for the  expected explosion--nothing happened, but after a couple of minutes a  snarl came down the voice pipe: \"Surface, GUN ACTION STATIONS!\"    I ran aft, and found the Captain white with rage.    \"Missed ahead!\" he said, with intense feeling, \"I'll have to use that  confounded gun.\"    In about three minutes the Captain and myself were on the bridge and  the crew were at their stations round the gun.    For the first time I saw the ship; she was stern on and apparently  painted with black and white stripes. As I examined her through  glasses--she was distant about 3,000 yards--I saw a flash aboard her  and a few seconds later a projectile moaned overhead and fell about  6,000 yards over. So she is armed, thought I, and she has actually  opened fire on us first.    The effect of this unexpected retort on the part of the Englishman was  to throw Weissman into a paroxysm of rage.    \"Why don't you fire? What the devil are you waiting for?\" etc., etc.,  were some of the remarks he flung at the gun crew.    I did not consider it advisable to mention to him that they were  probably waiting his order to fire, and also his orders for range and  deflection, as I had imagined that, here as everywhere else, an officer  controls the gun-fire. Apparently in this boat it is not so, as  Weissman takes so little interest in his gun that he affects to be, or  else actually is, ignorant of the elements of gun control.    At any rate, under the lash of his tongue, the gun's crew soon got into  action, the gun-layer taking charge. Our first shot was short, very  considerably so, as was also the second. Meanwhile the steamer had been  keeping up a very creditably controlled rate of fire, straddling us  twice, but missing for deflection, as was natural considering that we  were bows on to her.    I felt thoroughly in my element listening to the significant wail of  the enemy's shell, punctuated by the ear-splitting report of our own  gun. Weissman, gripping the rail with both hands, and to my surprise  ducking when one went overhead, watched the target with a fixed  expression, but made no attempt to control our gun-fire, which was far  from creditable, as is inevitable when it is left to the mercy of the  inferior intellect of a seaman.    However, at the tenth or eleventh round we hit her in the upper works,  as was shown by a bright red and yellow flash near her funnel. This did  not check her firing or speed in the least, in fact she seemed to be  gaining on us. She also began to zigzag slightly and throw smoke bombs  overboard, which were not so effective from her point of view as I had  thought they would be.    Matters were thus for some minutes. We had just hit her aft for the  second time, though the shooting was so disgustingly bad that I was  about to ask whether I might do the duties of control officer, when  there was a blinding flash and the air seemed filled with moaning  fragments. When I had recovered from my relief from finding that I was  personally uninjured, I observed that two of the gun's crew were  wounded and one was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7951"],[0,"Glimpses of Bengal (#12)"],[1,"of time, unconscious of the gradually changing  position of the rest of the world.    The fact is that here, away from Calcutta, I live in my own inner world,  where the clocks do not keep ordinary time; where duration is measured  only by the intensity of the feelings; where, as the outside world does  not count the minutes, moments change into hours and hours into moments.  So it seems to me that the subdivisions of time and space are only mental  illusions. Every atom is immeasurable and every moment infinite.    There is a Persian story which I was greatly taken with when I read it as  a boy--I think I understood, even then, something of the underlying idea,  though I was a mere child. To show the illusory character of time, a  _faquir_ put some magic water into a tub and asked the King to take a  dip. The King no sooner dipped his head in than he found himself in a  strange country by the sea, where he spent a good long time going through  a variety of happenings and doings. He married, had children, his wife and  children died, he lost all his wealth, and as he writhed under his  sufferings he suddenly found himself back in the room, surrounded by his  courtiers. On his proceeding to revile the _faquir_ for his  misfortunes, they said: \"But, Sire, you have only just dipped your head  in, and raised it out of the water!\"    The whole of our life with its pleasures and pains is in the same way  enclosed in one moment of time. However long or intense we may feel it to  be while it lasts, as soon as we have finished our dip in the tub of the  world, we shall find how like a slight, momentary dream the whole thing  has been....          SHELIDAH,    _9th August 1894._      I saw a dead bird floating down the current to-day. The history of its  death may easily be divined. It had a nest in some mango tree at the edge  of a village. It returned home in the evening, nestling there against  soft-feathered companions, and resting a wearied little body in sleep. All  of a sudden, in the night, the mighty Padma tossed slightly in her bed,  and the earth was swept away from the roots of the mango tree. The little  creature bereft of its nest awoke just for a moment before it went to  sleep again for ever.    When I am in the presence of the awful mystery of all-destructive Nature,  the difference between myself and the other living things seems trivial.  In town, human society is to the fore and looms large; it is cruelly  callous to the happiness and misery of other creatures as compared with  its own.    In Europe, also, man is so complex and so dominant, that the animal is too  merely an animal to him. To Indians the idea of the transmigration of the  soul from animal to man, and man to animal, does not seem strange, and so  from our scriptures pity for all sentient creatures has not been banished  as a sentimental exaggeration.    When I am in close touch with Nature in the country, the Indian in me  asserts itself and I cannot remain coldly indifferent to the abounding joy  of life throbbing within the soft down-covered breast of a single tiny  bird.          SHELIDAH,    _10th August 1894._      Last night a rushing sound in the water awoke me--a sudden boisterous  disturbance of the river current--probably the onslaught of a freshet: a  thing that often happens at this season. One's feet on the planking of the  boat become aware of a variety of forces at work beneath it. Slight  tremors, little rockings, gentle heaves, and sudden jerks, all keep me in  touch with the pulse of the flowing stream.    There must have been some sudden excitement in the night, which sent the  current racing away. I rose and sat by the window. A hazy kind of light  made the turbulent river look madder than ever. The sky was spotted with  clouds. The reflection of a great big star quivered on the waters in a  long streak, like a burning gash of pain. Both banks were vague with the  dimness of slumber, and between them was this wild, sleepless unrest,  running and running regardless of consequences.    To watch a scene like this in the middle of the night makes one feel  altogether a different person, and the daylight life an illusion. Then  again, this morning, that midnight world faded away into some dreamland,  and vanished into thin air. The two are so different, yet both are true  for man.    The day-world seems to me like European Music--its concords and discords  resolving into each other in a great progression of harmony; the  night-world like Indian Music--pure, unfettered melody, grave and  poignant. What if their contrast be so striking--both move us. This  principle of opposites is at the very root of creation, which is divided  between the rule of the King and the Queen; Night and Day; the One and the  Varied; the Eternal and the Evolving.    We Indians are under the rule of Night. We are immersed in the Eternal,  the One. Our melodies are to be sung alone, to oneself; they take us out  of the everyday world into a solitude aloof. European Music is for the  multitude and takes them along, dancing, through the ups and downs of the  joys and sorrows of men.          SHELIDAH,    _13th August 1894._      Whatever I truly think, truly feel, truly realise,--its natural destiny is  to find true expression. There is some force in me which continually works  towards that end, but is not mine alone,--it permeates the universe. When  this universal force is manifested within an individual, it is beyond his  control and acts according to its own nature; and in surrendering our  lives to its power is our greatest joy. It not only gives us expression,  but also sensitiveness and love; this makes our feelings so fresh to us  every time, so full of wonder.    When my little daughter delights me, she merges into the original mystery  of joy which is the Universe; and my loving caresses are called forth like  worship. I am sure that all our love is but worship of the Great Mystery,  only we perform it unconsciously. Otherwise it is meaningless.    Like universal gravitation, which governs large and small alike in the  world of matter, this universal joy exerts its attraction throughout our  inner world, and baffles our understanding when we see it in a partial  view. The only rational explanation of why we find joy in man and nature  is given in the Upanishad:     For of joy are born all created things.          SHELIDAH,    _19th August 1894._      The Vedanta seems to help many to free their minds from all doubt as to  the Universe and its First Cause, but my doubts remain undispelled. It is  true that the Vedanta is simpler than most other theories. The problem of  Creation and its Creator is more complex than appears at first sight; but  the Vedanta has certainly simplified it half way, by cutting the Gordian  knot and leaving out Creation altogether.    There is only Brahma, and the rest of us merely imagine that we are,--it  is wonderful how the human mind should have found room for such a thought.  It is still more wonderful to think that the idea is not so inconsistent  as it sounds, and the real difficulty is, rather, to prove that anything  does exist.    Anyhow, when as now the moon is up, and with half-closed eyes I am  stretched beneath it on the upper deck, the soft breeze cooling my  problem-vexed head, then the earth, waters, and sky around, the gentle  rippling of the river, the casual wayfarer passing along the tow-path, the  occasional dinghy gliding by, the trees across the fields, vague in the  moonlight, the sleepy village beyond, bounded by the dark shadows of its  groves,--verily seem an illusion of _Maya_; and yet they cling to and  draw the mind and heart more truly than truth itself, which is  abstraction, and it becomes impossible to realise what kind of salvation  there can be in freeing oneself from them.          SHAZADPUR,    _5th September 1894._      I realise how hungry for space I have become, and take my fill of it in  these rooms where I hold my state as sole monarch, with all doors and  windows thrown open. Here the desire and power to write are mine as they  are nowhere else. The stir of outside life comes into me in waves of  verdure, and with its light and scent and sound stimulated my fancy into  story-writing.    The afternoons have a special enchantment of their own. The glare of the  sun, the silence, the solitude, the bird cries, especially the cawings of  crows, and the delightful, restful leisure--these conspire to carry me  away altogether.    Just such noondays seem to have gone to the making of the Arabian  Nights,--in Damascus, Bokhara, or Samarkhand, with their desert roadways,  files of camels, wandering horsemen, crystal springs, welling up under the  shade of feathery date groves; their wilderness of roses, songs of  nightingales, wines of Shiraz; their narrow bazaar paths with bright  overhanging canopies, the men, in loose robes and multi-coloured turbans,  selling dates and nuts and melons; their palaces, fragrant with incense,  luxurious with kincob-covered divans and bolsters by the window-side;  their Zobedia or Amina or Sufia with gaily decorated jacket, wide  trousers, and gold-embroidered slippers, a long narghilah pipe curled up  at her feet, with gorgeously liveried eunuchs on guard,--and all the  possible and impossible tales of human deeds and desires, and the laughter  and wailing, of that distant mysterious region.          ON THE WAY TO DIGHAPATIAYA,    _20th September 1894._      Big trees are standing in the flood water, their trunks wholly submerged,  their branches and foliage bending over the waters. Boats are tied up  under shady groves of mango and bo tree, and people bathe screened behind  them. Here and there cottages stand out in the current, their inner  quadrangles under water.    As my boat rustles its way through standing crops it now and then comes  across what was a pool and is still to be distinguished by its clusters of  water-lilies, and"]]]
