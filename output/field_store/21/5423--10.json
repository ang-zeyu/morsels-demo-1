Suddenly I noticed that he was moving restlessly round me, that in his  turn he was frightened and was ordering me to let him out. I nearly  yielded, though I did not yet, but putting my back to the door I half  opened it, just enough to allow me to go out backward, and as I am very  tall, my head touched the lintel. I was sure that he had not been able  to escape, and I shut him up quite alone, quite alone. What happiness!  I had him fast. Then I ran downstairs; in the drawing-room, which was  under my bedroom, I took the two lamps and I poured all the oil onto  the carpet, the furniture, everywhere; then I set fire to it and made  my escape, after having carefully double-locked the door.    I went and hid myself at the bottom of the garden in a clump of laurel  bushes. How long it was! how long it was! Everything was dark, silent,  motionless, not a breath of air and not a star, but heavy banks of  clouds which one could not see, but which weighed, oh! so heavily on my  soul.    I looked at my house and waited. How long it was! I already began to  think that the fire had gone out of its own accord, or that he had  extinguished it, when one of the lower windows gave way under the  violence of the flames, and a long, soft, caressing sheet of red flame  mounted up the white wall and kissed it as high as the roof. The light  fell onto the trees, the branches, and the leaves, and a shiver of fear  pervaded them also! The birds awoke; a dog began to howl, and it seemed  to me as if the day were breaking! Almost immediately two other windows  flew into fragments, and I saw that the whole of the lower part of my  house was nothing but a terrible furnace. But a cry, a horrible,  shrill, heartrending cry, a woman's cry, sounded through the night, and  two garret windows were opened! I had forgotten the servants! I saw the  terrorstruck faces, and their frantically waving arms!...    Then, overwhelmed with horror, I set off to run to the village,  shouting: \"Help! help! fire! fire!\" I met some people who were already  coming onto the scene, and I went back with them to see!    By this time the house was nothing but a horrible and magnificent  funeral pile, a monstrous funeral pile which lit up the whole country,  a funeral pile where men were burning, and where he was burning also,  He, He, my prisoner, that new Being, the new master, the Horla!    Suddenly the whole roof fell in between the walls, and a volcano of  flames darted up to the sky. Through all the windows which opened onto  that furnace I saw the flames darting, and I thought that he was there,  in that kiln, dead.    Dead? perhaps?... His body? Was not his body, which was transparent,  indestructible by such means as would kill ours?    If he was not dead?... Perhaps time alone has power over that  Invisible and Redoubtable Being. Why this transparent, unrecognizable  body, this body belonging to a spirit, if it also had to fear ills,  infirmities and premature destruction?    Premature destruction? All human terror springs from that! After man  the Horla. After him who can die every day, at any hour, at any moment,  by any accident, he came who was only to die at his own proper hour and  minute, because he had touched the limits of his existence!    No ... no ... without any doubt ... he is not dead. Then ... then ... I  suppose I must kill myself!        FOOTNOTE.--This story is a tragic experience and prophecy. It was      insanity that robbed the world of its most finished short story      writer, the author of this tale; and even before his madness became      overpowering, de Maupassant complained that he was haunted by his      double--by a vision of another Self confronting and threatening      him. He had run life at its top speed; this hallucination was the      result.        Medical science defines in such cases \"an image of memory which      differs in intensity from the normal\"--that is to say, a fixed idea      so persistent and growing that to the thinker it seems utterly      real.        --EDITOR.          PIERRE MILLE    _The Miracle of Zobeide_      Always wise and prudent, Zobeide cautiously put aside the myrtle  branches and peeped through to see who were the persons talking by the  fountain in the cool shadow of the pink sandstone wall. And when she  saw that it was only the Rev. John Feathercock, her lord and master,  discoursing as usual with Mohammed-si-Koualdia, she went toward them  frankly but slowly.    When she was quite near she stopped, and from the light that played in  her deep black eyes you would have thought that surely she was  listening with the deepest attention. But the truth is that with all  her little brain, with all her mouth, and with all her stomach, she was  craving the yellow and odorous pulp of a melon which had been cut open  and put on the table near two tall glasses half filled with snowy  sherbet. For Zobeide was a turtle of the ordinary kind found in the  grass of all the meadows around the city of Damascus.    As she waited, Mohammed continued his story:    \"And, as I tell you, O reverend one abounding in virtues, this lion  which still lives near Tabariat, was formerly a strong lion, a  wonderful lion, a lion among lions! To-day, even, he can strike a camel  dead with one blow of his paw, and then, plunging his fangs into the  spine of the dead animal, toss it upon his shoulders with a single  movement of his neck. But unfortunately, having one day brought down a  goat in the chase by simply blowing upon it the breath of his nostrils,  the lion was inflated with pride and cried: 'There is no god but God,  but I am as strong as God. Let him acknowledge it!' Allah, who heard  him, Allah, the All-powerful, said in a loud voice, 'O lion of  Tabariat, try now to carry off thy prey!' Then the lion planted his  great teeth firmly in the spine of the animal, right under the ears,  and attempted to throw it on his back. Onallahi! It was as though he  had tried to lift Mount Libanus, and his right leg fell lamed to the  ground. And the voice of Allah still held him, declaring: 'Lion,  nevermore shalt thou kill a goat!' And it has remained thus to this  day: the lion of Tabariat has still all his old-time power to carry off  camels, but he can never do the slightest harm to even a new-born kid.  The goats of the flocks dance in front of him at night, deriding him to  his face, and always from that moment his right leg has been stiff and  lame.\"    \"Mohammed,\" said the Rev. Mr. Feathercock contemptuously, \"these are  stories fit only for babies.\"    \"How, then!\" replied Mohammed-si-Koualdia. \"Do you refuse to believe  that God is able to do whatever he may wish, that the world itself is  but a perpetual dream of God's and that, in consequence, God may change  this dream at will? Are you a Christian if you deny the power of the  All-powerful?\"    \"I am a Christian,\" replied the clergyman with a trace of  embarrassment; \"but for a long time we have been obliged to admit, we  pastors of the civilized Church of the Occident, that God would not be  able, without belying himself, to change the order of things which he  established when he created the universe. We consider that faith in  miracles is a superstition which we must leave to the monks of the  Churches of Rome and of Russia, and also to your Mussulmans who live in  ignorance of the truth. And it is in order to teach you this truth that  I have come here to your country, and at the same time to fight against  the pernicious political influence exerted by these same Romish and  Greek monks of whom I have just been speaking.\"    \"By invoking the name of Allah,\" responded Mohammed with intense  solemnity, \"and by virtue of the collar-bone of the mighty Solomon, I  can perform great miracles. You see this turtle before us? I shall  cause it to grow each day the breadth of a finger!\"    In saying these words he made a sudden movement of his foot toward  Zobeide, and Zobeide promptly drew her head into her shell.    \"You claim to be able to work a miracle like that!\" said the clergyman  scornfully. \"You, Mohammed, a man immersed in sin, a Mussulman whom I  have seen drunk!\"    \"I was drunk,\" replied Mohammed calmly, \"but not as drunk as others.\"    \"So you think yourself able to force the power of Allah!\" pursued Mr.  Feathercock, disdaining the interruption.    \"I could do it without a moment's difficulty,\" said Mohammed.    Taking Zobeide in his hand he lifted her to the table. The frightened  turtle had again drawn in her head. Nothing could be seen but the  black-encircled golden squares of her shell against a background of  juicy melon pulp. Mohammed chanted:    \"_Thou thyself art a miracle, O turtle! For thy head is the head of a  serpent, thy tail the tail of a water rat, thy bones are bird's bones  and thy covering is of stone; and yet thou knowest love as it is known  by men. And from thy eggs, O turtle of stone, other turtles come  forth_.    \"_Thou thyself art a miracle, O turtle! For one would say that thou  wert a shell, naught but a shell, and behold! thou art a beast that  eats. Eat of this melon, O turtle, and grow this night the length of my  nail, if Allah permit!_    \"_And when thou hast grown by the breadth of a finger, O turtle, eat  further of this melon, or of its sister, another melon, and grow  further by the breadth of a finger until thou hast reached the size of  a mosque. Thou thyself art a miracle, O shell endowed with life!  Perform still another miracle, if Allah permit, if Allah permit!_\"    Zobeide, reassured by the monotony of his voice, decided at last to  come out of her shell. First she showed the point of her little horny  nose, then her black eyes, her flat-pointed tail, and finally her  strong little claw-tipped feet. Seeing the melon, she made a gesture of  assent, and began to eat.    \"Nothing in the world will happen!\" remarked the Rev. John Feathercock  rather doubtfully.    \"Wa"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],[0,"Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#13)"],[1,"get hurt.  I'm doing this sort of thing just for exercise, you  understand.\"    Then they were called into the second round.  Quimby, in the meantime,  had been counseled to crowd the plebe hard, and to hammer him when  he got close.    So, now, Quimby started in to do broadside work.  At last he scored  fairly, hitting Dalzell on the nose and starting the flow.    But, within ten seconds, Dalzell had return the blow with interest.  After that things went slowly for a few more seconds, when time  was again called.    \"That plebe isn't exactly easy,\" Quimby confided to his seconds.  \"I've got to watch him, and be cautious.  I haven't seen a plebe as  cool and ready in many a day.\"    In the third round Quimby was perhaps too cautious.  He did not  rush enough.  Dan, on the other hand, bore down a bit.  Just before  the call of time he closed Quimby's right eye.    Both Quimby and his seconds were now dubious, though the youngster's  fighting pluck and determination ran as high as ever.    \"I've got to wipe him off the field in this fourth round, or go to  the grass myself,\" murmured Quimby, while his seconds did the best  they could with him.    \"I'm warming up finely,\" confided Dan to Dave and Rollins.    \"You're coming through all right,\" nodded Dave confidently.  \"At  present you have twice as much vision as the other fellow, and only  a fraction as much of soreness.  But keep on the watch to the end.\"    For the first twenty seconds of the new round it was Quimby who  was on the defensive.  Dan followed him up just warmly enough  to be annoying.    At last, however, Dan straightened, stiffened, and there was a  quick flash in his eyes.    He saw his chance, and now he jumped in at it.  His feint reached  for Quimby's solar plexus, but the real blow, from Dalzell's right  hand, hammered in, all but closing Quimby's other eye.    Smack!  Right on top of that staggerer came a hook that landed  on the youngster's forehead with such force that Quimby fell over  backward.  He tried to catch himself, but failed, and lurched  to the ground.    \"--six, seven, eight--\" counted the timekeeper.    Quimby staggered bravely to his feet, but stood there, his knees  wobbling, his arms all but hanging at his side.    Dan did not try to hit.  He backed off slightly keeping only at  half-guard and watching his opponent.    \"What's the matter, Quimby\" called Mr. Ferris.  \"Can't you go on?\"    \"Yes; I'm going on, to the knock-out!\" replied the youngster doggedly.    He tried to close in, but was none too steady on his feet.  Dan,  watching him, readily footed it, merely watching for the youngster  to lead out.    \"Time!\"    Quimby's two seconds rushed to his side.  Midshipman Ferris and  the time-keeper also gathered around.    \"Quimby,\" spoke the referee, \"you're in no shape to go on.\"    \"I can stand up and be hit,\" muttered the youngster gamely.    \"Mr. Dalzell, do you care to go further?\" asked Mr. Ferris.    \"I shan't attempt to hit Mr. Quimby, sir, unless he develops a  good deal more steam.\"    Ferris looked at Quimby's seconds.  They shook their head.    \"I award the fight to Mister Dalzell,\" declared Midshipman Ferris.    \"Oh, give it to Mr. Quimby, if you don't mind, sir,\" begged Dan.  \"He got the game, and might as well have the name along with it.\"    \"Mister, don't be touge all the time,\" cried Mr. Ferris sharply.    \"I don't mean to be, sir,\" replied Dan quite meekly.  \"What I  meant to convey, sir, is that I don't care anything about winning  fights.  The decision, sir, is of very little importance to me.  I don't fight because I like it, but merely because I need the  exercise.  A fight about once a week will be very much to my liking,  sir.\"    \"You'll get it, undoubtedly,\" replied Midshipman Ferris dryly.    \"Whee, won't it be great!\" chuckled Dan, in an undertone, as he  stepped over to his seconds.  \"Give me that towel, Dave.  I can  rub myself off.\"    While Dan was dressing, and Quimby was doing the same, one of  the seconds of the youngster class came over, accompanied by the  timekeeper.    \"Mister, you really do fight as though you enjoyed it,\" remarked  the latter.    \"But I don't,\" denied Dan.  \"I'm willing to do it, though, to  keep myself in condition.  Say once a week, except in really hot  weather.  A little game like this tones up the liver so that I  can almost feel it dancing inside of me.\"    As he spoke, Dalzell clapped both hands to his lower left side  and jumped up and down.    \"You heathen, your liver isn't there,\" laughed the time-keeper.    \"Isn't it?\" demanded Dan.  \"Now, I'm ready to maintain, at all  times, that I know more about my liver and its hanging-out place  than anyone else possibly can.\"    There was a note of half challenge in this, but the time-keeper  merely laughed and turned away.  Members of the second class usually  feel too grave and dignified to \"take it out of\" plebes.  That  work is left to the \"youngsters\" of the third class.    A little later Mr. Quimby presented himself for medical attendance.  His face certainly showed signs of the need of tender ministration.  \"Dan, why in the world are you so fresh?\" remonstrated Dave,  when the two chums were back in their room.  \"You talk as though  you wanted to fight every man in the upper classes.  You'll get  your wish, if you don't look out.\"    \"Old fellow,\" replied Dalzell quizzically, \"I expect to get into  two or three more fights.  I don't mean to be touge, but I do  intend to let it be seen that I look upon it as a lark to be called  out.  Then, if I win the next two or three fights also, I won't  be bothered any after that.  This is my own scheme for joining the  peace society before long.\"    Nor is it wholly doubtful that Dan's was the best plan, in the  long run, for a peaceful life among a lot of spirited young men.          CHAPTER XI    MIDSHIPMAN HENKEL DOES SOME THINKING      \"Busy\" asked Midshipman Henkel, of the fourth class, stepping  into the room which Farley and Page shared.    The release bell had just sounded, giving all of the young men  a brief interval of freedom before taps.    \"Not especially,\" laughed Farley, as he finished stacking his  books and papers neatly.    It was about a week after the night of Dan's fight with Midshipman  Quimby.    \"Let me get a good look at your face, Farley, under the light,\"  continued Henkel.  \"Why, it looks almost natural again.  My, but  it was a rough pounding that fellow, Darrin, gave it!\"    \"Yes,\" nodded Farley, flushing.    \"Let me see; isn't it about time that you squared matters up with  Darrin?\" went on Midshipman Henkel.    \"How?  What do you mean?\" demanded Farley, while Page, too, looked  on with interest.    \"Well, first of all, Darrin gets the whole bunch of us ragged by the  watchman.  The when you object, he pounds your face at his own sweet  will.\"    \"What are you trying to do?\" laughed Farley.  \"Are you trying to fan  up the embers of my wrath against Darrin?\"    \"Such embers shouldn't need much fanning,\" retorted Mr. Henkel coolly.  \"Surely, you are not going to let the dead dog lie?\"    \"Darrin and I fought the matter out, and he had the good fortune  to win the appeal to force,\" replied Plebe Farley stiffly.  \"I  don't associate with him now, and don't expect to, later on, if  we both graduate into the Navy.\"    \"That satisfies your notions of honor, does it, with regard to  a man who not only injured you, but pounded your face to a fearful  pulp?\"    Henkel's tone as he put the question, was one of bitter irony.    \"Do you know,\" demanded Farley, rising, his face now flushing  painfully, \"I don't wholly like your tone.\"    \"Forget it, then,\" begged Henkel.  \"I don't mean to be offensive  to you, Farley.  I haven't the least thought in the world like  that.  But I take this whole Darrin business so bitterly to heart  that I suppose I am unable to comprehend how you can be so meek  about it.\"    \"Meek?\" cried Farley.  \"What do you mean by that word?\"    \"Well, see here,\" went on Henkel coaxingly, \"are we men of spirit,  or are we not?  We fellows devise a little outing in the town  of Annapolis.  It's harmless enough, though it happens to be against  the rules in the little blue book.  We are indiscreet enough to  let Darrin in on the trick, and he pipes the whole lay off to  some one.  Result--we are 'ragged' and fifty 'dems.' apiece.  When you accuse Darrin of his mean work he gives you the lie.  True, you show spirit enough to fight him for it, but the fight  turns out to be simply more amusement for him.  Now, I've been  thinking over this thing and I can't rest until the mean work  is squared.  But I find you, who suffered further indignities  under Darrin's fists, quite content to let the matter rest.  That's  why I am astonished, and why I say so frankly.\"    Having delivered this harangue with an air of patient justice,  Henkel seated himself with one leg thrown over the edge of the  study table, waiting to hear what Farley could say in reply.  \"Well, what do you plan to do further in the matter?\" insisted  Midshipman Farley.    \"To get square with Darrin!\"    \"How?\"    \"Well, now see here, Farley, and you, too, Page, what has happened?  At first we had the class pretty sore against Darrin for getting our  crowd ragged.  Since the fight, however, in which you were pummeled  like--\"    \"Never mind my fate in the fight,\" interposed Farley.  \"It was  a fair fight.\"    \"Well, ever since the fight,\" resumed Henkel, \"Darrin has been  climbing up again in class favor.  Most of the boobies in the  fourth class seem to feel that, just because Darrin hammered you  so, the beating you received proves Darrin's innocence of a mean  act.\"    \"I can't help what the class concludes,\" retorted Farley stiffly.    \"Page, you have more spirit than that, haven't you?\" demanded  Henkel, wheeling upon Midshipman Farley's roommate.    \"I hope I have spirit enough,\" replied Page, bridling slightly,  \"but I am aware of one big lack.\"    \"What is"]]]
