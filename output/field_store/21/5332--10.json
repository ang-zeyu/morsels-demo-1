They did as he said, and spake together: We be worthy and well deserved  to suffer this, for we have sinned in our brother, seeing his anguish  when he prayed us and we heard him not, therefore this tribulation is  fallen upon us. Of whom Reuben said: Said not I to you, in no wise sin  not ye in the child, and ye would not hear me? Now his blood is wroken.  They knew not that Joseph understood them, forasmuch as he spake alway  to them by an interpreter. Then Joseph turned him a little and wept.  After he returned to them, and took Simeon in their presence and bound  him, and sent him to prison, and commanded to his ministers to fill  their sacks with wheat, and to put each man's money in their sacks, and  above that to give them meat to spend in their way; which did so. And  they took their wheat and laid it on their asses and departed on their  way. After, one of them, on the way, opened his sack for to give his  beast meat, and found his money in the mouth of his sack and said to his  brethren: My money is given to me again, lo! I have found it in my sack.  And they were all astonied: What is this that God hath done to us? Then  they came home to their father in the land of Canaan and told to him all  things that was fallen to them, saying: The lord of the country hath  spoken hard to us and had supposed that we been spies of that province,  to whom we answered that, we were peaceable people ne were no such  spies, and that we were twelve sons gotten of one father, one is dead  and the youngest is with our father in the land of Canaan. Which then  said to us: Now shall I prove whether ye be peaceable or no. Ye shall  leave here one brother with me, and lead home that is necessary for you,  and go your way and see that ye bring with you your youngest brother  that I may know that ye be none espies and that ye may receive this  brother that I hold in prison, and then forthon what that ye will buy ye  shall have license. And this said, each of them poured out the wheat,  and every man found his money bounden in the mouth of every sack. Then  said Jacob their father: Ye have made me without children. Joseph is  gone and lost, Simeon is bounden in prison, and Benjamin ye will take  away from me, on me come all these evils. To Reuben answered: Slay my  two sons if I bring him not again to thee; deliver him to me in my hand,  and I shall restore him again to thee. The father said: My son shall not  go with you, his brother is dead and he is left now alone, if any  adversity should hap to him in the way that ye go into, ye shall lead my  old hairs with sorrow to hell.    In the meanwhile famine and hunger oppressed all the land greatly. And  when the corn that they brought from Egypt was consumed, Jacob said to  his sons: Return ye into Egypt and buy for us some meat, that we may  live. Judah answered: That man said to us, under swearing of great  oaths, that: Ye shall not see my face ne come into my presence, but if  ye bring your youngest brother with you. Therefore if thou wilt send him  with us, we shall go together and shall buy for us that shall be  necessary, and if thou wilt not we shall not go. The man said as we oft  have said to thee, that if we bring him not we shall not see his visage.  Israel said to them: This have ye done into my misery, that ye told to  him that ye had another brother. And they answered: The man demanded of  us by order our progeny, if our father lived, if we had any brother. And  we answered him consequently after that he demanded, we wist not what he  would say, ne that he said bring your brother with you. Send the child  with us that we may go forth and live, and that we ne our children die  not for hunger. I shall receive thy son, and require him of my hand. If  I lead him not thither and bring him again, I shall be guilty to thee of  the sin ever after. If there had been no delay of this, we had been  there and come again by this time.    Then Israel their father said to them: If it be so necessary as ye say,  do ye as ye will; take with you of the best fruits of this land in your  vessels, and give ye and present to that man gifts, a little raisins,  and honey, storax, stacten, terebinthe, and dates, and bear with you  double money, and also the same money that ye found in your sacks, lest  there be any error therefore; and take with you Benjamin, your brother.  My God, that is almighty, make him pleasant unto you, and that ye may  return in safety with this your brother and him also that he holdeth in  prison; I shall be as a man barren therewhiles, without children. Then  the brethren took the gifts and double money and Benjamin, and went  forth into Egypt, and came and stood tofore Joseph; whom when he had  seen, and Benjamin, he commanded to the steward of his house that he  should do slay sheep and calves and make a feast, for these brethren  shall dine with me this day. He did as he was commanded and brought the  men unto his lord's house.    Then were they all afeard and said softly together: Because of the money  that we had in our sacks we be brought in that he take us with the  default, and shall by violence bring us and our asses into servitude.  Wherefore they said to the steward of the house, in the gate of the  house ere they entered, saying: We pray thee to hear us: the last time  that we came to buy victual, which when we had bought and departed, and  were on our way, for to give our beasts meat we opened our sacks, and we  found in the mouth of our sacks our money that we had paid, which we now  bring again of the same weight, and we have more other for to buy to us  that shall be necessary. It is not in our conscience to have it, we weet  never who put it in our sacks. He answered to him: Peace be among you,  fear ye nothing, the God of your father hath given to you the treasure  that ye found in your sacks, for the money that ye paid to me I have it  ready. And then he brought in Simeon to them, and brought them into the  house, and washed their feet, and gave meat to their asses. They made  ready and ordained their gifts and presents against the coming of  Joseph. They heard say that they should dine and eat there.    Then Joseph entered into the house, and they offered to him the gifts,  holding them in their hands, and worshipped him falling down to the  ground. And he debonairly saluted them and demanded them, saying: Is  your father in good health of whom ye told me, liveth he yet? They  answered: Thy servant our father is in good health and liveth yet, and  kneeled down and worshipped him. Then, said he, casting his eyes on his  brother Benjamin that was of one mother, and said: Is this your young  brother of whom ye told me? And also said, God be merciful to thee, my  son; he hied him from themward, for he was moved in all his spirits and  wept on his brother, and went into his bedchamber. After this he washed  his visage and came out making good countenance and commanded to set  bread on the board, and after that he set his brethren in order, each  after their age, and ate together, and Joseph sat and ate with the  Egyptians. For it was not lawful to the Egyptians to eat with the  Hebrews. And each of them were well served, but Benjamin had the best  part, and they ate and drank so much that they were drunken.    Then Joseph commanded the steward of his house to fill their sacks with  wheat as much as they might receive, and the money of the wheat put it  into every man's sack, and take my cup of silver, and the money of the  youngest, and put that in his sack. And all this was done. And on the  morn betimes they were suffered to depart with their asses. And when  they were gone out of the town and a little on their way, then Joseph  said to his steward: Make thee ready and ride after, and say to them:  Why have ye done evil for good? The cup that my lord is accustomed to  drink in, ye have stolen, ye might not do a worse thing. He did as  Joseph had commanded and overtook them, and said to them all by order  like as he had charge, which answered: Why saith your lord so, and doth  to us his servants such letting? The money that we found in our sacks we  brought again to thee from the land of Canaan, and how may it follow  that we should steal any gold or silver from the house of thy lord?  Look! at whom it be found of us all thy servants, let him die. Which  said to them: Be it after your sentence, at whom that it ever be found  he shall be my servant and the others shall go free and be not guilty.  Then he hied and set down all their sacks, beginning at the oldest unto  the youngest, and at last found the cup in the mouth of the sack of  Benjamin. Then they all for sorrow cut and rent their clothes, and laded  their asses again, and returned all into the town again. Then Judah  entered first with his brethren unto Joseph and all they together fell  down platte to the ground. To whom Joseph said: Why have ye done thus?  Know not ye that there is no man like to me in the science of knowledge?  To whom Judah answered: What shall we answer to thee, my lord; or what  shall we speak or rightfully desire? God hath found and remembered the  iniquity of us thy servants, for we be all thy servants, yea, we and he  at whom the cup was found. Joseph answered: God forbid that I should so  do, whosoever stole the cup shall be my servant, and go ye your way, for  ye shall be free and go to your father. Then Judah approached near him  and spake with a hardy cheer to him and said: I beseech thee my lord to  hear me thy servant that I may say to thine audience a word, and that  thou wilt not be wroth to thy servant. Thou art next to Pharaoh; my  lord, thou demandedst first of us thy servants: Have ye a father or  brother?

They are all traditionally religious, tracing their  descent from some of the best men (Huguenots and Dutch) the world ever  saw. Hence they claim to themselves the title of \"Christians\", and all  the colored race are \"black property\" or \"creatures\". They being the  chosen people of God, the heathen are given to them for an inheritance,  and they are the rod of divine vengeance on the heathen, as were the  Jews of old. Living in the midst of a native population much larger than  themselves, and at fountains removed many miles from each other, they  feel somewhat in the same insecure position as do the Americans in  the Southern States. The first question put by them to strangers is  respecting peace; and when they receive reports from disaffected or  envious natives against any tribe, the case assumes all the appearance  and proportions of a regular insurrection. Severe measures then appear  to the most mildly disposed among them as imperatively called for, and,  however bloody the massacre that follows, no qualms of conscience ensue:  it is a dire necessity for the sake of peace. Indeed, the late Mr.  Hendrick Potgeiter most devoutly believed himself to be the great  peacemaker of the country.    But how is it that the natives, being so vastly superior in numbers to  the Boers, do not rise and annihilate them? The people among whom they  live are Bechuanas, not Caffres, though no one would ever learn that  distinction from a Boer; and history does not contain one single  instance in which the Bechuanas, even those of them who possess  fire-arms, have attacked either the Boers or the English. If there is  such an instance, I am certain it is not generally known, either beyond  or in the Cape Colony. They have defended themselves when attacked, as  in the case of Sechele, but have never engaged in offensive war with  Europeans. We have a very different tale to tell of the Caffres, and the  difference has always been so evident to these border Boers that, ever  since those \"magnificent savages\"* obtained possession of fire-arms, not  one Boer has ever attempted to settle in Caffreland, or even face them  as an enemy in the field. The Boers have generally manifested a marked  antipathy to any thing but \"long-shot\" warfare, and, sidling away in  their emigrations toward the more effeminate Bechuanas, have left their  quarrels with the Caffres to be settled by the English, and their wars  to be paid for by English gold.       * The \"United Service Journal\" so styles them.    The Bakwains at Kolobeng had the spectacle of various tribes enslaved  before their eyes--the Bakatla, the Batlokua, the Bahukeng, the  Bamosetla, and two other tribes of Bakwains were all groaning under  the oppression of unrequited labor. This would not have been felt as so  great an evil but that the young men of those tribes, anxious to obtain  cattle, the only means of rising to respectability and importance among  their own people, were in the habit of sallying forth, like our Irish  and Highland reapers, to procure work in the Cape Colony. After laboring  there three or four years, in building stone dikes and dams for the  Dutch farmers, they were well content if at the end of that time they  could return with as many cows. On presenting one to their chief, they  ranked as respectable men in the tribe ever afterward. These volunteers  were highly esteemed among the Dutch, under the name of Mantatees. They  were paid at the rate of one shilling a day and a large loaf of bread  between six of them. Numbers of them, who had formerly seen me about  twelve hundred miles inland from the Cape, recognized me with the loud  laughter of joy when I was passing them at their work in the Roggefelt  and Bokkefelt, within a few days of Cape Town. I conversed with them and  with elders of the Dutch Church, for whom they were working, and found  that the system was thoroughly satisfactory to both parties. I do not  believe that there is one Boer, in the Cashan or Magaliesberg country,  who would deny that a law was made, in consequence of this labor passing  to the colony, to deprive these laborers of their hardly-earned cattle,  for the very cogent reason that, \"if they want to work, let them work  for us their masters,\" though boasting that in their case it would not  be paid for. I can never cease to be most unfeignedly thankful that I  was not born in a land of slaves. No one can understand the effect of  the unutterable meanness of the slave-system on the minds of those  who, but for the strange obliquity which prevents them from feeling the  degradation of not being gentlemen enough to pay for services rendered,  would be equal in virtue to ourselves. Fraud becomes as natural to them  as \"paying one's way\" is to the rest of mankind.    Wherever a missionary lives, traders are sure to come; they are mutually  dependent, and each aids in the work of the other; but experience shows  that the two employments can not very well be combined in the same  person. Such a combination would not be morally wrong, for nothing would  be more fair, and apostolical too, than that the man who devotes  his time to the spiritual welfare of a people should derive temporal  advantage from upright commerce, which traders, who aim exclusively at  their own enrichment, modestly imagine ought to be left to them. But,  though it is right for missionaries to trade, the present system of  missions renders it inexpedient to spend time in so doing. No missionary  with whom I ever came in contact, traded; and while the traders, whom  we introduced and rendered secure in the country, waxed rich, the  missionaries have invariably remained poor, and have died so. The  Jesuits, in Africa at least, were wiser in their generation than we;  theirs were large, influential communities, proceeding on the system of  turning the abilities of every brother into that channel in which he  was most likely to excel; one, fond of natural history, was allowed to  follow his bent; another, fond of literature, found leisure to pursue  his studies; and he who was great in barter was sent in search of ivory  and gold-dust; so that while in the course of performing the religious  acts of his mission to distant tribes, he found the means of aiding  effectually the brethren whom he had left in the central settlement.* We  Protestants, with the comfortable conviction of superiority, have sent  out missionaries with a bare subsistence only, and are unsparing in our  laudations of some for not being worldly-minded whom our niggardliness  made to live as did the prodigal son. I do not speak of myself, nor need  I to do so, but for that very reason I feel at liberty to interpose a  word in behalf of others. I have before my mind at this moment facts and  instances which warrant my putting the case in this way: The command to  \"go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature\" must be  obeyed by Christians either personally or by substitute. Now it is quite  possible to find men whose love for the heathen and devotion to the work  will make them ready to go forth on the terms \"bare subsistence\", but  what can be thought of the justice, to say nothing of the generosity,  of Christians and churches who not only work their substitutes at the  lowest terms, but regard what they give as charity! The matter is the  more grave in respect to the Protestant missionary, who may have a wife  and family. The fact is, there are many cases in which it is right,  virtuous, and praiseworthy for a man to sacrifice every thing for a  great object, but in which it would be very wrong for others, interested  in the object as much as he, to suffer or accept the sacrifice, if they  can prevent it.       * The Dutch clergy, too, are not wanting in worldly wisdom. A     fountain is bought, and the lands which it can irrigate     parceled out and let to villagers.  As they increase in     numbers, the rents rise and the church becomes rich.  With 200     Pounds per annum in addition from government, the salary     amounts to 400 or 500 Pounds a year. The clergymen then preach     abstinence from politics as a Christian duty. It is quite     clear that, with 400 Pounds a year, but little else except     pure spirituality is required.    English traders sold those articles which the Boers most dread, namely,  arms and ammunition; and when the number of guns amounted to five, so  much alarm was excited among our neighbors that an expedition of several  hundred Boers was seriously planned to deprive the Bakwains of their  guns. Knowing that the latter would rather have fled to the Kalahari  Desert than deliver up their weapons and become slaves, I proceeded to  the commandant, Mr. Gert Krieger, and, representing the evils of any  such expedition, prevailed upon him to defer it; but that point being  granted, the Boer wished to gain another, which was that I should act as  a spy over the Bakwains.    I explained the impossibility of my complying with his wish, even though  my principles as an Englishman had not stood in the way, by referring to  an instance in which Sechele had gone with his whole force to punish  an under-chief without my knowledge. This man, whose name was Kake,  rebelled, and was led on in his rebellion by his father-in-law, who  had been regicide in the case of Sechele's father. Several of those who  remained faithful to that chief were maltreated by Kake while passing  to the Desert in search of skins. We had just come to live with the  Bakwains when this happened, and Sechele consulted me. I advised mild  measures, but the messengers he sent to Kake were taunted with the  words, \"He"]]]
